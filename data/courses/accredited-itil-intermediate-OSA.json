Well, Operational Support and\n\n7\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.050\nAnalysis is primarily focused\non service operations.\n\n8\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.090\nOne of the five lifecycle stages.\n\n9\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.470\nThis course is\nan intermediate level course.\n\n10\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.460\nAnd it follows a prerequisite,\nITIL foundations.\n\n11\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.200\nSo what we'll do is we'll review\nfoundations very briefly.\n\n12\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.240\nMaking sure we got\nthe right language in play.\n\n13\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.200\nAnd then we'll dive in deep into\nthe five processes in play.\n\n14\n00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.850\nIncident management, problem management,\nevent management, access management, and\n\n15\n00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.490\nrequest fulfillment.\n\n16\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.290\nAnd then we'll look at the people\nthat get those things done.\n\n17\n00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.880\nAnd those people are spread\nacross four functions.\n\n18\n00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.740\nIT operations management, technical\nmanagement, applications management and\n\n19\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.930\nthe service desk.\n\n20\n00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.950\nAnd of course because it's\noperational support and analysis.\n\n21\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.700\nWe'll also be looking about the best ways\nto analyze these different processes\n\n22\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.220\nand functions.\n\n23\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.350\nTo make sure that they're\noperating at the highest levels.\n\n24\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nSo\n\n25\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.940\nwho would say is the intended audience for\nthis series?\n\n26\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.210\nIs it, I guess in general,\nwho would get the most benefit out of it?\n\n27\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.590\n&gt;&gt; It's a good question.\n\n28\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.550\nCertainly you're gonna get a lot of\nvaluable information that could go back to\n\n29\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.520\nyour office space, your work space,\nand make some improvements.\n\n30\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.490\nRight, ITIL is the best practice for\nIT service management.\n\n31\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.840\nYou could certainly take these principles\nback into your operational environments.\n\n32\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.170\nAnd begin to consider how to\nimplement these or approve those.\n\n33\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.230\nIt also is good for the academic study.\n\n34\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.220\nWe're gonna help you prepare for\nan exam as well.\n\n35\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.090\nSo if you're on a path\ntowards certification.\n\n36\n00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.410\nMaybe you're seeking the certificate\nto be an ITIL expert.\n\n37\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.490\nThis is gonna be along that path as well.\n\n38\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.260\nSo we do spend sometime preparing you for\nthe exam..\n\n39\n00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.620\nAnd giving you some pointers\non how that exam looks.\n\n40\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.060\nSo I think it's both for\nthe practical purposes and\n\n41\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.040\nshowing you there's lots\nof meat on that bone.\n\n42\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.240\nBut if you're on an academic path for\ncertification.\n\n43\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.760\nYou're gonna get something\nto chew on as well.\n\n44\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.430\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell speaking of certification.\n\n45\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.210\nIf you are on that path,\n\n46\n00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.970\nwhat can somebody who is going down\nthat road expect from the exam?\n\n47\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.830\nHow do we get signed up for it?\n\n48\n00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.160\nWhat should we do as exam takers?\n\n49\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, good question.\n\n50\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.080\nFirst of all, the exam at the intermediate\nlevel is certainly different than\n\n51\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.400\nthe foundation exam.\n\n52\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.810\nThe foundation exam was 40 questions,\none correct answer.\n\n53\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.270\nAnd you had to get 26 out of 40.\n\n54\n00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.430\n65% to get that certificate and\nearn that certificate.\n\n55\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.980\nAt the intermediate level,\nyou have to perform a little higher.\n\n56\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.590\nAnd it's a bit harder.\n\n57\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.880\nThere's only eight questions.\n\n58\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.930\nEach question is based on\nan independent scenario.\n\n59\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.952\nAnd the questions have\nanswers of gradient scoring.\n\n60\n00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:35.840\nSo in other words, you could pick\na level answer is the best answer and\n\n61\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.320\nget five points credit.\n\n62\n00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.380\nOr pick a question\nthat's only worth three.\n\n63\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.890\nOver eight questions, if the most you\ncan get in each question is five points.\n\n64\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.630\nThat's 40 points at maximum.\n\n65\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.100\nYou have to get at least 28 correct.\n\n66\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.190\nSo, it's not just route\nmemorization of concepts and words.\n\n67\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.100\nWhich is such as what foundation was.\n\n68\n00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.870\nYou have to apply that knowledge, and\n\n69\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.430\nanalyze the situation and\napply appropriately.\n\n70\n00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.700\nSo therefore, it's a little bit more\nchallenging, but also pretty realistic.\n\n71\n00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.300\nThey're kind of fun actually.\n\n72\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.860\nAnd to be able to take something and\ndo something with it.\n\n73\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.770\nAnd that's what this\nexam expects you to do.\n\n74\n00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, well if that sounds like\nsomething that might interest you.\n\n75\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.075\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou in our upcoming series.\n\n76\n00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:20.614\n[SOUND]\n\n",

going?\n\n13\n00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.650\n&gt;&gt; Very good Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.580\nI'm glad to be back and\n\n15\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.140\nwe've got a lot to talk about with this\ncourse, Operational Support Analysis.\n\n16\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.270\nThe good news is a lot of people in IT\ncome from the operational background,\n\n17\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.400\nso it's quite intuitive for most students,\nand I look forward to diving in.\n\n18\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.850\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well I guess that's\na good place to start, let's dive in.\n\n19\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.450\nThis is our first episode.\n\n20\n00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.850\nWhere do we begin when it comes\nto this exam specifically?\n\n21\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.640\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthis is an intermediate level exam.\n\n22\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.030\nTo qualify for the certification,\nyou will have had to had foundation, and\n\n23\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.890\nthat's another course\noffered here at ITProTV and\n\n24\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250\nafter foundation you get\nto intermediate level.\n\n25\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.020\nAnd intermediate level is just\na different kind of animal.\n\n26\n00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.290\nIt's certainly tameable.\n\n27\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.030\nAnd we need to look at some logistics.\n\n28\n00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.630\nLet's have a look at OSA in particular.\n\n29\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.640\nIf you'll look at the next\nslide here you'll see that\n\n30\n00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.450\noperational support analysis,\nOSA Has a lot of topics.\n\n31\n00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.210\nA few processes, you see incident,\nproblem, event, request,\n\n32\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.620\naccess management, so five processes.\n\n33\n00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.680\nFour functions, service desk,\n\n34\n00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.640\ntechnical management, IT operations\nmanagement, application management.\n\n35\n00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.510\nAnd then some basic concepts\naround all those processes and\n\n36\n00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.650\nall those functions related to roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n37\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.820\nThe technology those functions\nneed to be successful and\n\n38\n00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.680\nhow would you go about\nimplementing these functions and\n\n39\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.460\nthese processes successfully\nwithin the framework of ITIL.\n\n40\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.070\nOf course we're gonna go\nthrough that subject matter but\n\n41\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.310\nwe're also going to help you prepare for\nan exam.\n\n42\n00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.940\nOkay, and in that regard you need to know\nthat it is a little different animal.\n\n43\n00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.980\nITIL foundation was based on a level\nof taxonomy, Bloom's Taxonomy,\n\n44\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.540\nwhere you needed to remember and\nunderstand, so level 1 and 2.\n\n45\n00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.830\nWe're going up higher up the food chain\na little bit here where you have to take\n\n46\n00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.400\ngood knowledge and apply and analyze it.\n\n47\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.250\nRight, so you're applying the knowledge,\nyou're analyzing situations, and\n\n48\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.950\nyou're applying that knowledge.\n\n49\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.520\nSo a little bit higher order thinking,\nit's not difficult.\n\n50\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.080\nIn fact,\nit is where a lot of students end up\n\n51\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.340\nspreading their wings a little\nbit because it's practical.\n\n52\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.730\nIt's how you go about using this stuff\ninstead of trying to just memorize\n\n53\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.930\na bunch of stuff.\n\n54\n00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.080\nSo I think you'll find that useful\nas you go and prepare for the exam.\n\n55\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.816\nAnd lots to learn.\n\n56\n00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:50.429\nSo our approach is certainly I will be\npresenting, giving you some theory,\n\n57\n00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:51.959\nsome lecture if you will,\n\n58\n00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.940\ngiving you some real world examples\nto try to make this come to life.\n\n59\n00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.380\nThrough that learning you can also\nlearn by interacting with others.\n\n60\n00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.880\nThe discussion forms.\n\n61\n00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.510\nIt's a very important aspect and a very\nimportant utility and a feature available\n\n62\n00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.570\nhere at ITPro.TV that largely interact\nwith other students as well as experts.\n\n63\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.380\nSo that interaction is also important.\n\n64\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.990\nThere's exercises available for download.\n\n65\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.040\nWe'll get to more details\nabout that later.\n\n66\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.300\nThere's knowledge checks.\n\n67\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.120\nThere are case study analysis and\napplication that you can practice.\n\n68\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.802\nAnd, of course, very valuable\nare these practice exam tests that\n\n69\n00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:29.610\nare also available for download.\n\n70\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.060\nThese practice exams are probably\nthe most valuable tool,\n\n71\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.470\nin the toolkit, in terms of getting\nyour mind around the exam piece.\n\n72\n00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.630\nSo think of it in two parts.\n\n73\n00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.750\nWe need to learn some things,\n\n74\n00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.330\nwe need to reinforce some things\nwe learned from foundation class.\n\n75\n00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.770\nAs well as prepare for an exam, and\nthey are kind of separate things.\n\n76\n00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.055\nWe're marching toward both goals.\n\n77\n00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:57.400\nSo the qualification scheme, putting\nthis in the context of ITIL at large.\n\n78\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.960\nAll right, first a little level setting.\n\n79\n00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.320\nI am an accredited trainer.\n\n80\n00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.650\nI am working for an accredited training\norganization in PassionIT Group,\n\n81\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.610\nand by accredited,\nthat means we've gone through\n\n82\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.510\nrigorous review of our course\nmaterial at the PassionIT Group.\n\n83\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.080\nAnd, I am certified to teach this because\nof my review with PassionIT Group.\n\n84\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.110\nAll this really means is that,\nat the end of this training If you want to\n\n85\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.790\ntake the exam, you need to also show\nthat you had the accredited training.\n\n86\n00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.440\nWe are credited making it all nice and\nneat.\n\n87\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.500\n&gt;&gt; That's always nice cuz a lot\nof certification vendors do that.\n\n88\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.160\nThey require you to take\nthe official certified type training\n\n89\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.620\nbefore you can actually sit the exam.\n\n90\n00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.240\nSo it's cool that you guys come\nfrom a group that facilitates that\n\n91\n00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.880\nthrough that and\nof course now through ITProTV.\n\n92\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.097\nI'm starting to sound\nlike a commercial now.\n\n93\n00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:51.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's good stuff though.\n\n94\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.500\nThis just means that not only is ITProTV\ntrying to do it the right way the They're\n\n95\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.610\nfinding the organizations that know the\nright way because they've been accredited.\n\n96\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.135\nSo that's what we're here for,\nto do it the right way and teach you well.\n\n97\n00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:08.800\nOkay, so this is kind of a busy slide but\n\n98\n00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.660\nit does show along the left there in\nthe green are a few courses you can take.\n\n99\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.190\nAlong the right in the blue\nalso courses you can take.\n\n100\n00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.490\nYou will have had\nITIL Foundation perhaps already.\n\n101\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.550\nYou certainly needed to\nhave that as a prerequisite\n\n102\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.030\nbefore you can set the exams\nat the intermediate level.\n\n103\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.240\nThere's another course offered\ncalled ITIL Practitioner.\n\n104\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.720\nIt is not a prerequisite to take\nthe other intermediate courses.\n\n105\n00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.790\nI highly recommend it.\n\n106\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.970\nIt's just not a prerequisite,\njust to be clear about that.\n\n107\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.660\nFoundation is, practitioner's not.\n\n108\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.090\nNow if you want to achieve ITIL Expert.\n\n109\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.010\nYou see that up near the top\nof this little house.\n\n110\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.800\nYou need to amass 22 credits.\n\n111\n00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.980\nTwo of which must be ITIL Foundation.\n\n112\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.070\nOnce you find enough credits,\n\n113\n00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.080\nyou're eligible to take\nManagement Across the Lifecycle.\n\n114\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.100\nYou see that across the eve of this house,\nright, in light green there,\n\n115\n00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.740\nManaging Across the Lifecycle.\n\n116\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.420\nThat's worth five credits.\n\n117\n00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.010\nYou can't take Managing Across\nthe Lifecycle,\n\n118\n00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.980\nMALC, until you have at least 17 credits.\n\n119\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.500\nSo two from foundation,\ngo find 15 more from either or both sides.\n\n120\n00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.500\nThe green here, the lifecycle modules.\n\n121\n00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.210\nOr the light blue the capability modules.\n\n122\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.440\nAnd once you have 22 credits,\nI'm sorry 17 credits yours will take\n\n123\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.410\nthe MALC exam giving you five that totals\n22 that gives your expert credential.\n\n124\n00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.760\nTo be an accredited trainer I\nmust hold the expert credential.\n\n125\n00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.030\nSo that's a requirement for the ATO to\nhire only experts to teach these courses.\n\n126\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.240\nI am officially an ITIL expert and\n\n127\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.640\nI have had all these exams from\nfoundation practitioner and\n\n128\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.340\nall the life-cycle and capabilities\nover my years of experience, okay.\n\n129\n00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.170\nThe ITIL Master at the top\nis a rare certification.\n\n130\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.890\nBy rare, there's not so\n\n131\n00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.859\nmany people seeking it and\nthere's not many in the marketplace.\n\n132\n00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.950\nIt's somewhat difficult to get.\n\n133\n00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.030\nYou need to provide a thesis,\nwhat amounts to a thesis, a well\n\n134\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.550\nwritten paper with plenty of graphics,\nalong with a check for about $5,000.\n\n135\n00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.030\nYou send that on to\nthe accrediting agencies.\n\n136\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.870\nThey review and grade it so to speak.\n\n137\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.670\nAnd if you pass muster with that first\npass, then you can become an ITIL master.\n\n138\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.480\nIf not, you can make the suggested\namendments, re-argue it, and\n\n139\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.510\nthen present them another check for\n$5,000 along with your papers.\n\n140\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.440\nSo it's kind of intertive in that respect\nunless you get it right the first time.\n\n141\n00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.810\nIt needs to be practical though.\n\n142\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.390\nThe ITL master certification is one that\nrequires that you're actually practicing\n\n143\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.110\nITIL at these levels, at an expert level,\nto get that certification.\n\n144\n00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.685\nSo it's not really sought after in the\nmarketplace a whole lot, and it is kind\n\n145\n00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:02.373\nof expensive, so it's not one of those\ncertifications that's very popular.\n\n146\n00:08:04.973 --> 00:08:05.797\nAll right.\n\n147\n00:08:05.797 --> 00:08:09.570\nSo let's look at a little bit more\ndetail about these courses, right?\n\n148\n00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.130\nFirst of all, we've got ITIL Foundation.\n\n149\n00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.260\nAgain, it is a foundational course.\n\n150\n00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.460\nIt's one that you must\nhave to be qualified\n\n151\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.490\nto sit the intermediate exams, right?\n\n152\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.120\nThey won't give you that\nintermediate certificate\n\n153\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.140\nunless you already have\nfoundation certificate.\n\n154\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.730\nSo it is prerequisite,\nnot just a nice to have, right.\n\n155\n00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:31.240\nAnd then they've kind of broken it\ndown into two groups of courses,\n\n156\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.200\nthe lifecycle courses and\nthe capability courses.\n\n157\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.920\nThe lifecycle courses,\n\n158\n00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.710\nthey just they align right with\nthe five books in the ITIL library.\n\n159\n00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.100\nSo they are quite channeled or siloed.\n\n160\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.737\nService strategy, service design, service\ntransition, service operations, and\n\n161\n00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.630\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n162\n00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.260\nThose exactly map to\nthe five core publications.\n\n163\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.370\nAll the syllabus topics come\nfrom each of those books, for\n\n164\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.560\neach of those exams, a one to one mapping.\n\n165\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.550\nWhen you get to\nthe capability side though,\n\n166\n00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.860\nyou're looking at how these\nare practically played out.\n\n167\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:13.470\nThey go just a little bit deeper into\nthe activities of the resident processes.\n\n168\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.010\nAnd they also group them\nin logical combinations.\n\n169\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.120\nFor instance, service offerings and\nagreements blend some\n\n170\n00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.790\nfrom service strategy and\nservice design as an example, right?\n\n171\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.938\nPlanning protection optimization\ntakes some from service design and\n\n172\n00:09:29.938 --> 00:09:31.440\nservice transition.\n\n173\n00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.470\nSo you get some mixture of the book,\nof the syllabus topics as well, right?\n\n174\n00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.310\nAnd of course, Managing Across\nthe Lifecycle is the capstone.\n\n175\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.200\nOnce you have at least 17\ncredits from those other ones,\n\n176\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.620\nManaging Across the Lifecycle\nis the one you take at the end.\n\n177\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.590\nOnce you've amassed all these credits and\ndone your good studies and\n\n178\n00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.138\nit puts a cherry on top and\ngets you that expert cert.\n\n179\n00:09:53.138 --> 00:09:57.510\nOkay, very good.\n\n180\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.730\nNow this exam, again,\nif you haven't had an intermediate exam,\n\n181\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.850\nyou'll find that it's\ncertainly a different animal.\n\n182\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:07.120\nThe foundation exam was rote memorization\nand some conceptual awareness.\n\n183\n00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.580\nThat's what the categories were,\nand there were 40 questions.\n\n184\n00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.390\nMultiple choice, and\nyou had to get the correct answer.\n\n185\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.770\nThere was only one correct answer, right?\n\n186\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.930\nFor the intermediate level there's\nonly eight questions, right?\n\n187\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.830\nSo it's narrower margin of error for\n\n188\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.770\nsure and these questions\nalso have gradient scoring.\n\n189\n00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.910\nThere's not one right answer.\n\n190\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.230\nThere is three answers\nthat have some merit.\n\n191\n00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.980\nYou just gotta find the best one.\n\n192\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.470\nSo if you find the best one,\nyou get five points.\n\n193\n00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.620\nIf it's the second best one,\nyou get three.\n\n194\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.860\nThe third best, you get one.\n\n195\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.570\nOf course if you find the worst answer of\nall you get zero credit for it, right?\n\n196\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.970\nSo if there's eight questions, the max you\ncan get on each of those eight questions\n\n197\n00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.980\nis five points,\nthen the maximum amount you can get is 40.\n\n198\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.210\nThat would be a perfect score.\n\n199\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:11:00.560\nTo pass, you have to get 28 points\nout of those 40, so 70%, right.\n\n200\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.070\nIf you do the math on that\nthat means you could have two\n\n201\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:10.000\nfive pointers, and six three pointers.\n\n202\n00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.355\nSix times three is 18,\nplus the two five answers.\n\n203\n00:11:14.355 --> 00:11:16.101\nTen that gives you 28 so\n\n204\n00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:20.684\nyou see that you don't have to be\nnear perfect to get these right.\n\n205\n00:11:20.684 --> 00:11:22.523\nBut if you already get a one or\n\n206\n00:11:22.523 --> 00:11:27.880\na zero then obviously you'll need to\nfind other perfect five answers goes up.\n\n207\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.620\nYou need to get,\nto do the math right, right.\n\n208\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.660\nSo a great way to approach exam\nprep Is to make sure you get very,\n\n209\n00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.620\nvery good at getting rid of the ones and\nzeroes, right.\n\n210\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.351\nIf you get really good at getting rid of\nthe those detractors then you're operating\n\n211\n00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:45.550\nin this will have some success fives and\nthrees.\n\n212\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.809\nOf course it would be\ngreat to achieve a 100%,\n\n213\n00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:52.701\nI find it rare that students\ndon't usually back 100%.\n\n214\n00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:56.790\nThey pass maybe comfortably,\nbut 100% is kinda rare.\n\n215\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.540\nI myself have taken all the exams and\nonly gotten one 100% one, right?\n\n216\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.410\nSo being transparent there.\n\n217\n00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.890\nA student just last week though, for\nthis course, OSA, happened to report 100%.\n\n218\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.080\nAnd that's the first time\na student's ever reported one.\n\n219\n00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.060\nSo certainly possible.\n\n220\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.590\nThat's also a testing for\nthe challenge here, right.\n\n221\n00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:22.230\nIt is a challenging exam but\ncertainly within your wheel house.\n\n222\n00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.713\nYou can get this, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.275\nAll right, so there's many things\nthat are gonna help you prepare.\n\n224\n00:12:31.275 --> 00:12:34.845\nI'm certainly gonna be giving lots\nof lecture and lots of examples, and\n\n225\n00:12:34.845 --> 00:12:36.385\nwe'll do those so in a methodical way.\n\n226\n00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:39.245\nBut there's other resources available for\nyou, and take a look here and\n\n227\n00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:41.135\nthe top of your screen.\n\n228\n00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:43.605\nThere's an opportunity\nto download a .ZIP file.\n\n229\n00:12:43.605 --> 00:12:48.325\nAnd inside that .ZIP file are very\nimportant downloads, case study and\n\n230\n00:12:48.325 --> 00:12:51.860\nexercise, these practice exams,\nvery valuable.\n\n231\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.790\nA glossary, right.\n\n232\n00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.197\nOther resources are the discussion forum,\n\n233\n00:12:56.197 --> 00:12:59.329\nthat you can take through\nITProTV as a subscriber there.\n\n234\n00:12:59.329 --> 00:13:00.650\nYou get access to a forum.\n\n235\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.660\nYou can post questions,\nhave discussions, work those out.\n\n236\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.010\nYou can also get discount exam\nvouchers from PassionIT Group.\n\n237\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.879\nSo when you're ready for the exam,\nreach out to PassionIT Group and\n\n238\n00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:15.620\nget a discount on your voucher there.\n\n239\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.250\nAlso, other materials.\n\n240\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.620\nThere is pocket guides, the official\ncurriculum published by the accrediting\n\n241\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.368\nagencies and xlos, or\nyou can get access to those as well, okay.\n\n242\n00:13:26.368 --> 00:13:27.920\nAll right.\n\n243\n00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:29.680\nVery good.\n\n244\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.490\nNow, what's next is going to be some\nrefresher of the foundation exam or\n\n245\n00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.170\nthe course.\n\n246\n00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.208\nWe'll take that up on after we\ncome back for the next episode.\n\n247\n00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:42.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, thanks so\nmuch for guiding us through what we\n\n248\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:47.080\ncan expect when it comes to the exam and\nsome of the topics we're gonna talk about.\n\n249\n00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.870\nAnd how we might want to prepare for\nthat very thing.\n\n250\n00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:54.260\nObviously, having that download is gonna\nbe very crucial for you as the student so\n\n251\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.100\nthat you have every key piece\nof information necessary so\n\n252\n00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.220\nthat you are successful when\nit comes to passing the OSA.\n\n253\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.800\nWe do look forward to seeing\nthat foundation overview.\n\n254\n00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.220\nMaking sure that we're again,\nmaybe you've forgotten a few things, so\n\n255\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.890\nwe're gonna do that in the next episode.\n\n256\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.290\nThanks so much for dropping by Terry,\nand we thank you all for watching, but\n\n257\n00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.480\nit's that time for us to sign off.\n\n258\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.190\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n259\n00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.350\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n260\n00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.434\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n261\n00:14:19.434 -->

00:00:08.240\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.935\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:13.668\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone,\n\n6\n00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:16.880\nand welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.390\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n8\n00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.640\nwe're continuing on with\nmore on our ITIL OSA series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.600\nAnd of course, joining us back in\nthe studio is the person, well,\n\n10\n00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.800\nwho has mastered these various concepts,\nso that we might master them ourselves and\n\n11\n00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.650\ninfiltrate that knowledge into our brains,\nis our good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n12\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.318\nTerry, welcome back, sir,\nwe're so glad to have you today.\n\n13\n00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:38.726\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Daniel,\nhappy to be here, as always.\n\n14\n00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:43.390\nWhat we'll start with today is a review.\n\n15\n00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.890\nIt's gonna be looking at the service life\ncycle, and we're gonna be picking up on\n\n16\n00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.290\nthose words and\nconcepts that we learned in Foundation.\n\n17\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.540\nThese same words and\nconcepts are gonna be assumed, right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.260\nAs you take the intermediate exam,\n\n19\n00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.960\nthey assume you know these things and\ncan apply them.\n\n20\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.820\nSo, they use the language, they use\nthe words, they apply the concepts.\n\n21\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.730\nYou need to analyze and\napply them as well.\n\n22\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.600\nSo, we're gonna do a good review.\n\n23\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600\n&gt;&gt; That's a good assumption too,\nbecause, at this point,\n\n24\n00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.820\nyou must have passed this exam, correct?\n\n25\n00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.140\n&gt;&gt; That's correct, it's a prerequisite.\n\n26\n00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.270\nSo, I mean,\nthis is a little bit of overreach.\n\n27\n00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.690\nBut it's like we're gonna do\nFoundation in about 30 minutes,\n\n28\n00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.780\nthat entire course in about 30 minutes.\n\n29\n00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.170\nCuz it's gonna be a rapid fire review\nof all those concepts we learned in\n\n30\n00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.900\nFoundation from start to finish,\nfrom strategy through CSI.\n\n31\n00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Well, this ought to be a brutal\nforay back into Foundation.\n\n32\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.650\nSo, we thought we were done with it.\n\n33\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.680\nAnd Terry says not.\n\n34\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.292\nJust when you thought the nightmare\nwas over, we're back for more.\n\n35\n00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:40.676\nAll right, well,\nturn your brains on, receive, and\n\n36\n00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:42.892\nTerry, just take it away good sir.\n\n37\n00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:47.564\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll begin by looking at,\nif you take a look at the slide here,\n\n38\n00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:52.163\nwe'll take a look at these five stages\nof life cycle in fairly short order,\n\n39\n00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:56.240\nservice strategy through\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n40\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.070\nAnd all those in between service design,\nservice transition and\n\n41\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.000\nservice operation, all right?\n\n42\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.320\nThese are the five core\npublications published by ITIL.\n\n43\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.210\nThese core publications are reinforced\nwith complimentary guidance on specific\n\n44\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.880\nindustry sectors, interactions, and\ninterfaces with other best practices, etc.\n\n45\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.000\nBut these five core form the basis\nof the best practice, known as ITIL.\n\n46\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.130\nAnd we're gonna be spending a lot of\ntime in service operations this week,\n\n47\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.350\nI'm sorry, with this show,\nand have a look here.\n\n48\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.260\nSo, these are the kind of processes\nthat show up in each of the five stages.\n\n49\n00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.180\nRight, and again,\nour wheelhouse coming through this week\n\n50\n00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.180\nis going to be through service operations,\nand continued service improvement.\n\n51\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.960\nSo, as you look in this area down here,\n\n52\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.660\nthese are the process we're\ngoing to be discussing.\n\n53\n00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.860\nAnd the methodology in the seven step\nimprovement process is going to be\n\n54\n00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.400\nlayered on top of those, as we learn.\n\n55\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.120\n&gt;&gt; So,\nare we kinda taking that service operation\n\n56\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.330\nportion of the foundation exams and\nexpanding on that?\n\n57\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.310\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nwe're gonna look at it more in depth.\n\n58\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.357\nLook a little bit deeper at the\nactivities, and honestly, what you got in\n\n59\n00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:11.419\nfoundation was a very firm foundation\nof what service operation is like.\n\n60\n00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.593\nWe're just gonna add to that foundation,\nand\n\n61\n00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:16.111\nhopefully apply that\nknowledge in meaningful ways.\n\n62\n00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:20.200\nAll right, so I love this graphic.\n\n63\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.350\nIt is very illustrative of just\nhow this whole framework operates.\n\n64\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.770\nIf you look at the center here,\nof course, we got ITL in the center.\n\n65\n00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.810\nI think one thing I'd do to maybe make\nthis a little bit better is I'd make ITL\n\n66\n00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.270\nthe word customer.\n\n67\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.560\nBecause everything should revolve\naround the customer, right?\n\n68\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.520\nBut as you see,\nservice strategy as it turns,\n\n69\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.260\nit turns these other stages as well,\nright?\n\n70\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.380\nSo, it turns service design.\n\n71\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.650\nTurns service design, and\nwraps around with service transition,\n\n72\n00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.910\nand then eventually to service operation.\n\n73\n00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.780\nAnother common graphical approach\nto explaining this framework\n\n74\n00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.280\nis more of a cascade where\nService Strategy tells design what to do.\n\n75\n00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.960\nDesign sets the stage for transition,\n\n76\n00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.690\nand then transition brings\nthings into operation.\n\n77\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.920\nSo, that's also a meaningful\nway to look at this.\n\n78\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.430\nBut I like this,\nbecause it implies this drive in nature.\n\n79\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.000\nIf you put the customer at\nthe center of all this universe,\n\n80\n00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.620\nthat it drives strategy.\n\n81\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.950\nStrategy drives the other stages.\n\n82\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.610\nI also like it because CSI,\nContinual Service Improvement Is wrapped\n\n83\n00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.520\naround the wheel as points of leverage,\nright?\n\n84\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.900\nSo, if you have a culture of continually\nimproving what you're doing,\n\n85\n00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.320\nyou can drive improvements\nacross all these stages, right?\n\n86\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.080\nAnd I like it also, because it implies\nthat these things are integrated.\n\n87\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.880\nThese stages don't stand on\nan island all by themselves,\n\n88\n00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.740\nthey intend to work together.\n\n89\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.750\nAnd then of course, you see the external\npressures around this particular concept.\n\n90\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.180\nRegulatory challenges,\nstandards, knowledge and\n\n91\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.545\nskill fills specialized topics technology,\ncustomer needs, etc.\n\n92\n00:04:57.545 --> 00:05:02.235\nSo, that also plays into it,\nbut as a whole,\n\n93\n00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:05.725\nyou need to consider this framework\nis intended to work together, and\n\n94\n00:05:05.725 --> 00:05:10.295\nit's driven through customer and\nstrategic alignment, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:15.290\nSo, this idea of service,\nyou may recall this from Foundation.\n\n96\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.510\nNot that you'll have to memorize this for\nthe exam, but\n\n97\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.810\nI do want to reinforce some key words,\nin fact, that are capitalized here.\n\n98\n00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.900\nWhat is a SERVICE?\n\n99\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.340\nA means of delivering VALUE to CUSTOMERS,\nright?\n\n100\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.910\nAnd being capitalized is purposeful here,\n\n101\n00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.550\nin that if you focus on value to\ncustomers, you will be more successful.\n\n102\n00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.640\nThat's what the best practice preaches,\nso to speak.\n\n103\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.000\nNow, as an exam taker,\nyou can also find some good clues here.\n\n104\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.270\nIf there's four answers, and\n\n105\n00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.250\none of them is customer focused,\nand the other three aren't,\n\n106\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.670\nchances are the one that has a customer\nfocus is going to be the better answer.\n\n107\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.740\nI call it the nine tenths rule.\n\n108\n00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.200\nNine times out of ten,\nif an answer focuses on the customer, and\n\n109\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.015\nthe other three don't,\nthen it's probably the right answer.\n\n110\n00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:15.555\nThe same with the word value,\nvalue versus solutions or systems.\n\n111\n00:06:15.555 --> 00:06:17.105\nSure, that's what IT delivers.\n\n112\n00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:21.615\nThey use services and\nsystems and solutions.\n\n113\n00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.845\nIT brings that to customers, but\n\n114\n00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:27.283\nthey need to bring value,\nnot just the solution themselves.\n\n115\n00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:31.930\nRight, all right, so, Service Management\n\n116\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.200\nis a capability to deliver\nvalue through services.\n\n117\n00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.010\nSo, it's kind of a snake\neating its own tail.\n\n118\n00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.420\nIf a service is a means to delivering\nvalue, Service Management is a capability\n\n119\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.980\nof delivering value through services\nwhich is a mean to delivering value so\n\n120\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.200\nIt's kind of a circular reference.\n\n121\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.522\nDeveloping Service Management means\nyour developing a capability,\n\n122\n00:06:56.522 --> 00:07:00.524\nand ITIL provides a framework for\nevolving that capability, right?\n\n123\n00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:05.093\nAnd of course IT Service Management is\nto deliver the same sorts of value and\n\n124\n00:07:05.093 --> 00:07:07.204\ncapability through IT services.\n\n125\n00:07:07.204 --> 00:07:10.598\nYou're making sure that you're delivering\nthe right services to the right customers\n\n126\n00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:12.568\nat the right cost,\nat acceptable levels of risk.\n\n127\n00:07:12.568 --> 00:07:16.580\nOkay, all right,\n\n128\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.040\nITIL describes service providers,\ninternal, shared services, and external.\n\n129\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.400\nJust a reminder,\nwhat we learned from Foundation.\n\n130\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.560\nAn internal service provider is\nembedded with the business unit itself.\n\n131\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.051\nA shared service unit is also\nwithin the same organization, but\n\n132\n00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:37.550\nprovides centralized services\nconsumed by all the business units.\n\n133\n00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.460\nAs an example, I've in environments\nwhere the research and\n\n134\n00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.030\ndevelopment division had\nthere own IT department.\n\n135\n00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.700\nThe manufacturing division\nhave their own IT department.\n\n136\n00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.757\nThat would be in ITO terms,\ninternal service provider.\n\n137\n00:07:50.757 --> 00:07:55.463\nThat same organization had shared services\nproviding email, Internet portal,\n\n138\n00:07:55.463 --> 00:07:56.828\ndocument management,\n\n139\n00:07:56.828 --> 00:08:01.755\nlearning management services that were\nconsumed by all the business units, right?\n\n140\n00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:04.246\nSo Type I and Type II are both internal.\n\n141\n00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:06.480\nOne embedded in the business,\none centralized.\n\n142\n00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.923\nIn a Type III environment, search\nprovider is an external service provider.\n\n143\n00:08:11.923 --> 00:08:15.764\nAnd organization that provides\nIT services to customers outside\n\n144\n00:08:15.764 --> 00:08:17.950\nthe organization, right.\n\n145\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.800\nNow while it's important to note these\ndistinctions it's also important to know\n\n146\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.530\nthat in many ways there\nare distinctions without a difference.\n\n147\n00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.310\nThe principles of ITIL,\n\n148\n00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:33.440\nthe best practice of ITIL if you will\napplies to all types of providers.\n\n149\n00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.670\nAnd that's one of the design principles\nof ITIL is that they wanna be able to\n\n150\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.660\nmake these best practices\napplicable to varying sizes\n\n151\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.510\nbearing types of organizations, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.880\nStakeholders, another reinforcement of\n\n153\n00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.090\nwho you need to care about\nin an IP service provider.\n\n154\n00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.850\nCertainly, you take care of yourself.\n\n155\n00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.610\nYou may have heard the phrase,\nthe cobbler's kids have no shoes, right?\n\n156\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.300\nWell, we need to have shoes too, right?\n\n157\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.690\nSo you need tot take care of yourself.\n\n158\n00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.930\nAnd a lot of these process not\nonly build good fences and\n\n159\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.040\ngood neighbors with the customers,\nbut they build good fences and\n\n160\n00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.630\ngood neighbors within the IT\norganization as well.\n\n161\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.140\nSo take care of yourselves\nas a service provider.\n\n162\n00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.210\nOf course, the customers and\nthe users are also stakeholders.\n\n163\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.580\nAnd suppliers,\n\n164\n00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.330\nthose third party organizations that\nhelp you deliver your services.\n\n165\n00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.060\nIt's hard for me to imagine an IT\nservice provider in this day and\n\n166\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.060\nage that doesn't somehow\nrely on a supplier.\n\n167\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.960\nSomeone outside the same organization.\n\n168\n00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.500\nWhether it's software, hardware,\nequipment or development services, right?\n\n169\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.160\nThere is very few standalone\nIT service providers if any\n\n170\n00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.250\nthat doesn't somehow rely\non some other supplier.\n\n171\n00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.720\nNow I think let's also remember the\ndistinction between a customer and a user.\n\n172\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.690\nThey are not necessarily the same.\n\n173\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.790\nDaniel do you recall perhaps the potential\ndifference between a customer of\n\n174\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:03.210\na service at a large organization, let's\nsay and the users of that same service.\n\n175\n00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.930\nJust take email, perhaps as an example.\n\n176\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.350\nJust imagine a large organization.\n\n177\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.272\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] The customer and\nthe user of the email.\n\n178\n00:10:12.272 --> 00:10:15.624\nSo I assume that the customer,\nand email as the service.\n\n179\n00:10:15.624 --> 00:10:16.596\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n180\n00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:17.409\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n181\n00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:18.064\n&gt;&gt; Kind of put you on the spot.\n\n182\n00:10:18.064 --> 00:10:18.755\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n183\n00:10:18.755 --> 00:10:21.854\nyou bring up a really good point here\nbecause we're talking about exam\n\n184\n00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:23.704\nfoundation, from the foundation exam.\n\n185\n00:10:23.704 --> 00:10:24.271\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n186\n00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:26.656\n&gt;&gt; And things we did and\nI totally do not remember the difference.\n\n187\n00:10:26.656 --> 00:10:27.360\n&gt;&gt; Totally fine.\n\n188\n00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.456\n&gt;&gt; I'm so glad we're doing this.\n\n189\n00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:29.386\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n190\n00:10:29.386 --> 00:10:30.712\nthat's why we do it, that's why we do it.\n\n191\n00:10:30.712 --> 00:10:31.848\nThank you.\n\n192\n00:10:31.848 --> 00:10:38.550\nA customer is the entity, or\ngroup of people, that pay for the service.\n\n193\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.570\nAnd the users are the one that use it.\n\n194\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.920\nThey can be different.\n\n195\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.860\nIn corporate environments it's not\nunusual for instance the sponsor\n\n196\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.900\nof learning of management or the sponsor\nfor email, who's going to pay for that?\n\n197\n00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.879\nSomeone owns the budget to say yes,\nwe want to have that type of service.\n\n198\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.423\nWhoever owns the budget and\n\n199\n00:10:58.423 --> 00:11:01.366\nis accountable for\nthe spending on that becomes the customer.\n\n200\n00:11:01.366 --> 00:11:04.870\nAnd yet everyone on the organization\nmight actually use it, right?\n\n201\n00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.580\nFrom my own experience as an example,\nthe warning management system or\n\n202\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.140\nservice was under the remit\nof the HR department.\n\n203\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.930\nThey are the responsible\norganization development,\n\n204\n00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.330\nmaking sure the right people get trained,\ntraining standards etc.\n\n205\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:22.360\nSo HR had the governance and the remit\n\n206\n00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.970\nto say make this learning management\nsystem reach our corporate goals, right?\n\n207\n00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.770\nThey were the customer, HR Department.\n\n208\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.990\nThey sponsored it, they held the budget,\nthey made sure the appropriate utility and\n\n209\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.110\nwarranty was built in, right?\n\n210\n00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.560\nHowever, everyone in\nthe organization used it.\n\n211\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.490\nSo users and\ncustomers are different stakeholders.\n\n212\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.030\nAnd they have different\nstakes in the game.\n\n213\n00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.510\nA customer,\nI mean this is oversimplification but\n\n214\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.770\ncustomers tend to want it fast and cheap.\n\n215\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.850\nWhereas users want it to be really,\nreally good.\n\n216\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.710\nIntuitive, easy to use, stays out of\ntheir way, right, those kind of things.\n\n217\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.780\nSo they have different stakes in the game,\n\n218\n00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.970\nas an IT service provider you\nneed to manage those stakes.\n\n219\n00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.020\nNeed to make sure they\nare holistically considered, right?\n\n220\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.850\nThere is gonna be probably some give and\ntake in that conversation but\n\n221\n00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:11.902\nunderstand this stakeholder is fundamental\nbasis for managing those gaps, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:11.902 --> 00:12:16.510\nAll right, three types of services,\n\n223\n00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:21.530\nwe mentioned the type of service providers\nearlier was internal, shared and external.\n\n224\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:26.380\nThree types of services are supporting\nservices, internal services, or\n\n225\n00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.040\nexternal services, all right.\n\n226\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.220\nBasically, it's just flipping it around,\n\n227\n00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.530\ntalking about the types of\nservices that can be right.\n\n228\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.320\nConsider email.\n\n229\n00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.130\nEmail is customer facing.\n\n230\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.050\nPeople use email directly.\n\n231\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.620\nWhat's underneath that though could\nbe Identity Management Services.\n\n232\n00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.890\nHow do you manage people log in?\n\n233\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.850\nHow do you get them access to the database\nin the servers that they need?\n\n234\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.490\nSo things go on in the backend\nthat make that service successful.\n\n235\n00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.650\nSo Supporting Services are a big\npart of that, all right?\n\n236\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:05.210\nThis is just a graphic example of how\nan IT provider could be both internal,\n\n237\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.130\nexternal at different times.\n\n238\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.550\nThey could have direct interface\nwith users or customers.\n\n239\n00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.610\nOr there could be some other\nintermediate step between them, right.\n\n240\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.460\nYou see here that the business\nunit is doing some things that has\n\n241\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.460\ntheir internal customers, and\nIT supports them directly\n\n242\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.340\nwhile the business units support Their\ncustomers whether outside or inside.\n\n243\n00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.950\nYou also may recall to\nthe foundation course that there\n\n244\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:36.670\nare ways to analyze services\nas core enabling or enhancing.\n\n245\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.520\nSo a core service everyone gets it.\n\n246\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.200\nEveryone should have it.\n\n247\n00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.750\nFor instance an email as an example when\nwe went into our Exchange environment for\n\n248\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:52.000\nthe first time many years ago,\ncore functionality was email\n\n249\n00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.130\nwhich included calendaring and everyone\nhad Outlook installed on their desktop so\n\n250\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.890\nthey could have that type of service,\nright?\n\n251\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:03.520\nIn enhancing service,\nskipping over enabling this for a minute.\n\n252\n00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.000\nIn enhancing service was mobile messaging,\nright?\n\n253\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.870\nSo not everyone at our organization got\nthe ability to have mobile messaging,\n\n254\n00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.270\nmessaging on their phone, we were\nconcerned about the security models,\n\n255\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.750\nwe were concerned about the device\nintegrity various things like that.\n\n256\n00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.400\nWe weren't quite ready to do that.\n\n257\n00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.540\nWe hadn't fully vetted it yet.\n\n258\n00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.400\nThere was, part of the organization,\n\n259\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.990\nthe sales organization,\nhad a high need for it.\n\n260\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.620\nSo with certain security\nparameters built in,\n\n261\n00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.570\nyou must have a Blackberry back in\nthe day, those kinds of things.\n\n262\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:38.050\nWe allowed the, sales team to get\nan enhancing service, mobile messaging.\n\n263\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.310\n&gt;&gt; So it just took that core service and\nadded some functionality to it,\n\n264\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.490\nmaking it better or at least more\nfunctional in that environment.\n\n265\n00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.440\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nyou can actually use it in a non-IT, well,\n\n266\n00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.490\nit actually is an IT service probably.\n\n267\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.400\nYour cable TV provider,\nprovide you a basic service and for\n\n268\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.130\nadditional money you can have\nsome of this enhancing services.\n\n269\n00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.650\nMaybe a DVR maybe access to NFL.\n\n270\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.860\nThat works and that whole thing.\n\n271\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.490\nSo enhancing service usually comes at some\nsort of additional cost or risk, right.\n\n272\n00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.660\nAnd they also tend to\nincorporate biomes and\n\n273\n00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.080\nhave some services tend\nto move towards core.\n\n274\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.210\nOver time, right?\n\n275\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.650\nBecause people expect it, you get good at\nit, you get the economies of scale down.\n\n276\n00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.310\nAnd you work your security issues out and\nmake those things happen.\n\n277\n00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:31.360\nSo core and enabling is really just\nabout how widespread the service is.\n\n278\n00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.034\nCore, everyone gets it, enhancing,\nprobably some subset of everyone, right?\n\n279\n00:15:36.034 --> 00:15:40.380\nNow an enabling service is akin to\na supporting service, it's in the backend.\n\n280\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.920\nIt makes this possible.\n\n281\n00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.650\nStaying with the email service.\n\n282\n00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:48.227\nMessage is something directly\nconsumed by the users, right?\n\n283\n00:15:48.227 --> 00:15:52.798\nBut one what makes email work are network\nservices, perhaps database services,\n\n284\n00:15:52.798 --> 00:15:55.713\nserver services,\nidentity management services,\n\n285\n00:15:55.713 --> 00:15:59.640\nmaybe web services if you consider\nweb email, those types of things.\n\n286\n00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.898\nSo those enabling services are underneath\nthe hood, not directly viewable by or\n\n287\n00:16:04.898 --> 00:16:09.960\nconsumable by the customers and\nusers, but certainly critical.\n\n288\n00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.270\nAs we talked about service providers\nearlier, internal, shared and\n\n289\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.240\nexternal, we described them as being\na distinction without a difference.\n\n290\n00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.090\nThat kind of plays out here too.\n\n291\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.650\nThe principles of ITIL,\nthe best practice of ITIL.\n\n292\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.930\nNeed to be played out and\nevaluated as they relate to all three\n\n293\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.580\ntypes of services here, core,\nenabling, and enhancing.\n\n294\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:36.232\nThey all can benefit from a firm\nfoundation and a firm framework.\n\n295\n00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:41.009\nVocabulary check.\n\n296\n00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:43.040\nUtility warranty.\n\n297\n00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.440\nAs you can see here, utility equals fit\nfor purpose, warranty equals fit for use.\n\n298\n00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.690\nUtility is the functionality\nthat you're trying to\n\n299\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.220\nmake happen on behalf of the user.\n\n300\n00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.919\nWhat does email allow a person to do?\n\n301\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.610\nIf you're old enough to\nremember the days before email,\n\n302\n00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.100\nyou might remember official memorandum,\nright?\n\n303\n00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.110\nPapers going into physical inboxes and\noutboxes.\n\n304\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:08.150\nSo if you think about that,\nthe utility of email was to\n\n305\n00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.540\nmake electronic communication a lot\nmore efficient, effective, right?\n\n306\n00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.900\nSo you're providing some sort of\nperformance enhancement with your service.\n\n307\n00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.700\nOr you're removing some\nsort of constraint.\n\n308\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.490\nI remember when we first got email,\nit was email in the office.\n\n309\n00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.530\nI could email other people in my building,\nright?\n\n310\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.390\nSo obviously,\nwe removed that constraint of\n\n311\n00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.760\njust the people involved by\nhaving Internet available, right?\n\n312\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.980\nSo that's removing the constraint\nof who you can talk to.\n\n313\n00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.610\nAnd then also where can I do this?\n\n314\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.210\nOnce upon a time I had to be at\nthe office on my company computer\n\n315\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.530\nlogged into that network there.\n\n316\n00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.820\nSo providing additional utility\nallowed me to log in from home.\n\n317\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.835\nAnd of course now we can even\nget get on our phone, right?\n\n318\n00:17:52.835 --> 00:17:55.865\nSo you're moving the constraints\nof where you have to be or\n\n319\n00:17:55.865 --> 00:17:58.125\nhow you have to engage with this service.\n\n320\n00:17:58.125 --> 00:17:59.035\nThat's what utility's about.\n\n321\n00:17:59.035 --> 00:18:01.595\n&gt;&gt; I remember one of the first\ncommercials that came out for,\n\n322\n00:18:01.595 --> 00:18:05.325\nemail's a thing that you can do now and\nit's available for anyone anywhere.\n\n323\n00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:07.785\nAnd it was this guy, and\nhe had met this girl and\n\n324\n00:18:07.785 --> 00:18:09.296\nthey were trying to get the phone number.\n\n325\n00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:10.568\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But instead of the phone number,\n\n326\n00:18:10.568 --> 00:18:11.990\nshe gave him an email address.\n\n327\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.917\nAnd he was looking at it kinda like,\nwhat is this strange caricature?\n\n328\n00:18:14.917 --> 00:18:16.840\n[LAUGH] What's going on here?\n\n329\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.890\nAnd they were, I think it was for\nMicrosoft's email system or something.\n\n330\n00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.804\n&gt;&gt; How about that.\n&gt;&gt; It was really cool.\n\n331\n00:18:21.804 --> 00:18:24.209\nSo there was a time actually before email-\n&gt;&gt; Of course,\n\n332\n00:18:24.209 --> 00:18:27.550\nnow the utility of email\nhas just exploded, right?\n\n333\n00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.220\nIt's not just about sending mail.\n\n334\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.930\nIn some regards,\n\n335\n00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.460\nit's an official repository of\nofficial communications, right.\n\n336\n00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.070\nSo, the utility aspect\nisimportant about a service.\n\n337\n00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.270\nWhat are you allowing people to do, right?\n\n338\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.590\nNow warranty on the other hand,\nis the idea of making sure this\n\n339\n00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.550\nservice is actually available\nwhen people need it, right?\n\n340\n00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.120\nSo it's one thing to\nprovide high functionality.\n\n341\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.990\nIt's another thing to make sure that that\nthe high functionality is available when\n\n342\n00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.180\nit's supposed to be available.\n\n343\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.190\nIt's there and\nperforming as it should, right?\n\n344\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.278\nIs is possible or\ninstance to have a highly utilitarian,\n\n345\n00:19:02.278 --> 00:19:07.399\nin ITIL sense, meaning highly,\nit's got all the bells and whistles.\n\n346\n00:19:07.399 --> 00:19:09.608\nIs it possible to have all the bells and\n\n347\n00:19:09.608 --> 00:19:13.740\nwhistles by delivering a service\nthat fails often, right?\n\n348\n00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.740\nIf it fails often, you're gonna be\nlosing on the value proposition.\n\n349\n00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.990\nThe other could be true.\n\n350\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:25.930\nYou could have a highly available,\npoorly functional service, right?\n\n351\n00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.860\nIt doesn't do something for the users,\nit doesn't let them make better sales or\n\n352\n00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.200\nstreamline their communications or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n353\n00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.510\nSo the idea of utility and warranty\nbeing required to be able to deliver\n\n354\n00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.917\nvalue is fundamental to the framework\nof ITIL, both must be provided.\n\n355\n00:19:49.736 --> 00:19:51.270\nAgain, picking up on the language.\n\n356\n00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.600\nWe gotta remind ourselves there's\na special language of ITIL.\n\n357\n00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.170\nThis idea of of asset.\n\n358\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:00.419\nIn many circles, an asset simply\nmeans something you put a tag on,\n\n359\n00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:06.438\nyou put a depreciation schedule on it and\nyou monitor it as a financial unit.\n\n360\n00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:08.470\nThat's not what ITIL looks for in asset.\n\n361\n00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.783\nAn asset, in ITIL terms,\nis any resource or\n\n362\n00:20:11.783 --> 00:20:16.310\ncapability that lets you deliver service,\nright?\n\n363\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.190\nSo resources and\ncapabilities are what assets are about.\n\n364\n00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.640\nIt's not something you just slap a tag on.\n\n365\n00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.840\nRight, and start monitoring\nas a financial unit, right?\n\n366\n00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.208\nSo, again, minding the language.\n\n367\n00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:33.030\nThese assets exist in two domains.\n\n368\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.890\nIf you recall those, Daniel?\n\n369\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.045\n&gt;&gt; Man,\nyou're really telling me [CROSSTALK]\n\n370\n00:20:38.045 --> 00:20:38.757\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry-\n\n371\n00:20:38.757 --> 00:20:40.573\n&gt;&gt; It's been awhile since I looked at our\n\n372\n00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:41.600\nfoundation series.\n\n373\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.500\nI'll be honest with you.\n\n374\n00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.850\n&gt;&gt; Well here comes a hint.\n\n375\n00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.890\nThere are service assets and\nthere are customer assets, right?\n\n376\n00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:56.760\nDo you have to be a geophysicist to work\nin the IT department of an oil company?\n\n377\n00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.490\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n378\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, do you have to be a lawyer to\nwork in the IT department of a law firm?\n\n379\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.640\n&gt;&gt; No it probably would help, right?\n\n380\n00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.810\n&gt;&gt; Certainly understanding what\nyour customer's trying to get done.\n\n381\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.108\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The deeper you can get in there,\n\n382\n00:21:08.108 --> 00:21:08.722\nthe better you.\n\n383\n00:21:08.722 --> 00:21:09.903\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n384\n00:21:09.903 --> 00:21:15.271\nNot a necessity, in fact you have assets\nas an IT department that they don't have,\n\n385\n00:21:15.271 --> 00:21:18.260\nso they know geophysics or they know law.\n\n386\n00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:18.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n387\n00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.507\n&gt;&gt; But you are an IT person,\nthey don't know those things.\n\n388\n00:21:22.507 --> 00:21:23.309\nRight, so\n\n389\n00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:29.389\neffectively what you're trying to do is\nadd service assets to customer assets.\n\n390\n00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:33.619\nAnd just beyond my point of view,\nto give you the full screen of the slide,\n\n391\n00:21:33.619 --> 00:21:38.420\nif you add service assets to customer\nassets you get to create value.\n\n392\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.930\nOkay, so keeping with the vocabulary\nmarch, what is a process, right?\n\n393\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.440\nAgain, these are words that have\nvery special meaning in ITIL.\n\n394\n00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.970\nA structured set of activities\ndesigned to accomplish a specific\n\n395\n00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.100\nobjective, that's fine.\n\n396\n00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:55.250\nWhat we're gonna be talking about in\nthis show is the five processes and\n\n397\n00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.089\nservice operations and how they can be\nsuccessfully analyzed and operated.\n\n398\n00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.760\nSo operational support and analysis.\n\n399\n00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:09.960\nSo they need to have a connection to\nthe value of delivering to the business.\n\n400\n00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.340\nYou execute these processes\nultimately to streamline,\n\n401\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.610\nto be more cost effective,\nto be well governed.\n\n402\n00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.530\nYou have a regular process you follow.\n\n403\n00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.480\nYou are not just making it up as you go.\n\n404\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.600\nRight, that's effectively what it's doing.\n\n405\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.970\nBut that also has value and\nthat value needs to be intrinsic and\n\n406\n00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.460\nunderstood by all the practitioners\nof the process, right?\n\n407\n00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.330\nSo the process is pretty straightforward.\n\n408\n00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.982\nWe're gonna be talking about\nfive of them in OSA, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:42.851\nNow, process characteristics,\nthey all get started somehow,\n\n410\n00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:47.290\nsomething gets them kicked off,\ntriggered them, right?\n\n411\n00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.050\nAn incident,\nsee if you can remember this one, Daniel.\n\n412\n00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.710\nIs, an incident is when something goes\nawry and you need to respond to it.\n\n413\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.290\nSo that's kinda described the trigger,\nis something's gone awry.\n\n414\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.770\nHow does that manifest in the process?\n\n415\n00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.390\nHow could you learn?\n\n416\n00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.370\nThat it's gone awry?\n\n417\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:09.220\n&gt;&gt; I would assume from like,\ninput from users?\n\n418\n00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.725\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\na user could call the service desk.\n\n419\n00:23:11.725 --> 00:23:13.922\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; And say somethings messed up here.\n\n420\n00:23:13.922 --> 00:23:15.690\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; I can't get on my email.\n\n421\n00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.400\n&gt;&gt; That's probably the typical one.\n\n422\n00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:17.925\n&gt;&gt; So that's that.\n\n423\n00:23:17.925 --> 00:23:20.300\nThat's how the instant management\nprocess can be triggered.\n\n424\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.860\nI can't do this, help me out, right?\n\n425\n00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.950\nIt could be triggered by electronic means,\nmaybe you have monitors in place.\n\n426\n00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.460\n&gt;&gt; The email says the server\nis not responding.\n\n427\n00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the server not responding\nis somehow automatically detected and\n\n428\n00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.880\nit sends an email to\nthe appropriate person or\n\n429\n00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.460\nraises a ticket with the right level\nof severity, that sort of thing.\n\n430\n00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.110\nRight, so you get this idea of triggers.\n\n431\n00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.810\nAll processes have a trigger.\n\n432\n00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:49.490\nWe're gonna talk about the five\nprocesses in service operations.\n\n433\n00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.131\nWe'll certainly be talking about\nhow they get kicked off and\n\n434\n00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.527\nhow they interact with other\nprocesses potentially.\n\n435\n00:23:54.527 --> 00:23:57.818\nSo the nature of a process,\nagain is response to a trigger.\n\n436\n00:23:57.818 --> 00:24:02.953\nIt delivers something identifiable\nin measure to somebody.\n\n437\n00:24:02.953 --> 00:24:04.087\nSo there's the two things.\n\n438\n00:24:04.087 --> 00:24:08.740\nIt delivers something and it delivers\nit's output to a stakeholder but\n\n439\n00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.120\nit's doing so\non behalf of the value to the business.\n\n440\n00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.750\nWhether the value to the business is\nan internal business or external.\n\n441\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.910\nAnd it's also measurable.\n\n442\n00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.190\nWhen you talk about\noperational support and\n\n443\n00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.890\nanalysis you're talking about\nthe measurement of processes.\n\n444\n00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.350\nAre they being effective?\n\n445\n00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.710\nDo they work well?\n\n446\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.940\nHow many do we have, right?\n\n447\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.470\nDid we resolve them quickly?\n\n448\n00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.930\nEtcetera, right.\n\n449\n00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.500\nSo, certainly this concept\nof measuring processes is\n\n450\n00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.590\nbuilt into ITIL measurement is part of\nCSI, continual service improvement.\n\n451\n00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.910\nIt's also part of every single process.\n\n452\n00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:51.590\nSo the caveat here is it says that every\ncharacteristic's process is measurable.\n\n453\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.640\nThe implication is it's measured.\n\n454\n00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.450\nYou go to the trouble of measuring\nthe success of the process.\n\n455\n00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:57.950\nAlright?\n\n456\n00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.910\nNow, a process model is\njust how processes and\n\n457\n00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:06.840\ngovernance map out to business outcomes.\n\n458\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.980\nWhy do you execute a process?\n\n459\n00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.920\nWhy?\n\n460\n00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.250\nIt really answers the question.\n\n461\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.220\nThe process model makes sure you\ngot a good process strategy,\n\n462\n00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.240\nyou have process ownership,\nyou get feedback from the process,\n\n463\n00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.690\ntypically through measurements but\nalso directly.\n\n464\n00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.510\nRight?\nYou can ask the customers did\n\n465\n00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.895\nyou like how we did that?\n\n466\n00:25:24.895 --> 00:25:26.830\nEtcetera.\n\n467\n00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:30.140\nSo this is just a way to remind you\nthat processes themselves don't\n\n468\n00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.760\noperate in a vacuum.\n\n469\n00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.100\nThey have specific focus.\n\n470\n00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.220\nThey have specific stakeholders.\n\n471\n00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.000\nAnd they are governed by policy as well.\n\n472\n00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.970\nIt's one thing to have\na process out there.\n\n473\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.193\nIt's another thing to\nmake sure it's followed.\n\n474\n00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:42.847\nRight.\n\n475\n00:25:42.847 --> 00:25:47.567\nSo the process model is all the things\nin place to make sure it's followed and\n\n476\n00:25:47.567 --> 00:25:49.570\nthat is continually improved.\n\n477\n00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.000\nAlright.\n\n478\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.250\nGood.\n\n479\n00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:58.480\nNow the word function again, taking words\nand giving them a very specific meaning.\n\n480\n00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.680\nA process, a structured set of activities.\n\n481\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.675\nA function a team or group of people\nwith special skills and tools.\n\n482\n00:26:05.675 --> 00:26:09.640\nThat's how I abbreviate this whole-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this long drawn out definition.\n\n483\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.285\n&gt;&gt; It's a group of people with\nspecial skills and tools.\n\n484\n00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:16.400\nITIL is really effective\nat distilling lots of\n\n485\n00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.110\nthe universe of different variables,\ndistilling them down in digestible bits.\n\n486\n00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.847\nITIL suggests you have\nfour groups of people.\n\n487\n00:26:24.847 --> 00:26:27.031\nThat's not an organizational\nchart necessarily.\n\n488\n00:26:27.031 --> 00:26:29.560\nYou're gonna start to organize like this.\n\n489\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.650\nThere can be lots of factors for\norganizational.\n\n490\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.010\nYou could have geographic needs.\n\n491\n00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.740\nYou could have business needs.\n\n492\n00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.580\nThat supersede this\norganizational structure.\n\n493\n00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.000\nBut you need to have these skills in\npeople and these tools to support them.\n\n494\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.690\nRight.\n\n495\n00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.990\nWe're gonna talk in good detail\nabout all four of these.\n\n496\n00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.570\nBut for now,\n\n497\n00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:52.410\njust remember the service desk,\nIT operations, applications management and\n\n498\n00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.460\ntechnical management are the four, and\nonly four, functions defined by ITIL.\n\n499\n00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.370\nWhen we get into the depth\n\n500\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.878\nof the course where we're gonna\nlook at each of these functions.\n\n501\n00:27:02.878 --> 00:27:04.420\nOkay.\n\n502\n00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:09.040\nAny questions?\n\n503\n00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.600\n&gt;&gt; I don't see any hands out there.\n\n504\n00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.125\n&gt;&gt; No\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:27:11.125 --> 00:27:14.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's have\n\n506\n00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:19.880\na look at some roles related to all of\nthese functions and all these processes.\n\n507\n00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.777\nAnd again straight out of the foundation\ncourse, hopefully it's a reminder.\n\n508\n00:27:22.777 --> 00:27:24.530\nRemember the RACI Matrix?\n\n509\n00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:29.860\nIt's a way to define, and\nmap roles to specific activities.\n\n510\n00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.170\nAnd you see the example here, in a matrix.\n\n511\n00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:37.575\nSo it describes not only a role\nmapped to an activity, but\n\n512\n00:27:37.575 --> 00:27:39.950\ntheir level on involvement\nin that activity.\n\n513\n00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:46.730\nSo as this first example shows, you could\nbe the director of service management and\n\n514\n00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:50.830\nbe accountable and responsible for\nactivity one, right?\n\n515\n00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.647\nBut you're only informed on\nactivity three, four, and five.\n\n516\n00:27:53.647 --> 00:27:57.250\nSo you get the idea of what it's trying\nto do, showing your level of involvement.\n\n517\n00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:00.264\nSo if you're the director\nof service management,\n\n518\n00:28:00.264 --> 00:28:05.060\nyou can look at this matrix and see\nwhere you have material interest in it.\n\n519\n00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.850\nWhere you have to do something or not.\n\n520\n00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:08.420\nRight?\n\n521\n00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.860\nAnd of course, doing it holistically\nacross many activities you can get a good\n\n522\n00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.390\nview across the landscape of who's\ndoing what, who's on first, etcetera.\n\n523\n00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.540\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nI love that analogy.\n\n524\n00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.100\nWho's on first.\nYeah.\n\n525\n00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.889\nGreat joke [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who's on first.\n\n526\n00:28:20.889 --> 00:28:21.758\nCorrect.\nYou know what it is.\n\n527\n00:28:21.758 --> 00:28:22.684\nWe can work that out later.\n\n528\n00:28:22.684 --> 00:28:25.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who was that?\n\n529\n00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.320\nAbbott Costello?\n\n530\n00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; A great routine.\n\n531\n00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.550\n&gt;&gt; It was.\n\n532\n00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:32.990\n&gt;&gt; So, again, these ideas responsible,\naccountable, consulted and informed.\n\n533\n00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:37.310\nI've also seen this called ARCI in\nsome text because that kind of shows\n\n534\n00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.600\nthe hierarchical order,\nif you will, a bit better, but\n\n535\n00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.070\nan accountable person is a person that\nmakes sure the activity gets done.\n\n536\n00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.440\nThey don't actually do it.\n\n537\n00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:49.990\nRight?\n\n538\n00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.160\nAs you can see from\nthe very first example,\n\n539\n00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.670\nthe director of service management\nis both accountable and responsible.\n\n540\n00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:00.270\nSo it's certainly possible for a person\nto hold more than one level of interest,\n\n541\n00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.230\nresponsible and accountable.\n\n542\n00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.590\nSo that's totally legal.\n\n543\n00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.380\nRight?\n\n544\n00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.640\nBut in the next one, activity two,\nthe director of service management\n\n545\n00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.500\nis accountable but\nthe service level manager is responsible.\n\n546\n00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.260\nMeaning the service level manager\nactually is going to do it.\n\n547\n00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:19.800\nPerhaps write the document, or\nexecute the test or whatever it might be.\n\n548\n00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.830\nSo accountable means you make sure it\ngets done, you don't actually do it.\n\n549\n00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.160\nResponsible means you\nactually do it right?\n\n550\n00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.240\nOf course, consulted means that\nyou have material interest in it.\n\n551\n00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.950\nEither you can help that person with\ninformation or you're expecting that\n\n552\n00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.600\nperson to pass something on to\nyou when they're done, right?\n\n553\n00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.360\nSo you can kinda, consulting you're\na little closer to the activity.\n\n554\n00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.800\nYou're not doing it but\n\n555\n00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.580\nyou have information that's\nmaterial to it being executed.\n\n556\n00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.620\nOr you're gonna be on the receiving\nend very soon when it's completed.\n\n557\n00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.812\n&gt;&gt; So if I was my system's administrator\nand I wanted to perform a mid-day backup.\n\n558\n00:29:53.812 --> 00:29:57.160\nAnd I knew it was gonna maybe cause\nan outage for five or ten minutes\n\n559\n00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.890\nto our database I might go to the DBA and\nsay hey is this going to be a problem?\n\n560\n00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.030\nWhat's the best time?\n\n561\n00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.630\nSo he's consulting with me on what in\nthe best time method would be for so\n\n562\n00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.620\nthat we don't interrupt as\nmuch business as possible.\n\n563\n00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.640\nAnd, but he's not responsible if\nanything goes wrong, it's mine.\n\n564\n00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Very good example.\n\n565\n00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.830\nVery good example.\n\n566\n00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.590\nThanks Daniel.\n\n567\n00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.370\nVery good example.\n\n568\n00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:19.650\nSo you get the idea that the consultant\nis close, could be impacted by it, but\n\n569\n00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.090\nis not materially doing it,\nresponsible is.\n\n570\n00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.400\nAnd of course informed just\nmeans that you get the FYI.\n\n571\n00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.250\nYou're in the courtesy copy of the e-mail,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n572\n00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:30.020\nYou just are informed of it.\n\n573\n00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.550\nNow some rules of thumb about this.\n\n574\n00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:37.630\nFor any given activity you can't\nhave more than one accountable,\n\n575\n00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.620\nwhich means only one accountable for\nany activity.\n\n576\n00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.990\nIt's just the best practice to\nmake sure you know who to call and\n\n577\n00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:48.290\nwho is effectively whose reputation and\n\n578\n00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.680\naccountability is on the line,\nso to speak.\n\n579\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:55.440\nI remember learning this\nin first aid training.\n\n580\n00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.684\nYou don't just call out you come upon\nvictim, you don't just call out someone\n\n581\n00:30:59.684 --> 00:31:04.446\ncall 911 you point to someone and say you\ncall 911 it makes someone accountable and\n\n582\n00:31:04.446 --> 00:31:06.890\nin that case also responsible.\n\n583\n00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:10.680\nRight, known accountability, now because\naccountable people don't actually do\n\n584\n00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:16.330\nanything right you have to have at least\non responsible on that activity, right?\n\n585\n00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:20.960\nAs you're going along the line there\nyou have to one, only one accountable,\n\n586\n00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.824\nbut at least one responsible.\n\n587\n00:31:22.824 --> 00:31:25.012\nOf course, you could have three or\nfour people, two people.\n\n588\n00:31:25.012 --> 00:31:28.072\nYou can have more than one R, but\nyou have to have at least one, or\n\n589\n00:31:28.072 --> 00:31:29.463\nelse nothing will get done.\n\n590\n00:31:29.463 --> 00:31:32.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Kind of necessary\ncomponent there, right?\n\n591\n00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:34.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm accountable and\n\n592\n00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.345\nyou're informed, but\nwho the heck is doing this thing?\n\n593\n00:31:37.345 --> 00:31:38.431\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n594\n00:31:38.431 --> 00:31:38.974\nExactly.\n\n595\n00:31:38.974 --> 00:31:39.600\nAll right.\n\n596\n00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.050\nLet's look at some other roles.\n\n597\n00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.480\nNow, we've kind of loaded up these words\naccountable and responsible, right?\n\n598\n00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.997\nAccountable is make sure it gets done.\n\n599\n00:31:47.997 --> 00:31:52.981\nSo what a process owner is accountable for\nis to ensure the process we\n\n600\n00:31:52.981 --> 00:31:57.013\nformed according to agreed and\ndocumentary process.\n\n601\n00:31:57.013 --> 00:31:57.557\nRight.\n\n602\n00:31:57.557 --> 00:31:59.674\nAnd of course your meeting objectives.\n\n603\n00:31:59.674 --> 00:32:04.790\nRight, you are also probably auditing\nto make sure it's complied with.\n\n604\n00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.030\nYou are providing the training,\nso now here you're responsible.\n\n605\n00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.860\nYou're responsible for the audits.\n\n606\n00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.170\nYou're responsible for the training.\n\n607\n00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.130\nYou're responsible for\nthe document definition, right?\n\n608\n00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.290\nYou are responsible for\nwhat success looks like, so\n\n609\n00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.460\nyou define the key performance indicators.\n\n610\n00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.399\nSo accountable for\nthe overall quality of the process.\n\n611\n00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.100\nResponse before these specific\nactivities that attest to that.\n\n612\n00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.614\n&gt;&gt; Is this typically a project manager\nthat would probably fall under this?\n\n613\n00:32:33.614 --> 00:32:34.522\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n614\n00:32:34.522 --> 00:32:35.810\n&gt;&gt; No, imagine this.\n\n615\n00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.280\nActually, ITIL describes,\nyou don't have to imagine so much,\n\n616\n00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.800\nITIL describes 26 processes.\n\n617\n00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.918\nThey deal from strategic processes\nthrough design processes,\n\n618\n00:32:44.918 --> 00:32:47.040\non down through the life cycle stages.\n\n619\n00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.470\nSome 26 processes are defined by ITIL.\n\n620\n00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.755\nIf you wanna have these processes\nat your organization, you're gonna\n\n621\n00:32:55.755 --> 00:32:59.775\ncreate a process owner, you're gonna name\na process owner, make this come to life.\n\n622\n00:32:59.775 --> 00:33:04.135\nNow, Daniel, if what you're saying is\nto make this process come to life,\n\n623\n00:33:04.135 --> 00:33:09.225\nshould you take a project management\napproach to bring that process alive?\n\n624\n00:33:09.225 --> 00:33:11.845\nThat's a good insight,\nit really is, right?\n\n625\n00:33:11.845 --> 00:33:15.875\nBut a process owner and\na project manager are not the same thing.\n\n626\n00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:17.520\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, makes sense.\n\n627\n00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.406\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and\nwe'll certainly reinforce this concept of\n\n628\n00:33:21.406 --> 00:33:26.120\nproject management discipline\nas you try to implement ITIL.\n\n629\n00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.548\nIt's certainly a good approach,\nso pretty insightful.\n\n630\n00:33:28.548 --> 00:33:32.780\nAll right, so that's process owner.\n\n631\n00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.460\nA process manager is a little bit closer\nto the day to day operation of this.\n\n632\n00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.040\nThey are managing the operational\n\n633\n00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.050\nimplementation of the process,\nif you will.\n\n634\n00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.570\nSo they're instructing\npeople to execute it now.\n\n635\n00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.200\nMaybe they are practitioners in it well.\n\n636\n00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.010\nSo they actually are involved in a day\nto day execution, process managers are.\n\n637\n00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.970\nProcess owners, accountable.\n\n638\n00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.420\nProcess managers, responsible.\n\n639\n00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:00.609\nAnd of course, process practitioners are\non the ground carrying out specific steps.\n\n640\n00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:07.180\nNow, just keep this in mind that this is\nnot necessarily a hierarchical order in\n\n641\n00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.400\nyour organization.\n\n642\n00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.750\nWhat I mean by that is,\nit's possible that a process owner\n\n643\n00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:15.890\ncould be out ranked in your\norganization by a process manager.\n\n644\n00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:17.010\nIn fact, it's possible for\n\n645\n00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:21.460\na process practitioner to out\nrank them as well, right?\n\n646\n00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:26.570\nFor instance, as an example,\nin change management, you might require\n\n647\n00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:31.310\nsenior vice president approval for\ncertain kind of changes, right?\n\n648\n00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.290\nWhen they go in to approve that change,\n\n649\n00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:35.670\nthey are effectively\na process practitioner.\n\n650\n00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.030\nThey are executing steps\nwithin the process.\n\n651\n00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.140\nIt has to be the approval process.\n\n652\n00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:43.699\nSo there you'd have a practitioner\npotentially out ranking the manager and\n\n653\n00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:44.820\nthe owner.\n\n654\n00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.761\nIt's not meant to be\na hierarchical relationship, okay?\n\n655\n00:34:47.761 --> 00:34:51.255\nAll right, a service owner.\n\n656\n00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:55.360\nAgain, we've loaded up these words\naccountable and responsible.\n\n657\n00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.480\nA service owner is accountable for\nthe delivery of the IT service.\n\n658\n00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.560\nThey make sure it gets done.\n\n659\n00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.160\nThey make sure it gets done well, right?\n\n660\n00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.722\nSo they have a stake in the game\nof everything that makes a service\n\n661\n00:35:05.722 --> 00:35:06.295\nsuccessful.\n\n662\n00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:09.380\nWhether it be processes,\nwhether it be technology,\n\n663\n00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.161\nwhether it be skill sets,\ntraining, customer relationships.\n\n664\n00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:16.880\nThey become the face and\nname for the service.\n\n665\n00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.380\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n666\n00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:23.470\n&gt;&gt; So accountable for the entire service,\nresponsible not so much for\n\n667\n00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.484\nany specific thing, right?\n\n668\n00:35:25.484 --> 00:35:30.790\nThey are accountable holistically for\nthe quality of the service.\n\n669\n00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:31.791\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n670\n00:35:32.793 --> 00:35:35.770\nSo that concludes our review.\n\n671\n00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:38.240\nThis is a good foundation review here.\n\n672\n00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.740\nSelf study and\nreview is gonna be important for you.\n\n673\n00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:46.230\nWhat's next is going to be a dive\nin to the service operation life\n\n674\n00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.902\ncycle stage as a whole.\n\n675\n00:35:47.902 --> 00:35:51.400\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well, Terry,\nI'm looking totally forward to that.\n\n676\n00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.010\nI'm sure our audience is as well.\n\n677\n00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:54.760\nWe do thank you guys for\ndropping by today.\n\n678\n00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.980\nYou've done a fantastic job of reminding\nus of all the key concepts and\n\n679\n00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:03.830\nthings that we are going to assume to be\nknown by us as exam takers for the OSA.\n\n680\n00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.570\nSo definitely crack out your old books,\nall your exam notes,\n\n681\n00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.840\nrefresh that content in your mind so\nthat you are prepared for that.\n\n682\n00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.560\nAnd of course, we're gonna build\nupon that foundational knowledge\n\n683\n00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.880\nin our upcoming episodes.\n\n684\n00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.760\nSo looking forward to that.\n\n685\n00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.230\nThanks for dropping by today, Terry.\n\n686\n00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.960\nAnd thank you guys for watching,\nbut it is time for us to sign

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.072\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n4\n00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:16.007\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.220\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.370\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with more on our ITIL OSA series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.920\nAnd of course, back for\nmore of that action to lend his\n\n8\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.950\nexpertise on that very topic,\nour good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.150\nTerry, welcome back, man.\n\n10\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.670\nHow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.820\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here, Daniel, as usual.\n\n12\n00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.955\nYeah, we got a pretty good topic\nhere on incident management.\n\n13\n00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:40.250\nIncident management is a fundamental\nfoundational process in service operations\n\n14\n00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.030\nthat makes sure you restore\nservice as quickly as possible.\n\n15\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.170\nAnd it faces end users often,\nnot always, but often.\n\n16\n00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.360\nTherefore, it's a pretty\nimportant process.\n\n17\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, I guess that being said,\n\n18\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.750\nif it's that important, where do we\nstart to understand this monster?\n\n19\n00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.790\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's first define,\nremind ourselves, what an incident is.\n\n20\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.910\nAn incident really is just\nanytime something happens that\n\n21\n00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.250\ncould disrupt the service or\nhas disrupted the service.\n\n22\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.891\nSo this could be something you're\nmonitoring in the backend that's not\n\n23\n00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.349\nnecessarily visible to users,\nsuch as events.\n\n24\n00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:15.320\nThe disk is 75% full.\n\n25\n00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.610\nSo you get in front of that problem,\nin front of that failure,\n\n26\n00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.330\nand you solve it before it disrupts.\n\n27\n00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.078\nOr it could be the user calls and says,\nthe service is down, I can't use it,\n\n28\n00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:27.025\nwhat's going on?\n\n29\n00:01:27.025 --> 00:01:31.580\nOr 50 users call and say,\nthe service is down, I can't use it.\n\n30\n00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.959\nThat's also an incident, or\nin that case, probably 50 incidents.\n\n31\n00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:37.675\nCuz a lot of people called, right.\n\n32\n00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:42.110\nSo an incident is each occurrence\nof the detection, right?\n\n33\n00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.484\nSo if 50 people called the service desk,\nthat would be 50 incidents.\n\n34\n00:01:45.484 --> 00:01:49.721\nEven though there's probably only\none problem underneath all those 50,\n\n35\n00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:53.770\nthat's still, in terms of units\nof measure, that's 50 incidents.\n\n36\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.405\n&gt;&gt; That's a good distinction to make.\n\n37\n00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:59.012\nCuz if you go in the exam and you think,\nwell, yeah, we had 50 people call, but\n\n38\n00:01:59.012 --> 00:02:01.872\nthe incident is one,\nit's one thing that's causing these calls,\n\n39\n00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:04.763\nyou might be tempted to think\nthat's one incident, but it's not.\n\n40\n00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:08.027\nIt's each time a user calls in\nsaying something is occurring,\n\n41\n00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.770\nyou count that as an incident.\n\n42\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you need to keep track,\nyou need to count these things,\n\n43\n00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.120\ncuz that itself is important data.\n\n44\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.870\nThe underlying root cause of this ITIL\nwould call a problem, by the way.\n\n45\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.400\nSo underneath this is a problem\nthat's causing these 50 incidents to\n\n46\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.660\noccur, right.\n\n47\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.600\nOr maybe you got 10 today and\n20 tomorrow and 35 next week.\n\n48\n00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.013\nSo they add up over time, right.\n\n49\n00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:33.291\nSo that's why you keep score.\n\n50\n00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:37.404\nYou're also spending cycles of work\neffort trying to resolve those.\n\n51\n00:02:37.404 --> 00:02:38.910\nThat's another reason why you keep score.\n\n52\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.800\nYou don't just ignore it,\nyou still log those things.\n\n53\n00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.852\nSo that's what an incident is.\n\n54\n00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:47.181\nSo why manage them, right?\n\n55\n00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:49.340\nSo let's have a look at this slide here.\n\n56\n00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.310\nAgain, the purpose of incident management\nis to restore service as quickly\n\n57\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.890\nas possible.\n\n58\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.160\nSo when these things do happen, you get\nthe service restored quickly, right?\n\n59\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.070\nIn doing so, you're minimizing the adverse\neffects on business operations,\n\n60\n00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.630\nbecause you're quick at\ngetting these things restored.\n\n61\n00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.300\nAnd you get general good guidelines\non how you should be operating,\n\n62\n00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.770\nhow quickly, on what types of services.\n\n63\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.490\nSome instances may have lower\npriorities than others, right?\n\n64\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.591\nIf a user calls and says, I can't find\nthe submit button on the application,\n\n65\n00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:25.673\nis that just a user education thing,\nor if 50 people call and\n\n66\n00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:31.190\nsay I can't find the submit button, is\nthat an intrinsic problem with the design?\n\n67\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.220\nOr did it go away in the last change over\nthe weekend and it was an accident, right?\n\n68\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.850\nSo that's why you keep score,\nyou keep logging.\n\n69\n00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.800\nAnd you make sure you're\nresponding to the right things,\n\n70\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.160\nand the right indicators,\nat the right time, right.\n\n71\n00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.770\nSo why standardize these things?\n\n72\n00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.760\nStandardized methods\nmeans you can repeat it.\n\n73\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.180\nYou can get efficient at it.\n\n74\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.750\nYou get methodical about it.\n\n75\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.031\nYou're not reinventing\nthe wheel every time, right.\n\n76\n00:03:56.031 --> 00:04:00.489\nSo these incidents could start,\nagain, the traditional way,\n\n77\n00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.530\nfrom users calling the service desk.\n\n78\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.125\nOr it could be automatically\ntriggered because of some\n\n79\n00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:08.650\nevent that you monitor\nin your infrastructure.\n\n80\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.403\nLike there's a disk's 75% full,\nsends an alert to somebody.\n\n81\n00:04:12.403 --> 00:04:15.595\nOr actually raises the ticket,\nthe incident ticket, and\n\n82\n00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:19.520\nlogs it to the appropriate resolving\nteam with the right priorities.\n\n83\n00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.743\nThat sort of thing.\nSo some of this could be automated if you\n\n84\n00:04:21.743 --> 00:04:25.815\nhave a robust event management regime,\nwhich we'll be talking in detail about\n\n85\n00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:29.260\na little bit later how these\nprocesses can help each other.\n\n86\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.810\nSo it kind of begs the question,\n\n87\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.950\nis every incident triggered by\nan event which is automated?\n\n88\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.370\nNo, because users might discover it first.\n\n89\n00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.080\nRight?\n\n90\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.910\nIs every event lead to an incident?\n\n91\n00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.120\nNo, they are distinct and\ndifferent concepts in ITIL.\n\n92\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.290\nThey certainly are related, but\nthey are distinct and separate, okay.\n\n93\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.610\nSo another aspect of any of\nthese processes, by the way,\n\n94\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.840\nas we go through the five\nprocesses of service operations,\n\n95\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.800\nwe will necessarily be talking about\npolicy and overall governance.\n\n96\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.190\nPolicy and process work together to\nprovide the governance framework.\n\n97\n00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.880\nAlong with performing audits,\nkeeping count,\n\n98\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.670\nassessing people's adherence or\ncompliance with the processes\n\n99\n00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.960\nis also part of the health of a process\nand the governance of a process.\n\n100\n00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.550\nBut policies, reinforce,\nbecause they're written down,\n\n101\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.030\nthey're the rules that\nyou're supposed to follow.\n\n102\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.160\nSo it's one thing to have a process.\n\n103\n00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.860\nIt's another thing for that process\nto be bolstered by policy, right.\n\n104\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.148\nAnd these are just some of the examples\nof some of the topics that policy could\n\n105\n00:05:38.148 --> 00:05:38.820\nplay in on.\n\n106\n00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.809\nAnd rather than read all these, I just\nwant to point out that understanding that\n\n107\n00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:48.797\na process doesn't it stands on its own\nisland and everyone follows it because,\n\n108\n00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:50.600\npolicy helps that, right.\n\n109\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.510\nPolicy helps that and\nenforce the need to comply, right.\n\n110\n00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.860\nAs you take an exam, certainly\nhaving policies backing up of your\n\n111\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.650\nprocesses is gonna be one of those\nkey factors you're looking for.\n\n112\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.231\nAnd perhaps that best answer\nthat has a five wait,\n\n113\n00:06:07.231 --> 00:06:11.930\nas opposed to the second best\nanswer that might leave policy out.\n\n114\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.655\nOkay, so the basic principles of incident\nmanagement is to make sure you do\n\n115\n00:06:16.655 --> 00:06:18.460\nthings in a timely manner.\n\n116\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.210\nIf the main purpose of incident\nmanagement is to restore\n\n117\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.950\nservice as quickly as possible,\nthen time is of the essence.\n\n118\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.680\nIf your tool set can support time scales,\nmeaning how long it took for\n\n119\n00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.770\nthe incident to be detected,\nhow long did it take for\n\n120\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.240\nit to be resolved, right,\nand all points in between.\n\n121\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.433\nDid it linger with the network team for\ntwo hours before it got transferred\n\n122\n00:06:42.433 --> 00:06:45.078\nto the server team,\nwhich was really the ones that fixed it?\n\n123\n00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:49.067\nSo did we misdiagnose at the early end of\nthat and therefore waste two hours of time\n\n124\n00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:53.220\nwith the network team when it should\nhave gone straight to the server team?\n\n125\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.472\nSo paying attention to this over\ntime is an important aspect, right.\n\n126\n00:06:58.472 --> 00:07:01.235\nAnd coming up with\nrepeatable processes for\n\n127\n00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:04.600\nhow to handle particular\nkind of incidents.\n\n128\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.480\nFor instance,\n\n129\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.620\nnetworks are vitally important to\nthe health of many IT services.\n\n130\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:15.340\nAnd if a network goes down, then it could\naffect the whole landscape of services.\n\n131\n00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.630\nTherefore, maybe if you have a network\noutage, you respond a little bit more\n\n132\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.990\nurgently with a bit more sense\nof impact awareness, right?\n\n133\n00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.750\nSo perhaps you come up with an incident\nmodel for how you're going to attack\n\n134\n00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:33.140\nnetwork issues versus how you're going\nto attack application issues, right?\n\n135\n00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.640\nComing up with methodical ways to\ndetermine priorities based on urgency and\n\n136\n00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.950\nimpact could be part of your\nincident models as well.\n\n137\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.490\nSo incident models,\nthis word model is used a lot by ITIL.\n\n138\n00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.635\nIt simply means predefined ways to\nhandle particular kinds of things,\n\n139\n00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.546\nwhether it's a problem model or\na request model.\n\n140\n00:07:51.546 --> 00:07:52.571\nHere we have an incident model.\n\n141\n00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:56.805\nIt's defining those ways you're going\nto handle the types of incidents you're\n\n142\n00:07:56.805 --> 00:07:57.750\nexpected to see.\n\n143\n00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.083\nOkay.\n\n144\n00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:04.040\nOf course a major incident,\nis an incident of a particular import.\n\n145\n00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.760\nIt does require special handling.\n\n146\n00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.370\nIt's like when you have an outage.\n\n147\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.510\nYou know the service is falling over,\nwhat are you gonna do?\n\n148\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.940\nIt's about to fall over, in one of my\nwork environments we call it a swat,\n\n149\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.950\nspecial weapons and tactics, right?\n\n150\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.450\nBecause it was special,\n\n151\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.010\nwe did something extraordinary when\nwe had these kind of incidents.\n\n152\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.100\nWe had quick ways to call smart,\n\n153\n00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.620\nresponsible people to a phone bridge,\nfor instance, at all times a day.\n\n154\n00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.380\nRight, so it was special in that regard,\n\n155\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.970\nhow we engaged with what people,\nto solve the problem.\n\n156\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.500\nWe had expanded communication channels\nopen, so we could easily escalate\n\n157\n00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.980\nthrough the chains of command\nimportant updates, right?\n\n158\n00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.940\nBecause these are so impactful, major\nincidents require special handling, right?\n\n159\n00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.930\nOf course, you need to come up with\nmethodical way to track your incidents,\n\n160\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.420\nthe status in this case,\nas well as the categories.\n\n161\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.760\nStatus indicators such as Open,\nIn progress,\n\n162\n00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.340\nResolved, Closed, all given a sense of\nwhere in the life cycle this incident is.\n\n163\n00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.155\nAnd you can might have others,\nthis is not prescriptive in any way.\n\n164\n00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:08.030\nYou might not call it Open,\nIn progress, Resolved or Closed.\n\n165\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.690\nYour tool set might have different ways\nto refer to the status indicators,\n\n166\n00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.050\nthat's fine.\n\n167\n00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.840\nBut the point is you know where in the\nlife cycle a given incident is, all right?\n\n168\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.870\nSo why bother, right?\n\n169\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.980\nFirst of all, it's highly visible.\n\n170\n00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.900\nYou need to get good at this.\n\n171\n00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.060\nIf you manage incidents well,\n\n172\n00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.320\nyou can have a rather positive\nrelationship with the business.\n\n173\n00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.166\nThe business doesn't necessarily\nexpect perfection but\n\n174\n00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:42.414\nthey do expect responsiveness\nwhen it's not perfect, right.\n\n175\n00:09:42.414 --> 00:09:46.391\nAnd this goes with all sorts of things and\nall kinds of services and\n\n176\n00:09:46.391 --> 00:09:50.442\nwhether you're talking about an IT\nservice or a car wash service or\n\n177\n00:09:50.442 --> 00:09:54.421\na restaurant providing service,\nit's not always perfect, but\n\n178\n00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:59.148\nif something's not quite right,\nyou expect it to be remedied soon, right?\n\n179\n00:09:59.148 --> 00:10:00.803\nSo what if I don't have\nfork at the restaurant.\n\n180\n00:10:00.803 --> 00:10:03.755\nI don't wanna wait until\neveryone else at the table is\n\n181\n00:10:03.755 --> 00:10:05.320\nfinished before I get my fork, right?\n\n182\n00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.570\nSo they forgot to give me a fork.\n\n183\n00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.781\nAm I gonna lower the tip on\nthe waitresses just because of that,\n\n184\n00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:11.700\nhave an awful relationship\nwith the services provider?\n\n185\n00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.000\nNo, I'm gonna ask for a fork and\nget it real quick, that kind of thing.\n\n186\n00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.360\nThe same thing when they sent me Azure for\nan IT service.\n\n187\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.670\nYou will respond in an appropriate\nmanner at the right sense of urgency and\n\n188\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.620\nbring this back.\n\n189\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.850\nPerfection is not the expectation,\nresponsiveness is.\n\n190\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.920\nAnd instant management is on the front\nof that response, all right.\n\n191\n00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.830\nSo how might the incidents be triggered?\n\n192\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.730\nAnd we're gonna get into the details\nnow about the activities\n\n193\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.530\nof incident management.\n\n194\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.270\nCertainly the trigger point\ncould be event management.\n\n195\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.960\nWhich we'll talk in some detail later on.\n\n196\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.050\nBut this is the automated\nalerts that might be triggered.\n\n197\n00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:54.800\nDisk is 75% full, licenses are nearly\nexpired, those types of things.\n\n198\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.400\nEvents could trigger those\nincidents to be managed, right?\n\n199\n00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.700\nA web interface users could use,\nphone calls, email, chat windows.\n\n200\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.290\nStepping up with physical contact,\n\n201\n00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:10.220\nyou might have service desk kiosk\nin your physical locations, right.\n\n202\n00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.040\nAnd you just take your laptop, you got\na problem, you go up to the kiosk and\n\n203\n00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.890\nsay, this laptop won't boot up.\n\n204\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:15.540\nCan you help me?\n\n205\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.690\nSo there's lots of points of interface\nthat get this started, right.\n\n206\n00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.270\nAnd then of course, once it gets started,\nis it really an incident, right?\n\n207\n00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.670\nLike I said, if the user calls and says,\n\n208\n00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.410\nI can't find the Submit button, perhaps\nthat's just a request for information.\n\n209\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.310\nSo as the service desk takes that call\nthey kind of kick that down a different\n\n210\n00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.010\npath of resolution.\n\n211\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.960\nThey may be the same service desk\ntechnician helping them out, but\n\n212\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.020\nit's not an incident.\n\n213\n00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.490\nIt's not logged that way.\n\n214\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.770\nIt's not logged as a service disruption.\n\n215\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.160\nAgain, if 50 users call and say,\nI can't find the submit button,\n\n216\n00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.190\nyou might have an underlying problem\nthat needs to be resolved, right?\n\n217\n00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.820\nOr, if you regularly get such questions\nover time about the use of a given\n\n218\n00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.050\nservice, maybe you need to shore up\nthe interface or shore up training, right.\n\n219\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.370\nSo trends over time in\nyour incident landscape\n\n220\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.310\ncould lead to some improvement\nopportunities later on.\n\n221\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.510\n&gt;&gt; So it's basically the whole\nreason we're doing this,\n\n222\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.160\nis try to find those\ntrends that are happening.\n\n223\n00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.850\nIf 50 users do call and\nsay I can't find a Submit button.\n\n224\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.800\nEven if the Submit button\nis four inches by four\n\n225\n00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.215\ninches in the middle of the screen and\nblinking.\n\n226\n00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:18.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They say I can't find.\n\n227\n00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.650\nWell, then okay, apparently there's\nsomething wrong with our user base.\n\n228\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:21.380\nWe need to look there.\n\n229\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.080\nIt's helping us find where\nthe problem is coming from and\n\n230\n00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.710\nnot necessarily is the system itself.\n\n231\n00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.770\nIt might be, like you said, training.\n\n232\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that you can more easily find it\n\n233\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.080\neven though it should be simple.\n\n234\n00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.920\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\nNow just to be clear on this,\n\n235\n00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.350\nproblem management would do\nthat deliberative analysis.\n\n236\n00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.260\nWe'll talk about problem management next.\n\n237\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.000\nProblem management will be the process\nITIL identifies as the one that\n\n238\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.050\ntakes the deliberative approach,\nlooks at trends, says, wow.\n\n239\n00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:49.490\nWe get 50 tickets a day based on\nthe usability of this application.\n\n240\n00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.500\nThere must be something up here.\n\n241\n00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.870\nIt's not always a submit button, but\npeople are just swimming around.\n\n242\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.690\nWhy is that?\n\n243\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.640\nBecause you'd see that\ntrend lasting over time,\n\n244\n00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.160\nproblem management would be the one\nto identify that sort of thing.\n\n245\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.520\nBut you see how incident management\nhas provided the basis for\n\n246\n00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.620\nsuch an investigation?\n\n247\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.210\n&gt;&gt; It gives the information necessary for\nthem to be able to even do that.\n\n248\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nyou don't have invisible work, right?\n\n249\n00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.640\nWhat can kill you at an organization\nis having just activities happen and\n\n250\n00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.140\nno one knows they really happened.\n\n251\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.630\nAnd invisible work can not only suck your\ntime, but it also can make it harder for\n\n252\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.010\nyou to justify your need for\nresources, right?\n\n253\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.990\nIt can also make it hard for you to\nprioritize your activities appropriately.\n\n254\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.580\nSo having a formalistic management\nprocess that at least has a gatekeeper\n\n255\n00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.350\nwhere you are gonna log these activities,\nthis churn in the business,\n\n256\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.710\nis gonna be important, right?\n\n257\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.190\nSo, if you do determine that\nyou do have an incident,\n\n258\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:48.100\nyou can move forward and\nbe reactive with this or proactive, right?\n\n259\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.350\nIf you could be proactive in identifying\nincidents, that's to mean getting\n\n260\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.990\nin front of it, that could be buoyed,\nfor instance, by event management.\n\n261\n00:13:54.990 --> 00:14:00.280\nThe scenario I keep going back to or\nexample, the disc is 75% full.\n\n262\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.250\nWouldn't it be great if you just\nautomatically detected that\n\n263\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.370\ncapacity issue.\n\n264\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:10.010\nAnd issue a ticket before the disk\ngot full and fell over, right.\n\n265\n00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:15.770\nSo proactive responding to indicators\nin your event management landscape\n\n266\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:20.270\ncan help you forestall issues where\nthe things actually fall over, right.\n\n267\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.730\nCertainly if the service desk calls or\ngets a call,\n\n268\n00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:27.650\nI should say from an end user,\nyou're obviously reacting to that, right.\n\n269\n00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.240\nSo monitor your systems, understand\nplanned maintenance, keep them from\n\n270\n00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.434\nhappening is another proactive activity\nyou could probably work on, right.\n\n271\n00:14:35.434 --> 00:14:37.349\nAll right, great.\n\n272\n00:14:39.686 --> 00:14:43.344\nWe've somewhat beaten this horse already,\nlog the work,\n\n273\n00:14:43.344 --> 00:14:45.400\nyou don't want invisible work.\n\n274\n00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.830\nInclude date and time stamps.\n\n275\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.000\nCan be retrospective.\n\n276\n00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.150\nMaybe you get it back up quick, and\n\n277\n00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.030\nthen go back and fill in the details,\nthat could be something.\n\n278\n00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.930\nMaybe it's so big, like for\na major incident, you might get\n\n279\n00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.920\nbusy solving a problem instead of making\nsure all your records are up to date.\n\n280\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.550\nBut make sure you get that done.\n\n281\n00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.050\n&gt;&gt; This was one of the hardest things for\nme when I was young in IT.\n\n282\n00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.920\nAnd I was I was responsible with writing\nup what it is I was doing as they thought,\n\n283\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.690\nlike you said you don't want invisible\nwork, there is Daniel sitting in his\n\n284\n00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.960\noffice we don't have any record\nof him actually doing anything.\n\n285\n00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.420\nSo, we're gonna change\nmanagement system and\n\n286\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.690\nI had a hard time understanding\nwhat they wanted me to do with it.\n\n287\n00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.710\nThere was no training involved.\n\n288\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.870\nThey didn't say so I would do work and\nat the end of the week I would write all\n\n289\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.790\nthe little things nad they were like,\nno, that is wrong.\n\n290\n00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We need you as you do this,\n\n291\n00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.440\nobviously if you're in the middle of\nsolving a problem you're not typing in\n\n292\n00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.260\nyour change management system, but\nI would get done with a call and\n\n293\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.680\nI would immediately write up,\nhere's who called, here's why they called,\n\n294\n00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.740\nhere's what I did to resolve the issue and\nwas I effective or not.\n\n295\n00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.670\nDid I have to escalate it?\n\n296\n00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.368\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; And we have to push that.\n\n297\n00:15:47.368 --> 00:15:50.942\nAnd that made things a whole lot easier\ncuz as you go back, if somebody calls\n\n298\n00:15:50.942 --> 00:15:54.146\nagain and has the same issue,\nI can just read that management law.\n\n299\n00:15:54.146 --> 00:15:56.309\nAnd again, I say, I remember this.\n\n300\n00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:56.990\nI can fix this.\n\n301\n00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.721\nIt's right here.\n\n302\n00:15:57.721 --> 00:15:59.300\nAnd it made my life a whole lot easier.\n\n303\n00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.036\n&gt;&gt; It's very good and\n\n304\n00:16:00.036 --> 00:16:02.626\nthat's previewing some other things\nwe are going to learn about.\n\n305\n00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:06.650\nAgain the deliberative process\nis problem management.\n\n306\n00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.840\nThey would look at this over time.\n\n307\n00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.910\nCreate known-error database, so you don't\nhave to re-investigate or re-diagnosis.\n\n308\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.610\nHere's the known-error database and\nhopefully here's a workaround.\n\n309\n00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:16.710\nWe know we've got an issue.\n\n310\n00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.652\nHere's the workaround for now.\n\n311\n00:16:18.652 --> 00:16:22.387\nSo you're already anticipating,\nwhich is great, that as a baseline,\n\n312\n00:16:22.387 --> 00:16:26.204\ninstant management is giving you\na basis for this kind of conversationa.\n\n313\n00:16:26.204 --> 00:16:30.944\nAnd this deliberative approach to\nkeeping the environment healthy and\n\n314\n00:16:30.944 --> 00:16:32.530\nready for use, right?\n\n315\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.030\nVery good.\n\n316\n00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.400\nSo what are you keeping up with?\n\n317\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.810\nAgain, a laundry list of items here.\n\n318\n00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.910\nNot gonna read these all to you,\n\n319\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.730\nbut basically what you're talking\nabout is the details of the incident.\n\n320\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:51.010\nThe exam is not gonna be such\nminiscule details about this.\n\n321\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.940\nAnd perhaps you already have some\nexperience with some incident logging\n\n322\n00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.330\nin your own environments.\n\n323\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.315\nOr if you've ever even called someone for\nhelp for\n\n324\n00:17:00.315 --> 00:17:03.285\nan IT issue, they've probably\nasked you a few questions.\n\n325\n00:17:03.285 --> 00:17:04.395\nWhat network are you on?\n\n326\n00:17:04.395 --> 00:17:05.395\nWhere are you located?\n\n327\n00:17:05.395 --> 00:17:05.985\nWhat's your name?\n\n328\n00:17:05.985 --> 00:17:07.095\nWhat business unit?\n\n329\n00:17:07.095 --> 00:17:08.755\nWhat application you're concerned with?\n\n330\n00:17:08.755 --> 00:17:13.055\nI mean, there's all sorts of questions\nthat go into the definition and\n\n331\n00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:16.905\ndescription of an incident,\nthat could be relevant later on, right?\n\n332\n00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:21.170\nThe geography of it, the date and\ntime, and place, etc.\n\n333\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:26.790\nUltimately, what this record would hold,\nis how you end up resolving it, right?\n\n334\n00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.473\nSo if it takes five minutes,\nif it takes five weeks,\n\n335\n00:17:30.473 --> 00:17:34.002\nfive months to actually\nclose these things down.\n\n336\n00:17:34.002 --> 00:17:38.033\nUltimately, your record will have\nthe full account of what happened, okay.\n\n337\n00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.060\nSo categorization.\n\n338\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.500\nWhy categorize events?\n\n339\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.610\nNow, here's what we're talking\nabout with categories.\n\n340\n00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:54.728\nWe're talking about the area or\nthe need of response in a category.\n\n341\n00:17:54.728 --> 00:17:58.480\nSo this can be kind of confusing,\nI know at my own organization,\n\n342\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.590\nwe had category creep.\n\n343\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.740\nThere were so\nmany categories to choose from,\n\n344\n00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.450\nwe went to our system,\nwe dropped down a list.\n\n345\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.640\nAnd it had so many entries on it,\nI just looked for the word Other.\n\n346\n00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.999\nBecause I didn't want to read all of\nthese to consider which one should I\n\n347\n00:18:10.999 --> 00:18:11.602\nchoose, right?\n\n348\n00:18:11.602 --> 00:18:16.755\nIt can get complicated, so\none rule of thumb would be\n\n349\n00:18:16.755 --> 00:18:23.680\nto keep this as simple as possible\nwhile being effective as possible.\n\n350\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.540\nDo you wanna categorize by\nthe team that resolved it, right?\n\n351\n00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.790\nDo you wanna categorize by the geography?\n\n352\n00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.780\nPerhaps you want to break\nit down by geography.\n\n353\n00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.660\nI think the trick here to categorization\nis to understand your full tool set.\n\n354\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.560\nIn the examples I gave,\ndo you want to categorize by geography?\n\n355\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.649\nWell, perhaps there's already another\nfield that describes geography.\n\n356\n00:18:45.649 --> 00:18:48.375\nCuz maybe you're getting\nthe demographics from your user,\n\n357\n00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:50.720\nthe user call from Australia.\n\n358\n00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.650\nThere's a field already over there\nthat gives you the geography piece.\n\n359\n00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.387\nSo you wouldn't want to categorize by\nit because you can query by that by\n\n360\n00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.330\nother means later on, right?\n\n361\n00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.120\nThe same with who's resolving it?\n\n362\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.020\nDo you wanna categorize that the network\nteam was the one that fixed it, or\n\n363\n00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.580\nthe server team, or the application team?\n\n364\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.400\nYeah, you could do that.\n\n365\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.840\nI'm not saying that's wrong.\n\n366\n00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.653\nI'm just saying there might be\nother fields within your framework,\n\n367\n00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:14.139\nthat have who resolved it.\n\n368\n00:19:14.139 --> 00:19:19.192\nTherefore, there's already a data\npoint against which you could query.\n\n369\n00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:21.190\nAnd get that information\nlater if you needed it.\n\n370\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.670\nSo just be cautious about your categories,\ncuz they can creep.\n\n371\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.870\nIn my own experience, this is not\nprescriptive at all, this is me talking,\n\n372\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:28.670\nnot ITIL, right?\n\n373\n00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:34.505\nIn my own experience, categorizing\naround the service that's been impacted,\n\n374\n00:19:34.505 --> 00:19:40.270\nproved to be the most resilient and gave\nus the most value in reporting later on.\n\n375\n00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:47.250\nLinking up to the service being impacted,\nmakes service reporting easier, right?\n\n376\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.020\nInstead of having to somehow\nretrofit geography application and\n\n377\n00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.936\nthen marry it up with whatever\nservice that might've been, okay.\n\n378\n00:19:54.936 --> 00:20:00.559\nAll right, so why do these categories\nas basically for trend analysis?\n\n379\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.900\nIf you find that you\nhave a major incident,\n\n380\n00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.460\nobviously you're gonna kick it\nout to that special process.\n\n381\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:11.964\nAgain, we called ours SWAT, major incident\nprocedures to special weapons and tactics.\n\n382\n00:20:11.964 --> 00:20:15.670\nWhatever acronym you might get it to,\nyou're gonna do something different there.\n\n383\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.660\nIf it's not a major incident,\nthen you're gonna get into analyzing,\n\n384\n00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.740\nwhat should I do with it?\n\n385\n00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.820\nSo and the prioritization\n\n386\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.650\nis also big peace of this, so\ncategorization and prioritization.\n\n387\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.530\nPrioritization is based on urgency and\nimpact.\n\n388\n00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.541\nIt's possible that you could have\na highly urgent need to satisfy\n\n389\n00:20:38.541 --> 00:20:42.367\nan incident even though\nthe impact is not that huge.\n\n390\n00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:46.780\nAs an example,\nthe disk is 75% full, right?\n\n391\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.485\nThe impact of not resolving\nthat right now is not huge.\n\n392\n00:20:50.485 --> 00:20:54.420\nBut the urgency to get in front of it is,\nright?\n\n393\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.880\nJust an example,\nit could go the other way.\n\n394\n00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.950\nYou could have a high impact incident\nthat doesn't require a lot urgency.\n\n395\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.572\nAs an example,\n50 users can't find the Submit buttom.\n\n396\n00:21:05.572 --> 00:21:09.961\nYou do some diagnosis and\nrealize that the Submit button was\n\n397\n00:21:09.961 --> 00:21:13.930\nacidentally removed in\nthe change over the weekend.\n\n398\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.136\nYou not gonna have another change for\nanother week.\n\n399\n00:21:18.136 --> 00:21:19.598\nSo we need a workaround.\n\n400\n00:21:19.598 --> 00:21:23.698\nWell, the workaround is to go up to\nthe report menu and choose Submit.\n\n401\n00:21:23.698 --> 00:21:27.831\nSo we understand the Submit button is\ngone, we will resolve it in due time,\n\n402\n00:21:27.831 --> 00:21:30.250\nhere's the workaround in the meantime.\n\n403\n00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.900\nSo while the impact is considerably high,\nif you can't submit your reports,\n\n404\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.850\nthe workaround satisfied that impact, then\nyou work on it in deliberative manner.\n\n405\n00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:45.340\nSo again, the nexus of urgency and impact,\nwhere they intersect, is priority, right?\n\n406\n00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.930\nAll right, coming up with methodical ways.\n\n407\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.870\nThis is just some examples.\n\n408\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.040\nHigh, medium, low, critical, high,\nmedium, low, right, planning.\n\n409\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.320\nYou see how you have\ndifferent approaches to this.\n\n410\n00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.660\nThe moral of the story is, have\nan approach, and be consistent with it.\n\n411\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.170\nArticulate this well\nacross your service teams.\n\n412\n00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.310\nAs well as across the service\ndesk themselves, so\n\n413\n00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:13.880\nthat you provide a consistent approach\nto how you manage priorities.\n\n414\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.407\nJust anecdotal information,\n\n415\n00:22:17.407 --> 00:22:20.844\nI'm not gonna throw any service\nprovider under the bus specifically.\n\n416\n00:22:20.844 --> 00:22:25.720\nBut we had a service provider\nwho didn't think the loss\n\n417\n00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.180\nof our 5,000 mailboxes was urgent, right?\n\n418\n00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.280\nSo we had some difference\nof opinion there.\n\n419\n00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.410\nI mean we had a 100,000 employees.\n\n420\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.988\nThe loss of 5,000 mailboxes, or\nthe temporary lack of email for\n\n421\n00:22:38.988 --> 00:22:43.060\n5,000 users,\nseemed like a low priority to them.\n\n422\n00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.908\nIn their way of analyzing urgency and\nimpact,\n\n423\n00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:50.065\nthey didn't see it as such a big deal,\n\n424\n00:22:50.065 --> 00:22:55.212\nthat some of these 5,000 users\nwere CEOs and CIOs, etc.\n\n425\n00:22:55.212 --> 00:22:56.160\nTake your email away.\n\n426\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.010\nThis lasted four days, right?\n\n427\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:03.120\nSo the right amount of urgency wasn't\nquite built into the way they established\n\n428\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.710\ntheir credentials or their criteria for\ndetermining urgency and impact.\n\n429\n00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.592\nSo the priority was lower\nthan it should have been.\n\n430\n00:23:08.592 --> 00:23:13.006\nThat's what I mean about understanding\nbusiness impact as you determine\n\n431\n00:23:13.006 --> 00:23:16.860\nyour priorities' structures,\nokay, all right, very good.\n\n432\n00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.800\nCan you match up this incident\nwith other tools, right?\n\n433\n00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.160\nSome of them are well known.\n\n434\n00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.700\nPerhaps you have a known-error database.\n\n435\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.070\nIf someone calls and\n\n436\n00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:31.980\nsays, I can't print to printer A,\nwhat would be your recommendation?\n\n437\n00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, first I'd say, obviously\nwe'd start with troubleshooting 101,\n\n438\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.210\nare you plugged in, is it turned on?\n\n439\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.300\nIs there paper in it?\n\n440\n00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.830\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Very simple things.\n\n441\n00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:45.380\nIf we got beyond that, I would immediately\ngo to my change management, look and see.\n\n442\n00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.940\nDoes printer A have a problem?\n\n443\n00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.670\nDo the eople have trouble printing to it?\n\n444\n00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.252\nIs there a known issue with that printer?\n\n445\n00:23:50.252 --> 00:23:53.394\nAnd you're a new employee,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n446\n00:23:53.394 --> 00:23:56.703\nA lot of the outside factors come into\nplay on how you would progress after\n\n447\n00:23:56.703 --> 00:23:57.578\nthe simple stuff.\n\n448\n00:23:57.578 --> 00:23:58.306\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n449\n00:23:58.306 --> 00:24:00.968\nAnd right, and what you suggested, Daniel,\n\n450\n00:24:00.968 --> 00:24:05.009\nis that you go to a known methodical\nway to see have we seen this before?\n\n451\n00:24:05.009 --> 00:24:10.350\nAre there maybe have a troubleshooting\nscript basically that helps you get there.\n\n452\n00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.030\nYou could also be anticipating\nthe workaround pretty quickly too.\n\n453\n00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.010\nCan't print to your printer a?\n\n454\n00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.490\nThe workaround it is print\nto print to printer b.\n\n455\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.613\nThat happens to be in Jamaica, okay.\n\n456\n00:24:20.613 --> 00:24:21.598\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They'll mail it to you.\n\n457\n00:24:21.598 --> 00:24:22.510\n[LAUGH] They'll mail it to you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n458\n00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.020\nobviously I work around CBD,\nrelevant in timely for the end user.\n\n459\n00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.190\nBut honestly sometimes\nit's just that easy,\n\n460\n00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.970\nsay really sorry you can't\nprint I'll be looking into it.\n\n461\n00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.120\nMeanwhile, how quickly do you need this,\nright?\n\n462\n00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.690\nIf you need to print right away,\n\n463\n00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.280\nthere's one right around the corner\nin the office, printer b.\n\n464\n00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.250\nHere, I'll help you install it, right?\n\n465\n00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.752\nSo that particular user's gonna call and\nsay, thank you very much, I did.\n\n466\n00:24:42.752 --> 00:24:45.300\nI was on my way to a meeting,\nI had to print this.\n\n467\n00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.350\nThe printer a wouldn't work,\nat least you got me to my meeting on time.\n\n468\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.640\nAnd then you go worry about how\nwe're gonna fix this printer a for\n\n469\n00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.940\nthe situation, right?\n\n470\n00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.070\nKnowing how to handle those types of\nincidents, incident matching with incident\n\n471\n00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:02.370\nresolution is key to the efficient\nuse of this process.\n\n472\n00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.930\nAgain, problem management can help here.\n\n473\n00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:08.360\nProblem management can be\nthe process that deliberately and,\n\n474\n00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:14.750\nmethodically, maintains a nullinary\ndatabase, along with the work arounds.\n\n475\n00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.790\n&gt;&gt; And don't be afraid to think outside\nthe box, you know, sometimes if plan b\n\n476\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.330\ndoesn't work, there's something completely\nwrong, they're running that meeting.\n\n477\n00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.360\nIn my personal, like, day-to-day life,\n\n478\n00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.860\nI would say, email me that document,\nI'll print it, and bring it to you.\n\n479\n00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.417\n&gt;&gt; If that's possible.\n\n480\n00:25:27.417 --> 00:25:29.090\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right.\n\n481\n00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.430\nSomething like that,\njust try to find the quick and\n\n482\n00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:36.130\ndirty if it's really sense that we're\nin an intensive critical type of thing.\n\n483\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.190\nTry to find something,\nanything that will do for now.\n\n484\n00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.040\nAnd then you can jump\non the problem later.\n\n485\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.640\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, of course,\nthe overall premise here\n\n486\n00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.920\nis that it should not be extraordinary\neffort to satisfy the customers.\n\n487\n00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.130\nIt should be ordinary effort\nto satisfy the customers.\n\n488\n00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.470\nCertainly if you must\noperate extraordinarily and\n\n489\n00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.390\nbe a hero, print it yourself and\nwalk it over to them.\n\n490\n00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.470\nIf that's possible,\nthat you're a hero for a day.\n\n491\n00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.370\nThat's obviously not sustainable.\n\n492\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.440\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n493\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.400\nnot a long term solution to the problem.\n\n494\n00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo\n\n495\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:10.150\ncoming up with incident models to describe\nwhen you can operate with that level\n\n496\n00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.650\nof urgency or when you should operate\nthat level of urgency and when you can't.\n\n497\n00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:14.884\nObviously if you're in Jamaica.\n\n498\n00:26:14.884 --> 00:26:16.265\n&gt;&gt; Buy a lot of stamps.\n\n499\n00:26:16.265 --> 00:26:18.595\n&gt;&gt; Buy a lot of stamps, exactly.\n\n500\n00:26:18.595 --> 00:26:19.824\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n501\n00:26:19.824 --> 00:26:21.390\nmake sure you have that good\nrelationship with FedEx or\n\n502\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.560\nwhoever that might be, that's right.\n\n503\n00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.000\n&gt;&gt; They'll love you after that.\n\n504\n00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.650\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n505\n00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.460\nSo you're prioritizing,\nyou're categorizing, and\n\n506\n00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.930\nnow you want to get to diagnosis and\n\n507\n00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:36.290\nthis initial diagnosis is really very\nquick, all these steps we've talked about.\n\n508\n00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:41.165\nLogging it, prioritizing it,\ncategorizing it,\n\n509\n00:26:41.165 --> 00:26:46.660\nis all happening in the very first few\nseconds of the call if you will, right?\n\n510\n00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.010\nIt could be that this is something you\nimmediately recognize as the service desk\n\n511\n00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.090\ntechnician say, yep,\nI saw this earlier today.\n\n512\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.560\nHere's the work around.\n\n513\n00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.240\nSo, you know you're going to solve it.\n\n514\n00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:03.440\nYou have reasonable expectations that you\ncan solve this issue, which is great.\n\n515\n00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.000\nIt also might be the opposite.\n\n516\n00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.707\nIt might be, my gosh,\nI got 50 calls in the last two and\n\n517\n00:27:09.707 --> 00:27:13.674\na half minutes all related to\nthe submit button's not there.\n\n518\n00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:19.650\nSo, you, God we've got to fix this quick,\ncuz it's impacting lots of users.\n\n519\n00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.340\nWe're not sure why it is.\n\n520\n00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.600\nI need to escalate this.\n\n521\n00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.190\nSo you're gonna do something initially\nto determine, can I fix this?\n\n522\n00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.470\nAnd operate under the assumption you can.\n\n523\n00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.360\nBut if you can't,\nyou need to also quickly escalate it.\n\n524\n00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.940\nAgain, all about speed, right?\n\n525\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.700\nSo should you escalate?\n\n526\n00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.750\nNow, I kinda learned,\nlet me get my pointer here.\n\n527\n00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:47.330\nI kinda learned here is that this\npart of the flow chart over here,\n\n528\n00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:54.410\nit just kinda points to\nthe inefficiencies of a flow chart\n\n529\n00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.740\nto show mutually inclusive path.\n\n530\n00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.580\nWhat I mean by that is,\nyou can have a functional escalation and\n\n531\n00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.270\na hierarchic escalation at the same time.\n\n532\n00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.300\nThey are not mutually exclusive.\n\n533\n00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.520\nThey can happen in parallel, they can\nhappen at slightly different times.\n\n534\n00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.360\nYou might start off\nthe functional escalation and\n\n535\n00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.310\nthen come to a hierarchic escalation.\n\n536\n00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.170\nSo, let's remind ourselves what these are.\n\n537\n00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:20.850\nA functional escalation is just passing\nit to the right technical experts, right?\n\n538\n00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.060\nYou send it to the application team or\nyou send it to the network team.\n\n539\n00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.830\nThat's a functional escalation.\n\n540\n00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.620\nIt's leaving the service desk and\ngoing to level one, level two,\n\n541\n00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.470\nlevel three,\nin the appropriate areas, right?\n\n542\n00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:34.700\nThat's functional.\n\n543\n00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.250\nA hierarchical escalation is\nan escalation up the chain of command.\n\n544\n00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.430\nRight?\nYou're sending it to\n\n545\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.740\nupper level management.\n\n546\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.420\nMaybe because you want to get the right\nsense of urgency understood, or\n\n547\n00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.630\nyou want to inform them so\n\n548\n00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:51.070\nthat they're not blindsided by\nan issue that's effecting 2,000 users.\n\n549\n00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.740\nYou don't want your IT manager saying,\nI didn't even know about that, right?\n\n550\n00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.730\nYou want them to be\ninformed over such things.\n\n551\n00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.490\nSo, again,\nthese aren't mutually exclusive choices.\n\n552\n00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:04.820\nWhen you're sitting here at\nthe initial diagnosis step and\n\n553\n00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.750\nyou are considering if you can solve it or\nnot.\n\n554\n00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.984\nIf you determine you can't solve it,\nthen you're gonna escalate it.\n\n555\n00:29:10.984 --> 00:29:12.320\nRight, simple as that.\n\n556\n00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.700\nChances are, in most cases,\nyou're just escalating functionally.\n\n557\n00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.690\nBut for some incidents, or\n\n558\n00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.690\nif they last a long time, you may\nactually do a hierarchical escalation.\n\n559\n00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.100\nAgain, to get the right sense of urgency,\nlight the right fires under the right\n\n560\n00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.010\nchairs, so to speak, or\nto just inform them of what's going on.\n\n561\n00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.994\nOkay.\n\n562\n00:29:30.994 --> 00:29:35.081\nAnd then, beyond that,\nbeyond the escalation points,\n\n563\n00:29:35.081 --> 00:29:39.341\nyou also have the full deep\ndive investigation diagnosis,\n\n564\n00:29:39.341 --> 00:29:45.406\nassuming you didn't take care of it at the\nInitial diagnosis and got it nailed away.\n\n565\n00:29:45.406 --> 00:29:47.325\nIf you had to finally go and escalate it,\n\n566\n00:29:47.325 --> 00:29:50.720\nthen you're going to have the deeper\ndive into the diagnosis, right?\n\n567\n00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.210\nSo here, again, you still staying\nwith the same sort of question.\n\n568\n00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.640\nWho's this affecting?\n\n569\n00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.830\nThis is basic trouble shooting.\n\n570\n00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.660\nIs it geographically located?\n\n571\n00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.370\nIs it happening all over the world?\n\n572\n00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.790\nIs it happening just in our spot?\n\n573\n00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.010\nIs it just these new users or\nis it every users.\n\n574\n00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:10.712\nCharacterizing the incident in those\nthings, and maybe doing a knowledge based\n\n575\n00:30:10.712 --> 00:30:13.871\nsearch to find out if there's any\nbackground information on these,\n\n576\n00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:15.513\ntrying to get these things back up.\n\n577\n00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:18.770\nAnd again, escalating this is appropriate.\n\n578\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:19.270\nOkay.\n\n579\n00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.930\nHopefully you resolve and recover,\nyou find the answer, and you get it fixed.\n\n580\n00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.332\nAn incident might last five minutes,\nan incident might last five days,\n\n581\n00:30:27.332 --> 00:30:29.790\nan incident might last five months, right?\n\n582\n00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:34.134\nThere is no known timeline to\nany given incident depending on\n\n583\n00:30:34.134 --> 00:30:36.356\nthe complexity of it, right?\n\n584\n00:30:36.356 --> 00:30:41.530\nAll right, Who closes incidents?\n\n585\n00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.172\nInteresting question here.\n\n586\n00:30:44.172 --> 00:30:47.070\nWe're gonna challenge this just a little\nbut from the course makers here.\n\n587\n00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:50.630\nService desk must close all incidents.\n\n588\n00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.870\nAll incidents that come to the service\ndesk must be closed by the service desk.\n\n589\n00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.830\nThat's what this means,\nand that is very clear.\n\n590\n00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:59.430\nRight.\n\n591\n00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.420\nIf it starts at the service desk,\nin other words,\n\n592\n00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.460\na user calls the service desk, the service\ndesk will take care of closure.\n\n593\n00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.400\nHere's why.\n\n594\n00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.300\nFirst of all, ITEL preaches this very\nconsistently, that the service desk is\n\n595\n00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:15.490\nthe single point of contact\nbetween the service and the users.\n\n596\n00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:21.565\nWith that single point of contact,\nthe users feel well cared for.\n\n597\n00:31:24.132 --> 00:31:29.660\nIt's kind of disrupting to a user to\nget a call from a backend techno geek.\n\n598\n00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.820\nSays yeah, we took care of\nthe flamajobby and boobahicky,\n\n599\n00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.650\nand I know you don't know\nwhat a flamabobby and\n\n600\n00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:36.830\ndoohicky are, but your flamabobby and\ndoohicky are really messed up.\n\n601\n00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And of course, the end user is saying,\n\n602\n00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:43.385\nI don't know what a flamabobby is, I said,\nI couldn't find the Submit button, right.\n\n603\n00:31:43.385 --> 00:31:45.202\nI don't need the flamabobby explanation,\nright.\n\n604\n00:31:45.202 --> 00:31:49.069\nSo the service desk manages\nthat kind of communication,\n\n605\n00:31:49.069 --> 00:31:51.978\nsometimes better than the back end folks.\n\n606\n00:31:51.978 --> 00:31:55.924\nIf it's better or worse, the thing is,\nit's consistent for the users.\n\n607\n00:31:55.924 --> 00:32:01.280\nThey know they call the service desk,\nthe service desk closes it up, right.\n\n608\n00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.851\nMakes sense?\n\n609\n00:32:01.851 --> 00:32:02.713\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n610\n00:32:02.713 --> 00:32:07.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, as you close, you're\nalso gonna check the categorization.\n\n611\n00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.550\nMake sure the satisfactions in place,\ndid we fix it right?\n\n612\n00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:13.840\nSo, resolving and\nclosing are not quite the same.\n\n613\n00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.350\nYou think you've resolved\na little fallacies.\n\n614\n00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.660\nWe think we've got the cement back,\nbut is it all right with you?\n\n615\n00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.800\nRight, that sort of thing.\n\n616\n00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I used to always tell people that\nI worked with, if it doesn't come back in\n\n617\n00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.730\na week, and I don't hear from you in\na week, I know that it's done, right?\n\n618\n00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.370\nIt's gone.\nIf not, give me a call, and even then,\n\n619\n00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.630\nI probably would call him back and\nsay, hey just checking in making\n\n620\n00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.040\nsure you didn't forget to-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n621\n00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.596\n&gt;&gt; Forget to not call me.\n\n622\n00:32:37.596 --> 00:32:38.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n623\n00:32:38.313 --> 00:32:38.990\n&gt;&gt; Forget to call me,\n\n624\n00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.940\nbecause the incident did come back-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n625\n00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.600\n&gt;&gt; And\njust wanted to verify it was all good.\n\n626\n00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.380\nAnd then once I heard\nthat verbal confirmation,\n\n627\n00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.900\nI would then close the ticket.\n\n628\n00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.270\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, good call, and that's perfect.\n\n629\n00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:50.830\nThat's the way it should be.\n\n630\n00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.710\nKeep in mind that not all incidents\ngo through the service desk.\n\n631\n00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:59.580\nIt's possible for potentially a event\nis detecting disc is 75% full.\n\n632\n00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:03.840\nYou might automate the detection of,\nI mean, the detection would be automated,\n\n633\n00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.720\nyou might automate the response to send\na ticket to the server team directly.\n\n634\n00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.080\nRight, it does not have the necessarily,\nwe go through the services.\n\n635\n00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.940\nYou still get visible work,\nyou still have a ticket,\n\n636\n00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.140\nyou just didn't bother\nthe service desk for the call.\n\n637\n00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.300\nIt's not an end user that's making\nthe call, all right, it's IT folks,\n\n638\n00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:24.050\nso the protecting the relationship\nbetween the service desk,\n\n639\n00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.930\nand the customer is not in play there.\n\n640\n00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:30.450\nSo, it could be that when you close\nan incident that happens all on the back,\n\n641\n00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.090\nyou close it all on the back.\n\n642\n00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:36.080\nI think the important distinction\nhere is the person that initiated it,\n\n643\n00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.950\nlogged the ticket, should be the one that\ncloses it down to make sure it's nice and\n\n644\n00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:44.956\neasy, also tidy, all right?\n\n645\n00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:48.640\nOkay, moving past here.\n\n646\n00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.730\nLet's take a few minutes to reflect on\n\n647\n00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.790\nwhat you might need to\nmake this successful.\n\n648\n00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:01.180\nSo, certainly having a tool\nset that supports this,\n\n649\n00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.820\nto keep up with all these data points.\n\n650\n00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.540\nYou're gonna log each of these incidents.\n\n651\n00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.790\nSo having a history of them, being able\nto link those incidents to problem\n\n652\n00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.780\nmanagement, which we're\ngonna talk in some detail.\n\n653\n00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.960\nIt's also very empowering.\n\n654\n00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.050\nIncident categories, being safe and\n\n655\n00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:18.660\nsecure about those, you don't\nthe category creep that I talked about.\n\n656\n00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.220\nEveryone understands them,\nand categorizes correctly.\n\n657\n00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:26.880\nHaving diagnostic scripts ready to go, so\nyou can quickly resolve issues, right?\n\n658\n00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.160\nIt's all about speed and\nfulfillment and resolution, right?\n\n659\n00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:35.320\nAs we talked about before, having a tool\nset, that represents these challenges of\n\n660\n00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:40.662\ntimes scale, record keeping, linkage\nto problem management, very important.\n\n661\n00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:47.040\nAll right,\ncritical success factors and KPIs.\n\n662\n00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.980\nI'm going to make a habit out\nof the way I present these.\n\n663\n00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:54.180\nWhat I mean by that is, as we go through\neach of these five processes, I want you\n\n664\n00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:59.820\nto focus on critical success factors and\nKPIs as a method of review, right?\n\n665\n00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:05.490\nAnd what I mean by that after this\nis done, and you're preparing for\n\n666\n00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:08.030\nthe exam, and you're in self-study mode.\n\n667\n00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:12.600\nGoing to critical success factors and\nKPIs is a very valuable place to go.\n\n668\n00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.550\nIf you can understand\nthe critical success factors and\n\n669\n00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:22.090\nthe KPIs that support those critical\nsuccess factors, deeply, full lights on,\n\n670\n00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:25.220\ncompletely understand them,\nthen you have a good grasp of this topic.\n\n671\n00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.470\nIf, on the other hand,\nyou read the critical success factor and\n\n672\n00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:34.230\nit's kinda fuzzy, or the KPIs don't seem\nto support that critical success factor,\n\n673\n00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:37.470\nthen you may need to bone up\non that a little bit more.\n\n674\n00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.770\nRead up, and make sure you have it solid.\n\n675\n00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:44.020\nSo, I'm going to use this as an example\nfor a good way to come back and\n\n676\n00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.210\nstudy, and these resources\nare available in the downloads.\n\n677\n00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:51.240\nWhen you get the downloads,\nyou can get access to these same\n\n678\n00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:57.870\nAbbreviated formats CSFs and KPIs.\n\n679\n00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:03.050\nSo, if you look at this one,\none critical success factor of management\n\n680\n00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:06.950\nis to increase communication about the\nincidents to IT staff and the business.\n\n681\n00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.360\nIncrease communication, right?\n\n682\n00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.710\nWe've been talking about interface\nwithin users all this time.\n\n683\n00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.880\nNotice that it's not\njust with the business.\n\n684\n00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.880\nIt's so that IT staff can\nunderstand these things, too.\n\n685\n00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.750\nWe talked about known errors or\ndiagnostic scripts, those types of things.\n\n686\n00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.908\nMaking sure you're communicating\nwhat's going on [INAUDIBLE]\n\n687\n00:36:25.908 --> 00:36:27.280\nis pretty important, right?\n\n688\n00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.690\nIf I got one ticket for\nthe submit button can't be found,\n\n689\n00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:34.510\nanother technician in the same room gets\nanother one, we've gotta correlate that.\n\n690\n00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.290\nHey, did you get that incident\nabout the submit button, right?\n\n691\n00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.330\nAll of a sudden,\nyou're just sharing among the team.\n\n692\n00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.680\nAnd then this course can\nescalate to the backend.\n\n693\n00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.280\nThe backend's telling the front end,\n\n694\n00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.110\nthe service desk the status\nof the research, right?\n\n695\n00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.960\nYeah, we did take it away this weekend.\n\n696\n00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.440\nAnd so, you update the ticket.\n\n697\n00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.530\nWe found the root cause is that\nwe removed it during a change.\n\n698\n00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.590\nYou communicate that to end users,\nyou can provide the work around.\n\n699\n00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:58.770\nCommunication's all in the back,\ncommunication's all in the front.\n\n700\n00:36:58.770 --> 00:36:59.920\nVital, right?\n\n701\n00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.610\nYou can see why that is\na critical success factor.\n\n702\n00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.870\nYou see, that's what I mean.\n\n703\n00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.440\nThese critical success factors can\nreinforce what we learned before.\n\n704\n00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.970\nIf you can read those and articulate why\nthat's important, you're in a good place.\n\n705\n00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.370\nOf course, KPIs are the measurements\nthat back up that.\n\n706\n00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.920\nSo, in that first example,\n\n707\n00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.610\nincrease communication about incidents\nto IT staff and the business.\n\n708\n00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.730\nA KPI is number of business\nuser complaints about incident\n\n709\n00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.700\ncommunication, right?\n\n710\n00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.710\nDo you get complaints about it?\n\n711\n00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:31.910\nOr, number of calls to report\na previously detected incident, right?\n\n712\n00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:36.020\nIf you're communicating well,\nwhy are they calling back?\n\n713\n00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.420\nRight, so\nit kinda reflects those kinda things.\n\n714\n00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.050\nSo, if you get an incident\nabout the submit button, and\n\n715\n00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:45.930\nyou provide the work around, and\nyou still get information about the,\n\n716\n00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:50.170\nor people call and say I can't find\nthe report menu, where's the report menu?\n\n717\n00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.040\nThen maybe your instructions\nweren't good enough.\n\n718\n00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.550\nYour communications weren't good enough.\n\n719\n00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.930\nSee back and forth.\n\n720\n00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.220\nSo, when I get to these,\nI'm gonna use shorthand.\n\n721\n00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.830\nWhen I get to these for\nall the other processes,\n\n722\n00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:04.930\nI'm not gonna read you the 15\nbullet points on here, right?\n\n723\n00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:09.280\nI want you to consider this as a greater\npoint of review and questions.\n\n724\n00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.520\nIf you can come to your\ncritical success factors and\n\n725\n00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.080\nKPIs as your first point of\nreview on any given process, and\n\n726\n00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.660\nyou understand everything on the page, all\ncritical success factors and all KPIs, and\n\n727\n00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:26.230\ncan tell a story about why those are\nimportant you understand the process well.\n\n728\n00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.850\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff.\n\n729\n00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:30.130\nWell, Terry, man, this has been\na great session, a great dialogue when\n\n730\n00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.610\nit comes to incident management, and\nwhat we need to know for the exam, and\n\n731\n00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.960\njust what we need to know really in\npracticum, to be honest with you.\n\n732\n00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.480\nThe exam seems to be very practical and\npragmatic.\n\n733\n00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.809\nIn its approach to this information,\nyou've done a great job of conveying that\n\n734\n00:38:41.809 --> 00:38:45.258\nto us, what we need to know, so that we\ncan answer those questions successfully.\n\n735\n00:38:45.258 --> 00:38:48.180\nThat being said, it looks like we\nare out of time for this episode,\n\n736\n00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.200\nbut man, it was good.\n\n737\n00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.290\nWe do appreciate you stopping by,\nwe appreciate you good people for\n\n738\n00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.830\njoining us as well, and\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n739\n00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:57.170\nFor ITPro.TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n740\n00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n741\n00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.426\n&gt;&gt; And we'll will see you next time.\n\n742\n00:39:00.426 --> 00:39:06.241\n[MUSIC]\n\n743\n00:39:06.241 --> 00:39:11.009\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.320\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.850\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.880\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.280\nwe are moving on with more on\nour ITIL OSA Series, of course.\n\n8\n00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.554\nAnd, of course, joining us back in\nthe studio is our mentor in endeavors,\n\n9\n00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:29.800\nand our good friend Mr.\nTerry Decker, Terry, welcome back, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.750\nHow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.880\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here, Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.710\nYep, everything's going great,\ngot a lot to learn.\n\n13\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.430\nWe have gone through one process,\nincident management.\n\n14\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.910\nAnd now we're looking to take\na look at problem management,\n\n15\n00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.710\nwhich is the more deliberative process.\n\n16\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.300\nSo, let's have a look, let's dig in here,\nlet's look at this first slide here.\n\n17\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.480\nThe purpose of problem management\nis clearly identified there.\n\n18\n00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.710\nBasically, you're trying to\nminimize just when stuff happens,\n\n19\n00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.800\nthat it's not terrible.\n\n20\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.360\nThat as you quickly get these things,\nand you reduce the underlying problems,\n\n21\n00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.770\nand find the root cause.\n\n22\n00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.200\nSo whereas, instant management is trying\nto restore services as quickly as\n\n23\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.000\npossible, they may be wanting to\nreboot that server really quickly.\n\n24\n00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.830\nProblem management may be saying,\nhey, wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n25\n00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.680\nI gotta get those logs,\nI gotta look deeper in that.\n\n26\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.670\nAnd problem management is also\nlooking at the incident management\n\n27\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.750\nlandscape at large.\n\n28\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.230\nSeeing if there's any trends going on,\n\n29\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.410\nthat may indicate that there's some\nunderlying issue that we're not attacking.\n\n30\n00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.230\nSo, you can help the incidents\nget resolved more quickly,\n\n31\n00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.760\nthrough known error management and\nworkarounds.\n\n32\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.320\nYou can also help instant management\n\n33\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.260\nbe more effective by not even\nletting the incidents come back.\n\n34\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.800\nThat's really what it's about.\n\n35\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.200\nSo, what this really means is that you're\nincreasing the meantime between failures.\n\n36\n00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.620\nThese things don't fail, right, so,\nyou get higher service availability.\n\n37\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.380\nSo, as instant management restores\nservices as quickly as possible,\n\n38\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.380\nproblem management says,\nlet's not have as many failures.\n\n39\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.110\nLet's not have these opportunities where\nwe have to restore service, right?\n\n40\n00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.320\nTherefore, the business values, you're\ngoing to increase service productivity,\n\n41\n00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.600\nlead to staff productivity,\nand lower overall costs.\n\n42\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.334\nAs you take an exam, considering the value\nstatement for problem management,\n\n43\n00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:13.519\ncould come into play.\n\n44\n00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.540\nMeaning you're not just\ndoing problem management,\n\n45\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.500\nbecause it's got cool techniques,\nand smart people work there, and\n\n46\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.510\nget to beat up instant management people.\n\n47\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.440\nWhat it means is that it has some\nsort of business value, and as\n\n48\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.460\nwe go through all these processes, we need\nto always come back to that touch stone.\n\n49\n00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.460\nWhy do we do this for the business?\n\n50\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.110\nAgain, that's ITIL all day long,\nvalue to customers.\n\n51\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.766\nRight, so understanding how problem\nmanagement provides value to customers,\n\n52\n00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:44.336\nis to make sure there are fewer\ndisruptions over time, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:49.376\nSo, as with incident management or\nany process,\n\n54\n00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:53.085\nyou need to have some solid\nbacking with policies, right?\n\n55\n00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:55.915\nAnd we're gonna look at some\nof these techniques and\n\n56\n00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:57.955\nbasic concepts as we go through here.\n\n57\n00:02:57.955 --> 00:03:02.065\nBut again, the overall concept of\ngovernance of these processes simply means\n\n58\n00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:05.750\nthat you don't just stand up a process and\nhope people follow it.\n\n59\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.930\nYou put some policy behind\nit that instructs people,\n\n60\n00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.750\nthat they should and\nhow they go about doing that.\n\n61\n00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.610\nThe reporting chains, the techniques,\n\n62\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.230\nthe type of prioritization, and\nhow you spend money on what.\n\n63\n00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.960\nRight, it's what problem management's\ntrying to help out with.\n\n64\n00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.610\nProblem management has two activities in\na large sense, proactive and reactive.\n\n65\n00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.810\nCertainly reactive is you've had 50\npeople call the service desk that says\n\n66\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.050\nI can't find the submit button, right?\n\n67\n00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.370\nThe service desk is getting just whammed,\ngetting hit hard by these calls coming in.\n\n68\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.100\nSo, problem management needs\nto take a deeper dive.\n\n69\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.900\nLooking in,\nat this as these instance still rolling.\n\n70\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.740\nThey may realize, okay, I'm not sure\nwhy it's gone or why it's missing.\n\n71\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.040\nBut here's a workaround,\nthat's problem management at work.\n\n72\n00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.900\nHere's a workaround.\n\n73\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.490\nGo to the report menu, and\nclick submit as an example, right?\n\n74\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.300\nSo, that's reactive.\n\n75\n00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.110\nProactive could be where you have seen\nissues in one area, one service area,\n\n76\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.980\nand you realize that maybe that issue\ncould be happening in other areas.\n\n77\n00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.140\nSo, rather than wait for that issue\nto manifest itself in problems, or\n\n78\n00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.600\nin outages, you go to those other\nareas and shore it up, fix it, right?\n\n79\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.470\nSo, as we also talked about incidents,\nwe talked about incident models.\n\n80\n00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.930\nPredefined steps for\nhandling particular kind of incidents.\n\n81\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.870\nWell, problem models exist, too.\n\n82\n00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.630\nPredefined steps for\nmanaging particular kind of problems.\n\n83\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.650\nAgain, you might go a different route\nof problem management, if it's a highly\n\n84\n00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.550\nadvantageous service, a service that's\nvery important to the business.\n\n85\n00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.810\nBusiness impact on this service is very,\nvery high if it goes away.\n\n86\n00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.660\nSo, you might spend more time\non those kinds of services.\n\n87\n00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.760\nYour problem models will describe how\nyou spend your time, on what, right?\n\n88\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.750\nOr perhaps it says if you have\na problem on the network,\n\n89\n00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.370\nwe're going to chase that\ndown to the nth degree.\n\n90\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.150\nIf it's a problem in an application,\nmaybe we won't chase it as hard.\n\n91\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.600\nIt's a matter of coming up with\nthe right efforts at the right time for\n\n92\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.760\nthe right kinds of problems, right?\n\n93\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.410\nAnd there are some other words,\nwe got this from foundation course,\n\n94\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.470\na known error.\n\n95\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.420\nUnderstanding a root cause of\nan issue is one of the primary\n\n96\n00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.550\nactivities of problem management.\n\n97\n00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.380\nAnd then logging that known error.\n\n98\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.470\nHaving the known error in\na place that is accessible.\n\n99\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.110\nJust to give you an example here.\n\n100\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.670\nIf you know that the submit\nbutton is missing, right?\n\n101\n00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.370\nYou have an known error.\n\n102\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.420\nYou may not be sure why it's missing yet,\nbut you know it's missing.\n\n103\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.840\nAnd you also know what the work around it.\n\n104\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.550\nSo, publish the known error, get everyone\nunderstood what the known error is.\n\n105\n00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.660\nWe know the submit button is missing.\n\n106\n00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.310\nAnd we know that we got a work around\nhere, which is go to the report menu and\n\n107\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.610\nclick submit.\n\n108\n00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.360\nSo, we got it going.\n\n109\n00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.280\nWe're not sure what's broken behind it,\nbut\n\n110\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.210\nwe have a way we gotta go fix it, right?\n\n111\n00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.900\nMeantime, the known error\nthere is streamlining\n\n112\n00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.660\nthe instant management process.\n\n113\n00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.770\nWhen a technician at the service desk\nreceives a call about the submit button,\n\n114\n00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.210\nhe doesn't have to go through\nthe trouble of troubleshooting again.\n\n115\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.770\nThe known error exists.\n\n116\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.910\nDon't waste your time with a lot of\nquestions, and answers with the user.\n\n117\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.340\nYou're wasting the user's time,\nyour wasting the service desk time.\n\n118\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.410\nThis known error can speed up that\nprocess because you've identified it.\n\n119\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.500\nAnd of course, keep these known\nerrors in a place that's accessible,\n\n120\n00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500\nthe known error database.\n\n121\n00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.620\nThat's also in the remit\nof problem management,\n\n122\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.000\nmaintaining this known error database, so\nthat the technicians can easily get to it.\n\n123\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.920\nAs an example,\nservice desks I've worked on,\n\n124\n00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.590\nas the shifts came into the service desk,\n\n125\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.110\ntheir first activity when they came to\nwork was to read the known error database.\n\n126\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.330\nAnd the most recent\nadditions are at the top.\n\n127\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.910\nSo, as those technicians reading down\nthrough the node in your database,\n\n128\n00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.300\neventually, he'll get to ones he\nrecognizes from the day before,\n\n129\n00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.340\nthe week before, whatever, right.\n\n130\n00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.060\nAnd again, someone calls him and\nsays, hey, I got this issue.\n\n131\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.115\n[SOUND] I just read about that on the node\nin your database, don't waste your time\n\n132\n00:06:57.115 --> 00:07:00.824\nwith a bunch of question and answers,\nyou know where you're at, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:00.824 --> 00:07:04.960\nSo, problem management can help streamline\nthe instant management process by\n\n134\n00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.690\nproviding good knowledge\nat the right time, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.660\nAll right, so, instant management restores\nservices as quickly as possible, problem\n\n136\n00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.130\nmanagement getting to the root cause,\nand making sure they don't come back.\n\n137\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.460\nSo, here's some of the techniques.\n\n138\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.148\nAnd I'm not gonna go over all these,\nI'll use a couple as examples.\n\n139\n00:07:22.148 --> 00:07:24.580\nBut you'll see in your exercises,\n\n140\n00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.400\nthere are good explanations\nof all these techniques.\n\n141\n00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.930\nBut a problem manager is going to take an\napproach at whatever level is important.\n\n142\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.215\nAnd some of them are kind of deep dives.\n\n143\n00:07:35.215 --> 00:07:40.230\nKepner-Tregoe's technique,\nwhere you're really getting deep.\n\n144\n00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.289\nMaybe it's a wide expansive big problem\nthat needs deep analysis, right?\n\n145\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.728\nPain value analysis,\npretty straightforward.\n\n146\n00:07:47.728 --> 00:07:49.592\nIs this worth chasing, right,\n\n147\n00:07:49.592 --> 00:07:52.986\nwhat's the effort that's gonna\nbe required to fix this?\n\n148\n00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:54.650\nHow much pain is it causing?\n\n149\n00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.781\nBut sometimes,\nyou just live with a little pain.\n\n150\n00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:58.065\nRight?\nThat kind of thing,\n\n151\n00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:00.180\nso it's kinda an approach\nto problem solving, but\n\n152\n00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.920\nlet's have a look at a couple\nof these techniques.\n\n153\n00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.990\nFirst, this is just one Pareto Analysis.\n\n154\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.040\nPareto Analysis is really\njust a way to arrange data\n\n155\n00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.940\nin a meaningful way where the highest\noffenders in this are on the left.\n\n156\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.210\nYou see how this bar chart just shows a\ndecline moving from the left to the right?\n\n157\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.510\nThat's the nature of Pareto Analysis\nis that the chart itself\n\n158\n00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.990\npresents the highest\noffenders to the left.\n\n159\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.150\nEven without looking at the details, I\nrealize there's some fine print here, but\n\n160\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.310\nwhat you're seeing is which one of\nthe network failures is caused by what.\n\n161\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.740\nOn the far left, you've got network\ncontroller, on far left, I should say.\n\n162\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.900\nRight next to it,\nyou have file corruption,\n\n163\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.460\nnext to that addressing conflicts.\n\n164\n00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.750\nIn those three causes of network failures,\n\n165\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.640\nthey are the cause of more than\n80% of all network failures.\n\n166\n00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.490\nSo, where should you work\nin problem management,\n\n167\n00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.839\nwhich problem should you chase?\n\n168\n00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.120\nThe Pareto Analysis is a quick way to say,\n\n169\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.390\nhm, we should be working on these things,\nthese things over to the left,\n\n170\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.950\nbecause they are causing the majority\nof our network failures.\n\n171\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.040\nSo, Pareto Analysis gives\nyou focus to compare\n\n172\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.600\nlight offenders from the heavy offenders.\n\n173\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.758\n&gt;&gt; Terry, when it comes to the exam,\nare they gonna ask you to maybe recognize\n\n174\n00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:21.857\nwhich analysis technique would be\nbetter versus the other or [CROSSTALK]?\n\n175\n00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:24.350\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yep, that's right.\n\n176\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.540\nTalk about problem management as a whole,\nbut they could then do a compare and\n\n177\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.870\ncontrast, what should you do in this case?\n\n178\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.380\nIf it's a deep-seated problem requiring\nlots of analysis with lots of\n\n179\n00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.830\ndifferent people,\nyou're probably talking about a right?\n\n180\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.690\n&gt;&gt; If it is a technology or\nsuch as this and\n\n181\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:45.250\nyou have data regarding of the failure\nanalysis, this could be a good way to go.\n\n182\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.880\nOr they might provide a chart and say what\nto do with this, here's the data we have,\n\n183\n00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.510\nwhat would you do with this, right?\n\n184\n00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.380\nSo, another example, the Ishikawa diagram.\n\n185\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.450\nThe reason why you wanna work\na problem management is so\n\n186\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.102\nyou can say Ishikawa every day.\n\n187\n00:10:01.102 --> 00:10:02.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ishikawa Diagram, or\n\n188\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.790\notherwise known as a Fishbone Diagram, and\n\n189\n00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.070\nI think you can see why it might\nbe called a Fishbone Diagram.\n\n190\n00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.500\nIf you look on the far right here,\nyou see whatever the problem is.\n\n191\n00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.550\nLet's say the problem is network failures,\nright?\n\n192\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:20.490\nOr the problem is Bad applications, right.\n\n193\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.270\nPoor design applications,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n194\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.380\nUsers can't find submit buttons.\n\n195\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.240\nYou know, whatever this problem might be.\n\n196\n00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.760\nUsers call a lot about\nthe application interface,\n\n197\n00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.430\nright, doesn't seem to be intuitive,\nright.\n\n198\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.330\nSo you identify the problem and\nthen as you go down the spine here,\n\n199\n00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:42.720\nyou're just picking out on the possible\ncategories of causes for this problem.\n\n200\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.010\nYou can see people, process,\nequipment, materials,\n\n201\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:52.150\nenvironment, management,\nThese big bones are fairly repeatable.\n\n202\n00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.060\nOnce you get used to\nusing Ishikawa Diagram\n\n203\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.290\nyou'll probably have the same\nthings in the blue boxes.\n\n204\n00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.700\nAnd then as you go up those,\n\n205\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.980\neach one of those bones, you break those\nbones down into further bits, right?\n\n206\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.800\nThis is really good at brainstorming, so\n\n207\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.780\nif you would try to brainstorm a problem,\nthis is a great way.\n\n208\n00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.110\nGet two or three people in a room.\n\n209\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.990\nGet on a white board and start drawing\nit out and people just fire away, or\n\n210\n00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.190\nmaybe they're putting sticky\nnotes to where the bones are.\n\n211\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.190\nThat sort of thing.\n\n212\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.590\nThis could be a really effective\nway to do some brainstorming.\n\n213\n00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.880\nYou'll refine it as you\ncontinue to brainstorm and\n\n214\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.050\nthen you might see possible opportunities.\n\n215\n00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.740\nNow, just because you might go down fish,\nnow this fish is very balanced.\n\n216\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.310\nIt has one bone for\neach of the big blue boxes and\n\n217\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.920\nthen each of those bones has three\nbones coming off of it, nice and neat.\n\n218\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.782\nOne other thing in Ishikawa\ndiagrams it's never this neat.\n\n219\n00:11:43.782 --> 00:11:47.143\n&gt;&gt; Never is.\n[CROSSTALK] Looks like a big old mask.\n\n220\n00:11:47.143 --> 00:11:48.650\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER]\n\n221\n00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.280\n&gt;&gt; The nature of this beast,this\n\n222\n00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.180\nfish if you will is that it does serve\nwell in a brain storming environment and\n\n223\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.349\nalso severs well.\n\n224\n00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.380\nPerhaps, to identify your opportunities.\n\n225\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:06.470\nAnd I say perhaps because just because\nmaybe people has 20 bones off that,\n\n226\n00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.630\ndoesn't necessarily mean that's\nwhat you gotta go tackle, right.\n\n227\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.940\nAnd this is what the discussion's\ngonna bring out.\n\n228\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.380\nSo the combination of a fishbone diagram,\nperhaps with other techniques,\n\n229\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.730\nis gonna give you the fuller\nThe fuller picture.\n\n230\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:24.990\nThe overarching goal of these techniques\nis to provide a methodical repeatable\n\n231\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.716\ntechnique for facing your problems and\nresolving them.\n\n232\n00:12:28.716 --> 00:12:35.770\nAll right, very good, so\nsome approaches now to problem management.\n\n233\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.530\nAgain, we've talked about reactive,\nwe've talked about proactive.\n\n234\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.000\nVery important to keep those in play.\n\n235\n00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:45.800\nIf you have an effective\nproblem management, process.\n\n236\n00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.200\nAnd if it's purpose is to describe\nis to eliminate root causes.\n\n237\n00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.170\nIdentify and eliminate root causes,\nit can be a very prime driver for\n\n238\n00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.480\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n239\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.210\nYou're getting rid of things,\nyou are improving services.\n\n240\n00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.960\nSo problem management and\nCSI Are very, very tightly integrated.\n\n241\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.570\nProblem management can also lead\nto improvements beyond operation,\n\n242\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.180\nI mean, up the life cycle stages.\n\n243\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.050\nIt's possible for problem management\nto proactively discover that\n\n244\n00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:19.160\nthere are recurring problems from service\ndesign or from service transition.\n\n245\n00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.480\nMaybe you don't Test effectively.\n\n246\n00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.660\nMaybe the testing environments and\n\n247\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.970\nproduction environments\nare always out of sync.\n\n248\n00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.860\nSo it seems to work when you test it.\n\n249\n00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.160\nThen you put it out in operations,\nit fails.\n\n250\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.710\nMaybe that's a recurring problem, right?\n\n251\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.560\nAnd problem management can identity and\n\n252\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.570\neliminate that recurring problem\nby simply bringing it to light.\n\n253\n00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.410\nAnd putting it through\na service improvement plan.\n\n254\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:48.890\nOkay, so problem management certainly has\nlots of, triggers what gets it started.\n\n255\n00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.440\nProblem detection could be because\nyou've had major incidence.\n\n256\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.640\nThere's been a failure.\n\n257\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.877\nProblem management should definitely get\ninvolved in the deep dive analysis of\n\n258\n00:13:57.877 --> 00:14:00.360\npost-incident review.\n\n259\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.027\nWhen you talk about major incidents,\nright?\n\n260\n00:14:03.027 --> 00:14:06.760\nIntuition/sixth sense,\nvery technical term there.\n\n261\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.840\nPeople understand technology\nat a deep level, and\n\n262\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.650\nsometimes it's just I got a hunch.\n\n263\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n\n264\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n265\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.790\nI know in one case,\nI managed a learning management service.\n\n266\n00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.450\nAnd it fell over because\nI had crowded indexes.\n\n267\n00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.330\nThat's the term used to me.\n\n268\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.840\nI didn't know what crowded mean but\nindex is mean to be recompiled.\n\n269\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.310\nI'm not a data base administrator and\nthey thankfully administrator.\n\n270\n00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.050\nThat is could be why you just\nhad a nine hour outrage.\n\n271\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.220\nAnd sure enough it was, so\nI learned something that day.\n\n272\n00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.810\nI learned that I gotta take\ncare of my indexes better.\n\n273\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.440\nI gotta figure out how to do that.\n\n274\n00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.220\nThat same DVA gave me a nice\nlittle script that I could run\n\n275\n00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.820\nwhenever I was doing maintenance.\n\n276\n00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.940\nSo happy ending to that particular\nservice at that particular time.\n\n277\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.000\nBut what if I proactively Had said hm,\nI wonder if anyone else could benefit\n\n278\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.890\nfrom this knowledge I just learned\npublished some sort of article.\n\n279\n00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:02.640\nSo major incident review can help\nspread then news about how to avoid\n\n280\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.570\nsome big issues.\n\n281\n00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.350\nSo we instituted a major\nincident management\n\n282\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:15.210\nTechnique that always had this thorough\nreview, and some sort of outputs.\n\n283\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.960\nWhat were the lessons learned?\n\n284\n00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.990\nAnd all over the IT organization,\nthis is a place people turn to,\n\n285\n00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.680\nto perhaps get some good hints for\nhow they can prevent problems.\n\n286\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.270\nOr at least, how they can troubleshoot\nproblems that are currently existing.\n\n287\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.830\nAlright.\n\n288\n00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:35.000\nSo as with incidents you log problems,\nright.\n\n289\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.150\nSo if you had 50 users call saying\nI can't find the submit button,\n\n290\n00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.230\nyou've got 50 incidents, right.\n\n291\n00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.870\nWe talked yesterday in\nthe incident management\n\n292\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:50.530\nshow about how logging is important,\nbecause you don't want invisible work.\n\n293\n00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.260\nSame thing with problem management.\n\n294\n00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.555\nAnd you also want to be able to\nlink them together, if possible.\n\n295\n00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:58.825\nVery important that you understand those\nconnections between your problems and\n\n296\n00:15:58.825 --> 00:15:59.507\nyour instance.\n\n297\n00:15:59.507 --> 00:16:04.248\nSo if you've got 50 users, Complaining,\nI can't find the submit button and\n\n298\n00:16:04.248 --> 00:16:05.819\nyou have 50 incidents.\n\n299\n00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:07.003\nHow many problems do you have?\n\n300\n00:16:07.003 --> 00:16:08.170\nDo you suppose, Daniel?\n\n301\n00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:10.222\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] You have 50 incidents.\n\n302\n00:16:10.222 --> 00:16:15.400\nI have 50 incidents.\nOne, one problem.\n\n303\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay that makes sense.\n\n304\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.090\nThey problem is that the submit\nbutton isn't showing up.\n\n305\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.540\nThe incidents are the people calling in.\n\n306\n00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n307\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.420\nI'm with you.\n\n308\n00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.380\n[LAUGH] So\nit doesn't necessarily mean yeah.\n\n309\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.130\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that\n\n310\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.070\njust because you have lots of incidence,\nyou have a problem, right?\n\n311\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.460\nIt could just be the nature\nof the b's sometimes.\n\n312\n00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:40.640\nMaybe people call the service desk\nbecause they can't print to print or\n\n313\n00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.760\na, because it's out of toner cartilage,\n\n314\n00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.390\nit's been unplugged by the cleaning\nstuff that night, right.\n\n315\n00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.240\nDoes problem management have\nto get involved in that?\n\n316\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.960\nNot necessarily, right.\n\n317\n00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.100\nBut in a case where 50 users are calling\nabout the submit button being missing,\n\n318\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.300\nmaybe you do have an underlying\nproblem you gotta solve.\n\n319\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.770\nSo a problem ticket should be raised,\nright?\n\n320\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.920\nSo therefore, the incident management\nfolks, those folks at service desks, say,\n\n321\n00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.190\n\"hey we have a problem here\".\n\n322\n00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.955\nCan we get this focused on,\n\n323\n00:17:06.955 --> 00:17:11.060\nbecause the calls keep coming in\nabout this submit button, right?\n\n324\n00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:15.050\nSo problem categorization should\nbe the same categories you use in\n\n325\n00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:15.800\ninstant management.\n\n326\n00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.758\nWe talked about the importance of\ncategories and prioritization.\n\n327\n00:17:18.758 --> 00:17:23.278\nSo use the same coding system, ideally in\nyour problem management system as you do\n\n328\n00:17:23.278 --> 00:17:25.680\nin your incident management system.\n\n329\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.210\nIt's gonna let you connect the dots\nbetween them a lot more effectively.\n\n330\n00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.390\nOkay.\n\n331\n00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:36.360\nOf course prioritization is like in\nincident management, it's the impact and\n\n332\n00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.500\nemergency in the intersection\nof those two.\n\n333\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.930\nThe priorities of problems should be\nthe same priorities as the incidents that\n\n334\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.680\nunderly those problems, all right.\n\n335\n00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.490\nThis word severity is often used.\n\n336\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:57.790\nThis is getting close to understanding and\ncodifying the business impact.\n\n337\n00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.360\nIt's very similar to urgency and\nimpact to come up with a priority.\n\n338\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.320\nIt's also very common term\nto use the word severity.\n\n339\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.312\nWhat is the effect on the business for\nthis?\n\n340\n00:18:08.312 --> 00:18:09.080\nOkay.\n\n341\n00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.050\nNot going to go dive deep into the\nspecific activities of problem management.\n\n342\n00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.580\nAs you go through the exercises you\nwill get an opportunity to look at these\n\n343\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.040\ndetails but I just want to\nhighlight just a few things.\n\n344\n00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.070\nFirst of all the problem management\ncould interface with other processes.\n\n345\n00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.260\nYou'll see on this other diagram\nchange management on the left.\n\n346\n00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:31.750\nRight, certainly working with incident\nmanagement on an ongoing basis.\n\n347\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.260\nSo as you go through you're also recording\n\n348\n00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.590\nthese problems in your CMS,\nyour configuration management system.\n\n349\n00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:44.139\nJust as incident management is\nsupposed to log their activities,\n\n350\n00:18:44.139 --> 00:18:48.608\nproblem management does so and\nthey log them by connecting them to\n\n351\n00:18:48.608 --> 00:18:52.197\nthe asset that's being\naffected in the CMS, okay?\n\n352\n00:18:54.597 --> 00:18:55.930\nWORKAROUNDS.\n\n353\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.860\nProblem management is, again,\nis the deliberative process.\n\n354\n00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.650\nAnd sometimes it might just be\nsimple enough, if a user calls,\n\n355\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.130\nsays I can't print to printer a,\nmaybe the incident technician,\n\n356\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:10.100\nservice desk technician says okay,\nhere's a script to go to printer b.\n\n357\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.610\nIt could be that distant management team\ntakes care some of this low lying fruit\n\n358\n00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.100\non their own, right.\n\n359\n00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.350\nIn a perfect sense,\nin a perfect iTel island work arounds\n\n360\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.170\nare certainly deliberative process\nprovider by problem management, right.\n\n361\n00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:23.920\nSo problem management,\n\n362\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.550\ninstant management are certainly\ngonna intercept quite a bit, right.\n\n363\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:32.190\nYou may have some problem managers\nco-located with your incident managers\n\n364\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.840\nat the service desk, as an example, right.\n\n365\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.130\nIt's just a separate little process to\nlog things a little bit differently, and\n\n366\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.610\nto have the due diligence ongoing, okay?\n\n367\n00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.390\nBut the workarounds need to be\navailable for people to get to.\n\n368\n00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.530\nAnd to say, if a user calls and\n\n369\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:52.560\nsays I can't print to printer a,\nit's not necessarily good for the user or\n\n370\n00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.430\nthe service desk technician to say well\njust go head and print to printer b.\n\n371\n00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.161\nClick or hang up the phone, right.\n\n372\n00:19:58.161 --> 00:20:01.210\nYou're probably going to need\nto help that user a bit better.\n\n373\n00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.060\nThat's what work around is.\n\n374\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.120\nTo just say, print to printer b,\n\n375\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.550\nclick, you're just gonna get calls\nabout how do I install printer b.\n\n376\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.350\nHow do I that?\n\n377\n00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.480\nThat's what you-\n&gt;&gt; Exchange one problem for another.\n\n378\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n379\n00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.120\nSo the workaround is trying to\nstreamline this process and\n\n380\n00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.310\neffectively make that user\nhappy as quickly as possible.\n\n381\n00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:24.170\nSo it's not just tell the user\nto print the printer b.\n\n382\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.430\nIt's probably taking over their desktop,\nif possible, and installing it for\n\n383\n00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.260\nthem and make it a default printer.\n\n384\n00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.350\nAnd following up later,\nwhen printer a comes back online, right?\n\n385\n00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.300\nSo again,\na workaround is a known set of steps and\n\n386\n00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.320\nyou execute those steps on behalf of\nthe user or you make sure the user can\n\n387\n00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.480\neffectively execute those steps himself\nbefore you just send them on their way.\n\n388\n00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.090\nOkay?\n\n389\n00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.910\nSo a known error record,\nwe talked about this earlier.\n\n390\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:56.480\nIdentifying your known errors, when you\nhave identification of the cause, great.\n\n391\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.030\nAnd that can trigger the entry\nin the known error database.\n\n392\n00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:05.290\nThis single repository where\nincident management can come to and\n\n393\n00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.820\nquickly understand, I've seen this before.\n\n394\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.330\nHere’s a knowledge article for it.\n\n395\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.220\nHere’s what I'm going to do.\n\n396\n00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.340\nHere’s how I'm going to\nadvise the user etc.\n\n397\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:17.210\nAnd if that new database can also include\na link to that work around even better.\n\n398\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.950\nHopefully the problem\neventually gets resolved.\n\n399\n00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:28.480\nAnd of course you might fix the problem\nand then cause something else to go wrong\n\n400\n00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.050\nthat’s also possible so you just have to\nbe cautious of that you don't cause harm.\n\n401\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:37.740\nSo a lot of times, if the problem\nrequires a change of some kind,\n\n402\n00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.090\nthen that's gonna go through the\ndeliberative process of change management.\n\n403\n00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.820\nAnd if it's a critical thing going on,\nif the business impact is heavy,\n\n404\n00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.370\nthen you might have an emergency\nCAB involved in it.\n\n405\n00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.699\nAnd you don't wait for\nthe next change advisory board to meet.\n\n406\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:55.020\nSo we talked about change\nmanagement being very methodical.\n\n407\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.436\nProblem management may discover\nthe change that needs to happen,\n\n408\n00:21:58.436 --> 00:22:01.791\npass it over to the methodical\ngroup called change management and\n\n409\n00:22:01.791 --> 00:22:04.603\nthey'll take care of the due\ndiligence on the change.\n\n410\n00:22:08.434 --> 00:22:10.000\nProblem closure.\n\n411\n00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.343\nAgain after the change\nyou're gonna post a review,\n\n412\n00:22:12.343 --> 00:22:15.978\nwhat were lessons learned especially as\nit relates to major incidents, right.\n\n413\n00:22:15.978 --> 00:22:20.391\nUpdate the known error database\nif the problem is now eliminated\n\n414\n00:22:20.391 --> 00:22:23.830\nthe known error database needs to say so.\n\n415\n00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.110\nThe resolution has been applied.\n\n416\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.990\nWith got this covered no longer an issue,\nright.\n\n417\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.809\nSo, that closure, that problem should\nresult in closure of bunch of incident.\n\n418\n00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.370\nSo if you've had 50 people call\nabout that submit button and\n\n419\n00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.170\nyou had the work around for\nthe first week but\n\n420\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.200\nthen you have a change over the weekend\nthat gets the submit button back in there.\n\n421\n00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.670\nCall the user say hey, submit button's\nback, is it looking good to you?\n\n422\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.190\nYep.\n\n423\n00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:53.330\nGreat, close down the 50 tickets,\nclose down the problem, dusted.\n\n424\n00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:55.980\nGood.\n\n425\n00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.680\nAs with major incidents,\nthey lead to major problems.\n\n426\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.860\nI've seen this work in this way.\n\n427\n00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.520\nIf you have a major incident,\na problem is also raised.\n\n428\n00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.570\nPeriod, right?\n\n429\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.760\nThat's an interesting way to put it.\n\n430\n00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.660\nYou have two streams of work\nworking at the same time.\n\n431\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.910\nYou have the major incident going on,\nlet's restore service as quickly as\n\n432\n00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:20.690\npossible, but you also have\nthis major problem methodology\n\n433\n00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.860\nwhere you're going to follow up and make\nsure you get all lessons learned, etc.\n\n434\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.970\nRight.\n\n435\n00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.819\nGo back to the business,\ngo find out what the issues were.\n\n436\n00:23:26.819 --> 00:23:28.700\nWhat was that impact?\n\n437\n00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.700\nHow can we prevent this from the future,\nin the future, all right?\n\n438\n00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.400\nSo, can you discover problems anywhere\n\n439\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.540\nin the service life cycle\nthrough problem management?\n\n440\n00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.285\nThat's really what this\nslide is attesting to.\n\n441\n00:23:44.285 --> 00:23:45.610\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n442\n00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.517\nProblem management if it's\ngetting to the route cause,\n\n443\n00:23:48.517 --> 00:23:51.068\nthe route cause may be\nwe've designed it poorly.\n\n444\n00:23:51.068 --> 00:23:54.351\nWe've designed a house of cards,\nit's going to fall over every day, right.\n\n445\n00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:56.077\nThat could be what the problem discovers,\nright?\n\n446\n00:23:56.077 --> 00:23:57.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And therefore,\n\n447\n00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.592\nyou know you realized that.\n\n448\n00:23:59.592 --> 00:24:02.264\nWith eyes open,\nwe have a very sensitive situation.\n\n449\n00:24:02.264 --> 00:24:04.840\nThis is not a stable application.\n\n450\n00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.200\nWe were anticipating 500 users,\nwe have 1,500 users.\n\n451\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.310\nWe have a problem, Houston, right?\n\n452\n00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.010\nSo, how are we going to take care of this?\n\n453\n00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.920\nWe have a problem.\n\n454\n00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.810\nSo, again, that could be\nan error at the design level.\n\n455\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.040\nCapacity wasn't\nsufficiently accounted for.\n\n456\n00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.739\nWe didn't anticipate 1,500.\n\n457\n00:24:21.739 --> 00:24:24.911\nOr it could have been it was\ndesigned right, for 500 but\n\n458\n00:24:24.911 --> 00:24:26.970\nwe need some more investment.\n\n459\n00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.800\nSo it even goes back to the strategy\nlevel and say we need more investment,\n\n460\n00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.540\nbecause we built this for a lot smaller\ncapacity than what is required.\n\n461\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.910\nLife changes so to speak.\n\n462\n00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.840\nSo problem management,\nbecause it can lead to anywhere\n\n463\n00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.120\nIt can be a great prime mover for\ncontinuous improvement, okay.\n\n464\n00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.120\nInputs, certainly inputs and outputs.\n\n465\n00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.690\nInstant management if\nyou're doing proactive\n\n466\n00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.480\nproblem management maybe you're just\nlooking at service problem metrics.\n\n467\n00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.960\nmaybe your looking at the results\nof tests in transition\n\n468\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.370\nwhere you see known errors identified\nduring the transition process.\n\n469\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.440\nSo maybe you spend your time\nahead of the operation game,\n\n470\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.550\nand spend a lot of time solving\nproblems in the transition stage or\n\n471\n00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:21.200\nthe design stage with better availability\nplans, with better capacity plans, etc.\n\n472\n00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.740\nSo the inputs can come\nfrom lots of places.\n\n473\n00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.332\nThe data is out there.\n\n474\n00:25:26.332 --> 00:25:30.630\nIn ITIL world you have data hopefully\nmeasuring lots of your processes.\n\n475\n00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:35.110\nAnd that can be underpinning some of your\nproblems, right, the processes themselves.\n\n476\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.790\nOutputs, you're resolving problems,\nyou're updating problem records,\n\n477\n00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.580\nyou're maintaining\nthe known error database.\n\n478\n00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:44.740\nAnd you are also improving\nthe opportunities\n\n479\n00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.200\nthrough proactive problem management.\n\n480\n00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.150\nAll right, talked already about this.\n\n481\n00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.750\nProblem management certainly\ninterfaces with many other processes.\n\n482\n00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.360\nYou see configuration management,\nchange management,\n\n483\n00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.870\nservice level management listed here.\n\n484\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.220\nKnowledge, capacity, availability.\n\n485\n00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.980\nI would say that you could\npoint to any process,\n\n486\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.340\nall 26 processes that ITIL defines.\n\n487\n00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:14.549\nProblem management could be employed\nto do an analysis of root cause,\n\n488\n00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:16.855\nelimination for any process.\n\n489\n00:26:18.528 --> 00:26:23.500\nAll right,\nThe Configuration Management System.\n\n490\n00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.590\nYou recall from the foundation course\nthat configuration management system is\n\n491\n00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:30.020\nthe system that keeps up with\nall of your configuration items.\n\n492\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.730\nThose assets you care about\nthat help you deliver service.\n\n493\n00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:39.271\nWe're talking about servers, databases,\napplications, network components.\n\n494\n00:26:39.271 --> 00:26:43.192\nWe're also talking about documents\nlike service level agreements,\n\n495\n00:26:43.192 --> 00:26:44.460\nreports could be a CI.\n\n496\n00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:49.980\nYou could put anything under control\nin the CMSs, this collection\n\n497\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:55.745\nof databases that hold the attributes for\nthose assets.\n\n498\n00:26:55.745 --> 00:27:01.342\nProblem management could certainly\nhelp fill out the CMS but\n\n499\n00:27:01.342 --> 00:27:07.377\nproblem management could also use\nthe CMS to help troubleshoot or\n\n500\n00:27:07.377 --> 00:27:11.339\nto see how these CI are related etc, okay.\n\n501\n00:27:11.339 --> 00:27:14.138\nWe've talked a good stead about\nthe known error database.\n\n502\n00:27:14.138 --> 00:27:17.571\nCertainly you need to come up with\nsome technology that let's this be\n\n503\n00:27:17.571 --> 00:27:18.348\neasier to use.\n\n504\n00:27:18.348 --> 00:27:22.200\nPerhaps is a relational database perhaps\nis got a search engine on top of it.\n\n505\n00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.890\nSo if you wanna go to\nthe known error database and\n\n506\n00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.090\nlook up an article about printers, right?\n\n507\n00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.650\nMaybe you have some sub-categories that\ncan easily make this known error database\n\n508\n00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.770\nsearchable.\n\n509\n00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.290\nAgain, the known error database is trying\nto help the service desk be faster\n\n510\n00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.319\nat taking care of things\nwe already know about.\n\n511\n00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.875\nWhat can make this known error database\nperhaps more effective is making it\n\n512\n00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:43.730\nsearchable.\n\n513\n00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually worked in\na place creating a Wiki and\n\n514\n00:27:47.025 --> 00:27:50.330\nthen linked to the server fix,\nthe tickets, right.\n\n515\n00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.730\nSo you can see the exact verbage\nof what the problem was on it.\n\n516\n00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.216\nBut, you have a nice little Wiki,\n\n517\n00:27:55.216 --> 00:27:58.550\nhere's a problem that is known\nthat happens to our users.\n\n518\n00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.650\nHere's the root cause of it,\nhere's the resolution for it, and\n\n519\n00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.520\nhere's links to the service\ntickets that dealt with it.\n\n520\n00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.230\nIt was great, it was fantastic.\n\n521\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.100\n&gt;&gt; Very good example.\n\n522\n00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.380\nAnd again, the purpose being let's\nspeed up this process of resolving and\n\n523\n00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.700\nget these folks back up to speed.\n\n524\n00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.700\nSo speaking of speed, CSI.\n\n525\n00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.400\nIf you're trying to improve problem\nmanagement, then probably, you're\n\n526\n00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.380\ngonna be focusing on those measurements\nto talk about how fast you are.\n\n527\n00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.530\nLike how long does it take you to\nget root cause identification?\n\n528\n00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:28.340\nIt's harder to say root cause\nelimination and measure that speed,\n\n529\n00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.980\nalthough it's a good metric.\n\n530\n00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.230\nBecause once problem management\nidentifies the problem,\n\n531\n00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.400\nthat's an important milestone.\n\n532\n00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.120\nIt may take a lot longer before\nthat problem is actually removed.\n\n533\n00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.590\nIt could be investment, it could be you\ngotta wait on change management for\n\n534\n00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.240\ntwo months to get it in their queue, etc.\n\n535\n00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.680\nSo maybe a couple of different metrics for\nspeed.\n\n536\n00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.160\nPreventing problems from happening.\n\n537\n00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.190\nIf you can measure the proactivity of\nproblem management even better, right?\n\n538\n00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.720\nAnd if you do a before and\nafter picture of what you've prevented.\n\n539\n00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.040\nSo for instance, let's say you have lots\nof failures in the production environment,\n\n540\n00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.310\noperation environment because\nof inadequate testing.\n\n541\n00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.600\nAnd you've done some root cause analysis\nand realized the reason why we fail so\n\n542\n00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.120\nmuch in testing is because our\nenvironments aren't in sync.\n\n543\n00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.120\nProactively you then come up with\na way to keep environments in sync and\n\n544\n00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:25.780\nsure enough you see more success and\navailability in operations example, right?\n\n545\n00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.010\nSo looking for that correlation,\nlook for the facts and figures.\n\n546\n00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.480\nCSI and\nproblem management are very synergetic.\n\n547\n00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.670\nThey help each other.\n\n548\n00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:39.818\nIf you help proper management, problem\nmanagement will help your services.\n\n549\n00:29:39.818 --> 00:29:41.750\nAll right.\n\n550\n00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:46.190\nYou'll recall from incident management\nthat critical success factors in KPIs,\n\n551\n00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.300\nthere's a lot of verbage here.\n\n552\n00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:52.490\nAnd I'm not going to spend our\ntime reading this ferbish to you.\n\n553\n00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.790\nBut I don't want to belittle\nhow important these are.\n\n554\n00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:01.300\nAs a point of review, if you can go to\ncritical success factors in KPIs and\n\n555\n00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:05.800\nread then and\nquickly assimilate why that's critical and\n\n556\n00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.980\nhow those KPIs support that criticality\nyou're in a good place of understanding.\n\n557\n00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.240\nIf on the other hand you read\nthese critical success factors and\n\n558\n00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.630\nsay, hm, I didn't think that was\nrelated to problem management at all,\n\n559\n00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.490\nor I didn't think that was related\nto access management at all.\n\n560\n00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.800\nAll right,\nwell then you got some studying to do, or\n\n561\n00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.400\nsome questions to ask\nthe discussion forum.\n\n562\n00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.210\nSo rather than read these in minute\ndetail, I'm always gonna remind you,\n\n563\n00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:33.820\nread your critical success factors,\nread your KPIs as a first point of review.\n\n564\n00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.880\nIf you can fully understand how these work\ntogether toward that particular process\n\n565\n00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.690\nyou are in a good place of\nunderstanding that process.\n\n566\n00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:42.190\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n567\n00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.810\n&gt;&gt; Of course, there's challenges and\n\n568\n00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.220\nrisks to problem management\nas there is with any process.\n\n569\n00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.910\nCertainly challenges for\n\n570\n00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:54.050\nproblem management is you have to have\nan effective incident management process.\n\n571\n00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.220\nThey kind of work together so closely.\n\n572\n00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.930\nIf instance management\ncan not identify things,\n\n573\n00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.590\nthen how is problem management\ngoing to know about it.\n\n574\n00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:07.440\nSo it's one of the primary identification\npoints is incident management,\n\n575\n00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.820\nproblem management who should\nbe in the dark, right?\n\n576\n00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.430\nThis requires a stronger level\nof capabilities, skills and\n\n577\n00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.980\ncapabilities in problem management\nare not the same level of skills you have\n\n578\n00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.210\nat the service desk necessarily, right?\n\n579\n00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:24.070\nThe folks that work in problem management\nprobably need to have a broad and deep\n\n580\n00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.650\ncapability to understand the technology\nand the services underneath them, right?\n\n581\n00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.750\nAll right, let's consider what's next.\n\n582\n00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.360\nI described the critical assess factors\nand KPIs as a great place to study.\n\n583\n00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.210\nThere's also some directed self-study\nin the exercises that you can download.\n\n584\n00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:43.400\nIt takes you about an hour to go\nthrough these, probably a little less.\n\n585\n00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.120\nThe very definitive tools here,\n\n586\n00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.390\nthat get deeper into those\ntechniques we talked about.\n\n587\n00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:51.950\nI showed you a Pareto and\n\n588\n00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:56.800\nI showed you an Ishikawa diagram, well\nthose other techniques are also explained.\n\n589\n00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.280\nAnd you get to walk through\nthose a little bit.\n\n590\n00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.050\nHighly valuable way to get your head and\n\n591\n00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:06.670\nyour arms around this process\ncalled problem management.\n\n592\n00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.860\nI definitely encourage\nyour self study there.\n\n593\n00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.810\nAs usual come to the discussion forum and\nask questions as you wish.\n\n594\n00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.150\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, Terry.\n\n595\n00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.880\nMan, problem management, there's\na lot of information going on there.\n\n596\n00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.780\nYou did a fantastic job of explaining for\nus what we need to know, study for\n\n597\n00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.150\nthe exam, how to get that down so\nthat we know that we are prepared for\n\n598\n00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.130\nthat exam when we sit in that seat.\n\n599\n00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.240\nThat being said, we do thank you for\ndropping by today but\n\n600\n00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.780\nit looks like it's that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n601\n00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.540\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n602\n00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n603\n00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.389\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n604\n00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:43.418\n[MUSIC]\n\n605\n00:32:43.418 --> 00:32:46.689\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:13.180\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.040\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.370\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n6\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.950\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more on ITIL OSA series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.420\nAnd of course, joining us back in\nthe studio again today to help us out with\n\n8\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.780\nthat endeavor is our good friend,\nMr. Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.400\nTerry, welcome back my man,\nhow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.850\n&gt;&gt; As always, happy to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.280\nAnd got a lot to learn, as always.\n\n12\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.910\nWe've gone through a couple processes.\n\n13\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.850\nWe've gone through incident management,\nwe've gone through problem management.\n\n14\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.910\nThree more to go, in terms of processes,\nwe have event management up next.\n\n15\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.200\nAs we did with these others, we need to\nknow what it is, what is an incident,\n\n16\n00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.910\nwhat is a problem?\n\n17\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.460\nWe kind of discern those,\nbut what is an event?\n\n18\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.685\nWell, it's not just cake and\nice cream at the end of a long work week.\n\n19\n00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:58.260\nAn event is something that can\nbe automatically detected.\n\n20\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.400\nAnd perhaps provide a basis of\nautomation in response to that event.\n\n21\n00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.390\nSo let me just throw some examples at you,\nand\n\n22\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.830\nsome of these are probably\nfairly intuitive.\n\n23\n00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.950\nIf you can detect the disk storage\nutilization, the capacity,\n\n24\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.660\nand get an event automatically triggered,\nthat the disk is full.\n\n25\n00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.910\nThat's the type of an event.\n\n26\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.730\nThe disk just filled up, and it perhaps\nputs an alert in a log somewhere.\n\n27\n00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.720\nOr logs that event in a log somewhere.\n\n28\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.230\nNow you need to put something on\ntop of that log to automatically\n\n29\n00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.710\nperhaps send out an incident\nto a technician to say,\n\n30\n00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.120\nhey get this storage taken care of,\nor you can have a warning event.\n\n31\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.120\nThe disk is 75% full.\n\n32\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.112\nIs it an event when I\nlogin in the morning?\n\n33\n00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:47.737\nYou might not think that's an event but\n\n34\n00:01:47.737 --> 00:01:50.670\nyou probably have some awareness\nthat your logins are logged.\n\n35\n00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.170\nWhen you login,\nthat's tucked away somewhere.\n\n36\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.140\nSo events can be just be informational,\nand they're automatically detected.\n\n37\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.350\nThe batch file completed successfully.\n\n38\n00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.500\nThe backup was successful.\n\n39\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.790\nThe patch installed successfully.\n\n40\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.150\nThose things can be logged and\nput away for future analysis.\n\n41\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.650\nOr to, if you're doing some\ntroubleshooting it says,\n\n42\n00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.170\nwas that backup successful?\n\n43\n00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.570\nYou can go to the log and say,\nyes, it was, that kind of thing.\n\n44\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.340\nSo something is important to you,\nit's significant to you,\n\n45\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.940\nyou wanna be able to manage it so\nyou tuck away information about it.\n\n46\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.050\nOr, not just tuck it away perhaps,\nyou use it in a live environment.\n\n47\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.630\nLike I said in the disk space example.\n\n48\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.960\nWhen the disk gets 75%\nfull that is logged, but\n\n49\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.980\nwouldn't be good if it also\nsent a text to a technician, or\n\n50\n00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.840\nmaybe opened a ticket automatically,\nan incident.\n\n51\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.140\nAnd got it routed to\nthe right server group so\n\n52\n00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.360\nthat they could shore that up, delete\nsome log files, do what they need to do.\n\n53\n00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.710\nSo an event is this automatic detection.\n\n54\n00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.530\nCould you detect environmental conditions,\nsuch as temperature in the data center.\n\n55\n00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.960\nIs it an event when the temperature\nrises five degrees over an hour?\n\n56\n00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.340\n&gt;&gt; I guarantee you, when that email\ngoes out, there's an event happening.\n\n57\n00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.150\n&gt;&gt; You have a good point.\n\n58\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.465\n&gt;&gt; All the IT people start scattering to\nthe server closet ASAP when that occurs.\n\n59\n00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:13.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, so events are detected and\n\n60\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.470\nthey can give you a sense of\nthe health of your environment.\n\n61\n00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.299\nSo coming up with intrusion\ndetection in a security sphere.\n\n62\n00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.113\nIntrusion detection is\neffectively an event,\n\n63\n00:03:26.113 --> 00:03:29.780\na very sophisticated event\nmanagement correlation engine.\n\n64\n00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.330\nIf Terry Decker logs in,\nthat's event, that's logged.\n\n65\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.110\nWhat if Terry Decker is\nlogging in simultaneously or\n\n66\n00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.710\ntrying to log in simultaneously 50 times\nin 17 different geographic locations?\n\n67\n00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.200\nSo intrusion detection can see that\nkinda have those algorithms in play.\n\n68\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.330\nAnd say we got security issue here, right\nbecause it correlates that information.\n\n69\n00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.208\nSo, events is a wide landscape,\nit really is.\n\n70\n00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:59.579\nEvents can be covering environmental\nissues, security issues, capacity issues.\n\n71\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.870\nLicensing issues if you\nhave a shared licence and\n\n72\n00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.940\nyou only have a 100 shared license in\nthat 98th person logs on maybe an event\n\n73\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.762\npops out saying we'll get close to\na license limit here, that sort of thing.\n\n74\n00:04:13.762 --> 00:04:16.600\nSo events give you the ability to\n\n75\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.230\nautomatically detect things you care\nabout and perhaps provide a basis for\n\n76\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.690\nautomating a response to those\nthings that you care about.\n\n77\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.080\nThat's what event management is, so does\nthat mean that every event is an incident?\n\n78\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.030\nIt does not mean that,\nlike I said Terry Decker logs in today,\n\n79\n00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.050\nyou don't have to call the service\ndesk because Terry Decker logged in.\n\n80\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.950\nIf Terry Decker log in 50 times\nsimultaneously across 17 geographic\n\n81\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.049\nlocations, maybe we got\nsomething to worry about.\n\n82\n00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:43.815\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we get eyes on that [LAUGH].\n\n83\n00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:47.627\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nnot every event is an incident.\n\n84\n00:04:47.627 --> 00:04:51.105\nAnd of course, not every incident\nis triggered by an event.\n\n85\n00:04:51.105 --> 00:04:54.695\nService desk could get a call from a user\nsaying I can't find the submit button.\n\n86\n00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:56.535\nThat's probably not\nautomatically detected.\n\n87\n00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:59.405\nThe missing submit button\nis probably not an event\n\n88\n00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:00.935\nbecause it's not automatically detected.\n\n89\n00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:04.175\nIt was detected by a user that\ncalled the service desk, etc.\n\n90\n00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:07.545\nSo not all incidents\nare triggered by events.\n\n91\n00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:12.040\nNot all events trigger an incident,\nbut they can also be closely related.\n\n92\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.850\nThat's why we talk about them separately.\n\n93\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.860\nIt's a separate type of discipline.\n\n94\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.740\nYou need to have a good awareness\nof what you care about, and\n\n95\n00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.270\nwhat you want to monitor,\nand a good discipline for\n\n96\n00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.210\nreviewing all those events\nthat you are capturing.\n\n97\n00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.133\nThat's what event management is about.\n\n98\n00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:29.440\nSo why have this?\n\n99\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.040\nWhat's the value of\nevents to the business?\n\n100\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.137\nWe'll first of all it lets you\nenable early detection of incidents.\n\n101\n00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:40.603\nLike I said, if you get a warning\nthat the disc is 75% full,\n\n102\n00:05:40.603 --> 00:05:45.830\nyou get warning automatically detected\nthrough your event management system.\n\n103\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.230\nThrowing out an incident\nto the server team, great.\n\n104\n00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.140\nThe server team goes,\ntakes care of the capacity issue and\n\n105\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.770\nit's never noticed by the end users\nbecause you got in front of it.\n\n106\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.540\nSo monitoring and\nevent are closely related, not the same.\n\n107\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.310\nEvent management is the detection,\nmonitoring is\n\n108\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.939\nthe extra layer of management you\nput on top of that detection.\n\n109\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.220\nSo, the value to business effectively\nis to get in front of incidents so\n\n110\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.120\nthat they don't happen and\naffect end users.\n\n111\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.320\nPolicies as with any process,\nyou need policies to back it up.\n\n112\n00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.390\nPerhaps, the security management regime\nis very concerned about logon events.\n\n113\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.060\nWe have a policy that all logins will\nbe tucked away into an event log.\n\n114\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.060\nWe know that happens.\n\n115\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.265\nOr access to the HR system\nwill be monitored and\n\n116\n00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:39.390\nlogged so that event is captured.\n\n117\n00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.550\nSo security logging could be under\nthe auspices of security management,\n\n118\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.800\nalso driven by policy.\n\n119\n00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.600\nWe will log all these things.\n\n120\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.720\nSo again, it's not necessarily an event\nthat Terry Decker logged in this morning.\n\n121\n00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.440\nBut what if it was 3\no'clock in the morning,\n\n122\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.980\nthe same day there was HR data theft?\n\n123\n00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.410\nMaybe you connect the dots through\nall these event managements.\n\n124\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.530\nWe see Terry Decker logged in, we see he\ntried to access this system, was denied.\n\n125\n00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.150\nBut then, he got in through this way,\nbecause you have these events log.\n\n126\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.810\nSo, again,\nthat's a specialized event management,\n\n127\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.350\nbecause it's related to security.\n\n128\n00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.610\nBut you can do this for environmental,\nyou could do this for capacity,\n\n129\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.640\nyou could do this for\nother things you care about.\n\n130\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.630\nAny significance that\nyou care to identify.\n\n131\n00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:29.120\nSo we've talked about these events\nin different levels of importance.\n\n132\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.670\nITIL gives these levels\nof importance names.\n\n133\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.600\nInformational event,\nTerry Decker logged in today.\n\n134\n00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.590\nThe batch file completed successfully.\n\n135\n00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.930\nBack up successful.\n\n136\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.510\nRestore successful.\n\n137\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.870\nData migrated successfully.\n\n138\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.520\nYou don't need to alert anybody\ncuz everything is going as is.\n\n139\n00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.895\nBut you've got an event log that\nit did go as it's supposed to go.\n\n140\n00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:55.501\nA warning event, disk is 75% full,\nCPU highly utilized,\n\n141\n00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:58.166\npackets being lost on the network.\n\n142\n00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:01.281\nRight, so a warning is not necessarily\nmeans you got a breach yet,\n\n143\n00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:04.287\nyou don't necessarily have an issue\nyou have to respond to, but\n\n144\n00:08:04.287 --> 00:08:07.650\nit's looking kinda grim, you should\nbe paying close attention to it.\n\n145\n00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.450\nAnd then, of course,\nan exception event is disk is full,\n\n146\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.420\ngenerator is offline, right,\nit's gone down, right.\n\n147\n00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.829\nTalking about environmental issues or\npower issues, those kind of things.\n\n148\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.420\nCPU is on fire\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n149\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.830\n&gt;&gt; No, but you get the idea,\n\n150\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.570\nan exception event is\nyou've somehow breached,\n\n151\n00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.930\nyou've gone past the point of\nacceptable performance or conditions.\n\n152\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.280\nSuch as Terry Decker\ntrying to log in 50 times.\n\n153\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.740\nIn 17 different locations.\n\n154\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.690\nThat's an exception event, we've got\nrespond to that, what's going on there.\n\n155\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.136\nWe're under attack, that sort of thing.\n\n156\n00:08:43.136 --> 00:08:49.860\nAll right, so designing for\nevent management.\n\n157\n00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.320\nYou should certainly consider this\nearly in the design of a service.\n\n158\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.420\nService design is an early stage\nin the life cycle of a service and\n\n159\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.410\nyou certainly need to consider what events\nneed to be put in play to make sure you\n\n160\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.810\nhave your finger on the pulse,\nif you will, of your environment.\n\n161\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:17.900\nInstrumentation, perhaps a good analogy\nfor instrumentation is a car, right.\n\n162\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.060\nYou have certain information\nin front of you in a car.\n\n163\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.940\nInstrumentation.\n\n164\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.620\nYour dashboard, your instrument panel.\n\n165\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.130\nRight?\nYou can see how fast you're going, you\n\n166\n00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:31.060\ncan see how much fuel is being consumed,\netcetera perhaps even air message.\n\n167\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.540\nA lot of cars now can tell you how\nmuch air you have in your tires.\n\n168\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.310\nThat sort of thing.\n\n169\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.880\nRight?\n\n170\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.887\nOr, a beep comes on,\nor a light comes on and\n\n171\n00:09:38.887 --> 00:09:42.994\na chime beeps when you get to\na certain fuel level, right.\n\n172\n00:09:42.994 --> 00:09:45.139\nSo you can see how instrumentation and\n\n173\n00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:49.702\nevent management is also making sure you\nhave the right viewing of these events.\n\n174\n00:09:49.702 --> 00:09:51.420\nThat's what instrumentation is about.\n\n175\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.890\nSo if you are monitoring\na data center temperatures,\n\n176\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.070\nif you're monitoring\ndisc space utilization.\n\n177\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.590\nIf you're monitoring\nsecurity events that's one\n\n178\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.610\nthing to have these events captured but\n\n179\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.940\nhow are you exposing that information\nto the right people at the right time?\n\n180\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.970\nThat's what instrumentation is about,\n\n181\n00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.060\ngetting the right information\nto you at the right time.\n\n182\n00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.560\nSo you could have real time indicators or\nyou could have indicators over time.\n\n183\n00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.710\nMeasured over time, number of\npackets dropped in the last hour.\n\n184\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.230\nThose kinds of events and\nmonitoring are closer related.\n\n185\n00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.690\nInstrumentation is given\nthe visibility to it.\n\n186\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.600\nOf course designing for\nwhat is an acceptable threshold.\n\n187\n00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.476\nDo you start sending off tickets to the\nserver team when the disk is 75% full or\n\n188\n00:10:38.476 --> 00:10:40.270\n50% full.\n\n189\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.630\nOr 90% full.\n\n190\n00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.090\nRight.\nIt kinda depends on how\n\n191\n00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.600\nquickly this disk is filling up.\n\n192\n00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.200\nRight?\n\n193\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.670\nSo understanding what those\nthresholds are is also a part of\n\n194\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.290\ndesigning event management\ninto your services.\n\n195\n00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.320\nRight?\n\n196\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.650\nSo, early and often you should be\nconsidering your event management regime.\n\n197\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:03.060\nAnd as early as service designed\nIs when you should start, okay.\n\n198\n00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.050\nSo, there's some good self study for\nyou later on.\n\n199\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.840\nThis is just a reminder that don't\nconsider that this lecture's\n\n200\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.650\nthe only way to go.\n\n201\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.600\nWe got some more lecture to do, but\nthere's a good exercise for you related to\n\n202\n00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.460\nevent management called event\nmanagement they can help you out there.\n\n203\n00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:19.960\nOkay.\n\n204\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.050\nActivities in event management.\n\n205\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.550\nLots to go on here.\n\n206\n00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.550\nI'm not going to belabor this,\nthe exercise and activities, but\n\n207\n00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:34.490\nthe effect of these various flow charts\nit goes on through several pages here.\n\n208\n00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.680\nIs that incidents are detected,\nwhat are you going to do about it.\n\n209\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.610\nIs is it something you're\nsupposed to respond to?\n\n210\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.070\nIs it informational only?\n\n211\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.790\nRight, so all these different\noffshoots are based on the type of\n\n212\n00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.230\nevent you're facing.\n\n213\n00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.890\nInformational events are just that,\nyou don't care so much.\n\n214\n00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.690\nWarnings you might need to go and\ndo something.\n\n215\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.658\nOf course, an exception events you\nneed to run and do something, right?\n\n216\n00:11:55.658 --> 00:12:01.420\nAll right, So what needs to be detected?\n\n217\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.610\nIt's when you're talking about when the\nevent occurs, what needs to be detected?\n\n218\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.990\nDo you need to detect logins?\n\n219\n00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.670\nWhat is the instrumentation,\nis gonna answer that question.\n\n220\n00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.780\nYour instrumentation, what you care about.\n\n221\n00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:19.500\nIf you imagine, again, imagine a car\nas you're driving, pretty intuitive.\n\n222\n00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.808\nWhat about more complex systems,\nsuch as a boat or an airplane.\n\n223\n00:12:23.808 --> 00:12:26.837\nIf you have ever looked into\na cockpit of a commercial airline,\n\n224\n00:12:26.837 --> 00:12:30.340\nyou see all the blinking lights,\nthere's controls everywhere.\n\n225\n00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.800\nA lot of the things in front\nof those pilots in the cockpit\n\n226\n00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.750\nare information only.\n\n227\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.400\nThey don't actually control anything.\n\n228\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.220\nSome of them are for\ncontrol and response, right.\n\n229\n00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.080\nSo event management on an airplane\nis talking about fuel supply,\n\n230\n00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.540\nit's talking about wind conditions,\nit's talking about speed, pressure,\n\n231\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.610\nair pressure this, air pressure,\noil pressure, all sorts of things, right?\n\n232\n00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.890\nAnd a lot of that instrumentation again\nis helping them fly this aircraft\n\n233\n00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:56.820\neffectively.\n\n234\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.440\nAnd certainly if something goes wrong in\nany kind of subsystem on that aircraft\n\n235\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.990\na light starts shining,\na horn starts blowing,\n\n236\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.277\na chime starts ringing,\nthat's instrumentation.\n\n237\n00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:10.910\nRight.\n\n238\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:11.410\nOkay.\n\n239\n00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:14.910\nGood.\n\n240\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.650\nLocal detection versus remote detection.\n\n241\n00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:24.250\nBeing able to detect from afar, could be\nvery important for an IT service provider.\n\n242\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.450\nOftentimes, certainly when you consider\nit an airplane, it's pretty much local.\n\n243\n00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.300\nEverything is right there,\n\n244\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:34.870\nwires are connected to diodes that'll end\nup shining a light, those kinda things.\n\n245\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.130\nSo that's the cockpit,\nthat's very local detection.\n\n246\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.310\nRemote detection you might be going and\n\n247\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:45.180\ngetting the logs from various servers or\nnetworks, or network components.\n\n248\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.817\nSo an IT service is probably\ngonna be concerned with both,\n\n249\n00:13:48.817 --> 00:13:53.644\nbeing able to capture something locally\nat the device level, for instance,\n\n250\n00:13:53.644 --> 00:13:58.270\nbut also be able to access that\nknowledge and that information remotely.\n\n251\n00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.194\nAll right, without filtering, my goodness,\nyou could be really busy, right?\n\n252\n00:14:02.194 --> 00:14:05.501\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you've ever gone to just an event\n\n253\n00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:10.616\nlog on a server or a desktop,\nmost desktops have these.\n\n254\n00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:12.629\nYou can go and take a look at them.\n\n255\n00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:16.380\nI mean, they just roll on,\nevery day it's doing something.\n\n256\n00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.800\nCP utilization, it talks about hardware,\nit talks about network utilization\n\n257\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.930\nIt talks about services,\nloading up and stopping and starting.\n\n258\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.300\n&gt;&gt; The logs would literally fill your\nhard drive if you do not define,\n\n259\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.820\nthis is how much space\nyou get to these logs.\n\n260\n00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.290\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, they certainly would because\nthey just generate a bunch of data and\n\n261\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.290\nif you go wanna look at that data, you\nalso need to be able to filter it I guess.\n\n262\n00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.580\nSo If you're doing some troubleshooting or\nif you want these events to make sense,\n\n263\n00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.300\nyou're probably gonna have to have\nsome sort of filtering on top of them\n\n264\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.820\nto start to make sense of them.\n\n265\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.460\nAnd, as Daniel just point, you're gonna\nhave to be able to reduce the excess\n\n266\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.180\namount because it's just so much data that\ncan be generated, right, so much data.\n\n267\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.610\nSo event management is also determined,\nnot just with a detection, but\n\n268\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.910\nthe actual instrumentation,\nand the filtering.\n\n269\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.570\nIt's a pretty busy place.\n\n270\n00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.440\nSo then there's this event correlation.\n\n271\n00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.870\nIn the example where I\nmentioned Terry Decker logging\n\n272\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.830\nin 50 times simultaneously in 17\ndifferent geographic locations.\n\n273\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.060\nThat is a stark example or correlation.\n\n274\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.180\nThat was 50 separate events.\n\n275\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.910\nTerry Decker loging in.\n\n276\n00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.360\nRight?\nIf you look at them just as one at a time,\n\n277\n00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.330\nagain it's normally no big deal,\nif Terry Decker's logging in.\n\n278\n00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:26.860\nRight.\n\n279\n00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.907\nBut correlating events across the in this\ncase across 17 different geographical\n\n280\n00:15:30.907 --> 00:15:34.736\nlocations, right that is correlation,\nthat's bringing things together.\n\n281\n00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:39.236\nI once consulted with\na communications company, and\n\n282\n00:15:39.236 --> 00:15:42.760\nthey sold communication services.\n\n283\n00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.180\nAnd such they are very concerned\nabout the health of their network.\n\n284\n00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:46.790\nRight?\n\n285\n00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.630\nSo they had correlations engines,\npackets get lost on networks.\n\n286\n00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.950\nPackets are dropped this is not\nunusual activity, in networks.\n\n287\n00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.825\nIt's not 100% accurate.\n\n288\n00:15:55.825 --> 00:15:58.250\nThe beauty of a network it\npicks up the packets later.\n\n289\n00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.490\nRight.\nIt gets them.\n\n290\n00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.990\nAnd resends, and those kinds of things.\n\n291\n00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.817\nSo, there's lot of cross talk,\na lot of cross talk between the devices,\n\n292\n00:16:04.817 --> 00:16:06.870\nsome things gets lost.\n\n293\n00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:12.290\nIf you have a high degree of packet loss\nhowever, whatever high degree means, if\n\n294\n00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.780\nyou have a high degree of packet loss, you\ncould be affecting network performance.\n\n295\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:20.300\nSomething is not going right,\nif you have high degree of packet loss.\n\n296\n00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.070\nSo, what is high degree?\n\n297\n00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.780\nThat could be correlating\nacross multiple devices.\n\n298\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:31.180\nThis algorithmic process of\ndetermining what high packet loss is.\n\n299\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.776\nIf you can correlate all those different\nevents, happening at each local device,\n\n300\n00:16:35.776 --> 00:16:41.370\nin to determine and add up to high, you\ncan provide an appropriate response to it.\n\n301\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:46.156\nThat's what correlation is about,\ntaking varying events and\n\n302\n00:16:46.156 --> 00:16:49.869\nputting them together\ninto a logical response.\n\n303\n00:16:49.869 --> 00:16:55.730\nAll right, what triggers an event?\n\n304\n00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.580\nWithout a response,\nthe event is informational, basically.\n\n305\n00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.943\nWe talked about information, and\nthis is Terry Decker logged in today,\n\n306\n00:17:01.943 --> 00:17:03.604\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n307\n00:17:03.604 --> 00:17:06.510\nTriggers simply get the response started.\n\n308\n00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.690\nMaybe the response is to\ncreate an instant record.\n\n309\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.190\nMaybe it can even be to create an RFC.\n\n310\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.590\nMaybe it pages someone, or sends an alert.\n\n311\n00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.510\nMaybe it runs a script and\ncorrects something, or\n\n312\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.480\na combination of all the above.\n\n313\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.930\nI certainly know that,\nas operating systems have evolved,\n\n314\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.690\nthey've gotten better at self repairing.\n\n315\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.850\nIf they see an issue with it,\nit'll restart the service and\n\n316\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.860\nbring something right back up.\n\n317\n00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:44.500\nSo itself, it's built in to many systems\nthat they self heal, in many cases.\n\n318\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.381\nEvent management is gonna be\ngetting on top of this and\n\n319\n00:17:47.381 --> 00:17:50.399\nunderstanding when this happens,\nand why it happens.\n\n320\n00:17:50.399 --> 00:17:51.010\nOkay?\n\n321\n00:17:52.326 --> 00:17:56.492\nAll right, of course how you\nwanna respond, is it just a log?\n\n322\n00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:59.178\nIs it automatic response,\nas we just talked about?\n\n323\n00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:01.960\nAnd then, how you go about responding.\n\n324\n00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.932\nIs it a human intervention?\n\n325\n00:18:03.932 --> 00:18:05.430\nIs it automated?\n\n326\n00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.720\nDoes it create an incident, does it create\na problem, does it create a change?\n\n327\n00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.370\nSo, again, event management\ncan lead to various things.\n\n328\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.690\nAnd think about, you could be\ntalking about physical environments.\n\n329\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.530\nAgain, this a stark example\nof an event management.\n\n330\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.470\nWhat happens when enough\nsmoke is detected in a house?\n\n331\n00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.170\nThe event is detected by a smoke detector.\n\n332\n00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.010\nAnd it just makes obnoxious noise\nthat you wanna get away from.\n\n333\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.336\n&gt;&gt; Which is basically the amount of\nsmoke that comes from a match [LAUGH].\n\n334\n00:18:31.336 --> 00:18:32.940\nBecause I don't know about\nyour smoke detectors,\n\n335\n00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.180\nthey're pretty stinking sensitive.\n\n336\n00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:34.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right, right.\n\n337\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI know if it's at my house, yeah,\n\n338\n00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:39.086\nthey only run out of battery\nat 3 o'clock in the morning.\n\n339\n00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:40.638\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's exactly right,\nthat's right.\n\n340\n00:18:40.638 --> 00:18:41.911\n&gt;&gt; Only at 3 o'clock in the morning.\n\n341\n00:18:41.911 --> 00:18:43.093\n&gt;&gt; What's that beeping?\n\n342\n00:18:43.093 --> 00:18:44.060\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n343\n00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.860\nSo, but you get the idea that\nthere could be a human response or\n\n344\n00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.840\nan automated response.\n\n345\n00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.590\nEvent management needs to understand\nthat aspect of response, as well.\n\n346\n00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:52.670\nHow do we want to take that?\n\n347\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.028\nAnd of course, this is gonna be based\non business impact and criticality.\n\n348\n00:18:56.028 --> 00:18:57.019\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n349\n00:18:57.019 --> 00:18:58.860\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good.\n\n350\n00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.720\nSo, what you should do when\nyou consider event management,\n\n351\n00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:07.380\nis to make sure that you understand your\nentire landscape of what you care about,\n\n352\n00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.180\nwhat assets should have event\nmanagement underneath them, and\n\n353\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.728\napproach to building in\nthe appropriate correlation engines,\n\n354\n00:19:15.728 --> 00:19:21.500\ninstrumentation, and response.\n\n355\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.805\nAll right, what value does this bring?\n\n356\n00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:24.920\nIf we just bring that back, Daniel.\n\n357\n00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.450\nWhat value does this bring?\n\n358\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.830\n&gt;&gt; What value does this bring?\n\n359\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.260\nWell, I guess it brings the value of,\nat least,\n\n360\n00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.930\nyou're knowing that things are happening.\n\n361\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.332\nYou're getting alerts, things of that\nnature, and something is being done,\n\n362\n00:19:35.332 --> 00:19:38.607\nit's not just pervasive, because no\none even knows that it's occurring.\n\n363\n00:19:38.607 --> 00:19:39.886\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n364\n00:19:39.886 --> 00:19:44.929\nSo, event management, as with\nincident management, is about making\n\n365\n00:19:44.929 --> 00:19:49.830\nsure that we minimize the harm that\ncould play out for the end users.\n\n366\n00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.880\nAnd I don't mean bodily harm, necessarily,\nor I guess it could relate to that.\n\n367\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.490\nIt could be bodily harm.\n\n368\n00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.245\nYou don't wanna disrupt the business.\n\n369\n00:19:56.245 --> 00:19:57.490\nIncident management's related to that.\n\n370\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:58.810\nProblem management's related to that.\n\n371\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.370\nEvent management's related to that.\n\n372\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.520\nAnd doesn't this fit nicely with the\noverarching goal of service operations as\n\n373\n00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.120\na life cycle stage,\nwhich was where we started?\n\n374\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.370\nDelivering services as they're\nintended to deliver, and\n\n375\n00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.220\nminimizing the impacts of disruption.\n\n376\n00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.770\nSo event management, as with the other\nones, is part of the puzzle.\n\n377\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.890\nIt's one piece in the many pieces of\nthe puzzle of service operations.\n\n378\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.020\nWhat's up next?\n\n379\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.780\nIs going to be a discussion\nof a couple more processes.\n\n380\n00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.990\nWe've got request fulfillment left and\naccess management.\n\n381\n00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.960\nSo look forward to seeing\nyou on those episodes soon.\n\n382\n00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, thank you so much.\n\n383\n00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.970\nThis is, I love this kind of stuff,\ncuz it's very interesting in ways we\n\n384\n00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.710\nprobably don't think about these things,\nnormally.\n\n385\n00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.650\nRight, that events occurs,\nor we get event logs, and\n\n386\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.610\nthat they're making things happen.\n\n387\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.860\nBecause if they weren't there,\nor we didn't know about them,\n\n388\n00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.710\nthen we'd just be sitting\naround twiddling our thumbs.\n\n389\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.050\nAnd our systems would be\nburning down like Rome, right?\n\n390\n00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:49.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n391\n00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.245\n&gt;&gt; Then we'd have no\nidea what was going on.\n\n392\n00:20:51.245 --> 00:20:51.745\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n393\n00:20:51.745 --> 00:20:53.109\n&gt;&gt; It's very cool to think about it this\n\n394\n00:20:53.109 --> 00:20:55.690\nway.\nITIL's done a fantastic job of\n\n395\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.600\ncategorizing these things, so that we have\nsome sort of basis of standardization\n\n396\n00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.720\nto understand them, and all in the same\nway, we all speak the same language.\n\n397\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.270\nTerry, thanks so much for\ndropping by today, we appreciate it.\n\n398\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.350\nWe appreciate you good folks for\njoining us as well,\n\n399\n00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.990\nbut it seems like it's that time yet\nagain, for us to sign off.\n\n400\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.216\nFor ITPRO.TV, I've been you host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n401\n00:21:12.216 --> 00:21:13.190\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n402\n00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.734\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time\n\n403\n00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:21.663\n[MUSIC]\n\n404\n00:21:21.663 --> 00:21:23.635\nThank you for watching

00:00:12.520\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.000\nAnd welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.614\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:22.220\nwe're moving on with more\non our ITIL OSA series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.730\nAnd of course, joining is in the studio\nto lend his expertise on the very topic\n\n9\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.070\nis our good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.970\nTerry, welcome back my man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.020\n&gt;&gt; As always, Daniel, happy to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.150\nWe've gone through, in previous episodes,\n\n13\n00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.460\nthree of the five processes\nin service operations.\n\n14\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.990\nWe've gone through incident management,\nwe've gone through problem management,\n\n15\n00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.150\nwe've gone through event management.\n\n16\n00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.440\nEach providing their own\nunique piece of the puzzle\n\n17\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.070\nto maintain effective operations.\n\n18\n00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.820\nSo, next up is request fulfillment.\n\n19\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.720\nRequest fulfillment, so what is a request?\n\n20\n00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.210\nWe had to define events, incidents,\nand problems, so what is a request?\n\n21\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.070\nAny ideas,\nwhat possibly could be a request, Daniel?\n\n22\n00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.791\n&gt;&gt; Someone asking you to do something.\n\n23\n00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.890\n&gt;&gt; And something asking you do something\n\n25\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.430\nin a fairly repeatable way,\nmethodical way.\n\n26\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.300\nYou need to replace your battery in\nyour laptop, you need a new mouse,\n\n27\n00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.330\nyou need headsets,\nyou need software installed,\n\n28\n00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.850\nyou need access to an application,\nthese standardized things.\n\n29\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.780\nThat's the nature of requests,\nis they're standardized and repeatable.\n\n30\n00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.340\nRight, they could involve in may\ninvolve some sort of work flow\n\n31\n00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.210\napproval process, etc.\n\n32\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.800\nBut you standardize these services for\nquick reactions, and quick fulfillment.\n\n33\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.130\nThus, request fulfillment.\n\n34\n00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.240\nYou had a lot cash donation today,\nespecially at the foundation when we talk\n\n35\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.040\nabout memorizing Using\nthese various things.\n\n36\n00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.460\nWe've got incident management,\nwe've got problem management,\n\n37\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.280\nwe've got event management.\n\n38\n00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.710\nAnother process is access management,\nwhich we will talk about later.\n\n39\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.470\nAnd here we have requests, but\nit's not request management,\n\n40\n00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.520\nit is request fulfillment.\n\n41\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.760\nBut any rate, whatever the name might be,\n\n42\n00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.900\nit's about managing the aspects of\ndelivering standardized services.\n\n43\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.880\nSo, why standardized?\n\n44\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.500\nWhy have methodical,\n\n45\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.080\nrepeatable approaches to how you fulfill\nsome of these standard requests?\n\n46\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.280\nWhy do that?\n\n47\n00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.410\n&gt;&gt; So, that it's, like you said,\nis it's repeatable.\n\n48\n00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.760\nIf you make it the same way every time,\neverybody knows exactly what it is\n\n49\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.690\nyou're talking about when you use\nterminology, or you talk about a process.\n\n50\n00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.070\nEverybody understands that that\nprocess is done a certain way,\n\n51\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.050\nbecause you've seen it done in the past.\n\n52\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.890\nAnd you can look at the,\nmaybe the documentation or\n\n53\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.820\nsomething on how that's done and\nrepeat that for yourself.\n\n54\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.730\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and by also,\nby wrapping a process around it.\n\n55\n00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.040\nYou can do it predictably\nat predictable cost,\n\n56\n00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.630\nyou can manage capacity appropriately.\n\n57\n00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.350\nSo I mean, if you have, do you have\nspare batteries for laptops in a cabinet\n\n58\n00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.720\nsomewhere, and how many request do\nyou get for battery replacements?\n\n59\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.560\nRight, that sort of things.\n\n60\n00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.150\nSo, if you have a methodology\nof request fulfillment,\n\n61\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.910\nyou also have a basis for measuring\nthe capacity of request fulfillment.\n\n62\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.820\nAgain, something else you keep score on.\n\n63\n00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.330\nYou log incidents, you log problems,\nyou also log request.\n\n64\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.950\nYou don't have invisible work,\nyou have a methodology and\n\n65\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.750\na means of measuring how\neffective you are at this.\n\n66\n00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.270\nUltimately, what you're\ntrying to do is to make it so\n\n67\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.170\nusers understand how to access\nthem in a repeatable way.\n\n68\n00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.020\nThey know where to go for the batteries,\nthey know where to go for software, etc.\n\n69\n00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.080\nThey know how to get these services,\nthat's part of requests for film.\n\n70\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.900\nSo, the points of interface are defined.\n\n71\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.450\nThe points of interface and work flow,\nand approval's are also defined.\n\n72\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.750\nThat's what we're going to be talking\nabout over the next several minutes,\n\n73\n00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.040\nrelated to request form.\n\n74\n00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.360\nFairly straightforward as we go through.\n\n75\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.430\nAs with other processes,\nyou have policies in place for instance,\n\n76\n00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.570\nyou might have a request fulfillment for\npassing out iPads to new employees, right?\n\n77\n00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.540\nI'm a new employee.\n\n78\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.930\nI call the service desk and enter, I say,\nI would like to request five iPads.\n\n79\n00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.180\nIt's coming along Christmas, I wanna\nfit out the family with them, right?\n\n80\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.840\nSo, these policies are in\nplace to kind of govern it.\n\n81\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.690\nYou don't just fulfill the process,\n\n82\n00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.450\nyou don't just fulfill every request\nthat comes to the service desk.\n\n83\n00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.920\nMaybe not every employee gets an iPad,\nmaybe only the sales group does,\n\n84\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.550\nor maybe only executives get, etc.\n\n85\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.180\nSo, policies backing up these processes,\nand\n\n86\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.210\ncoming up with request models for\nhow you give what to\n\n87\n00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.560\nwhat people is also part of the governance\nof the request fulfillment process.\n\n88\n00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.885\nIntrinsic to request is approval, right?\n\n89\n00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:39.245\nMaybe everyone is pre-approved,\nor self approved.\n\n90\n00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:42.635\nIf their battery's not working,\nthey can request a new battery, and\n\n91\n00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:48.625\nno magic credit card has to be presented\nor no cost center adjustments,\n\n92\n00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:52.145\nit's just checked and managed in\nthe background without any issues,\n\n93\n00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:54.715\non behalf of the person\nthat's making the request.\n\n94\n00:04:54.715 --> 00:04:57.960\nOther things may require a bit\nmore due diligence, such as,\n\n95\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.630\nperhaps the request for an iPad.\n\n96\n00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.072\nIt's a bit more expensive,\nnot everyone is supposed to get them.\n\n97\n00:05:04.072 --> 00:05:07.880\nSo, there's more due diligence\napplied to those types of requests.\n\n98\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.150\nThat's what request models\nare going to help you with.\n\n99\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.650\nThey are going to define how you approach,\nand\n\n100\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.670\nhow you fulfill certain kinds of requests.\n\n101\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.640\nOr what if an executive asks for\nsoftware to be installed.\n\n102\n00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.580\nDo you treat the executive differently\nthan you might treat the end users,\n\n103\n00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.850\nthe base users if you will?\n\n104\n00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.580\nMaybe you have request models for\nexecutive requests that are different than\n\n105\n00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.660\nthe request models for rank and\nfile users, as examples.\n\n106\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.620\nSo, the way we approach this,\n\n107\n00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.210\nhow are you going to manage\nrequests over their life cycle?\n\n108\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.860\nLogging them,\nmaking sure you know when they started,\n\n109\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.870\nwhat workflow happens in between, and\nof course how they end up, right?\n\n110\n00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.310\nThat's what request\nfilament needs to govern.\n\n111\n00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.910\nThey need to get on top of this.\n\n112\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.100\nBe aware of all the requests as\nthey come in, log these things.\n\n113\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.690\nProvide metrics against\nthose requests over time.\n\n114\n00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.931\nRight, the idea of self help, if you look\nat here, just a brief little graphic here.\n\n115\n00:06:06.931 --> 00:06:10.590\nA self help, what if you\nautomated some of these things?\n\n116\n00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.814\nYou go to web interface, and\nyou request what you want.\n\n117\n00:06:13.814 --> 00:06:16.424\nYou don't necessarily have\nto call the service desk.\n\n118\n00:06:16.424 --> 00:06:18.870\nNow, the service desk is\na single point of contact,\n\n119\n00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.850\nand the service desk is often a place\nwhere people go to log incidents.\n\n120\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.290\nIt's also a place where\npeople go to make requests.\n\n121\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.490\nBut you also could put some self help\nengines in front of this, right?\n\n122\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.340\nMaybe it's a web form that they fill out.\n\n123\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.720\nAnd when they click submit,\n\n124\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.030\nit goes to the appropriate group of people\nthat can take care of that request.\n\n125\n00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.150\nCertainly, maybe the people passing out\niPads are not the same group of people\n\n126\n00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.660\nthat replace batteries, or pass out mice.\n\n127\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.670\nRight, because they had\ndifferent request models.\n\n128\n00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.610\nThey're might be bit different.\n\n129\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.970\nDifferent parts of\nthe organization fulfill it.\n\n130\n00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.970\nSo, coming up with some self help tools\nup in front of the request fulfillment\n\n131\n00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.160\nprocess can be very helpful.\n\n132\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.030\nAs this plays out in on your exam,\nit's not telling you that\n\n133\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.312\nyou must have a self help engine\nin front of request fulfillment.\n\n134\n00:07:05.312 --> 00:07:09.000\nIt's not telling you that all requests\nmust go to the service desk, either.\n\n135\n00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.010\nWhat you need to be looking for\nis the methodological approach for\n\n136\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.760\nhandling the standard\ndelivery of services, or\n\n137\n00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.980\nthe delivery of standard service\nmight be a better way to put that.\n\n138\n00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.570\nSelf help is one of those things that is\nhighly recommended, because it can save\n\n139\n00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.200\nservice desk personnel the time of dealing\nwith it, they don't have things on behalf\n\n140\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.010\nof the user, the user can help themselves\nto putting in all those parameters.\n\n141\n00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.590\nAnd keep in mind,\n\n142\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.790\nthat it's not necessarily end users that\nare being effected by request fulfillment,\n\n143\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.000\nit could be IT for IT.\n\n144\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.850\nThe application team may request from\nthe server team a virtual server,\n\n145\n00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.360\nor a database to be built,\nthose kinds of things.\n\n146\n00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.262\nSo, request fulfillment can be for\nstandard services, absolutely.\n\n147\n00:07:53.262 --> 00:07:57.852\nBut those standard services could be\nfrom a supporting service to a customer\n\n148\n00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:58.936\nfacing service.\n\n149\n00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:02.231\nSo, it kinda can bend within IT as well.\n\n150\n00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:06.570\nLots of advantages come from\nthis standardization approach.\n\n151\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.760\nLots of advantages come\nfrom a methodical approach.\n\n152\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.890\nYou get a control and you get measurement.\n\n153\n00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.210\nThat's really what these\nprocesses focus on, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:22.580\nSo as you go through these processes,\nthere's always some sort of flow.\n\n155\n00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.480\nAs it relates to request fulfillment,\nthe workflow could include a stop off for\n\n156\n00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.650\napproval somewhere.\n\n157\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.610\nMaybe a manager has to\napprove requests over,\n\n158\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.260\nand then some threshold of money, right.\n\n159\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.000\nIf it costs more than $50,\nit must have management approval,\n\n160\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.148\nyou could have that in your policy,\nso you build that into the workflow.\n\n161\n00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:46.059\nRequest fulfillment needs to\nunderstand those flows and\n\n162\n00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:50.058\ncome up with the appropriate models to\nmake sure that the appropriate approval\n\n163\n00:08:50.058 --> 00:08:52.014\npoints are included, if necessary.\n\n164\n00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:53.159\nAll right.\n\n165\n00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:54.043\nPretty straightforward.\n\n166\n00:08:54.043 --> 00:09:00.260\nDoing this,\ndoing it well is what ITIL encourages.\n\n167\n00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.807\nAnd by standardizing it and putting a\nprocess owner on top of it to manage your\n\n168\n00:09:04.807 --> 00:09:09.620\non-going improvement of it,\nyou're going to be more successful.\n\n169\n00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.940\nSo as it relates to the exam, as you\nconsider this topic as relates to exam,\n\n170\n00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.390\nobviously, know the difference\nbetween a request and an incident.\n\n171\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.525\nFor instance, if a user calls to\nhelp desk, or service desk, and\n\n172\n00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:24.980\nsays I can't find the submit button.\n\n173\n00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.840\nMaybe you call that a request.\n\n174\n00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.020\nIt's a request for information.\n\n175\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.790\nMaybe you call it an incident.\n\n176\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.570\nAnd again, as we talked about that one in\nincident management, if 50 people call\n\n177\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.190\nthe service desk with a submit button,\nyou got a different issue going on there.\n\n178\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.210\nSo that's probably not a request.\n\n179\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.870\nThat's why you need to have\nwell defined incident models,\n\n180\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.690\nwell defined request models.\n\n181\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.668\nI'm not saying there's a right\nanswer to this question.\n\n182\n00:09:47.668 --> 00:09:50.910\nIs that a request or an incident if\nthe user can't find a submit button?\n\n183\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.460\nThere's not one right answer.\n\n184\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.622\nWhat you're looking for for\n\n185\n00:09:53.622 --> 00:09:56.683\nrequest fulfillment is something\nthat's standardized and repeatable.\n\n186\n00:09:56.683 --> 00:10:01.764\nAnd helping users with questions\nlike I can't find, is repeatable.\n\n187\n00:10:01.764 --> 00:10:03.872\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And coming up with a approach.\n\n188\n00:10:03.872 --> 00:10:04.429\nYes, Daniel?\n\n189\n00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:07.839\n&gt;&gt; Terry, I'm thinking about this, and\nkind of wrapping my brain around it here\n\n190\n00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:10.410\nand going to that whole\nsubmit button scenario.\n\n191\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.330\nWould you say that maybe\nan incident is the user calls,\n\n192\n00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.250\nthere should be a submit button\nthere they can't find it, it's gone.\n\n193\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.020\nWhere as a request would be man it'd be\ngreat to have a submit button right here,\n\n194\n00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.470\nit sure would make our\nlives a whole lot easier.\n\n195\n00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.859\nThat would be more of a request.\n\n196\n00:10:23.859 --> 00:10:27.810\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, very good example and\npoints to a very interesting topic here.\n\n197\n00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.850\nCan a request such as for\nrequest fulfillment,\n\n198\n00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.785\ncan it lead to a change being made?\n\n199\n00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:37.727\nAbsolutely, let's draw\nsome distinctions here.\n\n200\n00:10:37.727 --> 00:10:39.070\nA very good segue, Daniel.\n\n201\n00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.000\nRemember in change management\nback in Foundations,\n\n202\n00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.440\nwe learned that there's\nthree types of changes.\n\n203\n00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.920\nThere is a standard change,\nan emergency change and a normal change.\n\n204\n00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.493\nNow a standard change is a change\nthat goes through the change of\n\n205\n00:10:53.493 --> 00:10:56.953\napproval process one\ntime to get fully vetted.\n\n206\n00:10:56.953 --> 00:11:01.568\nAnd after it's been fully vetted,\na standard change can be integrated any\n\n207\n00:11:01.568 --> 00:11:06.560\nnumber of times after that without going\nback through that process of approval.\n\n208\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.660\nSo we use some examples back in about\nmaybe a standard change could include,\n\n209\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.250\nyou need updated database\nwith more table space.\n\n210\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.150\nIt's a fairly repeatable process.\n\n211\n00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.090\nIt's understood how it's\nsupposed to happen.\n\n212\n00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.060\nYou know how it's tested.\n\n213\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.026\nYou know how it's verified.\n\n214\n00:11:23.026 --> 00:11:26.470\nSo when you need more table space,\ndon't go back to the CAB.\n\n215\n00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.320\nDon't go back to change advisory board for\napproval.\n\n216\n00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.620\nYou've got it approved once.\n\n217\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.320\nGo ahead and implement it.\n\n218\n00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.994\nSo that's the standard change, got it?\n\n219\n00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:39.000\nNow, some standard changes\ncould have in front of them\n\n220\n00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.380\na request fulfillment process.\n\n221\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.250\nSo for instance,\nI need software installed.\n\n222\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.141\nSoftware installation is a change, right?\n\n223\n00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:52.608\nBut you've standardized this software\ninstallation change, meaning you don't\n\n224\n00:11:52.608 --> 00:11:56.450\nhave to go back for approval, so\nyou put a request engine in front of it.\n\n225\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:01.710\nNow, back to the submit button,\nrequesting new functionality,\n\n226\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.830\nlike the addition of a submit button,\nis probably not a standard thing.\n\n227\n00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.300\nWe don't just change application\ninterfaces without going through\n\n228\n00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.010\na full vetting process and\nfull testing process.\n\n229\n00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.600\nSo it's a really good distinction between\n\n230\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.920\nthat you could have requests\nin front of a standard change.\n\n231\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.780\nNot all standard changes need to have a\nrequest to fill a process in front of him.\n\n232\n00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:29.530\nAnd not all requests necessarily result in\na technical change being executed, right?\n\n233\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.570\nSo very good distinctions,\nvery good segue.\n\n234\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.650\nAnd a way to keep good fences and good\nneighbors among these processes, right?\n\n235\n00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.780\nWhich, of course,\nITIL wants you to find well.\n\n236\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.640\nMaking sure you know where\none process ends and\n\n237\n00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.480\nanother process picks up is an important\naspect of your process modeling.\n\n238\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.700\nVery good.\n\n239\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.051\nAll right, so\nlet's have a look at a few things here.\n\n240\n00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:51.049\nFirst of all, you're going to be logging,\n\n241\n00:12:51.049 --> 00:12:54.650\ncoming up with an information system\nthat can keep up with your request.\n\n242\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.040\nIt's not unusual for\n\n243\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.400\nrequest to be logged in the same\nplace that incidents are logged.\n\n244\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.488\nIt's not unusual.\n\n245\n00:13:01.488 --> 00:13:03.743\nIt could be that they're\ncompletely separate.\n\n246\n00:13:03.743 --> 00:13:07.203\nIf they're within the same, they're\ncertainly going to distinguish these two.\n\n247\n00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.270\nIt's not the same as an incident.\n\n248\n00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:14.430\nSo you're going to manage the identifier\nrequest separately from an incident,\n\n249\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.360\neven if you're using the same tool set.\n\n250\n00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.380\nIs it a valid request?\n\n251\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.270\nIf I call and say,\nI want access to the HR database\n\n252\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.340\nbecause I wanna see everyone's salaries,\nis that a valid request?\n\n253\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.400\n&gt;&gt; I'll say yes for me.\n\n254\n00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, maybe it is.\n\n255\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.545\nMaybe Daniel,\nyou're the new compensation analyst and\n\n256\n00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:35.650\nare supposed to have access to it.\n\n257\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:40.032\nOr perhaps you're just a rogue trying to\nspy on other people's private information.\n\n258\n00:13:40.032 --> 00:13:41.361\nSo that's what validation is about.\n\n259\n00:13:41.361 --> 00:13:43.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Request validation,\n\n260\n00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.000\nis it an appropriate\nrequest to made in general?\n\n261\n00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.075\nOr I call the service desk,\nI want five iPads.\n\n262\n00:13:49.075 --> 00:13:54.767\nOr I call the server team and\nsay I want five virtual servers and\n\n263\n00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:59.970\nI need them to have 16 gigs\nof memory each, right?\n\n264\n00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.250\nIs that a valid request?\n\n265\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.770\nThat kind of thing.\n\n266\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.160\nThe request validation part is simply,\nis this legitimate?\n\n267\n00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.200\nIs this something that can\nlegitimately be fulfilled, right?\n\n268\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.481\nBecause not all requests are fulfillable.\n\n269\n00:14:11.481 --> 00:14:14.256\n&gt;&gt; So if I put in a request for\na Gulf Stream G5,\n\n270\n00:14:14.256 --> 00:14:16.891\nmight not be actually mission critical.\n\n271\n00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:19.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, maybe no that's right.\n\n272\n00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.345\nOr it could be such a cost point,\nfor a good example,\n\n273\n00:14:22.345 --> 00:14:24.231\nit's just prohibitive, right?\n\n274\n00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:29.174\nSo again, your policies along with your\nrequest models are going to define what's\n\n275\n00:14:29.174 --> 00:14:30.030\nlegitimate.\n\n276\n00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.120\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n277\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.110\n&gt;&gt; Of course, categorize them and\nkeep up with priorities.\n\n278\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.770\nMeasure the speed at which\nyou fulfill these, right?\n\n279\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.860\nSo by having a process in place,\nhaving a methodical approaches\n\n280\n00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.810\nto managing these is going to give\nyou the ability to control them.\n\n281\n00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:46.890\nWhich is what the goals are.\n\n282\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:53.110\nAgain, request authorization can\nhappen at a couple of levels.\n\n283\n00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.100\nOne, it could just be related\nto security issues, right?\n\n284\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.780\nAre you supposed to have\naccess to this HR data, right?\n\n285\n00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.530\nAnd also financial managements is\nother aspect of authorization.\n\n286\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.010\nAgain, if you've worked in environments\nthat has some sort of threshold,\n\n287\n00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.550\nif it was less than $50, you didn't\nhave to get management approval, right?\n\n288\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.085\nEven that might be prohibited in some\nenvironments cuz people order a headset\n\n289\n00:15:13.085 --> 00:15:14.879\neveryday and\nthey pass them out to the family, right?\n\n290\n00:15:14.879 --> 00:15:17.829\nSo it'd have to be some controls in place,\nperhaps, for\n\n291\n00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:21.570\nthe number of requests you can\nmake that meet that threshold.\n\n292\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.230\nBut certainly if I wanted to start,\nI remember this worked out\n\n293\n00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.470\nquite well the standard desktop build\nhad Microsoft Office for instance.\n\n294\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.700\nBut I needed access in project management,\nright?\n\n295\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.962\nThe combination cost upwards of $300 or\nsomething like that, so\n\n296\n00:15:35.962 --> 00:15:38.590\nI had to get a management approval for\nthat.\n\n297\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.426\nFortunately, the request tool, the ones\nwhere I requested the software that I\n\n298\n00:15:42.426 --> 00:15:45.929\nwanted, it had a way to email my boss and\nget his approval through email.\n\n299\n00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:48.914\nSo coming up with some\nself-help automation for\n\n300\n00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:54.390\nrequest fulfillment could also be a way to\nstreamline this process effectively, okay?\n\n301\n00:15:56.622 --> 00:16:01.171\nAgain, straight forward with\nthe Validation and financial approval, and\n\n302\n00:16:01.171 --> 00:16:03.460\nthen you get the review, right?\n\n303\n00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.990\nThe review is okay,\nI see you have requested this, great.\n\n304\n00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.470\nYour boss says you can have it,\nnow let's look.\n\n305\n00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.940\nOkay, you need access, you need project,\nyou even wanted this thing installed,\n\n306\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.770\nthis thing installed.\n\n307\n00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.190\nWe've got the appropriate approvals,\nokay, I'll execute all of that, right?\n\n308\n00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.760\nSo, this review port\nis just the part where\n\n309\n00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.700\nyou're actually looking at the details,\nand going to make it happen.\n\n310\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.260\nOr if I requested a server to be built,\na virtual server to be provided for\n\n311\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.020\nme, getting to request reviews,\ngonna get to the details,\n\n312\n00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.170\nwhat specifications I'm gonna\nhave to have for this, right?\n\n313\n00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.640\nAnd of course, eventually execution.\n\n314\n00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.610\nHaving the ability to reject a request\nshould also be part of the workflow.\n\n315\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.660\nAnd having the ability potentially\nto reopen the same request,\n\n316\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.110\ncould be effective.\n\n317\n00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.990\nI recall once, just as an example,\n\n318\n00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.020\nI requested the install\nof mind mapping software.\n\n319\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.830\nI forget what the name of it was.\n\n320\n00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.470\nAnd my manager saw that I actually\nrequested the wrong version.\n\n321\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.520\nSo, the work flow didn't\ngive him a chance to say,\n\n322\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.540\nops wrong version,\nhe just had to reject it, right?\n\n323\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.290\nSo, that particular installation\nwas part of a big request for\n\n324\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.900\naccess, for project,\nfor mind mapping, etc.\n\n325\n00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.840\nCould I just reopen it and\nchange the version of it?\n\n326\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.082\nThat would be convenient for me.\n\n327\n00:17:19.082 --> 00:17:23.060\nRight, in that particular case, I\ncouldn't, I had to start a new request and\n\n328\n00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.410\nadd everything into it.\n\n329\n00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.799\nSo you see, the level of pain,\n\n330\n00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:29.547\nthe level of gain, you need to manage that\nin request fulfillment process as well.\n\n331\n00:17:29.547 --> 00:17:34.773\nThe ability to reopen a rejected request\ncould be a nice way to streamline some of\n\n332\n00:17:34.773 --> 00:17:40.558\nthese things, especially if the request is\nfor something of some level of complexity.\n\n333\n00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:44.188\nCuz you don't wanna put that burden back\non the user to respecify everything,\n\n334\n00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:45.680\nwhich points to another thing.\n\n335\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.850\nIt should be easy.\n\n336\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.605\nRight, I've certainly filled out forms\nwhere I don't even know what information\n\n337\n00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:50.600\nthey're looking for there.\n\n338\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.010\nAnd it says it's required.\n\n339\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.130\nSo now, I gotta call someone, says,\nwhat are you looking for here?\n\n340\n00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:59.410\nAll of a sudden, you're interjecting\npain into the process instead of gain.\n\n341\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.860\nSo, that's the nature of the beast.\n\n342\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.390\nAs you take this approach on exams,\nyou're gonna be looking for\n\n343\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.220\nthings like the governance,\nwhat models do you have in place?\n\n344\n00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.510\nWhat approval mechanisms?\n\n345\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.730\nDo you allow for self-help?\n\n346\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.453\nRight, I'm not saying those\nare the right answers necessarily, but\n\n347\n00:18:15.453 --> 00:18:17.080\nthat's how you can approve the process.\n\n348\n00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.593\nStreamline it through self-help,\nstreamline it through request models, so\n\n349\n00:18:22.593 --> 00:18:25.170\nthat they're repeatable and\nunderstood by everyone, etc.\n\n350\n00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.250\nAll right?\n\n351\n00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.200\nOf course, you also need to\nconsider what CI's are impacted.\n\n352\n00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.920\nWho touches these things?\n\n353\n00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.280\nDoes it require a change process?\n\n354\n00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.490\nAs Daniel pointed out,\nyou want to add a submit button?\n\n355\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.690\nYou know what, that's probably a bit\nmore complex in putting a request\n\n356\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.550\nengine in front of it.\n\n357\n00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.330\nIt's not necessary repeatable,\nbut if it is for\n\n358\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.040\na standard change,\nyou can definitely get some benefits for\n\n359\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.830\nputting a request engine in\nfront of the standard change.\n\n360\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:59.550\nAll right, so,\ncould you update the currency rates?\n\n361\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:04.180\nBecause we need to manage\nforeign currencies in here.\n\n362\n00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.060\nSo again, we've gone through the cab\nbefore about these currency changes.\n\n363\n00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.100\nWe're just changing one field in\na database, changing a number, and\n\n364\n00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.350\nwe have a way to test it.\n\n365\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.090\nSo, put some request\ninches in front of that.\n\n366\n00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.810\nSo, when the Germans in your organization,\nthe German geography,\n\n367\n00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.680\nwants to change the currency rate,\nit's gone through some reviews.\n\n368\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.767\nThey request it,\n\n369\n00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:28.629\nit goes through a normal process of\nvetting that it's a valid request, right?\n\n370\n00:19:28.629 --> 00:19:31.945\nAnd then make the change without going\nthrough change management in full,\n\n371\n00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:32.478\nall right?\n\n372\n00:19:32.478 --> 00:19:37.140\nSo, that's the reason why you put CI\nanalysis in your request fulfillment\n\n373\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:42.329\nprocess, is so you touch the right things\nand keep your hands off the other things.\n\n374\n00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.990\nGood, of course, eventually, you close.\n\n375\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.170\nYou close off the request, and\nmake sure everything is tied up.\n\n376\n00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:56.530\nAnd again, if the service desk\nis in the front end of this,\n\n377\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.189\nthe service desk should\nbe there at closure.\n\n378\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.940\nIf you have a self-help system, obviously\nyou are trying to automate this interface\n\n379\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.346\nwith the users,\nwhich is totally legitimate, right?\n\n380\n00:20:06.346 --> 00:20:09.638\nIf the service desk is\ninvolved with the opening,\n\n381\n00:20:09.638 --> 00:20:13.341\nthey should be involved with the closing,\nand that could be the way you go about it.\n\n382\n00:20:13.341 --> 00:20:16.310\nAnother approach to this\nis that the service desk\n\n383\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.250\ndoes it on behalf of the users.\n\n384\n00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.850\nSo, the service desk keeps up with\nall the different request tools, and\n\n385\n00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.940\nthe user just provides over the phone or\n\n386\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.960\nthrough an email the various\nparameters for the request.\n\n387\n00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.340\nAnd the service desk\nexecutes on their behalf.\n\n388\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.910\nThat's not unusual.\n\n389\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.540\nBut keep in mind that the service\ndesk could be excluded,\n\n390\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.880\nif you have some sort of other\ninterface with your users.\n\n391\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.380\nOkay, all right.\n\n392\n00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.520\nCertainly, inputs outputs\nare straightforward,\n\n393\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.320\nas well as potential integration\nwith other processes.\n\n394\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.580\nCertainly, service level\nmanagement could be involved.\n\n395\n00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.077\nYour service catalogue's gonna list the\nlist of services that could be requested,\n\n396\n00:20:56.077 --> 00:20:59.132\nchange management,\nwe have already talked about that.\n\n397\n00:20:59.132 --> 00:21:02.714\nIncidence management, close to related,\naccess management, and\n\n398\n00:21:02.714 --> 00:21:04.391\nfinancial management, also.\n\n399\n00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:06.499\nWe kinda talked about those\npoints of interfaces,\n\n400\n00:21:06.499 --> 00:21:09.860\nwe went through the discussion of\nwhat kind of things can be requested.\n\n401\n00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.150\nSometimes, it is a request for\n\n402\n00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.940\naccess to particular assets, or\nit requires financial approval.\n\n403\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.690\nRight, that it could be using the same\nsystem as incident management, right, etc.\n\n404\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.240\nAnd certainly, using the same function,\nthe service desk.\n\n405\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.730\nAll right, very good.\n\n406\n00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:30.720\nAs we're getting to a point of review\nhere, looking at critical success\n\n407\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.980\nfactors in KPIs, again, as I've done with\nthe other processes, I wanna reinforce.\n\n408\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.370\nI'm not gonna read these to you,\nbut I want to reinforce this idea.\n\n409\n00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.550\nIf you can read the CSS and KPIs and\n\n410\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.890\nimmediately assimilate what they mean,\nand how it relates to this process, and\n\n411\n00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:52.120\nyou can understand immediately how\nthe KPIs support those critical factors.\n\n412\n00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.772\nIt's a great point of review, or\n\n413\n00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:56.136\nvalidation that you\nunderstand this process.\n\n414\n00:21:56.136 --> 00:22:01.232\nSo, I highly encourage you, as you begin\nto review for any of these processes,\n\n415\n00:22:01.232 --> 00:22:05.811\nyou begin with an understanding of\na critical success factors in KPIs.\n\n416\n00:22:05.811 --> 00:22:09.385\nIf you drive through those,\nyou're going to find your weak spots, and\n\n417\n00:22:09.385 --> 00:22:12.710\nyou're also going to validate\nyour strengths, okay?\n\n418\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.940\nSo, that concludes our conversation\nabout request of film.\n\n419\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.500\nThere's a good self-study out there for\nyou.\n\n420\n00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.690\nThere's a couple, there's an exercise\nlater request to film it.\n\n421\n00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.356\nAnd I mentioned these critical success\nfactors in KPIs as a good point of review.\n\n422\n00:22:23.356 --> 00:22:26.240\nOf course, there is a discussion\nform available for you, and\n\n423\n00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.969\nmust not forget the practice exams.\n\n424\n00:22:27.969 --> 00:22:33.294\nThe practice exams are also key to\nhelp you prepare for the exam itself.\n\n425\n00:22:33.294 --> 00:22:36.538\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, well, I don't think\nthere's anything I could add to that,\n\n426\n00:22:36.538 --> 00:22:37.983\nI think he hit a home run on this one.\n\n427\n00:22:37.983 --> 00:22:42.340\nWe do appreciate in disseminating all\nthis wonderful information for us.\n\n428\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.810\nSo obviously, we can be even\nbetter prepared for our OSA exam.\n\n429\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.900\nBut that being said, looks like it's that\ntime, yet again, for us to sign off.\n\n430\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.410\nFor ITPro.TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n431\n00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n432\n00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.345\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n433\n00:22:55.345 --> 00:23:01.375\n[MUSIC]\n\n434\n00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:03.325\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.383\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:10.470\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.780\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.090\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n9\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.750\nin today's episode, we are continuing\non with more on our ITIL OSA series.\n\n10\n00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.560\nAnd I know you'll love that series and,\nof course, we love the man, the myth,\n\n11\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.280\nthe legend that is Terry Decker,\nhe's back with us today.\n\n12\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.510\nTerry, welcome back, sir, we're so\nglad to have you yet again.\n\n13\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.730\n&gt;&gt; I am very glad to be here, and\nthe topic continues to grow here.\n\n14\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.940\nThis is a really short little episode\nthat's trying to put service operation in\n\n15\n00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.296\nthe context of the whole life cycle stage.\n\n16\n00:00:41.296 --> 00:00:43.050\nSo, it's really is just kind\nof setting the table for\n\n17\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.070\ndiving deeper into the processes and\nfunctions of service operation.\n\n18\n00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo this is basically how, we,\n\n19\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.890\nas the service operation\nportion of the entity,\n\n20\n00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.940\nlock into the rest of that\nITIL outlook on that.\n\n21\n00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.270\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, absolutely.\n\n22\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.370\n&gt;&gt; Very high level.\n\n23\n00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.415\nVery brief, in fact.\n\n24\n00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:02.585\nBut we've got to remind ourselves\njust what is service operations\n\n25\n00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:03.665\nas a whole stage?\n\n26\n00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:05.075\nWhat does it try to get done?\n\n27\n00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:09.625\nSo if you look here the objectives of\nservice operations, the purpose down there\n\n28\n00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:14.615\nin the blue is also important as well, but\nthis is where the rubber meets the road.\n\n29\n00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:18.455\nThis is when the customers actually can\nstart getting value from the service.\n\n30\n00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:22.140\nAs the service is winding it's\nway through service strategy,\n\n31\n00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.440\nthrough service design and\nservice transition.\n\n32\n00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.350\nThe customers and users aren't yet\nusing the service right or\n\n33\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.490\nthey're not getting the changes that\nwere promised by the service etcetera.\n\n34\n00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.920\nSo ultimately what happens in service\noperations is you're delivering that\n\n35\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.510\nvalue and you're going to be maintaining\nbusiness satisfaction with the service.\n\n36\n00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.083\nMake sure you're doing it in a measurable\nway, ensure that you're always getting\n\n37\n00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:50.593\nbetter, and that ultimately that\ncustomers are more satisfied.\n\n38\n00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:52.581\nThis is where it happens\nin service operations.\n\n39\n00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:55.650\nIt's all kind of just back end stuff.\n\n40\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.290\nIt's important, I'm certainly not\nminimizing strategy, design and\n\n41\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.660\ntransition, those are critical\nto success for IT services.\n\n42\n00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.740\nAbsolutely critical, but\nthe customer doesn't see those.\n\n43\n00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.750\nThis is what the customer sees\nwhen you're operating the service.\n\n44\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.854\nTherefore, you need to be\ndressed in your Sunday finest,\n\n45\n00:02:12.854 --> 00:02:15.721\nproviding the best face forward, etc.\n\n46\n00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:19.190\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this is kind of our guiding star\nwhen we're dealing with customers.\n\n47\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.850\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it's where customers\ninterface with the service,\n\n48\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.490\nit's where they get the value\nof the service, etc.\n\n49\n00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.710\nSo in that regard, highly important and\n\n50\n00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.010\ncritical to the success of the service is\nto make sure you operate it effectively.\n\n51\n00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz you could be the best\nIT shop in the whole world, and\n\n52\n00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.135\nif your customer hates your product,\nyou're not gonna have anymore customers.\n\n53\n00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:39.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n54\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.110\nSo when you consider service operation\nobviously the purpose is to deliver\n\n55\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.300\nthe value intended.\n\n56\n00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.030\nRight?\nYou're operating the service.\n\n57\n00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.970\nSo in scope to do that in scope\nthe server systems themselves.\n\n58\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.530\nAnd of course the servers operations\nyou can be operating all the services.\n\n59\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.060\nSo the scope is broad.\n\n60\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.790\nSo the fact services is plural here,\n\n61\n00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.340\nyou're operating more than one service\nwhen you are in operations, right?\n\n62\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.100\nThat is also important.\n\n63\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.940\nSo all the interactions among those\nservices is gonna be important to monitor.\n\n64\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.720\nOf course your service\nmanagement processes.\n\n65\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.750\nIT management defines five.\n\n66\n00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.840\nIf you go to ITIL operations, service\noperations, describes five processes.\n\n67\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.780\nWe are going to be diving into\nall five of those, right?\n\n68\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.980\nIt also,\nis necessarily managing the technology.\n\n69\n00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.500\nRight?\n\n70\n00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.160\nServers need patching.\n\n71\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.940\nNetworks need updated.\n\n72\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.480\nYou need security in play.\n\n73\n00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.020\nYou have lots of things playing out in\ntechnology that needs to be in play right?\n\n74\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.750\nSo you've got to maintain that technology.\n\n75\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.189\nIt could be, the data centers need to be\ncool, you need to have power supplies,\n\n76\n00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.078\nperhaps generators for\nlightning strikes, etc., like that.\n\n77\n00:03:45.078 --> 00:03:50.070\nSo technology could be lots of\ndifferent things, from the very minutia\n\n78\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.920\nof applications to the big picture things\nlike an entire data center, right?\n\n79\n00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.770\nAnd, of course, the people.\n\n80\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.920\nAnd when you talk about people,\nyou're really talking about the functions,\n\n81\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.250\nthat people exist in these\ndifferent functions.\n\n82\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.100\nWe're also gonna talk about\nthose four functions, too.\n\n83\n00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.670\nService desk, IT operations management,\ntechnology management, and\n\n84\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.850\napplications management.\n\n85\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.737\nSo the scope of service\noperations is broad, right?\n\n86\n00:04:11.737 --> 00:04:14.380\nAnd when you talk about the functions,\nit's also deep.\n\n87\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.350\nBecause you don't just operate services,\n\n88\n00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.090\nyou make sure that they have\nthe appropriate strategies,\n\n89\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.300\nthat they're well designed,\nthat they're transition and tested well.\n\n90\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.780\nSo even though we're talking about service\noperations we're gonna talk about a group\n\n91\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.510\nof people or groups of people that\nactually have their fingers in the pie\n\n92\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.310\nup through the life cycle stages as well.\n\n93\n00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.490\nOkay, so a rather broad scope.\n\n94\n00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.080\nAll right, now the value.\n\n95\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.400\nWe've talked about value in\nterms of warranty and utility.\n\n96\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.930\nThere's also value from\nthe business perspective.\n\n97\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.900\nIt's gonna be based on customer outcomes.\n\n98\n00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.120\nAre they able to do something faster?\n\n99\n00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.990\nCan they do something more reliable?\n\n100\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.239\nAre they able to sell more widgets\nbecause the IT service is in place.\n\n101\n00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:01.497\nCan they have fewer regulatory\nfindings from auditors,\n\n102\n00:05:01.497 --> 00:05:04.710\nbecause IT is providing good services?\n\n103\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.870\nWhat is the business trying to get done?\n\n104\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.820\nFaster, better, stronger,\nwhat's the business trying to do?\n\n105\n00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.180\nIn service operations,\nthat's when that value is realized, right?\n\n106\n00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.340\nSo the business outcomes peppered\nwith a high dose of preferences and\n\n107\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.000\nperceptions is gonna be driving the value\nproposition on behalf of the business.\n\n108\n00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.490\nI remember in foundation I described\nthat perception, preferences and\n\n109\n00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.060\nbusiness outcomes, that three legged\nstool of value is also right here in play\n\n110\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.230\nwhen you consider service operations.\n\n111\n00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.960\nYou have to consider all three legs.\n\n112\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.970\nWhat do we mean by that?\n\n113\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.970\nIf you designed a well functioning\napplication that's not available,\n\n114\n00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.130\nthen their perception are is,\nwell it's slow, right.\n\n115\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.600\nMaybe all the functionality is there,\n\n116\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.370\nmaybe they can do better\nthen they did before, but\n\n117\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.400\nif they perceive it as being slow,\nthen, unfortunately, it's slow, right?\n\n118\n00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.290\nTheir perception is reality\nin terms of the business.\n\n119\n00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.170\nNow that doesn't mean\nthe customer's always right.\n\n120\n00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.130\nIt just means you have to manage\nthose perceptions, all right?\n\n121\n00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.430\nSo if they think it's slow, let's\nmake sure we understand what slow is.\n\n122\n00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.990\nRight?\n\n123\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.460\nIf they're trying to run a query\nagainst the backend database,\n\n124\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.410\nthat is very complex.\n\n125\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.630\nIt may be takes 5 minute to\ngenerate that report, right?\n\n126\n00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.400\nThat might be the appropriate\nexpectations, right?\n\n127\n00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.600\nOr may be it's broken, and\nmay be it should be improved.\n\n128\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.627\nThat's the kind of thing that you\nhave to manage in service operations.\n\n129\n00:06:29.627 --> 00:06:34.486\nThe perception versus\nreality is a difficult stage\n\n130\n00:06:34.486 --> 00:06:38.329\nthat operations straddle all the time.\n\n131\n00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:42.440\nAll right, now considering\noptimizing service operations.\n\n132\n00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.650\nIt actually happens in two time frames,\nlong term and short term.\n\n133\n00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.940\nYou need to be regularly\nimproving your services.\n\n134\n00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.900\nSo you pay attention to\nthe early warning indicators\n\n135\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.130\nof performance failures principally.\n\n136\n00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.490\nFor instance, incident management,\nhow responsive is your service desk?\n\n137\n00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.454\nDoes the phone ring ten times before\na service desk person answers?\n\n138\n00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:04.334\nOr is it always picked\nup on the first call?\n\n139\n00:07:04.334 --> 00:07:07.412\nI mean, literally that could\nbe something measured but\n\n140\n00:07:07.412 --> 00:07:10.235\nalso could point to your\nshort term improvements.\n\n141\n00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:13.545\nWell let's get that from 10 rings\nto 4 rings, could we please?\n\n142\n00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:15.270\nRight, you can monitor\nthose kind of things.\n\n143\n00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:21.280\nAnd then over time, maybe you need\nmore phones or more technicians.\n\n144\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.762\nOr better services of\nphone doesn't even ring.\n\n145\n00:07:23.762 --> 00:07:27.447\nI mean long term improvements\nare certainly in the scopes of\n\n146\n00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:31.600\nService Operations as well as\nthe day to day improvements.\n\n147\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.520\nSo when you consider a methodology for\n\n148\n00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.276\nimprovement of the service operations,\nyou should consider a methodology of\n\n149\n00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:42.860\nimprovement that considers both time\nframes, both long term and short term.\n\n150\n00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.530\nAs we take these concepts that we just\ntalked about in service operations\n\n151\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.490\nforward, and to looking at\nthe details of individual processes\n\n152\n00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.330\nit's necessary to keep coming back and\ntouching on this particular aspect.\n\n153\n00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.380\nThat we will measure performance,\n\n154\n00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.990\nthat will do so\nin a business relevant way right?\n\n155\n00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.500\nAnd that ultimately the satisfaction\nof the business is maintained.\n\n156\n00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.810\nThat's it.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Terry thank you.\n\n157\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.752\nYou weren't kidding you said\nthis was a short episode,\n\n158\n00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:16.640\nit's definitely a short one, but\nalso it is a necessary episode.\n\n159\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.340\nWe need to understand these concepts,\nbecause we're gonna continue to build,\n\n160\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.700\nthat's all what we're doing.\n\n161\n00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.030\nWe're setting the stage as it were for\n\n162\n00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.100\nthe upcoming information that you need\nto take in so that we have an all,\n\n163\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.180\na common language which we all speak so\nthat you understand everything.\n\n164\n00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.540\nTerry, thanks so much for this episode,\nwe appreciate you dropping by.\n\n165\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.170\nWe also appreciate our audience for\njoining us, but\n\n166\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:41.112\nit looks like it is that time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n167\n00:08:41.112 --> 00:08:42.564\nI've been your host, Daniel

00:00:12.064\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:13.978\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:16.476\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:18.482\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:23.170\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with more on our ITIL OSA content.\n\n8\n00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.600\nThat's right, and joining us back in the\nstudio is our good friend and mentor, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.420\nTerry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.910\nTerry, welcome back, man, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.530\n&gt;&gt; Daniel, happy to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.864\nWe've been looking at\nITIL Operational Support Analysis and\n\n13\n00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:37.083\nwe've gone through a few\nprocesses in previous episodes.\n\n14\n00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:38.570\nWe've gone through incident management.\n\n15\n00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.450\nProblem management, event management,\nand request fulfillment.\n\n16\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.330\nThere's only one more process\nleft in service operations,\n\n17\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.750\nit's called access management.\n\n18\n00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.675\nAnd it is a process that is generally\nfairly intuitively grasped by most\n\n19\n00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:54.205\nstudents because we deal\nwith access management,\n\n20\n00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:58.405\neither as a user or\nperhaps as a practitioner of the process.\n\n21\n00:00:58.405 --> 00:00:59.560\nYou maintain a password.\n\n22\n00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.380\nYou have an identity.\n\n23\n00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.990\nYou log on.\n\n24\n00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.160\nYou get things because you log on.\n\n25\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.460\nSome things you don't get access to\nbecause you don't have the right level of\n\n26\n00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.680\npermissions right.\n\n27\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.028\nIt's all based on managing\nyour identity and\n\n28\n00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:13.790\ngiving you access to the things\nyou're supposed to have access to.\n\n29\n00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.500\nWhile keeping those people that\naren't supposed to have access\n\n30\n00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.250\naway from those things right.\n\n31\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.880\nSo that's the ultimately\npurpose of access management,\n\n32\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.841\nto make sure the right people have it and\nthe wrong people don't.\n\n33\n00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:27.938\nI think we just need to expand just\na little bit our awareness of this and\n\n34\n00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:32.610\nthat we're talking about IT service\nmanagement as opposed to a solution.\n\n35\n00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.685\nAnd it all ends up being\nabout the same thing, but\n\n36\n00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:40.185\nkeep in mind that giving access to\na service can be a little bit different\n\n37\n00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:44.620\nkind of challenge than giving access\nto a server or to an application.\n\n38\n00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.790\nImagine this your TV,\ncable TV provider, as an example.\n\n39\n00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.210\nYou certainly have a set top box and\n\n40\n00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.900\nyou have, perhaps that's how\nyou get your permissions.\n\n41\n00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.118\nThey're managing your access back\nin a control center somewhere.\n\n42\n00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:03.318\nSo the cable's connected to\nthe back of your TV or to a box and\n\n43\n00:02:03.318 --> 00:02:05.010\nit comes into your house.\n\n44\n00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.192\nBut how is it controlled as to\nwhat you get to view, right?\n\n45\n00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:13.954\nIf you have a pay per view option,\nthen you get to view it when you pay or\n\n46\n00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:16.102\nwhen you agree to pay, right?\n\n47\n00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:19.580\nIf you don't have the pay per view option,\nthen you don't get the chance to do that.\n\n48\n00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.530\nIf you haven't subscribed to HBO or\n\n49\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.240\nthe premium channels,\nyou don't get access to them.\n\n50\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.150\nNow again, it's not because\nthey've granted you, as a person,\n\n51\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.260\na digital identity.\n\n52\n00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.450\nThey some how given your service identity.\n\n53\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.770\nThey've given you a particular identity to\nthat set top box or that sort of thing.\n\n54\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.731\nService access management is perhaps\na little bit different concept than\n\n55\n00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:45.750\nuser access management in some context.\n\n56\n00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.491\nSo just remember to keep\nthe box fairly open and\n\n57\n00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:51.460\nfairly big when you\nconsider access management.\n\n58\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.230\nAnyway, why bother with access management.\n\n59\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.770\nI know, my friend Daniel here is\ninvolved in some security courses.\n\n60\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.300\nHe's trying to figure\nout how to get around\n\n61\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.980\nsome security ideas with a penetration\ntesting course coming up soon, so,\n\n62\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.000\nwhat does access management mean to,\nwhy do it?\n\n63\n00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.984\n&gt;&gt; Why do Access Management?\n\n64\n00:03:09.984 --> 00:03:12.741\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because you don't want the wrong people\n\n65\n00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:14.601\naccessing the wrong things.\n\n66\n00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:19.465\nEven innocuously, there' s something that\nthey wouldn't think to do purposely to\n\n67\n00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.298\nhurt you unmaliciously.\n\n68\n00:03:21.298 --> 00:03:24.060\nThey could still possibly hurt you\n\n69\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.000\nif they have access to things\nthey just don't need access to.\n\n70\n00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.480\nIf Terry is a what does he need\naccess to our back up systems?\n\n71\n00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.760\nNothing.\nHe's gonna manage a database, and\n\n72\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.720\nI'm the backup administrator,\nhe can come in trying to be helpful,\n\n73\n00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.260\nyeah I think I saw this cool command for\nour backups, and\n\n74\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.820\nhe wipes out all our backups and\nthey're gone.\n\n75\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.000\nAccidentally did it,\ndidn't do it maliciously, but\n\n76\n00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.930\nhe doesn't need that access to that so\nwe don't give it to him.\n\n77\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.570\nIt's foundational to\nsecurity in any IT system.\n\n78\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.980\n&gt;&gt; Very good, thanks,\nDaniel, and a good segue.\n\n79\n00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.690\nThis is, indeed, a operational\nextension of security management.\n\n80\n00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.730\nYou may recall that, in service design,\n\n81\n00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.260\nyou define your security management\nprocess for the given services.\n\n82\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.430\nAnd you back that up with solid policies.\n\n83\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.290\nSo security management as a process\nis designed into services.\n\n84\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.490\nAccess management is the operational\nextension of that process to make\n\n85\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.150\nsure that you're granting the right people\non a day to day basis what they need.\n\n86\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.710\nSo, good.\n\n87\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.539\nThat also weighs into\nthe whole idea of governance.\n\n88\n00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.534\nYou're doing this for a reason and\nyou have to do it in a measured way.\n\n89\n00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:36.810\nTaking apart the obstacles\nof granting access right?\n\n90\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.746\nYou don't wanna give it to everyone,\nas Daniel said.\n\n91\n00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:41.870\nIt doesn't have to be malicious,\n\n92\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.980\nyou just don't want the wrong\npeople getting access to things.\n\n93\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.820\nThere's sensitive information\nthat has to be protected.\n\n94\n00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.940\nMaybe it's proprietory information\nthat gives your organisation\n\n95\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.240\ncompetitive advantage.\n\n96\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.588\nOr maybe you have regulatory reasons\nto keep data more secure such as you\n\n97\n00:04:54.588 --> 00:04:56.118\nknow hospital records.\n\n98\n00:04:56.118 --> 00:05:01.040\nHIPAA is a classic for medical information\nand health information being protected.\n\n99\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.450\nFinancial information is protected.\n\n100\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.140\nYour banks hopefully are taking good care\nof your information that's personal to you\n\n101\n00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.080\nand not sharing that with people\nthat aren't authorized to see it.\n\n102\n00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.720\nThat type of thing.\n\n103\n00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.351\nSo there could be regulatory pressures.\n\n104\n00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:15.939\nTheir concern would be proprietary\nbusiness pressure but, overall, what it's\n\n105\n00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.487\ntrying to do is make sure the right people\nget access and the wrong people don't.\n\n106\n00:05:19.487 --> 00:05:25.439\nAnd to do so you need to have some fairly\nsophisticated means of managing groups\n\n107\n00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:32.110\nof people at the same time, managing\nthe people's identities at the same time.\n\n108\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.460\nAnd to make sure that this\nis all governed properly.\n\n109\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.240\nAnd policies gonna help you get that down.\n\n110\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.170\nSo let's take a look at\na little exercise here.\n\n111\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.113\nWe pick up some vocabularies as we'll\ngo along and some concepts here.\n\n112\n00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:47.194\nIf you look at the words we're gonna\ntry to match the words on the left to\n\n113\n00:05:47.194 --> 00:05:48.409\nthe concepts on the right.\n\n114\n00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:49.540\nAnd we'll just go through this and\n\n115\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.610\nof course along the way we'll\nbe learning what these word are.\n\n116\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.091\nSo have a look at this and\nwe'll just continue to build these out.\n\n117\n00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:59.560\nSo what is access, right?\n\n118\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.392\nWhat is access itself, right?\n\n119\n00:06:04.392 --> 00:06:07.888\nIn this regard,\nagain looking at the context here,\n\n120\n00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:13.540\nit is the extent that a user is entitled\nto, data or service functionality, right.\n\n121\n00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.760\nThat's what access actually is.\n\n122\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.890\nSo, what is identity?\n\n123\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.929\nAlso fundamental to access management,\nidentity.\n\n124\n00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:31.764\nThis would be C, a unique characteristic\nof an individual that defines them and\n\n125\n00:06:31.764 --> 00:06:33.260\ntheir status.\n\n126\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.700\nThis is almost always built into\nsome sort of username right.\n\n127\n00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.910\nUsername, and the combination with having\na password that only you know, right?\n\n128\n00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.320\nSo the combination of you having\na username that's unique and\n\n129\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.890\na password that's unique\nform this identity.\n\n130\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.010\nThat's the primary means\nof Access Management.\n\n131\n00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.710\nThere are other ways to focus on identity.\n\n132\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.205\nAs I mentioned,\nthe service provider of your cable TV.\n\n133\n00:06:57.205 --> 00:07:02.089\nThey've identified what you're supposed to\nhave access to by other means besides just\n\n134\n00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:03.410\nyour name or username.\n\n135\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.090\nYou don't log into your TV but yet\nyou get access to some content and\n\n136\n00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.830\ndon't get access to other content.\n\n137\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.290\nSo identity can be managed by\nother means besides username and\n\n138\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.800\npasswords, it's possible.\n\n139\n00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.550\nWhat about rights?\n\n140\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.454\nWhat about rights?\n\n141\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.597\nCuz when you get to the actual\nsettings related to user's access for\n\n142\n00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:33.510\nservice, right.\n\n143\n00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.290\nThis is a collection of all\nthe things you have access to, right.\n\n144\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.510\nYou might have read,\nthe right to read some content.\n\n145\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.456\nYou might have the right to delete or\nmodify other content, right?\n\n146\n00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:49.196\nOr to, as Daniel mentioned in his example,\nyou have\n\n147\n00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:53.265\nthe right to back up the server but\nyou can't administer the server, right?\n\n148\n00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:57.773\nThose rights can also be broken\ndown in various ways All right,\n\n149\n00:07:57.773 --> 00:08:01.101\nnow this idea of services and\nservice groups.\n\n150\n00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:04.740\nIf I expanded I think you'd\nimmediately followed a right answer.\n\n151\n00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:10.590\nWhat about applications, servers,\nwhat about databases, right?\n\n152\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.990\nSo these become what you\nare granting access to, right?\n\n153\n00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.390\nThe subject of access privileges, right?\n\n154\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:26.282\nSo you're granting rights, read, delete,\nmodify to individuals, through identity.\n\n155\n00:08:26.282 --> 00:08:28.883\nSo you're granting access to\npeople you identified and\n\n156\n00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:31.130\nthose are collectively called the rights.\n\n157\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.747\nWhat do you give them access to?\n\n158\n00:08:32.747 --> 00:08:35.700\nYou give them access to services and\nservice groups.\n\n159\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.850\nAgain, ITIL is an IT service\nmanagement discipline.\n\n160\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.250\nSo we'll be using service words here.\n\n161\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:48.140\nYou might as easily just equate this\nto server, database applications.\n\n162\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.836\nIt is the subject to which\nyou're granting access, okay.\n\n163\n00:08:53.836 --> 00:08:58.329\nAnd then finally directory services is\nthe tool used to manage access and rights.\n\n164\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.722\nDirectory services can help with\nidentification of identities, it can help\n\n165\n00:09:03.722 --> 00:09:07.504\nyou manage the groups of people that\nget permissions and rights, etc.\n\n166\n00:09:07.504 --> 00:09:10.670\nActive Directory is certainly\na common one in a Microsoft network.\n\n167\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.510\nDifferent directory services exist.\n\n168\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.480\nBut it's where your user\nidentity is stored.\n\n169\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.530\nSo you log in, right, and\n\n170\n00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:21.200\nthen once you have your identity you can\nthat identity around to different assets.\n\n171\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.840\nDirectory services coud be quite simple.\n\n172\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.450\nIt just could be a simple list of who\nhas permission to come to this location.\n\n173\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.250\nSo this can be very complex,\nit can be very simple, but\n\n174\n00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.890\ndirectory services just describes where\nyou keep up with this information\n\n175\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.210\nof who we have the identity and\nwhat rights they have.\n\n176\n00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.570\nOkay, great.\n\n177\n00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.330\nSo, in addition to following\naccess management,\n\n178\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.228\nthere are lots of stages along the way.\n\n179\n00:09:49.228 --> 00:09:53.836\nI'm gonna belabor each one of these\nindividual boxes as we go a long but\n\n180\n00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:56.346\nthere is a flow to access management.\n\n181\n00:09:56.346 --> 00:10:00.507\nAnd reinforced it this flow has it\ntriggered just like any process,\n\n182\n00:10:00.507 --> 00:10:05.255\nsomething get's it started it goes\nthrough a particular set of activities.\n\n183\n00:10:05.255 --> 00:10:10.519\nThere could be kickouts do some approval,\nthere could be some\n\n184\n00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:16.001\nkickouts to some security metrics or\nsecurity concerns, etc.\n\n185\n00:10:16.001 --> 00:10:18.330\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at some of these.\n\n186\n00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.260\nFirst of all some were the triggers or\nsources of access management.\n\n187\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.080\nIt could just simply\nbe a standard request.\n\n188\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.660\nYou could put in front of access\nmanagement a very successful\n\n189\n00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.660\nrequest fulfillment program, right,\nor a request fulfillment process.\n\n190\n00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.040\nSo that a user can go to\nthe particular web forum or\n\n191\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.580\nmaybe call a service desk to say,\nI need to have access to this.\n\n192\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.190\nNow it's not very common if I'm a new\nemployee and I'm gonna be the compensation\n\n193\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.640\nanalyst, I'd probably not going to call\nthe service desk as a matter of process\n\n194\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.010\nand say, I need access to the HR database\nso I can review everyone's salaries.\n\n195\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.020\nThat's probably not\ngonna be how this flows.\n\n196\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.660\nProbably that request is gonna\ncome from HR themselves.\n\n197\n00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.460\nThey will somehow formulate this\nformal request that I be granted\n\n198\n00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.090\nthe appropriate access.\n\n199\n00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.960\nIt could be a request for\n\n200\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.781\nchange if it's a large group of\npeople if you're doing a big bulk.\n\n201\n00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:17.976\nMaybe you're launching a new service and\n\n202\n00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:21.047\nyou need to add a bunch of people\nto it then that activity may\n\n203\n00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:25.330\nhappen under the rubric of requests for\nchange as opposed to a standard request.\n\n204\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.010\nService request same thing as\na standard request in this regard.\n\n205\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.400\nIn that I am requesting a service and\nas I request the service I get my access.\n\n206\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.910\nIt also could be part of running a script.\n\n207\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.750\nAccess management could\ndo bulk loading of users\n\n208\n00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.930\nto giving the appropriate\naccess to certain things.\n\n209\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.920\nRunning a script could also\ntake away some of these things.\n\n210\n00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.330\nIt's interesting to note that you\ncould have a request to add someone.\n\n211\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.980\nYou could have a request to\nmodify someone's permission.\n\n212\n00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.860\nYou could have a request to take\nsomeone away, or modify those, right?\n\n213\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.904\nSo the request can be for an addition,\na removal, or a modification, all right.\n\n214\n00:12:06.904 --> 00:12:12.730\n[COUGH] Certainly along the way\nyou need to verify this request.\n\n215\n00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.999\nAnd verification has two components.\n\n216\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.398\nIs it the person who they say they are?\n\n217\n00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:23.170\nAnd is the requirement that\nthey have access legitimate?\n\n218\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.290\nAs Daniel pointed out as\nan example I might be the DBA,\n\n219\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.680\nI really shouldn't be involved in\nback up and restore permissions.\n\n220\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.140\nSo if I call and say hey,\n\n221\n00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.430\nI would like permission to be able to\nbackup this server there should be some\n\n222\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.980\ndue diligence to determine whether\nI should have that, right?\n\n223\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.850\nWho am I, that I should have this?\n\n224\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.800\nDo I work in the right organization?\n\n225\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.360\nAm I authorized by the appropriate\npeople in the server team, etc?\n\n226\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.770\nNeed to add those up.\n\n227\n00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.260\nAm I who I say I am, and\nis this request requirement legitimate.\n\n228\n00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.732\nNeed to know basis, so to speak.\n\n229\n00:12:55.893 --> 00:13:00.330\nAll right, [COUGH] so when you're on\nverification, you then provide the access.\n\n230\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.660\nYou provide the permission\nat an appropriate level.\n\n231\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.710\nCertainly you could get\ninvolved with some conflicts\n\n232\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.370\nrelated to having multiple permissions.\n\n233\n00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.060\nLike I could have requested\nread access one day or\n\n234\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.210\nI'm sorry, read and write access one day.\n\n235\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.150\nAnd then another day someone else\non my behalf maybe my boss requests\n\n236\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.740\nread access for\nthe same level of assets, and\n\n237\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.940\nall of a sudden I don't have\nthe ability to write anymore.\n\n238\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.329\nSo managing those conflicts\ncan be confusing sometimes.\n\n239\n00:13:31.329 --> 00:13:35.720\nThat's why you have access management in\nplace to build up this capability and\n\n240\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.260\nmake sure it's done well.\n\n241\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.195\nOkay, good.\n\n242\n00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:46.122\nMonitoring identity status.\n\n243\n00:13:46.122 --> 00:13:50.480\nTrue story, and\nnot a pleasant one necessarily.\n\n244\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.570\nI worked for\nan organization as a contractor, and\n\n245\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.330\nI was a system administrator.\n\n246\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.890\nAnd I had administrative privileges for\nthat system that I administered,\n\n247\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.290\nthat really make sense.\n\n248\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:04.430\nBut I left the company, I left that\nrole and also I left the company.\n\n249\n00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.220\nI came back two years later.\n\n250\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.420\nNo longer a contractor,\ncame back two years later.\n\n251\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.580\nNow I'm an employee and\nsince I had an ID before,\n\n252\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.000\nI had the identity before,\nthey just enable that identity again.\n\n253\n00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.140\nSo they have to recreate\nme as an identity.\n\n254\n00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.170\nBut the unfortunate aspect of that,\nat least access management wise,\n\n255\n00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:26.950\nis I also still had access to that system,\nright?\n\n256\n00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:27.852\nAnd I wasn't gonna do any harm.\n\n257\n00:14:27.852 --> 00:14:31.490\nIt end up not being a bad thing,\nbecause I did no harm.\n\n258\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.560\nBut again, I didn't have any business\nplaying around there either.\n\n259\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.218\nAnd as this turned out, what happened is\nI ended up being a service manager for\n\n260\n00:14:38.218 --> 00:14:40.823\nthat same service or\nthat included that same service.\n\n261\n00:14:40.823 --> 00:14:44.884\nAnd we were trying to troubleshoot one\nday, a particular problem with it and\n\n262\n00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.940\nthat's when I discovered I\nhad administrative access.\n\n263\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.981\nI didn't even tried before, right?\n\n264\n00:14:50.981 --> 00:14:54.070\nWe did not have an administrator\nimmediately available at 3 o'clock in\n\n265\n00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.680\nthe morning and so and so,\nTerry used to work on this.\n\n266\n00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.260\nCan you maybe help with this?\n\n267\n00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260\nAnd I got in there, right.\n\n268\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.917\nSo I did access this system two\nyears after the fact that I should\n\n269\n00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:07.792\nhave legitimately had rights, and\nI did a little harm, not much.\n\n270\n00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:11.505\nI didn't bring the whole service down,\nI certainly didn't cause us to lose any\n\n271\n00:15:11.505 --> 00:15:15.720\nmoney or hurt anybody's regulatory\ncompliance issues or anything like that.\n\n272\n00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.480\nBut I did do something that\nhad to be fixed, right.\n\n273\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.740\nI shouldn't have been there,\nthat's really the moral of the story.\n\n274\n00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.173\nSo access management is not\njust about granting it.\n\n275\n00:15:25.173 --> 00:15:27.557\nIt is about monitoring it ongoing.\n\n276\n00:15:27.557 --> 00:15:31.406\nSo you know that the right people have\naccess and the wrong people don't.\n\n277\n00:15:31.406 --> 00:15:33.330\nAnd in this case I was a wrong person.\n\n278\n00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.230\nI should not have had that access, right?\n\n279\n00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.410\nRoles change, people leave,\npeople come back.\n\n280\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.730\nAccess management is to have\nits hands around all of it.\n\n281\n00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.020\nAnd all those particular access duties.\n\n282\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.001\nSo you keep score, you log,\nyou look at your audit logs,\n\n283\n00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:50.531\nyou continually monitor is\nthe appropriate access there.\n\n284\n00:15:50.531 --> 00:15:53.010\nI think it could be important, for\ninstance, in that particular place.\n\n285\n00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.953\nThey made it simple,\nthey took a simple approach.\n\n286\n00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:58.052\nI left the company so\nthey disabled my account.\n\n287\n00:15:58.052 --> 00:16:02.790\nBy disabling me as an identity,\ntherefore all those permissions were moot.\n\n288\n00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.970\nThey could not be used, right?\n\n289\n00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:09.120\nBut the problem with that easy fix\non my departure is when I came back,\n\n290\n00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.620\nI still had access to everything.\n\n291\n00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.670\nSo access management needs\nto be a big more methodical\n\n292\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.050\nin making sure the permissions\nare removed and granted as necessary.\n\n293\n00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in security we like\nto do role based access.\n\n294\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:21.820\nWhat is your role?\n\n295\n00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.474\nAre you a manager of some sort?\n\n296\n00:16:23.474 --> 00:16:25.313\nIf you are, what type of manager are you?\n\n297\n00:16:25.313 --> 00:16:26.955\nAre you over HR, are you over IT,\n\n298\n00:16:26.955 --> 00:16:29.662\nare you over whatever other\ndepartments you may have?\n\n299\n00:16:29.662 --> 00:16:31.218\nSales, something to that effect.\n\n300\n00:16:31.218 --> 00:16:35.615\nAnd then you grant access to the role and\nwhoever's in that role, gets the access.\n\n301\n00:16:35.615 --> 00:16:39.399\nIf you leave that role, you become\nan underling or you go leave the company,\n\n302\n00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:40.830\nyou get pulled out of there.\n\n303\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.669\nSo even if you came back, we would have to\nadd you back into that system to keep that\n\n304\n00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:47.960\neasily done watching those changes.\n\n305\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.020\n&gt;&gt; Totally agree.\n\n306\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.671\nRole based management,\ngroup-based management sometimes called,\n\n307\n00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:54.445\nyou create groups based on roles.\n\n308\n00:16:54.445 --> 00:16:56.292\nSomehow you can put them together.\n\n309\n00:16:56.292 --> 00:16:59.407\nBut having instead of granting\nme individual permissions,\n\n310\n00:16:59.407 --> 00:17:03.100\nyou grant a role of that permission and\nyou add me to that role.\n\n311\n00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.660\nSo to get rid of me or\n\n312\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.230\nfor me not to have that anymore,\nyou take me out of that role.\n\n313\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.767\nThat needs to happen as people move about\nthe company or leave the company, right?\n\n314\n00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:13.997\nSo it's a quick fix.\n\n315\n00:17:13.997 --> 00:17:15.832\nDisable the account,\nthat wipes out everything.\n\n316\n00:17:15.832 --> 00:17:18.870\nMaybe that's what you do as a security\nmanager, disable the account.\n\n317\n00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:22.729\nBut you should also follow through with\nthose other due diligence activities\n\n318\n00:17:22.729 --> 00:17:24.462\nto remove the appropriate roles.\n\n319\n00:17:24.462 --> 00:17:25.244\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n320\n00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:28.905\n&gt;&gt; And it's certainly easier to manage it\nby role than it would be by individual so\n\n321\n00:17:28.905 --> 00:17:30.240\nit's a way to group things.\n\n322\n00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.650\nA nice way.\n\n323\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.800\nSo, let's have a look at this.\n\n324\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.301\nOf course,\naccess management is involved across and\n\n325\n00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:41.658\ncross-pollinates with\nlots of other processes.\n\n326\n00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:46.448\nCertainly, information security management\nis probably the most direct link.\n\n327\n00:17:46.448 --> 00:17:49.510\nAccess management is the operational\nextension of information security\n\n328\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.000\nmanagement.\n\n329\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.190\nService catalog management could be part\nof it because service catalog is going to\n\n330\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.830\ndescribe how you access the service,\nright?\n\n331\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:03.640\nWhich could just simply mean how you\nrequest access to the service, all right?\n\n332\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.940\nSo service catalog management's gonna have\nthose indications of how someone would\n\n333\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.642\naccess the service, all right?\n\n334\n00:18:09.642 --> 00:18:12.476\nContinuity management,\navailability management,\n\n335\n00:18:12.476 --> 00:18:15.248\nsecurity management,\nall related to making sure you\n\n336\n00:18:15.248 --> 00:18:19.328\nare managing the appropriate numbers\nof people, give them the right access.\n\n337\n00:18:19.328 --> 00:18:22.976\nDemand management, how many users\nshould have access could be an issue.\n\n338\n00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:27.764\nAnd you wanna make sure that perhaps\nyou can use access management as\n\n339\n00:18:27.764 --> 00:18:30.957\nthe way to throttle demand, right, etc.?\n\n340\n00:18:30.957 --> 00:18:34.909\nService asset configuration\nmanagement is gonna produce the CMS,\n\n341\n00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:37.274\nthe Configuration Management System.\n\n342\n00:18:37.274 --> 00:18:43.130\nWhich is gonna identify all the CIs that\nmay be in scope of access management.\n\n343\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.990\nFor instance, the servers,\nthe databases, etc.\n\n344\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.870\nSo it's gonna have their names,\n\n345\n00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.850\ntheir attributes,\nperhaps their security models in place.\n\n346\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.220\nAre they using encrypted logons, etc.?\n\n347\n00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.010\nThose types of things.\n\n348\n00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.030\nAny of these, we talked about\nrequest fulfillment already.\n\n349\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:58.970\nService level management.\n\n350\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.020\nYou certainly wanna measure this process.\n\n351\n00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.570\nIt could be a critical business area or\n\n352\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.530\nbusiness concern that access\nis granted quickly, right?\n\n353\n00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.248\nMaybe it's a real fluid system of access.\n\n354\n00:19:11.248 --> 00:19:15.024\nI know I used to work and support clinical\ntrials at a pharmaceutical organization.\n\n355\n00:19:15.024 --> 00:19:19.555\nAnd the moving parts of a clinical\ntrial is that patients came,\n\n356\n00:19:19.555 --> 00:19:21.360\npatients left, right?\n\n357\n00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.521\nAnd if a patient got there and couldn't\nget access to the information right when\n\n358\n00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:29.650\nthey started, it was a very impactful\ndelay in these clinical trials.\n\n359\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.910\nSo access management was on a time clock.\n\n360\n00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.310\nIt's not that we're just gonna\nget to it by the end of the week.\n\n361\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.750\nSo we kept time.\n\n362\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.992\nHow quickly are we resolving\nthese requests for\n\n363\n00:19:38.992 --> 00:19:41.230\naccess as it relates to clinical trials?\n\n364\n00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.820\nAnd by keeping time,\nyou're effectively keeping score and\n\n365\n00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.420\ntherefore managing the effectiveness\nof this process, right?\n\n366\n00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:53.010\nSo in some environments, access management\nmay need to be very, very fluid.\n\n367\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.234\nThen therefore,\nyou might wanna put some targets and\n\n368\n00:19:55.234 --> 00:19:58.162\nagree to those targets in your\nservice level agreements, all right?\n\n369\n00:19:58.162 --> 00:20:00.312\nAll right, very good.\n\n370\n00:20:00.312 --> 00:20:06.980\nSo, as you can imagine, as we've talked\nabout this process, it is challenging.\n\n371\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:12.100\nHow do you keep on going monitoring and\nreporting on all access related activity?\n\n372\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.292\nHow do you know that\nsomeone left the company?\n\n373\n00:20:14.292 --> 00:20:18.202\nHow do you go about finding which groups\nthey should be removed from, right?\n\n374\n00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:21.680\nNow certainly access management can gain\nyou access to this through an appropriate\n\n375\n00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.100\ndirectory service.\n\n376\n00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:28.014\nBut they also have to build into this\nthe process discipline to follow through.\n\n377\n00:20:28.014 --> 00:20:31.017\nSo when I left that company and\ncame back two years later and\n\n378\n00:20:31.017 --> 00:20:33.173\nit still had all my permissions, right?\n\n379\n00:20:33.173 --> 00:20:35.933\nSo something was obviously\nbroken in that particular case.\n\n380\n00:20:35.933 --> 00:20:37.287\nHow it needed to be fixed?\n\n381\n00:20:37.287 --> 00:20:42.178\nWas it interfaced between HR, who knew\nI was leaving, and access management,\n\n382\n00:20:42.178 --> 00:20:46.740\nwho knows where all my permissions\nhave been spread out, right?\n\n383\n00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.570\nSo even knowing where all my permissions\nwere being spread out is not a easy\n\n384\n00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.260\nconcept to manage.\n\n385\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.630\nDefinitely a challenge,\nright, you need to face.\n\n386\n00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.642\nSo access management is vitally important.\n\n387\n00:20:56.642 --> 00:20:58.958\nI think, again, it's mostly intuitive.\n\n388\n00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:02.742\nAs this plays out on the exam,\nyou're gonna be looking for\n\n389\n00:21:02.742 --> 00:21:08.210\nthe value proposition of having a formal\nprocess called access management.\n\n390\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.600\nAnd that value proposition is centered\non the right people getting it,\n\n391\n00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.390\nthe wrong people not.\n\n392\n00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.240\nAnd to be able to monitor that ongoing and\nto do so quickly and\n\n393\n00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.730\nresponsively to business needs.\n\n394\n00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.609\nThat's what access managements all about.\n\n395\n00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:23.759\nHopefully you got that nice and neat.\n\n396\n00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:25.015\nThere's great places to go.\n\n397\n00:21:25.015 --> 00:21:29.139\nAs a reminder, just remember, have\na look at the critical success factors.\n\n398\n00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:32.288\nAnd the KPIs as a I've talked\nabout on these other processes.\n\n399\n00:21:32.288 --> 00:21:35.008\nComing here to critical\nsuccess factors and\n\n400\n00:21:35.008 --> 00:21:38.618\nKPIs as your first point of\nreview could be very valuable.\n\n401\n00:21:38.618 --> 00:21:42.776\nPut another way, if you can read\nthe critical success factors and\n\n402\n00:21:42.776 --> 00:21:45.735\nunderstand clearly what they're pointing.\n\n403\n00:21:45.735 --> 00:21:47.400\nAnd you can read the KPIs and\n\n404\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.200\nknow how they support those\ncritical success factors.\n\n405\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.270\nYou are a very good place of\nunderstanding this process, and\n\n406\n00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.180\nmay not need any further review.\n\n407\n00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.490\nIf, however, it reveals some fogginess, or\nnot quite clear on this, that concept or\n\n408\n00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.520\nthat concept,\n\n409\n00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.710\nit can also point to the areas of\nreinforcement you need to take on.\n\n410\n00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.280\nAnd with that said,\none final note on Access Management.\n\n411\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.630\nThere's a Directed Self Study available\nin the exercise that you can download.\n\n412\n00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:19.050\nThis is for you to go in and\nreinforce this learning.\n\n413\n00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:23.570\nYou get your hands on some scenarios and\nremember those practice exams as well.\n\n414\n00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.390\nThe practice exams\nare probably your best source\n\n415\n00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.020\nof reinforcing all we're\nlearning through OSA.\n\n416\n00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.130\nAs a way to not only\nreinforce your learning, but\n\n417\n00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.880\nget into the minds of\nthe testmaker a little bit.\n\n418\n00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.294\nThat's it for Access Management.\n\n419\n00:22:35.294 --> 00:22:35.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry.\n\n420\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.486\nI like the way you put that\nthe right people get access and\n\n421\n00:22:38.486 --> 00:22:39.667\nthe wrong people don't.\n\n422\n00:22:39.667 --> 00:22:42.380\nThat's basically what it boils\ndown to at the end of the day.\n\n423\n00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.390\nFantastic overview of that how that\nlooks inside of the ITIL OSA exam.\n\n424\n00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.490\nAppreciate that, and also the resources\nthat are available for you.\n\n425\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.633\nSo solidify those concepts in your mind so\nthat when you take the exam,\n\n426\n00:22:52.633 --> 00:22:53.767\nyou're ready for that.\n\n427\n00:22:53.767 --> 00:22:55.003\nTerry, thanks for joining us today.\n\n428\n00:22:55.003 --> 00:22:57.021\nWe appreciate you stopping by.\n\n429\n00:22:57.021 -->

00:00:11.820\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.460\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.720\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV\n\n6\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.089\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:22.276\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\non with more on our ITIL OSA series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:23.041\nAnd, of course,\n\n9\n00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:26.257\nit would be like a day without sunshine\nif we didn't have the good man back.\n\n10\n00:00:26.257 --> 00:00:27.740\nHis name, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.920\nTerry, welcome back, sir,\nwe're so glad to have you again.\n\n12\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.920\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here shining light,\npretty cool.\n\n13\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.280\nWell, we've had a pretty good journey so\nfar in our previous episodes.\n\n14\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.986\nWe went through five processes,\nincident management,\n\n15\n00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:42.440\naccess management, problem management,\nrequest fulfillment and event management.\n\n16\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.490\nNot quite in that order, but\nwe did go through those five processes.\n\n17\n00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.620\nAnd again we looked at\noperational support and analysis.\n\n18\n00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.070\nWe also looked into how you go about\nuplifting those processes through\n\n19\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.555\ngood designs and good methodologies.\n\n20\n00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.160\nWell, who gets that done,\nwho makes that happen?\n\n21\n00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.680\nNow, we're gonna move on to functions.\n\n22\n00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.500\nAnd we're gonna start, if you look at\nthe slide here, we're gonna start with\n\n23\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.390\ncharacterizing the difference\nbetween a function and a process.\n\n24\n00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490\nFunctions are groups of people or\nwhole departments that they actually\n\n25\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.497\ndo the work that happens in IT operations,\nright.\n\n26\n00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:20.120\nI abbreviate this.\n\n27\n00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.137\nFunctions are groups of people with\nspecial tools and skills, right.\n\n28\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.670\nSo your network experts live here,\nyour application experts live here.\n\n29\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.160\nYour day to day grind of IT happens here,\nright.\n\n30\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.390\nProcesses are, again, those predefined,\nstructured set of activities.\n\n31\n00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.220\nAnd we certainly have\ntalked about activities.\n\n32\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.910\nWe talked about five of\nthese here recently, right.\n\n33\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.400\nSo processes tend to be documents\nin the background, right.\n\n34\n00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.280\nPeople are the ones that\nactually execute it.\n\n35\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.760\nThey touch physical devices.\n\n36\n00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.510\nThey maintain servers.\n\n37\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.270\nThey fill up generators to keep the power\nsupplies or the power management\n\n38\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.980\nsystems up and running when there's\na power failure at the data center, right.\n\n39\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.725\nThey manage cooling systems,\nthey have wiring closets, right.\n\n40\n00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:08.400\nIt's the physical assets as well as things\nyou touch, the tools that are touched,\n\n41\n00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.350\nthe dashboards that are manipulated,\nthe reports that are made, etc.\n\n42\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.040\nSo the functions are where the people are.\n\n43\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.100\nAll through our journey of ITIL,\n\n44\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.280\neven back in foundation when we\ntalked about service strategy,\n\n45\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.030\nservice design, service transition and\nnow here at service operations, even then,\n\n46\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.660\nwe talked about processes and\nthe 26 processes that ITIL defines.\n\n47\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.017\nThese processes are actually practiced,\ndeveloped, put into life,\n\n48\n00:02:36.017 --> 00:02:40.603\nthey work or not, because you have\nspecial people managing them, right.\n\n49\n00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:41.374\nAnd the tools and\n\n50\n00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:45.210\nthe technology work because you\nhave special people managing them.\n\n51\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.770\nThe collection of all this technology,\nthe products, the tools and\n\n52\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.670\nthe processes form the services\nunderpinning everything.\n\n53\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.330\nThis is where the people are.\n\n54\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.770\nSo what we're gonna be doing first\nis going over to the service desk,\n\n55\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.370\na very special group of people, right.\n\n56\n00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.860\nThe service desk is a dedicated\nstaff responsible for\n\n57\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.200\ndealing with the issues and\nrequests that come in from users.\n\n58\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.885\nSingle point of contact.\n\n59\n00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:11.620\nITIL, again, has a strong\npredisposition for this word, single.\n\n60\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.060\nNow, we talked about incident management,\nand\n\n61\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.890\nwe talked about how the service could be\nat the front end of incident management.\n\n62\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.710\nWe also talked about\nrequest fulfillment and\n\n63\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.920\nhow it can be on the front end\nof request fulfillment, right.\n\n64\n00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.730\nSo service desk can be in front\nof both of those processes.\n\n65\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.353\nBut the function is the group of people,\nthe processes are what they are, right.\n\n66\n00:03:33.353 --> 00:03:37.800\nSo certainly, when you consider\nthe service desk, it's vitally important.\n\n67\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.945\nAs a single point of\ncontact with the end users,\n\n68\n00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:44.339\nit can make a bad service\nlook pretty good, right.\n\n69\n00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.448\nHaving good incident\nmanagement processes and\n\n70\n00:03:46.448 --> 00:03:48.879\ngood request fulfillment\nprocesses are part of this.\n\n71\n00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.807\nBut having good people with the right\ndemeanor, the right technical acumen,\n\n72\n00:03:52.807 --> 00:03:56.300\nthe right customer service\nacumen is very valuable.\n\n73\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.329\nOnce upon a time at ITIL, back in\nthe early days of ITIL, I think they\n\n74\n00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.212\nrecognized that, this is late 80s,\nearly 90s, when they were first writing\n\n75\n00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:09.568\nthese books, making a justification for\na service desk was necessary.\n\n76\n00:04:09.568 --> 00:04:14.255\nSo there's a lot of verbiage in the ITIL\nlibrary related to the value of\n\n77\n00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:19.507\nthe service desk, as if you need to sell\nthis to people to understand, right.\n\n78\n00:04:19.507 --> 00:04:24.160\nI think it's probably a bit less urgent to\nsell people on the value of a service desk\n\n79\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.200\nthese days.\n\n80\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.350\nMost people recognize the value of having\n\n81\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.020\na group of people that can face\nusers on a day to day basis.\n\n82\n00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.620\nYou're not bothering your second and\n\n83\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.140\nthird tier support people as much\nbecause they're handling the day to day.\n\n84\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.870\nThat's one of the values\nto the IT provider.\n\n85\n00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.930\nAnd you're also providing value\nto the customers because they\n\n86\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.480\nhave a single place to go, and\na known, single place to go,\n\n87\n00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.760\ninstead of saying, well, who do I call for\nthis or who do I call for that, right?\n\n88\n00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.230\nThey know they go to the service desk.\n\n89\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.945\nSo you're streamlining\nthe customer experience.\n\n90\n00:04:55.945 --> 00:05:01.010\nYou're also streamlining the IT service\nprovider's experiences, as well.\n\n91\n00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.028\nSo the service desk is\na value proposition.\n\n92\n00:05:03.028 --> 00:05:05.900\nIt may be overwrought now,\nI think most people get it.\n\n93\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.890\nBut keep in mind that ITIL\nhave been around long enough\n\n94\n00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.210\nthat they probably had to preach the value\nof service desk long ago, right.\n\n95\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.390\nSo, again, that's why we consider\nthe justification for it.\n\n96\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.200\nSo what is the service desk trying to do?\n\n97\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.820\nWe've talked about the processes,\nincident request fulfillment.\n\n98\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.660\nBeing on the front end of those two\nprocesses means the service desk has\n\n99\n00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.640\nthe same objectives as those processes.\n\n100\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.420\nConsider that the objective of\nincident management is to restore\n\n101\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.650\nservice as quickly as possible.\n\n102\n00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.020\nTrue, right.\n\n103\n00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.380\nAs a process incident\nmanagement is on point for\n\n104\n00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.720\nrestoring service as quickly as possible.\n\n105\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.020\nAs a practitioner of the incident\nmanagement process, these people at\n\n106\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.220\nthe service desk are also responsible for\nrestoring services as quickly as possible.\n\n107\n00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.410\nSame with requests.\n\n108\n00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.840\nRequest fulfillment,\n\n109\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.970\nmaking sure you have a methodical way to\nrespond to requests for standard services.\n\n110\n00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.250\nHere the service desk, making sure\nthat that is well done, efficiently,\n\n111\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.380\neffectively, completely logged, right.\n\n112\n00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.975\nSo you see the idea here.\n\n113\n00:06:09.975 --> 00:06:14.320\nAs a service desk, you are perhaps\nthe canary in the coal mine.\n\n114\n00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.935\nYou'll know first if there's problems\nin the infrastructure, potentially.\n\n115\n00:06:17.935 --> 00:06:22.040\nEvent management can kinda bolster that\nby giving you some back end indicators,\n\n116\n00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.990\nand monitoring certainly can, as well.\n\n117\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.850\nBut the service desk could actually\nbe your canary in a coal mine for\n\n118\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.071\nlots of user-based issues, okay.\n\n119\n00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:33.218\nAll right, how do you go about\nstaffing your service desk?\n\n120\n00:06:33.218 --> 00:06:35.158\nTough question.\n\n121\n00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:44.602\nThe ebb and flow of incidents\nis definitely variable, right.\n\n122\n00:06:44.602 --> 00:06:46.450\nIf you've just lost a brand new service,\n\n123\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.100\nyou can anticipate levels\nare going to be high.\n\n124\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.050\nIf you have a data center melt down,\nyou're gonna have a lot of incidence,\n\n125\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.590\nright, because you're affecting\nlots of different services.\n\n126\n00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.060\nSo making sure you have the correct\nnumber of staff to master the man levels\n\n127\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.420\nis a tough thing to do.\n\n128\n00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.720\nThere's certainly options out there.\n\n129\n00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.565\nThere's help desk institutes,\n\n130\n00:07:05.565 --> 00:07:08.940\nhere's all sort of things that help\nyou with some formulas for doing this.\n\n131\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.650\nITIL doesn't go into\nthe details of those at all.\n\n132\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.300\nMonitoring the performance\nof your service desk,\n\n133\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.870\nby monitoring the performance\nof request fulfillment and\n\n134\n00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.237\nincident management, can help with\nthe staffing levels, for sure, right.\n\n135\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.820\nFactors for consideration is\nthe capacity of your phone systems,\n\n136\n00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.560\nthe capacity of your business,\nhow many users you have.\n\n137\n00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.840\nWhat's the geographic spread, right?\n\n138\n00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.750\nHow often do you reintroduce services or\nbring new services into the environment?\n\n139\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.820\nThose types of things.\n\n140\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.610\nSo this is not a best practice of\nhow to manage staffing levels.\n\n141\n00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.910\nBut, certainly,\nit's a challenge you face in terms of\n\n142\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.930\nhaving the right number of people in\nthe right place at the right time, okay.\n\n143\n00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.740\nSo to give you an idea here.\n\n144\n00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.815\nWhat's your goals in an organization?\n\n145\n00:07:55.815 --> 00:08:00.530\nDo you have a goal where you want most of\nyour tickets resolved at the front end\n\n146\n00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.550\nby the first line by the service desk?\n\n147\n00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:07.010\nOr are they more of a call routing\nkind of service desk, right?\n\n148\n00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.420\nYou might be some point in between, right.\n\n149\n00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.835\nCertainly there could be a lot of value\ndriven by having highly skilled people in\n\n150\n00:08:13.835 --> 00:08:19.080\nfront of your users so\nyou can resolve those issues quickly.\n\n151\n00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.690\nBut if you have a very\ndiverse environment,\n\n152\n00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.470\nwith lots of specialized skills behind\nyou, then maybe the best way your service\n\n153\n00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.811\ndesk can serve the organization is\njust to do the appropriate routing,\n\n154\n00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:30.370\nright, to get it to the right\npeople at the right time.\n\n155\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.230\nSo depending on your general strategy for\nfulfillment, do you want it being resolved\n\n156\n00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.620\nat the first level, at the maximum level,\nthen you're going to staff accordingly.\n\n157\n00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.674\nIf it's more call routing, then perhaps\nyou even automate some of that, right.\n\n158\n00:08:43.674 --> 00:08:47.840\nI know I certainly have made those\ncalls where I get the call tree, right.\n\n159\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.550\nI get the call tree, and\nI get routed to a person that can help me.\n\n160\n00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.247\nIs it a billing issue, right?\n\n161\n00:08:52.247 --> 00:08:54.220\nI get routed to the billing department.\n\n162\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.840\nIs it a service issue?\n\n163\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.670\nOver that way, that sort of thing.\n\n164\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.550\nAnd I quickly want to find the zero\nto get me to an operator because\n\n165\n00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.710\nmy question is not either one of those.\n\n166\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.515\nI totally get that challenge,\nas well, right.\n\n167\n00:09:03.515 --> 00:09:04.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You get that idea.\n\n168\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.769\nI was on a call tree the other day.\n\n169\n00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:09.360\nIt had nine choices, and\nno option to say just give me an operator,\n\n170\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.900\ntell me which choice I'm supposed to use.\n\n171\n00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.950\nNone of the nine sounded\nlike what I needed.\n\n172\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.790\nSo if you want to set up\nsome sort of call tree or\n\n173\n00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.860\nrouting, you gotta make sure it's\nintuitive and effective, right.\n\n174\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.640\nSo to mention a negative example is also\nto mention some of the challenges of\n\n175\n00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.320\nmanaging a service desk and\nservice provision effectively.\n\n176\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.450\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, some of those automated\ncall trees definitely seem like their job\n\n177\n00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.180\nis to get you to no one effectively.\n\n178\n00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.762\nMaybe if we just route this guy\nthrough 20 different spots,\n\n179\n00:09:37.762 --> 00:09:38.719\nhe'll just give up and hang up.\n\n180\n00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:40.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.\n\n181\n00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:42.006\nHey, we didn't have any\nproblems this week.\n\n182\n00:09:42.006 --> 00:09:44.690\n&gt;&gt; It does seem to have that effect,\nit really does.\n\n183\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.750\nI think that's really interesting\nif you keep that going or\n\n184\n00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.340\nkeep that thought going.\n\n185\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.330\nIf you have nine choices\nin a call tree and try\n\n186\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.590\nto get the right routing, and you have\na number of people that always press zero,\n\n187\n00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.150\nthen your call tree's not\nreally helping too much.\n\n188\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.910\nSo you need to figure that out,\nfigure out what that balance is.\n\n189\n00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.975\nAnd if you don't give them\nthat zero option, my gosh,\n\n190\n00:10:04.975 --> 00:10:06.880\nyou're really just gonna\nhave screaming users.\n\n191\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.620\nThey don't call anymore.\n\n192\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.170\nSo that's the interesting\nthing about these metrics.\n\n193\n00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.450\nJust because you have a reduction\nin metrics, or reduction in things,\n\n194\n00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.950\ndoes that mean you're getting better?\n\n195\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.790\nWe'll have a look at that\na little bit later on.\n\n196\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.420\nBut certainly measuring\nservice desk capabilities, or\n\n197\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.110\nmeasuring their performance,\nis somewhat of a subset\n\n198\n00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.380\nfrom measuring just simply raw, incident\ndata and raw, request fulfillment data.\n\n199\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.880\nYou need to have some finesse on\nthat measurement piece, right.\n\n200\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.390\nSo considering measurement, good segue to\nthat, what are you trying to measure for\n\n201\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.150\nthe service desk?\n\n202\n00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.380\nThe health and maturity of\nthe process is underneath them.\n\n203\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.070\nThe health and maturity of\nthe service desk at large, right.\n\n204\n00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:53.190\nIf you had a service\ndesk that's primary aim\n\n205\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:58.470\nis to route appropriately, and\nnot try to solve anything, then probably\n\n206\n00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.420\nyour measurements are gonna be related\non did you route it correctly, right?\n\n207\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.508\nPretty simple.\n\n208\n00:11:03.508 --> 00:11:06.770\nHowever, if you've pushed out to\nthe service desk the responsibility\n\n209\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.770\nto resolve a lot of your incidents,\n\n210\n00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.492\nthen incident resolution time\nmight be part of it, right.\n\n211\n00:11:11.492 --> 00:11:15.800\nAnd then you wanna monitor the number\nof tickets that had to be sent back\n\n212\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.170\nto second and third level support,\nto get that kind of nuance, right.\n\n213\n00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.590\nSo you're talking about\nfirst line resolution or\n\n214\n00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.900\nthe average time to resolve incidents,\nthese are measurable, right.\n\n215\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.700\nAnd you're not just\nmeasuring the processes.\n\n216\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.225\nYou're measuring the process as executed\nby the service desk, of course.\n\n217\n00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:33.364\nSo a little bit of nuance there.\n\n218\n00:11:33.364 --> 00:11:38.138\nSo it's good to have this idea that\nmetrics may not equal the reality\n\n219\n00:11:38.138 --> 00:11:39.765\nthat you perceive.\n\n220\n00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:41.580\nLook at this first example on the left.\n\n221\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.685\nYou had a decrease in\nincidents of 25% last month.\n\n222\n00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:49.174\nSo is the assumption that you have\nbetter service desk performance\n\n223\n00:11:49.174 --> 00:11:52.550\nbecause there's not as many incidents,\nright?\n\n224\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.404\nWell, you have that assumption.\n\n225\n00:11:55.404 --> 00:11:58.716\nBut last month 200 staff moved to a\ndifferent company as part of a merger, and\n\n226\n00:11:58.716 --> 00:12:01.120\ntheir calls are no longer\nreceived at our service desk.\n\n227\n00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.870\nSo you had a reduction in staff,\npeople aren't calling anymore, right.\n\n228\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.899\nOr maybe the reason why it was such\na big drop is that last month was\n\n229\n00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:14.781\nthe first month after six months of\nescalating incident volumes, right.\n\n230\n00:12:14.781 --> 00:12:16.540\nYou can't take these in a vacuum.\n\n231\n00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.460\nFor instance, another one,\nincident resolution time.\n\n232\n00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.490\nSo not just the volume, but\nnow we got incident resolution time.\n\n233\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.710\nImproved 10% last quarter.\n\n234\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.890\nSo that means you're resolving\nthem quicker, right?\n\n235\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.250\nSo your assumption is the service\ndesk is performing better.\n\n236\n00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.899\nHowever, over that same quarter,\nincident reactivations went up 70%.\n\n237\n00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.204\nThat came from my direct experience is\nthat we certainly changed behaviors at\n\n238\n00:12:42.204 --> 00:12:43.290\nthe service desk.\n\n239\n00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.830\nWe're gonna focus on resolution time.\n\n240\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.088\nMake sure you get these things solved,\nright,\n\n241\n00:12:47.088 --> 00:12:49.130\ndon't let them linger more than two days.\n\n242\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.280\nGet them done, right.\n\n243\n00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.790\nSo people we're getting them done,\nthey were closing them down.\n\n244\n00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.910\nSo our metrics are looking really good.\n\n245\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.350\nBut we had a 70% increase in how\nmany of those we had to reopen\n\n246\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.840\nbecause they weren't really solved.\n\n247\n00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.185\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nthey just got the fire put out enough.\n\n248\n00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:03.905\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; To where the user was happy for\n\n249\n00:13:03.905 --> 00:13:04.500\nthe moment.\n\n250\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.480\nAnd then as a soon as a wind came by,\nit fanned the flame and it came back.\n\n251\n00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.708\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly right, good example.\n\n252\n00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:14.361\nSo, again, you need to have some metrics\nthat are in some balance, perhaps in some\n\n253\n00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:17.611\ntension, with each other to make\nsure you're accurately getting them.\n\n254\n00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:20.430\nAnd also measurement over time.\n\n255\n00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.610\nTo say one month improvement or\none quarter improvement,\n\n256\n00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.250\nyou might need to have a broader time\nhorizon for some of these performance\n\n257\n00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.530\nmetrics to really gauge\nthe health of your service desk.\n\n258\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.858\nA popular topic in the marketplace,\n\n259\n00:13:33.858 --> 00:13:39.160\nthat does happen pretty frequently,\nis the outsourcing of the service desk.\n\n260\n00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.770\nWith the belief that outsourcing the\nservice desk for some generic activities\n\n261\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:48.230\ncan be done by folks that don't cost\nas much and you can get more scale.\n\n262\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.250\nThe combination of lower cost\ncan give you more scale, and\n\n263\n00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:54.580\nyou can kinda accordion with that.\n\n264\n00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.153\nSo some service providers,\nthat's what their business is,\n\n265\n00:13:57.153 --> 00:13:58.495\nwe'll give you a service desk.\n\n266\n00:13:58.495 --> 00:14:02.962\nAnd they sell a service desk to an\norganization that outsources that service\n\n267\n00:14:02.962 --> 00:14:05.060\ndesk to the third party.\n\n268\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.320\nNot a bad idea.\n\n269\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.560\nITIL certainly recognizes that it can be\nan effective approach to cost savings and\n\n270\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.610\nscale.\n\n271\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.090\nAt the same time,\nyou gotta maintain accountability.\n\n272\n00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.730\nEven though you've outsourced it, it's\nstill your service that they are serving.\n\n273\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.280\nSo you gotta make sure that you have\naccountability built in, and those levels\n\n274\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.280\nof interface are opened, and those means\nof interface are effective, right.\n\n275\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.450\nYou still wanna keep score, you wanna\nmeasure your targets, you want to\n\n276\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.110\nmeasure the success, you want to drive\nimprovements and keep it that way.\n\n277\n00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.600\nI've certainly worked at organizations\nthat had a high proponent of outsource\n\n278\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.520\nservice desk technicians, where the vast\nmajority of them didn't work for\n\n279\n00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.230\nour company, right.\n\n280\n00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.810\nAnd it worked.\n\n281\n00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.140\nIt was very effective,\nand we got the cost and\n\n282\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.303\nwe got the scale that we were looking for,\nright.\n\n283\n00:14:52.303 --> 00:14:57.160\nBut we didn't get there until we also\nbuilt the good interfaces between\n\n284\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.660\nthat third party and us,\nin terms of performance expectations.\n\n285\n00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.290\nPenalties and rewards,\nsynergies across the interfaces, etc.\n\n286\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.810\nHow do you manage the feedback\nfrom third tier and\n\n287\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.800\nsecond tier support\nback to the front desk?\n\n288\n00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.780\nBefore, it was a bit more informal, so\nour knowledge base needed to grow up and\n\n289\n00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.000\nbe more mature.\n\n290\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.560\nOur second and third tier support\nhad to be more forthright with\n\n291\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.740\npassing on information to the front desk.\n\n292\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.360\nWhere it used to,\n\n293\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.230\nit was just a phone call back to Johnny,\nwho you knew they'd answer.\n\n294\n00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.790\nThe service desk said thanks,\nJohnny, I got it, right.\n\n295\n00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:31.082\nThat became unsustainable in a scale way.\n\n296\n00:15:31.082 --> 00:15:35.011\nWith a third party provider, we had to\nprovide more knowledge articles and write\n\n297\n00:15:35.011 --> 00:15:38.941\nthese things down because we don't wanna\nbe bothering Johnny with such things,\n\n298\n00:15:38.941 --> 00:15:40.030\nright, etc.\n\n299\n00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:44.150\nSo, again, to recap, the service desk\nis a vitally important function.\n\n300\n00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.160\nITIL certainly envisions it\nas a single point of contact.\n\n301\n00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.820\nThey have a strong predisposition for\n\n302\n00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.265\nthe service desk being\na single point of contact.\n\n303\n00:15:52.265 --> 00:15:55.630\nNow, that doesn't mean that you couldn't\nhave scenarios where you do have\n\n304\n00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.510\ndistribute the load, right.\n\n305\n00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.622\nBut they want the idea that\nthere's a single place to call.\n\n306\n00:16:00.622 --> 00:16:05.442\nEven if you have geographically separated\npeople, that there's one place to call for\n\n307\n00:16:05.442 --> 00:16:09.206\nthe users, one web interface, or\nthe combination of a phone call or\n\n308\n00:16:09.206 --> 00:16:10.500\na web interface.\n\n309\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.570\nThey know they're calling\nthe service desk.\n\n310\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.010\nAnd it might land in Amsterdam,\nit might land in Philadelphia eventually.\n\n311\n00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:21.160\nWherever it might land, it's still\na single call for those users, right.\n\n312\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.800\nSo as you consider this on the exam,\n\n313\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.960\nyou're gonna consider things\nlike what's the cost?\n\n314\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.920\nIs there a valuable reason to outsource\nthis for cost savings and scale?\n\n315\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.566\nWhat if you are merging\nseven companies and\n\n316\n00:16:34.566 --> 00:16:37.516\nthey each have their own service desk,\nright?\n\n317\n00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:40.611\nITIL would certainly have\na strong predisposition for\n\n318\n00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:43.105\nlet's make that one service desk, right.\n\n319\n00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:46.300\nThis one was good, this wasn't so\ngood, that one was really great.\n\n320\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.360\nMaybe you adopt that methodology and\n\n321\n00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.900\nthose processes while\nuplifting the rest of them.\n\n322\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.220\nThat's the kind of approach you wanna look\nat when you talk about an enterprise level\n\n323\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.960\nservice desk is how you build synergies,\nhow you build quality.\n\n324\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.190\nAnd there's measurable quality and\ncontinual improvement.\n\n325\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.580\nThat concludes it for\nservice desk, I'm gonna hope, yep.\n\n326\n00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.760\n&gt;&gt; For someone who has actually\nworked at a service desk, and\n\n327\n00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.680\nhas worked with service desks\nas I've advanced in my career,\n\n328\n00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.454\nI can tell you everything this\nman just said is 100% correct.\n\n329\n00:17:15.454 --> 00:17:17.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I've seen service desks that\n\n330\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.380\nare horrible.\n\n331\n00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.870\nAnd the reasons they're horrible is\nbecause they don't follow the procedures,\n\n332\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.980\nand the policies and\nthe ideas that Terry was giving us today.\n\n333\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.860\nThey could have used\na healthy dose of that, and\n\n334\n00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.210\nthings would have been\na whole lot smoother.\n\n335\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.400\nAnd I'm sure you out there have\ndealt with a service desk before,\n\n336\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.030\nat least in some capacity, and you can\n\n337\n00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.105\nreally in a pragmatic way understand\nhow these things work out in reality.\n\n338\n00:17:38.105 --> 00:17:40.255\nSo, Terry, great job for us today.\n\n339\n00:17:40.255 --> 00:17:44.785\nWe thank you for explaining service\ndesks in the ITIL fashion for us.\n\n340\n00:17:44.785 --> 00:17:46.925\nBut it does look like we've come\nto that portion of our show,\n\n341\n00:17:46.925 --> 00:17:48.825\nthat is the signing off portion.\n\n342\n00:17:48.825 --> 00:17:51.065\nSo that being said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n343\n00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:53.575\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n344\n00:17:53.575 --> 00:17:54.325\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n345\n00:17:54.325 --> 00:17:55.430\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n346\n00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:02.958\n[MUSIC]\n\n347\n00:18:02.958 -->

--> 00:00:08.749\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.100\nAnd welcome to another\namazing episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.410\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.612\nAnd in today's episode, well,\nif you're here for plumbing,\n\n8\n00:00:21.612 --> 00:00:24.532\nyou've come to the wrong place\ncuz we're doing ITIL OSA.\n\n9\n00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:28.350\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio,\nis the master plumber, himself.\n\n10\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.350\nThat is Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.280\nTerry, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.198\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.198\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.920\nAgain, we've gone through\nlots of good things so far.\n\n15\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500\nWe've gone through five functions.\n\n16\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.820\nIncident management, problem management,\nevent management, access management, and\n\n17\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.980\nrequest fulfillment.\n\n18\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.690\nWe've tackled one of the functions\nof the four called the service desk.\n\n19\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.420\nAnd this episode is about\nthe three other functions.\n\n20\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.890\nNot that they are perfunctory or\nnot to be concerned.\n\n21\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.470\nThey have a lot of meat to them.\n\n22\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.650\nBut they also can be condensed into\nsome pretty crisp learning objects.\n\n23\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.360\nAnd that's why they are all in one module.\n\n24\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.600\nService desk is vitally important.\n\n25\n00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.700\nSingle point of contact, lots of\npoints of interface with the users.\n\n26\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.510\nThese other functions,\nnot necessarily that way, right?\n\n27\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.980\nThey're not in front\nof users all the time.\n\n28\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.970\nThey're more in the back.\n\n29\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.176\nSo let's have a look at these.\n\n30\n00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:13.470\nGood graphic here that\nkinda puts it in context.\n\n31\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.410\nHere you see in the upper left hand\ncorner you see the service desk itself.\n\n32\n00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.480\nThat's one of the functions.\n\n33\n00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.270\nAnd then the other three\nare identified here,\n\n34\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.260\ntechnical management, IT operations\nmanagement and application management.\n\n35\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.042\nWe're gonna go in the order.\n\n36\n00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:28.692\nWe're gonna talk about technical\nmanagement application management\n\n37\n00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:29.756\nvirtually at the same time.\n\n38\n00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.200\nThey have much in common.\n\n39\n00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.900\nAnd then we'll go into operations\nmanagement and look at those.\n\n40\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.450\nYou'll see that IT operations\nmanagement is also broken down into\n\n41\n00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.900\ntwo sub functions, IT operations\ncontrol and facilities management.\n\n42\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.900\nSo, in effect, when we call it the other\nthree, we probably should call it\n\n43\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.530\nthe other five because we're gonna talk\nabout technical IT operations management,\n\n44\n00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.400\napplication management.\n\n45\n00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.430\nWe're also talk about these\ntwo sub functions as well.\n\n46\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.140\nSo let's get started,\n\n47\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.250\nlet's first start off with technical\nmanagement and application management.\n\n48\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.030\nNow a lot of words on here, but\nit's very instructive here.\n\n49\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.200\nThese two functions have so\nmuch in common,\n\n50\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.320\nand remember a function is a group of\npeople with special skills and tools.\n\n51\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.550\nSo these have so much in common that\nyou kinda learn them at the same time.\n\n52\n00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.920\nLet's first distinguish what\nthey have that's not in common.\n\n53\n00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.495\nOne is on the infrastructure side,\nthe other one is applications.\n\n54\n00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:22.370\nGonna go back just one slide,\nto remind you that is.\n\n55\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.100\nYou see that technical management here has\nmainframe, server, network, other things.\n\n56\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.679\nThose are the backend services,\nif you will,\n\n57\n00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.360\nthe backend infrastructure components.\n\n58\n00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.810\nThis is not an exhaustive list.\n\n59\n00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.200\nYou might have a special box just for\ncloud computing,\n\n60\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.380\nor web services, or\nyou might throw in Unix.\n\n61\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.538\nYou might divide servers into Unix\nservers versus Windows servers.\n\n62\n00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.450\nYou could go that level\ndetail if you want.\n\n63\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.530\nThis is, again,\nnot necessarily exhaustive.\n\n64\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.150\nAnd if you look on\nthe application management,\n\n65\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.710\nthis picture graphic,\ncertainly not exhaustive.\n\n66\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.320\nThey've got this big category\ncalled business apps.\n\n67\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.200\nThat can be just about anything, right?\n\n68\n00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.450\nHR, finance and whatever\nthe business is trying to do, right?\n\n69\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.075\nSo application management, as you might\nguess, is the front end of things.\n\n70\n00:03:05.075 --> 00:03:07.650\nIt's what's directly consumed by users.\n\n71\n00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.990\nThat's what they touch and feel.\n\n72\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.100\nThese often have brand names, right?\n\n73\n00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.210\nOr some sort of name that people go to.\n\n74\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.250\nFor instance, our learning management\nsystem was called My Learning, right?\n\n75\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.390\nSo let's go to the My Learning Suite,\nor the My Learning Tool.\n\n76\n00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.960\nPeople identify that.\n\n77\n00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.720\nOf course, under My Learning there were\nservers, networks, identity management.\n\n78\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.310\nThose types of backend\ntechnical management\n\n79\n00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.422\nissues in the infrastructure itself.\n\n80\n00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:35.610\nSo backend infrastructure is in\nthe technical management side,\n\n81\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.620\nfront end directly consumed by the users\nis on the application management side.\n\n82\n00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.130\nSo that's how they differ.\n\n83\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.740\nLet's remind ourselves, though,\nwhat they have in common.\n\n84\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.820\nI'm just interchanging\nthe word infrastructure and\n\n85\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.870\napplications through these definitions.\n\n86\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.090\nBasically learning the same things for\nboth functions at the same time.\n\n87\n00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.020\nFor instance, the role of technical\nmanagement is the custodian of\n\n88\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.910\ntechnical knowledge and expertise\nrelated to managing infrastructure.\n\n89\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.470\nI'll just repeat that same one, and\nthen I'll stop with the repetition.\n\n90\n00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.620\nApplication management is the custodian\nof application knowledge and\n\n91\n00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.200\nexpertise related to managing\napplications, right?\n\n92\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.130\nAnd as you see these definitions play out,\nand\n\n93\n00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.460\nthese are also in your exercise guides and\nstuff.\n\n94\n00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.870\nAnd it's worthy of getting up with\nthe language here a little bit.\n\n95\n00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.800\nBut in a nutshell what this means\nis the people that participate\n\n96\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.560\nin the technical management function\ncan show up at a strategy meeting.\n\n97\n00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.710\nThey're gonna help drive strategy for the\ntechnical infrastructure pieces, right?\n\n98\n00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.860\nThey're going to help advise on the best\nway to cost effectively deliver\n\n99\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.100\nweb services, or cloud services, or\ndatabase or storage services, right?\n\n100\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.100\nThey understand all the deep details that\ngo into providing effective services,\n\n101\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.626\nin the infrastructure.\n\n102\n00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:54.450\nOn the other side of the coin,\napplication management.\n\n103\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.170\nThey can show up at strategy meetings and\ndesign meetings\n\n104\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.470\nto know here's what the applications\nare on the landscape right now.\n\n105\n00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.098\nWhether or not it's advisable for\nus to build the application ourself and\n\n106\n00:05:04.098 --> 00:05:06.087\nhave all the customizations we need, or\n\n107\n00:05:06.087 --> 00:05:08.793\nshould we just buy this\ngeneric product off the shelf.\n\n108\n00:05:08.793 --> 00:05:11.590\nDoes that satisfy our business, right?\n\n109\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.300\nSo understanding business needs is in\nplay for both of these functions, but\n\n110\n00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.170\nalso understanding what drives\nthe risk benefit analysis and\n\n111\n00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.100\nthe cost benefit analysis within\ntheir areas of specialty.\n\n112\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.139\nIt just so happens that technical\nmanagement goes into the deep and\n\n113\n00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.720\nwide aspects of infrastructure.\n\n114\n00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.190\nApplication goes into the deep and\nwide aspects of applications.\n\n115\n00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.480\nThat's what they have in common.\n\n116\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.880\nThey just have different realms or\n\n117\n00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.410\ndomains of knowledge that\nthey're attending to, all right?\n\n118\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.750\nSo as we go and\nlook on these subsequent pages then,\n\n119\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.755\nwhat you're really looking at is\nan expansion of these same definitions.\n\n120\n00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:47.800\nHere's technical management, expertise and\ntotal management of infrastructure, right?\n\n121\n00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.100\nIf I fast forward that,\nit's gonna say expertise and\n\n122\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.280\ntotal management of applications, right?\n\n123\n00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.010\nYou see how this plays out.\n\n124\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.440\nNow the way this plays out on the exam is\nyou're gonna be looking about fortifying\n\n125\n00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.750\nyour functions to satisfy business needs.\n\n126\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.450\nSo maybe the scenario will point to\nweaknesses in application management.\n\n127\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.210\nMaybe you don't identify applications\nas something to be managed.\n\n128\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.670\nYou let the users manage\nthe applications instead of having this\n\n129\n00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.480\ndiscipline yourself.\n\n130\n00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.330\nOr you let the business decide how they're\ngonna get their applications instead of\n\n131\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.300\nhaving a function that can advise the\nbusiness on the cost benefit analysis or\n\n132\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.340\nthe risk benefit analysis\nof a given choices.\n\n133\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.440\nSo, again,\nthe slides are one thing in this case.\n\n134\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.990\nThe overarching theme of technical and\napplication management\n\n135\n00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.720\nis that they both go deep and\nwide into their areas of specialty.\n\n136\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.590\nThat means something a bit\nkind of cross-eyed perhaps,\n\n137\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.600\nis that we've been talking about\noperation support and analysis.\n\n138\n00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.810\nWe've been talking about\nservice operation and yet\n\n139\n00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.360\nwe just described two functions,\ntechnical management and\n\n140\n00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.160\napplication management, that by definition\nare going to set down in service strategy.\n\n141\n00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.530\nThey're going to be sitting down\nat the table at service design.\n\n142\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.840\nThey're gonna be involved\nin transition activities.\n\n143\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.200\nThey might be process owners.\n\n144\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.620\nThey might be service level managers.\n\n145\n00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.315\nThey might be availability managers.\n\n146\n00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:11.460\nThey go deep and wide in their specialty.\n\n147\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.180\nThat means they could get involved\nin activities that aren't\n\n148\n00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.610\nnecessarily related to\nthe day-to-day grind of IT.\n\n149\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.460\nThey're somehow providing\nstrategic value or\n\n150\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.825\ndesign value or\ntransition value as they go along.\n\n151\n00:07:21.825 --> 00:07:26.350\nSo even though we're talking about\nprocesses defined in a book called service\n\n152\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.050\noperations, please don't limit\nthe scope of technical management and\n\n153\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:36.610\napplication management just to\nthe operation of day-to-day services.\n\n154\n00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.580\nAll right, moving forward then to\ntalk about IT operations management.\n\n155\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.558\nJust fast forwarding through these,\nwe've talked about these various things.\n\n156\n00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:47.260\nHere we are with application management.\n\n157\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.070\nAgain, I could just take out\nthe word infrastructure and\n\n158\n00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.110\nput in the word application.\n\n159\n00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.980\nTechnical knowledge and\n\n160\n00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.890\nexpertise relating to managing\napplications instead of infrastructure.\n\n161\n00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.930\nAgain, just reinforcing\nthis same scheme here.\n\n162\n00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.170\nThey show up at design meetings,\nthey show up at strategy meetings, and\n\n163\n00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.600\nthey show up in transition meetings.\n\n164\n00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.590\nIt could be the expert for all things\nrelated to the business application.\n\n165\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.246\nLike perhaps you might have a business\nintelligence expert that understands all\n\n166\n00:08:14.246 --> 00:08:16.406\nthere is to know about\nbusiness intelligence.\n\n167\n00:08:16.406 --> 00:08:20.164\nA customer relations management expert\nthat knows all the landscape across all\n\n168\n00:08:20.164 --> 00:08:22.980\nthe marketplaces for\ncustomer relationship management.\n\n169\n00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.700\nPick your application business\napplication, you might identify an expert\n\n170\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.290\nwithin your application management\nfunction that focuses on that.\n\n171\n00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.840\nMaybe a given person has multiple hats.\n\n172\n00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.340\nCertainly could play that out as\nwell where a given person could be\n\n173\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.740\nwise on many things in\nthe application space, all right.\n\n174\n00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.210\nSo that really just leaves\nus with one other function\n\n175\n00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.620\nwhich happens to have two sub-functions.\n\n176\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.764\nSo I'm gonna fast forward\nhere a little bit.\n\n177\n00:08:53.764 --> 00:08:55.270\nThe IT operations management.\n\n178\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.270\nIT operations management, this is\nthe one that has two sub-functions.\n\n179\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.581\nOne's called operations control,\none's called facilities management,\n\n180\n00:09:03.581 --> 00:09:04.370\nlisted here on the slide.\n\n181\n00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:09.480\nAnd we'll talk about each of these bullets\nin some detail here, but in a nutshell,\n\n182\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.010\nwhat operations management does is\nmanage the day-to-day grind of IT.\n\n183\n00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:19.384\nYou need to schedule jobs, backups and\nrestores, data migrations,\n\n184\n00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:24.761\nserver patching, network maintenance,\ndata center maintenance,\n\n185\n00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:29.499\nkeeping the generators full,\nmanaging the wiring closets,\n\n186\n00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:33.350\nswapping out disk storage,\nadding disk arrays.\n\n187\n00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.620\nJust managing the day-to-day grind.\n\n188\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:40.680\nTaking care of the printers, replacing\nprinter cartridges, toner cartridges, etc.\n\n189\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.650\nSo IT operations management,\nthe day-to-day grind.\n\n190\n00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.130\nIT operations control,\nif you look back at the chart there,\n\n191\n00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.560\nIT operations control is\nmanaging the console.\n\n192\n00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.390\nSometimes called a bridge,\nas in Captain Kirk's at the bridge.\n\n193\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:01.382\nYou go to a captain's bridge on a ship, or\ntake Captain Kirk on Star Trek Enterprise,\n\n194\n00:10:01.382 --> 00:10:06.144\nhe has at his disposal at the bridge\nquick means of communications.\n\n195\n00:10:06.144 --> 00:10:09.720\nHe's got health indicators for\nall the systems on the ship, right?\n\n196\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.960\nHe can certainly talk to Scotty\ndown in the engine room, right?\n\n197\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.480\nHe can have access to the people he needs,\nbut\n\n198\n00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.960\nhe has a central, physical location\nwhere he can see the health of his ship.\n\n199\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.232\nHe can navigate it from there, etc.\n\n200\n00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:25.860\nSometimes called an operations bridge,\n\n201\n00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.650\nperhaps that's a more British\nterm where ITIL comes from.\n\n202\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.854\nWe might refer to them as\ncontrol centers or NOCs,\n\n203\n00:10:31.854 --> 00:10:34.918\nNetwork Operating Center, command centers.\n\n204\n00:10:34.918 --> 00:10:38.141\nWe have different names for\nthese, but what IT operations\n\n205\n00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:42.570\ncontrol is trying to maintain is\nthe day-to-day health of the organization.\n\n206\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.440\nSo there might be a bridge, right?\n\n207\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.580\nAnd in doing so, they're tasking out jobs,\nthey're backing up and restore,\n\n208\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.880\nprint maintenance and stuff.\n\n209\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.950\nWhereas facilities management\nIs focused on the day-to-day\n\n210\n00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.800\ngrind of just maintaining physical assets.\n\n211\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.236\nKeeping the data center cool,\nkeeping it powered, right?\n\n212\n00:10:58.236 --> 00:11:01.860\nMaking sure you have\nrecovery sites ready to go.\n\n213\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.190\nBackups of physical assets.\n\n214\n00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.890\nWhere's your storage closet for\nspare servers?\n\n215\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.900\nThose kinds of things.\n\n216\n00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.490\nThe physical environment.\n\n217\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.870\nThe physical plant of IT\nneeds to be maintained.\n\n218\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.647\nITIL recognizes that as a separate\nmanagement function, right?\n\n219\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.880\nSo again, a function,\na group of people with special skills and\n\n220\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.050\ntools, facilities management\nmight be a bit different.\n\n221\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.670\nThose kind of folks, the people\nyou're looking for in that space\n\n222\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.878\nmight be a different kind of people than\nthe ones that are managing your backups,\n\n223\n00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:33.530\nrestores and\nmanaging server patching, etc, right?\n\n224\n00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.790\nNow, one other thing I wanna point out.\n\n225\n00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:41.220\nAny given person may be a member\nof more than one function, right?\n\n226\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.700\nIt's certainly possible that I could\nserve in the technical management role.\n\n227\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.415\nAnd therefore show up at strategy\nmeetings or design meetings, but\n\n228\n00:11:49.415 --> 00:11:51.642\nalso have responsibilities day to day.\n\n229\n00:11:51.642 --> 00:11:54.588\nMaybe I get down and\nget my hands dirty and patch servers and\n\n230\n00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:55.960\ndo those kind of things.\n\n231\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.600\nAnd I go to the strategic meetings.\n\n232\n00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.026\nSo this is not an organizational chart,\nthat's what I'm getting at.\n\n233\n00:12:02.026 --> 00:12:05.460\nYou don't belong necessarily\njust to one function,\n\n234\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.591\nand it's not necessarily how you\norganize your IT department.\n\n235\n00:12:09.591 --> 00:12:12.375\nIt's just these are the skills you need.\n\n236\n00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:15.225\nThese are the tool sets\nyou need to be successful\n\n237\n00:12:15.225 --> 00:12:18.065\nin delivering IT services\nin a day-to-day basis,\n\n238\n00:12:18.065 --> 00:12:22.545\nas well as serving the strategic design\nand transition needs of your organization.\n\n239\n00:12:22.545 --> 00:12:23.895\nSo that's it.\n\n240\n00:12:23.895 --> 00:12:28.045\nThere's these five processes and\nfour functions.\n\n241\n00:12:28.045 --> 00:12:31.210\nAmong the four functions\nwe got the service desk and\n\n242\n00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.510\nwe just talked about the other three.\n\n243\n00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.730\nTechnical management,\napplication management, going deep and\n\n244\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.158\nwide into the areas of specialty,\nand then IT operations management.\n\n245\n00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:44.730\nManaging the day-to-day grind,\nnot so deep, not so wide, but\n\n246\n00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.720\nstill vitally important.\n\n247\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.550\nSo as this plays out on the exam,\n\n248\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.460\nyou need to be considering things such as\nskill sets, maintaining training logs,\n\n249\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.090\nmaking sure everyone is trained\nproperly to form their function.\n\n250\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.820\nSo because these functions also need to\nmaintain the skill sets, training and\n\n251\n00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.610\ncommunication are a big\npart of its success.\n\n252\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.630\nSo as you take on the exam,\nyou're gonna be looking for\n\n253\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:12.242\nthose things that ensure the success of\nthese special people with special skills.\n\n254\n00:13:12.242 --> 00:13:15.570\nYou got to hire them correctly,\nyou got to maintain their skills sets.\n\n255\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:20.241\nSo, training plans, executions plans,\nprocedures and scripts, those\n\n256\n00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:25.218\ntypes of things are gonna be part and\nparcel to the way these functions succeed.\n\n257\n00:13:25.218 --> 00:13:27.936\nThat concludes it for all the functions.\n\n258\n00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:30.686\nWe did service desk and\nthe three, technical management,\n\n259\n00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:33.830\napplication management, and\nIT operations management.\n\n260\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.630\nFive processes,\nfour functions done and dusted.\n\n261\n00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.453\n&gt;&gt; Terry, if I have learned\nanything from this course so\n\n262\n00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:44.720\nfar it's that a lot of the managers that\nI've worked with really could have [LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.750\nmade use of this type of course.\n\n264\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.020\nAnd I'll be honest with you,\nif I was looking for\n\n265\n00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.300\nmanagers in IT or operations,\nthings like that.\n\n266\n00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.110\nSeen that ITIL certification or ITIL\ntraining, even, would go a long way in my\n\n267\n00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.720\nbook after viewing this content,\nseeing what you're teaching us.\n\n268\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.478\nBecause it is just a disaster\nout there with a lot of them.\n\n269\n00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:05.750\nI've seen that first hand,\n\n270\n00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.130\nyou've got people running around\ndoing all sorts of different jobs.\n\n271\n00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.368\nThey have no defined roles,\nthey don't know what their job is.\n\n272\n00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:14.318\nThey're just doing everything\nbecause someone told them to.\n\n273\n00:14:14.318 --> 00:14:18.399\nUsing this type of system and structure\nreally brings that to something that I\n\n274\n00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:22.840\nthink would be more easily managed and\nmore efficient, to be honest with you.\n\n275\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.712\n&gt;&gt; That's very good.\n\n276\n00:14:23.712 --> 00:14:26.550\nThe beauty of ITIL is it does provide\nthis structure, this framework.\n\n277\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.250\nIt intends not to be prescriptive, right?\n\n278\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.430\nIt's not telling you thou shalt do this.\n\n279\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.750\nIt just gives you the basic framework that\nsays these are the things you consider.\n\n280\n00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.030\nAnd it distills it down into\ndigestible bits, right?\n\n281\n00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:41.095\nHow you digest this and how you make it\ncome to life is gonna be largely up to\n\n282\n00:14:41.095 --> 00:14:47.050\nyou, the immediate needs you have by\nyour business and for your IT function.\n\n283\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's a good points, I'm glad to see.\n\n284\n00:14:48.835 --> 00:14:52.350\nOftentimes, you can see the value in\ncomparison to the lack of the value.\n\n285\n00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate you saying that.\n\n286\n00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.686\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, really no problem.\n\n287\n00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:55.340\n&gt;&gt; It's good to hear.\n\n288\n00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.680\n&gt;&gt; It's plain for anyone with two eyes\nto see would definitely see this.\n\n289\n00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.260\nTerry, thank you so much for dropping\nby today and showing us the way, right.\n\n290\n00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.610\nGiving us the right path on how we\ncould be running our operations.\n\n291\n00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:12.030\nAnd you as a person that wants to take the\nOSA exam, definitely dive into this stuff.\n\n292\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.330\nAssimilate it, it's not just\nthe stuff to rotely remember so\n\n293\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.510\nthat you can pass an exam.\n\n294\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.080\nThis will help you immensely\nto take these practices and\n\n295\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.570\nconcepts out into the field once you\nbecome a manager in some fashion.\n\n296\n00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.100\nSo that being said, it does look like\nit's that time for us to sign off again.\n\n297\n00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.300\nMan, it goes by so fast.\n\n298\n00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.410\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n299\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.020\nThanks to Terry for dropping by.\n\n300\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.286\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n301\n00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:34.800\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n302\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.490\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n303\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.764\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n304\n00:15:36.764 --> 00:15:44.208\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n305\n00:15:44.208

00:00:12.340\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.310\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.478\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:22.561\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe are continuing on, actually,\n\n8\n00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:25.610\nconcluding our ITIL OSA foundation series.\n\n9\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.550\nAnd joining us for\nour final episode is the man, the myth,\n\n10\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.160\nthe legend that has taken us down this\nroad, our good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.190\nTerry, welcome, how goes it today?\n\n12\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.050\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, I'm happy to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.280\nWe've been on a pretty long\njourney here with OSA.\n\n14\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.610\nWe've gone through four functions and\nfive processes.\n\n15\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.640\nAnd just to put a cherry on top,\nwe're gonna talk about the technology and\n\n16\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.060\nimplementation and the considerations\nyou have for those two topics.\n\n17\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.940\nAs part of the ITIL syllabus,\n\n18\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.130\nthey always mention a technology and\nimplementation considerations.\n\n19\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.720\nIt's not just enough to\nhave processes defined or\n\n20\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.610\nhow you go about implementing\nthese processes.\n\n21\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.690\nYou need to also have tool sets in place.\n\n22\n00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.180\nAnd along this journey of talking\nabout the processes and the functions,\n\n23\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.610\nwe've talked some about the tools.\n\n24\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.100\nSo some of what we're gonna talk\nabout today is gonna be review.\n\n25\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.150\nAs an example, if you look at the slide\nhere, so you may recognize a few of these.\n\n26\n00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.070\nCertainly, we've talked about self help.\n\n27\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.200\nWe talked about self help primarily in the\ncontext of request fulfillment, allowing\n\n28\n00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.000\nfor a user to find the services themselves\nwithout interface with the service desk.\n\n29\n00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.010\nCertainly streamline,\nmaybe make it faster for the end user and\n\n30\n00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.280\ncertainly not bother the help\ndesk with other things.\n\n31\n00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.890\nI need to start over.\n\n32\n00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.625\n&gt;&gt; I figured.\n\n33\n00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:46.656\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] You jinxed me, Tanisha.\n\n34\n00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:48.096\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; Put the whammy on you.\n\n35\n00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:54.622\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I just gotta maintain our\nfocus, I gotta keep Tanisha's attention,\n\n36\n00:01:54.622 --> 00:01:58.550\nor she's gonna pan over\nto Daniel any minute now.\n\n37\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.256\n&gt;&gt; Any minute now, I have to be exciting.\n\n38\n00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:05.535\n[LAUGH] Okay, straight face,\nI think we can do this.\n\n39\n00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:07.048\nAll right, Tanisha,\nI'm ready when you are.\n\n40\n00:02:07.048 --> 00:02:08.414\n&gt;&gt; Ready.\n\n41\n00:02:08.414 --> 00:02:13.918\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you may recall these from\nour discussion of the various processes,\n\n42\n00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:18.010\nparticularly, self help related\nto request fulfillment.\n\n43\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.330\nSelf help, meaning that you can\nput some sort of interface,\n\n44\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.520\nelectronic interface in\nfront of the end users.\n\n45\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.050\nSo they don't have to\ncall the service desk,\n\n46\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.930\nthat can not only streamline the process\non behalf of the end user, but also\n\n47\n00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.800\ncan keep the service desk unentangled with\nmanaging day to day requests for things.\n\n48\n00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.010\nSo if you need a new mouse or\nneed to install some software,\n\n49\n00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.450\nthose kinds of requests that might\nbe in place in your organization,\n\n50\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.700\nhaving some sort of self help tool in\nfront of those could be beneficial, right?\n\n51\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.550\nClosely related to that is workflow or\nprocess engines,\n\n52\n00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.390\nsomething that follows through.\n\n53\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.420\nIf you buy a tool set, for instance, for\nchange management, or incident management,\n\n54\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.190\nit would be good to be able to route\nthese to the appropriate people.\n\n55\n00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.920\nRoute the changes to the appropriate\npeople for evaluation, route the incidents\n\n56\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.950\nto the appropriate people for\nevaluation, and to be able to do so, so\n\n57\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.000\nthat it becomes obvious to the person you\nrouted it to that they need to work on it.\n\n58\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.310\nSo that kind of work flow,\n\n59\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.735\nmoving things through the process would\nbe good tool sets to have, right?\n\n60\n00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:22.090\nIntegration with the CMS, again,\nwe've talked about this along the way.\n\n61\n00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.580\nA configuration management system is that\nsystem that maintains awareness of all\n\n62\n00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.870\nthe assets in your environment, servers,\ndatabases, applications, services.\n\n63\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.310\nAnd by having the CMS integrated\nwith these processes,\n\n64\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.710\nyou can link the processes\nto their underlying assets.\n\n65\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.262\nSo integration with CMS is also a great\ntool to be able to make that happen,\n\n66\n00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:50.053\na great capability to have, right?\n\n67\n00:03:50.053 --> 00:03:52.883\nCertainly discovery/deployment/licensing\ntechnology,\n\n68\n00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:55.878\nif you're talking about distributing\nsoftware and operations.\n\n69\n00:03:55.878 --> 00:03:59.203\nSo fulfilling the requests for software,\nto be able to understand is it already\n\n70\n00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:02.379\ninstalled on there, maybe someone\nrequest software they already have, so\n\n71\n00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.088\nyou don't wanna install it again,\nright, that sort of thing.\n\n72\n00:04:05.088 --> 00:04:07.640\nThis also can be very sophisticated, but\n\n73\n00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.580\nmanaging your software state\nthrough discovery, deployment, and\n\n74\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.820\nlicensing could certainly help service\noperations streamline, all right.\n\n75\n00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.630\nRemote control, taking control of\nan end user's desktop for instance or\n\n76\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.200\ntheir laptop while you're\ntroubleshooting an issue.\n\n77\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.550\nOr they said they can't\nprint to printer A, so\n\n78\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.917\nyou want to install\nprinter B on their behalf.\n\n79\n00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:29.821\nTake control of their desktop and start\nright quick, make it to default printer.\n\n80\n00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:33.166\nDone and dusted, they didn't have to\nknow all that, you helped them out.\n\n81\n00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:36.043\nAnd maybe use that opportunity\nto teach them along the way, so\n\n82\n00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:37.770\nthey can help themselves next time.\n\n83\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.730\nSo as you, again, and\nwe've talked about this,\n\n84\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.609\nwe've talked about dashboards for\ninstance.\n\n85\n00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:45.049\nThe bill will have the appropriate\ninstrumentation, and\n\n86\n00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:49.331\ndashboard is one of those instrumentation\ndeliverables that allows you\n\n87\n00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:53.990\nto see the current health of what's\ngoing on in your environment, all right.\n\n88\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.360\nCertainly, we'd be able to\nintegrate with business management.\n\n89\n00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.140\nIf you can somehow connect the dots\nbetween what you're doing in IT\n\n90\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.380\nto what the business is doing and having\na tool set for that, also a big help.\n\n91\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.780\nAnd of course, software's a service.\n\n92\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.910\nIt's perhaps an overused term.\n\n93\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.938\nCloud computing software is a service,\nbut certainly,\n\n94\n00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:21.030\ndelivering software as a service over\nyour network could also be a tool set or\n\n95\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.176\na technology that you embrace to\nstreamline operations and support, right?\n\n96\n00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.701\nAgain, none of these are prescriptive.\n\n97\n00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:30.579\nAs you take an exam, and\nyou're looking at these things,\n\n98\n00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:33.270\ncertainly need to recognize\nwhat these are, right?\n\n99\n00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.270\nAnd they may make suggestions.\n\n100\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.900\nLike perhaps the pain point is the service\ndesk is too busy working on servers'\n\n101\n00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.660\nrequests, that they can't get around\nto managing the incidents, right?\n\n102\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.370\nBecause the volume has gone so\nhigh, right?\n\n103\n00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.670\nSo maybe recognize self help\nas a way to streamline that.\n\n104\n00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.390\nThat's kind of the depth you need to wear,\n\n105\n00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.380\ncertainly not deep technology\ndrives into any of these topics.\n\n106\n00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.510\nBut understand that at a high\nlevel what these topics mean,\n\n107\n00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.190\nwhat these bullets represent, if you will,\nand recognize them in an exam\n\n108\n00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.996\nscenario is where the level of\nknowledge you need to have, okay.\n\n109\n00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:11.390\nYeah, considering,\nwe also talked about these,\n\n110\n00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.810\nI'm gonna run through each one of these.\n\n111\n00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.020\nBut we also talked about the idea of\ntechnology helping each of the processes\n\n112\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.252\nas we talked about them, including\nthe service desk as a function, right?\n\n113\n00:06:22.252 --> 00:06:26.520\nA lot of this is gonna be about making\nsure that you're taking advantage of what\n\n114\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.960\nthe process is supposed to be delivering.\n\n115\n00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.190\nSo as an example, event management,\nI'll give you an example there.\n\n116\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.060\nEvent management, it's one thing\nto have the operating system, for\n\n117\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.210\ninstance, automatically detect it,\nTerry Decker logged in today, right?\n\n118\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.890\nSure, so the operating system\nitself is able to do that.\n\n119\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.170\nYou just turn on that particular feature,\nthe operating system takes care of it for\n\n120\n00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.990\nyou, but\nthat's gonna be on each individual laptop.\n\n121\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.420\nWhat's that gonna do for you?\n\n122\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.570\nAs in terms of event management, having\na tool that can take that information.\n\n123\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.750\nWe talked about correlation engines,\nright?\n\n124\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.270\nWe talked about intrusion\ndetection systems.\n\n125\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.300\nObviously, that's tool sets\nin the event management space\n\n126\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.440\nthat are very sophisticated with\nvery specific deliverables and\n\n127\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.640\ngives you the instrumentation\nas well as the events.\n\n128\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.260\nSo, as an example then,\nyou could consider event\n\n129\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.950\nmanagement as one of those processes that\ncould benefit from tools or technology.\n\n130\n00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.590\nObviously, the other processes could too,\nall right?\n\n131\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.330\nAll right, so tools lead,\nbasically what you're trying to get out of\n\n132\n00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.740\nthis is increased productivity and\ncost savings.\n\n133\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.740\nPerhaps on the exam, you will get\nquestions regarding tool selection.\n\n134\n00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.914\nI wanna give you just a couple of\ncautionary tales as you take on these kind\n\n135\n00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.070\nof questions on the exam.\n\n136\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.974\nFirst of all, buying the big\nshiny object that does everything\n\n137\n00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:48.081\nis probably not the five answer,\nthe best answer.\n\n138\n00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:53.087\nAlthough IT folks love big shiny objects\nand big applications, those kind of\n\n139\n00:07:53.087 --> 00:07:58.554\nthings, it's probably not the five answer\nbecause ITIL has a previous position for\n\n140\n00:07:58.554 --> 00:08:02.347\ngradual improvement,\nwhile thinking about the future.\n\n141\n00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:05.665\nLet's not go big a big solution\n[INAUDIBLE] necessarily.\n\n142\n00:08:05.665 --> 00:08:11.250\nEspecially if you don't have significant\ndata to support this decision.\n\n143\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.730\nAnd by data I mean, have you fully\nvetted the business requirements?\n\n144\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.830\nHave you fully vetted the business\nvalue of what you're trying to do or\n\n145\n00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.820\nare you just guessing?\n\n146\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.430\nSo unless you can articulate\nthe business value fully,\n\n147\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.890\ngoing toward the big solution\nis probably not the answer.\n\n148\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.680\nOr, if the big solution is included in the\nanswer, it's gonna be preceded by the good\n\n149\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.780\ntopics of, you did business analysis,\nyou understand your requirements.\n\n150\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.020\nYou've vetted this with real metrics,\nthose sorts of things.\n\n151\n00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.890\n&gt;&gt; So this is kind of using\nthe right tool for the right job.\n\n152\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.080\nEven though there might be\na tool that's better and\n\n153\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.300\ndoes the same job,\nit just might be overkill?\n\n154\n00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, because introducing tools\nare going to be disruptive, so getting\n\n155\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.700\nthe biggest shiny one could be even\nbigger and shinier and more disruptive.\n\n156\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.940\nAs an example, maybe what you're trying\nto shore up is event management and\n\n157\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.300\ncertainly you want your event management\nperhaps to be able to integrate\n\n158\n00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.020\nwith the the other processes, such as\nincident management or problem management.\n\n159\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.550\nYou definitely want to connect those dots.\n\n160\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.480\nIf you already have a mature\nincident management process and\n\n161\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.560\na mature problem management process, and\n\n162\n00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.260\nthey are tightly integrated and\nit's working very well, introducing a new\n\n163\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.230\ntechnology that would replace what you\nalready have with something that just\n\n164\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.470\ngives you the incremental value of event\nmanagement, may not be the solution.\n\n165\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.370\nFor instance, you probably want\nthe solution that you can add\n\n166\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.960\nthe event management functionality to what\nalready exists and what's already working.\n\n167\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.690\nSo again, it can't be prescriptive.\n\n168\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.904\nBut the way is trying to present into\na best practice is that you don't want\n\n169\n00:09:43.904 --> 00:09:46.794\nto necessarily make change just for\nthe sake of change.\n\n170\n00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:51.665\nYou wanna have a methodical approach for\nunderstanding why it's a good decision,\n\n171\n00:09:51.665 --> 00:09:53.265\nthat sort of thing.\n\n172\n00:09:53.265 --> 00:09:55.915\nSo, obviously lots of buzzwords here.\n\n173\n00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:57.245\nHow much does it cost?\n\n174\n00:09:57.245 --> 00:09:58.575\nDo we use multi-vendors?\n\n175\n00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:01.545\nWhat's the usability like,\nsupport options out of the box?\n\n176\n00:10:01.545 --> 00:10:04.905\nDo we build it ourselves,\nhow much does it have to be customized?\n\n177\n00:10:04.905 --> 00:10:07.815\nA plethora of questions\nthat have to be asked.\n\n178\n00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:12.480\nAnd some general guideposts for\nhow to go about answering those questions\n\n179\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.210\nare really based on some pretty key,\nand easy to memorize, principles here.\n\n180\n00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.860\nThey call it the MoSCoW Principle.\n\n181\n00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.770\nYou may have seen this, if you're\ntaking other intermediate courses,\n\n182\n00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.840\nthe technology consideration often\nreflects this same principle.\n\n183\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.170\nMoSCoW, what does\nthe tool currently offer?\n\n184\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.140\nAnd is that something that you must have?\n\n185\n00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.140\nNow this is kinda a little bit backwards,\na little bit.\n\n186\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.570\nSome folks they just go to a sheet and\nthey list down all the requirements.\n\n187\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:48.042\nThis is you're looking at the particular\ntool set it says, does it have?\n\n188\n00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:49.346\nYou see what it has.\n\n189\n00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:54.039\nSo as your evaluating a tool set you\nwill see a particular feature it has and\n\n190\n00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:56.320\nsay yup, that's one we must have.\n\n191\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.080\nIf it's not there, we can't buy this tool.\n\n192\n00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.980\nYou've got to go after the must haves.\n\n193\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.540\nThe should haves, the could haves,\nthe won't haves are less important.\n\n194\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.150\nBut they have this idea of rating\neach of the feature sets and say,\n\n195\n00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.635\nthat's pretty nice,\nwe'd like to have that in the future.\n\n196\n00:11:14.635 --> 00:11:19.917\nIt's not needed now, but\nwe know we'll need this in the future.\n\n197\n00:11:19.917 --> 00:11:25.764\nThe rule of thumb is if the must haves\nare 100% covered, it's a viable tool.\n\n198\n00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:28.070\nBecause you've gone through\nthe trouble to say, you must have it.\n\n199\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.880\nThen you better have it.\n\n200\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.764\nOtherwise you're probably gonna have\nsome sort of compromise where you're\n\n201\n00:11:32.764 --> 00:11:33.927\nnot gonna get the perfect fit.\n\n202\n00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:37.113\nSo an 80% fit for\nthe requirements is a good fit.\n\n203\n00:11:41.105 --> 00:11:42.509\nLicensing techniques,\n\n204\n00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:46.262\nagain, this is a topic that doesn't\nplay out too much to an exams.\n\n205\n00:11:46.262 --> 00:11:49.479\nI think it's good to have this in your\nback pocket operational speaking when you\n\n206\n00:11:49.479 --> 00:11:50.700\ngo back to the office.\n\n207\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.510\nI think what I'd say\ngenerally about licenses is,\n\n208\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.770\nis that it's not ever this\nsimple in my own experience.\n\n209\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.769\nVendors, they package licensing in so\nmany different ways.\n\n210\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:09.010\nBuy 7 you get 3 free, and\nmake that 7,000 and get 300 free, or\n\n211\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.720\nif you couple it with a support agreement\nthe licenses won't even cost anything.\n\n212\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.420\nThere's so many different ways\nthat this is mixed around.\n\n213\n00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.880\nBut I will get some notice to this types\nof license generically speaking as\n\n214\n00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.880\nthey play out.\n\n215\n00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.670\nAnd again perhaps could help you\nback operationally rework your\n\n216\n00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.530\nlicensing strategy.\n\n217\n00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.930\nA dedicated license is, if you got\n300 users, you buy 300 licenses.\n\n218\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.020\nSimple as that.\n\n219\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.670\nAs supposed to a shared license,\n\n220\n00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.660\nlet's say in the same\nenvironment you have 300 users.\n\n221\n00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.780\nBut the 300 are spread\nacross 7 time zones,\n\n222\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.200\nthey'll never work at the same time.\n\n223\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.940\nOr, it's not a particular\napplication they'll use constantly.\n\n224\n00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.590\nSo you might decide to get\nshared licenses, such for\n\n225\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.890\nthese 300 users,\nmaybe you only buy 100 shared licenses.\n\n226\n00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.480\nBut the risk to that is is when that\n101st person tries to use the app\n\n227\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.740\nthey'll be denied because the licensing\nmonitoring is built in that way.\n\n228\n00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.050\nSo some risk benefit there is that you can\nsave some money because you're buying 100\n\n229\n00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.940\nlicenses instead of 300.\n\n230\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.370\nThe downside is that you\n\n231\n00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.350\ncould end up keeping somewhat away\nfrom the application unexpectedly.\n\n232\n00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.920\nAgain, different vendors, different\nsoftware publishers are managing these\n\n233\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.400\nlicenses in ways that kinda blur\nthe lines between shared and dedicated.\n\n234\n00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.320\nA web license is often considered,\n\n235\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.570\nyou get limited functionality,\nbut you get some functionality.\n\n236\n00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.590\nAnd they're also less expensive.\n\n237\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:43.220\nSo for some users, I've noticed this\nin the service management space.\n\n238\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.430\nWe wanted some people in the business to\nhave access to our change management tool\n\n239\n00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.010\nset, so he could come and do approvals.\n\n240\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.890\nBut they don't need to do\nreports on change records and\n\n241\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.810\nsee all the details behind it.\n\n242\n00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.110\nSo getting a web client for\n\n243\n00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.230\nthem was the effective way to go\nabout it because they got access to\n\n244\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.740\nthe little bit of functionality they\nneeded access to have access to.\n\n245\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.980\nAnd of course you have services on demand,\n\n246\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.780\nsoftware as a service cloud computing,\netc.\n\n247\n00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.900\nHow you go about deploying it,\nclient/agent software.\n\n248\n00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.920\nDo you do big bang versus phased,\n\n249\n00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.490\nyou see you have to learn\nabout how to introduce this.\n\n250\n00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.330\nGeographic versus functional.\n\n251\n00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.460\nThe timing of it.\n\n252\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.750\nThe capacity checks.\n\n253\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.435\nWhen you go out and deploy these,\ndo you wanna see that it works for\n\n254\n00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:32.060\n500 users before you give it to 2,000?\n\n255\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.040\nSo different deployment options here.\n\n256\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.340\nThe difference between big bang and phased\nis a risk management approach can be, big\n\n257\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.480\nbang, everyone's gonna get the pain at the\nsame time or the gain at the same time.\n\n258\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.380\nA phased approach lets you\n\n259\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.880\nnavigate through some of the risk of\ndeploying it all at once to everyone.\n\n260\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.760\nBut of course that strings out\nthe project for longer times, etc.\n\n261\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.950\nPretty straightforward there.\n\n262\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:00.850\nAgain, as it comes to a test, picking\nthe best is not the way to go about it.\n\n263\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.820\nWhat they're gonna say is\nhere's what we're doing.\n\n264\n00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.710\nSo you need to understand what's the risk\nand benefit of these particular deployment\n\n265\n00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.390\nintroduction styles and\nat least manage that through the question.\n\n266\n00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.820\n&gt;&gt; So the answers are gonna be\nbasically relative to the question?\n\n267\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.810\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, to the scenario itself,\nthat's right.\n\n268\n00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.630\nAnd the scenario will tell that out,\n\n269\n00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:28.060\nyou got 5,000 users in one geographic area\nthat are highly critical to the business.\n\n270\n00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.360\nBut you have 200 over in this other\ngeographic area that is a good replica,\n\n271\n00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.220\nthey do the same kind of things but\nit's not so critical to the business.\n\n272\n00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.670\nThen maybe a phased\napproach is really good.\n\n273\n00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.848\nYou pass it out to these 200 people first,\nwork out the kinks and\n\n274\n00:15:41.848 --> 00:15:45.740\nthen go to the big bang for\nthe rest of the 5,000 later on.\n\n275\n00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.883\nProject management.\n\n276\n00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:51.970\nThis came out in a discussion\nin one of the early episodes.\n\n277\n00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.426\nDaniel was pretty intuitive about this.\n\n278\n00:15:53.426 --> 00:15:57.429\nHow does project management and\nservice operations interact?\n\n279\n00:15:57.429 --> 00:16:00.925\nI think this comes through because\ncertainly from my own experience and\n\n280\n00:16:00.925 --> 00:16:03.438\nperhaps I'm carrying a bit\nof my own baggage here.\n\n281\n00:16:03.438 --> 00:16:07.789\nProject Management was really good\nat delivering a new application,\n\n282\n00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:10.450\nlet's say, or a new system.\n\n283\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.810\nThey're really good at delivering\na new system on time and on budget.\n\n284\n00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.600\nWe had a very mature Project Management\noffice that could do that very well.\n\n285\n00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.160\nWhat seemed to be failing a little bit was\nthat, it's one thing to have on time and\n\n286\n00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.070\non budget for\na project which has a known end.\n\n287\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.900\nIt's another thing to have\nthe appropriate funding for\n\n288\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.930\nmanaging operations ongoing, right?\n\n289\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.150\nWhat if you need to patch 300 servers,\nright?\n\n290\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:42.080\nWe had an estate of some 2,800 servers,\na mix of Windows and Unix servers.\n\n291\n00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.190\nSo we got 2,800 servers,\nat any given time,\n\n292\n00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.080\nthe patch levels need to be adjusted,\nright?\n\n293\n00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.370\nWe need to install a security patch,\nor we need to upgrade.\n\n294\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.470\nWe need to upgrade our server 2003\nto server 2008 or 2008 to 2012,\n\n295\n00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.230\nthose kind of things, right?\n\n296\n00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.100\nThat's big, that's not a trivial thing,\nso is that a project?\n\n297\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.580\nIt probably should be\ntreated as a project, right?\n\n298\n00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:09.790\nIt's big, it has a distinct dent, it has\nsufficient scale, it requires money.\n\n299\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.229\nSo considering that project management and\noperations are,\n\n300\n00:17:13.229 --> 00:17:16.346\nsometimes, operations is just\nat the end of a project.\n\n301\n00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:18.402\nProject management\nshould be embedded with.\n\n302\n00:17:18.402 --> 00:17:22.036\nAnd you should have these kind of skill\nsets readily available within your IT\n\n303\n00:17:22.036 --> 00:17:24.130\nservice provider organization.\n\n304\n00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.480\nSo that you can effectively manage\noperations on an ongoing basis.\n\n305\n00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.660\nAnd let's consider\nimplementing a processes.\n\n306\n00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.930\nLet's say, you want to reintroduce\na tool set and a process.\n\n307\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.250\nYou want to integrate incident\nmanagement and problem management.\n\n308\n00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.520\nYou're gonna change both processes.\n\n309\n00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.280\nYou're gonna tweak them to\nsome significant degree and\n\n310\n00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.690\nyou're gonna bring in a new tool set for\nthat.\n\n311\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:47.760\nThat's probably a project too.\n\n312\n00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.340\nYou've got lots of stakeholders to manage,\nyou wanna make sure it's done right,\n\n313\n00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.710\nyou got training to do.\n\n314\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:57.330\nSo just to expect that IT operations\nstaff can just kind of pick\n\n315\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:02.560\nthat kind of work up along the way, may\nbe kind of detrimental to your success.\n\n316\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.830\nPutting a project methodology in front\nof those kinds of activities could be\n\n317\n00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:06.760\nvery beneficial.\n\n318\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.530\nAs this plays out on the exam,\nyou'll certainly see where\n\n319\n00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.410\nyou're trying to marry up project\nmanagement and IT operations.\n\n320\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.702\nAnd you'll see it play out perhaps\nin a scenario that's presenting\n\n321\n00:18:19.702 --> 00:18:23.619\nsomething major change in\noperational activities, right,\n\n322\n00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:28.003\nsuch as refreshing processes, or\nintroducing new tool sets for IT.\n\n323\n00:18:28.003 --> 00:18:31.338\nI think one of the reasons why\nthis happens is a tough one,\n\n324\n00:18:31.338 --> 00:18:34.130\nto consider as we go to\nrisk management as well.\n\n325\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:42.160\nWhen you consider risk in operations,\none of the risk you do face is the cost\n\n326\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.290\nof maintaining these things that\nyou deliver on an ongoing basis.\n\n327\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.400\nPatch levels, application updates,\n\n328\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.380\nrefresher process, the introduction\nof new tool sets for operations.\n\n329\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:01.810\nIf you want to be a self-help tool up,\nin front of users for\n\n330\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.060\nservice requests,\nthat's a significant change.\n\n331\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.450\nSo I think one of the risk is\nunderstanding that that type of\n\n332\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.240\nintroduction, and reducing those types\nof changes does require some management.\n\n333\n00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.490\nSo be careful of those kind of things.\n\n334\n00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.570\nPerhaps you're bringing in new customers,\nmaybe you are at a growth rate now\n\n335\n00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:23.360\nwhere you've been maintaining steady\nstate of 1,500 users for a while.\n\n336\n00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.970\nBut you just acquired a company and\n\n337\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.840\nthey have another 1500\nusers are gonna be joining.\n\n338\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.470\nAre your operational tool sets ready\nto integrate that many more people?\n\n339\n00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.650\nSo I think one of the risks of service\noperations is that you don't get in\n\n340\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.940\nfront of the cost benefit, risk benefit\nanalysis as these changes are happening.\n\n341\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.486\nSo get in front of them,\nget in front of them as best you can.\n\n342\n00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:49.269\nOkay, that'll play out\nas well on the exam,\n\n343\n00:19:49.269 --> 00:19:52.140\nis that you need to be in\nfront of these things.\n\n344\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.960\nAssess, evaluate, move back,\nunderstand what the business value is and\n\n345\n00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.250\nthen move forward.\n\n346\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.240\nDon't just start doing, so\ntell tale sign on an exam\n\n347\n00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.360\nis if you just jump to solution\nwithout reflection and analysis.\n\n348\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.850\nYou're probably not going to get\nthe number five answer or the five answer,\n\n349\n00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.070\nthe best answer, right?\n\n350\n00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:16.310\nDon't jump to solution,\nhave some reflection before you move on.\n\n351\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.060\nThis means that you're going\nto be in front of you,\n\n352\n00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.540\nyou're going to be in service design and\nservice transition.\n\n353\n00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.260\nYou'll recall that among\nthe lifecycle stages, you know,\n\n354\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.830\nwe've got strategy, we've got design,\nwe've got transition, and then operations.\n\n355\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.930\nYou'll also recall, hopefully,\nthat technical management and\n\n356\n00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:38.460\napplication management are two functions\nthat straddle all the stages, right?\n\n357\n00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.260\nSo they are involved upstream in strategy,\ndesign, and\n\n358\n00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.580\ntransition not just playing\nout here in operations.\n\n359\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:50.040\nSo to make sure that you're\noperational sanity is kept.\n\n360\n00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.160\nYou need to have good,\nwise people at these other levels, right.\n\n361\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.140\nIt can't just be driven through\na pie in the sky thing.\n\n362\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.320\nWe'll send it down to operations,\nthey'll figure it out.\n\n363\n00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.630\nThat's the square peg round hole,\nhammering it in, and\n\n364\n00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.720\nthen just kind of pick up\nthe pieces afterwards.\n\n365\n00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.640\nThat can be pretty messy.\n\n366\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.430\nSo getting application management and\ntechnology management upstairs.\n\n367\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.170\nSo to speak in the upper stages\nthe earlier stages of strategy design and\n\n368\n00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:21.072\ntransition is gonna be the key for\nsuccess as well.\n\n369\n00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:25.330\nAll right, another good topic\nconsider as a point of review.\n\n370\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.170\nWe've done this with the functions,\nwe've done this with the processes.\n\n371\n00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.140\nA great place to come for\ngood review is critical assess factors.\n\n372\n00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:37.030\nWell, this is critical assess\nfactors related to implementing\n\n373\n00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:41.250\nservice management, service operations,\nand picking tools, right.\n\n374\n00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.540\nSo, you can see some of\nthe critical assess factors here,\n\n375\n00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.040\nyou need to have management support,\nyou need to have business support.\n\n376\n00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.580\nThe way this plays out on the exam is\nyou need to be thinking about what\n\n377\n00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.710\nyou're trying to do in operations and\nhow that relates to the business, right?\n\n378\n00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.010\nSure you need to improve\ninstant resolution time, but\n\n379\n00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.490\ndon't forget why you need to do that,\nright?\n\n380\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.680\nAnd do you get faster on all incidents or\n\n381\n00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.710\njust faster on those incidents that are\nsupporting critical business activities.\n\n382\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.370\nThat's the kind of\ndecision you need to make.\n\n383\n00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.160\nSo as you're defining your incident models\nperhaps when you get an incident from one\n\n384\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.270\npart of the business you are faster.\n\n385\n00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.860\nBut from another part of the business\nyou can be more deliberate.\n\n386\n00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.790\nSo again, it kind of depends on\nwhat the business is trying to do.\n\n387\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.970\nSo support the business,\nmake sure the business is supporting you.\n\n388\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:31.240\nIt's kind of hard to convince the business\nyou need a new management tool set.\n\n389\n00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.880\nFor instance, the business doesn't\ncare about your tool set, right?\n\n390\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.130\nSo you need to make a business\ncase as to why an improved\n\n391\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.640\ntool set will improve their activity.\n\n392\n00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.270\nConnect and dots and\nyou'll be at a better spot, right?\n\n393\n00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.290\nSo, step one,\nquite a bit as you're going through here,\n\n394\n00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.830\nyou're considering that\nas you go to transition.\n\n395\n00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.240\nYou're going to be setting expectations\nand managing them more effectively.\n\n396\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.900\nSo as a new service is coming in or\n\n397\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.570\nyou're introducing new tool sets,\nyou're gonna be thoroughly testing those.\n\n398\n00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.470\nAnd if you get into the testing and\nrealize that after about 500\n\n399\n00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:10.710\nusers this thing kind of slows down\na little bit, then reset expectations.\n\n400\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:15.080\nIf you're expecting 800 users at\ndifferent times of day on this.\n\n401\n00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.300\nAnd you do your testing and realize\nat about 500 it starts to tail off,\n\n402\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.229\nthen reset expectations that\nthere could be some slow periods.\n\n403\n00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.160\nManaging expectations is also\nmanaging potential disappointments.\n\n404\n00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.450\nIt also can be a way to know,\nwith eyes open, your areas of improvement.\n\n405\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.950\nSo later on, with eyes wide open,\nyou can perhaps ask for\n\n406\n00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.000\nadditional capacity and get the funding\nfor that additional capacity.\n\n407\n00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.750\nBecause you've gone through\nthe trouble of actually testing it.\n\n408\n00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.290\nThat's the kind of thing\nthat transition provides for\n\n409\n00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.970\noperation is the eyes open approach.\n\n410\n00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:53.922\nSo, the same scenario, you're expecting\n800 users to use the application,\n\n411\n00:23:53.922 --> 00:23:57.957\nin your test you realize it starts\nto slow down about 500 users.\n\n412\n00:23:57.957 --> 00:24:01.651\nThen, it shouldn't be surprising then to\nservice desk once it becomes operations,\n\n413\n00:24:01.651 --> 00:24:02.796\nthat they get some calls.\n\n414\n00:24:02.796 --> 00:24:04.525\nIt shouldn't slow today.\n\n415\n00:24:04.525 --> 00:24:06.471\nYeah, these peers are gonna\nbe a little bit slow.\n\n416\n00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:09.560\nWe're working on the capacity\nissues as we speak, thank you.\n\n417\n00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.000\nBut at least it's eyes open.\n\n418\n00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.970\nAnd not surprise and you spend a lot\nof time troubleshooting why is it slow,\n\n419\n00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.060\nwhy is it slow.\n\n420\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.520\nWell you know why it's slow already.\n\n421\n00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:24.884\nThat's what that's about, as an example.\n\n422\n00:24:24.884 --> 00:24:29.310\nCertainly the risk's not having\nthe money to maintain the day to day.\n\n423\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.867\nAgain, from my own experience\nsometimes it was hard to say,\n\n424\n00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:37.077\nwe need a few thousand dollars\nbecause we have to patch 300 servers.\n\n425\n00:24:37.077 --> 00:24:38.024\nWhat?\n\n426\n00:24:38.024 --> 00:24:40.680\nWe didn't account for\nthat in our budgeting this year.\n\n427\n00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.000\nAnd now you tell me, that sort of thing.\n\n428\n00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.790\nSo you need to be proactive about this,\nbudget appropriately.\n\n429\n00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.130\nThe project will have its funds.\n\n430\n00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.580\nAnd it'll have a nice little end date.\n\n431\n00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.826\nOperations needs funds on its\nongoing operations as well, right?\n\n432\n00:24:55.826 --> 00:24:57.402\nAll right.\n\n433\n00:24:57.402 --> 00:24:58.980\nVery good.\n\n434\n00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.960\nSo as you consider this, then.\n\n435\n00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.950\nWe're going to be looking\nat service design and\n\n436\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.070\nservice transition as\nsomething that transition.\n\n437\n00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.900\nI'm sorry, the technology management and\n\n438\n00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.590\napplication management\nfunctions get involved in.\n\n439\n00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.150\nOf course, we've talked about\nthis as we went through.\n\n440\n00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.250\nThis is a great place to come and review.\n\n441\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.780\nHow does operations interact\nwith these processes?\n\n442\n00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.550\nAs this plays out on the exam,\nwhat you're looking for\n\n443\n00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.030\nin many cases on the exam is,\nhave they been involved?\n\n444\n00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.780\nPerhaps the scenario will talk\nabout a particular gap, right?\n\n445\n00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.070\nThey'll say as they went through,\n\n446\n00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:35.150\nit's not typical that service operation\ngets involve in service design, right?\n\n447\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.860\nAnd then some users are complaining that\n\n448\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.720\nthe application is not meeting\nbusiness needs, right?\n\n449\n00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.670\nOkay, connect the dots there.\n\n450\n00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:48.080\nHow can you continually improve service\noperations meeting business needs?\n\n451\n00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.090\nIt might mean adding operations people to\nthe service design activities, all right.\n\n452\n00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.731\nI hope that connects the dots there for\nyou, okay?\n\n453\n00:25:55.731 --> 00:26:01.230\nThat's it, that is implementation\nconsiderations at its technology.\n\n454\n00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:03.890\nThat is operational support\nanalysis in its entirety.\n\n455\n00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n456\n00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:10.325\nTerry, thank you so much for coming by\ntoday and rounding out our ITIL OSA.\n\n457\n00:26:10.325 --> 00:26:13.520\n&gt;&gt; It was a lot of fun, it was a lot\nof information, it was a lot of good\n\n458\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.880\ninformation, specifically if\nyou're gonna wanna take that exam.\n\n459\n00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.260\nBut just in practicum and I've beat\nthis drum quite a few times because\n\n460\n00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.630\nI really see it as a benefit to anyone\nwho just even wanted to take the training\n\n461\n00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.690\nto better understand how\nwe can do operations.\n\n462\n00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.360\nOkay.\nIt can definitely be a benefit to them.\n\n463\n00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.190\nThank you so much Terry.\n\n464\n00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.650\nWe appreciate you dropping by and\nappreciate you\n\n465\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:38.290\nexplaining all these great concepts and\ndetails that we need for the OSA exam.\n\n466\n00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.680\nThat being said, it looks like we've come\nto the end of our series and our episode.\n\n467\n00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.310\nSo we're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n468\n00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.130\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n469\n00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n470\n00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:47.975\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n471\n00:26:50.154 -->

and\nthank you for choosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.607 --> 00:00:17.600\nwhere we help you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.586\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on the sample paper review,\n\n9\n00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:26.390\nand this is a wonderful course ITIL OSA.\n\n10\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.300\nITIL OSA.\n\n11\n00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.050\nAnd who's giving us this information but\nTerry Decker.\n\n12\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.662\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Zack happy to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:35.028\nOSA, Operational Support Analysis.\n\n14\n00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:39.489\nYou've had many episodes exposed to you\nalready regarding the subject matter.\n\n15\n00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.799\nThis particular subject matter is\nhelping you prepare for the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.159\nSo we're gonna be looking\nat sample paper one,\n\n17\n00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.171\none of the downloads you have available to\nyou, and parsing it in a lot of detail so\n\n18\n00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:52.315\nthat you can get inside the head\nof the test maker, if you will.\n\n19\n00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:55.639\nSo as you look at the graphic here,\nthere's actually a prerequisite.\n\n20\n00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:59.326\nBefore you come through this episode\nit is hoped that you actually looked at\n\n21\n00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.211\nthe General Approach to Exam Taking.\n\n22\n00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:05.927\nWhich is a great little download video\nwhere you can explore the general\n\n23\n00:01:05.927 --> 00:01:09.002\ntips related to successful\nITIL exam taking.\n\n24\n00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:13.153\nAnd then you can also need to, it's better\nif you actually take Sample Paper 1,\n\n25\n00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:15.488\nattempt to take this eight-question test.\n\n26\n00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:18.248\nAnd when you download these,\nyou're actually downloading three parts.\n\n27\n00:01:18.248 --> 00:01:22.600\nYou're downloading a scenario booklet,\na question booklet and\n\n28\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.508\nthe answers and rationale.\n\n29\n00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:26.167\nThe scenario booklet and\n\n30\n00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:31.777\nthe question booklet contain very similar\ntopics as you might find on the real exam.\n\n31\n00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:35.474\nThe scenario booklet gives you\na general context in which you're\n\n32\n00:01:35.474 --> 00:01:38.173\ngonna be asked to apply\nyour knowledge of ITIL.\n\n33\n00:01:38.173 --> 00:01:42.097\nAnd of course the question booklet is\nasking the very specific questions which\n\n34\n00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:45.017\nactually exposes the four\nanswers from which you choose.\n\n35\n00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:48.615\nNow for the real exam, of course you're\nnot gonna pass out the answers, but for\n\n36\n00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:49.970\nthe practice ones, they do.\n\n37\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.512\nNot only they give you\nanswers to the questions,\n\n38\n00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:55.922\nthey give you rationale to why\nthe five point answer is the best and\n\n39\n00:01:55.922 --> 00:01:58.411\nwhy the three point answer is not quite so\ngood.\n\n40\n00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:02.383\nSo in this episode, what we're gonna be\ndoing is we're gonna be looking at just\n\n41\n00:02:02.383 --> 00:02:03.999\nthe test maker's techniques.\n\n42\n00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.950\nWe're not gonna rehash every\nbit of the subject matter.\n\n43\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.428\nThat's not what this is about.\n\n44\n00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:13.016\nThis is about test taking and about how\nyou can look inside the scenario, inside\n\n45\n00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:17.896\nthe questions, and take a deliberative\napproach to answering them successfully.\n\n46\n00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:20.968\n&gt;&gt; This is a behind behind\nthe scene kind of look at it.\n\n47\n00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:21.766\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n48\n00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:22.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n49\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.058\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely right.\n\n50\n00:02:24.058 --> 00:02:27.538\nSo assuming you've already taken\na Sample Paper 1 and have attempted it,\n\n51\n00:02:27.538 --> 00:02:31.240\nwe're now gonna look into it with some\nlevel of detail about the methodology you\n\n52\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.461\nshould take to be successful on any\nsample paper that you might take.\n\n53\n00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:35.910\nAll right, so let's have a look.\n\n54\n00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.701\nFirst of all, question one.\n\n55\n00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:40.910\nAs you look here at the graphic, right?\n\n56\n00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.173\nThe blue text and\nthe red text and the green text.\n\n57\n00:02:43.173 --> 00:02:47.822\nThis is just pointing to the reality\nthat almost any scenario presents\n\n58\n00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:49.807\nthree types of information.\n\n59\n00:02:49.807 --> 00:02:54.030\nIn this case, the blue text is\nrepresenting the business context.\n\n60\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.139\nThe business strategy or direction.\n\n61\n00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.420\nWhat's the business up to?\n\n62\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.946\nIt's probably, among the three types of\ninformation you get in the scenario is\n\n63\n00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:03.275\nthe least critical to your\nsuccess on the question.\n\n64\n00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:05.770\nI'm not saying it's irrelevant completely.\n\n65\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.635\nI'm just saying it's not critical to\nthe way you approach the question.\n\n66\n00:03:08.635 --> 00:03:11.460\nIt's a little bit of\nbackground information.\n\n67\n00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.878\nNow, the green bits I refer to that as\nthe IT service provider's context or\n\n68\n00:03:16.878 --> 00:03:23.418\ntheir specific strengths and weaknesses or\ntheir capabilities or constraints, right?\n\n69\n00:03:23.418 --> 00:03:27.851\nSo every scenario question will probably\nplay out something to do with the current\n\n70\n00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:28.760\ncapabilities.\n\n71\n00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.896\nSo the reason that's important, if your\nreading scenario and it says the IT\n\n72\n00:03:33.896 --> 00:03:39.031\nprovider, you, the IT service provider\nif really great at X then you don't\n\n73\n00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:44.425\nwanna pick the answer that says lets\nimprove X, obviously that's a mismatch.\n\n74\n00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:48.440\nThe scenario is showing you a strength,\nyou don't need to go and prove it.\n\n75\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.989\nWhat you got to work on, what you\ngotta focus on is not what's good,\n\n76\n00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.853\nyou gotta focus on what's been\nidentified as bad, or the deficiencies,\n\n77\n00:03:55.853 --> 00:03:59.990\nor the specific questions, or specific\nchallenges that have been rendered.\n\n78\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.491\nIn this particular question, that is\nplayed out in the question itself, and\n\n79\n00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:08.060\nin this case in the red text, so\nit's just a way to parse out.\n\n80\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.774\nSo to a recap,\n\n81\n00:04:08.774 --> 00:04:12.352\nwhen you grid in this scenario,\nthere's gonna be a business context.\n\n82\n00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.575\nThere's gonna be words\nassociated with that.\n\n83\n00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:17.808\nThere's gonna be words associated with\nthe IT service providers context.\n\n84\n00:04:17.808 --> 00:04:21.628\nAnd there's gonna be words about\nthe specific deficiencies, or\n\n85\n00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:26.050\nthe specific demands that are gonna\nbe asked of you to solve, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.611\nIn this particular question,\nyou'll see that question one,\n\n87\n00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:29.880\nwhich I'll read it verbatim.\n\n88\n00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.042\nWhich one of the following\nsets of metrics can best\n\n89\n00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:38.280\nbe used to determine the cause of poor\nsupport levels and plan improvements?\n\n90\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.945\nSo we're looking at metrics, clearly.\n\n91\n00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:44.140\nAnd again, I've already done the parsing\nhere, but what are the deficiencies?\n\n92\n00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.570\nThe specific deficiencies or\n\n93\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.632\nrequested actions are during the last two\nmonths some complaints have been received\n\n94\n00:04:49.632 --> 00:04:52.393\nregarding poor levels of\nservice from the service desk.\n\n95\n00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:55.860\nThese include telephone calls not\nbeing answered quickly enough.\n\n96\n00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.652\nSo we got speed to response and\n\n97\n00:04:57.652 --> 00:05:01.753\nservice desk agents taking too long\nto provide first line support.\n\n98\n00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:07.950\nSo now you have time to respond plus\ntime to resolve at the first line.\n\n99\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.153\nThe number of complaints seemed to\nincrease whenever a new release\n\n100\n00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:13.910\nof the main booking system,\ntravel book, is deployed.\n\n101\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.527\nSo there seems to be some connection\nbetween the volume of calls that come in\n\n102\n00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:22.890\nand change management or\nrelease management, I should say, right?\n\n103\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.419\nSo some cause and\neffect may be in play there.\n\n104\n00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.340\nWe have to explore a little\nbit later what this means.\n\n105\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.353\nSo what are you gonna measure to tease\nout those particular deficiencies?\n\n106\n00:05:31.353 --> 00:05:35.216\nAnd then later there's in order to\nplan this support, the release and\n\n107\n00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:38.754\ndeployment manager has suggested\nthat the service desk manager\n\n108\n00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:42.950\nreview reports of the relevant\nmetrics used by the service desk.\n\n109\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.801\nSo we're gonna do a review of metrics as\nit relates to these specific deficiencies.\n\n110\n00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:50.845\nTime to respond, time to solve,\n\n111\n00:05:50.845 --> 00:05:55.090\nand a high volume occurring\nwhenever there's a change.\n\n112\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.755\nSo you see the narrow focus\nof this particular question?\n\n113\n00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:58.853\nWe're not gonna solve all\nof ITIL's problems or\n\n114\n00:05:58.853 --> 00:06:02.070\nall of this service provider problems,\nwe're focused on these.\n\n115\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.047\nSo let's have a look at the question and\nthe answers, all right?\n\n116\n00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:07.150\nAgain, I've kinda done\nthe deliberate work here.\n\n117\n00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.090\nI've looked at the rationale and\n\n118\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.454\nyou can see my color treatment here has\nsuggested that B is the Five answer,\n\n119\n00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:17.067\nit's got all green,\nthere's nothing wrong with B, right?\n\n120\n00:06:17.067 --> 00:06:19.652\nOf course you wouldn't do that,\nas you're taking the exam,\n\n121\n00:06:19.652 --> 00:06:22.686\nyou're not gonna just go automatically\ngravitate to the green answer,\n\n122\n00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:24.693\nbecause they're not gonna color code for\nyou.\n\n123\n00:06:24.693 --> 00:06:25.507\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n124\n00:06:25.507 --> 00:06:26.771\nthey're gonna be mostly black and\nwhite, right?\n\n125\n00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:27.498\nYou gotta figure this out.\n\n126\n00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:30.731\nSo a good approach here is just\nto do a compare and contrast,\n\n127\n00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:32.743\nwhat do they have in common, right?\n\n128\n00:06:32.743 --> 00:06:37.510\nAnd maybe you can see some glaring\nmistakes as you read, right?\n\n129\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.898\nThat aren't directly related to the\nscenario,they don't focus on the customer\n\n130\n00:06:40.898 --> 00:06:41.640\nwell enough etc.\n\n131\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.843\nSo as we begin to evaluate\nthe different bullet points or\n\n132\n00:06:44.843 --> 00:06:48.182\nthe different treatments here,\nyou can do the compare and\n\n133\n00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:51.680\ncontrast methods to see about\nthe good ones and the bad ones.\n\n134\n00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.720\nSo let's just take a look\nat A as we see here.\n\n135\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.083\nThey're talking about a metric here,\nthey talk about the metric,\n\n136\n00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:59.100\npercentage of changes responded\nto within the target time.\n\n137\n00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.975\nWhat relevance does that have\nto what we just talked about?\n\n138\n00:07:03.975 --> 00:07:06.757\nThe three things we were talking\nabout was response time,\n\n139\n00:07:06.757 --> 00:07:10.130\nwhen someone calls, the service desk,\nhow quickly it is to respond.\n\n140\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.468\nHow quickly we resolve the issue at\nthe first line, the service desk, right?\n\n141\n00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:19.790\nAnd then third that there seem\nto be a high volume of incidents\n\n142\n00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.630\nrelated to new releases.\n\n143\n00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.409\nWhat does that metric\nhave to do with anything?\n\n144\n00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:28.802\nI'm already kinda suspicious about A,\nbecause that first metric doesn't do\n\n145\n00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:33.604\nanything with those three specific issues\ndisplayed out, in the scenario, right?\n\n146\n00:07:33.604 --> 00:07:37.570\nSo A is kinda suspicious, but\nlet me read forward then.\n\n147\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.222\nThe next metric in A, incident first\nline support fix rate per IT service.\n\n148\n00:07:42.222 --> 00:07:46.470\nLet's get a little closer to the meat,\nit is a little bit, but\n\n149\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.908\nfirst line support fix rate,\nthe percentage of things they do.\n\n150\n00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:53.179\nThat's kind of important,\nbut not critical,\n\n151\n00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:55.861\nbecause they're talking about\nhow long it takes them.\n\n152\n00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:58.716\nNot, how many they happen to get done.\n\n153\n00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:03.025\nSo when they take on first line support,\nhow quick are they able to resolve that?\n\n154\n00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:06.740\nIt was about speed,\nnot volume or percentage.\n\n155\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.530\nSo I'm kinda suspect on\nthat one a little bit.\n\n156\n00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.280\nSo see, I'm gonna kinda kick a to the curb\na little bit I've already seen 2 demerits.\n\n157\n00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.673\nIt's not my five answer.\n\n158\n00:08:14.673 --> 00:08:16.471\nIf I have to come back to it I will, but\n\n159\n00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:20.323\nI have two demerits I've only read two\nthings, time to kick a out of the house.\n\n160\n00:08:20.323 --> 00:08:26.062\nLook at B, B looks at volume of\ntelephone calls per IT service,\n\n161\n00:08:26.062 --> 00:08:28.460\nper hour of the day by day.\n\n162\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.490\nWe're talking about volume,\n\n163\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.500\nthat could be relevant especially when I\ncompare that volume to release changes.\n\n164\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.290\nWhen will these happen?\n\n165\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.770\nSo that's a meaningful one.\n\n166\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.650\nWhat time of day, right?\n\n167\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.500\nAverage duration of telephone calls.\n\n168\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.840\nWe'll talk about time and\neffort in approaching those, right?\n\n169\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.360\nNumber of business log by IT service\ntype-in by user and by white department.\n\n170\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.710\nAgain, relative,\nwhat's it related to, right?\n\n171\n00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.710\nAnd then incident first line\nsupport fixed rate, not bad,\n\n172\n00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.470\nthe fixed rate is in play for\nfirst line support.\n\n173\n00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.390\nHow good are they doing that, all right?\n\n174\n00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.710\nNow we gotta match these up,\nso the metrics sound good.\n\n175\n00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.780\nDo they actually have a corresponding,\nsee, if I look at c Looks\n\n176\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.805\nlike we have volume number of telephone\ncalls, volume of telephone calls.\n\n177\n00:09:19.805 --> 00:09:23.080\nRough enough,\nthis one flushes out a little bit more,\n\n178\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.610\ntalked about per hour, time of day, etc.,\nso a little bit more nuisance in that one.\n\n179\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.090\nBut number and volume, those are similar.\n\n180\n00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:35.110\nNumber of incidents closed,\nthat's not necessarily gonna help us much.\n\n181\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.410\nNumber of change raised again,\n\n182\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.700\nnot helping us much as we\nrelease this particular issue.\n\n183\n00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.520\nSo you see you can have issue with\nthe actual metric being in play.\n\n184\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.630\nCompare and contrast as you go,\ndoes it match the scenario?\n\n185\n00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.630\nEasily get rid of the ones that\nhave no bearing on it, quickly.\n\n186\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.490\nAnd then hone in on the ones that\nattempt to have bearing, and\n\n187\n00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.918\nyou'll be more likely to find you\nthe water they want you to drink.\n\n188\n00:09:58.918 --> 00:09:59.880\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, all right?\n\n189\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.790\n&gt;&gt; Again not hashing out the details\nof this particular question you\n\n190\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.040\ncan read the answers and the rationale\nin that portion of the sample paper.\n\n191\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.550\nI highly encourage you to do so, so\nthat you can learn the subject matter\n\n192\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.492\nI'm giving you an approach to finding\nthe right nuggets that you want.\n\n193\n00:10:14.492 --> 00:10:15.850\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:16.760\nWell done sir.\n\n195\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Good, now, question two.\n\n196\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.590\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; As we've done before, I just broken\n\n197\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.160\nthis down into the business context,\nversus the IT service provider context,\n\n198\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.565\nversus the very specific deficiencies or\nactions being requested, right?\n\n199\n00:10:30.565 --> 00:10:31.150\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n200\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.940\nthe major request comes from\nthe question itself, as usual.\n\n201\n00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.590\nWhich one of the following options is\nthe best set of access management related\n\n202\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.610\nactivities that must be undertaken to\naccommodate the teller commuter program.\n\n203\n00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.760\nSo obviously you need to know something\nabout the teller commuter program.\n\n204\n00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.686\nThat's what the business context is gonna\nhelp give you the necessary grist for\n\n205\n00:10:49.686 --> 00:10:54.333\nthe mill as you start grinding through\non the questions themselves right?\n\n206\n00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:54.837\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n207\n00:10:54.837 --> 00:10:58.316\nyou also have to focus again on\nthe specific questions, so don't let all\n\n208\n00:10:58.316 --> 00:11:01.950\nthe fluff, all the blue distract you\nfrom what you really need to solve.\n\n209\n00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.660\nAnd that's gonna be, I've highlighted them\nin red here where it says, you represent\n\n210\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.410\nthe service desk and are participating on\na team that is determining what changes\n\n211\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.240\nmust be made to the access management\nprocess to accommodate this new program.\n\n212\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.140\nRight, so you're gonna have to make\nchanges to stuff that already existed.\n\n213\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.520\nSo here you need to know what is the\nbefore so you know what to change, right?\n\n214\n00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.250\nMaybe access management is perfect you\nonly need to tweak it a little bit.\n\n215\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.880\nSo that's where the green\ncontext can kinda come in handy.\n\n216\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.390\nWhat are you good at,\nwhat are you not good at, right?\n\n217\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.740\nThe access management process\nis working well it says and\n\n218\n00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.890\nit's based on ITEL best practice.\n\n219\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.204\nSo we're not talking about\na major shift change here, right?\n\n220\n00:11:39.204 --> 00:11:42.380\nThe organization adopted ITIL\nmore than ten years ago.\n\n221\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.470\nSo this is not a fly by night\norganization just thought about ITIL\n\n222\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.630\na couple of weeks ago.\n\n223\n00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.570\nThey've been in play and\nthey're saying very clearly\n\n224\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.530\nthat access management is not broken,\nwe just got a new thing coming.\n\n225\n00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.003\nHow are we going to take care of it,\nright?\n\n226\n00:11:57.003 --> 00:12:01.820\nIt's also, IT service management\npractices are in general quite mature.\n\n227\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.160\nSo, the reason why that's relevant in\na question like this, or any question for\n\n228\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.670\nthat matter,\nis that it's showing strength.\n\n229\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.482\nSo, if you find an answer that is just\nthrowing the baby out with the bath water,\n\n230\n00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:15.570\nrewrite all the access management\nprocesses, we got to start all over.\n\n231\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.590\nThat can't be the right answer, right?\n\n232\n00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.396\nThat sort of thing, right?\n\n233\n00:12:20.396 --> 00:12:24.885\nAnd then following as you see the last\nparagraph, we got the team working on this\n\n234\n00:12:24.885 --> 00:12:29.106\nproject includes represent us from\nhuman resources, so you got a business\n\n235\n00:12:29.106 --> 00:12:34.064\nstakeholder involve, you got information\nsecurity management which is a appropriate\n\n236\n00:12:34.064 --> 00:12:38.290\nstakeholder and all of the service\noperational functions, right.\n\n237\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.745\nTurn the commencement operations\nmanagement application management and\n\n238\n00:12:42.745 --> 00:12:44.200\nthe service desk.\n\n239\n00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.000\nEveryone that manages the day\nto day operations are in play.\n\n240\n00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.916\nFollowing a revision of\nthe information security policy and\n\n241\n00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:52.918\ninternational brainstorming session,\n\n242\n00:12:52.918 --> 00:12:56.244\nthe team is preparing to present\nthe recommendation to management.\n\n243\n00:12:56.244 --> 00:12:57.460\nSo they've done a lot of good work.\n\n244\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.230\nFirst of all, they're fairly mature and\n\n245\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.110\nthey've got a lot of people together\nthey got the right kind of stakeholders\n\n246\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.780\ntogether and they're trying to\npresent the recommendations.\n\n247\n00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.214\nSo again, the recommendations for\nhow we're going to\n\n248\n00:13:10.214 --> 00:13:14.703\naccommodate this new requirement of\nthe business which is in the blue.\n\n249\n00:13:14.703 --> 00:13:16.070\nAll right, let's move forward here.\n\n250\n00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n251\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.790\n&gt;&gt; So again compare and contrast can help\nus find the water we need to drink here.\n\n252\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.390\nSo if we look at the first bullet in A,\ncreate a service request model for\n\n253\n00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.490\nuse and authorizing or\nrevoking telecommunicator status.\n\n254\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.010\nDoesn't sound too bad, right?\n\n255\n00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:39.070\nB says, update information security policy\nto include program rules and regulations.\n\n256\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.270\nThere's nothing to suggest that\nthe existing security policy is broken.\n\n257\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.770\nSo this is one of these things is\nkind of going down the wrong path\n\n258\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.210\nof fixing things, because the scenario\ndidn't say the policies are bad.\n\n259\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.630\nIn fact,\nit says something quite different.\n\n260\n00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.560\nWe are mature in this space, so\n\n261\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.860\nwhy go back to an earlier stage\nin the development of maturity,\n\n262\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:03.020\nwhich is policy and programmatic things\nand start trying to remedy those?\n\n263\n00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.500\nSo B is kinda suspect on the first bullet.\n\n264\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.930\nAs I look at C, the first bullet,\ncreate a service request model for\n\n265\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.220\nuse in authorizing or\nrevoking telecommunications desk.\n\n266\n00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.380\nWell at least it equals A and\nthey both sounded pretty good.\n\n267\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.790\nAnd by the way, D says the same thing.\n\n268\n00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.590\nSo A, C, and\nD are starting off with the same premise.\n\n269\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:26.940\nEither that means B is the best answer and\nthe other ones are outliers, or\n\n270\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.850\nB is already suspect, you see how you can\nkind of isolate B in this particular case?\n\n271\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.620\nAnd this doesn't mean eliminate B, unless\nyou find something directly wrong with it.\n\n272\n00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.660\nSo let's look a little bit longer at B,\nis there something else that stinks?\n\n273\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.500\nRight, first it's kinda smelly,\nis there something else?\n\n274\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.620\nIt says add the telecommunicator\nprogram to the service catalog.\n\n275\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.680\nWhy we have data in service catalog, we\nare talking about access management here.\n\n276\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.360\nRight, again, it's not fitting\nin with the specific scenario.\n\n277\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.490\nSo, I'm coming be out,\nit's gonna be an out wire.\n\n278\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.644\nIt's gone, right?\n\n279\n00:14:59.644 --> 00:15:03.810\nNow go back to A, looking at A,\nlooking into second bullet.\n\n280\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.540\nIdentify managers authorized to grant\ntelecommunicator access request.\n\n281\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.517\nIts not a bad idea it's probably why I\nhave it in brown here it's not wrong.\n\n282\n00:15:13.517 --> 00:15:16.170\nLets see if the second bullet\nover in C is any better.\n\n283\n00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.950\nCreator telecommunicator group,\n\n284\n00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.150\ntalking about access management here,\ncreator telecommunicator group and\n\n285\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.295\nreflect associated rights and\nthe directory of the services.\n\n286\n00:15:25.295 --> 00:15:28.182\nLet's talking about the details\nof access management,\n\n287\n00:15:28.182 --> 00:15:31.496\nwhich by the way is what were\ntrying to accommodate here, right?\n\n288\n00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:33.600\nAnd then, D the second bullet.\n\n289\n00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.340\nIdentify any potential role conflicts and\ndetermine how they'll be resolved.\n\n290\n00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.320\nThat's maybe jumping a little ahead, it's\nnot wrong but it's not methodical, right?\n\n291\n00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.707\nWe're kinda jumping at things\nthat might not be a problem.\n\n292\n00:15:47.707 --> 00:15:51.468\nAnalyze those things, sure, right?\n\n293\n00:15:51.468 --> 00:15:52.943\nAre there potential conflicts?\n\n294\n00:15:52.943 --> 00:15:54.522\nMaybe there is important we to do that.\n\n295\n00:15:54.522 --> 00:15:56.193\nBut if you get your groups right and\n\n296\n00:15:56.193 --> 00:16:00.720\nyour roles right in access management,\nthat kind of tends to take care of itself.\n\n297\n00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.120\nSo C is smelling a little bit\nbetter as we look at this.\n\n298\n00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.030\nLook at the third bullet,\nagain, I'm discounting B.\n\n299\n00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:11.150\nI haven't got any discounters yet for\nA and D yet, or C for that matter.\n\n300\n00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.462\nLooking at A, identify the third bullet,\nidentify any potential role conflicts and\n\n301\n00:16:15.462 --> 00:16:17.050\ndetermine how they will be resolved.\n\n302\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.840\nWell that equals what we had over in D,\nmaybe good.\n\n303\n00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:26.340\nGoing over to D, user request for\nchange to grant pilot participants\n\n304\n00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.683\naccess to the t office application.\n\n305\n00:16:29.683 --> 00:16:32.045\nRequest for change.\n\n306\n00:16:32.045 --> 00:16:37.940\nA request for change is a methodology\nthat ends up going to a CAD meeting.\n\n307\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.560\nA CAD meeting might meet once a week,\nit might meet once a month.\n\n308\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:47.450\nWhy would you want to introduce\na bottleneck for change requests\n\n309\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:52.270\nwhen you probably want to standardize\nthe approach to granting access.\n\n310\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:57.490\nSo D is starting to smell a bit\nabout too much bureaucracy.\n\n311\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.340\nNow in the absence of\nan access management process,\n\n312\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.780\nwhich is certainly not the case here.\n\n313\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.390\nIn fact access management's\nconsidered mature.\n\n314\n00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.310\nIn the absence of an access management\nprocess then maybe the best thing you\n\n315\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:11.240\ncan possibly do to control this is\nthrough a formal change process.\n\n316\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.100\nBut what access management is\ntrying to do is to standardize and\n\n317\n00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.160\nstreamline these kinds of changes.\n\n318\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.960\nSo going through a formal change review\nprocess is probably not what you need.\n\n319\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.730\nSo D is starting to smell\na little bit as well.\n\n320\n00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.950\nSo you see I'm going through this bullet\nby bullet and trying to find, and again,\n\n321\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.600\nI'm applying knowledge.\n\n322\n00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.450\nI'm not just trying to\nregurgitate knowledge.\n\n323\n00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:36.500\nI'm applying what I know about ITIL\nto the given case in this scenario,\n\n324\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.930\nand D is now starting to\nsmell a little bit as well.\n\n325\n00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.770\nSo D's got a smelly one,\nA, not blatantly smelling,\n\n326\n00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.590\nbut doesn't seem to be on target.\n\n327\n00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.920\nLet's continue to hone in on C and\nsee if they still make sense.\n\n328\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.410\nThe third bullet in C,\nestablish access monitoring and control\n\n329\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:57.400\nto ensure rights are being properly used,\nthat's standard bill-of-fare.\n\n330\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.290\nMeasure telecommuter access request and\nwork with incident management to resolve\n\n331\n00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:06.260\nincidents caused by incorrect telecommuter\naccess strategy or settings, I should say.\n\n332\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.090\nSo effectively, what you're talking\nabout here is a service request model,\n\n333\n00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:14.350\nfollowed by group management, followed by\n\n334\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:18.590\nmonitoring to make sure the right people\nhave it and the wrong people don't.\n\n335\n00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.460\nAnd ongoing access to any incidents\nwhere there are breaches in security.\n\n336\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.100\nThat's what access management does.\n\n337\n00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.490\nYou have a mature access\nmanagement process now.\n\n338\n00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.444\nApply those same techniques to this\nnew requirement called telecommuter.\n\n339\n00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:32.115\n&gt;&gt; Action over the theory.\n\n340\n00:18:32.115 --> 00:18:36.797\n&gt;&gt; Action over the theory,\nabsolutely, very good.\n\n341\n00:18:36.797 --> 00:18:39.860\n&gt;&gt; Moving on\n&gt;&gt; Moving on indeed, to question three.\n\n342\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.060\nAs we've done before we want to try\nto break down the business context\n\n343\n00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.000\nfrom the IT service provider context from\nthe actual deficiencies that we need to\n\n344\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.270\naddress.\n\n345\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.290\nSo that's what the color text does for\nhere, and as you read any question and\n\n346\n00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.320\nany scenario,\nbe thinking about how to categorize that.\n\n347\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.700\nAnd always,\nI mean you're gonna focus on all three.\n\n348\n00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.880\nYou can't ignore any of the three, but\n\n349\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.170\nof course the biggest focus is\ngonna be what is the specific ask.\n\n350\n00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.440\nWhat are we being asked to solve?\n\n351\n00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.120\nCuz that's what you gotta focus on.\n\n352\n00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.330\nThe green parts will give you\nsome context for that and\n\n353\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.539\nactually may point to things you don't\nneed to solve, they'll describe strength.\n\n354\n00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.880\nSo you don't wanna go on those.\n\n355\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.420\nSo if you look at the specific ask in this\ncase, you'll see that it's pretty clear in\n\n356\n00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.950\nthe question, what best reflects\nhow ITIL best practices and\n\n357\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.847\nproblem management can be\nused to resolve this problem.\n\n358\n00:19:25.847 --> 00:19:30.580\nSo we're looking at how ITIL would\ntake you problem management approach\n\n359\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:34.140\ngiven a problem management best\npractice to the specific problems.\n\n360\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.840\nSo what are the problems?\n\n361\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.570\nThe problems, in this case,\nare identified.\n\n362\n00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:38.880\nI put them in red here.\n\n363\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.300\nBut it starts off right away that,\nthe sales team has been experiencing\n\n364\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:48.590\nproblems with their laptops during\na heavily busy time for sales members.\n\n365\n00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.640\nThe incident team, the help desk,\nthe service desk has found that there's\n\n366\n00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.540\na increase in calls related\nto sales teams laptops.\n\n367\n00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.100\nAnd it just so happens it's coinciding\nwith the very busy time for\n\n368\n00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.860\nthe sales team,\ncuz there could be a real business impact.\n\n369\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.970\nIn other words,\nthe priority is gonna up for this.\n\n370\n00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.200\nIn the green bits here,\nthe server file current things.\n\n371\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.100\nYou have a problem manager,\nyou are a problem manager and you've\n\n372\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.320\nbeen asked to join the meeting and say,\nhey, what are you gonna do about this?\n\n373\n00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.780\nYou agree to raise a problem record,\nand you leave the meeting to begin\n\n374\n00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.110\nassembling a problem solving group to\ninvestigate and diagnose the root cause.\n\n375\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.580\nYou'll recall that problem management\nis very deliberative in its approach.\n\n376\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.810\nIt's going to look at trends,\nlook at data, and\n\n377\n00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.190\nget to the bottom of it, root cause.\n\n378\n00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.540\nAnd then hopefully move forward\nwith some action plans, or\n\n379\n00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.230\npotential work-arounds to shore up this.\n\n380\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.120\nMaybe what they need to do is shore up\nthe knowledge base of the incident team.\n\n381\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.510\nMaybe they need to have a fast way\nto reprovision laptops in this high\n\n382\n00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.300\nenergy period, there could be\nall kinds of sources of action.\n\n383\n00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.570\nI'm not trying to predict that,\nI'm just saying that problem management is\n\n384\n00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:55.290\ndeliberative in looking at the big picture\nand if they can't resolve it right now,\n\n385\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.470\ncome up with a way to work\naround the issues if possible.\n\n386\n00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.410\nSo let's take a look at how\nthe answers play out in that regard.\n\n387\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.740\nAgain, compare and\ncontrast as we go through here.\n\n388\n00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.650\nLooking at the very first\nsentence of each of these.\n\n389\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.970\nA says log the problem,\n\n390\n00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.460\nrecord the result of the brainstorming\nsession in the description field.\n\n391\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.520\nSo basically, log the brainstorming\nsession and you have record of it.\n\n392\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.690\nB does the same thing, log the problem and\n\n393\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.510\ncross reference it to related incidents,\nthat's even better.\n\n394\n00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:27.530\nYou got a bunch of incidences coming in,\nbeing able to link all those incidents to\n\n395\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.950\nyour overarching problem records to where\nto connect the dots among the processes.\n\n396\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.753\nA very powerful data management\ntechnique that ITIL recommends.\n\n397\n00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:40.600\nRead the ITIL books, you take this course\nthrough ITProTV, you will learn that\n\n398\n00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.347\nprocess integration is certainly a best\npractice recommendation of ITIL.\n\n399\n00:21:44.347 --> 00:21:49.150\nSo B's looking a little bit better in\nthis connection between problem data and\n\n400\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.090\nincident data.\n\n401\n00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.120\nSo far so good.\n\n402\n00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.550\nA is looking good, B's looking good,\nlet's have a look at C.\n\n403\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.730\nRecord and publish the minutes of your\nmeeting with the service desk team.\n\n404\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:04.530\nNo particular place where they said to do\nthat, it's just meeting minutes somewhere.\n\n405\n00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.600\nMeeting minutes aren't wrong, but\n\n406\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.650\nit's not some of the most pertinent place\nto put this problem management data.\n\n407\n00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:16.270\nYou should have it within the records of\nthe problem management ticket itself, so\n\n408\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.590\nC's kind of suspect.\n\n409\n00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:22.650\nNot blatantly wrong, but certainly not\nkeeping a data set related to problems.\n\n410\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.890\nAnd certainly not linking them to your\nunderlying IT service management data.\n\n411\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.150\nAnd then D says log and\ncategorize the problem, and\n\n412\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.590\ncross relate it to all related incidents.\n\n413\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.120\nAgain D's starting off pretty good.\n\n414\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.140\nMoving on to the second sentence,\nwe compare and contrast.\n\n415\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.050\nWe go back and forth.\n\n416\n00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.800\nIt's interesting that D,\ngoing backwards now from D across.\n\n417\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.960\nD says assign a high priority to it.\n\n418\n00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.400\nPriority is based on impact and\n\n419\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.880\nurgency, how quickly must we resolve\nthis and how big is the impact.\n\n420\n00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.780\nI don't think you've done analysis yet,\njust yet, high priority, maybe.\n\n421\n00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.612\nIt might be in play,\nit might not be in play.\n\n422\n00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:08.100\nIt seemed like a high priority issue\nbased on the incident data, only maybe,\n\n423\n00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.310\nwe're not really sure just yet.\n\n424\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.240\nSo I have it in red here but\nit's only really kinda suspect.\n\n425\n00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.700\nThe rest of it looks pretty good.\n\n426\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.550\nComing back,\nlet's see the second part of C,\n\n427\n00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.690\nsee if we can start getting rid of C here.\n\n428\n00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.660\nThe minutes didn't seem\nlike a great place to be,\n\n429\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.880\nthe problem records seemed even better.\n\n430\n00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.170\nAs senior management is involved,\nlog a known error.\n\n431\n00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.310\nWhat does senior management have\nto do with logging a known error?\n\n432\n00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.280\nVirtually nothing, known error\ndatabases support the service desk,\n\n433\n00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.603\nnot senior management.\n\n434\n00:23:40.603 --> 00:23:46.683\nThe primary purpose for a known error\nrecord is to streamline the incident\n\n435\n00:23:46.683 --> 00:23:52.872\nmanagement process, not to give\nmanagers some link to remedial actions.\n\n436\n00:23:52.872 --> 00:23:54.593\nIt's not related to that at all.\n\n437\n00:23:54.593 --> 00:23:56.796\nSo C is smelling on the first two counts.\n\n438\n00:23:56.796 --> 00:24:01.672\nIt's logging minutes and providing\na known error database to someone\n\n439\n00:24:01.672 --> 00:24:06.640\nthat can't spell K-E-D-B,\nit's known error database by the way.\n\n440\n00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.205\nAll right, so\nsee I'm gonna kick it to the side,\n\n441\n00:24:09.205 --> 00:24:12.092\njust evaluate this other ones back and\nforth, right?\n\n442\n00:24:12.092 --> 00:24:14.676\nI kinda find too much smelly on C.\n\n443\n00:24:14.676 --> 00:24:16.172\nAnd again, going back and\n\n444\n00:24:16.172 --> 00:24:20.865\nforth among these things I'm not gonna\nteach the rationale for each one of these,\n\n445\n00:24:20.865 --> 00:24:25.100\nthat's the approach in test taking\neliminate and go back and forth.\n\n446\n00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.510\nI start at the top,\nwork my way back through,\n\n447\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.320\njust going through these like that.\n\n448\n00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.570\nFound a smelly one, got rid of it.\n\n449\n00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.770\nSniff out the bad remarks and\nget rid of them.\n\n450\n00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.930\nEventually you'll coalesce\naround a good answer.\n\n451\n00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.670\n&gt;&gt; And\nif it isn't smelly it might be squishy.\n\n452\n00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.350\nYou're right,\nit could be smelly and squishy.\n\n453\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.930\n&gt;&gt; Or both, yeah.\n\n454\n00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:42.630\n&gt;&gt; It could be both.\n\n455\n00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.375\nWe're talking snails here, right?\n\n456\n00:24:44.375 --> 00:24:45.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do snails smell?\n\n457\n00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.980\n&gt;&gt; I think they do, yeah.\n\n458\n00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:51.920\n&gt;&gt; Question 4, right?\n\n459\n00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.570\nYou are the data center manager.\n\n460\n00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.520\nWhich of the following options\nbest describes your requirements\n\n461\n00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.960\nof the service desk software?\n\n462\n00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.680\nSo the way this one plays out,\nlook how much green there is.\n\n463\n00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.840\nThere's no blue by the way.\n\n464\n00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.060\nThere's no business context.\n\n465\n00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.430\nThis is just diving in to\nthe IT service provider and\n\n466\n00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.960\nlooking at possible function or\ndysfunction within it, right?\n\n467\n00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.020\nThe way the green plays out is it's trying\nto point out that the service test manager\n\n468\n00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.630\nand the data center manager has\nsome shared responsibilities.\n\n469\n00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.020\nThe service desk is not always open.\n\n470\n00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.900\nAnd when they go home at night,\nthe data center manager and\n\n471\n00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.440\nthe data center team are responsible for\npicking up the phone if a user calls.\n\n472\n00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.330\nThat's not necessarily broken,\n\n473\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.390\nI'm not saying that's wrong,\nITIL is not saying that's wrong.\n\n474\n00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:38.910\nBut there's a reality here within\nthis service provider where the data\n\n475\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:44.490\ncenter team has some service desk\nresponsibilities at certain times of day.\n\n476\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.710\nThat's how this one is playing out.\n\n477\n00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.530\nYou have some software tools in\nplace as a data center manager.\n\n478\n00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.380\nBut all of the systems are fragmented and\n\n479\n00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.030\nthere are no centralized\ndatabase holding this information\n\n480\n00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.460\nto enable trends to be established against\nthe patterns of business activity.\n\n481\n00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.690\nSo you're seeing a particular\ndysfunctional aspect.\n\n482\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.500\nNot only does the service desk team and\nthe data center team have shared\n\n483\n00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.500\nresponsibilities as it relates\nto responding to the users.\n\n484\n00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.390\nYou have bad data, so\nwhich one is the highest priority?\n\n485\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:19.950\nLet's see how the question plays out,\nit says you are the data center manager,\n\n486\n00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.899\nwhich one of the following options\nbest describes your requirements\n\n487\n00:26:23.899 --> 00:26:27.185\nif you're going to purchase\nnew service desk software.\n\n488\n00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:29.926\nInside the software is not\nlinked to underlying data and\n\n489\n00:26:29.926 --> 00:26:32.795\nyou have shared responsibilities\nwith the service desk.\n\n490\n00:26:32.795 --> 00:26:33.500\nLet's check it out.\n\n491\n00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.930\nOkay, again, compare and\ncontrast as we go through here.\n\n492\n00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.405\nNothing really magical about\nthis compare and contrasting.\n\n493\n00:26:40.405 --> 00:26:43.470\nAgain, we went across,\nthe service desk provides coverage for\n\n494\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.600\nfull business hours, so there is no\nspecific data center requirement for\n\n495\n00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.220\nthe service desk to ITIL capability.\n\n496\n00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.050\nThat's simply false.\n\n497\n00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:57.090\nThe scenario clearly stated\nthat the data center team\n\n498\n00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.770\nhas service desk responsibilities when\nthe service desk goes home at 6 o'clock or\n\n499\n00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.550\nwhenever they go home.\n\n500\n00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.710\nSo users can still call.\n\n501\n00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.080\nIncidents can still be filed or\nforwarded on.\n\n502\n00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.140\nEvents could happen.\n\n503\n00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.400\nA server could fall over.\n\n504\n00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.220\nSomeone's gotta respond to it.\n\n505\n00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.890\nThe data center is responding\nto those types of things\n\n506\n00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.780\nwhen the service desk isn't there.\n\n507\n00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.360\nSo leaving the data center team out\nof the conversation of the tool set\n\n508\n00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.170\nis a non starter right out of the bag.\n\n509\n00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.310\nHopefully that's obvious\nthat a is starting off bad,\n\n510\n00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.920\nI'm gonna stick it away,\nit's not the file answer.\n\n511\n00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.070\nB, the service disk provides covers for\nfull business analysis, so\n\n512\n00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.740\nthere is no specific data center required.\n\n513\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.260\nB starts off with the same bad statement.\n\n514\n00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.320\nA and B are out of here.\n\n515\n00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.330\nSee my logic there?\n\n516\n00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.688\nEliminating A and B.\n\n517\n00:27:45.688 --> 00:27:47.361\nNow C and D are in play.\n\n518\n00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:49.300\nNot even look at A and B for now.\n\n519\n00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.360\nC and D are in play.\n\n520\n00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.320\nStarts off with the data center's main\nrequirement from the service desk software\n\n521\n00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.910\nis to be able to automate\nevent management,\n\n522\n00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.020\nsince often it will relate to\nongoing incident management.\n\n523\n00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:00.520\nTrue enough.\n\n524\n00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.170\nWhich the data center is\nalso accountable for.\n\n525\n00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.930\nIndeed the data center is accountable for\nevent management.\n\n526\n00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.390\nThat's what their accountability is.\n\n527\n00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:13.300\nThat played out in the green\nbits of the scenario.\n\n528\n00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.870\nThat's what they're responsible for.\n\n529\n00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:18.990\nSo integrating event data with\nincident data is a great little\n\n530\n00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.870\nlink up between data center and\nservice desk.\n\n531\n00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.160\nStarting off pretty good.\n\n532\n00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.570\nD starts off with,\nthe data center's main requirement,\n\n533\n00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:30.480\nfrom the service desk software is to be\nable to automate the operational processes\n\n534\n00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.185\nand infrastructure management functions,\n\n535\n00:28:32.185 --> 00:28:34.790\nbecause that's what the data center's\ndoing on a day to day basis.\n\n536\n00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:39.270\nDay to day operations, data center\nfunctions, the physical aspects of things.\n\n537\n00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.360\nSo D's starting off pretty good as well.\n\n538\n00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.250\nSo now C and D need to play out forth.\n\n539\n00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:48.940\nC finishes off with furthermore as the\ndata center team takes the service desk\n\n540\n00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:54.840\ncalls after hours, it will need be support\nthe same requirements as the service desk.\n\n541\n00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.590\nThat is unequivocal, it's putting,\nthey have shared responsibilities,\n\n542\n00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:03.330\nthe data center team needs to be as\neffective in the use of this tool\n\n543\n00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.480\nas the service desk team because\nthey share responsibilities.\n\n544\n00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.920\nIt's not just an extra little add on,\n\n545\n00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.240\nit is one of their responsibilities\nthey need to take care of.\n\n546\n00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.960\nSo C's looking pretty darn good.\n\n547\n00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.100\nThe last statement on D.\n\n548\n00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.820\nSince data center staff provide the\nservice desk after hours, these savings\n\n549\n00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:26.050\ncould be made by offering personnel the\nchance to remain as second line support.\n\n550\n00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.060\nThere by keeping valuable\nyears of experience.\n\n551\n00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.260\nAgain, we're solving a problem\nthat's not asking for.\n\n552\n00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.630\nNot related to the specific question.\n\n553\n00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:38.030\nNot necessarily wrong, but we're\napproaching issues that weren't addressed\n\n554\n00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.530\nby the specific scenarios,\nspecific questions.\n\n555\n00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.318\nAnother red herring,\nnot worth consideration.\n\n556\n00:29:42.318 --> 00:29:44.639\nNot long, just not relevant.\n\n557\n00:29:44.639 --> 00:29:46.271\n&gt;&gt; Elementary my dear Decker.\n\n558\n00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:46.776\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n559\n00:29:46.776 --> 00:29:47.855\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n560\n00:29:47.855 --> 00:29:49.020\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n561\n00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Well that's all we had time for\nright now.\n\n562\n00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.350\nThe question number four,\n\n563\n00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:56.120\nthere will be question number five in\nepisode two, isn't that right sir?\n\n564\n00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.240\n&gt;&gt; Elementary my dear Zack.\n\n565\n00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:03.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, very good, you've been watching\nSample Paper Review ITIL OSA Part 1.\n\n566\n00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.050\nPart 2 is coming up.\n\n567\n00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.060\nThere is a lot in this series.\n\n568\n00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.640\nMake sure you watch every\nsingle one of those episodes.\n\n569\n00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.580\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n570\n00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.950\nYou know, a

00:00:12.180\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.920\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.240\nwatching ITPRO.TV wherec we\nhelp you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.460\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\nwith Sample Paper Review ITIL OAS Part 2,\n\n7\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.085\nand bringing us all that information\nthat we need is Shylock Decker.\n\n8\n00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:32.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you Dr. Watson.\n\n9\n00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so here we are.\n\n10\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.590\nIn part one,\nwe covered questions one through four, and\n\n11\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.450\nnow we got five through eight to cover.\n\n12\n00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.800\nAnd again, as we've done with\nthe other questions, we're not really\n\n13\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.075\nparsing the subject matter directly,\nwe're looking at test taking techniques,\n\n14\n00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:52.905\nhow you parse the question out from\na test maker's perspective, so\n\n15\n00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:54.875\nyou can be a better test taker.\n\n16\n00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:56.975\nSo let's have a look, at question five,\nlook at the graphic here.\n\n17\n00:00:58.095 --> 00:00:59.712\nAgain, as we've done before,\n\n18\n00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:03.852\nwe're gonna break down the scenario\ninto it's business facing bits,\n\n19\n00:01:03.852 --> 00:01:08.362\nit's IT service provider facing bits,\nand what are we asking directly?\n\n20\n00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:10.192\nWhat are the specific deficiencies?\n\n21\n00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:13.086\nOr what are the specific\nactions being requested?\n\n22\n00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:16.416\nYou don't wanna answer questions\nthat aren't being asked, right?\n\n23\n00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:18.916\nYou wanna be sure you face\nthe problems as they're presented.\n\n24\n00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:21.836\nIn this particular case\nthe question itself says,\n\n25\n00:01:21.836 --> 00:01:24.466\nwhich one of the following\napproaches is best for\n\n26\n00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:28.320\nimplementing a new tool that addresses\nthe needs of this organization?\n\n27\n00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.770\nSo, we're in tool selection mode.\n\n28\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.800\nWhat's going to satisfy these\nparticular requirements?\n\n29\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.280\nSo you're going to bring your\nsubject matter awareness to this.\n\n30\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.460\nYou're looking for\nan 80% match on the must have,\n\n31\n00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.350\nI'm sorry, on all of the requirements.\n\n32\n00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.645\nYou're looking at 100%\nmatch on must haves.\n\n33\n00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:48.060\nSo as you are looking at the requirements\nof specific ask, you're gonna be looking\n\n34\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540\nfor that new asks as you read\nthe question and read the scenarios.\n\n35\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.450\nSo let's have a look,\nin this empirical case,\n\n36\n00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.890\nyou see management has made it\nclear that whichever tools selected\n\n37\n00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.750\nit must enable process integration and\nautomation capabilities.\n\n38\n00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.710\nSo we gotta have an integration\nacross multiple processes, all right?\n\n39\n00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.540\nAnd automation needs to be addressed,\nright?\n\n40\n00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.670\nImplementation of a CMS,\n\n41\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.390\na Configuration Management System,\nmust be part of the tool set.\n\n42\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.380\nAgain, these are musts, right?\n\n43\n00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.890\nAnd it also must allow for\nself help systems.\n\n44\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.070\nSo as you can automate some of\nthe interface between the users\n\n45\n00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.230\nperhaps in the service test.\n\n46\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.450\nLet them go help themselves to ordering\nthat headset or getting a new battery for\n\n47\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.130\nthe laptop.\n\n48\n00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.380\nThat sort of thing, right?\n\n49\n00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.010\nYou've been asked to lead,\nlook at the last sentence.\n\n50\n00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.850\nYou've been asked to lead the IT\nservice management program, right?\n\n51\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.550\nNot a trivial matter.\n\n52\n00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.380\nDuring a staff meeting with\nservice operation managers,\n\n53\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.640\nyou were asked to recommend the best\nway to proceed with selecting a tool.\n\n54\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.670\nHow are you gonna pick an IT\nservice management tool set?\n\n55\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.710\nThat is the operative question here.\n\n56\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.110\nThere was a specific lecture on this in\nthe episodes above for this topic in OSA.\n\n57\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.310\nAnd here, again,\nI'm not diving into the subject matter,\n\n58\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.820\njust looking at the way you can\napproach the questions themselves.\n\n59\n00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.930\nSo to do this, again,\nthe same compare and contract method,\n\n60\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.540\nlooking at the answers and\ncomparing the bullet statements.\n\n61\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.540\nFrom A across to D, I'll do this once.\n\n62\n00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.440\nSo A says, to gain buy-in, examine the\nexisting commercially developed system and\n\n63\n00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.616\ndetermine if it can support existing\nprocedures enterprise wide.\n\n64\n00:03:26.616 --> 00:03:31.370\nTo gain buy-in examine the existing\ncommercially developed system and\n\n65\n00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.600\ndetermine if they could support\nexisting procedures enterprise wide.\n\n66\n00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.380\nLet's compare that to some others.\n\n67\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.220\nRaising our SC,\n\n68\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.820\nwe're already jumping to a change here\nas if you know where you're going.\n\n69\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.660\nYou need to look before you leap.\n\n70\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.120\nAnd in this case, the first\nsuggestion to B is let's go ahead and\n\n71\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.560\nput in that request for change in.\n\n72\n00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.920\nA little premature.\n\n73\n00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.040\nThis one's kind of smelling a little bit.\n\n74\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.020\nC says, establish a project.\n\n75\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.720\nIt's gonna be a project scope.\n\n76\n00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.470\nThis is not a trivial matter,\nso that sounds pretty good.\n\n77\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.110\nRaise an RFC for the new system and\nbegin promoting awareness of the project.\n\n78\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.260\nAll right, so instead of just managing\nthis through the RFC process,\n\n79\n00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.480\nwe need to establish a project to\nguide this thing appropriately.\n\n80\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.290\nIt's not a trivial matter implementing\nan ITSM suite of tools, not at all, right?\n\n81\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.250\nIt's a major change.\n\n82\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.200\nD starts off with the same thing.\n\n83\n00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.222\nRaise an RFC and schedule a change for\nthe next holiday weekend.\n\n84\n00:04:30.222 --> 00:04:31.940\nAs if it's a trivial matter,\n\n85\n00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.735\nwe can knock this IT service\nmanagement suite out over a weekend.\n\n86\n00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:39.094\nAgain, kind of understating\njust how intrusive and\n\n87\n00:04:39.094 --> 00:04:42.310\nimpactful an IT service\nmanagement suite can be.\n\n88\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.610\nSo, D is kind of suspect,\n\n89\n00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.150\nB is kind of suspect because it doesn't\nhave the project scope in line?\n\n90\n00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.590\nC is emerging so\nfar to be a good candidate.\n\n91\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.030\nLet's see if there's anything else\ndisqualifying about the other answers.\n\n92\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.330\nAgain, as you go through, you just look\nat the bullets and say, is this relevant?\n\n93\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.300\nIs it accurate?\n\n94\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.040\nDoes it solve this particular problem?\n\n95\n00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.640\nThat's what you do each time.\n\n96\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.040\nAs you look at these different answers,\n\n97\n00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.030\nit was pretty obvious that C becomes\nthe best answer for tool selection.\n\n98\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.800\n&gt;&gt; So in this case you're really\nnot shooting for extra credit,\n\n99\n00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.780\nyou're not trying to impress\nthe giver of the test.\n\n100\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.520\nYou need to address it right away,\nright on top.\n\n101\n00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, good call, good call Zach,\nthat's absolutely right, right.\n\n102\n00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.772\nSo again the approach is to\ndissect compare and contrast.\n\n103\n00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:34.991\nYou obviously have to bring your\nsubject matter expertise here.\n\n104\n00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:39.979\nI'm not saying that you can blindly take\nan exam you have to know some things,\n\n105\n00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:40.839\nclearly do.\n\n106\n00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.175\nAnd if you're a little\nfuzzy on tool selection and\n\n107\n00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:45.792\nthe importance of IT service\nmanagement integration,\n\n108\n00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:50.510\nif you're kind of confused about that this\ntest question can actually help you there.\n\n109\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.850\nIt can give you a little bit more\ngrits to chew on if you will.\n\n110\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.450\nAnd if you go to the answers and\n\n111\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.330\nrationale you can actually take on new\nlearning from this experience, and\n\n112\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.180\nnot just feel like you're testing\nyourself that sort of thing.\n\n113\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.610\nAll right,\nlet's have a look at question six.\n\n114\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.390\n&gt;&gt; Good information.\n\n115\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.820\n&gt;&gt; Good, question six.\n\n116\n00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.120\nAgain, the specific ask\nis in the red text.\n\n117\n00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.890\nYou know, looking for\n\n118\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.960\nthe context, this particular question had\nnothing really related to the business.\n\n119\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.980\nIn this particular case, right?\n\n120\n00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.320\nIn this particular case you\nare the IT expert hired to help with\n\n121\n00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.720\nthe improvement effort.\n\n122\n00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.430\nImprovement of what?\n\n123\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.030\nWe'll have to look at the scenario.\n\n124\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.110\nBased on the issues identified\nin the scenario, what issues?\n\n125\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.470\nThe ones in the scenario.\n\n126\n00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.060\nWhich one of the following recommendations\nbest addresses the improvement needs\n\n127\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.710\nat this point in time?\n\n128\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.920\nSo improvement is the goal.\n\n129\n00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.370\nImprovement is the goal.\n\n130\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.150\nWhat's broken that needs to be improved?\n\n131\n00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.110\nIs that explicitly named in the scenario?\n\n132\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.030\nTurns out it is.\n\n133\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.460\nThe IT department is currently\norganized into application and\n\n134\n00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.640\ntechnical management silos.\n\n135\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.700\nApplication management, the silo suggests\nthat they don't work together well.\n\n136\n00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.680\nSo there's one improvement, how we're\ngonna get these cross synergies built in\n\n137\n00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.680\nto these two separate functions\nwith little interactions.\n\n138\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.310\nSo that's one particular deficiency.\n\n139\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.134\nAs you read the baseline assessment,\nnew systems are being commissioned but\n\n140\n00:07:11.134 --> 00:07:12.880\nwithout adequate training.\n\n141\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.130\nTraining is bad.\n\n142\n00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.090\nSome senior technical staff\nare performing entry-level talks.\n\n143\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.130\nWhile expensive contractors who lack the\nbusiness knowledge are hired to work on\n\n144\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.450\nthe design of technical architecture and\nperformance standards for new services.\n\n145\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.130\nSo a lack of business awareness,\nit suggests here.\n\n146\n00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.400\nWe got expensive contractors\nwho lack business knowledge\n\n147\n00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.380\ncoming working on the strategic ideas.\n\n148\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.190\nIs that something we need to work on.\n\n149\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.750\nApplication area codes\nare not always traceable.\n\n150\n00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.500\nSystem and\nuser documentation is out of date.\n\n151\n00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.600\nIneffective performance and\nunavailability reporting due to bad data.\n\n152\n00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.540\nThere is confusion within IT\nregarding who's responsible for\n\n153\n00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.459\nmanaging technical workers.\n\n154\n00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.427\nIs this dysfunctional?\n\n155\n00:07:55.427 --> 00:07:57.516\nIs this highlighting a large area?\n\n156\n00:07:57.516 --> 00:07:59.500\nSeems to be broken just about everywhere.\n\n157\n00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.728\nWe can't measure We don't have the right\npeople aligned with the right task.\n\n158\n00:08:04.728 --> 00:08:08.500\nWe're spending money on people that\ndon't know our business, right?\n\n159\n00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.350\nSo there's a wide swath of dysfunction,\nif you will.\n\n160\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.040\nWhen it's so wide, maybe\nthe improvement ideas has step back and\n\n161\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.620\nlook broadly, right?\n\n162\n00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.522\nNow, we've got a face on these issues.\n\n163\n00:08:21.522 --> 00:08:25.678\nAnd it says, based on these issues,\nidentified, which of the following\n\n164\n00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:30.050\nrecommendation best addresses the\nimprovement needs at this point in time?\n\n165\n00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.050\nSo we're not gonna solve\nall these questions easily.\n\n166\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.450\nThere's some systemic issues, some\nculture issues working out here as well.\n\n167\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.270\nThat's how I'm reading this\nas I go through here, right?\n\n168\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.192\nIn addition to this dysfunction,\n\n169\n00:08:44.192 --> 00:08:47.839\nthat dysfunction is resulting in\na recent customer satisfaction\n\n170\n00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:52.562\nsurvey highlighted similar training\nerrors and documentation-related issues.\n\n171\n00:08:52.562 --> 00:08:54.920\nSo we've got some issues\nwith our documents as well.\n\n172\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.610\nAs a result of this initial assessment,\nmanagement decided that an improvement\n\n173\n00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.820\nprogram, it's not a little thing,\na program is bigger then a project.\n\n174\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.830\nAn improvement program is to be launched\nto streamline its IT operations.\n\n175\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.343\nAgain, not a trivial matter here.\n\n176\n00:09:09.343 --> 00:09:14.320\nWe're looking at a big idea here,\nnot small one, not incremental.\n\n177\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.670\nWe're talking about transformation now.\n\n178\n00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:21.730\nWe need to reduce cost and\nimprove IT resource allocation, right?\n\n179\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.960\nSo this is a big picture kind of question.\n\n180\n00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.440\nWe're looking at lots of dysfunction,\nand we're looking at it broadly.\n\n181\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.010\nWe got general dissatisfaction\nacross the business, and\n\n182\n00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.070\nwe want a program to approach\nthe opportunity to improve.\n\n183\n00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.037\nSomething big, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:38.037 --> 00:09:39.730\nSo you see how I assess the scenario?\n\n185\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.220\nIt's big, not small, not incremental.\n\n186\n00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.100\nWe're talking about transformation here.\n\n187\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.670\nAnd we talk about transformation,\n\n188\n00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:51.290\nyou're talking about something a little\nbit more broadly and big, not small.\n\n189\n00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.116\nSo how does this play out?\n\n190\n00:09:52.116 --> 00:09:53.102\n&gt;&gt; Action-oriented, too.\n\n191\n00:09:53.102 --> 00:09:56.260\n&gt;&gt; And action-oriented, for\nsure, very specific, right.\n\n192\n00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:56.940\nSo what do we know?\n\n193\n00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.316\nOne of the things we pointed out is\nthat there was lack of good measurement,\n\n194\n00:09:59.316 --> 00:10:00.119\ngood metrics involved.\n\n195\n00:10:00.119 --> 00:10:03.700\nSo let's see if that plays in as well.\n\n196\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.160\nAgain, comparing and\ncontrasting as we go across.\n\n197\n00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.990\nAs an example, A starts off with, ensure\nthat technical and application management\n\n198\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.830\nstaff are responsible for\nmaintaining their system of documentation.\n\n199\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.090\nGive them ownership.\n\n200\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.540\nIs there something that\ncoincides with that?\n\n201\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.810\nB starts off with, ensure that IT\noperations resources are actively involved\n\n202\n00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.840\nin the definition of problem\nclassification and coding, and\n\n203\n00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.000\nin the validation and\nmaintenance of the known error database.\n\n204\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.840\nNow, this is a very specific ask.\n\n205\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.975\nWe talked about broad issues and\nbroad problems.\n\n206\n00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:39.710\nWhen we talked about the symptoms,\n\n207\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:45.150\nwe talked about a transformation\nprogram to bring this under control.\n\n208\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.640\nDiving into a known error database for\nincident and\n\n209\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.830\nproblem management is probably getting\ndown into the weeds a little bit and\n\n210\n00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.380\nnot staying it on top of the big picture.\n\n211\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.620\nI suggest B is a little bit suspect.\n\n212\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.340\nObviously, I do.\n\n213\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.056\nI've already written it in red here,\nright?\n\n214\n00:10:58.056 --> 00:11:02.973\nBut it's suspect because it's down in\nthe weeds, not directly to scenario.\n\n215\n00:11:02.973 --> 00:11:07.383\nAnd also, down on the weeds is not\ndirected to the real challenge here and\n\n216\n00:11:07.383 --> 00:11:09.350\nimprovement program, right?\n\n217\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.980\nC, restructure the IT organizational\n\n218\n00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.530\ntechnical resource based\non their skill set.\n\n219\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.398\nNow, that was a specific asking, or\n\n220\n00:11:18.398 --> 00:11:22.329\nspecific issue that you've got the wrong\npeople working on the wrong thing.\n\n221\n00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:25.895\nSo consider restructuring of\nthe IT organization's technical\n\n222\n00:11:25.895 --> 00:11:30.940\nresources based on their true skill set in\norder to optimize resource utilization.\n\n223\n00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.500\nThat sounds like a big picture approach,\nright?\n\n224\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.420\nWe're not talking about tweaking a process\nrelated to the ordinary database.\n\n225\n00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.790\nAgain, moving across,\njust first bullet at a time.\n\n226\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.410\nD starts off with, ensure that technical\nand application management staff\n\n227\n00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.600\nare responsible for\nmaintaining system documentation.\n\n228\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.685\nNot wrong,\nit's consistent with what A says.\n\n229\n00:11:48.685 --> 00:11:52.560\nSo A, C, and D are all in play, all right?\n\n230\n00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.560\nI'm smelling out a rat and\nanswer B, all right?\n\n231\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.791\nThe second bullet then,\ndoes that give us any more meat?\n\n232\n00:11:59.791 --> 00:12:02.048\nI'm leaving out B now going\nto the second bullet.\n\n233\n00:12:02.048 --> 00:12:06.623\nDocument escalation pass to ensure that\nfailure is detected by technical or\n\n234\n00:12:06.623 --> 00:12:11.269\napplication management functions\nare escalated to IT operations in a timely\n\n235\n00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:13.425\nmanner for resolution.\n\n236\n00:12:13.425 --> 00:12:17.640\nThere's a misnomer there,\nescalating to IT operations.\n\n237\n00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.548\nIT operations is the point of entry.\n\n238\n00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:21.534\nIt's the day-to-day operations.\n\n239\n00:12:21.534 --> 00:12:25.940\nSo it's not a point of\nescalation to IT operations.\n\n240\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.470\nSo that's kind of a mis-starter,\na misnomer, or\n\n241\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.660\na mischaracterization of what\nIT operations is really about.\n\n242\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.800\nIt's always on the ground.\n\n243\n00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.620\nIt's the point of entry, right?\n\n244\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.560\nIt's also the point of resolution.\n\n245\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.607\nI'm not saying it's not, but\nit's not a point of escalation,\n\n246\n00:12:39.607 --> 00:12:41.027\nit's a point of management.\n\n247\n00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:43.860\nSo red hair in there.\n\n248\n00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.810\nTechnical management and\n\n249\n00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:49.220\napplication management are the functions\nthat have a little bit higher value in\n\n250\n00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:54.130\nterms of strategic thinking, tactical\nthinking, and not day-to-day responses.\n\n251\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:59.170\nSo if there's any escalation,\nit's probably coming from operations up to\n\n252\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.740\ntechnical management application\nmanagement, not the other way around.\n\n253\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.730\nSo A is suspect on that\nparticular one again.\n\n254\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:10.678\nI applied my knowledge of the functions\nto make that happen, so it's not absence\n\n255\n00:13:10.678 --> 00:13:14.773\nof subject matter expertise that's\ngonna help you succeed here.\n\n256\n00:13:14.773 --> 00:13:16.980\nYou're gonna have to\nhave that as you come.\n\n257\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.660\nBut again, compare and\ncontrast is making this play out.\n\n258\n00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.280\nSo now, I've eliminated A.\n\n259\n00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.710\nI got B out of the hat.\n\n260\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.230\nLet's now focus on C and D.\n\n261\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.090\nThe second bullet in D says\nensure that technical management\n\n262\n00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.810\nresources are actually involved in\nthe definition of problem classifications,\n\n263\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.080\ncoding, and in the validation and\nmaintenance of the KEDB.\n\n264\n00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.800\nNow, again, this is mischaracterizing\nthe four functions.\n\n265\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.350\nTechnical management and application\nmanagement are those functions that\n\n266\n00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:51.670\ncontain the skill sets that go deep and\nwide into the areas of specialty.\n\n267\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.160\nTechnical management knows everything\nthere is to know about infrastructure.\n\n268\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.150\nApplication management knows everything\nyou need to know about applications.\n\n269\n00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.656\nAnd they show up at strategic meetings,\nand design meetings, and\n\n270\n00:14:01.656 --> 00:14:02.913\ntransition meetings.\n\n271\n00:14:02.913 --> 00:14:05.220\nThey don't just operate in operations.\n\n272\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.160\nSo to get technical management and\n\n273\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.270\napplication management into\nthe weeds of the database is\n\n274\n00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:17.020\na mischaracterization of what those\nfunctions provide in the skill set.\n\n275\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.730\nThat's something operations needs\nto do on a day-to-day basis.\n\n276\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.400\nSo IT operations, as a function,\nis responsible for\n\n277\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.530\nthe day-to-day, not technical\nmanagement and application management.\n\n278\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.920\nSo D is now smelling.\n\n279\n00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.700\nObviously, the subject matter expertise\nyou needed to have coming to this was\n\n280\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.630\nan understanding of what\nthe four functions do and\n\n281\n00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.410\nhow they are placed in\ncontrast with each other.\n\n282\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.870\nD missed that boat.\n\n283\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.610\n&gt;&gt; It missed the boat to Island.\n\n284\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.660\n&gt;&gt; Good point,\nit missed the boat right to Island.\n\n285\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.670\nAll right, moving through here now.\n\n286\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.240\nWe've got Question 7.\n\n287\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.227\nThis is interesting in that\nyou see no red, all right?\n\n288\n00:14:56.227 --> 00:14:59.875\nMaybe that's because it was\npretty straightforward here.\n\n289\n00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:02.935\nTo ensure the process\nis followed correctly,\n\n290\n00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:07.095\nthe service desk manager wants the list,\nnot only to be in the correct sequence but\n\n291\n00:15:07.095 --> 00:15:11.465\nalso have an accurate description for\neach of the steps, right?\n\n292\n00:15:11.465 --> 00:15:13.905\nSo we see the four steps.\n\n293\n00:15:13.905 --> 00:15:17.870\nWe're evaluating whether these four\nsteps are appropriately ordered and\n\n294\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.190\ndescribed the right things.\n\n295\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.640\nSo that's really what the ask is here.\n\n296\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.798\nThey ask is in the question,\nthe rest of it is just the data, right?\n\n297\n00:15:25.798 --> 00:15:28.477\nSo when at this particular scenario,\n\n298\n00:15:28.477 --> 00:15:34.190\nthe IT service management tool suit within\na small IT organization is currently down.\n\n299\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.040\nSo you can't use your good tool set.\n\n300\n00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.032\nWhile the response team\nworks on restoring service,\n\n301\n00:15:40.032 --> 00:15:44.570\nthe service test manager has a slowly\ngrowing list of service requests.\n\n302\n00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.558\nSo requests are coming in, and\nyour suite of tools is down.\n\n303\n00:15:48.558 --> 00:15:53.300\nThe following request had been logged,\ncategorized, and prioritized, right?\n\n304\n00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.261\nWithout the tool to drive the process\nThe service desk manager needs to\n\n305\n00:15:57.261 --> 00:16:02.170\nprocess requests within the parameters\nof the request fulfillment process.\n\n306\n00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.760\nThe list will need to be extended\nto record the subsequent steps.\n\n307\n00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.710\nWhat are gonna be the subsequent steps?\n\n308\n00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.530\nAll right, let's have a look.\n\n309\n00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.039\nThe steps to request fulfillment\ninclude authorization.\n\n310\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.190\nNot just what is being requested,\nbut who's authorized it?\n\n311\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.010\nSo, starting with A is a good start.\n\n312\n00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.350\nAuthorization is in.\n\n313\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:28.140\nNotice that authorization\nstarts all four answers, right?\n\n314\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.710\nAuthorize, authorization, no work should\ntake place to fulfill any of the requests\n\n315\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.680\nuntil they've been properly authorized.\n\n316\n00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.660\nThis is an ITIL best practice,\nrequest or authorize.\n\n317\n00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.370\nLet's say you're requesting a new iPad,\nyou know the tool set's down,\n\n318\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.830\nI'm gonna request five.\n\n319\n00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.880\nIt's Christmas time, I got my kids to\nthink of, I'm gonna call the service desk.\n\n320\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.537\nI need five iPads, and we're gonna\nbypass the whole authorization step.\n\n321\n00:16:50.537 --> 00:16:51.225\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n322\n00:16:51.225 --> 00:16:52.610\nRequests need to be authorized.\n\n323\n00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.920\nNow, so, A is starting off pretty good,\nB comes in with authorization and\n\n324\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.110\nsays fulfill a service request or\na preauthorized request.\n\n325\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.120\nThat's just not true, right?\n\n326\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:10.740\nPreauthorization for service request\nis kind of a misnomer, right?\n\n327\n00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.970\nThey are authorized by process,\nthey are authorized or not, right?\n\n328\n00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.610\nI'm moving over\nthe authorization step in C.\n\n329\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:22.210\nAuthorization, no work should take place\nto fulfill any of the requests until they\n\n330\n00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.832\nhave been properly authorized,\nstarting off the same way, all right,\n\n331\n00:17:25.832 --> 00:17:27.000\nwhich is good.\n\n332\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.493\nA and C are in place so far,\nand then D says authorization,\n\n333\n00:17:31.493 --> 00:17:37.303\nfulflil the request if the requesters\nare authorized to make the request.\n\n334\n00:17:37.303 --> 00:17:39.400\nThat's just not the way\nauthorization works.\n\n335\n00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.840\nI might be authorized to request an iPad.\n\n336\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.818\nBut I'm not authorized\nto approve the iPad.\n\n337\n00:17:45.818 --> 00:17:48.575\nRequesters aren't authorized to, I mean,\n\n338\n00:17:48.575 --> 00:17:52.210\nthey're giving the ability\nto request something, sure.\n\n339\n00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.640\nBut they're not given the ability\nto fulfill, right, or\n\n340\n00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.940\nto authorize the fulfillment.\n\n341\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.410\nSo D has got it kind of backwards.\n\n342\n00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.590\nIt's not the requester that's authorized,\n\n343\n00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.470\nsomeone else authorizes the request,\nall right.\n\n344\n00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.500\nSo continuing on with A,\nso I got A and C in play.\n\n345\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.100\nThe second sentence in A says service\nrequest that cannot be properly authorized\n\n346\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.980\nshould be closed and\nreturned to the requester.\n\n347\n00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.720\nNow the problem with closure is\nwhat if authorization comes later,\n\n348\n00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.700\ndo you have to open up a new request?\n\n349\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.500\nAnd that's not very friendly for\nthe end user.\n\n350\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.500\nSo look how C treats that, right?\n\n351\n00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.940\nService requests that cannot be properly\nauthorized should be updated and\n\n352\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.639\nreturned to the requester.\n\n353\n00:18:36.639 --> 00:18:38.865\nRight, say hey,\nwe don't have the authorization yet.\n\n354\n00:18:38.865 --> 00:18:41.490\nGet that approved, right?\n\n355\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.300\nTalk to your manager.\n\n356\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.530\nThey said no.\n\n357\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.320\nTalk to your manager, so they'll say yes,\nand then we'll go ahead and\n\n358\n00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.580\nprogress with this thing.\n\n359\n00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.298\nSo you don't have to start back at the\nvery first step, and you progress this on.\n\n360\n00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:55.010\nSo C is smelling a little bit better\non that subtle little difference\n\n361\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:59.080\nabout do you close it,\nor do you update it?\n\n362\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.450\nSubtle, right?\n\n363\n00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.050\nNow again, let's say you\ndidn't catch that one, right?\n\n364\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.706\nThat's a pretty subtle\ndifferent between A and C.\n\n365\n00:19:05.706 --> 00:19:11.260\nIs there something else about A or C that\nmakes it smell a little worse, right?\n\n366\n00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.060\nSo now you're gonna review.\n\n367\n00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.470\nDetermine the proper function\nto fill the request.\n\n368\n00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.170\nC is totally equal to that.\n\n369\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.980\nOn the execution part, A says\nthe appropriate request model should be\n\n370\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.500\nchosen for each of the requests, based\non the type of request being fulfilled.\n\n371\n00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.600\nStarts off the same on C, the process\nsteps and activities indicated in\n\n372\n00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.739\nthe model are then executed by\nthe function to fulfill the request.\n\n373\n00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.710\nRight, same thing again.\n\n374\n00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.320\nThe process steps and activities indicated\nin the model are then executed by\n\n375\n00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.470\nthe function to fulfill the request,\ntotally fine there, right?\n\n376\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:48.030\nSo then, we have the closure piece,\nis that a distinguishing characteristic?\n\n377\n00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:53.330\nService desk checks that the request had\nbeen fulfilled and closes the request.\n\n378\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:58.100\nThe subtle difference on C is service desk\nchecks that the request had been fulfilled\n\n379\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.480\nand verifies it with the user.\n\n380\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.320\nThat one little final sign off, are you\nsatisfied that you got your iPad on time,\n\n381\n00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.420\netc., getting the feedback, and\nthen you can close it down.\n\n382\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.026\nSubtleties there,\nC's got the better subtleties in there.\n\n383\n00:20:13.026 --> 00:20:15.466\nAnd again,\nthrough the compare and contrast,\n\n384\n00:20:15.466 --> 00:20:19.127\nerr on the side of better service,\nand that's what C does in this case.\n\n385\n00:20:19.127 --> 00:20:24.055\n&gt;&gt; Well, C is addressing the customer\ncomponent of the customer service value\n\n386\n00:20:24.055 --> 00:20:25.764\nmore adroitly, I think.\n\n387\n00:20:25.764 --> 00:20:29.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, more clearly and\nsuccinctly, I totally agree, good.\n\n388\n00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.050\nLast but not least, question eight,\n\n389\n00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.280\nthis one deals with which one of\nthe following sequences of activities best\n\n390\n00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.230\ndescribes what this organization should\ndo in support of the business goals?\n\n391\n00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.080\nObviously, that's so generic, we gotta go\nlook and see what the business goals are.\n\n392\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.736\nSo here's the business context,\nit's pretty darn relevant, right?\n\n393\n00:20:50.736 --> 00:20:54.370\nA computer games retailer has set a very\naggressive business growth, all right.\n\n394\n00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.048\nSo they gotta be aggressive.\n\n395\n00:20:56.048 --> 00:20:59.050\nThe growth has been achieved by\nopening many new outlets, and\n\n396\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.230\nmost significantly, by purchasing\nthree other companies, right?\n\n397\n00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:06.270\nIt also has expanded it\nto head office premises,\n\n398\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.530\nwhere a number of administrative and\nsupport services will be centralized.\n\n399\n00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.676\nSo the business is consolidating and\ngrowing, right?\n\n400\n00:21:13.676 --> 00:21:17.200\nThe IT department needs to respond\nto that effectively, right?\n\n401\n00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.070\nThe systems that the original company used\nwere basic and were not manager supported\n\n402\n00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.450\nby clearly defined processes,\nsomewhat immaturity there, right?\n\n403\n00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.210\nThe three new companies are similar,\nalthough one specializes in Internet\n\n404\n00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.970\nsales, which have now become a significant\npart of the overall business revenue.\n\n405\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:38.600\nSo we got a cash cow over here bringing\nin significant money, which is good,\n\n406\n00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.000\nanother business factor, and\nInternet sales are a big part of it.\n\n407\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.550\nIs IT directly related to\nthe success of Internet sales?\n\n408\n00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.730\nObviously, a pretty clear\ndistinction there, right?\n\n409\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.620\nNow you look at the things,\nnow the specific ask,\n\n410\n00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.000\nan external assessment has concluded,\nI'm reading the last paragraph here.\n\n411\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.599\nAn external assessment has concluded that\nthe current incident management process of\n\n412\n00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:01.936\nthe original company is lacking maturity.\n\n413\n00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:06.255\nAnd that a good starting point would be\nto review the service desk function and\n\n414\n00:22:06.255 --> 00:22:08.920\nensure commonality\nacross the organization.\n\n415\n00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.090\nReviewing the service desk,\nyou've got four companies coming together.\n\n416\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.657\nYou had the original, and they purchased\nthree, I believe, is what it was, right?\n\n417\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.790\nDespair processes, lack of processes,\nand the assessment is shown,\n\n418\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.280\nlet's start with incident management and\nthe service desk.\n\n419\n00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.680\nIncident management is a process,\n\n420\n00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.900\nthe service desk is a function\nthat practices that process.\n\n421\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.660\nLet's put them together and move forward.\n\n422\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.990\nSo in this case, the scenarios pointed\nyou to a very specific point of entry\n\n423\n00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.620\nof consideration, that is incident\nmanagement and service desk.\n\n424\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.165\nSo which one of those?\n\n425\n00:22:44.165 --> 00:22:47.400\nYou've got a green field in incident\nmanagement and service desk.\n\n426\n00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.810\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\n427\n00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.920\nCompare and contrast again.\n\n428\n00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.910\nCentralizing the service\ndesk is not a bad idea.\n\n429\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:23:00.320\nITIL has a very strong previous\nposition to a single service desk.\n\n430\n00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.540\nYou can get scale, centralizing,\nyou also get consistency of service.\n\n431\n00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.970\nNow that's not saying that local\nservice desks are always evil.\n\n432\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.640\nIn this particular scenario,\nif you're trying to consolidate and\n\n433\n00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.540\nharmonize across many\ndisparate organizations,\n\n434\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.570\ncentralization is a good way to do that,\nright?\n\n435\n00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.350\nSo you're looking for\ncentralization, right?\n\n436\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:27.400\nHere, it says centralize the service desk\nin the head office and train staff, right?\n\n437\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.500\nCentralize service desk\nin the head office.\n\n438\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.650\nImplement a centralized service desk in\nthe head office with local service desk,\n\n439\n00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.940\nis what C is saying.\n\n440\n00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.730\nAnd then finally, centralize\nthe service desk in the head office.\n\n441\n00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.410\nSo where's it gonna go, okay?\n\n442\n00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.104\nSo doing the compare and\ncontrast, the second bullet,\n\n443\n00:23:42.104 --> 00:23:43.836\nimplement a new service desk tool.\n\n444\n00:23:43.836 --> 00:23:50.080\nHm, We haven't talked\nabout the process yet.\n\n445\n00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.090\nKey red flag here, process leads tools,\nnot the other way around.\n\n446\n00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.810\nAnswer A jumps to a tool set.\n\n447\n00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.447\nWe haven't done a process review,\n\n448\n00:24:00.447 --> 00:24:04.170\nwe haven't brought about our\nincident management process yet.\n\n449\n00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.800\nProcess precedes tools, right?\n\n450\n00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.590\nSo don't go jump to a tool.\n\n451\n00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.560\nA is starting to smell a little bit,\nbecause they got that basic tenet,\n\n452\n00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.700\nthat basic principle regarding tool\nselection is the process comes first.\n\n453\n00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.540\nA, kicking it aside right now for\na glaring error.\n\n454\n00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.317\nSo again, I have the luxury of having\nstudied this exam, studied ITIL for\n\n455\n00:24:28.317 --> 00:24:33.290\nyears, so my subject matter expertise\nquickly allowed me to get rid of A.\n\n456\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.450\nWould your subject matter\nexpertise have gotten you there?\n\n457\n00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.600\nHere's the beauty of taking\nthese sample papers.\n\n458\n00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:44.320\nWhether you memorized the nugget\nthat process precedes tools,\n\n459\n00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.290\nyou now have a point of reference, and\na sample paper exam, that reminds you,\n\n460\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.470\nin no uncertain terms,\nprocess precedes tools.\n\n461\n00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.490\nAnother great example of how\nthe sample papers themselves\n\n462\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.040\ngive you an opportunity for\nreinforced learning, or\n\n463\n00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.580\nperhaps even new learning as you get\ninside the head of a test maker.\n\n464\n00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, here again,\nit was like the cart before the horse.\n\n465\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.530\nIf you did that, the other way around.\n\n466\n00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.380\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n467\n00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.230\n&gt;&gt; And again doing compare and\ncontrast gets you an opportunity.\n\n468\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.060\nSo this one put the toolset early in A.\n\n469\n00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.030\nIs there another answer that\nputs the toolset later?\n\n470\n00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.360\nWell, you can see as D plays out,\n\n471\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.160\njust I'm jumping in there cuz\nI know it's the right answer.\n\n472\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.450\nActually B has it here.\n\n473\n00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:27.250\nAssess the incident management process and\nservice desk function.\n\n474\n00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:27.800\nYou know what?\n\n475\n00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.830\nThat's exactly what\nthe question asked for.\n\n476\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so it's a direct lineup.\n\n477\n00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:32.709\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n\n478\n00:25:32.709 --> 00:25:34.425\n&gt;&gt; Right, don't jump to the tool.\n\n479\n00:25:34.425 --> 00:25:35.545\nAssess the process.\n\n480\n00:25:35.545 --> 00:25:37.935\nSo sometimes it's just that easy.\n\n481\n00:25:37.935 --> 00:25:39.305\nAnswer the question.\n\n482\n00:25:39.305 --> 00:25:41.065\nDon't think about what\nyou're doing at work.\n\n483\n00:25:41.065 --> 00:25:43.226\nDon't solve the ultimate end game problem,\nright?\n\n484\n00:25:43.226 --> 00:25:45.493\nYou may think, well, I gotta have\na process, I gotta have a tool,\n\n485\n00:25:45.493 --> 00:25:47.085\ngotta have a tool,\ngotta have a tool, right?\n\n486\n00:25:47.085 --> 00:25:47.915\nYou go over here.\n\n487\n00:25:47.915 --> 00:25:49.525\nIt's like a squirrel.\n\n488\n00:25:49.525 --> 00:25:50.885\n&gt;&gt; That's like the guy shooting for\n\n489\n00:25:50.885 --> 00:25:54.040\nthe extra credit by putting in filler\nthat's not needed in the last one.\n\n490\n00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.370\n&gt;&gt; Good point, good point, yeah.\n\n491\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:56.948\nSo again,\n\n492\n00:25:56.948 --> 00:26:01.260\nthe sample papers give you excellent\nopportunity to reinforce learning.\n\n493\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.800\nPerhaps even gain some new learning,\nbut certainly shows you the test makers\n\n494\n00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.320\nhave focused on some major\nnuggets of contention.\n\n495\n00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.330\nIn this particular case,\n\n496\n00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:14.290\none of the nuggets of contention is the\nprocess is supposed to follow the tool.\n\n497\n00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.350\nI'm sorry, precede the tool.\n\n498\n00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.180\nThe tool follows the process.\n\n499\n00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:23.090\nAnd by golly, that's exactly what happens\nin D, and that's the right answer, right?\n\n500\n00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.310\nSo whether you knew that\ncoming into this question,\n\n501\n00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.520\nyou have an opportunity to\nreview this question and\n\n502\n00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.390\nregain that nugget of important\nknowledge for your success on the exam.\n\n503\n00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:36.140\nSo that's all I got for\nthe sample paper reviews themselves.\n\n504\n00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.550\nJust to tidy up a little bit,\nas you go forward, remember,\n\n505\n00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.080\nthere's another sample paper out there.\n\n506\n00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.590\nThis was sample paper one.\n\n507\n00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.590\nThere's a sample paper two.\n\n508\n00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.590\nYou can also retake sample paper one and\nresample paper two.\n\n509\n00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:49.580\nThey're still good.\n\n510\n00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.230\nEven though you might\neven know the answers,\n\n511\n00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.380\nbecause it's not fresh in your mind,\ngo to the rationales.\n\n512\n00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.690\nPick those things apart.\n\n513\n00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:56.484\nDig into those.\n\n514\n00:26:56.484 --> 00:26:58.320\nThey're great places to learn and\n\n515\n00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.960\nreinforce even if you're not taking\nthe exam, so to speak, right?\n\n516\n00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.210\nIf you have questions, you have concerns,\nyou beg to differ with the test maker,\n\n517\n00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.700\nreach out in the forum,\ntalk to the experts you find there.\n\n518\n00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.680\nAsk your questions, get the good feedback.\n\n519\n00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.195\nSee how other students are doing\nwith the exams themselves.\n\n520\n00:27:15.195 --> 00:27:18.710\nUse the resources that\nare available to you, right?\n\n521\n00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.375\nAnd once you think you're ready to go,\nyou've taken the sample papers,\n\n522\n00:27:22.375 --> 00:27:26.630\nyou've got your confidence up,\nthen you can go out and\n\n523\n00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.985\npurchase your exam voucher\nfrom PassionIT Group.\n\n524\n00:27:29.985 --> 00:27:33.335\nAnd with that voucher in hand,\nyou can then schedule your exam\n\n525\n00:27:33.335 --> 00:27:37.815\nat a time of your choosing, open 24/7,\nas long, the exam time anywhere.\n\n526\n00:27:37.815 --> 00:27:38.705\n&gt;&gt; What could be easier?\n\n527\n00:27:38.705 --> 00:27:40.495\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty darn straightforward.\n\n528\n00:27:40.495 --> 00:27:42.105\nSo I wish you luck in your exam prep.\n\n529\n00:27:42.105 --> 00:27:43.345\nI certainly wish you luck on your exam.\n\n530\n00:27:43.345 --> 00:27:44.623\nAnd you need any help at all,\n\n531\n00:27:44.623 --> 00:27:47.454\nyou can reach out to me directly\nat deckerheads@yahoo.com.\n\n532\n00:27:47.454 --> 00:27:51.610\nCome through the forum as well,\nand again, good luck.\n\n533\n00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:54.420\nOnce again, Terry, thanks very, very much.\n\n534\n00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.060\nAwesome information.\n\n535\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.860\nSample paper review ITIL OSA, part two.\n\n536\n00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.740\nThere is a part one.\n\n537\n00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.850\nIn fact, there is quite a few videos\nin this series of sample paper review.\n\n538\n00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.070\nYou'll wanna see all of them.\n\n539\n00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.940\nBecause it will help you, absolutely.\n\n540\n00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.440\nThank you for\n\n541\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.080\nwatching ITProTV, and remember,\na good IT pro is always learning.\n\n542\n00:28:14.080 -->
