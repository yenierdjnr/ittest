Well, Operational Support and\n\n7\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.050\nAnalysis is primarily focused\non service operations.\n\n8\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.090\nOne of the five lifecycle stages.\n\n9\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.470\nThis course is\nan intermediate level course.\n\n10\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.460\nAnd it follows a prerequisite,\nITIL foundations.\n\n11\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.200\nSo what we'll do is we'll review\nfoundations very briefly.\n\n12\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.240\nMaking sure we got\nthe right language in play.\n\n13\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.200\nAnd then we'll dive in deep into\nthe five processes in play.\n\n14\n00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.850\nIncident management, problem management,\nevent management, access management, and\n\n15\n00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.490\nrequest fulfillment.\n\n16\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.290\nAnd then we'll look at the people\nthat get those things done.\n\n17\n00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.880\nAnd those people are spread\nacross four functions.\n\n18\n00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.740\nIT operations management, technical\nmanagement, applications management and\n\n19\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.930\nthe service desk.\n\n20\n00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.950\nAnd of course because it's\noperational support and analysis.\n\n21\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.700\nWe'll also be looking about the best ways\nto analyze these different processes\n\n22\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.220\nand functions.\n\n23\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.350\nTo make sure that they're\noperating at the highest levels.\n\n24\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nSo\n\n25\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.940\nwho would say is the intended audience for\nthis series?\n\n26\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.210\nIs it, I guess in general,\nwho would get the most benefit out of it?\n\n27\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.590\n&gt;&gt; It's a good question.\n\n28\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.550\nCertainly you're gonna get a lot of\nvaluable information that could go back to\n\n29\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.520\nyour office space, your work space,\nand make some improvements.\n\n30\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.490\nRight, ITIL is the best practice for\nIT service management.\n\n31\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.840\nYou could certainly take these principles\nback into your operational environments.\n\n32\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.170\nAnd begin to consider how to\nimplement these or approve those.\n\n33\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.230\nIt also is good for the academic study.\n\n34\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.220\nWe're gonna help you prepare for\nan exam as well.\n\n35\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.090\nSo if you're on a path\ntowards certification.\n\n36\n00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.410\nMaybe you're seeking the certificate\nto be an ITIL expert.\n\n37\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.490\nThis is gonna be along that path as well.\n\n38\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.260\nSo we do spend sometime preparing you for\nthe exam..\n\n39\n00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.620\nAnd giving you some pointers\non how that exam looks.\n\n40\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.060\nSo I think it's both for\nthe practical purposes and\n\n41\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.040\nshowing you there's lots\nof meat on that bone.\n\n42\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.240\nBut if you're on an academic path for\ncertification.\n\n43\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.760\nYou're gonna get something\nto chew on as well.\n\n44\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.430\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell speaking of certification.\n\n45\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.210\nIf you are on that path,\n\n46\n00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.970\nwhat can somebody who is going down\nthat road expect from the exam?\n\n47\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.830\nHow do we get signed up for it?\n\n48\n00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.160\nWhat should we do as exam takers?\n\n49\n00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, good question.\n\n50\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.080\nFirst of all, the exam at the intermediate\nlevel is certainly different than\n\n51\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.400\nthe foundation exam.\n\n52\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.810\nThe foundation exam was 40 questions,\none correct answer.\n\n53\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.270\nAnd you had to get 26 out of 40.\n\n54\n00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.430\n65% to get that certificate and\nearn that certificate.\n\n55\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.980\nAt the intermediate level,\nyou have to perform a little higher.\n\n56\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.590\nAnd it's a bit harder.\n\n57\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.880\nThere's only eight questions.\n\n58\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.930\nEach question is based on\nan independent scenario.\n\n59\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.952\nAnd the questions have\nanswers of gradient scoring.\n\n60\n00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:35.840\nSo in other words, you could pick\na level answer is the best answer and\n\n61\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.320\nget five points credit.\n\n62\n00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.380\nOr pick a question\nthat's only worth three.\n\n63\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.890\nOver eight questions, if the most you\ncan get in each question is five points.\n\n64\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.630\nThat's 40 points at maximum.\n\n65\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.100\nYou have to get at least 28 correct.\n\n66\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.190\nSo, it's not just route\nmemorization of concepts and words.\n\n67\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.100\nWhich is such as what foundation was.\n\n68\n00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.870\nYou have to apply that knowledge, and\n\n69\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.430\nanalyze the situation and\napply appropriately.\n\n70\n00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.700\nSo therefore, it's a little bit more\nchallenging, but also pretty realistic.\n\n71\n00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.300\nThey're kind of fun actually.\n\n72\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.860\nAnd to be able to take something and\ndo something with it.\n\n73\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.770\nAnd that's what this\nexam expects you to do.\n\n74\n00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, well if that sounds like\nsomething that might interest you.\n\n75\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.075\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou in our upcoming series.\n\n76\n00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:20.614\n[SOUND]\n\n",
