          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.717\n[SOUND] Hi and welcome to ITPro.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:07.431\nMy name is Jo Peacock and\n\n3\n00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:13.190\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL intermediate.\n\n4\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.520\nSo let's take a look then at\nour first slide here coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.840\nAnd we have our introduction\nto our intermediate class and\n\n6\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.745\nYou will see what we will cover is\nan introduction to the class followed\n\n8\n00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:37.112\nby the principles and\nthe processes of the lifecycle phase.\n\n9\n00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:40.907\nThen we'll take a look at organizing for\nthat lifecycle phase and\n\n10\n00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.500\nalso the technology considerations.\n\n11\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270\nEspecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n12\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.880\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand the critical success factors and\n\n13\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.110\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith that particular lifecycle phase.\n\n14\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.692\nAnd most importantly, of course,\nfor you, is that preparation for\n\n15\n00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:04.543\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class.\n\n16\n00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.142\nOkay, so let me take a look now then and\n\n17\n00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:11.790\nhow we're going to approach this\nparticular intermediate class.\n\n18\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work,\n\n19\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.550\nobviously you're going to be watching us\non-screen both myself and my colleagues,\n\n20\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110\nand we're going to be taking you through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n21\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.450\nAnd then there are going to be some\ndiscussions and some exercises that\n\n22\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.140\nare going to be based primarily in our\nchat rooms and also in our forums as well.\n\n23\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.530\nAnd we're also available if you want\nto undertake any of the assessments,\n\n24\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.960\nthen please feel free to come\nback to us via the forums and\n\n25\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.270\nwe will be able to help\nyou out in any way we can.\n\n26\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.950\nAlso provided in the course material,\nwhich is available for\n\n27\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.390\nyou to download, are mock tests or\nexams if you prefer to use that word.\n\n28\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.720\nAnd we will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you.\n\n29\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.675\nSo, where are we then at\nITIL intermediate level?\n\n30\n00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:15.090\nWell, you'll see in using Bloom’s Taxonomy\nthat we are actually at Level 4 Analyzing.\n\n31\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.931\nIn other words, we've done foundation\nlevel, we've done the remembering and\n\n32\n00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.007\nthe understanding of those\nconcepts within ITIL.\n\n33\n00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:26.361\nAnd we're actually moving\nthrough applying those\n\n34\n00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:29.020\nconcepts to analyzing those concepts.\n\n35\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.809\nAnd being able to apply\nthe ITIL processes, and\n\n36\n00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:38.787\nalso the concepts at a real world level,\nin a real world situation, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:38.787 --> 00:02:42.171\nSo where does ITIL come from then?\n\n38\n00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:45.080\nWell let me give you a little\nbit of a background.\n\n39\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.812\nIt's actually owned by\na company called Axelos and\n\n40\n00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:53.771\nit was first published in the mid 1980s,\nby the UK government.\n\n41\n00:02:53.771 --> 00:03:00.665\nAnd the Office of Government Commerce\nowned ITIL for a very, very long time.\n\n42\n00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:04.915\nAnd we developed ITIL right\nthe way back from the 1980s,\n\n43\n00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:08.999\nthrough its version 2 in the 1990s,\nmid 1990s,\n\n44\n00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:12.271\nto version 3 which was released in 2007.\n\n45\n00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:17.620\nAnd then there was an update\nto version 3 in 2011,\n\n46\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.450\nwhich is exactly where we are right now.\n\n47\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.660\nIt is copyright, it is trademark\nprotected, it's a framework for\n\n48\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.670\nmanaging services.\n\n49\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.928\nAnd as such, it is a flexible framework,\n\n50\n00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:37.796\na framework that we would expect any\norganization to adopt as a framework,\n\n51\n00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:41.443\nbut then to adapt it to suit your needs,\nokay?\n\n52\n00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:45.117\nITIL was born right\nthe way back in the 1980s,\n\n53\n00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:49.405\nout of a desire to be able to\ndemonstrate value for money and\n\n54\n00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:54.340\nefficiency for\nthe use of taxpayer's money within the UK.\n\n55\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.860\nWay back in the 1980s these things\nstarted appearing on desks and\n\n56\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.880\nquite frankly, we didn't know how\nto manage these in an unbiased,\n\n57\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.883\nin an impartial and\nin an efficient and effective way.\n\n58\n00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:13.009\nAnd thus ITIL was born, and ITIL was\nborn from a group of industry experts\n\n59\n00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:18.305\nthat went out into the big wide world and\nanalysed various organizations,\n\n60\n00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:23.098\nfrom various different industry sectors,\nnot just government but\n\n61\n00:04:23.098 --> 00:04:26.990\nwe're talking finance,\nwe're talking retail etc.\n\n62\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.040\nAnd they came back with\na set of best practices,\n\n63\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.045\nbest practices that they observed in the\nreal world for managing our IT services.\n\n64\n00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:42.654\nAnd thus, we have ITIL and\nas I've already said we've had\n\n65\n00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:47.940\nsubsequent revisions and\nnow we're up to version 3, 2011.\n\n66\n00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.724\nSo we work on the understanding that we\n\n67\n00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:57.361\nhave a life to every single service.\n\n68\n00:04:57.361 --> 00:05:01.715\nAnd we start off with a concept\nin service strategy and\n\n69\n00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:07.600\nthen we take that concept and\nwe design it and then we develop it.\n\n70\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.791\nAnd we deploy it as a service into a live\nenvironment which is where we operate and\n\n71\n00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.273\nwhere we maintain it.\n\n72\n00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:19.040\nAnd we continually seek to\nensure that we are aligned with\n\n73\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.230\nthe needs of the organization in CSI.\n\n74\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.320\nSo you're attending this class\nbecause you probably want to\n\n75\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.031\nachieve an ITIL\nIntermediate Qualification.\n\n76\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.920\nSo you can that,\nif we were to start off right at the very,\n\n77\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.280\nvery top, you'll see where I am.\n\n78\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer, working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n79\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.830\nI'm also an accredited examiner, and\nproctor, or invigilator for these exams.\n\n80\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.020\nAnd work very, very closely with\nthe official ITIL accreditor and\n\n81\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.560\nalso Axelos who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n82\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.080\nNow in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n83\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.058\nWell, we start off with ITIL Foundation.\n\n84\n00:06:09.058 --> 00:06:14.103\nAnd ITIL Foundation would\ntraditionally be a three day\n\n85\n00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:19.927\nclassroom experience where we\nlearn the foundations of ITIL.\n\n86\n00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:23.542\nAnd we learn all the terminology, and all\nof the definitions to that terminology.\n\n87\n00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:28.900\nThere's roughly around about 75 that we\nlearn within the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n88\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.560\nAnd then, as we move through we can\n\n89\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.710\neither take an ITIL practitioner class\nwhich can be taken at any point in time,\n\n90\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.820\nthroughout the progression\nof your career within ITIL.\n\n91\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.220\nBecause ITIL practitioner focuses on\nthe implementation of ITIL, okay?\n\n92\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.210\nWhereas if we take a look at the more\nadvanced intermediate classes,\n\n93\n00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.048\nyou are at this moment\nin a Lifecycle Modules.\n\n94\n00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:59.720\nAnd those Lifecycle Modules consist\nof service strategy, service design,\n\n95\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.470\nservice transition, service operation and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n96\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.557\nAnd that's where we focus on those\nlifecycles that we've just looked at\n\n97\n00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:09.367\npreviously.\n\n98\n00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:14.776\nOkay, and on the right hand side\nthen we have our capability modules,\n\n99\n00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:20.590\nand these capability modules really\nfocus on specific areas within ITIL.\n\n100\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:27.109\nSuch as, RCV which focuses on\nrelease control and validation.\n\n101\n00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:30.504\nAnd these classes,\nyou will notice that every single\n\n102\n00:07:30.504 --> 00:07:34.430\none of these classes has got\na score right beside each one.\n\n103\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.271\nSo we've got a number 2 for\nITIL Foundation and we've got a 3 for\n\n104\n00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:44.213\nLifecycle Modules and we've got a 4 for\nour Capability Modules.\n\n105\n00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:49.383\nNow what we need to do is\nensure that we have achieved\n\n106\n00:07:49.383 --> 00:07:54.674\na minimum of 15 credits at\nboth either lifecycle or\n\n107\n00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:57.460\ncapability module level.\n\n108\n00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:03.252\nIn order to be able to qualify to sit the\nManaging Across the Lifecycle class and\n\n109\n00:08:03.252 --> 00:08:08.665\ntherefore subsequently the test\nthat goes along with that class.\n\n110\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:13.065\nSo we need to take two from the ITIL\nFoundation, that's a prerequisite,\n\n111\n00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:14.905\nwe have to do the foundation.\n\n112\n00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:19.756\nAnd then we need to add in another\n15 scores from either, as I've said,\n\n113\n00:08:19.756 --> 00:08:22.511\nthe lifecycle or the capability stream.\n\n114\n00:08:22.511 --> 00:08:25.549\nNow you can interchange,\nyou can mix and match,\n\n115\n00:08:25.549 --> 00:08:29.100\nyou do not have to stick to one stream or\nthe other.\n\n116\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.215\nOnce you've got that 17 in total scores\n\n117\n00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:37.165\nthat are needed to be able to sit\nManaging across The Lifecycle.\n\n118\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:40.805\nYou're perfectly able to sit\nthat lifecycle class and\n\n119\n00:08:40.805 --> 00:08:43.503\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n120\n00:08:43.503 --> 00:08:48.542\nAnd as soon as you've take that test,\nyou will be awarded those 5 credits,\n\n121\n00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:52.535\nwhich will mean that you\nhave achieved ITIL Expert.\n\n122\n00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:57.073\nNow, ITIL Expert is allocated\nas soon as you have passed\n\n123\n00:08:57.073 --> 00:09:02.510\nthe Managing Across the Lifecycle test and\nhave achieved 22 credits.\n\n124\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.770\nBoth of those must happen in order for\nyou to achieve ITIL Expert.\n\n125\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.090\nNow, we have the ITIL Master\nqualification,\n\n126\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.630\nand the ITIL Master is\na completely different beast.\n\n127\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.410\nThe ITIL Master is a two-year\nqualification, and\n\n128\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:25.750\nduring that two years you will be\nexpected to submit various white papers\n\n129\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.500\non specific topics within\nthe ITIL qualification scheme.\n\n130\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.870\nSo these could be topics\non activities within ITIL,\n\n131\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.830\nthese could be topics on\nprocesses within ITIL,\n\n132\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.810\nthese could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n133\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.860\nBut you will be required to sit\na number of white papers or\n\n134\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.410\nsubmit a number of white papers\nover the period of two years.\n\n135\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.520\nAt the end of those two years,\nonce you have submitted the prerequisite\n\n136\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n137\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.760\nAnd during that panel interview, you will\nbe assessed not only on your white papers,\n\n138\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.880\nbut also on your experience within\nthe IT service management arena.\n\n139\n00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.890\nAnd at the end of that panel interview,\n\n140\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.630\nthen if successful, you will be\nawarded the status of ITIL Master.\n\n141\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.735\nSo the qualification scheme, I'm going to\ntake this back now to Bloom's Taxonomy\n\n142\n00:10:24.735 --> 00:10:28.969\nthen and just very, very quickly look\nat the fact that in ITIL Foundation.\n\n143\n00:10:28.969 --> 00:10:32.661\nAnd I know that I've already\ncovered this on a previous slide,\n\n144\n00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:36.774\nwe just looked at understanding,\nunderstanding the terminology and\n\n145\n00:10:36.774 --> 00:10:39.150\nthe concepts of ITIL Foundation.\n\n146\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.954\nAnd then in the Lifecycle Modules we're\nlooking at implementing those processes\n\n147\n00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:45.423\ncontained within ITIL.\n\n148\n00:10:45.423 --> 00:10:50.148\nAnd in Capability we're looking at\nactually undertaking those process and\n\n149\n00:10:50.148 --> 00:10:51.928\nmanaging those processes.\n\n150\n00:10:51.928 --> 00:10:57.446\nWhereas Managing Across the Lifecycle,\nthis is for senior management,\n\n151\n00:10:57.446 --> 00:11:01.639\nthis is at CIO level, and\nits senior management level.\n\n152\n00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:05.179\nAnd in MALC,\nas we like to abbreviate it to,\n\n153\n00:11:05.179 --> 00:11:10.475\nyou're concerned with leading\nIT service management.\n\n154\n00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:15.262\nSo I mentioned right at the very\nbeginning of all of this that we had\n\n155\n00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:20.240\na test to go along with every single\nlifecycle phase, and there is.\n\n156\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.176\nAnd we will be conducting a session\nto go over this particular test or\n\n157\n00:11:25.176 --> 00:11:27.600\nat least a sample of these tests,\n\n158\n00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.960\njust to give you some preparation for\nthe actual test itself.\n\n159\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.678\nSo your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually.\n\n160\n00:11:38.678 --> 00:11:46.390\nIt is an 8 multiple choice question test,\nit's complex multiple choice.\n\n161\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.829\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test.\n\n162\n00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:54.054\nAnd with every single question,\nyou will be given a scenario and\n\n163\n00:11:54.054 --> 00:11:59.958\nthen you will be given four possible\noptions, four possible answers for\n\n164\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.331\nthe question that is posed\nalong with that scenario.\n\n165\n00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:10.410\nYou get 5 points for the best fit answer,\nnow it mentions up there the most correct.\n\n166\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.910\nI always call it the best fit,\nbecause every single question asks\n\n167\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.300\nwhat is the best answer given\nthe scenario and given the question?\n\n168\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.860\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct,\n\n169\n00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.480\nbecause the question is asking you for\nthe best fit.\n\n170\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.800\nAnd for that best fit you're\ngonna get 5 points, for\n\n171\n00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.696\nthe next best fit you're gonna get 3,\nfor the next one which\n\n172\n00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:42.897\nwe've considered to be the least\ncorrect you're gonna get 1.\n\n173\n00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:47.890\nAnd for the next one you're gonna get a 0,\nnow it mentions up on that\n\n174\n00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.021\nslide there that the next one\nis 0 marks for incorrect.\n\n175\n00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:56.490\nWe like to call that in the industry, us\nin the know, we call that the distractor.\n\n176\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.600\nAnd we call it the distractor for\na reason, cuz it distracts.\n\n177\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.130\nAnd quite often what you will find is,\nwith your distractor,\n\n178\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.440\na lot of the words in the terminology that\nare taken straight out of the ITIL books,\n\n179\n00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.790\nstraight out of the publications, and\n\n180\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.490\nare input into that 0 pointer\nbecause it's there to distract.\n\n181\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:21.250\nAnd it sounds great, but more often\nthan not, that distractor has absolutely\n\n182\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.600\nno relevance to the scenario or\nto the question.\n\n183\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.480\nSo you have to be incredibly careful with\nthat, it's so easy to be distracted.\n\n184\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.370\nYou have to get 28 out of a possible\n40 in order to be able to pass and\n\n185\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.540\nachieve accreditation at\nany lifecycle test, okay?\n\n186\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.960\nIf English is not your first language you\nare allowed a paper dictionary, but you\n\n187\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.650\nwill be asked to show that to the proctor\nat the time that you take your test.\n\n188\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:01.648\nAnd as I've already said, you have to\nhave an ITIL Foundation in version 3 or\n\n189\n00:14:01.648 --> 00:14:08.225\nversion 3 2011, or an ITIL version 2\nFoundation Bridge to version 3, okay?\n\n190\n00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:13.287\nI will be very, very honest with you,\nthere are not that many\n\n191\n00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:18.580\npeople that have attained\nthe version 2 to version 3 Bridge.\n\n192\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.350\nAnd most people will have the version 3 or\n\n193\n00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.540\n2011, sorry, ITIL Foundation certificate.\n\n194\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.730\nYou will be required to\nupload that certificate to\n\n195\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.510\nthe examining board prior to\nsitting your lifecycle test.\n\n196\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.680\nSo be prepared with that,\nyou will need to have it to hand and\n\n197\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.590\nsaved as a PDF as well.\n\n198\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:51.880\nSo when we come to the end of every single\nlifecycle class, we will be going over and\n\n199\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.410\nthis one's no exception,\nwe'll be going over a sample test for you.\n\n200\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.670\nAnd during that sample test I'll\nbe giving you lots of hints and\n\n201\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.150\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n202\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.300\nAnd also how to ensure that you read\nthe full question, how to relax and\n\n203\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:13.200\nto make sure that you approach\nit with an open mind, but\n\n204\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.100\nyou consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n205\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.610\nUltimately, we wanna get you\npast the test just as much as\n\n206\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.760\nyou want to achieve that accreditation.\n\n207\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:30.608\nSo just to sum up, what we will\nbe doing over the next few shows\n\n208\n00:15:30.608 --> 00:15:37.255\nis encouraging you to take your ITIL\nlifecycle intermediate classes.\n\n209\n00:15:37.255 --> 00:15:41.289\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n210\n00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:41.789\n[SOUND]\n\n",
