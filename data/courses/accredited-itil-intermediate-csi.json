          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.717\n[SOUND] Hi and welcome to ITPro.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:07.431\nMy name is Jo Peacock and\n\n3\n00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:13.190\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL intermediate.\n\n4\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.520\nSo let's take a look then at\nour first slide here coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.840\nAnd we have our introduction\nto our intermediate class and\n\n6\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.745\nYou will see what we will cover is\nan introduction to the class followed\n\n8\n00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:37.112\nby the principles and\nthe processes of the lifecycle phase.\n\n9\n00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:40.907\nThen we'll take a look at organizing for\nthat lifecycle phase and\n\n10\n00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.500\nalso the technology considerations.\n\n11\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270\nEspecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n12\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.880\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand the critical success factors and\n\n13\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.110\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith that particular lifecycle phase.\n\n14\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.692\nAnd most importantly, of course,\nfor you, is that preparation for\n\n15\n00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:04.543\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class.\n\n16\n00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.142\nOkay, so let me take a look now then and\n\n17\n00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:11.790\nhow we're going to approach this\nparticular intermediate class.\n\n18\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work,\n\n19\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.550\nobviously you're going to be watching us\non-screen both myself and my colleagues,\n\n20\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110\nand we're going to be taking you through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n21\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.450\nAnd then there are going to be some\ndiscussions and some exercises that\n\n22\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.140\nare going to be based primarily in our\nchat rooms and also in our forums as well.\n\n23\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.530\nAnd we're also available if you want\nto undertake any of the assessments,\n\n24\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.960\nthen please feel free to come\nback to us via the forums and\n\n25\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.270\nwe will be able to help\nyou out in any way we can.\n\n26\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.950\nAlso provided in the course material,\nwhich is available for\n\n27\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.390\nyou to download, are mock tests or\nexams if you prefer to use that word.\n\n28\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.720\nAnd we will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you.\n\n29\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.675\nSo, where are we then at\nITIL intermediate level?\n\n30\n00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:15.090\nWell, you'll see in using Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy\nthat we are actually at Level 4 Analyzing.\n\n31\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.931\nIn other words, we've done foundation\nlevel, we've done the remembering and\n\n32\n00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.007\nthe understanding of those\nconcepts within ITIL.\n\n33\n00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:26.361\nAnd we're actually moving\nthrough applying those\n\n34\n00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:29.020\nconcepts to analyzing those concepts.\n\n35\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.809\nAnd being able to apply\nthe ITIL processes, and\n\n36\n00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:38.787\nalso the concepts at a real world level,\nin a real world situation, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:38.787 --> 00:02:42.171\nSo where does ITIL come from then?\n\n38\n00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:45.080\nWell let me give you a little\nbit of a background.\n\n39\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.812\nIt's actually owned by\na company called Axelos and\n\n40\n00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:53.771\nit was first published in the mid 1980s,\nby the UK government.\n\n41\n00:02:53.771 --> 00:03:00.665\nAnd the Office of Government Commerce\nowned ITIL for a very, very long time.\n\n42\n00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:04.915\nAnd we developed ITIL right\nthe way back from the 1980s,\n\n43\n00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:08.999\nthrough its version 2 in the 1990s,\nmid 1990s,\n\n44\n00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:12.271\nto version 3 which was released in 2007.\n\n45\n00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:17.620\nAnd then there was an update\nto version 3 in 2011,\n\n46\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.450\nwhich is exactly where we are right now.\n\n47\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.660\nIt is copyright, it is trademark\nprotected, it's a framework for\n\n48\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.670\nmanaging services.\n\n49\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.928\nAnd as such, it is a flexible framework,\n\n50\n00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:37.796\na framework that we would expect any\norganization to adopt as a framework,\n\n51\n00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:41.443\nbut then to adapt it to suit your needs,\nokay?\n\n52\n00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:45.117\nITIL was born right\nthe way back in the 1980s,\n\n53\n00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:49.405\nout of a desire to be able to\ndemonstrate value for money and\n\n54\n00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:54.340\nefficiency for\nthe use of taxpayer's money within the UK.\n\n55\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.860\nWay back in the 1980s these things\nstarted appearing on desks and\n\n56\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.880\nquite frankly, we didn't know how\nto manage these in an unbiased,\n\n57\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.883\nin an impartial and\nin an efficient and effective way.\n\n58\n00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:13.009\nAnd thus ITIL was born, and ITIL was\nborn from a group of industry experts\n\n59\n00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:18.305\nthat went out into the big wide world and\nanalysed various organizations,\n\n60\n00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:23.098\nfrom various different industry sectors,\nnot just government but\n\n61\n00:04:23.098 --> 00:04:26.990\nwe're talking finance,\nwe're talking retail etc.\n\n62\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.040\nAnd they came back with\na set of best practices,\n\n63\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.045\nbest practices that they observed in the\nreal world for managing our IT services.\n\n64\n00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:42.654\nAnd thus, we have ITIL and\nas I've already said we've had\n\n65\n00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:47.940\nsubsequent revisions and\nnow we're up to version 3, 2011.\n\n66\n00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.724\nSo we work on the understanding that we\n\n67\n00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:57.361\nhave a life to every single service.\n\n68\n00:04:57.361 --> 00:05:01.715\nAnd we start off with a concept\nin service strategy and\n\n69\n00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:07.600\nthen we take that concept and\nwe design it and then we develop it.\n\n70\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.791\nAnd we deploy it as a service into a live\nenvironment which is where we operate and\n\n71\n00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.273\nwhere we maintain it.\n\n72\n00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:19.040\nAnd we continually seek to\nensure that we are aligned with\n\n73\n00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.230\nthe needs of the organization in CSI.\n\n74\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.320\nSo you're attending this class\nbecause you probably want to\n\n75\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.031\nachieve an ITIL\nIntermediate Qualification.\n\n76\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.920\nSo you can that,\nif we were to start off right at the very,\n\n77\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.280\nvery top, you'll see where I am.\n\n78\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer, working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n79\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.830\nI'm also an accredited examiner, and\nproctor, or invigilator for these exams.\n\n80\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.020\nAnd work very, very closely with\nthe official ITIL accreditor and\n\n81\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.560\nalso Axelos who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n82\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.080\nNow in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n83\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.058\nWell, we start off with ITIL Foundation.\n\n84\n00:06:09.058 --> 00:06:14.103\nAnd ITIL Foundation would\ntraditionally be a three day\n\n85\n00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:19.927\nclassroom experience where we\nlearn the foundations of ITIL.\n\n86\n00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:23.542\nAnd we learn all the terminology, and all\nof the definitions to that terminology.\n\n87\n00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:28.900\nThere's roughly around about 75 that we\nlearn within the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n88\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.560\nAnd then, as we move through we can\n\n89\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.710\neither take an ITIL practitioner class\nwhich can be taken at any point in time,\n\n90\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.820\nthroughout the progression\nof your career within ITIL.\n\n91\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.220\nBecause ITIL practitioner focuses on\nthe implementation of ITIL, okay?\n\n92\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.210\nWhereas if we take a look at the more\nadvanced intermediate classes,\n\n93\n00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.048\nyou are at this moment\nin a Lifecycle Modules.\n\n94\n00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:59.720\nAnd those Lifecycle Modules consist\nof service strategy, service design,\n\n95\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.470\nservice transition, service operation and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n96\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.557\nAnd that's where we focus on those\nlifecycles that we've just looked at\n\n97\n00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:09.367\npreviously.\n\n98\n00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:14.776\nOkay, and on the right hand side\nthen we have our capability modules,\n\n99\n00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:20.590\nand these capability modules really\nfocus on specific areas within ITIL.\n\n100\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:27.109\nSuch as, RCV which focuses on\nrelease control and validation.\n\n101\n00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:30.504\nAnd these classes,\nyou will notice that every single\n\n102\n00:07:30.504 --> 00:07:34.430\none of these classes has got\na score right beside each one.\n\n103\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.271\nSo we've got a number 2 for\nITIL Foundation and we've got a 3 for\n\n104\n00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:44.213\nLifecycle Modules and we've got a 4 for\nour Capability Modules.\n\n105\n00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:49.383\nNow what we need to do is\nensure that we have achieved\n\n106\n00:07:49.383 --> 00:07:54.674\na minimum of 15 credits at\nboth either lifecycle or\n\n107\n00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:57.460\ncapability module level.\n\n108\n00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:03.252\nIn order to be able to qualify to sit the\nManaging Across the Lifecycle class and\n\n109\n00:08:03.252 --> 00:08:08.665\ntherefore subsequently the test\nthat goes along with that class.\n\n110\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:13.065\nSo we need to take two from the ITIL\nFoundation, that's a prerequisite,\n\n111\n00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:14.905\nwe have to do the foundation.\n\n112\n00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:19.756\nAnd then we need to add in another\n15 scores from either, as I've said,\n\n113\n00:08:19.756 --> 00:08:22.511\nthe lifecycle or the capability stream.\n\n114\n00:08:22.511 --> 00:08:25.549\nNow you can interchange,\nyou can mix and match,\n\n115\n00:08:25.549 --> 00:08:29.100\nyou do not have to stick to one stream or\nthe other.\n\n116\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.215\nOnce you've got that 17 in total scores\n\n117\n00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:37.165\nthat are needed to be able to sit\nManaging across The Lifecycle.\n\n118\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:40.805\nYou're perfectly able to sit\nthat lifecycle class and\n\n119\n00:08:40.805 --> 00:08:43.503\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n120\n00:08:43.503 --> 00:08:48.542\nAnd as soon as you've take that test,\nyou will be awarded those 5 credits,\n\n121\n00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:52.535\nwhich will mean that you\nhave achieved ITIL Expert.\n\n122\n00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:57.073\nNow, ITIL Expert is allocated\nas soon as you have passed\n\n123\n00:08:57.073 --> 00:09:02.510\nthe Managing Across the Lifecycle test and\nhave achieved 22 credits.\n\n124\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.770\nBoth of those must happen in order for\nyou to achieve ITIL Expert.\n\n125\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.090\nNow, we have the ITIL Master\nqualification,\n\n126\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.630\nand the ITIL Master is\na completely different beast.\n\n127\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.410\nThe ITIL Master is a two-year\nqualification, and\n\n128\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:25.750\nduring that two years you will be\nexpected to submit various white papers\n\n129\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.500\non specific topics within\nthe ITIL qualification scheme.\n\n130\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.870\nSo these could be topics\non activities within ITIL,\n\n131\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.830\nthese could be topics on\nprocesses within ITIL,\n\n132\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.810\nthese could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n133\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.860\nBut you will be required to sit\na number of white papers or\n\n134\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.410\nsubmit a number of white papers\nover the period of two years.\n\n135\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.520\nAt the end of those two years,\nonce you have submitted the prerequisite\n\n136\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n137\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.760\nAnd during that panel interview, you will\nbe assessed not only on your white papers,\n\n138\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.880\nbut also on your experience within\nthe IT service management arena.\n\n139\n00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.890\nAnd at the end of that panel interview,\n\n140\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.630\nthen if successful, you will be\nawarded the status of ITIL Master.\n\n141\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.735\nSo the qualification scheme, I'm going to\ntake this back now to Bloom's Taxonomy\n\n142\n00:10:24.735 --> 00:10:28.969\nthen and just very, very quickly look\nat the fact that in ITIL Foundation.\n\n143\n00:10:28.969 --> 00:10:32.661\nAnd I know that I've already\ncovered this on a previous slide,\n\n144\n00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:36.774\nwe just looked at understanding,\nunderstanding the terminology and\n\n145\n00:10:36.774 --> 00:10:39.150\nthe concepts of ITIL Foundation.\n\n146\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.954\nAnd then in the Lifecycle Modules we're\nlooking at implementing those processes\n\n147\n00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:45.423\ncontained within ITIL.\n\n148\n00:10:45.423 --> 00:10:50.148\nAnd in Capability we're looking at\nactually undertaking those process and\n\n149\n00:10:50.148 --> 00:10:51.928\nmanaging those processes.\n\n150\n00:10:51.928 --> 00:10:57.446\nWhereas Managing Across the Lifecycle,\nthis is for senior management,\n\n151\n00:10:57.446 --> 00:11:01.639\nthis is at CIO level, and\nits senior management level.\n\n152\n00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:05.179\nAnd in MALC,\nas we like to abbreviate it to,\n\n153\n00:11:05.179 --> 00:11:10.475\nyou're concerned with leading\nIT service management.\n\n154\n00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:15.262\nSo I mentioned right at the very\nbeginning of all of this that we had\n\n155\n00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:20.240\na test to go along with every single\nlifecycle phase, and there is.\n\n156\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.176\nAnd we will be conducting a session\nto go over this particular test or\n\n157\n00:11:25.176 --> 00:11:27.600\nat least a sample of these tests,\n\n158\n00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.960\njust to give you some preparation for\nthe actual test itself.\n\n159\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.678\nSo your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually.\n\n160\n00:11:38.678 --> 00:11:46.390\nIt is an 8 multiple choice question test,\nit's complex multiple choice.\n\n161\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.829\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test.\n\n162\n00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:54.054\nAnd with every single question,\nyou will be given a scenario and\n\n163\n00:11:54.054 --> 00:11:59.958\nthen you will be given four possible\noptions, four possible answers for\n\n164\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.331\nthe question that is posed\nalong with that scenario.\n\n165\n00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:10.410\nYou get 5 points for the best fit answer,\nnow it mentions up there the most correct.\n\n166\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.910\nI always call it the best fit,\nbecause every single question asks\n\n167\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.300\nwhat is the best answer given\nthe scenario and given the question?\n\n168\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.860\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct,\n\n169\n00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.480\nbecause the question is asking you for\nthe best fit.\n\n170\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.800\nAnd for that best fit you're\ngonna get 5 points, for\n\n171\n00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.696\nthe next best fit you're gonna get 3,\nfor the next one which\n\n172\n00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:42.897\nwe've considered to be the least\ncorrect you're gonna get 1.\n\n173\n00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:47.890\nAnd for the next one you're gonna get a 0,\nnow it mentions up on that\n\n174\n00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.021\nslide there that the next one\nis 0 marks for incorrect.\n\n175\n00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:56.490\nWe like to call that in the industry, us\nin the know, we call that the distractor.\n\n176\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.600\nAnd we call it the distractor for\na reason, cuz it distracts.\n\n177\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.130\nAnd quite often what you will find is,\nwith your distractor,\n\n178\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.440\na lot of the words in the terminology that\nare taken straight out of the ITIL books,\n\n179\n00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.790\nstraight out of the publications, and\n\n180\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.490\nare input into that 0 pointer\nbecause it's there to distract.\n\n181\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:21.250\nAnd it sounds great, but more often\nthan not, that distractor has absolutely\n\n182\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.600\nno relevance to the scenario or\nto the question.\n\n183\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.480\nSo you have to be incredibly careful with\nthat, it's so easy to be distracted.\n\n184\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.370\nYou have to get 28 out of a possible\n40 in order to be able to pass and\n\n185\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.540\nachieve accreditation at\nany lifecycle test, okay?\n\n186\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.960\nIf English is not your first language you\nare allowed a paper dictionary, but you\n\n187\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.650\nwill be asked to show that to the proctor\nat the time that you take your test.\n\n188\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:01.648\nAnd as I've already said, you have to\nhave an ITIL Foundation in version 3 or\n\n189\n00:14:01.648 --> 00:14:08.225\nversion 3 2011, or an ITIL version 2\nFoundation Bridge to version 3, okay?\n\n190\n00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:13.287\nI will be very, very honest with you,\nthere are not that many\n\n191\n00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:18.580\npeople that have attained\nthe version 2 to version 3 Bridge.\n\n192\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.350\nAnd most people will have the version 3 or\n\n193\n00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.540\n2011, sorry, ITIL Foundation certificate.\n\n194\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.730\nYou will be required to\nupload that certificate to\n\n195\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.510\nthe examining board prior to\nsitting your lifecycle test.\n\n196\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.680\nSo be prepared with that,\nyou will need to have it to hand and\n\n197\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.590\nsaved as a PDF as well.\n\n198\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:51.880\nSo when we come to the end of every single\nlifecycle class, we will be going over and\n\n199\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.410\nthis one's no exception,\nwe'll be going over a sample test for you.\n\n200\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.670\nAnd during that sample test I'll\nbe giving you lots of hints and\n\n201\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.150\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n202\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.300\nAnd also how to ensure that you read\nthe full question, how to relax and\n\n203\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:13.200\nto make sure that you approach\nit with an open mind, but\n\n204\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.100\nyou consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n205\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.610\nUltimately, we wanna get you\npast the test just as much as\n\n206\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.760\nyou want to achieve that accreditation.\n\n207\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:30.608\nSo just to sum up, what we will\nbe doing over the next few shows\n\n208\n00:15:30.608 --> 00:15:37.255\nis encouraging you to take your ITIL\nlifecycle intermediate classes.\n\n209\n00:15:37.255 --> 00:15:41.289\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n210\n00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:41.789\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:08.592\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.560\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.Tv.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\n\n5\n00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.230\nepisode right here on ITPro.Tv.\n\n6\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.760\nYou're watching an ITIL Foundation\nRefresher four year intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.900\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.390\nwe're about to get started here with\nour maestro in ITIL, Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.820\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.260\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Ronnie,\nI'm pleased to be here, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.190\n&gt;&gt; We are doing great today Jo.\n\n12\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.880\nAs we began, we understand that\nfoundations much pretty much set the tone\n\n13\n00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.810\nfor everything that we'll be taking a look\nat here so, having this refresher at\n\n14\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.740\nthis point in our class that we're doing\nis gonna be a great opportunity for\n\n15\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.790\nus to make sure we submit\nthose concepts down.\n\n16\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.790\nSo, where are we gonna begin, Jo?\n\n17\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what we're doing today in this\nparticular session is we're gonna be going\n\n18\n00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.530\nover what everyone learnt during\nthe ITIL foundation class.\n\n19\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.120\nYou see, we cover lots and lots of topics\nin every single intermediate class,\n\n20\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.800\nwhether be it the life cycle classes,\nwhich service operation is one.\n\n21\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.690\nOr whether it be the capability classes\nsuch as release control validation, etc.\n\n22\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.140\nOr even through to the malk- Class.\n\n23\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.430\nThe Managing Across the Lifecycle,\nor the ITIL Practitioner class.\n\n24\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.635\nWe need to understand that foundation\nmaterial, because it's foundation.\n\n25\n00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:30.050\n[LAUGH] And it is the foundation for\nall of our other material.\n\n26\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.880\nNow, in our Foundation class in ITIL,\n\n27\n00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.290\nwe learn all of the terminology\nthat's associated with ITIL.\n\n28\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.610\nThere are over 75 terms and\ndefinitions in the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n29\n00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.010\nAnd I'll be honest with you,\n\n30\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.185\nsometimes the ITIL Foundation Class\ncan be a little bit daunting.\n\n31\n00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:49.080\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Certainly,\n\n32\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.390\nthe feedback that you get from a lot\nof delegates watching ITIL Foundation\n\n33\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.770\nis that they feel like their brains\nfall out at the end of the first day.\n\n34\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.090\nSo what we're gonna do really, and\nwe do this at the start of every single\n\n35\n00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.620\nintermediate class is, we will just\ngo over the foundation principles\n\n36\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.850\njust to refresh them in everybody's mind,\nand then to act as the basis for\n\n37\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.520\nwhat we're going to cover\nover the following sessions.\n\n38\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.040\nAnd so here what we're going to do over\nthe next few sessions is we are going to\n\n39\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.380\ngo over the iteal foundation itself.\n\n40\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.530\nAnd we're gonna go over\nthe concept of the lifecycle, etc.\n\n41\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.870\nAnd we're going to be going over,\nas I say, the foundation material.\n\n42\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo,\nthis is the best time to get started.\n\n43\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.440\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n44\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.000\nWhere are we beginning?\n\n45\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay so,\nthe first thing that we're gonna do and\n\n46\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.070\nyou saw these slides flash out very,\n\n47\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.300\nvery quickly on the screen there and\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at\n\n48\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.930\nthat first particular slide there.\n\n49\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.650\nIt says here,\n\n50\n00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.740\nITIL is presented in 5 CORE volumes that\nare referred to as the SERVICE LIFECYCLE.\n\n51\n00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.910\nLet's take a step back.\n\n52\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.460\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I want to do.\n\n53\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.990\nLet's just think about the fact\nthat a service, an IT service,\n\n54\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.450\nand we're gonna call into the definition\nof a service very shortly.\n\n55\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.680\nBut a service\n&gt;&gt; It has a beginning and\n\n56\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.210\nit has an end, okay.\n\n57\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.410\nIt starts off as an idea,\nthese things don't just happen,\n\n58\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.840\nyou don't just walk in and all of a sudden\neverything's there on your laptop, okay.\n\n59\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.520\nAny new service well has an idea or\nany service and\n\n60\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.570\nthen that idea has got to be developed.\n\n61\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.550\nIt's going to be designed, first of all,\nthen it gets developed, and\n\n62\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.780\nthen it gets tested, and\nthen it gets deployed and,\n\n63\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.400\nthen it's put into the live environment,\nand then we're continually checking that\n\n64\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.540\nservice to make sure that it's\ndoing what it's supposed to do.\n\n65\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.510\nAnd eventually,\nthat service will be retired.\n\n66\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.530\nSo, we refer to that as\nthe life of a service.\n\n67\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.950\nAnother concept of the life cycle,\nis the fact that we understand the concept\n\n68\n00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.520\nthat not just all of our services but\nalso IT as a whole.\n\n69\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.160\nWell, any process starts off as an idea.\n\n70\n00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.010\nAnd then, it's designed and then developed\nand then built and then transitioned.\n\n71\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.660\nAnd put into the live environment, and\nthen we wanna continually improve it.\n\n72\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.710\nAnd it's the same with\nany organization and\n\n73\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.720\nwith any IT service provider,\nit starts off with an idea.\n\n74\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.210\nThings have to start off with a concept,\nokay?\n\n75\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.010\nSo, what we have is the concept\nof a service Lifecycle.\n\n76\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.660\nAnd we've split it into five.\n\n77\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.080\nAnd in the first book, and\nwe call them cold publications or\n\n78\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.640\nbooks because there is a book for\neach life cycle phase.\n\n79\n00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.680\nAnd we start off with service strategy and\nthen,\n\n80\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.570\nthat's where our ideas come from,\nin Service Strategy.\n\n81\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.210\nThis is where we go back to the business\nand we understand what our business needs,\n\n82\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.880\nhow our business works, and\nhow we can add value to our business.\n\n83\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.900\nAnd then in Service Design, we then\ntake that idea that we've come out with\n\n84\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.770\nin Service Strategy and\nwe Design that idea,\n\n85\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.750\nthis is not where we develop,\nthis is where we design the idea.\n\n86\n00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.230\nAnd then, in service transition,\nthis is where we do the development,t and\n\n87\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.970\nwe do the build, and the test, and\nthe deployment of our new services, and\n\n88\n00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.660\nthen we deploy them into\nthe live service operation.\n\n89\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.520\nAnd then, on a regular basis we\nwant to continually improve.\n\n90\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.480\nSo, while I'm looking at this next slide,\nand\n\n91\n00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.670\nit will show you the process\nwithin the next slide.\n\n92\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.850\nI wanna bring in a different concept for\nyou,\n\n93\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.140\nI wanna take you just out of IT for\na moment.\n\n94\n00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.040\nBecause a service strategy I said\nwe come up with the idea, and\n\n95\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.910\nwe have processes in service strategy\nsuch as financial management and\n\n96\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.880\nbusiness relationship management and\nstrategy management,\n\n97\n00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.525\nwhere we come up with those ideas and\nwe to make sure we've got enough money.\n\n98\n00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:53.165\nAnd then, in service design,\nwe have things like service level\n\n99\n00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:57.635\nmanagement that work out our targets for\nhow we're going to deliver that service.\n\n100\n00:05:57.635 --> 00:06:01.965\nSo, this is still in design and\nthen design in availability and\n\n101\n00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:04.375\ncapacity and continuity, etc.\n\n102\n00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:08.005\nAnd we've got supplier\nmanagement in there, too.\n\n103\n00:06:08.005 --> 00:06:13.320\nNow, let's take this out of it as I said,\nlet's say we were building a house.\n\n104\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.760\nNow I know,\nI've got grand ideas I can tell you now.\n\n105\n00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.445\nI know that what I want is I want.\n\n106\n00:06:21.445 --> 00:06:23.675\nSay five bedroom?\n\n107\n00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.515\nYeah, I reckon that'll be enough.\n\n108\n00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:28.155\nBut, I want six bathrooms cuz\nI need one bathroom just for\n\n109\n00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:29.775\nguests that are visiting for the day.\n\n110\n00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:36.430\nNot that anybody ever visits me, but never\nthe less, I want six bathrooms, okay, and.\n\n111\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.460\nI don't think I need a swimming pool,\nbut I wouldn't mind\n\n112\n00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.730\nhaving a dedicated office just for me,\nthat was sound proof that I could work in.\n\n113\n00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.640\nThat would be great.\n\n114\n00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.800\nThat's what I want.\n\n115\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.630\nSo, what I do in service strategy\nis I go to the bank and I say,\n\n116\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.560\ncan I have some money?\n\n117\n00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.480\nOkay, I've got this idea can\nI have some money please.\n\n118\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.490\nAnd here's my idea.\n\n119\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.070\nAnd this is what happens\ninstead of a strategy.\n\n120\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.820\nI mean it's the end of service strategy.\n\n121\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.840\nThe bank says, yeah here you go.\n\n122\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.920\nHave I don't know, $500,000.\n\n123\n00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.220\nThere we go.\n\n124\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.150\nSo now, what do I do?\n\n125\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.300\nWhat do I do with that $500,000.\n\n126\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.800\nDo you reckon?\n\n127\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.340\nYou would just take that money and\n\n128\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.970\nthen you would either have it\ndesigned to be ready to build it.\n\n129\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.370\n&gt;&gt; Right so now,\nI go to an architect, and so\n\n130\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.890\nthis is what's happening here in service\ndesign is I go to an architect and\n\n131\n00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.930\nI say okay can please can\nyou design me a house?\n\n132\n00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:35.203\nThese are my prerequisites and\ngenerally you know what, I'm a customer.\n\n133\n00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:36.620\nI'm not a builder.\n\n134\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.910\nSo, I don't know anything about materials,\nbut\n\n135\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.470\nwhat I do know is that I've got\nsome very specific requirements.\n\n136\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.980\nAnd probably because I'm a little bit\nstrange they're incredibly specific.\n\n137\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.820\nSo, I'm gonna go to him and\nI'm gonna say to him,\n\n138\n00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.280\nI want Five bedrooms and\nI want six bathrooms.\n\n139\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.298\nAnd I want my own sort of soundproofed\noffice where I still want a window in it.\n\n140\n00:07:56.298 --> 00:08:00.119\nI like daylight but then at the same\ntime I don't want any noise coming in.\n\n141\n00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:04.996\nAnd I want bathrooms and\nI want to have marble in the bathrooms and\n\n142\n00:08:04.996 --> 00:08:07.683\nThis is everything that I want.\n\n143\n00:08:07.683 --> 00:08:08.739\nAnd my kitchen,\n\n144\n00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:12.160\nI've gotta have one of those\nrefrigerators with the TV screen in it.\n\n145\n00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.340\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you now,\n\n146\n00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.360\nit's got to have one of those.\n\n147\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.740\nAnd I want a camera in every room,\nand I want at least two,\n\n148\n00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.590\nmaybe three routers in there.\n\n149\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.870\nAnd I want everything to be wireless, and\nI want everything hidden in the walls.\n\n150\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.500\nI don't wanna see any of this technology.\n\n151\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.600\nI told you I was picky.\n\n152\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.120\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go to the architect, and\n\n153\n00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.790\nI'm gonna tell him all of this.\n\n154\n00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.700\nAnd he is going to produce a blueprint.\n\n155\n00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.160\nBut here's something special\nabout that blueprint.\n\n156\n00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.790\nThat blueprint is not just\ngoing to be the plans,\n\n157\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.400\nthe two dimensional plans for that house.\n\n158\n00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.470\nWhat that architect is going to deliver me\n\n159\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.780\nis a three dimensional mock up of what\nthat house is going to look like.\n\n160\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.030\nHe's going to include all of the plans for\nall of the plumbing.\n\n161\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.430\nFor all of the electrics, for\nall of the IT wiring that I want.\n\n162\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:12.320\nHe's going to include all of the list\nof contractors that he's going to use,\n\n163\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.860\nyou know those suppliers.\n\n164\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.840\nHe's going to tell me exactly what tiles\nare going to be used in the bathroom.\n\n165\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.379\nHe's going to tell me\nexactly where he's going to\n\n166\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.670\npurchase all of the furniture from,\nyeah, I didn't mention furniture, did I?\n\n167\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.177\nHe's gonna tell me where he's\ngonna purchase everything,\n\n168\n00:09:30.177 --> 00:09:32.830\neven the bed sheets and everything from.\n\n169\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.780\nHe's going to even tell me what color\nthe bed sheets are going to be.\n\n170\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.760\nThis is not just any blueprint,\nthis is what I call and\n\n171\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.100\nwhat we call in ITIL,\na service design package.\n\n172\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.288\nAnd that service design\npackage contains absolutely\n\n173\n00:09:50.288 --> 00:09:55.134\neverything that's needed to build and\nto test, and\n\n174\n00:09:55.134 --> 00:09:58.784\nto deploy, and then to run that house.\n\n175\n00:09:58.784 --> 00:10:02.349\nSo that service design package even\nincludes all of the instruction manuals\n\n176\n00:10:02.349 --> 00:10:05.870\nfor all of the appliances and everything\nelse that I've got in that house.\n\n177\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.460\nThat's what's in that\nservice design package.\n\n178\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.480\nSo we think of it as\nan architect's blue print, but\n\n179\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.770\nhere in ITIL we think of it\nas a service design package.\n\n180\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.030\nAnd this is why we've got all of\nthose processes in service design.\n\n181\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.840\nAnd then what happens is we hand\nthat over to service transition.\n\n182\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.280\nWe hand it over to the builder, to\nthe contractors and we let them come and\n\n183\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.890\ndo their work.\n\n184\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.980\nAnd they do the build and the tests and\n\n185\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.340\ntake a look at all of\nthose processes in there.\n\n186\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.260\nThey understand with asset and\nconfiguration management\n\n187\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.930\nexactly what the wiring's going to look\nlike and how it's going to hang together,\n\n188\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.405\ncuz the last thing you need is me trying\nto put a tv up on that wall over there.\n\n189\n00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:47.540\nOr me asking for\na TV on that wall over there and\n\n190\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.930\nyou can't because it's a solid brick wall\nbecause I wanted it in brick right all\n\n191\n00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:56.170\nthe external walls and so the TV can't\ngo on there it's gotta go on that wall.\n\n192\n00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.540\nSo asset configuration management tells me\nhow everything is going to hang together.\n\n193\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.343\nSo here in service transition\nwe do all the build and\n\n194\n00:11:04.343 --> 00:11:09.390\nat the end of service transition\nwhat happens is I'm the customer.\n\n195\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:14.462\nAnd somebody hands over the keys to me and\nI walk in that house and\n\n196\n00:11:14.462 --> 00:11:21.180\nI open the refrigerator, the one that\nwas designed, in service design.\n\n197\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.050\nI get out that bottle of wine that'\nwas designed in service design but\n\n198\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.380\nthat's been nicely chilled right now.\n\n199\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.410\nAnd I go to the cupboard in\nthe kitchen where I said I wanted my\n\n200\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:32.230\nglasses to be kept.\n\n201\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.100\nAnd they've got the right\nglasses in the right cupboard.\n\n202\n00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.510\nAnd I take out a glass,\nand I pour my wine.\n\n203\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.250\nAnd I walk over to the couch that I\ntold service design that I wanted and\n\n204\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.910\nsit in front of the tv\nwith my glass of wine.\n\n205\n00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.870\nI pick up the controls,\nbecause the remote control\n\n206\n00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:54.330\nnext to the instruction manual, and\nI just sit back and I watch TV.\n\n207\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.650\nBecause all of my services are in place.\n\n208\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.010\nI've got my contracts in\nplace with the TV company.\n\n209\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.350\nAnd with the Internet, etc.\n\n210\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:09.270\nAnd so now I'm into what we call service\noperation which is just business as usual.\n\n211\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.630\nAnd business as usual is where well\nI just carry on living in my house\n\n212\n00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.580\nwithout any problems.\n\n213\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.905\nOkay that's not going to happen right?\n\n214\n00:12:16.905 --> 00:12:19.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We know there are going to be problems\n\n215\n00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:25.385\nand so during service operation then I'm\ngoing to have systems that are going\n\n216\n00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:31.510\nto monitor Internet usage and systems that\nare going to monitor what TV I watch.\n\n217\n00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.570\nYou know I set DVRs etc.\n\n218\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.730\nAnd then if anything does go\nwrong I've got contractors etc.\n\n219\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.345\nThat I can call if anything goes wrong\nin the house, that's incident and\n\n220\n00:12:41.345 --> 00:12:42.480\nproblem management.\n\n221\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.120\nI know who to call if\nI want something new.\n\n222\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.940\nIf I want an upgrade for instance.\n\n223\n00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.450\nBut then in continual service improvement\nwe're continually assessing but\n\n224\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.720\nyou know what?\n\n225\n00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.140\nThe showers remain water tight, that the\nrefrigerator is it at the right level of\n\n226\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.789\ntechnology because I do\nlike my toys [LAUGH] and so\n\n227\n00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:05.630\nwe're continually improving that\nhouse because let's face it,\n\n228\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.880\nyou don't live with the same decor for\n10 years, do you?\n\n229\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.950\nAnd this is what happens,\n\n230\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.970\nso from an IT perspective service strategy\nis where we come up with the idea.\n\n231\n00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.610\nAnd where we go to the bank for money.\n\n232\n00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.320\nAnd service design is where we design\neverything including our testing,\n\n233\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.500\nour training, and\ndesign how we're going to operate.\n\n234\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:32.110\nIn service transition we build it and\nwe test it, we deploy it in an operation.\n\n235\n00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.630\nWe manage those service\non an ongoing basis and\n\n236\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.810\nthen continual service improvement\nwe continue to ensure that\n\n237\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.200\nour services are aligned to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n238\n00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:49.020\nIn other words, that they're\nexactly what we want to see for\n\n239\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.320\nthe organization at that point in time.\n\n240\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.880\nBecause things change, needs change.\n\n241\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.040\nSo that's quite a lot\nthere just to take in.\n\n242\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.470\nJust on one slide.\n\n243\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.270\nSo now we're gonna look\na little bit more in-depth, and\n\n244\n00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.450\nthis is why I say sometimes everybody\ndoes need a refresher from foundation.\n\n245\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.690\nBecause we've got a lot to learn.\n\n246\n00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:16.210\nSo let's take a look then, I talked about\nservices and about the idea of a service.\n\n247\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.310\nSo what is a service?\n\n248\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.698\nWell the definition of a service\nis up there in blue, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:20.698 --> 00:14:25.020\nAnd the ITIL definition of\na service from the publications,\n\n250\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:30.380\na service is a means of delivering value\nto customers by facilitating the outcomes\n\n251\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.370\nthat they want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n252\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.670\nSeems like a mouth full, doesn't it?\n\n253\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.140\nLet me break it down then.\n\n254\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.260\nA service is a means of delivering value.\n\n255\n00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:49.330\nThat's the first challenge\ncause value is perceived.\n\n256\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:55.266\nIf I was to go out and buy a car, well,\nMonty, let me ask you a question.\n\n257\n00:14:55.266 --> 00:14:57.007\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you were to go out and\n\n258\n00:14:57.007 --> 00:14:59.525\nbuy a car right now, bearing in mind,\n\n259\n00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:03.620\nthat I'm looking at this\ndefinition of a service.\n\n260\n00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:09.940\nAnd a service is a means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating outcomes.\n\n261\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.773\nSo, the outcome of a car that we want to\nfacilitate is to get from A to B, right?\n\n262\n00:15:13.773 --> 00:15:14.347\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n263\n00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:15.820\n&gt;&gt; That's the outcome.\n\n264\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.380\nSo, if you were to go and buy a car,\nwhat would you look for in a car?\n\n265\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.526\n&gt;&gt; If it's just to facilitate A to B?\n\n266\n00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:24.637\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n267\n00:15:24.637 --> 00:15:30.148\n&gt;&gt; It would probably be a very small and\neconomical car that's a manual driven car.\n\n268\n00:15:30.148 --> 00:15:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n269\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.222\nYou see whereas me,\nI come from Europe, you know?\n\n270\n00:15:36.222 --> 00:15:39.250\nWe have roads with no speed limit on them.\n\n271\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.060\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n272\n00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I want something quick,\nI want something that's going to handle.\n\n273\n00:15:44.494 --> 00:15:48.225\nI want something that's going\nto lose me my license probably.\n\n274\n00:15:48.225 --> 00:15:51.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But, I want something that's,\n\n275\n00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.979\nyeah, I'm with you on the manual.\n\n276\n00:15:53.979 --> 00:15:57.267\nYeah, so I can handle it around corners.\n\n277\n00:15:57.267 --> 00:15:59.426\nYeah, I'm gonna get myself into trouble.\n\n278\n00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:00.946\n[LAUGH] But ultimately,\n\n279\n00:16:00.946 --> 00:16:05.050\nwhat I value is completely\ndifferent to what you value, right?\n\n280\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Given the limitation of what you said,\njust to get from a to b, yes.\n\n281\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.930\nBut if I wanted to take that car and\n\n282\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.608\ndo other things with it,\nI might have chosen the same thing.\n\n283\n00:16:13.608 --> 00:16:15.397\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n284\n00:16:15.397 --> 00:16:17.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n285\n00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.570\nI still like to get from\na to b fast [LAUGH].\n\n286\n00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.265\n&gt;&gt; No, I understand.\n\n287\n00:16:22.265 --> 00:16:25.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You see the thing is,\nthat we know the outcome that we want to\n\n288\n00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.640\nfacilitate, but we all have\na different perception of value.\n\n289\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n290\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.610\n&gt;&gt; That's our first challenge straight\naway, is a means of delivering value.\n\n291\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.550\nAnd you can say okay,\nthen put this in the business perspective.\n\n292\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.760\nActually that's not too bad,\n\n293\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.910\nbecause everybody values\nthe same thing in business.\n\n294\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.880\nThat's not true at all.\n\n295\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.090\nWhat desktop picture do you\nhave on your laptop there?\n\n296\n00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.010\nIs it the one that you were given when\nyou were first given that laptop?\n\n297\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.230\n&gt;&gt; Probably, yes.\n\n298\n00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.840\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n300\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.546\nI can tell you that\nthis one isn't [LAUGH].\n\n301\n00:16:59.546 --> 00:17:01.594\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because we all change it,\n\n302\n00:17:01.594 --> 00:17:03.560\nwe all customize our desktop.\n\n303\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.000\nAnd so to say, that's okay in business,\nwe will value the same thing, we don't.\n\n304\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.020\nWe don't.\nI take a look at my keyboard right now,\n\n305\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.190\nand my keyboard, even though we\nhave exactly the same laptop,\n\n306\n00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.160\nmy keyboard looks completely\ndifferent to yours.\n\n307\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.060\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n308\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Because we both value\nthe different things, okay.\n\n309\n00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.644\nYou like yours exactly how\nit came out of the box,\n\n310\n00:17:25.644 --> 00:17:29.178\nwhereas I like mine\ncompletely different [LAUGH].\n\n311\n00:17:29.178 --> 00:17:31.620\nCompletely different, we've got\nto be a little bit colorful here.\n\n312\n00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n313\n00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.520\n&gt;&gt; So even in a business perspective,\nwe don't have the same concept of value.\n\n314\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.890\nWhat we can do though, we can understand\nthat we're delivering value to customers\n\n315\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.080\nand that in itself can be a challenge,\nokay.\n\n316\n00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.550\nBecause a customer is\nsomebody who buys a service.\n\n317\n00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.330\nNot a user,\na user is somebody who uses a service.\n\n318\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.640\nSo, let me ask you a question cuz I\nwanna ask you a lot of questions.\n\n319\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.770\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n&gt;&gt; When was the last time you went into\n\n320\n00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:09.350\na coffee shop, and\nbought a drink for someone?\n\n321\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.054\n&gt;&gt; The last time,\nit was probably close to two years ago.\n\n322\n00:18:12.054 --> 00:18:12.972\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n323\n00:18:12.972 --> 00:18:13.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n324\n00:18:13.754 --> 00:18:18.204\nwhen you go into that coffee shop and\nyou buy somebody a drink,\n\n325\n00:18:18.204 --> 00:18:23.356\nthe person behind the counter,\nare they interested in what you value?\n\n326\n00:18:23.356 --> 00:18:26.472\nOr are they interested in that person\nthat you bought the drink for,\n\n327\n00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:28.670\ndo they care whether they\nlike the drink or not?\n\n328\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.560\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that they would care,\nbut maybe they don't.\n\n329\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.120\nMaybe they just wanna sell it.\n\n330\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, see there's an assumption.\n\n331\n00:18:38.508 --> 00:18:41.590\nBecause you see,\nif you think about it from a user and\n\n332\n00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.290\ncustomer perspective, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:50.170\nIf I take somebody into a coffee shop,\nand I buy them a drink.\n\n334\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.780\nI expect that that coffee\nshop is probably only gonna\n\n335\n00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.760\ncare about getting that money out of me.\n\n336\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.630\nAnd not care about whether\nthe person I bought a drink for\n\n337\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.670\nis going to like it or not.\n\n338\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.320\nBut the simple fact is,\n\n339\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.380\nthat if the person that I bought\nthe drink for doesn't like it.\n\n340\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.210\nThen they're gonna turn around to me and\nsay, well,\n\n341\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.390\nwe're not going back there again,\nI don't like that place.\n\n342\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:14.190\nSo, users influence customer's decisions.\n\n343\n00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.517\nSo, even though we wanna\ndeliver value to customers,\n\n344\n00:19:18.517 --> 00:19:24.174\nwe're actually really concerned\nwith value perception of users too.\n\n345\n00:19:24.174 --> 00:19:24.731\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n346\n00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:28.833\n&gt;&gt; Because, if that person that I\nbought a drink for didn't like it,\n\n347\n00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:30.995\nthen we're not going back there.\n\n348\n00:19:30.995 --> 00:19:32.140\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n349\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.712\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I don't wanna listen to it.\n\n350\n00:19:33.712 --> 00:19:37.884\n[LAUGH] So, yeah,\nwe're not going back there.\n\n351\n00:19:37.884 --> 00:19:42.070\nSo we talk then about delivering value\nto customers, not forgetting owners.\n\n352\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.839\nBy facilitating the outcomes\nthat they want to achieve,\n\n353\n00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:47.807\nfacilitating the outcomes.\n\n354\n00:19:47.807 --> 00:19:52.390\nWe cannot achieve their outcomes for them,\nthey have gotta put some input into this.\n\n355\n00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.400\nSo we want to facilitate outcomes.\n\n356\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.250\nSo we're not going to type your emails for\nyou.\n\n357\n00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.670\nWe can't do that, okay?\n\n358\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.510\nWhat we can do is we can give you\nthe ability to send and receive email, but\n\n359\n00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.010\nyou've gotta type that out yourself.\n\n360\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:11.100\nAnd you've gotta send that email, and\nyou've gotta read the emails that come in.\n\n361\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.170\nSo we're gonna do all that for you.\n\n362\n00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:17.370\nBut then, we want to facilitate\nthat outcome for you, but\n\n363\n00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:23.330\nwithout transferring to you\nspecific costs and risks.\n\n364\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.180\nA service is made up of components.\n\n365\n00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.870\nAnd out of those components, we consider\nthings like software, and hardware,\n\n366\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.010\nand environmental aspects.\n\n367\n00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.050\nAnd the people that support the services,\nand the people that implement the service,\n\n368\n00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.290\nand the infrastructure, and\ndocumentation, as well.\n\n369\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.059\nThese are all components of a service.\n\n370\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.490\nNow without any single one of those\ncomponents, that service would not exist.\n\n371\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:52.060\nBut if you consider that we\nwould have to actually work out\n\n372\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:57.125\nthe specific cost of each one of those\ncomponents to each individual customer for\n\n373\n00:20:57.125 --> 00:21:00.235\neach individual service,\nthat's a lot of effort.\n\n374\n00:21:00.235 --> 00:21:00.807\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n375\n00:21:00.807 --> 00:21:02.749\nwe're not gonna transfer\nthose specific costs to you.\n\n376\n00:21:02.749 --> 00:21:04.586\nWe might charge you a nominal fee, but\n\n377\n00:21:04.586 --> 00:21:07.177\nwe're not gonna transfer\nthe specific costs to you.\n\n378\n00:21:07.177 --> 00:21:12.197\nAnd for the same reason, when I'm\ngonna transfer specific risks to you.\n\n379\n00:21:12.197 --> 00:21:15.217\nIdeally, what we want to\ndo is deliver a service is\n\n380\n00:21:15.217 --> 00:21:17.847\ngoing to allow you to\nimprove your performance.\n\n381\n00:21:17.847 --> 00:21:23.940\nAnd reduce any constraints that you might\nfeel, whilst achieving that outcome.\n\n382\n00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.450\nAnd that outcome being as it says there,\nthe intended or\n\n383\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:33.180\nactual result of carrying out an activity,\nover on the right hand side of that slide.\n\n384\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.390\nSo what about service management, then?\n\n385\n00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:40.145\nWell, service management, which is ITIL\nas a framework for service management.\n\n386\n00:21:40.145 --> 00:21:44.855\nService management is a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities for providing\n\n387\n00:21:44.855 --> 00:21:49.465\nvalue to customers in the form of goods or\nservices, as it says in the ITIL books.\n\n388\n00:21:52.293 --> 00:21:55.060\nIt's couple words I wanna bring out there.\n\n389\n00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.820\nAnd that is,\nspecialized organizational capability.\n\n390\n00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.180\nAll right, three words, not a couple.\n\n391\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.840\nSo, we've got to have the specialism,\nin other words,\n\n392\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.610\nwe don't just need broad experience,\nwe need specialist experience.\n\n393\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.210\nWe also need to be organized.\n\n394\n00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.800\nYeah, if we're disorganized,\nif there's absolute chaos going on in\n\n395\n00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.980\nour IT organization, then, unfortunately,\nit's not an IT organization.\n\n396\n00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.590\nIt's an IT disorganization, and\nwe're never gonna deliver value.\n\n397\n00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.790\nBut, we've gotta be capable, too.\n\n398\n00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.422\nYet we've got to have the right\ncapabilities to be able to deliver those\n\n399\n00:22:32.422 --> 00:22:34.880\nservices, okay?\n\n400\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.690\nSo, we've got to take what we consider\nto be an asset, our resources and\n\n401\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.970\nour capabilities, and\n\n402\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:47.560\ntransform them into something that\nwill deliver valuable services.\n\n403\n00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.220\nOur tangible capabilities, our resources\nare things that we can touch and feel.\n\n404\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.870\nSo things like money, something tangible.\n\n405\n00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.410\nOur hardware is something tangible.\n\n406\n00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.660\nOur software is something tangible.\n\n407\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.570\nAnd people in terms of bombs on seats,\nare tangible as well.\n\n408\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.770\nThese are things that we can touch and\nfeel.\n\n409\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.140\nDon't go touching and\nfeeling people too much, though.\n\n410\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.685\nWe end up in court, all right?\n\n411\n00:23:11.685 --> 00:23:12.570\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, true.\n\n412\n00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.500\n&gt;&gt; Just warning on that one [LAUGH].\n\n413\n00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.000\nAnd then we've got our capabilities,\n\n414\n00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.110\ntoo, because we can't just have\nbombs on seats, as we would call it.\n\n415\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.030\nThey've gotta have the right skills.\n\n416\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.170\nAnd so our capabilities encompass\nthings like intangible assets.\n\n417\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.650\nThings that we have to have,\nthat are an asset to the organization, but\n\n418\n00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.640\nthat are very, very difficult to quantify,\nsuch as experience.\n\n419\n00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.444\nSuch as the way that we're organized,\neven who our management are.\n\n420\n00:23:38.444 --> 00:23:43.697\nIf our management are, how should I say,\nif they disorganize themselves,\n\n421\n00:23:43.697 --> 00:23:48.389\nor perhaps we've got interpersonal\nconflict in some of our teams.\n\n422\n00:23:48.389 --> 00:23:52.905\nThen we're not going to be able to\ndeliver efficient and effective services.\n\n423\n00:23:52.905 --> 00:23:54.770\nAll right?\n\n424\n00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.276\nSo service management is\nall about implementing and\n\n425\n00:23:58.276 --> 00:24:01.150\nmanaging those quality services, okay?\n\n426\n00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:06.910\nWe have to ensure that the customer\nreceives a service that they value.\n\n427\n00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.550\nAnd that it performs at\na level that they expect, and\n\n428\n00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.630\nto a cost that they expect too.\n\n429\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.788\nSo here we are in then in IT, and\n\n430\n00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:21.005\nwe are what is considered\nto be a service provider.\n\n431\n00:24:21.005 --> 00:24:25.300\nAnd we have three different\ntypes of service provider.\n\n432\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.239\nWe have a service provider that\nis internal to the business unit.\n\n433\n00:24:29.239 --> 00:24:33.671\nWe have a service provider that\noperates in a shared services unit.\n\n434\n00:24:33.671 --> 00:24:37.837\nSo internal to the organization but\nserves many business unit.\n\n435\n00:24:37.837 --> 00:24:42.732\nAnd then we have a TYPE III as we call it,\nwhich is an external service provider.\n\n436\n00:24:42.732 --> 00:24:45.790\nAnd that is somebody who\nis completely external.\n\n437\n00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.180\nOutsourced, we like to say.\n\n438\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.530\nCompletely external to the organization.\n\n439\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.610\nSo within our service provider\norganization and within our business,\n\n440\n00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.400\nwe have what we call stake holders.\n\n441\n00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:08.630\nA stakeholder is defined as any interested\nparty, not just financial interest.\n\n442\n00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:14.086\nBiggest mistake that I think that we\nmake here, although I have to say that\n\n443\n00:25:14.086 --> 00:25:20.084\nwe have had discussions in other sessions\nabout the nuances between languages.\n\n444\n00:25:20.084 --> 00:25:24.071\nAnd there is an inference that\nstakeholder in certain cultures means\n\n445\n00:25:24.071 --> 00:25:28.277\nit's somebody who has a financial\ninterest, but that's not the case.\n\n446\n00:25:28.277 --> 00:25:31.923\nWe're talking about anybody\nthat's had an interest.\n\n447\n00:25:31.923 --> 00:25:33.531\nI hate to say this, but\n\n448\n00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:38.297\neven my nosy neighbor is considered\nto be a stakeholder in my life.\n\n449\n00:25:38.297 --> 00:25:42.996\nCuz she definitely has an interest\nin everything that we do.\n\n450\n00:25:42.996 --> 00:25:47.356\nSo we got stakeholders within our internal\nservice provider such as functions,\n\n451\n00:25:47.356 --> 00:25:50.832\nthese groups of people and\nwe'll talk a little more about them.\n\n452\n00:25:50.832 --> 00:25:55.648\nAnd the groups and teams, and\nwe've got people outside service provider\n\n453\n00:25:55.648 --> 00:26:00.470\norganisation, such as customers and\nusers and their suppliers.\n\n454\n00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.560\nAnd they're all stakeholders too, okay?\n\n455\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.220\nSo stakeholder is any interested party.\n\n456\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.940\nYou'll notice that what we're doing is\nwe're just going over a lot at the moment.\n\n457\n00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.060\nWe're going over a lot of the terms and\n\n458\n00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.020\nthe definitions that we\nlearned in foundation class.\n\n459\n00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.190\nHere's another term and definition\nthat we learned in foundation class\n\n460\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.750\nis the concept of both internal and\nexternal services.\n\n461\n00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:34.180\nAnd an internal service is a service that\nwe provide internally to our organization.\n\n462\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.610\nAnd an external service is a service\nthat we provide externally\n\n463\n00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.520\nto external customers.\n\n464\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.820\nSo an internal service would be something,\nand I use examples like SAP or\n\n465\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:49.020\nlike our email services,\nsomething internal to our organization.\n\n466\n00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.862\nBut then an external service is\nsomething that our customers use,\n\n467\n00:26:52.862 --> 00:26:54.927\nsuch as the websites for instance.\n\n468\n00:26:54.927 --> 00:26:56.977\nOr external service catalogues,\n\n469\n00:26:56.977 --> 00:27:02.280\nif we're in an industry where we are\nselling goods externally to our customers.\n\n470\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.543\nSo you will see here from this particular\nslide that over on the left hand side,\n\n471\n00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:11.156\ninternal services are delivered\nto business units.\n\n472\n00:27:11.156 --> 00:27:17.140\nAnd then in turn, use those to deliver\na service to external customers.\n\n473\n00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:22.160\nAnd then on the right hand side,\nwe have services like our Internet that\n\n474\n00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:28.460\nare delivered directly through\nour external customers, okay?\n\n475\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.910\nOn the next slide, there's just\nreally a little bit of an example of\n\n476\n00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:40.110\ncore services, enabling services,\nand enhancing services, okay?\n\n477\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.320\nWhich is just further classification\nof our services to be honest.\n\n478\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.431\nWe split our services down, believe it or\nnot, into those that are core.\n\n479\n00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:51.877\nThose that are enabling services and\nthose that are enhancing services.\n\n480\n00:27:51.877 --> 00:27:56.374\nNow we've got pizza delivery example\nup there on the screen in front of you.\n\n481\n00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:59.520\nI wanna give you an IT example for\ninstance.\n\n482\n00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.780\nSo let's think about our email service.\n\n483\n00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:09.508\nSo the core service in an email\nservice is that ability to send and\n\n484\n00:28:09.508 --> 00:28:12.760\nreceive email, that's our core service.\n\n485\n00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.395\nNow, the enabling service is a service\nthat's a service in its own right.\n\n486\n00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:21.640\nBut that underpins the core service,\nand that would be our infrastructure.\n\n487\n00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.400\nIt's a service in its own right, but\n\n488\n00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.580\nwithout it, email is not going to\nbe able to be sent or received.\n\n489\n00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.960\nAnd then an enhancing\nservice is an optional extra.\n\n490\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.222\nSomething that we can do that maybe\nsets up apart from our competitors or\n\n491\n00:28:37.222 --> 00:28:39.433\nsomething that we just choose to do.\n\n492\n00:28:39.433 --> 00:28:41.463\nIt's optional for our business, and\n\n493\n00:28:41.463 --> 00:28:45.160\nthat would be something like\na shared calendar for instance.\n\n494\n00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.694\nOkay, so\nsomething that is an optional extra.\n\n495\n00:28:47.694 --> 00:28:55.172\nThat's our shared directory, shared\ncalendar is the word I'm looking for.\n\n496\n00:28:55.172 --> 00:28:59.279\nOkay, so these are our core and\nour enabling and our enhancing services.\n\n497\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:06.310\nNow I asked you about value\na little earlier on and\n\n498\n00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:09.460\nabout what we perceive as value.\n\n499\n00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.897\nSo I'm just gonna wrap up this\nsection by going over a couple\n\n500\n00:29:13.897 --> 00:29:17.641\nof slides that look over\nthe definition of value.\n\n501\n00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:22.191\nNow, you will see that in the bottom\nof this particular slide right\n\n502\n00:29:22.191 --> 00:29:23.960\nin front of you now.\n\n503\n00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:30.089\nYou will see that the diagram that you\nsaw in your ITIL Foundation class.\n\n504\n00:29:30.089 --> 00:29:33.344\nAnd that is that diagram that always\nlooks very, very complicated.\n\n505\n00:29:33.344 --> 00:29:36.914\nAnd everybody always says to me,\nhow am I supposed to remember this?\n\n506\n00:29:36.914 --> 00:29:39.945\nWell, it's really easy\nbecause you just need\n\n507\n00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:43.450\nto remember the concept of the utility and\nwarranty.\n\n508\n00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.944\nSo the concept of utility is very,\nvery simply,\n\n509\n00:29:47.944 --> 00:29:50.539\ndoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n510\n00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:52.478\nThat's its fitness for purpose.\n\n511\n00:29:52.478 --> 00:29:55.081\nDoes that service send and receive email?\n\n512\n00:29:55.081 --> 00:29:56.001\nYes, it does.\n\n513\n00:29:56.001 --> 00:29:57.807\nOkay, then it has utility.\n\n514\n00:29:57.807 --> 00:30:02.215\nAnd you can have a web based email\nservice that will do exactly that for\n\n515\n00:30:02.215 --> 00:30:04.422\nyou, it will deliver that email.\n\n516\n00:30:04.422 --> 00:30:08.498\nBut can I ask you in a business\nperspective then Ronnie,\n\n517\n00:30:08.498 --> 00:30:13.444\nwould a web based email deliver you\nlevels of security that you would\n\n518\n00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:16.327\nfeel comfortable with, do you think?\n\n519\n00:30:16.327 --> 00:30:18.509\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not necessarily,\n\n520\n00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:24.171\nespecially if I'm actually using\na public provider and not my own.\n\n521\n00:30:24.171 --> 00:30:28.259\nAs far as a portal that allows me\naccess just inside of my own network.\n\n522\n00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:33.449\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, so what you're saying\nis then, in effect, is that that\n\n523\n00:30:33.449 --> 00:30:39.690\nservice provides utility, which it doe,\nbut it doesn't provide warranty aspect.\n\n524\n00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.380\nAnd if we look at the warranty aspect,\n\n525\n00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.668\nyou will see that those warranty\naspects are availability,\n\n526\n00:30:46.668 --> 00:30:51.642\ncapacity, security, which is one\nthat I mentioned and continuity.\n\n527\n00:30:51.642 --> 00:30:57.926\nAnd so both utility and warranty have to\nexist in order for us to perceive value.\n\n528\n00:30:57.926 --> 00:31:01.292\nSo let's go through\nthose warranty aspects.\n\n529\n00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:03.943\nIs there service available enough?\n\n530\n00:31:03.943 --> 00:31:10.793\nWell okay, an Internet based webmail\nservice might be available enough.\n\n531\n00:31:10.793 --> 00:31:12.590\nBut does it have it enough capacity?\n\n532\n00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:18.260\nGuarantee when you try and some files,\nit'll tell you that they're too big.\n\n533\n00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.622\nDoes it have continuity?\n\n534\n00:31:19.622 --> 00:31:23.410\nWell it might do, but\nwe don't have any assurance of that.\n\n535\n00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:27.490\nAnd that's the key thing about warranty,\nis that we have assurance.\n\n536\n00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.217\nAnd we certainly don't have\nany assurance for security.\n\n537\n00:31:31.217 --> 00:31:36.430\nSo you see both utility and warranty\nneed to exist for us to perceive value.\n\n538\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.356\nIt's not just good enough for\n\n539\n00:31:38.356 --> 00:31:41.833\nus to have a service that does\nwhat it says on the card.\n\n540\n00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:44.819\nWe've got to be able to use it as well.\n\n541\n00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:46.187\nAnd this next slide,\n\n542\n00:31:46.187 --> 00:31:51.090\nwhich is something that I'm going\nto use to wrap up this session.\n\n543\n00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:56.230\nIf you look, the utility effect\nin that bottom left hand corner\n\n544\n00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:01.030\nis all about increasing\nthe probability and\n\n545\n00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:05.440\nmaintaining that probability\nof that service working.\n\n546\n00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.736\nIn other words,\n\n547\n00:32:06.736 --> 00:32:12.487\nthat service will do what it says on\nthe card without a shadow of the doubt.\n\n548\n00:32:12.487 --> 00:32:18.129\nBut the warranty effect has to\nactually decrease varriances and\n\n549\n00:32:18.129 --> 00:32:23.891\navailability and in capacity and\nin continuity and in security.\n\n550\n00:32:23.891 --> 00:32:29.387\nBecause what we actually want to do is we\nwant to ensure that we have all of those.\n\n551\n00:32:29.387 --> 00:32:33.479\nSo we want to decrease,\nwe want to decrease\n\n552\n00:32:33.479 --> 00:32:37.924\nthe uncertainty of\nproviding those aspects.\n\n553\n00:32:37.924 --> 00:32:41.761\nAs we've said,\nwe have got to have both utility and\n\n554\n00:32:41.761 --> 00:32:45.428\nwarranty in order for\nanyone to perceive value.\n\n555\n00:32:45.428 --> 00:32:49.991\nSo for now, we're going to wrap\nup this particular session,\n\n556\n00:32:49.991 --> 00:32:53.869\nwhich is part one of our\nrecap over ITIL Foundation.\n\n557\n00:32:53.869 --> 00:32:57.924\nAnd in our next section, we're going\nto look further into our assets and\n\n558\n00:32:57.924 --> 00:33:00.461\ninto our resources and capabilities, etc.\n\n559\n00:33:00.461 --> 00:33:06.766\nAnd we're also going to look at processes\nand we're going to look at rolls and\n\n560\n00:33:06.766 --> 00:33:11.720\nwe're going to look at all of\nour responsibilities etc too.\n\n561\n00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.682\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\n\n562\n00:33:13.682 --> 00:33:16.006\nhelping us out with this\npart of the refresher.\n\n563\n00:33:16.006 --> 00:33:20.191\nThere's a lot more for us to cover, but\nthat means we're gonna go ahead and\n\n564\n00:33:20.191 --> 00:33:21.533\nend this episode then.\n\n565\n00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:25.822\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n566\n00:33:25.822 --> 00:33:27.130\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n567\n00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:31.896\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here, for\nanother ITIL Foundation Refresher.\n\n568\n00:33:31.896 --> 00:33:37.977\n[MUSIC]\n\n569\n00:33:37.977 --> 00:33:44.819\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.518\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:12.373\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.373 --> 00:00:15.070\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.520\nYou're watching the ITIL Foundation\nRefresher for your intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.560\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\nwe're taking a look at another foundation\n\n8\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.320\nrefresher, a part two to help us to\nround out those skills that we need.\n\n9\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.640\nAnd here to help us of course is going\nto be our ITIL virtuoso, Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.230\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.790\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.890\nHow are you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.659\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, taking look and\n\n14\n00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.191\nremembering all those different terms\nthat I've seen in the foundation and\n\n15\n00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:49.812\nnow getting those things kind of brought\nback up has really starting to help.\n\n16\n00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:52.470\nSo what do we actually have left to do,\nwhere are we gonna begin?\n\n17\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's, this foundation\nmaterial that we're recapping over,\n\n18\n00:00:56.865 --> 00:00:58.610\nthere's so much information-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n19\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.170\n&gt;&gt; To absorb, so much information.\n\n20\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.265\nAnd trust me, you're not the only one.\n\n21\n00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:07.463\nBecause we have delegates that\nleave foundation class and\n\n22\n00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:11.834\nthe feedback that they'll give\nyou sometimes is that whoa,\n\n23\n00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:14.928\nit's just so much information to absorb.\n\n24\n00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:18.877\nAnd it really is, and the unfortunate\nthing is that we have to get through\n\n25\n00:01:18.877 --> 00:01:23.346\nthe foundation, you have to understand all\nof the concepts in the foundation to be\n\n26\n00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:25.910\nable to then delve deeper\ninto the processes.\n\n27\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.640\nAnd until we can understand really what\na process is, or really what a functional\n\n28\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.060\narea is and what a role should do,\nthen it's difficult to apply that concept.\n\n29\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.660\nAnd so\nwhat we're learning here is concepts.\n\n30\n00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.935\nAnd I will admit that\nthere is a lot to learn.\n\n31\n00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, so\n\n32\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.030\njust take us a little bit through\nwhat we reviewed last time and\n\n33\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.750\nthen where we're going to\nbe heading from there.\n\n34\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo in part one,\n\n35\n00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.510\nwe actually looked at\nthe concept of a service.\n\n36\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.220\nAnd the concept of a service is,\n\n37\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.080\na service is a means of delivering value\nby facilitating the outcomes that our\n\n38\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.730\ncustomers want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n39\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.440\nNow, you know value is perceived.\n\n40\n00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.880\nAs I mentioned, we all have\na different perception of value and\n\n41\n00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.460\neven in a business environment our\nperception of value is still different.\n\n42\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.590\nNo matter how much we\nwould like to try and\n\n43\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.250\ndeliver a one size fits all\napproach to our services,\n\n44\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.590\nto our businesses, we can't do\nthat because value is perceived.\n\n45\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.410\nSo we looked at that and we looked\nat the fact that service management,\n\n46\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.890\nwhich ITIL is a framework is a set of\nspecialized organizational capabilities\n\n47\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.410\nfor delivering value to customers\nin the form of goods or services.\n\n48\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.040\nNow I know that I just rattled off two\ndescriptions, two definitions to you.\n\n49\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.440\nAnd now that's made me\nlook like a bit of a nerd.\n\n50\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.270\n[LAUGH] I'm fully aware of that, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.160\nAnd we also looked at the concept of\nvalue being broken down into utility and\n\n52\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.290\nwarranty and\n\n53\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.570\nthe fact that it's not just about us\nbeing able to do what it says on the can.\n\n54\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.970\nWe've gotta be able to send and receive\nemail but we've gotta do it in a way that\n\n55\n00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.610\nwe can assure our customers of\nlevels of utility and warranty and\n\n56\n00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.620\navailability and capacity and\nservice continuity and security.\n\n57\n00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.550\nSo we're gonna need both that utility and\n\n58\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.320\nwarranty to be present in order for\nthem to perceive value.\n\n59\n00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.010\nAnd so in this particular section we're\ngonna start off just by going over\n\n60\n00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.860\nwhat our service assets were.\n\n61\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.820\nI mentioned them very,\nvery briefly in the last section about\n\n62\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.390\ntangible and our intangible assets and\nhow we use those to deliver our services.\n\n63\n00:03:45.572 --> 00:03:48.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go ahead and begin, then.\n\n64\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.440\nSo where are we picking up from there?\n\n65\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.230\n&gt;&gt; So as I said,\nwe begin with our service assets and\n\n66\n00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.680\nour assets are what we use\nwithin our organization to\n\n67\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.098\ndeliver value by way of goods or\nservices, as we say.\n\n68\n00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:07.135\nAnd an asset is described there,\nyou've got some definitions there.\n\n69\n00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:10.540\nAn asset is defined as a resource or\na capability.\n\n70\n00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.540\nAnd a resource is what we\nconsider to be a tangible asset,\n\n71\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.250\nsomething that you touch and feel.\n\n72\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.780\nSuch as, as mentioned there,\nmoney, our infrastructure itself,\n\n73\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.960\nthe software that we have, the actual\ndata that we have, our hardware.\n\n74\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.650\nThese are tangible assets.\n\n75\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.750\nYou'll notice that people span\nboth capabilities and resources.\n\n76\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.030\nSo then our tangible assets,\nsomething that you can touch and feel.\n\n77\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.620\nBut I gave you that warning\nin that first section.\n\n78\n00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.310\nDon't you do that too much.\n\n79\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.000\nAnd then [LAUGH] and\npeople are also intangible assets.\n\n80\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.150\nAnd you know what,\nunder the intangible assets,\n\n81\n00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.450\nsoft assets as they mention\nthere our capabilities.\n\n82\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.240\nWe've got things like how we're managed,\nwho manages us?\n\n83\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.900\nWe've got the organization itself,\nhow well organized we are.\n\n84\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.750\nIf there's complete chaos going on then\nwe're never gonna be able to deliver value\n\n85\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.800\nto our customers, are we?\n\n86\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.820\nOur processes have to be efficient and\neffective.\n\n87\n00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.710\nAnd if our processes don't do\nwhat they're supposed to do and\n\n88\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.450\nthey're not efficient and\nthey're not effective, then you know what?\n\n89\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.260\nThey're not going to deliver value\nto our business, to our users and\n\n90\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.735\nthen our knowledge.\n\n91\n00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:24.160\nAnd, that underneath people,\nwe've got experience and skills, too.\n\n92\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.931\nAnd knowledge can be quantified.\n\n93\n00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:30.175\nWe should document our knowledge.\n\n94\n00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:34.105\nAnd then it becomes information that we\ncan put into our knowledge management\n\n95\n00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:39.085\nsystem, so a knowledge though is\nalso our experience and our skills.\n\n96\n00:05:39.085 --> 00:05:41.325\nAnd believe it or not, our attitude and\n\n97\n00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:45.027\nattitude fall under these soft assets,\nthe capabilities.\n\n98\n00:05:45.027 --> 00:05:48.855\nLike morale,\nI expect to see morale in there as well,\n\n99\n00:05:48.855 --> 00:05:53.619\nwhich is why as we've moved through\nthe service operation class,\n\n100\n00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:59.339\nyou'll see that we put a huge emphasis on\npeople and on morale and on attitudes.\n\n101\n00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.307\nAnd on understanding sort of\norganizational change management and\n\n102\n00:06:03.307 --> 00:06:07.832\nthe people aspect because our people\nare what's going to enable us to deliver\n\n103\n00:06:07.832 --> 00:06:12.740\nvalue, but they're also what's going to\nhinder us from delivering value, too.\n\n104\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.480\nLook at our soft skills,\n\n105\n00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.560\nlook at our capabilities there and\nhow well we are organized.\n\n106\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.190\nWell, that is, worst it might be,\nyou might consider it to be\n\n107\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.570\ndriven by management cuz management\nset our organizational structures.\n\n108\n00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.538\nBut it's also driven by people,\n\n109\n00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:33.950\ntoo as to how collaborative they\nare within that organizational.\n\n110\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.620\nAnd think about management.\n\n111\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.240\nI know I asked you.\n\n112\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.680\nI put you on the spot last time,\ndidn't I, Ronnie?\n\n113\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.820\nI said to you do you get on with\nyour managers all the time?\n\n114\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.080\nAnd the simple fact of the matter\nis there are always going\n\n115\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.482\nto be interpersonal conflicts.\n\n116\n00:06:48.482 --> 00:06:54.250\nThere are always going to be interpersonal\nissues and so we've got to accept that.\n\n117\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.900\nThat even if we've got good management,\n\n118\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.570\nthen there may be\ninterpersonal issues there.\n\n119\n00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.860\nAnd certainly, I know that we've\nall worked in environments where\n\n120\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.280\nthere may be a siloed\nmentality between teams.\n\n121\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.230\nAnd it doesn't matter how\ngood our processes are.\n\n122\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.730\nIf our people do not have\nthe right attitude or\n\n123\n00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.440\ndon't have the right experience to\nbe able to follow those processes,\n\n124\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.570\nthen they're never gonna deliver value.\n\n125\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.020\nIt's really as simple as that,\nso people are very,\n\n126\n00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.630\nvery important to this,\nincredibly important.\n\n127\n00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.870\nSo I mentioned processes.\n\n128\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.240\nWell, let's take a look at a process.\n\n129\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.920\nI have mentioned in other sessions\nthat we look at in service operations,\n\n130\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.520\nthat a process is a set\nof structured activities,\n\n131\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.630\ndesigned to accomplish\na specific objective.\n\n132\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.610\nAnd it takes an input and\nturns it into an output.\n\n133\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.042\nAnd I think I remember I've said that, and\n\n134\n00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:50.891\nwe've had that [LAUGH] discussion before,\nokay?\n\n135\n00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:55.245\nSo we are looking to deliver\nvalue to our organization by\n\n136\n00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:57.753\nfacilitating their outcomes.\n\n137\n00:07:57.753 --> 00:08:02.795\nWe can't achieve their outcomes for\nthem, but we can facilitate So, we\n\n138\n00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:08.440\nwant to facilitate this in this processes\nwhich leads to business outcomes.\n\n139\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.920\nAnd we will use our processes in order\nto support the services that we deliver.\n\n140\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.180\nAnd exactly as it says\non the next slide there.\n\n141\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.620\nSupporting business processes.\n\n142\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.140\nSo, we use your IT processes\nto support business processes.\n\n143\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.120\nNow, processes have four characteristics\nand they're written there.\n\n144\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.859\nA process has to be measurable.\n\n145\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.370\nI know that it's something that\nI've mentioned before, but\n\n146\n00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.520\nbecause I think so,\nis not a good enough measurement, okay.\n\n147\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.180\nWe have to have tangible\nmetrics that tell us\n\n148\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.390\nwhether the process is delivering value or\nnot.\n\n149\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.520\nWhether the process is effective or\ninefficient.\n\n150\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.730\nA process has to deliver\na specific result,\n\n151\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.099\nwe have to know what that process is\ndelivering, it has to be defined.\n\n152\n00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.250\nAnd it has to delay to\nthat result to a customer.\n\n153\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.820\nNow, a customer was stakeholder.\n\n154\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.010\nI like to use that one because sometimes,\nit's not always that customers that\n\n155\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:11.460\nare raising particular processes\nall that triggering processes.\n\n156\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.790\nIf I think of incident management, would\nyou see the ability to restore service\n\n157\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.640\noperation It's not always customers\nthat raise incidence who uses, but\n\n158\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.070\nit could be internal IT people as well.\n\n159\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.450\nSo, I like to use the word\nstakeholder in there,\n\n160\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.580\nas well we deliver the specific\nresult to a customer or stakeholder,\n\n161\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.180\nbut more importantly at the bottom\nthere responding to specific event or\n\n162\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.580\nprocess have to store somewhere,\nSome thing's got to start them off, okay.\n\n163\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.500\nSo, we call that a trigger,\na trigger to a process.\n\n164\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.840\nNow, this next diagram that's coming up,\nwe're gonna spend a little bit of time on\n\n165\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:53.220\nthis because I absolutely love\nthis diagram, I really, really do.\n\n166\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.590\nAnd yet everybody tells me when they\nlook at it, they say, my goodness Joy,\n\n167\n00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:01.340\nthat looks so messy and yet it really,\nreally explains what a process is now I've\n\n168\n00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.590\nmentioned that a process\nwill start off with, well,\n\n169\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.080\ntaking an input and\nturning it into a defined output.\n\n170\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.860\nOkay, so what we're going to do\nis we're gonna start off with\n\n171\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.970\nin the top righthand corner here as you\ncan see my arrow the process objectives.\n\n172\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:25.240\nAnd I am going to use incident management\nas an example here and the objective of\n\n173\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.660\nincident management is to restore normal\nservice operation as quickly as possible.\n\n174\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.400\nSo, that means then that\nthe process output then,\n\n175\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.410\nwhat do you think that is Ronnie?\n\n176\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.650\nIf the objective is to restore\nnormal service operation\n\n177\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.760\nwhat do you think the output\nto the process is?\n\n178\n00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.940\nIs that the process gets restored?\n\n179\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat the service gets restored.\n\n180\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThe service gets restored.\n\n181\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.130\n&gt;&gt; So, the output is a fixed surface.\n\n182\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Right. Okay. Sure\n&gt;&gt; It's been repaired.\n\n183\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:53.750\nOkay.\n\n184\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.920\nSo, if the output here and\nprocess output is something fixed.\n\n185\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.260\nAnd what do you think the input is?\n\n186\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Something that is maybe not fixed.\n\n187\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.880\nSomething broken.\n\n188\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.470\n&gt;&gt; Something broken?\n\n189\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.095\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n190\n00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:07.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what we do then,\n\n191\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.790\nif you notice, okay, we've got the first\nthree steps of defining a process.\n\n192\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just worked out there and then.\n\n193\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.470\nSo we started off in this top right-hand\ncorner with our process objectives, and\n\n194\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.880\nthen, we looked at our process output,\n\n195\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.410\nwhich was something broken, and\nthe inputs, something fixed.\n\n196\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:30.140\nAnd here in this middle box we've got\nall of the actual process itself.\n\n197\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.240\nWe've got the activities and\nthe procedures and\n\n198\n00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.230\nthe work instructions that will\nget us from broken to fixed.\n\n199\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.570\nNow, it will get us from here to here.\n\n200\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.770\nWe also have identified here,\nwhat we call process roles.\n\n201\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.740\nThese are what roles and\n\n202\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.420\nwhat skills we need,\nin order to get off from broken to fix.\n\n203\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.790\nWe also have process matrix and\n\n204\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.870\nthat will tell us whether we\nare getting from broken to fix.\n\n205\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:06.100\nNow, we'll have a policy and a here in\nthis process control box at the top\n\n206\n00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.460\nwe've got this policy that\ntells us what our ethics are.\n\n207\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.070\nWhat our way of working is and\nhow we're going to do it.\n\n208\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.440\nBecause I just mention\nincident management but\n\n209\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.400\ndon't forget we do this for\nevery single process.\n\n210\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.450\nAnd we have a defined process\nowner somebody who takes\n\n211\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.020\nownership of that process, and\nwho ensures that process is documented.\n\n212\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.730\nNow, I want to bring you down to here\nwhere it says process improvements.\n\n213\n00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:37.980\nNotice that we have an arrow going\ndirectly from our outputs to feedback.\n\n214\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.520\nAnd that's what we called\nour feedback loop, and\n\n215\n00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.030\na feedback then comes down and\ncomes into processed improvements.\n\n216\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.021\nIn other words, so when we use tool\nservice we're gonna conduct a.\n\n217\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.910\nSurvey hopefully,\n\n218\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.380\nwait our customers to see whether they\nhave actually had their service restored.\n\n219\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.150\nAnd we also conduct a lessons learn,\nwhat work well?\n\n220\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.010\nAnd we'll use that to improve\nour process in the future.\n\n221\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.870\nWe also conduct the lessons learn\nwith what didn't work so well too.\n\n222\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.420\nAnd we use that to improve\nagain in the future.\n\n223\n00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.520\nNow, let's bring you down to this\nblue box at the bottom here, and\n\n224\n00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.180\nyou'll notice you see two\nfamiliar words in here.\n\n225\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.250\nThe words resources and capabilities.\n\n226\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.230\nSo these are the people, and\nthe tools, and the experience, and\n\n227\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.860\nthe hardware, and the PCs,\netc., that they use in\n\n228\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.080\norder to get us from something\nbroken to something fixed.\n\n229\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.801\nNow, there's one thing\nthat I haven't mentioned.\n\n230\n00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:43.460\nAnd that's this.\n\n231\n00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.930\nThe trigger.\n\n232\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.050\nAnd I said to you that every\nprocess has to have a trigger.\n\n233\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.520\nSomething that starts it off.\n\n234\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.320\nIncident management doesn't just happen.\n\n235\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.630\nSo, that trigger could be something like.\n\n236\n00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.860\nAn event that's occurred that's been\nnotified to us through event management.\n\n237\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.470\nAnd they automatically raised a trigger.\n\n238\n00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.410\nAutomatically raised an incident, sorry.\n\n239\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.740\nWell that trigger could be someone called\nin the service desk, or somebody picking\n\n240\n00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:16.180\nup their cell phone and logging a call\nvia the app to raise an incident, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.390\nThat's the trigger.\n\n242\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.480\nAnd all processes have to have a trigger.\n\n243\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.420\nAlthough some those\ntriggers can be automated.\n\n244\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.450\nOkay, so a function or\na functional area as we like to call it.\n\n245\n00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.620\nWell, let's go back to\nthat previous slide, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.640\nAnd that previous slide, we have this\nblue box and that blue box represented\n\n247\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.780\nthe resources and the capabilities that\nwe needed to undertake the process Well,\n\n248\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.840\nwe have what we call teams of people,\ngroups of people, we call them functions.\n\n249\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.750\nAnd we use those functions to\ncarry out those processes.\n\n250\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.920\nIn other words, that blue box represents\nthe role of our functional areas.\n\n251\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:02.630\nAnd we can structure our functions into\ngroups, teams, departments, and divisions.\n\n252\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.880\nWe can do whatever we want in regards to\nthe structure of our IT organization.\n\n253\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.800\nRemember, we've got to deliver\nvalue to our organization, and so\n\n254\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.120\nit really is down to us, how we structure\nourselves to deliver that value.\n\n255\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.260\nIs not a prescription.\n\n256\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.600\nIt's not a one size fits all pill that's\ngoing to resolve any issues that you might\n\n257\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.470\nhave within IT.\n\n258\n00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:29.130\nAnd, it's certainly not gonna tell you\nhow you need to structure yourselves.\n\n259\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.123\nNow, as we move through the other\nservice operation modules,\n\n260\n00:15:33.123 --> 00:15:37.794\nyou'll see that there are various ways\nto structure and if we're going to\n\n261\n00:15:37.794 --> 00:15:42.766\nserve a strategy in looks at the service\nstrategy life cycle, you'll see that\n\n262\n00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:47.813\nthere is an evolution for the structure\nin IT organization, and we certainly go\n\n263\n00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:52.751\ninto a lot more depth of structures in\nthe service strategy life cycle phase.\n\n264\n00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:57.072\nSo a function then is a group of\npeople and the tools that they use,\n\n265\n00:15:57.072 --> 00:15:58.891\nthe skills that they have.\n\n266\n00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:01.792\nI like to refer to them\nmore as functional areas.\n\n267\n00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:10.630\nBecause as I said we do not have\na prescriptive answer to your structure.\n\n268\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.810\nYour structure will be how you\nwant your structure to look.\n\n269\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.680\nSo, within every single process and\nI already mentioned, and\n\n270\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.250\nif I just I'm going to jump back now\nto this particular process model.\n\n271\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.860\nYou'll see that we have\nthat red box at the top and\n\n272\n00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.750\nthat red box is our process control,\nand so\n\n273\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:34.710\nwith every single process we have in\nthe top left corner a process owner.\n\n274\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.740\nNow, if we were to use\nsomething called a RACI matrix,\n\n275\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:45.210\nwhich we cover in great depth\nin service foundation itself.\n\n276\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.560\nWell, you'll see that we have\na role called Accountability, okay?\n\n277\n00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.750\nAnd accountability is where the buck\nstops, if we wanna use that saying, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:53.750 --> 00:17:01.630\nAccountable means somebody who takes\nownership 9f a particular process and\n\n279\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.600\nensures that it's performed according\nto not just the documented processes,\n\n280\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.870\nbut also any service level\ntargets that may exist.\n\n281\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:14.940\nSo when you see the word accountable,\nI want you to use the word ensured\n\n282\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.350\nas part of that sort of Relationships\nthat goes on in your mind, okay?\n\n283\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.140\nSo accountable means ensured.\n\n284\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.800\nSo, the process owner ensures that\nall of those bullet points happen.\n\n285\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.920\nHe takes accountability for ensuring\nthat all of those bullet points happen.\n\n286\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.780\nYou know what?\n\n287\n00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.620\nHe may delegate\nthe responsibility to do that\n\n288\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:42.860\nto the process manager, but the fact\nis that he insures that it happens,\n\n289\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.030\nhe doesn't necessarily\nhave to do it all himself.\n\n290\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:51.070\nNow, the process manager\nis accountable for,\n\n291\n00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.250\nmore basically, whatever the process\nowner tells him, but no,\n\n292\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.960\nthe process manager is accountable for\nthe day-to-day operations of the process.\n\n293\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.220\nSo, if you look at the bullet points here,\nhe's reviewing KPIs,\n\n294\n00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.690\nhe's making sure everybody's\ngot the right skills.\n\n295\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.440\nHe's going to monitor on performance,\n\n296\n00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.240\nhe's going to make sure we've got enough\npeople to be able to perform the process.\n\n297\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.430\nAnd he's also going to be providing\nfeedback to the Process Owner.\n\n298\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.820\nSo, the process owner is a figurehead but\nis also somebody who\n\n299\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.960\nensures that we've got the policies\nthat we've got the right documentation.\n\n300\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.790\nHe takes accountability for\npublishing the process etc.\n\n301\n00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.280\nAnd even improving it.\n\n302\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.070\nBut the process manager manages\nthe process on a day to day basis.\n\n303\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.610\nI want you to think about\nincident management again, and\n\n304\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.420\nI want you to think\nabout the service desk.\n\n305\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.430\nAnd what we may have,\nespecially in the service desk,\n\n306\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:51.720\nwhere we have multiple shifts, we will\nhave a service desk manager who sits\n\n307\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.190\nin an overall accountability for\nthe service desk.\n\n308\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.350\nWe would consider them to be the incident\nmanagement process all in all,\n\n309\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:05.080\ntakes ownership for the entire service\ntest for incident management period.\n\n310\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.130\nOkay.\n\n311\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.940\nAnd then, we got the process manager,\nso think of this as your chief leaders.\n\n312\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.420\nOkay, your team leaders.\n\n313\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.620\nThey are the people that\nmanage the services,\n\n314\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.630\ncan manage incident management\non that middle level.\n\n315\n00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.340\nOn a day to day basis on\na team by team basis.\n\n316\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.300\nAnd then, we have what we call\nthe process practitioners.\n\n317\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.840\nAnd for incidence management now\nwill be service analysts and\n\n318\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.670\nnow the people that carry out one or\n\n319\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.260\nmore of those process activities\nworking with other stakeholders.\n\n320\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.650\nStakeholders remember from a previous\nsession, is any interested party.\n\n321\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.050\nSo, a stakeholder can be a user,\na customer, it can be your colleague,\n\n322\n00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.700\nit can be somebody in a second level or\nthird level.\n\n323\n00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.780\nSporty somebody that you escalate to,\n\n324\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.400\none thing that a process\npractitioner has to do though,\n\n325\n00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.050\na process practitioner has to ensure the\nprocess documentation is kept up to date.\n\n326\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.800\nI have mentioned as we\nare moving to actual\n\n327\n00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:09.130\nprocesses within service operation, I have\nmentioned that in incident management,\n\n328\n00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.330\nall incidents have to be logged.\n\n329\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.110\nAnd you know what,\n\n330\n00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.590\nthat is the responsibility\nof the process practitioner.\n\n331\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.930\nTo ensure that all incidents are logged.\n\n332\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.150\nAnd that's not just for\nincident management by the way,\n\n333\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.110\nthat's for every single process to.\n\n334\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.270\nThere has to be relevant documentation\nto ensure that the process is happening.\n\n335\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.820\nOtherwise the process owner has\ngot absolutely nothing to go on.\n\n336\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.360\nAnd then, we're back to that,\nwell, because I think so\n\n337\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.600\nmetric when somebody says is the process\neffective or is it efficient.\n\n338\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.190\nAnd because I think so,\nit's just not good enough.\n\n339\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.880\nSo, let's move on from processes then and\nthen just to wrap this session up,\n\n340\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.640\nlet's take a look at\nthe services themselves, okay.\n\n341\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.980\nEvery single service must\nhave the service owner.\n\n342\n00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.720\nAnd that is a service owner within IT,\n\n343\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.740\nthere's an important\ndifferentiation there, okay?\n\n344\n00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:12.160\nThat service owner takes accountability\nfor the entire IT service.\n\n345\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.830\nAs we move through into service operation,\nand\n\n346\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:21.130\nas we've looked previously at\nthe life cycle phases within ITIL,\n\n347\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:26.220\nyou'll see that there were 20\nodd processes, well that's\n\n348\n00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.210\nservice owner does not take accountability\nfor all of those processes, okay?\n\n349\n00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.620\nAnd that service owner takes\naccountability of the service and\n\n350\n00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.220\nthat diagram in the bottom\nright hand corner there,\n\n351\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:42.420\nyou will see that each process\napplies to each service.\n\n352\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.200\nSo if we looked at process 1 and\nwe said that that was incident management,\n\n353\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.780\nwell incident management applies\nto every single service.\n\n354\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.710\nAnd problem management applies\nto every single service.\n\n355\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.980\nThen request fulfillment applies\nto every single service.\n\n356\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.800\nBut you will notice that each\nservice is separate, and\n\n357\n00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.160\nso each service or each silo lies it\nis there will have a service owner and\n\n358\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.230\nwe use that word accountable again and\nwe use the word ensure.\n\n359\n00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:14.390\nOkay, they ensure that value is delivered\n\n360\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:19.350\nto the organization, so\nthey'll liaise with the process owners but\n\n361\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.930\nthey liaise with business\nrelationship management.\n\n362\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.000\nThey will liaise with our organization.\n\n363\n00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.440\nAnd they will be present in\nour service review meetings,\n\n364\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.580\nwhich is where we review performance\nagainst those service level targets,\n\n365\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.370\nin service level management and\nwith our customer as well.\n\n366\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.170\nSo, I expect the service owner\nto be present with that.\n\n367\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.510\nUltimately the service owner takes\naccountability for a service.\n\n368\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.170\nSo, in this particular section here, then,\n\n369\n00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:53.490\nwell in the last two sections we've\ndone a very, very brief overview.\n\n370\n00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:59.199\nOf some of the fundamentals that we\nlearned within our IT foundation class.\n\n371\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.300\nNow, I do understand that\nthere is a lot to learn there,\n\n372\n00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.780\nso please feel free to browse\nfurther the IT foundation\n\n373\n00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:13.300\nmaterial that is available\nhere through ITPRO.TV.\n\n374\n00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.820\nBut, what I would ask you to do know\nis obviously to move in to your service\n\n375\n00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:23.610\noperation material and to take a look\nat our other service operation modules.\n\n376\n00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.550\nAlright, Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us out and reminding us of some of\n\n377\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.090\nthose foundational concepts that we may\nbe a little bit weak on, but now with\n\n378\n00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:37.440\nthis refresher, it means we're ready\nto head on to our ITIL intermedia show.\n\n379\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520\nWell, great place for us to sign off then.\n\n380\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.480\nFor IT pro TV, I'm your host Ronny Wong.\n\n381\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.680\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n382\n00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.382\n&gt;&gt; Stay turned now for\nyour ITIL intermedia introduction.\n\n383\n00:23:48.382 --> 00:23:54.442\n[MUSIC]\n\n384\n00:23:54.442 --> 00:23:57.451\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.303 --> 00:00:06.319\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.982\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:11.907\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:15.881\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:20.830\nYou're watching the ITIL Intermediate\nContinual Service Improvement show.\n\n8\n00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.710\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.720\nAnd today, we're gonna be jumping into,\nwell, some of the objectives and scope.\n\n10\n00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.999\nNow you've already watched\nthe introduction to, of course, the show.\n\n11\n00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.616\nAnd you've also, of course,\ngone through the course refresher or\n\n12\n00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:37.380\nthe foundations refresher, I should say.\n\n13\n00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.602\nAnd that means we are ready to jump\ninto continual service improvement.\n\n14\n00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:44.193\nAnd here to help us once\nagain is going to be,\n\n15\n00:00:44.193 --> 00:00:48.380\nwell, the ITIL wizard herself,\nMiss Jo Peacock.\n\n16\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.070\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n17\n00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.578\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for\nhaving me, Ronnie.\n\n18\n00:00:51.578 --> 00:00:53.870\nAt least I didn't get called\nDumbledore this time.\n\n19\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, not Dumbledore this time,\nbut it may happen again.\n\n20\n00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.808\n&gt;&gt; But Jo, as we begin,\nas we start taking a look at this idea\n\n21\n00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:05.479\nof continual service improvement,\nthis sounds almost intuitive.\n\n22\n00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.140\nLike it's something that we\nshould just be able to do.\n\n23\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.460\nBut I'm assuming since we're\nactually doing a whole show on it,\n\n24\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.710\nit's not as intuitive as\nI think it's gonna be.\n\n25\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.029\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is kind of intuitive.\n\n26\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.400\nBut it's one of those things that\nwe really don't invest the time and\n\n27\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.928\ninvest the effort and\ninvest the money into.\n\n28\n00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:30.687\nAnd so, whilst it is kind of intuitive,\nat the same time, it's so\n\n29\n00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:35.125\nobvious the organizations that undertake\ncontinual service improvement and\n\n30\n00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:39.495\nthe organizations that don't undertake\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n31\n00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:43.240\nSo, please, you were gonna say something?\n\n32\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.620\n&gt;&gt; No, I was just gonna say that actually\nmakes sense a lot of times, right?\n\n33\n00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.521\nThe very fact that organizations just\nthink that it's gonna happen naturally\n\n34\n00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.364\nthat they don't really plan for it.\n\n35\n00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:55.320\nThey don't expect anything\nlike that to end up happening.\n\n36\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.500\nAnd they just think it's going\nto somehow just, I guess,\n\n37\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.190\nexude from their particular processes\nthat they're already working.\n\n38\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.420\nSo without planning for\n\n39\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.820\nit, then if it doesn't happen,\nthey don't know where to go.\n\n40\n00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.427\nSo what I was gonna say is I believe\nthat that's why we're doing this show\n\n41\n00:02:09.427 --> 00:02:10.012\nthen, right?\n\n42\n00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:13.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as I said, you've already seen.\n\n43\n00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:17.953\nYou can see in the real world\norganizations that believe in CSI and\n\n44\n00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:21.052\nactually undertake CSI on a regular basis.\n\n45\n00:02:21.052 --> 00:02:24.349\nThat's why we call it continual and\nnot continuous.\n\n46\n00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.106\nAnd we looked at the difference between\ncontinual versus continuous when we\n\n47\n00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:31.420\nlooked at a recap of our foundation.\n\n48\n00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.152\nAnd those organizations that don't,\n\n49\n00:02:34.152 --> 00:02:38.920\nthe organizations that stay\nbehind the curve all the time.\n\n50\n00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.040\nIf you think about your\ncell phone provider.\n\n51\n00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.970\nYour cell phone provider,\n\n52\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.590\nfor the most part, will engage in\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n53\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.370\nWe see that because every year,\njust about now,\n\n54\n00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.680\nit feels like, every year,\nwe get a new model.\n\n55\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.570\nIt might be even more\nfrequently than that.\n\n56\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.110\nThat's continual service improvement.\n\n57\n00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.056\nThat it's continually seeking\nto align themselves with their\n\n58\n00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.848\ncustomers' requirement.\n\n59\n00:03:03.848 --> 00:03:05.751\nNow, sure, it's driven by market forces.\n\n60\n00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:10.180\nIt's driven by the fact that\ncompetitors will do something.\n\n61\n00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.820\nBut look at the organizations,\n\n62\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.010\nthe phone companies that don't engage\nin continual service improvement.\n\n63\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.445\nThe companies that have actually\nnot kept up with market forces.\n\n64\n00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:25.654\nAnd the companies that have relied\nsolely on one core product.\n\n65\n00:03:25.654 --> 00:03:31.090\nAnd you'll find that that core product\neventually, well, it becomes outdated.\n\n66\n00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.500\nIn the foundation recap,\nwe looked at the concept of value and\n\n67\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.710\nthe fact that value diminishes over time.\n\n68\n00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.010\nAnd it doesn't matter in\nwhat environment we're in.\n\n69\n00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.795\nWhether we're in IT, or if we're\ngoing grocery shopping, for instance,\n\n70\n00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:51.179\nyou get bored with the same thing over and\nover again.\n\n71\n00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:53.060\nAnd you want change.\n\n72\n00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.770\nAnd change is natural.\n\n73\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.325\nAnd value does diminish over time.\n\n74\n00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.237\nTen years ago now,\na very large company launched their first\n\n75\n00:04:02.237 --> 00:04:06.868\ntouchscreen telephone with\na graphical interface on it.\n\n76\n00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:11.302\nAnd it was the best thing in the world and\neverybody wanted one.\n\n77\n00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:15.663\nNow I remember, or if you remember\nwhen we talked in foundation recap,\n\n78\n00:04:15.663 --> 00:04:18.590\nwe looked at the concept of a service.\n\n79\n00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.340\nAnd a service is a means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating outcomes.\n\n80\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.600\nSo the outcome that we facilitate with\na cell phone is the ability to make a call\n\n81\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.700\nand receive a call, and\nsend a text and receive a text.\n\n82\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.800\nSo that phone ten years\nago met those needs.\n\n83\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.240\nYeah, it facilitated that outcome.\n\n84\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.104\nBut if I were to give you that\nexact cell phone right now,\n\n85\n00:04:43.104 --> 00:04:45.087\nhow would you feel about it?\n\n86\n00:04:45.087 --> 00:04:47.880\n&gt;&gt; I would probably feel\nit's fairly antiquated.\n\n87\n00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.000\nThat it does make a phone call, but\nit's not what I would expect from a phone.\n\n88\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, so values diminished over time.\n\n89\n00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.770\nAnd yet,\nthat outcome is still facilitated.\n\n90\n00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.250\nIt's still doing exactly\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n91\n00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.610\nIt's still making and\nreceiving phone calls.\n\n92\n00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.690\nAnd it still has the same functionality\nthat it did ten years ago.\n\n93\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.609\nBut you don't perceive the same\namount of value in it.\n\n94\n00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:15.924\nAnd so a company that doesn't engage in\ncontinual service improvement will end up\n\n95\n00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:17.810\nwith that cell phone for ten years.\n\n96\n00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.400\nAnd will end up losing customers.\n\n97\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.643\nAnd will end up losing profit and\n\n98\n00:05:22.643 --> 00:05:28.473\nlosing revenue because of the fact that\nthey don't recognize that value changes.\n\n99\n00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:32.365\nAnd so the purpose of\ncontinual service improvement,\n\n100\n00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:37.537\nas we see actually in this slide here\nthat's coming up on the screen now.\n\n101\n00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:41.001\nIn the bottom blue box there,\nthe purpose of CSI is\n\n102\n00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:45.622\nto align services with changing\nbusiness needs by identifying and\n\n103\n00:05:45.622 --> 00:05:51.170\nimplementing improvements to services\nthat support the business processes.\n\n104\n00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.080\nSo we talk about cell phones and\nwe talk about facilitating that outcome\n\n105\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.830\nof the ability just to make and\nreceive a phone call.\n\n106\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.127\nWell, consider that to be a business need,\nif you will, for a moment.\n\n107\n00:06:04.127 --> 00:06:06.950\nYou're a customer, it's your need.\n\n108\n00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.840\nThose business needs change.\n\n109\n00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.490\nYour needs change.\n\n110\n00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.762\nAnd no longer do you just wanna be\nable to make and receive a phone call.\n\n111\n00:06:15.762 --> 00:06:18.240\nNow, you wanna be able to send and\nreceive emails.\n\n112\n00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.370\nYou want to be able to send and\nreceive texts.\n\n113\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.280\nYou probably wanna do video calling.\n\n114\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.970\nBecause, let's face it,\nwe all do nowadays.\n\n115\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.220\nYou probably wanna be able to play games,\ndon't you?\n\n116\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n117\n00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\nthose things were not possible.\n\n118\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.506\nWell, okay, there were some\ngames around ten years ago, but\n\n119\n00:06:36.506 --> 00:06:38.179\nthey were very simplistic.\n\n120\n00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:40.916\nAnd now we've got things\nlike augmented reality.\n\n121\n00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:45.765\nAnd we have all sorts of\npossibilities with our phone handsets\n\n122\n00:06:45.765 --> 00:06:48.850\nnow that we didn't have ten years ago.\n\n123\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.440\nAnd that's because we're continually\naligning ourselves to the needs of\n\n124\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.464\nthe customers.\n\n125\n00:06:55.464 --> 00:06:58.429\nAnd a company that is very good at CSI,\n\n126\n00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:04.005\nthat is very proactive at CSI is\nthe organization that's profitable.\n\n127\n00:07:04.005 --> 00:07:06.263\nBecause they're understanding\ntheir customers.\n\n128\n00:07:06.263 --> 00:07:08.545\nThey're understanding their business.\n\n129\n00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:12.815\nAnd they don't have to wait for\nthe business to come to them and\n\n130\n00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:14.495\nask them for something.\n\n131\n00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:18.085\nImagine, if you had to go to\nyour cell phone provider and\n\n132\n00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:21.775\ntell your cell phone provider, actually,\nin the next version of the phone,\n\n133\n00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.825\nI'd like to see this and this and this.\n\n134\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.800\nI don't know about you, but\nI don't have the time for that.\n\n135\n00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n136\n00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.145\n&gt;&gt; As far as I'm concerned,\n\n137\n00:07:30.145 --> 00:07:33.462\nI'm gonna wait until something\nthat catches my eye comes out.\n\n138\n00:07:33.462 --> 00:07:36.400\nAnd then I'm gonna say,\nhey, I really want that.\n\n139\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.580\nAnd quite often, I don't really perceive\na need until I've seen it advertised.\n\n140\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.940\nAnd then, all of a sudden, I need it.\n\n141\n00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.487\nAnd I had that with a bit\nof wearable technology\n\n142\n00:07:47.487 --> 00:07:49.849\nthat I didn't really have a need for this.\n\n143\n00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:52.294\nAnd then, all of a sudden,\nI saw it advertised.\n\n144\n00:07:52.294 --> 00:07:54.602\nAnd, wow, did I have a need for that.\n\n145\n00:07:54.602 --> 00:07:59.573\nThere was suddenly a hole in my life that\nI couldn't fill without that piece of\n\n146\n00:07:59.573 --> 00:08:00.498\ntechnology.\n\n147\n00:08:00.498 --> 00:08:01.557\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n148\n00:08:01.557 --> 00:08:03.347\nAnd so that's what CSI is about.\n\n149\n00:08:03.347 --> 00:08:06.213\nAnd so as you can imagine CSI works very,\n\n150\n00:08:06.213 --> 00:08:11.189\nvery closely with business relationship\nmanagement to make sure that\n\n151\n00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:16.350\nwe're recommending ideas for\nour services to our organization.\n\n152\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.080\nBut CSI also works very,\n\n153\n00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.060\nvery closely with all of the other\nprocesses and all of our services\n\n154\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.850\nto make sure that those processes stay\naligned with the needs of the business.\n\n155\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.090\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo now, I was just thinking,\n\n156\n00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.910\nand correct me if I'm wrong\nbecause I may be wrong on this.\n\n157\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.930\nIt sounds like that CSI does have a direct\n\n158\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.920\nbearing at least on\nthat diminishing value.\n\n159\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.800\nThat if we can continue to\noffer service improvement,\n\n160\n00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.980\nthen either the value\nis less diminished or\n\n161\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.090\nwe change the value somehow to make our\nbusiness better or more profitable.\n\n162\n00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.310\nDoes that seem like what\nthe service can do for us or\n\n163\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.840\nwhat continual service improvement does?\n\n164\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, well we do have to,\nyou mentioned more profitable.\n\n165\n00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.090\nWe do have to take into consideration\nthe strategy of the organization, and\n\n166\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.000\nsometimes it's not always about profit.\n\n167\n00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.610\nIf we're talking about government\nagencies, for instance,\n\n168\n00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.460\nthen that's definitely not about profit.\n\n169\n00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n170\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.790\n&gt;&gt; However,\n\n171\n00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:15.590\nwe do have to make sure that we're aligned\nto the business which is why we say that.\n\n172\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.250\nAnd it's not just about\nthe services either,\n\n173\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.190\nso let's think about the fact that,\nincident management for instance.\n\n174\n00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.470\nCan you imagine if you\ncalled up a help line now,\n\n175\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.370\na service desk of any type,\nand you called them.\n\n176\n00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.440\nAnd they said hang on a moment,\nI just need to write all of this down, and\n\n177\n00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.580\nthey wrote down all of your\ndetails on a piece of paper.\n\n178\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.890\nHow confident would you feel in the level\nof service you were going to get\n\n179\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.870\nfrom them?\n\n180\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.950\n&gt;&gt; If they had to take all the time to\ndo that, I don't know if I'd feel very\n\n181\n00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.200\nconfident at all, if they couldn't\nactually know what was going on.\n\n182\n00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.860\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthen they don't take all of your details,\n\n183\n00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.300\ncuz they want to log it and track it.\n\n184\n00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.090\nThey take all of your details\ncuz it's on a piece of paper.\n\n185\n00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.310\nAnd then at that point in time,\n\n186\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.470\nyou're wondering well what's going\nto happen when I put the phone down?\n\n187\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.220\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; How do I know this is going to be\n\n188\n00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.560\nfollowed through?\n\n189\n00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.960\nAnd that's because quite\nsimply we expect that now.\n\n190\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.610\nWe're customers,\nwe expect that particular level.\n\n191\n00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:18.100\nSo we expect those processes to be,\nor to utilize IT tools.\n\n192\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.700\nWe don't expect anyone in IT to\nbe using pieces of paper now.\n\n193\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.510\nAnd in fact,\n\n194\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.630\nit's actually worked to the point\nwhere when we go into an organization.\n\n195\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.780\nAnd no matter what that organization\nis if we go into a bank or\n\n196\n00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.640\nif we go into just say a local store,\na local shop for instance.\n\n197\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.100\nIf somebody says to you,\nI'm sorry you can't pay by card,\n\n198\n00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.469\nyou can only pay by cash.\n\n199\n00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.990\nYou're very wary of that\nparticular service,\n\n200\n00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:51.039\nat that point in time because\nthere's no technology.\n\n201\n00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:53.500\nAnd you feel that there's no privacy and\n\n202\n00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:59.560\nalso there's something there that\nyou are wary about as a customer.\n\n203\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.030\nWe expect technology, and so\n\n204\n00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:06.360\nbecause we expect technology,\nwe know the technology's going to change.\n\n205\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.830\nAnd we expect the organization\nto change over time.\n\n206\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.710\nNow, I mentioned strategy.\n\n207\n00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.120\nAnd even an organization that,\nwhen we look at it's service strategy, and\n\n208\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.430\nwhen we look at the foundation recap.\n\n209\n00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.690\nWe talked about the three different\nhigh level types of strategy.\n\n210\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.430\nOrganizations that want to run the\nbusiness, just maintain the status quo.\n\n211\n00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.360\nOrganizations that want to grow\nthe business and get bigger.\n\n212\n00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.820\nAnd organizations that want\nto transform the business and\n\n213\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.150\ndo something completely different.\n\n214\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:43.680\nWell even an organization that just wants\nto run the business, still has to change.\n\n215\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.840\nWindows 95 is not gonna be supported\nforever, you've still got to change, and\n\n216\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.860\nwe expect that.\n\n217\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.710\nAnd even in an organization\nthat is not looking to grow,\n\n218\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.760\nlike a government department or\nour military for instance.\n\n219\n00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.500\nWe still need change,\nwe still expect them to be up-to-date.\n\n220\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.400\nSo continual service improvement is key.\n\n221\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.580\nAnd if we go back to that screen where we\nlooked at the objectives there you'll see\n\n222\n00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.950\nthat we want to improve every\nsingle lifecycle stage.\n\n223\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.040\nThat include service strategy and all\nof the process within service strategy.\n\n224\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.400\nSo it's design and\nall the processes within design.\n\n225\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.110\nAnd then transition and\nall of the processes within transition.\n\n226\n00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:31.460\nAnd service operation and all of\nthe processes within service operation.\n\n227\n00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.310\nAnd do you know what?\n\n228\n00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:38.600\nWe even improve CSI, because CSI methods\nand techniques can always be improved.\n\n229\n00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.310\nSo we even want to improve CSI.\n\n230\n00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.770\nSo if we take a look at\nthat second bullet point,\n\n231\n00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.250\nwhat we view in the service\nlevel achievements.\n\n232\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.740\nWe call them our SLAM chart,\nour Service Level Agreement Metrics.\n\n233\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.950\nWhere on a regular basis we'll monitor\nperformance against the targets that\n\n234\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.670\nwere set way back in service design for\nany service.\n\n235\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.520\nNow, on a regular basis, and\n\n236\n00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.610\nwe'll say it shouldn't be any\ngreater than every three months.\n\n237\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.710\nYou should have a service\nreview with your customer.\n\n238\n00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.750\nSo service level management,\nbusiness relationship management, and\n\n239\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.310\nthe customer need to be involved.\n\n240\n00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.770\nAnd we look at performance\nagainst those targets.\n\n241\n00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.180\nAnd the output from that service review\nmeeting is what we call a service\n\n242\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.440\nimprovement plan.\n\n243\n00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.550\nAnd, guess what?\n\n244\n00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:34.670\nIt's an improvement plan, so\nguess who has an involvement in it?\n\n245\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:39.510\nCSI, I like to think of CSI as\nbeing really, really sneaky.\n\n246\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:44.140\nAnd CSI is, I wouldn't say convert\ncuz it should be visible, but\n\n247\n00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.070\nCSI should have its little tendrils\ninto absolutely everything.\n\n248\n00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.050\nAnd CSI should be that little\nvoice on your shoulder that says,\n\n249\n00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.810\ndo you think we could do this better?\n\n250\n00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:00.110\nThat's what CSI is, looking for\nways to do everything better.\n\n251\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:04.600\nSo we talk about identifying\nspecific activities\n\n252\n00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.160\nto improve quality,\nimproving cost effectiveness.\n\n253\n00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:15.090\nSo improving our efficiencies, but\nnot at the risk of user satisfaction.\n\n254\n00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.200\nWe've got to keep our users happy,\nwe have to.\n\n255\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.580\nWe're about delivering value, and\n\n256\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.140\nwe've already explored the fact\nthat value is perceived.\n\n257\n00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.620\nSo we've got to make sure that whatever\nmethods and whatever techniques and\n\n258\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:32.260\nwhatever processes we use deliver\nthat value and we're able to improve.\n\n259\n00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.310\nSo all of our processes\nhave to have objectives.\n\n260\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.740\nWe have to measure whether\nthey're working or not, and\n\n261\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.560\nit's exactly the same with our services.\n\n262\n00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.290\nNow the last bullet point there\nreally talks about the fact, and\n\n263\n00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.610\nI know that I've mentioned this\nin previous ITIL classes as well.\n\n264\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.530\nBut it talks about knowledge management,\n\n265\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.445\nknowledge management exists\nwithin service transition.\n\n266\n00:14:55.445 --> 00:15:00.050\nA knowledge management is that\nunderstanding that every single\n\n267\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:05.020\nreport that we produce and every single\npiece of information that we have.\n\n268\n00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.780\nWe should be able to analyze and\n\n269\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:12.150\ngive us knowledge, and from there\nwe can make an informed decision.\n\n270\n00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:17.300\nIf you can't make a decision from\na metric, then why are you measuring it?\n\n271\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.190\nAnd that's what that last\nbullet point is saying.\n\n272\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.930\nDo you know why you're\ntaking all of your metrics?\n\n273\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:30.890\nI know that I mentioned during a service\noperation class, that if you go out and\n\n274\n00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:38.127\nyou buy a tool based purely on the fact\nthat it will deliver your 500 reports.\n\n275\n00:15:38.127 --> 00:15:42.810\nI will guarantee that 499 of those reports\nwill not actually meet your needs,\n\n276\n00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.740\nbut it just sounds good, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.375\nAnd so we'll tell you that any report,\nabsolutely any report\n\n278\n00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:55.114\nthat you want to take from any tool\nhas got to be valuable to you.\n\n279\n00:15:55.114 --> 00:15:58.592\nAnd that comes back to that understand\nwhy you're measuring something.\n\n280\n00:15:58.592 --> 00:16:03.242\nAnd if you can't make a decision from it,\nthey why are you measuring it?\n\n281\n00:16:03.242 --> 00:16:06.081\nSo the scope here is\nabsolutely everything.\n\n282\n00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:10.050\nIt's all of our service management health.\n\n283\n00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.320\nIt's about making sure that\nall of our processes and\n\n284\n00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.980\nall of our services are aligned\nto the needs of the business.\n\n285\n00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.590\nNow it mentions there in that second\nbullet point the continual alignment of\n\n286\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.300\nthe service portfolio with current and\nfuture needs.\n\n287\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.050\nThat's exactly what we were just\ntalking about earlier, Ronnie,\n\n288\n00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.040\nwhen we were talking\nabout our cell phones.\n\n289\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.008\nWe talk about current needs and\nfuture needs.\n\n290\n00:16:32.008 --> 00:16:36.900\nService portfolio management\nas a process works with\n\n291\n00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.900\nbusiness relationship management to\ncome up with ideas for new services.\n\n292\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:47.120\nTo document those ideas within\na portfolio, and then to make decisions\n\n293\n00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.090\nalong with financial management on whether\nthese services are a good idea for\n\n294\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.970\nthe organization or not.\n\n295\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:58.120\nAnd whether they fit in with\nthe organization's strategy.\n\n296\n00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:04.550\nAnd also whether they fit in with\nour IT organization's strategy.\n\n297\n00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.992\nI mentioned in one session that\nwe covered that I'd worked within\n\n298\n00:17:08.992 --> 00:17:12.071\nan organization to achieve ISO 20000.\n\n299\n00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:16.767\nAnd one of the things that they wanted to\ndo prior to achieving ISO 20000 was to\n\n300\n00:17:16.767 --> 00:17:19.880\nupgrade or change,\nwhichever way you look at it.\n\n301\n00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.950\nTheir entire infrastructure from a Windows\nbased infrastructure to an Apple\n\n302\n00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.640\ninfrastructure.\n\n303\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.500\nWhich is what they wanted, and\nit worked absolutely great for them.\n\n304\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.550\nBut obviously that was a period of great\nchange, and so when you think about\n\n305\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.450\nservice portfolio management and\nthe question that I asked was, make sure,\n\n306\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:43.020\nare you making sure that it's aligned\nto your IT organization's needs?\n\n307\n00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.300\nWell, clearly the IT organization?\n\n308\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.910\nWell, they had a stable output.\n\n309\n00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.140\nSo the stable Windows environment.\n\n310\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:58.900\nWell, think about that fact that we want\nto maintain our stability of our services,\n\n311\n00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.900\nbut we still want to respond to\nthe changing needs of the business.\n\n312\n00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.710\nAnd so of course IT if we're\nlooking at that balance,\n\n313\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.570\nwe're looking at stability and\neverything's going great with Windows.\n\n314\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.574\nAnd even when there aren't errors,\nwe know about Windows and\n\n315\n00:18:12.574 --> 00:18:17.460\nwe're comfortable with Windows and we're\nable to handle anything that goes wrong.\n\n316\n00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.050\nWhereas, Apple is\na completely unknown entity.\n\n317\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.500\nSo, we want to respond to your needs, and\n\n318\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.560\nwe want to be able to implement this,\nbut we don't have the skills,\n\n319\n00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.180\nand we don't have the experience, and\nit's a completely unknown entity.\n\n320\n00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:37.060\nWell, CSI comes along and\nsays, well, you know what?\n\n321\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.730\nThis is what the business needs.\n\n322\n00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.270\nSo, what we have to do is work towards\n\n323\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.920\nensuring that we're reliant\nwith the business needs.\n\n324\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.390\nAnd if that means we have to go and\nget addition training,\n\n325\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.200\nif that means that we need\nto expand our repertoire and\n\n326\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.530\nwe need to bring in additional\nstaff with those skills.\n\n327\n00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.270\nThen you know what?\nThat's what we are going to have to do.\n\n328\n00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.750\nAnd sure it's going to be a change.\n\n329\n00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:05.230\nSure it's going to be an upheaval\nwhen we first undertake this.\n\n330\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.230\nBut nevertheless,\n\n331\n00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.180\nit's aligning ourselves with the business,\nso that's what we need to do.\n\n332\n00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.940\nAnd we need to ensure that we're\nadaptable because we do have to respond\n\n333\n00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.960\nto changing business needs.\n\n334\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.840\nBut we need to do it while\nmaintaining that stability.\n\n335\n00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:24.370\nSo it can't be at a cost of the current\ninfrastructure because we have to\n\n336\n00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.910\ntransition from one to the other.\n\n337\n00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.050\nSo this is where CSI will help us.\n\n338\n00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.000\nCSI also looks at maturity.\n\n339\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.765\nAnd I love that word maturity,\ncuz it doesn't mean old.\n\n340\n00:19:36.765 --> 00:19:40.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not like a fine wine or\n\n341\n00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.880\na good cheese.\n\n342\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.400\nIt actually means that we\nare well developed and\n\n343\n00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.680\nwell aligned to the needs\nof the organization.\n\n344\n00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.840\nThat's what we mean by maturity\nis how developed we are,\n\n345\n00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.100\nhow well developed we are.\n\n346\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:01.100\nAnd so we're looking at the maturity and\nthe capabilities, of what we do,\n\n347\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.020\nour intangible assets,\nof our IT organization.\n\n348\n00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.420\nAnd that includes our management,\nit includes our processes,\n\n349\n00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:13.260\nit includes our people,\nit includes the way that we are organized.\n\n350\n00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.150\nIt includes our hierarchy,\nit includes the way that we interact and\n\n351\n00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.240\nthe way that we collaborate\nwith each other.\n\n352\n00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.355\nBecause, you see, we can be well developed\nbut we can be well developed to silos.\n\n353\n00:20:24.355 --> 00:20:28.113\nAnd that doesn't create good\nefficiency which obviously\n\n354\n00:20:28.113 --> 00:20:32.261\nthe two tenets of ITIL are about\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n\n355\n00:20:32.261 --> 00:20:36.504\nAnd if we are working in silos then\nwe are not particularly efficient\n\n356\n00:20:36.504 --> 00:20:39.938\nbecause there is a lot\nduplication of effort going on.\n\n357\n00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:44.109\nSo we want ensure that we have\ncontinual that's iterative,\n\n358\n00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:48.690\nrepeatable improvement for\nall of our processes and our people and\n\n359\n00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.690\ntheir skills and\nthe way that we are organized, etc.\n\n360\n00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.550\nBut also we want to have CSI for\nall of our services too and\n\n361\n00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.220\nall of the components that\nsupport all of our services.\n\n362\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.460\nSo what we want to do is ensure that\nwe define what we want to measure and\n\n363\n00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.820\nthen we measure it.\n\n364\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.772\nAnd then we control what's happening,\nand then we manage, and we improve.\n\n365\n00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.140\nIf you see that bottom slide, or\nthe bottom part of that slide,\n\n366\n00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:23.360\nyou'll see that what we're focusing\non here is value to the business, and\n\n367\n00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.880\nI've already mentioned this.\n\n368\n00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.710\nIt's value to our customers,\nwhether our internal customers or\n\n369\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:28.820\nour external customers.\n\n370\n00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:34.120\nThe first word in that first bullet\npoint on that slide there talks about\n\n371\n00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.400\ngradual and continual improvement.\n\n372\n00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.730\nWe like to use words like iterative,\nthat means repeatable.\n\n373\n00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.320\nIncremental, building\none on top of the other.\n\n374\n00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:52.850\nBut we also like to use words like\nsmall iterative improvements, visible.\n\n375\n00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:00.160\nSmall improvements in other words\nwe do something, we improve.\n\n376\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.380\nWe make a small improvement.\n\n377\n00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.840\nAnd then we do something else.\n\n378\n00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.230\nAnd we make a small improvement.\n\n379\n00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.470\nAnd then we do something else.\n\n380\n00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.600\nAnd we make a small improvement.\n\n381\n00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:13.485\nVisible improvements that are small\nare easier to adopt into the environment.\n\n382\n00:22:13.485 --> 00:22:18.685\nA large change,\na large improvement not necessarily so\n\n383\n00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:21.485\neasy to adopt into the live environment.\n\n384\n00:22:21.485 --> 00:22:25.055\nNow sometimes you can't help but do that.\n\n385\n00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:27.072\nBut think about our deployment techniques.\n\n386\n00:22:27.072 --> 00:22:31.422\nAnd when we deploy in service transition,\nwe deploy quite often\n\n387\n00:22:31.422 --> 00:22:36.976\nin a phased manner unless we absolutely\nhave to deploy in a big bang fashion.\n\n388\n00:22:36.976 --> 00:22:41.576\nAnd that's what we're doing with CSI\nis continual improvement its gradual,\n\n389\n00:22:41.576 --> 00:22:44.186\nits small, visible improvement.\n\n390\n00:22:44.186 --> 00:22:47.036\nWe like to keep a simple approach and\n\n391\n00:22:47.036 --> 00:22:51.980\nin the ITIL practitioner guidance\nwhich we will have online for you.\n\n392\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.438\nWe outline the fact that\nin our CSI principles,\n\n393\n00:22:56.438 --> 00:23:02.630\nwe want small visible improvements,\nnot big improvements all the time.\n\n394\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.410\nBecause quite often, [LAUGH] unless we\nget the organizational change management\n\n395\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:13.990\naspect of it right, then that can,\nwell it can add to chaos, put it that way.\n\n396\n00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.460\nSo our services are aligned\nto our business needs and\n\n397\n00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.760\nthere's a gradual reduction\nin cost to deliver services.\n\n398\n00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.240\nThat's because we're\ngetting more efficient.\n\n399\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.140\nIt's not because we've\nhad our budgets cut.\n\n400\n00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.900\nIt's because we're getting\nmore efficient and\n\n401\n00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.700\nnot just because somebody said you know\nwhat you're getting a few million dollars\n\n402\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.910\nless this year than you had last year.\n\n403\n00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.030\nSo what we want to do is\nidentify improvements across\n\n404\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.110\nall of our life cycle phases.\n\n405\n00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.240\nBut it's not just about\nidentifying improvements,\n\n406\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.500\nits about implementing them too.\n\n407\n00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.850\nBecause you know we can have a really\ngreat list of ideas in our CSI register\n\n408\n00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.390\nbut unless we implement them then,\n\n409\n00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.390\nobviously, we're not going to be\nable to deliver that improvement.\n\n410\n00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:01.296\nSo for this session,\nwhat I'd like you to do is just to\n\n411\n00:24:01.296 --> 00:24:06.541\nrecap over the concept and\nthe objectives of CSI itself.\n\n412\n00:24:06.541 --> 00:24:09.703\nAnd then in our next session,\nwe're just gonna touch very,\n\n413\n00:24:09.703 --> 00:24:12.927\nvery lightly on our CSI approach,\nwhich is something that you\n\n414\n00:24:12.927 --> 00:24:17.035\ntouched on in your foundation material\nwhen you did your foundation class.\n\n415\n00:24:17.035 --> 00:24:20.815\nWe're gonna look at that just from a very\nhigh level right now before we get into\n\n416\n00:24:20.815 --> 00:24:23.105\ntoo much detail in further sessions.\n\n417\n00:24:23.105 --> 00:24:26.685\nSo in our next session,\nwe'll be looking at that, CSI approach.\n\n418\n00:24:26.685 --> 00:24:31.910\nBut for now please go away and\nreview, spend about 30 minutes or\n\n419\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.310\nso just reviewing the concept and\nthe objectives of CSI.\n\n420\n00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.380\nAnd our forum is always available for\nus, should you have any questions.\n\n421\n00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.560\nThen please come back to us and\nwe'll be happy to answer them for you.\n\n422\n00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Jo for helping us as\nwe get started into the CSI process here.\n\n423\n00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.270\nIt is very important that we understand\nthat what we've talked about here of\n\n424\n00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.640\ncourse are taking a look at the objectives\nas well as the scope of CSI, and\n\n425\n00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.400\neven those business values.\n\n426\n00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.280\nUnderstanding the whole goal behind of\ncourse CSI is that continual improvement.\n\n427\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.460\nAnd Jo emphasized the ideas here of small,\ngradual but\n\n428\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.340\nalways continual types of improvements\nthat we'd like to actually make with CSI.\n\n429\n00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.970\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n430\n00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.200\nSigning off for\nITProTV I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n431\n00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

00:00:11.343\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:14.520\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.860\nYou're watching the ITIL Intermediate\nContinual Service Improvement show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.890\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\nwe are continuing with a part two here\n\n7\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.300\non the scope and\nthe objective, right, for CSI.\n\n8\n00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.500\nAnd here to help us out and\nto help fulfill this particular area\n\n9\n00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.690\nis gonna be our sage and master ITIL\nspecialist for us here is Ms. Jo P Cotton.\n\n10\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.990\nJo, welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.280\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Ronnie, you're\ngonna run out of names for me very soon.\n\n12\n00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.640\n&gt;&gt; It can happen, but\n\n13\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.928\nthe great thing is I have a whole\nthesaurus that I can pull from.\n\n14\n00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:51.376\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, last time we took a look just\n\n15\n00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:54.704\nreally at the beginning of\nthe introduction of these scopes and\n\n16\n00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:56.150\nthese objectives.\n\n17\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.670\nWhere are we going to\npick up from right now?\n\n18\n00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're going to carry\non with where we left off in\n\n19\n00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.520\npart one where we took\na look at the objectives.\n\n20\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.565\nWe took a look at the scope and as I\nmentioned in part one, we're now gonna\n\n21\n00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:14.964\nstart off by just looking very quickly,\nvery high level at the CSI approach.\n\n22\n00:01:14.964 --> 00:01:18.744\nAnd then we're going to look at\nthe other life cycle processes and\n\n23\n00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:23.930\nthe life cycles themselves and how CSI\nfits into each of those life cycle phases.\n\n24\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.340\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good Jo,\nlet's go ahead and get started then.\n\n25\n00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well let's take a look at this\nfirst slide then that we have in this set.\n\n26\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.050\nAnd you can see that we\nhave here the CSI approach.\n\n27\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.560\nAnd the CSI approach Is a very,\nvery, very high level, but\n\n28\n00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.550\niterative, repeatable method of\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n29\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.450\nNow, I know that we've mentioned in\nprevious classes, and certainly in our\n\n30\n00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.820\nfoundation recap, the difference\nbetween continuous and continual.\n\n31\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.900\nContinual, being an iterative,\nrepeatable process,\n\n32\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.010\nwhereas continuous means ongoing,\nnever stopping.\n\n33\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.460\nAnd so the reason that we have\ncontinual service improvement or CSI,\n\n34\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.250\nand so to be fair, in future classes,\nwe're just gonna refer to this as CSI.\n\n35\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.660\nAnd that's what IteITIL does,\nwe just refer refer to it as CSI.\n\n36\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.729\nAnd the reason that we have continual\nservice improvement, is because with\n\n37\n00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:28.220\nevery single improvement, we can\ncheck that we've made an improvement.\n\n38\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.030\nAnd that's key to being able to\ndeliver value to the organization\n\n39\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.250\nis actually having that\nvisibility of that value.\n\n40\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.470\nSo let's take a look then very,\nvery briefly at this high level approach.\n\n41\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.190\nEvery single improvement initiative\nhas to be done in a continual way.\n\n42\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.400\nIt has to be done in an iterative way and\n\n43\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.700\nwe start off right to the very top\nwith understanding the vision for\n\n44\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.810\nthe organization and understanding\nthe vision for the IT organization.\n\n45\n00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.820\nAnd those two visions should be aligned,\nafter all that's the purpose of ITIL.\n\n46\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.110\nSo the vision of the organization.\n\n47\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.700\nLet's say for instance,\nI want to go over there.\n\n48\n00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.910\nThat's where I want to go so\nI'm heading in that direction.\n\n49\n00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.344\nThat's as much as I need to\nknow in terms of vision is that\n\n50\n00:03:16.344 --> 00:03:21.328\nI'm heading in that direction over there\nand I should know where my endpoint is.\n\n51\n00:03:21.328 --> 00:03:25.620\nThen I look at where I am right now,\nand I'm here.\n\n52\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.500\nHere I am.\n\n53\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.430\nYeah I'm stood right here.\n\n54\n00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.340\nSo let's think about where I want to be.\n\n55\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.360\nNow this is the point in time where\nwe will tell you that you planned for\n\n56\n00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.720\nyour short term visible\nimprovements in detail.\n\n57\n00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.810\nYour long term goal, you don't\nplan in detail, because your long\n\n58\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.750\nterm goal is going to be dependent\non your short term improvement.\n\n59\n00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.190\nAnd with each iterative improvement,\n\n60\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.540\nthat next improvement is going\nto be dependent on the first.\n\n61\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.290\nSo let's say that I was walking.\n\n62\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.570\nAnd if I look at where I want to be,\nI'll say well, I want to be over there.\n\n63\n00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.504\nSo I'm going to head in this direction.\n\n64\n00:04:09.504 --> 00:04:13.652\nAnd I'll incorporate the how do I\nget there, I'm going to walk, well,\n\n65\n00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:15.830\nokay, I'm gonna take my first step.\n\n66\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.360\nAnd that first step i'm going to plan in\ndetail under that where do I want to be.\n\n67\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.190\nBut I'm not gonna plan the following steps\nin any great detail because that first\n\n68\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.340\nstep might be different\nto what I expected.\n\n69\n00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.020\nSo this is my first step.\n\n70\n00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.880\nHow do I get there?\n\n71\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.970\nI'm gonna take a step.\n\n72\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.970\nAnd then I'm going to say okay\nwell did I get there yes or no?\n\n73\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.730\nWell I'm going to look at where I am\nnow and I'm going to say yes I did.\n\n74\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.690\nOkay so what's next.\n\n75\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.290\nWell what's next is I take my next step.\n\n76\n00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.350\nBut of course you see in order\nto take my next step I have\n\n77\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.070\nto look at where I am right now.\n\n78\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.050\nWell the reason why we don't plan our next\nsteps in any great detail until we've made\n\n79\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.910\nthat first step is very, very simple.\n\n80\n00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.480\nIs that we didn't know just how\nlong that first step would take.\n\n81\n00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.690\nSo we plan for\nour short term goals in great detail.\n\n82\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.480\nBut our long term vision\nwe plan in high level.\n\n83\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.400\nSo where do I wanna be?\n\n84\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.140\nI want to be here so\nI'm gonna take that step.\n\n85\n00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.790\nAnd I'm gonna say, didn't I get there.\n\n86\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.820\nOkay so what's next?\n\n87\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.430\nHow do I keep the momentum going,\nwhat's next?\n\n88\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.140\nWell, the first thing that I'm\ngonna do is check my vision.\n\n89\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.730\nBecause, you see,\nI might have changed direction.\n\n90\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.390\nAnd where I thought that, yeah,\n\n91\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.940\nI was heading in that direction\nnow the organization's changed.\n\n92\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.110\nAnd now we're headed in that direction.\n\n93\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.710\nSo immediately I'm gonna have to change.\n\n94\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.720\nAnd that's okay.\n\n95\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.730\nBecause as long as I know where I am,\nI can make that change.\n\n96\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.330\nSo our next slide just simply\ngoes over that CSI approach, and\n\n97\n00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.930\njust looks at, you know,\n\n98\n00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.740\nour alignment to our vision, that's where\nI want to be, then, where am I right now?\n\n99\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.406\nWell, exactly where do I want to be,\nthese are my details targets.\n\n100\n00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:06.412\nHow do I get there?\n\n101\n00:06:06.412 --> 00:06:07.980\nThat's my plan.\n\n102\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.580\nAnd then once I've made that improvement,\nonce I've taken that step,\n\n103\n00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.400\nthen well did I achieve\nwhat I wanted to achieve?\n\n104\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.530\nDid I get there, then I take my\nmeasurement from here to here.\n\n105\n00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.270\nAnd I said okay, that's great.\n\n106\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.710\nNow I embed that change.\n\n107\n00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.080\nI recognize that this is now my new\nbaseline and I embed that change.\n\n108\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.098\nAnd then I move on, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:29.098 --> 00:06:33.580\nAnd that's my next improvement and\nagain I check my vision.\n\n110\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.840\nI realign my vision to make sure\nI'm headed in the right direction.\n\n111\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.810\nSo let's look at those\nsteps in greater detail,\n\n112\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.640\nstarting off with our baseline, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.300\nSo we understand our vision, and now we\nwant to look at where are we right now.\n\n114\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.260\nSo our baseline, now our CSI manager's\ngonna help us with our baseline if we're\n\n115\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.890\nimproving processes, then our process\nowner's gonna help us with our baseline.\n\n116\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.450\nAnd our baseline can incorporate,\n\n117\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.890\nif we look in the middle here,\nit can incorporate things like security.\n\n118\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.760\nIt could be security baseline.\n\n119\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.108\nIt could incorporate teams like\nstrategy and finance, and data center.\n\n120\n00:07:12.108 --> 00:07:15.690\nThey're all going to help\nus identify our baseline.\n\n121\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.810\nWhere do I want to be?\n\n122\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.145\nAnd our baseline will be completely\ndependent on the type of improvement that\n\n123\n00:07:21.145 --> 00:07:22.270\nwe want to make, as well.\n\n124\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.300\nA baseline measurement\nis just a measurement.\n\n125\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.490\nAnd we already mentioned in numerous\nsessions over the course of\n\n126\n00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.060\nthe ITIL intermediate classes that\nyou don't just take a baseline for\n\n127\n00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.430\nthe sake of taking the metric okay?\n\n128\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.360\nBecause we've got too many metrics in IT.\n\n129\n00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.059\nSo we've got to take a baseline that is\nrelevant to the improvement initiative.\n\n130\n00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:52.838\nI can tell you now the engine\nsize of my car is six liter.\n\n131\n00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:55.050\nThere you go, that's the baseline right?\n\n132\n00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.398\nIt's a measurement it's a snapshot\nof where I'm right now okay.\n\n133\n00:07:59.398 --> 00:08:04.112\nBut what I actually wanna do is put\na server in that room next door.\n\n134\n00:08:04.112 --> 00:08:06.390\nHm, so\nhow that's baseline going to help me?\n\n135\n00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.140\nIt's not, okay?\n\n136\n00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.640\nSo we don't just take measurements for\nthe sake of taking measurements.\n\n137\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.660\nThe baseline that we need to take\nis the size of the room next door.\n\n138\n00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.650\nIt's the number of power outlets we have.\n\n139\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.850\nIt's the capacity for increasing the air\nconditioning in that room next door.\n\n140\n00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.970\nThat's the baseline that we want to take.\n\n141\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.300\nSo baselines have to be relevant,\n\n142\n00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.085\njust like every other metric\nwithin IT it has to be relevant.\n\n143\n00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:36.880\nSo then we work out our short term plans\nof exactly where do we want to be.\n\n144\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.172\nAnd these will include our sponsors,\nour executive sponsors,\n\n145\n00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:44.315\nseniors management, CSI manager.\n\n146\n00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:51.755\nWe put a lot of importance on having\nthe buy in from senior management.\n\n147\n00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:56.160\nSenior management should not just be\nfigureheads, senior management should be\n\n148\n00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.100\nthe people that drive any improvements and\ninitiatives.\n\n149\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.554\nIf you do not have the buy in, and\nyou don't have the visibility of senior\n\n150\n00:09:05.554 --> 00:09:09.290\nmanagement, then very,\nvery quickly, momentum is lost.\n\n151\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.040\nAnd people will start drifting\nback into old ways of working.\n\n152\n00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.833\nSo it's really important that we have\nthat reinforcement, that visibility, and\n\n153\n00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:18.521\nthat buy in for m senior management.\n\n154\n00:09:18.521 --> 00:09:22.916\nAnd then when we do our project planning\nand how do we get there, well we consider\n\n155\n00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:27.380\nwhat our process owners want to see if\nwe're especially improving the process,\n\n156\n00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.620\nwe would look at our project manages.\n\n157\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.919\nIf it's a large improvement initiative,\nwe look at our CSI register,\n\n158\n00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:37.860\nand we'll cover that in another\nsession in a lot more detail, but\n\n159\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.818\nour CSI register is just a database\nof improvement initiatives.\n\n160\n00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:47.127\nOkay, so we'll look at exactly what we\nwant to achieve from that CSI register,\n\n161\n00:09:47.127 --> 00:09:51.964\nand again we're gonna involve the CSI\nmanager and the process owners and\n\n162\n00:09:51.964 --> 00:09:53.170\nthose sponsors.\n\n163\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.539\nAnd then that next arrow,\nthat arrow between number 3 and\n\n164\n00:09:56.539 --> 00:10:01.355\nnumber 4 that's the longest arrow ever in\nsome instances because that's where we\n\n165\n00:10:01.355 --> 00:10:03.260\nundertake the project.\n\n166\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.930\nAnd so that could Take as\nlittle as five minutes or\n\n167\n00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.330\nit could take as long as six\nmonths to a year to implement.\n\n168\n00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.550\nAnd so when we get to number 4 then\nwe're looking at did we get there?\n\n169\n00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.938\nAnd did we get there?\n\n170\n00:10:15.938 --> 00:10:19.728\nVery similar to where we are right now,\nwe're doing exactly the same,\n\n171\n00:10:19.728 --> 00:10:23.590\nwe're taking that baseline so\nthat we can make a comparison.\n\n172\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.200\nOnly we'll also be looking at the KPIs and\n\n173\n00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.680\nmanagement report that we identified\nin number two and where do want to be.\n\n174\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.340\nAnd, we'll also look at the CSI register\nto make sure that's it has been updated.\n\n175\n00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.570\nAnd again, we want our CSI managers and\nprocess managers, etc, involved in this.\n\n176\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.016\nSo if you remember from your\nfoundation recap that ITIL is,\n\n177\n00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:53.212\nwell, it's a set of publications.\n\n178\n00:10:53.212 --> 00:10:58.190\nITIL itself, it tells you what it\nis here IT Infrastructure Library.\n\n179\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.370\nIt's a set of books okay?\n\n180\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:05.100\nAnd so, in ITIL, we looked at\nthe concept of a life of a service and\n\n181\n00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.490\nthe lives of our services, and we start\nout in strategy with our ideas and\n\n182\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.710\nthen that idea is approved\nin the business case.\n\n183\n00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.312\nAnd the approved business case\nis given to a project team and\n\n184\n00:11:16.312 --> 00:11:18.256\nin design we design that idea and\n\n185\n00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:23.170\nthen that service design package is\nproduced and handed to service transition.\n\n186\n00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.870\nAnd at service transition we build and\nwe test.\n\n187\n00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.810\nAnd we deploy that live service now and\n\n188\n00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:37.260\nthrough early life support we actually\nhand over that service to operations.\n\n189\n00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.558\nAnd operations is where we\nhave the business as usual.\n\n190\n00:11:39.558 --> 00:11:43.170\nAnd, of course CSI oversees\nabsolutely everything.\n\n191\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.796\nAnd as I've said in a previous\nsession I like to think CSI\n\n192\n00:11:46.796 --> 00:11:50.210\nhaving its tendrils in\nabsolutely everything.\n\n193\n00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.911\nBecause absolutely everything\ncan be improved everything.\n\n194\n00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:58.584\nThink of CSI as that little voice\non your shoulder that says,\n\n195\n00:11:58.584 --> 00:12:00.250\nI think we could do better.\n\n196\n00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.376\nSo, in strategy, as a recap,\nyou see, service strategy looks at\n\n197\n00:12:06.376 --> 00:12:11.710\nstrategy itself at our IT is an asset\nto the strategy of the organization.\n\n198\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.696\nAnd that's what we mean\nby strategic asset,\n\n199\n00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:19.360\nis that we need to be an asset to\nthe strategy of the organization.\n\n200\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.793\nYou know what, if our organization\ndoesn't value us then they're\n\n201\n00:12:23.793 --> 00:12:27.851\nvery quickly going to look for\nalternative options for them.\n\n202\n00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:29.900\nThey have to value us.\n\n203\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.990\nSometimes value can not be\nquantified just in money.\n\n204\n00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.520\nOkay, value can also be quantified\nin things like experience, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.924\nThe knowledge of our stuff, the way that\nwe are organized, the way that we work.\n\n206\n00:12:43.924 --> 00:12:49.240\nAs well as our ability to\nensure legislative compliance.\n\n207\n00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:54.283\nI always get myself caught up on that\nword, [LAUGH] Legislative, see I told you,\n\n208\n00:12:54.283 --> 00:12:59.130\ncame in the highest although\nmaybe business ethics as well.\n\n209\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.290\nIf we are not a value to the organization,\n\n210\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.930\nthen our organization will look for\nalternatives that will be valuable.\n\n211\n00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.300\nSo in Service Design then we take\nthe ideas that we come up within\n\n212\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.080\nService Strategy and we develop\nthem as we said, we design them.\n\n213\n00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.920\nAnd one of the analogies that I\nused during our foundation recap,\n\n214\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.266\nwas that analogy of building a house,\nokay?\n\n215\n00:13:26.266 --> 00:13:31.000\nSo instead of a strategy we go to the bank\nand say, can I have some money please?\n\n216\n00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.660\nIn the service design\nwe've now got the money or\n\n217\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.210\nat least we've got the authorization,\n\n218\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.982\ncuz I don't know a bank that will give us\na huge big pile of money, unfortunately.\n\n219\n00:13:38.982 --> 00:13:42.520\n[LAUGH] And we go to the architect\nof service design and we say,\n\n220\n00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.040\nhey design this for us.\n\n221\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.530\nAnd at the end of service design the\narchitect gives us a comprehensive blue\n\n222\n00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.882\nprint and it's not just a blueprint for\n\n223\n00:13:50.882 --> 00:13:53.820\nthe layout of the house\nis going to look like.\n\n224\n00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.800\nBut it's a blue print for\n\n225\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.440\nabsolutely everything including how\nwe're going to use all these appliances.\n\n226\n00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.495\nAnd where we're going to\nbuy our groceries from,\n\n227\n00:14:02.495 --> 00:14:05.704\nwho's going to supply us\nwith our utilities, etc.\n\n228\n00:14:05.704 --> 00:14:08.420\nAnd that's handed over\nto Service Transition.\n\n229\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.627\nSo think of those as the builders and\nthe contractors, and\n\n230\n00:14:10.627 --> 00:14:13.480\nthey're the people that are actually\ngonna be building that house for us.\n\n231\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.190\nThey're gonna be building that service.\n\n232\n00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.750\nAnd then they are going to be\ndeploying that service into the life\n\n233\n00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.969\nenvironment through early-life support.\n\n234\n00:14:23.969 --> 00:14:27.860\nIn other words, we don't just hand\nover the keys and then run away.\n\n235\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.865\nWe hand over the keys to the house,\nand then we say, come on in and\n\n236\n00:14:30.865 --> 00:14:32.769\nlet me Me show you how to use everything.\n\n237\n00:14:32.769 --> 00:14:36.306\nNow service operation as a whole,\nas a life cycle phase,\n\n238\n00:14:36.306 --> 00:14:38.775\nis not as stubborn as me.\n\n239\n00:14:38.775 --> 00:14:42.415\nOkay, cuz I'm the person that takes\nthe keys off the contractors and\n\n240\n00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:44.255\nsays that's okay, I can do this.\n\n241\n00:14:44.255 --> 00:14:46.815\nThe service operation is not like that.\n\n242\n00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:51.073\nService operation wants to be as involved\nas possible in the building of the house\n\n243\n00:14:51.073 --> 00:14:52.649\nthat's definitely like me.\n\n244\n00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:58.012\n[LAUGH] Service operation also, wants to\nensure that before that contractor leaves,\n\n245\n00:14:58.012 --> 00:15:01.591\nthat they've told us absolutely\neverything that we need to know.\n\n246\n00:15:01.591 --> 00:15:05.317\nThat I know how to operate all\nof this high tech gadgetry and\n\n247\n00:15:05.317 --> 00:15:07.840\nwidgetry that I've got in this house.\n\n248\n00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.570\nSo, service design or service transition\ndoesn't just leave at that point in time.\n\n249\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.190\nWe have this early life support period.\n\n250\n00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.360\nCSI, obviously is everything.\n\n251\n00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.160\nAnd if CSI sees a process that could\nbe improved, CSI will interrupt and\n\n252\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.600\nsay, I think that could be improved.\n\n253\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.270\nIf CSI looks at that person that's tiling\nthe shower room in my brand new house and\n\n254\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.550\nsays, you know what?\n\n255\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:37.130\nThose tiles don't quite fit, or\nthose tiles aren't quite the right color.\n\n256\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.621\nI think I'd like something different, then\nCSI is the person that says, hey look,\n\n257\n00:15:41.621 --> 00:15:43.590\nlet's do this a different way.\n\n258\n00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.150\nBecause it's more efficient or\nbecause it's more effective.\n\n259\n00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.890\nSo CSI has involvement in\nabsolutely everything.\n\n260\n00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:55.024\nAnd just like your contractor, they will\nlearn as they're building that house.\n\n261\n00:15:55.024 --> 00:15:57.612\nAnd they'll say hey look,\nwe've done this a different way.\n\n262\n00:15:57.612 --> 00:16:01.614\nWe've done the cabling in a completely\ndifferent way to how we normally do it and\n\n263\n00:16:01.614 --> 00:16:02.283\nthis works.\n\n264\n00:16:02.283 --> 00:16:05.575\nSo we're going to carry this on\nin all of our future projects.\n\n265\n00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:07.550\nThat's exactly what CSI does.\n\n266\n00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.240\nIt improves everything,\nnot just operations.\n\n267\n00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.630\nIt improves everything, but\nCSI also keeps operations up to date too.\n\n268\n00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.900\nSo CSI also ensures that now that\nI'm in my house, that that nice,\n\n269\n00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.555\nfancy refrigerator that I wanted with\na big TV screen on the front that was\n\n270\n00:16:24.555 --> 00:16:27.028\nconnected to all of my other devices.\n\n271\n00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:32.336\nWell, CSI makes sure that in a couple of\nyears time, because I am the way I am,\n\n272\n00:16:32.336 --> 00:16:36.277\nthat they're out there\nevaluating new refrigerators.\n\n273\n00:16:36.277 --> 00:16:39.561\nBecause once it's reached two years old,\nthe technology's gone past it and\n\n274\n00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:41.115\ntherefore I need a new one, right?\n\n275\n00:16:41.115 --> 00:16:45.567\n[LAUGH] So here you have all of\nyour processes outlined then in\n\n276\n00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:51.099\nService Strategy, in Service Design,\nin Transition and in Operation.\n\n277\n00:16:51.099 --> 00:16:54.560\nAnd then CSI,\nwe're going to look at the CSI approach.\n\n278\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.437\nAnd we're going to look more in-depth\nat the seven step improvement process.\n\n279\n00:16:58.437 --> 00:17:02.982\nAnd we are also going to look\nat the demi-cycle as well,\n\n280\n00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:09.000\nwhich is another intuitive approach\nto continual service improvement.\n\n281\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.601\nNow it's really, really important, at this\npoint in time I want you to spend a few\n\n282\n00:17:13.601 --> 00:17:18.310\nminutes just looking at those processes\nand understanding those processes.\n\n283\n00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.520\nAnd just in a moment,\n\n284\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.900\nI'm going to give you an exercise to do\nbecause I want you to go away and every\n\n285\n00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.910\nsingle process that you see on that slide\nin front of you, every single process,\n\n286\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:34.210\nI would like you to identify the\nobjectives for each of these processes.\n\n287\n00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.050\nBecause we've got to\nimprove these processes,\n\n288\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:41.570\nif you don't know what the processes\ndo you can't improve them.\n\n289\n00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:46.020\nSo key to the next sessions,\nthe following sessions in this class,\n\n290\n00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.820\nis going to be understanding\nthe objectives of all of these processes.\n\n291\n00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.200\nEvery single one.\n\n292\n00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.530\nI need you to be very, very clear, and\n\n293\n00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.650\nvery comfortable with the objectives\nof every single process.\n\n294\n00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.620\nBecause at any point in time I\nmight use the example, of say,\n\n295\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.070\nmaking improvements to financial\nmanagement, for instance.\n\n296\n00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:10.180\nWell if you don't understand what\nfinancial management does, then it's going\n\n297\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.510\nto be very difficult for you to follow\nalong with what we're talking about.\n\n298\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.930\nAnd financial management is\none of those processes that's\n\n299\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.270\ngot some quite complex objectives.\n\n300\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.400\nAnd we've got accounting, budgeting, and\ncharging within financial management, but\n\n301\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.380\nwe also have to think\nabout value on investment\n\n302\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.710\nas opposed to return on investment,\nwhich is about that financial return.\n\n303\n00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.230\nYour value is about a value return.\n\n304\n00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.550\nWe've also got to think\nabout depreciation,\n\n305\n00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:40.230\nwe've also got to think about\nthe total cost of ownership, and\n\n306\n00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:45.990\nwe've also got to think about\nthe actual return on any given service.\n\n307\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.703\nWhich we have to take into consideration\nuptime and downtime of a service\n\n308\n00:18:52.703 --> 00:18:58.888\nbecause of course downtime of a service\nthen strips away at that return, okay?\n\n309\n00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:03.493\nSo at any point in time over the next few\nsessions throughout this class we could be\n\n310\n00:19:03.493 --> 00:19:06.080\nlooking at any one of these processes.\n\n311\n00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.740\nSo in a moment I am going\nto ask you to go away and\n\n312\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.580\nto spend an hour not just\nreviewing CSI objectives,\n\n313\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.259\nbut also reviewing the objectives of\nevery single one of your processes.\n\n314\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.850\nSo here in our lifecycle\nwheel as we call it,\n\n315\n00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.440\nin our hub, we've got Service Strategy\nright in the middle, and Service Strategy\n\n316\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.190\nis where we come up with our ideas and\nour policies and our directions.\n\n317\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.920\nAnd in Service Design we design\nthat service, we transition it.\n\n318\n00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.310\nWe build, test, and\nimplement in Service Transition and\n\n319\n00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.980\nwe run in Service Operation.\n\n320\n00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:49.330\nAnd you will see that CSI\nencompasses absolutely everything.\n\n321\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:55.680\nSo, as I've asked you to do then,\nI would like you now please to go away\n\n322\n00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.480\nand to review all of\nthe processes within ITIL.\n\n323\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.380\nLook back at the previous slide,\nlet me pull that slide up for\n\n324\n00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.840\nyou, if it's something that\nyou need to prompt you.\n\n325\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.940\nBut I'd like you to review all of\nthe objectives and all of the scope and\n\n326\n00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:19.020\npurpose of all of those processes and\nwe will see you in the next session.\n\n327\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.016\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\n\n328\n00:20:21.016 --> 00:20:23.835\nhelping us as we continue to\ntake a look at these scopes and\n\n329\n00:20:23.835 --> 00:20:27.270\nthese different objectives that\nwe've been talking about for CSI.\n\n330\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.294\nIt really is helpful.\n\n331\n00:20:28.294 --> 00:20:31.602\nMake sure you do the activity\nhere to get ready for\n\n332\n00:20:31.602 --> 00:20:36.640\nsome of your ITIL challenges in\nthe future, such as the exam as well.\n\n333\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.270\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode, then.\n\n334\n00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.390\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n335\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.530\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n336\n00:20:43.530

Jo tells us about the keys to success of CSI and recommended use of Kotterâ€™s 8 step to transformational changes.  She also discusses the need for the responsible person for CSI and the authoritative person for CSI.  Another factor to keep CSI on track is the use of the csi registerâ€”a list of improvement opportunities that give everyone a voice to recommend an improvement too.  Lastly, she describes the how SLM and DIKW play a role in CSI success.",

00:00:04.364\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:07.089\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.766\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:14.720\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.170\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.790\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ngonna be taking a look at CSI principles\n\n9\n00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.970\nand here to help us of course is gonna be\nthe ITIL superstar herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.530\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very,\nmuch Ronnie, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.433\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, now Jo, we've already\ntalked about the scope and the objectives,\n\n13\n00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:42.660\nwhat makes this different when we move\ninto the realm of CSI principles here?\n\n14\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.400\n&gt;&gt; So what we're looking at in\nthis particular session is we're\n\n15\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.900\nlooking at what has to happen in order for\nCSI to work.\n\n16\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.800\nSo in the previous sessions we\nlooked at the objectives of CSI,\n\n17\n00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.750\nwhat CSI Is trying to achieve?\n\n18\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.880\nWe also looked at the scope of CSI,\nwhich is pretty much everything.\n\n19\n00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.860\nWe can sum that up in one word.\n\n20\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.990\nAnd now we're looking at\nwhat we have to do in CSI,\n\n21\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.740\nwhat we have to have in order for\nit to be successful.\n\n22\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.612\nSo we're starting off then [LAUGH]\nwith our first slide, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:18.600\nAnd our first slide really\nlooks at organizational change.\n\n24\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.840\nThis goes without saying,\nhence the silent pause there,\n\n25\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.050\n[LAUGH] because this should\nbe fairly obvious, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.480\nLook at that middle bullet point there.\n\n27\n00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.130\nAnd that middle bullet point tells you\nthat people generally don't like to change\n\n28\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.860\nwithout some reason to do it.\n\n29\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.920\nWe're going to expand on this,\n\n30\n00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.340\na huge amount a little bit later\non in subsequent episodes.\n\n31\n00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.980\nBut let me just think about this for\na moment.\n\n32\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.329\nLet me just sow some\nseeds into your minds.\n\n33\n00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.740\nEven if you want to change, even if you\nwant to do something completely different,\n\n34\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.430\nyou're still nervous, and\nyou're still anxious about it.\n\n35\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.798\nI mentioned some anxiety on that last\nbullet point and this is where we truly.\n\n36\n00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:04.060\nYou know what, I know a lot of\npeople that even though they\n\n37\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.945\nhate the cellphone that\nthey got right now,\n\n38\n00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:09.690\nthey don't wanna change because they\nknow what they've got right now.\n\n39\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.520\nAnd because they 're used to it.\n\n40\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.650\nAnd this goes throughout the whole of IT.\n\n41\n00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.530\nBut it doesn't just go\nthroughout the whole of IT,\n\n42\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.120\nit actually goes throughout\nour entire lives.\n\n43\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.330\nAnd so here at CSI, we will be spending,\nin subsequent episodes,\n\n44\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.090\nwe'll be spending some time looking\nat psychological effect and\n\n45\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.430\nactually looking at\norganizational change management.\n\n46\n00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.950\nThis is not just about the technology,\nbecause in order for\n\n47\n00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.190\nthe technology to succeed,\npeople have got to use it.\n\n48\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.560\nAnd in order to get people to use the\ntechnology, they've got to want to use it.\n\n49\n00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.230\nIf you don't want to use something,\nthen you're going to try and\n\n50\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.230\nfind any way not to, to the point of even\n\n51\n00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.570\nmaybe discovering faults within\nthat particular piece of equipment.\n\n52\n00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.880\nAnd I know that this happened before and\nI know that I've seen evidence of this in\n\n53\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.970\nvarious organizations where, we don't\nconvince people of the need to change.\n\n54\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.780\nBy the way,\nit's not just about convincing them.\n\n55\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.948\nIt's actually about generating a need,\nand generating a desire to change.\n\n56\n00:03:15.948 --> 00:03:20.186\nIt's not good, just good enough for you to\nconvince somebody that it's a good idea.\n\n57\n00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:22.330\nThey've actually gotta be hungry for\nchange.\n\n58\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.828\nThey've got to want change.\n\n59\n00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:29.676\nIf we're trying to upgrade or\nchange an environment within IT,\n\n60\n00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:33.010\nthen the people have got to be hungry for\nit.\n\n61\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.770\nThey've got to be ready for it.\n\n62\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.220\nAnd they've got to be\nwilling to make that change.\n\n63\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.931\nI have mentioned in previous\nsessions within CSI of\n\n64\n00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:46.132\na organization that I worked with\nthat actually wanted to change their\n\n65\n00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:50.334\nenvironment from a Windows environment\nto an Apple environment, and\n\n66\n00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:54.838\nI used that as an example because\nthat's actually quite a drastic change.\n\n67\n00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:59.690\nNow, if you have been used to a Microsoft\nWindows machine all your life and\n\n68\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.660\nlet's face it Windows has been around for\nquite a number of years now.\n\n69\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.170\nAnd you've been used to that all your\nlife and somebody comes along and\n\n70\n00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.140\nputs in Apple machine in front of you,\nthat's one heck of a difference.\n\n71\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.440\nAnd sure, you can browse\nthe Internet with it, that's great.\n\n72\n00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.070\nAnd you can use Word, and\nyou can use Excel, and\n\n73\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.290\nyou can use all of the Microsoft\napplications, and that's not a problem.\n\n74\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.820\nBut the simple fact is that the way\nit works is completely different.\n\n75\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.580\nAnd so, even just to the point\nof closing a window,\n\n76\n00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.120\ngoing to the top left hand corner\nof a window instead of the top\n\n77\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.532\nright hand corner of a window\ncan take some getting used to.\n\n78\n00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:46.160\nSo, unless you can find\nwhat drives the person and\n\n79\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.820\nfind what they really are desperate for\nand\n\n80\n00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.180\nthen you can sell that\ntechnology to that need.\n\n81\n00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.610\nUnless you can find that,\nthen you're never gonna be successful with\n\n82\n00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.070\nthat change because they're\ngoing to be resistant to it,\n\n83\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.440\nbecause it's not going to work\nthe way that they want it to work.\n\n84\n00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.200\nIt's not going to be the same.\n\n85\n00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.016\nSo organizational change is\none of the principles to CSI.\n\n86\n00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:15.688\nWe have to accept that people matter.\n\n87\n00:05:15.688 --> 00:05:19.480\nNow when we looked in service\noperation we looked at people as well.\n\n88\n00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.560\nAnd we said that people really matter and\npeople are going to drive success.\n\n89\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.610\nWell, people are gonna drive success\nin continual service improvement.\n\n90\n00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.130\nOn this next page here we\nlook at Kotter's eight steps.\n\n91\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.748\nKotter's eight steps of\ntransformational change.\n\n92\n00:05:34.748 --> 00:05:39.675\nNow, Kotter, JP Kotter,\nis an alumni of Harvard and\n\n93\n00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:45.486\nhe looked a transformational\nchange within an organization.\n\n94\n00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:47.386\nAnd he looked at the drivers for\n\n95\n00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:50.610\ntransformational change\nwithin an organization.\n\n96\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.988\nAnd we actually utilize these eight steps\nthroughout an IT service management.\n\n97\n00:05:56.988 --> 00:06:01.452\nBut really that first bullet point is, I'm\nnot gonna say it's the most important but\n\n98\n00:06:01.452 --> 00:06:04.444\nit's certainly the one that\nwe've got to acknowledge.\n\n99\n00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:09.490\nAnd it's the one we've got to address is\nthat establishing the sense of urgency is\n\n100\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.833\ncreating a need, creating a hunger, like I\nsaid it's not just good enough to convince\n\n101\n00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:19.664\nsomebody that change is important,\nthey actually have to have that hunger and\n\n102\n00:06:19.664 --> 00:06:22.610\nthey have to have that,\nor perceive that need.\n\n103\n00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.820\nNow, I will be the first person to\nget involved with new technology.\n\n104\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.484\nI am probably the world's,\nam I the world's best,\n\n105\n00:06:30.484 --> 00:06:33.326\nor the world's worst in terms of sales?\n\n106\n00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:37.072\nAnd one respect I'm probably\ntheir ultimate dream,\n\n107\n00:06:37.072 --> 00:06:42.780\nbecause when it comes to technology\nthey can sell me absolutely anything.\n\n108\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.790\nBut then when it comes to houses and\ncars and things like that,\n\n109\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.750\nthen I'm probably the last person that\nyou would want to walk through your door.\n\n110\n00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:56.170\nBut at the same time I understand\nthat a lot of this is about myself.\n\n111\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.970\nAnd it's about the fact\nthat I perceive a need for\n\n112\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.100\nabsolutely everything that\nI see when it comes to IT.\n\n113\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.420\nAnd if there's something\nnew on the marketplace,\n\n114\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.180\nif there's some new form\nof wearable technology,\n\n115\n00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.812\nI don't even need to know what it does,\nto know that I need this thing.\n\n116\n00:07:11.812 --> 00:07:16.400\nWell and I need it so desperately,\nthat I will be the person that will\n\n117\n00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.610\nbe waiting for it to arrive on launch\nday because I have to have it.\n\n118\n00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.210\nMost people aren't as gullible as me.\n\n119\n00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.210\n[LAUGH] Most people certainly within\nour organization are not as receptive\n\n120\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.110\nto IT change.\n\n121\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.410\nEspecially if they've had processes and\n\n122\n00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.010\npolicies embedded in their\norganization for a long time.\n\n123\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.520\nIf you have been using a Windows\nmachine for 10, 15 years and\n\n124\n00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.150\nthen somebody comes along and says well\nI'm gonna give you something else.\n\n125\n00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.490\nAnd they could sell it to you and\n\n126\n00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.020\nsay hey I'm going to give\nyou something shiny and new.\n\n127\n00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.490\nAs far as they're concerned they\ndon't want the shiny and new.\n\n128\n00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.321\nThey want things to remain\nthe way that they are.\n\n129\n00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:59.886\nAnd can we not just upgrade\nthis maybe just a little bit?\n\n130\n00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:01.037\nCan we not just tweak it?\n\n131\n00:08:01.037 --> 00:08:02.066\nDo we have to?\n\n132\n00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:03.999\nCompletely change.\n\n133\n00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:07.081\nAnd this is where change fails.\n\n134\n00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:09.488\nThis is where transformation fails,\n\n135\n00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:14.840\nwhen we don't understand the needs of the\norganization and the needs of the people.\n\n136\n00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.375\nAnd it's not just about the technology.\n\n137\n00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:22.350\nAnd it's not just about driving that\ntechnology into the organization.\n\n138\n00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:28.330\nIt's actually about convincing people that\nthe technology is actually what they want.\n\n139\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.751\nBecause until we can do that,\nthen change is not going to happen.\n\n140\n00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:35.154\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, when you talk about\nthis idea of establishing that sense of\n\n141\n00:08:35.154 --> 00:08:38.503\nurgency, and this is really asking\nmore about your experience here, and\n\n142\n00:08:38.503 --> 00:08:42.080\ndealing with organizations where\nyou've talked about this before.\n\n143\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.545\nHave you sensed that the pain point is\nreally what establishes the urgency for\n\n144\n00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:49.227\nthat organization, or\n\n145\n00:08:49.227 --> 00:08:54.103\nis that whoever is bringing that\ntechnology that says it's better,\n\n146\n00:08:54.103 --> 00:08:59.424\nyou'll see so much more efficiency at\nthis, that they just jump on board.\n\n147\n00:08:59.424 --> 00:09:03.345\nSo I always think it's the pain when\nthey realize that they can't accomplish\n\n148\n00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:04.687\nanything before they go.\n\n149\n00:09:04.687 --> 00:09:08.635\nWe really do need a new system rather\nthan the best salesman in the world.\n\n150\n00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:12.855\nWhat's your experience on that?\n&gt;&gt; It can be a mixture of a lot of things.\n\n151\n00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:18.055\nOne of the big drivers to success is\nactually culture of the organization,\n\n152\n00:09:18.055 --> 00:09:19.135\nin all fairness.\n\n153\n00:09:19.135 --> 00:09:23.473\nThe culture of an organization\nIs really important.\n\n154\n00:09:23.473 --> 00:09:27.326\nIf you're in an organization where\ntransformation is the norm and\n\n155\n00:09:27.326 --> 00:09:29.550\nwhere innovation is the norm.\n\n156\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.822\nAnd where employees are encouraged\nto be innovative, and\n\n157\n00:09:33.822 --> 00:09:38.966\nwhere staff are encouraged to maybe\nbring their own devices and to look\n\n158\n00:09:38.966 --> 00:09:45.006\nat innovative ways of doing things, and\nare encouraged to think outside the box.\n\n159\n00:09:45.006 --> 00:09:48.072\nAnd then, there's generally not that\nmuch of a resistance to change.\n\n160\n00:09:48.072 --> 00:09:52.787\nAnd so there doesn't have to be any\npaying point in that type of organization\n\n161\n00:09:52.787 --> 00:09:57.350\nbecause quite simply they're eager,\nthey're hungry for change.\n\n162\n00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.380\nAnd if somebody says to them, hey look\nthese are the benefits we foresee,\n\n163\n00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.290\nyou still feel empowered enough to be able\nto give their opinion on whether those\n\n164\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:11.770\nbenefits will come to fruition or not,\nthen there's no resistance to change that.\n\n165\n00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:16.740\nIn an organization, though, that's in\nthe strategy of just running the business.\n\n166\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.320\nThen yes, you're completely right, you\nhave to quite often highlight the pain.\n\n167\n00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.070\nAnd I don't mean highlight\nthe pain by making it worse.\n\n168\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean highlight the pain by\n\n169\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.430\narticulating those pain points and say\nlook, I know that this is difficult for\n\n170\n00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.990\nyou and I know that you're experiencing\nproblems in this, this and this.\n\n171\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.870\nThen if we implement this new\ntechnology then this will actually\n\n172\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.430\nfacilitate this process for you.\n\n173\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.500\nSo yes, pain can play a part but\nculture plays a bigger part.\n\n174\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.920\nAnd this is why we put a lot\nof emphasis on culture.\n\n175\n00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.309\nBecause it's not just about pain.\n\n176\n00:10:52.309 --> 00:10:55.239\nYou don't just upgrade your cell\nphone because the one you've\n\n177\n00:10:55.239 --> 00:10:58.940\ngot right now isn't working,\nor because it's got a failure.\n\n178\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.090\nSure, you might upgrade your cell phone\nif the one you've got right now has\n\n179\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.330\nbeen suffering some form of failure.\n\n180\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.602\nBut that wouldn't be\nyour number one driver.\n\n181\n00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:12.158\nGenerally, an organization that's very\ngood at service strategy will release\n\n182\n00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:15.670\na new cell phone and\nyou will have that hunger for it.\n\n183\n00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.610\nAnd it's got nothing to do with paying and\n\n184\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.520\neverything to do with that fact that\nyou want to have that new cell phone.\n\n185\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.540\nSo let's take a look\nat CSI ownership then.\n\n186\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.128\nAnd again,\nthis is another principal to CSI and\n\n187\n00:11:28.128 --> 00:11:30.336\nwe need to have this in order to succeed.\n\n188\n00:11:30.336 --> 00:11:33.860\nSomebody has to be responsible for\nimprovement.\n\n189\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:39.472\nI know that I said in previous CSI\nsessions that maintaining the status quo,\n\n190\n00:11:39.472 --> 00:11:42.930\neven still, that requires a change.\n\n191\n00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.639\nEven still, we have to be aligned\nto the needs of the business and\n\n192\n00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:50.141\nwe have to be aligned to the vision\nof the organization even if\n\n193\n00:11:50.141 --> 00:11:52.840\nthe vision is just to\nmaintain the status quo.\n\n194\n00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.214\nSo we have to have somebody\nthat takes accountability for\n\n195\n00:11:56.214 --> 00:11:58.261\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n196\n00:11:58.261 --> 00:12:00.900\nSo we need to have a CSI Manager.\n\n197\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.690\nAnd a CSI Manager is somebody\nwho takes accountability.\n\n198\n00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:09.241\nFor that CSI improvement, and\nhe owns all CSI initiatives.\n\n199\n00:12:09.241 --> 00:12:11.990\nAnd I like the use of the term advocate.\n\n200\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.250\nHe becomes that chief advocate.\n\n201\n00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.450\nHe's the person that will sell CSI.\n\n202\n00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.369\nHe's the person that takes\nthe accountability for\n\n203\n00:12:19.369 --> 00:12:23.570\nselling change as it were for\norganizational change.\n\n204\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:28.478\nNow, that doesn't mean he has the\nresponsibility because I don't expect my\n\n205\n00:12:28.478 --> 00:12:31.710\nCSI manager to know absolutely everything.\n\n206\n00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:37.851\nIf you're in an organization where\nyou've got 10,000 analysts within IT and\n\n207\n00:12:37.851 --> 00:12:43.224\nthen the organization itself has got\n3 million people within its staff.\n\n208\n00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:44.622\nAnd then, of course,\n\n209\n00:12:44.622 --> 00:12:49.340\nhaving one CSI manager he's not\ngoing to know absolutely everything.\n\n210\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.730\nAbout all of the technology within IT.\n\n211\n00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.730\nAnd I don't expect that, but I do expect\nsomebody to be that figurehead and\n\n212\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.990\nsomeone to have accountability.\n\n213\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.375\nNow he will delegate\nresponsibilities as he sees fit, and\n\n214\n00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:06.230\nof course all process owners have that\nresponsibility for CSI in their processes.\n\n215\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.432\nAnd service owners as we look\ndown in our foundation recap,\n\n216\n00:13:10.432 --> 00:13:16.980\nservice owners have a responsibility for\nCSI within that particular service itself.\n\n217\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:22.670\nSo as we said there, the CSI owner,\nthe CSI manager is accountable.\n\n218\n00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:27.190\nAnd his role is to make sure\nthat people do take on CSI.\n\n219\n00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.704\nAnd make sure that CSI's happening and\n\n220\n00:13:29.704 --> 00:13:32.910\nwe've got those ongoing\niterative activities.\n\n221\n00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.130\nNow he does take ownership of\nsomething else, as well, and\n\n222\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.040\nhe takes ownership of what\nwe call the CSI Register.\n\n223\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.221\nThe CSI Register is quite often something\nthat when I go into an organization,\n\n224\n00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:50.955\nI will say to them straight away,\nokay, your first improvement,\n\n225\n00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.440\nis actually to implement the CSI Register.\n\n226\n00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.820\nAnd a CSI Register can be\nsomething that's really simple.\n\n227\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.010\nIt can be an Excel\nspreadsheet if you want.\n\n228\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.900\nOr it could be a very complex database.\n\n229\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:10.553\nAnd I'll tell you that you should have a\nCSI register for every single process, for\n\n230\n00:14:10.553 --> 00:14:17.220\nevery single service, and for every single\nteam within IT, within our infrastructure.\n\n231\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.090\nIt's a list of improvement opportunities,\nyou might call it a wish list.\n\n232\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.560\nYou might even make your CSI register\navailable to your customers.\n\n233\n00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:32.674\nYou know, that web-based frontend portal\nthey have into the incident management and\n\n234\n00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:36.203\nproblem management call logging system,\nokay?\n\n235\n00:14:36.203 --> 00:14:41.050\nWell, what's the matter of having a\nsuggestions box on that particular portal?\n\n236\n00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.730\nWhat we would like.\n\n237\n00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:48.057\nThat's just a front-end\ninto the CSI register.\n\n238\n00:14:48.057 --> 00:14:52.850\nThe CSI register is where we record\nall of our improvement opportunities.\n\n239\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.800\nIt allows us visibility.\n\n240\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.945\nThe other thing that it allows\nus is the ability to prioritize,\n\n241\n00:14:58.945 --> 00:15:02.847\nbecause if you see something on the CSI\nregister, and you think to yourself, hey,\n\n242\n00:15:02.847 --> 00:15:04.325\nthat sounds like a great idea.\n\n243\n00:15:04.325 --> 00:15:07.628\nThen you can add your weight to that too,\nand\n\n244\n00:15:07.628 --> 00:15:11.925\nyou can maybe add in a little\nhands up that says, I agree.\n\n245\n00:15:11.925 --> 00:15:16.313\nAnd the more people that agree or\nthe more people that want that particular\n\n246\n00:15:16.313 --> 00:15:20.850\nimprovement initiative, then the higher\nup the priority list it goes.\n\n247\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.390\nSo we can understand the impact.\n\n248\n00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.731\nOkay, so we categorize within our CSI\nregister by the size of the improvement,\n\n249\n00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:33.276\na small improvement, might be\nan improvement just to an individual\n\n250\n00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:38.165\nprocess step, or an improvement in\nthe standard operating procedure.\n\n251\n00:15:38.165 --> 00:15:43.321\nOr it might be a change in shift\nrouter for instance within the team,\n\n252\n00:15:43.321 --> 00:15:48.030\nor perhaps a change to small\nfunctionality within a service.\n\n253\n00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.975\nBut you might have medium improvements and\nyou might have large improvements, and\n\n254\n00:15:51.975 --> 00:15:55.534\nlarge improvements might mean\nthe implementation of a brand new process.\n\n255\n00:15:55.534 --> 00:15:58.997\nOr maybe the upgrade\nof a complete service.\n\n256\n00:15:58.997 --> 00:16:04.453\nThat might be A large or even you\nmight consider it to be extra large or\n\n257\n00:16:04.453 --> 00:16:06.387\norganizational wide.\n\n258\n00:16:06.387 --> 00:16:11.000\nYou'd also categorize in your CSI\nregister about the time frame.\n\n259\n00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.920\nIn other words,\nhow quick you can get this implemented.\n\n260\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.190\nAnd don't think that you'd\nreally get anything large.\n\n261\n00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.520\nYou implement it overnight\nbecause it's not going to happen.\n\n262\n00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:26.880\nAll CSI, improvement initiatives\nneed to be evaluated.\n\n263\n00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.510\nAll of them, even the small ones.\n\n264\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.830\nSo don't think that you're gonna get\nanything overnight because you're not.\n\n265\n00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:38.186\nBut the idea of the CSI Register is to\ngive us essential place where we can\n\n266\n00:16:38.186 --> 00:16:40.946\nrecord all of our improvement initiatives,\n\n267\n00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:45.828\nwhere we can prioritize our improvement\ninitiatives and we can evaluate them.\n\n268\n00:16:45.828 --> 00:16:50.540\nAnd also where we can see\nvisible ongoing improvements.\n\n269\n00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:56.456\nSo where we can see that these improvement\ninitiatives are actually happening?\n\n270\n00:16:56.456 --> 00:17:00.262\nOne of the things that happens with\nan organization that doesn't have\n\n271\n00:17:00.262 --> 00:17:04.530\na CSI Register, is that things happen\nin the background, and nobody sees it.\n\n272\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:11.050\nAnd then, the first thing that\nan analyst will tell me is that, well,\n\n273\n00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.040\nwe're fairly static in IT.\n\n274\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.840\nThings don't really change that much.\n\n275\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.400\nNothing seems to happen.\n\n276\n00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.250\nAnd every suggestion that\nI make is just ignored.\n\n277\n00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.250\nAnd every time I go to my manager and\nsay, can we try this and can we try that,\n\n278\n00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.900\nit's It's just ignored.\n\n279\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.230\nWell, if it's in the CSI Register\nthen it's not ignored, it's there and\n\n280\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.690\nit's visible.\n\n281\n00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.490\nAnd then, a decision can be made.\n\n282\n00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.770\nAnd if that decision is made that, no,\nwe're not going to progress that because\n\n283\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:40.570\nwe don't have the urgency or perhaps\nactually it's not a viable suggestion.\n\n284\n00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.900\nAnd that's fine.\n\n285\n00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.660\nThere's nothing wrong with that but\nat least we can see a conscious decision.\n\n286\n00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.320\nAnd when we go back to\norganizational change management and\n\n287\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.680\nwe start talking about\nthe mindset of people and\n\n288\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.920\nconvincing people of change that change is\na good idea, then one of the things that\n\n289\n00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.459\nwe've got to do is make sure\nthat we value their opinions.\n\n290\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.100\nYou don't value somebody's opinion\nby ignoring their opinion.\n\n291\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.111\nWhich is where the CSI Register really,\nreally comes into play.\n\n292\n00:18:08.111 --> 00:18:09.586\nSo the register as it says,\n\n293\n00:18:09.586 --> 00:18:14.220\nis actually a valuable part of the service\nknowledge management system, that SKMS.\n\n294\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.260\nHowever, that register can\njust be an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n295\n00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.860\nIt doesn't necessarily\nhave to be a database.\n\n296\n00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.600\nSo we start off small.\n\n297\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.479\nSo CSI then has an intricate power in\nabsolutely every single life cycle phase\n\n298\n00:18:31.479 --> 00:18:33.880\nand in absolutely every single process.\n\n299\n00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.920\nLet's think about service\nlevel management.\n\n300\n00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.760\nService level management.\n\n301\n00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.770\nWell, we start off in service level\nmanagement way back in service strategy,\n\n302\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.490\nwhere we take those requirements from\nthe business, and we take them and\n\n303\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.680\ndocument them as service\nlevel requirements.\n\n304\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.400\nAnd that service level requirement\ndocument contains the first draft of\n\n305\n00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.230\nthe service level targets, and l use the\nword draft cuz that's really important and\n\n306\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.770\nthen all the time,\nsurround designers around transition,\n\n307\n00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:06.700\nwe negotiate the targets in their\nservice level requirements documents,\n\n308\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.340\nof course, that's part of improvement.\n\n309\n00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.930\nWe're improving our alignment against\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n310\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.429\nSo we do that right away through our\nservice design, our service transition.\n\n311\n00:19:17.429 --> 00:19:22.285\nAnd then, into live operation where\nat the end of early life support,\n\n312\n00:19:22.285 --> 00:19:25.370\nwe agree to service level targets.\n\n313\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:31.960\nAnd then, on a regular basis,\nwe will look to assess performance against\n\n314\n00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.140\nthose service level targets and we do that\nin the service review meetings, as we've\n\n315\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.810\ndiscussed previously in our foundation\nrecap and our foundation classes.\n\n316\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.570\nSo during those service review meetings\nwe come up with a list of improvement\n\n317\n00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.170\nopportunities.\n\n318\n00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.660\nAnd this we call our service\nimprovement plan, so of course,\n\n319\n00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.390\na CSI Manager is, well,\nnot just he'd be interested in that,\n\n320\n00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.700\nits actually part of his remain, is to\nproduce the service improvement plan.\n\n321\n00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.800\nAnd that could be a plan based\non just the user saying,\n\n322\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.510\nhey, look, we'd like a better target.\n\n323\n00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.090\nWe'd like something that's\na little bit more tighter.\n\n324\n00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.390\nWe'd like it to have more\nstringent targets, or\n\n325\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:16.570\nit might be the customer actually\nasks us to change a target because,\n\n326\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.880\nmaybe it's too stringent, or maybe it just\ndoesn't meet their requirements at all.\n\n327\n00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:27.350\nSo right the way throughout service\nlevel management, CSI is evident.\n\n328\n00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.490\nCSI is there.\n\n329\n00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:29.770\nIt's embedded in.\n\n330\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.750\nIt's got those tendrils into\nservice-level management.\n\n331\n00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.230\nThink about using our\nservice catalog as a check.\n\n332\n00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:42.300\nAnd, again,\nwe do that to enforce CSI II because we're\n\n333\n00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:48.450\nalways verifying that all of the services\nin our service catalog have an SLA.\n\n334\n00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:52.810\nAnd that every service that we have an SLA\nfor although this going through the SLA\n\n335\n00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.590\nprocess, every single service is\nmentioned in our service catalog.\n\n336\n00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.410\nAnd that's what CSI will\ntake accountability for,\n\n337\n00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:05.500\nensuring that we've got that necessary\nrelationship between the information,\n\n338\n00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.630\nso that everything is accurate and\nup to date.\n\n339\n00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.080\nAnd then, of course,\nthere's knowledge management.\n\n340\n00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.070\nNow, knowledge management,\nI mentioned previously in the section and\n\n341\n00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.420\nI've mentioned to you in\nour foundation recap,\n\n342\n00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.250\nthat knowledge management is where\nwe take individual sources of data.\n\n343\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.930\nWe add in relationships\nto those data sources.\n\n344\n00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.817\nSo relationships between databases.\n\n345\n00:21:29.817 --> 00:21:32.380\nAnd that gives us information.\n\n346\n00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.450\nAnd then, we analyse that information,\nand then that gives us knowledge.\n\n347\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.910\nWe generally display that by way of a nice\npretty picture, or a nice pretty graph.\n\n348\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.460\nAnd that allows us to make\nan informed decision.\n\n349\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.890\nAnd we use that informed\ndecision to give us wisdom.\n\n350\n00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.404\nAnd put quite simply,\nwe don't produce any reports, or\n\n351\n00:21:53.404 --> 00:21:58.400\nwe don't produce any pretty grass unless\nthey're going to tell us something.\n\n352\n00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.580\nUnless they're going to give us wisdom.\n\n353\n00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.470\nAnd that knowledge that we have\nalso includes experience and\n\n354\n00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.940\nideas and survey results, too.\n\n355\n00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.240\nBecause they also will\nhelp us to achieve wisdom.\n\n356\n00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.366\nAnd the more wisdom that we have, the more\ndecisions that we're able to make and\n\n357\n00:22:16.366 --> 00:22:19.095\nthe more aligned we are to\nthe needs of the business.\n\n358\n00:22:19.095 --> 00:22:22.690\nAnd therefore, CSI is improvement.\n\n359\n00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.809\nAnd you can see here what we call\na DIKW Model by way of a graph.\n\n360\n00:22:26.809 --> 00:22:30.995\nBecause what we want to do is we\nwant to increase our context and\n\n361\n00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:35.750\nwe want to increase our\nunderstanding of our organization.\n\n362\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.570\nNow, just taking you\nback here to this slide,\n\n363\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:43.110\non the lifetime side there's a discussion\npoint, and it says, let's talk.\n\n364\n00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.730\nWhich one of these elements\ncannot be captured in a tool?\n\n365\n00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.320\nWell, of course, wisdom.\n\n366\n00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.360\nWe cannot capture wisdom, but\neverything else we can capture in a tool.\n\n367\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.099\nBut we have to analyze it and\nwe have to make the informed decision.\n\n368\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:03.390\nSo at this particular point in this\nsection, this is where we will say,\n\n369\n00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.250\nwe'd like you to just review the notes\nfrom this particular section.\n\n370\n00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:11.200\nAnd then, we'll be back in part\nthree where we will carry on\n\n371\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.220\nwith the principles of CSI.\n\n372\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jill.\n\n373\n00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:19.220\nWell, thank you again for\nhelping us to go over those concepts\n\n374\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.700\nof our CSI principles that will\nreally help us as we continue on and\n\n375\n00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.042\ntake a look at more of\nthe continual service improvement.\n\n376\n00:23:26.042 --> 00:23:30.060\nUnderstanding that's actually involved in\nevery process in the life cycles that we\n\n377\n00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:35.310\nneed is really going to hopefully\nset the solid understanding of how\n\n378\n00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.433\ninvaluable it is to us, as well.\n\n379\n00:23:37.433 --> 00:23:41.350\nBut that's a great place for us to also\nend this episode then, signing off for\n\n380\n00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.550\nITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n381\n00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.630\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.886\nYou're watching the ITIL\nintermediate CSI show.\n\n7\n00:00:17.886 --> 00:00:20.629\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n8\n00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:25.682\ntoday we're diving into\na part two on CSI principles.\n\n9\n00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:29.309\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be\nthe Oracle on Intel herself is Mrs.\n\n10\n00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.940\nJo Peacock, Jo welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.752\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for\nme Ronnie, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:38.587\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine we've really talked\nabout some of these different CSI\n\n13\n00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:42.618\nprinciples and and really got involve\nthere is a lot of information that.\n\n14\n00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:47.220\nJo, I'm not sure what is really left,\nbut I'm assuming you still got\n\n15\n00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.910\na whole bag of information for\nus that we need to dig through.\n\n16\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.549\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you know me I can talk, right.\n\n17\n00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.145\n[LAUGH] And I can talk about ITIL forever.\n\n18\n00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:59.874\n[LAUGH] Well, I may need to wake\nyou up a little bit later there.\n\n19\n00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:02.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've still got quite a lot\n\n20\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.430\nmore actually to talk about\nwhen we look at the principles.\n\n21\n00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.180\nWe mentioned in our first session in\nCSI when we looked at the scope and\n\n22\n00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.948\nthe objectives, primarily of CSI,\nwe mentioned the CSI approach.\n\n23\n00:01:17.948 --> 00:01:22.911\nAnd one of the things that I said about\nthe CSI approach It is a method for\n\n24\n00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:25.952\niterative, repeatable, improvement.\n\n25\n00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:30.854\nWell as well as that,\nwe would consider the demming cycle to\n\n26\n00:01:30.854 --> 00:01:35.178\nbe a concept for\nhigh level iterative improvement.\n\n27\n00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.300\nIt's a repeatable method for improvement.\n\n28\n00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.728\nAs you can see in the screen\nin front of you, it is a very,\n\n29\n00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:47.086\nvery simple high level use for\nan improvement method.\n\n30\n00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:51.763\nAnd really simply,\nwhat we wanna make sure is that every\n\n31\n00:01:51.763 --> 00:01:55.845\nsingle improvement\ninitiative is iterative and\n\n32\n00:01:55.845 --> 00:02:01.715\nthat it's planned out and that we do\nit and we checked that it worked and\n\n33\n00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:07.816\nthen we take any remedial action and\ndecide what we're going to do next.\n\n34\n00:02:07.816 --> 00:02:10.480\nAnd then we plan it out, we do it,\nand we check that it's worked and\n\n35\n00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.870\nthen we take any remedial action.\n\n36\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.232\nAnd so\nif you look at that graph in front of you,\n\n37\n00:02:14.232 --> 00:02:17.882\nover time we become more mature as\nwe move towards business alignment.\n\n38\n00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:21.604\nNow one thing that I will say, and\nin that CSI approach, you see,\n\n39\n00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:26.090\nwe started off with our vision, and then\nwe worked out where we were right now.\n\n40\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.980\nThat's our baseline.\n\n41\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.650\nAnd you see that as\na chalk under that wheel.\n\n42\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.390\nOkay and then in our CSI approach,\n\n43\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.620\nwhich is a lot more detailed than\nthe Deming cycle in front of you now.\n\n44\n00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.814\nThen what we will actually do is we\nwill make our detailed planning.\n\n45\n00:02:43.814 --> 00:02:47.915\nAnd then we will work out whether\nwe actually achieved it or\n\n46\n00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:49.990\nnot in our CSI approach.\n\n47\n00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.720\nAnd this is what happens, so we do it in\nthe Deming cycle, without detail plan or\n\n48\n00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.190\ndetail approach and we do.\n\n49\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.400\nAnd then we check.\n\n50\n00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.170\nAnd remember we check\nthat in the CSI approach.\n\n51\n00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.510\nDId we get that?\n\n52\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.688\nBut then what we do is we\ntake another baseline.\n\n53\n00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:08.410\nIn other words, under that wheel\nthat you've got in front of you.\n\n54\n00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.158\nWe put another chalk under that wheel,\nand so\n\n55\n00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:14.860\nover a period of time if you look\non the screen in front of you.\n\n56\n00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.640\nYou will see, that as that wheel has\nmoved upwards toward business alignment\n\n57\n00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.230\nwith each evolution of that wheel\nas it moves, it moves upwards.\n\n58\n00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.278\nAnd so the next time it's going to be\nhere, a lot closer to business alignment,\n\n59\n00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:36.628\nand we put a chuck under\nthe wheel to stop it rolling back.\n\n60\n00:03:36.628 --> 00:03:41.343\nAnd that's key across absolutely every\nsingle improvement initiative we\n\n61\n00:03:41.343 --> 00:03:42.395\nhave to embed.\n\n62\n00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:47.271\nAnd it is mentioned in our CSI approach,\nwhich is an approach for\n\n63\n00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:51.935\nperforming CSI improvement initiatives.\n\n64\n00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:55.025\nIt's also mentioned in our seven\nstep improvement processes,\n\n65\n00:03:55.025 --> 00:04:00.665\nwhich we're gonna get into in a lot\nmore detail in a later session.\n\n66\n00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:04.405\nBut the seven step improvement\nprocess also mentions\n\n67\n00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:06.960\na varying change to be embedded in.\n\n68\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.474\nNow, baselines are mentioned\nin a previous section.\n\n69\n00:04:09.474 --> 00:04:12.212\nI mentioned when we looked\nat the objectives and\n\n70\n00:04:12.212 --> 00:04:13.930\nwe looked at the scope of CSI.\n\n71\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.470\nAnd a baseline is just a snapshot\nof where we are now just to use as\n\n72\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.400\na starting point for later comparison.\n\n73\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.760\nSo, I want to look a little\nbit more at metrics, and\n\n74\n00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.210\nthis is something that you would have\ncovered during your foundation class.\n\n75\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.874\nIt's not something that we covered\nduring the foundation recap.\n\n76\n00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:37.816\nSo I want to just reiterate this because\nI'm sure it may have been a while since\n\n77\n00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:39.424\nyour foundation class.\n\n78\n00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:42.750\nAnd memories fade, or\nat least mine does anyway.\n\n79\n00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.770\nAnd there are four main\nreasons why we measure okay.\n\n80\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.542\nWe measure to validate.\n\n81\n00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:52.382\nTo validate that we're going\nin the right direction.\n\n82\n00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:56.284\nAnd then we measure to justify, and\nI call that one the see, I told you so\n\n83\n00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:57.600\nmeasurement, right?\n\n84\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.900\nSee I told you we needed more stuff.\n\n85\n00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.814\nSee I told you we needed more money.\n\n86\n00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:05.764\nOkay, so we measure to validate that\nwe're going in the right direction and\n\n87\n00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.850\nwe measure to justify.\n\n88\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.476\nWe also measure to direct and\nto intervene.\n\n89\n00:05:11.476 --> 00:05:15.398\nThink about our SLAM charts, our service\nlevel agreement monitoring charts,\n\n90\n00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:19.280\nor red, amber, green if you want to\ncall them that, your RAG charts.\n\n91\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.186\nWhen they're amber or orange or yellow,\n\n92\n00:05:22.186 --> 00:05:28.092\ndepending on what shade of the rainbow\nyou're using, well, that's a direction.\n\n93\n00:05:28.092 --> 00:05:31.770\nIn other words,\nthat particular area needs some focus.\n\n94\n00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.944\nIt needs some improvement.\n\n95\n00:05:32.944 --> 00:05:35.680\nWe've gotta make sure that\nwe don't breach a target.\n\n96\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.920\nBut when it's red, that's an intervention.\n\n97\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.350\nWe gotta do something about that, okay.\n\n98\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.840\nSo we measure for four reasons.\n\n99\n00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.980\nWe measure to validate that we're\ngoing in the right direction.\n\n100\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.230\nWe measure to justify\nthat's the I told you so.\n\n101\n00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.412\nThen we measure to direct, and we measure\nto intervene, and we should always think,\n\n102\n00:05:52.412 --> 00:05:56.552\nwhen we're defining any metrics, and of\ncourse we define these in service design.\n\n103\n00:05:56.552 --> 00:05:59.457\nBut CSI is a part of that definition, and\n\n104\n00:05:59.457 --> 00:06:04.680\nCSI is a part of the review of all of\nour monitoring and reporting as well.\n\n105\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.994\nSo think about why are you measuring it,\nis it going to allow you to make\n\n106\n00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:16.872\na informed decision, and how long do you\nneed to take those measurements for.\n\n107\n00:06:16.872 --> 00:06:21.220\nAnd all of those should be part of\nyour decision making process when you\n\n108\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.770\ndecide what metrics to take and\nwhat reports to see okay.\n\n109\n00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.689\nAnd again knowledge management has\nan input into this, because knowledge\n\n110\n00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:32.000\nmanagement is responsible for\nthe ownership of that data too.\n\n111\n00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.300\nSo another principle then, with CSI,\n\n112\n00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.728\nsomething that we have to\nhave with CSI is governance.\n\n113\n00:06:40.728 --> 00:06:43.349\nAnd in ITIL the governance is about\neffective decision making to manage\n\n114\n00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:43.969\nyour business.\n\n115\n00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:52.536\nIn ITIL we look at governance as control\nbut with fairness and transparency.\n\n116\n00:06:52.536 --> 00:06:57.907\nThis is not about having that\ncontrol at this level without\n\n117\n00:06:57.907 --> 00:07:03.240\nany transparency or\nwithout any visible fairness.\n\n118\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.180\nThere has to be a reason why\nwe make every single decision.\n\n119\n00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.560\nAnd that's exactly what we're saying.\n\n120\n00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.572\nAnd that reason should\nbe visible to everyone.\n\n121\n00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:14.406\nIf you're in an IT environment and\n\n122\n00:07:14.406 --> 00:07:18.522\nyou have to ask the question,\nwhy am I doing this?\n\n123\n00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:20.218\nWell for a start,\nyou're not gonna give 100%.\n\n124\n00:07:20.218 --> 00:07:22.751\nBecause if you don't believe in something,\nand\n\n125\n00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:26.360\nwe look to this in a previous section\nwhen we looked at codozay steps.\n\n126\n00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.650\nIf you don't believe in doing\nsomething than you're not gonna do it.\n\n127\n00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.866\nYou're certainly not\ngonna give it your all.\n\n128\n00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:36.770\nSo, we want to make sure that we have that\ntransparency that everybody knows why.\n\n129\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.808\nThat we don't have to ask that question.\n\n130\n00:07:38.808 --> 00:07:41.749\nWe already know the answer\nto that question.\n\n131\n00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:43.190\nAnd it's about fairness too.\n\n132\n00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.910\nAnd again, that's back to\nthe reason of why are doing this.\n\n133\n00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.392\nAnd because I feel like it\nis not really an answer.\n\n134\n00:07:50.392 --> 00:07:54.709\nSo IT governance is the responsibility\nof the board of directors, and\n\n135\n00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:57.630\nalso the steering group etc as well.\n\n136\n00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.210\nAnd we've got enterprise governance\nthat controls just well everything.\n\n137\n00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.780\nIn other words the corporate\ngovernance and the business governance.\n\n138\n00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.743\nAnd then we'll take a look if\nwe look on our next slide and\n\n139\n00:08:08.743 --> 00:08:10.648\nit explains it a little bit better.\n\n140\n00:08:10.648 --> 00:08:14.148\nUnder that enterprise which is\nthe corporation as a whole,\n\n141\n00:08:14.148 --> 00:08:18.628\nwe look at what we call, corporate\ngovernance, which is conformance, and\n\n142\n00:08:18.628 --> 00:08:21.870\nbusiness governance which is performance.\n\n143\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.554\nAnd what does that mean really?\n\n144\n00:08:23.554 --> 00:08:28.612\nWell corporate governance is all\nabout conforming to our ethics,\n\n145\n00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:31.500\nconforming to our way of working.\n\n146\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.118\nSo we use words like accountability and\nassurance in this.\n\n147\n00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:41.732\nWhereas, business governance is all about\ndelivering that return on that investment.\n\n148\n00:08:41.732 --> 00:08:46.370\nIt's about value creation,\nin other words, performance.\n\n149\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.901\nBecause you see,\nwe can deliver performance but\n\n150\n00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:54.998\nnot necessarily do it in an ethical way,\nor not do it in organized way.\n\n151\n00:08:54.998 --> 00:08:58.272\nWhich means that we've got\nbusiness governance started out,\n\n152\n00:08:58.272 --> 00:09:01.370\nit's working great but\nthe corporate governance isn't.\n\n153\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.969\nBut we can be as organized as we like, so\nwe can achieve corporate governance, but\n\n154\n00:09:06.969 --> 00:09:13.330\nwe don't deliver in which case then we're\nnot achieving business governance, okay?\n\n155\n00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.885\nSo we need to have both, and\nin the same way that in foundation\n\n156\n00:09:16.885 --> 00:09:21.580\nwe looked at the utility and warranty of\nthe service it's pretty much the same.\n\n157\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.772\nGovernance is splitting to those two\nfactors because we have to have both.\n\n158\n00:09:26.772 --> 00:09:32.118\nWe have to be organized and We have to be\nable to deliver that performance within\n\n159\n00:09:32.118 --> 00:09:37.140\nthe organization, otherwise\nthe organization is simply going to fail.\n\n160\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.112\nWe've got a lot of tool at\nour disposal to help us.\n\n161\n00:09:41.112 --> 00:09:47.020\nAnd ITIL is a framework, and\nit's a framework for managing IT services.\n\n162\n00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.824\nIt's a framework for delivering value,\nthat's what ITIL is.\n\n163\n00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:55.824\nNow I have mentioned in\na previous section that ITIL\n\n164\n00:09:55.824 --> 00:10:01.560\nis like a skeleton,\nI think was the analogy that I used.\n\n165\n00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.960\nWe're gonna give you a set of bones.\n\n166\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.090\nAnd we're gonna tell you that you need\nto have these bones in place, okay.\n\n167\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.030\nIn order to have a person,\n\n168\n00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.960\na real live living creature\nyou need to have a skeleton.\n\n169\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.630\nOkay, well that's great.\n\n170\n00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.630\nBut it's up to you to meet to those bones.\n\n171\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.676\nIt's up to you to decide whether\nyou want it to have 1 eye or\n\n172\n00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:24.816\n15 eyes or walk on 4 legs or\nwalk on 2 legs with or 2 arms.\n\n173\n00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:26.860\nThat's entirely up to you.\n\n174\n00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.908\nWe'll just tell you that you\nneed these bones in place.\n\n175\n00:10:28.908 --> 00:10:33.706\nAn ITIL will tell you, you really do need\nthese processes, in place in order to\n\n176\n00:10:33.706 --> 00:10:38.330\nhave efficient and effective services and\ndeliver value to the business.\n\n177\n00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.840\nBut what those processes look like,\n\n178\n00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.920\nwell that's entirely up to you,\nwe can't tell you that.\n\n179\n00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.480\nIt's not a one size fits all approach.\n\n180\n00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.420\nSo ITIL is a framework and\nit gives you guidance on the structure.\n\n181\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.290\nWe've also got COBIT,\nwhich is a framework for,\n\n182\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:59.990\nit came out of the financial sector and\nis a framework for governance.\n\n183\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.720\nIt's a framework for strategy and\nit's an audit framework.\n\n184\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.030\nAnd as I say, it's geared very\nmuch towards the financial sector.\n\n185\n00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.750\nIt certainly came out of\nthe financial sector.\n\n186\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.256\nAnd so that will,\nif we were to put the two together,\n\n187\n00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.940\nCOBIT will tell you what you\nwant to achieve within IT.\n\n188\n00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.340\nIn other words,\nthe strategy and the audit.\n\n189\n00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.972\nWhereas ITIL will tell you\nhow to achieve it, okay.\n\n190\n00:11:24.972 --> 00:11:28.190\nAnd then we've got project management,\nokay.\n\n191\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.620\nAnd so in this particular example,\nyou've got PMBOK.\n\n192\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.870\nWe also have Prints 2 and PMI, PMP.\n\n193\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.094\nWhich are framework examples for\nproject management.\n\n194\n00:11:40.094 --> 00:11:43.135\nUltimately, what we're trying to achieve,\nis efficiency and\n\n195\n00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:45.720\neffectiveness in everything that we do.\n\n196\n00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.284\nWhether it be in projects or\nwhether it be in our service management.\n\n197\n00:11:50.284 --> 00:11:53.040\nAnd so what we want to have\nis a consistent approach.\n\n198\n00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.428\nAnd so we use frameworks to help us\nachieve that consistency approach.\n\n199\n00:11:58.428 --> 00:12:02.250\nFrameworks will not\ngive us the magic cure.\n\n200\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.720\nThey're not going to do it for us.\n\n201\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.892\nWe've still got to put in the work.\n\n202\n00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:10.063\nWe've still got define how\nit's going to look for us, but\n\n203\n00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.800\nframeworks will help us to get there.\n\n204\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.130\nThey'll give us that consistency.\n\n205\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.040\nAnd then we have models.\n\n206\n00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.792\nAnd a model is a predefined set of steps.\n\n207\n00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:25.460\nAnd here we have the CMMI model,\nthe Capability Maturity Model.\n\n208\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.397\nNow, the Capability Maturity model\nis something that we would use for\n\n209\n00:12:29.397 --> 00:12:30.540\nprocess maturity.\n\n210\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.960\nAnd actually I find CMMI\nan invaluable tool when it comes\n\n211\n00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.830\nto measuring the maturity\nof our ITIL processes.\n\n212\n00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:46.043\nBecause CMMI gives us a model that\nwas build on a scale from 0 to 5 and\n\n213\n00:12:46.043 --> 00:12:50.076\nwe grade our processes\nbased on that scale.\n\n214\n00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:55.688\nWhether it be zero, which is completely ad\nhoc processes with no real definition and\n\n215\n00:12:55.688 --> 00:12:58.296\ndocumentation right away through to 5\n\n216\n00:12:58.296 --> 00:13:03.119\nwhich actually have well developed\nprocesses, with documentation and\n\n217\n00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:07.170\nthat are subject to CSI-\ncontinuous service improvement.\n\n218\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.720\nCMMI has generally been accepted as\nthe standard now for measuring maturity.\n\n219\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.362\nAnd I certainly find it incredibly\nhelpful when I'm doing assessments and\n\n220\n00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:23.310\nwhen I'm doing audits at organizations for\neither ISO 20000 or for ITIL.\n\n221\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:28.147\nThen I find CMMI really,\nreally useful to give organizations\n\n222\n00:13:28.147 --> 00:13:32.640\na view of exactly what level\ntheir processes are at.\n\n223\n00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.642\nSometimes an organization may think that\ntheir process is very well developed.\n\n224\n00:13:37.642 --> 00:13:42.748\nAnd I spot something that really takes it\ndown a couple of points in the CMMI scale,\n\n225\n00:13:42.748 --> 00:13:46.818\nbut sometimes actually processes,\nand actually a lot of times,\n\n226\n00:13:46.818 --> 00:13:49.783\nyou find that processes\nare doing a lot better.\n\n227\n00:13:49.783 --> 00:13:54.775\nA lot more mature than what\norganization will give them credit for.\n\n228\n00:13:54.775 --> 00:13:57.655\nBut we've gotta have that consistency.\n\n229\n00:13:57.655 --> 00:14:01.995\nAnd that again comes out in CMMI\nthis is about a consistent approach.\n\n230\n00:14:01.995 --> 00:14:07.600\nAnd so we have to have a consistent\nachievement of that score within CMMI.\n\n231\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.530\nAnd then we have, lastly,\nthe standards, and\n\n232\n00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:17.150\nan international standard is\nsomething that you achieve.\n\n233\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:22.482\nSo let's look at ISO/IEC 20000 which\nis the international standard for\n\n234\n00:14:22.482 --> 00:14:24.025\nservice management.\n\n235\n00:14:24.025 --> 00:14:29.346\nAnd what will happen is an ISO\n20000 order will come along and\n\n236\n00:14:29.346 --> 00:14:32.505\nwill assess your organization.\n\n237\n00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:37.765\nFor efficiency and effectiveness\nwithin service management processes.\n\n238\n00:14:37.765 --> 00:14:41.899\nThey will check that all of your\nservice management processes\n\n239\n00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:46.747\nare consistently managed, that they\nhave CSI in place and that they have\n\n240\n00:14:46.747 --> 00:14:51.690\nthe relationships between the processes\ncuz they are really important.\n\n241\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:56.030\nBecause we can't work in silos not in\nITIL, it just simply doesn't work.\n\n242\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.679\nAnd even in the last two sections ,we have\nlooked at the interactions between CSI and\n\n243\n00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:02.000\nquite a few processes.\n\n244\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.084\nAnd, without those interactions those\nprocesses would not be efficient or\n\n245\n00:15:07.084 --> 00:15:07.964\neffective.\n\n246\n00:15:07.964 --> 00:15:14.103\nSo I saw ISO/20000 won't tell you whether\nyou've implemented ITIL, ISO/20000 will\n\n247\n00:15:14.103 --> 00:15:19.450\ntell you whether your processes actually\nmeet the requirements of the organization.\n\n248\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.227\nAnd whether your processes\nare efficient and effective,\n\n249\n00:15:23.227 --> 00:15:25.617\nwhether they have relationships and\n\n250\n00:15:25.617 --> 00:15:30.794\nwhether they actually deliver the defined\noutput and have defined inputs too.\n\n251\n00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:37.340\nOkay, ITIL will help\nyou achieve ISO 20000.\n\n252\n00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.312\nBut just because you turn round and\nyou say as an organization that hey look,\n\n253\n00:15:42.312 --> 00:15:47.049\nI've got an ITIL framework in place,\ndoes not mean that you're going to\n\n254\n00:15:47.049 --> 00:15:51.104\nobtain ISO/20000 accreditation very,\nvery easily.\n\n255\n00:15:51.104 --> 00:15:54.056\nAnd what we have to do Is\nwe have to come in and\n\n256\n00:15:54.056 --> 00:15:59.304\nwe have to audit your processes to make\nsure that they will meet the standards\n\n257\n00:15:59.304 --> 00:16:04.670\nthat are required bu\nthe International Standards Organization.\n\n258\n00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.360\nNow every three years you're subject to an\naudit with an international standard and\n\n259\n00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.930\nthen every year,\nyou'll have an interim assessment,\n\n260\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:16.225\njust a small so, a very short assessment.\n\n261\n00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:20.995\nWell, we'll give you a little pointer or\ntwo just to say, hey, this one's slipping,\n\n262\n00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:24.025\nthis one needs some work,\nor this one's doing really,\n\n263\n00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:26.039\nreally great in terms of processes.\n\n264\n00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:29.187\nThen every three years\nyou'll be fully audited and\n\n265\n00:16:29.187 --> 00:16:33.882\nyou will receive a certificate, and\nyou will receive that accreditation.\n\n266\n00:16:33.882 --> 00:16:39.000\nAnd they're exactly the same is true for\nISO 270002 which\n\n267\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.836\nis the international standard for\ninformation security and\n\n268\n00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:48.862\nISO 17799 for security management and\nwe've got process\n\n269\n00:16:48.862 --> 00:16:54.288\nimprovement there as well and\nalso software asset management too.\n\n270\n00:16:54.288 --> 00:16:56.580\nAnd there are lots and\nlots of other standards.\n\n271\n00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.450\nWe have standards for\nquality management access,\n\n272\n00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.650\nstandards for service continuity as well.\n\n273\n00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:04.950\nSo there are a lot of standards.\n\n274\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.075\nNow ITIL will help you\nachieve those standards, but\n\n275\n00:17:08.075 --> 00:17:12.830\nITIL is not going to guarantee\nan achievement of those standards.\n\n276\n00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:19.800\nOkay, so in terms of CSI principles,\nwell we have\n\n277\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.960\nfinished to look at CSI principles and\nwhat we would really like you to do now.\n\n278\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:29.216\nIs go to your course exercises, and your\ncourse materials, and you'll find some\n\n279\n00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:34.338\nexercises there that will help you\nunderstand these principles in more depth.\n\n280\n00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:38.146\nYou'll find a case study,\nsomething to base your exercises on,\n\n281\n00:17:38.146 --> 00:17:42.260\nand you'll find some exercises and\nsome very simple questions.\n\n282\n00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.293\nThat will either look over\nyour foundation material and\n\n283\n00:17:45.293 --> 00:17:49.048\nensure that you understand\nthe integration between the processes.\n\n284\n00:17:49.048 --> 00:17:51.316\nAnd and\nI know that in the previous section,\n\n285\n00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:54.640\nI have asked you to understand\nthe objectives of the processes.\n\n286\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.970\nThese questions will ensure\nthat you do understand that\n\n287\n00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.090\nbefore we move onto our next section.\n\n288\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:05.671\nAs always, we are available in the forum\nif you do have ny questions, and so\n\n289\n00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:09.630\nfeel free to contact us, and\nwe'll see you in the next section.\n\n290\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.535\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well,\nthank you again for\n\n291\n00:18:12.535 --> 00:18:16.910\nhelping us to round out our CSI\nprinciples here in this part two.\n\n292\n00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.780\nRemember that we did take\na look at the ways that\n\n293\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.110\nwe can have the improvement\nusing that demming step process.\n\n294\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.730\nWhat do we call it?\n\n295\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.200\nDemming cycle?\n\n296\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.848\n&gt;&gt; Cycle.\n\n297\n00:18:26.848 --> 00:18:30.508\n&gt;&gt; Cycle, using the demming cycle as well,\nand taking a look, of course,\n\n298\n00:18:30.508 --> 00:18:33.448\nas using frameworks, of course,\nthat help us to do this.\n\n299\n00:18:33.448 --> 00:18:35.538\nAs well as achieving\nsome of those standards,\n\n300\n00:18:35.538 --> 00:18:38.960\nall these are good practices and\ngood things that we should review.\n\n301\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.725\nMake sure those concepts are really\nengrained in you before you get ready for\n\n302\n00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:47.312\nthe exam and then,\nof course further on, ITIL studies.\n\n303\n00:18:47.312 --> 00:18:50.630\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode, then.\n\n304\n00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.147\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n\n305\n00:18:54.147 --> 00:18:55.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

00:00:08.288\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:12.410\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.910\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.040\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.590\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n8\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.530\ntoday we'll be taking a look at\nthe Seven Step Improvement Process.\n\n9\n00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.550\nHere with us live from Downtown Abbey\nis the aristocrat Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.170\nJoe, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.070\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.010\nPleased to be here.\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.210\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n14\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.813\nNow, Jo we were joking about Downtown\nAbbey a little bit before the show just\n\n15\n00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:40.720\nbriefly.\n\n16\n00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.330\nSo here we are, what we're talking now in\nthe CSI phase of what we're doing, and\n\n17\n00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.950\nwe're talking about\nthe Seven Step Improvement.\n\n18\n00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.330\nNow Jo, does it really take seven steps\nto do this continual service improvement?\n\n19\n00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes it does.\n\n20\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n21\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.783\n&gt;&gt; If you don't what\nyou're going to improve.\n\n22\n00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:03.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well that sounds good.\n\n23\n00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.700\n&gt;&gt; Quite often we\nare presented with a problem.\n\n24\n00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.970\nAnd we just don't know\nwhat the problem is.\n\n25\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.030\nWe don't understand how we're\ngonna make life better.\n\n26\n00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.300\nAnd this is where the Seven Step\nImprovement Process really comes in.\n\n27\n00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.580\nSo that's what we're going\nto be looking at right now.\n\n28\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.590\nIf we look at just the purpose of\nthe Seven Step Improvement Process you'll\n\n29\n00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.030\nsee that the first step in this\nprocess is actually to define.\n\n30\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.030\nAnd that's the key to the Seven Step\nImprovement Process is really just\n\n31\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.180\nunderstanding that sometimes\nwe know we need to improve but\n\n32\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.180\nwe don't know exactly what\nwe need to improve on.\n\n33\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.150\nSo the purpose really is just to define\nand then manage the steps that are needed\n\n34\n00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.940\nto identify and define and\ngather and process, et cetera.\n\n35\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.440\nAnd then implement improvements.\n\n36\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.061\nSo we use the Seven Step Improvement\nProcess a lot within CSI because we're\n\n37\n00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:59.384\nquite often in a position where we\nknow we need to do things better, but\n\n38\n00:01:59.384 --> 00:02:01.535\nwe just don't know exactly what.\n\n39\n00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:04.180\nLet me give you an example.\n\n40\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.070\nLet's just say we've got a service desk.\n\n41\n00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.620\nAnd we know that customer satisfaction\nis low on the service desk, but\n\n42\n00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.620\nwe're not too sure why.\n\n43\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.250\nAnd that's where we are.\n\n44\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.740\nAnd this is quiet often how our\nimprovements are generated.\n\n45\n00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.200\nThis is where we get the ideas for\n\n46\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.710\nimprovements from is that we know we\nreally have, it's not a technical problem,\n\n47\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.480\nbut we know that we've got\nan issue that we need to resolve.\n\n48\n00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.580\nAnd so the first thing that we need\nto do is we need to workout, well,\n\n49\n00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.389\nokay, what's wrong?\n\n50\n00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.960\nAnd this is where we define and\nthen we go out and\n\n51\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.020\ngather information that\nwill tell us what's wrong.\n\n52\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.620\nSo that first objective\nthat you see on that screen\n\n53\n00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.840\nthere is about identifying\nopportunities for improvement.\n\n54\n00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.190\nThat's exactly what the CSI Seven\nStep Improvement Process will do,\n\n55\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.020\nwill help us identify opportunities for\nimprovement.\n\n56\n00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.130\nNow, hopefully, if we take a look at the\nrest of the objectives that are up on your\n\n57\n00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.700\nscreen there, you'll notice that other\nobjectives include reducing cost,\n\n58\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.400\nreviewing service achievement.\n\n59\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.780\nBut really, look at the bottom\none under the objectives,\n\n60\n00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.850\nunderstanding what we need to measure and\nwhy we need to measure it.\n\n61\n00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.060\nIn other words, again making\nsure that when we take a metric,\n\n62\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.280\nwhen we take any measurement,\n\n63\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.120\nwe're doing it for a reason because\nwe want to make an informed decision.\n\n64\n00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.290\nIn a previous session, we looked at\nthe knowledge management scale, the data,\n\n65\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.300\ninformation, knowledge and wisdom, and the\nfact that we will only take reports, and\n\n66\n00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.620\nwe only will analyze data if we\nwant to make an informed decision.\n\n67\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.745\nAnd here we go it's, linked into CSI,\n\n68\n00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:43.225\nit's all about making informed decisions\nand about making improvements.\n\n69\n00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:47.005\nAnd of course when we mean improvements we\nmean aligning ourselves to the needs of\n\n70\n00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:50.065\nthe organization,\nof the business, not just of IT.\n\n71\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.860\nAnd so the scope there, when you look at\nthat second bullet point in the scope\n\n72\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.848\nit talks about aligning ourselves\nwith the business needs.\n\n73\n00:03:58.848 --> 00:04:03.190\nIt means that we have to be organized in\norder to meet the needs of the business\n\n74\n00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.820\nand that we have to deliver the services,\nand the processes, and\n\n75\n00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.580\nall of the technologies, et cetera,\nthat will deliver value to the business.\n\n76\n00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.500\nLet's remember that\na service defined in ITIL\n\n77\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.410\nis a means of delivering value\nby facilitating outcomes.\n\n78\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.340\nSo we want to facilitate\ntheir business outcomes.\n\n79\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.820\nWe want to deliver value to them and\nvalue, of course, is perceived.\n\n80\n00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.080\nSo quite often we will be faced with\na dilemma, such as I mentioned Ronnie,\n\n81\n00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.660\nabout the fact that the service\ndesk just isn't performing and\n\n82\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.450\nwe don't know what to do about it.\n\n83\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.812\nAnd this is where the Seven Step\nImprovement Process really comes\n\n84\n00:04:43.812 --> 00:04:44.980\ninto play.\n\n85\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.910\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, that actually\nseems logical a lot of times.\n\n86\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.610\nMost people realize that there is an issue\nbut they don't know what to fix and\n\n87\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.620\nwe have a saying around here\nwhich is kind of a neat thing\n\n88\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.220\nthat says there's a lot of\ntimes when we're facing issue.\n\n89\n00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.000\nWe just don't know what we don't know yet.\n\n90\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.480\nAnd so these Seven Step Improvement\nProcess at least from listening so\n\n91\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.610\nfar seems to indicate that we can\nactually be able to figure out.\n\n92\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.170\nWhat we don't know which is the idea\nof what's actually gone wrong with that\n\n93\n00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.240\nservice desk and\n\n94\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.870\nthen begin the improvement process\nto help get us back on track.\n\n95\n00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.500\nSo Jo, where are we gonna begin?\n\n96\n00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the first thing that we're\ngoing to look at is the policies and\n\n97\n00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.110\nthe principles, context, et cetera of\nthe Seven Step Improvement Process.\n\n98\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.810\nNow, I've already mentioned the word\nvalue, and we have to make sure that\n\n99\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.540\neverything that we do is to\ndrive value to the organization.\n\n100\n00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.090\nIt's to create value.\n\n101\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.010\nI have mentioned previously, and\nI'm going to mention it again right now.\n\n102\n00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.927\nIf our organization is not happy with us,\nas an IT service provider, as an IT team,\n\n103\n00:05:45.927 --> 00:05:49.443\nthen they're gonna want to do\nsomething about it because of\n\n104\n00:05:49.443 --> 00:05:53.450\ncourse the business give us a budget,\nthe business give us money and\n\n105\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.598\nthey want to see results from that and\nif they're not seeing results,\n\n106\n00:05:57.598 --> 00:06:02.168\nthen they're not going to be happy and\nthey're going to be looking for ways to\n\n107\n00:06:02.168 --> 00:06:06.946\nsee those results and to actually perceive\nvalue from their service provider.\n\n108\n00:06:06.946 --> 00:06:10.205\nNow that might mean going to\nanother service provider or\n\n109\n00:06:10.205 --> 00:06:15.260\nthat might mean working with us in order\nto ensure that we deliver the value.\n\n110\n00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.880\nSo take a look then at the policies within\nthe Seven Step Improvement Process.\n\n111\n00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.480\nRemember we have been faced with\na challenge and we need to improve.\n\n112\n00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.730\nAnd look at the policies,\nwe talk here about consistency right\n\n113\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.020\nthe way through these principles and\nthese policies.\n\n114\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.140\nIt's about consistent methods for data\ngathering, about consistent methods for\n\n115\n00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.140\ntraining, consistency for\ninternal reviews you know.\n\n116\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.269\nEverything is about consistency.\n\n117\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.740\nThere's a question here\non the right-hand side.\n\n118\n00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.770\nAnd I just wanna ask you really why do\nyou think that we need consistency?\n\n119\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Consistency gives us\nbases to ensure that we hit\n\n120\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.810\nall the enter the steps that\nwe need to to fix things but\n\n121\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.720\noverall it really is about\neffectiveness and efficiency, right?\n\n122\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly you hit the nail\nright on the head.\n\n123\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.120\nThe two tenets of IT are about\ndelivering value in an effective way,\n\n124\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.890\nso what they perceive as value\nnot what we perceive as value.\n\n125\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.830\nIt's about meeting that objective\neffectively but in an efficient manner.\n\n126\n00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.801\nAnd of course with ITIL we're\ntalking about efficiency as\n\n127\n00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:22.721\nbeing minimal waste in terms of time,\nin terms of money.\n\n128\n00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:25.124\nAnd also in terms of skills, okay.\n\n129\n00:07:25.124 --> 00:07:28.900\nSo with consistency you've got efficiency.\n\n130\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.710\nThe other thing you have with consistency\nof course, is the managed expectations of\n\n131\n00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.920\nwhat to, not only what to obtain,\nbut also how to work as well.\n\n132\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.300\nAnd that is really key.\n\n133\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.920\nSo when we talk about consistency\neverybody knows what to expect.\n\n134\n00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.055\nEverybody knows what\nthe procedure looks like.\n\n135\n00:07:48.055 --> 00:07:49.657\nWhatever our process may be,\n\n136\n00:07:49.657 --> 00:07:53.640\nif it's performed in a consistent\nmanner we know how to follow a process.\n\n137\n00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.838\nIf we see an output,\nin other words we see a report,\n\n138\n00:07:57.838 --> 00:08:02.722\nif all of our reports re delivered\nin a consistent manner and\n\n139\n00:08:02.722 --> 00:08:08.000\nor to a consistent style,\nthen we know what we're seeing.\n\n140\n00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.020\nThere's less analysis involved and\nwith less analysis,\n\n141\n00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.880\nthat means efficiency, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.440\nSo you know what to expect and\nI used the word obtain, but really\n\n143\n00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.730\nthis is all about managing expectations\nand it's about managing the output.\n\n144\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:28.470\nIt's about managing what we are going to\nachieve when we undertake any process,\n\n145\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.850\nwhat we're going to achieve\n\n146\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.480\nwhen we deliver a service by way of\ndelivering value to the business.\n\n147\n00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.260\nSo this is why we need\nto have consistency.\n\n148\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.640\nThe other thing about consistency is,\nof course,\n\n149\n00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.410\nthen we can manage our skill set too.\n\n150\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.990\nBecause if we're delivering\nthings in a consistent manner and\n\n151\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.490\nif we are following consistent processes,\nthen that makes training a lot easier as\n\n152\n00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.940\nwell because we're training\npeople in exactly the same way.\n\n153\n00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:00.000\nWe're training people with an expectation\nof what we want them to achieve.\n\n154\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.490\nSo of course again we've\ngot that efficiency there.\n\n155\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.370\nSo this is why we have consistency.\n\n156\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.650\nNow, one of the other things that\nI want to bring to mind here is on\n\n157\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.640\nthe second half or the last third\nrather of this particular slide.\n\n158\n00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.280\nWe look at change management\n\n159\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.270\nto actually implement all of\nour improvement initiatives.\n\n160\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.910\nWhen we're going to service transition,\n\n161\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.330\nyou'll see the process\nof change management.\n\n162\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:33.320\nAnd change management is all about\nensuring that changes are recorded and\n\n163\n00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.850\nevaluated and prioritized and\nin a controlled manner.\n\n164\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.810\nNow a lot of people associate\nchange management with bureaucracy.\n\n165\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.030\nMy goodness no, I don't wanna follow\na change process because there's\n\n166\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.770\ntoo much bureaucracy involved.\n\n167\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.220\nRight let's squash that right now, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.590\nIt's a common misconception with ITIL\nin that we're bringing in bureaucracy,\n\n169\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.970\nbecause we're gonna give\nyou a list of processes and\n\n170\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.650\nwe're gonna say you have to follow these.\n\n171\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.560\nWell you don't, because what we're doing\nis we're bringing in that consistency and\n\n172\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.450\nthe efficiency.\n\n173\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.560\nAnd what we're saying to you is,\nyou need to have a change process but\n\n174\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.090\nwhat that change process looks\nlike is completely up to you.\n\n175\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:21.380\nAnd every single organization will have\na completely different change process\n\n176\n00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.950\ndesigned to achieve the same ends, but\n\n177\n00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.760\nthe process itself will\nbe completely different.\n\n178\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.520\nAnd then don't forget\nthe concept of models,\n\n179\n00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.510\npretty fine sets of steps that we use for\nevery single process.\n\n180\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.480\nSo the fact is, that if we were to\ntake a normal change process, and\n\n181\n00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.710\nthe normal change process could, by the\ntime it goes to the change advisory board,\n\n182\n00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:47.350\netc., or maybe it goes through change\nevaluation, and maybe it has to go through\n\n183\n00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.280\nrelease and deployment, and\nservice validation and testing, etc.\n\n184\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.450\nThat change process could take six months.\n\n185\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.000\nBut with the right model in place, and\n\n186\n00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.080\nthe right model has been defined for\nconsistency and for efficiency and\n\n187\n00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.550\neffectiveness, then that change\nprocess could take ten minutes.\n\n188\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.570\nAnd that's the thing.\n\n189\n00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.585\nYou've got to have efficiency and\n\n190\n00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:12.665\neffectiveness, change management\nis not about adding a bureaucracy.\n\n191\n00:11:12.665 --> 00:11:15.415\nChange management is\nabout being efficient and\n\n192\n00:11:15.415 --> 00:11:20.025\ndelivering change in a consistent\nmanner so that we manage expectations.\n\n193\n00:11:20.025 --> 00:11:23.785\nSo what change management is gonna\ndo in this particular instance\n\n194\n00:11:23.785 --> 00:11:28.160\nis just going to add in that consistency.\n\n195\n00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:35.340\nIt's going to add in the overseer\nto enable us to deliver a standard.\n\n196\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.790\nEnable us to deliver things in\na way that will be expected and\n\n197\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.510\nthat people will expect to see an output.\n\n198\n00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.840\nI will challenge any organization to\n\n199\n00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.160\ndeliver changed management in\nan efficient and an effective way.\n\n200\n00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.910\nIf anybody were to say to me that their\nchanged management processes is too\n\n201\n00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.510\nbureaucratic, then I would turn around and\n\n202\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.690\nsay to them,\nyou've implemented it incorrectly.\n\n203\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.630\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n204\n00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.870\nIf change brings in bureaucracy\nthen change has been implemented\n\n205\n00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.880\nin an incorrect way.\n\n206\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.930\nCertainly not the way that we intended\nwhen we originally compiled and\n\n207\n00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.030\ndelivered ITL Service Management\nframework.\n\n208\n00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.210\nWe deliver a framework for\nservice management.\n\n209\n00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:23.710\nWe don't deliver A set of\nprocedures that you must follow.\n\n210\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.880\nOkay, ITIL's another one size fits all\napproach, and you can never plug and\n\n211\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.010\nplay ITIL, okay.\n\n212\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.160\nYou can never just take\nprocess out of the book and\n\n213\n00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.120\nsay hey look this is process\nwe're going to follow.\n\n214\n00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.380\nAnd this is a problem that we have\nwith change management sometimes,\n\n215\n00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.840\nis that organizations\nhave tried to do that.\n\n216\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.210\nSo, yes we're going to use\nchange management to control\n\n217\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.085\nthe way that we deliver improvements.\n\n218\n00:12:46.085 --> 00:12:49.040\nCuz all improvements\nare changes to our environment.\n\n219\n00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.030\nBut it should be done in a way that\ndoesn't increase the bureaucracy,\n\n220\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.780\nbut actually increases the consistency,\nand gives us better control, but\n\n221\n00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.180\ngives us better visibility of our changes\nand our improvement initiatives as well.\n\n222\n00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.560\nSomething else that we mention\nhere in our policies to do with\n\n223\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.290\ncontinual service improvement is about\nresponsibilities to be clearly defined.\n\n224\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.200\nAnd all staff is supposed\nto have an interest.\n\n225\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.210\nYou can't make people have an interest.\n\n226\n00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.940\nSo let's squash that rumor straight away.\n\n227\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.606\nBut if we've got clearly defined roles and\nresponsibilities,\n\n228\n00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:30.929\nif everybody knows what they're doing\nas part of any improvement initiative.\n\n229\n00:13:30.929 --> 00:13:36.243\nAnd as part of any particular task or\nactivity then they do have\n\n230\n00:13:36.243 --> 00:13:42.960\nan involvement especially if they\nhave what we call a vested interest.\n\n231\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.110\nIf they're given the right\nresponsibilities and\n\n232\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.920\naccountability and they understand\nwhere those responsibilities lie and\n\n233\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.040\nthen we give them the or we empower them.\n\n234\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.080\nWe give them the responsibility to be\nable to undertake those activities.\n\n235\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.530\nAgain, mistakes are made throughout\nCSI when we don't empower people,\n\n236\n00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.750\nwhen we try to micromanage.\n\n237\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.650\nBecause if we're micromanaging we\nmight as well do it ourselves, right?\n\n238\n00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.290\nThis is another one of our policies,\n\n239\n00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:18.000\nempowering people within CSI,\nto be able to deliver improvement.\n\n240\n00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.920\nEverybody has a responsibility to\nidentify an area of improvement.\n\n241\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.290\nLet's face it Ronnie, I'm sure that you\ncould think of anything in your life right\n\n242\n00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:32.050\nnow, whether it be your car,\nwhether it be with the way say,\n\n243\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.610\nmaybe your TV or\nyour cell phone provider works.\n\n244\n00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.310\nYou could think of an area right\nnow that could be improved.\n\n245\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.010\n&gt;&gt; No doubt.\n\n246\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we all can.\n\n247\n00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.370\nWe all live in an environment where we\ncan think of improvements to certain\n\n248\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.690\nprocesses, and what we're basically saying\nis that everybody's got a responsibility,\n\n249\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.120\nnot just to think of these improvements\nwithin IT but to document them.\n\n250\n00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.520\nAnd to do something with them,\nnot just ignore them.\n\n251\n00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.190\nCuz if you ignore them then\nthat results in low morale\n\n252\n00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.600\nbecause you don't feel as though you can\ndo anything with your improvement but\n\n253\n00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.839\nwe're never gonna get any better if we\nignore suggestions for improvement.\n\n254\n00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.090\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo,\nI get the point that you're saying.\n\n255\n00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.400\nBut it still goes back to\nthat process at times, right?\n\n256\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:18.910\nThat people may know that something\nneeds to be done to make it better.\n\n257\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.470\nThey know that there's something,\nmaybe it's one\n\n258\n00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.030\nof the those things that happens to me\nit's right on the tip of my tongue.\n\n259\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.970\nI think I know what I wanna say,\nbut I can't get it out.\n\n260\n00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.790\nSo how does this process kind of help\nthat to move forward to where we go,\n\n261\n00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.220\nthat's that identification?\n\n262\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.510\nHow do I get to that point?\n\n263\n00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.306\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nwell we have two tools at our disposal.\n\n264\n00:15:41.306 --> 00:15:44.920\nWe've got the seven step improvement\nprocess that we are going to go into in\n\n265\n00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.590\na little more depth.\n\n266\n00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.497\nBut we also have what\nwe call a CSI register.\n\n267\n00:15:48.497 --> 00:15:52.926\nAnd, the first thing I wanna tell you\nabout CSI register is that it should be\n\n268\n00:15:52.926 --> 00:15:56.242\navailable for\nabsolutely everybody to have access to.\n\n269\n00:15:56.242 --> 00:16:02.123\nSo that Even in it's most basic format,\nwhich could be just a simple spreadsheet,\n\n270\n00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:08.000\nit can be an elaborate database as well\nbut let's keep it simple for a moment.\n\n271\n00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.390\nIf we have a centralized spreadsheet where\neverybody can list their opportunities,\n\n272\n00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:16.470\ntheir ideas for improvement,\nthen we've got that visibility.\n\n273\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.775\nSo the minute that it's in your head,\nthen it needs to be on the spreadsheet.\n\n274\n00:16:19.775 --> 00:16:21.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n275\n00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.020\n&gt;&gt; And at that point in time then,\nwe can move forward and\n\n276\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:29.989\ntake the seven step improvement process\nif we need to, to progress that.\n\n277\n00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:30.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n278\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.990\nSometimes an opportunity for\nimprovement, is really obvious.\n\n279\n00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.040\nI need to improve x.\n\n280\n00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.140\nOkay, that's great.\n\n281\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.700\nThen we might not need the seven\nstep improvement process,\n\n282\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.470\nwe might go into the CSI approach.\n\n283\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.090\nBut sometimes we just know\nthat we've got a challenge,\n\n284\n00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.090\nas I mentioned with the service desk.\n\n285\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:53.080\nSo the service desk, we know that\ncustomer satisfaction is not great and so\n\n286\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.310\nwe want to improve that.\n\n287\n00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.570\nAnd this is where the seven step\nimprovement process comes in.\n\n288\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.820\nBut first of all that should be\nlisted as an opportunity for\n\n289\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.800\nimprovement on our CSI register.\n\n290\n00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.390\nThis is where we say okay,\ncustomer satisfaction is very,\n\n291\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.868\nvery low on the service desk, okay.\n\n292\n00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.572\nSo that's our improvement.\n\n293\n00:17:12.572 --> 00:17:17.045\nSo what we should be doing on\na regular basis is making sure that,\n\n294\n00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:20.335\nremember that we are about\ndelivering value to the business.\n\n295\n00:17:20.335 --> 00:17:23.355\nWe gotta make sure that we\nare delivering value to the business.\n\n296\n00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:27.015\nSo the business relationship\nmanagement process,\n\n297\n00:17:27.015 --> 00:17:30.470\nwhich is a process that well,\nsits in service strategy but\n\n298\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:35.850\nobviously undertakes a lot of activities\nthroughout the service life cycle itself.\n\n299\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:40.140\nBusiness relationship management should\nbe constantly on a regular basis,\n\n300\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.470\nor continually as we like to say.\n\n301\n00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.260\nCheck in with the organization that we\nare meeting their requirements, but\n\n302\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.880\nwe should also within IT.\n\n303\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.340\nWe check in that we are not just meeting\nthe organization's requirements,\n\n304\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.540\nbut that we are able to compete.\n\n305\n00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.700\nNow I don't like to use that word because\nnot everything's about a competition.\n\n306\n00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.480\nAnd sometimes our USP\n\n307\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.300\nis really the fact that we know our\norganization better than anybody else.\n\n308\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:15.510\nBut we really, really should be aware\nof what our competitors are achieving.\n\n309\n00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.190\nAnd what other new technologies\nare out there in the marketplace.\n\n310\n00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.520\nBecause things change all the time,\nespecially nowadays,\n\n311\n00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.460\ntechnology moves so quickly.\n\n312\n00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.350\nWe're getting new cellphone every year and\npeople expect to see new technology,\n\n313\n00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.600\nthey expect to see new\nfunctionality on a regular basis.\n\n314\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.160\nSo we should be constantly\ncontinually looking to see\n\n315\n00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.640\nwhat is out there in the big wide world,\nand what we can make use of.\n\n316\n00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.377\nCSI is not something that's ad hoc,\n\n317\n00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:50.245\ncuz when I mention continually,\nI mean on a regular basis.\n\n318\n00:18:50.245 --> 00:18:55.062\nSo we should have tasks set for\nabsolutely everybody in our organization,\n\n319\n00:18:55.062 --> 00:18:57.895\nour IT organization to\nreview what they do.\n\n320\n00:18:57.895 --> 00:19:01.795\nAnd compare it against what's\nhappening in the big wide world\n\n321\n00:19:01.795 --> 00:19:03.805\noutside of our organization.\n\n322\n00:19:03.805 --> 00:19:05.336\nWe should be doing that\non a regular basis, okay.\n\n323\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.420\nWe should be understanding what\nwe offer to our organization and\n\n324\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.080\nwhat's available out there.\n\n325\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.350\nIn other words, what they can source\nout there, that they can't get from us.\n\n326\n00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:21.058\nCuz that might be a key driver in\nthem making any decisions that might\n\n327\n00:19:21.058 --> 00:19:23.629\nactually affect us in the long term.\n\n328\n00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.470\nSo CSI is not something that\nyou can do just as a one off.\n\n329\n00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.790\nCSI is something that we have\nto undertake regularly, okay.\n\n330\n00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:40.410\nCSI features in management framework, so\nprocess maturity framework, such as CMMI.\n\n331\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.820\nWhere we look at CSI as being\nthe pinnacle of maturity for any process.\n\n332\n00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.580\nSo we're continually looking to\nimprove any particular process and\n\n333\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.150\nwe should be doing that with our service\nand our services and our technologies,\n\n334\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.710\netc as well.\n\n335\n00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:59.900\nNow of course, you can't know whether\nyou can improve if you don't know\n\n336\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:06.000\nhow you're performing right now and this\nis why we need to start with measurement.\n\n337\n00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.390\nStart looking at where we are right now.\n\n338\n00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.830\nBut again, go back to knowledge\nmanagement and think about the fact\n\n339\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:16.120\nthat when you take any metric, it has to\nenable you to make an informed decision.\n\n340\n00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.879\nIn other words,\nit has to tell you something.\n\n341\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:24.021\nSo let's take a look at this CSI then\nseven step improvement process, okay.\n\n342\n00:20:24.021 --> 00:20:26.940\nAnd we start off right at the very top.\n\n343\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.459\nNumber one, with our vision.\n\n344\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.680\nAnd we call this our strategy for\nimprovement.\n\n345\n00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.380\nWhat is our vision?\n\n346\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.230\nWe have to know what\ndirection we're going in.\n\n347\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.340\nIf you don't know what\ndirection you're going in,\n\n348\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.560\nthen any data you gather could\njust be meaningless data.\n\n349\n00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.160\nAnd of course, if we go into step number\ntwo, that's all about defining data.\n\n350\n00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.010\nSo let's take a look at\nstep number one then.\n\n351\n00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.050\nStep number one, and\n\n352\n00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:57.630\nwe're gonna go through these in\nmore detail in our next session.\n\n353\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.790\nBut step number one talks about\nidentifying the strategy for improvement.\n\n354\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.400\nAnd that strategy,\n\n355\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.880\nas I've already mentioned is the service\ndesk is just not performing.\n\n356\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.130\nOkay, we're just not well.\n\n357\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.630\nNo, that's wrong to say.\n\n358\n00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.520\nThe example that I gave you\nwith the service desk, well,\n\n359\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.240\nour users just weren't happy with them.\n\n360\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.620\nSo that's our strategy is to\nimprove the service desk.\n\n361\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.770\nBut I don't know what's wrong.\n\n362\n00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.950\nSo now I'm gonna go and\ndefine what I'm going to measure.\n\n363\n00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.310\nBy defining what I'm going to measure,\nI'm going to say okay, so\n\n364\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.630\nhow do I know where I am right now?\n\n365\n00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:36.440\nSo I might look at things like\nincident resolution rates.\n\n366\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.710\nRight, are we achieving incident\nresolution within those service level\n\n367\n00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.100\ntargets that are defined in the SLA, okay?\n\n368\n00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.600\nOr I might look at the core value or\nI might look at how quickly we're\n\n369\n00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.650\nresolving telephone calls or how quickly\nwe're answering telephone calls.\n\n370\n00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.379\nI might look at the called the queuing\nrate, in other words how many people\n\n371\n00:21:55.379 --> 00:21:58.910\nare sat in the queue or\nsystem at any one point in time.\n\n372\n00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:03.698\nI might actually look at say\nthe incident backlog for instance, okay.\n\n373\n00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:09.514\nSo here I am defining what\nmeasurements I'm going to take,\n\n374\n00:22:09.514 --> 00:22:12.550\nand then I go out and I gather the data.\n\n375\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.086\nAnd the people that\nare gonna be doing this for\n\n376\n00:22:15.086 --> 00:22:19.370\nme in this particular example\nare going to be service desk analysts.\n\n377\n00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.220\nWe may even have reporting analysts, okay.\n\n378\n00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.500\nThese are people that are going to go\nout and just take that information.\n\n379\n00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.410\nEvent management is going to help us with\nthis because as a process event management\n\n380\n00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.470\nwill be doing a lot of monitoring.\n\n381\n00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.290\nSo they're going to\nprovide some input too.\n\n382\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.480\nService level management are gonna be\nproviding some input too because they're\n\n383\n00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.300\ngoing to be telling us what\nservice level targets they have.\n\n384\n00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.370\nSo we might want to compare ourselves\nagainst those service level targets.\n\n385\n00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.470\nBut of course, we're gonna be gathering\nas I mentioned a lot of data that is\n\n386\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.400\nnot in the service level target.\n\n387\n00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.240\nData such as number of people in\nthe called queuing system at any point\n\n388\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:55.890\nin time, etc.\n\n389\n00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.920\nSo here I go out and I gather the data.\n\n390\n00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.680\nNow in that particular section there,\nnumber three there,\n\n391\n00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.200\nthe second bullet point,\nlook at the word integrity.\n\n392\n00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.470\nAnd that's a really key word is we've\ngot to ensure the integrity of the data.\n\n393\n00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:18.510\nOkay and the integrity of that data,\nif it's open to any type of,\n\n394\n00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:24.320\nand I hate to use the word corruption,\nbut if it's used to any type of change,\n\n395\n00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.677\nmanual intervention, then we've got to\nensure that the integrity is intact, okay.\n\n396\n00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:36.610\nBecause if we're trying to achieve\na certain goal, then it's very,\n\n397\n00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.980\nvery easy for us to try and make the data\nlook as though we're achieving the goal.\n\n398\n00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.760\nBut as I always say,\nI never wanna see a green in a slam chart.\n\n399\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.430\nIf I see a slam chart and everything\nis all green, I will tell you that your\n\n400\n00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.998\nmeasuring the wrong thing because\nI wanna see areas for improvement.\n\n401\n00:23:51.998 --> 00:23:54.524\nI donâ€™t wanna see that\neverything is going great,\n\n402\n00:23:54.524 --> 00:23:57.928\ncuz I guarantee Iâ€™ll walk out to\none of your customers and say, hey,\n\n403\n00:23:57.928 --> 00:24:00.830\nis everything okay with IT,\nand they wonâ€™t tell me that.\n\n404\n00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:07.090\nSo now once I've gathered the data,\nthen I'm going to process it.\n\n405\n00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.400\nI'm going to categorize it,\nthat's what this really means.\n\n406\n00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.510\nI'm going to format it, okay.\n\n407\n00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.280\nI'm going to format and I'm going\nto put in maybe days of the week,\n\n408\n00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.100\nfor instance, or\nI might put it in hours of the day.\n\n409\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.050\nThis is where we just process the data and\n\n410\n00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:26.040\nwe'll have a data analyst\nthat's going to do that for us.\n\n411\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.850\nOkay.\n\n412\n00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.080\nAnd the data analyst might be\nthe service desk analyst or\n\n413\n00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.370\nit might be a defined reporting analyst,\nor a CSI analyst.\n\n414\n00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.160\nDepends on the size of the organization\nas to whoâ€™s going to be involved.\n\n415\n00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.320\nAnd then I'm going to analyze the data.\n\n416\n00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:45.290\nNow that analysis is where we come\nup with exactly what's happening.\n\n417\n00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.390\nThat gives us the information,\n\n418\n00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:52.960\nthis is in our knowledge part where\nalready we've done the information part.\n\n419\n00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.250\nIf you look in the furthest\ncorners of the dotted line there,\n\n420\n00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.810\nyou'll see data information,\nknowledge, and wisdom.\n\n421\n00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.050\nThat's from knowledge management.\n\n422\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.340\nSo we've done the information part,\nin other words we've joined the dot,\n\n423\n00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.600\nwe've joined our relationships\ntogether between our data sources, and\n\n424\n00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.040\nnow we're into analyzing it.\n\n425\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.790\nThis is where we put\nthe knowledge together.\n\n426\n00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.940\nOkay.\nAnd we'll analyze.\n\n427\n00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.080\nSo we can break it down and\nwe can see that, maybe for\n\n428\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.570\nexample, that we've got\nan issue on a Monday morning.\n\n429\n00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:29.360\nAnd that issue on a Monday morning\nis quite simply the fact that well,\n\n430\n00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.280\nRonnie seems to not get through too\nmany phone calls on a Monday morning,\n\n431\n00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.400\nyeah he's not too great at\nanswering the phone on a Monday.\n\n432\n00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:36.940\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n433\n00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:42.100\n&gt;&gt; And this is why our customers are\nparticularly unhappy, because on a Monday\n\n434\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:47.550\nmorning we seem to have an extended number\nof people in the call queuing system.\n\n435\n00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.720\nSo we present that information, normally\nby the way of a nice pretty picture,\n\n436\n00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.810\nto enable informed decision making,\nthereby giving us wisdom.\n\n437\n00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.100\nWe present that information.\n\n438\n00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.130\nAnd in this instance, it's probably gonna\nbe to the service desk manager, and\n\n439\n00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.359\nthe service desk manager is going to say,\nokay, I see exactly where the problem is.\n\n440\n00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.580\nAnd this is where we\nimplement the improvement.\n\n441\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:14.230\nAnd at this point in time, we're kind of\nnow into that CSI approach where we're\n\n442\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:18.890\nlooking at, okay, so we know where we\nare right now, now where do I want to be?\n\n443\n00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:21.720\nAnd how am I going to get there?\n\n444\n00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.580\nAnd in this instance,\nwe know that Ronnie is weird,\n\n445\n00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:30.220\nhe's not doing his work on a Monday\nmorning, okay, he's just not up to it.\n\n446\n00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.890\nSo what kind of improvements\ndo we want to implement?\n\n447\n00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.880\nWell we might want to get him in and\nout earlier on a Monday morning and\n\n448\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.260\ngive him more coffee.\n\n449\n00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.120\nOkay that might be an option for us.\n\n450\n00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.380\nSo what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to implement that improvement.\n\n451\n00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.550\nAnd then we implement that improvement and\n\n452\n00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:51.230\nwe do check after we implemented\nthe improvement that it has worked.\n\n453\n00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.670\nAnd that then helps us identify the\nstrategy for our next improvement because\n\n454\n00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.780\nof course even with the CSI approach we\nlook at this and say well what's next?\n\n455\n00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.710\nOkay because you never\never want to stagnate.\n\n456\n00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.930\nSo that in a nutshell is the seven\nstep improvement process.\n\n457\n00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.680\nWe're going to go into each\nstep in non-excession.\n\n458\n00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.860\nWe're going to go into each step in\nmore detail, but I just want to.\n\n459\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.730\nBefore we close this particular\nsession I want to just take a look at\n\n460\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.010\nthe next slide that we have in front\nof us, which is our knowledge spiral.\n\n461\n00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:32.810\nAnd it really just shows you\nthat at every single level,\n\n462\n00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:37.290\nat every single level\nwe have an input into,\n\n463\n00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.860\nwell I was going to say\nhierarchical levels above.\n\n464\n00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.570\nSo if you look at step six, and\nI'm going to bring up the previous slide,\n\n465\n00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.630\nstep six here presenting that information.\n\n466\n00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.040\nPresenting that information that tells me\n\n467\n00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.390\nthat Ronnie's not particularly\ngreat on a Monday morning, okay?\n\n468\n00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:01.980\nWell, that is actually an input into\nwhat we call the tactical level.\n\n469\n00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.400\nAnd that could be an input into\nthe gathering the data at tactical level.\n\n470\n00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.780\nAnd at tactical level our management\nmight decide, well, actually,\n\n471\n00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.160\nmaybe the right place for\nRonnie is not on the service desk.\n\n472\n00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.850\nAnd again they're going to do exactly\nthe same thing at a tactical level.\n\n473\n00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:22.770\nAnd we can see that Ronnie's not\nparticularly performing well.\n\n474\n00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:28.090\nAnd therefore in step six at a tactical\nlevel the suggestion might be after\n\n475\n00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:32.900\nanalyzing the data that actually maybe\nRonnie might be suited somewhere else.\n\n476\n00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.640\nAnd that will then feed into the strategy,\nand maybe the strategy for\n\n477\n00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.260\nthe service desk.\n\n478\n00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:42.820\nOr maybe the strategy for third level guys\nbecause they had their eye on Ronnie for\n\n479\n00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.040\nquite some time and\nthey're really desperate to have him.\n\n480\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.610\nSo every single output from the seven\nstep improvement process is\n\n481\n00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.070\ngoing to be an input\ninto another improvement.\n\n482\n00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:57.830\nAnd this is what we are trying\nto tell you by use of\n\n483\n00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.040\nthat particular slide is that\nnothing's done in isolation.\n\n484\n00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:08.050\nCSI, ultimately, cannot be, as we've\nalready said, an ad-hoc one of activity.\n\n485\n00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.870\nIt has to be something\nthat's continual and\n\n486\n00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.580\nall of our improvements\nare linked together.\n\n487\n00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.490\nSo, now that we've taken a look at\nthe seven step improvement process\n\n488\n00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:22.020\njust from a very, very high level,\nwe're going to expand in the next session.\n\n489\n00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.340\nWe're going to expand on\neach one of those steps.\n\n490\n00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.400\nAnd we're just gonna take\nyou a little bit further,\n\n491\n00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.240\nin depth,\ninto the identify in the strategy, etc.\n\n492\n00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.960\nAnd then gather in information.\n\n493\n00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.130\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well, thank you again for\n\n494\n00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.920\nat least giving us this\nhigh level overview.\n\n495\n00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.320\nA lot of things to think about as we\nstart taking a look at more in depth\n\n496\n00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.670\nactivities that we can do to improve\nwhat we have in our organization.\n\n497\n00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.860\nWell that is also a great place for\nus to end this episode as well.\n\n498\n00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.660\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n499\n00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n500\n00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.920\n&gt;&gt; Stay tune right here for\nmore ITIL

00:00:08.435\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:10.725\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:15.106\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:19.340\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.918\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're actually in a part two,\n\n8\n00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:25.832\ntaking a look at the seven-step\nimprovement process.\n\n9\n00:00:25.832 --> 00:00:31.292\nAnd here with us of course is gonna be our\nITIL big kahuna herself, Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:32.708\nJo, welcome back to the show!\n\n11\n00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:34.606\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that flattering, or is-\n\n12\n00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:35.570\n&gt;&gt; It is!\n\n13\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.478\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm worried!\n\n14\n00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:37.902\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's flattery.\n\n15\n00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:40.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.212\nI was gonna say I'm really\npleased to be here.\n\n17\n00:00:43.212 --> 00:00:45.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm not so sure.\n\n18\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.884\n&gt;&gt; Big kahuna, is the top dog.\n\n19\n00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:48.612\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go.\n\n20\n00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:50.432\n&gt;&gt; All right, all right,\nI'll let you off, then.\n\n21\n00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:52.226\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n22\n00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:55.227\nSo Jo, we've been talking about\nthe idea of the seven steps,\n\n23\n00:00:55.227 --> 00:00:58.995\nthese activities that we can do to help\nus in continual service improvement.\n\n24\n00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:03.873\nWe've gone over a high level overview,\nand Jo you promised that we're\n\n25\n00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:08.195\ndiving a bit deeper if not incredibly\ninto the deep end of this.\n\n26\n00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:11.935\nSo Jo, where are we going to,\nat least tip or just put our toe in and\n\n27\n00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:16.031\nthen just kinda get pushed under\nwater here, where are we gonna start?\n\n28\n00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:17.459\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I did promise.\n\n29\n00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:20.391\nI did promise and I'm,\nwas gonna live up to her promises.\n\n30\n00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:24.272\nSo yeah, we're gonna get straight\nback into it in this part two,\n\n31\n00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:28.237\nlooking in a lot more depth at\nthe Seven Step Improvement Process.\n\n32\n00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:33.190\nAnd we're gonna go into each step and\nin a lot more detail.\n\n33\n00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.253\nAnd we're gonna cover this in\nthe next few sessions as well.\n\n34\n00:01:35.253 --> 00:01:40.510\nThis is not something that we can cover\nall in just one particular session.\n\n35\n00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.753\nSo let's just have a quick recap then on\nwhat the Seven Step Improvement Process\n\n36\n00:01:44.753 --> 00:01:45.460\nlooks like.\n\n37\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.730\nIt should be on your screen right now.\n\n38\n00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.110\nThere we go, look at that, as if by magic.\n\n39\n00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.850\nWe've got seven steps, that's why we call\nit the Seven Step Improvement Process.\n\n40\n00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.582\nAnd we start off by working out\nexactly what, where we want to be,\n\n41\n00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:02.314\nwhat is that strategy?\n\n42\n00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:04.308\nAnd then we define what\nwe're going to measure.\n\n43\n00:02:04.308 --> 00:02:07.364\nWe gather the data,\nwe process it, we analyze it,\n\n44\n00:02:07.364 --> 00:02:10.847\nwe present it by a way of a nice\npretty picture usually, and\n\n45\n00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:14.020\nthen we make a decision and\nwe do something about it.\n\n46\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.810\nWe implement and improve it and\nthen we start again.\n\n47\n00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.969\nIt's a continual process.\n\n48\n00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.764\nSo Ronnie,\ncan you remember when I said we would use\n\n49\n00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:26.101\nthe Seven Step Improvement Process,\nwhy would we use it?\n\n50\n00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:26.617\n&gt;&gt; No, I can't.\n\n51\n00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:29.798\nI was trying to think of when I could\nremember, but it wasn't that long ago.\n\n52\n00:02:29.798 --> 00:02:31.194\nAnd it just flew right by me.\n\n53\n00:02:31.194 --> 00:02:32.702\nSo Jo, you'll have to help me out here.\n\n54\n00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:34.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not a problem at all.\n\n55\n00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You should be in one of my classes.\n\n56\n00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.237\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n57\n00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:44.794\nwe would use these processes\nwhen we've got an opportunity,\n\n58\n00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:49.537\nwe know that this, we've got\na challenge in front of us, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:53.489\nBut we don't quite know exactly\nwhat it is that we need to improve.\n\n60\n00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.873\nWe just know that something\nneeds improving, yeah.\n\n61\n00:02:57.873 --> 00:03:01.366\nSo the example that we used in\nthe last session was about, well,\n\n62\n00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:04.083\nclearly you weren't paying\nattention on a Monday\n\n63\n00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.301\nmorning-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n64\n00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:06.060\nagain, continual service improvement.\n\n65\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.641\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n66\n00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:07.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a good example,\n\n67\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.615\nmy memory is kind of lacking.\n\n68\n00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:12.143\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna carry on with that theme\n\n69\n00:03:12.143 --> 00:03:16.806\nright now, we're gonna carry on with\nthe fact that Ronnie needs more coffee on\n\n70\n00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:18.376\na Monday morning, okay.\n\n71\n00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:19.029\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I do.\n\n72\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.903\n&gt;&gt; We're going to take a look in a lot\nmore depth at each particular step within\n\n73\n00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:27.182\nour Seven Step Improvement Process.\n\n74\n00:03:27.182 --> 00:03:30.840\nSo the first one is identifying\nthe strategy for improvement.\n\n75\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.199\nNow in the example I gave you, it was\nreally about looking at the service desk\n\n76\n00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:42.231\nand looking at the fact that our service\ndesk quite, well, wasn't really achieving\n\n77\n00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:47.789\nthe satisfaction results that we'd\nexpect from our users and our customers.\n\n78\n00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:51.618\nSo that could be our strategy for\nimprovement.\n\n79\n00:03:51.618 --> 00:03:54.361\nBut then, it's not just as simple as that,\n\n80\n00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:58.540\nbecause we know that service\ndesk is not performing.\n\n81\n00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.572\nBut the first question we've\ngot to ask is, well, if people\n\n82\n00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:05.630\naren't happy with the service desk, what\nis it they want from the service desk?\n\n83\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.120\nYou would not believe how many times\nthis particular step is overlooked.\n\n84\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.891\nAnd we launch into, and the example that I\ngave you when we looked at Session one was\n\n85\n00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:21.560\nthe service desk is just not producing\nsome very good customer results.\n\n86\n00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.808\nSo let's take a look at call resolution.\n\n87\n00:04:23.808 --> 00:04:28.490\nLet's take a look at how long it takes\nto answer a telephone, etc., etc.\n\n88\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.113\nBut the one thing that we didn't\ndo is actually go back and\n\n89\n00:04:32.113 --> 00:04:35.598\nsee what the vision was for\nthe service desk and for IT.\n\n90\n00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:40.454\nIf our service desk is predominantly\nbased on, and I did this deliberately,\n\n91\n00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:43.216\nby the way because I\nneed to mention it here,\n\n92\n00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:47.871\nif our service desk is predominantly\nbased on bringing in E-mail calls.\n\n93\n00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:52.722\nThen the fact that we've got\na long queue on the telephones\n\n94\n00:04:52.722 --> 00:04:56.880\nactually might not be too\nmuch of a problem at all,\n\n95\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.230\nif our customers don't want to\ntalk to us via telephone anyway.\n\n96\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.150\nOr it might be an issue.\n\n97\n00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.270\nOr maybe we've got different\nservice level targets for\n\n98\n00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.400\nexternal customers than we do for\ninternal customers.\n\n99\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.534\nUntil we understand all of this,\n\n100\n00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:17.420\nthen we're not able to identify\nthe strategy for improvement.\n\n101\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.662\nSo that's a big chunk of the work is\nactually working out how we're going\n\n102\n00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:28.790\nto improve, or\nrather what does improvement really mean?\n\n103\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.530\nWhat is the organization\ntrying to achieve?\n\n104\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.328\nBecause we've got to\nfacilitate those outcomes.\n\n105\n00:05:34.328 --> 00:05:36.830\nHow do they want to work?\n\n106\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.431\nAnd that key point at the bottom\nthat talks about revisiting this,\n\n107\n00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:40.135\nwell guess what?\n\n108\n00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:43.410\nThis is just not a one-off exercise.\n\n109\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.874\nYou see, because the organization\ntechnology changes over time.\n\n110\n00:05:47.874 --> 00:05:51.435\nBut the way that the organization works,\nwell, that changes over time as well.\n\n111\n00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:54.346\nAnd it might have been\nacceptable two years ago,\n\n112\n00:05:54.346 --> 00:05:59.326\nthree years ago to have a service desk\nthat predominantly answered the telephone.\n\n113\n00:06:00.715 --> 00:06:04.379\nAnd in fact, if we go back ten years, then\nthat's what service desk analysts did.\n\n114\n00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:07.285\nService desk analysts\nserviced over the telephone.\n\n115\n00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:11.616\nMore and more though now, our calls\ninto a service desk come in via chat,\n\n116\n00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:12.617\nchat facility.\n\n117\n00:06:12.617 --> 00:06:18.637\nThey come in via email, they come in via\nan app on a cell phone, for instance.\n\n118\n00:06:18.637 --> 00:06:21.445\nSo what was the norm ten years ago?\n\n119\n00:06:21.445 --> 00:06:26.052\nAnd what even might've been accepted\nwithin the organization two years ago,\n\n120\n00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:29.557\nis not necessarily the vision for\nthe organization today.\n\n121\n00:06:30.837 --> 00:06:34.690\nSee, we can't make assumptions and\nyet we do.\n\n122\n00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.376\nAnd we will assume that\nour vision is exactly\n\n123\n00:06:38.376 --> 00:06:41.670\nthe same as it was even 12 months ago.\n\n124\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.440\nAnd yet, the vision might be completely\ndifferent to what it was 12 months ago.\n\n125\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.226\nBut the vision for the next 12\nmonths might be even more different.\n\n126\n00:06:51.226 --> 00:06:56.270\nIt might be even more out there and\nforward thinking.\n\n127\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.144\nSo if we don't continually check what\nstrategies the organization has,\n\n128\n00:07:01.144 --> 00:07:06.882\nif we don't continually check what way of\nworking the organization wants to achieve,\n\n129\n00:07:06.882 --> 00:07:10.354\nthen we're not going to\nfacilitate that strategy.\n\n130\n00:07:10.354 --> 00:07:12.296\nWe're going to hinder it.\n\n131\n00:07:12.296 --> 00:07:13.994\nIn service strategy, and\n\n132\n00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:18.704\npreviously in continual service\nimprovement we look at the strategy for\n\n133\n00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:23.490\nthe organization and we'll divide that\ninto sort of three very level high\n\n134\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:29.710\ncategories that run the business and grow\nthe business and transform the business.\n\n135\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:36.100\nSometimes we see that IT, it can be in\na different strategy to the organization.\n\n136\n00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.690\nThe way the organization is looking\nto grow, if IT as a service provider\n\n137\n00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:47.486\nis just in a mindset of just treading\nwater and just running the business.\n\n138\n00:07:47.486 --> 00:07:51.939\nThen actually you've got an organization\nwho's desperately trying to get out\n\n139\n00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:56.790\nthere in the big, wide world, and who's\ndesperately trying to increase profit, and\n\n140\n00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.194\nIT is holding them back.\n\n141\n00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:03.193\nAnd that can be quite a challenge\nSometimes the opposite happens and\n\n142\n00:08:03.193 --> 00:08:07.137\nthe organization is quite\nhappy just to tread water,\n\n143\n00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:11.300\njust to sort of maintain\na steady environment.\n\n144\n00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.420\nBut IT is so desperate to innovate, and so\n\n145\n00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.340\ndesperate to try new things that\nthey're pushing the business to grow,\n\n146\n00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.780\npossibly faster than the business\ncan actually physically grow.\n\n147\n00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.989\nThat can be another challenge in and\nof itself as well.\n\n148\n00:08:25.989 --> 00:08:30.650\nBecause we're an IT service\nprovider forcing an organization to\n\n149\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.770\ngrow if the organization is not\nproperly equipped to be able to grow.\n\n150\n00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.790\nIf it doesn't have\nthe right number of people.\n\n151\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.660\nIf it doesn't have the right skills,\n\n152\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.400\nthen this is where we see\nan organization in trouble.\n\n153\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.480\nSo it's really important that we\nfacilitate their outcomes, as we define\n\n154\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:54.230\nin the service, but that we actually\nfacilitate their strategy as well.\n\n155\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.289\nWe cannot be fighting\nagainst the organization.\n\n156\n00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.080\nSo, as part of this identify the strategy,\nnot only have we got this challenge,\n\n157\n00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.580\nbut we still have to work out exactly\nwhat it is we're trying to achieve.\n\n158\n00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.370\nSo, let's take a look on\nthe right hand side then of that\n\n159\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.060\nparticular slide at these key inputs.\n\n160\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.540\nAnd you'll see that we use things like\nthe Vision and Mission statement,\n\n161\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.275\ngovernance requirements,\nin other words the way that we work.\n\n162\n00:09:18.275 --> 00:09:20.410\nWe've seen that in a previous session.\n\n163\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.720\nWe looked at customer feedback,\nwell that was out input,\n\n164\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.550\nour key input into this\nparticular initiative.\n\n165\n00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.910\nWe looked at what's been\nrecommended in the CSI register but\n\n166\n00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.660\nwe also looked at what our organization\nis doing, what their plans are.\n\n167\n00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.520\nAnd all of those are key inputs\ninto that particular section.\n\n168\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.070\nIt's really important that we align\nourselves with the organization.\n\n169\n00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.050\nThis is not something that\nwe can do in isolation.\n\n170\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.840\nAnd so\nthese key inputs are very important to us.\n\n171\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.710\nNow, the mission statement and\nthe vision statement.\n\n172\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.760\nI expect to see that vision and\n\n173\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.993\nmission somewhere up there\non the Internet site, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:59.993 --> 00:10:03.400\nI expected to see it on the Internet site,\nI expect all of our,\n\n175\n00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.290\neven our external customers,\nto understand that.\n\n176\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.033\nBut we're gonna see a little bit later,\nin our next session,\n\n177\n00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:14.670\nwhat we call our vision to metrics tree\nand how we actually take that vision and\n\n178\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:21.290\nwe make that into something that\nwe can use ourselves, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:26.940\nSo we need to take all of those\ninto consideration before we even\n\n180\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.750\nembark on these 7 step\nimprovement process.\n\n181\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.700\nWe have to understand what\ndirection we're going in.\n\n182\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.350\nSo then step number 2 in our\nseven step improvement process,\n\n183\n00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:41.900\nwas all about going out and\ndefining what we can measure, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.482\nWe're going to think about\ncommon sense in this one, okay?\n\n185\n00:10:44.482 --> 00:10:48.970\nBecause we've got to think about\nwhat do I want to measure, but\n\n186\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.930\nthen what can I measure.\n\n187\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.190\nThat's really critical.\n\n188\n00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:59.210\nIf we can't physically go and take\nthose metrics, then why are we going to\n\n189\n00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:04.550\ninvest a lot of time and money and effort\ninto taking metrics that we can't take?\n\n190\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.920\nThink about the return on the investment\nof actually taking a measurement.\n\n191\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.910\nI mentioned in a previous session\n\n192\n00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.830\nthat we have this challenge\nwith the service desk consult.\n\n193\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.410\nI mentioned this, we went to the very\nbrief run through the seven step\n\n194\n00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.620\nimprovement process,\nthat in step 2 we'd go along, we look at\n\n195\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.370\nthings like maybe the number of people\nthat were in the call queuing system.\n\n196\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.640\nOr how quickly we answer telephone calls,\nhow we'd look at incident\n\n197\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.810\nresolution times, etc., and achievements\nagainst service level targets.\n\n198\n00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.040\nI expect that we should be measuring\nachievements against service level\n\n199\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.000\ntargets, but let's take a look at\nthe telephone side of things, just for\n\n200\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.839\na moment, just as an example, cause there\nwas a reason why I mentioned those.\n\n201\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.740\nSo we're going to go and\nwe're going to measurements as to\n\n202\n00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.820\nhow many people are in our call queuing\nsystem at any one point in time,\n\n203\n00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.110\nand what the average length\nof time they're waiting for.\n\n204\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.047\nWhat if we can't take that measurement?\n\n205\n00:12:02.047 --> 00:12:03.960\nWhat do we do?\n\n206\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.410\nDo we go and\nseek how to wait to take that measurement?\n\n207\n00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.590\nDo we go and\nspeak to our telephone provider and\n\n208\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.820\nask them if they can\ngive us that measurement?\n\n209\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.380\nHow much effort do we put into that?\n\n210\n00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.610\nAnd then let's compare that to the vision.\n\n211\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.680\nBecause if our vision and\nour direction is changing so\n\n212\n00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.660\nthat we want to encourage people\nto use maybe a cell phone app,\n\n213\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.000\nthen how much effort do we want\nto put into taking that metric?\n\n214\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.070\nIs that metric really\nan important metric for us?\n\n215\n00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.180\nIs it going to help us achieve our vision?\n\n216\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.460\nBut is it something\nthat's actually directly\n\n217\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.790\ninfluencing customer satisfaction?\n\n218\n00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.950\nThese are important questions.\n\n219\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.150\nIt might be something that's directly\ninfluencing customer satisfaction.\n\n220\n00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.000\nCustomers might not be happy\nbecause it's taken Ronnie\n\n221\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.980\na little bit too long to answer\nthe telephone on a Monday morning.\n\n222\n00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.399\nBut then the vision of the organization,\nand the vision of IT therefore,\n\n223\n00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:08.033\nmay be to move customers away\nfrom using the telephones, and\n\n224\n00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:11.973\nto get them to use their cell phone\napps or to get them to use email.\n\n225\n00:13:11.973 --> 00:13:13.090\nSo, what do we do?\n\n226\n00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:20.650\nDo we invest the time and money into\ntrying to obtain those statistics?\n\n227\n00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.400\nOr, do we say well those\nstatistics don't matter\n\n228\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.135\nbecause we're trying to move away\nfrom telephone calls, anyway?\n\n229\n00:13:27.135 --> 00:13:28.925\nBut you see, the fact of the matter is,\n\n230\n00:13:28.925 --> 00:13:31.270\nthe customer satisfaction\nis still not very high.\n\n231\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.744\nSo, what do we do?\n\n232\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.595\nIt's a question, and\n\n233\n00:13:39.595 --> 00:13:44.770\nno one's got the answer to that because\nthere is no right or wrong answer to that.\n\n234\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.835\nWe'll engage business\nrelationship management.\n\n235\n00:13:46.835 --> 00:13:47.490\nOkay.\n\n236\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.180\nBusiness management relationship is our\nprocess that it sits in service strategy,\n\n237\n00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:57.180\nthat looks at the relationship\nbetween IT and the business IT, and\n\n238\n00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.510\nthe customer, and business\nrelationship management should have\n\n239\n00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:05.570\na clear understanding of the direction and\nthe strategy for the organization.\n\n240\n00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.390\nBut just because the strategy for the\norganization is that we're going to move\n\n241\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.930\naway from telephone calls, and\nwe're going to move to say,\n\n242\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.490\napps on telephones, etc.,\ndoesn't mean that change comes easy.\n\n243\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.140\nAnd so we have to look for\n\n244\n00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:27.030\nways then to influence customer behavior\nthat might be demand management here.\n\n245\n00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.280\nWe have to look for\nways to influence customer behavior and\n\n246\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.710\nto actually bring them in to using apps,\netc.\n\n247\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:40.208\nSo does that mean then if that's\nthe strategy then we don't try and\n\n248\n00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:44.283\nsource the information on\nthe call queuing system?\n\n249\n00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:49.265\nWell, and this is where it gets into\na decision that we have to make, and\n\n250\n00:14:49.265 --> 00:14:52.671\nthat if it's going to cost\nus more money to try and\n\n251\n00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:57.492\nobtain those reports than the potential\nreturn on that investment,\n\n252\n00:14:57.492 --> 00:15:00.980\nthen do we still seek to\nobtain those reports?\n\n253\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.670\nBecause, you see, all of our measurements\nshould be directly related to our vision.\n\n254\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.820\nBut of course our vision for\n\n255\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:12.350\nthis particular improvement was to\nincrease customer satisfaction.\n\n256\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.120\nIt's a question that really there's\nno right or wrong answer to,\n\n257\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.190\nas I've already said.\n\n258\n00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.190\nBut it could be a dilemma that you face,\nand\n\n259\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.620\nit's a dilemma that a lot of our\norganizations face on a regular basis.\n\n260\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.370\nAnd I will tell you.\n\n261\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.010\nAs an external consultant,\nI will come in and\n\n262\n00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:35.200\nI will advise that we will take what\nmeasurements we can currently take.\n\n263\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.730\nSo looking at the tools that\nwe currently have in place,\n\n264\n00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.910\nwe will take what\nmeasurements we can take.\n\n265\n00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:45.809\nBut then we need to launch some form of\nawareness campaign, and that would be part\n\n266\n00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:50.783\nof implementing the improvement a little\nbit later on in the 7-step improvement\n\n267\n00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:55.922\nprocess, to actually try and divert our\ncustomers away from using the telephones.\n\n268\n00:15:55.922 --> 00:16:00.382\nThat we don't invest too much time,\nand too much money, and\n\n269\n00:16:00.382 --> 00:16:05.818\ntoo much effort into obtaining\nmeasurements that we simply cannot take.\n\n270\n00:16:05.818 --> 00:16:10.481\nThink about what's not just\nimportant to the business, but\n\n271\n00:16:10.481 --> 00:16:15.410\nalso what's important to\nthe vision of the organization.\n\n272\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.990\nBecause, you see,\nthey are two different things, okay?\n\n273\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.070\nWhat's important to the vision of\nthe organization in this example was\n\n274\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.240\nto move away from telephone calls and\nmove to more mobile apps.\n\n275\n00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.770\nThat's what's important to\nthe strategy of the organization.\n\n276\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.610\nBut what's important to the customers\nin the business is the fact that\n\n277\n00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.450\nthe tech service desk needs to pick up\nthe telephone when they call them, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.540\nSo we need to think about both.\n\n279\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.993\nAnd we also need to think about\nthings like business impact, etc.\n\n280\n00:16:40.993 --> 00:16:43.440\nAnd even what's happening\nin the big wide world.\n\n281\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.920\nThere's a little let's\ntalk icon on the right\n\n282\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.600\nhand side of the screen in\nfront of you and it asks about\n\n283\n00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.710\ncan technical measurements be linked\nthrough to business requirements?\n\n284\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.178\nWell, I've already mentioned that we're\ngonna talk about our vision to metrics\n\n285\n00:16:57.178 --> 00:16:58.343\ntree a little bit later on.\n\n286\n00:16:58.343 --> 00:17:01.550\nI know all of our measurements\nshould be in some way shape or\n\n287\n00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.800\nform linked through to the vision.\n\n288\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.430\nIf our measurements don't help us\nachieve our organization's vision.\n\n289\n00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.040\nThen I have to ask, why are we measuring?\n\n290\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.980\nWe have to be able to make decisions\nwith any single measurement, and\n\n291\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.460\nthose decisions have to drive us\ntowards better business alignment.\n\n292\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.220\nSo sorts of things that\nwe would be looking for\n\n293\n00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.740\nin step two then are things like\nservice level requirements and targets.\n\n294\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.348\nWhat we're already taking,\nwhat we already have to have,\n\n295\n00:17:30.348 --> 00:17:33.737\nwhat's in our catalog,\nour goals and our objectives,\n\n296\n00:17:33.737 --> 00:17:38.302\nany legislative requirements that we\nmay have, I can never say that word.\n\n297\n00:17:38.302 --> 00:17:41.723\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Any governance requirements\n\n298\n00:17:41.723 --> 00:17:43.880\nwithin our organization.\n\n299\n00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.295\nAlso things like money and as I've\nsaid we need to be able to demonstrate\n\n300\n00:17:48.295 --> 00:17:52.638\nthe return on any investment that we\nmake in bringing in new tools, for\n\n301\n00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:55.235\ninstance, to take those measurements.\n\n302\n00:17:55.235 --> 00:18:02.320\nAnd then step three is where we go out and\nwe gather the data, okay?\n\n303\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:08.650\nSo this is where we consider things like\nhow often are we going to take data?\n\n304\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.790\nWhat type of data are we going to take?\n\n305\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.738\nIs it gonna be manual, or\nis it gonna be automated?\n\n306\n00:18:13.738 --> 00:18:17.611\nWe're gonna look in the next slide\nat the technology process and\n\n307\n00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:19.770\nend to end service metrics, okay?\n\n308\n00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.177\nWhat should come out of this gathering\nthe data, well, is all of the data.\n\n309\n00:18:24.177 --> 00:18:26.220\nThat's very simple, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.842\nSo let's look at the tasks in the right\nhand side there when it looks at\n\n311\n00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:32.098\nmonitoring data collection procedures.\n\n312\n00:18:32.098 --> 00:18:39.370\nThis is just a guideline,\nnothing more than that.\n\n313\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:45.320\nThis is, from an ideal perspective,\na framework.\n\n314\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.600\nThis is what this is,\na flexible framework.\n\n315\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.680\nSo this is what we would say our steps\nthat you will probably want to take,\n\n316\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.335\nsuch as defining how you're\ngoing to collect the data,\n\n317\n00:18:58.335 --> 00:19:01.630\ndefining how often you're\ngoing to collect the data,\n\n318\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.070\nwhat kind of tools you're going\nto use to collect the data.\n\n319\n00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:10.800\nBut bearing in mind, okay, this is\ncompletely dependent on your organization\n\n320\n00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.650\nand also the scale of the improvement\nthat you're wanting to make as well.\n\n321\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.170\nBecause if I look at all of these steps,\n\n322\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.850\nthis looks very much like\na project plan to me.\n\n323\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.784\nWell, if I look at these and I look at the\nfact that we're planning all of these out\n\n324\n00:19:24.784 --> 00:19:27.771\nsurely that's gonna take months,\nyes, to do?\n\n325\n00:19:27.771 --> 00:19:30.334\nNot necessarily, this might only take ten,\n\n326\n00:19:30.334 --> 00:19:33.646\nfive minutes to actually work\nout what we're going to do.\n\n327\n00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:37.550\nAnd sometimes just a pen and a piece\nof paper is gonna help us with this.\n\n328\n00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.300\nAnd the thing is, all we need to do\nafterwards is document this, because this\n\n329\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.480\nis part of our consistent approach,\nis making sure that we document it.\n\n330\n00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.992\nSo whilst we might have those tasks on the\nright hand side laid out in front of us,\n\n331\n00:19:50.992 --> 00:19:55.124\nand it might look bureaucratic,\nit isn't bureaucratic.\n\n332\n00:19:55.124 --> 00:19:58.174\nAnd this is one of our\nkey challenges with ITIL,\n\n333\n00:19:58.174 --> 00:20:02.521\nis implementing these type of\nprocesses without the bureaucracy,\n\n334\n00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:07.859\nis making sure that we have the consistent\nmethods in place and we use the consistent\n\n335\n00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:12.480\nmethods but we don't use them in a way\nthat we try and trip ourselves up.\n\n336\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.500\nBecause that's where ITIL doesn't work in\nterms of efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n337\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.180\nIf we try and stick to our one size\nfits all approach that I just cut and\n\n338\n00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:27.590\npasted from the ITIL publications, then\nthat's simply not going to work, okay?\n\n339\n00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:32.530\nSo we will determine how we gather\nthe data depending on the scale of\n\n340\n00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.440\nthe improvement that we want to make.\n\n341\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.753\nDepending on our ways of working,\nour standard operating\n\n342\n00:20:37.753 --> 00:20:42.227\nprocedures within our organization and\nalso dependent on the vision as well.\n\n343\n00:20:42.227 --> 00:20:46.032\nAnd inputs into this could be\nthe new business requirements,\n\n344\n00:20:46.032 --> 00:20:47.788\nas we've already said, but\n\n345\n00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:53.455\nalso what we're currently capable of\ntaking in terms of metrics, as I've said.\n\n346\n00:20:53.455 --> 00:20:57.141\nThink about the investment that you\nwanted to make in your tools when\n\n347\n00:20:57.141 --> 00:20:59.610\nit comes to taking your measurements, etc.\n\n348\n00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:04.670\nAnd then what comes out is well,\nthe data itself.\n\n349\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:10.665\nAnd also a monitoring plan for how often\nwe're going to measure that data too.\n\n350\n00:21:10.665 --> 00:21:12.990\nThink about what you're measuring.\n\n351\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.580\nOn the right hand side,\nyou've got this Let's Talk icon.\n\n352\n00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.879\nWell, really,\nthat should really say, let's think.\n\n353\n00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:22.540\nThese are our topics to think about.\n\n354\n00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.719\nService monitoring,\nwell that focuses on services themselves.\n\n355\n00:21:28.719 --> 00:21:32.563\nWhereas, and that's part of\nour technology, for instance,\n\n356\n00:21:32.563 --> 00:21:34.240\nthat's technology data.\n\n357\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.220\nWell, service management,\nwell that looks at processes.\n\n358\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.900\nAnd that's part of our process data.\n\n359\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.720\nAnd we combine them both and\nwe get our end to end service data.\n\n360\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.465\nWhat that actually means is our\nend to end service is measured in\n\n361\n00:21:53.465 --> 00:21:58.490\nterms of how the components perform,\nso how our servers perform.\n\n362\n00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:59.690\nWhat about reliability?\n\n363\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.521\nWhat about the bandwidth on our networks,\netc.\n\n364\n00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:07.334\nThat's our technology data, but\nwe have to add also the incident\n\n365\n00:22:07.334 --> 00:22:13.240\nperformance into that as well in order\nto get the end to end service metrics.\n\n366\n00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.940\nBecause reliability will\ncome from the server.\n\n367\n00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:21.515\nFrom the server itself and we can\nfind out often that server has died.\n\n368\n00:22:21.515 --> 00:22:24.254\n[LAUGH] Hopefully not too often.\n\n369\n00:22:24.254 --> 00:22:27.930\nAnd we can find out therefore what\nthe availability of that server is.\n\n370\n00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.920\nBut incident management will tell\nus every time that server did die,\n\n371\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.170\nhow long it then took us\nto recover the server.\n\n372\n00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.689\nWhich might be slightly different to\nthe availability metrics within the actual\n\n373\n00:22:40.689 --> 00:22:41.880\ntechnology itself.\n\n374\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.425\nEspecially if there is mirroring\navailable to another server,\n\n375\n00:22:45.425 --> 00:22:48.520\nthen actually the service\nmight be recovered quicker.\n\n376\n00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:54.930\nSo we add them both together, both\nthe technology data and our incident data,\n\n377\n00:22:54.930 --> 00:23:00.080\nto be able to provide or\ndeliver our end to end service metrics.\n\n378\n00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.450\nSo of course we don't use the same\nmonitoring capabilities for\n\n379\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.865\nboth because we're monitoring\ntwo different things.\n\n380\n00:23:06.865 --> 00:23:11.374\nWe'll use our service management\ntool to help us manage incident and\n\n381\n00:23:11.374 --> 00:23:16.505\nproblem management, but we'll also use\nour event management tools to help us\n\n382\n00:23:16.505 --> 00:23:21.577\nwith our technology monitoring to help\nus with the data that we need in there.\n\n383\n00:23:23.449 --> 00:23:28.098\nSo we have to ensure that whatever\nwe gather, in terms of data,\n\n384\n00:23:28.098 --> 00:23:30.840\nis gathered in a consistent manner.\n\n385\n00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.070\nNow, in a previous session within\nCSI we talked about consistency and\n\n386\n00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:41.390\nabout it being completely invaluable in\nterms of efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n387\n00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.957\nSo we have to think about exactly\nwhat we're going to measure.\n\n388\n00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:48.356\nAnd what that data will look like,\n\n389\n00:23:48.356 --> 00:23:52.250\nbecause we want to have that\nconsistency in place here.\n\n390\n00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.088\nSo as we've said, in the last slide,\nwhen I talked about technology metrics.\n\n391\n00:23:58.088 --> 00:24:03.125\nSuch as how often that server dies and\nthen we'll combine that with the process\n\n392\n00:24:03.125 --> 00:24:07.478\nmetrics such as how quickly incident\nmanagement managed to restore\n\n393\n00:24:07.478 --> 00:24:12.316\nthe service to give us our end to end\nservice metrics as we see in front of us.\n\n394\n00:24:12.316 --> 00:24:16.816\nNow, the next thing that we\ndo once we have that data is\n\n395\n00:24:16.816 --> 00:24:20.480\nwe will start to process that data.\n\n396\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.840\nProcess that data,\nwill simply mean formatting that data.\n\n397\n00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.288\nLooking at the frequency.\n\n398\n00:24:28.288 --> 00:24:32.220\nDo we want to format in terms of\n\n399\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.238\nin the particular example that I gave\nyou about the service desk analysis.\n\n400\n00:24:36.238 --> 00:24:41.260\nDo we wanna format in terms of time\nof day, or maybe hour of day, or\n\n401\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:46.214\nmaybe day of week, maybe by analyst for\ninstance, or maybe by service.\n\n402\n00:24:46.214 --> 00:24:48.730\nOkay, it's entirely up to you.\n\n403\n00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.450\nOnly you understand how\nyour organization works.\n\n404\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.560\nAnd what's import to your organization.\n\n405\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.300\nSo the format in itself has to be aligned\nto the vision of the organization.\n\n406\n00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.260\nIt's not something that we can\njust do again on an ad hoc basis.\n\n407\n00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.779\nIt's going to be something\nthat ties in with the vision.\n\n408\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.120\nNow, we can look at automated processing,\n\n409\n00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.430\nwhich is really our ideal\nbecause that's more accurate.\n\n410\n00:25:16.499 --> 00:25:20.260\nBut let's face it, we need to have some\nmanual intervention in some of this.\n\n411\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.904\nAnd sometimes it's just a case of,\nwe have it in a spreadsheet and\n\n412\n00:25:23.904 --> 00:25:26.436\nwe've got format that spreadsheet, okay.\n\n413\n00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:30.630\nBeware of,\nit says here human errors, okay.\n\n414\n00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.880\nI hate to say this, but\nI'm going to say this anyway.\n\n415\n00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:41.304\nIf we have a vision in mind, and\nif we know that we are not performing\n\n416\n00:25:41.304 --> 00:25:47.726\nto the needs of the organization and\nour customer satisfaction is low.\n\n417\n00:25:47.726 --> 00:25:52.327\nAnd we know that we're taking data\nthat looks at the number of calls\n\n418\n00:25:52.327 --> 00:25:56.848\nwaiting in the queue,\nthat looks at incident resolution rates,\n\n419\n00:25:56.848 --> 00:26:01.800\nthat looks at how quickly somebody's\nactually resolving incidents.\n\n420\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.929\nAnd we're breaking that down by analysts.\n\n421\n00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.950\nIf I know that that's\nthe information that I'm taken,\n\n422\n00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.821\nam I going to give that information\nsay to Ronnie to process?\n\n423\n00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.860\nProbably not.\n\n424\n00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.620\nAnd that's no reflection on\nRonnie's analytical skills at all.\n\n425\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.780\nBut the fact is that this might\nhighlight the [LAUGH] fact that\n\n426\n00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.600\nhe needs more coffee in the morning,\nin which case that is going to influence\n\n427\n00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.950\nhow Ronnie then displays that data,\npotentially.\n\n428\n00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.210\nIt's not that I don't trust you Ronnie.\n\n429\n00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.650\nI love you with all my heart.\n\n430\n00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:39.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you [LAUGH].\n\n431\n00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:45.281\n&gt;&gt; But I still need to be 100%\nconfident in the integrity of the data.\n\n432\n00:26:45.281 --> 00:26:45.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n433\n00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.720\n&gt;&gt; And\nalso in the view on the data as well.\n\n434\n00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.510\nThis has got absolutely nothing to do\nnecessarily with the fact that you're\n\n435\n00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.117\ngonna change the information.\n\n436\n00:26:55.117 --> 00:26:58.211\nBut this has everything to do with\nthe fact that I need to see an impartial\n\n437\n00:26:58.211 --> 00:26:59.406\nview of that information.\n\n438\n00:26:59.406 --> 00:27:01.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n439\n00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.850\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's all part of processing the data.\n\n440\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.910\nWho's going to do the processing?\n\n441\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.440\nAnd processing the data sits within CSI.\n\n442\n00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:15.650\nAnd so we will probably give that to\nan independent CSI analyst to process.\n\n443\n00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:20.970\nNow, I mentioned the vision to metrics\ntree and that is looking at the next slide\n\n444\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:25.940\nhere and it's simply really boils\ndown to the fact that our vision and\n\n445\n00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.790\nour mission for\nour organization feeds into goals.\n\n446\n00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.892\nOkay, and so\nevery single goal that we have for\n\n447\n00:27:32.892 --> 00:27:39.090\neach individual business unit should feed\ndirectly into the mission and the vision.\n\n448\n00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.760\nOur vision and our mission, by the way,\n\n449\n00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.560\nare quite often combined\nwithin any organization.\n\n450\n00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:51.050\nAnd they, in turn, there's always goals so\nfor each individual goal they in turn will\n\n451\n00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:57.730\nthen feed into objectives for a particular\nteam or for a particular department.\n\n452\n00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.400\nAnd those objectives\nwill feed into CSFs which\n\n453\n00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.920\nwill feed into KPIs which\nwill feed into metrics.\n\n454\n00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.680\nIt should look like a tree root.\n\n455\n00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.230\nThat's exactly what it should look like.\n\n456\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.310\nWe will have one vision and\nthat one vision and\n\n457\n00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:16.710\nmission will feed down into maybe three or\nfour goals for the organization.\n\n458\n00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:21.641\nEach one of those goals will\nfeed down into three, four,\n\n459\n00:28:21.641 --> 00:28:28.838\nmaybe five objectives for each individual\nbusiness unit, each individual team,\n\n460\n00:28:28.838 --> 00:28:34.419\nand each objective will feed into three or\nfour potential CSFs.\n\n461\n00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:39.082\nAnd each critical success factor\nthat's something that we have to\n\n462\n00:28:39.082 --> 00:28:41.170\nachieve will feed into KPIs.\n\n463\n00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.268\nThey will define those KPIs.\n\n464\n00:28:44.268 --> 00:28:46.546\nAnd we should have at least\ntwo to three KPIs per CSF.\n\n465\n00:28:46.546 --> 00:28:50.761\nAnd that, in turn, will tell us\nwhat metrics we need to take and\n\n466\n00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:56.210\nof course, the measurements are what\nwe actually physically take.\n\n467\n00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.220\nAnd the idea being that if\nwe take our measurements and\n\n468\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.770\nthey will tell us whether we\nare recording the right metrics.\n\n469\n00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:08.990\nThose metrics will tell us whether each\nindividual KPI is being achieved and\n\n470\n00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:12.050\nif each individual KPI is being achieved,\n\n471\n00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:17.000\nif all of them is being achieved\nthen that CSF is therefore achieved.\n\n472\n00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.970\nIf we're achieving all of our CSFs,\n\n473\n00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.110\nthen that objective is\ntherefore being achieved.\n\n474\n00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.370\nAnd if we're achieving all of our\nobjectives for a specific goal,\n\n475\n00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.710\nthen that goal is being achieved.\n\n476\n00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:33.250\nAnd so this is what we call our vision\nto metric trick in that all of our\n\n477\n00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:38.360\nmetrics should link\ndirectly into our vision.\n\n478\n00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:46.434\nSo in terms of processing the data, yet\nagain, very similar to the last step.\n\n479\n00:29:46.434 --> 00:29:50.156\nWe have a template, a framework for\n\n480\n00:29:50.156 --> 00:29:55.865\nhow we might process data\ndepending on the improvement\n\n481\n00:29:55.865 --> 00:30:01.330\ninitiative that we\nare trying to embark on.\n\n482\n00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:06.440\nSo the framework might look\nalong the lines of defining\n\n483\n00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.850\nyour requirements, defining your\nfrequency, defining the format, etc.\n\n484\n00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:15.820\nThis is a framework you will decide on\n\n485\n00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.280\nexactly how you are going\nto process the data.\n\n486\n00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.940\nThat is entirely up to you depending on\n\n487\n00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.890\nimprovement initiative\nthat you want to make.\n\n488\n00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.960\nWhat our inputs are into this\nparticular step is all of that\n\n489\n00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.620\ndata that we've accumulated.\n\n490\n00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.140\nAll of that data that we\ngathered in step three.\n\n491\n00:30:36.165 --> 00:30:39.330\nAnd what comes out, well,\n\n492\n00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:44.510\nthat's the process data that we then\nstart to analyze in our next step,\n\n493\n00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.870\nas it says there, groupings of data,\nlogical groupings of data.\n\n494\n00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.880\nAnd in our next step,\n\n495\n00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:55.420\nwe go on to look at analysis techniques\nand how we might analyze that data.\n\n496\n00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.700\nSo for this particular session,\nwe're just gonna take a break.\n\n497\n00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.980\nAnd at this point in time,\nwhat I really need everybody to do, is to\n\n498\n00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.680\njust go back over the first four steps of\nour seven step improvement process, and\n\n499\n00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.410\njust make sure you are familiar with that.\n\n500\n00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:16.700\nAnd in our next session, we are going to\nmove on from steps five through to seven,\n\n501\n00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.250\nand then, again,\n\n502\n00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:23.290\nback to step number one again because\nthis is a continual improvement process.\n\n503\n00:31:24.458 --> 00:31:28.790\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us to dive a bit deeper into,\n\n504\n00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:31.300\nof course, these seven steps that\n\n505\n00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.970\nwill help us to continue that cycle\nof improvement that we need to.\n\n506\n00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.160\nRemember to take a look at that and\n\n507\n00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.100\nmake sure that those are, kind of really\ninternalized into your study as well.\n\n508\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.012\nAnd that will help you to proceed on.\n\n509\n00:31:44.012 --> 00:31:46.200\nAll right, well that's a great place for\nus to also end this up.\n\n510\n00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.870\nSo then, signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n511\n00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:52.110\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n512\n00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:56.764\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the ITIL intermediate CSI

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:14.690\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.850\nYou're watching the ITIL\nintermediate CSI show.\n\n5\n00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.750\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n6\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.920\nwe're jumping into a part three on\nthe seven-step improvement process.\n\n7\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.930\nAnd here to help us,\nof course, is gonna be, well,\n\n8\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.010\nour ITIL commissar herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.012\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:33.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you very much for\n\n11\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.630\nhaving me, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.720\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n13\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.754\nNow, Jo, we've already been taking\na look at a deep dive here,\n\n14\n00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:42.730\non some of these different processes.\n\n15\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.920\nWe've gone through the first four steps.\n\n16\n00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.640\nSo we are now ready to actually\njump into the last few.\n\n17\n00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.583\nJo, where are we going to begin now?\n\n18\n00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:54.334\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nWell, let's just take a quick recap as to\n\n19\n00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:57.649\nwhat the seven-step improvement\nprocess is all about, and\n\n20\n00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.750\nthat should be on your screen right now.\n\n21\n00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.870\nAnd you will see that we start off with\nidentifying what it is we want to improve.\n\n22\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.290\nAnd we started off in the last\ntwo sessions actually looking at\n\n23\n00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.430\nthe challenge with the service desk.\n\n24\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.540\nWe're not actually achieving what\nour organization thinks we should be\n\n25\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.540\nachieving, or at least they're not happy.\n\n26\n00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.560\nSo, then we defined what we were going to\nmeasure, and of course in the previous\n\n27\n00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.530\nsession we looked more in-depth at\nactually the realities behind that.\n\n28\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.280\nAnd it's not just about what\nmeasurements we can take, but\n\n29\n00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.630\nmaking sure that they're aligned\nwith the organization's vision.\n\n30\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.050\nAnd it's not just about the fact that\nour customer satisfaction ratings aren't\n\n31\n00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.910\nvery high, but we have to think about\nthe direction of the organization too.\n\n32\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.990\nAnd the simple fact that those two\nobjectives might actually be conflicting.\n\n33\n00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.840\nAnd then we went out, and we gathered\nthe data, and we looked at the type of\n\n34\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.750\ntools etc that we would use in gathering\nin the data, and then we processed it.\n\n35\n00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.770\nAnd now, here we are, in step five,\nwhere we are actually analyzing the data.\n\n36\n00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.480\nWithout analysis,\nit says here we have information.\n\n37\n00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.920\nBut with analysis we have knowledge.\n\n38\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.010\nIn other words, if we don't do anything\nwith that data that we've got, we've added\n\n39\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.420\nin the relationship, so we've processed\nthe data, and that gives us information.\n\n40\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.420\nIt tells us something.\n\n41\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.750\nBut if we don't do anything with that\ndata, then it's just, well, taking data\n\n42\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.760\nfor the sake of taking data, and reports\njust for the sake of having reports.\n\n43\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.290\nWell, they're a waste of time and\n\n44\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.170\nthey certainly are not going\nto be efficient, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.300\nAnd they are not going to lead us to be\nefficient and effective in delivering\n\n46\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.920\nour services, or rather delivering\nvalue and facilitating those outcomes.\n\n47\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.246\nSo the kind of questions that we\nmight want to ask are things around,\n\n48\n00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:47.300\nsay, trending, for instance.\n\n49\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.540\nAre these good trends or\nbad trends, positive or negative?\n\n50\n00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.690\nAre we heading in a downward slope or\nan upward trend?\n\n51\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.020\nAre we meeting the needs of\nthe organisation that we've defined in\n\n52\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.210\nthe SLA?\n\n53\n00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.230\nYou know,\nis everything running according to plan?\n\n54\n00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.470\nThat can be a little bit\nof an ambiguous one,\n\n55\n00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.770\nwhat does running according to plan mean?\n\n56\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.769\nWell, only you know that\nanswer to that one.\n\n57\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.210\nNow, I mentioned that in the last session,\nwhen we looked at step four,\n\n58\n00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.190\nthat you are going to process\nthe data based on your organization.\n\n59\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.340\nYou're gonna have your own methods,\nyour own techniques.\n\n60\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.300\nBut you're also going to do that based on\nwhat the vision for this improvement is.\n\n61\n00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.220\nAnd so we analyze the data, understanding\nthe vision for the improvement.\n\n62\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.930\nWe don't just need to\nanalyze it in terms of trends\n\n63\n00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.890\nif we're not interested in trends.\n\n64\n00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.480\nIf what we're interested in is, say, well,\n\n65\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.450\nimproving customer satisfaction,\ndo we need to look at trends?\n\n66\n00:03:47.848 --> 00:03:51.270\nBearing in mind that in the last\ntwo sessions, part one and\n\n67\n00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.490\npart two, we've looked at, you know,\nthe ability to answer the telephone.\n\n68\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.380\nBut then I've also mentioned\nthat the organizational\n\n69\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.340\ndirection is to move away\nfrom answering the telephone.\n\n70\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.860\nSo if the trend's showing us that the\nnumber of telephone calls, well, actually\n\n71\n00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.830\nthe number of telephone calls that\nare waiting in the queue is increasing.\n\n72\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.710\nBut the number of telephone calls coming\ninto the service desk is decreasing,\n\n73\n00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.090\nis that valuable information to us?\n\n74\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.230\nYou could argue, well, yes,\n\n75\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.320\nit is, because it shows us that\nour vision is actually working.\n\n76\n00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.520\nBut no, it isn't,\nbecause people are still waiting.\n\n77\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.920\nNow, I've heard things.\n\n78\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.210\nI've heard people say to me, well,\nyeah, but we want them to wait,\n\n79\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.790\nbecause then hopefully, that will prompt\nthem to actually get their app out.\n\n80\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.680\nOr maybe it'll prompt them to email you,\nbut that's not, let's face it,\n\n81\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.110\nthat is not a best practice in\nterms of the business environment.\n\n82\n00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.710\nWe don't want people to wait.\n\n83\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.500\nThat is going to cause them to be unhappy.\n\n84\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.210\nHowever we analyze the data,\nthe fact of the matter is,\n\n85\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.534\nwe have to analyze the data in order\nto be able to make a decision from it.\n\n86\n00:04:57.534 --> 00:05:02.360\nAnd only you will understand what\nyou want to do with that data, and\n\n87\n00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.300\nwhat decisions you want to make.\n\n88\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.740\nAnd therefore only you will\nunderstand how you analyze that data.\n\n89\n00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.670\nAnd of course, it has to be aligned\nwith the vision for that improvement.\n\n90\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.320\nSo then we present the information, and\nwe always say that we present this by way\n\n91\n00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.230\nof a nice pretty picture,\ngenerally it's by way of a graph.\n\n92\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.330\nSo action plans, reporting.\n\n93\n00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.180\nI expect to see lots of graphs in this\nparticular section here in this step.\n\n94\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.590\nWe might be reporting on an exception.\n\n95\n00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.130\nWe might be reporting for trends.\n\n96\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.480\nWe might be reporting on benefits, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.549\nThink about who our audience is.\n\n98\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.500\nI'm gonna ask you a question Ronnie, and\nit's something that I talk about a lot\n\n99\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.790\nthroughout ITIL, because it's really,\nreally, important.\n\n100\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.500\nBut I'm gonna ask you a question.\n\n101\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.450\nSo if I am sending a report to somebody,\nwhat language,\n\n102\n00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.400\nthen, do you think that\nreport should be in?\n\n103\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.988\n&gt;&gt; What language should it be.\n\n104\n00:06:04.988 --> 00:06:09.747\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It should be in a language that they\n\n105\n00:06:09.747 --> 00:06:11.370\nunderstand.\n\n106\n00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.120\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, the first,\nthe first response,\n\n107\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.280\nI always get to this, is English.\n\n108\n00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.150\nWell, that's great, okay, but\nif they don't understand English,\n\n109\n00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.640\nthen that's not going to help.\n\n110\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.760\nAnd I mean, let's face it,\n\n111\n00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.620\nthere's a different version of\nEnglish here to the one that I speak.\n\n112\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n113\n00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nWhich is completely\n\n114\n00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.360\ndifferent to the one that you speak.\n\n115\n00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.405\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; As well, right?\n\n116\n00:06:30.405 --> 00:06:32.350\n[LAUGH] We both use different words.\n\n117\n00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.370\nThe key is that it should be in\nthe language of the audience, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.865\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Whoever you're reporting to,\n\n119\n00:06:36.865 --> 00:06:42.380\nthat's whose language you\nneed to be reporting in.\n\n120\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.670\nWhy does that make any difference?\n\n121\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.840\nWell, think about our audiences\nthat we've got labelled there.\n\n122\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.470\nYou've got customer language.\n\n123\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.120\nCustomers are interested in whether it's\neffective and whether it's efficient.\n\n124\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.350\nSo they are interested in whether we're\nmeeting these agreed targets that we\n\n125\n00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.940\nhave with them.\n\n126\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.060\nSenior management,\nwhat are they interested in?\n\n127\n00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.630\nWell, senior management, they want\nto see what we're doing about it.\n\n128\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.880\nIf we're presenting them with any graph or\nany report, the first question\n\n129\n00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.160\nthat comes out of their mind is, what is\nthis telling me, and what do I need to do?\n\n130\n00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.800\nThat's what they want to know.\n\n131\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.900\nInternal IT, I expect that to\nbe in a technical language.\n\n132\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.650\nThey want to see the nuts and bolts.\n\n133\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.790\nThey want to see exactly\nwhere the challenge is.\n\n134\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.290\nThey want to see\nthe individual pieces of data.\n\n135\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.760\nThey want a breakdown.\n\n136\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.490\nThey want the analysis.\n\n137\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.790\nOur suppliers.\n\n138\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.320\nWell, we have a contract with them.\n\n139\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.280\nA legally binding contract.\n\n140\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.819\nSo they want to know what changes\nthere needs to be to that contract.\n\n141\n00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:48.950\nCuz if we're changing a contract, if\nthey're on the performing on the contract,\n\n142\n00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.859\nfor instance, if they need to make\nchanges, then don't forget we're talking\n\n143\n00:07:53.859 --> 00:07:58.795\nlegally binding here, so we have to\nensure that we manage this appropriately.\n\n144\n00:07:58.795 --> 00:08:06.702\nTake a look at the little icon there that\nsays Let's Talk and let's have a think.\n\n145\n00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:08.808\nAs I say, let's think about this.\n\n146\n00:08:08.808 --> 00:08:14.312\nThe business isn't interested\nin that 99% availability.\n\n147\n00:08:14.312 --> 00:08:19.021\nThey're not interested in how\navailable a service is they\n\n148\n00:08:19.021 --> 00:08:22.970\nare interested in how\nunavailable a service is.\n\n149\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.710\nI'm gonna a show you a SLAM chart.\n\n150\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.190\nThis is a Service Level\nAgreement Monitoring chart.\n\n151\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.614\nWe normally call this a RAG chart.\n\n152\n00:08:31.614 --> 00:08:35.280\nNow RAG chart means Red,\nAmber, Green okay.\n\n153\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.060\nWhich are traffic lights.\n\n154\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.956\nWell actually they're traffic lights for\nme okay.\n\n155\n00:08:38.956 --> 00:08:42.046\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the states they call it yellow.\n\n156\n00:08:42.046 --> 00:08:42.976\n&gt;&gt; Yellow.\n\n157\n00:08:42.976 --> 00:08:43.998\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,.\n\n158\n00:08:43.998 --> 00:08:46.242\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's not go there,\n\n159\n00:08:46.242 --> 00:08:48.690\nwe're talking about language,\nlet's not go there, okay.\n\n160\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.622\nBecause RUG chart doesn't\nsound quite right, does it?\n\n161\n00:08:51.622 --> 00:08:54.479\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll stick with RAG, okay, red,\n\n162\n00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:55.990\namber, green.\n\n163\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.505\nUnfortunately, this one is in black and\nwhite.\n\n164\n00:08:57.505 --> 00:08:58.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.030\n&gt;&gt; So we're looking at gray,\n\n166\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.350\ngray, and gray.\n\n167\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.410\nNo, with a bit of white\nthrown in there too.\n\n168\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.086\nI'm not interested.\n\n169\n00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.630\nIf I see your RAG chart.\n\n170\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.160\nNow, normally that white\nwould be displayed green.\n\n171\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.458\nI'm not interested in where\nI'm meeting my targets.\n\n172\n00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:16.906\nI'm interested in the amber,\nor the orange, or\n\n173\n00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:18.888\nthe yellow whatever you wanna call it.\n\n174\n00:09:18.888 --> 00:09:20.050\nI'm interested in the red.\n\n175\n00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.970\nI'm interested in where we threaten\nthe target, in other words,\n\n176\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.512\nwhen we nearly breached.\n\n177\n00:09:25.512 --> 00:09:28.282\nAnd I'm interested in where\nwe did actually breach.\n\n178\n00:09:28.282 --> 00:09:30.310\nThat's what I'm interested in.\n\n179\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.248\nThese are my areas for improvement.\n\n180\n00:09:33.248 --> 00:09:36.440\nThese are my opportunities for\nimprovement.\n\n181\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.509\nIf you show me a SLAM\nchart that is all green\n\n182\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.190\nI will challenge anybody to show me to\nshow me a green RUG chart and I will\n\n183\n00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:49.790\ngo up to your customers and I will ask\nthem if they are happy with the service.\n\n184\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.760\nAnd I will guarantee that your customers,\nat least one of them, will come back and\n\n185\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.640\nsay, well, actually,\nthings would be better if.\n\n186\n00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.560\nBecause you see, they're not interested\nin the fact that everything is\n\n187\n00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.040\nmeeting the availability targets.\n\n188\n00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.290\nThe only thing they remember\nis that one time it failed.\n\n189\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.476\nYou see you never log on to your\nPC first thing on the morning,\n\n190\n00:10:15.476 --> 00:10:20.238\non a Monday morning, and\nthink to yourself, hey this is fantastic,\n\n191\n00:10:20.238 --> 00:10:25.930\neverything is available and everything\nis working great, isn't it fantastic.\n\n192\n00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.444\nNo.\nYou log on to your PC on a Monday morning\n\n193\n00:10:29.444 --> 00:10:31.763\nand you look at it and\nyou go, my goodness,\n\n194\n00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:34.950\nsomething is not working,\nwhat am I going to do about this?\n\n195\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:41.320\nBecause you never notice when\nsomething's available, it's expected.\n\n196\n00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.106\nYou only notice when it's not available.\n\n197\n00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:48.615\nSo your customers and\nyour end users are not looking for\n\n198\n00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:52.816\navailability targets,\nthey're looking for unavailability.\n\n199\n00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:56.834\nThey're looking at when something\nis not meeting their expectation.\n\n200\n00:10:56.834 --> 00:10:59.894\nSo when we talk about\npresenting information,\n\n201\n00:10:59.894 --> 00:11:04.270\nonly show people the information\nthat's important to them.\n\n202\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:09.100\nIf you show a customer a SLAM chart that's\nall green, they won't believe you, and\n\n203\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.209\nthey won't care.\n\n204\n00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:14.317\nCuz what they actually wanted to see is\nwhat you're doing about the time when\n\n205\n00:11:14.317 --> 00:11:15.610\nsomething went wrong.\n\n206\n00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.098\nIt's really tempting to look at\nan all green SLAM chart within IT and\n\n207\n00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:22.314\nto say that's great.\n\n208\n00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:24.690\nEverything's working\nexactly as it should be.\n\n209\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.030\nWe're meeting all of our\nservice level targets, and\n\n210\n00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.370\ntherefore we're going to show them that\ngreen SLAM chart, that green RAG chart,\n\n211\n00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.439\nand we're gonna say,\nhey everything's working great.\n\n212\n00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.900\nAnd as I've said before I will challenge\nyou that there're always is an area for\n\n213\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.842\nopportunity.\n\n214\n00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:44.603\nSo we should always think about when we\nare presenting information we should think\n\n215\n00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:46.820\nabout what the audience wants to see.\n\n216\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.020\nYour customer doesn't want to\nsee an all green SLAM chart.\n\n217\n00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:55.287\nWhat they actually want to see Is where\nyour next improvement opportunity is.\n\n218\n00:11:55.287 --> 00:11:58.943\nSo, even if you're presented them\nwith an all agreen SLAM chart,\n\n219\n00:11:58.943 --> 00:12:02.970\nbecause you have met all of\nyour service level targets.\n\n220\n00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.843\nThen I would suggest you should also be\npresenting something underneath that,\n\n221\n00:12:06.843 --> 00:12:10.080\nthat says okay, we've highlighted\nthis area for opportunity and\n\n222\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.954\nthat's what we're going to do next.\n\n223\n00:12:11.954 --> 00:12:16.755\nOr maybe even we ascertained that our\nservice level targets are really not\n\n224\n00:12:16.755 --> 00:12:18.080\nquite high enough.\n\n225\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.708\nBecause we'd like to highlight areas for\nimprovement.\n\n226\n00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:26.980\nSo therefore we'd like you to amend to\nagree with us to amend the service level\n\n227\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.580\ntargets.\n\n228\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.388\nSo that it can actually show us\nopportunities or improvement.\n\n229\n00:12:31.388 --> 00:12:36.519\nAn all green SLAM chart is not\nsomething that we would expect to see\n\n230\n00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:42.598\non a regular basis, even though in IT,\nwe'd really, really like to see it.\n\n231\n00:12:42.598 --> 00:12:46.160\nIt doesn't really tell us much about\nour delivery of value perception.\n\n232\n00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.915\nSo when we're presenting any information.\n\n233\n00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:52.500\nThen, think about how we're presenting it.\n\n234\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.550\nThink about who we're presenting it to.\n\n235\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.050\nAre they actually going to\nbelieve what's being presented?\n\n236\n00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.690\nThat's the first challenge.\n\n237\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.630\nIf it's all green, then probably not.\n\n238\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.740\nBut, also, think about what's in it for\nthat audience.\n\n239\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.630\nAnswer the question, what's in it for me?\n\n240\n00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.376\nWhat do they need to know from that?\n\n241\n00:13:09.376 --> 00:13:13.240\nOr more importantly what decision\ndo they need they need to make.\n\n242\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.966\nIf I am presenting a chart of\na graph to a senior IT manager,\n\n243\n00:13:17.966 --> 00:13:21.450\nwhat decision am I expecting them to make?\n\n244\n00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.140\nBecause I've got to present it to them for\na reason.\n\n245\n00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:30.500\nSo underneath that particular graph I need\nto not only highlight whatever it is that\n\n246\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.850\nI'm showing, but I also need to\nhighlight what my recommendation is.\n\n247\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.376\nWhat needs to happen.\n\n248\n00:13:39.376 --> 00:13:42.525\nIf I'm not putting that at\nthe bottom of my graph then I have\n\n249\n00:13:42.525 --> 00:13:45.990\nto ask the question is that\ngraph really necessary?\n\n250\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.360\nBecause we've got to be able to\nmake in informed decision, and\n\n251\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.430\nif you're presenting it to IT senior\nmanagement it's probably because you\n\n252\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.417\neither want them to make a decision.\n\n253\n00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:59.408\nOr you need their endorsement\nbecause you've made the decision and\n\n254\n00:13:59.408 --> 00:14:03.270\nyou need them to endorse or\nto concur with that decision.\n\n255\n00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.129\nIn which case,\nthen put that at the bottom of the graph.\n\n256\n00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:10.720\nThat's exactly what needs\nto be there in the key.\n\n257\n00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.995\nBecause you see, you cannot implement\nany improvement unless you know what\n\n258\n00:14:14.995 --> 00:14:17.686\nthe improvement is that\nyou want to implement.\n\n259\n00:14:17.686 --> 00:14:21.378\nSo the graphs that you present and\nthe pretty pictures as we've said that you\n\n260\n00:14:21.378 --> 00:14:25.360\npresent, well, you have to know what the\nintention of what the intention of those\n\n261\n00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.190\npretty pictures are, in order to be\nable to then implement that improvement.\n\n262\n00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.522\nSo we use all of that knowledge, and that\nenables us to make that informed decision.\n\n263\n00:14:35.522 --> 00:14:41.750\nNow improvement opportunities should\nthen be listed in our CSI register.\n\n264\n00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.740\nI mentioned in the previous session,\nthe CSI register can be something very,\n\n265\n00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.900\nvery simple.\n\n266\n00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.270\nLike a spreadsheet or\n\n267\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:53.860\nit can be a database depend on the scale\nof the organization and how mature.\n\n268\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.412\nHow well developed CSIA is\nwithin the organization.\n\n269\n00:14:57.412 --> 00:14:59.336\nIt should be listed, and\n\n270\n00:14:59.336 --> 00:15:04.831\nthen we shouldn't prioritize that\nimprovement initiative based on,\n\n271\n00:15:04.831 --> 00:15:10.800\nboth impact to the organization and\nimpact to IT and also the urgency as well.\n\n272\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.585\nBearing in mind that whatever\nchanges we want to make and\n\n273\n00:15:13.585 --> 00:15:17.437\nif we are improving the service desk,\nand lets say for instance, that we know\n\n274\n00:15:17.437 --> 00:15:22.060\nthat Ronnie is not particularly hot as we\nmentioned first thing on a Monday morning.\n\n275\n00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.961\nThen the improvement might mean just\nsimply to bring in more coffee okay right.\n\n276\n00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.338\nWell there shouldn't be any training or\nany documentation involved in that but\n\n277\n00:15:30.338 --> 00:15:34.420\nsomebody needs to understand that Ronnie\nneeds more caffeine on a morning.\n\n278\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.409\nOr the improvement initiative might be\nto change the shift rotors around in\n\n279\n00:15:38.409 --> 00:15:42.791\nthe service desk, in which case then yes,\nyou need communication and training.\n\n280\n00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:46.760\nBut not only that you need buy in too.\n\n281\n00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.474\nBecause if people aren't brought\nin to any improvement initiative,\n\n282\n00:15:49.474 --> 00:15:51.318\nand we'll talk about\nthis in another section.\n\n283\n00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:54.307\nBut if people aren't brought in for\nan improvement initiative,\n\n284\n00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:56.931\nthen that improvement\ninitiative isn't going to work.\n\n285\n00:15:56.931 --> 00:16:01.292\nSo, effective communication is\ngoing to be really, really key.\n\n286\n00:16:01.292 --> 00:16:06.563\nThink about, and here we talk\nabout language of interest, but\n\n287\n00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:14.090\nthink about on what level your improvement\ninitiative needs to be implemented.\n\n288\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.240\nSo, does it need to be implemented\nin the bottom left hand\n\n289\n00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.260\ncorner there at operational level or\n\n290\n00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.330\ndoes it need to be implemented in\nthe top right hand corner there.\n\n291\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.150\nA sort of first level, as we call it\nwhich is within the organization.\n\n292\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:32.380\nAny improvement initiatives that we\nimplemented operational level should\n\n293\n00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.460\nimprove at the very top level\nbecause that's what we want to do.\n\n294\n00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.820\nRemember that vision to metrics tree that\nwe looked at in the previous sections.\n\n295\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:49.800\nEverything should feed\nup to the next layer up.\n\n296\n00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.730\nWhether those KPIs feed into\nour CSFs that tell us whether\n\n297\n00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.090\nwe're achieving that critical success\nfactor, which feed into our objectives,\n\n298\n00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:02.520\nwhich feed into our goals and\nthen our vision and our mission, etc.\n\n299\n00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:08.963\nWell, every single improvement should\nhave a direct link up to our vision.\n\n300\n00:17:08.963 --> 00:17:10.041\nAnd therefore,\n\n301\n00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:15.835\nevery single improvement we make should\nbe seen at each consecutive level.\n\n302\n00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:18.028\nBut the same is true reversely too and\n\n303\n00:17:18.028 --> 00:17:22.840\nany improvement that's made here right at\nthe very top in what we call business,\n\n304\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.834\nthe first level manager\nshould be filtered down.\n\n305\n00:17:25.834 --> 00:17:31.482\nAnd we should be able to see that\nat operational level as well.\n\n306\n00:17:31.482 --> 00:17:37.090\nSo CSI continual,\nnot continuous, continual.\n\n307\n00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.130\nAs we mentioned right at the very\nintroduction to continual service\n\n308\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.530\nimprovement, it's about intuitive,\nongoing improvement.\n\n309\n00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.500\nThis is not just a one off activity.\n\n310\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:52.190\nAnd if we think about our\nCSI seven step improvement\n\n311\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:56.670\nprocess, it kind of ends with\nnumber seven, doesn't it?\n\n312\n00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:01.600\nNo it doesn't, that arrow carries back\naround to looking at the vision again.\n\n313\n00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.810\nAnd we look at the vision, and\nwe look at the mission and again,\n\n314\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:09.390\nwe go back to identifying further\nimprovement opportunities, okay.\n\n315\n00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.625\nSo improvement should be as it says here,\n\n316\n00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:19.030\nincremental okay, but they're not ad hoc.\n\n317\n00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.460\nThey shouldn't be ad hoc.\n\n318\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.150\nIt should be iterative.\n\n319\n00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.202\nIt should be repeatable, okay.\n\n320\n00:18:24.202 --> 00:18:28.345\nCSI is something that should be\npart of every single process and\n\n321\n00:18:28.345 --> 00:18:30.510\nevery single service.\n\n322\n00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.090\nAnd the sense that improvement\nprocess is just a technique\n\n323\n00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.130\nthat we will use to\nimplement improvements and\n\n324\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.977\nto actually identify specific areas for\nimprovement, okay.\n\n325\n00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.820\nSo let's take a look then at our triggers,\nand for\n\n326\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.199\nthe seven step improvement process.\n\n327\n00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.310\nAnd our triggers to any\nimprovement initiative.\n\n328\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.850\nWell, they could be started\noff by our organization.\n\n329\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:01.420\nAnd our organization will tell us\nwhether they are changing direction.\n\n330\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.870\nAny change to the vision\nof the organization\n\n331\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.460\nis a change that we will\nneed to accommodate and\n\n332\n00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:13.947\nthat we will need to adopt within our\nIT service provider organization, okay.\n\n333\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.270\nSo triggers could be a change\nin business requirement.\n\n334\n00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.097\nThat's gonna come in from our business\nrelationship management, by the way, okay.\n\n335\n00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:27.010\nThat's not going to come in because\nthere's been a huge major announcement.\n\n336\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.710\nThat should come in way before\nthe major announcement, and\n\n337\n00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.626\nthat should come in via business\nrelationship management, okay.\n\n338\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.287\nOther triggers to the seven step\nimprovement process include the example I\n\n339\n00:19:38.287 --> 00:19:41.656\ngave you, such as low customer\nsatisfaction scores, okay.\n\n340\n00:19:41.656 --> 00:19:45.760\nOr customer complaints,\nas well as maybe incentivizing staff or\n\n341\n00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.550\nmaybe just something that is on the CSI\nregister as an area we need to look at.\n\n342\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.750\nSo, all of the inputs that we've got\nlisted here, are all going to help us not\n\n343\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:02.480\nonly identify areas for improvement or\nopportunities for improvement,\n\n344\n00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:08.200\nthey're also going to help us\nwith gathering the data, as well.\n\n345\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.831\nBecause if we look at service level\nrequirements and service level catalog.\n\n346\n00:20:12.831 --> 00:20:17.248\nAnd we look at some of our technology\nexception, supply information,\n\n347\n00:20:17.248 --> 00:20:19.540\nthat's all part of data gathering.\n\n348\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.110\nThat's all part of the information\nwe want to pull in.\n\n349\n00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.422\nSo, all of these can not\nonly be triggers but\n\n350\n00:20:26.422 --> 00:20:29.698\nthey can also be inputs\ninto the process too.\n\n351\n00:20:29.698 --> 00:20:35.308\nAnd then of course our output, our output\nruns into our improvement data itself,\n\n352\n00:20:35.308 --> 00:20:40.840\nthat's the initiative, and that is\nalso the project plan for improving.\n\n353\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.530\nBear it in mind that step number\nseven in that CSI process,\n\n354\n00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:50.580\nwell that might not\nnecessarily be a small step.\n\n355\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:55.101\nOkay, that could be an improvement\ninitiative that could require a project to\n\n356\n00:20:55.101 --> 00:20:56.190\nimplement.\n\n357\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:01.360\nIt could be a project or improvement\ninitiative that lasts for an entire year.\n\n358\n00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.210\nIt's not necessarily something that's\njust going to be very small but\n\n359\n00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.460\nchanging the shift routers on\nthe service desk for instance.\n\n360\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:15.630\nSo at this point in time, we've now looked\nat our seven step improvement process.\n\n361\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.480\nAnd what we're going to look\nat in our next session,\n\n362\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.100\nwhich will be our fourth part to the seven\nstep improvement process, is we're gonna\n\n363\n00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.850\nlook at the input from other life cycle\nphases and from other processes as well.\n\n364\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.840\nSo we're going to look at what say\nbusiness relationship management can do\n\n365\n00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.930\nfor us and what service level\nmanagement can do for us.\n\n366\n00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.340\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nthat over the next session so\n\n367\n00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.860\nwhat I'd like you to do right now is just\nto take a look back over this session and\n\n368\n00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.500\nthe previous two sessions.\n\n369\n00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.960\nFamiliarize yourself\nwith those seven steps.\n\n370\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.220\nBecause that's going to help us as we\nmove forward into the next session,\n\n371\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.020\nwhere we look at where\nwe get our data from.\n\n372\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\n\n373\n00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:02.190\nhelping us to round out our deep dive\ninto these seven steps just a little bit.\n\n374\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.640\nWe're not completely done yet,\nas Jo has been saying.\n\n375\n00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.780\nWe've still got at least\none more process or\n\n376\n00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.470\none more step that we need\nto take a look at as well.\n\n377\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:14.660\nBut in this episode you take a look at\nsome of the analysis that we had to do\n\n378\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.070\nas well as presenting and\n\n379\n00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:20.310\neven the idea here of implementing\nthe improvements that need to be done.\n\n380\n00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.820\nSo remember that and there's actually more\nto come, so this is a great place for\n\n381\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.190\nus to end this episode.\n\n382\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.530\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong\n\n383\n00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.700\n&gt;&gt; and I'm Jo

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.310\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.950\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.610\nAnd we are now actually\ngoing to be taking a look\n\n9\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.500\nat finishing up the seven step\ncontinual improvement process.\n\n10\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.890\nAnd here to help us out and round out our\nparticular knowledge and skills in this,\n\n11\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.680\nis going to be, well,\nthe macado herself in ITIL, Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.020\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.950\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.870\nHow are you?\n\n15\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.650\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n16\n00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.100\nNow, Jo, we've spent a lot of time\nin diving into the seven steps, and\n\n17\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.150\nin our previous episode we actually\nfinished those seven steps, but\n\n18\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.462\nwe're still in a part\nfour on the seven steps.\n\n19\n00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:56.940\nSo, Jo, I don't know but\nthat sounds like at least eight to me.\n\n20\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No,\n\n21\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.590\nwhat we're actually doing right now is if\nwe take a look at the seven step process\n\n22\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.170\nitself, you can see all of these steps,\nwe have to get our input from somewhere.\n\n23\n00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.580\nAnd so what we're going to do\nin this particular session is,\n\n24\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.800\nwe're just going to look at the other\nprocesses in the other life cycle phases.\n\n25\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.190\nAnd we're just going to really ask\nthe question, how do they contribute\n\n26\n00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.580\nto all of these steps that you\nsee in front of you right now?\n\n27\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.560\nSo how do they contribute to\nidentifying the strategy?\n\n28\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.590\nHow do they contribute towards\ndefining what we're going to measure?\n\n29\n00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.560\nAnd then gathering the data, etc.\n\n30\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.230\nOkay, so what we're really gonna do is\njust look at the interfaces between\n\n31\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.120\nall of our other lifecycle phases and\nall of our other processes.\n\n32\n00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.940\nBecause you see if we take\na look at this right now and\n\n33\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.690\nlook at these other four lifecycle phases,\nbecause obviously CSI is the fifth.\n\n34\n00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.060\nIn service strategy, well, that's where\nwe define all of our policies and\n\n35\n00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.970\nwhere we make all of our decisions,\nwhere we define our standards.\n\n36\n00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.880\nBut importantly for\nthis particular process, this is where\n\n37\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.520\nwe interpret the organization's\nvision into a vision for IT.\n\n38\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.640\nSo, in business relationship management,\nin the strategy management, and even in\n\n39\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.750\nthe processes of demand management,\nwe take the organization's vision and\n\n40\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.480\nwe take their way of working, and\nwe translate that into a vision for IT.\n\n41\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.480\nAnd then in service design, well,\nservice design we design our services and\n\n42\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.860\nwe design our processes and we design\nwhat we're going to measure as well.\n\n43\n00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.670\nAnd so, in service design, all of those\nmetrics that we actually want to take for\n\n44\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.000\nCSI, well, this is where we design them.\n\n45\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.105\nAnd then in transition we build our\nservices, and we build our processes.\n\n46\n00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:47.640\nThen we transition them\ninto the live environment.\n\n47\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.760\nSo here in service transition,\n\n48\n00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.510\nwe're taking measurements such\nas the results of testing, etc.\n\n49\n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.555\nWe're also taking measurements\non customer expectations.\n\n50\n00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:01.135\nAnd we're going to look at service\nlevel management throughout design and\n\n51\n00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:03.785\ntransition and into service operation,\n\n52\n00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:06.965\nwhere this is where we actually\ntake our measurements.\n\n53\n00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:11.295\nThis is the actual monitoring of services,\nso this is where we take the metrics.\n\n54\n00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:18.570\nSo in CSI, in our seven step improvement\nprocess, we look to improve.\n\n55\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.720\nAnd we look to take a challenge and\n\n56\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.390\nconvert that into\nan improvement opportunity.\n\n57\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.380\nBut we are heavily relying on metrics and\n\n58\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.820\nwe are heavily reliant on data and so\nwe have to get the date from somewhere and\n\n59\n00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.168\nof course we get it from all\nof the other lifecycle phases.\n\n60\n00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:41.480\nAnd in this slide that we have on\nthe screen right now, you see,\n\n61\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.360\njust an example, of where certain\nprocesses are going to help us.\n\n62\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.530\nAnd these are only certain processes,\nas well.\n\n63\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.420\nThese are not all of the processes,\n\n64\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.560\nobviously not,\nwe've got more than 20 of them.\n\n65\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.580\nBut some of the processes\nthat will help us with this.\n\n66\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.340\nAnd, for instance,\n\n67\n00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.740\nservice level management is going to\nhelp us in absolutely everything.\n\n68\n00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.680\nAvailability management is going to\nhelp us, and capacity management,\n\n69\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.290\nwith gathering data and\nthen presenting data.\n\n70\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.680\nBecause they understand\nhow our technologies work.\n\n71\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.250\nCapacity management, again,\nlike availability management,\n\n72\n00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.810\nunderstands how our technology works.\n\n73\n00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.070\nEvent management, well,\nthey are performing the monitoring,\n\n74\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.920\nas well as managing events,\nas we looked at in service operations.\n\n75\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.540\nSo their management are gonna\ngather data for us.\n\n76\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.180\nThe service desks understand our users.\n\n77\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.640\nAnd so the service desk are going to help\nus with analyzing and presenting data.\n\n78\n00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.050\nFinancial management,\ntell us how much money we've got to spend.\n\n79\n00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.930\nAnd also, we help financial management\nwith how much money we have spent.\n\n80\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.850\nAnd so on, so every single process\nwithin the entire ITIL life cycle has\n\n81\n00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.010\nan input into the seven\nstep improvement process.\n\n82\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.159\nAnd, of course, it really depends\non what we're improving, as well.\n\n83\n00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.920\nIn previous sections, we used the example\nof improving the service desk and\n\n84\n00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.531\nimproving our customer\nsatisfaction rating.\n\n85\n00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:16.372\nBut it depends on what we're improving as\nto what data we're going to bring in, and\n\n86\n00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:19.170\nwhat data we're going to utilize.\n\n87\n00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.020\nIf I take a look at\nService Level Management, for instance.\n\n88\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.060\nService level management\nprovides us with not only\n\n89\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.480\nan articulation of the actual service,\nitself.\n\n90\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.710\nThat's in that service level agreement,\nbut also the service level targets.\n\n91\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.360\nIn other words,\nthe parameters within which\n\n92\n00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.890\nwe agree with the organization that\nwe are going to deliver a service.\n\n93\n00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:45.565\nThat's what happens in service design.\n\n94\n00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:50.620\nAnd throughout design and transition,\nservice level management negotiate\n\n95\n00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.672\nthose targets because the first instinct\nfor any customer is always to ask for\n\n96\n00:05:55.672 --> 00:06:00.120\nthe service to be available,\n365 days a year, 24 hours a day.\n\n97\n00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.897\nWell, that's great, but then that's going\nto cost money for that high availability.\n\n98\n00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.513\nSo throughout design and transition,\n\n99\n00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:12.357\nservice level management is negotiating\nthose service level targets.\n\n100\n00:06:13.387 --> 00:06:15.017\nAnd then once we get into operation,\n\n101\n00:06:15.017 --> 00:06:19.870\nwhere a service is operating in a live\nenvironment, then service level management\n\n102\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.690\nhas a responsibility to conduct\nregular service reviews.\n\n103\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.520\nAnd those regular service reviews is where\nwe produce the SLAM Charts that we look\n\n104\n00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.040\nat in the last section that we covered,\n\n105\n00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.180\nall those rag charts or red, yellow,\ngreen depending on where we are [LAUGH].\n\n106\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.960\nAnd that's where we monitor performance\nagainst those service level targets.\n\n107\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.100\nSo service level management is really,\nreally involved with data.\n\n108\n00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.740\nIt's completely dependent upon data.\n\n109\n00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.840\nIt's completely dependent on delivering\nthe performance or delivering\n\n110\n00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.700\nthe expectation of the performance\nmanagement of a particular service.\n\n111\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.300\nAnd therefore we take that data\nfrom service level management.\n\n112\n00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.330\nThat's a huge big input.\n\n113\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.320\nThe output from service level management,\n\n114\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.432\nfrom the service review meetings, is what\nwe call a service improvement plan, or\n\n115\n00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:19.430\nin ITIL we like acronyms,\nso we call that a SIP.\n\n116\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.980\nA service improvement plan is opportunity\nfor improvement and of course that gets\n\n117\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.190\nfed into the CSI process quite often,\nthe seven step improvement process.\n\n118\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.830\nSo service level management is really,\nreally important in all of this\n\n119\n00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.000\ncuz service level management\narticulates the service.\n\n120\n00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.540\nIt articulates the targets within\nwhich we want to deliver the service.\n\n121\n00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.690\nBut service level management also\nidentifies opportunities for\n\n122\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.270\nimprovement too and gives us the data\nto show us how we're performing.\n\n123\n00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.580\nAnd availability and capacity management,\nwell, they are processes that sit with\n\n124\n00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.522\ntheir service design exactly the same\nas service level management.\n\n125\n00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:03.973\nBut we have two sides to availability and\ncapacity management.\n\n126\n00:08:03.973 --> 00:08:06.000\nWe have the proactive side.\n\n127\n00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.816\nWhere we're planning for availability and\n\n128\n00:08:08.816 --> 00:08:12.391\ncapacity as part of designing\nthe new service and as part\n\n129\n00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:17.680\nof designing the ongoing requirements\non an annual basis for every service.\n\n130\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.497\nWe're planning for\navailability and full capacity.\n\n131\n00:08:21.497 --> 00:08:25.573\nSo they're gonna help us with strategy and\nwith a vision for\n\n132\n00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:29.242\nthose services, and\nthe increased availability and\n\n133\n00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:34.645\ncapacity needs which might translate\ninto changes in service level targets.\n\n134\n00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:38.583\nBut, just important as\nthe proactive side capacity and\n\n135\n00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:42.020\navailability management\nhave a reactive side,\n\n136\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.460\nwhere in order to ensure we meet\nthose service level targets for\n\n137\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.740\navailability and capacity we have\nto monitor with event management.\n\n138\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.201\nWe have to monitor our services and\nwe monitor our components of our services.\n\n139\n00:08:56.201 --> 00:09:02.777\nAnd we monitor their availability,\nwe monitor their capacity to utilization,\n\n140\n00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:07.709\nand we make or we identify\nopportunities for improvement and\n\n141\n00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:12.369\nwe make improvements based\non our current performance.\n\n142\n00:09:12.369 --> 00:09:16.329\nSo again availability and capacity\nmanagement are inputted into improvement\n\n143\n00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:20.649\nopportunities, as well as helping us with\ngathering the data because they're doing\n\n144\n00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:25.250\nthe monitoring, and analyzing the data\nbecause they understand the technology.\n\n145\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.909\nI don't expect any in CSI to be able to\nunderstand absolutely everything about\n\n146\n00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:32.037\nevery piece of technology we have.\n\n147\n00:09:32.037 --> 00:09:34.710\nThat's why we've got technical guys okay.\n\n148\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.490\nThey're there to do the analysis,\nthat's their role, that's their skills.\n\n149\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.028\nRemember about efficiency?\n\n150\n00:09:40.028 --> 00:09:44.183\nAnd efficiency is about minimum\nwaste in terms of skills as well,\n\n151\n00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.810\nas everything else.\n\n152\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.240\nSo CSI will make recommendations, but\n\n153\n00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.390\nCSI will have to do this in\nconjunction with the technical guys,\n\n154\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.480\nthey're the people that\nwill perform the analysis.\n\n155\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.190\nAnd then we've got event management, and\nincident service desk, now event and\n\n156\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.480\nincident management are processes\nwithin service operation.\n\n157\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.272\nAnd the service desk is\nthat functional area,\n\n158\n00:10:08.272 --> 00:10:11.719\nthat group of people that\nperform incident management.\n\n159\n00:10:11.719 --> 00:10:19.670\nEvent management is, on a continuous\nbasis, monitoring our service.\n\n160\n00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.993\nAnd so therefore they're monitoring the\ntechnical aspects of our service such as\n\n161\n00:10:23.993 --> 00:10:26.506\nthe components, those configuration items.\n\n162\n00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:32.609\nAnd they're also monitoring anything\nautomated to do with processes as well.\n\n163\n00:10:32.609 --> 00:10:36.694\nSo they will monitor performance\non a particular component and\n\n164\n00:10:36.694 --> 00:10:42.090\nthen raise and incident automatically,\nif a component should fail.\n\n165\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:46.340\nWell event management is\ninvaluable when it comes\n\n166\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.590\nto CSI because event management is\ngonna be one of our main data sources.\n\n167\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.601\nNow incident management in conjunction\nwith processes like availability and\n\n168\n00:10:56.601 --> 00:11:01.060\ncapacity management, are going to give\nus the end to end service metrics.\n\n169\n00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.490\nThey're going to tell us how\na service is performing.\n\n170\n00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.040\nWe'll have targets for\nboth incident and problem management.\n\n171\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.000\nWe're going to have targets for\navailability and\n\n172\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.912\ncapacity management within\nour service level agreements.\n\n173\n00:11:13.912 --> 00:11:19.730\nAnd so all of those combined will tell us\nhow the end to end service is performing.\n\n174\n00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.512\nSo we don't just wanna make improvements\non the technical side of things.\n\n175\n00:11:24.512 --> 00:11:29.798\nOn the components, we also want to improve\nhow quickly we can resolve incidents and\n\n176\n00:11:29.798 --> 00:11:34.190\nhow quickly we can respond to, say,\nchanges or to problems as well.\n\n177\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:41.668\nSo event management, well they provide\nus with that automated monitoring and\n\n178\n00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:48.063\nmanagement of events that allows us to\nidentify opportunities for improvement.\n\n179\n00:11:48.063 --> 00:11:50.843\nAnd, if we carry on\nlooking at things like,\n\n180\n00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:55.594\nI mentioned our improvement opportunity\nwas to improve the service desk.\n\n181\n00:11:55.594 --> 00:11:58.910\nWe've got telephony things here.\n\n182\n00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.165\nSuch as an ACD,\nthe automated call distribution.\n\n183\n00:12:02.165 --> 00:12:05.905\nWe have got all of that technology\nthat sits on the service desk.\n\n184\n00:12:05.905 --> 00:12:08.305\nThat, in the example that I gave you,\n\n185\n00:12:08.305 --> 00:12:11.735\nwhich was to improve customer\nsatisfaction with the service desk.\n\n186\n00:12:11.735 --> 00:12:13.610\nWe wanted to take all of that data.\n\n187\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.770\nWell event management is a tool\nthat could help us with that.\n\n188\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:23.910\nIt's a process that does monitoring and\ntherefore if this is automated,\n\n189\n00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:29.010\nthen event management could be\ninvolved in taking that data for us.\n\n190\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.690\nAnd correcting all of that data.\n\n191\n00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.340\nAnd perhaps storing all of that data for\nus.\n\n192\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.880\nWe try to think of, we really like to try\nand put our processes in little silos.\n\n193\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.331\nAnd that's not the way we\nwork within IT at all.\n\n194\n00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:45.687\nOnce we have clear roles and\nresponsibilities nevertheless,\n\n195\n00:12:45.687 --> 00:12:50.031\nevery person is performing at least three,\nfour,\n\n196\n00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:55.855\nfive activities from different\nprocesses all the time.\n\n197\n00:12:55.855 --> 00:13:01.152\nAll of the time, and so CSI has to\nhave that working knowledge of all\n\n198\n00:13:01.152 --> 00:13:06.270\nof these processes to be able to\nImprove on these processes too.\n\n199\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.980\nSo what about security management, then?\n\n200\n00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.406\nWell, security management is\ngonna give us information.\n\n201\n00:13:12.406 --> 00:13:17.520\nSecurity management is one area where\nwe've really got to concentrate on.\n\n202\n00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.030\nNowadays, we have to think\nabout security of our services,\n\n203\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.970\nwe have to think about potential breaches.\n\n204\n00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.200\nBut we also have to think about\nphysical security, as well.\n\n205\n00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.710\nWho physically has access\nto our server rooms?\n\n206\n00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.600\nDo you let your housekeeping staff\naccess to your server rooms?\n\n207\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.790\nIt's one of those questions where we\nsometimes forget about who has access and\n\n208\n00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.720\nwe think about the obvious people about,\nwell,\n\n209\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.850\nwe don't want our users having\naccess to our server rooms.\n\n210\n00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.910\nBut then we let other people such as\nour janitorial staff have access to\n\n211\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.380\nour server rooms.\n\n212\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.750\nWell, if they don't have the knowledge\nto be able to use the servers,\n\n213\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.160\nand they don't have\na technical understanding.\n\n214\n00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.580\nWill they actually know whether they\nare unplugging anything from the wall?\n\n215\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.988\nAnd that might seem like a crazy question\nbut it's a question you know that\n\n216\n00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:17.705\nhas presented problems in the past with\norganizations when it has not been asked.\n\n217\n00:14:17.705 --> 00:14:20.252\nAnd when it has not been answered, and\n\n218\n00:14:20.252 --> 00:14:25.504\nwhen we have janitorial staff that do have\naccess to the server room if we don't\n\n219\n00:14:25.504 --> 00:14:30.296\ngive them the knowledge to be able\nto understand what the equipment is.\n\n220\n00:14:30.296 --> 00:14:35.490\nThe is there any harm in unplugging it so\nthat we can plug the vacuum cleaner in?\n\n221\n00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.350\nThey don't know.\n\n222\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.750\nSecurity management also helps us\nwith not just understanding what\n\n223\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.790\ntype of breaches we could have and whether\nit could be something like hacking,\n\n224\n00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.520\nan external influence, or\nwhether it could be something physical.\n\n225\n00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.200\nSecurity management will also\nhelp us understand the impact\n\n226\n00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.800\nas well of any security breaches.\n\n227\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.459\nSo that's gonna give us valuable data,\n\n228\n00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:05.945\nbecause we need to be aligned with the\nsecurity requirements of the organization.\n\n229\n00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:11.047\nAnd then lastly, for\nthis particular section, I would just want\n\n230\n00:15:11.047 --> 00:15:16.244\nto take a look at financial management and\nfinancial management,\n\n231\n00:15:16.244 --> 00:15:22.850\nwell they're responsible for\nanalyzing the, well, how do I say this?\n\n232\n00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.591\nAnalyzing the amount of money that\nwe spent and where we spent it.\n\n233\n00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:30.430\nAnd also then setting the budgets for\nour following years.\n\n234\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.589\nSo financial management\nsometimes make decisions for us.\n\n235\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.918\nFinancial management will look at\nthe amount of money we spent and\n\n236\n00:15:39.918 --> 00:15:41.374\nthey will say to us,\n\n237\n00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:47.057\nwell you know you spent too much money\non preventative maintenance this year.\n\n238\n00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:50.168\nAnd, therefore, we want to improve\nour budget for next year and\n\n239\n00:15:50.168 --> 00:15:53.406\nwe don't wanna spend so\nmuch money on preventative maintenance.\n\n240\n00:15:53.406 --> 00:15:58.589\nWe wanna cut that in half, and we don't\nwanna spend half as much money on that.\n\n241\n00:15:58.589 --> 00:16:02.677\nWe wanna spend money on fixing\nthings if they go wrong.\n\n242\n00:16:02.677 --> 00:16:04.505\nWhether that's a wise decision or not,\n\n243\n00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:08.380\nmaybe that's a decision that's aligned\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n244\n00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.570\nSo financial management\nare actually going to help us\n\n245\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.440\nwith our decision making when it\ncomes to improvement initiatives.\n\n246\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.930\nSo what else then?\n\n247\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.380\nWell, let's take a look.\n\n248\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.590\nWe've already talked about service\nlevel management and understanding\n\n249\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.780\nthe data that comes out of\nour service level agreements.\n\n250\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.140\nAnd we've looked at capacity and\navailability management and\n\n251\n00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:38.630\nhow they're going to help us\nwith giving us that data and\n\n252\n00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:44.830\nhelping us analyze each\nindividual piece of equipment.\n\n253\n00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:45.955\nEach individual component.\n\n254\n00:16:45.955 --> 00:16:47.757\nAnd we've looked at incidents and\n\n255\n00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:52.190\nwe've looked at the service desk as well\nand we've looked at problem management.\n\n256\n00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.456\nAnd again we're just gonna take\na brief look at information security\n\n257\n00:16:56.456 --> 00:17:01.250\nmanagement as well that are gonna help\nus with all of our analysis of our data.\n\n258\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.960\nLet's take a look at using\nthis information then and\n\n259\n00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.750\npresenting the information.\n\n260\n00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.320\nRemember who our audience is.\n\n261\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.520\nService level management,\nas I've already pointed out,\n\n262\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.420\nservice level management will\nhighlight areas for improvement.\n\n263\n00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.610\nIn other words, they will bring out\nopportunities for improvement as part of\n\n264\n00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:28.540\nthat service improvement plan, the output\nfrom the service review meetings.\n\n265\n00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.687\nAnd they will actually help us, not only\nin highlighting areas for improvement, but\n\n266\n00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:35.230\nalso in providing feedback\nfrom our customers too.\n\n267\n00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.360\nAnd business relationship management's\ngonna help with this as well.\n\n268\n00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.080\nAnd then we've got availability and\ncapacity management, and\n\n269\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.020\nas I've already said,\nas part of their planning,\n\n270\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.890\nthey're gonna help us identify\nimprovement opportunities too.\n\n271\n00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.490\nAnd then incident management,\nnow incident management,\n\n272\n00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:58.590\nthe service desk more than incident\nmanagement will help us with reporting.\n\n273\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.150\nI mentioned in a previous section\nthat our service desk will be\n\n274\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.720\nthe people that will actually have\ncompiled these reports for us, and\n\n275\n00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.770\nwill gather the data for us, and then we\nwill use either a service desk analyst or\n\n276\n00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.640\na reporting analyst to\nanalyze these reports.\n\n277\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.440\nThe service desks are really valuable.\n\n278\n00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:25.140\nBecause you see the service desk\nunderstand our customers and our users.\n\n279\n00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:32.900\nI like to think of the service\ndesk as a translation role.\n\n280\n00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.890\nI was gonna say a tool, but\nthat's the wrong word to use.\n\n281\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:40.320\nThey act as a translator\nbetween our users and IT.\n\n282\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.560\nAnd so,\nthe service desk understand what format\n\n283\n00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.895\nthe graphs and the nice pretty pictures\nthat we wanna produce need to be in.\n\n284\n00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:55.270\nThey understand the question,\nwhat's in for me?\n\n285\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.580\nThey know what's in it for\nthe customer and for the users, and\n\n286\n00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.540\ntherefore their best place to\nproduce that information and\n\n287\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.100\nto display it in a way that\nmeans something to the customer.\n\n288\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.240\nAnd what about problem management then?\n\n289\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.750\nWell, problem management, don't forget,\ntheir role is to provide and\n\n290\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.520\nto perform some root cause analysis,\nget to the bottom of problems.\n\n291\n00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.950\nSo in terms of analyzing information,\n\n292\n00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:25.100\nproblem management is going\nto be really key to this.\n\n293\n00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.535\nBecause problem management,\n\n294\n00:19:26.535 --> 00:19:31.780\nthey got all of those analysis\ntechniques that can help us with\n\n295\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.550\nmaking recommendations when we want to\npresent and to use that information.\n\n296\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.430\nAnd then what about\nthe other processes then?\n\n297\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.970\nWe mentioned change management\nin a previous session.\n\n298\n00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:50.010\nWhat I want to tell you is just to\nreiterate really that every single\n\n299\n00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:55.350\nimprovement opportunity needs\nto go through change management.\n\n300\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.720\nIt has to be controlled.\n\n301\n00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.720\nThat doesn't mean that we add in\nbureaucracy, what it means is that we\n\n302\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.300\nperform changes to our organization and\n\n303\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:12.590\nto our infrastructure in a controlled and\na consistent manner.\n\n304\n00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:17.820\nIt doesn't mean that we add in red tape or\nthat we make the process lengthy.\n\n305\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.164\nWe use models to ensure the efficiency and\n\n306\n00:20:22.164 --> 00:20:26.640\nthe effectiveness of our changes, okay?\n\n307\n00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.790\nSo this is not about bureaucracy,\nthis is about control.\n\n308\n00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:36.176\nAnd sometimes our changes are large\nchanges, they're improvements\n\n309\n00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:41.020\nthat need the evaluation of\nthe change advisory board, okay?\n\n310\n00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:46.130\nSo there is nothing wrong with\ninvolving our CAB in our decisions.\n\n311\n00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.500\nAnd then, of course, we mentioned\nservice level management, again.\n\n312\n00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.020\nWell, when we talk about implementing the\nimprovements, service level management is\n\n313\n00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.270\ngoing to help us because they speak\nto our customers on a regular basis.\n\n314\n00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:03.680\nThey will help us prioritize our\nimprovement opportunities and\n\n315\n00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.650\nthey will help us with\nthe communication to our customers.\n\n316\n00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:13.140\nSo what our CSFs then, for\nour seven step improvement process?\n\n317\n00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.400\nThese are our critical success factors.\n\n318\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.930\nWhat is it that we have to achieve?\n\n319\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.070\nWell, a CSF, as it says up there,\nis something that has to happen.\n\n320\n00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.610\nAnd a KPI will tell us whether\nwe are achieving that.\n\n321\n00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.642\nAnd I've already mentioned in a previous\nsection that we should have at least two\n\n322\n00:21:30.642 --> 00:21:31.362\nKPIs per CSF.\n\n323\n00:21:31.362 --> 00:21:37.208\nWhen we looked at that vision to\nmetrics tree in the previous section,\n\n324\n00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:39.882\nI said to you that for every CSF,\n\n325\n00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:43.970\nwe should have at least two to three KPIs,\nokay?\n\n326\n00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.705\nIt says recommended no more\nthan two to five KPIs.\n\n327\n00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:53.380\nI think more than five is a little bit,\nhow should we say, confusing?\n\n328\n00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.730\nIt can be, but\ncertainly they should be no less than two.\n\n329\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:01.260\nMy personal recommendation is around about\nthree to four, which is an optimum number.\n\n330\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.840\nFor CSF for seven step improvement\nprocess, while the critical\n\n331\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.540\nsuccess factor is well, we've got to\nidentify improvement opportunities.\n\n332\n00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.820\nAnd this is just examples by the way,\nof CSFs for this individual process.\n\n333\n00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.310\nAnother CSF could be lower in\nthe cost of service provision.\n\n334\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:27.690\nThat could be something that\nwe've identified as needed for\n\n335\n00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.370\nour IT organization.\n\n336\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:34.370\nOr maybe that it's we are achieving\nthe required business outcomes from our IT\n\n337\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.950\nservices, okay.\n\n338\n00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.500\nYou will decide on your CSFs.\n\n339\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.590\nAnd you will see here that even\nthough it says in the last bullet\n\n340\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:47.440\npoint in the last slide that we\nwanna say two to five KPIs per CSF,\n\n341\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.930\nyou see just an example of\none KPI here for each CSF.\n\n342\n00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:57.240\nThese are just examples,\nnothing more than that.\n\n343\n00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.700\nThese are just a recommendation based on\n\n344\n00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.460\nwhat we talked about in the last few\nsessions, nothing more than that.\n\n345\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:12.630\nYou will define for your organization\nCSFs that are appropriate to you.\n\n346\n00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.270\nWe are not going to tell you what\nyour critical success factors are.\n\n347\n00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.100\nThat is entirely up to you.\n\n348\n00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.520\nSo lastly,\nwhat is it then we have to got to overcome\n\n349\n00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.450\nin order to be able to implement seven\nstep improvement process and CSI?\n\n350\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.900\nWell, CSI has got to be seen as important.\n\n351\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.560\nAnd that's the biggest challenge,\nis that quite often,\n\n352\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.360\nwe just wanna get the job done.\n\n353\n00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.710\nAnd we just wanna carry on\nas we are right now, and\n\n354\n00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.910\nas long as we haven't got any complaints,\nthen there's no reason to improve, right?\n\n355\n00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.872\nAn organization, and\nI mean a service provider,\n\n356\n00:23:51.872 --> 00:23:55.135\nan IT service provider as well,\nany organization\n\n357\n00:23:55.135 --> 00:23:59.576\nthat doesn't seek to improve will\neventually start rolling back.\n\n358\n00:23:59.576 --> 00:24:04.025\nBecause in comparison to the rest of\nthe world, if you wanna stay here Well,\n\n359\n00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:04.798\nguess what?\n\n360\n00:24:04.798 --> 00:24:07.984\nThe rest of the world is going here.\n\n361\n00:24:07.984 --> 00:24:11.272\nAnd an organization that\nstays here will end up\n\n362\n00:24:11.272 --> 00:24:15.670\ncomparatively rolling back as\nthe rest of the world moves on.\n\n363\n00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.820\nCSI has to be seen as a very important\npart of every single organization.\n\n364\n00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.220\nAnd I mean service provider as well.\n\n365\n00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:30.180\nWe have to continually improve, because\nif we don't, we'll start to move back.\n\n366\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.964\nQuite often that's a challenge in itself,\n\n367\n00:24:32.964 --> 00:24:36.208\njust convincing people\nthat CSI is really needed.\n\n368\n00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:37.690\nWhy can't we just stay where we are?\n\n369\n00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.048\nAnd of course, once we've decided\nthat CSI is really needed,\n\n370\n00:24:42.048 --> 00:24:45.600\nthen there are certain risks\nthat could cause it to fail.\n\n371\n00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.870\nSuch as the fact that we\ndon't take it seriously,\n\n372\n00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.820\nthat we think that it's something that\njust has to be done every now and then.\n\n373\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.830\nAnd so, we don't have consistency,\nand we don't have funding, and\n\n374\n00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.120\nwe don't have a need to do it.\n\n375\n00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.810\nWe don't see this.\n\n376\n00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:05.550\nAnd therefore, that can cause CSI to\nkinda fall by the wayside, really, and\n\n377\n00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.790\nbe forgotten about.\n\n378\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:11.790\nAnd as I've already said,\nan organization that stays where it is is\n\n379\n00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:17.595\nan organization that will eventually\nfall back in line with its competitors.\n\n380\n00:25:17.595 --> 00:25:21.260\nAnd CSI's not just about\ntechnological improvement.\n\n381\n00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.950\nIt's not just about having the latest and\ngreatest PCs.\n\n382\n00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.810\nIt's not just about having\nthe fastest servers.\n\n383\n00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:32.624\nIt's also about having the processes\nin place to enable us to have\n\n384\n00:25:32.624 --> 00:25:36.575\nthe fastest servers and\nthe latest and greatest PCs.\n\n385\n00:25:36.575 --> 00:25:39.706\nIf you wanna buy the latest and\ngreatest PC,\n\n386\n00:25:39.706 --> 00:25:45.260\nthen you've gotta have that right\nrelationship with our suppliers.\n\n387\n00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.817\nTo enable us to buy them efficiently and\n\n388\n00:25:47.817 --> 00:25:50.999\ncost-effectively, as we\nmight wanna call it.\n\n389\n00:25:50.999 --> 00:25:55.915\nSo we have to have the right processes in\nplace to be able to support all of our\n\n390\n00:25:55.915 --> 00:25:58.140\ntechnology as well.\n\n391\n00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:04.670\nSo in order for CSI to work,\nit has to be embedded into our culture.\n\n392\n00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:10.880\nCSI has to be seen as being\nan important part of who\n\n393\n00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.280\nwe are as an IT service provider.\n\n394\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.730\nAnd even when we look at CMMI and\nwhen we look at the usage of the CMMI\n\n395\n00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:24.270\ntool to analyze our process maturity,\n\n396\n00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:29.250\nwe'll see that the pinnacle of CMMI,\nnumber five on the CMMI chart is\n\n397\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:34.990\nactually the adoption of CSI\nwithin every single process.\n\n398\n00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:40.800\nSo CSI is really important and\nwill help us remain competitive,\n\n399\n00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.350\nboth as a service provider and\nalso as a organization,\n\n400\n00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.847\nout in the big wide world\nin the marketplace.\n\n401\n00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:57.750\nSo what I would like you to do is\nI would like you now to review\n\n402\n00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:02.580\nwhat you have learned in the last four\nsections as we looked at the CSI process.\n\n403\n00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:09.195\nYou have some exercises within your\nmaterial that you've downloaded.\n\n404\n00:27:09.195 --> 00:27:11.952\nI'd like you to take those exercises now.\n\n405\n00:27:11.952 --> 00:27:14.870\nIt takes you around about an hour to\n\n406\n00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.472\none hour 30 minutes to\nundertake the exercises.\n\n407\n00:27:17.472 --> 00:27:19.435\nI'm available.\n\n408\n00:27:19.435 --> 00:27:23.255\nWe're here on our forum, so\nplease, if you have any questions,\n\n409\n00:27:23.255 --> 00:27:27.835\nany queries at all about those exercises,\nthen please come back to us.\n\n410\n00:27:27.835 --> 00:27:31.785\nLet us know, and we'll be happy to respond\nto any queries that you might have.\n\n411\n00:27:33.145 --> 00:27:34.975\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well,\nthank you again for\n\n412\n00:27:34.975 --> 00:27:40.300\nhelping us to see where CSI is really\ngetting all of the inputs from those other\n\n413\n00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.350\nphases in the service life cycles that\nwe've been looking at previously as well.\n\n414\n00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.890\nIt really does help to be able to see\nhow it all integrates together and\n\n415\n00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.800\nfits in the way that we need to.\n\n416\n00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.950\nAnd the idea that I've also pulled away\nfrom this is that an entire organization,\n\n417\n00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:58.720\neven without CSI, is probably not\ngoing to actually be improving\n\n418\n00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.560\nnot only not improving but\nmaybe even falling backward.\n\n419\n00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.230\n&gt;&gt; And that maybe something that we all\nhave to think about before we move on.\n\n420\n00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.590\nBut that's also a great place for\nus to end this episode too.\n\n421\n00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:12.660\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n422\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n423\n00:28:13.730 -->

00:00:08.482\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:12.520\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.960\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.404\nYou're watching the ITIL\nintermediate CSI show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.404 --> 00:00:21.278\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:24.302\nAnd today we're taking a look\nat different CSI techniques and\n\n9\n00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:26.233\nwe're gonna begin with assessments.\n\n10\n00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:31.337\nAnd here to help us out is going to be\nour ITIl's arena herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:34.138\nJo, welcome back to our show\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:34.974\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:34.974 --> 00:00:36.631\n&gt;&gt; All right Joe, here we are,\n\n14\n00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:40.170\nwe have taken a look at a lot\nof different things so far.\n\n15\n00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.763\nAnd now we're moving into\nthe realm of CSI techniques,\n\n16\n00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:46.372\nand we are beginning with assessments.\n\n17\n00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:49.110\nWhy is it so important that we start\nwith the idea of assessments Jo?\n\n18\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.163\n&gt;&gt; Well a lot of improvement\ninitiatives are born out of the fact\n\n19\n00:00:55.163 --> 00:00:57.998\nthat we need to improve obviously.\n\n20\n00:00:57.998 --> 00:01:01.270\nAn improvement means aligned\nto the needs of the business.\n\n21\n00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.472\nAnd before we can make any improvement,\n\n22\n00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:06.775\nwe have to really understand\nexactly where we are right now,\n\n23\n00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:10.789\nin order to us retain whether we\nare aligned to the business, or whether we\n\n24\n00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.040\nneed to make improvements in order to be\naligned to the needs of the business.\n\n25\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.740\nSo an assessment really is a look\nat where we are right now.\n\n26\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.909\nWhat is our starting point?\n\n27\n00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.824\nAnd we can assess in many different ways,\nand\n\n28\n00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:28.060\nwe can assess on many different things,\nas well.\n\n29\n00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.502\nWe're not just talking about\nassessment of our processes.\n\n30\n00:01:30.502 --> 00:01:34.372\nWe could be talking about assessment\nof our services, also even our people,\n\n31\n00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:37.630\ntoo and we'll get into that\nin a little bit more detail.\n\n32\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.615\nBut what we're really aiming for\nis complete and utter, total,\n\n33\n00:01:41.615 --> 00:01:45.033\ncontinual alignment to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n34\n00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:48.940\nAnd in order to do that,\nwe understand that we have to improve,\n\n35\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.388\nbecause the organization changes and\nso we'll always have to change.\n\n36\n00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:57.273\nAnd therefore, we need to understand\nwhere we are right now and\n\n37\n00:01:57.273 --> 00:02:00.365\nthat's really what\nan assessment will do for us.\n\n38\n00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:04.643\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, so when we start taking\na look at this idea of an assessment,\n\n39\n00:02:04.643 --> 00:02:09.410\ndoes it really come down to let's say\nit's like a paper exam that I sit for?\n\n40\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.422\nAre you just gonna hand me out or\nmy organization as like, fill out this and\n\n41\n00:02:13.422 --> 00:02:14.405\nI'll grade you?\n\n42\n00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.597\nRonnie, you've made a failing grade.\n\n43\n00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:19.123\n&gt;&gt; Well, the only answer I've\ngot to that is it depends.\n\n44\n00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:19.915\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n45\n00:02:19.915 --> 00:02:22.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It completely depends\non the type of assessment that we\n\n46\n00:02:22.545 --> 00:02:23.720\nwant to undertake.\n\n47\n00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.495\nNot all assessments are tested for\nlegislative requirements or for\n\n48\n00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:32.525\nadherence to international standards,\nfor instance.\n\n49\n00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:36.988\nWe could also be assessing for not only\nour alignment to the organization, but\n\n50\n00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:40.369\nalso our alignment to, say,\ncorporate requirements, or\n\n51\n00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.625\ngovernment's requirements,\nethical requirements.\n\n52\n00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:45.538\nOr perhaps even our own policies and\n\n53\n00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:48.970\nour own procedures within our processes or\nwithin our teams.\n\n54\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.610\nSo an assessment can be carried\nout a variety of levels,\n\n55\n00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.641\nevery single level\nwithin the organization.\n\n56\n00:02:55.641 --> 00:03:01.093\nAnd it can be carried out on both\nprocesses, on services as well.\n\n57\n00:03:01.093 --> 00:03:06.423\nAlso on our alignment, we can compare\nourselves to an industry standard,\n\n58\n00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:10.520\nwe can compare ourselves\nto our competitors as well.\n\n59\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.034\nSo an assessment can be carried\nout at a multitude of levels with\n\n60\n00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:18.965\na multitude of results coming\nout of that assessment.\n\n61\n00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:23.102\nAnd it really depends on what we\nwant the assessment to show us,\n\n62\n00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:26.860\nas to how we assess and\nwhether we do it on a piece of paper.\n\n63\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.282\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, so let's take for\n\n64\n00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:33.075\nexample what you're talking about in terms\nof different compliance assessments here.\n\n65\n00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:38.760\nIf we were to do that, is it that we're\nthen focusing in on just that one area?\n\n66\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.914\nOr when we start talking about\nthe CSI assessment here,\n\n67\n00:03:41.914 --> 00:03:44.408\nthat we're talking about multiple areas?\n\n68\n00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:47.862\nSo is this an all or nothing, or\nare we really able to divide it up and\n\n69\n00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:50.540\nsay, here's what I really\nneed an assessment on?\n\n70\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.224\n&gt;&gt; Right, well you're kinda\njumping ahead of me here.\n\n71\n00:03:53.224 --> 00:03:54.276\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\n\n72\n00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:57.056\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm gonna talk a little\nbit more about that in a second.\n\n73\n00:03:57.056 --> 00:04:00.390\nThe first thing we gotta understand\nis really what an assessment is.\n\n74\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.567\nAnd I've already mentioned that we're\ngonna assess against potentially against\n\n75\n00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:06.603\nstandards, against competitors etc.\n\n76\n00:04:06.603 --> 00:04:09.442\nBut the first thing that we've\ngotta really understand is what is\n\n77\n00:04:09.442 --> 00:04:10.172\nan assessment?\n\n78\n00:04:10.172 --> 00:04:19.020\nAnd it just is a formal way of comparing\nour operational environment to a standard.\n\n79\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.359\nWhether that standard is\nan international standard or\n\n80\n00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:26.932\nwhether it's a process compliance to\nour own particular documentation or\n\n81\n00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:30.650\nwhether it's an ethical standard,\nas I've already said.\n\n82\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.421\nSo in order to do that comparison,\n\n83\n00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:38.820\nwe need to also be able to\narticulate where we are right now.\n\n84\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.332\nAnd so we will do something like\na maturity model assessment,\n\n85\n00:04:43.332 --> 00:04:47.516\nwhich will assess against\na particular maturity model.\n\n86\n00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:51.385\nIn other words how mature\nare we in a particular process?\n\n87\n00:04:51.385 --> 00:04:53.029\nOr how well aligned are we?\n\n88\n00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:56.035\nIt's not just enough to turn around and\nsay, hey we're not aligned.\n\n89\n00:04:57.137 --> 00:04:58.930\nI wanna know exactly where I am and\n\n90\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.435\nhow far have I got to go\nin order to get aligned.\n\n91\n00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:03.760\nSo this is why we do assessments.\n\n92\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.089\nSo the assessment has to have\nan objective, it has to.\n\n93\n00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.617\nThe other thing about an assessment is\n\n94\n00:05:10.617 --> 00:05:15.048\nwe are performing a baseline\nassessment of where we are right now.\n\n95\n00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.440\nThat's what we mean by base line,\nwhere am I right now.\n\n96\n00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.896\nWhich means that once I've made\nan improvement I'm gonna have to carry out\n\n97\n00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:27.259\nanother assessment, because that's gonna\ntell me whether I've made that improvement\n\n98\n00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:28.668\nor not, whether it worked.\n\n99\n00:05:28.668 --> 00:05:32.669\nAnd then in the future,\nwell that one then becomes my baseline for\n\n100\n00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.710\nthe next improvement.\n\n101\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.274\nAnd then that in turn,\nthat assessment becomes my baseline for\n\n102\n00:05:38.274 --> 00:05:39.626\nthe next improvement.\n\n103\n00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:44.239\nSo every time we make an assessment,\nit becomes a baseline for an improvement.\n\n104\n00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:48.264\nAnd then at the end of the improvement\nwhen we've implemented, we'll take another\n\n105\n00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:51.840\none, and that becomes the baseline for\nthe subsequent improvement.\n\n106\n00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.540\nSo that bottom statement there\nabout committment, well,\n\n107\n00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.464\nwe need to have committment to\ncarry out ongoing assessments.\n\n108\n00:05:59.464 --> 00:06:01.489\nThis is not just a one-off exercise,\n\n109\n00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:04.690\nand I've said this throughout\nour CSI session as well.\n\n110\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.415\nThis is not just about you know\na one of activity that we do,\n\n111\n00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:13.068\nthis is an ongoing commitment towards\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n112\n00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:16.424\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo sorry, let me interrupt\nyou with another question right now.\n\n113\n00:06:16.424 --> 00:06:18.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know you're about to get in that.\n\n114\n00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.754\nBut the very fact that very\nfirst line that you have there,\n\n115\n00:06:21.754 --> 00:06:24.640\nassessments are a formal mechanism.\n\n116\n00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.554\nWhy is it so important that\nit is a formal mechanism, and\n\n117\n00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.170\nnot something that's ad hoc?\n\n118\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.904\n&gt;&gt; Well, because we looked at\nthis in previous sessions,\n\n119\n00:06:31.904 --> 00:06:34.870\nyou've got a different opinion to me,\nhaven't you?\n\n120\n00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.349\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in just about everything.\n\n121\n00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:36.999\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n122\n00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:38.311\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so\n\n123\n00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:42.675\nif I did an assessment and it wasn't\na formal assessment, and I didn't have\n\n124\n00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:47.265\na formal approach to that assessment,\nyou're going to end up with my opinion.\n\n125\n00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:48.643\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n126\n00:06:48.643 --> 00:06:53.787\n&gt;&gt; If you then did an assessment, then\nyou could assess exactly the same thing,\n\n127\n00:06:53.787 --> 00:06:58.080\nif you then did an assessment,\nwhat we would end up with is?\n\n128\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.181\n&gt;&gt; My opinion.\n&gt;&gt; Your opinion, right.\n\n129\n00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:02.690\nWhich means that we've got\ntwo different opinions.\n\n130\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.076\nWhich one's the truth?\n\n131\n00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:06.946\nWell okay then, let's rephrase that,\n\n132\n00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:10.660\nbecause there's definitely gonna be\nan element of truth in both of them.\n\n133\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.329\nBut the fact is that neither one of them\nare going to be an impartial assessment,\n\n134\n00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:20.643\nneither one of them are going to\nbe what we would consider to be\n\n135\n00:07:20.643 --> 00:07:23.625\naccurate in terms of a formal mechanism.\n\n136\n00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:24.483\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n137\n00:07:24.483 --> 00:07:26.650\nwe've got two different opinions.\n\n138\n00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.755\nSo, which one do we go on?\n\n139\n00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:29.960\nOr do we just say, look,\nwe'll take the middle ground and\n\n140\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.730\nwe'll say that's probably\nwhere we are right now.\n\n141\n00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.801\nThis is why we need to\nhave a formal assessment.\n\n142\n00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:39.670\nCuz the other thing is and here is the\nchallenge people move from one particular\n\n143\n00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.670\njob within an organization to another.\n\n144\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.975\nAnd the person performing the assessment\nright now might not necessarily\n\n145\n00:07:45.975 --> 00:07:48.327\nbe the person performing\nthe assessment next week.\n\n146\n00:07:48.327 --> 00:07:53.972\nAnd so again we get exactly the same\nsituation where we have different opinions\n\n147\n00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:59.189\nand different view points and\nevery assessment could be carried out with\n\n148\n00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:05.810\na Slightly different bias, and so this\nis why we need to have formal mechanism.\n\n149\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.640\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so Jo, that sounds good.\n\n150\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.830\nNow, I didn't mean to interrupt you on\nthe question that I had asked you earlier.\n\n151\n00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.810\nSo let me make sure that I kind\nof repeat that question, right.\n\n152\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.220\nSo the question I had previously, just\nin case you lost your train of thought,\n\n153\n00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.420\nbecause I know I did for\na little bit there.\n\n154\n00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.190\nIs this something that we\nactually have to do in whole, or\n\n155\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.710\ncan we actually divide it up into\nparts and only assess what we need to?\n\n156\n00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.805\n&gt;&gt; Well, we have three\ndifferent types of assessment.\n\n157\n00:08:28.805 --> 00:08:32.990\nWe have what we call\na process only assessment.\n\n158\n00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:39.840\nAnd a process only assessment just\nassesses the processes themselves.\n\n159\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.220\nSo that's the first type of assessment.\n\n160\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.110\nAnd you can see on the slide\nactually that's coming up right now.\n\n161\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:50.760\nAnd at the bottom half of that slide,\nwe see our second type of assessment,\n\n162\n00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.100\nwhich looks at people,\nprocess, and technology.\n\n163\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.490\nNow that's an interesting type of\nassessment, and I really like this.\n\n164\n00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.030\nBecause we're not only\nassessing a process,\n\n165\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:05.480\nbearing in mind what we assess against,\nwhether it's an international standard or\n\n166\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.100\nwhether it's any type of governance\npolicies etc., that's completely separate.\n\n167\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.830\nThis is just focusing on what we assess.\n\n168\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.470\nSo the first one focused\nis just on the processes.\n\n169\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.080\nWe could assess against, say CMMI and\n\n170\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.320\nwe'll come on to that in\na little more detail.\n\n171\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:29.130\nBut then our second type of assessment\nlooks at processes and the technology.\n\n172\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.980\nNow we've already mentioned this,\nwe could be assessing against,\n\n173\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.920\nlet's say, our services against\nour competitor's services.\n\n174\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.290\nWhat services do they offer?\n\n175\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.800\nWhat technology do they have?\n\n176\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.520\nWe could also be assessing\nagainst our people, okay,\n\n177\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.860\nand that's part of this\nsecond assessment here, and\n\n178\n00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.380\nthat looks at the skills\naspect to our people.\n\n179\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.445\nSo not just the skills, but\nalso the number of people that we have.\n\n180\n00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:03.220\nIncluding the roles that they undertake,\nand as I said, their skills and\n\n181\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.540\nexperience.\n\n182\n00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.860\nSo that's the second assessment.\n\n183\n00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.914\nThe third assessment is what\nwe call a full assessment.\n\n184\n00:10:10.914 --> 00:10:16.409\nNow, I like that that second type of\nassessment, because it looks at skills and\n\n185\n00:10:16.409 --> 00:10:21.411\npeople, and the second type really\nfocuses on the fact that we have these\n\n186\n00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:27.320\ncapabilities as we call them in ITIL,\nthese intangible assets to our services.\n\n187\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.380\nWell, a full assessment has\ngot something extra in there.\n\n188\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.840\nIf we take a look, there's a big plus\nin there that says plus culture,\n\n189\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:42.690\nvision and governance and decision making\npractices, and that's really important.\n\n190\n00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.494\nHow on Earth do you assess culture?\n\n191\n00:10:45.494 --> 00:10:48.400\nThat's always a question\nthat's asked of me.\n\n192\n00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.140\nHow do we assess the culture?\n\n193\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.980\nWell, culture is about\nlooking at our vision.\n\n194\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.686\nIt's about looking at our\norganization as a whole.\n\n195\n00:10:55.686 --> 00:11:00.782\nAnd really assessing not just against a\nstandard, because you can't really when we\n\n196\n00:11:00.782 --> 00:11:05.749\nare talking about culture, but we have\nto assess against maybe our competitors.\n\n197\n00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:09.383\nAssess against maybe an industry standard,\nbut\n\n198\n00:11:09.383 --> 00:11:13.292\nalso, just a real assessment\non who our people are.\n\n199\n00:11:13.292 --> 00:11:18.140\nWhen we talk about culture, I'm not just\ntalking about whether we live in France or\n\n200\n00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.870\nwhether we live in the States or\nwhether we live in England.\n\n201\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.190\nCuz obviously that plays\na huge part in culture,\n\n202\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.892\ncuz I quite like having my croissant for\nbreakfast on the morning.\n\n203\n00:11:26.892 --> 00:11:33.233\nOkay, but it also refers to the culture\nthat we have in terms of innovation.\n\n204\n00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:36.220\nWhat about our management culture?\n\n205\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.580\nWho is our management?\n\n206\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.780\nDo we have a very strict\nhierarchical culture?\n\n207\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.740\nOr do we have a more collaborative culture\nand a more collaborative structure?\n\n208\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.890\nAre we in an organization that's\nvery receptive to change, or\n\n209\n00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.740\nare we in an organization that's\nvery resistant to change?\n\n210\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.580\nAnd you can ask, well,\nwhy on Earth do we need to know that?\n\n211\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.340\nWell, because if we're in an organization\nthat's resistant to change,\n\n212\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.750\nthen that means that any improvement that\nwe make is gonna be quite a challenge for\n\n213\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.460\nus to embed into the culture,\nespecially if it's a large change.\n\n214\n00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:14.600\nIf it's a large improvement, where we're\nbringing in, say a brand new service,\n\n215\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.820\nthere may be people or organization\nwho don't like new technology.\n\n216\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.920\nSo we have to understand that.\n\n217\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.350\nSo we'll do an assessment on,\nCulture, as well as our people,\n\n218\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.910\nas well as our processes and\nour technology as well.\n\n219\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.010\nSo to answer your question, well,\nwe can assess pretty much anything.\n\n220\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:39.110\nBut we're going to really narrow down our\nassessments to either looking at process\n\n221\n00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:45.100\nor looking at people, process and\ntechnology, or looking at culture as well.\n\n222\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.000\nAnd then, let's go look at the top\npoint within our slide there,\n\n223\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.875\nwhich is when to assess.\n\n224\n00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:55.310\nN,ow I mentioned that an assessment is\na snapshot of where we are right now.\n\n225\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.200\nSo an assessment we will do\nbefore we start any improvement.\n\n226\n00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.860\nWe're going to do it part\nway through an improvement.\n\n227\n00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.040\nIt's called project midstream.\n\n228\n00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.980\nSo we will assess to make sure that we\nare going in the right direction just to\n\n229\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.960\nensure that progress is being made and\nthat we're headed in the right direction.\n\n230\n00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.740\nAnd we'll also assess,\nat the end of the project, too,\n\n231\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.380\nto make sure that we have\nImplement an improvement.\n\n232\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.270\nNow when I talk about project,\nI am just using those words just to\n\n233\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:32.490\narticulate that any particular improvement\ncould be managed by a project.\n\n234\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.470\nBut any improvement could\nbe very small as well.\n\n235\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.050\nAnd sometimes these small improvements\nactually make the biggest impact.\n\n236\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.646\nBut we still need to do the assessments.\n\n237\n00:13:41.646 --> 00:13:43.570\nAll right now, Jo,\nbefore we move on from here,\n\n238\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.600\nI was taking a look at these last two that\nyou have here on the screen, the people,\n\n239\n00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.500\nprocess and\ntechnology versus the full assessment.\n\n240\n00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.240\nAs I continue to think about that a little\nbit more, it seems like those two,\n\n241\n00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.330\nthey are so similar, but\nat the same time, when\n\n242\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.510\nwe actually have to choose which one we\nwould rather do, it looks like the people,\n\n243\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:06.430\nprocesses, and technology is to\nhelp us to evaluate where we are.\n\n244\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.980\nBut it seems like if you go to the full\nassessment, you're trying to say\n\n245\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.610\nsomething else, like there may be more\nthat has to be done here as we do\n\n246\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.250\nthe continual service improvement, and\nthat's why we choose that one instead.\n\n247\n00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.510\nAm I wrong in the very fact that\nthe full assessment seems to be\n\n248\n00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.200\nintimating, that, hey, there may be\nmore that needs to be done here.\n\n249\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.814\nLet me go ahead and get a full assessment\nrather than just figure out the people,\n\n250\n00:14:30.814 --> 00:14:31.680\nprocess and technology.\n\n251\n00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's take a look at this slide\nagain, actually, to answer the question.\n\n252\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.230\nBecause if you look at the people,\nprocess, and technology,\n\n253\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.750\nyou'll see that it looks at\nthe organizational structure,\n\n254\n00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.780\nit looks at the roles,\nand it looks at talent.\n\n255\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.680\nSo it's looking at experience and\nit's looking at skills.\n\n256\n00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:52.068\nNow, I can look at skills and I can\nsay okay, Ronnie, you've got an MCSC.\n\n257\n00:14:52.068 --> 00:14:55.360\nThat means that you know\nquite a bit about Microsoft.\n\n258\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.590\nOkay, excellent.\n\n259\n00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.700\nBut that doesn't tell me whether\nyou want to learn anything new.\n\n260\n00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.580\nIt just tells me what you already know.\n\n261\n00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.960\nWell, if I look at my culture and\nI do a cultural assessment,\n\n262\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.720\nmy cultural assessment will tell me\nhow open you are to something new and\n\n263\n00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.460\nto learning something new.\n\n264\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.500\nHow open you are to maybe look\nat another role, for instance.\n\n265\n00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.445\nSo that's the difference between.\n\n266\n00:15:19.445 --> 00:15:23.100\nN,ow quite, often we'd like to think\nthat we understand the culture of our\n\n267\n00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.772\norganization.\n\n268\n00:15:23.772 --> 00:15:28.000\nAnd so we think we don't need\nto that because it's challenge.\n\n269\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.780\nTrying to assess the culture of\nan organization can be a challenge.\n\n270\n00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.960\nAnd so\na lot of people will shy away from that,\n\n271\n00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.780\nand they'll just make that assumption\nthat okay, I've got the skills.\n\n272\n00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.110\nAnd I know exactly who can do what and\n\n273\n00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:46.660\ntherefore who I can use to implement this\nchange or to run with this in the future.\n\n274\n00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.180\nBut you're still making an assumption\nthere that they're going to\n\n275\n00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.080\nwant to do that.\n\n276\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n277\n00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.152\nSo we do have to understand culture.\n\n278\n00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:56.165\nAnd certainly,\nwhen we talk about strategies and\n\n279\n00:15:56.165 --> 00:16:00.968\nwe mention the fact that we can, from a\nvery high level, we look at strategies in\n\n280\n00:16:00.968 --> 00:16:05.558\nterms of run the business and grow\nthe business and transform the business,\n\n281\n00:16:05.558 --> 00:16:09.930\nIf our organization is trying to grow,\nwe need to understand that.\n\n282\n00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:15.050\nBecause, culturally, we do not need\nan IT organization that's just\n\n283\n00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:20.708\nstuck in a vision or in a mindset of run\nthe business, they have to be aligned.\n\n284\n00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:25.483\nAnd I have walked into many organizations\nwhere I see a complete misalignment in\n\n285\n00:16:25.483 --> 00:16:26.203\nstrategy.\n\n286\n00:16:26.203 --> 00:16:29.539\nAnd that's because nobody's\ndone the cultural assessment.\n\n287\n00:16:29.539 --> 00:16:34.455\nAnd it's something that is quite often\noverlooked, because it's either of\n\n288\n00:16:34.455 --> 00:16:39.080\nan intangible nature, or because\nit's perceived to be too difficult.\n\n289\n00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:45.067\nSo, and that brings me to the next point\nactually, which is on the next slide you\n\n290\n00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:48.333\nwill see that we've got here\njust an example of pros and\n\n291\n00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:52.678\ncons of using an internal versus\nan external person to do an assessment.\n\n292\n00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:58.070\nYou mentioned earlier on about,\ncan I just do these on a piece of paper?\n\n293\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:02.788\nAnd can I just assess against maybe\na particular scale or something like that?\n\n294\n00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:07.953\nYes you can, but in the same way\nthat I mentioned that if I did it,\n\n295\n00:17:07.953 --> 00:17:13.809\non my own without any reference to\nany method then you'd get my opinion.\n\n296\n00:17:13.809 --> 00:17:17.416\nIf you did it on your own without any\nother reference to any method then we'd\n\n297\n00:17:17.416 --> 00:17:18.340\nget your opinion.\n\n298\n00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.112\nYour opinion is going to\nbe different to mine.\n\n299\n00:17:21.112 --> 00:17:25.567\nAnd that's where we look at\none of the cons as we say,\n\n300\n00:17:25.567 --> 00:17:28.926\nof using a self assessment technique.\n\n301\n00:17:28.926 --> 00:17:33.236\nIn the lower half of that slide there\nyou've got performance self assessment,\n\n302\n00:17:33.236 --> 00:17:37.689\nand we've got pros and cons there to self\nassessments and to external resources.\n\n303\n00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:42.535\nYou see, one of the cons of using a or\nthe negative side,\n\n304\n00:17:42.535 --> 00:17:47.899\nthe downside to using an internal\nperson to do an assessment or\n\n305\n00:17:47.899 --> 00:17:52.459\ngroup of people is that\nlack of objectivity, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:52.459 --> 00:17:56.449\nIt's very, very subjective viewpoint,\nwhich means that\n\n307\n00:17:56.449 --> 00:18:01.097\nyou're subject to internal politics and\nmaybe little acceptance.\n\n308\n00:18:01.097 --> 00:18:04.867\nAnd of course we've got to free you\nup to do that assessment but then,\n\n309\n00:18:04.867 --> 00:18:07.150\nyou can use somebody external to come in.\n\n310\n00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:12.727\nAnd then of course look at the pros\nof using somebody external.\n\n311\n00:18:12.727 --> 00:18:17.393\nWe've got the objectivity, we've got\nthe the knowledge and somebody whose\n\n312\n00:18:17.393 --> 00:18:22.721\nknowledgeable on techniques etc., as well,\nand they've also got the credibility.\n\n313\n00:18:22.721 --> 00:18:27.226\nBut then look at the cons of\nbringing in somebody external which\n\n314\n00:18:27.226 --> 00:18:29.865\nare the pros of doing it internally.\n\n315\n00:18:29.865 --> 00:18:34.251\nBecause bringing in somebody\nexternal is going to cost money and\n\n316\n00:18:34.251 --> 00:18:39.045\nthey don't have that knowledge of\nthe environment itself to be able to\n\n317\n00:18:39.045 --> 00:18:41.741\ngive you a very in-depth assessment.\n\n318\n00:18:41.741 --> 00:18:44.376\nAnd of course, they might not be\nthere to see it through to the end.\n\n319\n00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:49.369\nSo they don't really get involved\nin the result of the assessment.\n\n320\n00:18:49.369 --> 00:18:54.032\nBut then that could also be seen as\nbeing a pro to using self assessment or\n\n321\n00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:59.098\nan internal assessment, and that's\ngotta gonna be seen through to the end.\n\n322\n00:18:59.098 --> 00:19:02.206\nIf somebody internal does the assessment,\n\n323\n00:19:02.206 --> 00:19:07.672\nit's not gonna cost us anything other\nthan just resources, freeing you up.\n\n324\n00:19:07.672 --> 00:19:14.876\nBut it's actually going to, well not\nnecessarily give us that objectivity.\n\n325\n00:19:14.876 --> 00:19:19.631\nThe way that we would normally work\nthis is that in an organization a self\n\n326\n00:19:19.631 --> 00:19:24.307\nassessment as we call it would normally\nbe done by somebody external as\n\n327\n00:19:24.307 --> 00:19:26.069\na starting point, okay?\n\n328\n00:19:26.069 --> 00:19:32.049\nAnd then, as we move into that sort of,\ninto looking at assessment in more depth\n\n329\n00:19:32.049 --> 00:19:37.229\nthen we want to actually make progress\nalong a route of improvement,\n\n330\n00:19:37.229 --> 00:19:41.546\nthen we bring in somebody\nexternal to do the assessment.\n\n331\n00:19:41.546 --> 00:19:44.617\nWe'd also bring in an external\nconsultant to do an assessment\n\n332\n00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:47.579\nwhere we simply didn't have\nthe skills in-house as well.\n\n333\n00:19:47.579 --> 00:19:52.417\nAnd where we really wanted to bring\nin somebody with that credible sort\n\n334\n00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:56.689\nof viewpoint, an unbiased,\nimpartial viewpoint in there.\n\n335\n00:19:56.689 --> 00:19:58.568\nYou have to outweigh the pros and\n\n336\n00:19:58.568 --> 00:20:02.197\ncons before you make any decision\nas to who is going to assess.\n\n337\n00:20:02.197 --> 00:20:06.170\nIdeally an assessment should\nbe an objective view.\n\n338\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.742\nIdeally, we don't want a subjective view.\n\n339\n00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:13.388\nBut as it says there under the risks,\nokay?\n\n340\n00:20:13.388 --> 00:20:18.510\nIt shouldn't be just a one-off\nactivity that we undertake.\n\n341\n00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.492\nAnd if we're bringing in somebody\nexternal, it's going to give us that\n\n342\n00:20:23.492 --> 00:20:28.556\nobjective view, then it's probably\ngoing to be just a one off exercise,\n\n343\n00:20:28.556 --> 00:20:32.578\nbecause it's going to be\nexpensive to bring somebody in.\n\n344\n00:20:32.578 --> 00:20:36.170\nSo we've got to be really,\nreally careful with assessments,\n\n345\n00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.510\nbecause an assessment will tell\nus where we are right now.\n\n346\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:44.489\nBut you've got to make sure that you get\nthat objective viewpoint to allow us to\n\n347\n00:20:44.489 --> 00:20:46.158\nthen make improvements.\n\n348\n00:20:46.158 --> 00:20:49.682\nSo I've mentioned a number of occasions\nboth in previous sessions and\n\n349\n00:20:49.682 --> 00:20:51.366\nalso in this session about CMMI.\n\n350\n00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:56.595\nAnd CMMI is just a standard,\nit's on the next slide here,\n\n351\n00:20:56.595 --> 00:21:01.307\nCMMI is a standard for\nprocess improvement really.\n\n352\n00:21:01.307 --> 00:21:04.938\nIt's a maturity model as it's called for\nprocess improvements.\n\n353\n00:21:04.938 --> 00:21:08.494\nNow you will see that in those processes\n\n354\n00:21:08.494 --> 00:21:13.034\nwe will assess every process\non a scale of 0 to 5.\n\n355\n00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.512\nAnd if we can just expand that slide,\nyou'll see this, so\n\n356\n00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:18.876\nwe start off with zero.\n\n357\n00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:21.180\nZero is a non existent process, okay?\n\n358\n00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.310\nThe process doesn't exist at all, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.797\nAnd I'm going to use incident\nmanagement as an example here.\n\n360\n00:21:26.797 --> 00:21:30.550\nSo zero means that that\nprocess doesn't exist.\n\n361\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:37.576\nOne means that, okay, the process is\nthere, and it's probably ad hoc, okay?\n\n362\n00:21:37.576 --> 00:21:41.007\nSo it's done just purely\ndone on an ad hoc basis,\n\n363\n00:21:41.007 --> 00:21:43.694\nit is not done in a consistent manner.\n\n364\n00:21:43.694 --> 00:21:48.120\nNumber two, so\na level two means repeatable.\n\n365\n00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.503\nSo there's some consistency there,\nthere's probably going to\n\n366\n00:21:52.503 --> 00:21:57.214\nbe some documentation and there that,\nwell it is repeatable, okay?\n\n367\n00:21:57.214 --> 00:22:01.791\nBut nevertheless it would still\nbe considered potentially to be\n\n368\n00:22:01.791 --> 00:22:06.000\nsomewhat ad hoc,\ncertainly not well developed.\n\n369\n00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.854\nNow, three means that it\nshould be consistent,\n\n370\n00:22:08.854 --> 00:22:12.556\nthere should be a standard approach and\nshould be documented.\n\n371\n00:22:12.556 --> 00:22:16.063\nAnd that's in level three for\nprocess maturity.\n\n372\n00:22:16.063 --> 00:22:19.102\nLevel four means that its managed.\n\n373\n00:22:19.102 --> 00:22:22.618\nSo not only is documented,\nnot only it consistent but\n\n374\n00:22:22.618 --> 00:22:27.153\nactually somebody is managing\nthe process to ensure that it works and\n\n375\n00:22:27.153 --> 00:22:29.828\nthat it's delivering the objectives.\n\n376\n00:22:29.828 --> 00:22:35.424\nNow level five, well that means\nthat we've got CSI involved, okay?\n\n377\n00:22:35.424 --> 00:22:40.162\nAnd CSI, well,\nwe're here to make sure that that process\n\n378\n00:22:40.162 --> 00:22:44.623\nstays aligned to the needs\nof he organization, okay?\n\n379\n00:22:44.623 --> 00:22:48.924\nSo it says that processes are considered\nbest practice through improvement.\n\n380\n00:22:48.924 --> 00:22:52.620\nThat's best practice for\nyour organization.\n\n381\n00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.035\nThat's not, that doesn't mean that they've\nbeen copied out of the ideal publications\n\n382\n00:22:56.035 --> 00:22:58.784\nand you've implemented them, and\nhey, look, they're gonna work.\n\n383\n00:22:58.784 --> 00:23:02.214\nNo, what it means is that they're\nbest practice for your organization.\n\n384\n00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:07.143\nSo they are constantly being\nchecked on a continual basis for\n\n385\n00:23:07.143 --> 00:23:11.397\nalignment with the needs\nof the organization and for\n\n386\n00:23:11.397 --> 00:23:14.117\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n\n387\n00:23:14.117 --> 00:23:16.067\nDo we want all of our\nprocesses though Ronnie?\n\n388\n00:23:16.067 --> 00:23:17.828\nDo you think they should\nbe at number five?\n\n389\n00:23:17.828 --> 00:23:19.748\n&gt;&gt; Ideally, yes.\n\n390\n00:23:19.748 --> 00:23:23.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n391\n00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.628\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n392\n00:23:24.628 --> 00:23:26.848\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is the answer to that.\n\n393\n00:23:26.848 --> 00:23:29.592\nWe have to think about this logically.\n\n394\n00:23:29.592 --> 00:23:30.096\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n395\n00:23:30.096 --> 00:23:33.775\n&gt;&gt; All right, we don't always\nwanna use all of our processes.\n\n396\n00:23:33.775 --> 00:23:35.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n397\n00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:42.235\n&gt;&gt; So we only want those processes that\nwe're going to use to be at level five.\n\n398\n00:23:42.235 --> 00:23:47.675\nThose processes that we don't use,\nthey don't need to be at level five,\n\n399\n00:23:47.675 --> 00:23:50.943\ndepending on the size of the organization.\n\n400\n00:23:50.943 --> 00:23:55.443\nIn a small organization, we might not\nactually have a separate process of demand\n\n401\n00:23:55.443 --> 00:23:58.563\nmanagement, it might be part\nof capacity management.\n\n402\n00:23:58.563 --> 00:24:03.327\nIn which case, then, we don't need to\nhave demand management as level five.\n\n403\n00:24:03.327 --> 00:24:03.928\nOkay.\n\n404\n00:24:03.928 --> 00:24:08.255\n&gt;&gt; And if we look at the slide or\nthe graph that's in front of us here,\n\n405\n00:24:08.255 --> 00:24:13.170\nyou'll see, where we really need to\nbe is this white band in the middle.\n\n406\n00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.720\nThat's where we need to be.\n\n407\n00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.770\nWhere if a process is of low\nvalue to the organization,\n\n408\n00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.520\nthen it really just needs\nto have low maturity.\n\n409\n00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.700\nAnd if a process is of a high value,\nthat's when it should have high maturity.\n\n410\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.740\nSo if we're not using demand management,\n\n411\n00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.550\nthen it should be down here in\nthis bottom left hand corner.\n\n412\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.421\nIf we are using demand management,\nthen, well, the greater importance it\n\n413\n00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:43.450\nis to the organization,\nthen the higher the maturity it should be.\n\n414\n00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:48.350\nSo you'll see here that service level\nmanagement in this particular graph,\n\n415\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:49.970\nthat's at an optimum level.\n\n416\n00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:55.317\nIn other words, it has sort of,\nwell, a kind of midrange value.\n\n417\n00:24:55.317 --> 00:24:58.920\nAnd it's between a 2 and\na 3 in terms of maturity.\n\n418\n00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.408\nBut availability management and\ncapacity management have a high value, but\n\n419\n00:25:03.408 --> 00:25:05.347\nthey're very immature, okay?\n\n420\n00:25:05.347 --> 00:25:10.365\nSo the idea is that with our processes,\nit really is down to what\n\n421\n00:25:10.365 --> 00:25:15.300\nthe organization requires and\nwhat the organization needs.\n\n422\n00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:20.100\nAnd if we don't need\na process to be mature,\n\n423\n00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.360\nthen it's not efficient for\nus to have that maturity on level five.\n\n424\n00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.938\nSo I go back to that last slide, and\nthe question that I asked you was,\n\n425\n00:25:30.938 --> 00:25:33.645\ndo we want everything at level five?\n\n426\n00:25:33.645 --> 00:25:36.593\nAnd the answer that we've gotta have is-\n&gt;&gt; No!\n\n427\n00:25:36.593 --> 00:25:38.547\n&gt;&gt; No, right, exactly.\n\n428\n00:25:38.547 --> 00:25:42.971\nOkay, think about the value\nto the organization.\n\n429\n00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:45.450\nSo what do we use an assessment for?\n\n430\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:49.275\nWell, we use an assessment as a benchmark,\nokay?\n\n431\n00:25:49.275 --> 00:25:52.885\nSo as an assessment of where we\nare right now as a baseline,\n\n432\n00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:55.395\nthat's the word I was looking for, okay?\n\n433\n00:25:55.395 --> 00:25:57.615\nAnd a baseline is just\nwhere we are right now.\n\n434\n00:25:57.615 --> 00:26:01.810\nAnd we will use an assessment\nto perform a gap analysis, and\n\n435\n00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:07.970\na gap analysis is a technique where\nwe look at where we want to be.\n\n436\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:13.060\nAnd we will compare where we are right now\nagainst where we want to be in the future.\n\n437\n00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:19.370\nSo for example,\nwe're doing a process maturity assessment\n\n438\n00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:23.800\nhere in that previous example, then if I\ntake a look at this previous example, and\n\n439\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.410\nyou see on this graph here,\navailability management is, well.\n\n440\n00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:33.077\nLook at it, we've got high value\nto the organization, or kind of\n\n441\n00:26:33.077 --> 00:26:37.828\nmedium to high value to the organization\nbut yet it's very, very long on maturity.\n\n442\n00:26:37.828 --> 00:26:42.225\nSo where we actually want to be, if I can\nget my arrow, here we go, we want to be,\n\n443\n00:26:42.225 --> 00:26:47.570\nwell, if this is where it is in terms of\nvalue, then I wanna be over here with it.\n\n444\n00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.200\nSo this is my gap.\n\n445\n00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.225\nMy gap is from here,\navailability management,\n\n446\n00:26:52.225 --> 00:26:54.449\nright where you see to here, okay?\n\n447\n00:26:54.449 --> 00:26:56.257\nThere's my gap analysis and\n\n448\n00:26:56.257 --> 00:27:00.710\nthat shows me that I need to have\navailability management at level 4.\n\n449\n00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:05.966\nNow, capacity management, if I take this\nline across, then capacity management,\n\n450\n00:27:05.966 --> 00:27:09.628\nI actually want to be here,\nwhich is about a four and a half.\n\n451\n00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:12.221\nSo now I know I've got my gap analysis,\n\n452\n00:27:12.221 --> 00:27:17.252\nI've got both of these processes that\nare on between levels one and two, and\n\n453\n00:27:17.252 --> 00:27:22.219\nI actually want one of them on level four,\nand one of them on four and a half.\n\n454\n00:27:22.219 --> 00:27:22.930\nSo that's my gap.\n\n455\n00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.950\nAnd my gap analysis then looks at where\nI am right now, where I want to be,\n\n456\n00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.980\nand then, okay, this is where we\nstart on our CSI approach, and\n\n457\n00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.940\nwe say, right, okay, so\nhow do I get there, okay?\n\n458\n00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:41.990\nSo my CSI approach when I bring into this,\nmy CSI approach started off with\n\n459\n00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:47.460\nmy vision and then my second step in my\nCSI approach was, where am I right now?\n\n460\n00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.308\nThat's my assessment.\n\n461\n00:27:49.308 --> 00:27:52.941\nAnd now I look at where do I want\nto be before I move onto well,\n\n462\n00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:54.563\nokay, how do I get there?\n\n463\n00:27:54.563 --> 00:27:57.391\nAnd then, of course, we look back and\nsay, well, did we get there?\n\n464\n00:27:57.391 --> 00:28:01.400\nAnd again, there's another assessment\nthat we take at that point in time.\n\n465\n00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.880\nSo, this gap analysis then.\n\n466\n00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.760\nWell, this gap analysis can be conducted\non processes, as we've already\n\n467\n00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.720\ntalked about, but it actually can be\nconducted in terms of technology.\n\n468\n00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.720\nThink about the assessments that we do.\n\n469\n00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.241\nWe do processes, but we do people and\nprocesses and technology.\n\n470\n00:28:18.241 --> 00:28:22.330\nIt can even be in organizational\ndirection and culture as well.\n\n471\n00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.080\nYou even got a mention\nthere of human resources.\n\n472\n00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.500\nIt's about the number of people\nthat we have as well as the skills,\n\n473\n00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.440\nas well as their culture, too.\n\n474\n00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.780\nSo we can assess at any particular level,\nand then we can use that to assist\n\n475\n00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:44.740\nwith a gap analysis that will allow us to\nhighlight exactly where we want to be.\n\n476\n00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:49.590\nNow something else that we use\nassessments for is for benchmarking.\n\n477\n00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:53.950\nAnd when we come back in our next session,\nwe're going to look a lot further into\n\n478\n00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:58.769\nbenchmarking and benchmarking techniques,\nand also the value of benchmarking.\n\n479\n00:28:59.856 --> 00:29:01.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well,\nthank you again for\n\n480\n00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:05.180\nhelping us to at least get started\nin understanding the idea of using\n\n481\n00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:10.010\nassessments as a formal approach to help\nus in our continual service improvement.\n\n482\n00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.270\nIt is something that we\nneed to take seriously and\n\n483\n00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.540\nto actually understand the value\nthat it has to our business as well.\n\n484\n00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.580\nAnd Jo has helped us out\nby explaining that to us.\n\n485\n00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.040\nAll right, well, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n486\n00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.740\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n487\n00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:26.830\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

This is a competitive comparison that can be used to trigger CSI according to Jo.  She also explains that benchmarks help to keep our company aligned not only with business values but also with legislative demands and competitor performance.  She makes sure to emphasize that benchmarks do not help us to see where we need to be but only where we are in comparison to competitors and the standards.",

00:00:12.140\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.758\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:19.180\nyou are watching the ITIL\nintermediate CSI show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.528\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we're continuing to take a look at\n\n7\n00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:27.680\nsome of our CSI techniques here\nmoving on to the realm of benchmarks.\n\n8\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.615\nAnd here to help us, of course,\nis gonna be our ITIL cracker jack herself,\n\n9\n00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:32.435\nis Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:34.016\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:36.943\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know what to say to that,\nthank you, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.943 --> 00:00:38.751\n&gt;&gt; Cracker Jack is a good thing, Jo.\n\n13\n00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:40.924\n&gt;&gt; It was the TV program\nwhere I come from.\n\n14\n00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:41.664\n&gt;&gt; Is that a bad thing?\n\n15\n00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:43.653\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It depends,\n\n16\n00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:48.057\nbut it was only a five-to-five on\na Friday night, put it that way.\n\n17\n00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:51.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right Jo,\nhere, it's a good thing.\n\n18\n00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:55.010\nThat means you're A-one,\nyou're at the top of the game.\n\n19\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.290\nSo Jo, here we are.\n\n20\n00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.896\nWe've taken a look at some of the CSI\ntechniques such as assessment here,\n\n21\n00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:03.440\nand now we're moving onto benchmarks.\n\n22\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.980\nNow, Jo, to me,\nthey sound almost exactly the same.\n\n23\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.170\nSo, Jo help me to distinguish what\nthe difference is between these things.\n\n24\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.908\n&gt;&gt; So, an assessment is the baseline,\na snapshot of where we are right now and\n\n25\n00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:22.000\nwe might assess against a maturity model,\nwhereas a benchmark is a comparison.\n\n26\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.760\nSo, we would compare to a best practice or\na standard, or\n\n27\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.740\ncompare to say,\na competitor, for instance.\n\n28\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.275\nSo, a benchmark is really taking the\nassessment, taking what we've already done\n\n29\n00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:39.514\nand then, comparing it against\na competitor or against industry standard.\n\n30\n00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:44.815\nIn the last section, we looked at\nassessments and we looked at CMMI,\n\n31\n00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:46.815\nthe Capability Maturity Model.\n\n32\n00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:51.341\nAnd we actually mentioned the fact\nthat our processes only need to\n\n33\n00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:55.515\nbe as mature as you need each\nindividual process to be.\n\n34\n00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:59.825\nSo a process that has a high value or\nhigh importance to the organization,\n\n35\n00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:01.433\nthat needs to be a level 5.\n\n36\n00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.500\nIt needs to be fairly mature.\n\n37\n00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.188\nOn a process that doesn't have a high\nimportance to the organization,\n\n38\n00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:09.405\ndoesn't need to be particularly mature.\n\n39\n00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:14.421\nWell, what we do is we'll take that\nassessment or that assessment against say\n\n40\n00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:19.210\nCMMI, and then we look at our competitors\nor we look at industry standard.\n\n41\n00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.770\nAnd we'll say, okay, then so\n\n42\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.370\nwe're at a level three on incident\nmanagement, for instance.\n\n43\n00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.350\nNow level three if you remember, let me\njust go and take a look at CMMI level\n\n44\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.700\nthree means that we are in a defined state\nfor CMMI out for incident management.\n\n45\n00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.930\nBut what I'm going to do now with\nbenchmarks is I'm going to go, and\n\n46\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.630\nI'm going to compare that\nagainst my competitors.\n\n47\n00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.250\nSo I can see that my competitors are\neither on a Level 2, maybe, or Level 2.5,\n\n48\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.060\nor maybe they're on a Level 4.\n\n49\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.210\nSo that allows us to see,\nby use of benchmarks where we are in\n\n50\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.570\nthe market place, in our industry,\nin our industry sector.\n\n51\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.443\nSo, we take the result\nof the assessment and\n\n52\n00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:09.869\nthen we compare it to the industry\nas a whole because as we've said,\n\n53\n00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.990\nwe don't want to be fully\nmature in every single process.\n\n54\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.860\nSo let's take a look at where we\nneed to be for our industry, and for\n\n55\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.160\nour marketplace itself.\n\n56\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.380\nSo a benchmark, then.\n\n57\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.410\nWell, let's take a look at\nthis particular slide first.\n\n58\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.371\nIt's just a comparison of our organization\nagainst either best practice, or\n\n59\n00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:32.540\nagainst our competitors, for instance.\n\n60\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.340\nSo, let's take a look here at\nwhy we undertake benchmarks.\n\n61\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.880\nWell as you can see it allows us to\ndevelop plans on what we do now.\n\n62\n00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.675\nCuz that's something else that just want\nto point out with a benchmark is that\n\n63\n00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:53.710\nIf I'm at level four on incident manager,\nor we've gone up a level haven't we.\n\n64\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.723\nWere we three just a minute ago?\n\n65\n00:03:54.723 --> 00:03:55.363\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n66\n00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:58.210\nlet's say I'm at four\non incident management.\n\n67\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.170\nAnd my competitor is at level\nthree on incident management.\n\n68\n00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.130\nWell, what does that tell us?\n\n69\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.010\nWell, it tells us that we're doing\nbetter than our competitors.\n\n70\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.840\nBut does it tell us exactly\nwhere we need to be?\n\n71\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.420\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n72\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.320\nWhat it will give us is an idea of\nwhere we are in the market place.\n\n73\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.380\nSo it will tell us whether\nwe are leading the market\n\n74\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.660\nsector of whether we are trailing behind\neverybody else in the market sector.\n\n75\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.380\nBut it doesn't actually tell us whether\nwe're particularly good or not.\n\n76\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.590\nThat's what CMMI does.\n\n77\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.114\nThe CMMI will tell us whether we mature,\n\n78\n00:04:33.114 --> 00:04:37.720\nwhereas the benchmark will compare us\nto others within the industry, and\n\n79\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.711\nthat will tell us how we're doing\ncompared to everybody else.\n\n80\n00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:46.578\nSo a benchmark is not just about an\ninternal assessment that we've taken and\n\n81\n00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.999\nwhen we've googled it,\nand we've said, hey look,\n\n82\n00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.450\nthis is what everybody else is doing.\n\n83\n00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.000\nA benchmark is a formal approach.\n\n84\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.321\nAnd a benchmark will generally involve\nan external assessor who will come out and\n\n85\n00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:01.720\nassess externally.\n\n86\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.480\nAnd maybe for\nprocesses we'll use CMMI to help do that.\n\n87\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.410\nBut also an external assessor\nwill have that industry\n\n88\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.580\nperspective and we'll have the levels etc.\n\n89\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.722\nThat the competitors and\n\n90\n00:05:16.722 --> 00:05:22.230\nthe industry is requiring of us in\norder to be able to do our work.\n\n91\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.609\nSo with a benchmark we will\nuse an external assessment\n\n92\n00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:31.650\nto then compare ourselves\nagainst the industry.\n\n93\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.555\nAnd yes, we can do direct comparisons\nagainst our competitors, but for the most\n\n94\n00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:41.480\npart it's going to be against industry\nstandards and industry best practices.\n\n95\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.277\nWhy do you think we don't necessarily\nwant to do a direct comparison to\n\n96\n00:05:46.277 --> 00:05:47.630\nour competitors?\n\n97\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.900\nCan you think of any reason why?\n\n98\n00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.521\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually I had that kind of same\nquestion of why we would actually choose\n\n99\n00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.280\nto do that.\n\n100\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.130\nWhy would we choose to compare\nourselves to our competitors?\n\n101\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.817\nAnd the only reason that I could come up\nwith is we wanna do better than them.\n\n102\n00:06:02.817 --> 00:06:04.961\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you're right.\n\n103\n00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:08.346\nWe do, the problem is-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n104\n00:06:08.346 --> 00:06:09.910\n&gt;&gt; And this is where the challenge lies.\n\n105\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.083\nAnd this is why we'll tell you really that\ncomparing yourself against an industry\n\n106\n00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:15.845\nstandard would be better for you.\n\n107\n00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:16.462\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n108\n00:06:16.462 --> 00:06:18.290\na direct comparison to your competitors.\n\n109\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.304\nIf you had an external assessor\ncoming to do an assessment,\n\n110\n00:06:22.304 --> 00:06:27.310\nyou're going to want that external\nassessor to see the best side of you.\n\n111\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.300\nAnd certainly that's the side\nthat's going to be publicized.\n\n112\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.740\nWell, it's exactly the same for\nyour competitors.\n\n113\n00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.199\nSo if you do a direct comparison\nagainst your competitors then\n\n114\n00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.059\nyou're comparing what you\nperceive as your best side\n\n115\n00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:46.505\nagainst what they perceive\nas their best side.\n\n116\n00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:50.965\nWhile really what we want to do is\nhave an accurate assessment and\n\n117\n00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:55.924\ndo an accurate comparison against\noff with our accurate assessment and\n\n118\n00:06:55.924 --> 00:07:01.560\nagainst industry standard rather\nthan against the competitor, okay?\n\n119\n00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.538\nWe like to ensure data integrity\nwith all of our assessments and\n\n120\n00:07:05.538 --> 00:07:10.355\nwith all of our CSI techniques but we\nhave to be realistic about this as well.\n\n121\n00:07:10.355 --> 00:07:14.681\nOur competitors are going to allow us\nto see what they want us to see and\n\n122\n00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:16.865\nit's exactly the same with us.\n\n123\n00:07:16.865 --> 00:07:21.619\nWe have a lot of data within our\norganization that we want to\n\n124\n00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:24.830\nkeep within our organization, okay.\n\n125\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.227\nBenchmarking means comparing\nagainst industry or\n\n126\n00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:30.520\ncomparing against a competitor.\n\n127\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.330\nSo in order to be able to undertake\nbenchmarking we have to ensure that we've\n\n128\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.030\ngot senior management buy-in.\n\n129\n00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.680\nBecause it's going to cost us money to\nundertake that external assessment.\n\n130\n00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.040\nOkay, and you have to involve\nall of our process owners.\n\n131\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.657\nWe have to involve all of the service\nowners if we are comparing services.\n\n132\n00:07:49.657 --> 00:07:54.323\nAlthough that's very, very difficult\nto compare technologies because we all\n\n133\n00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:57.607\nuse disparate technologies\nin different ways, okay.\n\n134\n00:07:57.607 --> 00:08:00.647\nAnd we have to ensure that we\nhave got the relevant teams and\n\n135\n00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:04.090\nthe relevant skills in house\nto be able to do that as well.\n\n136\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.146\nWhilst in benchmarking,\nwe use somebody external because they\n\n137\n00:08:08.146 --> 00:08:11.524\nhave access to the external\ndata about the industry,\n\n138\n00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:15.520\nwe still are going to prepare\nby doing an internal assessment.\n\n139\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.971\nOf course we are,\nin the same way that we mentioned,\n\n140\n00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:20.160\ninternal assessments\nare the place to start.\n\n141\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.940\nSo in terms of benchmarking techniques,\nthe various ways of benchmarking,\n\n142\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.660\nand we might use focus groups to do this.\n\n143\n00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.180\nWe might use customer groups that we have.\n\n144\n00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.760\nAnd we have user groups, etc,\nout there in the big wide world.\n\n145\n00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.958\nThat will help us,\nwe call them focus groups,\n\n146\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:47.206\nthat will help us to see from an impartial\nperspective exactly where we are in\n\n147\n00:08:47.206 --> 00:08:52.130\ncomparison to industry and\nin comparison perhaps to our competitors.\n\n148\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.890\nWe can use financial information,\nwe can use questionnaires etc.\n\n149\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.278\nWe always have to bear in mind that for\n\n150\n00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:03.287\nthe most part even though we'll\nuse external assessments and\n\n151\n00:09:03.287 --> 00:09:08.299\nexternal assesses to do benchmarking and\nthat a benchmarking is going to give\n\n152\n00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:13.570\nus a point in time comparison that does\nhave a slightly subjective element to it.\n\n153\n00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.589\nBecause you're asking for others\npeople's opinions and you're asking for\n\n154\n00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:19.769\ninformation from other organizations.\n\n155\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.714\nBenchmarks is gonna cost money which\nis why we have external assessors to do\n\n156\n00:09:25.714 --> 00:09:29.864\nthis because benchmarking's going\nto cost in terms of travel and\n\n157\n00:09:29.864 --> 00:09:34.480\nin terms of time, and also in terms\nof the tools, etc., that are used.\n\n158\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.655\nWhat it does do though, is it gives us\na really, really good perspective on where\n\n159\n00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:45.230\nwe are in, you know, competitively, in\ncomparison to other organizations, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:51.256\nSo, it really is a a starting point for,\nwe call it benchmarking as a lever but\n\n161\n00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:56.266\nit's a starting point for\nan improvement because we can then use\n\n162\n00:09:56.266 --> 00:10:02.090\nthe result of that benchmark to say,\nokay, we need to do better.\n\n163\n00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.810\nIt also can work in boosting our\nself-confidence as well though.\n\n164\n00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.957\nBecause if we're doing better than\neverybody else, then actually,\n\n165\n00:10:08.957 --> 00:10:12.613\nit can be used to bolster our\npride within our organization and\n\n166\n00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:16.360\nalso to drive improvements\nbecause we're doing really well.\n\n167\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.000\nSo therefore, if we keep this up,\nthen we'll be doing even better.\n\n168\n00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.300\nBenchmarking as a lever works\nin exactly the same way.\n\n169\n00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.340\nWhere we say, well, look,\nthe industry standard is, say,\n\n170\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.020\nat level four and\nwe're at level three and half.\n\n171\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.200\nSo, hey, come on.\n\n172\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.449\nJust a quick push and a bit of an extra\ndrive and we'll be leading the industry.\n\n173\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.670\nSo we can do benchmarking internally\nwithin a single department.\n\n174\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.400\nWe can do benchmarking internally\nwithin the organization.\n\n175\n00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.873\nWe can do benchmarking externally which is\n\n176\n00:10:51.873 --> 00:10:56.230\nthe most frequent form of benchmarking.\n\n177\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.430\nOr we can do benchmarking in\na direct comparison to a competitor.\n\n178\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.440\nI would say that certainly in\norganizations that I have have been\n\n179\n00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.898\ninvolved with and I have consulted in.\n\n180\n00:11:07.898 --> 00:11:12.710\nBut benchmarking as a direct comparison is\nprobably the one that is the least used\n\n181\n00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.280\nwithin an organization.\n\n182\n00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.692\nPurely because, as I've said before,\nwe have challenges with\n\n183\n00:11:18.692 --> 00:11:22.870\nensuring the integrity of\nthe data that we're going to get.\n\n184\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:28.746\nSo normally, benchmarking would be used\nin a comparison to industry norms and\n\n185\n00:11:28.746 --> 00:11:32.940\nsometimes internally between\nbusiness units, okay.\n\n186\n00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.194\nSo what we want to do is ensure\nthat we highlight areas for\n\n187\n00:11:37.194 --> 00:11:41.620\nimprovement, and\nthis is where benchmarking comes in.\n\n188\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.360\nAs we say, we use it as a lever, okay.\n\n189\n00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.940\nSo this is about looking at things like\nthe cost of IT service provision and\n\n190\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.740\ncomparing that to industry norms for\ninstance.\n\n191\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.220\nThis is about looking at both efficiency\nand effectiveness of our processes and\n\n192\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.440\nbare services as well, okay.\n\n193\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.640\nAnd we can measure our maturity and\nefficiency and\n\n194\n00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.160\neffectiveness by performing benchmarks and\ncomparing to the norm.\n\n195\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.390\nSo who do we involve?\n\n196\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.740\nWell, we already looked in a previous\nslide about the techniques we would use,\n\n197\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.040\nand we talked about things\nlike focus groups etc.\n\n198\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.240\nWell, of course, who's gonna be involved?\n\n199\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.960\nWell, users and customers.\n\n200\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.585\nAnd the service provider, our peers,\nare gonna be involved in this,\n\n201\n00:12:26.585 --> 00:12:28.560\nespecially in terms of focus groups.\n\n202\n00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.695\nAnd if your service is provided to,\nor your organization provides there\n\n203\n00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:38.850\nservices to external customers,\nwe're gonna use them as well, okay.\n\n204\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.170\nAnd we may also bring in our\nfinancially experts, too,\n\n205\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:47.620\nespecially if we are looking at the total\ncost of ownership of any service.\n\n206\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.840\nAnd we're looking at return on investment.\n\n207\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.180\nThen we want to do a benchmark\ncompared to industry norms.\n\n208\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.527\nAre we spending more money\nthan our competitors or\n\n209\n00:12:56.527 --> 00:13:00.280\nare we spending less money\nthan the industry standard?\n\n210\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.460\nWell, we need to be able to identify that,\nokay?\n\n211\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.245\nSo, we've already looked at CMMI and\n\n212\n00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:10.930\nwe've looked at that as\nan assessment tool, okay?\n\n213\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:15.590\nAnd we will use that, as we said,\ncompare to industry standards,\n\n214\n00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.350\ncompare to industry norms\nwithin our organization.\n\n215\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.255\nAnd so look at the questions that\nwe ask ourselves when we're doing\n\n216\n00:13:23.255 --> 00:13:24.885\na benchmark, okay.\n\n217\n00:13:24.885 --> 00:13:28.770\nBearing in mind that at the bottom as it\nsays the assessment can be internal or\n\n218\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:34.000\nexternal, don't forget that\nan internal assessment is not\n\n219\n00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.470\nnecessarily going to be as an objective\na view as an external assessment.\n\n220\n00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.570\nBut these questions here\nare the questions that we have to\n\n221\n00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.760\nask ourselves when we're\ndoing a benchmarking.\n\n222\n00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.439\nEven down to, look at that\nsecond from last bullet point,\n\n223\n00:13:49.439 --> 00:13:53.360\nwhich is the most\nappropriate sourcing option?\n\n224\n00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.361\nIf we in IT are not providing a sourcing\noption that is cost-effective for\n\n225\n00:13:58.361 --> 00:14:03.768\nour organization, then our organization,\nif we're spending more money than\n\n226\n00:14:03.768 --> 00:14:09.580\nall of our competitors, then obviously\nthey're going to be looking at why.\n\n227\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.978\nAnd these are the sort of questions\nthat we ask ourselves when we're\n\n228\n00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.760\nundertaking benchmarks.\n\n229\n00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.707\nSo as an external assessor, well,\n\n230\n00:14:18.707 --> 00:14:24.980\nthey would come into the organization and\nlook at the following.\n\n231\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.928\nFirst thing they'd look at\nis the company itself and\n\n232\n00:14:27.928 --> 00:14:30.820\nunderstanding the strategy\nof the organization.\n\n233\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.845\nIs that strategy based on\na run the business strategy,\n\n234\n00:14:33.845 --> 00:14:37.921\nwhere we're treading water, or\nis it on a grow the business strategy, or\n\n235\n00:14:37.921 --> 00:14:41.780\nmaybe on a transform\nthe business strategy, okay?\n\n236\n00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.330\nAnd then what assets do we have?\n\n237\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.650\nWhat do we have at our disposal?\n\n238\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.910\nAnd when we talk about assets within the\norganization, don't forget our IT assets,\n\n239\n00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:55.120\nour service assets, our resources, those\ntangible assets, and our capabilities.\n\n240\n00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.300\nThey're still assets,\nthey may be intangible assets,\n\n241\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.060\nbut they're still assets.\n\n242\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.560\nAnd then look at our best practices.\n\n243\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.070\nWhat processes do we have in place?\n\n244\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.870\nAnd what level are they\nat on a maturity scale?\n\n245\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.640\nAnd let's think also about\nwho our end users are.\n\n246\n00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.670\nWhat do they know about technology itself?\n\n247\n00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:22.850\nDo they want their technology to be fairly\nuser friendly and fairly intuitive?\n\n248\n00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.150\nOr are they quite happy to do\na lot of working out themselves?\n\n249\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.200\nAre they quite happy to be trained?\n\n250\n00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.800\nThat comes under sort of\na cultural assessment.\n\n251\n00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:37.350\nRemember, when we looked at\nassessments in a previous section.\n\n252\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.897\nSo all of these elements that\nwe would consider when we\n\n253\n00:15:41.897 --> 00:15:45.030\nare performing benchmarks.\n\n254\n00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:50.650\nI wanna leave you with one last\nthought before we take a break and\n\n255\n00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.980\nthen we move on to service\nmeasurement in the next session.\n\n256\n00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.700\nAnd that is the fact that you\nhave to have a purpose for\n\n257\n00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.120\ntaking a benchmark, any benchmark.\n\n258\n00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.820\nWhat is it going to tell you and what\nare you gonna do with the information?\n\n259\n00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.610\nI've already explained that\nbenchmarking can be quite costly.\n\n260\n00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.260\nBenchmarking is not something cheap.\n\n261\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:15.373\nWe bring an external assessor\nto be able to undertake this.\n\n262\n00:16:15.373 --> 00:16:19.365\nAnd therefore assure the integrity of\nthe information that we get from that.\n\n263\n00:16:19.365 --> 00:16:22.065\nSo if it's not going to be\ncheap then you have to have\n\n264\n00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:24.235\na very defined purpose in mind.\n\n265\n00:16:24.235 --> 00:16:27.357\nWe don't just benchmark because\nwe feel like it at the time.\n\n266\n00:16:27.357 --> 00:16:33.975\nWe benchmark for a reason and that reason\nshould be because we want to improve.\n\n267\n00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:38.885\nBecause we want to improve our alignment\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n268\n00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:46.630\nBut we also have to consider\nthe vision of the organization as well.\n\n269\n00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.744\nAnd it's not just about\nthe needs of the organization,\n\n270\n00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:53.521\nwe have to improve our alignment\nto the vision of the organization,\n\n271\n00:16:53.521 --> 00:16:55.990\nthe strategy of the organization.\n\n272\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.050\nAnd the reason why we benchmark?\n\n273\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.794\nWell, we benchmark to ensure that not\nonly are we aligning ourselves to\n\n274\n00:17:02.794 --> 00:17:04.692\nthe needs of the business but\n\n275\n00:17:04.692 --> 00:17:10.590\nalso that we are aligning ourselves to\nthe future strategies of the organization.\n\n276\n00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:14.256\nBearing in mind where\nthe organization is in terms of\n\n277\n00:17:14.256 --> 00:17:19.106\na comparison with industry standards and\nwith competitors, okay.\n\n278\n00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:23.376\nWhat we want to do is we want to ensure\nthat our organization, as a whole,\n\n279\n00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:27.856\nhas got that competitive edge that is\nrequired to make them world leaders and\n\n280\n00:17:27.856 --> 00:17:30.070\nto make them world class.\n\n281\n00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:34.080\nThey can't do that if we\nare not align to their vision.\n\n282\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.270\nSo we have to ensure that\nwe're aligned to them.\n\n283\n00:17:37.412 --> 00:17:39.632\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well, thank you again for\n\n284\n00:17:39.632 --> 00:17:43.170\nhelping us to understand a little\nbit more about benchmarking.\n\n285\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.869\nTaking a look at that idea of\nthe comparison against our competitors,\n\n286\n00:17:46.869 --> 00:17:49.660\nas well as the industry standards.\n\n287\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.000\nHelping us to keep competitive.\n\n288\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.880\nThis is actually a kind of key idea for\nus as well.\n\n289\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.580\nNow, this is also a great place for\nus sign off for this episode as well.\n\n290\n00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.000\nFor ITPRO.TV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n291\n00:18:02.000 -->

Jo reminds that customers to the service are rarely concerned about the details of how the service works they are concerned with end result.  This is what we must measure according to Jo.  Availability and reliability and performance are key measurements that we must measure.  These service measures provide validation, justification, direction and intervention.",

ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.280\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.560\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n8\n00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.270\nwe are continuing on taking a look\nat some of the CSI techniques.\n\n9\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.180\nAnd we are now into service measurement.\n\n10\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.090\nAnd here to help us out once again,\n\n11\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.920\nit's good to be with our ITIL master\nblaster herself, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.120\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.330\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.200\nHow are you?\n\n15\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.850\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n16\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.930\nNow, Jo, here we are.\n\n17\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.220\nWe've already taken a look\nat some assessments.\n\n18\n00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.198\nWe've talked about benchmarking a bit.\n\n19\n00:00:43.198 --> 00:00:46.610\nAnd now,\nwe're going into service measurement, and\n\n20\n00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.113\nyou are very clear about this, this is not\nmeasurements, it's service measurement.\n\n21\n00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:54.241\nSo what are we really talking about here,\nJo?\n\n22\n00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.171\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're in CSI,\nand because I think so\n\n23\n00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:06.010\nis not really a good enough measurement on\nwhether we have improved or not, right?\n\n24\n00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.990\n&gt;&gt; I mean, eyeing it is not enough.\n\n25\n00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.490\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n26\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.093\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n27\n00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:11.790\nexactly.\nWe've gotta make sure that we\n\n28\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.640\nare improving.\n\n29\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.660\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n30\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.700\nthe key to any improvement\nhas gotta be the measurement.\n\n31\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.080\nAnd it's about measuring\nthe end to end service.\n\n32\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.170\nIt's not about taking\nindividual measurements\n\n33\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.802\nfrom individual components of a service.\n\n34\n00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:30.030\nWe wanna measure the entire\nend to end service.\n\n35\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.620\nAnd we've got to be able to\ndemonstrate whether we are actually\n\n36\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.270\nmeeting the needs of the organization.\n\n37\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.370\nSo if we take a look at\nthe service measurement itself,\n\n38\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.110\nyou see that we've actually got three\nbasic measurements on our service.\n\n39\n00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.760\nWe've got the availability of the service,\nwe've got reliability, and\n\n40\n00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.550\nthen we've got the actually performance,\nthe end to end performance metric.\n\n41\n00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.480\nWell reliability is about how\noften something breaks down.\n\n42\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.740\nAnd we can take that from our component.\n\n43\n00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.520\nBut the availability of\na service is not just about how\n\n44\n00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.770\noften something breaks down.\n\n45\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.140\nAvailability is defined as\nthe ability of a service, or\n\n46\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.690\na component, to perform its\nagreed function when required.\n\n47\n00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.490\nThat sounds fairly straightforward,\nbecause it sounds as though, well, look,\n\n48\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.010\nhang on a minute,\nif the server is down, then therefore,\n\n49\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.100\nthe service can't be available, right?\n\n50\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.907\nIt makes sense?\n\n51\n00:02:24.907 --> 00:02:26.350\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n52\n00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.188\n&gt;&gt; That's not true.\n\n53\n00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:27.934\nOkay.\n\n54\n00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:31.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; An incident is described as\n\n55\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.290\nan interruption to or reduction in\nthe quality of service as defined by\n\n56\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.940\nthe customer in the service\nlevel agreement.\n\n57\n00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.700\nWe're okay so far?\n\n58\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.663\nWell, let's say I've got two servers, and\n\n59\n00:02:48.663 --> 00:02:52.410\nthey're both mirrored.\n\n60\n00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.400\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n61\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.500\n&gt;&gt; And they are both providing us with\nthe ability to send and receive e-mail.\n\n62\n00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.320\nSo, in my SLA,\nI state that my service Is me\n\n63\n00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.260\nproviding the ability to send and\nreceive email via two mirrored servers.\n\n64\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.784\nYeah, that sounds good so far.\n\n65\n00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:18.397\nSo if one of those servers goes down,\nit dies.\n\n66\n00:03:19.957 --> 00:03:22.400\nThen that's gonna affect the reliability.\n\n67\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n68\n00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is all gonna affect the\nreliability of that individual component.\n\n69\n00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.180\nHas the service been interrupted?\n\n70\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.980\n&gt;&gt; No, not fully interrupted.\n\n71\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\nit shouldn't have been interrupted at all,\n\n72\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.525\nbecause if it's mirroring, then it\nshouldn't have been interrupted at all.\n\n73\n00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:42.945\nBecause that's what we call resilience or\nhigh availability.\n\n74\n00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:46.215\nAnd therefore, there shouldn't\nbe any interruptions to service.\n\n75\n00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:50.575\nNow, in terms of incident management,\nthat's defined as an incident\n\n76\n00:03:50.575 --> 00:03:55.385\nbecause it's a reduction in the quality\nof a service that's defined in the SLA.\n\n77\n00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:59.195\nBut in terms of providing\nthe service to the business and\n\n78\n00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:03.440\nto the end user,\nservice hasn't actually been interrupted.\n\n79\n00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.990\nSo the service is still available.\n\n80\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.768\nSo even though the reliability\nhas been impacted,\n\n81\n00:04:11.768 --> 00:04:16.880\nthe availability hasn't.\n\n82\n00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH] Now, Jo, we've talked about this\n\n83\n00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.530\nbefore when you mentioned the idea\nof the value of a business, right?\n\n84\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.110\nIt is perceived, so\nif we talk about this idea, the perception\n\n85\n00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.480\nthough seems to indicate that it has\nbeen interrupted, the perception.\n\n86\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.376\nI'm not saying that's the reality.\n\n87\n00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:38.148\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily.\n\n88\n00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:38.875\n&gt;&gt; No, okay.\n\n89\n00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:42.481\n&gt;&gt; But the reality now, yeah,\nthe reality would suggest that service,\n\n90\n00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:46.092\nwhile it hasn't been interrupted,\nit's certainly been degraded,\n\n91\n00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:48.090\nthe quality's been degraded.\n\n92\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.920\nBut the question is, value is perceived.\n\n93\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.100\nHas the business noticed that\nthe service has been degraded?\n\n94\n00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.313\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, yeah.\n\n95\n00:04:56.313 --> 00:04:57.385\n&gt;&gt; Well, I should hope not.\n\n96\n00:04:57.385 --> 00:04:58.253\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I should hope not.\n\n97\n00:04:58.253 --> 00:05:02.685\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's the idea of putting in\nreliability options or redundancy options,\n\n98\n00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:06.670\nis that the business, the organization\nshouldn't actually notice.\n\n99\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.660\nSo that means that the service\nis still available.\n\n100\n00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.090\nIt still has a reduction in quality.\n\n101\n00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n102\n00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.990\nBut perception should\nbe that the service is\n\n103\n00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.680\nstill available to the business\n&gt;&gt; All\n\n104\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.400\nright\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n105\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.670\nthe business shouldn't know what chaos\nwe've got going on in the background.\n\n106\n00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.860\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; They don't need to see that.\n\n107\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.408\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n108\n00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:30.413\nit should still feature\nthose service level targets.\n\n109\n00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:34.768\nAnd we talked in previous sessions about\nthe SLAM charts and the RAG charts and\n\n110\n00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:38.118\nthat should still feature,\nin the SLAM and the RAG charts,\n\n111\n00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:41.803\nbecause there was a degradation\nin the quality of the service, or\n\n112\n00:05:41.803 --> 00:05:44.220\na reduction in the quality of the service.\n\n113\n00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.460\nBut nevertheless,\navailability hasn't been impacted.\n\n114\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n115\n00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.440\n&gt;&gt; And this is why we don't\njust focus on reliability.\n\n116\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.640\nIn order to get the end-to-end\nperformance of a service,\n\n117\n00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.770\nwe're looking at both availability,\nand we're looking at reliability.\n\n118\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.320\nAnd we're also looking at the amount\nof time it takes then for\n\n119\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.420\nincident management to bring that other\nserver back up and running again.\n\n120\n00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.560\nSo these metrics, then,\nthe measurement of a service, and\n\n121\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.280\nthe metrics that we take to tell\nus the measurement of a service,\n\n122\n00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.500\nit's all about delivering\nvalue to the organization.\n\n123\n00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.400\nAnd look at that bottom\nbullet point there,\n\n124\n00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.679\nit says a meaningful view as\nthe customer experiences the service.\n\n125\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.170\nI have mentioned, when we look at\nservice operation and we looked at\n\n126\n00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.520\nthe service desk, and I said to you,\nI said to everybody, if you go and\n\n127\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.490\nlook at the service operation class of\nthe service desk, is that window into IT.\n\n128\n00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.940\nAnd a really good service\ndesk can make up for\n\n129\n00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.590\nall of the chaos that's\non going on behind us.\n\n130\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.870\nWell, the simple fact is that if we\nhave our availability targets and\n\n131\n00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.490\nour service articulated correctly so\nthat we deliver perceived value\n\n132\n00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.270\nto the business, then yeah, there can\nbe all of this chaos going on, but\n\n133\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.580\nnevertheless, the perceived value,\nit's what the customer experiences.\n\n134\n00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.560\nAnd that's what's really important.\n\n135\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.270\nI'm not saying that we should\nnever ever have failures and\n\n136\n00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.930\nthat we should never ever go for\nhigh availability on all of our services.\n\n137\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.090\nI mean we can't do that.\n\n138\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.842\nThat's gonna be really expensive to put in\nredundancy options, resilience options for\n\n139\n00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:27.929\nall of our service.\n\n140\n00:07:27.929 --> 00:07:33.791\nBut nevertheless, there is a difference\nbetween the reliability of a component,\n\n141\n00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:37.641\nwhich is what that is,\na component of the service, and\n\n142\n00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:42.940\nthe ability of that service to facilitate\nthe outcomes that are required.\n\n143\n00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.620\nSo here we are in IT, then.\n\n144\n00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.034\nWe are looking at the measurement\nof the end-to-end service.\n\n145\n00:07:53.034 --> 00:07:56.792\nAnd so what we do is we'll take\nindividual measurements and\n\n146\n00:07:56.792 --> 00:08:01.163\nthen we combine them to provide\nthat view the customer experienced.\n\n147\n00:08:01.163 --> 00:08:06.380\nAnd if we take a look at this particular\nmeasurement model on the left-hand side.\n\n148\n00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.720\nYou'll see we build now from each of the\ncomponents to show us service management\n\n149\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.280\nand then we're looking at\nperformance against KPIs.\n\n150\n00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.480\nRemember those service\nlevel targets in the SLAs.\n\n151\n00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.180\nAnd then what we will do is we'll\ntake two types of measurements, and\n\n152\n00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.770\nwe'll take a look at the scorecard\non the left-hand side, and\n\n153\n00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.450\nthen on the right-hand side there,\nwe also see our dashboard.\n\n154\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.917\nNow scorecard is a point\nin time information, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:38.251\nThat is, we'll take these maybe\nonce a week, once a month etc.\n\n156\n00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:42.900\nThat is point in time where as\nthe dashboard is real time.\n\n157\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.491\nThat's what's happening right now.\n\n158\n00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:48.690\nNow I know probably on the screen in\nfront of you the graphics are looking\n\n159\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.820\nquite small.\n\n160\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.930\nI know that I think I need my\nmagnified glass to read that.\n\n161\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.580\nBut never the less in the notes that\nyou've downloaded you can zoom in and\n\n162\n00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:02.490\nyou can see all of the details\nwithin that particular graphic.\n\n163\n00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.880\nAnd we'll use both of those measurements\nthen to give us a balanced view within IT\n\n164\n00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.490\nas to our service exactly how\nour service is performing.\n\n165\n00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.240\nNow this third bullet\npoint that we have here.\n\n166\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.580\nIt says here measure mistakes can be made\nwhile adjustments are made to ensure\n\n167\n00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.740\nthe focus on the service and\nnot on the measurements themself.\n\n168\n00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.030\nWhat on earth does that mean?\n\n169\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.557\nThink about value again and\nthink about value perception, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.830\nYes, we've got to measure how each\nindividual component is performing.\n\n171\n00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.040\nBut if I am so\nfocused on individual performance,\n\n172\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.130\nlet's say incident management,\nfor instance.\n\n173\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.110\nIf I'm focused on my individual\nmanagement performance metrics,\n\n174\n00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.210\nthen what I'm going to do is I'm gonna do\nanything I possibly can to make incident\n\n175\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.807\nmanagement look good, generally to the\ndetrimental effect of the service, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:06.030\nSo what I need to do is\nensure that my focus is on\n\n177\n00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.350\ndelivering value to our end users and\nto our customers.\n\n178\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:14.040\nMy focus has got to be on what we call\nmoments of truth or customer experience.\n\n179\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.180\nMy focus has got to be\non value perception,\n\n180\n00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.870\nmy focus is not just on making\nmy statistics look good.\n\n181\n00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.540\nBecause then I'm not going to deliver\nvalue, if that's what I'm doing.\n\n182\n00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.480\nAnd what sort of things do we measure?\n\n183\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.030\nWell, there's a list there of\nthe things that we might measure.\n\n184\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.740\nComponents, processes, activity.\n\n185\n00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.950\nPlease don't forget customer satisfaction\nas well because this is how we\n\n186\n00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.829\nmeasure whether value has been perceived.\n\n187\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.240\nNow, the next slide looks at\nan overall service availability.\n\n188\n00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.120\nAnd that overall service availability,\nright in the middle of that slide there,\n\n189\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.430\nis at 91.69%, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.520\nWell, let's take a look at this for\na moment then and\n\n191\n00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.830\nwe're gonna start off\nin the right-hand side.\n\n192\n00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:07.693\nAnd in the moment in that technology\ndomain, we have an availability of 99.96%.\n\n193\n00:11:07.693 --> 00:11:14.992\nBut then the WAN, that's the wide\narea network, is available 98%.\n\n194\n00:11:14.992 --> 00:11:21.800\nSo that's 98% of the 99.96%.\n\n195\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.520\nDon't ask me to do that math, all right?\n\n196\n00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.180\nI'm not that good at maths, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.320\nBut then if we look at in the technology\ndomain where we've got our hubs and\n\n198\n00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.190\nour servers and our routers or\n\n199\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.816\nour routers depending on where\nin the world you went to school.\n\n200\n00:11:34.816 --> 00:11:39.811\n[LAUGH] Then you'll see that\nthat we've got a technology\n\n201\n00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:45.019\ndomain availability of 97.5%,\nand that 97.5%\n\n202\n00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:50.448\nis 97.5 of the 98% which\nis 98% of the 99.96.\n\n203\n00:11:50.448 --> 00:11:54.007\nAnd then we come down to the PCs and\nthe technology domain, and\n\n204\n00:11:54.007 --> 00:11:57.370\nyou'll see that they've got\nan availability of 96%.\n\n205\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.726\nThen that is 96% of the 97.5,\n\n206\n00:12:00.726 --> 00:12:06.110\nwhich is of the 98%,\nwhich is of the 99.96%.\n\n207\n00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.665\nAnd now I'll take a breath.\n\n208\n00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:14.510\n[LAUGH] What that actually means is that\nfor an entrance service perspective,\n\n209\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.480\nthat email service is available 91.69%.\n\n210\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.410\nWow, doesn't that sound confusing?\n\n211\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.760\nIt's not really,\nit's quite simple but it really just\n\n212\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.210\nasks us to understand that we have\nto calculate the availability,\n\n213\n00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.820\nand we have to calculate it\nfrom the user perspective.\n\n214\n00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:40.014\nBecause you see if the availability\nof the end user is 96% but\n\n215\n00:12:40.014 --> 00:12:47.564\nthat's only 96% of 97.5 which is\n97.5 of 98, which is 98 over 99.96.\n\n216\n00:12:47.564 --> 00:12:50.807\nSo as far as the use of\nperception is concerned,\n\n217\n00:12:50.807 --> 00:12:54.467\nthen service availability\nis only at 91.69%.\n\n218\n00:12:54.467 --> 00:13:00.630\nWhat this is telling us is you cannot\ntake your components in isolation.\n\n219\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.270\nBecause if you looked at your\ncomponents in isolation and\n\n220\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.750\nsaid, hey this is my availability,\nand actually it doesn't look too bad.\n\n221\n00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:13.210\nBut when you do the calculations, you'll\nsee that the user perception is not great,\n\n222\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.640\nwhich is why it's all about the end\nto end service delivery, and\n\n223\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.870\nit's not about the individual components.\n\n224\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:26.300\nWe have to take the time to work out and\n\n225\n00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.750\nthen agree with the customer\nhow we're going to\n\n226\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:35.997\ndisplay our reports,\nwhat we're going to report on,\n\n227\n00:13:35.997 --> 00:13:40.230\nhow often we're going to report,\nwho our audience is.\n\n228\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.935\nSo who we are going to report to and\ntherefore in what language we are going to\n\n229\n00:13:44.935 --> 00:13:49.584\ndo the reporting, and also think about\nthe frequency and the format too.\n\n230\n00:13:49.584 --> 00:13:54.493\nAnd then I use the word in previous\nsessions and I'll use it quite often,\n\n231\n00:13:54.493 --> 00:13:59.980\nbecause I'm concerned about efficiency,\nand I use the word consistency.\n\n232\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:05.400\nI want to see reports in a consistent\nframework and a consistent manner.\n\n233\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.980\nWhich means that we set expectations with\nour audience, with our customers and\n\n234\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.080\nwith our users for the reporting itself.\n\n235\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:19.410\nWhat they can expect to see,\nhow often they can expect to see it.\n\n236\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.030\nAnd we want something that's\ngoing to be customizable for\n\n237\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.040\nour users view but we also want something\n\n238\n00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.210\nthat we can deliver consistently too\nthat means something to us as well.\n\n239\n00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.990\nJust remember that you have\nto have the right content for\n\n240\n00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.490\nthe right audience, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:39.550\nYou're senior your management is not\ninterested in technical details at\n\n242\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.690\nexactly what went wrong with what\nparticular portion of the one.\n\n243\n00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.390\nWhereas your technical team\n\n244\n00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.637\nare not necessarily interested in high\nlevel budgetary predictions, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.440\nSo, language of the audience.\n\n246\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.410\nAll communication must be in\nthe language of the audience, okay?\n\n247\n00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.130\nAnd like I've already said, this is not\nabout the actual metrics themselves.\n\n248\n00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.200\nIf we are just interested\nin the metrics themselves,\n\n249\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:13.430\nthen we get into that realms of compliance\nwith our service level targets.\n\n250\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.890\nAnd we're not here just to prove that\nwe can achieve service level targets.\n\n251\n00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.310\nI've already said in previous sessions,\nand I will carry on saying, probably until\n\n252\n00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:28.380\nmy dying breath, that I don't want to see\ngreen on a SLAM chart or on a RAG chart.\n\n253\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:33.380\nIt's not about compliance,\nit's about our customer perception, and\n\n254\n00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.310\nit's about delivering value.\n\n255\n00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.100\nSo, we have three different\ntypes of metrics and\n\n256\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.830\nI know that I've already mentioned this,\nso this one is a reminder here.\n\n257\n00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.659\nWe have technology metrics that measure\nthose components, so we have process\n\n258\n00:15:49.659 --> 00:15:54.558\nmetrics that measure, say for instance,\nhow quickly we can restore service,\n\n259\n00:15:54.558 --> 00:15:59.041\nand the combination of these will give\nus our end to end service metrics.\n\n260\n00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.526\nBut we're not just interested in quantity.\n\n261\n00:16:02.526 --> 00:16:05.750\nWe're interested in quality, too.\n\n262\n00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.520\nNow, I'm sure that somebody's gonna\nmake me say the big, long word.\n\n263\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.170\nSo I'm gonna say the big\nlong words at the top, okay?\n\n264\n00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.820\nWe've got qualitative examples\nthere that look at quality,\n\n265\n00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.100\nwhich is about customer perception, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.430\nThat's quality, it's about perception.\n\n267\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.590\nAnd there's an example of a CSF and\na KPI underneath that.\n\n268\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:29.468\nAnd then we've got the quantitative,\nwhich is about being able to\n\n269\n00:16:29.468 --> 00:16:33.662\nquantify exactly how our\nservices are being delivered.\n\n270\n00:16:33.662 --> 00:16:37.326\nAnd yet again, we've got a CSF there for\nreducing costs.\n\n271\n00:16:37.326 --> 00:16:39.923\nAnd a KPI, which as an example,\n\n272\n00:16:39.923 --> 00:16:45.550\nwhich will just tell us whether\nwe are actually reducing costs.\n\n273\n00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.820\nAnd so underneath all of those KPIs and\nthe CSFs,\n\n274\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.920\nyou'll see the actual\nmetrics that we need to take.\n\n275\n00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.900\nOne thing that we do have to do is\nmake sure that we have balance in\n\n276\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.390\nour metrics as well.\n\n277\n00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.230\nAnd we spend a lot of time\nlooking at the types of metrics.\n\n278\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:09.780\nBut think about the balance between\nresources, people, and money as well.\n\n279\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:14.612\nThe balance between the functionality\nmetrics too, and between time.\n\n280\n00:17:14.612 --> 00:17:19.535\nAnd so we want metrics that show\nour progress in terms of time along\n\n281\n00:17:19.535 --> 00:17:23.036\nany project, or\neven along any improvement.\n\n282\n00:17:23.036 --> 00:17:28.850\nFor instance, the previous slide\nlooked at a 10% reduction in costs.\n\n283\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.590\nWe also want to show a balance\nbetween that time and\n\n284\n00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.750\nalso the functionality itself.\n\n285\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:40.540\nSo are we delivering that service, and do\nwe have the right number of people, okay?\n\n286\n00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.580\nSo we want to have\na balance in those metrics.\n\n287\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.990\nAnd as it says here, with no balance,\nthen we might focus more on time.\n\n288\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.054\nOr we might focus more on,\nsay, just the functionality.\n\n289\n00:17:54.054 --> 00:17:57.814\nOr we might focus on just saving money,\nfor instance.\n\n290\n00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:03.168\nWhen we're defining KPIs, and by the way,\n\n291\n00:18:03.168 --> 00:18:06.580\nthis happens in service design,\ndon't forget.\n\n292\n00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.540\nIt's one of the things that\nwe design in service design.\n\n293\n00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.120\nWe have to ask ourselves these questions,\nokay?\n\n294\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.627\nI've mentioned in previous\nsessions in CSI about the need for\n\n295\n00:18:17.627 --> 00:18:20.321\ndecision-making with any metric.\n\n296\n00:18:20.321 --> 00:18:23.330\nWe've gotta be able to make a decision,\nokay?\n\n297\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.480\nYou cannot just have a metric just for\nthe sake of having a metric.\n\n298\n00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.550\nAnd because I think so\n\n299\n00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.520\nis not a good enough measurement as\nto whether we've improved or not.\n\n300\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.900\nSo we've gotta have metrics, but these\nmetrics have gotta tell us something.\n\n301\n00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.150\nThey've gotta answer a question,\n\n302\n00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.290\nthey've gotta answer the question\nof what's in it for me.\n\n303\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.700\nAnd they've gotta allow\nus to make a decision.\n\n304\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.400\nSo take a look at the questions\nthat you've got in your notes.\n\n305\n00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.980\nThe questions that you've\ngot in front of you.\n\n306\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.240\nAnd just ask yourselves,\n\n307\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.760\nwhen you define any metric,\ndoes it answer these questions.\n\n308\n00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.606\nHow easy is it to interpret,\nwhy do we want this information?\n\n309\n00:19:01.606 --> 00:19:07.460\nIs it accurate, what about changing it,\ncan I make a change to it?\n\n310\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.963\nCan we actually measure it now, and\ndoes it show us anything valuable?\n\n311\n00:19:11.963 --> 00:19:13.890\nAnd by the way, who owns it?\n\n312\n00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.724\nBecause if somebody's asked for a metric,\nthen they probably want it for a reason.\n\n313\n00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:22.550\nAnd therefore, do we assign them as owner,\nor do we become the owner?\n\n314\n00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.015\nBecause what if somebody else\nwants to use that metric, but\n\n315\n00:19:26.015 --> 00:19:29.566\njust to make a slight tweak to it,\njust slightly different?\n\n316\n00:19:29.566 --> 00:19:34.140\nThen can we do that, or do we have to\ngo back to the original requester?\n\n317\n00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.650\nAll of these are questions\nthat have to be answered.\n\n318\n00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.170\nJust remember the four\nreasons why we measure.\n\n319\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.645\nWe measure to validate that we're\ngoing in the right direction.\n\n320\n00:19:48.755 --> 00:19:52.275\nWe measure to justify, which is what\nI call the see, I told you so metric.\n\n321\n00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:57.131\nYeah, I told you we needed more money,\nI told you we needed more people.\n\n322\n00:19:57.131 --> 00:19:59.175\nAnd we measure to direct and to intervene.\n\n323\n00:19:59.175 --> 00:20:03.681\nAnd if we look at our SLAM charts,\nthat's the amber and the green, or\n\n324\n00:20:03.681 --> 00:20:07.816\nthe yellow and the green,\ndepending on where you live, okay?\n\n325\n00:20:07.816 --> 00:20:10.302\nAnd amber or orange or\nyellow, that's a direction,\n\n326\n00:20:10.302 --> 00:20:11.995\nwe need to do something about that.\n\n327\n00:20:11.995 --> 00:20:15.400\nWhereas the red, that's an intervention,\nsomething's gone wrong.\n\n328\n00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.344\nSo think about why you're\ntaking any metric, and\n\n329\n00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:22.872\nwhat use is it going to be to you.\n\n330\n00:20:22.872 --> 00:20:26.620\nAnd does it allow me to\nmake an informed decision?\n\n331\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.930\nAnd I really like the bottom\nbullet point in this slide,\n\n332\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.350\nwhich talks about outside influences.\n\n333\n00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.439\nAnd it goes back to why we're measuring.\n\n334\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.500\nWe want all of our\nmeasurements to be objective,\n\n335\n00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.000\nwe don't want them to be subjective.\n\n336\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.250\nThe only one that should be subjective\nis the customer satisfaction metric.\n\n337\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.220\nAnd even then,\nwe take a qualitative metric, and\n\n338\n00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.240\nwe turn it into a quantitative metric.\n\n339\n00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.710\nBecause we'll ask our\nquestion to our customers.\n\n340\n00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:59.485\nOn a scale of one to ten, how happy\nare you with this particular service?\n\n341\n00:20:59.485 --> 00:21:01.942\nSo therefore,\nwe've taken the qualitative, and\n\n342\n00:21:01.942 --> 00:21:04.320\nwe've turned it into\nsomething quantitative.\n\n343\n00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.880\nBecause we've asked them to mark\nthis on a scale of one to ten.\n\n344\n00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:15.300\nAlways think about taking a metric that\nis going to allow you to make a decision.\n\n345\n00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.100\nIf you don't have a decision, if you\ndon't know what you're going to do with\n\n346\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.170\na report, then should you\nreally be taking that report?\n\n347\n00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:28.380\nRemember, when we look for tools and\nwe look for our service management tools,\n\n348\n00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:33.440\nwe don't select a tool just because it\ndelivers 500 out-of-the-box reports.\n\n349\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:40.755\nBecause you might not need\n499 of those reports.\n\n350\n00:21:40.755 --> 00:21:44.420\nSo we've looked at metrics, and\nwe've looked at why we take a metric.\n\n351\n00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.300\nAnd we've looked at the type\nof metrics that we take.\n\n352\n00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.186\nAnd as we move into our next session,\nwe're going to start and\n\n353\n00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:54.574\ntake a look at other\nmeasurement sort of techniques.\n\n354\n00:21:54.574 --> 00:21:58.430\nAnd other measurement frameworks,\nsuch as a balance scorecard.\n\n355\n00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.060\nBut for now, what I'd like you\nto do is I want you to make\n\n356\n00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.360\nsure that you feel comfortable\nwith metrics themselves.\n\n357\n00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:09.300\nAnd with the understanding of a CSF and\na KPI, and the difference between the two.\n\n358\n00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.611\nMaybe review back over previous sessions\nover the vision to metrics tree.\n\n359\n00:22:14.611 --> 00:22:19.190\nAnd then if you have any questions,\nour forum's always available for you.\n\n360\n00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.300\nSo please feel free to let us\nknow if you have any questions.\n\n361\n00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.840\nAnd I'll be more than happy\nto answer them for you.\n\n362\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.510\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, thank you again for\nhelping us to take a look at this idea\n\n363\n00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.830\nof the service metrics that we've been\ntalking about, or the service metric.\n\n364\n00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.750\nRealizing that the end-to-end service\n\n365\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.880\nis really what a lot of times\nthe customer is concerned about.\n\n366\n00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.990\nBut also the focus here is\nunderstanding that process and\n\n367\n00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.820\nthat technique that we\nhave available to us.\n\n368\n00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.190\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode.\n\n369\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.020\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n370\n00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.290\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n371\n00:22:53.290 -->

00:00:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another episode\nright here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.110\nYou're watching the ITIL\nintermediate CSI show.\n\n5\n00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.270\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ngonna take a look at what some additional\n\n6\n00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.640\nCSI techniques to help us out here,\nincluding the balanced scorecard.\n\n7\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.706\nWe're gonna also talk about the SWOT\nanalysis, as well as the ROI.\n\n8\n00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:36.367\nAnd here to help us to explain\nall of those different terms,\n\n9\n00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:41.790\nis actually gonna be our scrabble\nmeister herself, yes Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.200\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for\nhaving me, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.820\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, so\nwhen we start to take a look at this.\n\n13\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.160\nYou have just spilled alphabet soup\nall over our lower third there.\n\n14\n00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.633\nSo you're gonna have to help us out and\n\n15\n00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.038\nwhen we talk about these different\ntypes of techniques here.\n\n16\n00:00:57.038 --> 00:01:00.840\nWhy is it so important that we have so\nmany of them Jo?\n\n17\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.680\nIt seems like a lot.\n\n18\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.290\n&gt;&gt; It's really all about\nunderstanding why we're measuring and\n\n19\n00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.500\nI have mentioned in previous sessions and\nI will carry on mentioning the fact that\n\n20\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.030\nwhenever we take any measurement there\nhas to be a reason behind it, and\n\n21\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.930\nwe have to be able to make\nan informed decision.\n\n22\n00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.210\nSo what we're going to do is we're going\nto look at an analysis technique that we\n\n23\n00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.265\nuse to analyze where we are within\nour organization which is SWOT,\n\n24\n00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:32.945\nor otherwise known as strengths,\nweaknesses, opportunities and threats.\n\n25\n00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:36.015\nWe're going to look at balance scorecard\nwhich is gonna be the first thing we're\n\n26\n00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:41.005\ngonna look at which really extends from a\nprevious session where we started looking\n\n27\n00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:45.520\nat service measurements and\nwe looked at metrics and CSFs and KPIs.\n\n28\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.930\nAnd we're gonna carry on by\nlooking at how we view those.\n\n29\n00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.770\nAnd then we're also going to\nlook at return on investment\n\n30\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.210\nversus value on investment as well.\n\n31\n00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.900\nBecause these are two different\nterms that we want to achieve.\n\n32\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.548\nIf we want to achieve a value return\nwhen we make any improvements so\n\n33\n00:02:05.548 --> 00:02:08.868\nreally these are just terms\nthat we would use and\n\n34\n00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:12.363\nthe techniques that we\nwould utilize within CSI.\n\n35\n00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:17.228\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, so with all of these\ndifferent types of tools that we've been\n\n36\n00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:20.950\nusing, techniques,\nwhich one do we need to begin with?\n\n37\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.380\nBecause I don't know if you\nwere to say hey just pick one,\n\n38\n00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.540\nI don't even know which one I would pick.\n\n39\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.040\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nI don't think anybody's got a favorite.\n\n40\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.165\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n41\n00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:36.020\n[LAUGH] Certainly not when it comes to\nbalancing metrics and taking reports.\n\n42\n00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.280\nNobody has a favorite.\n\n43\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.310\nYou find that people either really\nlove statics are reported and\n\n44\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.050\npeople want to run away as quickly\nas possible from reporting.\n\n45\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you.\n\n46\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we want to do is take\na look at this balanced scorecard.\n\n47\n00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.490\nI always say that with ITIL, what we've\ndone is we've taken best practice and\n\n48\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.740\nwe've just articulated it.\n\n49\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.050\nAnd in some ways, we've just taken\ncommon sense and we've written it down.\n\n50\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.043\nThat's what we've done.\n\n51\n00:03:03.043 --> 00:03:08.433\nAnd so, with a balanced scorecard,\nwe've taken the common\n\n52\n00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:13.294\nsense that came out of\nthe mouths of Kaplan and Norton,\n\n53\n00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:19.108\nwhich is all about a balanced\nperspective on our organization and\n\n54\n00:03:19.108 --> 00:03:22.948\non our organization environment itself.\n\n55\n00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:27.580\nIt mentions a kind of prescription\nas to what should be measured.\n\n56\n00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.490\nI don't like the use of the word\nprescription, especially not when it comes\n\n57\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.720\nto ITIL because we'll tell you\nthat this is not prescriptive.\n\n58\n00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.900\nAnd we're not going to tell\nyou how to do everything.\n\n59\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.170\nWe're going to give you\na framework within which to work.\n\n60\n00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.570\nAnd so what we're really trying to tell\nyou is that you've got to consider\n\n61\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.870\neverybody's perspective when it\ncomes to showing your reports and\n\n62\n00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.810\nshowing your metrics.\n\n63\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.560\nNow, if you remember the fact that we have\nto make a decision from any report and\n\n64\n00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.930\nfrom any metric.\n\n65\n00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.400\nIf we're going to take a metric,\n\n66\n00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.010\nthen we need to be able to\nmake a decision from it.\n\n67\n00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.390\nWell, what we're just\ngonna look at here is,\n\n68\n00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.540\nwith this balanced scorecard,\nis the fact that when we take a metric,\n\n69\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.800\nour metrics really need to\nhave a perspective on them.\n\n70\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.170\nOn that perspective if we\nlook at the bottom there,\n\n71\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.140\nin those four bullet points at the bottom.\n\n72\n00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.630\nWe have learning and growth.\n\n73\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.510\nWe have business.\n\n74\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.410\nWe have customer.\n\n75\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.591\nAnd we have financial.\n\n76\n00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:28.924\nYou might think about this\nas categorizing our metrics.\n\n77\n00:04:28.924 --> 00:04:34.000\nNow, we've taken this and\nwe changed this slightly for an IT\n\n78\n00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.240\nperspective on metrics, because instead of\nlearning in growth, we're going to have\n\n79\n00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.110\nan innervation as we call it, because this\nis all about looking into the future.\n\n80\n00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.210\nSo let's take a look at\nthis next slide here, and\n\n81\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.315\nyou'll look at financial, and this is\nreally to do with any financial metrics.\n\n82\n00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:54.920\nOkay.\n\n83\n00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.730\nSo it's all to do with\nunderstanding cost to the business.\n\n84\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.840\nAbout return and investment, we're\ngonna get into that a little bit later.\n\n85\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.860\nAnd then we've got\nthe customer perspective.\n\n86\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.670\nSo we should be showing reports\nthat customers want to see\n\n87\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.490\nin terms of value articulation.\n\n88\n00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.150\nRemember we talk about quality and\nwe talk about performance but\n\n89\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.190\nwe also talk from a customer perspective\nabout value and value is being perceived.\n\n90\n00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.830\nAnd then we've got\nan internal perspective.\n\n91\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.890\nAnd an internal perspective really looks\nat the internal workings of IT, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.410\nSo, the bottom comment there under\nthe internal about accountability\n\n93\n00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.130\nof IT service provision.\n\n94\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.820\nThat's really about how us in IT,\nhow we work.\n\n95\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.590\nThese are our internal metrics.\n\n96\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.570\nAnd then we've got\nan innovation perspective.\n\n97\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.400\nAnd that innovation is all\nabout looking to the future.\n\n98\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.010\nIt's all about growth,\nit's about improvement,\n\n99\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.970\nit's about harnessing\nthe technology as it said,\n\n100\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.840\nthis is about understanding what\nour organization's strategy is and\n\n101\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.505\nlooking for innovative ways to be\nable to achieve that strategy.\n\n102\n00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:09.295\nNow, you could argue that it's very,\n\n103\n00:06:09.295 --> 00:06:14.055\nvery difficult to demonstrate\ninnovation in metrics.\n\n104\n00:06:14.055 --> 00:06:18.335\nWell, I'm gonna bring in the concept\nof both leading and trailing metrics.\n\n105\n00:06:20.132 --> 00:06:25.662\nA trailing metric is a metric\nof a performance in the past.\n\n106\n00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:30.572\nSo a trailing metric would be\nsomething along the lines of,\n\n107\n00:06:30.572 --> 00:06:34.512\nwe've got a 90% incident\nresolution rate within\n\n108\n00:06:35.632 --> 00:06:41.600\nfour hours for priority one incidents\nover the last three months.\n\n109\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.517\nAnd that's the key over the last\nthree months or over the last year or\n\n110\n00:06:45.517 --> 00:06:49.227\nover the last week,\nthat's what we call a trailing metric, and\n\n111\n00:06:49.227 --> 00:06:51.375\nthat's a metric that looks behind.\n\n112\n00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:55.880\nAnd when you think about it in IT, and\ncertainly when we look at metrics that\n\n113\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.316\nwe've looked at in previous sections,\nwell acctually they've all been\n\n114\n00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:03.910\ntrailing metrics,\nthey've all looked at how we perform.\n\n115\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.110\nBut what about our future metrics?\n\n116\n00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.830\nWhat about those metrics that look\nat how we are going to perform?\n\n117\n00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.710\nYou might consider that to be innovation,\nand our plans,\n\n118\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.260\nour availability plans and our capacity\nplans, they're part of our innovation.\n\n119\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.572\nYou could ask the question,\nwhy do we need to have leading metrics?\n\n120\n00:07:25.572 --> 00:07:30.120\nBecause surely previous metrics will\ntell us how we have preformed, and\n\n121\n00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.920\ntherefore we can use that to the future,\ncan't we?\n\n122\n00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.170\nWell yeah we can, but\n\n123\n00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:39.330\nthen that in itself is a leading metric\nbecause it's predicting the future.\n\n124\n00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.950\nSo a leading metric would be something\nthat looks at say estimated,\n\n125\n00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.680\nwell it shouldn't be estimated\nit should be planned,\n\n126\n00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.430\nnumber of staff on the service\ndesk on a Monday morning.\n\n127\n00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.640\nYou know, a schedule for next week is\nwhat we would call a leading metric,\n\n128\n00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.256\nsomething that looks to the future.\n\n129\n00:07:59.256 --> 00:08:04.788\nSo we have these leading metrics, they\nwould appear in that innovation section\n\n130\n00:08:04.788 --> 00:08:10.157\nwhereas a lot of the Other sections would\npotentially be trailing metrics but\n\n131\n00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:14.700\nthen our budget, which is\na financial perspective, is actually\n\n132\n00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.060\na leading metric because that's how\nmuch money have we got to spend.\n\n133\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.350\nWhereas, our account and\nhow we have spent our money and\n\n134\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.320\nwhere we've spent our money, well, that's\nwhat we call a trailing metric because\n\n135\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.567\nthat's how much money have we spent.\n\n136\n00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:34.492\nSo as you see, it's not actually\nimpossible to look at leading metrics as\n\n137\n00:08:34.492 --> 00:08:39.010\nwell as trailing metrics and yet we always\nthink about what's happened in the past.\n\n138\n00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.660\nBut this balance scorecard\nbrings them together and\n\n139\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.681\nthis balance scorecard looks\nat the different perspectives.\n\n140\n00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:51.253\nAnd that's the different perspectives that\nall of our stakeholders are interested in,\n\n141\n00:08:51.253 --> 00:08:56.375\nwhether that be money, whether it be our\ncustomers that are interested in value,\n\n142\n00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:59.197\nwhether it be internal\nIT that are interested\n\n143\n00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:03.040\nin say OLA performance as\nopposed to SLA performance, etc.\n\n144\n00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.570\nSo that brings us on to\nour next technique then.\n\n145\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.488\nAnd our next technique is\nwhat we call a SWOT analysis.\n\n146\n00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:14.487\nAnd a SWOT analysis is where we look\nat strengths and weaknesses and\n\n147\n00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:16.728\nopportunities and threats.\n\n148\n00:09:16.728 --> 00:09:18.145\nAnd that's why we call it SWOT.\n\n149\n00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:25.780\nAnd a SWOT analysis is really where, very\nsimilar to the previous format actually.\n\n150\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.950\nWe're going to take a table, and\nwe're gonna divide it into four.\n\n151\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.275\nAnd we're going to list our organization,\nor our team's strengths,\n\n152\n00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:37.900\nthat their opportunities, and\ntheir weaknesses, and their threats.\n\n153\n00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.230\nThe first thing, though,\n\n154\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:44.770\nthat we've got to do is we've got\nto work out what our goal is.\n\n155\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.680\nWhy are we taking this SWOT analysis?\n\n156\n00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.919\nCuz you don't just perform\na SWOT analysis for no reason.\n\n157\n00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:57.030\nIf we were looking at say, say for\ninstance we were evaluating my\n\n158\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.040\nability to be able to consult\nin an external environment.\n\n159\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.030\nOr my ability to be able to appear\non TV and present something.\n\n160\n00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.400\nThen, we would want to\nlook at my strengths.\n\n161\n00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.740\nWell, some of my strengths involve\nthe fact that I'm very, very good at wood\n\n162\n00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:20.690\nworking, and that I was able to make all\nof our deck furniture on our deck at home.\n\n163\n00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.422\nThat could be considered to be a strength.\n\n164\n00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:26.370\nBut what relevance does that\nhave on my ability to be\n\n165\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.370\nable to talk to you right now?\n\n166\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.890\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\n167\n00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.680\nHas no relevance at all.\n\n168\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.450\nAnd so, the simple fact is that when we\nconduct a SWOT analysis, like any other\n\n169\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:41.570\nmetrics, they have to be completely\nrelevant to the goal that we have in mind.\n\n170\n00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:49.190\nThe idea is that we can highlight our\nstrengths, we understand our weaknesses,\n\n171\n00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.620\nbut then we look externally\nbeyond our environment, and\n\n172\n00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.400\nwe look for opportunities, and we look for\n\n173\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.600\nany elements that might\nthreaten those opportunities.\n\n174\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.770\nSo the strengths and weaknesses,\nthat's an internal perspective.\n\n175\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.120\nThat's looking at us.\n\n176\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.300\nThat's looking at our team,\nat our department, and\n\n177\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.750\nthat's saying,\nthese are our internal strengths.\n\n178\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.690\nAnd these are our internal weaknesses.\n\n179\n00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.660\nAnd then, we look outside.\n\n180\n00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.540\nWe look externally to\nour current environment.\n\n181\n00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.970\nDepending on the scale cuz that\nreally is entirely dependent on\n\n182\n00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.590\nwhat we're performing the analysis on.\n\n183\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.020\nAnd externally we say, so\nwhat are our opportunities?\n\n184\n00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.820\nWhat is this for us to grow into?\n\n185\n00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.260\nWhat is the new for us to expand into?\n\n186\n00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.330\nAnd our threats are on what could prevent\nus from doing that from an external\n\n187\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.860\nperspective.\n\n188\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.900\nAnd we can also perform SWOT\nanalysis on services, we can perform\n\n189\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.970\nSWOT analysis on our process as well,\nprocesses so, as well too.\n\n190\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.570\nJust remember that you\nhave to have an end state.\n\n191\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.200\nYou have to know what\nyou're measuring against.\n\n192\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.150\nYou also have to be very,\nvery careful not to confuse opportunities,\n\n193\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.800\nin other words, what we can grow into,\nwith what we're good at right now.\n\n194\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.485\nBecause what we can grow into is external,\n\n195\n00:12:19.485 --> 00:12:23.960\nwhereas what we're good at right\nnow is very much internal.\n\n196\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.690\nAnd don't forget that an opportunity\nis something that we might grow into.\n\n197\n00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.090\nIt's not a strategy.\n\n198\n00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:38.230\nA strategy is a very firm\ndirection on where we are going.\n\n199\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.760\nWhereas, an opportunity is\nsomething that we might get into.\n\n200\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.028\nSo it's something that we\nmight take advantage of,\n\n201\n00:12:47.028 --> 00:12:49.415\nsomething that we might expand into.\n\n202\n00:12:49.415 --> 00:12:57.170\nWhereas, a strategy is a very clear\ndirection on what we are going to achieve.\n\n203\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:03.360\nSo a strategy might be to become\nmore reliant on mobile technology.\n\n204\n00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.260\nThat's a strategy.\n\n205\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.520\nSomething that we're going to achieve.\n\n206\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.610\nBut an opportunity might be to\nexpand into a different marketplace.\n\n207\n00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.298\nThat's an opportunity.\n\n208\n00:13:13.298 --> 00:13:18.120\nThe strategy is what we want to do.\n\n209\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.120\nSo that's the SWOT analysis,\nvery, very simply.\n\n210\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.210\nJust remember that with a SWOT analysis,\n\n211\n00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.630\nyou have to work out what it is you're\ntrying to achieve first of all.\n\n212\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:31.240\nIn other words, the purpose of the SWOT,\njust because I'm good at building\n\n213\n00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.810\ndeck furniture doesn't mean that it makes\nme very good at talking to you right now.\n\n214\n00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.886\nSo let's talk about this other acronym\nthat we used because as Ronnie mentioned\n\n215\n00:13:41.886 --> 00:13:45.417\nthere, there was a kinda\nalphabet soup going on there, but\n\n216\n00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:48.265\nit's just that I like acronyms,\nthat's all.\n\n217\n00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:53.021\nAnd so, we look at ROI, well,\nactually, I want to bring in\n\n218\n00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:58.370\nanother acronym as well and\nthat is VOI, value on the investment.\n\n219\n00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.990\nBefore we make any improvement,\nabsolutely any improvement at all,\n\n220\n00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.260\nwe have to understand what\nwe're going to get out of it.\n\n221\n00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.580\nAnd [LAUGH] as it says up there on that\nslide just because it sounds like a good\n\n222\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.300\ndoesn't mean that it is a good idea.\n\n223\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.800\nWe have to make sure that we're going\nto get something tangible out of it.\n\n224\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.810\nSo when we make any improvement,\n\n225\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.960\nwe're looking to identify\na return on that investment.\n\n226\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.854\nBut that return doesn't\nnecessarily have to be financial.\n\n227\n00:14:27.854 --> 00:14:31.860\nIt could be a value on investment.\n\n228\n00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.920\nSo for instance,\nadherence to corporate policies or\n\n229\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.975\nadherence to legislative requirements,\nI still can't say that word by the way.\n\n230\n00:14:40.975 --> 00:14:44.390\n[LAUGH] Adherence to\nlegislative requirements or\n\n231\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.190\nadherence to regulations for instance.\n\n232\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.550\nThat would be considered to\nbe a value on investment.\n\n233\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.840\nAnd not necessarily financial return.\n\n234\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:59.070\nBut most improvements we can articulate in\nterms of financial return on investment.\n\n235\n00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.440\nSo let's take a look at the justification,\nfor instance,\n\n236\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.490\nthe cost of doing the rework, the cost of\nredundant work, the cost of late delivery,\n\n237\n00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:12.580\netc., all of these form\npart of a return on that\n\n238\n00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.810\ninvestment because if we're saving money,\nand that's what we mean by cost\n\n239\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.370\nhere in this instance, if we're saving\nmoney then there's a financial return.\n\n240\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:31.137\nRemember that all of our return\non investment statements for\n\n241\n00:15:31.137 --> 00:15:38.222\nany new project, have to be\narticulated in the business case.\n\n242\n00:15:38.222 --> 00:15:41.778\nNow, the business case is a document,\nit's a justification for\n\n243\n00:15:41.778 --> 00:15:46.112\nsignificant IT of expenditure and we\nexpand further on that in service strategy\n\n244\n00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.958\nwhen we look at the financial\nmanagement process and\n\n245\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.950\nalso the business relationship\nmanagement process.\n\n246\n00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.918\nBut just think about who the audience\nis for your business case.\n\n247\n00:15:58.918 --> 00:16:03.894\nIt depends on the size of the project,\nthe size of the improvement project,\n\n248\n00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:07.106\njust how large that business\ncase is going to be.\n\n249\n00:16:07.106 --> 00:16:09.372\nHow much money is going to be spent and\n\n250\n00:16:09.372 --> 00:16:12.452\ntherefore who would approve\nthat business case.\n\n251\n00:16:12.452 --> 00:16:16.183\nSo approvals for the business case\ncould be the business executives.\n\n252\n00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:18.280\nIt could be the board of directors.\n\n253\n00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.080\nIt could be the Chief Financial Officer,\nor it could be the IT steering group.\n\n254\n00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.420\nBut remember who the audience is.\n\n255\n00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.860\nBecause, as I've mentioned\nin quite a few sessions,\n\n256\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.240\nour communication needs to be\nin the language of the audience.\n\n257\n00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.500\nIt is no good telling somebody\nin our board of directorship,\n\n258\n00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.388\nour executive board.\n\n259\n00:16:37.388 --> 00:16:42.330\nIt's not good telling them all of the\ntechnical nuances of our infrastructure.\n\n260\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.510\nBecause quite simply,\nit's not their role to understand that.\n\n261\n00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.580\nBut at the same time,\nif we're asking for a process manager or\n\n262\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.080\na service owner to sign something off.\n\n263\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.640\nThen we don't want to necessarily tell\nthem all the intricacies of the ways of\n\n264\n00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.010\nworking of our executive board.\n\n265\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:04.450\nBecause, again, they don't\nnecessarily need to understand that.\n\n266\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.660\nSo ensure that we have,\nwhen compiling a business case,\n\n267\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.030\nthe right target audience in mind.\n\n268\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.940\nFor the level of change, and for\nthe actual business case itself.\n\n269\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.880\nAnd also,\nwe need to ensure that we are articulating\n\n270\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.160\na potential return on investment\nin the right language.\n\n271\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.130\nAnd that's the language of the audience.\n\n272\n00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.040\nNow, we have two types\nof return on investment.\n\n273\n00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.212\nWe have the pre-program ROI,\nand the post-program ROI.\n\n274\n00:17:35.212 --> 00:17:38.600\nThe pre-program ROI is what\nappears in the business case.\n\n275\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.078\nThat's the expected return on investment.\n\n276\n00:17:43.078 --> 00:17:46.390\nThe post-program ROI is what happens\n\n277\n00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.330\nafter an improvement initiative\nhas been implemented.\n\n278\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.790\nGenerally, after a set\nperiod of time as well.\n\n279\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.130\nIt's not just something that you do\nimmediately after implementation.\n\n280\n00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.810\nUsually you might calculate this\nmaybe a month afterwards, and\n\n281\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.960\nthen again three months, and\nthen again six months afterwards.\n\n282\n00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.570\nAnd that's what we call post-program ROI.\n\n283\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.780\nIn other words, after we've implemented.\n\n284\n00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.114\nAnd as it says there in the second\nfrom last bullet point,\n\n285\n00:18:11.114 --> 00:18:14.031\nthat sufficient time has\ngot to elapse in order for\n\n286\n00:18:14.031 --> 00:18:17.801\nus to be able to see whether\nwe've realized post-program ROI.\n\n287\n00:18:17.801 --> 00:18:22.349\nSo the pre-prorgram ROI is what\nappears in our business case.\n\n288\n00:18:22.349 --> 00:18:26.889\nAnd the post-program ROI is\nwhat we calculate after we've\n\n289\n00:18:26.889 --> 00:18:29.351\nimplemented the improvement.\n\n290\n00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:33.808\nAnd it's that post-program ROI\nwill tell us how accurate our\n\n291\n00:18:33.808 --> 00:18:36.471\npre-program ROI calculation was.\n\n292\n00:18:36.471 --> 00:18:41.183\nNow, there's a really simplistic\ncalculation there in that last bullet\n\n293\n00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:42.310\npoint.\n\n294\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.990\nAnd, for\n\n295\n00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.538\nthose of you that are not familiar\nwith financial management techniques.\n\n296\n00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:53.570\nIf you aren't looking to go to the CSI\nexamination and testing at the end\n\n297\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.240\nof this class, then believe me, you don't\nhave to remember this calculation, okay.\n\n298\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.471\nThis is a very simple calculation that we\nwould use from a very, very high level.\n\n299\n00:19:03.471 --> 00:19:08.071\nIn truth, we're probably going to use a\nmuch more complex calculation in the real\n\n300\n00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:12.420\nworld for calculating both the pre-program\nROI and the post-program ROI.\n\n301\n00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.239\nAnd we're gonna get information for\ncalculating pre-program ROI from\n\n302\n00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:21.273\nprevious projects,\nbecause that's gonna help us, okay?\n\n303\n00:19:21.273 --> 00:19:25.891\nHaving all of that information\nwithin financial management,\n\n304\n00:19:25.891 --> 00:19:30.680\nthey should be able to highlight\nwhere we can achieve our ROI, and\n\n305\n00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.785\ninstances where we can't.\n\n306\n00:19:32.785 --> 00:19:38.580\nAnd as I've mentioned, this ROI,\nwell that appears in a business case.\n\n307\n00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.450\nNow, a couple of things that I want\nto mention about a business case.\n\n308\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:47.800\nAnd a business case is a justification for\na significant item of expenditure.\n\n309\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.600\nAnd the level of approval is completely\ndependent on the scale of the project.\n\n310\n00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.010\nA business case is a document, and\nas such, has to have an owner.\n\n311\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.130\nNow we'll say that it's\nthe responsibility for\n\n312\n00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.192\nan actual management to\ncompile the business case.\n\n313\n00:20:01.192 --> 00:20:04.210\nBut never-the-less, there's going to\nbe involvement certainly from business\n\n314\n00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.230\nrelationship management,\nfrom strategy management,\n\n315\n00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.440\nfrom service portfolio management,\nand from CSI as well.\n\n316\n00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.450\nBecause anything that we bring in,\nany new service, or any new process, or\n\n317\n00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:22.070\nany new tool is going to be an improvement\nin our current infrastructure.\n\n318\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.890\nSo a business case will\nhave to be compiled.\n\n319\n00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.160\nThe level of detail contained\nwithin the business case, well,\n\n320\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.980\nthat's completely dependent on the scale\nof the actual improvement project.\n\n321\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.670\nAnd the one thing that I really want\nto mention about the business case,\n\n322\n00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:42.240\nis the business case should contain\nboth methods and assumptions.\n\n323\n00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:49.320\nAnd recommendations and\nalternatives, including the risks.\n\n324\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:54.064\nAnd that's the risk of not implementing\na particular recommendation, and\n\n325\n00:20:54.064 --> 00:20:57.039\nthe risk to the organization\nof implementing.\n\n326\n00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:59.610\nThere's always going to be a risk.\n\n327\n00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:04.330\nWhen we bring anything new into\nan environment, there's a risk of failure.\n\n328\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.450\nThere's a risk of impact to\nthe current infrastructure.\n\n329\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.210\nWe can't just bury our\nhead in the sands and\n\n330\n00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.030\nforget that that's not going to happen,\nbecause it is.\n\n331\n00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:16.550\nSo we have to demonstrate that we\nhave calculated that risk, and\n\n332\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.270\nthat we understand the risk,\nand it's okay.\n\n333\n00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:23.870\nWe're doing risk management on those\nparticular risks that we've identified.\n\n334\n00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.810\nSo Ronnie, what we've looked at\nthen over this last session,\n\n335\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.677\nis we've looked at the balance scorecard.\n\n336\n00:21:30.677 --> 00:21:34.883\nAnd we have looked at the strengths,\nand weaknesses, and opportunities, and\n\n337\n00:21:34.883 --> 00:21:35.463\nthreats.\n\n338\n00:21:35.463 --> 00:21:36.640\nNow you see why we used the acronym.\n\n339\n00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.909\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's so much easier.\n\n340\n00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:42.360\nAnd we've looked at ROI, and\nalso value on investments as well.\n\n341\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.927\nAnd in the next section, we're going to\n\n342\n00:21:44.927 --> 00:21:49.620\nlook at improvement techniques that\nare undertaken by other processes.\n\n343\n00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.880\nSuch as availability management,\nproblem management, etc.\n\n344\n00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:00.560\nBut for now, what we'd like you to do, is\nwe'd like you to go back over your notes.\n\n345\n00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.010\nThere are some exercises there for\n\n346\n00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.830\nyou that will help you understand all of\nthe techniques that we've looked at in\n\n347\n00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:10.960\nthe previous few sections to\ndo with metrics and reporting.\n\n348\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.690\nAnd as always, if you have any\nquestions on any of those exercises,\n\n349\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.610\nthen please feel free to\njoin us in the forum where\n\n350\n00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.880\nI'll be happy to answer any of\nthe questions that you have.\n\n351\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.840\nAll right, Jo, well thank you again for\n\n352\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.820\nhelping us out with taking a look at\nthe idea of the balance score card.\n\n353\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:33.330\nAs well as the swot analysis that we have,\nand even the return on investment.\n\n354\n00:22:33.330 -->

Also she describes the CFIA which helps to identify potential point of failure before they occur.  She contrasts this with FTA which is based on technology and topology that looks at the past.  Jo also describes SFA to help with end to end service availability and the Expanded incident Lifecycleâ€”Detect,Diagnose,Repair, Recover and Restoration).",

00:00:08.236\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:11.868\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:16.110\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.890\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.550\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we're actually jumping in and\n\n8\n00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.840\nwe're taking a look at CSI and\nAvailability Management.\n\n9\n00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.115\nAnd here to help us once more is going\nto be well our ITIL ninja master.\n\n10\n00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.065\nThe master herself, Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:35.475\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.997\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Ronnie,\nit's great to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:41.635\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, we've been taking a look\nall these different techniques and\n\n14\n00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:46.975\nthere is a bit more for us to actually\ntake a look at and to talk about as well.\n\n15\n00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:50.655\nSo let's talk about this idea\nof Availability Management and\n\n16\n00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:54.370\nits importance in this process of\ncontinually service improvement.\n\n17\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nWell, Availability Management is a process\n\n18\n00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.080\nthat we looked at in service design, and\n\n19\n00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.760\nit's a process that's\nsplit into two parts.\n\n20\n00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.820\nIt's split into both proactive and\nreactive.\n\n21\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.950\nAnd proactively, we are planning for\navailability in our new services, and\n\n22\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.650\nalso in our existing\nservices going forward,\n\n23\n00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.290\nat least once a year we\nproduce an availability plan.\n\n24\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.690\nAnd reactively,\nwe're assisting incident and\n\n25\n00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.860\nproblem management with any\navailability related issues.\n\n26\n00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.400\nYou see, what Availability Management does\nis look for potential points of failure.\n\n27\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.380\nAnd Availability Management looks\nat reliability of our components.\n\n28\n00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.130\nAnd it looks at potential\nredundancy options.\n\n29\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.420\nSo performance risk management for\nthe components within our service.\n\n30\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.900\nSo looking at both future services, and\n\n31\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.260\nalso at our existing services, and\nplanning for Availability Management.\n\n32\n00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.890\nNow, Ronnie, in a previous section you\nmentioned to me about alphabet soup.\n\n33\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n34\n00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.438\n&gt;&gt; Well I want you to take a look at what\nwe have in brackets, or in parenthesis,\n\n35\n00:01:58.438 --> 00:01:59.430\nright in front of you now.\n\n36\n00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.172\n&gt;&gt; Once more, yep.\n\n37\n00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:03.700\n&gt;&gt; And we brought in a few more.\n\n38\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.050\nJust to keep you happy really.\n\n39\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.617\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I didn't want you feeling\n\n40\n00:02:06.617 --> 00:02:07.638\nleft out in this section.\n\n41\n00:02:07.638 --> 00:02:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Love it.\n\n42\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.779\n&gt;&gt; What we're gonna be doing,\nis we're gonna be looking in\n\n43\n00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.515\nthis particular section here\nat all of those acronyms.\n\n44\n00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:16.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be looking at techniques\n\n45\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.540\nthat Availability Management uses\nto identify what we call SPOFs.\n\n46\n00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.090\nS P O F, I know, it's another acronym,\nright, I'm sorry.\n\n47\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.680\nAnd SPOF is a Single Point of Failure.\n\n48\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.670\nBecause what we're interested in is\nidentifying those points of failure,\n\n49\n00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.750\nevaluating those points of failure,\nand evaluating the risk.\n\n50\n00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.590\nIn other words,\n\n51\n00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.940\nthe likelihood of whether those\nparticular points of failure will fail.\n\n52\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.200\nNow, sometimes we look to the past and\nwe say, has it failed in the past.\n\n53\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.260\nThen, if it has,\n\n54\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.520\nthen there could be an increased\nlikelihood of it failing in the future.\n\n55\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.590\nBut sometimes we just don't know,\nand so we have to try and identify\n\n56\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.190\npotential points of failure even in our\nnew services and in our existing ones.\n\n57\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.980\nAnd just say well, you know what,\nthis is an exposure.\n\n58\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.630\nAnd so, we're gonna use various\ntechniques in order to try and\n\n59\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.410\nincrease the availability of our services.\n\n60\n00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.612\nSo why aren't we looking\nat this in service design?\n\n61\n00:03:14.612 --> 00:03:15.251\nWell, we do.\n\n62\n00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:20.599\nBut as part of CSI, Continual Service\nImprovement, because we acknowledge\n\n63\n00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.470\nthat everything that we do in\nAvailability Management is to improve.\n\n64\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.520\nNow, sometimes when we're\nperforming risk management,\n\n65\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.040\nwe might decide that we\njust want to accept a risk.\n\n66\n00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.660\nBut here we're looking at improvement.\n\n67\n00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.320\nSo here we're looking\nat identifying risks.\n\n68\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.770\nWe're looking at identifying\npoints of failure.\n\n69\n00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.240\nAnd we're looking at the options that\nare available to us, to try and mitigate\n\n70\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.980\neither against those risks or mitigate\nagainst the effects of those risks.\n\n71\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.820\nOr maybe just helps us with\nrisk management itself.\n\n72\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.084\nSee, so that last bullet point about\nhelping an organization recognize where\n\n73\n00:03:58.084 --> 00:03:59.579\nthey can add value, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.723\nSo it's all about Availability Management.\n\n75\n00:04:02.723 --> 00:04:08.350\nAnd in following sessions, we're going\nto look at links between CSI and\n\n76\n00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.514\nother processes within\nthe ITIL service life cycle.\n\n77\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.030\nSo let's take that alphabet soup,\nthen, and let's start off with one.\n\n78\n00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.890\nAnd I'm gonna start off with CFIA,\n\n79\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.370\nor Component Failure Impact Analysis,\nit is called.\n\n80\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.440\nAnd it simply says there that\nit's necessary to predict and\n\n81\n00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.380\nvalue a potential impact on\navailability from a component failure.\n\n82\n00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.899\nWhat we're gonna do is we're going to take\na look at a network topology diagram.\n\n83\n00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.538\nAnd we are going to remove a component.\n\n84\n00:04:41.538 --> 00:04:45.910\nAnd we're gonna say, if this component\nfails, I'm gonna put a big red\n\n85\n00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.510\nX through it, if this component fails,\nwhat's going to happen?\n\n86\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.560\nWhat is the impact to our\norganization going to be?\n\n87\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.520\nThat's what\nComponent Failure Impact Analysis does.\n\n88\n00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.690\nAnd why do we do this?\n\n89\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.260\nWell, we do this because\nwhat we want to do\n\n90\n00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.580\nis identify potential point of failures,\n\n91\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.410\nwe've already ascertained that, but\nthen what we want to do is see the impact.\n\n92\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.520\nAnd the impact will then allow us to\nmake a decision as to whether we add\n\n93\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.500\nin resilience options such as mirroring or\nredundancy or\n\n94\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.360\nwhether we just want to accept that risk.\n\n95\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.700\nSo, let's take a look\nat the next slide then.\n\n96\n00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.530\nAnd the next slide actually shows us,\n\n97\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.400\nin this particular network topology\ndiagram, a very, very basic one.\n\n98\n00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.800\nWe're looking at two\ndifferent services here.\n\n99\n00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.320\nAnd these are how\nthe services hang together.\n\n100\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.500\nNow, what you've got here in the right\nhand side, in the box there,\n\n101\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.360\nyou've got next to each PC, you've got\neither an M or an X or an A, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.215\nAnd then M talks about\na manual intervention.\n\n103\n00:05:53.215 --> 00:05:57.595\nAnd a manual intervention means that,\nif that component fails,\n\n104\n00:05:57.595 --> 00:06:02.515\nthere has to be a manual intervention\nto switch over to another component.\n\n105\n00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:08.515\nSo, for service one, to switch from PC one\nto PC two would me a manual intervention.\n\n106\n00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.570\nNow, we also got X's and we've got A's.\n\n107\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.990\nNow, the A stands for automatic,\nautomatic intervention.\n\n108\n00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.830\nSo if we come down in service one,\n\n109\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.640\nyou'll see right down near the bottom\nto switch from disk 1 to disk 2 well,\n\n110\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.220\nactually there is an automatic\nswitch between those two disks.\n\n111\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.830\nSo if one fails there's\nan automatic switch.\n\n112\n00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.110\nBut everywhere where there is an X,\nthere's an exposure.\n\n113\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.990\nAnd an exposure means that there may\nnot be a resilience option in place.\n\n114\n00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.580\nThere may not be any redundancy.\n\n115\n00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.220\nAnd so what that means is, we have to\nconsider what we do in that instance.\n\n116\n00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.180\nWhether we add in redundancy or not.\n\n117\n00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.240\nNow, there are some blank and that blank\nsection really simply means that we\n\n118\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.610\ndon't need redundancy between\napplication one and two.\n\n119\n00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.120\nWe don't need redundancy because\napplication one is for service one and\n\n120\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.530\napplication two is for service two and,\n\n121\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.290\ntherefore, we shouldn't have fail\nover between the two anyway.\n\n122\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.890\nObviously, because they're different\nservices, and in different applications.\n\n123\n00:07:17.076 --> 00:07:21.670\nSo the X is where we've got potential\nexposures, and the Xs actually allow us\n\n124\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.810\nto not only identify those exposures,\n\n125\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.930\nbut now we can make decisions as to what\nwe want to do about those exposures.\n\n126\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:37.410\nSo between switch one and switch two,\nwell, switch two's not even on there.\n\n127\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.160\nSo, is there\n\n128\n00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:45.290\nany type of intervention required\nbetween switch one and switch two?\n\n129\n00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.564\nI'm guessing not because I don't see\nswitch one and switch two there.\n\n130\n00:07:48.564 --> 00:07:52.456\nSo maybe we can't actually move\nfrom switch one to switch two.\n\n131\n00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:57.071\nSo maybe we need to add in some resilience\nin switch one because If switch one,\n\n132\n00:07:57.071 --> 00:08:01.650\nthere's nothing or there's no\nredundancy there against switch one.\n\n133\n00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.750\nThen that means that those two PCs,\n\n134\n00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.540\nif that switch fails, those two\nPCs cannot access either service.\n\n135\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.460\nSo it allows us to make decisions it\ndoesn't make the decisions for us.\n\n136\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.620\nAnd none of these techniques\nare gonna make decisions for us.\n\n137\n00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.010\nBut it allows us to highlight\npotential points of failure.\n\n138\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.780\nNow the same could be said for\nFault Tree Analysis.\n\n139\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.460\nAnd Fault Tree Analysis looks\nat what's already happened.\n\n140\n00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.190\nSo what has caused a disruption and\n\n141\n00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:37.700\nsays okay then, what events were\nthey that caused this disruption?\n\n142\n00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.007\nAnd we look at different types of\nevents here such as basic events, or\n\n143\n00:08:42.007 --> 00:08:46.466\nresulting events or a conditional\nevent that only occurs under certain\n\n144\n00:08:46.466 --> 00:08:51.390\nconditions through a trigger event,\nsomething that triggers other events.\n\n145\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:56.558\nOkay let's take a look then at\nthis particular diagram here.\n\n146\n00:08:56.558 --> 00:09:00.143\nSo I'm gonna start off\nwith the top here and\n\n147\n00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:05.628\nthe service was down okay, so\nwhat caused the service to be down?\n\n148\n00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:09.964\nWell, by the way, just as an aside there,\nit was outside of service hours, so\n\n149\n00:09:09.964 --> 00:09:11.805\nis that really important?\n\n150\n00:09:11.805 --> 00:09:14.175\nWell, the service is down, so yes, it is.\n\n151\n00:09:14.175 --> 00:09:16.997\nSo, okay, the service was down,\nbecause the system was down.\n\n152\n00:09:16.997 --> 00:09:19.117\nSo why was the system down?\n\n153\n00:09:19.117 --> 00:09:22.647\nWell it either could've been because\nthe server was down or the application,\n\n154\n00:09:22.647 --> 00:09:25.127\nthe software was not available.\n\n155\n00:09:25.127 --> 00:09:27.097\nOr it was because the network was done.\n\n156\n00:09:27.097 --> 00:09:29.067\nSo then we'll carry on and we'll say okay,\n\n157\n00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:31.313\nwell, it was the network\nthat was actually down.\n\n158\n00:09:31.313 --> 00:09:34.268\nOkay, why was the network down?\n\n159\n00:09:34.268 --> 00:09:36.378\nWell, was it either a primary line, or\n\n160\n00:09:36.378 --> 00:09:40.268\nwas it our backup or\nour fail over line that was down?\n\n161\n00:09:40.268 --> 00:09:44.478\nAnd so what we're doing is\nwe're going down a fault, and\n\n162\n00:09:44.478 --> 00:09:47.008\nwe're saying, okay what caused that?\n\n163\n00:09:47.008 --> 00:09:48.408\nAnd then what caused that?\n\n164\n00:09:48.408 --> 00:09:52.307\nAnd we're just going down\neach particular event and\n\n165\n00:09:52.307 --> 00:09:55.859\nlooking at the cause of\neach particular event.\n\n166\n00:09:55.859 --> 00:09:58.930\nNow this is based on the technology.\n\n167\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.163\nSo this is Fault Tree Analysis and\nit's based on the technology.\n\n168\n00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:05.123\nIt's based again on our network topology,\n\n169\n00:10:05.123 --> 00:10:09.560\nvery similar to the component\nfailure impact analysis.\n\n170\n00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.516\nBut component failure impact\nanalysis was planning for\n\n171\n00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:19.902\nthe future this is looking at\nthe past to plan for the future.\n\n172\n00:10:19.902 --> 00:10:22.317\nAnd then we have service\nfailure analysis or SFA.\n\n173\n00:10:22.317 --> 00:10:25.719\nAnd service failure analysis is very,\n\n174\n00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:30.875\nvery similar to faltery analysis\nwhere we're just looking\n\n175\n00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:36.380\nat end-to-end availability\nof an entire service.\n\n176\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.670\nSo where fault tree analysis looks to\nidentify a particular component that has\n\n177\n00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.730\ncaused a failure, service failure analysis\n\n178\n00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.100\nactually looks at the end-to-end\nservice in its entirety.\n\n179\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.630\nLooks at the end-to-end service and\nsays okay,\n\n180\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:57.270\nwhat could cause a problem\nin that end-to-end service?\n\n181\n00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.010\nAnd you'll see here, and\nI mentioned what could cause a service.\n\n182\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.306\nSo you'll see here that I have\nunderneath this particular diagram here,\n\n183\n00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:08.910\nselected an opportunity.\n\n184\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.360\nIn other words, I've found where there's\nbeen a failure in end-to-end service.\n\n185\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.790\nAnd what I'm going to do,\nis I'm going to scope my analysis,\n\n186\n00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.965\nthen I plan it and I build hypothesis,\nwhich is all about,\n\n187\n00:11:20.965 --> 00:11:24.826\nwell was it caused by this,\nand was it caused by this?\n\n188\n00:11:24.826 --> 00:11:30.192\nWas the failure itself,\ncaused by something very large on,\n\n189\n00:11:30.192 --> 00:11:36.860\nsorry, was the failure itself caused\nby some form of technical issue.\n\n190\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.720\nBut it was compounded by the fact\nthat the incident then wasn't\n\n191\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.070\nresolved quickly enough okay?\n\n192\n00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.390\nSo that's when I build my hypothesis.\n\n193\n00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.523\nAnd my hypothesis will not just be\nbased in the technical components,\n\n194\n00:11:49.523 --> 00:11:51.988\nit will be based on the processes as well.\n\n195\n00:11:51.988 --> 00:11:55.380\nSo my end-to-end service metrics.\n\n196\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.870\nAnd then I analyze the data.\n\n197\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.507\nAnd I might need to interview people,\nI might need to go back to people and\n\n198\n00:12:01.507 --> 00:12:03.600\nask them for their opinion.\n\n199\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.670\nWhy wasn't the incident closed quickly?\n\n200\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.130\nWhy wasn't it resolved quick enough?\n\n201\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.930\nAnd then I draw my conclusions\nbased upon my findings.\n\n202\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.388\nAnd then I make recommendations.\n\n203\n00:12:15.388 --> 00:12:19.898\nAnd those recommendations,\nthey will be by way of a nice,\n\n204\n00:12:19.898 --> 00:12:26.100\npretty picture of a graph and remember\nwe only do that to produce a decision.\n\n205\n00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.440\nAnd that decision that will\nvalidate that actually we made\n\n206\n00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:35.315\nthe right amount of investigation and\nwe undertook the right path\n\n207\n00:12:35.315 --> 00:12:40.210\non that investigation in order to\nbe able to make an improvement.\n\n208\n00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:45.399\nSo the service failure analysis\nlooks at the entire service,\n\n209\n00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:47.808\nthe end-to-end service.\n\n210\n00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:51.887\nFrom a previous section we\ncovered the fact that service,\n\n211\n00:12:51.887 --> 00:12:56.634\nend-to-end service metrics are made\nup of technology metrics and\n\n212\n00:12:56.634 --> 00:13:02.297\nprocessed metrics, combined, to measure\nthe entire end-to-end service and\n\n213\n00:13:02.297 --> 00:13:06.580\nthat is exactly what the service\nfailure analysis does.\n\n214\n00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:12.060\nIs that it takes a look at a failure but\ndoesn't just look at the faulty analysis.\n\n215\n00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.308\nIt doesn't just look at the technology.\n\n216\n00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:19.080\nIt also looks at the processes that\nimpacted on that failure as well.\n\n217\n00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:26.100\nSo now we've got other techniques that we\nuse within availability management, too.\n\n218\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:32.310\nAnd the first is what we call, we call\nthis a TOP, a technical observation post.\n\n219\n00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:36.305\nSo Ronnie if I mention the word TOP\nto you, technical observation post,\n\n220\n00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:37.754\nwhat do you think that is?\n\n221\n00:13:37.754 --> 00:13:42.248\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\nI would assume as somebody that\n\n222\n00:13:42.248 --> 00:13:46.720\ntakes a look at the technology that's\nimplemented and sees if it fits.\n\n223\n00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.140\n&gt;&gt; It's not, it's really basic.\n\n224\n00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.931\nIt's really, really basic and in fact,\n\n225\n00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:56.500\na technical observation post is\nwhere we sit and watch and wait.\n\n226\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.885\n&gt;&gt; Nice\n&gt;&gt; That's a technical observation post.\n\n227\n00:13:59.885 --> 00:14:04.695\nAnd it really just involves a lot\nof technical people sitting,\n\n228\n00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:08.610\nand watching, and waiting for\nsomething to fail.\n\n229\n00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.170\nIt's about monitoring events in realtor.\n\n230\n00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.673\nSometimes we have failures and\n\n231\n00:14:12.673 --> 00:14:15.692\nwe don't actually understand\nwhy something keeps failing.\n\n232\n00:14:15.692 --> 00:14:20.560\nAnd sometimes we just have to wait and\nwatch for it to fail.\n\n233\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.025\nThis is utilized quite\noften when we've had, and\n\n234\n00:14:24.025 --> 00:14:28.078\nI've seen this used in the past,\nmany many years ago now.\n\n235\n00:14:28.078 --> 00:14:30.918\nBut I've seen it used\nvery effectively where in\n\n236\n00:14:30.918 --> 00:14:36.130\none organization a server kept failing,\nand they couldn't understand why.\n\n237\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.584\nOn a Monday morning,\nthey'd come into the office and\n\n238\n00:14:39.584 --> 00:14:41.980\nthe server was always unavailable.\n\n239\n00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.880\nIt was always down and\nthey really couldn't understand why.\n\n240\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.910\nSo what they did was they set up\na technical observation post and\n\n241\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:52.040\nthey actually had somebody working over\nthe weekend, a group of people on shift\n\n242\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.560\nwork and over the weekend,\njust watching to see what would happen.\n\n243\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:01.692\nAnd at one point in time,\non the Sunday morning, the server died.\n\n244\n00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:05.206\nWent offline, completely offline and\nso somebody went and\n\n245\n00:15:05.206 --> 00:15:06.830\nwent into the server room.\n\n246\n00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.555\nThis was a technical observation post,\nthey were sitting waiting for\n\n247\n00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:10.116\nit to happen.\n\n248\n00:15:10.116 --> 00:15:14.907\nThey went in to the server room that\nthe cleaner had unplugged the server to\n\n249\n00:15:14.907 --> 00:15:16.230\nplug in her vacuum.\n\n250\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.502\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n251\n00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:22.862\n&gt;&gt; That would never have been discovered\nby anybody else other than watching\n\n252\n00:15:22.862 --> 00:15:25.884\na video camera,\na video recording of the event, or\n\n253\n00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:28.923\nby somebody watching and\nwaiting for the failure.\n\n254\n00:15:28.923 --> 00:15:32.560\nAnd that is a technical observation,\nsimple as that..\n\n255\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.850\nTechnical people observing.\n\n256\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.658\nOkay, so then that brings me onto the last\ntechnique that we're going to look at in\n\n257\n00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:43.073\navailability management now,\nand that is the expanded or\n\n258\n00:15:43.073 --> 00:15:44.968\nextended incident life cycle.\n\n259\n00:15:44.968 --> 00:15:46.583\nAnd we can call it both.\n\n260\n00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:50.223\nI've seen it called both in the ITIL\npublications and quite happy for\n\n261\n00:15:50.223 --> 00:15:51.112\nyou to use both.\n\n262\n00:15:51.112 --> 00:15:55.446\nAnd really, what we do is,\nit's a technique for\n\n263\n00:15:55.446 --> 00:16:01.371\nanalyzing incidents,\nincidents that have happened in the past,\n\n264\n00:16:01.371 --> 00:16:06.446\nand then working out what we\ncan do in the future to prevent\n\n265\n00:16:06.446 --> 00:16:13.470\nthe incident from being outstanding\nas long, or for being open as long.\n\n266\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.120\nSo let's take a look at the next slide.\n\n267\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.520\nAnd I want you to focus your eyes here,\non this particular section here.\n\n268\n00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:27.000\nWhat we do, this is our downtime,\nthis is when the incident starts.\n\n269\n00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.680\nAnd this is when the incident or\n\n270\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.230\nthe service was restored right here,\nthis particular line here.\n\n271\n00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.030\nSo what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to take that incident.\n\n272\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.080\nAnd we're going to split it into five.\n\n273\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:47.420\nDetection, diagnosis, repair, recovery\nof data, and restoration of service.\n\n274\n00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.360\nNow, what we want to do, is we want to\ntake each one of those sections, and\n\n275\n00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.230\nwe want to reduce the amount of time\n\n276\n00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:01.570\nthat each section took in order\nto advance on to the next.\n\n277\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:08.014\nThereby if we reduce each individual\nsection, detection, diagnosis,\n\n278\n00:17:08.014 --> 00:17:12.804\nrepair, recovery of data and\nrestoration of service to the user,\n\n279\n00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:17.764\nif we reduce each section,\nthen the next time the incident happens,\n\n280\n00:17:17.764 --> 00:17:20.757\nyou'll see here in our downtime, well,\n\n281\n00:17:20.757 --> 00:17:24.635\nit was actually down for\na lot shorter period of time.\n\n282\n00:17:24.635 --> 00:17:29.510\nSo here, in availability management then,\nwe analyze each section and we say, okay\n\n283\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.630\nthen, what can we do to reduce the amount\nof time taken to detect an incident?\n\n284\n00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.140\nWell, we can use event management to\nautomatically detect an incident.\n\n285\n00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.450\nWhat about the amount of time taken\nto diagnose an incident then?\n\n286\n00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.460\nWell, we could use things like script,\nfor instance.\n\n287\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.480\nWhat about the amount of\ntime taken to repair?\n\n288\n00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.710\nWell, sometimes, you can't reduce\nthat time, but sometimes we can.\n\n289\n00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.500\nMaybe we can automate.\n\n290\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.210\nWhat about recovery of data?\n\n291\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.049\nWell, if we could get quicker\naccess to backups, for instance,\n\n292\n00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:02.710\nmaybe we could recover data quicker.\n\n293\n00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.990\nAnd what about restoration\nof service to the user?\n\n294\n00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.840\nDon't forget in incident management,\nwe have to confirm with\n\n295\n00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.920\nthe user that they're happy\nthat service has been restored.\n\n296\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.740\nSo maybe in the service level agreement,\n\n297\n00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.100\nwe incorporate the three strikes and\nout rule.\n\n298\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.270\nWe don't want to keep pass them in you and\n\n299\n00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.560\nkeep ringing you every 30 minutes to\nsee whether service has been restored.\n\n300\n00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.640\nSo what we're going to do is we're going\nto say, well, we tried to call you twice.\n\n301\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.910\nAnd then, we sent you an email, and so\nnow we're gonna close the incident.\n\n302\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:35.240\nAnd if you have any more problems,\nthen just give us a call again.\n\n303\n00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.650\nSo we want to reduce each\nparticular one of those sections.\n\n304\n00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:45.440\nThen, by the next time the incident\nhappens, then we reduce the downtime.\n\n305\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.340\nSo that's what we call the extended or\nexpanded incident life cycle.\n\n306\n00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:56.659\nSo what we've looked at then over this\nparticular section are the techniques that\n\n307\n00:18:56.659 --> 00:19:01.793\navailability management uses to identify\npotential points of failure and to try and\n\n308\n00:19:01.793 --> 00:19:06.782\nminimize either the impact caused by those\npoints of failure or actually to try and\n\n309\n00:19:06.782 --> 00:19:12.090\nremove the failure themselves by adding in\nmaybe resilience and redundancy options.\n\n310\n00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.857\nAnd, of course,\nevery time we do something like that,\n\n311\n00:19:15.857 --> 00:19:20.104\nwe do it because we want to improve\nour service availability and\n\n312\n00:19:20.104 --> 00:19:25.415\nour delivery of that service to our\norganization by delivering value to them.\n\n313\n00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.220\nIn our next section, we're actually going\nto be looking at the interaction of\n\n314\n00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.310\nother processes within\nthe service life cycle and CSI.\n\n315\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.300\nAnd what techniques they\nundertake as part of CSI.\n\n316\n00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.190\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Jo.\n\n317\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.190\nWell, thank you again for introducing us\nto some of those different techniques.\n\n318\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.618\nThat the idea of the incremental changes\nand those small little things that really\n\n319\n00:19:48.618 --> 00:19:52.910\nadd up to shortening things really is\nan improvement that can help us all.\n\n320\n00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.790\nSo this is a great thing for\nus to actually think about and\n\n321\n00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.780\nmake sure you review those concepts,\nas well.\n\n322\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.160\nThis is a great place for\nus also end this episode.\n\n323\n00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.220\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n324\n00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n325\n00:20:04.300 -->

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.650\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.450\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're taking a look at organizing for\n\n8\n00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.160\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n9\n00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.192\nAnd here to help us,\nof course, is gonna be well,\n\n10\n00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:32.390\nour grandmaster of ITIL herself,\nMiss Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.710\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.840\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.740\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.570\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great, Jo.\n\n15\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.030\nAs we start to take a look at this idea,\norganizing for\n\n16\n00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.180\ncontinual service improvement,\nshouldn't just something be native?\n\n17\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.065\nHow much organization do we really\nneed to have to get this rolling?\n\n18\n00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:53.830\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nCSI should be a part of everybody's role.\n\n19\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.490\nAnd everybody has a responsibility for\nidentifying improvement opportunities.\n\n20\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.520\nBut as I mentioned in one\nof our previous sections,\n\n21\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.320\njust because we have a responsibility for\n\n22\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.040\nidentifying improvement opportunities\ndoesn't mean that we do.\n\n23\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.990\nAnd it certainly doesn't mean\nthat we carry that on and\n\n24\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.600\nthat we actually do something with\nthat improvement opportunity.\n\n25\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.890\nSo we need to have somebody that's\ngoing to take ownership for CSI and\n\n26\n00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.640\nwe need to have dedicated roles and\nresponsibilities\n\n27\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.700\nwithin all of our roles but say this is\nwhat we should be doing in terms of CSI.\n\n28\n00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.050\nYou might think it's intuitive and it\nsounds like it's intuitive and it's kinda\n\n29\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.870\nthe thing that you think, well, we always\nwanna be getting better and sure we do.\n\n30\n00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.340\nBut we talked in previous\nsessions about consistency and\n\n31\n00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.220\nwe talked about the need to have\na formal process and a formal method\n\n32\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.410\nbecause that ensures consistency, but\nit also gives us visibility as well.\n\n33\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.000\nWell, if we don't have that and\nwe don't have those defined roles,\n\n34\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.170\nthen CSI tends to get forgotten about and\nit tends to get left.\n\n35\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.480\nBecause we're too busy dealing\nwith the business as usual.\n\n36\n00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.420\nAnd the business is usual with IT,\nwell you know what it's like yourself.\n\n37\n00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.760\nIt's all about running around,\npicking up the pieces,\n\n38\n00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.750\ntrying to react to everything that comes\nfrom the business or comes from elsewhere.\n\n39\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.430\nAnd we don't spend dedicated\ntime trying to improve\n\n40\n00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.030\nunless we actually physically sit down and\nthink about it.\n\n41\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.230\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Jo, in everything that\nwe've been talking about at least at\n\n42\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.200\nthe shows that I've been\ndoing with you on ITIL.\n\n43\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.310\nWe've really talked about ITIL as not\nbeing anything super prescriptive\n\n44\n00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.250\nat what we do.\n\n45\n00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.765\nIt provides a framework,\nbut Jo, organizing for\n\n46\n00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:37.369\nCSI sounds more prescriptive here.\n\n47\n00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.470\nWe're not really getting any\nprescriptive role, are we?\n\n48\n00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.050\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n49\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.080\n&gt;&gt; What we just really telling you is\nsomebody's gonna take ownership of this.\n\n50\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And we've\n\n51\n00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.020\ngot to have defined responsibilities,\nwe're not gonna tell you how to do it.\n\n52\n00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.850\nI mean that's completely up to you,\n\n53\n00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.510\nand it's completely up to every single\norganization because CSI, well,\n\n54\n00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.330\nit's all about being aligned to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n55\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.610\nWell every single organization is\ndifferent, so we can't be prescriptive,\n\n56\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.090\neven if we wanted to, even if we try\nto be prescriptive, we really couldn't.\n\n57\n00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.600\nWhat we've got to do though, is make sure\nthat somebody takes ownership of CSI.\n\n58\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.500\nSo this not necessarily about bringing in\n\n59\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.970\nspecific tasks and giving people\nspecific tasks and specific activities.\n\n60\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.230\nThis is about saying hey somebody's\ngotta take ownership of this.\n\n61\n00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.350\nAnd somebody's gotta do something.\n\n62\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.900\nLet's take a look at this first slide.\n\n63\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.240\nAnd the first thing that I'm going\nto tell you about CSI is as we've\n\n64\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.270\nalready mentioned,\nsomebody's got to take ownership of it.\n\n65\n00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.890\nWe know that we have to have a process\nowner for every single process.\n\n66\n00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.210\nAnd CSI is not a process, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.530\nCSI is a lifecycle phase.\n\n68\n00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.358\nSo what we have,\nwe have the role of a CSI manager and\n\n69\n00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:59.077\nthat CSI manager will actually undertake\nthe generic process owner roles.\n\n70\n00:03:59.077 --> 00:04:00.694\nSo that accountability and\n\n71\n00:04:00.694 --> 00:04:05.685\nalso some of the process manager roles too\nthat responsibility that we outlined when\n\n72\n00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:09.850\nwe went through right to the very\nbeginning of this particular class.\n\n73\n00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.800\nAnd in fact at the beginning\nof every class.\n\n74\n00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.160\nWe went through the generic roles and\nresponsibilities for process owners and\n\n75\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.170\nprocess managers.\n\n76\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.710\nWell CSI as I've said is not a process,\nit's a lifecycle phase.\n\n77\n00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.880\nBut we will have a CSI manager.\n\n78\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.280\nThat's somebody that takes accountability\nfor CSI, because as you've said if\n\n79\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.410\nwe don't have somebody to take ownership,\nCSI tends to fall by the wayside and\n\n80\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.760\npeople don't understand the importance\nof staying aligned to the business.\n\n81\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.830\nAnd as I already mentioned in the previous\nslide if we don't stay aligned\n\n82\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.555\nto the business, if we're just sit in here\nat this level and trying to thread water,\n\n83\n00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:51.980\nthe business is gonna move on and\neventually, we're gonna move back.\n\n84\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.500\nSo what we want to do is make\nsure that as the business moves,\n\n85\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.650\nas the business grows,\nthen we in IT are able to support that.\n\n86\n00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.920\nIn service strategy, we've got these\nhigh level strategies that we look at,\n\n87\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.310\nrun the business, and grow the business\nand transform the business.\n\n88\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.630\nIf the business itself is wanting to grow,\n\n89\n00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.900\nthen we've gotta make sure\nthat we facilitate that.\n\n90\n00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.720\nWe can't be stuck in a run the business\nmode if the business is trying to grow.\n\n91\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.160\nWe've gotta be aligned.\n\n92\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.670\nAnd by the way, I just wanna point\nout did you know that absolutely\n\n93\n00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.209\neverything that we do,\nRonnie is to make an improvement?\n\n94\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.350\nYes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n95\n00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.800\n&gt;&gt; Well, people caught off and\n\n96\n00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.210\nwill say to me, yeah, but sometimes,\nwe strip away functionality.\n\n97\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n98\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.080\n&gt;&gt; But\nthat's still to make an improvement.\n\n99\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.390\nAnd you might look at that with\na negative perspective and\n\n100\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.270\nsay, yeah, but that's not an improvement\nif we're taking away functionality.\n\n101\n00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.460\n&gt;&gt; Unless it's sun-like efficiency, right?\n\n102\n00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.570\nSome of the process that have just kind\nof grown out of what we really needed.\n\n103\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.530\nStrip those away we become\na more efficient organization.\n\n104\n00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n105\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.080\nYep, you've hit the nail\nright on the head there.\n\n106\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.650\nIt is about efficiency.\n\n107\n00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.420\nIt's also about aligning\nourselves to the business and\n\n108\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.830\nimprovement means being\naligned to the business.\n\n109\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.990\nThat's what we want to achieve and if\nthe business don't need anything anymore,\n\n110\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.740\nthen we need to strip that out and we need\nto be more aligned to the business, so\n\n111\n00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.800\nit's still an improvement.\n\n112\n00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.310\nEven stress testing, we undertake stress\ntesting in release and deployment\n\n113\n00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.870\nmanagement and in validation and\ntesting and that is still an improvement.\n\n114\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.530\nBecause what we want to do is we want to\ntest it till breaking point in a test\n\n115\n00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.760\nenvironment in order to ensure that it\ndoesn't break in a live environment.\n\n116\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.460\nSo even though we may seem, on the surface\nsometimes, to be performing something\n\n117\n00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.010\nthat is detrimental to the infrastructure,\nit's not.\n\n118\n00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.757\nIt's all part of improving our\nperformance in the live environment.\n\n119\n00:06:47.757 --> 00:06:50.838\nSo we've got to have somebody\nthat's gonna take ownership\n\n120\n00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:53.710\nof that to make sure\nthat all of that happens.\n\n121\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.740\nAnd that's improvement in processes,\nimprovement in services, improvement\n\n122\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.180\nin our tools, improvement in out people,\nin experiences, in skills, etc.\n\n123\n00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.750\nSo we'll tell you that somebody\nneeds to take ownership of that.\n\n124\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.040\nNow, it depends on the size\nof the organization.\n\n125\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.396\nAnd for those of you that are thinking\nabout going for your CSI exam,\n\n126\n00:07:15.396 --> 00:07:19.906\nI will always tell you that the first\nthing that you've got to look at is\n\n127\n00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:21.987\nthe scale of the organization.\n\n128\n00:07:21.987 --> 00:07:28.232\nBecause If you're a small organization and\nyou've got say 500 people within IT,\n\n129\n00:07:28.232 --> 00:07:33.450\nyou're probably not going to have\na CSI manager and a CSI owner as well.\n\n130\n00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.830\nYou're probably just gonna have one person\nthat's gonna take accountability for CSI.\n\n131\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.293\nBut if you're in an organization\nwhere we've got 10,000 people in IT,\n\n132\n00:07:43.293 --> 00:07:46.401\nthen you're quite probably\ngoing to have a CSI owner,\n\n133\n00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:49.054\nsomebody that takes accountability for\nCSI.\n\n134\n00:07:49.054 --> 00:07:56.371\nBut then you may well have ten,\nmaybe even 20 CSI managers.\n\n135\n00:07:56.371 --> 00:08:00.249\nSo the next couple of slides\nare really just going to expand\n\n136\n00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:03.190\non the role of the CSI manager and\nCSI owner.\n\n137\n00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.120\nAnd we're going to sort of put them\ntogether really within these slides.\n\n138\n00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.810\nAnd just say this is what\nthey should be doing.\n\n139\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.350\nNow whether we've got individual\nmanagers and a separate owner,\n\n140\n00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.190\nor whether we've got just\none person doing all of it.\n\n141\n00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.800\nThis is what they need to be able to do.\n\n142\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.460\nThese are their accountabilities.\n\n143\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.430\nNow remember, there's a difference\nbetween accountable and responsible.\n\n144\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.790\nAccountable, I like to use the word\nensure with the word accountable.\n\n145\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.680\nAccountable means that they\nensure that something gets done.\n\n146\n00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.970\nWhereas responsible means that will they\ntake the responsibility for doing it.\n\n147\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.340\nSo they're accountable for\nall of these, and like I said,\n\n148\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.090\nif you're a large organization and\nyou've got multiple CSI managers,\n\n149\n00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.760\nthen obviously you're going to delegate\nsome of these to your CSI managers.\n\n150\n00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.650\nSo when we talk about ensuring\nthe CSI roles have been filled,\n\n151\n00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.860\nthat's where appropriate.\n\n152\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.940\nBecause again think about\nthe scalability of the organization.\n\n153\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:11.420\nBut the CSI owner role,\nCSI manager role is accountable for CSI.\n\n154\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.690\nSo they're accountable for\ncommunicating what CSI is doing.\n\n155\n00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.370\nThey're accountable for\nensuring that we have a CSI register.\n\n156\n00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.940\nThey work with all of the service owners\nand all of the process managers, and\n\n157\n00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.530\nall of the team leaders,\netc to ensure that CSI is an active part\n\n158\n00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.970\nof those processes and those teams and\nall of those services as well.\n\n159\n00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.324\nAnd of course we know from previous\nsessions the importance of service\n\n160\n00:09:38.324 --> 00:09:42.530\nlevel management in all of our\nother processes and especially CSI,\n\n161\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.462\ncuz service level management\nprovides us with those metrics.\n\n162\n00:09:46.462 --> 00:09:51.209\nSo service level management has to have\na working relationship with the CSI\n\n163\n00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:53.180\nmanager whomever that may be.\n\n164\n00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.730\nThe CSI owner is gonna make sure that\nknowledge management has a relationship\n\n165\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.530\nwith them as well, because of course\nknowledge management takes ownership of\n\n166\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.890\nthe data sources and making sure that\nwe've got those relationships in place.\n\n167\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.610\nSo when it comes to having the right\ntools, then we're going to be working with\n\n168\n00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.700\nknowledge management to not only ensure\nthe relationships are in place but\n\n169\n00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.060\nto capture things like it says there,\nbaseline data, etc.\n\n170\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.950\nSo the CSI manager also looks at\nmaybe other frameworks as well.\n\n171\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.670\nI expect them to have a very good\nworking knowledge of say CMMI.\n\n172\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:35.950\nNow, we looked at that in a previous\nsession where we will assess a process for\n\n173\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.870\nmaturity based on a scale of zero to five,\n\n174\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:45.280\nzero being completely ad\nhoc,almost non existant whereas\n\n175\n00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.909\nfive being a fully mature\nprocess with CSI incorporated.\n\n176\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.060\nSo the CSI manager has knowledge\nof all the frameworks, etc.\n\n177\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:00.324\nI expect, now it really depends\non scale of the organization, but\n\n178\n00:11:00.324 --> 00:11:06.817\nit's going to be somebody in CSI who has\nvery well developed skills in analytics.\n\n179\n00:11:06.817 --> 00:11:10.655\nSomebody who is able to\nlook at report data and\n\n180\n00:11:10.655 --> 00:11:16.614\nis able to analyze report data as well,\nso is able to identify trends,\n\n181\n00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:23.084\nis able to look for maybe the causes\nof trends, identify peaks and troughs.\n\n182\n00:11:23.084 --> 00:11:26.704\nNow, we've got other processes\nthat do that too, so\n\n183\n00:11:26.704 --> 00:11:31.854\nwe've got let's think about demand\nmanagement in service strategy also,\n\n184\n00:11:31.854 --> 00:11:36.522\nbusiness relationship management\nare gonna help with that as well,\n\n185\n00:11:36.522 --> 00:11:39.680\nbut we need somebody who\ncan analyze the data.\n\n186\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.620\nUltimately we need somebody within CSI\nto take accountability for everything.\n\n187\n00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.190\nSomebody who is senior enough\nto be able to make decisions\n\n188\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.940\nto be able to prioritize\nimprovement opportunities and\n\n189\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.080\nsay okay this improvement\nopportunity against service\n\n190\n00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.160\nX is actually more important than the\nimprovement opportunity against service Y.\n\n191\n00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.360\nNow, we need BRN to help us with that.\n\n192\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.730\nWe need availability management to help us\nwith that because they will identify those\n\n193\n00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.590\nVBX, those vital business functions.\n\n194\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.440\nAnd if you want to know more about VBX,\n\n195\n00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.719\nthen take a look at\nthe service design class.\n\n196\n00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.900\nSo, we gonna be working with all of\nthose other processes to help us, okay?\n\n197\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.360\nWe gonna be working with the business\nto help us prioritize as well.\n\n198\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.785\nAnd obviously with our CIO ect,\ntoo, because I'd expect our IT\n\n199\n00:12:27.785 --> 00:12:31.410\nsteering group to have something\ninfluence over prioritization.\n\n200\n00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.016\nWe are also going to be in CSI,\ncoaching others,\n\n201\n00:12:37.016 --> 00:12:41.840\nto help them,\nto facilitate CSI activities.\n\n202\n00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.650\nWe're going to be ensuring that everybody\nis fully aware of what CSI is trying\n\n203\n00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.200\nto achieve.\n\n204\n00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.270\nSo that's the CSI Owner.\n\n205\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.673\nYou may also have a seven step\nimprovement process owner and\n\n206\n00:12:56.673 --> 00:13:00.358\nagain, may, no matter process owner.\n\n207\n00:13:00.358 --> 00:13:03.740\nSo again,\nthey ensure that the process happens.\n\n208\n00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.800\nNow, it really depends on\nthe scale of the organization.\n\n209\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.250\nAnd I can't emphasize that enough.\n\n210\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.700\nYou do not need to have 250 roles in CSI\n\n211\n00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.800\nif you've only got 500 people within\nyour IT service provider organization.\n\n212\n00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:27.070\nYou may have a process manager for\nthe seven step improvement process.\n\n213\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.920\nAnd that process manager is somebody\n\n214\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.610\nwho manages that process\non a day-to-day basis.\n\n215\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.410\nAnd it says here, working with other\nmanagers including the CSI manager and\n\n216\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.700\nother process owners, etc.\n\n217\n00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.330\nOne thing that I want to say\nabout this process manager for\n\n218\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.840\nthe seven step improvement process\nis that they are responsible for\n\n219\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.180\nensuring that people that are undertaking\nor using the seven step improvement\n\n220\n00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:58.130\nprocess are skilled and trained and\nare able to use this process.\n\n221\n00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:01.540\nI've mentioned about analytical skills and\n\n222\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.840\nwe need to have someone\nwith analytical skills.\n\n223\n00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.660\nWell certainly when we we're undertaking\nthe seven step improvement process,\n\n224\n00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.850\nif you go back to some of our\nprevious sessions on this process,\n\n225\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.880\nyou'll understand that we're\nanalyzing data a lot and\n\n226\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.230\nwe are formatting the data and\nwe're drawing conclusions from that data.\n\n227\n00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.950\nSo we need to have somebody\nwith the right level of skills.\n\n228\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:29.970\nNow you may employ a separate reported\nanalyst who's going to do that for you.\n\n229\n00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.230\nBut again it depends on the scale.\n\n230\n00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.090\nBecause you may not even have somebody\n\n231\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.270\nat all working within the seven\nstep improvement process.\n\n232\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:44.460\nIt may just come under the CSI manager or\nowner and individual process owners.\n\n233\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.120\nI'm not gonna tell you how to organize and\ngoing back to what Ronnie said\n\n234\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.270\nabout being prescriptive,\nwe're not gonna tell you how to organize.\n\n235\n00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:56.280\nWe'll tell you that you need to have\ncertain skills in order to be able to do\n\n236\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.120\nthis, but\nwe're not gonna tell you organize.\n\n237\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.580\nI mean look at the role of\nthe reporting analyst here.\n\n238\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.390\nIt talks about having responsibility for\nconsolidating data and\n\n239\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:12.180\nproducing trends and producing reports and\nanalyzing the data, so\n\n240\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.860\nthey need statistical and\nanalytical skills.\n\n241\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.450\nThey need good communication skills\nbecause of course their feedback,\n\n242\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.840\nthey're going to have to feed that back\ninto the language of the audience.\n\n243\n00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.180\nNow, this is something that we gotta be\nreally careful about because of course\n\n244\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.800\ntechnical people, we like to communicate\nin technical languages, right?\n\n245\n00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.340\nAnd so\nsometimes communicating with our business\n\n246\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.730\nis not something that we\nfind particularly easy.\n\n247\n00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.330\nSo we've gotta be really careful\nwhen we select somebody for\n\n248\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.890\nthis particular role, cuz they have\nto have that communication skill.\n\n249\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.564\nThey have to be able to communicate.\n\n250\n00:15:46.564 --> 00:15:48.972\nYeah with the technical people,\n\n251\n00:15:48.972 --> 00:15:52.928\nbut also with others within\nthe organization as well.\n\n252\n00:15:52.928 --> 00:15:58.902\nSo how do we then How do we allocate\nroles and responsibilities?\n\n253\n00:15:58.902 --> 00:16:02.540\nWell, we use something\ncalled a RACI matrix.\n\n254\n00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:07.340\nNow I know you've come across\na RACI matrix before because you\n\n255\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.070\nhave completed the foundation class.\n\n256\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.415\nThe Eye to your Foundation class.\n\n257\n00:16:10.415 --> 00:16:12.807\nSo this would have been\ncovered in your class.\n\n258\n00:16:12.807 --> 00:16:18.515\nBut nevertheless we're just going to\nbriefly go over the RACI matrix okay.\n\n259\n00:16:18.515 --> 00:16:19.215\nNow this is very,\n\n260\n00:16:19.215 --> 00:16:23.705\nvery generic looking RACI matrix\nthat's at the bottom of this screen.\n\n261\n00:16:23.705 --> 00:16:28.305\nOkay but what I'm going to tell you is the\nfirst thing that we're going to do when we\n\n262\n00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:34.330\ndefine a RACI matrix is on the left\nhand side we're going to list down\n\n263\n00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:39.960\non that particular column all of\nthe activities within any process.\n\n264\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.610\nSo we could, for instance,\n\n265\n00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:45.540\nlist all of the activities within\nthe seven step improvement process.\n\n266\n00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:50.820\nOkay such as come up with our vision\nthat would be activity number one and\n\n267\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:56.280\nthen define what data we're going\nto take that's activity number two,\n\n268\n00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.890\nand then gather the data that's\nactivity number three etc etc.\n\n269\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.970\nAnd we could go down, and\nwe could list those activities.\n\n270\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.260\nWe do this for every single process.\n\n271\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.140\nEvery single process.\n\n272\n00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.070\nAnd then along the top,\nwe list our stakeholders.\n\n273\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.970\nAnd our stakeholders are interested\nparties, this is not\n\n274\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:24.390\nanybody that has a financial interest and\nI wanna make that very clear,\n\n275\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:29.270\nbecause sometimes the use of the word\nstakeholder can mean different things in\n\n276\n00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.570\ndifferent countries, and different\npeople use in the language differently.\n\n277\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:38.320\nA stakeholder is just someone\nwho has a vested interest.\n\n278\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.880\nThat's all a stakeholder is.\n\n279\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.150\nSo along the top of this then\nwe list our stakeholders.\n\n280\n00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.600\nAnd then,\nif we take a look at activity number one,\n\n281\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.400\nwhich is outlining the vision, if we've\ngot our stakeholders across the top and\n\n282\n00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.760\nour stakeholders may be our\nbusiness relationship manager, or\n\n283\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.080\nour CSI manager or owner,\nmaybe our process analyst, for instance,\n\n284\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.300\nour seven step improvement analyst,\nour CIO they maybe our stakeholders, and\n\n285\n00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:12.870\nthen we will assign either accountable or\nresponsible, well consulted or informed.\n\n286\n00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.960\nThat is a level of responsibility and\nwe will assign\n\n287\n00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.980\na level of responsiblity to\neach individual stakeholder.\n\n288\n00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.819\nA couple of rules.\n\n289\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.810\nOkay, only one person can be\naccountable for something.\n\n290\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.240\nSo you'll notice that in activity one\nthe director service management is\n\n291\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.035\naccountable for activity one.\n\n292\n00:18:34.035 --> 00:18:36.650\nThey're also accountable for activity two.\n\n293\n00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.450\nOnly one person can be accountable for\nany activity.\n\n294\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.030\nAny number of people can be responsible.\n\n295\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.520\nSo we could in activity\none then we could have\n\n296\n00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.789\nan R right the way across the board\nwith all of those stake holders.\n\n297\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.640\nConsulted means that you ask an opinion.\n\n298\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.210\nYou're consulting somebody for their\nopinion, for their advice and guidance.\n\n299\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.090\nRemember, the more opinions you ask for,\n\n300\n00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.640\nthe more opinions you're\ngoing to get back.\n\n301\n00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.180\nSo, I'm not saying that you\nshouldn't consult everybody.\n\n302\n00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.440\nBut of course if you consult everybody,\nand you get all of these opinions back,\n\n303\n00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.640\nyou have to find a way of incorporating\nand addressing all of their concerns.\n\n304\n00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.820\nInformed means those people that\nyou just want to keep up to date\n\n305\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.990\nabout whatever that activity is.\n\n306\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.790\nAnd some people you'll\nnotice in activity four\n\n307\n00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:29.270\nthe problem manager there in activity\nfour has no responsibility whatsoever.\n\n308\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:34.980\nSo it's okay to have a blank space,\nthat's not a problem at all and\n\n309\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.470\nthe next slide simply just tells us,\nas I've already said,\n\n310\n00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:43.550\nhow to go about completing\nthat RACI matrix, okay?\n\n311\n00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:48.630\nJust remember, okay,\nyou may have to identify any gaps.\n\n312\n00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.280\nLet's go back and\nlook at that slide again.\n\n313\n00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.670\nThere's a gap there where the problem\nmanager and activity four are combined.\n\n314\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:02.630\nNow should that be a gap or\nshould that be a role that's filled?\n\n315\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.200\nMaybe we might need to\nconsult the problem manager.\n\n316\n00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.110\nAnd also when we're thinking\nabout identifying gaps,\n\n317\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.120\nlook at every single activity.\n\n318\n00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.210\nSomebody has to be accountable for\nevery activity.\n\n319\n00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.420\nAnd someone has to be responsible for\nevery activity too.\n\n320\n00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.830\nNow in activity number one, you've got\nthe same person who's accountable and\n\n321\n00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:23.950\nresponsible and that's okay.\n\n322\n00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.820\nYou could even have the same person\nwho's responsible and who's consulted,\n\n323\n00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.440\ndepending on the type of improvement\nthat you're making for instance.\n\n324\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.400\nSo in one type of improvement,\nthey'll be responsible.\n\n325\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.610\nIn another type, they'll be consulted.\n\n326\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:45.190\nIf you do that, there has to be a key that\noutlines the difference between them.\n\n327\n00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.970\nCuz obviously you can give\nsomebody something to do and\n\n328\n00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.410\nask their opinion as well because\nthat's kinda contradictory.\n\n329\n00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.150\nSo think common sense.\n\n330\n00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.050\nAbove everything else, think common sense.\n\n331\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.610\nAnd just remember the problems\nthat are listed here,\n\n332\n00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.040\nonly one person can be accountable for\neach task.\n\n333\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.750\nOkay.\n\n334\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.736\nIf you're going to make somebody\nresponsible, then please tell them.\n\n335\n00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:14.050\n[LAUGH] Okay, they're not going to\nlook at this RACI matrix unless\n\n336\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:19.040\nyou actually present it to them and say to\nthem, hey, look this is what we've done.\n\n337\n00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.350\nOkay, I'm gonna ask you to\nbe responsible for this.\n\n338\n00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.940\nAnd just remember that unless you've\ngot people on board with CSI and\n\n339\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:32.550\nunless they're involved in this, then\nthere could be conflicting requirements or\n\n340\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.480\nconflicting goals as we've\ngot written up there.\n\n341\n00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.060\nWhat we don't want is\nto be in a situation,\n\n342\n00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.550\nbecause then that's not an improvement,\nwhere we've got people fighting over\n\n343\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.630\na particular person because we\nwant him to do one thing and\n\n344\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.300\nthen another process will need\nhim to do something else.\n\n345\n00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.420\nOkay, make sure the people are available.\n\n346\n00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.748\nI know that this is just common sense,\nbut you'd be surprised how many RACI\n\n347\n00:21:57.748 --> 00:22:02.630\nmatrices that I see and I said okay,\nand so the involvement.\n\n348\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.010\nLet's go back here a minute.\n\n349\n00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.630\nAnd the involvement of the service\nlevel manager in activity two,\n\n350\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.420\nthey've been really involved, have they?\n\n351\n00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.080\nAnd they say, well no,\nbecause he didn't agree to it.\n\n352\n00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.460\nSo actually he hasn't done anything.\n\n353\n00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.990\nWell then you need to go back and rethink\nyour RACI matrix if that is the case.\n\n354\n00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:24.130\nSo when we look at organization for\nCSI, it actually,\n\n355\n00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.650\nI'm hoping Ronnie that it wasn't quite as\nprescriptive as you thought it might be,\n\n356\n00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.970\nit really is high level.\n\n357\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.040\nWhat we're just basically saying\nis somebody has gotta do it, and\n\n358\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.710\nsomebody is gotta take ownership and\nwe've all gotta know where we stand.\n\n359\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.880\nSo you do have an exercise\nwithin your materials now that\n\n360\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.670\nis going to take you around about\n30 minutes to an hour to do.\n\n361\n00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:52.060\nAnd that includes an exercise where\nyou look at the case study and you\n\n362\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.240\nallocated the role of the CSI manager and\nyou're gonna define a RACI matrix okay?\n\n363\n00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.860\nNow I want you to take\na look through that.\n\n364\n00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.040\nLet's just say it's gonna take\nabout 30 minutes to an hour, so\n\n365\n00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.210\nthink about it okay?\n\n366\n00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.640\nIf it takes you any less than 30 minutes\nto an hour, then I would say that\n\n367\n00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.590\nI'm gonna start questioning\nthe results that you've got, okay?\n\n368\n00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:11.960\nSo really do think about it.\n\n369\n00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.070\nIt's designed to make you think.\n\n370\n00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.050\nIf you have any questions,\nthen we have the forum.\n\n371\n00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.240\nWe have the chat available.\n\n372\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.240\nSo please come back to us and\n\n373\n00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.570\nI'll be happy to answer any\nquestions that you might have.\n\n374\n00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, Joe, well,\nthank you again for\n\n375\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:30.150\nhelping us understand a little bit more\nabout this idea of organizing for CSI.\n\n376\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.540\nRemember taking the ideas here,\nresponsiblity and accountability,\n\n377\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.310\nare key in this idea of, of course,\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n378\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.540\nAnd that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode, then.\n\n379\n00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.310\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n380\n00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.390\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n381\n00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:50.880\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the ITIL

Jo lets us know that a single tool may be the way to go but we may find out the cost may outweigh the technology we already have.  She tells us the key is to ensure that those technologies should be inter-related to provide what the user needs.  The technologies to help with CSI should help us to identify, track and validate the improvements we need to make, the progress of the improvement and the result of that improvement.",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:07.392\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.392 --> 00:00:08.343\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:12.231\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:14.883\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.883 --> 00:00:18.458\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n8\n00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:22.709\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ngonna be taking a look at technology\n\n9\n00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:25.597\nconsiderations for\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n10\n00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:30.768\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be our\nITIL red baron herself, Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:32.592\nJo welcome back to the studios.\n\n12\n00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:34.244\n&gt;&gt; Okay thank you Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:37.077\nYou make me more confused\nevery session [LAUGH].\n\n14\n00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:38.206\n&gt;&gt; It is a famous song.\n\n15\n00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:39.526\nIt's Snoopy and the Red Baron.\n\n16\n00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:40.609\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n17\n00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.110\n&gt;&gt; Understand it there you go.\n\n18\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.752\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n19\n00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:46.387\n&gt;&gt; All right so Jo when we start to take\na look the great thing is we're talking\n\n20\n00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:48.453\nabout technology considerations here.\n\n21\n00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:49.719\nSo we're not going backward in time.\n\n22\n00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.579\nWe're not worried about the biplanes, and\nduring the days of the Red Baron any more.\n\n23\n00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.398\nBut overall though,\nwe want to talk about some of these\n\n24\n00:00:56.398 --> 00:00:58.986\nconsiderations that we\nwant to understand here.\n\n25\n00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:02.758\nSo Jo, are we just talking\nabout getting the newest and\n\n26\n00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:06.617\nlatest stuff that we need\nbecause I think it's pretty.\n\n27\n00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:11.464\n&gt;&gt; Well that would always be\nthat's my preferred option.\n\n28\n00:01:11.464 --> 00:01:13.086\nI need the latest toy.\n\n29\n00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:14.690\nI have to have the latest toy.\n\n30\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.446\nBut no we're not talking\nabout that at all.\n\n31\n00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:22.672\nWhat we're talking about is you know the\nword consideration is really the important\n\n32\n00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:23.219\none here.\n\n33\n00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.190\nWhat kind of technology\ndo we need within CSI.\n\n34\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.051\nDo we need to have the latest toys?\n\n35\n00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:31.430\nAnd no,\nwe don't need to have the latest toy.\n\n36\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.500\nWe need to have whatever is\nappropriate for the organization.\n\n37\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.703\nNow, I've mentioned in\na few episodes that we've\n\n38\n00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:42.323\ncovered in CSI about the need to\nunderstand the organization strategy and\n\n39\n00:01:42.323 --> 00:01:45.750\nis the organization looking\nto just run the business or\n\n40\n00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.465\nis it looking to grow the business or\nis it looking to transform the business.\n\n41\n00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:56.217\nAnd that's really important to us in CSI\nbecause we have to be aligned the needs\n\n42\n00:01:56.217 --> 00:01:57.445\nthe organization.\n\n43\n00:01:57.445 --> 00:01:59.715\nLet's think about technology for a moment.\n\n44\n00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:03.008\nSo an organization that's just\nlooking to run the business,\n\n45\n00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:06.869\nin terms of technology Ronnie,\nif an organization is just looking to run\n\n46\n00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.889\nthe business then that means they're\njust interested in treading water.\n\n47\n00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:11.494\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n48\n00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:14.120\n&gt;&gt; So that means that they don't want\nto change anything, is that right?\n\n49\n00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.415\n&gt;&gt; Normally yes, they're treading their\nstatus quo, they're just looking for\n\n50\n00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:19.257\nmaintenance.\n\n51\n00:02:19.257 --> 00:02:21.792\n&gt;&gt; Right, but that's not true.\n\n52\n00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:26.065\nAnd that's the challenge that we have is\nthat this is the feeling that everybody\n\n53\n00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.151\nhas, and this is the misconception\nthat everybody has.\n\n54\n00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:32.120\nThat an organization is just\nlooking to run the business.\n\n55\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.626\nJust simply wants to\nmaintain the status quo.\n\n56\n00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:36.684\nAnd it's just about\npreventative maintenance.\n\n57\n00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:40.237\nAnd it's just about keeping\neverything on an even keel.\n\n58\n00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:42.736\nBut that's not necessarily the case.\n\n59\n00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:46.395\nLet's face it, Windows 95 is\nnot going to be supported and\n\n60\n00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:49.080\nit's not going to be around forever.\n\n61\n00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.173\nSo we still have to change.\n\n62\n00:02:51.173 --> 00:02:55.229\nNow an organization that's\nlooking to grow well here in IT\n\n63\n00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.310\nwe've got to be innovators.\n\n64\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.062\nBut in an organization that's\njust looking to run and\n\n65\n00:03:03.062 --> 00:03:07.870\njust looking to tread water and\njust stay exactly where we are we\n\n66\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.242\nhave still got to be updated\nwith the latest technology.\n\n67\n00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:15.503\nIt's just that we're\nnot driving innovation.\n\n68\n00:03:15.503 --> 00:03:18.455\nWe are not driving growth.\n\n69\n00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:20.130\nSo we still have to change.\n\n70\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.302\nAnd this is the common misconception is\nthat an organization that just wants to\n\n71\n00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:28.280\nrun just wants to leave\neverything as it is.\n\n72\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.404\nBut of course it doesn't.\n\n73\n00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:33.667\nLet's think about our tools\nthat we use within IT itself.\n\n74\n00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:36.540\nSo our cool login system for instance.\n\n75\n00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.190\nIf we kept the same cool login system for\nten years, well,\n\n76\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.450\nour users out there haven't kept\nthe same cellphone for ten years.\n\n77\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.820\nThey haven't kept the same piece safe for\nten years.\n\n78\n00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.980\nSo if we keep the same\ncore logging system for\n\n79\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.910\nten years, it's going to feel very\noutdated, probably very quickly as well.\n\n80\n00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.580\nAnd now they want to be able to\nlog any incident with an app or\n\n81\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.870\nusing their cell phone or\nmaybe using an Email.\n\n82\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.050\nWell, if we don't have\nthe technology to do that,\n\n83\n00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.520\nthen we're not aligned to\nthe needs of the business.\n\n84\n00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.900\nSo it's not enough for\nus just to not change.\n\n85\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.470\nWe've gotta change,\nwe've still got to keep up to date.\n\n86\n00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.330\nSo we have to try and get our heads\naround that misconception of,\n\n87\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.450\nif we're just running the business,\nwe're not going to change.\n\n88\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.940\nOrganizations don't like to invest\nin new technology unless they see\n\n89\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.630\na benefit to new technology.\n\n90\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.590\nAnd so here in CSI, we've got to identify\nall of the benefits to new technology,\n\n91\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.000\nunderstanding that we need it.\n\n92\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.870\nAnd this is not something that\nwe can afford to not invest in.\n\n93\n00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.680\nWe have to invest in new technology\nIt's fairly recently I went to internal\n\n94\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.410\norganization where they haven't\nchanged their call logging system for\n\n95\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.820\na number of years.\n\n96\n00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.930\nAnd what happened was\nthe organization itself,\n\n97\n00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.700\neven though the business was still\nwanting just to maintain the status quo.\n\n98\n00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.030\nBut they found that they couldn't do that\nanymore because IT was holding them back,\n\n99\n00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.700\nbecause it took a lot longer\nto resolve an incident,\n\n100\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.478\nbecause, of course, things start to fail.\n\n101\n00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:19.080\nAnd that co-login system was no\nlonger supported by the supplier.\n\n102\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.710\nThey didn't have a contract for\nthat call login system and so\n\n103\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.470\nevery time somebody reported an incident,\nwhen the call login system failed,\n\n104\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.810\nthey were left with pieces of\npaper to write everything down.\n\n105\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.850\nAnd this is the situation that we\ncan sometimes find ourselves in,\n\n106\n00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.520\nif we don't change.\n\n107\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.140\nSo this is not about having\nthe latest shiny toy.\n\n108\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.670\nAnd as much as I'd like to have the latest\nshiny toy this is not about having that.\n\n109\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.280\nThis is about ensuring that\nwe're aligned to the business.\n\n110\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.900\nThat we're continually\naligned to the business.\n\n111\n00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.260\nSo the tools that we use here within\nIT are generally we consider them\n\n112\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.750\nto be based around the core login system,\nto be based around incident management,\n\n113\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.760\nand request fulfillment, and change\nmanagement, and problem management, etc.\n\n114\n00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.560\nBut then think back to service transition,\nand think back to knowledge management,\n\n115\n00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.520\nand about having all of\nthese data sources, and\n\n116\n00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.350\nhaving all of these services and\nall of these tools.\n\n117\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.580\nNow with every single process,\n\n118\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.780\nwe're going to have some form of\ntool to facilitate that process.\n\n119\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.620\nSo we have the availability management\ninformation system, the capacity\n\n120\n00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.290\nmanagement information system, the IT\nservice continuity management information\n\n121\n00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.970\nsystem, the supplier and\ncontract management information system.\n\n122\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.060\nWe have our service level\nmanagement database,\n\n123\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.730\nwe have a tool for absolutely everything.\n\n124\n00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.500\nNow if we take a look at\nthis first slide here, right\n\n125\n00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.720\nat the very bottom it says that we could\nreally, really do with a single tool.\n\n126\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.880\nThat would be a huge benefit.\n\n127\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.690\nThat's not strictly true.\n\n128\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.120\nWithin CSI we could do with a tool\nthat is going to help us track\n\n129\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.740\nall of our improvement but\nthis is not going to be dependent\n\n130\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.600\non a single tool within IT itself.\n\n131\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.620\nNow I know that there are some suppliers\nout there that will sell you an entire\n\n132\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.940\nwhat they call a service management suite.\n\n133\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:23.100\nBut their entire service management suite\nwill actually perform the releases for\n\n134\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.190\nyou and it'll log incidents and\nchanges and problems and requests, etc.\n\n135\n00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.240\nIt will have a built-in\nconfiguration management system.\n\n136\n00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.160\nIt will have databases for availability\nand capacity and security, etc.\n\n137\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.860\nAnd yes there are supplies out\nthere that will sell you that tool.\n\n138\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.900\nBut knowledge management is not\nabout having one single tool.\n\n139\n00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.285\nKnowledge management is about having\nrelationships between the tools.\n\n140\n00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:53.920\nAnd so if we have the right tool\nset within CSI that actually\n\n141\n00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.253\ntaps into these relationships,\nwe don't need to have one tool.\n\n142\n00:08:00.253 --> 00:08:04.031\nYou don't have to go out and\nspend millions of pounds or\n\n143\n00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:07.580\nmillions of dollars on\na tool that you don't need.\n\n144\n00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:14.220\nAnd again, when we look in other sessions\nthat we've recorded to do with CSI,\n\n145\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.815\nI mention scalability the organization,\nif we've got 500 people in IT,\n\n146\n00:08:18.815 --> 00:08:22.970\nthen you don't need to go\ninto a huge major supplier.\n\n147\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:28.080\nAnd spend millions of dollars or\npounds on a tool that,\n\n148\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.830\nsimply, you're gonna have\na couple of licenses for.\n\n149\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.610\nSo think about the relationships\nbetween the tools.\n\n150\n00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:42.430\nCSI has an accountability to improve\neverything, and that includes the tools.\n\n151\n00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.216\nAnd that includes the relationships\nbetween the tools that we use.\n\n152\n00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:50.016\nSo whatever tools we have,\nwe need to have relationships in place.\n\n153\n00:08:50.016 --> 00:08:53.637\nWe need to have a relationship\nbetween them so\n\n154\n00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:57.080\nthat we can improve on that relationship.\n\n155\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.040\nLet's just think about a scenario for\na moment.\n\n156\n00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.770\nSo you call the service desk and the first\nthing that the service desk analyst will\n\n157\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.720\ndo, is they will ask for your user ID,\nand you give them your user ID.\n\n158\n00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.960\nAnd they'll type it into the call\nlogging system and it will suddenly,\n\n159\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.630\nas soon they put your user ID in there,\nit will populate all of the information\n\n160\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.590\nin here about who you are,\nwhat team you work for, what PC you have.\n\n161\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.010\nWhere you sit, where your telephone\nnumber is, your contact data.\n\n162\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.730\nWhere do you think gets\nthat information from?\n\n163\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.510\n&gt;&gt; It gets it from well,\nit could get it from multiple systems,\n\n164\n00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.010\nis what it could do.\n\n165\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it does.\n\n166\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.250\nSo, again, we have to have\nthese relationships in place.\n\n167\n00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.070\nAnd some of the information we can\nget from access management databases,\n\n168\n00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.410\nthings like Microsoft Active Directory,\n\n169\n00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.290\nwill give us information about what\nyou're supposed to have access to.\n\n170\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.240\nOur configuration management system\nwill give us information about\n\n171\n00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.770\nwhat hardware you have,\nwhat software you have,\n\n172\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:10.240\nwhere abouts you sit, what portion\nof the network that you're on, etc.\n\n173\n00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.210\nBut, then, it also brings in\nservice level targets as well.\n\n174\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.133\nWhich are to do with\nthe services you have and\n\n175\n00:10:17.133 --> 00:10:21.636\nexactly what business unit you sit in and\nwhat targets apply to you.\n\n176\n00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:26.692\nSo, immediately, within five seconds\nof you giving that service desk\n\n177\n00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:31.428\nanalyst your user ID,\nthey have accessed three different tools.\n\n178\n00:10:31.428 --> 00:10:35.765\nWell, they've actually accessed four, cuz\nthey've typed your user ID into one and\n\n179\n00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:40.170\nthen they've accessed another three,\nand that's within a couple of seconds.\n\n180\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:45.170\nAnd that's before they've done any initial\ninvestigation on whatever the issue is\n\n181\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.902\nthat you're having.\n\n182\n00:10:45.902 --> 00:10:51.240\nAnd so, when they are then doing\nan investigation on the issue that\n\n183\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.510\nyou're having, they'll be doing something\nlike maybe using network management tools,\n\n184\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.350\nor remote desktop tools, etc.\n\n185\n00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.460\nSo they will be using all of\nthese other tools as well.\n\n186\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.400\nWe've got automated incident and\nproblem resolution.\n\n187\n00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.280\nWe could be using some of those tools.\n\n188\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.180\nSo, they will be using other tools just\nsimply to help you resolve your incident.\n\n189\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.251\nAnd that's before we've looked\nat all the background and\n\n190\n00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:20.673\nall the proactive work we do in IT.\n\n191\n00:11:20.673 --> 00:11:25.587\nAnd that's before we've actually linked\nthe incident to a problem because we want\n\n192\n00:11:25.587 --> 00:11:27.510\nto identify the root cause.\n\n193\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.957\nAnd maybe we've linked it to a change\nbecause that root cause needs fixing and,\n\n194\n00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:33.381\ntherefore, we need to change\nthe environment as well.\n\n195\n00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:36.984\nIf those relationships don't work,\n\n196\n00:11:36.984 --> 00:11:42.620\njust think how inefficient\nincident management would be.\n\n197\n00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.450\nIf I had to find out all of that\ninformation from you directly\n\n198\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:53.100\non the phone, if I had to ask you\nwhere you were, I had to ask you\n\n199\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.830\nwhat PC you were using, I had to ask you\nwhat portion of the network you were on.\n\n200\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.550\nI had to ask you what team you worked for,\n\n201\n00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.808\nif I had to find that out every single\ntime you called the service desk,\n\n202\n00:12:03.808 --> 00:12:05.589\nyou, too, would get fed up\nwith calling the service desk.\n\n203\n00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.780\nAll right, so, this is why we have\nto work on those relationships.\n\n204\n00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.010\nAnd, yes, knowledge management is\ngoing to help, but here in CSI,\n\n205\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.850\nwe have that accountability to\nbe aligned to Ronnie's needs.\n\n206\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.120\nI have to be aligned to\nwhat Ronnie requires.\n\n207\n00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.869\nAnd, therefore,\nI have to know what he requires.\n\n208\n00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.300\nAnd what he doesn't require is\nan inefficient process, and\n\n209\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.860\nthat would be an inefficient\nincident management process,\n\n210\n00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.320\nif I had to ask him to repeat\neverything every time he called us.\n\n211\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.140\nSo, CSI really takes accountability for\n\n212\n00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.620\nthe relationships between all of our\ntools, but please don't go out and\n\n213\n00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.250\nthink that you have to go and buy a tool\nIn order to support service management,\n\n214\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.170\nthat is going to do absolutely\neverything for you, because you don't.\n\n215\n00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.100\nWhat we need to do is ensure that\nthe relationships are in place.\n\n216\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.941\nAnd that's the relationships between\ntools like our network management and\n\n217\n00:13:02.941 --> 00:13:04.546\nour system management, here.\n\n218\n00:13:04.546 --> 00:13:10.136\nOur event management tools that will\ndo the automated monitoring of events,\n\n219\n00:13:10.136 --> 00:13:14.874\nthings that happen and\nthen we'll decide what to do about those.\n\n220\n00:13:14.874 --> 00:13:16.829\nSo backup started.\n\n221\n00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.477\nHey, that's great we'll leave it.\n\n222\n00:13:18.477 --> 00:13:21.790\nBut when a backup failed,\nwe're going to alert somebody.\n\n223\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.100\nAny automated tools to do with resolution,\nfor instance.\n\n224\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.490\nAnd what about performance\nmanagement tools?\n\n225\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.180\nAnd look at the links there that\nwe have in performance management,\n\n226\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.880\nbecause, of course,\n\n227\n00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.670\navailability management, well, they're\nidentifying potential points of failure.\n\n228\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:41.340\nAnd so, we need to be able to identify\nthose, and then add in mitigation,\n\n229\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.149\nor redundancy, or\nresilience against those failures.\n\n230\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.840\nWe're also going to be\nperforming trend analysis.\n\n231\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.910\nSo these performance tools will help\nwith those service design processes,\n\n232\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:57.850\nbut also help with testing as well,\nwhen we're testing any new services.\n\n233\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.840\nAnalysis tools, well that's something\nwe use with CSI, of course,\n\n234\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.000\nbecause we want to analyze our data and\nlook for areas to improve.\n\n235\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.960\nBut every single process has got\na responsibility for improvement so,\n\n236\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.851\ntherefore, everybody uses analysis\ntools in some way shape or form.\n\n237\n00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:20.940\nAnd then, let's not forget project and\nportfolio management.\n\n238\n00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.135\nWell of course we've got\nour service portfolio.\n\n239\n00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:29.465\nAnd our service portfolio, well, that's\nwhere, in our pipeline, we have our list\n\n240\n00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:35.097\nof ideas, our ideas for our new\nservices that support decision making.\n\n241\n00:14:35.097 --> 00:14:37.797\nOkay, whether we're going to\nhave that new service or not.\n\n242\n00:14:37.797 --> 00:14:43.077\nWell, once that business case has been\napproved and we have decided that,\n\n243\n00:14:43.077 --> 00:14:47.730\nthat service is going to go ahead,\nthat's when we start a project.\n\n244\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:52.280\nNow, if there is not a link\nbetween our service portfolio and\n\n245\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.300\nour project management database, then\nwe're gonna recreate everything again.\n\n246\n00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:02.250\nSo all of that information that we had\nin the pipeline, all of the information,\n\n247\n00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:07.520\nincluding all the information that we\nused to populate the business case, etc.\n\n248\n00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.980\nWhat we're going to lose all of that and\nwe're going to recreate it and\n\n249\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.230\nput it into a project\nmanagement database again?\n\n250\n00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.050\nOf course not.\n\n251\n00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.920\nWe need to have the relationships\nin place so that we can just simply\n\n252\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.270\npick up the project from where it\nwas left off in the business case.\n\n253\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.080\nIts been signed, okay.\n\n254\n00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.670\nSo now it becomes part of the catalogue\nand that catalogue is going to be linked\n\n255\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:36.070\nto the project database, so that we can\nfollow that service through its life.\n\n256\n00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.670\nIt doesn't make sense, it's certainly\nnot inefficient if we don't do that.\n\n257\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.130\nAnd then, of course,\nwe've got our financial management tools.\n\n258\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.350\nAnd our financial management\nis split into three.\n\n259\n00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.930\nIt's split into A, B,\nC, as we call it, but\n\n260\n00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.940\nnow I'm gonna make it backwards and\nput B first.\n\n261\n00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.270\nThe B is for budgeting.\n\n262\n00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.234\nHow much money have I go to spend?\n\n263\n00:15:57.234 --> 00:16:02.006\nAnd then, A is for accounting,\nwhich is how much money have I spent?\n\n264\n00:16:02.006 --> 00:16:04.258\nAnd then C is for charging.\n\n265\n00:16:04.258 --> 00:16:05.770\nAnd charging is optional.\n\n266\n00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.698\nWe don't always want to cross\ncharge our organization,\n\n267\n00:16:08.698 --> 00:16:11.280\nalthough sometimes we do, okay.\n\n268\n00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.353\nSo think about, and\nwe'll start with the B.\n\n269\n00:16:13.353 --> 00:16:17.079\nSo within budgeting, we've got to know\nhow much money we've got to spend.\n\n270\n00:16:17.079 --> 00:16:20.049\nWe've got to know how we're\ngoing to spend that money?\n\n271\n00:16:20.049 --> 00:16:22.108\nIn other words, how is it allocated?\n\n272\n00:16:22.108 --> 00:16:25.211\nSome of it might be allocated for\noperational expenditure.\n\n273\n00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:28.900\nAnd some of it might be allocated for\ncapital expenditure.\n\n274\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.098\nSome of it might be allocated for\nspecific projects for instance.\n\n275\n00:16:33.098 --> 00:16:36.471\nSo we gotta have a tool that's\ngonna help us manage our budget.\n\n276\n00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:39.505\nAnd then we're also going\nto have that same tool,\n\n277\n00:16:39.505 --> 00:16:44.910\nI should hope, that's going to help us\naccount for how much money we have spent.\n\n278\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.870\nSo how much money have we spent\non operational expenditure?\n\n279\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:52.872\nOn the day to day, the bills,\nthe utility bills, etc, but also how much\n\n280\n00:16:52.872 --> 00:16:58.125\nmoney have we spent on capital\nexpenditures, such as the brand new PCs.\n\n281\n00:16:58.125 --> 00:17:02.616\nAnd by the way, if we're spending money on\ncapital expenditure, then the cost of that\n\n282\n00:17:02.616 --> 00:17:06.510\nPC, well that needs to be in the\nconfiguration management system as well.\n\n283\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.539\nSo we've got those relationships in place.\n\n284\n00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:12.966\nSo I'd expect to see\nrelationships in place between,\n\n285\n00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:17.880\nnot only financial management and,\nsay the projects for managing a budget for\n\n286\n00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.305\na new project and\nalso managing the business case, but\n\n287\n00:17:21.305 --> 00:17:25.975\nwe need to have a link in place with\nthe configuration management system.\n\n288\n00:17:25.975 --> 00:17:29.147\nThere needs to be a link in\nplace with problem management so\n\n289\n00:17:29.147 --> 00:17:33.113\nthat we can work out how much money\nwe're spending resolving problems.\n\n290\n00:17:33.113 --> 00:17:36.540\nAnd so that we know if we have\na link in with incident and\n\n291\n00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:42.060\nproblem management exactly how much time\nis being spent resolving an incident.\n\n292\n00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.862\nAnd we can work out then from\nthe average man-hour cost within IT,\n\n293\n00:17:46.862 --> 00:17:51.430\nwe can work out how much money it\ncost us to resolve an incident.\n\n294\n00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.753\nBecause we need to be able to give that\ninformation back to the business cuz that\n\n295\n00:17:55.753 --> 00:17:59.140\nhelps us with our budget for\nnext year as well.\n\n296\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.797\nSo we have all of our accounting models,\nall of our cost models,\n\n297\n00:18:02.797 --> 00:18:06.211\nand all of our cost types\ndefined in financial management.\n\n298\n00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:10.968\nWe also have our depreciation type\ndefined in financial management.\n\n299\n00:18:10.968 --> 00:18:14.466\nAnd you can find out a lot more about\nwhat we do in financial management in\n\n300\n00:18:14.466 --> 00:18:16.490\nthe service strategy class.\n\n301\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:21.250\nBut nevertheless, we need to have\na tool that has a relationship here\n\n302\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.220\nbetween configuration management and\nincident and problem management and\n\n303\n00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.310\ncapacity management,\nbecause capacity costs money, right?\n\n304\n00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.919\nAnd then availability management too.\n\n305\n00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:34.682\nAnd security management because\nsecurity precautions cost money.\n\n306\n00:18:34.682 --> 00:18:37.980\nAnd then also continuity,\nbecause continuity sites or\n\n307\n00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:42.834\ndisaster recovery sites, if you want to\ncall them that, they cost money as well.\n\n308\n00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:47.182\nAnd of course we have to pay utility\nbills at these continuity sites too.\n\n309\n00:18:47.182 --> 00:18:52.900\nSo again, we have to be able to account\nfor all of our money that's been spent.\n\n310\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.452\nAnd then that brings us on to the tool\nthat kind of looks at everything really\n\n311\n00:18:59.452 --> 00:19:02.286\nand that's the tool that extracts reports.\n\n312\n00:19:02.286 --> 00:19:05.437\nNow, I've always told you\nthat you don't go out and\n\n313\n00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:09.588\nbuy a tool just based on the fact\nthat it's got 500 reports because\n\n314\n00:19:09.588 --> 00:19:13.540\nyou're probably not going to use\nmore than one of those reports.\n\n315\n00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.785\n499 of those are going to be redundant.\n\n316\n00:19:16.785 --> 00:19:21.603\nYou only buy a tool that's going to allow\nyou to report on what you need to report\n\n317\n00:19:21.603 --> 00:19:25.837\non because the basis of knowledge\nmanagement is that we do not produce\n\n318\n00:19:25.837 --> 00:19:29.420\nreports just for\nthe sake of having a nice pretty picture.\n\n319\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:34.910\nWe have to be able to make a decision\nbased on any report that we produce, okay?\n\n320\n00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:42.150\nSo CSI is concerned with ensuring that\nwe're efficient with our reporting and\n\n321\n00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.400\nthat we can make a decision\nfrom any single report.\n\n322\n00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.990\nAnd if we can't make a decision, CSI are\nthe people that are gonna come along and\n\n323\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.040\nsay, hey, we don't need this report.\n\n324\n00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:57.390\nSo ultimately, in terms of tools,\nthis is not about the latest shiny toy.\n\n325\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.574\nThis is really about having\nthe relationships in place,\n\n326\n00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:05.219\nworking with knowledge management, to\nensure that those relationships will give\n\n327\n00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:09.820\nus the information that we need in order\nto identify improvement opportunities.\n\n328\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.692\nAnd also to be able to track\nimprovement opportunities throughout\n\n329\n00:20:14.692 --> 00:20:17.047\ntheir implementation as well.\n\n330\n00:20:17.047 --> 00:20:20.340\nSo as I said,\nit's not about the latest shiny gadget,\n\n331\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.930\nas much as I would love it to be,\nit's not.\n\n332\n00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's really about having those\n\n333\n00:20:25.197 --> 00:20:29.240\nrelationships in place that\nwill help us make decisions.\n\n334\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.270\nAnd one more thing that I\nreally want to add about tools.\n\n335\n00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.908\nIt was something that was mentioned in the\nfirst slide in this particular session,\n\n336\n00:20:36.908 --> 00:20:38.178\nis about automation.\n\n337\n00:20:38.178 --> 00:20:44.850\nAutomation is efficient when\nit's configured correctly.\n\n338\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.180\nSo we automate where appropriate.\n\n339\n00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.899\nSo we don't wanna look for\ntool that's going to do everything for us.\n\n340\n00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:56.960\nYou see, we'll only automate something\nonce we defined a particular process.\n\n341\n00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.950\nBut if the process has been\ndefined in an inefficient way,\n\n342\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.890\nthen all automation is going to do is just\ngonna get us to that bad result quicker.\n\n343\n00:21:06.586 --> 00:21:11.206\nSo, we're gonna have to ensure that before\nwe automate anything we configure it in\n\n344\n00:21:11.206 --> 00:21:15.364\nan efficient way because if we don't\nconfigure it efficiently and as I said\n\n345\n00:21:15.364 --> 00:21:19.856\nit's just gonna get us to the wrong result\njust a little bit quicker that's all.\n\n346\n00:21:19.856 --> 00:21:23.490\nSo be careful,\nautomation is not always the answer,\n\n347\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.930\nautomation is where appropriate.\n\n348\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.003\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, thank you again for\nhelping us take a look and\n\n349\n00:21:29.003 --> 00:21:33.300\nthinking about the idea of technology\nconsideration that are before us.\n\n350\n00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:37.160\nIt's always neat to think that maybe what\nwe need as an organization of course is\n\n351\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.270\none tool.\n\n352\n00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.840\nBut we might found out that that tool may\nbe of more of a detriment to us than just\n\n353\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.700\nmaking sure that the relationship\nbetween the tools we already have\n\n354\n00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.060\nare actually going to be for us.\n\n355\n00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.360\nSo keeping that in mind, remember to\ntake a look at your technology and\n\n356\n00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.810\nto consider whether or not they actually\nhelp you to track, identify and\n\n357\n00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.350\nvalidate the improvements\nthat you want to make.\n\n358\n00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.470\nWell that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n359\n00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.240\nSigning off from ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n360\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.240\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

00:00:04.982\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:08.258\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:12.157\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.210\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.060\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n9\n00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.660\ntoday we are gonna be taking a look at\nimplementation and communication for CSI.\n\n10\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.694\nAnd here to help us, of course,\nis gonna be well our IT diva herself Ms.\n\n11\n00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:31.450\nJo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.190\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.700\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.010\nI guess if I'm a dealer, what I really,\nreally need is plenty of drinks and\n\n15\n00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.698\nI need, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've got you a nice beverage.\n\n16\n00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:43.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:44.170\n&gt;&gt; I just need a green room,\n\n18\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.220\nokay, just for me.\n\n19\n00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've got one, too.\n\n20\n00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.390\nSo Jo, here it is, so here we are.\n\n21\n00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.580\nWe're taking a look at the idea of\nimplementation and communication.\n\n22\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.810\nThese two concepts, right, of course,\nimplementation sounds natural enough.\n\n23\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.630\nWe know that, well, continual service\nimprovement, somebody has to actually\n\n24\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.420\nimplement it, but the communication part,\nJoe, isn't that obvious?\n\n25\n00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.530\n&gt;&gt; You would like to think that\ncommunication was obvious and\n\n26\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.170\nthat communication is something that we\naddress actually in all of our life cycle\n\n27\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.280\nphases and predominantly in service\noperation and also in CSI as well.\n\n28\n00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.070\nBecause we need to look at who\nare we communicating with and\n\n29\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.320\nwhat we are communicating to them.\n\n30\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.210\nPeople are only interested\nin what's in it for me.\n\n31\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.570\nAnd if you get the communication wrong,\n\n32\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.900\nthen you're not really\ncommunicating at all.\n\n33\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.760\nAnd you can send out 150 emails per day,\nbut\n\n34\n00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.030\nif none of them are read then you\nmight as well not send out any.\n\n35\n00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.530\nSo it's really important that\nwe get communication right.\n\n36\n00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.530\nSo what we're gonna touch on in this\nsession is just where to start,\n\n37\n00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.960\nwhen we want to implement CSI.\n\n38\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.380\nBecause I've already mentioned in\nprevious episodes the fact that,\n\n39\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.510\nCSI, yeah it should come naturally,\nof course it should.\n\n40\n00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.840\nBut it's kind of often the thing\nthat we forget about the most, okay?\n\n41\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.560\nSo CSI tends to come to light when\nwe've got a challenge ahead of us,\n\n42\n00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.600\nwhen we've got an issue that\nwe've really got to tackle.\n\n43\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.160\nAnd so we're gonna look at where to start,\nand then we're also going to look\n\n44\n00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.350\njust really a communication principles,\nvery, very briefly.\n\n45\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.874\nJust understanding sort of\nwhat we're communicating and\n\n46\n00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:18.510\nwho we're communicating to.\n\n47\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.650\nBecause in order for CSI to be successful,\nyou couldn't tell people about it, right?\n\n48\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.320\nYou can't just assume that this\ngoing to happen in the background.\n\n49\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.260\nEspecially when it comes\nto adoption of CSI.\n\n50\n00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.470\nIn order for CSI to be adopted\nit's got to be accepted as\n\n51\n00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.960\na recognized practice\nwithin the organization.\n\n52\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.740\nWell, it's never gonna be accepted\nas a recognized practice within\n\n53\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.830\nthe organization if we don't actually\ncommunicate that we're doing it.\n\n54\n00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.440\nQuite often CSI, if it's done in the\nbackground, people don't know about it.\n\n55\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.470\nAnd therefore when we say yes\nwell that's our CSI manager.\n\n56\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.670\nThe first question is,\nwell why do we need one of those?\n\n57\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.230\nBecause we're doing this so\nwell on our own.\n\n58\n00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.120\nWell you're doing this so well because\nyou've got a CSI manager in place.\n\n59\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.846\nAnd this is where the problems lie and\nthen trying to justify why we're making\n\n60\n00:03:06.846 --> 00:03:11.333\nimprovements or justify why we have\ncertain positions because of course they\n\n61\n00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:15.425\ndon't see the visibility of those\npositions or those improvements.\n\n62\n00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:19.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo now that we\nunderstand that they do have to exist.\n\n63\n00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.851\nRight, we have to have a plan for\nimplementation.\n\n64\n00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.593\nWe have to also know about\nthe idea of communicating.\n\n65\n00:03:24.593 --> 00:03:29.068\nWe've also in episode previous to this,\nwe've talked about the importance of\n\n66\n00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:33.277\nthe ownership and the responsible\nperson for this, we've got everything\n\n67\n00:03:33.277 --> 00:03:37.720\nin placed Joe, so where are we going to\nbegin in terms of implementation here?\n\n68\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.753\n&gt;&gt; Well the first thing that we need\nto do is to find somewhere to start.\n\n69\n00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.755\nAnd pick a pain point, and\n\n70\n00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:47.760\nthat's really the obvious answer\nto this is to pick a pain point.\n\n71\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.800\nWhether it's a pain point\nwithin a service, or\n\n72\n00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.910\nwhether it's a pain point within,\nwe call it a lifecycle approach.\n\n73\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.460\nBut if it's a pain point within a process,\nor\n\n74\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.200\nwhether it's a pain point\nwithin a team itself.\n\n75\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.970\nWe've got to improve, and we have to\nensure that our improvements are targeted.\n\n76\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.020\nSo, we can start with a service, and quite\noften we'll see a service that's failing.\n\n77\n00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.070\nNow service level management is going to\ntell us whether a service is failing or\n\n78\n00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.120\nnot, because service level management\nsees those slam charts and\n\n79\n00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.110\nthose red charts that we've\nreferred to in previous episodes.\n\n80\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.650\nSo, we can start with a service or\nwe can start with a process,\n\n81\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.860\nthe lifecycle approach.\n\n82\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.140\nIn other words, maybe we've got\na problem with that handover from\n\n83\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.890\nservice design to service transition.\n\n84\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.640\nIn other words, the service design\npackage may be of poor quality,\n\n85\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.300\nor maybe service transition\naren't signing off.\n\n86\n00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.260\nOr maybe we've got a problem with getting\nbusiness cases approved and therefore\n\n87\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.060\nthe hand over from strategy to service\ndesign is not going particularly smoothly.\n\n88\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.510\nSo we pick a pin point within\nthe actual service lifecycle itself.\n\n89\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.660\nSomewhere where we're not transitioning\nfrom one process to another, or\n\n90\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.470\nwhere we're not transitioning from\none lifecycle phase to another.\n\n91\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.310\nYou might see that as a communication\nissue, but there are genuine\n\n92\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.251\nfailures that are caused by that\nlack of integration should we say.\n\n93\n00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:16.430\nAnd then of course there's the functional\ngroup, in other words the team.\n\n94\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.060\nThe example that we've got up there is\nthat, if server failure is an issue,\n\n95\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.570\nit might not necessarily\nbe a hardware problem.\n\n96\n00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.640\nIt might actually be that the team are\njust not functioning in the way that they\n\n97\n00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.210\nneed to function in order to keep\nthe service up in the morning or\n\n98\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.970\nmaybe to actually fix the service\nwhen something goes wrong.\n\n99\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.320\nSo we need to be able to identify and\n\n100\n00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.360\nrecognize when there is\na problem with a team.\n\n101\n00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.080\nNow it could be lack of coordination,\n\n102\n00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.250\nit could be a lack of experience or\nlack of skills, or\n\n103\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.800\nit could quite simply be an interpersonal\nproblem that we have to deal with.\n\n104\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.770\nNevertheless, we have to accept\nthat these things happen and so,\n\n105\n00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.540\nwe can't just bury our head in the sand.\n\n106\n00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.660\nWe do that Sometimes in IT.\n\n107\n00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.270\nWe don't want to address\nthe elephant in the room.\n\n108\n00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.110\nWe don't want to address the fact\nthat we've got an issue here and\n\n109\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.740\nthere's something wrong with the team\nwork, and it's not really coming together.\n\n110\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.710\nWe're not working as a cohesive team and\n\n111\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.200\nour services are suffering\nbecause of that.\n\n112\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.700\nSo pick a pain point,\nthis is what I will tell you to do.\n\n113\n00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.750\nStart either with a particular service,\n\n114\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.625\na service that's just not\nfunctioning in the way it should be.\n\n115\n00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:32.410\nAnd, Service level management's\ngoing to help us with that.\n\n116\n00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.020\nThe service desk itself,\n\n117\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.300\nthey're going to tell us what\nservices cause the most issues, too.\n\n118\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.790\nThey've got all of that information\nin their call logging system.\n\n119\n00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.420\nLook at the number of incidents and\n\n120\n00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.350\nthe number of problems we\nhave with any service.\n\n121\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.450\nStart with a lifecycle approach.\n\n122\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.130\nNow that one's going to be\nmore difficult to identify but\n\n123\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.220\njust think about transitions,\ntransitions from one process to another or\n\n124\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.380\ntransitions from one\nlifecycle phase to another.\n\n125\n00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.260\nIf there is a failure in a relationship,\n\n126\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.690\nthen that's what we call a life cycle\napproach, and we've got to address that.\n\n127\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.980\nAnd that's not a case of addressing\nit with an individual process.\n\n128\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.160\nIt's a case of addressing it with\nthe relationship between two processes or\n\n129\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.285\ntwo lifecycle phases.\n\n130\n00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:17.125\nAnd then of course we've got\nthe team issue as well, so\n\n131\n00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:19.933\nwe may choose to start with the team.\n\n132\n00:07:19.933 --> 00:07:22.815\nWhatever your pain point is,\nthat's where you implement CSI,\n\n133\n00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:25.065\nthat's here you need to\nmake the improvement.\n\n134\n00:07:26.215 --> 00:07:28.105\nNow, don't forget governance.\n\n135\n00:07:28.105 --> 00:07:30.285\nGovernance is really important to us.\n\n136\n00:07:30.285 --> 00:07:33.445\nAnd this is identified\nfrom service strategy.\n\n137\n00:07:33.445 --> 00:07:38.040\nService strategy sets\nouts governance ethics.\n\n138\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.340\nHow we're going to work, what our\npolicies are, the way that we work.\n\n139\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.866\nThings like in supplier\nmanagement how long do we\n\n140\n00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:48.534\nnegotiate a supplier contract for?\n\n141\n00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:53.672\nDo we negotiate a contract on an ad-hoc\nbasis until it expires naturally?\n\n142\n00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:56.772\nOr do we negotiate a contract\nevery three years?\n\n143\n00:07:56.772 --> 00:07:59.278\nOr do we negotiate a ten year contract?\n\n144\n00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:02.714\nAnd then when it comes to contract\nrenewal, do we have to go out and\n\n145\n00:08:02.714 --> 00:08:05.600\nfollow a tender process, or\ncan we just simply renew?\n\n146\n00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.730\nWell, that's completely dependent on the\norganization at some of those instances.\n\n147\n00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.940\nIf you're working in a government\norganization, for instance,\n\n148\n00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.850\nyou have to go out to\ntender with every contract.\n\n149\n00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:23.194\nYou have to go out and offer that service\nto suppliers every time you renew.\n\n150\n00:08:23.194 --> 00:08:25.741\nThe tendency with government\ncontracts is that, well,\n\n151\n00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:29.347\nyou're gonna negotiate a contract for\nmaybe 10 years because you don't wanna\n\n152\n00:08:29.347 --> 00:08:32.865\ngo through the tender process again,\ncuz that can be quite a lengthy process.\n\n153\n00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:36.900\nIt can take a year in itself just\nto go through the tender process.\n\n154\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:44.798\nYour organization is gonna tell you how\nthey expect us in IT to be governed, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:48.621\nThey will settle a lot of the policies,\nbut nevertheless,\n\n156\n00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:53.211\nit's up to strategy management within\nservice strategy to then define\n\n157\n00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:58.040\nour own individual governance ethics and\npolicies within IT.\n\n158\n00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.670\nThink about things like recycling.\n\n159\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.960\nNow, for some of us,\nrecycling is a legal requirement, and\n\n160\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.880\nwe cannot just dispose of hardware.\n\n161\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.222\nFor others around the world,\nrecycling is not a legal requirement.\n\n162\n00:09:10.222 --> 00:09:14.405\nAnd so what will tend to happen is\norganizations that exist in many\n\n163\n00:09:14.405 --> 00:09:18.362\ncountries, international\norganizations will want to adopt\n\n164\n00:09:18.362 --> 00:09:22.850\nthe same ethical policy right away\naround the globe because it makes it\n\n165\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.602\neasier from a governance from\na management perspective.\n\n166\n00:09:26.602 --> 00:09:31.479\nSo they may impose recycling\non those areas of the world\n\n167\n00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:35.304\nwhere recycling is not important to them.\n\n168\n00:09:35.304 --> 00:09:39.710\nSo there has to be a comprehensive and an\nintegrated approach to governance, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.520\nGovernance has to apply across the board.\n\n170\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.720\nGovernance is not just something\nthat we use in service strategy and\n\n171\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.010\nthen we forget about.\n\n172\n00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.650\nGovernance applies to the way\nthat we work throughout IT.\n\n173\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:55.030\nUltimately, don't forget, we've got to be\naligned to the needs of the organization.\n\n174\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.390\nAnd therefore, those governance policies\nthat the organization set, well,\n\n175\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.320\nwe've got to be aligned to those.\n\n176\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.300\nSo in all of our policies,\nwe've got to be aligned to their needs.\n\n177\n00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.602\nNow, I want to bring in something\ncalled COBIT, Control Objectives for\n\n178\n00:10:08.602 --> 00:10:10.397\nInformation and related Technology.\n\n179\n00:10:10.397 --> 00:10:15.705\nAnd I can honestly say that in\nrecent months, I've had a lot of\n\n180\n00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:21.946\ninterest from various organizations\nrelating specifically to COBIT.\n\n181\n00:10:21.946 --> 00:10:26.192\nNow, it came from the finance industry,\nand\n\n182\n00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:31.781\nCOBIT came along as a framework for\nfinancial industries,\n\n183\n00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:35.694\nfinancial organizations, to define and\n\n184\n00:10:35.694 --> 00:10:42.660\nintegrate strategies within IT,\nwith organizational strategies.\n\n185\n00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.130\nSo it is all about, it says there, it\ncovers governance of strategic alignment.\n\n186\n00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.360\nIt really focuses on value delivery.\n\n187\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:56.670\nIt focuses on being at a strategic level,\nbeing aligned to the organization.\n\n188\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:02.390\nIt does not focus on\noperational performance at all.\n\n189\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.880\nIt doesn't have any focus on\nthe business as usual side of IT.\n\n190\n00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.334\nThis is all about ensuring\nthat from a strategic level,\n\n191\n00:11:11.334 --> 00:11:14.475\nwe deliver value to the organization.\n\n192\n00:11:14.475 --> 00:11:18.813\nSo think about it as COBIT focusses\nunder what we've got to achieve and\n\n193\n00:11:18.813 --> 00:11:22.793\nthe alignment with the organization\nthat we've got to attain.\n\n194\n00:11:22.793 --> 00:11:26.999\nWhereas ITIL focuses under\nhow we're going to do it, and\n\n195\n00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:32.100\nwe have the processes in place\nto facilitate that achievement.\n\n196\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.770\nAnd a lot of organizations,\n\n197\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:38.450\nespecially financial organizations,\nwill want to work towards a COBIT audit.\n\n198\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.447\nAnd that's great, but ITIL will actually\nhelp you achieve that COBIT audit.\n\n199\n00:11:43.447 --> 00:11:48.033\nWithout ITIL, without the processes in\nplace to run the business as usual,\n\n200\n00:11:48.033 --> 00:11:52.978\nit doesn't matter how well-aligned your\nstrategy is, you're never going to be\n\n201\n00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:56.793\nable to realize that strategy\nwithout being able to manage IT.\n\n202\n00:11:56.793 --> 00:12:02.236\nSo COBIT does have a very important\npart to play in some organizations,\n\n203\n00:12:02.236 --> 00:12:05.510\nspecifically financial organizations.\n\n204\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.160\nBut that doesn't mean that ITIL\ndoesn't have a part to play in those\n\n205\n00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160\norganizations.\n\n206\n00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.060\nAnd as it said, ITIL will tell you\nhow we can achieve your COBIT audit,\n\n207\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.020\nand will help you achieve\nyour COBIT audit.\n\n208\n00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.850\nSo let's talk about communications then,\n\n209\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.210\nbecause I know that we mentioned\ncommunication a little while ago.\n\n210\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.160\nAnd I said, well, we have to have a clear\nplan for communication, and we have to\n\n211\n00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.990\nunderstand who we're communicating to and\nwhy we're communicating.\n\n212\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.870\nWe want to have a formal\ncommunication plan.\n\n213\n00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.250\nAnd I know that the tendency is to say,\nwell look,\n\n214\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.680\nwe're communicating all the time, so\nwhy do we need to formalize this?\n\n215\n00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.110\nWhy can't we just send an email?\n\n216\n00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.770\nWell, people expect communications.\n\n217\n00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:56.160\nIf you send an email every\nMonday morning at nine o'clock,\n\n218\n00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.649\npeople notice when they\ndon't receive that email.\n\n219\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.760\nI've got a few emails that I get from\na few companies that I receive over night,\n\n220\n00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.740\nevery night, and I get every morning.\n\n221\n00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.969\nWhen I open up my laptop,\nI get this email.\n\n222\n00:13:07.969 --> 00:13:11.290\nNow, when I don't receive that email,\nI don't necessarily read that email,\n\n223\n00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.191\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n224\n00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:15.998\nBut when I don't receive that email,\nmy first question is,\n\n225\n00:13:15.998 --> 00:13:18.472\nI wonder why I haven't got that today.\n\n226\n00:13:18.472 --> 00:13:22.280\nYou expect it, you expect certain things.\n\n227\n00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.510\nSo this is why we should have\na formal communication plan.\n\n228\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.861\nThe other thing is that if I don't receive\nthat email for a specific period of time,\n\n229\n00:13:30.861 --> 00:13:34.924\nlet's say maybe three of four days,\nthen I stop expecting it.\n\n230\n00:13:34.924 --> 00:13:40.648\nAnd when I get it again, then I might\nnot see the importance of it anymore.\n\n231\n00:13:40.648 --> 00:13:44.255\nBecause if it wasn't important enough\nto send it for the last three days,\n\n232\n00:13:44.255 --> 00:13:45.732\nthen why should I read it now?\n\n233\n00:13:45.732 --> 00:13:51.450\nCommunication is really important, and\nthere are various ways of communication.\n\n234\n00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.440\nAnd I've just talked about emails, but one\nof our communication principles within CSI\n\n235\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.597\nis the fact that communication\nis a two-way process.\n\n236\n00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:07.730\nCommunication is both to an audience and\nalso from an audience.\n\n237\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.870\nAnd feedback is incredibly important.\n\n238\n00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.090\nWe should always give opportunity for\nfeedback.\n\n239\n00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:17.860\nI've said numerous times, communication\nshould be in the language of the audience,\n\n240\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.830\nand it should also answer the question,\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n241\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.680\nThink about how you're communicating.\n\n242\n00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.650\nWe can improve communication,\nand that's why it's in CSI.\n\n243\n00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.190\nCuz we can improve it,\nwe can get better at it.\n\n244\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.930\nI will always improve my communication and\n\n245\n00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.580\nthe way I talk based on\nmy feedback from you.\n\n246\n00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.530\nIf you don't like the way\nI've done something, or\n\n247\n00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:42.500\nyou don't like what I've said, and I'm\ngonna take that forward, and next time,\n\n248\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.330\nmaybe I won't actually say that, or maybe\nI will do something slightly different.\n\n249\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.132\nIf I made an organization\nduring consultancy,\n\n250\n00:14:50.132 --> 00:14:54.335\nor maybe I am doing a presentation and\nthen a particular organization,\n\n251\n00:14:54.335 --> 00:14:59.320\nif I see somebody asleep, then that tells\nme that I'm not communicating very well.\n\n252\n00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.288\nIf I hear somebody snore, and\nthen that tells me I've really,\n\n253\n00:15:02.288 --> 00:15:04.032\nreally got to work on things, okay?\n\n254\n00:15:04.032 --> 00:15:06.540\nSo communications is very important.\n\n255\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.773\nAnd the first thing that we've got to\ndo is we've gotta work at who we're\n\n256\n00:15:09.773 --> 00:15:10.750\ncommunicating to.\n\n257\n00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.960\nSo that's our target audience.\n\n258\n00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.044\nAnd what is it we need to tell them,\nand how are we going to tell them?\n\n259\n00:15:18.044 --> 00:15:20.425\nThe method of communication\nis really important.\n\n260\n00:15:20.425 --> 00:15:21.823\nThink about email.\n\n261\n00:15:21.823 --> 00:15:26.240\nWe all know the general\nguidance on the email.\n\n262\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.780\nDon't put a joke in email cuz the person\nwho's reading it might not be in a great\n\n263\n00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.061\nmood that day, and they might\nmisconstrue something that you've said.\n\n264\n00:15:33.061 --> 00:15:37.180\nWe all know that, but what about\nthe other principles of email, too?\n\n265\n00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:41.629\nAnd the principles of email in that any\nemail that you send could end up anywhere.\n\n266\n00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:45.007\nSo don't forget, it's been written down,\nand it could be passed on.\n\n267\n00:15:45.007 --> 00:15:45.599\nSo really,\n\n268\n00:15:45.599 --> 00:15:49.700\nyou don't need to be saying anything in\nyour email that you shouldn't be saying.\n\n269\n00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.351\nBut also,\nthink about how long is your email?\n\n270\n00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:58.131\nI mean, I don't know about you personally\nbut there's a general principle that says\n\n271\n00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:02.540\nif it's longer than one page then people\naren't going to scroll down and read it.\n\n272\n00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.683\nI was in a position quite some\ntime ago now where I went to\n\n273\n00:16:06.683 --> 00:16:10.659\nconduct an executive\noverview to an organization.\n\n274\n00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:15.158\nAnd this particular organization,\nwe had 50 people that had turned up for\n\n275\n00:16:15.158 --> 00:16:18.967\nthis executive overview and\nI thought to myself, 50 people?\n\n276\n00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:23.700\nSurely there's not 50 board of directors\nfor this particular organization.\n\n277\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.999\nAnd sure enough, they hadn't read\ndown in the email to see who\n\n278\n00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:32.228\nthe target audience was for\nthat particular presentation.\n\n279\n00:16:32.228 --> 00:16:35.468\nAnd so if you don't put it\nthere right in front of them,\n\n280\n00:16:35.468 --> 00:16:38.920\nthen people aren't going to scroll down.\n\n281\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.730\nAnd then think about other\nmedium of communication,\n\n282\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:46.100\nthings like town hall meetings or\nvideo communication.\n\n283\n00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.220\nWell that's great, but then how\nare you gonna obtain the feedback?\n\n284\n00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.130\nAnd I'll be the one that says to you,\nhey we've got a forum, we've got a chat,\n\n285\n00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:59.182\nthen please tell us how you feel, ask me\nany questions and I will answer you back.\n\n286\n00:16:59.182 --> 00:17:00.880\nNow obviously this has been recorded so\n\n287\n00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.810\nI'm not going to answer\nyou back in real-time.\n\n288\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.523\nI can't answer your question right\nnow while I'm talking to you,\n\n289\n00:17:07.523 --> 00:17:08.924\nalthough I wish I could.\n\n290\n00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:12.432\n[LAUGH] But\nI am going to come back to you.\n\n291\n00:17:12.432 --> 00:17:15.360\nBut I don't know when you're going\nto be watching this recording.\n\n292\n00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.810\nAnd what about other\ntypes of communication.\n\n293\n00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.260\nIf we're launching a new project then some\npeople could be very wary about the state\n\n294\n00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:29.530\nof their roles of the state of their\ncurrent position within the organization.\n\n295\n00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.038\nWell you're certainly\nnot going to just tell\n\n296\n00:17:32.038 --> 00:17:35.281\nthem something like that via a text or\nvia an email are you?\n\n297\n00:17:35.281 --> 00:17:39.237\nSurely you're going to sit down with them\nand explain this is what's happening and\n\n298\n00:17:39.237 --> 00:17:40.830\nthis is how it's affecting you.\n\n299\n00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.420\nWe should communicate on a regular basis.\n\n300\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.159\nAnd communication shouldn't\nbe a one-off thing.\n\n301\n00:17:47.159 --> 00:17:51.641\nWe should have senior management buy\nin for all of our communication, so\n\n302\n00:17:51.641 --> 00:17:55.095\nthat everybody understands\nthat no matter what you're\n\n303\n00:17:55.095 --> 00:18:00.500\ncommunicating at whatever level,\nyou have the support of senior management.\n\n304\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.530\nBut communication should be regular.\n\n305\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.280\nDon't just tell somebody we're launching\na new project and then walk away and leave\n\n306\n00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:11.090\nthem, because that's when speculation\nstarts, that's when rumours start, and\n\n307\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.810\nthat's how projects and improvement\ninitiatives end up being undermined.\n\n308\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.500\nBecause rumors start, speculation happens.\n\n309\n00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.340\nAnd if we don't tell somebody something,\nbelieve me,\n\n310\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.460\nsomebody's gonna make it up, okay?\n\n311\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.870\nSo we have to think about\nhow we communicate.\n\n312\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.490\nSo before we prepare any communication,\n\n313\n00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.090\nlet's think about who we're\ncommunicating to, and\n\n314\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.560\nhow often we should communicate to them,\nand what messages we wanna communicate.\n\n315\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.320\nIf I see an email every single day\nthen I'm not really interested in\n\n316\n00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.520\nreading that email.\n\n317\n00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:48.230\nBut if I see one once a week then I'm\ndefinitely going to be interested.\n\n318\n00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.015\nI am really interested in that.\n\n319\n00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:55.626\nSorry, excuse me,\nI lost my train of thought there.\n\n320\n00:18:55.626 --> 00:19:00.109\nSo the portion there that says,\nneed to be aware of losing the focus.\n\n321\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.060\nTake a look at that flashlight,\nthat torch that's on the right hand side.\n\n322\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:11.380\nWhat I want you to get away from, or\ntake away from this, is the fact that,\n\n323\n00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.320\nthe further away from the vision that\nyou are the less it means to you,\n\n324\n00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.300\nthe more diluted that message becomes.\n\n325\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.410\nSo at a strategic level,\nright up there at that strategic level,\n\n326\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.280\nthe communication at that\nlevel needs to be strategic.\n\n327\n00:19:33.778 --> 00:19:38.650\nThe communication at that level\ndoesn't need to get into the nuances\n\n328\n00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.300\nof the actual technologies that\nwe're going to be updating.\n\n329\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.380\nIt doesn't need to get into the nitty\ngritty, it doesn't need to answer\n\n330\n00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.110\nquestions like, does that mean I still\ncome in at 9 AM on Monday morning?\n\n331\n00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.690\nThat's not what needs to be\ncommunicated at that level,\n\n332\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.420\nat that level we're\ncommunicating the vision.\n\n333\n00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.760\nBut the further down we move towards\ntactical and operational level,\n\n334\n00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.480\nthen the more relevant that communication\nneeds to be to that individual level.\n\n335\n00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.320\nSo from an operational level we're\nthinking about communicating, okay,\n\n336\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.230\ndo I need to be in at nine\no'clock on Monday morning?\n\n337\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:18.371\nExactly what is this going to mean to me,\nhow is this process going to change?\n\n338\n00:20:18.371 --> 00:20:22.268\nSo think about who you're\ncommunicating what to.\n\n339\n00:20:22.268 --> 00:20:26.120\nAnd the demand, as it says,\nis driven by that level above it.\n\n340\n00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.380\nSo if I've communicated at the top level\nthat there's going to be a change,\n\n341\n00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:35.270\nthen at the tactical level then I'm\nhungry to know about that change.\n\n342\n00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.400\nAnd at the operational level I'm asking\nthat question what's in it for me?\n\n343\n00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:44.065\nAnd don't forget those\narrows are bi-directional.\n\n344\n00:20:44.065 --> 00:20:50.055\nCommunication is a two-way process, so\nwe have to be prepared to accept feedback.\n\n345\n00:20:50.055 --> 00:20:52.855\nAnd it doesn't matter what\nlevel we're communicating at,\n\n346\n00:20:53.985 --> 00:20:57.925\nwe have to give a vehicle for feedback.\n\n347\n00:20:57.925 --> 00:21:01.895\nWe have to provide some form of\nopportunity to feed it back.\n\n348\n00:21:01.895 --> 00:21:06.281\nThen in exactly the same way I will\nsay to you look, we've got a forum.\n\n349\n00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:09.420\nAnd if you have any questions please\ncome back to us on the forum and\n\n350\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.440\nI'll be happy to answer any\nof those questions for you.\n\n351\n00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:18.501\nWell, we have to do that at every single\nlevel and with any form of communication.\n\n352\n00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:24.463\nSo now, over the last few sessions\nwe've looked at implementing CSI.\n\n353\n00:21:24.463 --> 00:21:27.696\nWe've looked at where we start\nwhen we're implementing CSI,\n\n354\n00:21:27.696 --> 00:21:31.661\nwe've looked at communication,\nwe've also in a previous episode looked at\n\n355\n00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:34.680\ntechnology considerations\nas well with CSI.\n\n356\n00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.382\nAnd now within the course material that\nyou've downloaded you have some exercises,\n\n357\n00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:43.427\nand those exercises are going to take\nyou around about an hour to an hour and\n\n358\n00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:44.554\na half to complete.\n\n359\n00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:47.801\nSo I would like you to go away and\ntake a look at the exercises,\n\n360\n00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:52.620\nthey're to do with technology and\nalso implementation and communication.\n\n361\n00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.990\nAnd by all means,\nplease come back to us on the forum.\n\n362\n00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.670\nLet us know how you feel about\nthe exercises, let us know how you get on.\n\n363\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.290\nAnd if you have any questions,\nthen I'll be happy to answer them for you.\n\n364\n00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:04.810\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo.\n\n365\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.040\nWell thank you again for helping us out\nhere in understanding the importance\n\n366\n00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.800\nof the implementation as\nwell as the communication\n\n367\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.930\nto help us to get started in our\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n368\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.620\nAs well, make sure you also\ntake Jo's advice there and\n\n369\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.430\ndo the homework that's required.\n\n370\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.421\nBefore you move on, make sure these\nconcepts are solidified in your mind.\n\n371\n00:22:23.421 --> 00:22:26.610\nWell that's a great place for\nus to sign off for this episode then.\n\n372\n00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.770\nFor ITPRO.TV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n373\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:30.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n374\n00:22:30.810

00:00:11.924\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:15.260\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.660\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate CSI show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.220\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.480\nAnd today,\nwe're gonna be diving into challenges,\n\n8\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.710\ncritical success factors and\nrisks for CSI.\n\n9\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.420\nAnd here to help us,\n\n10\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.140\nof course, is gonna be our ITIL\ngrammarian herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.310\nJo, welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Ronnie, yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.150\nPleased to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.540\nI'm not so sure whether I'm\npleased to be here after that.\n\n15\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.626\n&gt;&gt; What, a grammarian, that's great.\n\n16\n00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:47.680\nYou are our great grammarian.\n\n17\n00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n18\n00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.205\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n19\n00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:52.615\n[LAUGH] All right, Jo, now,\nas you actually understand, that was a bit\n\n20\n00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:56.660\ntongue-twisting for me to actually have to\nsay all of those different plurals there.\n\n21\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.680\nSo Jo, when it comes down to the idea of\nchallenges and critical success factors,\n\n22\n00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.900\nthose don't seem to go together, but nor\ndo risks seem to actually go together with\n\n23\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.960\nthe critical success factors and\nwell, risk either.\n\n24\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.530\nSo Jo, these seem a little bit disparate\nhere in what we're talking about.\n\n25\n00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.810\nSo what are some of the challenges\nthat we actually have to think about?\n\n26\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.010\nAnd how are we gonna combine all of those\ntogether to help us out in what we're\n\n27\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.295\ntaking a look at?\n\n28\n00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.572\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're gonna take a look\nat really in this section, and\n\n29\n00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:24.761\nthis is just a very small section.\n\n30\n00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:30.620\nJust where we cover the challenges that we\nface when we're trying to implement CSI.\n\n31\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.040\nNow, we have covered some of\nthese in previous sections.\n\n32\n00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.480\nBut we're going to just take a brief\nlook at the challenges that we face.\n\n33\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.450\nAnd then also, what we have to\nachieve when we want to implement CSI.\n\n34\n00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.850\nSo what are our critical success factors?\n\n35\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.900\nAnd the risks to those things\nthat could cause us to fail.\n\n36\n00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.354\nThose things that once we've\ngot CSI implemented, well,\n\n37\n00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:55.510\nwhat could come along and really throw\na spanner in the works as it were.\n\n38\n00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.150\nSo anything that could\ncause us to fail in CSI.\n\n39\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.020\nSo we're going to just launch straight\ninto it, and we'll take a look at\n\n40\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.920\nsome of the challenges that we're\ngoing to face when we implement CSI.\n\n41\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.750\nYou know what?\n\n42\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.090\nOne of the first things that I always\nmention whenever it comes to implementing\n\n43\n00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.130\nany ITIL process in any life cycle phase\nis always that management commitment.\n\n44\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.800\nWe have to have visible\nongoing management commitment.\n\n45\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.620\nIt's not just enough for\nour senior management to stand up right at\n\n46\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.050\nthe beginning of any project and say,\nhey, this is a great idea, and then\n\n47\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.510\nnot continue on with that commitment and\nnot continue on with that support.\n\n48\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.720\nWe need to have visible commitment,\nand we need to have visible support,\n\n49\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.240\nand it has to be ongoing\nthroughout any project.\n\n50\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.119\nSo therefore, there has to be a commitment\nfrom management to ensure that CSI works.\n\n51\n00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:54.880\nCSI, kind of similar to\nservice continuity, really.\n\n52\n00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.870\nIt's that invisible part\nof IT service management\n\n53\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.830\nthat sits in the background and,\nunlike service continuity management,\n\n54\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.360\nthat only actually comes\ninto play every now and\n\n55\n00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.050\nthen, hopefully,\nif something seriously goes wrong.\n\n56\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.720\nWell, CSI should be\nworking all of the time.\n\n57\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.550\nBut CSI is generally not\nparticularly visible.\n\n58\n00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.100\nUnless we take the time and we perform\nall of the communication in order\n\n59\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.250\nto market ourselves and tell everybody,\nthat actually, we're here.\n\n60\n00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.440\nAnd this is the work that we're doing,\nand that we're involved in\n\n61\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.340\nevery single process and\nwe're involved in every single service.\n\n62\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.600\nSo management commitment and management\nbuy-in is really going to be key for\n\n63\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.870\nus because management\ngives us that support.\n\n64\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.138\nManagement also approves\nall of the budget.\n\n65\n00:03:47.138 --> 00:03:51.670\nManagement approves the spending for\nany improvement initiatives.\n\n66\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.370\nAnd management will be\nthe people that will ensure,\n\n67\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.090\nas that CSI carries on,\nthat CSI is not just a one-off activity.\n\n68\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.210\nSometimes budget is allocated just purely\non a one-off basis, on a project basis.\n\n69\n00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.230\nSo, having that management commitment,\nwill ensure that that does carry on.\n\n70\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.000\nSo what about all the challenges\nthat we have then?\n\n71\n00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.470\nWell, we talk about lack\nof mature processes and\n\n72\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.930\nlack of knowledge management,\nand lack of information.\n\n73\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.940\nWell, if we don't have a mature\nknowledge management process,\n\n74\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.140\nthen it's going to be very difficult.\n\n75\n00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.570\nBut there again,\ntake a look at the previous episode.\n\n76\n00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.560\nAnd in the previous episode,\nwe looked at where do we start.\n\n77\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.500\nIf we don't have mature processes,\nperhaps that's where we need to start.\n\n78\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.320\nPerhaps we need to start looking at\nthe maturity of our processes, and\n\n79\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.110\nthat in itself is\nan improvement initiative.\n\n80\n00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.420\nSo, despite the fact that these,\neverything that's listed in front of you\n\n81\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.600\nright now on the slide, despite the fact\nthat these could be challenges,\n\n82\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.140\neach one of these is\nan improvement in its own right.\n\n83\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.020\nYou know, resistance.\n\n84\n00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.390\nWell, resistance to any change,\nif we can overcome resistance,\n\n85\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.490\nthen that is an improvement\nin its own right.\n\n86\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.450\nNow, lack of corporate objectives.\n\n87\n00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.970\nWe cannot give the corporation\ntheir business,\n\n88\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.400\ntheir objectives and\ntheir strategies and their vision.\n\n89\n00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.170\nWe can't do that, but\nwe can certainly help to drive that.\n\n90\n00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.060\nSo, if we can understand whether\nthe business is wanting to run or\n\n91\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.690\nwhether it's wanting to grow or\nwhether it's wanting to transform,\n\n92\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.850\nthen we can certainly help to drive that,\nwe can facilitate that.\n\n93\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.450\nSo whilst we can't give them their vision,\nand\n\n94\n00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.690\nwe can't give them their strategies,\nwe can certainly influence them.\n\n95\n00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.880\nAnd we can certainly help to drive that,\nokay?\n\n96\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.940\nAnd then look at other things.\n\n97\n00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.759\nWe've talked about disparate technologies,\nfor instance.\n\n98\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.620\nNow, in a previous episode, again,\nI looked at technology, and\n\n99\n00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.700\nwe looked at the relationships\nthat had to exist between\n\n100\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.490\nall of our technology sources and\nall of our data sources.\n\n101\n00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.260\nAnd so, at this point in time, if we\ndon't have all of those relationships,\n\n102\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.920\nwell, again, we need to consider that\nthis is an improvement initiative that we\n\n103\n00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.080\nshould be implemented,\nbecause we need to have\n\n104\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.610\nthose relationships in place in order\nto be both efficient and effective.\n\n105\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.890\nNow, one that I do want to draw your\nattention to is the poor relationships and\n\n106\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.510\npoor communication.\n\n107\n00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.740\nAnd I've mentioned this, and I will\nmention this throughout every single ITIL\n\n108\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.040\nsession, that communication is going to\nbe what causes failure to any change.\n\n109\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.280\nOr communication could\nbe what drives success.\n\n110\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.590\nAnd it's really important that we\nget the right level of communication\n\n111\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.650\nin the right language\nto the right audience.\n\n112\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.780\nAnd without the ability to communicate,\nand let's face it,\n\n113\n00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.190\nsome people just aren't\ngreat communicators.\n\n114\n00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.250\nBut some people\nare excellent communicators,\n\n115\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.860\nbut not very good technically.\n\n116\n00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.530\nSo, we have to get the right\npeople in the right roles.\n\n117\n00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.300\nAnd with the right skills,\n\n118\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.750\nthen we can effectively implement CSI,\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n119\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.879\nOne of those skills being\ncommunication skills.\n\n120\n00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.600\nAlso remember that we\ndon't have to go out and\n\n121\n00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.000\nbuy a costly tool in\norder to implement CSI.\n\n122\n00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.270\nCSI, yes we need to have a CSI register.\n\n123\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.600\nBut CSI is looking at the relationships\nbetween all of our tools and\n\n124\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.010\nthe relationships between all of\nour processes and our services.\n\n125\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.020\nSo CSI is going to work with\nwhat we have right now.\n\n126\n00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.610\nNow, yeah we need to have a CSI register\nand that can either be a database or\n\n127\n00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.650\nit can be, start off simple,\nwith an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n128\n00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.195\nNow, it depends on the scale\nof the organization.\n\n129\n00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:36.270\nThe smaller the organization,\n\n130\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.965\nwell, perhaps,\nthe simpler that CSI register should be.\n\n131\n00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:45.225\nThe larger the organization,\nthen the more complex the database can be.\n\n132\n00:07:45.225 --> 00:07:49.445\nKeep it simple is one of\nour CSI guiding principles.\n\n133\n00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:53.991\nWhen it comes to implementing CSI,\nwe must keep it simple.\n\n134\n00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:58.331\nAnd then let's take a look at\nthe poor supplier management.\n\n135\n00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:02.071\nWe already have suppliers in place.\n\n136\n00:08:02.071 --> 00:08:04.250\nAnd we're not telling you\nthat you need to go out and\n\n137\n00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.220\nrenegotiate all of your contracts\nwith all of your suppliers.\n\n138\n00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.280\nCuz if you have to go out\nthrough attend the process,\n\n139\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.480\nthen that's not going to happen anyway.\n\n140\n00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.037\nAnd let's face it,\nit's not exactly efficient to go out and\n\n141\n00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:19.388\nrenegotiate all of your\ncontracts with your suppliers,\n\n142\n00:08:19.388 --> 00:08:23.436\nespecially if you're not too\nsure why you're doing it either.\n\n143\n00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:26.774\nI just want to do this because,\nwhat, I'm implementing CSI?\n\n144\n00:08:26.774 --> 00:08:28.820\nIs that really a good enough reason?\n\n145\n00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.670\nNo.\n\n146\n00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.100\nThink about the existing\nsuppliers that you have, and\n\n147\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.300\nthink about how you're\nmanaging those contracts.\n\n148\n00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.160\nAnd simple improvements could be in\nthe way that we manage those contracts.\n\n149\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.810\nSupplier management should be managing\ncontracts in a way very similar\n\n150\n00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.060\nto service level management, in the way\nservice level management manages the SLAs.\n\n151\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.320\nIf that's not happening, then again, we've\ngot an improvement initiative right there.\n\n152\n00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:04.030\nBut, the other side of things is the fact\nthat we could improve absolutely anything,\n\n153\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.210\nand we could improve our technology.\n\n154\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.120\nAnd if we want to improve our technology,\n\n155\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.230\nthen that is going to have an impact\non our existing supplier contracts.\n\n156\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:17.500\nSo we have to ensure that our suppliers\nare completely on board with us and\n\n157\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.270\nare completely bought in also to CSI.\n\n158\n00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.750\nSo what is it that we need to achieve?\n\n159\n00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.990\nWell, take a look at our\ncritical success factors here.\n\n160\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:32.828\nThis is what we have to achieve\nin order to have an efficient and\n\n161\n00:09:32.828 --> 00:09:36.212\nan effective CSI lifecycle phase.\n\n162\n00:09:36.212 --> 00:09:39.481\nWe need to have somebody to\ntake accountability for CSI.\n\n163\n00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:42.890\nSo there has to be,\nwe call it a CSI manager.\n\n164\n00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.900\nBut as I've explained\nin a previous session,\n\n165\n00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:50.120\nit could be the CSI owner,\nsomebody to take accountability for CSI.\n\n166\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.010\nAnd, as we've said already,\n\n167\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.410\nwe have to have the visible\nongoing management commitment.\n\n168\n00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.860\nWe have to have a CSI register.\n\n169\n00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.920\nWe have to have somewhere, where we\nstore improvement initiatives, and\n\n170\n00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.190\nthat allows us to prioritize\nthose improvement initiatives and\n\n171\n00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.590\nalso to track them throughout\ntheir lifecycle, as well.\n\n172\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.410\nNow, I mentioned just a little\nwhile ago about funding and\n\n173\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.280\nabout the fact that if we don't\nhave management committment,\n\n174\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.090\nthen that makes obtaining funding very,\nvery difficult.\n\n175\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.129\nWell, we've still got to make sure\nwe've got the funding right the way\n\n176\n00:10:26.129 --> 00:10:27.510\nthroughout CSI.\n\n177\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.630\nWhich means throughout the rest\nof our service management\n\n178\n00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.910\nwe need to ensure we've got funding for\nmaking improvements.\n\n179\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.870\nAnd if we've got senior management buy\nin then that will facilitate that.\n\n180\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.985\nBut without the senior management buy in,\nthen funding is going to be a challenge.\n\n181\n00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:48.383\nNow I mentioned some adoption of\nthe service life cycle approach there, and\n\n182\n00:10:48.383 --> 00:10:50.728\nthey say that that's critical for CSI.\n\n183\n00:10:50.728 --> 00:10:55.340\nIf we don't have ITIL,\nif we don't have a framework.\n\n184\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:00.680\nIf we don't have a defined and formal\nservice management framework in place\n\n185\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.520\nwithin our organization then just\nimplementing this is an improvement.\n\n186\n00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.570\nEverything that we do is an improvement.\n\n187\n00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.350\nYou can't start off trying\nto implement everything.\n\n188\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.840\nSo again,\nimplementation of service management\n\n189\n00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.740\nis going to be an improvement\nthat we have to prioritize and\n\n190\n00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.870\nthat we have to look at from that\nprevious episode, where do we start?\n\n191\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.530\nYou can't do everything.\n\n192\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.400\nSo think about your pain points.\n\n193\n00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.690\nThink about what processes are most\nimportant to you and what processes\n\n194\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:38.060\nare going to deliver the right benefits\nfor you and for your organization.\n\n195\n00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.960\nAnd just remember,\nwe don't wanna reinvent the wheel.\n\n196\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.810\nThat's not efficient.\n\n197\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.080\nHowever, you don't go out and\nbuy a tool, and\n\n198\n00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.230\nthen adapt your processes to fit the tool.\n\n199\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.916\nYou define your processes first and\nthen you go out and\n\n200\n00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:59.528\nsource the tool that will\nfacilitate your processes.\n\n201\n00:11:59.528 --> 00:12:03.712\nSo for those organizations that\nare thinking about implementing service\n\n202\n00:12:03.712 --> 00:12:07.625\nmanagement, then, although we\ndon't wanna reinvent the wheel and\n\n203\n00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:10.475\nwe're not telling you to go out and\nbuy a new tool.\n\n204\n00:12:10.475 --> 00:12:15.265\nJust remember that the tool that you have,\nwhatever that tool may be,\n\n205\n00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:19.502\nhas to facilitate the processes\nthat you are going to define.\n\n206\n00:12:19.502 --> 00:12:23.254\nso if you're thinking about buying a new\ntool then please define your processes\n\n207\n00:12:23.254 --> 00:12:26.852\nfirst, otherwise you won't know what\nyou're going to get from your tool.\n\n208\n00:12:26.852 --> 00:12:30.520\nMany times I've gone into an organization\nwhere they've decided they want to\n\n209\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.078\nimplement service management,\n\n210\n00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:35.746\nor they want to improve the way that they\ndeliver services to the business, and\n\n211\n00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:39.570\nthey thought that the first thing\nthey should do is select a tool.\n\n212\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.790\nAnd now they're trying to\nfit processes to the tool.\n\n213\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.180\nYour processes have to deliver\nvalue to your business.\n\n214\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.530\nAnd the only people that know what\nyour business is capable of and\n\n215\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.430\nwhat your business wants\nto achieve is you.\n\n216\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.190\nIt's not me, it's you.\n\n217\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.600\nAnd it's not the supplier\nof the tool either.\n\n218\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.930\nSo you have to bring in the tool that's\ngonna facilitate your requirements,\n\n219\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.950\nwhich means you've gotta work\nout your requirements first.\n\n220\n00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.000\nOkay, a tool provider is not\ngoing to do that for you.\n\n221\n00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.560\nYou have to work that out first.\n\n222\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.010\nAnd that's really, really important.\n\n223\n00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.030\nSo what else do we have to achieve?\n\n224\n00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.653\nWell, think about\nresource allocation then.\n\n225\n00:13:16.653 --> 00:13:21.182\nWe've talked about technology and we've\ntalked about bringing in processes and\n\n226\n00:13:21.182 --> 00:13:24.732\nadapting processes first and\nthen bringing in the technology.\n\n227\n00:13:24.732 --> 00:13:27.070\nWell, you've also gotta\nhave the people as well.\n\n228\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:31.910\nThe people who are not only going to be\ndedicated to performance CSI activities,\n\n229\n00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.720\nand that's in every single team and that's\nin every single process and that's for\n\n230\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.580\nevery single service as well.\n\n231\n00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.600\nBut you have to have ongoing\ncommitment from people.\n\n232\n00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.130\nCSI's not just a one off activity.\n\n233\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.698\nIt has to be ongoing commitment.\n\n234\n00:13:48.698 --> 00:13:50.501\nSo what could cause us to fail.\n\n235\n00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:54.190\nWell, look at these risks.\n\n236\n00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.820\nI've already told you, when we implement\nservice management, when we first bring in\n\n237\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.710\nservice management, you cannot bring\neverything in all at the same time.\n\n238\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.892\nIt can't be done.\n\n239\n00:14:03.892 --> 00:14:07.890\nYou have got to think about how you're\ngoing to implement service management.\n\n240\n00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.360\nAnd that's the same for any project.\n\n241\n00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:16.580\nKeep it simple, we want iterative,\nvisible improvements.\n\n242\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:22.160\nThat means improvements that\nbuild on the previous one but\n\n243\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.120\nthat are visible, so we can actually\nsee the benefits from each improvement.\n\n244\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.940\nSo maybe we start off by understanding\nwhat services we provide.\n\n245\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.900\nSo perhaps we start off\nwith our service catalog.\n\n246\n00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.160\nUnderstanding what services we provide.\n\n247\n00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.360\nAnd then we look at incident\nmanagement and say okay,\n\n248\n00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.850\nnow we know what services we've got.\n\n249\n00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.750\nWe've got to support these services.\n\n250\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.120\nSo let's implement incident management.\n\n251\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.460\nAnd then from incident management,\nwe may go to problem management.\n\n252\n00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.510\nAnd then from problem\nto change management.\n\n253\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.690\nAnd now we've got change management and\nwe've got the catalog in place.\n\n254\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.330\nThen perhaps now we want to look at\nservice asset and configuration management\n\n255\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.010\nbecause they're going to\nfacilitate all of those processes.\n\n256\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.680\nThere's no right or wrong way to do this.\n\n257\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.300\nYou will know what your\norganization needs.\n\n258\n00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.990\nBut you have to work out\nwhat the vision is first.\n\n259\n00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.690\nRemember that CSI approach,\nwhat's the vision?\n\n260\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.680\nWell, if the vision is to implement\nservice management, okay, well,\n\n261\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.640\nwhere are we right now?\n\n262\n00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.550\nAnd your catalog is a good place to start.\n\n263\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.300\nBut service asset and configuration\nmanagement is also another good place to\n\n264\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.660\nstart, because that tells\nus where we are right now.\n\n265\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.870\nAnd then we work out exactly\nwhere we want to be,\n\n266\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.225\nexactly what processes we\nwant to implement next.\n\n267\n00:15:38.165 --> 00:15:40.180\nWe have to prioritize them.\n\n268\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.320\nAgain, it's part of working out\nexactly what we want to do next.\n\n269\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:48.000\nAnd with any improvement initiative,\nwell, that's why we have the CSI register.\n\n270\n00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.350\nTo facilitate, not prioritization.\n\n271\n00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.205\nJust remember, CSI is not just\nenough to turn around and say, well,\n\n272\n00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:58.678\nwe're implementing CSI, and\nthen not do anything about it.\n\n273\n00:15:58.678 --> 00:16:00.815\nWe have to have dedicated resources.\n\n274\n00:16:00.815 --> 00:16:03.066\nWe have to have the funding and\nthe technology.\n\n275\n00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:06.880\nAnd we have to have the committment\nto be able to implement CSI.\n\n276\n00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.530\nNow, I've already mentioned the CSI\napproach and, of course, in previous\n\n277\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.580\nepisodes, we talked at length about\nthe seven steps improvement processes.\n\n278\n00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:23.100\nThese are all practices for\nimplementing improvements.\n\n279\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.160\nAnd they're all iterative,\n\n280\n00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.000\nthey all allow us to build on\neach subsequent improvements.\n\n281\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.470\nIf we don't follow a structured method,\nthen we're not efficient.\n\n282\n00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.230\nNow, I'm not gonna say that\nwe can't be effective, but\n\n283\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.720\nwe're certainly not going to be efficient.\n\n284\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.900\nSo we don't then underpin ITIL, which is\nall about delivering our services and\n\n285\n00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.410\naligning ourselves with the business\nin an efficient and an effective way.\n\n286\n00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.690\nWe want to deliver value to the business.\n\n287\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.740\nSo, again, we need to have a formal\nway to deliver improvements.\n\n288\n00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.144\nSo we need to have a commitment\nfrom all of our process managers,\n\n289\n00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:02.611\nwe need to have\nthe commitment from everyone.\n\n290\n00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:06.176\nAnd we need to have the commitment\nfrom the business, too.\n\n291\n00:17:06.176 --> 00:17:10.437\nIf we're making any large\nchanges within our IT service\n\n292\n00:17:10.437 --> 00:17:15.437\nprovider organization,\nthen don't hide it from the business.\n\n293\n00:17:15.437 --> 00:17:17.820\nThey're gonna notice, they're gonna\nnotice that things are changed.\n\n294\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.286\nAnd they're gonna notice whether\nthings have changed for the good or\n\n295\n00:17:20.286 --> 00:17:21.787\nwhether things have changed for the bad.\n\n296\n00:17:21.787 --> 00:17:26.485\nAnd if things have changed for the worse,\nbecause sometimes it takes a little bit of\n\n297\n00:17:26.485 --> 00:17:31.180\ntime to bed in, if things have changed for\nthe worse, and we haven't prepared them\n\n298\n00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.300\nfor it, then all of the sudden they\ndon't perceive value in us anymore.\n\n299\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.762\nSo we've gotta make sure that we\ncommunicate with the business.\n\n300\n00:17:39.762 --> 00:17:43.053\nAnd that goes back to that\ncommunication campaign,\n\n301\n00:17:43.053 --> 00:17:48.640\nthat awareness campaign, and making\nsure that we're able to communicate.\n\n302\n00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.640\nWhich means involving everybody in it.\n\n303\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.550\nThe last bullet point, the last risk,\n\n304\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:59.199\nsomething that could cause us\nto fail with any CSI initiative,\n\n305\n00:17:59.199 --> 00:18:04.220\nis really not testing, we've got to test.\n\n306\n00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:09.600\nNo initiative is going to work straight\nout of the box if we haven't tested\n\n307\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.050\nthat it's going to deliver\nthe intended value.\n\n308\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.950\nSo, all of our initiatives have\nto deliver the intended value, so\n\n309\n00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.550\nwe've gotta test them.\n\n310\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.530\nBecause, I think so,\n\n311\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.910\nis not a good enough measure as to\nwhether we've made an improvement.\n\n312\n00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.990\nSo, again,\nwhen we think about technologies,\n\n313\n00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.330\nwe've got to think about the fact that\nwe've got to test any improvement, but\n\n314\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.870\nwe've also got to measure whether that\nimprovement has succeeded as well.\n\n315\n00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.510\nAnd those technologies,\nthe tools, they will help us.\n\n316\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.500\nSo what we've done, then, is we covered\nvery, very briefly the challenges.\n\n317\n00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.390\nThe critical success factors, things that\nwe have to achieve within CSI and, also,\n\n318\n00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:56.250\nwhat could cause this to fail once\nwe have CSI in place those risks.\n\n319\n00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:02.470\nSo, now what I'd like you to do is, I\nwould like you to go back over your notes.\n\n320\n00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.320\nGo back over the materials\nthat we've covered and\n\n321\n00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:11.290\ntake a review over the past few episodes\nand, as always, I'm going to be here.\n\n322\n00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:16.667\nI'm available on the forum, if you have\nany questions at all to do with CSI.\n\n323\n00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:19.709\nFor our next step, we're going to go\n\n324\n00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:24.431\nthrough the sample exam that\nyou have in your materials.\n\n325\n00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:27.067\nAnd we'll be going through\nthat in a lot more detail and\n\n326\n00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:29.930\nI'm going to be going through\nall of the answers for you.\n\n327\n00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.020\nSo that, again, is your next step.\n\n328\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:36.140\nOnce you've gone over your notes,\nI'd like you to take your sample exam,\n\n329\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:41.400\nand then we will go over that\nin our subsequent sessions.\n\n330\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us to understand more clearly\n\n331\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.570\nabout these different challenges, as\nwell as our critical success factors and\n\n332\n00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.960\nthe risks that we face, when we start to\ntake a look at, of course, using CSI.\n\n333\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.730\nAnd that is also a great place for\nus to sign off for this episode, as well.\n\n334\n00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.390\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n335\n00:20:03.390 -->

PRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:19.510\nYou are watching the ITIL intermediate\nexam review introduction.\n\n7\n00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.890\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n8\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.080\nif you've come this far it means you have\nsuccessfully reviewed all the material,\n\n9\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.950\nyou've taken a look at all those case\nstudies and gotten in the hours that you\n\n10\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.680\nneed to and that means you're now\nready to prepare for the exam as well.\n\n11\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.540\nAnd here to help us of course is gonna\nbe our ITIL wiz kid, it's Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.140\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.030\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,\nRonnie, it's great to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.680\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n15\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.180\nNow again, what I said is true, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.560\nThe very fact is that\nthey've gotten to this point.\n\n17\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.630\nThey now need to really\nfocus in on the exam.\n\n18\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.720\nLearning the material of course is\nforemost and key, but getting ready for\n\n19\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.860\nthe exam is a big part of this as well.\n\n20\n00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.430\nSo, where are we gonna be again?\n\n21\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.864\n&gt;&gt; So, yes you are right we have\ncompleted the course congratulations\n\n22\n00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:10.921\neverybody you've put in the prerequisite\n21 hours worth of contact time,\n\n23\n00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:15.692\nas we say in the co-syllabus,\nwith both me and accredited instructor.\n\n24\n00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:20.528\nAnd also by going through the materials\nthat you've been given and\n\n25\n00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:23.790\nprovided with your course materials.\n\n26\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.910\nSo now it's time for the exam.\n\n27\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.180\nAnd I know, Ronnie, that's a dreaded\nword for some people, right?\n\n28\n00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.581\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But don't worry,\n\n29\n00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:33.669\nI'm here to guide you through it, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:37.829\nI can't promise that I'm gonna give you\na pass on this, but I'll tell you what,\n\n31\n00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.864\nif you listen to everything that I say and\nif you follow all the instructions and\n\n32\n00:01:41.864 --> 00:01:45.473\nmake sure that you read the question,\nthen you should find it really,\n\n33\n00:01:45.473 --> 00:01:47.020\nreally straight forward.\n\n34\n00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.310\nSo please do not worry.\n\n35\n00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.230\nNow is the time actually to relax because\nyou have done all of your learning.\n\n36\n00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.330\nSo the first thing that I want you\nto do is I want you to go away and\n\n37\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.250\nto ensure that you have downloaded\n\n38\n00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.930\nthe sample papers That were given to\nyou as part of the course materials.\n\n39\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.810\nNow, if you didn't receive them as part\nof the course materials, or you feel that\n\n40\n00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.665\nyou might want to check out the Axelos\nwebsite, which obviously Axelos.\n\n41\n00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:20.075\n&gt;&gt; So the people that own ITIL now,\nthen please feel free to go to\n\n42\n00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:24.105\ntheir website at www.axelos.org and\n\n43\n00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:29.035\nif you type in to search the ITIL\nintermediate and you can download\n\n44\n00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:34.060\nthe sample paper from that website\n&gt;&gt; So what we are going to do\n\n45\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.730\nover the next few moments is I am going\nto take you through some exam technique.\n\n46\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.383\nThen I am going to ask you to go away and\nattempt sample paper 1.\n\n47\n00:02:43.383 --> 00:02:47.451\nOnce you have completed sample paper 1,\nthen I am going to go over it with you and\n\n48\n00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:51.216\nI am going to make sure that you have\npicked out all of the salient points and\n\n49\n00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:52.735\nall of the relevant points and\n\n50\n00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:55.880\neverything that you need in order\nto to get the right answer.\n\n51\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.260\nYeah talking about the right answer.\n\n52\n00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.250\nTake a look at this slide.\n\n53\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.780\nThere is no right answer.\n\n54\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.820\nThere is no wrong answer.\n\n55\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.260\nWhat you've got is a best fit answer.\n\n56\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.470\nNow I know that way,\nway back at the introduction to our class.\n\n57\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.980\nI, very very briefly mention\nthe exam at the end of this,okay?\n\n58\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.610\nAnd I said to you that it was\ncomplex multiple choice exam, and\n\n59\n00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.710\nthey looked at, I think the word that we\nuse throughout the very start of the class\n\n60\n00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.260\nwas most correct, and I use the words best\nfit, and that's what I like to use, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.880\nThe best fit answer is 5 points.\n\n62\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.310\nYour second best answer is 3 points and\nyour first.\n\n63\n00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.560\nYour third best answer\nwill give you one point.\n\n64\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.970\nAnd then we got this distractor\nthat I mentioned and\n\n65\n00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.510\nboy is that there to distract.\n\n66\n00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.400\nAnd the distractor will quite\noften use some nice pretty words,\n\n67\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.450\nthe words that you find in\nyour ITIL publications.\n\n68\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.440\nAnd you think that sounds great cuz\nit's mentioned all of the processes and\n\n69\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.640\nit's mentioned all of these functions and\nit's mentioned all of these activities.\n\n70\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.370\nThat's gotta be the right answer right.\n\n71\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.250\nNo because the right answer,\nthe best fit answer,\n\n72\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.120\nis got to be completely relevant to\nthe scenario, completely relevant.\n\n73\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.180\nSo sometimes the best fit\nanswer doesn't actually\n\n74\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.520\nuse any of the actual wording at all.\n\n75\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.710\nSo be careful that distract is called\na distractor for a reason, right?\n\n76\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.087\nSo the exam, let me tell you\na little bit about it then.\n\n77\n00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:30.560\nYou get 90 minutes, that's an hour and\na half you get to complete this exam.\n\n78\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.320\nAnd you will be given 8\nmultiple choice questions.\n\n79\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320\nSo you get two booklets, okay,\nyou get a scenario booklet and\n\n80\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.410\nyou get a question booklet.\n\n81\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.490\nOkay, now, be very, very careful, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.018\nThe scenario booklet,\nas it says there, sets the scene,\n\n83\n00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:54.422\nthe question booklet asks the question,\nokay, fairly straightforward, not really.\n\n84\n00:04:54.422 --> 00:04:58.725\nFirst think that I want you to check,\nwhen you see the question booklet.\n\n85\n00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:01.825\nIt is at the top of every single question.\n\n86\n00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:06.315\nAnd boy, is this simple and don't\nforget this, at the top of every single\n\n87\n00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:11.035\nquestion it says, refer to scenario x.\n\n88\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.590\nSometimes not all the time, not in\nevery paper, and in fact it's a rarity,\n\n89\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.760\nI'll admit, but sometimes,\nyou've got one scenario for two questions.\n\n90\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.670\nIn other words, two questions\nrefer to just that one scenario.\n\n91\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.910\nBest way to ascertain whether that's\nthe case in your particular exam\n\n92\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.370\nis scroll through to the end\nof the scenario booklet.\n\n93\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.200\nLook at the end of the scenario booklet,\nsee how many you've got.\n\n94\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.900\nIf you've only got seven, then that means\nthat somewhere in your question booklet,\n\n95\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.800\nyou've got two questions for one scenario.\n\n96\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.300\nThis is not the norm,\nit's not in every single paper but\n\n97\n00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.660\nit's one definitely\nworth watching out for.\n\n98\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.510\nSo always look at them, right at the very,\n\n99\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.480\nvery top take a look,\nsee what scenario it refers to.\n\n100\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.930\nYou've gotta get a total of 28 points out\n\n101\n00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.240\nof 40 in order to pass the ITIL\nIntermediate, the life cycle phase.\n\n102\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.570\nSo, think about this, okay,\nyou cannot get all 3s.\n\n103\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.020\nAlright that 's not going to work.\n\n104\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.860\nYou have to get some 5 pointers.\n\n105\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.120\nObviously, you know what I would like you\nto do, is to get all 5 pointers okay and\n\n106\n00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.750\n40 out of 40 is not impossible.\n\n107\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.650\nIt really, really is impossible,\nand I have quite a few delegates\n\n108\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.930\nthat do actually achieve that, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.210\nSo, what am I going to ask you to do,\nthen, when it comes to this test, right?\n\n110\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.243\nWell, I've got an acronym for\nyou, and it's not one I guess\n\n111\n00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:51.177\nI'm supposed to give you, but\nI'm gonna give you anyway RTFQ, RTFQ.\n\n112\n00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:53.150\nRonnie do you have any\nidea what that means?\n\n113\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.820\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't.\n\n114\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.390\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n115\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good I'm pleased [LAUGH].\n\n116\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.350\nIt means read the full question.\n\n117\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.890\nRead the full question, really,\nreally, really important.\n\n118\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.360\nThere is not one word in that\nquestion that is not relevant.\n\n119\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.940\nEvery single word is completely relevant.\n\n120\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.640\nIf you try and scheme read, bearing in\nmind that this test is not a race, okay,\n\n121\n00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.740\nyou're not gonna get any points for\nfinishing in 20 minutes, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.600\nYou're not gonna get any prizes for\nthat, and\n\n123\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.560\nnobody's gonna recognize you for being the\nfast person ever to finish an ITIL test.\n\n124\n00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.960\nSo please don't try it, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.880\nIt's not gonna get you anything\nadditional over your score.\n\n126\n00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.420\nRead the four questions,\ntake the time to read the full question.\n\n127\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:50.109\nRead every single word and that applies to\nthe scenario as well, read the scenario.\n\n128\n00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:55.106\nYour looking for key words, but\nyour also looking for small words as well,\n\n129\n00:07:55.106 --> 00:08:00.261\nwords like all and words like might and\ncould and should and must, please,\n\n130\n00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:05.680\nplease, please, pick out those words\nbecause they are incredibly important.\n\n131\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.980\nFirst thing that I want you\nto do is read the question.\n\n132\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.950\nThe question can generally be very,\nvery small and sometimes that question can\n\n133\n00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.920\nsimply turn around and say, so given the\nscenario, what do you think is the best\n\n134\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.840\nanswer to resolve the issues\nmentioned in the scenario?\n\n135\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.170\nWell that question tells\nyou absolutely nothing.\n\n136\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.977\nSo you have to go then back\nto the scenario, okay?\n\n137\n00:08:28.977 --> 00:08:33.289\nAnd the example that you've given\non there is you've been asked by\n\n138\n00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:38.450\nthe CEO to identify the next steps\nto address the identified issues.\n\n139\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.050\nWell, guess what, if you have been\nasked for the next steps, and\n\n140\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.490\nthis is why I say read the full question,\nbecause if you have been asked for\n\n141\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.970\nthe next steps, don't you dare select the\nanswer that goes over everything that you\n\n142\n00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.445\nhave already covered because they\nare asking you for the next step.\n\n143\n00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:56.148\nIt also I mentioned, and\nit has been highlighted there again,\n\n144\n00:08:56.148 --> 00:08:59.570\nabout addressing the issues mentioned\neither in the question or the scenario.\n\n145\n00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.404\nIf your answer does not address the issues\nI relevance, if it's not relevant,\n\n146\n00:09:05.404 --> 00:09:10.191\nthen again, you're not going to be\non to that five point answer so\n\n147\n00:09:10.191 --> 00:09:14.390\nread the full question,\nbe very, very careful, okay?\n\n148\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.650\nIt says that as you read the scenario,\nhighlight, underline, or write down\n\n149\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:24.520\nthe specific issues, but you can only do\nthat if you've got a paper exam in front\n\n150\n00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.320\nof you, you can not do that when you\nare online and doing a virtual test.\n\n151\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.430\nYou will be allowed, in your virtual test,\nto have a piece of blank paper with you.\n\n152\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.210\nWhat I would recommend, and I was just\nthinking if how I had one here, and\n\n153\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.930\nI don't, unfortunately.\n\n154\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:48.020\nWhat I would recommend for you is to\nactually take one piece of blank paper,\n\n155\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.770\nand fold it into quarters.\n\n156\n00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.610\nBy doing that, you've divided up\nthe front page into four sections and\n\n157\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.687\nyou've divided up the back\npage into four sections too.\n\n158\n00:09:57.687 --> 00:10:01.329\nYou'll be allowed to have that piece\nof paper and a pencil with you.\n\n159\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:08.540\nIn every single quarter I would write down\nthe notes for each particular question.\n\n160\n00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.690\nWhat that allows you to do is actually\nkeep your questions separate,\n\n161\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.500\nwhich is a huge start.\n\n162\n00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.572\nIf you just start writing down random\nwords on a piece of paper you won't really\n\n163\n00:10:18.572 --> 00:10:20.311\nknow what question it refers to.\n\n164\n00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:24.730\nAnd if you have to go back to a question\nthen you really be in trouble, okay?\n\n165\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.100\nSo, take that piece of people and\nliterally just fol it into four and\n\n166\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.110\nas you all fold it you've now got\nto divide it four on each side and\n\n167\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.530\nuse one quarter for each question and\n\n168\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.190\nthen right down the specific words\nyou want to highlight, okay.\n\n169\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.280\nSo, the third bullet point up there\ntalks about sticking to facts,\n\n170\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.440\nand what I will say to you is,\ndon't assume, please don't assume.\n\n171\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.040\nStick to what's in front of you,\nread the full question, and\n\n172\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.050\ndon't read in between the lines,\nthere is nothing written there.\n\n173\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.020\nSo don't read in between the lines,\ndon't assume anything,\n\n174\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.570\nif it's not down in black and white,\nthen it simply, doesn't exist.\n\n175\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:11.060\nNow you've completed your class, now's\nthe time when you follow this link, and\n\n176\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.690\nyou download your exam voucher.\n\n177\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.578\nWhat will happen,\nis you'll be given this voucher, and\n\n178\n00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:23.507\nyou will be also given an instruction\nbooklet or an instruction email, rather,\n\n179\n00:11:23.507 --> 00:11:27.492\nand you will be asked to go to\nthe website at peoplecert.org, and\n\n180\n00:11:27.492 --> 00:11:31.790\nyou will be asked to register as\na kind if you haven't already done so.\n\n181\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.973\nYou may already have a candidate login,\nand\n\n182\n00:11:35.973 --> 00:11:43.000\nthen you select the option to register for\nan exam, using a exam voucher.\n\n183\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.930\nLet me repeat that again, okay?\n\n184\n00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:51.735\nYou'll be asked to register for an exam\nusing an examination voucher, okay?\n\n185\n00:11:51.735 --> 00:11:56.578\nAnd then the voucher number that you've\nbeen given in your email from Passion IT\n\n186\n00:11:56.578 --> 00:12:00.020\nis the voucher number that you will use.\n\n187\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.290\nOnce you've input that, it's going to\nask you for an appropriate date and\n\n188\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.480\ntime to set your test.\n\n189\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.060\nYou can do whatever time you like, so\n\n190\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.540\npick something that's appropriate for\nyou, okay?\n\n191\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.000\nSomething that you can work with.\n\n192\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.530\nThere are a few things that I want to\ntell you about this online exam as well.\n\n193\n00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.780\nAnd the first thing is,\nplease make sure you can't be interrupted.\n\n194\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.570\nYou need to be in a room\nwhere it's only you and\n\n195\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.680\npreferably where the door is closed.\n\n196\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.790\nYou will need to be using a laptop or\na tablet with a camera.\n\n197\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.450\nIf your laptop or your tablet or\n\n198\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:42.400\nyour desktop does not have a camera then\nyou won't be able to sit your test because\n\n199\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.210\nyou will be watched by a proctor\nthroughout your entire test.\n\n200\n00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.820\nYou can't use more than one screen.\n\n201\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.260\nYou can only use one screen.\n\n202\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:56.297\nAnd you cannot at any point in time have\nany other devices on your desk either,\n\n203\n00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:59.722\nso nothing that can connect\nto the Internet, okay.\n\n204\n00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:04.938\nYou will be asked when you\nregister of your test for\n\n205\n00:13:04.938 --> 00:13:11.430\nabout an hour before your test is due to\ndownload some exam guard software, okay?\n\n206\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.100\nAnd what that does is that allows\nthe proctor to remotely watch what\n\n207\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.600\nyou are doing on your laptop or\non your PC or on your device and\n\n208\n00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.319\nthen make sure that you're not on\nthe internet Googling the answer.\n\n209\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.320\nSo, we started our exam,\nwe've downloaded all the software.\n\n210\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.250\nAnd by the way, when I mentioned that,\nif you're using a work PC you better make\n\n211\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.770\nsure you have the permissions in order\nto be able to download that software.\n\n212\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.123\nIf the software's not on your PC,\nthen you won't be able to sit the test.\n\n213\n00:13:38.123 --> 00:13:44.010\nOkay, so then the proctor will come online\nand they will ask you if you're all ready.\n\n214\n00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.020\nAnd they'll tell you that you can\nhave a piece of paper and a pen.\n\n215\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.960\nAnd then they will ask\nto see around your room.\n\n216\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.419\nSo you must be in a position where you\ncan physically pick up your laptop and\n\n217\n00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:59.309\nturn it around so\nthat the proctor can view the room.\n\n218\n00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:02.980\nThat's to make sure that you don't\nhave any ITIL books with you.\n\n219\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.870\nThat you don't have anybody,\nlike me, hiding in the corner or\n\n220\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.230\nhiding under your desk helping you out.\n\n221\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.393\nAnd it's also to make sure that\nyou are completely alone and\n\n222\n00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:16.150\ncan't be interrupted during\nthat particular test.\n\n223\n00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:22.160\nAt that point in time, the examiner\nwill ask you to start your test.\n\n224\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.940\nYou'll get 90 minutes.\n\n225\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.470\nAnd to be perfectly honest 90 minutes or\nan hour and a half is pretty comfortable.\n\n226\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.890\nAt the end of your test,\none thing I will tell you,\n\n227\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.160\nplease don't change your answers.\n\n228\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.780\nGo with your gut instinct\nit's generally right.\n\n229\n00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.160\nAnd to be perfectly honest,\nin about 75% of cases,\n\n230\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.900\nthe person who changes their answer\nchanges it to the wrong one.\n\n231\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.390\nYou wanna weigh in for\nabout ten minutes per question\n\n232\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.670\nthe average is 11 minutes per question,\nbut I aim for ten.\n\n233\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.160\nAnd then you'll feel completely\ncomfortable with the time and\n\n234\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.460\nat the end of your test,\nyou will be asked to submit.\n\n235\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.890\nAnd when you've finished\nthen you click submit.\n\n236\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.790\nAt that point in time,\nyour screen will disappear.\n\n237\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.650\nYou will be given an intermediate,\nI don't like to use that word, actually,\n\n238\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.510\nwhen we're talking about\nitem intermediates.\n\n239\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.940\nYou'll be getting an interim result,\nthere and then.\n\n240\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.910\nAnd that interim result will tell you very\nsimply whether you've passed or failed.\n\n241\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.780\nYou're not gonna be able to get anything\nmore than that out of it, okay?\n\n242\n00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.260\nIt's just a pass or\nfail because it has to be independently\n\n243\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.420\naudited before they can release\nthe result to you, okay?\n\n244\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.600\nSo you'll get your interim\nresult immediately, and\n\n245\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.300\nthen you'll get your result with\nyour score within a week, okay?\n\n246\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.450\nI want to just draw attention to\nthat bottom bullet point there\n\n247\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.620\njust before we move on.\n\n248\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.360\nIf you're struggling with the question\nmove on come back to it and\n\n249\n00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.410\njust remember that if you\ndon't answer a question\n\n250\n00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.110\nbecause you think it's too difficult\nthen you gonna get zero points.\n\n251\n00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.440\nYou've got a 25% chance of\ngetting a 5 pointer and\n\n252\n00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.971\nyou've got a 50 percent chance\nof either getting 5 or 3.\n\n253\n00:15:59.971 --> 00:16:01.960\nSo please answer it, okay.\n\n254\n00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.860\nDon't just leave it blank,\nalways answer a question.\n\n255\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:11.370\nRight, I think I've probably given\nyou enough exam tips for now.\n\n256\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:16.040\nNow it's your turn, what I want you\nto do now is I want you to go and\n\n257\n00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.320\nI want you to download sample paper one.\n\n258\n00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.080\nAnd then I want you to do sample paper\none, including the scenario booklet and\n\n259\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.620\nthe question booklet.\n\n260\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.515\nI want you to do that now and\nthen we're gonna come back and\n\n261\n00:16:29.515 --> 00:16:32.852\nwe're gonna go through\nthat question booklet.\n\n262\n00:16:32.852 --> 00:16:35.417\nNow you'll notice that with\nthis particular booklet,\n\n263\n00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:38.650\nwith sample paper one you've got\nanswers and you've got rationale.\n\n264\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.250\nIn other words, that's the reason why,\nthat's the five pointer,\n\n265\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:48.020\nthe reason why this one is the three\npointer but for the moment\n\n266\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.660\nwhat I want us to do is to come is I want\nus to come back when you finish that exam.\n\n267\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.660\nI want us to come back and\nI want us to go through that test, okay?\n\n268\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.790\nAnd then you see how you did.\n\n269\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.560\nAnd don't forget we've got\na forum available to us and\n\n270\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.180\nnow more than anything else when you\nreally wanna be using that forum.\n\n271\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.998\nJust to answer questions,\netcetera as we've gone through that test.\n\n272\n00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:15.958\nSo, good luck,\nhave fun with your sample paper.\n\n273\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:20.299\nRemember, read the full question,\nread the full scenario,\n\n274\n00:17:20.299 --> 00:17:23.553\nevery word counts,\ncheck for relevance, and\n\n275\n00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:28.574\ndon't make assumptions, and\nI'll see you when you finish your test.\n\n276\n00:17:28.574 --> 00:17:29.480\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo.\n\n277\n00:17:29.480 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.925\n[SOUND] Hi, so\nby now you have finished your\n\n2\n00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:09.412\nsample paper, the sample paper one.\n\n3\n00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:13.796\nAnd now we are going to spend the next\ncouple of sessions just going over\n\n4\n00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:16.220\nthe questions from sample paper one.\n\n5\n00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.130\nAnd going over any problems that\nyou might have experienced,\n\n6\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.390\njust looking for some pointers here,\njust to help you in your real test, okay?\n\n7\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.820\nSo, let's launch straight away\nthen into question number 1.\n\n8\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.210\nOkay, and question number one\nrelates to a SWOT analysis.\n\n9\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.380\nAnd the question that it asks you is,\nwhich of the following statements about\n\n10\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.690\nthis SWOT analysis, that's your strengths,\nweaknesses, opportunities and threats.\n\n11\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.050\nWhich one of these answers,\n\n12\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.020\nbest reveals it's usefulness in\nidentifying the current gaps, okay?\n\n13\n00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.520\nSo what we gotta identify here then in\nour scenario, is the business strategy.\n\n14\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.190\nWe're looking for\nany specific deficiencies here, and\n\n15\n00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.430\nwe're also looking for\nour current capabilities.\n\n16\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.270\nNow, things that I want to pull out of\nthis scenario here then, right now.\n\n17\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.340\nHere's the fact that we've got\na medium sized company here,\n\n18\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.730\nthat got one manufacturing plant\nthey employed 200 people, okay?\n\n19\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.686\nAnd they've experienced difficulty,\nin keeping production in line with demand.\n\n20\n00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:21.010\nOkay, so\nwe've got some demand issues here.\n\n21\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.810\nWe've got problems with demand management,\nperhaps business relationship management.\n\n22\n00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.640\nWe've got issues there\nwithin the strategy itself.\n\n23\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.300\nSo they want to expand both locally and\nabroad.\n\n24\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.800\nAnd the business,\nbearing in mind we're in CSI,\n\n25\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.930\nwe have to align ourselves\nwith the business strategy.\n\n26\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.020\nThey want to streamline\nbusiness operations.\n\n27\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.340\nThey want to concentrate\non increasing market share,\n\n28\n00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.960\nand they want to improve\nproduction capacity and\n\n29\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.790\ncapabilities, by moving to the new\nsites in different territories.\n\n30\n00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.550\nThe CIO is now considering\nthe department's strategic response.\n\n31\n00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.960\nAnd they want to increase awareness\nin that acceptance of CSI.\n\n32\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.510\nYou've recently taken\nover as the CSI manager.\n\n33\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.640\nThere's a bit of a clue there.\n\n34\n00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.970\nI'll put emphasis on that.\n\n35\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.690\nYou've taken over as the CSI manager.\n\n36\n00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.210\nSo whilst I'll say things like, don't make\nany assumptions, if you've taken over,\n\n37\n00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.990\nthere was either a previous CSI manager\nthere, or CSI was already in place.\n\n38\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.070\nThere is an implication there that,\nthere's been some form of CSI, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.160\nYou've recently taken over, but then\nyou've been given the results of a SWOT\n\n40\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.520\nanalysis, that was conducted by IT staff,\ndoesn't say whether it was anything to do\n\n41\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.930\nwith CSI, a few months before\nthe strategies were agreed and published.\n\n42\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.730\nTherefore before your appointment.\n\n43\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.230\nThe fact that it was before your\nappointment, is quite an important note\n\n44\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.890\nto make, but certainly the fact that it\nwas before the strategies were decided and\n\n45\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.770\npublished, well that's\nincredibly important.\n\n46\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.460\nBecause if you remember, we go back to the\nsession where we looked at SWOT analysis,\n\n47\n00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.320\nand one of the things that I said is,\n\n48\n00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.660\nthat we have to have a clear direction for\na SWOT.\n\n49\n00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.020\nIn other words it's no good if we're\ndoing a SWOT analysis on whether\n\n50\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.980\nI am able to deliver a training class.\n\n51\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.130\nWell, the fact that I have a strength in\nbeing able to make my own furniture for\n\n52\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.852\nmy deck at home, has absolutely no bearing\non my ability to deliver a training class.\n\n53\n00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:32.388\nSo therefore our strengths and weaknesses,\nand our opportunities and our threats,\n\n54\n00:03:32.388 --> 00:03:34.280\nthese are external factors.\n\n55\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.870\nWell they have to have a bearing on\nwhat it is we're trying to achieve.\n\n56\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.480\nAnd what we're trying to achieve,\n\n57\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.520\nis alignment to the strategies\nin the organization.\n\n58\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.800\nWell if the strategies have\nonly just been announced,\n\n59\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.720\nthen obviously the SWOT is not going\nto be aligned to those strategies.\n\n60\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.740\nKinda makes sense really doesn't it?\n\n61\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.150\nSo let's take a look at the SWOT.\n\n62\n00:03:55.982 --> 00:03:59.850\nSo, our strengths are that we demonstrate\ncommitment to CSI manager and\n\n63\n00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.000\nthat we've got the right attitude.\n\n64\n00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.712\nAnd that we've got processes\nbased at maturity level 3,\n\n65\n00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:08.836\nlevel 3 as in CMMI scale.\n\n66\n00:04:08.836 --> 00:04:12.240\nOkay, that's great,\nwhat about weaknesses then?\n\n67\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.030\nWe're reactive.\n\n68\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.110\nWe've got stagnant processes, we've got\na lack of monitoring and reporting tools.\n\n69\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.210\nMonitoring and reporting about what?\n\n70\n00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.180\nThat's my question, okay?\n\n71\n00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.720\nAnd then we've got processes\nthat are poorly integrated, but\n\n72\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.839\nwhat is the aim of those processes?\n\n73\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.160\nNow opportunities, don't forget,\nopportunities are external.\n\n74\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.990\nSo external to\nthe IT Service Provider Organization.\n\n75\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.050\nSo investing in an integrated service\nmanagement tool to remove bottlenecks,\n\n76\n00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.560\nis that a an opportunity?\n\n77\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.245\nIs that external to the service\nprovider organization?\n\n78\n00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:52.740\nImplementing a new reporting mechanism and\ntools for knowledge management.\n\n79\n00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.470\nAgain, is that external\nto the organization?\n\n80\n00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.580\nInstituting knowledge transfer and\n\n81\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.469\ncoaching, is that external\nto the organization?\n\n82\n00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.100\nNo, these look more like strategies to me.\n\n83\n00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.720\nAnd then let's take a look\nat the threats then.\n\n84\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.880\nCompetition is already in existence.\n\n85\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.370\nOkay, competition for what?\n\n86\n00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.915\nRegulatory requirements will\nrequire additional effort, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:20.180\nDid it say anything about\nregulatory requirements in there?\n\n88\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.410\nIt said that we want to\nstreamline business operations.\n\n89\n00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.250\nWe want to increase market share, and\n\n90\n00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.650\nwe want to improve production capacity and\ncapabilities, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.924\nWere there any regulator\nrequirements in there?\n\n92\n00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.530\nLet's go back to the threats then.\n\n93\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.950\nNew technology resulting from business\nexpansion, will need to be supported.\n\n94\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.690\nDo we need new technology?\n\n95\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.880\nWell, let's go back to the scenario again,\nokay.\n\n96\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.110\nWe want to eliminate manufacturing\nthe products that aren't selling well, but\n\n97\n00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.880\nthat doesn't mean new technology,\nwe want to reduce bottlenecks.\n\n98\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.650\nWe want to move to new production\nsites in different territories.\n\n99\n00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.263\nDoes that mean new technology?\n\n100\n00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:02.380\nWell it means new sites.\n\n101\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.990\nLack of trained staff creates bottlenecks,\nthat's kind of an assumption there.\n\n102\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.090\nAnd lack of use of formal\nknowledge management.\n\n103\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.300\nBut didn't it say in our opportunities,\n\n104\n00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.040\nthat we had to institute\nknowledge transfer?\n\n105\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.680\nAnd it also said implement knowledge\nmanagement tools in the opportunities?\n\n106\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.300\nso we don't even know whether there's\nformal knowledge management there, so\n\n107\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.820\nit might not be lack of use.\n\n108\n00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.840\nLet's take a look at the answers then.\n\n109\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.292\nYou see, what I'm looking at here is,\nI'm looking at the fact that this SWOT was\n\n110\n00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:41.850\ndone, way before\nthe strategies were announced.\n\n111\n00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.660\nAnd I'm also looking at the fact, that our\nopportunities aren't really opportunities.\n\n112\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.450\nAnd that brings me straightaway to five,\nwhich is our five pointer.\n\n113\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.300\nIt doesn't reveal useful information,\n\n114\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.520\nbecause it was conducted before the\ndesired end state was defined and agreed.\n\n115\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.575\nNow, opportunites are being\nconfused with strategies, yeah,\n\n116\n00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:04.018\nwe've already mention that, and\nthe SWOT analysis should be repeated,\n\n117\n00:07:04.018 --> 00:07:07.650\nonce the objectives have been aligned\nwith a new business strategy.\n\n118\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.930\nYes, most definitely.\n\n119\n00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.460\nWe have to create our own vision and\nour own strategies,\n\n120\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.410\nbased on the business strategies, and\n\n121\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:23.770\nthen we conduct our SWOT analysis,\nbased on that vision and those objectives.\n\n122\n00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.140\nLet's take a look at\nthe three pointer then, and\n\n123\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.960\nwhat is wrong with our three pointer?\n\n124\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.370\nWell it says here the SWOT analysis\nis not useful in its current state,\n\n125\n00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.600\nbecause it doesn't describe an end state.\n\n126\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.220\nA SWOT analysis never\ndescribes an end state.\n\n127\n00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.240\nSo you're right that it's not helpful,\nbut it's because it's out of date.\n\n128\n00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.140\nIt's not because it doesn't\ndescribe an end date.\n\n129\n00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.850\nThere are no actions defined\nin the SWOT analysis.\n\n130\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.091\nWell, there are under the opportunities,\nbut they're strategies,\n\n131\n00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:54.726\nnot necessarily actions.\n\n132\n00:07:54.726 --> 00:07:57.350\nBut a SWOT doesn't really include actions.\n\n133\n00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.637\nIt should include opportunities.\n\n134\n00:07:59.637 --> 00:08:04.371\nAnd the SWOT analysis should be repeated\nin two month's time once the business\n\n135\n00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:07.220\nstrategies have been accepted.\n\n136\n00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:13.350\nRight, okay, I quite like this particular\nstatement, yes we should repeat the SWOT.\n\n137\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.490\nMost definitely.\n\n138\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.841\nBut once the business\nstrategies have been accepted.\n\n139\n00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:19.160\nIf they've been communicated already,\n\n140\n00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.590\nthen they must have been accepted\nbefore they were communicated.\n\n141\n00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:28.762\nSo we have to define our own strategies\nbased on those business strategies.\n\n142\n00:08:28.762 --> 00:08:31.890\nBut nevertheless,\nthat little statement in there says\n\n143\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.530\nonce the business strategies have\nbeen accepted, there's nothing\n\n144\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.110\nin that scenario that says that the\nbusiness strategies haven't been accepted.\n\n145\n00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.770\nIt clearly states that these\nare the business strategies.\n\n146\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.410\nSo let's take a look then at our one\npointer and our one pointer is D.\n\n147\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.100\nAnd it says there the SWOT analysis\nindicates that with significant investment\n\n148\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.360\nin a toolset,\nit can address the weaknesses.\n\n149\n00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.160\nOkay, does it say that?\n\n150\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.157\nIt says that they want to invest in\na toolset and investing in a toolset,\n\n151\n00:09:06.157 --> 00:09:10.990\nif it is configured correctly will\naddress some of the weaknesses but\n\n152\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:15.268\nthat was actually a strategy and\nnot an opportunity anyway.\n\n153\n00:09:15.268 --> 00:09:19.145\nThe coaching and training of IT staff\nwill go a long way towards business in IT\n\n154\n00:09:19.145 --> 00:09:20.790\nalignment, it probably will.\n\n155\n00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.584\nBut I'm really not too sure what relevance\nthat has got on the strengths and\n\n156\n00:09:25.584 --> 00:09:28.191\nthe weaknesses and\nthe opportunities and the threats.\n\n157\n00:09:28.191 --> 00:09:32.620\nI mean it may well go a long\nway towards IT alignment but\n\n158\n00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.148\nonly if we get the coaching and\nthe training right, and\n\n159\n00:09:37.148 --> 00:09:40.593\nwe bring in those tools\nto be trained on and\n\n160\n00:09:40.593 --> 00:09:44.740\nalso we got to train on\nthe ESI activities as well.\n\n161\n00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.488\nSo it's kind of a blanket statement\nthat doesn't really say a lot, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:50.488 --> 00:09:52.523\nSo let's take a look at\nour destructor then and\n\n163\n00:09:52.523 --> 00:09:54.830\nremember these destructors\nare there to destruct.\n\n164\n00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.356\nSo A says that the SWOT analysis\nindicates that it's committed to better\n\n165\n00:09:59.356 --> 00:10:03.587\nintegration with a business by\nconsidering the implementation and\n\n166\n00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:07.838\nknowledge management, and\nbetter monitoring and support tools.\n\n167\n00:10:07.838 --> 00:10:12.461\nDoes the implementation of knowledge\nmanagement means that we're going to be\n\n168\n00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:14.570\nbetter aligned with the business?\n\n169\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.890\nPerhaps it's going to make us more\nefficient and more effective and\n\n170\n00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.990\nthere's an assumption there that\nit's integrated correctly and\n\n171\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.580\nif it's configured correctly then it will.\n\n172\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.847\nAnd better monitoring and reporting polls,\n\n173\n00:10:27.847 --> 00:10:30.740\nwill that make us more\naligned with the business?\n\n174\n00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.820\nMore aligned with the business means\nunderstanding what the business wants.\n\n175\n00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.564\nWhat we're looking at there is,\n\n176\n00:10:35.564 --> 00:10:39.054\nwe're concentrating on all of\nthe sort of the background tools and\n\n177\n00:10:39.054 --> 00:10:42.814\ntechnology here and we're not\nconsidering the business strategies.\n\n178\n00:10:42.814 --> 00:10:46.062\nI don't see any mention of\nthe specific business strategies but\n\n179\n00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:50.107\nthen of course the SWOT was conducted\nbefore the business strategies came out.\n\n180\n00:10:50.107 --> 00:10:53.010\nAnd then of course it goes\non to say the training and\n\n181\n00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.240\ncoaching the stuff will go a long way\ntowards business and IT alignment.\n\n182\n00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:04.510\nAnd again exactly the same as without one\npointer, that's a huge assumption there.\n\n183\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.600\nAnd that doesn't actually\nsuggest anything,\n\n184\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.620\nthat is going to help us\nachieve the aim of or\n\n185\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.570\nthe strategies that are listed within\nthe scenario for the organization.\n\n186\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.160\nThat is just a huge assumption.\n\n187\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.670\nAnd as I've said, we don't assume.\n\n188\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.900\nWe can't assume anything.\n\n189\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.180\nIf it's not written down clearly in black\nand white, then it really isn't there.\n\n190\n00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.587\nBut the most relevant point\nfrom all of this is the fact\n\n191\n00:11:31.587 --> 00:11:36.449\nthat the SWOT analysis was conducted\nbefore we had our strategies defined.\n\n192\n00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:37.873\nAnd so therefore,\n\n193\n00:11:37.873 --> 00:11:44.000\nwe have to consider the fact that we\ndidn't have the correct end state in mind.\n\n194\n00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000\nWe may have had a end state in mind,\nbut not the correct end state.\n\n195\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.699\nSo let's take a look then at question 2.\n\n196\n00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:56.913\nNow then, the first thing that I want to\ndraw your attention to in question 2,\n\n197\n00:11:56.913 --> 00:12:01.100\nand it's not highlighted very\nwell on this particular slide,\n\n198\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.369\nis the fact that the top ofquestion\n2 says refer to scenario 1.\n\n199\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.687\nWho got that?\n\n200\n00:12:07.687 --> 00:12:12.280\n[LAUGH] And that is a killer,\nand that will, yeah,\n\n201\n00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.370\nthat will head you down the wrong path,\nstraight away, if you don't notice that.\n\n202\n00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.488\nWe have two questions for one scenario.\n\n203\n00:12:20.488 --> 00:12:23.339\nThat means that we're using\nthat one scenario twice.\n\n204\n00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:25.370\nSo be very, very careful.\n\n205\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:30.610\nIt's exactly the same case study and\nit's exactly the same SWOT analysis.\n\n206\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.780\nThe only thing that's\ndifferent is the question.\n\n207\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.170\nAnd the question asks you about,\n\n208\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.790\nwhich of the following sets of CSS\nbest demonstrate that the companies\n\n209\n00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:46.240\nmanagement is committed to CSI and\nwill overcome the weaknesses identified?\n\n210\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.870\nSo, CSF of course is\na critical success factor.\n\n211\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.220\nSomething that we have to achieve.\n\n212\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.850\nSo what do we know about CSI then?\n\n213\n00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.410\nOr what do we know about our\ncritical success factors?\n\n214\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.722\nWell we know that we have to\nhave ongoing visible management\n\n215\n00:13:03.722 --> 00:13:06.570\ncommitment in all of CSI.\n\n216\n00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.940\nWhich is why D is our five pointer.\n\n217\n00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.660\nWe have to ensure that we've got\nsufficient funding for CSI activities.\n\n218\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.360\nButt it's ongoing funding, we know that.\n\n219\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.480\nAnd then adopting the lifecycle\napproach throughout IT.\n\n220\n00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.860\nThat's about all of our relationships\nbetween all of our processes.\n\n221\n00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.200\nAnd understanding that\nour services have a life.\n\n222\n00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.160\nAnd that will help us to achieve\n\n223\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.180\nthe strategies that\nare highlighted in the scenarios.\n\n224\n00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.300\nStrategies such as reducing bottlenecks.\n\n225\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.770\nWell we do that with the integration of\nour processors in those relationships,\n\n226\n00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.640\nconcentrating on market share by\neliminating products that aren't\n\n227\n00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.519\nselling well.\n\n228\n00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:52.645\nThat's part of service portfolio\nmanagement understanding what\n\n229\n00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:58.144\nvalue we deliver to our business to\nsupport that particular strategy.\n\n230\n00:13:58.144 --> 00:14:00.977\nAnd then improving production and\n\n231\n00:14:00.977 --> 00:14:07.330\ncapacity capabilities by moving to\nnew sites in different territories.\n\n232\n00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.750\nAgain we're looking at portfolio\nmanagement, we're looking at bringing in\n\n233\n00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.740\npotentially new services to align\nourselves with the business need.\n\n234\n00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.640\nSo D, yeah that's our five pointer there.\n\n235\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.144\nAnd let's take a look then\nat our three pointer.\n\n236\n00:14:21.144 --> 00:14:26.250\nOur three pointer is A and\nA is our second best answer.\n\n237\n00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.226\nAppointing a CSI manager is not wrong,\nbut I don't see anything\n\n238\n00:14:32.226 --> 00:14:37.371\nthere about management commitment\nthat is ongoing throughout CSI.\n\n239\n00:14:37.371 --> 00:14:41.280\nWhat is actually mentioned is\nmanagement participation in the launch.\n\n240\n00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.500\nBut I have mentioned this, we've gone\nthrough all of our sessions within CSI\n\n241\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.920\nthat management commitment is\nnot just there at the beginning.\n\n242\n00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.230\nManagement committment\nhas to be visible and\n\n243\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.130\nit has to be ongoing,\nit's not just there at the beginning.\n\n244\n00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:00.670\nNow, the second bullet point in A about\na life cycle approach throughout IT.\n\n245\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.610\nYes, we like that one, and we know that,\nthat is the right way to go.\n\n246\n00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.560\nBut B is our three pointer simply because\nwe've got management committment only\n\n247\n00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.580\nin the launch, and\nwe have a CSI manager that's dedicated,\n\n248\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.600\nbut what about having everybody\nelse that's dedicated?\n\n249\n00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.560\nWe want ongoing commitment from everybody,\nnot just from the CSI manager.\n\n250\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.124\nSo let's take a look at\nour one pointer then.\n\n251\n00:15:26.124 --> 00:15:28.895\nNow one pointer there is B.\n\n252\n00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:32.400\nA CSI register to list all possible\nimprovement opportunities,\n\n253\n00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.190\nthat's not wrong.\n\n254\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.670\nOkay, we don't mind a CSI register.\n\n255\n00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.250\nAnd in fact actually it's really\nimportant to have a CSI register.\n\n256\n00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.500\nBut it's not critical\nto the success of CSI.\n\n257\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.950\nIt's not something that we\nhave to have in this instance.\n\n258\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.440\nIt's not going to cause us to\nfail if we don't have one.\n\n259\n00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.427\nSo a defining clay criteria for\nthe prioritization of these projects or\n\n260\n00:15:57.427 --> 00:16:00.754\ninitiatives that I mentioned\nin the CSI register.\n\n261\n00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:04.598\nWell we kind of gone off down the wrong\nroad and we're just carrying on down that\n\n262\n00:16:04.598 --> 00:16:08.386\nroad at the moment because Now we're\nstill talking about the CSR register and\n\n263\n00:16:08.386 --> 00:16:11.260\nwe're talking about prioritizing\nthose improvements.\n\n264\n00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.186\nWe've got our priorities,\nthey're in the scenario, okay?\n\n265\n00:16:14.186 --> 00:16:16.240\nThey're those three strategies.\n\n266\n00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.690\nThey are our priorities.\n\n267\n00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.320\nAnd what about resource allocation for\n\n268\n00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.320\nthe improvement opportunities\nthroughout the life cycle?\n\n269\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.480\nI like that but\nI don't see any management commitment and\n\n270\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.770\nI don't see any commitment\nto provide in funds.\n\n271\n00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.810\nSo I do like that, but I'm looking for\nvisible, on going, long term commitment\n\n272\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.130\nand I'm not looking for\njust commitment throughout the project.\n\n273\n00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.320\nCSI something that goes on and on and on.\n\n274\n00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.800\nCSI is not something that's\njust a one off activity.\n\n275\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.680\nSo we're not just thinking about projects.\n\n276\n00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.130\nWe've got to think about all of\nour improvement initiatives.\n\n277\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.980\nAnd then let's look at\nour distractor then.\n\n278\n00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.220\nC is all distractor, adopting service\nmanagement processes to suit the IT\n\n279\n00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.250\nvision, all that makes me want\nto run away and hide, okay?\n\n280\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.060\nAdopting service management processes,\nokay,\n\n281\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.150\nwe will implement to CSI\nto suit the ITs vision?\n\n282\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.140\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n283\n00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.470\nWe've gotta be aligned to\nthe business vision, okay?\n\n284\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.350\nWe've gotta be aligned\nto the business vision.\n\n285\n00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.310\nEmbedding CSI into\neveryone's job description.\n\n286\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.320\n[LAUGH] Again, this makes me laugh but\nit also makes me wanna run away and hide.\n\n287\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.010\nJust because you put something in my\njob description doesn't mean that I am\n\n288\n00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.560\ngoing to do it.\n\n289\n00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.890\nCSI has to be part of a culture, we have\nto embed it into the culture, which means\n\n290\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.330\nwe need that ongoing management\ncommitment in order to do this, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.930\nBut telling somebody that they're going\nto do something doesn't mean that they're\n\n292\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.270\nnecessarily going to do it.\n\n293\n00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.160\nAnd the prioritizing\nimprovement initiatives,\n\n294\n00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.820\nwell we've got the priorities\nin the scenario and\n\n295\n00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.160\nthen placing them appropriately\nwithin the service lifecycle.\n\n296\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.790\nOkay, that means then in other words\nallocating to the appropriate person.\n\n297\n00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.710\nThat sounds okay but you see,\nthroughout that whole answer\n\n298\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.010\nI see no reference to the organization,\nnone whatsoever.\n\n299\n00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.900\nAnd surely if we're implementing CSI\nbecause we want to be better aligned\n\n300\n00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.657\nto the organization's vision,\n\n301\n00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:19.562\nthen we need to have some reference\nto the organization, of course we do.\n\n302\n00:18:19.562 --> 00:18:24.510\nOkay, so let's take a look then\nat question number three and\n\n303\n00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:29.610\nquestion number three well\nthat refers to scenario two.\n\n304\n00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.970\nSo we have a new scenario here.\n\n305\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.600\nOkay, so\nduring an internal review meeting,\n\n306\n00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.140\nthe service owner reported that the\nbusiness regularly complains at service\n\n307\n00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.130\nreview meetings about the deterioration\nin the quality of the service.\n\n308\n00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.070\nNow process this within the IT\norganization well they're at a mixed level\n\n309\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.770\nof maturity.\n\n310\n00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:56.390\nSo again, we're going back to CMMI here\nin we see that incident problem and\n\n311\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.980\nasset and configuration management.\n\n312\n00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.090\nSupply management are between three and\nfour but the others are between four and\n\n313\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.820\nthree and\navailability management is at level two.\n\n314\n00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.350\nWe've got most elements in place but\nthey're not formally recognized.\n\n315\n00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.350\nAnd we don't have much in\nthe way of strategic thinking.\n\n316\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:20.342\nWe carry out reporting but they're not\nconsidered accurate because of immaturity,\n\n317\n00:19:20.342 --> 00:19:25.102\nand IT operations are not carrying out\nroutine maintenance tasks on time, okay.\n\n318\n00:19:25.102 --> 00:19:29.190\nYou're the newly appointed CSI manager.\n\n319\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.410\nThat's always an important point.\n\n320\n00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:37.730\nTake a look at the context and\nthe scalability of the organization.\n\n321\n00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.860\nYou're the newly appointed manager and\n\n322\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.920\nyou are going to communicate\nthat vision statement.\n\n323\n00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.590\nAnd you want to formulate\na plan of action.\n\n324\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.065\nSo you want some quick wins here.\n\n325\n00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:57.350\nSo which of these then as the most\nimportant to show visibility of CSI?\n\n326\n00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.940\nAnd it says it will win\nover the skeptics as well.\n\n327\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.060\nWell, let me take a look\nthen at our answers.\n\n328\n00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.120\nAnd our five point here is D.\n\n329\n00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.790\nThis looks at implementing CSI,\nand we looked at that\n\n330\n00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:18.010\nin a very recent episode,\nthe implementation of CSI.\n\n331\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.890\nAnd one of the things that I said to\nyou is a pick a pain point, okay.\n\n332\n00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.740\nWhat is the pain point?\n\n333\n00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.570\nThe pain point here is a service and\n\n334\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.570\nthat's service is the one where we've\nreceived all of the complaints.\n\n335\n00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:36.880\nSo, we need to pick a pain point and\ndate else as what that pain point is.\n\n336\n00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.940\nThe service is critical,\nit should be selected as a starting point,\n\n337\n00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.040\nwe're starting with the service.\n\n338\n00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.470\nA low accurate information\nis not available.\n\n339\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:51.260\nSome evidence of what might be causing\nmight be obtained by enabling or\n\n340\n00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.390\nby asking problem management and\nchange management to look at trends.\n\n341\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:59.990\nThat's pro-active problem management,\nremember this from service operation.\n\n342\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.820\nAnd then the technical and application\nteams are also going to be able\n\n343\n00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.640\nto help by consolidating\nthe information and using,\n\n344\n00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.490\nbecause they have the technical expertise,\nand using our configuration\n\n345\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.010\nmanagement system to identify\nwhich other components are shared.\n\n346\n00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:15.720\nIn other words,\n\n347\n00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.830\nall the components that are used to\ndeliver that particular service.\n\n348\n00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.060\nAnd identify unreliable components.\n\n349\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.460\nThat's part of availability management.\n\n350\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.710\nSo that addresses absolutely\neverything in this scenario.\n\n351\n00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.330\nSo let's look at our three pointer than.\n\n352\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.450\nAnd our three pointer is A.\n\n353\n00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.941\nAnd let's see why it's only A,\nit's only our three pointer.\n\n354\n00:21:38.283 --> 00:21:42.538\nSo, as we pointed out,\nreview the IT operations function.\n\n355\n00:21:42.538 --> 00:21:46.828\nWell, for a start we want to do\nis actually focus on the service,\n\n356\n00:21:46.828 --> 00:21:48.960\nthat's the paying point.\n\n357\n00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.710\nWhilst operations is mentioned\nwithin the scenario as not\n\n358\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.290\nperforming routine maintenance, it's\nnot mentioned as the big paying point.\n\n359\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.566\nSo therefore, the operation functions\nwill not be the right place to start.\n\n360\n00:22:02.566 --> 00:22:05.740\nWe don't want a functional approach.\n\n361\n00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.570\nAnd then of course we go on to,\nand very similar to the last one,\n\n362\n00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.160\nwe kinda started off down the wrong\nroad and we're gonna continue on.\n\n363\n00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:19.773\nBecause we're gonna audit the team for\ncompliance against procedures to ascertain\n\n364\n00:22:19.773 --> 00:22:24.330\nif they are in fact performing\npreventative maintenance on time or not.\n\n365\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.780\nOkay, but\n\n366\n00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.890\nlike I said we've kinda gone down\nthe wrong road and now we're carrying on.\n\n367\n00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.700\nWhilst there's nothing\nwrong with that answer,\n\n368\n00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.770\nit doesn't address the fact\nthat we've got an issue.\n\n369\n00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.370\nWe've got a problem with\nthat particular service.\n\n370\n00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.860\nReviewing the component measurement\nactivities of technical and\n\n371\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:48.630\napplication management to identify if\ndata can be used widely, that's okay.\n\n372\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.600\nWhen we start talking\nabout collaboration and\n\n373\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.810\nwe start talking about shared\ncomponents of the services.\n\n374\n00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:58.070\nThat's not a problem in itself, but\nagain it doesn't address the pain point in\n\n375\n00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:03.270\nthe scenario, which is very clearly\nthat the owner of a critical service\n\n376\n00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:08.370\nhas reported that the business complains\nabout the performance of a service.\n\n377\n00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.060\nSo we need to start with the service and\nnot with the teams.\n\n378\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.390\nSo let's take a look then at C.\n\n379\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.780\nC is our one pointer.\n\n380\n00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.670\nIdentify if the service\nmeets the business needs.\n\n381\n00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.444\nOkay, I quite like that,\nbecause we are going back to the business.\n\n382\n00:23:25.444 --> 00:23:29.120\nBut then I don't like the assumption.\n\n383\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.430\nIt's likely that the reason the business\nis unhappy is that it doesn't meet their\n\n384\n00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.170\nrequirements where does it say that?\n\n385\n00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.740\nThat's a huge assumption.\n\n386\n00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.020\nLooking into deficiencies in the service\nlifecycle would be a good place to start.\n\n387\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.266\nWe're looking at the integration between\nprocesses in the integration between\n\n388\n00:23:46.266 --> 00:23:49.146\nlifecycle phases is that\nreally a good place to start?\n\n389\n00:23:49.146 --> 00:23:54.190\nWhat we want to know is what's\ngoing on with the service?\n\n390\n00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.242\nSo the service itself would\nbe a good place to start.\n\n391\n00:23:57.242 --> 00:24:00.231\nThis has us looking at\nthe lifecycle itself.\n\n392\n00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:04.427\nAnd then monitoring outputs of\nthe lifecycle stages Again,\n\n393\n00:24:04.427 --> 00:24:09.200\nwe've started on down the wrong road and\nwe kind of carried on.\n\n394\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.510\nSo this one is, well,\nit's almost a distractor.\n\n395\n00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.660\nBecause you know what?\n\n396\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.330\nIt starts off with going back to\nthe business, and you think, hey,\n\n397\n00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.250\nthat sounds great.\n\n398\n00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.990\nBut then it makes one awful assumption and\nthat assumption is that the reason\n\n399\n00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.960\nthe business is unhappy is because it\ndoesn't actually meet their requirements.\n\n400\n00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.690\nOnce I've read that assumption\nagain that has me running.\n\n401\n00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.514\nSo let's take a look at my distractor and\nmy distractor here is B.\n\n402\n00:24:35.514 --> 00:24:38.702\n[LAUGH] And read that first.\n\n403\n00:24:38.702 --> 00:24:42.680\n[LAUGH] That first statement\nis enough to have you running.\n\n404\n00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.520\nDiscount the quality information.\n\n405\n00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.720\nYou should never discount anything, okay?\n\n406\n00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.330\nWe always wants to consider it\nfirst before we discount it.\n\n407\n00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.935\nThere's not accurate information\non service delivery and so\n\n408\n00:24:54.935 --> 00:25:00.380\nthe issues with the service are only\nthe perception of the business, no, sure.\n\n409\n00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.660\nOkay we're talking about\nvalue perception and\n\n410\n00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.340\nwe're talking about\ndelivering perceived value.\n\n411\n00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.690\nBut you can't make that assumption.\n\n412\n00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.250\nThe issues with the service are only\nabout the perception of the business.\n\n413\n00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.460\nRemember what I said to\nyou about SLAM charts?\n\n414\n00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.744\nIf I see an all green SLAM chart and\n\n415\n00:25:17.744 --> 00:25:21.589\nthen I'm not gonna be happy\nas a service level manager.\n\n416\n00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:25.626\nI want to see where I'm just about to\nbreach targets because an all green\n\n417\n00:25:25.626 --> 00:25:29.326\nslam chart, well, I can guarantee\nthat I could go to the users and\n\n418\n00:25:29.326 --> 00:25:30.960\nask them if they're happy.\n\n419\n00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.010\nIf they've perceived value and\nthey'll say no, okay?\n\n420\n00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:39.798\nSo we don't discount\nany of the information.\n\n421\n00:25:39.798 --> 00:25:42.540\nAnd we don't assume that\ntheir perception is wrong.\n\n422\n00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.359\nTheir perception is actually\nwhat we've got to deliver,\n\n423\n00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:47.380\nwe've got to deliver value perception.\n\n424\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.954\nSo the lack information needs\nto be rectified so there should\n\n425\n00:25:51.954 --> 00:25:56.502\nbe a concentrated effort to identify and\nprocure the appropriate monitoring tools.\n\n426\n00:25:56.502 --> 00:26:00.590\nAgain, the first step of that\nstatement isn't incorrect and\n\n427\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.560\nI don't mind the first part.\n\n428\n00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.590\nBut then it says,\ngo out and buy something!\n\n429\n00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.310\nGo out and buy something, and\nit will fix everything for you.\n\n430\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.250\nNo, we haven't got a cold.\n\n431\n00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.215\nWe can't just go out and buy a pill and\nthat's going to make us feel all better.\n\n432\n00:26:14.215 --> 00:26:16.725\nGoing out and buying a tool, well\n\n433\n00:26:16.725 --> 00:26:21.045\nit's only going to facilitate whatever\noutcome it is that you've got defined.\n\n434\n00:26:21.045 --> 00:26:23.105\nAnd if you've got\nthe wrong outcome defined,\n\n435\n00:26:23.105 --> 00:26:28.475\nthen a tool is only gonna get you to\nthe wrong outcome quicker and that's all.\n\n436\n00:26:28.475 --> 00:26:31.915\nSo the answer is not in\nsomething you can buy somewhere.\n\n437\n00:26:31.915 --> 00:26:35.890\nThe answer is in your own service.\n\n438\n00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:40.450\nAnd the answer is in looking in that\nservice to find out what's wrong.\n\n439\n00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.280\nAnd then it says here, it goes on again,\n\n440\n00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.600\nwe carry on them the wrong road when\nthose monitoring tools are in place.\n\n441\n00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.695\nThen we can analyze the resulting\ninformation to identify why this service\n\n442\n00:26:50.695 --> 00:26:51.660\nis failing.\n\n443\n00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.580\nWe've already got the information in\nhouse, we just have to get it, that's all.\n\n444\n00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.590\nSo lets now take look at\nquestion number four then.\n\n445\n00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:06.858\nAnd question number 4 looks at you as a,\n\n446\n00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:11.207\nbear in mind looking at\nscenario number three.\n\n447\n00:27:11.207 --> 00:27:15.731\nQuestion number 4 looks at use of\nchange manager to improve the change\n\n448\n00:27:15.731 --> 00:27:19.350\nmanagement process in this\nparticular organization.\n\n449\n00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.610\nSo you just started your new job and\nyou want to change, change management.\n\n450\n00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.800\nYou want to be aligned to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n451\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.070\nBut the only documentation available\nis a process flow chart showing\n\n452\n00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.480\nhow the process currently is carried out.\n\n453\n00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.609\nChanges are logged onto a tool that's\nbeen designed and implemented in house.\n\n454\n00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:46.260\nBut you're suspecting that more changes\nhappen than are actually recorded.\n\n455\n00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.605\nYou've extracted some data and your\ninitial observation shows that there's\n\n456\n00:27:50.605 --> 00:27:55.027\na high percentage of emergency changes\ncompared to what you've experienced.\n\n457\n00:27:55.027 --> 00:27:59.450\nAnd of course emergency changes as\nwe know from service transition,\n\n458\n00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.670\nemergency changes are high risk.\n\n459\n00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:06.190\nThey generally reduce testing, that the\nonly changes that can be implemented in\n\n460\n00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:12.010\na change freeze and an emergency change,\nwell, needs to be implemented right now.\n\n461\n00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.120\nSo, as we've said,\nthere's an increased risk, and\n\n462\n00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.720\nthere's reduced testing, and the other\nthing about an emergency change is,\n\n463\n00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.880\nthat the documentation tends to\nbe retrospective, which means,\n\n464\n00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:27.040\nthat you don't raise the change record\nfirst, you raise the RFC after the change.\n\n465\n00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.350\nWell, clearly, that's not happening, okay?\n\n466\n00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:32.765\nSo what is the best answer then?\n\n467\n00:28:32.765 --> 00:28:36.250\nWhat's the best approach to make\nimprovements in the process\n\n468\n00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.550\nin this organization?\n\n469\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.370\nWell, let's take a look\nat our five pointer.\n\n470\n00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:46.250\nAnd our five pointer is A, which is\nunderstanding the needs of the business in\n\n471\n00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:50.786\nrelation to change management and\nthen go down to the next bullet point.\n\n472\n00:28:50.786 --> 00:28:55.653\nCarry out an unbiased\nsnapshot of where we are now.\n\n473\n00:28:55.653 --> 00:28:59.352\nAnd then the next bullet point\nis understand the priorities for\n\n474\n00:28:59.352 --> 00:29:03.696\nimprovement such as a gap analysis in\nother words, where do we want to be?\n\n475\n00:29:03.696 --> 00:29:08.650\nAnd then detail the plan to achieve more\neffective change in management process.\n\n476\n00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:09.770\nHow do we get there?\n\n477\n00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.935\nHang on a minute.\n\n478\n00:29:11.935 --> 00:29:15.990\nSo A, well,\nthat's that my CSI approach isn't it,\n\n479\n00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:20.500\nstarting point, is to understand the needs\nof the business, that's my vision.\n\n480\n00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.150\nThen the second one, that's my baseline.\n\n481\n00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:28.050\nThen, the third bullet point,\nthat's the okay, where do I want to be?\n\n482\n00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.220\nAnd then the fourth is how do I get there?\n\n483\n00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.610\nThat's my CSI approach, right there.\n\n484\n00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.130\nOkay, I like the look of that one.\n\n485\n00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.715\nLet's take a look at my three pointer,\nwhich is B.\n\n486\n00:29:38.715 --> 00:29:40.259\nRight, the starting point,\n\n487\n00:29:40.259 --> 00:29:44.280\nunderstand the needs of the business\nin relation to change management.\n\n488\n00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.130\nOkay, gauge the customer and\nIT's perception of the process.\n\n489\n00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.250\nThat's okay, but I really like A better.\n\n490\n00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:56.740\nBecause A encompasses all of our\nstakeholders not just the customer and IT.\n\n491\n00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.080\nCompare the information to\ncurrent process documentation and\n\n492\n00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.600\nprioritize the differences.\n\n493\n00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.070\nOkay, we conducted a gap analysis there.\n\n494\n00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.390\nSurely that though comes as,\n\n495\n00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:13.110\nwell we've gotta take our\ncurrent baseline, haven't we?\n\n496\n00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.090\nIt says compare it to current\nprocess documentation, but\n\n497\n00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.300\nwhere have we got the process\ndocumentation because don't have any.\n\n498\n00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.360\nIt says so in the scenario.\n\n499\n00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.920\nOr certainly we don't have anything that's\nexplicit, it says that in the scenario.\n\n500\n00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.290\nUnderstand and agree on the priorities to\nimprove the change management process.\n\n501\n00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:31.790\nOkay.\n\n502\n00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.040\nAnd then there's an example.\n\n503\n00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.030\nPeople may not have the same\nunderstanding of change categorizations.\n\n504\n00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.580\nSo include business impact and\nurgency to help set priority.\n\n505\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.570\nThat should be agreed in the SLA.\n\n506\n00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.200\nNow we know that from\nservice level management.\n\n507\n00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.890\nThat's a target in the SLA and\n\n508\n00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:52.619\nwe should have a table for prioritization\nin our service level agreement.\n\n509\n00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.870\nAnd then educate people on the reasons for\n\n510\n00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.190\ncompliance with the process and\nimplement some quick wins.\n\n511\n00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.270\nEducate people for\nthe reasons for compliance.\n\n512\n00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.900\nOkay, but\nyou haven't outlined them in this answer.\n\n513\n00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.380\nSo please, tell me what\nare the reasons for compliance?\n\n514\n00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.770\nAnd just because you're educating people\ndoesn't mean that they're necessarily\n\n515\n00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.700\ngoing to follow that process.\n\n516\n00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.750\nIt's not about just telling people.\n\n517\n00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:23.040\nYou can't use a baseball bat all the time,\nyou have to encourage people.\n\n518\n00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.670\nYou have to convince people\nthat this is a good idea.\n\n519\n00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.390\nSo let's look at our one pointer then,\nlet's look at C.\n\n520\n00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:33.950\nApply the CSI approach and\nunderstand where are we right now.\n\n521\n00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.140\nWell if you're applying the CSI approach\nthen you need to work out what your vision\n\n522\n00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.590\nis first, that's the first stage.\n\n523\n00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:44.650\nPrioritize improvements to\nthe change management process okay.\n\n524\n00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.960\nThat's where do we want to be is it or\n\n525\n00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.690\nis that how we get there that's\nmore like how we get there.\n\n526\n00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:54.370\nSo if we're applying the CSI approach\nthen we're missing a few steps out there.\n\n527\n00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.250\nWe're kind of jumping around.\n\n528\n00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:01.076\nThe level of emergency changes needs to be\nreduced to 5% from it's current position\n\n529\n00:32:01.076 --> 00:32:01.760\nof 20%.\n\n530\n00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.890\nWhere does it say that?\n\n531\n00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.260\nDoes it say that anywhere?\n\n532\n00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:07.870\nI don't see that.\n\n533\n00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.070\nOkay, there's an assumption.\n\n534\n00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.870\nClearly define what constitutes\nan emergency change and\n\n535\n00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.290\npublish it within\nthe process documentation.\n\n536\n00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.180\nNow, again, go back to your last answer.\n\n537\n00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.500\nThis has got to be agreed in your service\nlevel agreement with the business.\n\n538\n00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.870\nWe just don't make the rules.\n\n539\n00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.210\nWe've gotta be aligned to\nthe needs of the business, so\n\n540\n00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.320\nit's gotta be agreed with them.\n\n541\n00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.290\nAnd then once improvements have been made,\n\n542\n00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.065\nmeasure the level of emergency changes\nto see if the objectives have been met.\n\n543\n00:32:35.065 --> 00:32:38.830\n[LAUGH] What, these objectives that you've\njust plucked out of thin air, those.\n\n544\n00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.400\nOkay, all right then.\n\n545\n00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.170\nI mean, in itself,\nin isolation that statement is okay, but\n\n546\n00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:49.370\nit's got no relation It's got no relevance\nto the scenario because again we've\n\n547\n00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.057\nplucked this objective\nout of the thin air.\n\n548\n00:32:51.057 --> 00:32:55.290\nOnce they've been met and further\nimprovements can be considered, and\n\n549\n00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:59.130\nagain, it's not about statement\nto make but it has no relevance,\n\n550\n00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.290\nbecause we plucked that\nobjective out of thin air.\n\n551\n00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.050\nNow I really love the distractor on\nthis particular question, which is D.\n\n552\n00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.215\nAnd that distractor it says, as you're\nnew in the post, don't do anything.\n\n553\n00:33:09.215 --> 00:33:13.720\n[LAUGH] And that's why this is my\nfavorite answer out of this whole paper.\n\n554\n00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.670\nYou're new, so don't do anything, okay.\n\n555\n00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:19.840\nJust sit back, have a cup of tea and\nrelax and everything will be okay.\n\n556\n00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.920\nAnd because look at this, the level\nof measures he changes will settle.\n\n557\n00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.580\nCuz it's been coming down over the last\nfive periods, so it's bound to settle.\n\n558\n00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.055\nThe tool used to log changes has been\nbuilt in house and is not sufficient for\n\n559\n00:33:32.055 --> 00:33:35.266\na process that will be aligned\nto ITIL best practice.\n\n560\n00:33:35.266 --> 00:33:37.190\nWow there's an assumption.\n\n561\n00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.890\nWithout any evaluation whatsoever\nit's probably not going to be useful.\n\n562\n00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.470\nSo therefore we're just gonna discard it.\n\n563\n00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:49.680\nSimply guaranteeing change in\nthe tool will not guarantee its use.\n\n564\n00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.630\nSo talk to everyone to ensure\nthat they record every change.\n\n565\n00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:57.720\nYeah cuz we implemented organizational\nchange management in there didn't we.\n\n566\n00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:03.110\nTell everybody to use this new\ntool that we haven't yet got.\n\n567\n00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:08.300\nYeah, that's a distractor,\nmost definitely so, because the answer,\n\n568\n00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.860\nit cannot be do nothing.\n\n569\n00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.120\nYou've been asked in the question\nwhat you're going to do next, so\n\n570\n00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.910\nthe answer simply can't be do nothing.\n\n571\n00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.370\nOkay, so now we'd look at the first\nfour questions in the sample paper.\n\n572\n00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:27.030\nWhat we're going to do now is we're\ngoing to take a short break and\n\n573\n00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.880\nI'd like you to come back for\nour next session.\n\n574\n00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.970\nAnd then on next session will be looking\nat question five through to question eight\n\n575\n00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:36.100\nfrom the sample paper.\n\n576\n00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.580\n[SOUND]\n\n",
