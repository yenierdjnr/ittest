          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.040\nHi, and welcome to ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.210\nMy name is Jo Peacock and\n\n4\n00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.190\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL intermediate.\n\n5\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.710\nSo, let's take a look then,\nat our first slide here, coming up and\n\n6\n00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.840\nwe have our introduction to\nour intermediate class and\n\n7\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming intermediate class.\n\n8\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.340\nYou will see what we will cover\nis an introduction to the class,\n\n9\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.100\nfollowed by the principles and\nthe processes of the Life Cycle phase.\n\n10\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.240\nThen we'll take a look at organizing for\n\n11\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.500\nthat Life Cycle phase and\nalso the technology considerations,\n\n12\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270\nespecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n13\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.880\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand the critical success factors, and\n\n14\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.110\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith that particular lifecycle phase.\n\n15\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.850\nAnd most importantly, of course,\nfor you is that preparation for\n\n16\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.980\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class.\n\n17\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.670\nSo let me take a look now then at how\nwe're going to approach this particular\n\n18\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.790\nintermediate class.\n\n19\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work.\n\n20\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.550\nObviously, you're going to be watching us\non screen, both myself and my colleagues,\n\n21\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110\nand we're going to be taking you through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n22\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.910\nAnd then there are going\nto be some discussions and\n\n23\n00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.530\nsome exercises that are going to be\nbased primarily in our chat rooms,\n\n24\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.140\nand also in our forums as well.\n\n25\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.530\nAnd we're also available if you want\nto undertake any of the assessments,\n\n26\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.840\nthen please feel free to come\nback to us via the forums.\n\n27\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.270\nAnd we will be able to help\nyou out in anyway we can.\n\n28\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.130\nAlso provided in the course material,\nwhich is available for you to download,\n\n29\n00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.540\nare mock tests or\nexams if you prefer to use that word and\n\n30\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.720\nwe will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you.\n\n31\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.770\nSo where are we then at\nITIL intermediate level?\n\n32\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.590\nWell, you'll see in using\nBloom's Taxonomy that we are actually at\n\n33\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.090\nlevel 4, analyzing.\n\n34\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.806\nIn other words, at the foundation level,\nwe've done the remembering and\n\n35\n00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:24.660\nthe understanding of those concepts\nwithin ITIL, and we are actually moving\n\n36\n00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.160\nthrough applying those concepts\nto analyzing those concepts and\n\n37\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.240\nbeing able to apply the ITIL processes and\n\n38\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.130\nalso the concepts at a real world level,\nin a real world situation, okay.\n\n39\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.590\nSo where does ITIL come from then?\n\n40\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.080\nWell let me give you a little\nbit of a background.\n\n41\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.430\nIt's actually owned by\na company called Axelos and\n\n42\n00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.110\nit was first published in the mid\n1980s by the UK government.\n\n43\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.430\nAnd the office of government\ncommerce owned ITIL for a very,\n\n44\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.509\nvery long time and we developed ITIL\nright the way back to the 1980s.\n\n45\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.300\nThrough it's version two in the 1990s,\n\n46\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.820\nmid 1990s, to version three\nwhich was released in 2007 and\n\n47\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.920\nthere was an update to\nversion three in 2011.\n\n48\n00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.460\nWhich is exactly where we are right now,\nit is copyrighted,\n\n49\n00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.750\nis trade-mark protected, it's\na framework for managing services, and\n\n50\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.830\nthis, should you say flexible framework,\na framework that we would expect\n\n51\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.940\nany organization to adopt as a framework,\nbut then to adapt it to suit your needs.\n\n52\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.960\nitSMF was born right the way in the 1980s\nout of a desire to be able to demonstrate\n\n53\n00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.340\nvalue for money and efficiency for\nthe use of tax payers Money within the UK.\n\n54\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.650\nWay back in the 1980s,\nthese things started appearing on desks.\n\n55\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.880\nAnd quite frankly, we didn't know\nhow to manage these in an unbiased,\n\n56\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.360\nin an impartial, and\nin efficient and effective way.\n\n57\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.420\nAnd thus ITIL was born.\n\n58\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.110\nAnd ITIL was born from\na group of industry experts\n\n59\n00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.960\nthat went out into the big wide world and\nanalyzed various organizations.\n\n60\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.270\nFrom various different industry sectors,\nnot just government but\n\n61\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.690\nwe're talking finance,\nwe're talking retail, etc.\n\n62\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.230\nAnd they came back with\na set of best practices.\n\n63\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.380\nBest practices that they observed in the\nreal world for managing our IT services.\n\n64\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.220\nAnd thus we have ITIL.\n\n65\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.520\nAnd as I've already said,\nwe've had subsequent revisions.\n\n66\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.800\nAnd now we're up to versions 3 2011.\n\n67\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.240\nSo we work on the understanding that\nwe have a life to every single service.\n\n68\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.780\nAnd we start off with the concept and\nservice strategy, and then,\n\n69\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.600\nwe take that concept and\nwe design it, and then we develop it,\n\n70\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.360\nand we deploy it as a service\ninto a live environment,\n\n71\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.520\nwhich is where we operate and\nwhere we maintain it.\n\n72\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.345\nAnd we continually seek to ensure that we\n\n73\n00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:22.230\nare aligned with the needs\nof the organization in CSI.\n\n74\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.040\nSo, you're attending this class\nbecause you probably want\n\n75\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.040\nto achieve an ITIL\nintermediate qualification.\n\n76\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.920\nSo you can see that if we were\nto start off right at the very,\n\n77\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.280\nvery top, you'll see where I am.\n\n78\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n79\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.610\nI'm also a credited examiner and\nproctor or invigilator for\n\n80\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.020\nthese exams and work very, very closely\nwith the official ITIL accreditor and\n\n81\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.560\nalso Axelos who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n82\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.080\nNow in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n83\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.130\nWell, we start off with ITIL Foundation\nand ITIL Foundation would traditionally be\n\n84\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:20.020\na three-day classroom experience where\nwe learn the foundations of ITIL.\n\n85\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.640\nAnd we learned all the terminology and all\nof the definitions to that terminology.\n\n86\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.900\nThere's roughly around about 75 that we\nlearned within the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n87\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.530\nAnd then as we move through, we can either\ntake a ITIL partition class, which can be\n\n88\n00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.820\ntaken at any point in time throughout the\nprogression of your career within ITIL.\n\n89\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.220\nBecause ITIL practitioner focuses on\nthe implementation of ITIL, okay?\n\n90\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.960\nWhereas if we take a look at the more\nadvanced intermediate classes you are at\n\n91\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.040\nthis moment in a Lifecycle Module.\n\n92\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.720\nAnd those Lifecycles consist of\nservice strategy, service design,\n\n93\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.470\nservice transition, service operation,\nand continual service improvement.\n\n94\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.680\nAnd that's where we focus on those\nLifecycles that we've just looked at\n\n95\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.330\npreviously.\n\n96\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.630\nOkay.\nAnd on the right-hand side then,\n\n97\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.630\nwe have our Capability Modules, and\nthese Capability Modules really\n\n98\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:22.020\nfocus on specific areas\nwithin ITIL such as\n\n99\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.560\nRCV focuses on release control and\nvalidation.\n\n100\n00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.240\nAnd these classes,\nyou will notice that every single\n\n101\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.430\none of these classes has got\na skull right beside each one.\n\n102\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.229\nSo we go to number two for\nITIL Foundation and we've got a three for\n\n103\n00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:44.660\nLife Cycle modules, and we've got\na four for our capabilities modules.\n\n104\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.710\nNow, what we need to do is\nensure that we have achieved\n\n105\n00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:55.425\na minimum of fifteen credits\nat both either Lifecycle or\n\n106\n00:07:55.425 --> 00:08:00.555\nCapability module level in order\nto be able to qualify to sit\n\n107\n00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:04.165\nthe Managing Across\nthe Life Cycle class and\n\n108\n00:08:04.165 --> 00:08:08.665\ntherefore subsequently the test\nthat goes along with that class.\n\n109\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:11.995\nSo we need to take two\nfrom the ITIL foundation.\n\n110\n00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:13.065\nThat's a prerequisite.\n\n111\n00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:14.905\nWe have to do the foundation.\n\n112\n00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:19.500\nAnd then we need to add in\nanother 15 scores from either,\n\n113\n00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.890\nas I've said, the Life Cycle or\nthe Capability Stream.\n\n114\n00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.090\nYou can interchange.\n\n115\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.560\nYou can mix and match.\n\n116\n00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.100\nYou do not have to stick to one stream or\nthe other.\n\n117\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.055\nOnce you've got that 17 in total,\n\n118\n00:08:32.055 --> 00:08:37.165\nboth scores that are needed to be able\nto sit managing across the Lifecycle.\n\n119\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:41.345\nYou're perfectly able to sit\nthat Lifecycle class, and\n\n120\n00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.845\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n121\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.145\nAnd as soon as you've taken that test,\nyou will be awarded those five credits.\n\n122\n00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:52.535\nWhich will mean that you\nhave achieved ITL Expert.\n\n123\n00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:57.250\nNow ITL Expert is allocated\nas soon as you have Pass\n\n124\n00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.510\nthe management across the Lifecycle\ntest and have achieved 22 credits.\n\n125\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.770\nBoth of those must happen in order for\nyou to achieve ITIL expert.\n\n126\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.620\nNow we have the ITIL Master\nqualification and\n\n127\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.630\nthe ITIL Master is\na completely different beast.\n\n128\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.220\nThe ITIL Master is a two\nyear qualification.\n\n129\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.750\nAnd during that two years, you will be\nexpected to submit various white papers\n\n130\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.500\non specific topics within\nthe ideal qualifications scheme.\n\n131\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.870\nSo these could be topics\non activities within ITIL.\n\n132\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.830\nThese could be topics on\nprocesses within ITIL.\n\n133\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.870\nThese could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n134\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:51.410\nYou will be required to submit a number of\nwhite papers over the period of two years.\n\n135\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.520\nAt the end of those two years,\nonce you have submitted the prerequisite\n\n136\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers, then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n137\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.630\nAnd during that panel interview,\nyou will be assessed.\n\n138\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.930\nNot only on your white papers but\n\n139\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.631\nalso on your experience within\nthe IT service management arena.\n\n140\n00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:14.540\nAnd at the end of that\npanel interview then if\n\n141\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.020\nsuccessful you will be awarded\nto state of this ITIL master.\n\n142\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.810\nSo the qualification scheme, I'm going to\ntake this back now to Bloom's Taxonomy\n\n143\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.360\nthen and just very, very quickly look at\nthe fact that in ITIL Foundation, and\n\n144\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.992\nI know that I've already covered\nthis in a previous slide.\n\n145\n00:10:31.992 --> 00:10:36.700\nBut we've just looked at understanding,\nunderstanding the terminology and\n\n146\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.345\nthe concepts of ITIL foundation.\n\n147\n00:10:39.345 --> 00:10:41.340\nAnd then in the Lifecycle modules,\n\n148\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.700\nwe're looking at implementing\nthose processes contained within.\n\n149\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.990\nAnd then capability, we're looking at\nactually undertaking those processes and\n\n150\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.070\nmanaging those processes.\n\n151\n00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.890\nWith managing across the Lifecycle,\nthis is so senior management.\n\n152\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.090\nThis is that CIO level and\nit's senior management level.\n\n153\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.905\nAnd in MALC as we like\nto abbreviate it to,\n\n154\n00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:10.475\nyour concern with leading\nIT Service Management.\n\n155\n00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:15.385\nSo I mentioned right to the very beginning\nof all of this that we had a test\n\n156\n00:11:15.385 --> 00:11:20.735\nto go along with every single\nLifecycle phase and varies.\n\n157\n00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:25.865\nAnd we will be conducting a session to\ngo all over this particular test or\n\n158\n00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:30.530\nat least a sample of this test just\nto give you some preparation for\n\n159\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.960\nthe actual test itself.\n\n160\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.600\nSo, your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually.\n\n161\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.699\nIt is an eight multiple\nchoice question test.\n\n162\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.390\nIt's complex multiple choice.\n\n163\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.440\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test and\n\n164\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.640\nwith every single question,\nyou will be given a scenario.\n\n165\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.270\nAnd then you will be given\nfour possible options,\n\n166\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.730\nfour possible answers, for the question\nthat is posed along with that scenario.\n\n167\n00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.830\nYou get 5 points for the best fit answer.\n\n168\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.410\nNow it mentions up there,\nthe most correct.\n\n169\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.910\nI always call it the best fit\nbecause every single question asks\n\n170\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.300\nwhat is the best answer given\nthe scenario and given the question.\n\n171\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.350\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct\n\n172\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.540\nbecause the question is asking you for\n\n173\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.990\nthe best and for that best fit\nyou're going to get five points.\n\n174\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.130\nFor the next best fit you're\ngoing to get three, for\n\n175\n00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:41.410\nthe next one which we've considered to be\nthe least correct your going to get one.\n\n176\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.240\nAnd for the next one you're going\nto get zero now it mentions\n\n177\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.020\nup on that slide there that the next\none is zero marks for incorrect.\n\n178\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.310\nWe like to call that in the industry.\n\n179\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:13:00.600\nWe call that the distracter and we call it\ndistracter for a reason cuz it distracts.\n\n180\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.990\nAnd quite often is what you will find is\nwith your distracter a lot of the words\n\n181\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.599\nand the terminology that are taken\nstraight out of the ITIL book,\n\n182\n00:13:08.599 --> 00:13:13.580\nstraight out of the publication and\nare put into that 0 appointed.\n\n183\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.490\nBecause it's there to distract.\n\n184\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:21.250\nAnd it sounds great but more often than\nnot that distracter has absolutely\n\n185\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.600\nno relevance to the scenario or\nto the question.\n\n186\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.390\nSo you have to be incredibly\ncareful with that.\n\n187\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.480\nIt's so easy to be distracted.\n\n188\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.370\nYou have to get 28 out of a possible\n40 in order to be able to pass and\n\n189\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.540\nachieve accreditation at\nany Lifecycle test okay?\n\n190\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.610\nIf English is not your first language\nyou are allowed a paper dictionary.\n\n191\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:53.140\nBut you will be asked to\nshow that to the proctor at\n\n192\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.650\nthe time that you take your test.\n\n193\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:00.610\nAnd as I've already said,\nyou have to have an ITIL foundation\n\n194\n00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.780\nin version three or version three, 2011.\n\n195\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:09.310\nOr an ITIL version two foundation bridge,\nto version three.\n\n196\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:15.450\nI will be very very honest with you,\nthere are not that many people that have\n\n197\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.580\nattained the version two\nto version three bridge.\n\n198\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.890\nAnd most people will have\nthe version three, or\n\n199\n00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.800\n2011, sorry, ideal foundation certificate.\n\n200\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.730\nYou will be required to\nupload that certificate to\n\n201\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.510\nthe examining board prior to\nsitting your Lifecycle test.\n\n202\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.430\nSo be prepared with that.\n\n203\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.590\nYou will need to have it to hand and\nsaved as a pdf as well.\n\n204\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:50.160\nSo when we come to the end of\nevery single lifecycle class,\n\n205\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.030\nwe will be going over and this one is no\nexception, we will be going over a sample\n\n206\n00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:59.670\ntest for you and during that sample test\nI will be giving you lots of hints and\n\n207\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.150\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n208\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.300\nAnd also how to ensure that you read\nthe full question how to relax and\n\n209\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.740\nto make sure that you approach\nit with an open mind.\n\n210\n00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.100\nBut you consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n211\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.610\nUltimately we wanna get you\npass the test just as much as\n\n212\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.760\nyou want to achieve that accreditation.\n\n213\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:31.550\nSo, just to sum up, what we will\nbe doing over the next few shows\n\n214\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:37.460\nis encouraging you to take your\nITIL Lifecycle Intermediate classes.\n\n215\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.685\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n216\n00:15:41.685 -->
