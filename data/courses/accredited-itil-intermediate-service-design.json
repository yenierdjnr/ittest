          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.040\nHi, and welcome to ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.210\nMy name is Jo Peacock and\n\n4\n00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.190\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL intermediate.\n\n5\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.710\nSo, let's take a look then,\nat our first slide here, coming up and\n\n6\n00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.840\nwe have our introduction to\nour intermediate class and\n\n7\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming intermediate class.\n\n8\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.340\nYou will see what we will cover\nis an introduction to the class,\n\n9\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.100\nfollowed by the principles and\nthe processes of the Life Cycle phase.\n\n10\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.240\nThen we'll take a look at organizing for\n\n11\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.500\nthat Life Cycle phase and\nalso the technology considerations,\n\n12\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270\nespecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n13\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.880\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand the critical success factors, and\n\n14\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.110\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith that particular lifecycle phase.\n\n15\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.850\nAnd most importantly, of course,\nfor you is that preparation for\n\n16\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.980\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class.\n\n17\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.670\nSo let me take a look now then at how\nwe're going to approach this particular\n\n18\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.790\nintermediate class.\n\n19\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work.\n\n20\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.550\nObviously, you're going to be watching us\non screen, both myself and my colleagues,\n\n21\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110\nand we're going to be taking you through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n22\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.910\nAnd then there are going\nto be some discussions and\n\n23\n00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.530\nsome exercises that are going to be\nbased primarily in our chat rooms,\n\n24\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.140\nand also in our forums as well.\n\n25\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.530\nAnd we're also available if you want\nto undertake any of the assessments,\n\n26\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.840\nthen please feel free to come\nback to us via the forums.\n\n27\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.270\nAnd we will be able to help\nyou out in anyway we can.\n\n28\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.130\nAlso provided in the course material,\nwhich is available for you to download,\n\n29\n00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.540\nare mock tests or\nexams if you prefer to use that word and\n\n30\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.720\nwe will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you.\n\n31\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.770\nSo where are we then at\nITIL intermediate level?\n\n32\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.590\nWell, you'll see in using\nBloom's Taxonomy that we are actually at\n\n33\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.090\nlevel 4, analyzing.\n\n34\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.806\nIn other words, at the foundation level,\nwe've done the remembering and\n\n35\n00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:24.660\nthe understanding of those concepts\nwithin ITIL, and we are actually moving\n\n36\n00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.160\nthrough applying those concepts\nto analyzing those concepts and\n\n37\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.240\nbeing able to apply the ITIL processes and\n\n38\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.130\nalso the concepts at a real world level,\nin a real world situation, okay.\n\n39\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.590\nSo where does ITIL come from then?\n\n40\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.080\nWell let me give you a little\nbit of a background.\n\n41\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.430\nIt's actually owned by\na company called Axelos and\n\n42\n00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.110\nit was first published in the mid\n1980s by the UK government.\n\n43\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.430\nAnd the office of government\ncommerce owned ITIL for a very,\n\n44\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.509\nvery long time and we developed ITIL\nright the way back to the 1980s.\n\n45\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.300\nThrough it's version two in the 1990s,\n\n46\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.820\nmid 1990s, to version three\nwhich was released in 2007 and\n\n47\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.920\nthere was an update to\nversion three in 2011.\n\n48\n00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.460\nWhich is exactly where we are right now,\nit is copyrighted,\n\n49\n00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.750\nis trade-mark protected, it's\na framework for managing services, and\n\n50\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.830\nthis, should you say flexible framework,\na framework that we would expect\n\n51\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.940\nany organization to adopt as a framework,\nbut then to adapt it to suit your needs.\n\n52\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.960\nitSMF was born right the way in the 1980s\nout of a desire to be able to demonstrate\n\n53\n00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.340\nvalue for money and efficiency for\nthe use of tax payers Money within the UK.\n\n54\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.650\nWay back in the 1980s,\nthese things started appearing on desks.\n\n55\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.880\nAnd quite frankly, we didn't know\nhow to manage these in an unbiased,\n\n56\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.360\nin an impartial, and\nin efficient and effective way.\n\n57\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.420\nAnd thus ITIL was born.\n\n58\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.110\nAnd ITIL was born from\na group of industry experts\n\n59\n00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.960\nthat went out into the big wide world and\nanalyzed various organizations.\n\n60\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.270\nFrom various different industry sectors,\nnot just government but\n\n61\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.690\nwe're talking finance,\nwe're talking retail, etc.\n\n62\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.230\nAnd they came back with\na set of best practices.\n\n63\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.380\nBest practices that they observed in the\nreal world for managing our IT services.\n\n64\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.220\nAnd thus we have ITIL.\n\n65\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.520\nAnd as I've already said,\nwe've had subsequent revisions.\n\n66\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.800\nAnd now we're up to versions 3 2011.\n\n67\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.240\nSo we work on the understanding that\nwe have a life to every single service.\n\n68\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.780\nAnd we start off with the concept and\nservice strategy, and then,\n\n69\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.600\nwe take that concept and\nwe design it, and then we develop it,\n\n70\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.360\nand we deploy it as a service\ninto a live environment,\n\n71\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.520\nwhich is where we operate and\nwhere we maintain it.\n\n72\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.345\nAnd we continually seek to ensure that we\n\n73\n00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:22.230\nare aligned with the needs\nof the organization in CSI.\n\n74\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.040\nSo, you're attending this class\nbecause you probably want\n\n75\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.040\nto achieve an ITIL\nintermediate qualification.\n\n76\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.920\nSo you can see that if we were\nto start off right at the very,\n\n77\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.280\nvery top, you'll see where I am.\n\n78\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n79\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.610\nI'm also a credited examiner and\nproctor or invigilator for\n\n80\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.020\nthese exams and work very, very closely\nwith the official ITIL accreditor and\n\n81\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.560\nalso Axelos who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n82\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.080\nNow in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n83\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.130\nWell, we start off with ITIL Foundation\nand ITIL Foundation would traditionally be\n\n84\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:20.020\na three-day classroom experience where\nwe learn the foundations of ITIL.\n\n85\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.640\nAnd we learned all the terminology and all\nof the definitions to that terminology.\n\n86\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.900\nThere's roughly around about 75 that we\nlearned within the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n87\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.530\nAnd then as we move through, we can either\ntake a ITIL partition class, which can be\n\n88\n00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.820\ntaken at any point in time throughout the\nprogression of your career within ITIL.\n\n89\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.220\nBecause ITIL practitioner focuses on\nthe implementation of ITIL, okay?\n\n90\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.960\nWhereas if we take a look at the more\nadvanced intermediate classes you are at\n\n91\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.040\nthis moment in a Lifecycle Module.\n\n92\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.720\nAnd those Lifecycles consist of\nservice strategy, service design,\n\n93\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.470\nservice transition, service operation,\nand continual service improvement.\n\n94\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.680\nAnd that's where we focus on those\nLifecycles that we've just looked at\n\n95\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.330\npreviously.\n\n96\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.630\nOkay.\nAnd on the right-hand side then,\n\n97\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.630\nwe have our Capability Modules, and\nthese Capability Modules really\n\n98\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:22.020\nfocus on specific areas\nwithin ITIL such as\n\n99\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.560\nRCV focuses on release control and\nvalidation.\n\n100\n00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.240\nAnd these classes,\nyou will notice that every single\n\n101\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.430\none of these classes has got\na skull right beside each one.\n\n102\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.229\nSo we go to number two for\nITIL Foundation and we've got a three for\n\n103\n00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:44.660\nLife Cycle modules, and we've got\na four for our capabilities modules.\n\n104\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.710\nNow, what we need to do is\nensure that we have achieved\n\n105\n00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:55.425\na minimum of fifteen credits\nat both either Lifecycle or\n\n106\n00:07:55.425 --> 00:08:00.555\nCapability module level in order\nto be able to qualify to sit\n\n107\n00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:04.165\nthe Managing Across\nthe Life Cycle class and\n\n108\n00:08:04.165 --> 00:08:08.665\ntherefore subsequently the test\nthat goes along with that class.\n\n109\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:11.995\nSo we need to take two\nfrom the ITIL foundation.\n\n110\n00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:13.065\nThat's a prerequisite.\n\n111\n00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:14.905\nWe have to do the foundation.\n\n112\n00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:19.500\nAnd then we need to add in\nanother 15 scores from either,\n\n113\n00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.890\nas I've said, the Life Cycle or\nthe Capability Stream.\n\n114\n00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.090\nYou can interchange.\n\n115\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.560\nYou can mix and match.\n\n116\n00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.100\nYou do not have to stick to one stream or\nthe other.\n\n117\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.055\nOnce you've got that 17 in total,\n\n118\n00:08:32.055 --> 00:08:37.165\nboth scores that are needed to be able\nto sit managing across the Lifecycle.\n\n119\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:41.345\nYou're perfectly able to sit\nthat Lifecycle class, and\n\n120\n00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.845\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n121\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.145\nAnd as soon as you've taken that test,\nyou will be awarded those five credits.\n\n122\n00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:52.535\nWhich will mean that you\nhave achieved ITL Expert.\n\n123\n00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:57.250\nNow ITL Expert is allocated\nas soon as you have Pass\n\n124\n00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.510\nthe management across the Lifecycle\ntest and have achieved 22 credits.\n\n125\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.770\nBoth of those must happen in order for\nyou to achieve ITIL expert.\n\n126\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.620\nNow we have the ITIL Master\nqualification and\n\n127\n00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.630\nthe ITIL Master is\na completely different beast.\n\n128\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.220\nThe ITIL Master is a two\nyear qualification.\n\n129\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.750\nAnd during that two years, you will be\nexpected to submit various white papers\n\n130\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.500\non specific topics within\nthe ideal qualifications scheme.\n\n131\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.870\nSo these could be topics\non activities within ITIL.\n\n132\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.830\nThese could be topics on\nprocesses within ITIL.\n\n133\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.870\nThese could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n134\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:51.410\nYou will be required to submit a number of\nwhite papers over the period of two years.\n\n135\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.520\nAt the end of those two years,\nonce you have submitted the prerequisite\n\n136\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers, then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n137\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.630\nAnd during that panel interview,\nyou will be assessed.\n\n138\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.930\nNot only on your white papers but\n\n139\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.631\nalso on your experience within\nthe IT service management arena.\n\n140\n00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:14.540\nAnd at the end of that\npanel interview then if\n\n141\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.020\nsuccessful you will be awarded\nto state of this ITIL master.\n\n142\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.810\nSo the qualification scheme, I'm going to\ntake this back now to Bloom's Taxonomy\n\n143\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.360\nthen and just very, very quickly look at\nthe fact that in ITIL Foundation, and\n\n144\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.992\nI know that I've already covered\nthis in a previous slide.\n\n145\n00:10:31.992 --> 00:10:36.700\nBut we've just looked at understanding,\nunderstanding the terminology and\n\n146\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.345\nthe concepts of ITIL foundation.\n\n147\n00:10:39.345 --> 00:10:41.340\nAnd then in the Lifecycle modules,\n\n148\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.700\nwe're looking at implementing\nthose processes contained within.\n\n149\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.990\nAnd then capability, we're looking at\nactually undertaking those processes and\n\n150\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.070\nmanaging those processes.\n\n151\n00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.890\nWith managing across the Lifecycle,\nthis is so senior management.\n\n152\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.090\nThis is that CIO level and\nit's senior management level.\n\n153\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.905\nAnd in MALC as we like\nto abbreviate it to,\n\n154\n00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:10.475\nyour concern with leading\nIT Service Management.\n\n155\n00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:15.385\nSo I mentioned right to the very beginning\nof all of this that we had a test\n\n156\n00:11:15.385 --> 00:11:20.735\nto go along with every single\nLifecycle phase and varies.\n\n157\n00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:25.865\nAnd we will be conducting a session to\ngo all over this particular test or\n\n158\n00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:30.530\nat least a sample of this test just\nto give you some preparation for\n\n159\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.960\nthe actual test itself.\n\n160\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.600\nSo, your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually.\n\n161\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.699\nIt is an eight multiple\nchoice question test.\n\n162\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.390\nIt's complex multiple choice.\n\n163\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.440\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test and\n\n164\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.640\nwith every single question,\nyou will be given a scenario.\n\n165\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.270\nAnd then you will be given\nfour possible options,\n\n166\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.730\nfour possible answers, for the question\nthat is posed along with that scenario.\n\n167\n00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.830\nYou get 5 points for the best fit answer.\n\n168\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.410\nNow it mentions up there,\nthe most correct.\n\n169\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.910\nI always call it the best fit\nbecause every single question asks\n\n170\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.300\nwhat is the best answer given\nthe scenario and given the question.\n\n171\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.350\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct\n\n172\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.540\nbecause the question is asking you for\n\n173\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.990\nthe best and for that best fit\nyou're going to get five points.\n\n174\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.130\nFor the next best fit you're\ngoing to get three, for\n\n175\n00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:41.410\nthe next one which we've considered to be\nthe least correct your going to get one.\n\n176\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.240\nAnd for the next one you're going\nto get zero now it mentions\n\n177\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.020\nup on that slide there that the next\none is zero marks for incorrect.\n\n178\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.310\nWe like to call that in the industry.\n\n179\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:13:00.600\nWe call that the distracter and we call it\ndistracter for a reason cuz it distracts.\n\n180\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.990\nAnd quite often is what you will find is\nwith your distracter a lot of the words\n\n181\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.599\nand the terminology that are taken\nstraight out of the ITIL book,\n\n182\n00:13:08.599 --> 00:13:13.580\nstraight out of the publication and\nare put into that 0 appointed.\n\n183\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.490\nBecause it's there to distract.\n\n184\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:21.250\nAnd it sounds great but more often than\nnot that distracter has absolutely\n\n185\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.600\nno relevance to the scenario or\nto the question.\n\n186\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.390\nSo you have to be incredibly\ncareful with that.\n\n187\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.480\nIt's so easy to be distracted.\n\n188\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.370\nYou have to get 28 out of a possible\n40 in order to be able to pass and\n\n189\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.540\nachieve accreditation at\nany Lifecycle test okay?\n\n190\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.610\nIf English is not your first language\nyou are allowed a paper dictionary.\n\n191\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:53.140\nBut you will be asked to\nshow that to the proctor at\n\n192\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.650\nthe time that you take your test.\n\n193\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:00.610\nAnd as I've already said,\nyou have to have an ITIL foundation\n\n194\n00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.780\nin version three or version three, 2011.\n\n195\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:09.310\nOr an ITIL version two foundation bridge,\nto version three.\n\n196\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:15.450\nI will be very very honest with you,\nthere are not that many people that have\n\n197\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.580\nattained the version two\nto version three bridge.\n\n198\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.890\nAnd most people will have\nthe version three, or\n\n199\n00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.800\n2011, sorry, ideal foundation certificate.\n\n200\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.730\nYou will be required to\nupload that certificate to\n\n201\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.510\nthe examining board prior to\nsitting your Lifecycle test.\n\n202\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.430\nSo be prepared with that.\n\n203\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.590\nYou will need to have it to hand and\nsaved as a pdf as well.\n\n204\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:50.160\nSo when we come to the end of\nevery single lifecycle class,\n\n205\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.030\nwe will be going over and this one is no\nexception, we will be going over a sample\n\n206\n00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:59.670\ntest for you and during that sample test\nI will be giving you lots of hints and\n\n207\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.150\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n208\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.300\nAnd also how to ensure that you read\nthe full question how to relax and\n\n209\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.740\nto make sure that you approach\nit with an open mind.\n\n210\n00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.100\nBut you consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n211\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.610\nUltimately we wanna get you\npass the test just as much as\n\n212\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.760\nyou want to achieve that accreditation.\n\n213\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:31.550\nSo, just to sum up, what we will\nbe doing over the next few shows\n\n214\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:37.460\nis encouraging you to take your\nITIL Lifecycle Intermediate classes.\n\n215\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.685\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n216\n00:15:41.685 -->

00:00:12.288\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.760\nYou're watching an ITIL Foundation\nRefresher for your intermediate class.\n\n6\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.900\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n7\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.390\nwe're about to get started here with\nour maestro in ITIL, Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.820\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.640\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.520\nPleased to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.260\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.190\n&gt;&gt; We are doing great today, Jo.\n\n13\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.030\nAs we begin, we understand that\nfoundations pretty much set the tone for\n\n14\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.570\neverything that we'll be\ntaking a look at here.\n\n15\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.840\nSo having this refresher at this\npoint in our class that we're doing\n\n16\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.790\nis gonna be a great opportunity for us to\nmake sure we cement those concepts down.\n\n17\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.790\nSo where are we gonna begin, Jo?\n\n18\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so what we're doing today in this\nparticular session is we're going to be\n\n19\n00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.530\ngoing over what everyone learned\nduring the ITIL foundation class.\n\n20\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.120\nYou see, we cover lots and lots of topics\nin every single intermediate class.\n\n21\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.990\nWhether it be the lifecycle classes,\nwhich the service operation is wide or\n\n22\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.690\nwhether it be the capability classes,\nsuch as release control validation etc.\n\n23\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.130\nOr even through to the A class for\nmanaging across the life cycle or\n\n24\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.430\nthe ITIL Practitioner Class.\n\n25\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.905\nWe need to understand that foundation\nmaterial because it's foundation and\n\n26\n00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:30.050\n[LAUGH] it is the foundation for\nall of our other material.\n\n27\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.890\nNow in our foundation quest in ITIL,\n\n28\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.510\nwe learn all of the terminologies\nthat is associated with ITIL, and\n\n29\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.610\nall of the 75 terms and\ndefinitions in the ITIL Foundation Class.\n\n30\n00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.010\nAnd I'll be honest with you,\n\n31\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.620\nsometimes the ITIL Foundation class\ncan be a little bit daunting.\n\n32\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.390\nCertainly the feedback that you get from a\nlot of delegates watching ITIL Foundation\n\n33\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.770\nis that they feel like their brains\nare full after the end of the first day.\n\n34\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.090\nSo what we're going to do really, and\nwe do this at the start of every single\n\n35\n00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.620\nintermediate class is we will just\ngo over the foundation principles\n\n36\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.850\njust to refresh them in everybody's mind,\nand then to act as a basis for\n\n37\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.520\nwhat we're going to cover\nover the following sessions.\n\n38\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.300\nAnd so here what we're going to\ndo over the next few sessions,\n\n39\n00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.350\nis we are going to go over\nthe ITIL foundation itself.\n\n40\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.660\nand we're going to go over the concept\nof the Life Cycle, etc and\n\n41\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.120\nwe're going to be going over,\nas I said, the foundation material.\n\n42\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.830\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Jo.\nThis is the best time to get started.\n\n43\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.440\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n44\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.000\nWhere are we beginning?\n\n45\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthe first thing that we're going to do,\n\n46\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.130\nand you saw this slide flash up very\nvery quickly on the screen there and\n\n47\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.930\nLet's take a look at that\nfirst particular slide there.\n\n48\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.830\nIt says here that ITIL is\npresented in 5 CORE volumes\n\n49\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.740\nthat are referred to as\na SERVICE LIFECYCLE.\n\n50\n00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.910\nLet's take a step back.\n\n51\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.460\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I want to do.\n\n52\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.990\nLet's just think about the fact\nthat a service, an IT service,\n\n53\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.450\nand we're gonna come in to\nthe definition of service very shortly.\n\n54\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.210\nBut a service, well it has a beginning and\nit has an end.\n\n55\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.410\nIt starts off as an idea.\n\n56\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.410\nThese things don't just happen.\n\n57\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.352\nYou don't just walk in and all of a sudden\neverything's there on your laptop okay.\n\n58\n00:03:20.352 --> 00:03:26.570\nAny new service well it has an idea and\nthat idea has to be developed.\n\n59\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.510\nis gotta be designed first of all, then it\ngets developed, and then it gets tested,\n\n60\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.010\nand then it gets deployed and\nthen it's put into the live environment.\n\n61\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.540\nAnd then we're continually checking\nthat service to make sure it's\n\n62\n00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.540\ndoing what it's supposed to do.\n\n63\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.510\nAnd eventually that\nservice will be retired.\n\n64\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.530\nSo we refer to that as\nthe life of a service.\n\n65\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.200\nAnd that’s the concept of the life cycle.\n\n66\n00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.280\nIs the fact that we understand the concept\nthat not just all about services but\n\n67\n00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.520\nalso IT as a whole.\n\n68\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.360\nWell, any process starts off as an idea,\nand\n\n69\n00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.160\nthen it's designed and then developed and\nthen built and then transitioned, and\n\n70\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.100\nput into the live environment, and\nthen we wanna continually improve it.\n\n71\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.660\nOkay?\n\n72\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.730\nAnd it's the same with any organization,\nand\n\n73\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.610\nwith any IT service provider,\nit starts off as an idea.\n\n74\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.210\nThings have to start off with a concept.\n\n75\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.700\nSo what we have is the concept\nof a service lifecycle and\n\n76\n00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.660\nwe've split it into five.\n\n77\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.560\nAnd in the first book, and\nwe call them core publications or books,\n\n78\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.640\nbecause there's a book for\neach life cycle phase.\n\n79\n00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.870\nAnd we start off with Service Strategy.\n\n80\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.570\nAnd then that's where our ideas\ncome from in service strategy.\n\n81\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.210\nThis is where we go back to the business\nand we understand what our business needs.\n\n82\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.880\nHow our business works and\nhow we can add value to our business.\n\n83\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.900\nAnd then in service design we then take\nthat idea that we've came out with\n\n84\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.770\nin service strategy and\nwe design that idea.\n\n85\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.440\nThis is not where we develop.\n\n86\n00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.750\nThis is where we design the idea.\n\n87\n00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.230\nAnd then in service transition this\nis where we do the development and\n\n88\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.850\nwe do the build and the test and\nthe deployment of our new services.\n\n89\n00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.660\nAnd then we deploy them into\nthe live service operation.\n\n90\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.520\nAnd then on a regular basis,\nwe want to continually improve.\n\n91\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.010\nSo while I'm looking at this\nnext slide and it'll show you\n\n92\n00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.940\nthe processes within the next slide, I\nwant to bring in another concept for you.\n\n93\n00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.200\nI want to take you just out of IT for\na moment.\n\n94\n00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.040\nBecause our service strategy I\nsaid we come up with the idea and\n\n95\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.280\nwe have processes and service strategy.\n\n96\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.390\nSuch as financial management and business\nrelationship management and strategy\n\n97\n00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.255\nmanagement where you know we come up with\nthose ideas to make sure we've got enough\n\n98\n00:05:48.255 --> 00:05:53.795\nmoney, and then this service design, we\nhave things like service level management\n\n99\n00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:57.635\nthat worked hard our targets for\nhow we're going to deliver that service.\n\n100\n00:05:57.635 --> 00:06:01.965\nSo this is still in design, and\nthen design, and availability, and\n\n101\n00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:05.235\ncapacity, and continuity, et cetera.\n\n102\n00:06:05.235 --> 00:06:07.995\nAnd we've got supply\nmanagement in there too.\n\n103\n00:06:07.995 --> 00:06:11.120\nNow, Let's take this out of IT as I said.\n\n104\n00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.320\nLet's say we were building a house.\n\n105\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.760\nNow I know, I've got grand ideas,\nI can tell you now.\n\n106\n00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.675\nI know that what I want is I want Say,\nfive bedroom?\n\n107\n00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.720\nYeah, I'll reckon that will be enough.\n\n108\n00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.735\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I want six bathrooms,\n\n109\n00:06:26.735 --> 00:06:29.775\ncuz I need one bathroom just for\nguests that are visiting for the day.\n\n110\n00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:34.205\nNot that anybody ever visits me, but\nnevertheless, I want six bathrooms, okay,\n\n111\n00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:40.760\nand I don't think I need a swimming pool,\nbut I wouldn't mind having a dedicated\n\n112\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.640\noffice just for me, that was sound proof,\nthat I could work in, that would be great.\n\n113\n00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.800\nThat's what I want.\n\n114\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.630\nSo, what I do with service strategy,\nis I go to the bank and I say,\n\n115\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.560\ncan I have some money?\n\n116\n00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.580\nOkay?\nI've got this idea,\n\n117\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.480\ncan I have some money please?\n\n118\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.490\nAnd here's my idea.\n\n119\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.820\nAnd this is what happens in service\nstrategy and the end of service strategy\n\n120\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.000\nthe bank says, yeah, here you go, have\nfour or five hundred thousand dollars.\n\n121\n00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.220\nThere we go.\n\n122\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.150\nSo now what I do?\n\n123\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.770\nWhat do i do with that\n$500,000 do you reckon?\n\n124\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.200\n&gt;&gt; You thus take that money,\n\n125\n00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.970\nand you would either have it\ndesigned to be ready to build it.\n\n126\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now I go to an architect.\n\n127\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.780\nAnd so this is what's happening here in\nservice design is I go to an architect.\n\n128\n00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.940\nAnd I say,\nokay please can you design me a house?\n\n129\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.720\nThese are my prerequisites.\n\n130\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.440\nAnd generally, you know what?\n\n131\n00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.180\nI'm a customer.\n\n132\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.800\nI'm not a builder so\nI don't know anything about materials.\n\n133\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.470\nBut what I do know is that I've got\nsome very specific requirements.\n\n134\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.460\nAnd probably because\nI'm little bit strange.\n\n135\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.980\nVery incredibly specific.\n\n136\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.206\nSo i'm gonna go to him and I'm gonna\nsay to him I want five bedrooms, and\n\n137\n00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:54.572\nI want six bathrooms, and I want my\nown sorta sound proofed office where,\n\n138\n00:07:54.572 --> 00:07:57.460\nI still want a window in it,\nI like daylight, but\n\n139\n00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.020\nthen at the same time I don't\nwant any noise coming in.\n\n140\n00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.234\nAnd I want bathrooms and\nI wanna have marble in the bathrooms,\n\n141\n00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:09.077\nand This is everything that I want,\nand my kitchen.\n\n142\n00:08:09.077 --> 00:08:12.190\nI've gotta have one of those\nrefrigerators with the TV screen in it.\n\n143\n00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.360\nI'm telling you now it's\ngot to have one of those.\n\n144\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.454\nAnd I want a camera in every room.\n\n145\n00:08:17.454 --> 00:08:21.820\nAnd I want at least two\nmaybe three routers in them.\n\n146\n00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.870\nI want everything to be wireless and\nI want everything hidden in the walls.\n\n147\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.500\nI don't wanna see any of this technology.\n\n148\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.620\nI told you I was picky.\n\n149\n00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:34.120\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm\ngonna go to the architect and\n\n150\n00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.780\nI'm gonna tell him all of this.\n\n151\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.952\nAnd he is going to produce a blueprint.\n\n152\n00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:42.170\nBut here's something special\nabout that blueprint.\n\n153\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.500\nThat blueprint is not just\ngoing to be the plans,\n\n154\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.400\nthe two dimensional plans for that house.\n\n155\n00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.470\nWhat that architect is going to deliver me\n\n156\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.780\nis a three dimensional mock-up of what\nthat house is going to look like.\n\n157\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.180\nHe's going to include all of the plans for\nall of the plumbing, for\n\n158\n00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.430\nall of the electrics, for\nall of the IT wiring that I want.\n\n159\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:12.600\nHe's going to include all of the list\nof contractors that he's going to use,\n\n160\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.860\nthose suppliers.\n\n161\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.830\nHe's going to tell me exactly what tiles\nare going to be used in the bathroom.\n\n162\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.379\nHe's going to tell me\nexactly where he's going to\n\n163\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.720\npurchase all of the furniture from.\n\n164\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.670\nYeah, I didn't mention furniture, did I?\n\n165\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.170\nHe's gonna tell me where he's\ngonna purchase everything,\n\n166\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.830\neven the bed sheets and everything from.\n\n167\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.780\nHe's going to even tell me what color\nthe bed sheets are going to be.\n\n168\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.240\nThis is not just any blueprint.\n\n169\n00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.100\nThis is what I call, and what we call\nin ITIL, a service design package.\n\n170\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.070\nAnd that service design package\ncontains absolutely everything\n\n171\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.503\nthat's needed to build, and to test, and\n\n172\n00:09:53.503 --> 00:09:59.030\nto deploy, and then to run that house.\n\n173\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.680\nThat service design package even includes\nall of the instruction manuals for\n\n174\n00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.870\nall of the appliances and everything\nelse that I've got in that house.\n\n175\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.460\nThat's what's in that\nservice design package.\n\n176\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.710\nSo we think of it as\nan architect's blueprint, but\n\n177\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.790\nhere in ITIL we think of it\nas a service design package.\n\n178\n00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.030\nAnd this is why we've got all of\nthose processes in Service Design.\n\n179\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.840\nAnd then what happens is we hand\nthat over to Service Transition.\n\n180\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.350\nWe hand it over to the builder,\nto the contractors.\n\n181\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.890\nAnd we let them come and do their work.\n\n182\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.980\nAnd they do the build and the tests and\n\n183\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.116\ntake a look at all of\nthose processes in there.\n\n184\n00:10:33.116 --> 00:10:36.260\nThey understand with Asset and\nConfiguration Management\n\n185\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.895\nexactly what the wiring's going to look\nlike and how it's going to hang together.\n\n186\n00:10:39.895 --> 00:10:45.080\nCuz the last thing you need is me trying\nto put a TV up on that wall over there.\n\n187\n00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.416\nOr me asking for a TV on that wall up\nthere, and you can't because it's a solid\n\n188\n00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:53.237\nbrick wall, because I wanted it in brick,\nall the external walls.\n\n189\n00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:56.180\nAnd so the TV can't go on there,\nit's gotta go on that wall.\n\n190\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:56.710\nSo Asset and\n\n191\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.540\nConfiguration Management tells me how\neverything's going to hang together.\n\n192\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.260\nSo here in Service Transition,\nwe do all the build.\n\n193\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.118\nAnd at the end of Service Transition,\nwhat happens is,\n\n194\n00:11:08.118 --> 00:11:12.234\nI'm the customer, and\nsomebody hands over the keys to me.\n\n195\n00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:17.121\nAnd I walk in that house,\nand I open the refrigerator,\n\n196\n00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:21.180\nthe one that was designed\nin Service Design.\n\n197\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.250\nI get out that bottle of wine that\nwas designed in Service Design but\n\n198\n00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.380\nis being nicely chilled right now.\n\n199\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.832\nAnd I go to the cupboard in the kitchen\nwhere I said I wanted my glasses\n\n200\n00:11:31.832 --> 00:11:32.447\nto be kept.\n\n201\n00:11:32.447 --> 00:11:35.100\nAnd they've got the right\nglasses in the right cupboard.\n\n202\n00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.510\nAnd I take out a glass,\nand I pour my wine.\n\n203\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.210\nAnd I walk over to the couch that I\ntold Service Design that I wanted.\n\n204\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.910\nAnd sit in front of the tv\nwith my glass of wine.\n\n205\n00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.644\nAnd I pick up the controls because\nthe remote control are next to\n\n206\n00:11:49.644 --> 00:11:51.620\nthe instruction manual.\n\n207\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:57.650\nAnd I just sit back and I watch TV\nbecause all of my services are in place.\n\n208\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:03.125\nI've got my contracts in place with the TV\ncompany, and with the Internet, etc.\n\n209\n00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:06.362\nAnd so now I'm into what\nwe call Service Operation,\n\n210\n00:12:06.362 --> 00:12:09.270\nwhich is just business as usual.\n\n211\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.880\nAnd business as usual is where,\n\n212\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.580\nwell I just carry on living in\nmy house without any problems.\n\n213\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.440\nOkay that's not going to happen, right?\n\n214\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.130\nWe know that there\nare going to be problems.\n\n215\n00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.770\nAnd so during Service Operation,\n\n216\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.470\nthen I'm going to have systems that\nare going to monitor Internet usage.\n\n217\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:33.947\nAnd systems that are going to monitor\nwhat TV that I watch and I set DVRs, etc.\n\n218\n00:12:33.947 --> 00:12:37.395\nAnd then, if anything does go wrong,\nI've got contractors, etc,\n\n219\n00:12:37.395 --> 00:12:40.310\nthat I can call if anything\ngoes wrong in the house.\n\n220\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.480\nThat's incident and problem management.\n\n221\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.940\nI know who to call if I want something\nnew, if I want an upgrade for instance.\n\n222\n00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.660\nBut then,\nin Continual Service Improvement,\n\n223\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.720\nwe're continually assessing that,\nyou know what?\n\n224\n00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.790\nThe showers remain water tight,\n\n225\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.940\nthat the refrigerator is at\nthe right level of technology.\n\n226\n00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.035\nBecause I do like my toys [LAUGH].\n\n227\n00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:04.502\nAnd so we're continually\nimproving that house because,\n\n228\n00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:09.880\nlet's face it, you don't live with\nthe same decor for ten years, do you?\n\n229\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.650\nAnd this is what happens,\nso from an IT perspective,\n\n230\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.970\nService Strategy is where\nwe come up with the idea.\n\n231\n00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.590\nAnd when we go to the bank for money.\n\n232\n00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:23.320\nAnd Service Design is where we design\neverything including our testing,\n\n233\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.500\nour training, and\ndesign how we're going to operate.\n\n234\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.650\nIn Service Transition, we build it,\nwe test it, we deploy it.\n\n235\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.530\nAnd in operation, we manage those\nservice on an ongoing basis.\n\n236\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.810\nAnd in Continual Service Improvement,\nwe continue to ensure that\n\n237\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.210\nour services are aligned to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n238\n00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.980\nIn other words, that they're\nexactly what we want to see for\n\n239\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.320\nthe organization at that point in time.\n\n240\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.880\nBecause things change, needs change.\n\n241\n00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.460\nSo that's quite a lot there just\nto take in, just on one slide.\n\n242\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.008\nSo now we're gonna look\na little bit more in-depth.\n\n243\n00:14:05.008 --> 00:14:08.348\nAnd this is where I say sometimes\neverybody does need a refresher from\n\n244\n00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:11.690\nfoundation, because we've\ngot a lot to learn.\n\n245\n00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.450\nSo let's take a look then.\n\n246\n00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.190\nI talked about services and\nabout the idea of a service.\n\n247\n00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.250\nSo what is a service?\n\n248\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.570\nWell the definition of a service\nis up there in blue, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.317\nAnd the ITIL definition of\na service from the publications.\n\n250\n00:14:25.317 --> 00:14:30.533\nA service is a means of delivering value\nto customers by facilitating the outcomes\n\n251\n00:14:30.533 --> 00:14:35.460\nthat they want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n252\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.944\nSeems like a mouthful, doesn't it?\n\n253\n00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:40.072\nLet me break it down then, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:40.072 --> 00:14:42.770\nA service is a means of delivering value.\n\n255\n00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:48.004\nThat's the first challenge\ncuz value is perceived.\n\n256\n00:14:48.004 --> 00:14:55.334\nIf I was to go out and buy a car,\nwell Ronnie, let me me ask you a question.\n\n257\n00:14:55.334 --> 00:14:56.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you were to go out and\n\n258\n00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.160\nbuy a car right now,\n\n259\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.590\nbearing in mind that I'm looking\nat this definition of a service.\n\n260\n00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:09.950\nAnd a service is a means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating outcomes.\n\n261\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.247\nSo the outcome of a car that we wanna\nfacilitate is to get from A to B, right?\n\n262\n00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.242\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's the outcome.\n\n263\n00:15:15.242 --> 00:15:20.380\nSo if you were to go and buy car,\nwhat would you look for in a car?\n\n264\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.520\n&gt;&gt; If it's just to facilitate A to B?\n\n265\n00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.281\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n266\n00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:30.590\n&gt;&gt; It would probably be a very small and\neconomical car that's a manual driven car.\n\n267\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:37.280\n&gt;&gt; Right okay, you see whereas me,\nnow I come from Europe.\n\n268\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.260\nWe have roads with no speed limit on them.\n\n269\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.203\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n270\n00:15:40.203 --> 00:15:45.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, I want something quick,\nI want something that's going to handle,\n\n271\n00:15:45.665 --> 00:15:50.160\nI want something that's going\nto lose me my license, probably.\n\n272\n00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.058\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I want something that's,\n\n273\n00:15:53.058 --> 00:15:57.511\nI'm with you on the manual, yeah,\nso I can handle it round corners.\n\n274\n00:15:57.511 --> 00:16:01.056\nYeah, I'm gonna get myself\ninto trouble [LAUGH] But\n\n275\n00:16:01.056 --> 00:16:06.345\nultimately what I value is completely\ndifferent to what you value, right?\n\n276\n00:16:06.345 --> 00:16:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Given the limitation of what you said,\njust to get from A to B, yes.\n\n277\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.469\nBut if I wanted to take that car and\ndo other things with it,\n\n278\n00:16:12.469 --> 00:16:14.391\nI might have chosen the same thing.\n\n279\n00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:15.570\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n280\n00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.332\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n281\n00:16:17.332 --> 00:16:21.760\nI still like to get from A to B fast.\n\n282\n00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.010\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n\n283\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.580\n&gt;&gt; You see the thing is that we know the\noutcome that we want to facilitate, but\n\n284\n00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.640\nwe all have a different\nperception of value.\n\n285\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.102\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n286\n00:16:31.102 --> 00:16:35.620\n&gt;&gt; That's our first challenge, straight\naway, is a means of delivering value.\n\n287\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.550\nAnd you could say, okay then, we'll put\nthis in the business perspectives then.\n\n288\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.637\nActually that's not too bad, cuz everybody\nvalues the same thing in business.\n\n289\n00:16:43.637 --> 00:16:44.880\nThat's not true at all.\n\n290\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.984\nWhat desktop picture do you\nhave on your laptop sir?\n\n291\n00:16:49.984 --> 00:16:53.000\nIs it the one that your were given\nwhen you were first given that laptop?\n\n292\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.090\n&gt;&gt; Probably yes.\n\n293\n00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.199\n&gt;&gt; It is, right, okay.\n\n294\n00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:58.440\nI can tell you that this one isn't.\n\n295\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.378\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:01.659\n&gt;&gt; Because we all change it,\n\n297\n00:17:01.659 --> 00:17:03.560\nwe all customize our desktop.\n\n298\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.386\nAnd so to say, well that's okay,\n\n299\n00:17:05.386 --> 00:17:08.000\nin business we all value the same thing,\nwe don't.\n\n300\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.030\nWe don't.\nI take a look at my keyboard right now,\n\n301\n00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.190\nand my keyboard, even though we\nhave exactly the same laptop,\n\n302\n00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.160\nmy keyboard looks completely\ndifferent to yours.\n\n303\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.050\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n304\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Because we both value\nthe different things, okay?\n\n305\n00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.612\nYou like yours exactly how\nit came out of the box.\n\n306\n00:17:25.612 --> 00:17:29.048\nWhereas, I like mine completely different,\ncompletely different,\n\n307\n00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.174\nwe've gotta be a little bit colorful here.\n\n308\n00:17:31.174 --> 00:17:32.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n309\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:39.815\n&gt;&gt; So even in a business perspective,\nwe don't have the same concept of value.\n\n310\n00:17:39.815 --> 00:17:43.818\nWhat we can do though, we can understand\nthat we're delivering value to customers,\n\n311\n00:17:43.818 --> 00:17:46.090\nand that in itself can be a challenge,\nokay?\n\n312\n00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:52.522\nBecause a customer is somebody\nwho buys a service, not a user.\n\n313\n00:17:52.522 --> 00:17:55.330\nA user is somebody who uses a service.\n\n314\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.674\nSo let me ask you a question,\nI'm gonna ask you a lot of questions.\n\n315\n00:18:01.674 --> 00:18:03.770\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n&gt;&gt; When was the last time you went into\n\n316\n00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:09.350\na coffee shop and\nbought a drink for someone?\n\n317\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.260\n&gt;&gt; The last time,\nit was probably close to two years ago.\n\n318\n00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.664\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:18:13.664 --> 00:18:15.826\n&gt;&gt; So when you go into that coffee shop\n\n320\n00:18:15.826 --> 00:18:21.123\nand you buy somebody a drink, the person\nbehind the counter, are they interested in\n\n321\n00:18:21.123 --> 00:18:26.284\nwhat you value or are they interested in\nthat person that you bought the drink for?\n\n322\n00:18:26.284 --> 00:18:28.670\nDo they care whether they\nlike the drink or not?\n\n323\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.560\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that they would care,\nbut maybe they don't.\n\n324\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.300\nMaybe they just want to sell it.\n\n325\n00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, see, there's an assumption.\n\n326\n00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.816\nBecause you see,\nif you think about it from a user and\n\n327\n00:18:41.816 --> 00:18:43.980\ncustomer perspective, okay?\n\n328\n00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.300\nIf I take somebody into a coffee shop and\n\n329\n00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.870\nI buy them a drink,\nI expect that that coffee shop was\n\n330\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.760\nprobably only going to care about\ngetting that money out of me.\n\n331\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.204\nAnd not care about whether\nthe person I bought a drink for\n\n332\n00:18:58.204 --> 00:18:59.821\nis going to like it or not.\n\n333\n00:18:59.821 --> 00:19:03.020\nBut the simple fact is, that if\nthe person that I bought the drink for\n\n334\n00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.502\ndoesn't like it, then they're gonna\nturn around to me and say, right,\n\n335\n00:19:06.502 --> 00:19:09.474\nwe're not going back there again,\nI don't like that place.\n\n336\n00:19:09.474 --> 00:19:15.989\nSo users influence customer's decisions.\n\n337\n00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.922\nSo even though we want to\ndeliver value to customers,\n\n338\n00:19:18.922 --> 00:19:22.844\nwe're actually really concerned\nwith value perception of users too.\n\n339\n00:19:22.844 --> 00:19:25.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n340\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.850\n&gt;&gt; Because if that person that I\nbought a drink for didn't like it,\n\n341\n00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:35.340\nthen we're not going back there,\ncuz I don't wanna to listen to it.\n\n342\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.153\n[LAUGH] So yeah,\nwe're not going back there.\n\n343\n00:19:38.153 --> 00:19:41.020\nSo we talked then about\ndelivering value to customers,\n\n344\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:45.540\nnot forgetting owners, by facilitating\nthe outcomes that they want to achieve.\n\n345\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:50.090\nFacilitating the outcomes,\nwe cannot achieve their outcomes for them,\n\n346\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.410\nthey have gotta put some input into this.\n\n347\n00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.400\nSo we want to facilitate outcomes.\n\n348\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.250\nSo we're not going to type your emails for\nyou.\n\n349\n00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.670\nWe can't do that, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.950\nWhat we can do is, we can give you\nthe ability to send and receive email,\n\n351\n00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.936\nbut you've gotta type that out yourself.\n\n352\n00:20:05.936 --> 00:20:10.803\nAnd you've gotta send that email, and\nyou've gotta read the emails that come in.\n\n353\n00:20:10.803 --> 00:20:14.183\nSo we're gonna do all that for you, but\n\n354\n00:20:14.183 --> 00:20:18.487\nthen we want to facilitate\nthat outcome for you but\n\n355\n00:20:18.487 --> 00:20:23.330\nwithout transferring to you\nspecific costs and risks.\n\n356\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.996\nA service is made up of components.\n\n357\n00:20:25.996 --> 00:20:30.481\nAnd out of those components we consider\nthings like software, and hardware, and\n\n358\n00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:34.190\nenvironmental aspects, and\nthe people that support the service.\n\n359\n00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.680\nAnd the people that implement the service,\nand the infrastructure, and\n\n360\n00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.290\ndocumentation as well.\n\n361\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.059\nThese are all components of a service.\n\n362\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.706\nNow without any single one of those\ncomponents, that service would not exist.\n\n363\n00:20:46.706 --> 00:20:51.468\nBut if you consider that we would have\nto actually work out the specific\n\n364\n00:20:51.468 --> 00:20:56.392\ncost of each one of those components,\nto each individual customer, for\n\n365\n00:20:56.392 --> 00:21:00.235\neach individual service,\nthat's a lot of effort.\n\n366\n00:21:00.235 --> 00:21:00.831\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n367\n00:21:00.831 --> 00:21:04.031\nwe're not gonna transfer those\nspecific costs to you, we might charge\n\n368\n00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:07.455\nyou a nominal fee, but we're not gonna\ntransfer the specific costs to you.\n\n369\n00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:12.182\nAnd for the same reason, we're not\ngonna transfer specific risks to you.\n\n370\n00:21:12.182 --> 00:21:16.953\nIdeally, what we want to do is deliver\na service that's going to allow you to\n\n371\n00:21:16.953 --> 00:21:18.818\nimprove your performance and\n\n372\n00:21:18.818 --> 00:21:24.054\nreduce any constraints that you might\nfeel whilst achieving that outcome, okay?\n\n373\n00:21:24.054 --> 00:21:27.310\nAnd that outcome,\nbeing as it says there, the intended or\n\n374\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:33.180\nactual result of carrying out an activity,\nover on the right-hand side of that slide.\n\n375\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.390\nSo what about Service Management then?\n\n376\n00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:40.135\nWell, Service Management, which is ITIL\nis a framework for Service Management.\n\n377\n00:21:40.135 --> 00:21:46.254\nService Management is a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities for providing\n\n378\n00:21:46.254 --> 00:21:51.889\nvalue to customers in the form of goods or\nservices, as it says in the ITIL books.\n\n379\n00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:55.621\nNow it's a couple of words I\nwanna bring out there, and\n\n380\n00:21:55.621 --> 00:21:59.800\nthat is specialized,\norganizational capability.\n\n381\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.430\nAll right, three words, not a couple.\n\n382\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.115\nSo we've gotta have the specialism.\n\n383\n00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:09.530\nIn other words, we don't just need broad\nexperience, we need specialist experience.\n\n384\n00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.210\nWe also need to be organized.\n\n385\n00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.477\nYeah, if we're disorganized,\nif there's absolute chaos going on in our\n\n386\n00:22:17.477 --> 00:22:21.032\nIT organization, then unfortunately,\nit's not an IT organization.\n\n387\n00:22:21.032 --> 00:22:25.590\nIt's an IT disorganization, and\nwe're never gonna deliver value.\n\n388\n00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.837\nBut, we've gotta be capable, too.\n\n389\n00:22:28.837 --> 00:22:32.836\nYeah, we've gotta have the right\ncapabilities to be able to deliver those\n\n390\n00:22:32.836 --> 00:22:33.860\nservices, okay?\n\n391\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.690\nSo we've gotta take what we consider\nto be our assets, our resources and\n\n392\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.990\nour capabilities, and\n\n393\n00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:47.560\ntransform them into something that\nwill deliver valuable services.\n\n394\n00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.220\nOur tangible capabilities, our resources,\nare things that we can touch and feel.\n\n395\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.377\nSo it's things like our money,\nsomething tangible.\n\n396\n00:22:56.377 --> 00:23:00.660\nOur hardware is something tangible,\nour software is something tangible.\n\n397\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.570\nAnd people in terms of bums on\nseats are tangible as well.\n\n398\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.770\nThese are things that we can touch and\nfeel.\n\n399\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.930\nDon't go touching and\nfeeling people too much,\n\n400\n00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.893\nthough, we end up in court, all right?\n\n401\n00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:14.586\nJust a warning on that one.\n[LAUGH] And\n\n402\n00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:16.320\nthen we've got our capabilities too.\n\n403\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.110\nBecause we can't just have bums\non seats as we would call it,\n\n404\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.030\nthey've gotta have the right skills.\n\n405\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.170\nAnd so our capabilities encompass\nthings like intangible assets.\n\n406\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.450\nThings that we have to have that\nare an asset to the organization.\n\n407\n00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.470\nBut that are very,\nvery difficult to quantify,\n\n408\n00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.870\nsuch as experience,\nsuch as the way that we're organized.\n\n409\n00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.602\nEven who our management are.\n\n410\n00:23:38.602 --> 00:23:43.556\nIf our management are, how should I say,\nif they're disorganized themselves, or\n\n411\n00:23:43.556 --> 00:23:47.395\nperhaps we've got interpersonal\nconflict in some of our teams,\n\n412\n00:23:47.395 --> 00:23:52.040\nthen we're not going to be able to\ndeliver efficient and effective services.\n\n413\n00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.060\n[INAUDIBLE] Okay.\n\n414\n00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.287\nSo service management is\nall about implementing and\n\n415\n00:23:58.287 --> 00:24:01.090\nmanaging those quality service.\n\n416\n00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:06.970\nWe have to ensure that the customer\nreceives a service that they value and\n\n417\n00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.060\nthat it performs at\na level that they expect.\n\n418\n00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.620\nAnd to a cost that they expect too.\n\n419\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:21.180\nSo here we are then in IT and we are what\nis considered to be a service provider.\n\n420\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.270\nAnd we have three different\ntype of service provider.\n\n421\n00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:29.340\nWe have a service provider that\nis internal to the business unit.\n\n422\n00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:33.850\nWe have a service provider that\noperates in a shared services unit.\n\n423\n00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:37.980\nSo internal to the organization but\nserves many business units.\n\n424\n00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.980\nAnd then we have a type three as we call\nit which is an external service provider.\n\n425\n00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:48.180\nAnd that is somebody who is completely\nexternal outsourced we like to say okay,\n\n426\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.530\ncompletely external to the organization.\n\n427\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.640\nSo within our service\nprovider organization and\n\n428\n00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.380\nwithin our business we have\nwhat we call stakeholders.\n\n429\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:04.940\nA stakeholder is defined\nas any interested party.\n\n430\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.620\nNot just financial interest, biggest\nmistake that I think that we make here.\n\n431\n00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.320\nAlthough, I have to say that\nwe have had discussions in\n\n432\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.460\nother sessions about the new\nanswers between languages.\n\n433\n00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.400\nAnd there is an inference that stakeholder\nin certain cultures means that somebody\n\n434\n00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.500\nhas a financial interest but\nthat's not the case.\n\n435\n00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.130\nWe're talking about anybody\nthat's had an interest.\n\n436\n00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.684\nI hate to say this, but even my nosy\nneighbor is considered to be a stakeholder\n\n437\n00:25:37.684 --> 00:25:42.090\nin my life because she definitely has an\ninterest in [LAUGH] everything that we do.\n\n438\n00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.292\nSo we've got stakeholders\nwithin our internal\n\n439\n00:25:45.292 --> 00:25:47.860\nservice provider such as functions.\n\n440\n00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.910\nThese are groups of people.\n\n441\n00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.728\nWe'll talk a little bit more about\nthem and the groups and teams.\n\n442\n00:25:52.728 --> 00:25:57.434\nAnd we've got people outside of our\nservice provider organization such as\n\n443\n00:25:57.434 --> 00:26:00.480\ncustomers and users and our suppliers.\n\n444\n00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.240\nAnd they're all stakeholders too, okay.\n\n445\n00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.220\nSo a stakeholder is any interested party.\n\n446\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.860\nYou'll notice that what we're doing is\nwe're just going over a lot at the moment.\n\n447\n00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.080\nWe're going over a lot of the terms and\n\n448\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.020\nthe definitions that we\nlearned in foundation class.\n\n449\n00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.190\nHere's another term and definition\nthat we learned in foundation class.\n\n450\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.730\nIs the concept of both internal and\nexternal services.\n\n451\n00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:34.180\nAn internal service is a service that we\nprovide internally to our organization.\n\n452\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.610\nAnd an external service is a service\nthat we provide externally\n\n453\n00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.520\nto external customers.\n\n454\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.510\nSo an internal service would be\nsomething and I use examples like SAP or\n\n455\n00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.020\nour email service,\nis something internal to our organization.\n\n456\n00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.560\nBut then an external service is\nsomething that our customers use such as\n\n457\n00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.050\nwebsites for instance or\nexternal service catalogs.\n\n458\n00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:02.280\nIf we're in an industry where we are\nselling goods externally to our customers.\n\n459\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.080\nSo you will see here from this\nparticular slide that over on the left\n\n460\n00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.440\nhand side internal services\nare delivered to business units and\n\n461\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:17.140\nthey in turn use those to deliver\na service to external customers.\n\n462\n00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:22.070\nAnd then we have on the right hand side,\nwe have services like our Internet that\n\n463\n00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:26.490\nare delivered direct through\nto our external customers.\n\n464\n00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:32.990\nOkay, on the next slide, there's just\nreally a little bit of an example over\n\n465\n00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:40.110\ncore services, enabling services and\nenhancing services, okay?\n\n466\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.760\nWhich is just further\nclassification of our services.\n\n467\n00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.237\nTo be honest, we spread our services\ndown believe it or not and to those that\n\n468\n00:27:47.237 --> 00:27:52.298\nare core, those that are enabling services\nand those that are enhancing services.\n\n469\n00:27:52.298 --> 00:27:56.350\nNow, we've gotten pizza delivery example\nthere on the screen in front of you.\n\n470\n00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.520\nI wanna give you an IT example for\ninstance.\n\n471\n00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.770\nSo let's think about our email service.\n\n472\n00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:10.120\nSo the core service in an email service is\nthat ability to send and receive email.\n\n473\n00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.780\nOkay, that's our core service.\n\n474\n00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.585\nNow the enabling service is a service\nthat's a service in its own right but\n\n475\n00:28:17.585 --> 00:28:19.727\nthat underpins the core service.\n\n476\n00:28:19.727 --> 00:28:21.640\nAnd that would be our infrastructure.\n\n477\n00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.440\nIt's a service in its own right but\n\n478\n00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:28.590\nwithout it email is not going to\nbe able to be sent or received.\n\n479\n00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.960\nAnd then an enhancing\nservice is an optional extra.\n\n480\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.320\nSomething that we can do that maybe\nsets us apart from our competitors or\n\n481\n00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.440\nsomething we just choose to do.\n\n482\n00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.950\nIt's optional for our business.\n\n483\n00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.590\nAnd that would be something like\na shared calendar for instance okay.\n\n484\n00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:50.989\nSo something that is an optional extra,\nthat's our shared directory,\n\n485\n00:28:50.989 --> 00:28:55.600\nshared calendar is the [LAUGH]\nword I'm looking for.\n\n486\n00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.279\nSo these are our core and\nour enabling and our enhancing services.\n\n487\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.810\nNow I asked you about\nvalue a little earlier on.\n\n488\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.460\nAnd about what we see as value.\n\n489\n00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.984\nSo I'm just gonna wrap up this\nsection by going over a couple of\n\n490\n00:29:13.984 --> 00:29:17.469\nslides that look over\nthe definition of value.\n\n491\n00:29:17.469 --> 00:29:22.285\nNow you will see that in the bottom\nof this particular slide right in\n\n492\n00:29:22.285 --> 00:29:23.970\nfront of you now.\n\n493\n00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:30.260\nYou will see that the diagram that you\nsaw in your ITIL foundation class.\n\n494\n00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.590\nAnd that is that diagram that always\nlooks very, very complicated and\n\n495\n00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.250\neverybody always says to me,\nhow am I supposed to remember this.\n\n496\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.930\nWell, it's really easy because you\njust need to remember the concepts of\n\n497\n00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.300\nutility and warranty.\n\n498\n00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.960\nOkay, so the concept of utility is very,\n\n499\n00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.210\nvery simply does it do\nwhat it's supposed to do?\n\n500\n00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.580\nAnd that's its fitness for purpose.\n\n501\n00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.360\nDoes that service send and receive email?\n\n502\n00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.100\nYes, it does.\n\n503\n00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.080\nOkay, then it has utility.\n\n504\n00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.170\nYou can have a web based email service\nthat will do exactly that for you.\n\n505\n00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.570\nIt will deliver that email.\n\n506\n00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.446\nBut can I ask you,\nin a business perspective then Ronnie,\n\n507\n00:30:08.446 --> 00:30:13.600\nwould a web based email\ndeliver you levels of security\n\n508\n00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.640\nthat you would feel\ncomfortable with do you think?\n\n509\n00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.590\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily, especially if I'm\nactually using a public provider and\n\n510\n00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.360\nnot my own as far as a portal that allows\nme access just inside of my own network.\n\n511\n00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n512\n00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.960\nSo what you're saying is then in effect\n\n513\n00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.630\nis that that service provides\nutility which it does.\n\n514\n00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.860\nBut it doesn't provide warranty aspect.\n\n515\n00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.459\nAnd if we look at the warranty aspect,\n\n516\n00:30:42.459 --> 00:30:47.416\nyou will see that those warranty\naspects are availability, capacity,\n\n517\n00:30:47.416 --> 00:30:51.414\nsecurity, which is one that\nI mentioned and continuity.\n\n518\n00:30:51.414 --> 00:30:55.470\nAnd so both utility and\nwarranty have to exist in order for\n\n519\n00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.590\nus to perceive value, okay?\n\n520\n00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:01.520\nSo let's go through those\nwarranty aspects, okay?\n\n521\n00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.130\nIs their service available enough.\n\n522\n00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:09.860\nWell, okay, an Internet based web mail\nservice might be available enough.\n\n523\n00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.600\nBut does it have enough capacity?\n\n524\n00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:18.300\nGuarantee when you try and send some files\nit'll tell you that they're too big.\n\n525\n00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.670\nDoes it have continuity?\n\n526\n00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:23.410\nWell it might do but\nwe don't have any assurance of that.\n\n527\n00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:27.490\nAnd that's the key thing about\nwarranty is that we have assurance.\n\n528\n00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.340\nAnd we certainly don't have\nany assurance for security.\n\n529\n00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.430\nSo you see both utility and warranty\nneed to exist for us to perceive value.\n\n530\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:41.830\nIt's not just good enough for us to have a\nservice that does what it says on the can.\n\n531\n00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.775\nWe got to be able to use it as well.\n\n532\n00:31:45.035 --> 00:31:46.435\nAnd this next slide,\n\n533\n00:31:46.435 --> 00:31:51.095\nwhich is something that I'm going\nto use to wrap up this session.\n\n534\n00:31:51.095 --> 00:31:56.235\nIf you look, the utility effect\nin that bottom left hand corner\n\n535\n00:31:56.235 --> 00:32:01.035\nis all about increasing\nthe probability and\n\n536\n00:32:01.035 --> 00:32:05.450\nmaintaining that probability\nof that service working.\n\n537\n00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:06.530\nIn other words,\n\n538\n00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:11.560\nthat service will do what it says on\nthe can without a shadow of a doubt.\n\n539\n00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.960\nBut the warranty effect has to\nactually decrease variances,\n\n540\n00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:24.030\nand availability, and incapacity,\nand in continuity, and insecurity\n\n541\n00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:29.600\nbecause what we actually want to do is, we\nwant to ensure that we have all of those.\n\n542\n00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.690\nSo we want to decrease and\n\n543\n00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:37.980\nwe want to decrease the uncertainty\nof providing those aspects.\n\n544\n00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.520\nAs we've said,\nwe have got to have both utility and\n\n545\n00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.519\nwarranty in order for\nanyone to perceive value.\n\n546\n00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:50.694\nSo for now, we're going to wrap up\nthis particular session which is part\n\n547\n00:32:50.694 --> 00:32:54.954\none of our recap over ITIL foundation and\nin our next session.\n\n548\n00:32:54.954 --> 00:32:59.121\nWe're going to look further into our\nassets and into our resources and\n\n549\n00:32:59.121 --> 00:33:00.690\ncapabilities etc.\n\n550\n00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:05.460\nAnd we're also going to look at processes\nand we're going to look at roles and\n\n551\n00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:11.780\nwe're going to look at all of\nour responsibilities etc too.\n\n552\n00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.640\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you again for\n\n553\n00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.000\nhelping us out with this\npart of the refresher.\n\n554\n00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.890\nThere's a lot more for us to cover but\nthat means we're gonna go ahead and\n\n555\n00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.670\nend this episode then.\n\n556\n00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.960\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n557\n00:33:25.960 -->

00:00:08.286\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:12.510\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.687\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:20.520\nYou are watching the ITIL foundation\nrefresher for your intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.080\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and we're taking\na look at another foundation refresher,\n\n8\n00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.320\na part two to help us to round\nout those skills that we need.\n\n9\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.640\nAnd here to help us of course, is going\nto be our ITIL virtuoso, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.230\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.790\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.890\nHow are you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.407\nTaking look and\n\n15\n00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:44.453\nremembering all those different terms\nI've seen in the foundation and\n\n16\n00:00:44.453 --> 00:00:49.160\nnow getting those things kind of brought\nback up is really starting to help.\n\n17\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.240\nSo what do we actually have left to do?\n\n18\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.470\nWhere are we gonna begin?\n\n19\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.438\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, this foundation material\nthat we're recapping over this so\n\n20\n00:00:56.438 --> 00:00:57.989\nmuch information to absorb.\n\n21\n00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.280\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n22\n00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.008\n&gt;&gt; So much information and\ntrust me your not the only one\n\n23\n00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.084\nbecause we have delegates\nthat leave foundation class.\n\n24\n00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:11.591\nAnd the feedback that they'll\ngive you sometimes is that whoa,\n\n25\n00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:14.601\nit's just so much information to absorb.\n\n26\n00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:18.597\nAnd really is and the unfortunate thing\nis that we have to get it through\n\n27\n00:01:18.597 --> 00:01:23.000\nthe foundation, you have to understand\nall of the concepts in the foundation\n\n28\n00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.080\nto be able to then delve\ndeeper into the processes.\n\n29\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.640\nUntil we can understand really what\na process is or really what a functional\n\n30\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.060\narea is or what a role should do,\nthen it's difficult to apply that concept.\n\n31\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.960\nAnd so\nwhat we are learning here is concepts and\n\n32\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.916\nI will admit that there is a lot to learn.\n\n33\n00:01:41.916 --> 00:01:42.848\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:44.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, so\n\n35\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.030\njust take us a little bit through\nwhat we reviewed last time and\n\n36\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.750\nthen where we're going to\nbe heading out from there.\n\n37\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in part one we actually\nlooked at concept of a service and\n\n38\n00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.220\nthe concept of a service is.\n\n39\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.080\nA service is a means of delivering value\nby facilitating the outcomes that our\n\n40\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.730\ncustomers want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n41\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.440\nNow, value is perceived.\n\n42\n00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.880\nAs I mentioned we all have\na different perception of value and\n\n43\n00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.460\neven in a business environment,\nperceptions of value is still different.\n\n44\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.590\nNo matter how much we'd like to try and\n\n45\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.550\ndeliver a one size fits all approach\nto our services to our business.\n\n46\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.590\nWe can't do that because\nvalue is perceived.\n\n47\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.200\nSo we looked at that and we looked at the\nfact that service management which ITIL\n\n48\n00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.990\nis a framework is a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities for\n\n49\n00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.410\ndelivering value to customers in\nthe form of goods or services.\n\n50\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.634\nNow I know that I just rattled off two\ndescriptions, two definitions to you and\n\n51\n00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:49.324\nnow that's made me look like\na bit of a nerd [LAUGH].\n\n52\n00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:52.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm fully aware of that, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we also looked at the concept of\n\n54\n00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.290\nvalue being broken down into utility and\nwarranty, and\n\n55\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.570\nthe fact that it's not just about us\nbeing able to do what it says on the can.\n\n56\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.527\nWe've got to be able to send and receive\nemail but we've got to do it in a way that\n\n57\n00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:15.884\nwe can assure our customers of\nlevels of utility, and warranty, and\n\n58\n00:03:15.884 --> 00:03:20.419\navailability, and capacity, and\nservice continuity and security.\n\n59\n00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.914\nSo we've got to need both that utility and\nwarranty to be present in order for\n\n60\n00:03:24.914 --> 00:03:27.320\nthem to perceive value.\n\n61\n00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.300\nAnd so, in this particular section,\n\n62\n00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.860\nwe're gonna start off just by going\nover what our service assets were.\n\n63\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.580\nI mentioned them in very,\n\n64\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.300\nvery briefly in the last section about\ntangible and our intangible assets.\n\n65\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.390\nAnd how we use ours to\ndeliver our services.\n\n66\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.240\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n67\n00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.220\nSo let's go ahead and begin then.\n\n68\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.440\nSo where are we picking up from there.\n\n69\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.070\n&gt;&gt; So as I said,\nwe begin with our service assets.\n\n70\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.680\nSo and our assets are what we use but\nwithin our organization to\n\n71\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.090\ndeliver value by way of goods or\nservices, as we say.\n\n72\n00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.310\nAnd then as that is described there,\nyou've got some definitions there and\n\n73\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.540\nas that is described,\nthere's a resource or a capability.\n\n74\n00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.540\nAnd a resource is what we\nconsider to be a tangible asset,\n\n75\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.250\nsomething that you touch and feel.\n\n76\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.780\nSuch as, as mentioned there money,\nour infrastructure itself,\n\n77\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.960\nthe software that we have, the actual\ndata that we have, our hardware.\n\n78\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.650\nThese are tangible assets.\n\n79\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.750\nYou'll notice that people span\nboth capabilities and resources.\n\n80\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.030\nSo they are a tangible asset,\nsomething that you can touch and feel.\n\n81\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.808\nBut I gave you that warning\nin that first section.\n\n82\n00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:39.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't you do that to much [LAUGH].\n\n83\n00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:40.586\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n84\n00:04:40.586 --> 00:04:45.000\nthen people are also intangible assets.\n\n85\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.280\nAnd you know what?\n\n86\n00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.450\nUnder the intangible assets or soft assets\nas I mentioned there, are capabilities.\n\n87\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.240\nWe've got things like how we're managed,\nwho manages us?\n\n88\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.900\nWe've got the organization itself,\nhow well organized we are.\n\n89\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.679\nIf there's complete chaos going on,\n\n90\n00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:04.192\nthen we're never gonna be able to\ndeliver value to our customers, are we?\n\n91\n00:05:04.192 --> 00:05:07.820\nOur processes have to be efficient and\neffective.\n\n92\n00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.710\nAnd if our processes don't do\nwhat they're supposed to do and\n\n93\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.450\nthey're not efficient and\nthey're not effective, then you know what,\n\n94\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.170\nthey're not gonna deliver value\nto our business to our users.\n\n95\n00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.735\nAnd then our knowledge.\n\n96\n00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:24.160\nAnd underneath people,\nwe've got experience and skills too.\n\n97\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.175\nAnd knowledge can be quantified\nwhich should document our knowledge.\n\n98\n00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:34.105\nAnd then it becomes information that we\ncan put into our knowledge management\n\n99\n00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:34.705\nsystem.\n\n100\n00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:39.125\nSo our knowledge though,\nis also our experience and our skills.\n\n101\n00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.882\nAnd believe it or not our attitude.\n\n102\n00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:45.015\nAnd our attitude falls under our\nthese soft assets, the capabilities.\n\n103\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.275\nFill up morale.\n\n104\n00:05:47.275 --> 00:05:49.470\nI expect to see morale in there as well.\n\n105\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.920\nWhich is why as we've moved through\nthe service operation class,\n\n106\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.250\nyou'll see that we've put\na huge emphasis on people.\n\n107\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.786\nAnd on morale, and on attitudes, and\n\n108\n00:05:58.786 --> 00:06:04.431\non understanding sort of organizational\nchange management and the people aspect.\n\n109\n00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:08.690\nBecause our people are what's going\nto enable us to deliver value but\n\n110\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.958\nthey're also what's going to hinder\nus from delivering value too.\n\n111\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.296\nLook at our soft skills,\nlook at our capabilities there and\n\n112\n00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:19.306\nhow well we are organized.\n\n113\n00:06:19.306 --> 00:06:24.235\nWell, that is [INAUDIBLE] it might be\nyou might consider it to be driven by\n\n114\n00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:25.230\nmanagement.\n\n115\n00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.990\nCuz management set our\norganizational structures but\n\n116\n00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.020\nit's also driven by people too.\n\n117\n00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.950\nIt's to help collaborative they\nare within that organization.\n\n118\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.620\nAnd think about management.\n\n119\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.240\nI know, I asked you.\n\n120\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.570\nI put you on the spot last\ntime [LAUGH] didn't I Ronnie?\n\n121\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.820\nAnd I said to you, do you get along\nwith your managers all the time?\n\n122\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.080\nAnd the simple fact of the matter\nis that there are always going\n\n123\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.470\nto be interpersonal conflicts.\n\n124\n00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.700\nThere are always going to\nbe interpersonal issues.\n\n125\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.250\nAnd so we've got to accept that.\n\n126\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.951\nThat even if we've got good management and\n\n127\n00:06:56.951 --> 00:06:59.811\nthen they may be into\npersonal issues there.\n\n128\n00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:04.629\nAnd certainly, I know that we've all\nworked in environments where there\n\n129\n00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:07.280\nmaybe siloed mentality between teams.\n\n130\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.230\nAnd it doesn't matter how\ngood our processes are.\n\n131\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.730\nIf our people do not have\nthe right attitude or\n\n132\n00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.440\ndon't have the right experience to\nbe able to follow those processes.\n\n133\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.570\nThen they're never gonna be deliver value.\n\n134\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.040\nIt's really as simple as that.\n\n135\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.630\nSo people are very, very important\nto this incredibly important.\n\n136\n00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.240\nSo I mentioned processes,\nwell let's take a look at a process.\n\n137\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.920\nI have mentioned in other sessions\nthat we look at in service operation.\n\n138\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.520\nBut the process is a set\nof structured activities\n\n139\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.630\ndesigned to accomplish\na specific objective.\n\n140\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.610\nAnd it takes an input and turns it into an\noutput and I think I remember I said that,\n\n141\n00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.410\nwe've had [LAUGH] that discussion before,\nokay.\n\n142\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.715\nSo we are looking to deliver value to our\n\n143\n00:07:53.715 --> 00:07:57.834\norganization by facilitating\ntheir outcomes.\n\n144\n00:07:57.834 --> 00:08:03.201\nWe can't achieve their outcomes for\nthem but we can facilitate.\n\n145\n00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:08.440\nSo we want to facilitate business\nprocesses which lead to business outcomes.\n\n146\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.920\nAnd we will use our processes in order\nto support the services that we deliver.\n\n147\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.620\nAnd exactly as it says on the next slide\nthere, supporting business processes.\n\n148\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.140\nSo we use our IT processes to\nsupport business processes.\n\n149\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.120\nNow processes have four characteristics,\nas they're written there.\n\n150\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.859\nA process has to be measurable.\n\n151\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.370\nI know that it's something that\nI've mentioned before, but\n\n152\n00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.520\nbecause I think so,\nit's not a good enough measurement, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.490\nWe have to have tangible metrics that\ntell us whether a process is delivering\n\n154\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.520\nvalue or not, whether the process\nis effective and efficient.\n\n155\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.730\nA process has to deliver\na specific result,\n\n156\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.099\nwe have to know what that process is\ndelivering, it has to be defined.\n\n157\n00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.250\nAnd it has to deliver that\nresult to a customer.\n\n158\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:04.180\nNow a customer or stakeholder,\nI like to use that word because sometimes\n\n159\n00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.290\nit's not always our customers that\nare raising particular processes or\n\n160\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.460\nthat are triggering processes.\n\n161\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.790\nIf I think of incident management,\nwhich is the ability to restore service\n\n162\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.640\noperation, it's not always customers\nthat raise incidents, or users, but\n\n163\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.070\nit could be internal IT people as well.\n\n164\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.840\nSo I like to use the word\nstakeholder in there as well.\n\n165\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.580\nWe deliver the specific results\nto a customer or stakeholder.\n\n166\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.970\nBut more importantly, at the bottom there,\n\n167\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.250\nresponding to specific events,\nall processes have to start somewhere.\n\n168\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.580\nSomething's got to start them off, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.500\nSo we call that a trigger,\na trigger to a process.\n\n170\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.465\nNow this next diagram that's coming up,\nwe're gonna spend a little bit of time\n\n171\n00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:51.514\non this because I absolutely\nlove this diagram.\n\n172\n00:09:51.514 --> 00:09:53.220\nI really, really do.\n\n173\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.365\nAnd yet everybody tells me when they\nlook at it they say, my goodness,\n\n174\n00:09:56.365 --> 00:09:57.655\nJo that looks so messy.\n\n175\n00:09:57.655 --> 00:09:58.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And yet it really,\n\n176\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.990\nreally explains what a process is.\n\n177\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.345\nNow I've mentioned that\na process will start off with,\n\n178\n00:10:05.345 --> 00:10:10.080\nwell, taking an input and\nturning it into a defined output.\n\n179\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.860\nOkay, so what we're going to do\nis we're going to start off with,\n\n180\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.970\nin the top right hand corner here, as you\ncan see my arrow, the process objectives.\n\n181\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.390\nAnd I am going to be using incident\nmanagement as an example here.\n\n182\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.460\nAnd the objective of incident\nmanagement is to restore\n\n183\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.660\nnormal service operation\nas quickly as possible.\n\n184\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.400\nSo that means then that\nthe process output then.\n\n185\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.610\nWhat do you think that is,\n\n186\n00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.650\nRonnie, if the objective is to\nrestore normal service operations?\n\n187\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.760\nWhat do you think the output\nto the process is?\n\n188\n00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.965\n&gt;&gt; Is that the process gets restored?\n\n189\n00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:48.471\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that the service gets restored.\n\n190\n00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:49.074\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the service gets restored.\n\n191\n00:10:49.074 --> 00:10:51.519\n&gt;&gt; So the output is a fixed service,\nit's been repaired.\n\n192\n00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.228\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sure.\n\n193\n00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:57.699\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if the output here in\nprocess output is something fixed.\n\n194\n00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.260\nThen what do you think the input is?\n\n195\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Something that is maybe not fixed?\n\n196\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.880\n&gt;&gt; Something broken.\n\n197\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.970\n&gt;&gt; Something broken [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n198\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.580\nSo what we do then, if you notice,\nokay we've got the first three steps of\n\n199\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.680\ndefining a process just\nworked out there and then.\n\n200\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.280\nSo we started off in this top right-hand\ncorner with our process objectives.\n\n201\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.021\nAnd then we looked at our process outputs,\nwhich was something broken, and\n\n202\n00:11:23.021 --> 00:11:25.418\nthe inputs, something fixed.\n\n203\n00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:30.140\nAnd here in this middle box, we've\ngot all of the actual process itself.\n\n204\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.845\nWe've got the activities and\nthe procedures and\n\n205\n00:11:33.845 --> 00:11:38.459\nthe work instructions that will\nget us from broken to fixed.\n\n206\n00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:40.560\nYeah, it will get us from here to here,\nokay?\n\n207\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.770\nWe also have identified here\nwhat we call process roles.\n\n208\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.757\nThese are what roles and\n\n209\n00:11:47.757 --> 00:11:53.420\nwhat skills we need in order to\nget us from broken to fixed.\n\n210\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.043\nWe also have process metrics and\n\n211\n00:11:56.043 --> 00:12:01.105\nthat will tell us whether we\nare getting from broken to fixed.\n\n212\n00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:05.800\nNow, we'll have a policy and here in\nthis process control box at the top,\n\n213\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.460\nwe've got this policy that\ntells us what our ethics are.\n\n214\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.070\nWhat our way of working is and\nhow we're going to do it.\n\n215\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.440\nBecause I've just mentioned\nincident management, but\n\n216\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.400\ndon't forget we do this for\nevery single process.\n\n217\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.450\nAnd we have a defined process owner,\nsomebody who takes\n\n218\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.020\nownership of that process, and\nwho ensures that process is documented.\n\n219\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.650\nNow I wanna bring you down to here\nwhere it says process improvement.\n\n220\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.760\nAnd notice that we have an arrow\ngoing directly from our output to\n\n221\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.370\nfeedback and\nthat's what we call our feedback loop.\n\n222\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:45.870\nAnd our feedback then comes down and\ncomes into process improvements.\n\n223\n00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.150\nIn other words, so\nwhen we restore service,\n\n224\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.910\nwe're going to conduct a survey,\nhopefully,\n\n225\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.370\nwith our customers to see whether they\nhave actually had their service restored.\n\n226\n00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.621\nAnd we'll also conduct a lessons learned,\nwhat worked well?\n\n227\n00:13:01.621 --> 00:13:06.010\nAnd we'll use that to improve\nour process in the future.\n\n228\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.410\nWe also conduct a lessons\nlearned with what didn't work so\n\n229\n00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.420\nwell too and we use that to\nimprove again in the future.\n\n230\n00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.400\nNow let's bring you down to this\nblue box at the bottom here.\n\n231\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.180\nAnd you will notice you'll see\ntwo familiar words in here.\n\n232\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.250\nThe words resources and capabilities.\n\n233\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.230\nSo these are the people and\nthe tools and the experience and\n\n234\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.860\nthe hardware and the PCs,\netc, that they use in\n\n235\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.080\norder to get us from something\nbroken to something fixed.\n\n236\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:42.220\nNow, there's one thing that I haven't\nmentioned, and that's this, the trigger.\n\n237\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.910\nAnd I said to you that here we go,\nthere's my arrow.\n\n238\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.050\nI said to you that every\nprocess has to have a trigger,\n\n239\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.520\nsomething that starts it off.\n\n240\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.320\nIncident management doesn't just happen,\nokay?\n\n241\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:59.468\nSo that trigger could be something like an\nevent that's occurred that's been notified\n\n242\n00:13:59.468 --> 00:14:05.294\nto us through event management, and\nthey've automatically raised an incident.\n\n243\n00:14:05.294 --> 00:14:08.850\nOr that trigger could be somebody\ncalling the service desk.\n\n244\n00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.860\nOr somebody picking up\ntheir cell phone and\n\n245\n00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:16.180\nlogging a call via the app\nto raise an incident, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.390\nThat's the trigger.\n\n247\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.480\nAnd all processes have to have a trigger.\n\n248\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.420\nAlthough some of those\ntriggers can be automated.\n\n249\n00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.450\nOkay, so a function, or\na functional area as we like to call it.\n\n250\n00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.074\nWell let's go back to that previous slide,\nokay?\n\n251\n00:14:30.074 --> 00:14:34.239\nIn that previous slide we had this blue\nbox, and that blue box represented\n\n252\n00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:38.620\nthe resources and the capabilities that\nwe needed to undertake the process.\n\n253\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.960\nWell, we have what we call teams\nof people, groups of people,\n\n254\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:50.750\nwe call them functions, and we use those\nfunctions to carry out those processes.\n\n255\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.920\nIn other words, that blue box represents\nthe role of our functional areas.\n\n256\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.470\nAnd we can structure our\nfunctions into groups, in teams,\n\n257\n00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.630\nin departments, in divisions.\n\n258\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.880\nWe can do whatever we want in regards to\nthe structure of our IT organization.\n\n259\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.080\nRemember, we've gotta deliver\nvalue to our organization, and\n\n260\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.810\nso it really is down to us.\n\n261\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.120\nHow we structure ourselves\nto deliver that value.\n\n262\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.260\nITIL is not a prescription.\n\n263\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.896\nIt's not a one-size-fits-all pill that's\ngoing to resolve any issues that you might\n\n264\n00:15:23.896 --> 00:15:24.945\nhave within IT, and\n\n265\n00:15:24.945 --> 00:15:28.680\nit's certainly not gonna tell you\nhow you need to structure yourself.\n\n266\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.494\nNow as we move through the other\nservice operation modules,\n\n267\n00:15:32.494 --> 00:15:36.460\nyou'll see that there\nare various ways to structure.\n\n268\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.650\nAnd if we go into service strategy and\n\n269\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.880\nlook through the service\nstrategy life cycle,\n\n270\n00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.640\nyou'll see that there is an evolution for\nthe structure of an IT organization.\n\n271\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.377\nAnd we certainly go into a lot more\ndepth of structures in the service\n\n272\n00:15:50.377 --> 00:15:52.881\nstrategy life cycle phase, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:56.951\nSo a function then is a group of\npeople and the tools that they use,\n\n274\n00:15:56.951 --> 00:15:59.110\nthe skills that they have.\n\n275\n00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.883\nI like to refer to them\nmore as functional areas.\n\n276\n00:16:01.883 --> 00:16:10.630\nBecause, as I said, we don't have\na prescriptive answer to your structure.\n\n277\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.810\nYour structure will be how you\nwant your structure to look.\n\n278\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.685\nSo within every single process,\nand I already mentioned and\n\n279\n00:16:19.685 --> 00:16:24.015\nI'm gonna jump back now to\nthis particular process model.\n\n280\n00:16:24.015 --> 00:16:27.000\nYou'll see that we have that\nred box at the top, and\n\n281\n00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.160\nthat red box is our process control.\n\n282\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.148\nAnd so with every single process we have\nin the top left hand corner a process\n\n283\n00:16:34.148 --> 00:16:34.710\nowner.\n\n284\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.945\nNow, if we were to use\nsomething called a RACI matrix,\n\n285\n00:16:39.945 --> 00:16:44.745\nwhich we cover in great depth in\nservice foundation itself, well,\n\n286\n00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:48.727\nyou'll see that we have\na role called accountability.\n\n287\n00:16:48.727 --> 00:16:53.750\nAnd accountability is where the buck\nstops, if we wanna use that saying, okay.\n\n288\n00:16:53.750 --> 00:17:01.630\nAccountable means somebody who takes\nownership Of a particular process and\n\n289\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.600\nensures that it's performed according to,\nnot just the document of processes,\n\n290\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.870\nbut also any service level\ntargets that may exist.\n\n291\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:14.940\nSo when you see the word accountable,\nI want you to use the word ensured\n\n292\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.350\nas part of that, sort of, relationship\nthat goes on in your mind, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.140\nSo accountable means ensured.\n\n294\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.800\nSo the process owner ensures that\nall of those bullet points happen.\n\n295\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.937\nHe takes accountability for ensuring\nthat all of those bullet points happen.\n\n296\n00:17:31.937 --> 00:17:38.251\nHe may delegate the responsibility\nto do that to the process manager,\n\n297\n00:17:38.251 --> 00:17:42.860\nbut the fact is that he\nensures that it happens.\n\n298\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.285\nHe doesn't necessarily\nhave to do it all himself.\n\n299\n00:17:47.285 --> 00:17:50.059\nNow the process manager\nis accountable for,\n\n300\n00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:53.760\nwell basically whatever\nthe process owner tells him.\n\n301\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.200\nBut, no,\nthe process manager is accountable for\n\n302\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.960\nthe day to day operations of the process.\n\n303\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.047\nSo if you look at the bullet points here,\nhe's reviewing KPIs.\n\n304\n00:18:03.047 --> 00:18:05.595\nHe's making sure everybody's\ngot the right skills.\n\n305\n00:18:05.595 --> 00:18:07.440\nHe's going to monitor on performance.\n\n306\n00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.240\nHe's going to make sure we've got enough\npeople to be able to perform the process,\n\n307\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.430\nand he's also going to be providing\nfeedback to the process owner.\n\n308\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.820\nSo the process owner is a figurehead,\nbut is also somebody who\n\n309\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.960\nensures that we've got the policies,\nthat we've got the right documentation.\n\n310\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.280\nHe takes accountability for publishing\nthe process, etc., and even improving it.\n\n311\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.070\nBut the process manager manages\nthe process on a day to day basis.\n\n312\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.099\nI want you to think about\nincident management againm and\n\n313\n00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.425\nI want you to think\nabout the service desk.\n\n314\n00:18:43.425 --> 00:18:44.795\nAnd what we may have,\n\n315\n00:18:44.795 --> 00:18:50.051\nespecially in a service desk where we have\nmultiple shifts, we will have a service\n\n316\n00:18:50.051 --> 00:18:55.190\ndesk manager who sits in an overall\naccountability for the service desk.\n\n317\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.350\nWe would consider them to be\nthe incident management process owner.\n\n318\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.790\nTakes ownership for\nthe entire service desk and\n\n319\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.130\ntherefore for incident management, period.\n\n320\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.940\nAnd then we've got the process manager,\nso think of these as your shift leaders.\n\n321\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.420\nOkay, your team leaders.\n\n322\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.780\nThey're the people that\nmanage the service desk and\n\n323\n00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.630\nmanage incident management\non that middle level, okay.\n\n324\n00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.340\nOn a day to day basis,\non a team by team basis.\n\n325\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.450\nAnd then we have what we call\nthe process practitioners, and for\n\n326\n00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.550\nincident management that would\nbe the service desk analyst.\n\n327\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.670\nAnd they are the people\nthat carry out one or\n\n328\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.260\nmore of those process activities\nworking with other stakeholders.\n\n329\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.650\nStakeholders, remember from a previous\nsession, is any interested party.\n\n330\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.640\nSo a stakeholder can be a user,\na customer.\n\n331\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.050\nIt could be your colleague.\n\n332\n00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.012\nIt could be somebody in a second level or\n\n333\n00:19:46.012 --> 00:19:49.780\nthird level support to you,\nsomebody that you escalate to.\n\n334\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:54.629\nOne thing that a process\npractitioner has to do though,\n\n335\n00:19:54.629 --> 00:20:01.869\na process practitioner has to ensure the\nprocess documentation is kept up to date.\n\n336\n00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:06.820\nAs we move into the actual processes\nwithin service operation, I've mentioned\n\n337\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.330\nthat in incident management,\nall incidents have to be logged.\n\n338\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.590\nAnd you know what, that is the\nresponsibility of the process practitioner\n\n339\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.930\nto ensure that all incidents are logged.\n\n340\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.150\nAnd that's not just for\nincident management, by the way.\n\n341\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.110\nThat's for every single process too.\n\n342\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.270\nThere has to be relevant documentation\nto ensure that the process is happening.\n\n343\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:33.573\nOtherwise, the process owner has\ngot absolutely nothing to go on.\n\n344\n00:20:33.573 --> 00:20:37.009\nAnd we're back to that,\nwell because I think so,\n\n345\n00:20:37.009 --> 00:20:42.600\nmetric, when somebody says, is\nthe process effective or is it efficient?\n\n346\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.190\nAnd because I think so\nis just not good enough.\n\n347\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.580\nSo let's move on from processes then.\n\n348\n00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.880\nAnd then just to wrap this session up,\n\n349\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.368\nlet's take a look at\nthe services themself, okay.\n\n350\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:59.950\nEvery single service must\nhave a service owner.\n\n351\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.980\nThat is a service owner within IT.\n\n352\n00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.630\nThere's an important\ndifferentiation there, okay.\n\n353\n00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.160\nAnd that service owner takes\naccountability for the entire IT service.\n\n354\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.830\nAs we move through into\nservice operation and\n\n355\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:21.130\nas we've looked previously at\nthe life cycle phases within ITIL,\n\n356\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.300\nyou'll see that there\nwere 20 odd processes.\n\n357\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.614\nWell, that service owner does not take\naccountability for all of those processes.\n\n358\n00:21:29.614 --> 00:21:33.390\nOkay, that service owner takes\naccountability for the service.\n\n359\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.220\nIn that diagram in the bottom\nright hand corner there,\n\n360\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:42.420\nyou will see that each process\napplies to each service.\n\n361\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.723\nSo if we looked to process one and we said\nthat that was incident management, well,\n\n362\n00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:49.616\nincident management applies\nto every single service.\n\n363\n00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:52.771\nAnd problem management applies\nto every single service, and\n\n364\n00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:55.980\nrequest fulfillment applies\nto every single service.\n\n365\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.517\nBut you will notice that each\nservice is separate, and so,\n\n366\n00:22:00.517 --> 00:22:05.889\neach service or each silo, as it is there,\nwill have a service owner.\n\n367\n00:22:05.889 --> 00:22:11.360\nAnd we use that word accountable again,\nand we use the word ensure, okay?\n\n368\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.060\nThey ensure that value is delivered\nto the organization, okay.\n\n369\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.350\nSo they'll liaise with the process owners,\nbut\n\n370\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.930\nthey'll liaise with business\nrelationship management.\n\n371\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.190\nThey will liaise with our organization,\nand\n\n372\n00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.440\nthey will be present in our\nservice review meetings,\n\n373\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.580\nwhich is where we review performance\nagainst those service level targets.\n\n374\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.500\nIn service level management and\nwith our customer as well, so\n\n375\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.170\nI expect the service owners\nto be present for that.\n\n376\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.510\nUltimately, the service owner takes\naccountability for a service.\n\n377\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.170\nSo in this particular section here then,\n\n378\n00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:54.250\nwell, in the last two sections we've\ndone a very, very brief overview of some\n\n379\n00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:59.199\nof the fundamentals that we learned\nwithin our ITIL foundation class.\n\n380\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:05.030\nNow, I do understand that there\nis a lot to learn there so\n\n381\n00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.730\nplease feel free to browse further\nthe ITIL foundation material\n\n382\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.300\nthat is available here through ITProTV.\n\n383\n00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.290\nBut what I would ask you\nto do now is obviously\n\n384\n00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.750\nto move into your service\noperation material and\n\n385\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.600\nto take a look at all of our\nother service operation modules.\n\n386\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well, thank you again\nfor helping us out and reminding us of\n\n387\n00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:31.740\nsome of those foundational concepts\nthat we may be a little bit weak on.\n\n388\n00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.850\nBut now with this refresher,\n\n389\n00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.440\nit means we're ready to head on\nto our ITIL intermediate show.\n\n390\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520\nWell, great place for us to sign off then.\n\n391\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.480\nFor ITProTV I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n392\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.680\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n393\n00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:49.062\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right now for\nyour ITIL intermediate introduction.\n\n394\n00:23:49.062 --> 00:23:54.270\n[MUSIC]\n\n395\n00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.665\nThank you for watching

00:00:06.311\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.311 --> 00:00:08.273\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:12.060\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.710\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL Intermediate\nSeries, I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.565\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ndown our Service Design track.\n\n8\n00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:24.725\nAnd specifically, we'll be taking a look\nat our objectives, scope, and value.\n\n9\n00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:28.440\nAnd we have Mrs. Jo Peacock back\nin studios to bring us the show.\n\n10\n00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.820\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.810\n&gt;&gt; I'm great, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.660\nHow are you, Cherokee?\n\n13\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.640\n&gt;&gt; I'm really excited, I've had my coffee.\n\n14\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.923\nAnd I would like to take\na look at what we're gonna\n\n15\n00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:40.056\nbe covering throughout\nService Design here.\n\n16\n00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:43.862\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well we're gonna start off right\nat the very beginning by looking at our\n\n17\n00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:45.430\nobjectives of Service Design.\n\n18\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.247\nThen we're gonna go into\nthe scope of Service Design.\n\n19\n00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.590\nWe're gonna look at\na value to the business.\n\n20\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.568\nAnd then a little bit later on,\n\n21\n00:00:52.568 --> 00:00:56.765\nwe're gonna have a sort of a part\ntwo to this particular episode.\n\n22\n00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:00.195\nAnd we're gonna then carry on and look\nat some of the functions and roles and\n\n23\n00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:02.550\nresponsibilities within Service Design,\nalso.\n\n24\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.470\nSo let's start off then right at\nthe very beginning understanding what\n\n25\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.690\nService Design is all about and\nlook at that purpose.\n\n26\n00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.260\nIts purpose is to design the services,\nto design the governing practices,\n\n27\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.580\nto design the processes,\nand design the policies.\n\n28\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.611\nAll of those that are gonna realize the\nstrategy, that thing that we just left,\n\n29\n00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:26.525\nwe just left Service Strategy.\n\n30\n00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:31.565\nWe want to realize that strategy now and\nturn it into a reality, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:34.915\nSo, it's not just about\ndesigning services.\n\n32\n00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:38.886\nThat's the most important thing to\ntake out from that particular purpose,\n\n33\n00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.345\nis it's not just about designing services.\n\n34\n00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:45.223\nIt's actually about designing the services\nand their supporting processes.\n\n35\n00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:48.083\nAnd all of the technology\nthat we will use,\n\n36\n00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:53.480\nhow we will measure the services and\nthe performance of those processes.\n\n37\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:01.220\nAnd also all of the people, the skills,\netc, that are needed to deliver and\n\n38\n00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.060\nto manage these services and to deliver\nthe processes and work with the processes.\n\n39\n00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.930\nSo it's absolutely everything.\n\n40\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.470\nOne of the first things that I want\nto mention is right at the very top,\n\n41\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.460\nthat first bullet point,\n\n42\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.090\ndesign services that are gonna have\nminimal improvement requirements.\n\n43\n00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.630\nDesign for the future,\nthere's a challenge, isn't it?\n\n44\n00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.500\nMinimal improvement requirements.\n\n45\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.250\nNow we know if we take a look at\ncontinual service improvement, and\n\n46\n00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.750\nwe looked at this in Foundation material.\n\n47\n00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.030\nSo right at the very start of our ITIL\njourney, we looked at ITIL Foundation.\n\n48\n00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.360\nAnd we know that we had\n\n49\n00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.435\ncontinual service improvement that\nlooked at all of our services and\n\n50\n00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:51.635\nall of our processes and\nall of our skills, all of our people.\n\n51\n00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:55.715\nAnd looked for opportunities and\nplaces where we could improve.\n\n52\n00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:59.001\nAnd now here I am as service design\nsaying that we should design for\n\n53\n00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:00.735\nminimal improvement.\n\n54\n00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:05.285\nWell, time kinda sounds conflicted,\nbut it's not.\n\n55\n00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.625\nIt's not really conflicting.\n\n56\n00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:10.140\nWhat I mean by mean by that\nis that when we design,\n\n57\n00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.220\nwe should design understanding\nthat things are gonna change.\n\n58\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.300\nWhich means that we should\nbe designing services and\n\n59\n00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.310\nwe should be designing processes that,\nnot that we don't want to improve, but\n\n60\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.450\nthat actually can accommodate\nimprovements easier.\n\n61\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.300\nSo when we talk about minimal\nimprovement requirements,\n\n62\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.560\nI'm not saying we wanna design it\nas best as we can right now, and\n\n63\n00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.470\nthen we never ever wanna\nimprove it in the future.\n\n64\n00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.370\nNo, we wanna design it as\nbest as we can right now,\n\n65\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.440\nbut we want to design it in\na way that it can be improved.\n\n66\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.080\nWe love modular design.\n\n67\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.400\nWe love being able to design individual\nmodules to be able to add on features\n\n68\n00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.520\nin a way that does not impact the core\nfunctionality of any service,\n\n69\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.760\nor the core functionality or\nactivities of any process.\n\n70\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.210\nSo let me think about, and\nI'm gonna be specific here,\n\n71\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.010\nlet me think about Microsoft Outlook.\n\n72\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.520\nAnd Microsoft Outlook is\na component of a service.\n\n73\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.831\nIt's the software component\nof our email service.\n\n74\n00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:20.784\nIf we want to improve that particular\nemail service, given that a service is\n\n75\n00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:24.555\na means of delivering value by\nfacilitating the outcomes that customers\n\n76\n00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:28.465\nwant to achieve without the ownership\nof specific cost and risks.\n\n77\n00:04:28.465 --> 00:04:34.700\nWell, if that's a service and we want to\ndesign that service to deliver value,\n\n78\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.150\nbut then we want design it in a way\nthat we can add in functionality.\n\n79\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.300\nWell, we're facilitating an outcome,\n\n80\n00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.980\nwhich means that we are facilitating\nthat ability to send and receive email.\n\n81\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.140\nSo how could we make an improvement\nwithout impacting that?\n\n82\n00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.090\nWell, quite simply,\n\n83\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.150\nwe can make an improvement like we can\nbring in shared calendars, for instance.\n\n84\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.650\nThat's an improvement.\n\n85\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.590\nSo we can bring in other\nimprovements in a modular way that\n\n86\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.720\nwill still improve the service,\nwill still add value to the service.\n\n87\n00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.420\nBut does not necessarily impact the core\nfunctionality of that particular service.\n\n88\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.449\nIn other words,\nthe outcome that it facilitates.\n\n89\n00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.260\nSure we can add in other\nadditional modules.\n\n90\n00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.440\nWe can add in other\nexcitement features as well.\n\n91\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.227\nWe can upgrade our existing and\nour current features\n\n92\n00:05:23.227 --> 00:05:28.122\nin a way that will improve\nour customer perception and\n\n93\n00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:31.075\nimprove the value perception.\n\n94\n00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:36.810\nWhat we're looking to do is we're\nlooking to improve with minimal work.\n\n95\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.550\nOr rather, minimal impact to\nour customer environment,\n\n96\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.560\nminimal negative impact,\nmaximum positive impact.\n\n97\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.110\nSo not necessarily minimal work, but\n\n98\n00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.210\nminimal work in terms of\nperception to our organization.\n\n99\n00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.540\nSo this is what design is about.\n\n100\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.570\nDesign is about designing services\nthat we can easily improve on.\n\n101\n00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.760\nIt's not just about not making\nimprovements, it's about easily improve.\n\n102\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.230\nAnd as it mentions there then\nin that second bullet point,\n\n103\n00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.240\nit's about embedding CSI\ninto all aspects of design.\n\n104\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.110\nSo if you read that first particular\nbullet point wrong then you could actually\n\n105\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.010\nagree that as being two\ncontradictory bullet points.\n\n106\n00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.290\nBut, the business trends that are going\nto offer up those design improvements,\n\n107\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.140\nthat's what we would be looking out for\nin the future.\n\n108\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.430\nSo after we've designed the service,\nwe wanna make sure that,\n\n109\n00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.600\nas I've already said, we design that\nservice that it can be improved so\n\n110\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.180\nthat business relationship management in\nService Strategy can identify the trends.\n\n111\n00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.040\nAnd that can help us\nwith those improvements.\n\n112\n00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.143\nSo Service Design is about\ndesigning innovative services\n\n113\n00:06:41.143 --> 00:06:45.961\nthat meet the need of the organization\nnow and in the future,\n\n114\n00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:49.757\naligning with our\norganization requirement.\n\n115\n00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:54.595\nI want to take us back to\nService Strategy for a moment.\n\n116\n00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:59.259\nAnd if you remember, in Service Strategy\nwe had three very high-level\n\n117\n00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.535\nstrategies that we looked at in\nregards to our organization, and\n\n118\n00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:06.120\nthen applying that to our IT services.\n\n119\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.849\nIn Service Strategy, we looked at\nthe strategies of running the business,\n\n120\n00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:12.725\nmaintaining the status quo,\ngrowing the business.\n\n121\n00:07:12.725 --> 00:07:17.760\nIn other words, a business that wants to\ngrow and that wants to increase profit.\n\n122\n00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.890\nAnd then transforming the business,\na business that wants to transform and\n\n123\n00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.740\nmove into other marketplaces,\nand other industry sectors.\n\n124\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.200\nHere in IT, we have to support\nthat business alignment.\n\n125\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.430\nWe have to be aligned in the business,\n\n126\n00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.160\nwe have to support the business vision,\nsorry.\n\n127\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.160\nSo, we have to make sure that we\nare as innovative as we need to be.\n\n128\n00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.849\nAnd where it mentions in that first bullet\npoint there, about innovative services,\n\n129\n00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:52.432\njust remember that in an organization\nthat is running the business,\n\n130\n00:07:52.432 --> 00:07:57.410\nas opposed to growing, that organization\nis less likely to want Proactive\n\n131\n00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.830\ninnovation than an organization\nthat is growing.\n\n132\n00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:06.612\nAn organization that is growing needs an\nIT team that is going to be innovative and\n\n133\n00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:11.910\nis going to recommend ways forward and\nhelp drive that strategy.\n\n134\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.800\nSo we have to align IT with\nthe business requirement.\n\n135\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.664\nBut of course, service strategy, our first\nlife cycle phase, the one before this,\n\n136\n00:08:21.664 --> 00:08:26.233\nthat will tell us what the strategy is and\nwhat the requirement is.\n\n137\n00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:30.238\nThe outcome from service design,\nas the life cycle phase,\n\n138\n00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:33.140\nis that service design package.\n\n139\n00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.604\nAnd we mentioned the service design\npackage in our ITIL foundation material.\n\n140\n00:08:36.604 --> 00:08:41.029\nAnd I want to refer you back to that for\nthe moment, but we're gonna spend some\n\n141\n00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:44.860\ntime looking at that in great\ndetail a little bit later on.\n\n142\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.610\nSo I'm not gonna go into too much\ndetail now except to say that\n\n143\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.100\nthat's the outcome from service design.\n\n144\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.940\nIt's a designed service.\n\n145\n00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:58.070\nAnd then we also have our\nservice design model.\n\n146\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.710\nAnd our service design model is\njust a model for how we will\n\n147\n00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:08.380\ndesign that particular service, and how\nwe will develop that particular service.\n\n148\n00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.370\nAs it says there, design and delivery\nare opposite sides of the same coin.\n\n149\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.010\nSo we design something\nbefore we develop it.\n\n150\n00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.761\nWe don't develop it on the fly.\n\n151\n00:09:20.117 --> 00:09:22.600\nI know a lot of developers\nthat will do that.\n\n152\n00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.321\nAnd what we're not trying to\ndo is say that Agile project\n\n153\n00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:32.349\nmanagement methodologies don't work,\nbecause they do.\n\n154\n00:09:32.349 --> 00:09:36.271\nBut what we're we're telling you is\nthat no matter what project management\n\n155\n00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:41.000\nmethodology you use, whether it's Agile,\nwhether it's PMP, whether it's Prince2.\n\n156\n00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.590\nIrrespective of the project\nmanagement methodology,\n\n157\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.230\nyou still need to design\nsomething before you build it.\n\n158\n00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.158\nYou can't just build it on the fly.\n\n159\n00:09:50.158 --> 00:09:53.678\nWe have to have that structure in place,\n\n160\n00:09:53.678 --> 00:09:59.260\nand we have to have a format for\nthe actual development.\n\n161\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.860\nYou don't just develop on the fly.\n\n162\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.367\nWe don't just develop\noff the top of our head,\n\n163\n00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:05.826\nbecause there'll be no consistency at all.\n\n164\n00:10:05.826 --> 00:10:08.140\nWe have to have\nthe relevant documentation.\n\n165\n00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.710\nAnd we have to know what we're designing\nand what we're developing, okay?\n\n166\n00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.760\nSo the design is driven not just\nby the functional requirements.\n\n167\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.270\nBut also by the business requirements and\nany design constraints.\n\n168\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.200\nSo we're gonna get into them in\na little bit more detail a little\n\n169\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.220\nbit later on as we get\ninto service design.\n\n170\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.780\nThere's a difference there though\nbetween functional requirements and\n\n171\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.160\nbusiness requirements.\n\n172\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.380\nAnd I just want to point that out.\n\n173\n00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.504\nYou see the business will tell you\nwhat outcome they want to facilitate.\n\n174\n00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:41.875\nThey'll tell you what outcome they need.\n\n175\n00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:45.738\nSo their outcome is the ability\nto send and receive email.\n\n176\n00:10:45.738 --> 00:10:48.870\nThat's got absolutely nothing to\ndo with a functional requirement\n\n177\n00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.790\nwhich is what we design.\n\n178\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.410\nWe have to understand the outcomes and\nthey need facilitating, but then we\n\n179\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.810\ndesign the functional requirements that's\ngoing to allow them to achieve that.\n\n180\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.700\nAnd those functional requirements,\nthink about sending and receiving email.\n\n181\n00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.939\nThink about the components\nthat are needed.\n\n182\n00:11:05.939 --> 00:11:09.770\nYou don't just need Outlook,\nyou also need Exchange Server.\n\n183\n00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.380\nYou also need to have PCs and laptops.\n\n184\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.450\nYou do need to have physical servers,\n\n185\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.680\nyou need to have an infrastructure and\na network.\n\n186\n00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.760\nYou need to have people to support it.\n\n187\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.110\nYou do need to have contracts in\nplace with external third parties for\n\n188\n00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.480\nyour network to get outside.\n\n189\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.970\nYour Internet provider,\nthey are functional requirements.\n\n190\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:35.366\nFunctional requirements also include\nthings like storage space and\n\n191\n00:11:35.366 --> 00:11:37.887\nmaybe archive policies, etc.\n\n192\n00:11:37.887 --> 00:11:39.770\nThese are your functional requirements.\n\n193\n00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.850\nWhat about backups?\n\n194\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.290\nAre we talking full backups or\nare we talking incremental backups?\n\n195\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.490\nAnd when do we take both?\n\n196\n00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.592\nAll of these are your functional\nrequirements completely different to\n\n197\n00:11:50.592 --> 00:11:55.036\nthe business requirements which is\nwhy they're mentioned differently, or\n\n198\n00:11:55.036 --> 00:11:56.487\nmentioned separately.\n\n199\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.420\nOne thing that,\n\n200\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.130\nthese are kind of just points that we need\nto note in this particular slide here,\n\n201\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:09.100\nthat not every single change within IT\nis going to require service design.\n\n202\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.790\nIf it's just a simple change,\n\n203\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:15.690\nwhere we're bringing in maybe a new\nversion of a piece of hardware,\n\n204\n00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:21.220\nthen if it's just a new mouse, then that\ndoesn't need to go through service design.\n\n205\n00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.370\nBut if we have to design\na complete new build for\n\n206\n00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.110\na laptop, then that will need\nto go through service design.\n\n207\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.040\nThink about scalability.\n\n208\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.600\nScalability is a word that\nI use a lot within ITIL.\n\n209\n00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.660\nYou've already heard me talk about\nscalability in service strategy.\n\n210\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.710\nAnd I'll talk about it throughout\ndesign and transition and\n\n211\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.950\noperations and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n212\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.270\nIn England, we have a saying, you don't\nuse a sledge hammer to crack a nut.\n\n213\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:54.669\nAnd that's exactly what we want you to\napply when you're implementing ITIL,\n\n214\n00:12:54.669 --> 00:12:57.850\nand when you're using any\nof these ITIL processes.\n\n215\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.540\nYou don't want bureaucratic processes.\n\n216\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.770\nYou don't want processes that\nare going to hinder an outcome.\n\n217\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.010\nYou need processes that are going\nto facilitate an outcome.\n\n218\n00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:15.660\nAnd therefore, you don't necessarily need\nto use design for every single change.\n\n219\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.910\nDesign, we're talking about new services.\n\n220\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.770\nWe're talking about changes\nto service level targets.\n\n221\n00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:26.320\nWe're talking about services that need\navailability plans and capacity plans, and\n\n222\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.610\nneed consideration for service continuity\nand consideration for security.\n\n223\n00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.510\nWhen I'm bringing in a new mouse,\nI don't need all of that.\n\n224\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.040\nI just need to know that\nit's going to work.\n\n225\n00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.458\nSo think about scalability.\n\n226\n00:13:42.458 --> 00:13:46.290\nAnd every organization's got to decide\nwhat needs to go through formal service\n\n227\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:51.070\ndesign and what can be managed\njust within change management.\n\n228\n00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.980\nBut every single change\nthat we have has got to be\n\n229\n00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.960\nassessed on their impact as it\nsays to service design activities.\n\n230\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.860\nSo we need to understand just\nexactly how big that change is and,\n\n231\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.051\nlike I said, scalability.\n\n232\n00:14:09.051 --> 00:14:13.754\nIf it's gonna have a huge impact\nin the live environment then we\n\n233\n00:14:13.754 --> 00:14:15.808\nneed to go through design.\n\n234\n00:14:15.808 --> 00:14:18.256\nIt's all about the value\nof service design then.\n\n235\n00:14:18.256 --> 00:14:22.830\nWell, these are what I call\nmy if we get it right slides.\n\n236\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.520\nIf we get it right,\nthen this is what we will deliver.\n\n237\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.630\nIf we get it right,\n\n238\n00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.710\nthen we design services that are aligned\nto the needs of the business.\n\n239\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.060\nIf we are efficient in our\nproject management and\n\n240\n00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.930\nin our design,\nthen we reduce total cost of ownership and\n\n241\n00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:44.010\nwe improve the quality of our services and\nthe consistency.\n\n242\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.630\nIf we get it right we can\nimprove our overall governance\n\n243\n00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.030\nbecause you see we can manage\nservices that we've designed.\n\n244\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.250\nIf we've never designed the service,\nthen how do we know what we're managing?\n\n245\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.738\nIf we get it right, we've got information.\n\n246\n00:14:59.738 --> 00:15:05.256\nWe can therefore make better decisions,\nif we get it right.\n\n247\n00:15:05.256 --> 00:15:09.606\nIf we get it wrong,\nwe don't achieve any of these.\n\n248\n00:15:09.606 --> 00:15:13.710\nSo we have to ensure that service design\nis performed in a consistent way.\n\n249\n00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.070\nAnd we will tell you,\nand I've already said,\n\n250\n00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:21.660\nwe don't care what project\nmanagement methodology you use.\n\n251\n00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.820\nWe'd just like you to use\na project management methodology.\n\n252\n00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.200\nWe have to be focused on the organization.\n\n253\n00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.980\nWe have to ensure that we're aligned\nwith our organization's goals and\n\n254\n00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.060\nwith our business goals.\n\n255\n00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.600\nWe've got to support them, as it says,\nsupporting corporate governance.\n\n256\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.910\nThink about our strategy,\nthink about running the business,\n\n257\n00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.370\ngrowing the business and\ntransforming the business.\n\n258\n00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:50.636\nWe have to support that,\nwhatever that strategy may be.\n\n259\n00:15:50.636 --> 00:15:54.295\nSo sometimes we might be creating\ncompetitive advantage and\n\n260\n00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:55.739\nother times we may not.\n\n261\n00:15:55.739 --> 00:16:01.394\nWe may just be Treading water,\nmaintaining the status quo.\n\n262\n00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:07.123\nIt's up to the organization, certainly\nafter periods of aggressive growth,\n\n263\n00:16:07.123 --> 00:16:12.423\nsome organizations require a year or\ntwo to just simply run the business,\n\n264\n00:16:12.423 --> 00:16:17.381\nto just embed that particular new\nmethodology, new way or working,\n\n265\n00:16:17.381 --> 00:16:19.110\nor new services, etc.\n\n266\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.999\nIt's not our role to dictate\nthe strategy of the organization.\n\n267\n00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:27.650\nIt's our role to ensure that we're\naligned with their strategy.\n\n268\n00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.910\nThat we're aligned with\nall of their needs,\n\n269\n00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:35.100\nincluding when it comes to things\nlike all of our data security, etc.\n\n270\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:41.330\nIf we have a competitive advantage, we\nwanna maintain that competitive advantage\n\n271\n00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:46.590\nand that means ensuring that we can,\nI don't like to use the word guarantee,\n\n272\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.660\nbut ensuring that we can protect\nthe CIA or the confidentiality,\n\n273\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.410\nthe integrity and the availability of all\nof our assets and all of our data as well.\n\n274\n00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:00.310\n&gt;&gt; At least, performing due diligence and\nmaking that dedicated attempt.\n\n275\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n276\n00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:01.977\nYeah, we've gotta be.\n\n277\n00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:06.767\nAnd even when we're in an organization\nwhere security is not a huge factor for\n\n278\n00:17:06.767 --> 00:17:11.264\nthem, we still have to recognize that\nevery single organization has got\n\n279\n00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:15.174\nproprietary information and\nhas got proprietary services and\n\n280\n00:17:15.174 --> 00:17:20.320\nsystems that they will not want getting\ninto the hands of their competitors.\n\n281\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.840\nSo even as a minimum,\nwe should ensure that all employees, and\n\n282\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.445\nthat all contract staff,\netc are able to sign\n\n283\n00:17:29.445 --> 00:17:34.495\nnon-disclosure agreements etc, to ensure\nthat we do protect that confidentiality,\n\n284\n00:17:34.495 --> 00:17:37.236\nthe integrity, and\nthe availability of our services.\n\n285\n00:17:37.236 --> 00:17:43.610\nAnd I say organization, I quite often\nsee organizations where contract staff\n\n286\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:49.120\nwithin IT are treated completely\ndifferently to permanent staff.\n\n287\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.630\nAnd then I see organizations\nwhere contract staff and\n\n288\n00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.800\npermanent staff nobody would ever\nknow the difference between them.\n\n289\n00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:03.530\nWe have to just question what the\nefficiencies are that you are looking for\n\n290\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.940\nin bringing in contract stuff,\nas opposed to permanent staff.\n\n291\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.011\nAnd understand what their roles and\nresponsibilities are.\n\n292\n00:18:10.011 --> 00:18:15.041\nAnd it's only then that you can\nmake the decision as to what levels\n\n293\n00:18:15.041 --> 00:18:20.173\nof security etc that you afford\ncertain people and certain staff.\n\n294\n00:18:20.173 --> 00:18:23.693\nUltimately you've gotta be aligned\nwith the business need and so\n\n295\n00:18:23.693 --> 00:18:27.981\nyou've got to make decisions that will\nalign you with what the business wants.\n\n296\n00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:32.226\nOur services and all of the people\nthat bought our services and\n\n297\n00:18:32.226 --> 00:18:36.877\nall of the processes that support\nthose services have got to achieve\n\n298\n00:18:36.877 --> 00:18:39.870\nabsolutely every single one of these.\n\n299\n00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.970\nWe've got to satisfy\nthe business objectives.\n\n300\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.270\nWe've got to be,\nI hate using the term future proof, but\n\n301\n00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.330\nwe've got to design for the future.\n\n302\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.540\nAnd this is where we get into the cliches\nand I absolutely hate using cliches, but\n\n303\n00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.250\nwe don't know anything about the future\nother than it's going to change.\n\n304\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.190\nAnd so in that respect then\nif we're designing for\n\n305\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.310\nthe future we're designing for\nchange, that's what we're doing.\n\n306\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.780\nSo we have to ensure that we\ndesign services that it says\n\n307\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.395\ncan be easily developed and\neasily at hand.\n\n308\n00:19:10.395 --> 00:19:11.029\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n309\n00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:13.500\n&gt;&gt; Because we design for change.\n\n310\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.640\n&gt;&gt; Like looking at things like\nany kind of data transmission.\n\n311\n00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.630\nWhat methodologies or\nmethods in order to do that?\n\n312\n00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.140\nWell we know has their recommendations for\ncabling standards,\n\n313\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.940\nso at that point in time\nthat's what's available.\n\n314\n00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.730\nWe're going to make our judgement calls,\nand\n\n315\n00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.160\nsay look this is the best\noption that we have currently.\n\n316\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:31.840\nBut who knows?\n\n317\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.495\nLike what if light bulbs are gonna be\ntransmitting Wi-fi or Li-fi in the future.\n\n318\n00:19:36.495 --> 00:19:39.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We just have to make that call.\n\n319\n00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n320\n00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.910\nWe've got to be aware of the future.\n\n321\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.092\nBut, let's face it, we don't\nreally know what the future holds.\n\n322\n00:19:47.092 --> 00:19:50.800\nI mean, many, many, well,\nnot that many years ago,\n\n323\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.280\nI would have considered in my own\npersonal life, not all that long ago,\n\n324\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:20:00.070\nI would consider why when every single\nroom in the house are with a network port.\n\n325\n00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.410\nNow would I do that?\n\n326\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.330\nAbsolutely not because we've got wi-fi.\n\n327\n00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.300\nAnd in fact, now we've got to the point\nwhere I have two routers installed in my\n\n328\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:13.320\nhome because I wanna make sure that\nyou know one's a secure router for me.\n\n329\n00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.990\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were gonna say two\nincoming lines for bandwidth saturation.\n\n330\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.855\nThat's a problem at my house.\n\n331\n00:20:18.855 --> 00:20:21.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, I'm quite lucky.\n\n332\n00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.350\nThere's only two,\nmaybe three of us in our house.\n\n333\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.915\nWe don't have that much of\nan issue at the moment.\n\n334\n00:20:26.915 --> 00:20:29.765\n[LAUGH] Other than the fact\nthat I have priority\n\n335\n00:20:29.765 --> 00:20:30.681\nover-\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n336\n00:20:30.681 --> 00:20:31.460\n&gt;&gt; -absolutely everything.\n\n337\n00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:37.510\nSo [LAUGH] so yes,\nwe don't need too much of that right now.\n\n338\n00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.510\nBut what we do know is\nthat our service provider\n\n339\n00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.400\nwill implement certain\nthings like hotspots, etc.\n\n340\n00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.737\nAnd so I will keep a router just for\na hotspot for other people to use, and\n\n341\n00:20:49.737 --> 00:20:52.933\nI keep a router that is\nperfectly secure just for me.\n\n342\n00:20:52.933 --> 00:20:56.527\nBecause as somebody who,\nwe all work from home now,\n\n343\n00:20:56.527 --> 00:21:01.110\nI want to ensure that the integrity\nof my transactions is assured.\n\n344\n00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:06.096\nAnd so we all know what we\nneed from our services.\n\n345\n00:21:06.096 --> 00:21:10.180\nAnd even on a personal level,\nwe design services that fit our need.\n\n346\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.680\nBut now we think about the future.\n\n347\n00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.010\nAnd we think about what could\nbe happening in the future.\n\n348\n00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.860\nAnd so we would never go out and\nbuy a router that just meets, or\n\n349\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.420\nrouter as you might call it,\nthat just meets our needs right now.\n\n350\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:28.280\nWe will now think about the future devices\nthat we're going to bring into our home.\n\n351\n00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.225\nI once did a calculation and my home is so\n\n352\n00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:37.046\nwi-fi enabled that I have over 30\ndevices that connect through my router.\n\n353\n00:21:39.242 --> 00:21:42.350\nAnd you think about this and\nthink how is that physically possible?\n\n354\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.441\nAnd then you think about all of\nthe devices that you have and\n\n355\n00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:45.772\nall of the technology that you have.\n\n356\n00:21:45.772 --> 00:21:46.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the IoT.\n\n357\n00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.700\nYeah.\n\n358\n00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.220\n&gt;&gt; My front door lock\nconnects through my router.\n\n359\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.065\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are your dogs connected to\n\n360\n00:21:53.065 --> 00:21:54.255\nthe internet?\n\n361\n00:21:54.255 --> 00:21:56.455\n&gt;&gt; Not quite.\n&gt;&gt; Not yet, they may be in the future.\n\n362\n00:21:56.455 --> 00:21:57.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they will be very, very soon.\n\n363\n00:21:57.735 --> 00:22:01.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we think about this and\n\n364\n00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.625\nwe have to design our services to\nbe future proof as much as we can.\n\n365\n00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:12.285\nAnd while we still got organizations\nin the world that do not use wi-fi.\n\n366\n00:22:12.285 --> 00:22:17.000\nA lot of government organizations we don't\nuse wireless at all, because quite simply,\n\n367\n00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.740\nit's just not safe to do so.\n\n368\n00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.070\nSo we're still using cables, but\n\n369\n00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.030\nwe still have to think about\nthe future and what that means.\n\n370\n00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.504\nYou wouldn't believe how many desktops\nare now produced without network cards\n\n371\n00:22:29.504 --> 00:22:30.045\nin them.\n\n372\n00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:35.409\nAnd yet who would think it, so of course,\n\n373\n00:22:35.409 --> 00:22:41.492\nthese particular hardware providers\nhave to still create network cards for\n\n374\n00:22:41.492 --> 00:22:47.780\ncertain organizations, because these\norganizations do not have wireless.\n\n375\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.230\nAnd yet we've all thought that we've moved\non from that, because things change.\n\n376\n00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.940\nAnd so we have to design,\nas we've said, for the future.\n\n377\n00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.640\nOne thing that I want to mention there,\nit's about halfway down,\n\n378\n00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.320\nit talks about appropriate measures and\nmetrics.\n\n379\n00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.474\nWe have to design our services so\nthat they can be measured.\n\n380\n00:23:08.474 --> 00:23:14.952\nAnd we have to be able to demonstrate that\nour services are providing value, and\n\n381\n00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:19.982\nthat our processes are actually\nunderpinning our services,\n\n382\n00:23:19.982 --> 00:23:26.572\nand that our processes are facilitating\nthe value provision of those services.\n\n383\n00:23:27.994 --> 00:23:31.700\nWe have to be able to demonstrate\nthe we're doing well.\n\n384\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.420\nIt's simple as that.\n\n385\n00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.730\nNow when it comes to measurements we can\nalso demonstrate that we're not doing so\n\n386\n00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:37.800\nwell as well.\n\n387\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.140\nYou know, we demonstrate\nthat we're doing poorly too.\n\n388\n00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.780\nBut we design our measurements and\nour metrics too.\n\n389\n00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:50.340\nSo we design what we're going to\nmeasure and how we're going to measure,\n\n390\n00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.520\nwhich means sometimes we have to design\nthe tools that underpin those services,\n\n391\n00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.340\ncuz those tools will help us measure and\nhelp us support.\n\n392\n00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.990\nWhat we really want to do ultimately,\nis as it says at the bottom there,\n\n393\n00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.460\ncontribute to the overall\nquality of those services.\n\n394\n00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.310\nNow I'm gonna leave it there for\nthis particular session.\n\n395\n00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.780\nThis is our foray into the meat and\n\n396\n00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.940\nbones of service design,\nafter we completed our foundation recap.\n\n397\n00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.140\nAnd so for this particular session,\nI'm going to leave it there.\n\n398\n00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.610\nAnd when we come back in part two,\nwe're going to be looking at functions.\n\n399\n00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.330\nAnd for those of you that\naren't aware of functions,\n\n400\n00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:35.340\nthen I would like you to go back\nto your foundation recaps that you\n\n401\n00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:40.380\ndid in the last episode and just\nrefresh your memory again on functions.\n\n402\n00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.990\nAnd we're going to be looking\nat those functional areas\n\n403\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.300\nin a little bit more depth\nin our following episode.\n\n404\n00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, so ladies and\ngentlemen you heard it.\n\n405\n00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.609\nJo said meat and bones,\nI might say meat and potatoes.\n\n406\n00:24:51.609 --> 00:24:52.523\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n407\n00:24:52.523 --> 00:24:54.486\neither way you look at it we've got\nsome great information headed your way.\n\n408\n00:24:54.486 --> 00:24:57.270\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n409\n00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.943\nRemember I've been your\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n410\n00:24:58.943 --> 00:25:00.150\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n411\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.631\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n412\n00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:08.389\n[MUSIC]\n\n413\n00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:11.591\n&gt;&gt; Thank

00:00:11.978\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.339\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nITIL Intermediate Series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.405\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:19.285\nWe are continuing our service\ndesign journey, and in this show,\n\n7\n00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.385\nwe'll be taking a look at our\nfunctions and organization.\n\n8\n00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:25.165\nAnd back in studios today,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:26.375\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.171\n&gt;&gt; I am absolutely fine,\nhow are you, Cherokee?\n\n11\n00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:29.715\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing excellent.\n\n12\n00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:33.755\nWe've been starting, we just took a look\nat our objectives and our values.\n\n13\n00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:36.879\nAnd what else, we see a scope.\n\n14\n00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.606\n&gt;&gt; No we didn't look at our\nscope in the last show.\n\n15\n00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:42.277\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n16\n00:00:42.277 --> 00:00:46.865\n&gt;&gt; We took a look at the value and we took\na look at the objectives of service design\n\n17\n00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:50.551\nand exactly what service design\nbrings to our organization.\n\n18\n00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.174\nAnd what we're going to do in this\nparticular section is we're going to look\n\n19\n00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:55.810\nat our functional areas.\n\n20\n00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.000\nAnd then we're going to look at how we\ncan be organized for service design.\n\n21\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.082\nAnd then in we're going to\nhave another show where we\n\n22\n00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:07.302\nare part three to this I guess\nwhere we just take a look at\n\n23\n00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:11.525\nsome of the documentation that's\nrequired in service design as well.\n\n24\n00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:13.225\n&gt;&gt; All right, great.\nI'm all about organization so\n\n25\n00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:14.015\nlet's get to it.\n\n26\n00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:17.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At least I try to be.\n\n27\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.572\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nShe totally likes it.\n\n28\n00:01:18.572 --> 00:01:20.014\n&gt;&gt; Let's be real here.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:21.774\nYou should try Z Organization, but.\n\n30\n00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:22.597\n&gt;&gt; Does it work?\n\n31\n00:01:22.597 --> 00:01:24.084\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n32\n00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.100\nOkay, well, let's, first of all,\ntake a look at our functional areas.\n\n33\n00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.870\nNow you will have all completed\nyour foundation recap.\n\n34\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.990\nYou may have even completed\nyour foundation, course,\n\n35\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.100\nyour foundation shows not too long ago.\n\n36\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.210\nSo just to refresh,\na function Is a group of people and\n\n37\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.210\nthe tools that they use in order to carry\nout one or more processes or activities.\n\n38\n00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.960\nI like to call it a functional area\nbecause we will not tell you within ITIL\n\n39\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.400\nhow to organize your IT functions,\nthat's just a hat that we all wear.\n\n40\n00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.550\nThat's the way I look at it, some people\nwear technical management hats and\n\n41\n00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.270\nthese are people that perform roles\nto do with our infrastructure.\n\n42\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.046\nAnd some people wear service desk helps,\nand\n\n43\n00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:19.443\nthese are people that perform roles\nto do with interaction with users.\n\n44\n00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:21.587\nSome people wear application hats and\n\n45\n00:02:21.587 --> 00:02:25.430\nthat's to do with roles to do\nwith software and applications.\n\n46\n00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.040\nAnd, of course, we've got our operations\npeople and they wear their own special\n\n47\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.870\nhat because they're managing\nthe business as usual, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.870\nSo these are what we call,\nwell we call them functional areas.\n\n49\n00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.466\nI like to call them hats.\n\n50\n00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:40.960\nDifferent people can wear\ndifferent colored hats or\n\n51\n00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.460\nthey can wear many hats\nall at the same time.\n\n52\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.480\nWe are simply referring to\nthe activities and the roles that\n\n53\n00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.570\norganisations will need to undertake\nin an IT service provider organisation.\n\n54\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.470\nWhat I do want to bring into the mix at\nthis point in time is the fact that some\n\n55\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.040\nof these roles, some of these functions\nand some of these hats can be outsourced.\n\n56\n00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.700\nThey don't have to be necessarily within\nour own service provider organizations.\n\n57\n00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.600\nThey can be outsourced.\n\n58\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.306\nSo I've already mentioned these\nparticular hats that people wear and\n\n59\n00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:17.639\nhere they are right in\nfront of us right now.\n\n60\n00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.540\nLet's think about our services then.\n\n61\n00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.490\nAnd our services are made up of,\nthis is what we're designing.\n\n62\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.220\nWe're designing our software and\nour hardware and our environment.\n\n63\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.197\nAnd we're designing all\nof the activities and\n\n64\n00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:32.181\nthe processes that our people perform,\netc.\n\n65\n00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:34.610\nAnd include in our infrastructure and\neverything.\n\n66\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.580\nWell If we take a look at the people\nthat we've got in front of us right now,\n\n67\n00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.250\nthese are our functional areas where\nall of their hats that they're wearing.\n\n68\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.954\nWell, technical management and\napplications management,\n\n69\n00:03:44.954 --> 00:03:47.452\nthese are the people that\nare actually doing the design.\n\n70\n00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:50.650\nAnd the development of the services.\n\n71\n00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.490\nTechnical management design in the\ninfrastructure they're designing some of\n\n72\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.240\nour environmental aspects and our\napplications management they're designing\n\n73\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.105\nthe software and they're also designing\nsome of the hardware that's required.\n\n74\n00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:08.465\nBecause you know when we bring\nin any new software, well\n\n75\n00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:11.575\nwhenever we bring in a service, there's\nalways a list of prerequisites, right?\n\n76\n00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:16.465\nThere's always a list of things that\nwe need for that particular software.\n\n77\n00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.305\nWe might need a minimum\noperating system or\n\n78\n00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:23.375\nwe might need a minimum number of memory,\nfor instance.\n\n79\n00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:28.570\nSo our application's guys are involved in\nthat design, so are our technical guys.\n\n80\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.881\nAnd our service desk are also involved in\nthe design too because our service desk\n\n81\n00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.147\nhave to support what's being designed.\n\n82\n00:04:35.147 --> 00:04:37.920\nThink about DevOps methodology.\n\n83\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.934\nAnd the DevOps methodology\nbrings our operations guys\n\n84\n00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:49.917\ninto our IT Development arena and,\nthat's why it's called dev ops right?\n\n85\n00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:54.337\nAnd then it takes our development guys and\nputs them into our operations area, so\n\n86\n00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:58.302\nthat they understand how to support\na service because after all they're\n\n87\n00:04:58.302 --> 00:05:01.180\ndeveloping a service to\nbe able to support it.\n\n88\n00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.900\nSo all of these guys are involved in\ndevelopment, so these applications guys,\n\n89\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.690\nthe technical guys as we say the service\ndesk guys, and don't forget operations.\n\n90\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.900\nOur operations team, they are the team\nthat are performing the job scheduling.\n\n91\n00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.560\nAnd they're running jobs maybe overnight,\nmaybe during the day.\n\n92\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.230\nThey're performing print management when\nwe have large scale printing involved.\n\n93\n00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.300\nSome organizations produce invoices\nevery month, for instance.\n\n94\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.500\nOur operations guys also will schedule and\nperform backups and restores, etc.\n\n95\n00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.930\nAgain, they have to be involved\nin the design of any service.\n\n96\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.420\nAnd then lets not forget about the fact\nthat these are the guys that are also\n\n97\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.470\nsupporting our existing services.\n\n98\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.310\nSo of course, these are the guys that\nare going to be able to ascertain\n\n99\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.550\nwhen a new design impacts\non our current environment.\n\n100\n00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.380\nSo these are the people that\nare actually performing service design.\n\n101\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.720\nWe don't define an ITIL\nany specific roles and\n\n102\n00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.320\nresponsibilities because roles and\nresponsibilities,\n\n103\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.910\nwell that's down to the individual\nservices themselves.\n\n104\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.600\nAnd we don't know what service you design\nso we can't design specific roles and\n\n105\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.500\nresponsibilities.\n\n106\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.850\nWe will tell you however that\nyou'll need to have these people,\n\n107\n00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.680\ncuz these are the people that are doing\nthe design and the development.\n\n108\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.970\nSo, application management,\njust to go a little bit further into\n\n109\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.020\nwhat I've already said, these are the\npeople who have actually performed all of\n\n110\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.270\nthe design and development with regards\nto our software and our applications.\n\n111\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.040\nAnd our technical management guys?\n\n112\n00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.684\nThese are the people that\nperform all of the design and\n\n113\n00:06:50.684 --> 00:06:53.650\nthe development in regards\nto our infrastructure.\n\n114\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.270\nSo the objectives of application\nmanagement, if you see there\n\n115\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.050\nought to help identify the functionality\nand manageability requirements and\n\n116\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.700\nperform the design and deployment and\ndevelopment as well of our applications.\n\n117\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.960\nAnd of course they then go on to\nsupports our applications as well, okay?\n\n118\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.860\nSo these are the people\nthat wear application hats.\n\n119\n00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.340\nThese are the people that\nwork with our software.\n\n120\n00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.353\nAnd you'll see underneath those bullet\npoints, they all relate to both\n\n121\n00:07:23.353 --> 00:07:27.250\nthe design, the development, and\nthe support of our applications.\n\n122\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.750\nNow, I want to bring in\nthe concept of the difference\n\n123\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.400\nbetween application management and\napplication development.\n\n124\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.600\nAnd as we move onto our next page,\nwhat you will see here, is a list\n\n125\n00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.810\nof the activities of both application\ndevelopment and application management.\n\n126\n00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:53.450\nApplication management, they will\nundertake the design of our application.\n\n127\n00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.509\nThey will undertake the support\nof our applications.\n\n128\n00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:09.040\nAnd they may decide to either buy\ncommercial off-the-shelf products.\n\n129\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:15.160\nOr they may decide to hand over\nthe application development in-house to\n\n130\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.659\ncreate a software solution that\nmeets the needs of the organization.\n\n131\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.200\nSo when we look at this particular\nworkflow what we're looking at is in\n\n132\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.640\nservice design we start off\nwith application management and\n\n133\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.210\nthen we make a decision.\n\n134\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.880\nDo we buy it off the shelf or\ndo we build in house.\n\n135\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.720\nIf we build in house we then hand\nover to application development.\n\n136\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.130\nAnd then at the end of development,\n\n137\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.100\nwe hand back to application management\nto manage the deployment, and\n\n138\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.250\nto then deploy and\ncarry on support in a live environment.\n\n139\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.080\nIf we don't build in-house,\n\n140\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.980\nthen application management manage\nthe relationship with the supplier\n\n141\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.930\nduring the development process, or during\nthe purchase process, should we say.\n\n142\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.380\nAnd then they take responsibility for\nthe deployment and\n\n143\n00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.350\nthen the subsequent support.\n\n144\n00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:16.300\nSo application development,\nthey're in house and they develop.\n\n145\n00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.634\nNow I'm going to add in a third layer\nof complexity here because application\n\n146\n00:09:20.634 --> 00:09:23.080\ndevelopment can also be outsourced.\n\n147\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.080\nSo we can get somebody external.\n\n148\n00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:33.540\nAn external third party to actually\ntailor make or create software for us.\n\n149\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.690\nThat would still be\napplication development but\n\n150\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.150\nthat would be outsourced\napplication development.\n\n151\n00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.870\nSo we've got three ways of sourcing\nour software for our services.\n\n152\n00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:49.110\nWe can buy commercially off the shelf,\ncots product.\n\n153\n00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.090\nWe can develop in house or\nwe can use a third party to develop.\n\n154\n00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.520\nAnd then application management will\nthen take over the deployment and\n\n155\n00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.800\nthe on going support of that software,\nokay?\n\n156\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.720\nSo, let's think about other roles that\nwe have within service design then and\n\n157\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.960\nas it says here,\na role is a set of responsibilities.\n\n158\n00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.790\nIt's something that we do.\n\n159\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.970\nAnd a role can exist\neither within a process or\n\n160\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:19.670\na role can exist within a particular\nservice or a functional area.\n\n161\n00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.640\nOkay, so\na role is just a set of responsibilities.\n\n162\n00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.197\nIt's something that we do.\n\n163\n00:10:24.197 --> 00:10:29.010\nAgain, what we're doing is just\nrecapping over our foundation material.\n\n164\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.090\nThink about scalability and\n\n165\n00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.180\nI've already mentioned this once\nin our episodes in service design.\n\n166\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.140\nI talked about this right the way\nthrough out service strategy.\n\n167\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.055\nAnd I will carry on\ntalking about scalability.\n\n168\n00:10:41.055 --> 00:10:44.532\nIn our remaining iTill intermediate,\n\n169\n00:10:44.532 --> 00:10:48.756\nwe don't want to bite off\nmore than we can chew.\n\n170\n00:10:48.756 --> 00:10:53.946\nOkay we don't wanna try and\nimplement absolutely everything.\n\n171\n00:10:53.946 --> 00:10:57.898\nAnd Cherokee is standing here laughing\nat me now because of the analogies\n\n172\n00:10:57.898 --> 00:10:58.559\nthat I use.\n\n173\n00:10:58.559 --> 00:10:59.351\nIt could be worse.\n\n174\n00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:01.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It could be a lot worse.\n\n175\n00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:02.103\n&gt;&gt; It really could.\n\n176\n00:11:02.103 --> 00:11:04.775\n&gt;&gt; It could yeah, what was the one\nthat you mentioned earlier on?\n\n177\n00:11:04.775 --> 00:11:07.302\nHow do we eat an elephant or something?\n\n178\n00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:11.878\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so we really, I don't eat, and\nyou don't eat an elephant but yeah,\n\n179\n00:11:11.878 --> 00:11:14.650\nwe can't be biting off\nmore than we can chew.\n\n180\n00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.949\nWe just do one bite at a time.\n\n181\n00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:19.665\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, I don't know how\nwe get into eating elephants.\n\n182\n00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:22.240\n&gt;&gt; I don't know where that\nsaying came from, either.\n\n183\n00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.304\nIt didn't come from us.\n\n184\n00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:26.117\nBut yeah,\nI guess we just regurgitated it to you.\n\n185\n00:11:26.117 --> 00:11:31.033\nSo now you can picture that every\ntime she says it, because that's.\n\n186\n00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:34.667\n[LAUGH] I think what started this whole\ntangent is she saw me cringe when she\n\n187\n00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:36.586\nsaid, bite off more than we can chew.\n\n188\n00:11:36.586 --> 00:11:37.835\nAnd I'm just think of.\n\n189\n00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:38.643\n&gt;&gt; Eating elephants.\n\n190\n00:11:38.643 --> 00:11:39.686\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n191\n00:11:39.686 --> 00:11:40.988\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyways,\n\n192\n00:11:40.988 --> 00:11:44.423\nlet's get back to what we were looking at.\n\n193\n00:11:44.423 --> 00:11:48.302\n[LAUGH] And we were thinking about\nimplementing and organizing for\n\n194\n00:11:48.302 --> 00:11:49.366\nservice design.\n\n195\n00:11:49.366 --> 00:11:50.956\nNothing to do with elephants whatsoever.\n\n196\n00:11:50.956 --> 00:11:54.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've never met an elephant in my entire\n\n197\n00:11:54.085 --> 00:11:57.463\ncareer in service management,\njust so you know.\n\n198\n00:11:57.463 --> 00:11:59.868\nWe're implementing service design here,\nand\n\n199\n00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:03.880\nwhat I want to tell you is you've\ngot to think about the scalability.\n\n200\n00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.900\nWe do not want over\nengineered processes for\n\n201\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.610\nabsolutely everything\nwithin service design.\n\n202\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.540\nIf you make something too bureaucratic and\n\n203\n00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.210\nit's over engineered then nobody's\ngoing to follow it anyway.\n\n204\n00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.350\nSo think about scalability.\n\n205\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.021\nThink about for small organizations.\n\n206\n00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:26.738\nThen we are going to have a service design\nmanager who is going to do do design\n\n207\n00:12:26.738 --> 00:12:27.567\ncoordination.\n\n208\n00:12:27.567 --> 00:12:31.492\nHe is going to be the process owner and\nprocess manager and practitioner for\n\n209\n00:12:31.492 --> 00:12:33.340\nall of design coordination.\n\n210\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.429\nHe's probably also going to be a service\nlevel manager across the board for\n\n211\n00:12:38.429 --> 00:12:40.056\nevery single service.\n\n212\n00:12:40.056 --> 00:12:42.383\nNow, if you wanna put that\nwithin a functional unit,\n\n213\n00:12:42.383 --> 00:12:44.120\nthen that's entirely up to you.\n\n214\n00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.940\nOr if you want to create a role\nof say a service level manager or\n\n215\n00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.435\na service design manager,\nthen again, that's up to you.\n\n216\n00:12:52.435 --> 00:12:55.465\nThis is not a one size fits\nall approach with ITIL.\n\n217\n00:12:55.465 --> 00:13:00.615\nYou have to decide what is more\nappropriate for your organization.\n\n218\n00:13:00.615 --> 00:13:03.525\nSo, here we have an example here and\nyou'll see that we\n\n219\n00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:08.455\nmight have a service design manager and he\nmight actually manage the project teams.\n\n220\n00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:11.326\nHe might manage an infrastructure team and\n\n221\n00:13:11.326 --> 00:13:14.842\nhe might manage the service\nlevel management team.\n\n222\n00:13:14.842 --> 00:13:19.260\nThat also encompass business\nrelationship management, might.\n\n223\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.510\nThe word example is at\nthe bottom of that screen and\n\n224\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.813\nthat is an example that is\nstraight out of our iTill books or\n\n225\n00:13:27.813 --> 00:13:33.435\niTill publications but it is an example,\nnothing more than that.\n\n226\n00:13:33.435 --> 00:13:37.495\nThere is no right or wrong way,\nwhat you need top do is ensure that you\n\n227\n00:13:37.495 --> 00:13:42.405\norganize to be efficient and\neffective within your organization.\n\n228\n00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:45.275\nSo, think about large organizations, well,\n\n229\n00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:48.660\nif we've got a large organization\nthat you might have.\n\n230\n00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.892\nAnd again this is might\nthis is just an example and\n\n231\n00:13:50.892 --> 00:13:53.430\nthe example that you've\ngot in front of you now.\n\n232\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.460\nYou might have a central team they\nmight be disparate though they might\n\n233\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.830\nbe in different locations where we've\ngot every single process with a defined\n\n234\n00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:08.140\nprocess owner as well as a process\nmanager as well as process practitioners.\n\n235\n00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:13.220\nYou might have a service management office\nand a program management office as well.\n\n236\n00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.140\nSo you might have program management to\nmanage projects and you might have service\n\n237\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:23.220\nmanagement to manage all the operational\nside of our IT services.\n\n238\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.463\nYou might, there is no right or\n\n239\n00:14:25.463 --> 00:14:29.700\nwrong you will decide in your\norganizational structure.\n\n240\n00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:35.750\nNow what I can tell you is that if\nyou go back to your service strategy\n\n241\n00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.957\nclass then you will see in\nthe service strategy episode.\n\n242\n00:14:40.957 --> 00:14:45.424\nWe had a couple of episodes in there\nthat looked at organization and\n\n243\n00:14:45.424 --> 00:14:50.470\nhow you would define organization for\nyour particular service provider.\n\n244\n00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.672\nThat's just a guide line.\n\n245\n00:14:52.672 --> 00:14:56.232\nIt's just there to help\nyou there is no right or\n\n246\n00:14:56.232 --> 00:15:01.870\nwrong as we say we organize for\nwhat is best for your business itself.\n\n247\n00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.365\nNot because we want to.\n\n248\n00:15:03.365 --> 00:15:07.482\nAnd let's think about what this large\nimplementation might look like what\n\n249\n00:15:07.482 --> 00:15:09.835\nthe large organization might look like and\n\n250\n00:15:09.835 --> 00:15:13.400\nhere we have exactly as we've\njust seen in that last slide.\n\n251\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.502\nWe've got a service management\noffice,we've got a project or\n\n252\n00:15:16.502 --> 00:15:19.502\nprogram management office,we've\ngot all the teams there.\n\n253\n00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:23.352\nAnd then we might have\nindividual support teams and\n\n254\n00:15:23.352 --> 00:15:28.368\nindividual project teams within\neach particular geographic area\n\n255\n00:15:28.368 --> 00:15:33.820\nin this particular example and\nagain, we use the words example.\n\n256\n00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.320\nNothing more than that.\n\n257\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.990\nSo I wanna leave that thought with you and\n\n258\n00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:43.190\nI want you to download the material that's\ncome along with this particular episode.\n\n259\n00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.100\nSo now we've taken a look at our\norganizational structures and\n\n260\n00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.820\nwe've looked at our and\nresponsibilities and our functional areas.\n\n261\n00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.618\nAnd we're going to take a break for\nthis particular episode and\n\n262\n00:15:53.618 --> 00:15:58.348\nwhen we come back in our following episode\nwe're going to look at our inputs and\n\n263\n00:15:58.348 --> 00:16:00.084\noutputs to service design.\n\n264\n00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:03.644\nAnd we are actually going to be looking\nat what we do within service design and\n\n265\n00:16:03.644 --> 00:16:06.120\nthe documentation that we produce.\n\n266\n00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.573\nSo for now, what I'd like you to do is I'd\nlike you to take a look at the available\n\n267\n00:16:10.573 --> 00:16:12.451\nmaterial that you can download.\n\n268\n00:16:12.451 --> 00:16:16.070\nAnd just recap over our\norganizational structures.\n\n269\n00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:20.840\nAnd if you have any questions then feel\nfree to contact me via the forum and\n\n270\n00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.760\nI will answer any queries\nthat you may have.\n\n271\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.600\n&gt;&gt; Except for\nany kind of elephant recipes,\n\n272\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.475\nwe are advising against that ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n273\n00:16:29.475 --> 00:16:32.880\nBut no, Jo, seriously thank you for\nyour input and your information.\n\n274\n00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.660\nWe appreciate it, as always,\nand you being here.\n\n275\n00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.360\nBut for this show, we are out of time.\n\n276\n00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.080\nSo we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n277\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.046\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n278\n00:16:41.046 --> 00:16:44.459\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock and looking forward\nto my elephant dinner this evening.\n\n279\n00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:46.594\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Have a great day.\n\n280\n00:16:46.594 --> 00:16:48.495\nSee you next time, bye.\n\n281\n00:16:48.495 --> 00:16:54.308\n[MUSIC]\n\n282\n00:16:54.308 -->

00:00:08.299\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.582\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:14.928\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode,\nright here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:18.175\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate Service Design show.\n\n7\n00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:20.900\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.550\nAnd today, we're taking a look\nat service design principles.\n\n9\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.440\nAnd here to help us again is gonna be\nwell, our ITIL master herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.810\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.300\n&gt;&gt; Thanks very much for having me, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.371\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:34.178\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, Jo.\n\n14\n00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:38.220\nNow, we wanna get into this\nidea of design principles.\n\n15\n00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.010\nAnd since I always misspell the word,\n\n16\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.020\nprinciples, you actually\nhave to help me out here.\n\n17\n00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.580\nWe're not really talking about the person\nthat's actually in charge of everything,\n\n18\n00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.440\nbut we're talking about\nsomething else now, right?\n\n19\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.100\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're talking about\nactually designing a new service.\n\n20\n00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.572\nWe're not talking about\na headmaster in school.\n\n21\n00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:55.818\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But it's okay,\n\n22\n00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:58.720\nif it's any consolation I\ncan never spell either.\n\n23\n00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.730\nBut that's just because of my lack of\neducation, nothing more than that,\n\n24\n00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.780\ndefinitely not confusion.\n\n25\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo when we start to\ntake a look at the idea of these design\n\n26\n00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.390\nprinciples itself, where is the best\nplace for us to get started so\n\n27\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.070\nthat we know that we're actually\nprogressing in the right place?\n\n28\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.888\n&gt;&gt; Well, I first of all want to\nmention one simple word, and\n\n29\n00:01:17.888 --> 00:01:22.063\nit's something that I want everybody to\nremember when we're designing a service,\n\n30\n00:01:22.063 --> 00:01:23.624\nand that is the word holistic.\n\n31\n00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:25.692\nThat's spell H-O-L.\n\n32\n00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:28.494\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know that the accents\n\n33\n00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:32.514\na little bit strange sometimes and\nI have had somebody say to me,\n\n34\n00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:34.090\ndo you really mean that?\n\n35\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.145\nNo, I mean holistic,\nI mean all encompassing.\n\n36\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.060\nWe look at the first slide here and\nwe talk about our 4 P's and\n\n37\n00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.540\nour 4 P's being people,\nprocess, products, and\n\n38\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.650\npartners but actually I just want\nto take that a little bit further.\n\n39\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.350\nLet's think about the components of\na service or our configuration items\n\n40\n00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.160\nas we call them when we look further at\nservice design, what makes up a service?\n\n41\n00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.730\nA service, of course,\n\n42\n00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.060\nis a means of delivering value by\nfacilitating the outcomes that\n\n43\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.110\ncustomers want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n44\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.380\nSo let's think of my service as\nthe ability to send and receive email.\n\n45\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.079\nWell, what do I need to do in order\nto be able to send and receive email?\n\n46\n00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.340\nOr rather, what do I need to have?\n\n47\n00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.430\nI need to have software.\n\n48\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.720\nAnd I need to have hardware.\n\n49\n00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.970\nAnd I need to have somewhere to\nsit while I'm sending that email.\n\n50\n00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.610\nI need to have somebody to support it for\nme.\n\n51\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.160\nI need to have a network.\n\n52\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.700\nAnd I need to have contracts and\ntargets in place in order for\n\n53\n00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.009\nme to be able do that.\n\n54\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.530\nIn other words,\nI've got to design all of those.\n\n55\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.970\nSo I talk about our 4 P's as being\nour four considerations, but\n\n56\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.410\nwe have to design absolutely everything.\n\n57\n00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.970\nAnd in ITIL terms, the word holistic means\nboth technical and non-technical aspects.\n\n58\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.770\nWe sometimes get bogged down\nin the technical aspects.\n\n59\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.400\nAnd we're thinking about bandwidth, and\n\n60\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.265\nwe're thinking about\nstorage of these emails.\n\n61\n00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:06.875\nWe're thinking about things like,\narchival sort of procedures,\n\n62\n00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.995\netc., and data retention policies.\n\n63\n00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:15.595\nWe're thinking about speed and the server\nand yet what we actually need to be\n\n64\n00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:20.705\nthinking about also, are things like the\nfact that I cannot stand outside the front\n\n65\n00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:26.080\nof the building without any power and\nsend and receive email for very long.\n\n66\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.900\nI need to have somewhere to sit.\n\n67\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.140\nI need to have electricity in order\nto be able to send and receive email.\n\n68\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.600\nI need to have a contract in place\nwith an Internet service provider\n\n69\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.420\nin order to be able to send and\nreceive email.\n\n70\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.600\nAnd I need to have somebody available\nat the other end of the phone or\n\n71\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.090\nthe other end of a message if I've\ngot something wrong with my email,\n\n72\n00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.260\nif something doesn't work when I\ntry to send and receive email.\n\n73\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.010\nSo, this is not just about having\na laptop, having a PC, and\n\n74\n00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.840\nhaving some software on it.\n\n75\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.810\nAll of these other elements have\nto come in to play as well.\n\n76\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.410\nAnd a lot of these are not\ntechnical element.\n\n77\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.641\nBut we still need to design them all.\n\n78\n00:04:04.641 --> 00:04:08.387\nWe still need to take all of these into\nconsideration when we're designing\n\n79\n00:04:08.387 --> 00:04:08.986\na service.\n\n80\n00:04:08.986 --> 00:04:12.576\nWhen we're designing any\naspect of any service, and\n\n81\n00:04:12.576 --> 00:04:16.403\nwe'll look at the aspects of\nthe service in a moment, but\n\n82\n00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:21.459\nwhen we design any aspect we need to\nconsider whose using that technology.\n\n83\n00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.386\nWhose going to be\nsupporting that technology?\n\n84\n00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:26.437\nWho are our partners?\n\n85\n00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:28.390\nWho are our suppliers?\n\n86\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.554\nAre they going to work with us?\n\n87\n00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:33.170\nAre they a true supplier, or\nare they more of a partner?\n\n88\n00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.200\nAre they working with us,\nor are they working for us?\n\n89\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.250\nAnd how do we manage them?\n\n90\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.170\nAnd what about the actual\ntechnical products that we use?\n\n91\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.000\nHow compatible are they with each other?\n\n92\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.160\nAnd when we're bringing in a new service,\n\n93\n00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.230\nit's got to fit on our\ncurrent infrastructure.\n\n94\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.340\nSo we have to think about\nall of that compatibility.\n\n95\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.260\nAnd also think about our processes too.\n\n96\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.710\nWhen we bring in a new service, we don't\ndesign new processes from scratch.\n\n97\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.944\nWe've already got a change\nmanagement process, or\n\n98\n00:05:02.944 --> 00:05:05.500\nwe've already got an incident\nmanagement process.\n\n99\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.560\nIt may be just simply that we just have\nto update our call logging system and\n\n100\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.860\nadd in that new service as a new\nservice in the call logging system\n\n101\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.300\nin that drop down field.\n\n102\n00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.140\nI can't tell you what you need, but\n\n103\n00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.330\nI can tell you that this is\nwhat you need to consider.\n\n104\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.510\nSo what is it that we actually design?\n\n105\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.080\nWell, we design the service itself.\n\n106\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.960\nThat's the software, and the hardware,\nand the environment, and the people, and\n\n107\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.350\nthe infrastructure, and the documentation.\n\n108\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.430\nBut then we also design our tools.\n\n109\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.168\nWhat we're going to use to\nsupport that new service.\n\n110\n00:05:39.168 --> 00:05:43.010\nSo our event management tools, the tools\nthat we're going to use to monitor\n\n111\n00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.740\nthings like backup, to monitor jobs that\nare running, and monitor when people have\n\n112\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.120\nlogged in and when people have logged out,\nand what licenses are being utilized, etc.\n\n113\n00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.930\nYou have to design also our\nincident management tools,\n\n114\n00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.100\nand our change management tools, and\nour configuration management tools.\n\n115\n00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.080\nAs well as we design both the technology\narchitecture, that's our infrastructure,\n\n116\n00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.930\nthat's our network topology.\n\n117\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.508\nBut we also have to design how\nwe're organized ourselves.\n\n118\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.670\nWhen I'm bringing a new service,\nsomebody's gotta support it.\n\n119\n00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.700\nAnd that person or people, well,\nthey might be part of a team and\n\n120\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.340\nthey've got to work for somebody.\n\n121\n00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.290\nAnd that person,\ndo they fit in application management or\n\n122\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.800\ndo they fit in technical management or\nare they in a bit of both?\n\n123\n00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.120\nAnd who do they work for?\n\n124\n00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.865\nSo think about an organization chart too.\n\n125\n00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:38.070\nAnd then, as I've already mentioned,\nwe've got to design processes.\n\n126\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.850\nAnd we never start off with a blank\npiece of paper, not anymore.\n\n127\n00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.890\nMaybe back in the 1980s we did,\nbut certainly not now.\n\n128\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.230\nAnd then think about how we're\ngoing to measure that new service.\n\n129\n00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.120\nThe end to end service metrics.\n\n130\n00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.730\nThe end to end service metrics include the\ntechnology and they include the processes.\n\n131\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.570\nIf I want to know how my\nservice availability is doing,\n\n132\n00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.190\nin other words, how long is my\nservice up for, how resilient is it?\n\n133\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.820\nOr rather, how reliable is it?\n\n134\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.815\nHow often does it break down?\n\n135\n00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:15.033\nThen I need to measure not only\nthe frequency of the incidents,\n\n136\n00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:17.422\nthe frequency of the failures, but\n\n137\n00:07:17.422 --> 00:07:22.210\nI also need to measure how long it\ntakes me to restore an incident.\n\n138\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.640\nSo that's that technology metric and the\nprocess metric on restoring that incident.\n\n139\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.210\nSo I need to measure\nmy end to end service.\n\n140\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:37.270\nAnd that includes my technology metrics,\nand it includes my process metrics too.\n\n141\n00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.910\nSo what about our plans, then?\n\n142\n00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.450\nWhat do we need to include?\n\n143\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.828\nNow, I've already mentioned\nin a previous section,\n\n144\n00:07:44.828 --> 00:07:46.648\nwe looked at our service design package.\n\n145\n00:07:46.648 --> 00:07:48.591\nAnd in our last episode, in fact,\n\n146\n00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:51.680\nwe looked more in depth at\nthe service design package.\n\n147\n00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.179\nTake a look at all of these.\n\n148\n00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:57.127\nAll of these need to be in\nour service design package.\n\n149\n00:07:57.127 --> 00:08:00.791\nAnd when it talks about at the bottom\nabout the production of the service design\n\n150\n00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:03.580\npackage, I expect it to\ninclude all of these.\n\n151\n00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.792\nAnd in our previous episode we also\nlooked at the service acceptance criteria\n\n152\n00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:08.321\nas well.\n\n153\n00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:13.233\nSo if you need more information about\nthose, then please feel free to go back\n\n154\n00:08:13.233 --> 00:08:18.550\nto that previous episode and Investigate\nthese in a little bit more depth.\n\n155\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.226\nBut all of these I expect to see\nin our service design package.\n\n156\n00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:26.995\nSo I need to ensure that we've\naccommodated all of these.\n\n157\n00:08:26.995 --> 00:08:31.077\nIncluding not just the technical\nimpact of that service, but\n\n158\n00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:34.937\nincluding the impact to our\nbusiness of this new service.\n\n159\n00:08:34.937 --> 00:08:37.848\nWhen we take a look at in\nservice transition, and\n\n160\n00:08:37.848 --> 00:08:42.676\nI will want you to take a look at service\ntransition to look at change management,\n\n161\n00:08:42.676 --> 00:08:45.024\nfor how we implement this new service.\n\n162\n00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:50.144\nBut you will see that one of the things\nthat I talk about in service transition\n\n163\n00:08:50.144 --> 00:08:55.024\nis ensuring that we have maximum\npositive impact on an organization when\n\n164\n00:08:55.024 --> 00:08:58.713\nwe implement anything with\nminimal negative impact.\n\n165\n00:08:58.713 --> 00:09:03.153\nWe also look at the emotional cycle\nof change, and we look at things like\n\n166\n00:09:03.153 --> 00:09:07.679\nGartner's hype cycle as well about\nthat inflated peak of expectation.\n\n167\n00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:11.293\nHere in design, this is where we design.\n\n168\n00:09:11.293 --> 00:09:12.874\nAnd in transition,\n\n169\n00:09:12.874 --> 00:09:18.550\nwe've got our developers who will\nsimply build what has been designed.\n\n170\n00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.620\nWe have to expect that\nthere will always be\n\n171\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.610\na negative impact when we\nimplement any service.\n\n172\n00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.800\nAnd it doesn't matter\nwhat that service is.\n\n173\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.710\nSo we have got to design to reduce that\nnegative impact as much as possible.\n\n174\n00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.163\nLet me put this into a real\nlife perspective for you.\n\n175\n00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:46.300\nI was desperate a few years ago now.\n\n176\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.340\nI was desperate for certain piece\nof wearable technology, really,\n\n177\n00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.660\nreally desperate for it, to the point\nwhere had I not ordered it online, I would\n\n178\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:59.104\nhave been somebody who was lining outside\na shop waiting for this thing to launch.\n\n179\n00:09:59.104 --> 00:10:00.022\nAnd I've done it before.\n\n180\n00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:02.455\n[LAUGH] I've done this before.\n\n181\n00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:07.948\nBut I was so desperate for this, but\nI had got to the point where I had worked\n\n182\n00:10:07.948 --> 00:10:12.920\nmyself up and I had what we call\nthat inflated peak of expectation.\n\n183\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.250\nWhere I expected this piece of wearable\ntechnology to do absolutely everything for\n\n184\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.940\nme including make me a cup of tea\nin the morning when I wake up.\n\n185\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.550\nAnd then I bought this piece\nof wearable technology and\n\n186\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.140\nrealized that I'm blind as a bat.\n\n187\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.660\nAnd whilst it didn't do everything\nthat said it was going to do,\n\n188\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.940\nI couldn't see it.\n\n189\n00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.440\nSo there was absolutely no benefit to\nme in having this piece of wearable\n\n190\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.700\ntechnology over and\nabove its basic function and nothing else.\n\n191\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.750\nI have since learned not\njust to live with this, but\n\n192\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:51.050\nI have actually learned that it can do so\nmuch more than what I really expected.\n\n193\n00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.440\nBut the things that I was\nexpecting it to do, well,\n\n194\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.610\nI can't use because I can't really see.\n\n195\n00:10:57.185 --> 00:11:02.337\nBut there was that negative impact\nwhen I first got it home and\n\n196\n00:11:02.337 --> 00:11:07.086\nI realized that even though\nit did everything that it was\n\n197\n00:11:07.086 --> 00:11:11.446\nsupposed to do,\nit wasn't the right thing for me.\n\n198\n00:11:13.768 --> 00:11:17.398\nThis happens,\neven though in service strategy, we can,\n\n199\n00:11:17.398 --> 00:11:22.678\nwith business relationship management,\nwork hand in hand with the organization.\n\n200\n00:11:22.678 --> 00:11:27.649\nAnd we can ensure that\nwe set expectations.\n\n201\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.180\nWe still will have a negative impact.\n\n202\n00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.270\nBecause something even though\nit works exactly as it should,\n\n203\n00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.230\nthere might be another aspect\nthat doesn't work quite the same.\n\n204\n00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.920\nSo you see, where it says think about\nthe commercial impact of a new solution\n\n205\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.920\non the organization,\nthere will be a negative impact.\n\n206\n00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.490\nAnd it's up to us to try and\n\n207\n00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.500\nwork with business relationship management\nto predict, preempt, to plan for\n\n208\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.690\nthat negative impact and\nto design a way around that,\n\n209\n00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:05.950\nto bypass the negative impact,\nto actually try and ease that negativity.\n\n210\n00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.070\nYou see in service transition,\nwe will build and test and\n\n211\n00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.700\nimplement what has been designed.\n\n212\n00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.550\nSo this is where we design.\n\n213\n00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.720\nAnd this is where we design for\nminimal impact.\n\n214\n00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.920\nWe talk about risk assessment and\nrisk mitigation.\n\n215\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.480\nAnd that's exactly what we're\ndoing here in service design.\n\n216\n00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.010\nWe are doing the risk assessment and\nwe are doing the risk mitigation.\n\n217\n00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.757\nAnd we are communicating to\na business relationship management.\n\n218\n00:12:34.757 --> 00:12:38.278\nWe're working hand in hand with them and\ncoming up with solutions and\n\n219\n00:12:38.278 --> 00:12:41.617\nsimply turn and say, hey,\nwhat about this and what about that and\n\n220\n00:12:41.617 --> 00:12:43.088\ndo you think this will work?\n\n221\n00:12:43.088 --> 00:12:45.470\nGo back to our previous episode and\n\n222\n00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.970\ntake a look at what's in that\nservice acceptance criteria.\n\n223\n00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.626\nThat's what we're working out here because\neverything is then an input into a service\n\n224\n00:12:54.626 --> 00:12:55.590\ndesign package.\n\n225\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.731\nIt says here right in that top bullet\npoint, we've got a balancing act here.\n\n226\n00:13:01.731 --> 00:13:05.420\nWe know, and\nwe've mentioned this in previous episodes,\n\n227\n00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.253\nwe know that we have got to give\nthe business what they ask for,\n\n228\n00:13:09.253 --> 00:13:12.307\nbut we also know that\nwe've got a balancing act.\n\n229\n00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:15.698\nAnd we've got things like design\nconstraints which we'll look at in\n\n230\n00:13:15.698 --> 00:13:16.522\na little while.\n\n231\n00:13:16.522 --> 00:13:20.406\nAnd we've got other aspects that\nwe've got to consider, including,\n\n232\n00:13:20.406 --> 00:13:22.218\nnot just the functionality, but\n\n233\n00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:26.442\nthe resources that we have available\nincluding money and including skills.\n\n234\n00:13:26.442 --> 00:13:30.058\nAnd also the time that we've\ngot to deliver within.\n\n235\n00:13:30.058 --> 00:13:34.199\nWe've got this diagram in\nthe bottom right-hand corner here,\n\n236\n00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:39.184\nwhich if you actually can download this,\nyou will see that what we have to do,\n\n237\n00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:42.787\nit'll be a little bit clearer\nif you can download this,\n\n238\n00:13:42.787 --> 00:13:46.033\nwhich is why I asked you\nto look at your materials.\n\n239\n00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:50.770\nWe have to find the right balance\nbetween our resources, our money and\n\n240\n00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.770\nour people and the schedule,\nthat's the time, and the functionality.\n\n241\n00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.433\nIf we increase the functionality, and\n\n242\n00:13:58.433 --> 00:14:03.848\nI would really love if this was sort of\nan interactive map and we could move this.\n\n243\n00:14:03.848 --> 00:14:06.895\nBecause if I increase\nthe functionality up here,\n\n244\n00:14:06.895 --> 00:14:11.609\nI'm actually putting on more of a\nconstraint on the resources and money, and\n\n245\n00:14:11.609 --> 00:14:15.164\nputting more of a constraint\non the schedule, which means\n\n246\n00:14:15.164 --> 00:14:20.120\nthat it's probably going to be delivered,\nwell, with a higher cost and later.\n\n247\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:28.010\nIf I put emphasis on schedule and I give\nus sort of I want to get it done quickly,\n\n248\n00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:31.155\nand so\nI move this particular apex over here.\n\n249\n00:14:31.155 --> 00:14:33.747\nThen I'm going to have to\nreduce functionality and\n\n250\n00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:37.110\nit's probably going to cost\nus a little bit more money.\n\n251\n00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:41.515\nSo we have to have what we\ncall that design balance.\n\n252\n00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:44.768\nAnd we need to understand\nthe business drivers in order to\n\n253\n00:14:44.768 --> 00:14:47.990\nbe able to achieve that design balance.\n\n254\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.729\nAnd as it says in our next particular\nslide here, we've gotta ensure\n\n255\n00:14:51.729 --> 00:14:55.476\nthen in order to get that balance,\nthat we have good communication.\n\n256\n00:14:55.476 --> 00:15:00.066\nIf any plans change, that we always\nhave our up to date strategies, and\n\n257\n00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.455\nour up to date plans.\n\n258\n00:15:01.455 --> 00:15:04.231\nAnd that all of our design documents,\n\n259\n00:15:04.231 --> 00:15:08.849\nare consistent with our ways of\nworking and with our policies.\n\n260\n00:15:08.849 --> 00:15:13.101\nAnd we have to be able to respond very\nquickly to the business needs, so\n\n261\n00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:14.553\nwe have to be flexible.\n\n262\n00:15:14.553 --> 00:15:16.318\nBut then at the same time,\n\n263\n00:15:16.318 --> 00:15:20.965\nwe have to deliver what our\norganization are asking us to do.\n\n264\n00:15:20.965 --> 00:15:25.756\nNow we have to negotiate, and\nI love that use of the word there.\n\n265\n00:15:25.756 --> 00:15:30.544\nBecause we really have to utilize\nbusiness relationship management to\n\n266\n00:15:30.544 --> 00:15:32.945\nnegotiate with our organization.\n\n267\n00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.850\nBecause I can tell you now, that there\naren't many organizations around\n\n268\n00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.330\nthat are going to give you a bottomless\nbudget, all right, [LAUGH] for\n\n269\n00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.050\nany of your projects.\n\n270\n00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.931\nThey are going to, very simply say,\nthis is the money you've got.\n\n271\n00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:52.294\nAnd then as we get into the design,\nwe start talking about scope creep,\n\n272\n00:15:52.294 --> 00:15:56.599\nwhich we really, really want to try and\nminimize as much as possible.\n\n273\n00:15:56.599 --> 00:16:01.218\nBut as timescales shift,\nthen If time scales creep, and\n\n274\n00:16:01.218 --> 00:16:04.660\ntime scales move then so does our budget.\n\n275\n00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.401\nBecause that means that we're\nutilizing our project team for longer.\n\n276\n00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:12.170\nWe've gotta pay them something\nthey're not gonna work for nothing.\n\n277\n00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.460\nSo that means that our\nbudget is also creeping too.\n\n278\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.830\nSo we've got to be realistic with\nthe organization and be realistic with our\n\n279\n00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.380\nbusiness, and we've got to be able\nto go back to them and negotiate\n\n280\n00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.950\ntheir requirements because sometimes we\ncan't give them everything that they want.\n\n281\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.570\nSo what do we do in service design, then?\n\n282\n00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.150\nWell this looks like quite a busy slide.\n\n283\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:40.110\nBut what we're doing is we are designing,\n\n284\n00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.850\nas I mentioned in our previous episode.\n\n285\n00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:49.086\nWe are producing that blueprint,\nthat three dimensional blueprint,\n\n286\n00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:51.870\nthat's coming from the architect.\n\n287\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.786\nThat's handed over to the contractor.\n\n288\n00:16:53.786 --> 00:16:58.110\nThat says absolutely everything.\n\n289\n00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.600\nAnd our service design package,\n\n290\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.970\nall of the contents of that SDP, includes\nall of the functional specifications.\n\n291\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.580\nIt includes the service level agreements\nand the service level targets.\n\n292\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.940\nIt includes all of\nthe support arrangements.\n\n293\n00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.480\nIt includes the OLAs and\nthe underpinning contracts.\n\n294\n00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.273\nIt includes absolutely the design of\nevery single one of the CI types, our\n\n295\n00:17:20.273 --> 00:17:25.778\ncomponents of our service, including the\ndesign of the software and the hardware.\n\n296\n00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:29.594\nBut also the training needs analysis and\ntraining schedule for\n\n297\n00:17:29.594 --> 00:17:33.339\nall of our people including,\nas I've said, the contract for\n\n298\n00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:38.453\nour internet service providers, including\nnaming document or naming criteria for\n\n299\n00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:42.840\nall of our documentation and for\nall of our process documentation.\n\n300\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.920\nIt includes all the updates and\n\n301\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:50.124\nall the RFCs that have been raised to be\nable to implement those new services.\n\n302\n00:17:50.124 --> 00:17:54.100\nAbsolutely everything and so\nwhat I've just covered there you'll see or\n\n303\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.974\nwhat I've just talked about there includes\nabsolutely everything that's in that page,\n\n304\n00:17:58.974 --> 00:18:02.331\nother than right at the bottom\nwe talk about risk assessment.\n\n305\n00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:06.684\nFor any new service,\nwe're bringing in something new\n\n306\n00:18:06.684 --> 00:18:10.184\nto the organization and\nthere is a risk, and\n\n307\n00:18:10.184 --> 00:18:15.480\nwe have to ensure that we can\nmitigate against any of those risks.\n\n308\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.373\nNow some risks we might choose to accept,\nbut\n\n309\n00:18:18.373 --> 00:18:23.111\nthere is certainly an element of risk\nmanagement within service design.\n\n310\n00:18:23.111 --> 00:18:29.010\nWe may also have to,\nwe may, and this is a may.\n\n311\n00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:33.198\nIt's not a definite,\nwe may have to select suppliers,\n\n312\n00:18:33.198 --> 00:18:39.003\nwe may have to go outside for some of\nthe elements of our new service solution.\n\n313\n00:18:39.003 --> 00:18:42.405\nWe may already have contracts\nwith existing suppliers.\n\n314\n00:18:42.405 --> 00:18:45.052\nThink about internet service provider.\n\n315\n00:18:45.052 --> 00:18:46.712\nWe've already got a contract.\n\n316\n00:18:46.712 --> 00:18:53.650\nSo if we bring in a new service, then that\nmight increase the usage on our network.\n\n317\n00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:58.703\nAnd that might mean we may need to\nincrease the amount of bandwidth.\n\n318\n00:18:58.703 --> 00:19:01.531\nSo we might have to bring\nin new suppliers, but\n\n319\n00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:06.100\nwe might have to renegotiate\nour existing contracts, too.\n\n320\n00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.270\nAnd so that means we'll\nutilize supplier management,\n\n321\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:14.710\nit's a process we find here within service\ndesign, to facilitate this for us.\n\n322\n00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:20.550\nNow the bottom piece of this particular\nslide refers to a tendering process,\n\n323\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.330\nin other words, selecting suppliers.\n\n324\n00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.080\nSome organizations, and\nI say some, not all.\n\n325\n00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:35.480\nSome organizations will require us in IT\nto go out to tender for any new supplier.\n\n326\n00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.446\nWhat that means is that we\ndevise a standard set of\n\n327\n00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:43.431\nrequirements that we want for\nthat new service.\n\n328\n00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:45.850\nThink about our must go list.\n\n329\n00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:49.400\nNow we looked at that in a previous\nepisode, our must haves, our should haves,\n\n330\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.600\nour could haves, and\nour would like in the future.\n\n331\n00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.280\nAnd then we will evaluate all potential\nsuppliers against that must go list for\n\n332\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:03.837\nthat particular piece of software, or that\nparticular piece of technology, that tool.\n\n333\n00:20:03.837 --> 00:20:08.403\nAnd then we will evaluate all suppliers\nagainst our must haves and our should\n\n334\n00:20:08.403 --> 00:20:13.108\nhaves and our could haves, etc., and\nthen we will create a short list based on\n\n335\n00:20:13.108 --> 00:20:18.060\ntheir performance against the must\nhaves and should haves and could haves.\n\n336\n00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.590\nWe will also evaluate other\naspects such as supportability,\n\n337\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:27.155\nbased on reference sites as well, so\nreferences from existing customers,\n\n338\n00:20:27.155 --> 00:20:32.320\netc, and that's when we will\nselect a supplier impartially.\n\n339\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.320\nThe tender process is used\npredominantly in public sectors, so\n\n340\n00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.080\nit's used within government environments.\n\n341\n00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.752\nIt's used within military environments.\n\n342\n00:20:39.752 --> 00:20:44.953\nIt is used sometimes within\nhealthcare environments, etc.\n\n343\n00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:48.260\nIt depends on your organization.\n\n344\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:54.660\nThis is not something that is set within\nyour IT service provider organization,\n\n345\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.390\nthis is not an ethic that is\nset internally within IT.\n\n346\n00:20:59.605 --> 00:21:02.714\nThis is an organizational directive.\n\n347\n00:21:02.714 --> 00:21:07.802\nSo your organization will tell you\nas to whether you have a preferred\n\n348\n00:21:07.802 --> 00:21:12.645\nlist of suppliers or whether you\nneed to go to tender to process.\n\n349\n00:21:12.645 --> 00:21:16.355\nThat is purely your organization's choice.\n\n350\n00:21:16.355 --> 00:21:19.892\nIt's not your choice,\nit's down to the organization.\n\n351\n00:21:19.892 --> 00:21:25.317\nAnd then we simply go and\nprocure our preferred solution,\n\n352\n00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:28.982\nperhaps based on that tender process.\n\n353\n00:21:28.982 --> 00:21:32.419\nAnd that includes then negotiating\nthe actual contract and\n\n354\n00:21:32.419 --> 00:21:34.557\nworking with supplier management.\n\n355\n00:21:36.553 --> 00:21:41.740\nSo what design does then,\nwell design designs, as we said.\n\n356\n00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.567\nYeah, I mean I'm not too sure how I\ncan put that more simplistically.\n\n357\n00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:47.309\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it designs.\n\n358\n00:21:47.309 --> 00:21:51.670\nAnd look at the outputs we've got there,\ndesigns for the new or changed services.\n\n359\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.570\nIt produces our service design package.\n\n360\n00:21:54.570 --> 00:22:00.378\nIt also produces revised designs etc for\nany dated services too.\n\n361\n00:22:00.378 --> 00:22:03.369\nAnd it also produces risk assessments and\n\n362\n00:22:03.369 --> 00:22:07.910\nit outlines how we can\nmitigate against any risks.\n\n363\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.190\nThat's what design does, okay?\n\n364\n00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:11.851\nDesign produces design.\n\n365\n00:22:11.851 --> 00:22:15.670\nIt produces that service design package.\n\n366\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:20.460\nAnd of course the inputs of\nvarious design activities.\n\n367\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.170\nWell, we already have a section\nwhere we looked at inputs and\n\n368\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.380\noutputs in a previous episode.\n\n369\n00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.810\nBut we're going to include all of\nour vision from our organization.\n\n370\n00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.693\nWe're going to include our strategies,\nand our governance policies, and\n\n371\n00:22:33.693 --> 00:22:34.810\nour direction.\n\n372\n00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.700\nWe're also going to include\nthe business requirements.\n\n373\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.110\nI should hope your not designing\ncompletely independently without any\n\n374\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.503\nthought to the organization,\n\n375\n00:22:43.503 --> 00:22:48.470\ncuz after all they're telling us what\nthey want us to build for them right.\n\n376\n00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.600\nThis is what comes into service design but\n\n377\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.280\nwe also have to take into consideration\nour current infrastructure too.\n\n378\n00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.610\nAs I said, we never start off\nwith a blank piece of paper.\n\n379\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.663\nAnd when we designing, and just really\nto wrap up this particular episode.\n\n380\n00:23:03.663 --> 00:23:10.081\nWhen we are designing, we always have\nto consider our design constraints.\n\n381\n00:23:10.081 --> 00:23:14.318\nAnd this is just an example\nof our design constraints.\n\n382\n00:23:14.318 --> 00:23:18.014\nAnd those constraints could\nbe things like copyrights,\n\n383\n00:23:18.014 --> 00:23:21.332\nthings like our existing contracts for\ninstance.\n\n384\n00:23:21.332 --> 00:23:25.582\nIf we can't amend an existing contract\nwith a supplier then that would be\n\n385\n00:23:25.582 --> 00:23:27.930\nconsidered to be a constraint.\n\n386\n00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.472\nI mean maybe we can amend it but\nit's going to cost us too much to do so.\n\n387\n00:23:31.472 --> 00:23:35.180\nThink about technology constraints.\n\n388\n00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.098\nWe can't go and bring in maybe laptops\ninto a government environment if we\n\n389\n00:23:40.098 --> 00:23:44.619\ngot constraints that say we can't\ndo that because of security, and\n\n390\n00:23:44.619 --> 00:23:46.705\nbecause of technology, etc.\n\n391\n00:23:46.705 --> 00:23:49.504\nWhat about compliance with standards?\n\n392\n00:23:49.504 --> 00:23:54.441\nIf you have achieved an international\nstandard and you are complying with\n\n393\n00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:59.538\na certain international standard,\nyou can't bring it in the new service,\n\n394\n00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:04.413\nThat's going to then cause you to\nfail on that international standard.\n\n395\n00:24:04.413 --> 00:24:09.662\nSo think about this, think about your\nethics as well, your company ethics.\n\n396\n00:24:09.662 --> 00:24:12.932\nIn a previous episode I\nmentioned green IT, and\n\n397\n00:24:12.932 --> 00:24:16.220\nI mentioned sort of recycling policies,\nnow.\n\n398\n00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.927\nAnd a lot of countries around the world,\n\n399\n00:24:20.927 --> 00:24:26.343\nlots of countries it is a legal\nrequirement to recycle all IT.\n\n400\n00:24:26.343 --> 00:24:29.658\nWhich means that if you're\nbringing in a new service,\n\n401\n00:24:29.658 --> 00:24:34.199\nif you are then retiring an old service or\nyou're retiring old equipment,\n\n402\n00:24:34.199 --> 00:24:37.555\nyou have to decide what you're\ngoing to do about that.\n\n403\n00:24:37.555 --> 00:24:42.612\nWhat a lot of organizations do,\nand I'm thinking scalability here.\n\n404\n00:24:42.612 --> 00:24:46.533\nBut what a lot of organizations\nwill do is as they become\n\n405\n00:24:46.533 --> 00:24:51.224\nan international organization\nthey will take the most stringent\n\n406\n00:24:51.224 --> 00:24:55.500\nlegal requirements from any\ncountry that they operate in.\n\n407\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.980\nAnd they will apply those as ethics\nacross the whole entire organization.\n\n408\n00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:06.860\nBecause that means that they can still\noperate in a consistent way, and\n\n409\n00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.963\ntherefore, they can operate efficiently.\n\n410\n00:25:09.963 --> 00:25:18.262\nSo I think of perhaps one of the large\ndrug companies that we have globally.\n\n411\n00:25:18.262 --> 00:25:21.900\nAnd the most stringent requirements for\n\n412\n00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.074\nthe testing of drugs\nhappens to lie in Canada.\n\n413\n00:25:26.074 --> 00:25:29.987\nAnd so\nwhat this particular organization does is,\n\n414\n00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:35.818\nthey use the Canadian requirements and\nthe Canadian legislative minimum.\n\n415\n00:25:35.818 --> 00:25:40.578\nAnd that is applied throughout the entire\norganization, right the way across\n\n416\n00:25:40.578 --> 00:25:45.351\nEurope and right the way across North\nAmerica, and right the way across Asia.\n\n417\n00:25:45.351 --> 00:25:49.590\nBecause then that means that if they\ncan comply with Canadian requirements,\n\n418\n00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.950\nthey can comply with everything else.\n\n419\n00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.310\nBut they're still working consistently and\n\n420\n00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.710\nto a standard and that's something\nthat we do within IT as well.\n\n421\n00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:02.553\nFor instance, those organizations\nthat operate in North America and\n\n422\n00:26:02.553 --> 00:26:04.647\nalso operate elsewhere in the world.\n\n423\n00:26:04.647 --> 00:26:10.611\nAnd the most stringent recycling\nrequirements which happen to be in Europe,\n\n424\n00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:16.222\nthen they apply those globally,\nacross the whole of the organization.\n\n425\n00:26:16.222 --> 00:26:20.847\nSo for this particular episode then,\nwhat we've looked at is we've looked more\n\n426\n00:26:20.847 --> 00:26:25.622\nclosely at our design constraints, and\nwe've looked at what we actually design.\n\n427\n00:26:25.622 --> 00:26:30.477\nAnd what I'd like you to do right now is\njust take a moment to go back through your\n\n428\n00:26:30.477 --> 00:26:31.345\nnotes.\n\n429\n00:26:31.345 --> 00:26:34.325\nThere will be an exercise in\nyour downloadable material\n\n430\n00:26:34.325 --> 00:26:36.315\nonce we have finished this section.\n\n431\n00:26:36.315 --> 00:26:39.585\nSo I'd like you to take sort\nof the next 15, 20 minutes and\n\n432\n00:26:39.585 --> 00:26:44.525\njust read through the notes that we've\nalready covered before we come back again.\n\n433\n00:26:44.525 --> 00:26:48.912\nAnd then we start looking further\ninto the design principles.\n\n434\n00:26:48.912 --> 00:26:49.691\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo,\n\n435\n00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:53.257\nwell thank you again for helping us to\nunderstand a bit more about this idea,\n\n436\n00:26:53.257 --> 00:26:57.270\nthe design principle that we really\nneed to start with designing everything.\n\n437\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.939\nTaking into consideration all those\nelements is really key along with\n\n438\n00:27:00.939 --> 00:27:02.624\nthe existing infrastructure.\n\n439\n00:27:02.624 --> 00:27:06.007\nSo that we can come up with a proper\nsolution that we need to that's actually\n\n440\n00:27:06.007 --> 00:27:07.094\ngonna fit us end to end.\n\n441\n00:27:07.094 --> 00:27:11.337\nAnd that's an important part, of course,\nof anything that we're actually gonna\n\n442\n00:27:11.337 --> 00:27:15.400\nbe doing in IT, and service design is\na great place for us to begin here.\n\n443\n00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.899\nBut there's more to come in terms of,\nwell, service design but that's for\n\n444\n00:27:18.899 --> 00:27:20.003\nanother episode then.\n\n445\n00:27:20.003 --> 00:27:24.023\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n446\n00:27:24.023 --> 00:27:25.113\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n447\n00:27:25.113 --> 00:27:30.946\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Design

00:00:12.262\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:15.270\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.020\nyou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate Service Design show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.780\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n7\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.050\ntoday we're actually going to be taking\na look at five aspects of service design.\n\n8\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.110\nNow we already talked about them briefly,\nbut here to help us understand in much\n\n9\n00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.280\nmore depth, is gonna be our ITIL\nmaven herself, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.550\nJo welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.880\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for\nhaving me Ronnie, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.790\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n13\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.510\nNow Jo we went over the basic\ndesign principles themselves.\n\n14\n00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.670\nWe did mention the idea\nof these five aspects but\n\n15\n00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.390\nwhat are we actually gonna\ntake a look at and do now?\n\n16\n00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.790\n&gt;&gt; So we're just gonna expand on what we\ncovered in a previous episode really.\n\n17\n00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.850\nAnd just look a little bit more in\ndepth about what that actually entails.\n\n18\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.620\nEach of the five aspects\nof service design.\n\n19\n00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.310\n&gt;&gt; All right so Joe as we get started here\nonce again where is the best place for us\n\n20\n00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.440\nto get started on these different aspects\nand take us through what we need to.\n\n21\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, like always, best place to\nstart is right at the beginning, so\n\n22\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.990\nwe're gonna start with number one.\n\n23\n00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.480\nAnd number one is the new or\nchanged service, as it says there.\n\n24\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.500\nNow, in a previous slide in our\nlast episode, we looked at this and\n\n25\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.720\nwe said we design these service solution.\n\n26\n00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.690\nAnd that's exactly what this is.\n\n27\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.420\nThis is actually designing\nthe service solution itself.\n\n28\n00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.650\nOn the service solution, as I've all ready\nmentioned in the previous episode is made\n\n29\n00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.910\nup of the components of the service or\nwhat we call our configuration items.\n\n30\n00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.570\n&gt;&gt; On those CIs are our software.\n\n31\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.820\nWhat software are we going to use?\n\n32\n00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.730\nAnd it doesn't just include the software\nthat's going to seat on our desktops for\n\n33\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.190\ninstance, we're not talking about just\nclient software we're talking about\n\n34\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.650\nservice software as well, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.560\nSo, the software and the hardware and\nagain we now just talking about our\n\n36\n00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.780\nhardware as in our desktop,\nto our laptop, to our client hardware\n\n37\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.190\nwhich can now includes tablets,\nandroids, or cellphones as well.\n\n38\n00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.130\nBut it will our server hardware too.\n\n39\n00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.560\nAnd that includes, and we're going to\nlook at the infrastructure as well, but\n\n40\n00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.270\nthat includes anything that's\ninvolved in the insfrastructure,\n\n41\n00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.980\nlike the routers or routers,\nlike all of our servers, etc.\n\n42\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.710\nSo that's a hardware.\n\n43\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.740\nAnd then we're going to look\nat our environment as well.\n\n44\n00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.200\nNow our environment again is\npart of our service solution.\n\n45\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.190\nAnd as I always say you know I can't\nuse my services if I'm stood outside of\n\n46\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.015\nthe building for very long without my arms\ngetting tired from holding up my laptop,\n\n47\n00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:45.585\nwithout my battery running out\nbecause I've got no power, and\n\n48\n00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:47.825\nwithout having some sort of connectivity.\n\n49\n00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:53.160\nBecause if I'm doing something secure then\nperhaps I don't need to be using a WiFi.\n\n50\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.520\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps I need some form of cable.\n\n51\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.010\nBut I also need somewhere to sit.\n\n52\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.900\nAnd I don't mind standing all day long.\n\n53\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.010\nBut I need to be moving around.\n\n54\n00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.670\nAnd if I've got a laptop like this and\nthen I can't do that.\n\n55\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.020\nSo yeah, I need some form of environment.\n\n56\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.450\nI've gotta have that electricity and\nI've gotta have somewhere to sit.\n\n57\n00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.260\nAnd I know that that might sound as though\nthat's outside of the scope of IT, but\n\n58\n00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.200\nit's not.\n\n59\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.220\nWe have to consider this and\n\n60\n00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.130\nI wonder how many times has\na service has been designed.\n\n61\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.150\nI know because I've seen this\nwhere project management\n\n62\n00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.230\nteams have forgotten to consider\nhow many electrical outlets,\n\n63\n00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.460\nhow many electrical sockets are in the\nserver room, or how much air conditioning\n\n64\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.609\nis in the server room when they have gone\nto put a new rack of servers in there.\n\n65\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.240\nAnd we found out that, quite simply,\n\n66\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.000\nthe actual infrastructure in terms of\nenvironment just simply cannot handle it,\n\n67\n00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.705\nor maybe that UPS is not big enough for\nthat new rack of servers.\n\n68\n00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:55.775\nAnd so whilst we might think about this\nas just the fact that nobody wants to see\n\n69\n00:03:55.775 --> 00:04:00.325\noutside, you know at the front of\nthe building, it's not really.\n\n70\n00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:04.370\nWe have to consider all the environmental\naspects, because without those\n\n71\n00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.250\nI have been in plenty of server rooms\nwhere the air conditioning has failed.\n\n72\n00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.830\nI've been in mainframes where the air\nconditioning has failed because we didn't\n\n73\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.000\nplan the environmental\nconditions in advance.\n\n74\n00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.060\nWe didn't plan for this.\n\n75\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.180\nAnd then we have to pick up the pieces\nwhen something catastrophically fails.\n\n76\n00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.200\nWhen you're talking about\nair conditioning failing,\n\n77\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.440\nyou're talking about taking down a lot\nof services all at the same time and\n\n78\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.120\nthese can not be recolored in five\nminutes, you've got to wait for\n\n79\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.710\nthat temperature to drop,\nand that can take some time.\n\n80\n00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.270\nSo we've got to think about\nthe environmental aspects.\n\n81\n00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.280\nWe've also got to think about\nthe people aspects too.\n\n82\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.830\nPeople are needed to not only build.\n\n83\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.270\nAnd to implement that new service,\n\n84\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.140\npeople are needed to support\nthat service on a regular basis.\n\n85\n00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.710\nAnd so people need training.\n\n86\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.530\nAlso people need to have believe it or\n\n87\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.770\nnot a capacity to be able to\npick up that new service.\n\n88\n00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.210\nIf I am running around,\n8 hours a day or 12 hours a day.\n\n89\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.470\nAnd I am so\nbusy that I have to take work home.\n\n90\n00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.530\nYou can't expect me to take on\nthe support of a new service as well.\n\n91\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.000\nSo, people have to have\nthe capacity to be able to do this.\n\n92\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.400\nSo, yeah, we have to consider.\n\n93\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.840\nThe people and\nthen consider our documentation, and\n\n94\n00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.730\nconsider our contracts as well.\n\n95\n00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.770\nThese are our contracts\nwith our suppliers,\n\n96\n00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.310\nthese are our existing services.\n\n97\n00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.740\nLet me put this into perspective for you.\n\n98\n00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:43.570\nIf I am managing a service, and\nI'm managing a financial service.\n\n99\n00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.190\nSo let's say for instance, SAP.\n\n100\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.120\nAnd I'm managing SAP.\n\n101\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.758\nAnd here I am with a customer, and\nI have a four hour response target.\n\n102\n00:05:53.758 --> 00:06:01.140\nIn my current SLA with\nmy service desk team.\n\n103\n00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.090\nNow, my service desk team then,\n\n104\n00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.590\nwell they will respond to me within four\nhours if there was any issue with an SAP.\n\n105\n00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.980\nSo Ronnie is my service desk person,\nhe is my service desk manager.\n\n106\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.430\nNow Ronnie will have a separate agreement\nin OLA, in Operational Level Agreement\n\n107\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.130\nwith our server support team or\nour infrastructure support team.\n\n108\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:31.870\nTo support that particular that particular\nagreement that I have with him.\n\n109\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.710\nSo if I pass an incident to him,\nhe's got four hours.\n\n110\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.640\nWhich means that if he passes\nit to the desktop guys and\n\n111\n00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.380\nthe desktop guys have got,\nI don't know, maybe three hours.\n\n112\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.650\nSo they get back to Ronnie\nwithin three hours.\n\n113\n00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.600\nAnd then Ronnie comes back to me within\nthe four hours and we're all happy.\n\n114\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.990\nNow let's just say now that we're\nnegotiating a brand new service.\n\n115\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.150\nAnd that brand new service is email and\nI want a 30 minute response.\n\n116\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.210\nThat means I negotiate a 30\nminute response with Ronnie.\n\n117\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.740\nAnd Ronnie might be okay as the service\ndesk manager to agree that with me,\n\n118\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.350\nthat's great.\n\n119\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:13.032\nBut he's got an existing agreement\nwith the server guys for three hours.\n\n120\n00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:18.590\nNow this means that you've either got to\ncreate another agreement with the server\n\n121\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.510\nguys for that, well it's going to be\nless than 30 minutes or like 15 minutes.\n\n122\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.600\nThey're probably not going\nto want to agree to that.\n\n123\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.190\nIf we to go to modifier\nexisting agreement or\n\n124\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.890\nyou've got to create another\nagreement with them.\n\n125\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.296\nWell you don't wanna create another\nagreement cause that means you could have\n\n126\n00:07:35.296 --> 00:07:40.020\n5, 6, 20,\n30 agreements between you the server guys.\n\n127\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.610\nSo we don't want that.\n\n128\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.890\nI don't want to be as a customer\nsigning 15 different agreements either.\n\n129\n00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:54.336\nBut I'm not gonna be happy with four hours\nwith my service level agreement for email.\n\n130\n00:07:54.336 --> 00:07:55.963\nI want it quicker than four hours.\n\n131\n00:07:55.963 --> 00:07:58.319\nAnd that four hours that we've\ngot with financial management?\n\n132\n00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.434\nIs not good enough for me, for email.\n\n133\n00:08:01.434 --> 00:08:06.696\nSo negotiating or service level targets\nas it says in this new service,\n\n134\n00:08:06.696 --> 00:08:12.000\nthat's actually not going to be as\neasy as we think that it would be.\n\n135\n00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.350\nBecause when I always say that we're not\nstarting off with a blank piece of paper,\n\n136\n00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.190\nwe're literally not starting off\nwith a blank piece of paper.\n\n137\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.940\nAnd we have to consider that relationship\n\n138\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.160\nbetween all of the components\nof our services.\n\n139\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.475\nSo we think about the documentation.\n\n140\n00:08:26.475 --> 00:08:32.800\nNow that's actually not complicated,\nbecause Ronnie is an internal person.\n\n141\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.370\nWe both work for the same IT team or\nwe both work for the same organization.\n\n142\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.630\nThat's not complicated.\n\n143\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:45.360\nLet's imagine now though that Ronnie's\ndesktop support team is outsourced.\n\n144\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.550\nIt's a third party.\n\n145\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.470\nThen it becomes really complicated,\nbecause we are talking about contract.\n\n146\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.160\nWe're talking about legally binding\ncontracts and they have to be negotiated.\n\n147\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:04.730\nAll of these considerations\nform part of that new service.\n\n148\n00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.070\nSo when I looked at the service\ndesign package in our last episode,\n\n149\n00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.620\nI looked at everything that's needed for\nthat service design package, and\n\n150\n00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.400\nthat Is what we incorporate when we're\ndesigning the service, including\n\n151\n00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.160\nall of our service level targets,\nincluding the time scales, including\n\n152\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.720\nthe testing requirements, including\nthe outcomes that we are facilitating,\n\n153\n00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.320\nincluding how much money we've got\nto spend on that particular service.\n\n154\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.010\nAll of this has to be agreed.\n\n155\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.270\nAnd all of this forms part of that\nnew service, absolutely everything.\n\n156\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.427\nOf course we've got to come in on budget,\n\n157\n00:09:46.427 --> 00:09:49.815\ncuz all projects come in on budget,\ndon't they?\n\n158\n00:09:49.815 --> 00:09:52.252\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We've got to come in on budget.\n\n159\n00:09:52.252 --> 00:09:56.713\nAnd we've gotta make sure that we consider\nall of our warranty aspects as well,\n\n160\n00:09:56.713 --> 00:10:01.177\nthe availability, and the continuity,\nand the security, and the capacity,\n\n161\n00:10:01.177 --> 00:10:02.920\nwe've got to consider those.\n\n162\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.930\nAnd if you want to know\nmore about utility and\n\n163\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.250\nwarranty, then please take\na look at your foundation\n\n164\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.930\nrefresher that was right at the very\nbeginning of this particular show.\n\n165\n00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.980\nWe have to think about also our maturity.\n\n166\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.927\nAnd it's not just about\na maturity of our processes,\n\n167\n00:10:20.927 --> 00:10:24.184\nwhich we see a lot more\nin depth in a CSI show.\n\n168\n00:10:24.184 --> 00:10:28.031\nBut we're also thinking about\nthe maturity of our all services, and\n\n169\n00:10:28.031 --> 00:10:31.358\nhow well aligned we are to\nmeet the organization's needs.\n\n170\n00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:33.970\nSo what about then?\n\n171\n00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.390\nThis is our first aspect with\ndesigning that service solution.\n\n172\n00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.670\nWhat about designing our tools then?\n\n173\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.910\nThe tools and\n\n174\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:46.930\nthe supporting systems that we are going\nto use to be able to deliver that service.\n\n175\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.076\nWe've got one example here,\nwhich is the service portfolio.\n\n176\n00:10:51.076 --> 00:10:55.882\nAnd we've seen this particular\ndiagram in our service strategy\n\n177\n00:10:55.882 --> 00:10:58.150\ndownloadable material.\n\n178\n00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.400\nAnd this simply is right in front\nof us here, our service portfolio.\n\n179\n00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.093\nThat's split into three,\n\n180\n00:11:03.093 --> 00:11:07.658\nthat's split into pipeline which is\nwhere we define our requirements and\n\n181\n00:11:07.658 --> 00:11:12.163\nwhere we have those approved by way\nof the business case being approved.\n\n182\n00:11:12.163 --> 00:11:17.165\nAnd then in our catalogue\nthis is how our customer\n\n183\n00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:23.530\nfacing portion of our service portfolio,\nshould I say.\n\n184\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.725\nAnd then we have our retired\nservices at the bottom,\n\n185\n00:11:26.725 --> 00:11:30.512\nwhich are the services that we\nare both retiring and retired.\n\n186\n00:11:30.512 --> 00:11:35.000\nSo the services that we no longer have\nin our live production environment.\n\n187\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.380\nNow this is just one tool.\n\n188\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.670\nAnd you will see more about the service\nportfolio in our service strategy shown.\n\n189\n00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.380\nBut we have lots of other\ntools that we use to support\n\n190\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.920\nour service itself that\nagain we have to design.\n\n191\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.940\nSo we have to design our portfolio, but\n\n192\n00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.930\nwe also have to design our\nincident management system.\n\n193\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.214\nWe have to design our\nchange management system.\n\n194\n00:11:56.214 --> 00:11:59.554\nWe have to design our configuration\nmanagement system, and\n\n195\n00:11:59.554 --> 00:12:02.310\nthose configuration\nmanagement databases too.\n\n196\n00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:08.290\nNow, I mentioned about our architectures\nin our five aspects of service design.\n\n197\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.070\nAnd this is how we design\nour architectures.\n\n198\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:16.017\nAnd we have got architectures for\nour services and\n\n199\n00:12:16.017 --> 00:12:21.450\nalso our architectures for\nour organization as well.\n\n200\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.620\nNow we have our diagram here of\nour enterprise architecture.\n\n201\n00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.190\nAnd our enterprise architecture as\nit says, is how we translate that\n\n202\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:36.200\nstrategy into a architecture for us.\n\n203\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.320\nAnd that includes all of our\norganizational architecture, and\n\n204\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.770\nall of our information and\nour applications as well.\n\n205\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.372\nWhat does this mean for the organization?\n\n206\n00:12:46.372 --> 00:12:49.710\nAnd you'll see here that we\nhave the service architecture,\n\n207\n00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.420\nwhich is how the service hangs together.\n\n208\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.620\nThen we've got our\napplication architecture,\n\n209\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.460\nwhich is the interactions between\nall of our software applications.\n\n210\n00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.540\nThen we've got our data architecture,\nwhich is our data sources.\n\n211\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.820\nThese are our databases,\n\n212\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.490\nsometimes the applications may actually\nbe client based applications and\n\n213\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:13.310\nthen may sit on you client machine,\nbut the data sits somewhere else.\n\n214\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:18.167\nThink about our use of cloud technology,\nthat's a brilliant example of that\n\n215\n00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:23.398\nwhere our data sits in the cloud and quite\noften though we have client based software\n\n216\n00:13:23.398 --> 00:13:28.346\non our machines that we will utilize\nwhilst the data is stored somewhere else.\n\n217\n00:13:28.346 --> 00:13:34.285\nI think most of us nowadays it's true to\nsay have got some degree of some sort\n\n218\n00:13:34.285 --> 00:13:40.321\nof cloud service that we have where we\nbackup maybe our own photo library to or\n\n219\n00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:44.941\nwhere we store some of our\npersonal data such as our files,\n\n220\n00:13:44.941 --> 00:13:50.710\netc, so that we can load them or\ndownload them to any machine.\n\n221\n00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:55.230\nWe've also got our infrastructure\narchitecture, as well.\n\n222\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.830\nAnd that's our network topology.\n\n223\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.486\nThat's how everything hangs together.\n\n224\n00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:02.860\nAnd so let's take a look\nat our next diagram here.\n\n225\n00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.800\nAnd you'll see that what we've got is, and\n\n226\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.440\nI just want to sort of pay\nattention to the right hand side,\n\n227\n00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.640\nin the actual diagram we've got our\nbusiness organization architecture.\n\n228\n00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.080\nAnd now how our business work,\nthat will tell\n\n229\n00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.370\nus what we need to have, in other words,\nwhat services we need to have.\n\n230\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.870\nAnd we articulate those\nin our service portfolio.\n\n231\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.990\nOur service portfolio tells\nus what services we have.\n\n232\n00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.880\nThat is our list of services.\n\n233\n00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.940\nBut those services are made\nup of applications, and\n\n234\n00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.300\nalso data as well, which of course\nas I said, we store somewhere else.\n\n235\n00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:51.840\nAnd those services use our network,\nthey use our infrastructure, okay?\n\n236\n00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.830\nIt kinda makes sense.\n\n237\n00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.480\nWhen you first look at it you think,\nthat looks a little bit confusing.\n\n238\n00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.668\nIn the bottom right hand corner\nof that diagram though in very,\n\n239\n00:14:59.668 --> 00:15:01.052\nvery small letters there,\n\n240\n00:15:01.052 --> 00:15:05.217\nit mentions that this is actually part\nour service knowledge management system.\n\n241\n00:15:05.217 --> 00:15:08.931\nAnd I want you to take a look\nat our service transition show,\n\n242\n00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:13.909\nand take a look at knowledge management,\nand you will see in that process that we\n\n243\n00:15:13.909 --> 00:15:19.240\noutline more of what our service knowledge\nmanagement system really means, okay?\n\n244\n00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.580\nSo here again, I just want us to\ntake a look again at this diagram.\n\n245\n00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.080\nThis is all about looking\nat our architecture and\n\n246\n00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.240\nwhat we actually design by way of\nnot just network topology, but\n\n247\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.140\nalso by way of people and\nroles and activities and\n\n248\n00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.250\nwhat they actually need to be trained in,\nin order to be able to do their work.\n\n249\n00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.410\nSo we understand\nthe business requirements.\n\n250\n00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.300\nWe understand then what roles we need.\n\n251\n00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.184\nThose roles will perform processes and\n\n252\n00:15:50.184 --> 00:15:53.684\nthey will use tools to\nsupport the technology.\n\n253\n00:15:53.684 --> 00:15:59.510\nSo we have to design a management\narchitecture that meets the business\n\n254\n00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:05.054\nrequirements, but that is still\nable to support the technology.\n\n255\n00:16:05.054 --> 00:16:07.552\nSo we start off by understanding\nwhat we're trying to do.\n\n256\n00:16:07.552 --> 00:16:12.537\nAnd then we define the roles that\nare required to be able to support that\n\n257\n00:16:12.537 --> 00:16:17.607\nservice, and what processes they will use,\nwhat tools they will use,\n\n258\n00:16:17.607 --> 00:16:22.010\nand then obviously,\nthe technology skills as well.\n\n259\n00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:27.910\nSo we design top down as it says,\nand we implement bottom up.\n\n260\n00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.480\nSo we have, well,\nthree architectural type roles.\n\n261\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.860\nWe have the business architect, or\nrather the organizational architect.\n\n262\n00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.430\nAnd this is the person that\nwill look at the, as it says,\n\n263\n00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.320\nthe structural components\nof the organization.\n\n264\n00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.800\nIn other words,\nhow we are going to support a service.\n\n265\n00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.100\nThen we have a service architect\nthat looks at the interaction\n\n266\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:00.460\nbetween all of the applications\nthat make up a service.\n\n267\n00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.610\nAnd then we have an infrastructure\narchitect or you might call them a network\n\n268\n00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:09.380\narchitect that looks at all of our network\nand how our network hangs together, and\n\n269\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.080\nwhat's required to be able to\nsupport that particular service.\n\n270\n00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.010\nWithout getting into too\nmuch technical detail and\n\n271\n00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:21.280\nI don't want to do that because\nwe're not in a technical class here.\n\n272\n00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.070\nWhat we're in is a service management\nclass so we're managing our services, but\n\n273\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:32.160\nwe need to understand how\nour service hangs together.\n\n274\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.050\nIn other words,\nwe call it architecture but\n\n275\n00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.080\nthink about the structure of our service.\n\n276\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.230\nWhat service do we have?\n\n277\n00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.610\nWhat applications do we have?\n\n278\n00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.390\nSome are server based,\nsome are client based.\n\n279\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.460\nHow is that going to hang together?\n\n280\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.955\nWhere is the data going to be stored?\n\n281\n00:17:50.955 --> 00:17:54.715\nWhat portion of the network\nare they going to be using?\n\n282\n00:17:54.715 --> 00:17:57.135\nHow much bandwidth do they use?\n\n283\n00:17:57.135 --> 00:18:01.385\nAnd at what times of day will\nthey be using that bandwidth?\n\n284\n00:18:01.385 --> 00:18:03.035\nWhat about backups?\n\n285\n00:18:03.035 --> 00:18:07.245\nBecause if we're storing data\nin the same database and\n\n286\n00:18:07.245 --> 00:18:11.814\nthe same physical server, but\nmaybe in just another virtual area.\n\n287\n00:18:11.814 --> 00:18:14.610\nIf we're storing data in\nthe same physical server or\n\n288\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.370\nsomething else,\nthen how are we going to back it up?\n\n289\n00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.985\nDo we back it up together or\ndo we back them up separately?\n\n290\n00:18:21.985 --> 00:18:26.626\nWhat about sort of full backups\nversus incremental backups?\n\n291\n00:18:26.626 --> 00:18:33.461\nAll of this has to be considered when\nwe're considering the architecture.\n\n292\n00:18:33.461 --> 00:18:38.056\nSo when you think about it,\nit's difficult for us to get into too much\n\n293\n00:18:38.056 --> 00:18:43.142\ntechnical detail, because every single\nservice is going to be different.\n\n294\n00:18:43.142 --> 00:18:46.890\nAnd every single environment\nis going to be different.\n\n295\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.950\nSo now let's talk about\ndesigning processes then, okay?\n\n296\n00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.380\nHow do we design a process?\n\n297\n00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.590\nNow we have seen this in our foundation.\n\n298\n00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.910\nAnd we have seen this in our\nfoundation refresher as well.\n\n299\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:07.040\nAnd in our foundation refresher, I talked\nyou through how we design a service.\n\n300\n00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.520\nBut very, very simply, okay,\nI'm gonna start off and\n\n301\n00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.010\nwe're going to go through this right now.\n\n302\n00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.460\nI'm gonna put this very simply.\n\n303\n00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.420\nWe start off with understanding\na process objective.\n\n304\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.930\nThat's step number one.\n\n305\n00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:26.240\nStep number one is the process objective,\nhere in the top right-hand corner.\n\n306\n00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.830\nSo we work out what we\nwant from a process.\n\n307\n00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.235\nLet's say incident management.\n\n308\n00:19:31.235 --> 00:19:35.624\nAn incident management's objective\nis to restore normal service\n\n309\n00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:37.983\noperation as quickly as possible.\n\n310\n00:19:37.983 --> 00:19:40.221\nNow we've probably started\nof with a process owner.\n\n311\n00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:44.760\nI should think somebody's been tasked\nwith this particular role, okay?\n\n312\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.244\nSo we start off with working\nout the objectives, and\n\n313\n00:19:47.244 --> 00:19:48.891\nthen we take a look at the outputs.\n\n314\n00:19:48.891 --> 00:19:51.032\nStep number two, okay?\n\n315\n00:19:51.032 --> 00:19:56.020\nSo what does a fixed or\nrestored service look like?\n\n316\n00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:01.680\nAnd then number three is\nworking out the various inputs.\n\n317\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.140\nThat's step number three.\n\n318\n00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.140\nSo what could a broken service look like?\n\n319\n00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.887\nI don't know,\ncould be thousands of options there.\n\n320\n00:20:09.887 --> 00:20:14.701\nAnd then step number four is working out\nthe activities and the procedures and\n\n321\n00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:17.219\nwork instructions that will take us from\n\n322\n00:20:17.219 --> 00:20:20.200\nsomething broken through\nto something fixed.\n\n323\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.170\nAnd then step number five, well,\nwhat roles and skills do I need to be\n\n324\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:32.220\nable to perform these activities\nto get from broken to fixed?\n\n325\n00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.070\nAnd then who am I going\nto need to do this?\n\n326\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.780\nThis is step number six down here.\n\n327\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:43.240\nWho am I going to need to do this,\nand what skills do they need,\n\n328\n00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.550\nand how they are going to be organized,\nand what tools do they need?\n\n329\n00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.780\nThis is step number six.\n\n330\n00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.430\nAnd then of course, step number seven and\nwe should be by the way documenting this,\n\n331\n00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.960\nas we go along is working out\nwhat was the triggers are.\n\n332\n00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.500\nIn other words,\nhow does the process start?\n\n333\n00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.190\nSo do we accept phone calls into the\nservice desk or will this come from email.\n\n334\n00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:12.148\nAnd then lastly, we need to work out\nexactly how we're going to communicate\n\n335\n00:21:12.148 --> 00:21:17.192\nfeedback, exactly how we're\ngoing to collect that feedback.\n\n336\n00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:19.980\nSo that's how we work out a process.\n\n337\n00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.580\nThis is how we devise a process.\n\n338\n00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.450\nNow, when we're in service design,\nand I've said to you before,\n\n339\n00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.190\nwe don't start with\na blank piece of paper.\n\n340\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.320\nWe've already got processes\nin place in our organization.\n\n341\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.680\nSo what we're really doing is we\nare improving our existing processes,\n\n342\n00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:45.069\nwith every new service that comes in,\nwe are improving our existing process.\n\n343\n00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.141\nSo now then,\nour last aspect in service design,\n\n344\n00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:53.275\nthe last thing that we\ndesign are our matrix, okay?\n\n345\n00:21:53.275 --> 00:21:56.111\nAnd we design what we're\ngoing to measure and\n\n346\n00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:59.000\nwe design how we're going to measure it.\n\n347\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.420\nSo that includes designing,\nwell, the services,\n\n348\n00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.740\nthe systems that we use\nto take those metrics.\n\n349\n00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:12.050\nSo I already mentioned in a previous\nepisode, that end to end service metrics\n\n350\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:17.960\ninclude both the technology metrics and\nthe process metrics.\n\n351\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.430\nTechnology metrics will measure,\nsay, the reliability of a component.\n\n352\n00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.032\nHow often it breaks down?\n\n353\n00:22:24.032 --> 00:22:26.200\nHow often it falls over?\n\n354\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.290\nBut we need to combine that with, say,\n\n355\n00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:34.620\nthe incident management process metrics\nin how quickly we restore service.\n\n356\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:39.680\nAnd it's both of those combined that\nwill tell us how that actual service\n\n357\n00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.150\nis performing from an end\nto end perspective.\n\n358\n00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.420\nSo process metrics.\n\n359\n00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.850\nWe measure progress, we measure\ncompliance, we measure effectiveness,\n\n360\n00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:54.500\nand in that example that I gave you,\nwe were measuring efficiency.\n\n361\n00:22:54.500 --> 00:23:00.420\nAnd what we will use is we\nwill use our metrics tree.\n\n362\n00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.100\nAnd our metrics tree will very,\nvery simply.\n\n363\n00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:07.711\nAnd I like if you take\na look at the CSI shown.\n\n364\n00:23:07.711 --> 00:23:09.465\nAnd within the CSI shown,\n\n365\n00:23:09.465 --> 00:23:14.330\nyou will see an example of our vision\nto metrics tree, which will explain\n\n366\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:19.170\nthis a little bit in a little bit\nmore of a simplistic way for you.\n\n367\n00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.943\nBut what you see here is just exactly what\nI've just said to you is that we have our\n\n368\n00:23:23.943 --> 00:23:26.153\nindividual component metrics, and\n\n369\n00:23:26.153 --> 00:23:30.306\nwe combine that with our process\nmetrics here on the right hand side.\n\n370\n00:23:30.306 --> 00:23:34.910\nAnd we'll also add in our service\nmetric such as our service\n\n371\n00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.044\nlevel agreement monitoring metrics and\n\n372\n00:23:38.044 --> 00:23:43.681\nincluding our voice of the customer,\ncustomer satisfaction metrics.\n\n373\n00:23:43.681 --> 00:23:48.541\nAnd all of those combined will tell\nme how that particular service is\n\n374\n00:23:48.541 --> 00:23:53.500\nperforming in terms of our objectives for\nthat individual service.\n\n375\n00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.077\nAnd they should then feed\ninto the business objectives.\n\n376\n00:23:57.077 --> 00:24:01.206\nNow what I do want you to note\nthough from this particular diagram,\n\n377\n00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:06.780\nIs that you will see four little,\nI don't know, I guess they're pie charts.\n\n378\n00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.630\nThey don't look like pie charts too much\nto me though because there's no pie there\n\n379\n00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:11.820\nto be eaten.\n\n380\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.150\nAnd there is no pie that has been eaten.\n\n381\n00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:20.170\nSo I think that they're possibly trying\nto be some form of maybe I don't know,\n\n382\n00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.960\nsome form of dashboard.\n\n383\n00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:28.430\nAnyway, what you do have there though\nis what we call a balanced scorecard.\n\n384\n00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.220\nAnd a balanced scorecard\nlooks at our reporting and\n\n385\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:37.040\nlooks at our metrics from four different\naspects from the customer perspective,\n\n386\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.750\nfrom the business perspective,\nfrom innovation perspective.\n\n387\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.070\nIn other words, what's new?\n\n388\n00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.360\nWhat's coming up?\n\n389\n00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.950\nAnd from a financial perspective.\n\n390\n00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.100\nHow we're performing against our money.\n\n391\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.780\nSo what you have there is representation\nof all four of those elements.\n\n392\n00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.500\nAnd they should appear\nin all of our metrics.\n\n393\n00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.420\nIn all of our metrics there should\nbe something that tells us what our\n\n394\n00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.100\ncustomers want to see.\n\n395\n00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.360\nSomething that tells us what relates\nto our business objective achievement.\n\n396\n00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.470\nSomething that tells us what's coming up\nin the future and something that tells us\n\n397\n00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:16.260\nhow we are performing against our budgets,\nso in other words an accounting metric.\n\n398\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.730\nSo this is what we design.\n\n399\n00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.800\nWe design those five aspects.\n\n400\n00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.700\nRemember we design our service solution.\n\n401\n00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.770\nWe design our metrics\nas we've just covered.\n\n402\n00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:34.800\nWe design our architectures,\nboth our management architectures and our,\n\n403\n00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:39.980\nwhat was I going to say,\nour network topology.\n\n404\n00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:47.060\nWe design our processes and\nwe design, what did I cover there?\n\n405\n00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.290\nI covered the server.\n\n406\n00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.600\nI covered the, tools.\n\n407\n00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.440\nNo, we design our tools.\n\n408\n00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:57.120\nSo all of those sources are going to\nhelp us deliver on that new server.\n\n409\n00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.020\nSo, that's it for this particular episode.\n\n410\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.050\nAnd, when we come back to our next\nepisode we will be carrying on\n\n411\n00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.540\nwith our service design principles.\n\n412\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.708\nBut, for now, what I'd like you to do\nis just to go on through again the five\n\n413\n00:26:10.708 --> 00:26:15.322\naspects of service design and\nlook at what we have designed so far.\n\n414\n00:26:15.322 --> 00:26:19.252\nAnd if you have any queries about that,\nthen please feel free to come back to us\n\n415\n00:26:19.252 --> 00:26:23.590\non our forum and we'll be happy to\nanswer any queries you might have.\n\n416\n00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:24.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n417\n00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:28.080\nWell, thank you again for helping us\nto see so much more that's packed into\n\n418\n00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.170\nthe words that we just took\na glimpse out of a previous episode.\n\n419\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.330\nAnd we're now seeing\nwhere they can expand and\n\n420\n00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:38.000\nwhere they do influence every area that\nwe have to consider when working and\n\n421\n00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.740\nwhen coming up with the idea\nof this service design.\n\n422\n00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.740\nThere's a lot more though to come, but\nthat is gonna be for another episode.\n\n423\n00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.870\nSo signing off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n424\n00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:50.900\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n425\n00:26:50.900 -->

00:00:27.117\n&gt;&gt; I'm good,\n\n14\n00:00:27.117 --> 00:00:30.870\nI've just had a huge meal, enough energy\nto really talk about service design.\n\n15\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.210\nYou know Ronnie got the luxury to talk\nabout it these first two episodes.\n\n16\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.823\nSo I may have to play a little catch up,\nbut that's okay guys.\n\n17\n00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:39.590\nI think you're already used\nto me asking crazy questions.\n\n18\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.270\nSo yeah, where are we gonna start?\n\n19\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.532\n&gt;&gt; And in the interim, in the break\nbetween part two and part three,\n\n20\n00:00:44.532 --> 00:00:48.446\nby the way, I happen to have got married\nbecause Ronnie always calls me Miss and\n\n21\n00:00:48.446 --> 00:00:49.701\nyou call me Mrs.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:51.087\n&gt;&gt; So no I didn't, okay?\n\n23\n00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:54.013\nJust so you know, no, I already was.\n\n24\n00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:56.007\nI think it's Ronny being polite,\nthat's what I think.\n\n25\n00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:57.224\n&gt;&gt; I think so too.\n[LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:58.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He's a little cutie.\n\n27\n00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:02.328\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyway.\n\n28\n00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:05.287\n&gt;&gt; That will go out.\n\n29\n00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:08.078\nLet's take a look at service design,\nshall we?\n\n30\n00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:11.600\n[LAUGH] Well as Cherokee said,\nwe're in service design principles.\n\n31\n00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.862\nWe're in a part three here, so\n\n32\n00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:19.082\nin our last two sessions we looked\nat the principles of service design.\n\n33\n00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:22.870\nAnd in fact our four Ps of service design,\nour people, process, products,\n\n34\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.960\nand partners.\n\n35\n00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.020\nAnd then we looked further into our\nfive aspects of service design.\n\n36\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.784\nThe five things that we design.\n\n37\n00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:32.690\nAnd in part two we expanded on those.\n\n38\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.380\nAnd now I'm gonna get\nback to a word that I\n\n39\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.520\nused in part one of our service design\nprinciples which is that word holistic.\n\n40\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.640\nAnd you can see it right on\nthe screen in front of you now.\n\n41\n00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.820\nIt's all about that holistic approach.\n\n42\n00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.680\nIt's ensuring that we\nconsider our four Ps.\n\n43\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620\nBut more importantly than that, and\n\n44\n00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.110\nI've already talked to this\nextensively in part one and part two.\n\n45\n00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.155\nWe have to consider absolutely\neverything that forms a service,\n\n46\n00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.860\nall of our service components.\n\n47\n00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.110\nBut also there are interactions.\n\n48\n00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.570\nWe cannot make any change to\nour infrastructure by bringing\n\n49\n00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.280\nin a new service without impacting\nanother portion of our infrastructure.\n\n50\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.570\nWe just simply can't.\n\n51\n00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.860\nAnd I also want to bring in items\nhere like right at the very,\n\n52\n00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.420\nvery bottom there,\nour security levels, for instance.\n\n53\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.830\nIf we're bringing in a service that\nhas a specific security level,\n\n54\n00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.690\nthen that may affect the security\nlevels of our other services.\n\n55\n00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.250\nLet's say that our organization,\njust for example,\n\n56\n00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.040\nwas not just expanding but\nactually transforming.\n\n57\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.060\nAnd we want to do something\ncompletely different.\n\n58\n00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.090\nThen in that instance,\nwe may need to amend our security levels.\n\n59\n00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.700\nI know of a certain group of companies,\nand I always use this an example.\n\n60\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.990\nThe Virgin Group of companies,\n\n61\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.429\nthey are a brilliant example of\nan organization that transforms.\n\n62\n00:03:02.442 --> 00:03:07.190\nNow the Virgin Group of companies\nuse a shared services model for\n\n63\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.330\ntheir IT service provision.\n\n64\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.110\nAnd so every time that\norganization transforms and\n\n65\n00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.870\ndoes something completely different and\n\n66\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.290\nbrings in a new partner maybe by\nacquisition or by franchisee etc.\n\n67\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.913\nEvery time they move into\na different industry sector,\n\n68\n00:03:27.913 --> 00:03:30.775\nthat IT service provider has to transform.\n\n69\n00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:32.835\nWhich means that as a service provider,\n\n70\n00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:36.170\nthey're bringing in\ndifferent security levels.\n\n71\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.510\nFor instance, we have the Virgin Atlantic.\n\n72\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.740\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about Richard Branson?\n\n73\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.520\n&gt;&gt; I'm talking Richard Branson, yes.\n\n74\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.910\nSo Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Atlantic\nobviously we know about them.\n\n75\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.124\nThey're airplanes across the Atlantic,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n76\n00:03:50.124 --> 00:03:51.868\nHow did they start?\nWas it records originally?\n\n77\n00:03:51.868 --> 00:03:54.438\nAnd then it kind of-\n&gt;&gt; I think it was airplanes but\n\n78\n00:03:54.438 --> 00:03:56.130\nit might have been records.\n\n79\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.785\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n80\n00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:57.796\n&gt;&gt; Really showing our age now.\n\n81\n00:03:57.796 --> 00:04:00.002\n&gt;&gt; Aren't they like going to space and\nstuff now?\n\n82\n00:04:00.002 --> 00:04:03.291\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well Virgin actually produce,\n\n83\n00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:06.770\nwell they do cell phones,\nso you have Virgin Mobile.\n\n84\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.930\nAnd we also have Virgin Finance.\n\n85\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.830\nVirgin actually do finance,\n\n86\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.665\nthey do credit cards, etc.,\nin Europe and throughout the UK as well.\n\n87\n00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:19.750\nVirgin are actually the biggest,\nI'm not too sure whether they're the only,\n\n88\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.830\nbut they are the biggest provider of\nfiber-optic networks in the UK as well.\n\n89\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.173\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n90\n00:04:26.173 --> 00:04:29.460\n&gt;&gt; So every time,\nthey do something different, and\n\n91\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.602\nas you said they are now\ninto aerospace as well.\n\n92\n00:04:32.602 --> 00:04:34.780\nNow if you take a look at their website,\n\n93\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.476\nI think they have well over a hundred\ndifferent organizations, or\n\n94\n00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:42.920\ndifferent companies within completely\ndifferent industry sectors.\n\n95\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.490\nAnd every time they diversify, they have\nto have different security requirements.\n\n96\n00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.660\nAnd so you think of their\nshared services organization,\n\n97\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.730\ntheir IT organization that\nsupports all of this and\n\n98\n00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.510\nthe diverse skills that that\nIT organization has to have.\n\n99\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.980\nBut then you think about every\ntime they bring in a new service,\n\n100\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.250\nthat will impact on their infrastructure.\n\n101\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.340\nNow luckily, in the UK they provide\ntheir own fiber optic cabling, so\n\n102\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.490\nthat's fantastic.\n\n103\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.930\nBut nevertheless, as a service provider,\n\n104\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.180\nthe IT service provider obviously\nhas a lot to keep up with.\n\n105\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.760\nAnd so we have to make sure that,\nin that particular environment,\n\n106\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.220\nservice design is done very,\nvery effectively and efficiently.\n\n107\n00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.780\nAnd that we look at service design\nfrom a holistic perspective,\n\n108\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.200\nincluding all of those elements that\nyou have listed in front of you.\n\n109\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.500\nAnd everything that we have covered\nin the last two episodes too.\n\n110\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.140\nSo I do actually like this diagram and\nI know that there is feedback that\n\n111\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.430\na lot of these diagrams can be\na little bit busy should we say.\n\n112\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.670\nBut let's start off right in\nthe middle here with our services,\n\n113\n00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.030\nservices A, B, and C.\n\n114\n00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.738\nNow for every single service that\nappears in our service pipeline or\n\n115\n00:05:59.738 --> 00:06:02.143\nin our service portfolio rather.\n\n116\n00:06:02.143 --> 00:06:06.539\nFor every single service we should have\na service level agreement attached to that\n\n117\n00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.480\nservice.\n\n118\n00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.410\nAnd every single service should\nbe articulated in the catalog,\n\n119\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.140\nin terms of the business\nprocess that it facilitates.\n\n120\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.000\nBut, underneath every single service\n\n121\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.320\nwe should have all of our\nunderpinning services.\n\n122\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.060\nAnd our underpinning services\ninclude things like our software and\n\n123\n00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.880\nour hardware, also our infrastructure\nis an underpinning service.\n\n124\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.940\nAnd don't forget all of the environments,\nthe databases, etc that these sit on.\n\n125\n00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.810\nAnd so we may have supporting\nservices with suppliers.\n\n126\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.880\nAnd we might have some that are supported\ninternally within our own IT teams.\n\n127\n00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.000\nSo we do actually have,\nwhen you think about this,\n\n128\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.120\nquite a diverse set of relationships\nbetween all of our services.\n\n129\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.140\nAnd every time we bring in a new service\nwe have to think about this topology and\n\n130\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.940\nexactly where that service will fit.\n\n131\n00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.660\nBut also what the relationships\nare already impacts could be.\n\n132\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.790\nBecause no service can be designed and\ntransitioned in isolation.\n\n133\n00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.551\nWe don't start off with a blank\npiece of paper anymore.\n\n134\n00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:18.250\nNow of course and\nI'm gonna go back to this previous slide.\n\n135\n00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.405\nIf I look at the bottom here,\n\n136\n00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:22.970\nI've got three different suppliers\nthere in this particular example.\n\n137\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.815\nBut as it says in that bottom bullet point\nthere where we've got multiple external\n\n138\n00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:33.453\nproviders, external service providers,\nthen things can get quite tricky.\n\n139\n00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.630\nBecause we're talking about contracts and\n\n140\n00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.840\nwe're talking about\nlegally binding contracts.\n\n141\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.941\nAnd those contracts and all of our\nservice level agreements internally,\n\n142\n00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:46.330\nwell we have to consider every\nsingle aspect of the service.\n\n143\n00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.730\nIncluding the four technology\ndomains as we like to call them,\n\n144\n00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.798\nthat are going to contribute\nto the overall I don't like,\n\n145\n00:07:54.798 --> 00:08:00.042\nperformance I guess that's the right word,\nbut the overall activities.\n\n146\n00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:03.210\nAbsolutely everything that\nhappens within a service.\n\n147\n00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.780\nAnd it's not just about performance but\nit's also about maintainability and\n\n148\n00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.730\nit's about being able to\nsupport that service as well.\n\n149\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.904\nSo let's just break those down very,\nvery briefly.\n\n150\n00:08:13.904 --> 00:08:18.886\nWe've got to ensure that we\ncan accommodate in our designs\n\n151\n00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:22.049\nany changes to our infrastructure.\n\n152\n00:08:22.049 --> 00:08:25.418\nAnd I've already mentioned\nchanges to our environment.\n\n153\n00:08:25.418 --> 00:08:29.525\nAnd this is things like the things\nthat easily get forgotten like the air\n\n154\n00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:31.587\nconditioning in our server rooms.\n\n155\n00:08:31.587 --> 00:08:35.235\nAnd making sure we've got enough\nelectrical outlets in our server rooms.\n\n156\n00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:40.511\nAnd making sure that our UPS our\nuniterrruptable power supply\n\n157\n00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:45.700\ncan accommodate any new servers and\nany new hardware.\n\n158\n00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.980\nAnd then think about our data.\n\n159\n00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.006\nThink about the increase in data and\n\n160\n00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:52.122\nthink about how we're going\nto store all of that data.\n\n161\n00:08:52.122 --> 00:08:54.540\nAnd what about archiving that data?\n\n162\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.584\nAnd what about data retention policies and\nbackups, etc.\n\n163\n00:08:58.584 --> 00:09:02.552\nAnd then, of course, there's applications\nand with any application, you know what?\n\n164\n00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:04.272\nWe need licensing.\n\n165\n00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:06.609\nNow that's very obvious that you might,\n\n166\n00:09:06.609 --> 00:09:11.161\nwell okay we need to buy a new additional\nlicensing for that individual service.\n\n167\n00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:16.972\nYes you might, but what about if you need\nadditional operating system licenses?\n\n168\n00:09:16.972 --> 00:09:22.105\nYou brought a new service and\nyou brought in, maybe a new team within\n\n169\n00:09:22.105 --> 00:09:28.260\nthe organization to accommodate that\nnew service or to use that new service.\n\n170\n00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.730\nAnd now all of a sudden you'll need\nnew operating system licenses as well.\n\n171\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:40.620\nSo in our business requirement stage,\nthe business case has been approved.\n\n172\n00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.840\nThis was approved at the end\nof service strategy.\n\n173\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.270\nAnd so in our business requirements stage,\n\n174\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.510\nwe're going to literally\nagree on the requirements.\n\n175\n00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.393\nWe're going to agree\nthe statement of requirements and\n\n176\n00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:58.082\nwe're going to take a look at\nthe service acceptance criteria as well.\n\n177\n00:09:58.082 --> 00:10:02.260\nSo we're going to have\na project manager appointed.\n\n178\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:07.100\nWe're going to ensure that we\nidentify all of our stakeholders and\n\n179\n00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.350\nthat we understand how much money we've\ngot, we understand exactly when that new\n\n180\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.450\nservice is going to be delivered,\nis going to be required by.\n\n181\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.160\nAnd we understand who's\ngoing to sign it off and\n\n182\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.140\nwe understand how we're going\nto engage our customers.\n\n183\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.490\nAt the end of the service\ndesign lifecycle phase,\n\n184\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.930\nthat's when we have finished designing.\n\n185\n00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.580\nAnd we complete our service\ndesign package, and\n\n186\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:39.120\nthen we move into transition,\nwe move into building.\n\n187\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.060\nWe don't accommodate scope creep.\n\n188\n00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.340\nOnce it's been signed off,\n\n189\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.290\nit's been signed off and\nanything else then is version two.\n\n190\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.140\nSo service design is when we\ncheck that box is when we\n\n191\n00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.760\ncomplete this design package.\n\n192\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.780\nThis is what happens and\nthen we move into service transition.\n\n193\n00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.240\nSo service orientated architecture.\n\n194\n00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:11.180\nWell, it's considered to be best practice\nby ensuring that all of our services,\n\n195\n00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:16.240\nwell, they're reuseable,\nthat we don't just think in silos.\n\n196\n00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.590\nIn terms of bringing in\nindividual services that we\n\n197\n00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.830\nthink about the relationships\nbetween our services and\n\n198\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.870\nwe think about where we can\nshare common activities.\n\n199\n00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:32.680\nSo that includes things like, I mentioned\nin a previous episode about databases for\n\n200\n00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.600\ninstance, and about having virtual\nstorage in our databases and\n\n201\n00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.140\nwe might only have one physical server,\nbut we might have three or\n\n202\n00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:45.150\nfour virtual servers that actually\nsit on that one physical server.\n\n203\n00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:49.950\nWe might have three or four databases\nthat sit on that one physical server\n\n204\n00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:54.400\nwhere we keep various data\nfrom various services.\n\n205\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.810\nThink about where we can share not\njust our physical resources, but\n\n206\n00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:04.280\nwhere we can share our virtual,\nor our logical resources as well.\n\n207\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.705\nSo we want to incorporate, we want\nWant to encourage a modular approach.\n\n208\n00:12:09.705 --> 00:12:14.542\nWell, we have functionality that meets\nthe need of not just one service,\n\n209\n00:12:14.542 --> 00:12:16.971\nbut meets the need of many services.\n\n210\n00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:22.773\nAnd by doing this, by incorporating\na flexible approach by incorporating\n\n211\n00:12:22.773 --> 00:12:28.951\nrelationships between services and\nby incorporating shared functionality.\n\n212\n00:12:28.951 --> 00:12:33.719\nThen it means that we can actually\nbe quicker to market as we deliver\n\n213\n00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.610\nnew solutions.\n\n214\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.010\nAnd quite often nowadays a lot of our\n\n215\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.110\ntop providers most certainly\nwithin IT working that way.\n\n216\n00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.150\nAnd they work in the way\nof a modular system and\n\n217\n00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:51.110\nwhen we go to a service provider we\nactually provide one modular at a time or\n\n218\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.442\nwe purchase one modular at a time.\n\n219\n00:12:53.442 --> 00:12:56.150\nSo we might purchase incident and\nproblem management.\n\n220\n00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.550\nAnd then we'll purchase change management,\nand then we'll purchase release and\n\n221\n00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.670\ndeployment management.\n\n222\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.262\nAnd so as we implement ITIL,\n\n223\n00:13:03.262 --> 00:13:07.500\nwe're actually purchasing\nthe tool module by module.\n\n224\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:13.560\nThat's how we like to do it, it certainly\nworks out better in terms of integration,\n\n225\n00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:19.070\nbut it also works out better in terms of\nefficiency and effectiveness as well okay.\n\n226\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.070\nSo what we have to be able to\ndo is we have to be able to\n\n227\n00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.530\ndetermine what a service is.\n\n228\n00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.290\nWe have to articulate that service.\n\n229\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.300\nBut we also have to understand\nwhere we can share data,\n\n230\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.960\nwhere we can share some of our processes.\n\n231\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.561\nWhere we can share our work flows.\n\n232\n00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:43.395\nWe know that incidents, and\nproblem management, and change management,\n\n233\n00:13:43.395 --> 00:13:48.200\nand request fulfillment,\nthey require a work flow process engine.\n\n234\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.910\nIn which case we can share that workflow\nprocess engine but we also know that all\n\n235\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:58.950\nof those processes require a database\nof all of our service assets.\n\n236\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.751\nWell, if we share the data with\na configuration management system\n\n237\n00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:08.811\nwhich is our single source of accurate and\nreliable information about\n\n238\n00:14:08.811 --> 00:14:13.543\nall of our assets and all of our\ncomponents services, or our CIs.\n\n239\n00:14:13.543 --> 00:14:17.403\nThen we not only got\nthe relationships in place,\n\n240\n00:14:17.403 --> 00:14:22.393\nnot only have we got that module or\napproach, but we also have,\n\n241\n00:14:22.393 --> 00:14:28.920\nefficiency and that will enable us\nto achieve that effectiveness also.\n\n242\n00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.550\nSo using that common tool set\nwithin our IT organization also\n\n243\n00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:40.480\nallows us to be more efficient in terms of\ntraining and in terms of staff resources.\n\n244\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.010\nBecause you see you've got\nthat intuitiveness there too\n\n245\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.510\nthat everything works in the same way.\n\n246\n00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.860\nWe've got that common language.\n\n247\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.070\nWe've got that common way of working.\n\n248\n00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:59.373\nSo what we have to do is we have to create\na model for design in our services.\n\n249\n00:14:59.373 --> 00:15:01.891\nAnd it includes all of\nthe business drivers.\n\n250\n00:15:01.891 --> 00:15:05.150\nIt includes our own capabilities.\n\n251\n00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:09.570\nIt includes our own culture and\nour own organization.\n\n252\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:14.151\nSo we have to have a really good\npicture of where we are right now.\n\n253\n00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:17.392\nAnd that sounds like I'm\nbringing in that CSI approach.\n\n254\n00:15:17.392 --> 00:15:19.580\nAnd I am bringing in that CSI approach.\n\n255\n00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.610\nNow you looked at this in\nyour foundation material.\n\n256\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.350\nYou also looked at this\nin your CSI show too.\n\n257\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.595\nAnd the CSI approach is something that\nwe use for implementing everything.\n\n258\n00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:35.415\nAnd if we are implementing a design model,\nthen we certainly going to work\n\n259\n00:15:35.415 --> 00:15:39.243\nout exactly what we want to achieve,\nwhat is that vision?\n\n260\n00:15:39.243 --> 00:15:41.263\nAnd then look at where we are right now,\n\n261\n00:15:41.263 --> 00:15:45.258\nand this is where we do that assessment\nof our organization or culture, etc.\n\n262\n00:15:45.258 --> 00:15:50.514\nAnd then we can plan exactly\nhow we want to get there.\n\n263\n00:15:50.514 --> 00:15:53.202\nAnd we'll do this for any single project.\n\n264\n00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:54.302\nEvery project.\n\n265\n00:15:54.302 --> 00:15:57.815\nWe want to understand exactly\nwhere we want to be and\n\n266\n00:15:57.815 --> 00:16:01.680\nhow we get there, that's our project plan.\n\n267\n00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.460\nAlso including all of our\nrelationships as we say.\n\n268\n00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.420\nSo, how do we get there?\n\n269\n00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.540\nWhat options are available to us?\n\n270\n00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.582\nWell, we have insourcing.\n\n271\n00:16:13.582 --> 00:16:15.650\nInsourcing is an option.\n\n272\n00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:22.660\nWell that means that we will develop\nour new service ourself, in-house.\n\n273\n00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.640\nOutsourcing, we go outside.\n\n274\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.280\nOkay we use somebody else,\nwe use an external service provider.\n\n275\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.378\nAnd there's co-sourcing which it says\nthere is a combination of insourcing and\n\n276\n00:16:34.378 --> 00:16:35.460\noutsourcing.\n\n277\n00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.320\nIn other words we work\ntogether with the supplier.\n\n278\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.250\nAnd a supplier will provide\nus with certain elements and\n\n279\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.920\nwe'll able to do other elements.\n\n280\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.870\nThat is what we call co-sourcing.\n\n281\n00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.440\nThere's also partnership or\nmulti-sourcing.\n\n282\n00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.110\nWhere we will work hand in hand with\nsomebody that is doing something very very\n\n283\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.980\nsimilar to us.\n\n284\n00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.850\nAnd they will do one element and\nwe will do another and\n\n285\n00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.360\nwe will both share that service\nbecause it will benefit both of us.\n\n286\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.979\nSlightly different to\nwhat we call co-sourcing.\n\n287\n00:17:04.979 --> 00:17:10.320\nCo-sourcing is where we're using\na supplier to supply some elements.\n\n288\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:16.090\nAnd we're developing other elements but\nessentially the service belongs to us.\n\n289\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:21.900\nWhereas partnership or\nmulti-sourcing we're both defining and\n\n290\n00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.420\ndeveloping elements of that same service,\nbut\n\n291\n00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.910\nthat service then belongs to\nboth of us at the end of it.\n\n292\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.840\nThis is not something that's\njust completely owned by us.\n\n293\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.990\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, how would that relationship\nbe handled if there was some kind of\n\n294\n00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.920\nbreak up per se of that relationship?\n\n295\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:46.360\n&gt;&gt; That one's a very tricky one to be fair\nand it's something that it utilized very\n\n296\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.900\noften within government organizations,\nwithin military and public sector.\n\n297\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.500\nWe would do that sort of thing.\n\n298\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.590\nSo for instance if we\nare looking at record management\n\n299\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.000\nthen it's quite possible that\nour public library system.\n\n300\n00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.080\nWhere we might actually\nshare that information and\n\n301\n00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.060\nshare that workload,\nwith say our school system as well.\n\n302\n00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.890\nSo that they're working together and\nwe both share that.\n\n303\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.920\nAnd there are no,\nonce there are contracts in place,\n\n304\n00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.890\nit's not something that\nis too much of an issue.\n\n305\n00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.630\nI have seen this in use\namongst competitors.\n\n306\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:26.240\nWhen it comes to what we call\nservice continuity management.\n\n307\n00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.300\nIt's something that used\nto happen a long time ago.\n\n308\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.560\nBut it's not something that\nhappens too much now a days.\n\n309\n00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.000\nBut then of course as we move in towards\ncloud technology And we're moving as well\n\n310\n00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.370\ntowards a lot of applications\nthat are free on the Internet,\n\n311\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:44.130\nthat you can download a lot of free stuff,\nthat we can all use.\n\n312\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.520\nThen this is again something that's,\nit kind of went through a good phase of\n\n313\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.890\nbeing really popular and then died off and\nnow I see this coming back again.\n\n314\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.600\nBut we've gotta be very careful and\n\n315\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.820\nI think the thing that we gotta be\nincredibly careful about is our data.\n\n316\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.600\nAnd make sure that even if we're\ndeveloping applications together that\n\n317\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.590\nwe retain ownership of our own data.\n\n318\n00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:10.200\nAnd we don't actually give\nanything away that is proprietary.\n\n319\n00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay, makes sense.\n\n320\n00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.210\n&gt;&gt; And then we've got this business\nprocess outsourcing which is where we\n\n321\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:21.120\nwould as it says there relocate an entire\nbusiness function to somebody else,\n\n322\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.140\noutsource in there.\n\n323\n00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.950\nSometimes we do that\nwith our service desk.\n\n324\n00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.630\nThat's very popular.\n\n325\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.950\nBut we also do that with things\nlike accounting or payroll or\n\n326\n00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.640\nmaybe HR function.\n\n327\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.820\n&gt;&gt; Something you just mentioned,\nwith the cloud services.\n\n328\n00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.985\nThat's huge right now.\n\n329\n00:19:32.985 --> 00:19:34.285\nIt is, yeah yeah.\n\n330\n00:19:34.285 --> 00:19:39.562\nThis is becoming more and more popular\nto do this, to actually give certain\n\n331\n00:19:39.562 --> 00:19:45.867\nfunctions to organizations that specialize\nwithin that particular functional arena.\n\n332\n00:19:45.867 --> 00:19:49.574\nSo like I said service desk would give\nthat to somebody who specialized in\n\n333\n00:19:49.574 --> 00:19:50.695\nservice desk.\n\n334\n00:19:50.695 --> 00:19:53.723\nBecause especially,\nthink about the scale of the organization,\n\n335\n00:19:53.723 --> 00:19:57.578\nwith a large scale organization you're\nmore likely to have everything in-house.\n\n336\n00:19:57.578 --> 00:20:02.072\nWith the small organization,\nwell if we were to have a service desk,\n\n337\n00:20:02.072 --> 00:20:07.460\nsay we were an organization that was\njust 500 people in the organization.\n\n338\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.390\nIf we were to have our own service\ndesk that means that we have to\n\n339\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.035\nhave not only the people but we also also\nhave to have the tools that they use.\n\n340\n00:20:14.035 --> 00:20:18.325\nWe have to have remote desktop tools,\nwe have to have call login tools.\n\n341\n00:20:18.325 --> 00:20:20.865\nAnd we have to pay licenses for\nall of these tools, and\n\n342\n00:20:20.865 --> 00:20:23.435\nwe have to keep all of these\npeople trained as well.\n\n343\n00:20:23.435 --> 00:20:28.515\nAnd you might have to pay sort of holiday\npay or vacation pay for these people.\n\n344\n00:20:28.515 --> 00:20:32.595\nDepending on where you're located you\nmight have to pay sort health insurance\n\n345\n00:20:32.595 --> 00:20:34.200\nand things like that as well.\n\n346\n00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.840\nWell, much better and much more efficient\nfor an organization at that sort\n\n347\n00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.210\nof scale would be to outsource\nthat particular activity.\n\n348\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.110\nWhereas when you're in\na large organization,\n\n349\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.920\nyou're more likely to hand that in-house.\n\n350\n00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.826\nSo you've gotta think about scalability\nand think about efficiencies too.\n\n351\n00:20:52.826 --> 00:20:57.060\nAnd then we've also got\napplication service provision.\n\n352\n00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.325\nWhich means that sort of\nsoftware as a service, really.\n\n353\n00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:04.948\nThat's where we go out and we'll use,\nwe're moving into cloud nowadays where\n\n354\n00:21:04.948 --> 00:21:08.830\nwe'll go outside and\nwe will use somebody else's service.\n\n355\n00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.280\nAgain you've got to think about\nwhere your data is kept, and\n\n356\n00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:19.000\nif you're using application service you're\nusing an ASP then think about your data.\n\n357\n00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.120\nBecause are you storing\nyour data on their servers?\n\n358\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.346\nIf you are, what about security breaches?\n\n359\n00:21:26.346 --> 00:21:30.040\nWhat about data protection etc.\n\n360\n00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.569\nOr if you're storing data\nhere on our services,\n\n361\n00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:38.300\non our own services then\nwhat happens about upgrades?\n\n362\n00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.500\nBecause if we're storing data somewhere\nhere then it needs to be on a database and\n\n363\n00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.980\nthere has to be some form of\noperating system on that database and\n\n364\n00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.100\nsome form of client\nsoftware on that database.\n\n365\n00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.035\nWell, what happens if we're\noutsourcing the application and\n\n366\n00:21:53.035 --> 00:21:56.410\nthey update and\nthey don't update our database.\n\n367\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.010\nOr we don't update our database\nwhere our data is stored.\n\n368\n00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.400\nCompatibility courses an issue there but\n\n369\n00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.250\nwe've gotta be very, very clear about\ndata protection and data ownership too.\n\n370\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:12.680\nIn some countries around the world data is\nsold on, and your personal data is sold.\n\n371\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Of course it is.\n\n372\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's not in a lot\nof countries around the world.\n\n373\n00:22:16.945 --> 00:22:19.055\nWell, it's not legal to do so.\n\n374\n00:22:19.055 --> 00:22:21.405\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So you've got to be very careful.\n\n375\n00:22:21.405 --> 00:22:25.885\nAgain, especially when we talk about\napplication outsourcing, and we talk about\n\n376\n00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:30.300\ncloud computing, you've got to be very,\nvery careful about what country you're in.\n\n377\n00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.815\nAnd what country your\nservice provider is in too.\n\n378\n00:22:32.815 --> 00:22:36.200\n&gt;&gt; Jo, that's so true,\nbecause we also need to think about what\n\n379\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.200\ncountry the data's\nactually being stored in.\n\n380\n00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.140\nYou see a lot of these more\ngreen data centers being kept\n\n381\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.340\nin these unoccupied cooler regions.\n\n382\n00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.500\nBut are you really familiar\nwith that regions laws?\n\n383\n00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.360\nAnd that risk doesn't go away because\nyou're giving to someone else,\n\n384\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.920\nit's just being handed off.\n\n385\n00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:00.634\nSo the risk still exists and\nyou need to be aware how that provider.\n\n386\n00:23:00.634 --> 00:23:03.523\nWhat I'm trying to say here is just\nwhere that line of responsibility is.\n\n387\n00:23:03.523 --> 00:23:06.456\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess with clear documentation and\n\n388\n00:23:06.456 --> 00:23:10.560\ncontracts to outline those\nresponsibilities is really the best\n\n389\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.512\nsolution in this situation aside\nfrom keeping it in-house so\n\n390\n00:23:14.512 --> 00:23:17.022\nyou could have 100% full control.\n\n391\n00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:19.405\n&gt;&gt; I think what you've got to be very,\nvery careful of, and\n\n392\n00:23:19.405 --> 00:23:20.993\nI say to all of my clients all the time,\n\n393\n00:23:20.993 --> 00:23:23.840\nis you've got to be incredibly\ncareful of where you keep your data.\n\n394\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.465\nAnd you've got to appreciate the fact\nthat just because you have one\n\n395\n00:23:28.465 --> 00:23:32.606\nparticular law in your company\ndoesn't mean that these laws\n\n396\n00:23:32.606 --> 00:23:36.750\nexist outside of your\ncountry because they don't.\n\n397\n00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.620\nNow it so\nhappens that in Europe we've got very,\n\n398\n00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:44.770\nvery strict data protection laws, much\nstricter than they are here in the US.\n\n399\n00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n400\n00:23:45.615 --> 00:23:50.387\n&gt;&gt; And so you know, if you're handing\nyour data over to a company somewhere in\n\n401\n00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:55.234\nEurope Then actually, you can be more\nassured of your data than we can here,\n\n402\n00:23:55.234 --> 00:23:59.430\nwhere it's perfectly legal for\norganizations to sell our data.\n\n403\n00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.630\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a good point,\nthe legal ramifications.\n\n404\n00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:08.180\nBecause here in the States, you don't\nhave that legality backing you up.\n\n405\n00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.750\nOkay, so maybe a company does go under and\n\n406\n00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.470\nthey're housing all of\nyour customer information.\n\n407\n00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.774\nWell, if they go under you\ncan try to sue them, but\n\n408\n00:24:16.774 --> 00:24:19.304\nwhat are you gonna get back from them?\n\n409\n00:24:19.304 --> 00:24:22.580\nIf they've already gone under, you've\nalready lost that customer reputation.\n\n410\n00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.165\nAnd you're probably not gonna be\ngetting those customers back, so\n\n411\n00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:28.190\nit is definitely something to thing about.\n\n412\n00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.590\n&gt;&gt; Well also think about your data,\ngo back to this data situation again.\n\n413\n00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.820\nSo let's say that you've got ASP.\n\n414\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.376\nYou've out sourced and they have\nall of your data and they go under.\n\n415\n00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:41.915\nWhat happens to that data?\n\n416\n00:24:41.915 --> 00:24:45.815\nIt's sat on a database somewhere,\nit sat in a server somewhere.\n\n417\n00:24:45.815 --> 00:24:48.925\nThat company has gone bust,\nas we like to say.\n\n418\n00:24:48.925 --> 00:24:49.820\n&gt;&gt; Gone bust, I like it.\n\n419\n00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.255\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gone bust, so\n\n420\n00:24:51.255 --> 00:24:53.610\nthere's nobody working there.\n\n421\n00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:58.202\nYou're not going to be able to persuade\nanybody to go into that organization\n\n422\n00:24:58.202 --> 00:25:03.081\nbecause in that instance the auditors have\nprobably seized all the assets to that\n\n423\n00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:03.743\ncompany.\n\n424\n00:25:03.743 --> 00:25:07.729\nThere's no one to physically access those\nservices to get your data off for you and\n\n425\n00:25:07.729 --> 00:25:11.370\ncertainly you're not gonna be able to\npersuade any of the former employees\n\n426\n00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.824\nto do that because they're\nno longer being paid.\n\n427\n00:25:13.824 --> 00:25:15.504\n&gt;&gt; They don't have their retirement or\nanything anymore.\n\n428\n00:25:15.504 --> 00:25:18.509\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah,\nthey're no longer being paid and so\n\n429\n00:25:18.509 --> 00:25:20.868\nthat really causes a problem for you.\n\n430\n00:25:20.868 --> 00:25:25.642\nAnd so you have to ensure that you have\nthe contracts is in place to cover you\n\n431\n00:25:25.642 --> 00:25:27.960\nshould anything like that happen.\n\n432\n00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.500\nWe don't like to think about\nthings like that happen.\n\n433\n00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.670\nBut I have seen organizations where\nthey've lost not only their customers, but\n\n434\n00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:40.970\nthey've lost entire swaths of their\ndata because of something like this.\n\n435\n00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.590\nAnd once you've lost your data and you've\nlost all of your proprietary information,\n\n436\n00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.710\nthen it's very,\nvery difficult to gain it back, and.\n\n437\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:51.840\nOne ISP organization could go bust,\nand that could actually\n\n438\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.150\nhave a detrimental effect on\nyour organization too, and\n\n439\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.080\nnot just a detrimental effect but\na devastating effect on your organization.\n\n440\n00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:06.070\nSo we have to be very, very careful\nabout what we do with our data and\n\n441\n00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.890\nwhere we keep our data.\n\n442\n00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:12.652\nAnd I would always recommend that with any\norganization if we doing something like\n\n443\n00:26:12.652 --> 00:26:16.680\nsoftware as service etcetera when\nyou're outsourcing in that way.\n\n444\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.300\nYou should always keep a copy\nof your data yourself.\n\n445\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:26.470\nYou should always keep a back up yourself\nthat is stored somewhere offsite that\n\n446\n00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.170\nyou can have access to it.\n\n447\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:32.600\nOr you ensure that there is provision\nthere in the instance that you will\n\n448\n00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.810\nnot be able to get access to\nyour data via normal means.\n\n449\n00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:41.620\nAnd then that leads us into then this\nlast particular type of sourcing,\n\n450\n00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.920\nwhich is knowledge process outsourcing.\n\n451\n00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.382\nAs it says here,\nit's the newest form of outsourcing.\n\n452\n00:26:48.382 --> 00:26:51.710\nAnd I think you have a title for\nme, isn't it?\n\n453\n00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.470\nDon't you call be an SME or\nsomething like that?\n\n454\n00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.280\n&gt;&gt; External Subject Matter Expert.\n\n455\n00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.315\n&gt;&gt; There we go, yeah,\nan Ex SME, that's even scarier.\n\n456\n00:27:00.315 --> 00:27:03.720\n[LAUGH] Yeah, and\nthat's exactly what this is.\n\n457\n00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.330\nKnowledge process outsourcing,\n\n458\n00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.240\nit's where you work knowledge\nwithin your organization.\n\n459\n00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.530\nThat you need some knowledge maybe for\na temporary basis or\n\n460\n00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.969\nmaybe it's something that\nreally you don't want to invest\n\n461\n00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.160\nIn training somebody\ninternally to be able to do.\n\n462\n00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.265\n&gt;&gt; We always want to invest in you Jo.\n\n463\n00:27:22.265 --> 00:27:25.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm flattered or\nscared, I'm not sure which.\n\n464\n00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.270\nBut, you know, we don't want to\ninvest in somebody internally, so\n\n465\n00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:36.210\nwe want to bring somebody in Just\nto impart their knowledge or to\n\n466\n00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:41.390\nset up a specific process or maybe to run\na process for us, because we acknowledge\n\n467\n00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.850\nthat they actually have better skills and\nbetter experience than we do in house.\n\n468\n00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:50.230\nAnd this is what we call knowledge\nprocess outsourcing, just simply this.\n\n469\n00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:56.910\nSo, these are all options available to\nus for sourcing for our service design.\n\n470\n00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.860\nThere are many different\ncombinations of sourcing.\n\n471\n00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.025\nAnd it's not really down to me\nto tell you which way is best.\n\n472\n00:28:05.025 --> 00:28:07.835\nI mean obviously we can come\ninto your organisation and\n\n473\n00:28:07.835 --> 00:28:11.485\nI can advice you which way is best\nin your given circumstance, but\n\n474\n00:28:11.485 --> 00:28:14.515\nI can't tell you the right way or\nthe wrong way from here.\n\n475\n00:28:14.515 --> 00:28:17.705\nThere's no one size fits all approaches,\nI keep saying.\n\n476\n00:28:17.705 --> 00:28:22.440\nIt's up to you to mix and match and\nfind out what works best for you, but\n\n477\n00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.660\nultimately what you're doing is delivering\nvalue to your organization, delivering\n\n478\n00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:31.620\nvalue to your business so you have to\ndo what best meets their requirements.\n\n479\n00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.435\nNow, we've reached the end of our\nservice design principles episodes.\n\n480\n00:28:37.435 --> 00:28:42.595\nAnd so now what I'd like you to do is\nto download your printed information.\n\n481\n00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:46.345\nAnd you have an exercise in there that\nlooks at our service design principles.\n\n482\n00:28:46.345 --> 00:28:50.335\nThat's going to take you around\nabout an hour and a half to do.\n\n483\n00:28:50.335 --> 00:28:53.915\nSo that's 90 minutes to\nundertake that exercise.\n\n484\n00:28:53.915 --> 00:28:56.035\nSo I'd like you to go away and\n\n485\n00:28:56.035 --> 00:29:00.180\nto undertake that exercise\nat your own leisure.\n\n486\n00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.010\nAnd as Cherokee has said to me\nnumerous times before right,\n\n487\n00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:07.030\nthis is not about doing jumping\njacks in the corner of the room.\n\n488\n00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:11.580\nOkay this is about testing your mental\nagility and what you've learned so far.\n\n489\n00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:17.180\nAnd if you have any queries on these\nparticular exercises then please feel free\n\n490\n00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.270\nto join us in the forum and we will be\nhappy to help you out as best as we can,\n\n491\n00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.510\n&gt;&gt; Like always Joan, thank you for\n\n492\n00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.740\nbeing here, it was a pleasure.\n\n493\n00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.380\nIt was great with you here too but\ndon't go anywhere,\n\n494\n00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.350\nwe have more shows heading your way.\n\n495\n00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.454\nWe'llll go ahead and sign out to remember\nI've been your host Cherokee Booth.\n\n496\n00:29:31.454 --> 00:29:32.180\n&gt;&gt; And I am Jo Peacock.\n\n497\n00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.335\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here IT PRO TV.\n\n498\n00:29:34.335 --> 00:29:40.252\n[MUSIC]\n\n499\n00:29:40.252 --> 00:29:43.733\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.674\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.674 --> 00:00:15.718\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL Intermediate\nseries, I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:20.224\nIn this episode, we'll continue taking\na look at our service design processes,\n\n6\n00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:24.160\nspecifically, we'll continue\ntalking about design coordination.\n\n7\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.460\nAnd back in studios with us today, we have\nMrs Jo Peacock, how is it going today, Jo?\n\n8\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.620\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great,\nthank you Cherokee, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\n\n10\n00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.500\nin the last show we started talking\nabout service design coordination.\n\n11\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.660\nWell, service design process,\nthe specific one of design coordination.\n\n12\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.092\nIf I can get this all squared away here,\nbut we didn't quite finish this particular\n\n13\n00:00:44.092 --> 00:00:47.531\nconcept, so where is it that we'll\nbe picking up for this show?\n\n14\n00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:49.874\n&gt;&gt; I just like testing you with\nthe tongue twisters that's all it is.\n\n15\n00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:50.674\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know that's what it is.\n\n16\n00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:54.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, we are going to look at\nthe second part of design coordination.\n\n17\n00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.160\nSo specifically,\nwe're gonna look at the roles,\n\n18\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.990\nand we're gonna look at the inputs\ninto Design coordination.\n\n19\n00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.400\nSo in our last episode, we looked at that\ninteraction in-between design coordination\n\n20\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.770\nand project management and\nexactly what the two do.\n\n21\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.785\nAnd now we're just gonna look at who\nwe need for design coordination,\n\n22\n00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:17.361\nso we're gonna start off\nwith our process owner.\n\n23\n00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:21.984\nNow I should hope that you have\ncompleted your foundation recap or\n\n24\n00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:28.051\nthat you have recently completed your\nfoundation material, your foundation show.\n\n25\n00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:32.990\nIn which case you understand that the role\nof a process owner is to be accountable\n\n26\n00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.900\nfor a specific process.\n\n27\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.860\nSo they are not necessarily responsible\nfor carrying out the activities of that\n\n28\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.620\nprocess but they are accountable for\nmaking sure the process happens.\n\n29\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.570\nAnd they are accountable for ensuring that\nthe process produces the right output.\n\n30\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.000\nIn which case, with design coordination,\n\n31\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.360\nwe're talking about\nthe service design package.\n\n32\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.754\nAnd we're also talking about improvement\ninitiatives within the whole of service\n\n33\n00:01:59.754 --> 00:02:00.262\ndesign.\n\n34\n00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:05.050\nAs we looked on at the last slide of our\nlast episode we looked at the fact that\n\n35\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.536\nservice design coordination was\nnot just about individual designs.\n\n36\n00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:12.200\nBut it's also about\noverseeing design the whole\n\n37\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.420\nof the service design lifecycle\nphase in its entirety.\n\n38\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.664\nNow the process manager well,\nthey are responsible for\n\n39\n00:02:20.664 --> 00:02:25.460\ncarrying out the activities\nrequired within service design.\n\n40\n00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.984\nSo take a look at this, there seems to\nbe a huge number of responsibilities\n\n41\n00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:34.520\nthere for the process manager\n&gt;&gt; It sure does.\n\n42\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so I'm only gonna pull out a few\nof these for you to I guess, remember.\n\n43\n00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.365\n&gt;&gt; Well I mean, you even covered a lot\nof them in the previous show and\n\n44\n00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.770\nthat seems like a lot then,\na bit like a very big responsibility.\n\n45\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.467\n&gt;&gt; We did and what we have to do\nhere is just ensure that we get the,\n\n46\n00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.118\nhow do I say this?\n\n47\n00:02:56.118 --> 00:03:00.817\nThat we actually get the responsibilities\ndefined between the process owner and\n\n48\n00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:02.138\nthe process manager.\n\n49\n00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:06.250\nBecause we also have the service design\nmanager role, which appears here.\n\n50\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.961\nAnd it simply says that many organizations\nwill just have the job of service\n\n51\n00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.096\ndesign manager.\n\n52\n00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:16.318\nWhich combines the process owner and\nthe process manager, and\n\n53\n00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:18.375\nthis is very, very true.\n\n54\n00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:21.857\nThere are very few organizations\nother than large organizations.\n\n55\n00:03:21.857 --> 00:03:26.035\nWhere we have a separate process owner for\ndesign coordination and\n\n56\n00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:28.879\na process manager for design coordination.\n\n57\n00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.610\nBearing in mind that what we have is\nwe have processes within service design\n\n58\n00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.221\nsuch as.\n\n59\n00:03:34.221 --> 00:03:38.304\nService level management and\nsupplier management and\n\n60\n00:03:38.304 --> 00:03:43.600\navailability and capacity and\nwe also have continuity and security.\n\n61\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.920\nAnd these processes themselves all\nproduce their own outputs, and\n\n62\n00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.620\ntheir outputs are inputs into\nthe service design package.\n\n63\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.850\nSo because we've got process managers and\nprocess owners for\n\n64\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.920\neach of those processes.\n\n65\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.570\nThen quite often we don't actually\nneed a design coordination\n\n66\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.870\nprocess owner and manager because that\nsounds like a huge number of people.\n\n67\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.145\nWhat does the process manager do other\nthan collating all of the outputs from\n\n68\n00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:17.355\nevery other process within service design?\n\n69\n00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:22.009\nSo quite often this will be combined, and\nyou can take a look at the activities here\n\n70\n00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.653\nand what we're going to\ndo is we're going to.\n\n71\n00:04:24.653 --> 00:04:29.576\nAs we move forward into all of the other\nprocesses, you'll see that the other\n\n72\n00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:34.512\nprocesses are producing outputs\nthat are actually inputs into this.\n\n73\n00:04:34.512 --> 00:04:37.702\nWhat we're doing is we're insuring\nthat there's consistent design and\n\n74\n00:04:37.702 --> 00:04:40.522\nwe're ensuring that we\nuse a common framework.\n\n75\n00:04:40.522 --> 00:04:43.049\nWell of course, project management's\ngonna help us with that.\n\n76\n00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:48.480\nSo having one person that dictates\nhow we are going to perform within\n\n77\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.266\nservice design, that's quite often all\nthat some organizations really require.\n\n78\n00:04:55.266 --> 00:05:00.140\nAnd sometimes this sits within the role\nof the program management office as well,\n\n79\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.830\nwith the PMO.\n\n80\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.070\nSo what do we have as inputs here\nthen into design coordination?\n\n81\n00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.030\nWell, we want everything that's an output\nfrom service strategy basically, so\n\n82\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.180\nthat's includes our change proposals.\n\n83\n00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.392\nThat includes our new ideas that come\ninto our service pipeline, that includes\n\n84\n00:05:19.392 --> 00:05:24.553\nour business, I'd forgotten what the name\nis right now off the top of my head.\n\n85\n00:05:24.553 --> 00:05:29.454\nThat thing, that justification for\na significant item of expenditure,\n\n86\n00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:30.560\nwhat is that?\n\n87\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.082\n&gt;&gt; That is going be your-\n&gt;&gt; A business case, there you go,\n\n88\n00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:34.762\nI knew that started with the word B.\n\n89\n00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:37.354\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait, it's gonna be one of those\n\n90\n00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:41.080\nsessions and I am sorry for\nthat, that's our business case.\n\n91\n00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.430\nSo that's an input into service design as\nwell as all of the business information\n\n92\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.550\nand any business impact analysis\nthat service strategy does as well.\n\n93\n00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.080\nService strategy, hand in hand with\nbusiness relationship management is going\n\n94\n00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.790\nto be performing business impact analysis.\n\n95\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.010\nOn what happens if we don't input\nthe implement that new service?\n\n96\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.660\nWhat impact will there be when we\ndo implement that new service,\n\n97\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.300\nand what if it fails?\n\n98\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.110\nIs that service what we call a VBF,\na Vital Business Function or not, so\n\n99\n00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.770\nwhat else have we got as inputs here?\n\n100\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.340\nWell, we've got the change schedule,\nand that change schedule,\n\n101\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.320\nwell that tells us what's coming\nup from change management.\n\n102\n00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.830\nAnd we have to ensure that we\ncoordinate all our designs and\n\n103\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.250\ntherefore, the timescales for\nour designs in with that change schedule.\n\n104\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.196\nObviously we use the information from\nour configuration management system, and\n\n105\n00:06:34.196 --> 00:06:37.862\nwe need to incorporate all of\nthe governance requirements.\n\n106\n00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:41.917\nAnd all of our legal and ethical\nrequirements that we may have as well,\n\n107\n00:06:41.917 --> 00:06:45.240\nso what starts off design\ncoordination then?\n\n108\n00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.240\nWell, to put it simply,\nit's that approved business case,\n\n109\n00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.590\nI actually remembered the word just now\nright, it's that approved business case.\n\n110\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.275\nIt's that RFC that request for change\nthat comes in from the change proposal,\n\n111\n00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:02.005\ncomes in from a service strategy.\n\n112\n00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.205\nWe have that approved and\n\n113\n00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:08.192\nthis is what starts us into service\ndesign, designing that service.\n\n114\n00:07:08.192 --> 00:07:12.572\nJust remember that here in service design,\nwe are designing the service.\n\n115\n00:07:12.572 --> 00:07:16.334\nWe're not building it, we hand that\nover to service transition and\n\n116\n00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:18.581\nit's service transition that builds.\n\n117\n00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:23.722\nSo what we're producing are SDPs for\neach and every service.\n\n118\n00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:28.265\nBut don't forget,\nthose SDPs should be to a standard,\n\n119\n00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:33.690\na consistent format,\nwe want to have consistency in place.\n\n120\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.370\nSo of course,\nwhen we talk about revised processes and\n\n121\n00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.931\nwe talk about revised systems, etc.\n\n122\n00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:44.779\nWell that's because we want to improve and\nwe want to add in consistency to\n\n123\n00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:49.690\nour designs overall,\nas well as to each individual design.\n\n124\n00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.958\nSo now we've got a slide in front\nof us that looks at the interfaces\n\n125\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.831\nwith design coordination.\n\n126\n00:07:55.831 --> 00:07:58.956\nNow I've already mentioned,\nservice level management and\n\n127\n00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:02.338\navailability and capacity and\nservice continuity management.\n\n128\n00:08:02.338 --> 00:08:04.943\nAnd I'm hoping that somewhere up there.\n\n129\n00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:08.750\nThere isn't so I'm gonna mention\nsecurity management as well,\n\n130\n00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.930\nbecause they are our for\nwarranty processes.\n\n131\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.090\nService level management and\nsupplier management,\n\n132\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.550\nwe are going to cover in later episodes.\n\n133\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.760\nBut let's take a look at strategy, let's\ntake a look at financial management and\n\n134\n00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.300\nservice portfolio, and business\nrelationship management for a moment.\n\n135\n00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.670\nThis particular process is\nsetting service strategy,\n\n136\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.028\nand for those of you that have\ndone your service strategy,\n\n137\n00:08:35.028 --> 00:08:39.510\nI was gonna say class, but\nlooked to your service strategy episodes,\n\n138\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.060\nyou will see in there what\noutputs these provide.\n\n139\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.497\nThese are providing a direction for\nus here in service design.\n\n140\n00:08:48.497 --> 00:08:53.070\nThey're providing the governance models\nand they're providing our policies.\n\n141\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.500\nAnd business relationship management and\nservice portfolio management,\n\n142\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:03.760\nthey are actually providing our new ideas\nand that's what we're designing after all.\n\n143\n00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.770\nFinancial management,\n\n144\n00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.610\nof course, gives us money, tells us\nhow much money we've got to spend.\n\n145\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.590\nAnd we actually then will feed back to\nfinancial management our cost models,\n\n146\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.320\nin other words how much\nmoney we are spending.\n\n147\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.890\nAnd then if we look at the remainder we're\ntalking about release and deployment, and\n\n148\n00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.240\nservice validation and testing, and change\nevaluation, and change management, and\n\n149\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.390\ntransition planning and support.\n\n150\n00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:31.840\nWell, they're all in service transitions,\nso they are building these new services.\n\n151\n00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.740\nNow transition planning and support,\n\n152\n00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.250\nI like to think of that as the sister\na process to design coordination.\n\n153\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.970\nBecause they're performing all of the same\nactivities for design coordination for\n\n154\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.720\ntransition as design coordination is for\nservice design.\n\n155\n00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.370\nSo transition planning and support, it's\nkind of the other side to the same coin.\n\n156\n00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.300\nPerforming exactly the same activities\nonly for the build, and test and\n\n157\n00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.230\nimplementation as design coordination\ndoes for the actual design.\n\n158\n00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.820\nSo what is it that we need to achieve\nthen within design coordination?\n\n159\n00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:11.213\nNow don't forget, CSFs, and we covered\nthis in CSI within our foundation\n\n160\n00:10:11.213 --> 00:10:15.760\nmaterial, but we've also covered\nthis in service strategy.\n\n161\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.667\nAnd we cover this again in our\nCSI life cycle phase, too.\n\n162\n00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:22.610\nA CSF is a critical success factor.\n\n163\n00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.090\nIt's something we want to achieve, but\nit's something that is quite often fairly\n\n164\n00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.795\nintangible and so we will measure whether\nwe are achieving our critical success\n\n165\n00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:36.990\nfactors by the achievement of KPIs,\nour key performance indicators.\n\n166\n00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.940\nAnd as a rule, we need at least\ntwo to three KPIs per CSF,\n\n167\n00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.370\nalthough over time we may\nbuild on the number of KPIs.\n\n168\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.870\nSo what examples then have we got for\nCSFs for this?\n\n169\n00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.444\nAnd don't forget, these are just examples,\nnothing more than that.\n\n170\n00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:55.012\nOkay, we can only give you an example.\n\n171\n00:10:55.012 --> 00:10:58.800\nYour CSFs are unique to your organization.\n\n172\n00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.624\nSo one of the CSFs that we\nhave here are accurate and\n\n173\n00:11:01.624 --> 00:11:03.850\nconsistent service design packages.\n\n174\n00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:09.110\nIt goes back to having the templates for\nour service design packages.\n\n175\n00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.070\nSo what we want is a reduction\nin the number of subsequent\n\n176\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:17.150\nrevisions of the content of the SDP,\nbecause we know what content we need for\n\n177\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.310\nevery single design, reduction in\nthe amount of re-work, because we haven't\n\n178\n00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.999\ngot insufficient information, because we\nknow what we need for every single design.\n\n179\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.370\nAnd what about another CSF where our\nservices meet their expectations?\n\n180\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.590\nWell that means that\nwe're delivering value so\n\n181\n00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.060\nour customers satisfaction\nscores have to reflect that.\n\n182\n00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.097\nAnd that means we have\ntransition services.\n\n183\n00:11:41.097 --> 00:11:46.872\nIn other words built and deployed services\nthat achieve their target levels and\n\n184\n00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:50.830\nthat are implemented without any failures.\n\n185\n00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.290\nBecause, we designed them\nright in the first place.\n\n186\n00:11:54.290 --> 00:12:00.400\nThis is where we either design in errors,\nor where we design it correctly.\n\n187\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.260\nTransition will build.\n\n188\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.270\nAnd testing will test whether we have\nany errors, but if we've designed\n\n189\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.700\nit incorrectly, then transition are gonna\nbuild something that's incorrect.\n\n190\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.560\nJust think about this for a moment, and\n\n191\n00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.370\ngo back to our model of our\narchitect in our house.\n\n192\n00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:22.270\nIf my architect designs me a house\nwhere in one particular room,\n\n193\n00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.050\nthe light switch is just above the\nbaseboards or the skirting boards above\n\n194\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.610\nthe floor, then my contractor who is going\nto build it is gonna assume that that's\n\n195\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.860\nbeen put there deliberately, and is\ntherefore going to build it in that way.\n\n196\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:43.890\nDesign is our first opportunity for\ndelivering value to our customers.\n\n197\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.937\nBut design is also our\nfirst opportunity for\n\n198\n00:12:46.937 --> 00:12:49.994\ndelivering a failure to our customers too.\n\n199\n00:12:49.994 --> 00:12:54.248\nAnd so that's something that we have\nto remember, design we'll design but\n\n200\n00:12:54.248 --> 00:12:57.110\ntransition will build\nwhatever we have designed.\n\n201\n00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:02.310\nSo what about this managing\nconflicting demands for resources?\n\n202\n00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:07.080\nI've already mentioned about things\nlike our test environment, for\n\n203\n00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.670\ninstance, in a previous episode.\n\n204\n00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.320\nWe've got conflicting resources.\n\n205\n00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.170\nIt's not just about people,\nit's actually about environments and\n\n206\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.940\nabout our tangible assets.\n\n207\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.890\nSo look at the KPIs that we have there.\n\n208\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.820\nWe got five KPIs attached to this one.\n\n209\n00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.040\nAnd again, as I say,\nthis is just an example.\n\n210\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.440\nSo we talk about satisfaction\nwith design activity.\n\n211\n00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.530\nWe want to talk about project managers\nthat are happy with that interface.\n\n212\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.770\nWe wanna reduce number of issues and\n\n213\n00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:42.030\nwe want new services that\nare increasing in quality\n\n214\n00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:46.820\nin terms of cost, and in terms of the time\nthat we're delivering that service.\n\n215\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.820\nWe want to be effective and efficient.\n\n216\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:58.500\nSo what do we have to overcome then\nin order to achieve effectiveness\n\n217\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.740\nin deficiency and to be able to achieve\ngood quality design coordination?\n\n218\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.910\nWe have to maintain high quality\nin our service design packages.\n\n219\n00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.420\nAnd we have to maintain that consistency.\n\n220\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.040\nAnd we have to ensure that we have got\nthe right resources available to us\n\n221\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.760\nto be able to perform design coordination.\n\n222\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.060\nIn other words, that we have the right\npeople with the right skills to be able to\n\n223\n00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.430\ncoordinate all of our resources, and to be\nable to produce consistent information.\n\n224\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.410\nAnd we also have to develop processes.\n\n225\n00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.830\nSo what we're looking for\nhere is very much a coordination role.\n\n226\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:41.699\nIt's a management role that requires\nmanagement and coordination skills.\n\n227\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.090\nYou see there's a risk if we\ndon't have the right skills.\n\n228\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:51.910\nAnd if we don't have the right tools\navailable to us to help with this,\n\n229\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.610\nthen that is a risk.\n\n230\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.910\nIf we don't involve the business,\n\n231\n00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:02.170\nnow I made an analogy right\nat the very start of this\n\n232\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.590\nwhere I talk in service design about the\nfact that I've been to service strategy.\n\n233\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.830\nI've been to the bank and\nI've got my money, and\n\n234\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.740\nnow I want to go and build my house and\nI say to you, right.\n\n235\n00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.270\nThat's it, I'm a customer.\n\n236\n00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.990\nI'm gonna give my architect the money and\nI'm gonna say this what I want and\n\n237\n00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.140\nthen I'm gonna walk away.\n\n238\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.684\nBut I also said right at the very\nbeginning of service design when we looked\n\n239\n00:15:22.684 --> 00:15:23.837\nat our first episodes.\n\n240\n00:15:23.837 --> 00:15:27.460\nI also said that I'm gonna\ntake the odd phone call.\n\n241\n00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:32.450\nOf course I gonna talk to the architect,\nbecause if me as a customer if I\n\n242\n00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:37.880\nnot involved then what happens\nwhen we do have an issue where my\n\n243\n00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.660\ncontractor, my architect cannot get\nhold of those particular tiles?\n\n244\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.930\nOr maybe the fridge that I want\nis no longer in production.\n\n245\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.468\nAnd if they can't get hold of me,\nwhat do they do?\n\n246\n00:15:49.468 --> 00:15:53.368\nDo I just walk into that house when\nthe keys are handed over to me or\n\n247\n00:15:53.368 --> 00:15:55.690\nwhen it's given me access on the app?\n\n248\n00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.907\nLet's face it,\nI wanna be sort of WiFi enabled.\n\n249\n00:15:58.907 --> 00:15:59.569\nWhat happens?\n\n250\n00:15:59.569 --> 00:16:03.447\nDo I just walk into the house and find\nthat my wine isn't chilling because there\n\n251\n00:16:03.447 --> 00:16:05.637\nisn't a fridge in that\nhole in the kitchen?\n\n252\n00:16:05.637 --> 00:16:07.801\nI'm gonna be fairly devastated by that.\n\n253\n00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:12.134\nOr none of the showers in all of my\nbathrooms have got any towels in\n\n254\n00:16:12.134 --> 00:16:17.810\nthe walls, and therefore I can't\nuse them because I wasn't involved.\n\n255\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.110\nAnd that's what we talk about there.\n\n256\n00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.680\nThe reluctance of\nthe business to be involved.\n\n257\n00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.490\nSometimes, like me, the business don't\nwant to have any further involvement.\n\n258\n00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.870\nI've given you my criteria.\n\n259\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.500\nI've told you what I want, and that's it.\n\n260\n00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.510\nIt's up to you to go away and do it.\n\n261\n00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:38.440\nThe fact is that we have to ensure that\nwe do have involvement from the business.\n\n262\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.840\nBut we've also got to strike that balance.\n\n263\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.440\nAnd we've got to be very, very careful.\n\n264\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.240\nBecause having that in the right level\nof commitment from the business,\n\n265\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.220\nwell we don't wanna\ninterrupt them too much.\n\n266\n00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.685\nIf we disturb them too much,\n\n267\n00:16:51.685 --> 00:16:55.607\nthen we're actually preventing them\nfrom getting on and doing their work.\n\n268\n00:16:55.607 --> 00:16:58.905\nAnd they won't perceive us\nas being very efficient.\n\n269\n00:16:58.905 --> 00:17:01.975\nThey'll actually perceive\nus as being quite sort of,\n\n270\n00:17:01.975 --> 00:17:04.815\nwell a bit of a pain, to be honest.\n\n271\n00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.635\nSo we've gotta get that balance right,\n\n272\n00:17:06.635 --> 00:17:09.665\nwhere we want to check everything\nwith the organization.\n\n273\n00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:12.465\nWe want to make sure that they're happy\nwith everything that we're doing.\n\n274\n00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:16.015\nBut then at the same time, we don't want\nto interrupt them every five minutes.\n\n275\n00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.100\nSo this is why design coordination is\nreally important because we've got to get\n\n276\n00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.880\nthat type of strategy, that policy right.\n\n277\n00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.640\nWhere yes, we'll agree to be contacted.\n\n278\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.660\nBut as a customer, I don't want\nto be contacted every single day.\n\n279\n00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.500\nSo maybe what I arrange as a customer, or\n\n280\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.510\nas the business,\nwhen I arrange with my architect,\n\n281\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.630\nwith my design coordination manager, is\nthat I'll have a weekly meeting with them.\n\n282\n00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.590\nOr maybe a monthly meeting with\nthem to overcome many issues or\n\n283\n00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.600\ndiscuss any problems that we may have.\n\n284\n00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.950\nSo let's take a look at that\nlast bullet point there then.\n\n285\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.190\nLook at the last bullet point.\n\n286\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.370\nTrying to save time and\n\n287\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:02.140\nmoney will result in poorer designs\nrequiring more changes afterwards.\n\n288\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.090\nThink about my house again.\n\n289\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.600\nI do a lot of thinking about this house.\n\n290\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.305\nI don't think I'm every gonna get it.\n\n291\n00:18:07.305 --> 00:18:08.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can tell Jo.\n\n292\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.620\n&gt;&gt; But I do a lot of thinking about this.\n\n293\n00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:16.435\nJust think, anything that we buy,\nespecially this is so true in terms of IT.\n\n294\n00:18:16.435 --> 00:18:21.290\nAnything that we buy at the last\nminute is generally more expensive.\n\n295\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.160\nIf I walk into my house and\nnone of my showers have been tiled,\n\n296\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.080\nthen I'm gonna go out and\nI'm gonna want to buy tiles.\n\n297\n00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.960\nAnd I'm gonna want them to\nbe tiled straight away.\n\n298\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:40.690\nThat means that I'm gonna go to\na warehouse of whatever sort.\n\n299\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.575\nAnd I'm just gonna buy tiles\nright at the very last minute.\n\n300\n00:18:43.575 --> 00:18:47.607\nAnd I'm probably gonna buy\nthe first ones I see that I like.\n\n301\n00:18:47.607 --> 00:18:50.386\nAnd they're probably gonna be\na lot more expensive than if\n\n302\n00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:54.017\nI spent the next month shopping around and\nfinding something that I really,\n\n303\n00:18:54.017 --> 00:18:56.850\nreally liked, and\nthat was probably half the price.\n\n304\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.725\n&gt;&gt; And\ndon't forget your actual tile layer.\n\n305\n00:18:59.725 --> 00:19:02.791\nYou're probably going to have to pay them\novertime because it's probably a holiday\n\n306\n00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:04.700\nthat you walked into your\nhouse to enjoy it, right?\n\n307\n00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And he also understands\nthe fact that I'm absolutely desperate for\n\n308\n00:19:07.785 --> 00:19:09.621\nthis, so\nhe can charge what he wants, right?\n\n309\n00:19:09.621 --> 00:19:13.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doing something at the last minute or\n\n310\n00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.870\npicking up the pieces after it's gone\nwrong is always going to cost us more.\n\n311\n00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:22.670\nSo in terms of bad design, that's\ndefinitely what we don't want to do.\n\n312\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.090\nWe actually want to ensure that\nwe keep our business happy, and\n\n313\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.165\nthat we keep our organization happy.\n\n314\n00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:31.900\nSo as I've said,\nwe don't want to interrupt them too much.\n\n315\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.850\nBut we do want to have regular meetings\nwith them to ensure that we don't\n\n316\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.673\nrun into that situation.\n\n317\n00:19:38.673 --> 00:19:41.570\nIt's not gonna cost us more\nright at the very last minute.\n\n318\n00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.170\nBecause you know what,\nthey could be really,\n\n319\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.340\nreally happy with us up\nuntil that point in time.\n\n320\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.887\nAnd then all of a sudden,\n\n321\n00:19:46.887 --> 00:19:51.919\nit's the last thing that happens that\nactually sets their perception of value.\n\n322\n00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:54.373\nBecause you always remember\nthe last thing that happens-\n\n323\n00:19:54.373 --> 00:19:54.915\n&gt;&gt; That's very true.\n\n324\n00:19:54.915 --> 00:19:56.370\n&gt;&gt; Rather than the most recent activity.\n\n325\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.920\nSo now we've concluded\nthe design coordination process.\n\n326\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.280\nYou do have an exercise within\nyour downloadedable materials.\n\n327\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.990\nSo I would like you to go and\ntake a look at that exercise.\n\n328\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.620\nThat will take you about\nan hour to complete.\n\n329\n00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.760\nAnd as per usual if you have any\nqueries at all, then please contact\n\n330\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.960\nus in the forum and I will be glad to help\nyou with any queries that you may have.\n\n331\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.050\nWell thank you, Jo.\n\n332\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.630\nAnd as you heard, go ahead and\ntake a look at those exercises.\n\n333\n00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.090\nWe are here for you.\n\n334\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:30.150\nBut we are also out of time for this show,\nso we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n335\n00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.130\nRemember, I've been your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n336\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.050\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n337\n00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.590\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n338\n00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:41.542\n[MUSIC]\n\n339\n00:20:41.542

00:00:31.942\n&gt;&gt; I'm excellent, and\nwe did cover a lot of information, but\n\n14\n00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:33.351\nwe still have a little bit to go.\n\n15\n00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:35.520\nSo what will we be looking at first?\n\n16\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.380\n&gt;&gt; A little bit?\n\n17\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.164\nWe've got a lot.\n\n18\n00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:39.200\nWe've got a lot to go yet, yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.228\nWe're gonna start to get\ninto some of the techniques.\n\n20\n00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:44.924\nI mean, first of all, we're going to look\nin this episode at the guiding principles\n\n21\n00:00:44.924 --> 00:00:46.290\nof availability management.\n\n22\n00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.800\nAnd we covered some of\nthat in our last episode.\n\n23\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.670\nAnd then in our subsequent episodes,\n\n24\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.610\nwe're going to look at availability\nmanagement techniques.\n\n25\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.480\nSo the first thing that we're going to do\nis we're just simply going to have a quick\n\n26\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.258\nrefresher over the diagram.\n\n27\n00:01:01.258 --> 00:01:01.940\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n28\n00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.220\n&gt;&gt; That I left you with\nfrom our last episode.\n\n29\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.330\nThis is the diagram of our process itself.\n\n30\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.570\nAnd if you remember,\n\n31\n00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.870\nthe important part to remember here is the\navailability management is split into two.\n\n32\n00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.840\nIt's split into proactive, which is the\nplanning part for availability management.\n\n33\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.860\nAnd of course we plan for\nour new services, we plan for\n\n34\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.630\nany updates to our existing services,\nand we plan to test as well.\n\n35\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.900\nAnd then, we plan at least once a year.\n\n36\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.280\nAnd then, obviously there's the reactive\nside of availability management.\n\n37\n00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.430\nWhich is helping incident management and\n\n38\n00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.590\nproblem management to\nidentify any failures.\n\n39\n00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.462\nAnd then,\nrestore services quickly as possible so\n\n40\n00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:46.880\nthat we can insure that those\navailability targets are met.\n\n41\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.315\nSo availability management then,\nas it says in the next slide here,\n\n42\n00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:54.570\nit's at the core of our business success.\n\n43\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.290\nWe've got to insure, as I've already\nmentioned in our last episode, we've got\n\n44\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.899\nto insure that our service meets the\navailability needs of the organization.\n\n45\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.190\nBut I've also gotta be\nrealistic about this.\n\n46\n00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.567\nAnd we know that things go wrong,\nthey always do.\n\n47\n00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:14.202\nThere's nothing that we\ncan do to avoid them,\n\n48\n00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:18.430\neven with careful planning\nsomething's still going to happen.\n\n49\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.230\nAnd as I said in a previous episode,\nwe don't guarantee anything in IT.\n\n50\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.200\nI never want to see the word guarantee\nin a service level agreement,\n\n51\n00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.620\nit doesn't belong in there.\n\n52\n00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.400\nBut nevertheless,\neven though we might have a failure,\n\n53\n00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.230\nit still doesn't mean that our\ncustomers are gonna be unhappy.\n\n54\n00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.030\nIf we've added in redundancy options,\nif we've got mirrored drives for\n\n55\n00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.000\ninstance, or a mirrored server,\nthen if we've got mirrored process,\n\n56\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.890\nand it really doesn't matter to\nthe customer and the user if one fails.\n\n57\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.040\nSure, it matters to us.\n\n58\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.180\nWe've got to get it up and\nrunning as quickly as possible.\n\n59\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.070\nBut we can still have continuous\nservice even in spite of a failure.\n\n60\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.200\nOther ways that we can improve and\n\n61\n00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.200\ndeliver on our customer satisfaction is\nobviously with good communication as well.\n\n62\n00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.580\nAnd our service desk is going\nto be really important in this.\n\n63\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.038\nBecause we can if we keep our users\ninformed of exactly what's happening\n\n64\n00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:20.790\nwithin any failure, then we can still\nensure customer satisfaction despite\n\n65\n00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.290\nthe fact that something's gone wrong.\n\n66\n00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.018\nBut we need to ensure that\navailability management and\n\n67\n00:03:28.018 --> 00:03:35.170\navailability planning is part of every\nsingle project, every new design.\n\n68\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.570\nIt's part of every change,\nwhenever an RFC, a request for change,\n\n69\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.950\nis raised to change an existing service,\n\n70\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.260\nwe have to ensure that availability\nplanning is part of that.\n\n71\n00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.870\nRemember the components of our service,\nour software and our hardware and\n\n72\n00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.900\nour environment and our people and\nour infrastructure and our documentation.\n\n73\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.020\nWe've got a plan for the availability for\nevery single one of these and\n\n74\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.800\nwe can only do that by understanding how\nour services support the businesses, but\n\n75\n00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.190\nalso how our services fit together.\n\n76\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.370\nRemember what we said\nway back in foundation,\n\n77\n00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.900\nthese components are not unique.\n\n78\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.196\nI don't have one server for\nemail, and one infrastructure,\n\n79\n00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:19.906\none network for email,\nand one PC for email.\n\n80\n00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:22.167\nAnd then have a completely\ndifferent network,\n\n81\n00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:25.501\nand a completely different server,\nand a completely different PC for\n\n82\n00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:28.230\nevery time I want to browse the Internet,\nfor instance.\n\n83\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.971\nI'm going to have shared components.\n\n84\n00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:36.530\n&gt;&gt; And understanding those\nrelationships was a big part of it too\n\n85\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, exactly.\n\n86\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.244\nAnd then if we take a look\nat service level management,\n\n87\n00:04:40.244 --> 00:04:42.774\nwhich is a process that also\nsits within service design.\n\n88\n00:04:42.774 --> 00:04:47.883\nAnd we looked at the relationship between\nOLAs, these operational level agreements,\n\n89\n00:04:47.883 --> 00:04:52.250\nand SLAs, availability management,\nit really hangs on all of these.\n\n90\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.180\nWe like to think about availability\nmanagement as being uniquely\n\n91\n00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.440\ntied to the technical stuff.\n\n92\n00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.840\nBut it's not.\n\n93\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.420\nLet's say, for instance, in our service\nlevel agreement, which is an agreement\n\n94\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.530\nbetween IT and the customer, I've got\na four hour response for an incident.\n\n95\n00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.020\nAnd if a customer calls me and\n\n96\n00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.260\nsays, okay, I've got an issue here,\nsomething's failed.\n\n97\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.814\nAnd I think here I am in the service desk,\n\n98\n00:05:15.814 --> 00:05:19.734\nI think I've got four hours to\nrespond back to that customer.\n\n99\n00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:25.015\nThat's part of my incident management\ntarget, but that's what I've agreed.\n\n100\n00:05:25.015 --> 00:05:29.364\nSo that would also be, well considered,\nan availability management is that there's\n\n101\n00:05:29.364 --> 00:05:32.951\na potential that that particular\nservice could be down for four hours.\n\n102\n00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:34.169\nOkay, we know that.\n\n103\n00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.240\nBut then Cherokee's in\nour desktop support team.\n\n104\n00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.860\nAnd here I am in the service desk and\nI've got a four hour response with you,\n\n105\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.500\nmy customer, but I've got an eight\nhour response with Cherokee.\n\n106\n00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.280\nSo that when I take this\nincident from you and then I say,\n\n107\n00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.730\ndo you know why I can't fix this?\n\n108\n00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.453\nI'm gonna pass it through\nto my desktop support team.\n\n109\n00:05:56.453 --> 00:06:03.010\nIf Cherokee thinks she's got eight hours\nto deal with this, well, then guess what?\n\n110\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.372\nI failed my service level target with you.\n\n111\n00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:08.910\nAnd my availability has been breached,\nas well.\n\n112\n00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.972\n&gt;&gt; You bring up a really good point Jo,\nbecause not everyone is going to\n\n113\n00:06:14.972 --> 00:06:18.761\nhave that same expectation that level of,\nthat SLA type.\n\n114\n00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:22.934\nAnd the other thing is maybe I'm actually,\nit's not an issue of hey,\n\n115\n00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:26.474\nthis particular component or\nresource is not working, but\n\n116\n00:06:26.474 --> 00:06:30.230\nit may also fall back on\nthe issue of you know what?\n\n117\n00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.050\nCherokee doesn't have access to that,\nbut Joe does.\n\n118\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.304\nSo Cherokee may see this as availability\nissue, when in fact it's those other\n\n119\n00:06:37.304 --> 00:06:41.057\ncomponents that are involved that\nyou need to think about, as well.\n\n120\n00:06:41.057 --> 00:06:45.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I just used that\nexample of our service level\n\n121\n00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:48.810\ntargets in terms of incident management.\n\n122\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.350\nWhat you've brought into the mix then is\nobviously, is that I sat here for four\n\n123\n00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.960\nhours or however long trying to figure\nout what it was that was causing this.\n\n124\n00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.100\nI didn't know so I passed it to you.\n\n125\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.950\nI've got an eight hour response with you.\n\n126\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.890\nBut then you're in desktop support and\n\n127\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.090\nlet's say that you take a look at that\nincident and you decide that actually it's\n\n128\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.480\nnot a desktop issue,\nit's an infrastructure issue.\n\n129\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.367\nSo you're gonna pass it\nto the network team.\n\n130\n00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:13.601\nNow, you don't know necessarily\nthat it's an infrastructure issue,\n\n131\n00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:16.630\nit just looks like that to you\nbecause you're in the desktop group.\n\n132\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.020\nYou might have a OLA,\na target with between the desktop team and\n\n133\n00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.930\nthe infrastructure team of yet\nanother four hours.\n\n134\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.130\nSo all of a sudden, this incident is being\npassed around from pillar to post we're\n\n135\n00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.840\nplaying tennis with this incident record.\n\n136\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.839\nAnd quite simply, nothing's getting fixed\nand the availability of that service\n\n137\n00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:43.122\nhas been impacted because we don't\nknow exactly what's causing it.\n\n138\n00:07:43.122 --> 00:07:47.934\nSo availability management has\nvery key dependency on well,\n\n139\n00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:52.747\nasset and configuration management\ncuz we need to understand\n\n140\n00:07:52.747 --> 00:07:56.000\nhow these services Well, how they work.\n\n141\n00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.322\nNot just about network topology,\nwe're gonna look at this when we look at\n\n142\n00:08:00.322 --> 00:08:04.110\ncomponent failure and\nimpact analysis in a later episode.\n\n143\n00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.370\nBut this is not just about\nthe network topology,\n\n144\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.460\nit's about where we share components.\n\n145\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.450\nBecause you see, let me look at my\nlaptop and right now on my laptop,\n\n146\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.680\nthere could be something that I'm\ndoing on say Microsoft Office\n\n147\n00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.270\nthat might actually affect something\nthat's happening for me on Acrobat.\n\n148\n00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.660\nSo these components of all of these\nservices, they do fit together, and\n\n149\n00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.230\nthey do have an impact on each other.\n\n150\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.740\nSo availability has got to be\nconsidered during the project phase.\n\n151\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.093\nAnd it's not just about saying, I know we\nneed to be available 24 hours a day, so\n\n152\n00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:42.633\nI need to make sure I have got enough\ncapacity to be able to manage that.\n\n153\n00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:43.298\nIt's not just about that.\n\n154\n00:08:43.298 --> 00:08:47.094\nIt's about understanding\nthe impact on other services,\n\n155\n00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:52.683\nbecause me bringing in one service might\nactually directly impact another service.\n\n156\n00:08:52.683 --> 00:08:54.870\nSo all of this has got to be planned.\n\n157\n00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.670\nAnd it sounds straightforward.\n\n158\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.940\nWhen you first think about\navailability management,\n\n159\n00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.750\nyou would be surprised how many people\njust shrug their shoulders at me and\n\n160\n00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.110\nsay, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all right,\nJo, we've got that one covered.\n\n161\n00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.020\nAnd then when it comes down to it and\nit comes to deploying a new service,\n\n162\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.850\nand then we suddenly realize no,\nyou haven't got that one covered.\n\n163\n00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.587\nBecause yeah, you've got it covered for\nthis particular project, but\n\n164\n00:09:15.587 --> 00:09:17.805\nwhat about what you really just impacted.\n\n165\n00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:18.515\n&gt;&gt; That's so right.\n\n166\n00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:20.297\nI mean you have to look at all aspects and\n\n167\n00:09:20.297 --> 00:09:23.969\nsometimes this is why is great to have a\nteam, because not everyone can always see\n\n168\n00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:26.401\neverything from different perspectives or\nangles.\n\n169\n00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:30.718\nAnd then not only that, but something\nelse that's so planning obviously,\n\n170\n00:09:30.718 --> 00:09:34.900\nyou know like we're talking about here,\nbut then when those incidents or\n\n171\n00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.099\nproblems may arise, how you're reacting\nto them really sets you apart.\n\n172\n00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:42.698\nAnd that shows how you can handle\nsituations and your response is what can\n\n173\n00:09:42.698 --> 00:09:45.880\nreally set you apart as well,\nin addition to the planning.\n\n174\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nlet's just think about the fact that,\n\n175\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.032\nlet's look at the last bullet point here.\n\n176\n00:09:50.032 --> 00:09:53.370\nReactive is great, but\nif we look at that last bullet point,\n\n177\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.840\navailability should be designed right\nat the very start with any new project,\n\n178\n00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.800\nnot just left to what\nhappens in the future.\n\n179\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.759\nBecause you know what?\n\n180\n00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:07.962\nIt's okay being reactive when something\ngoes wrong, but have you ever had to go\n\n181\n00:10:07.962 --> 00:10:11.930\ndown to a store right at the very last\nminute because something's failed?\n\n182\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.000\nAnd guess what?\n\n183\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.430\nYou pay twice the price.\n\n184\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.950\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n185\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.680\n&gt;&gt; When you buy something at the very\nlast minute, you pay twice the price, and\n\n186\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.950\nthe problem is that the damage\nhas already been done.\n\n187\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.157\nAnd as far your credibility is\nconcerned with your customers,\n\n188\n00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:27.281\nif something's failed, it's failed.\n\n189\n00:10:27.281 --> 00:10:29.430\nIt's too late at that point in time.\n\n190\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.090\nYou are in firefighting mode and\nyou've got to go and\n\n191\n00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.490\nyou gotta pick up the pieces and\nrepair the damage.\n\n192\n00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.459\nAnd yes, how you do that has a great\nimpact on your customer satisfaction.\n\n193\n00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:41.966\nBut nevertheless, if we planned for\nit in the first place,\n\n194\n00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:44.040\nthen we wouldn't had that issue.\n\n195\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.330\nSo we have to think about this.\n\n196\n00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.580\nSo when we think about\navailability management,\n\n197\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.270\nI want you to think about your arms.\n\n198\n00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.260\nYour arms, your availability,\nyour reliability, maintainability,\n\n199\n00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.745\nserviceability, and\nvital business function as well.\n\n200\n00:10:57.745 --> 00:10:59.563\nWe tagged that one on the end.\n\n201\n00:10:59.563 --> 00:11:03.660\nNow that is one that we\nmentioned in our last episode.\n\n202\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.780\nA vital business function,\nif you remember,\n\n203\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.740\nis something that the business or\na function, a process that the business\n\n204\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.390\nhas to perform in order to be able\nto deliver what it's suppose to do.\n\n205\n00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:22.569\nHere at ITProTV, our aim is to deliver\nquality training material online.\n\n206\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.640\nSo one of our vital business\nfunctions then is our ability here at\n\n207\n00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.490\nour organization, at ITProTV,\nto be able to record and\n\n208\n00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:39.130\nto deliver online our training products.\n\n209\n00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.280\nSo here within IT, which is where I sit,\n\n210\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.740\nin IT, my objective is to ensure\nthat I can facilitate that.\n\n211\n00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.090\nAnd we already mentioned\nthis in a previous episode.\n\n212\n00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.460\nSo, I've gotta make sure\nthat everything works.\n\n213\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.940\nSo, when it's turned on,\neverything is working.\n\n214\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.264\nOr rather, Ronnie does that for us, right?\n\n215\n00:11:56.264 --> 00:12:00.030\n[LAUGH] But, we're gonna look\nat just some concepts here and\n\n216\n00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.600\nwe're gonna look at them in\na little bit more detail.\n\n217\n00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.374\nAvailability as we have already\nsaid in previous episode,\n\n218\n00:12:06.374 --> 00:12:10.681\nthat's about being available as\nper the agreed targets in the SLA.\n\n219\n00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:15.592\nAnd the availability, it really means\nit's the ability of a service to perform,\n\n220\n00:12:15.592 --> 00:12:20.910\nor a component by the way, to perform\nits agreed function when required.\n\n221\n00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.160\nIn other words, does it work?\n\n222\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.640\nThat's availability.\n\n223\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.120\nIs it there when I need it?\n\n224\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.219\nSo when I need it, I've agreed that I\nneed it between the hours of 5:00 AM and\n\n225\n00:12:31.219 --> 00:12:32.370\n10:00 PM.\n\n226\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.580\nSo can I send and\n\n227\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.130\nreceive my email between the hours\nof 5:00 AM and 10:00 PM, yes or no?\n\n228\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.180\nReliability, well we measure\nthat in terms of MTBSI,\n\n229\n00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.840\nmean time between system incidents,\nwhich is how often does it break down.\n\n230\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.729\nDon't confuse that with resilience.\n\n231\n00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:56.095\nAnd resilience is about how many\nknocks does it take before it fails,\n\n232\n00:12:56.095 --> 00:12:59.807\nwhereas reliability is\nhow often does it fail.\n\n233\n00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:05.112\nMaintainability is all about how quickly\nwe can restore service after failure,\n\n234\n00:13:05.112 --> 00:13:09.760\nso we measure that in terms of MTRS,\nmean time to restore service.\n\n235\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.284\nWe're gonna look at these,\nwhen we look at EIL or\n\n236\n00:13:12.284 --> 00:13:15.179\nexpanded incident lifecycle\nin a subsequent episode,\n\n237\n00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:18.703\nwe're actually gonna look at those\ndefinitions a little bit more.\n\n238\n00:13:18.703 --> 00:13:23.080\nSo maintainability is how\nquickly can we fix it.\n\n239\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.026\nAnd serviceability,\nhow quickly can our suppliers,\n\n240\n00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:31.156\nour third-parties,\nfix something when it goes wrong.\n\n241\n00:13:31.156 --> 00:13:34.408\nAnd then as we've already mentioned\nat vital business functions,\n\n242\n00:13:34.408 --> 00:13:35.327\nwhat we need to do.\n\n243\n00:13:35.327 --> 00:13:40.419\nI would always recommend that in\nconjunction with business relationship\n\n244\n00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:45.674\nmanagement, that it really is the role\nof service portfolio management and\n\n245\n00:13:45.674 --> 00:13:51.540\nalso service catalog management to\nensure the accuracy on an ongoing basis.\n\n246\n00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.550\nIt's the role of service\nportfolio management and\n\n247\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.420\nbusiness relationship management to\nreally come up with not just our VBS but\n\n248\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.100\nalso to prioritize our services as well.\n\n249\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.610\nWhat services are the most\nimportant to our organization?\n\n250\n00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.704\nHere we are at ITProTV.\n\n251\n00:14:07.704 --> 00:14:12.073\nSo if we were to prioritize our services,\nif we were to prioritize the things\n\n252\n00:14:12.073 --> 00:14:15.921\nthat we do here, what do you think\nwould be number one, Cherokee?\n\n253\n00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:16.590\n&gt;&gt; So, Jo,\n\n254\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.720\nthe reason I had mentioned our internet\nservice provider earlier is because that\n\n255\n00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.120\nwould be our, in my opinion our number\none service that we rely on here.\n\n256\n00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.377\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so our ability to record\nprograms, that wouldn't be our number one?\n\n257\n00:14:30.377 --> 00:14:33.167\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, we could record them and\n\n258\n00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:37.277\nif we didn't have internet,\nwe could still record them and put them in\n\n259\n00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:41.890\nthe course library, but we would lose\nthe aspect of being able to live stream.\n\n260\n00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.100\nSo yes, listening to that\nquestion in more detail there.\n\n261\n00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wasn't trying to trip you up,\nI promise you.\n\n262\n00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.437\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n263\n00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:53.379\nthese are the discussions that we have\nto have with the organization and\n\n264\n00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:56.401\nthis is why business\nrelationship management is key,\n\n265\n00:14:56.401 --> 00:15:01.208\nbecause as you've seen I was just speaking\nwith Cherokee and Cherokee is my customer.\n\n266\n00:15:01.208 --> 00:15:04.730\nI'm in IT and Cherokee says\nthis is more important to me.\n\n267\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.650\nAnd I should have foresight to be\nable to say, but what about this?\n\n268\n00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.920\nBecause you do this as well.\n\n269\n00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.397\nAnd I need to prioritize.\n\n270\n00:15:12.397 --> 00:15:17.179\nBecause if heaven forbid,\nhere we are and we suddenly,\n\n271\n00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:20.700\nI don't know we're flooded out because\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n272\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.950\n&gt;&gt; We're in Florida,\n\n273\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.570\nyou know it could happen.\n\n274\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.910\nSo if we were flooded out,\nwhat do I need to restore first?\n\n275\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.680\nWhat do I need to get back up and\nrunning first?\n\n276\n00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.363\nWhat is my first priority?\n\n277\n00:15:33.363 --> 00:15:35.805\nNow, I've already mentioned\nin previous episodes,\n\n278\n00:15:35.805 --> 00:15:38.572\nthis works hand in hand with\nservice continuity management.\n\n279\n00:15:38.572 --> 00:15:40.517\nAnd so in availability management,\n\n280\n00:15:40.517 --> 00:15:42.912\nI really need to know\nwhat my priorities are.\n\n281\n00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:47.505\nSo this is why we talk about identifying\nsome services as vital business\n\n282\n00:15:47.505 --> 00:15:49.502\nfunctions and You're right.\n\n283\n00:15:49.502 --> 00:15:53.290\nLive streaming is a vital business\nfunction but is it the number one?\n\n284\n00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:58.300\nAnd so this is why I'd always recommend\nthat we prioritize our services.\n\n285\n00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.670\nOur email service is not that important.\n\n286\n00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.560\n&gt;&gt; No.\nWe know everyone here we can walk to each\n\n287\n00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.930\nother and talk to them if need\nbe to get a show recorded.\n\n288\n00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, and also if we an hour delayed\nat sending an email out to somebody,\n\n289\n00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.310\nthat's not too much of an issue, but\n\n290\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:19.350\nif we're not able to record in any\ngiven time then that is an issue.\n\n291\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.380\nBecause in that token we could actually\nlose business because of that.\n\n292\n00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.240\nWe got a lot of people sitting\naround twiddling their thumbs\n\n293\n00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.068\nthinking we could be in the studio\nrecording something right now.\n\n294\n00:16:29.068 --> 00:16:35.490\nSo this is important to us to do,\nto prioritize our services.\n\n295\n00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.840\nSo now I'm going to take a look at each\none of these particular aspects that we've\n\n296\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.410\ngot in front of us now.\n\n297\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.770\nAnd the first one is our serviceability.\n\n298\n00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:47.400\nAnd we've got a diagram here that\nreally looks at the business itself.\n\n299\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.720\nSo as I have already mentioned,\nwhat is it the business needs to do?\n\n300\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.770\nAnd then we will agree,\nservice level agreements.\n\n301\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.500\nAnd we're specifically talking\nabout availability for\n\n302\n00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.720\nour service level agreements,\nthough, for our services.\n\n303\n00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.240\nThen we've got three services.\n\n304\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.680\nAnd we understand what makes\nup the components that make up\n\n305\n00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.680\neach of those services.\n\n306\n00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:13.060\nAnd then as we've already mentioned, we've\ngot OLAs in place with our support teams.\n\n307\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:19.060\nBut then we have contracts and\nagreements with our third parties.\n\n308\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:25.580\nNow maintainability is all about how\nwe can restore service Internally,\n\n309\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.420\nwithin those OLAs on that left\nhand side in our internal ITT.\n\n310\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.130\nWhereas serviceability is\nabout how our third parties,\n\n311\n00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.710\nhow quickly they can restore service.\n\n312\n00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:45.080\nSo we look at mean time between failure\nwhich is how long is a service up and\n\n313\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.320\nrunning, right, before it breaks?\n\n314\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.960\nIn other words,\nhow often does it break down?\n\n315\n00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.660\nIn the meantime,\n\n316\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:56.030\nto restore services, how quickly we can\nget service back up and running again.\n\n317\n00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.830\nNow this is where I wanna bring in\na really, really important definition here\n\n318\n00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.260\nor at least mention something\nin this definition.\n\n319\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.030\nWhen we talk about mean time\nto restore service, I mean,\n\n320\n00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.790\nmean time to get the service\nback to the agreed levels.\n\n321\n00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.352\nIf the agreed level is that we're\ngoing to have a mirrored server,\n\n322\n00:18:17.352 --> 00:18:22.228\nthen mean time to restore service\ndoesn't mean the mean time to\n\n323\n00:18:22.228 --> 00:18:27.121\nget that service back to the users,\nand for them to not notice.\n\n324\n00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:30.286\nIf our agreed level is mirrored server,\n\n325\n00:18:30.286 --> 00:18:34.753\nthen mean time to restore\nservice means the agreed time or\n\n326\n00:18:34.753 --> 00:18:40.910\nthe amount of time it's taken to get that\nserver running in a mirrored format.\n\n327\n00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.120\nThat's important.\n\n328\n00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.910\nI've mentioned so many times when we\nlooked at service level management and\n\n329\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.860\neven when we looked at incident\nmanagement, problem management and\n\n330\n00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:55.140\nchange management as well, and service\ntransition, I mentioned so many times how\n\n331\n00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:00.020\nimportant service level management is\nto all of our processes within ITIL.\n\n332\n00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.830\nAnd again, you can see that service level\nmanagement is incredibly important.\n\n333\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:09.890\nThe level of detail that we go\ndown to is very, very important.\n\n334\n00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.950\nCuz if the description of our service in\n\n335\n00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.130\nservice level management is just\nthe ability to send and receive email,\n\n336\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.020\nwell then we've got no targets in there\nthat will help us plan availability.\n\n337\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.220\nAll we know is that we've got to\nhave email available, that's it.\n\n338\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.350\nBut then we could get into a point\nwhere we have a ten minute\n\n339\n00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:32.530\nresponse time between pressing send and\nbetween that email actually being sent.\n\n340\n00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.340\nAnd there's nothing that we can\ndo about that because it says\n\n341\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.570\nwe just have to send it.\n\n342\n00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.090\nDoesn't say how quickly\nhave to send something.\n\n343\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.882\nSo this is why it's really important\nto have the definition of a service\n\n344\n00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:48.395\nnailed down in service level agreements,\n\n345\n00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:51.715\nbecause it allows us then to plan for\navailability.\n\n346\n00:19:51.715 --> 00:19:55.755\nIf our level of availability or\nour definition of a service is so\n\n347\n00:19:55.755 --> 00:20:01.035\nambiguous that it could be open to so\nmany interpretations, then quite simply\n\n348\n00:20:01.035 --> 00:20:04.925\nwe're never ever gonna be able to perform\navailability management very efficiently.\n\n349\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.420\nSo let's just look at\nsome basic concepts here.\n\n350\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.110\nHigh availability is exactly what I've\ntalked about where any failure is sort of\n\n351\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.310\nmasked from the users so the service\nlooks as though it's available.\n\n352\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.710\nAnd it's available to them but\nfrom my own perspective it's not.\n\n353\n00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.850\nWe need to consider what we are putting\ninto the service level agreement,\n\n354\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.390\nbecause that's the agreement\nbetween IT and the customer.\n\n355\n00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:37.180\nSo we need to consider exactly what we're\npromising, what we're committing to them.\n\n356\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.320\nFault tolerance,\nwell fault tolerance is about resilience.\n\n357\n00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.330\nYou'll more often than not see\nit mentioned as resilience as\n\n358\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.620\nopposed to fault tolerance nowadays.\n\n359\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.090\nFault tolerance is quite an old\nfashioned phrase that we used to use.\n\n360\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.690\nAnd it just means simply how many knocks\ndoes something take before it actually\n\n361\n00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.880\nfails.\n\n362\n00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:01.370\nContinuous operation where\nthere is no planned downtime.\n\n363\n00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.660\nBut our service is still up and running.\n\n364\n00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.890\nIt's just that everything else\nhappens in the background.\n\n365\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.840\nSo the service is still up and running.\n\n366\n00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.970\nBut other components may be down.\n\n367\n00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.460\nSo you can tie that in with\nhigh availability, but\n\n368\n00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.720\nthink about taking backups for instance.\n\n369\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.310\nNowadays we take a lot\nof incremental backups.\n\n370\n00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.470\nAnd they're taken during live\nproduction environments, so\n\n371\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.260\nour service is still up and running.\n\n372\n00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.320\nBut actually we're doing\nsomething in the background here.\n\n373\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.190\nAnd look at continuous availability,\n\n374\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.040\nwhere the service is actually designed for\n100% availability,\n\n375\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.720\nwhich means that every single component\nis up and working 100% of the time.\n\n376\n00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.650\nSo think about the high resilient\nnature of that particular service.\n\n377\n00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.630\nAlso think about the cost\nof that service as well.\n\n378\n00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:45.378\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking.\n\n379\n00:21:45.378 --> 00:21:46.853\n[NOISE] Like wow.\n\n380\n00:21:46.853 --> 00:21:48.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n381\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.160\n&gt;&gt; Even looking at your five nines.\n\n382\n00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.660\nThat's a high goal, right?\n\n383\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.638\nBut 100% of the time.\n\n384\n00:21:52.638 --> 00:21:57.220\n&gt;&gt; You know what we tend to do in our\nindustry in this instance is we tend to\n\n385\n00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.075\ngive to give it to\nsomebody else to manage.\n\n386\n00:22:00.075 --> 00:22:02.645\nAnd it's part of risk management and\nwhen you think\n\n387\n00:22:02.645 --> 00:22:06.480\nabout sort of risk evaluation there are\nfour things that we might do with risk.\n\n388\n00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.067\nWe identify a risk and we either choose to\naccept it, which says yeah I understand\n\n389\n00:22:11.067 --> 00:22:13.825\nthere's a risk there, but\nI'm not gonna do anything about it.\n\n390\n00:22:13.825 --> 00:22:15.615\nWe can chose to mitigate against it.\n\n391\n00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.460\nMitigate against it means we're\ngonna try to prevent it or\n\n392\n00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.940\nwe can mitigate against the impact of it,\nso we won't try and prevent it, but\n\n393\n00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.820\nwe'll try to prevent any impact.\n\n394\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.000\nThen, we can transfer that\nrisk to somebody else or\n\n395\n00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.640\nwe can share the risk with somebody else.\n\n396\n00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.350\nA lot of instances where an organization\nneeds continuous availability,\n\n397\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.750\nthen they will actually transfer\nthat risk to somebody else.\n\n398\n00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.890\nSo think about our global organizations.\n\n399\n00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:44.630\nAnd the global organizations\nthat are available for\n\n400\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.920\n24 hours a day around the world,\nbecause they operate around the world.\n\n401\n00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.818\nYou can think of any\norganization now that does this.\n\n402\n00:22:50.818 --> 00:22:58.150\nMost of our organizations, it's not just\nIBM but you know our drug companies.\n\n403\n00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:02.713\nWe have got so many organizations,\naccountancy firms, etc that operate.\n\n404\n00:23:02.713 --> 00:23:04.670\n&gt;&gt; Sure, what about the travel industry?\n\n405\n00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.440\nThey're not managing all of their systems,\n\n406\n00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.180\nthey're gonna be\noutsourcing a lot of that.\n\n407\n00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.880\nSo their main function, make sure you're\ngetting to where you need to go and\n\n408\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.400\nkeeping all those logistical\ncomponents running.\n\n409\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.630\nBut then IT as an offset of that.\n\n410\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, so what we will do is we\nwill chose in those instances to\n\n411\n00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.080\nutilize what we call\nSoftware as a Service.\n\n412\n00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.310\nAnd Software as a Service means that\nwe'll give it to somebody else to manage\n\n413\n00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.180\nbasically.\n\n414\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.661\nSo we're transferring that risk.\n\n415\n00:23:28.661 --> 00:23:30.874\nSo a lot of organizations now,\n\n416\n00:23:30.874 --> 00:23:36.408\nglobal organizations will actually pass\non the management of their office,\n\n417\n00:23:36.408 --> 00:23:41.702\ntheir email system and their office\nenvironment to Microsoft directly.\n\n418\n00:23:41.702 --> 00:23:43.462\nAnd Microsoft will manage this for them.\n\n419\n00:23:43.462 --> 00:23:47.177\nSo Microsoft managed their\nExchange servers and\n\n420\n00:23:47.177 --> 00:23:52.710\nMicrosoft as a service will manage\nall of their Office products.\n\n421\n00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:58.440\nAnd so we will choose to do that as one\nway to ensure continuous availability.\n\n422\n00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.530\nAnd think about scalability\nwhen we're discussing this,\n\n423\n00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:06.000\nbecause the larger the organization,\nthe more likely it is for that to happen.\n\n424\n00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.684\nWith a smaller organization,\n\n425\n00:24:07.684 --> 00:24:11.644\nthen it's highly unlikely that we\nneed that continuous availability.\n\n426\n00:24:11.644 --> 00:24:13.979\nJust remember that continuous\navailability costs money.\n\n427\n00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:18.840\nAnd it doesn't matter whether it's a small\norganization or a large organization.\n\n428\n00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.650\nIt's always going to cost a lot of money\nto ensure continuous availability.\n\n429\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:28.020\nSo moving a service to an outsource\nprovider, as in software as a service,\n\n430\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.910\nas in Microsoft for instance,\nit's going to cost.\n\n431\n00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.520\nIt's something that we\nare going to have to plan for.\n\n432\n00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.660\nSo again, part of availability management,\npart of planning.\n\n433\n00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.670\nAnd it doesn't mean that we just simply\nturn our backs and say, all right,\n\n434\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.040\nthat's it, that's covered.\n\n435\n00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.770\nBecause obviously it still\naffects our users directly, so\n\n436\n00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.480\nwe still have to manage that.\n\n437\n00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.280\nSo much, as it says in this next slide, a\ngood availability depends on measurement.\n\n438\n00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.120\nBecause I think so, [LAUGH] it's not\na good measurement of whether we are able\n\n439\n00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.970\nto deliver the availability of a service\nas per, well, the agreed service.\n\n440\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:17.120\nJust by itself, the term service\nlevel target refers to a measurement.\n\n441\n00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:23.522\nWe have to agree when we're\ngoing to deliver a service by.\n\n442\n00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:28.170\nWe have to agree within what parameters\nwe're going to deliver that service.\n\n443\n00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.828\nAnd we have to agree on how we're\ngoing to manage that service.\n\n444\n00:25:31.828 --> 00:25:33.973\nI've mentioned this quite a lot now,\n\n445\n00:25:33.973 --> 00:25:36.866\nwhat's in the service\nlevel agreement document.\n\n446\n00:25:36.866 --> 00:25:40.900\nThat agreement between IT and\nthe customer is really, really important.\n\n447\n00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.660\nAnd the level of detail that you\ngo down to is really important.\n\n448\n00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.920\nNow, I don't expect\nCherokee to remember this,\n\n449\n00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.292\nbut I do expect for you to remember this.\n\n450\n00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:52.741\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n451\n00:25:52.741 --> 00:25:55.336\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great tagline, Jo.\n\n452\n00:25:55.336 --> 00:25:56.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but, you know what?\n\n453\n00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.710\nYou might not have been in\nthe section where we covered this.\n\n454\n00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.120\nYou might not have been with me\nin that episode, so it's okay.\n\n455\n00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.025\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I'll blame it on that.\n\n456\n00:26:02.025 --> 00:26:05.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll give you a hall pass for\nthat, all right?\n\n457\n00:26:05.545 --> 00:26:09.636\nYeah, no,\nif you remember service level management,\n\n458\n00:26:09.636 --> 00:26:12.603\nwe produced reports on a regular basis.\n\n459\n00:26:12.603 --> 00:26:17.355\nThat regular basis depended on the\nfrequency of those service review meetings\n\n460\n00:26:17.355 --> 00:26:21.099\nthat we have between service\nlevel manager and the customer.\n\n461\n00:26:21.099 --> 00:26:24.132\nAnd we called those reports SLAM charts,\n\n462\n00:26:24.132 --> 00:26:27.780\nour Service Level Agreement Monitoring\ncharts.\n\n463\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.344\nBy SLAM charts, generally displayed in\ncolors, red, amber, green, rag charts.\n\n464\n00:26:32.344 --> 00:26:35.639\nOr, okay, for\nthose of us that are in the States,\n\n465\n00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:40.030\nI'll keep Cherokee happy,\nred, yellow, green.\n\n466\n00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.500\nThat makes a ryg chart.\n\n467\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.785\nThat sounds awful.\n\n468\n00:26:42.785 --> 00:26:45.355\nI just wanna say that,\nI'm sticking with rag, okay?\n\n469\n00:26:45.355 --> 00:26:46.780\nI'm sticking with it.\n\n470\n00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.270\nWe produce these rag charts and\nthese rag charts will show us.\n\n471\n00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.060\n&gt;&gt; We call them traffic light charts.\n\n472\n00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.280\n&gt;&gt; You call them traffic light charts?\n\n473\n00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.160\nThere's nothing like overcomplicating\nsomething, is there?\n\n474\n00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.540\nWhen three letters will do,\nwhy not have a whole complete sentence?\n\n475\n00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.723\nThis is ITIL,\nwe're looking at efficiency here.\n\n476\n00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:06.390\nThat is not efficient.\n\n477\n00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.087\n&gt;&gt; I can't make this stuff up.\n\n478\n00:27:08.087 --> 00:27:12.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So our red, amber,\n\n479\n00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.470\ngreen charts, our rag charts,\nor our traffic light charts,\n\n480\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.800\nwill tell us about our performance\nagainst those service level targets.\n\n481\n00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.080\nAnd we will definitely have service\nlevel targets for availability.\n\n482\n00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.761\nAnd those service level targets will look\nat the mean time to restore service,\n\n483\n00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:29.120\nthey'll look at the mean\ntime between failures.\n\n484\n00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.480\nThey will look at how\noften something fails,\n\n485\n00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.900\nas well as how quickly we\ncan restore services well.\n\n486\n00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:39.329\nSo I don't they expect\navailability just to be mentioned\n\n487\n00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:43.190\nin terms of Bbtween 7AM of 5AM and 10PM.\n\n488\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.600\nThat's not about it,\nthat's not it in its entirety.\n\n489\n00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.850\nI'm talking about availability as being,\nwell,\n\n490\n00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.520\ndoes it actually perform\nits agreed function?\n\n491\n00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.940\nSo if I have mirrored service,\nthen are both of them available?\n\n492\n00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.045\nIf I have specific\ntransaction throughput rates,\n\n493\n00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:03.591\nthen am I achieving those\ntransaction throughput rates?\n\n494\n00:28:03.591 --> 00:28:09.479\nIf I have a failure, well, if my\navailability is expressed between 5AM and\n\n495\n00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:13.803\n10PM and it has to be available for\n99% of the time,\n\n496\n00:28:13.803 --> 00:28:17.480\nthen am I meeting 99% of the time?\n\n497\n00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:23.589\nOr has there been a failure, and\nthat means that we don't meet that 99%?\n\n498\n00:28:23.589 --> 00:28:26.540\nAnd in fact, it's actually been down for\n5% of the time.\n\n499\n00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.101\nIt has to be defined in the SLA.\n\n500\n00:28:30.101 --> 00:28:33.610\nAnd so\nour SLA has to be incredibly detailed.\n\n501\n00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:34.470\nDetailed enough for\n\n502\n00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:40.780\nus to be able to get an accurate measure\non our performance against those targets.\n\n503\n00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:46.160\nAs it already says there, if you can't\nmeasure it, then you can't manage it.\n\n504\n00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.070\nIf you don't measure it,\nthen we simply can't improve it.\n\n505\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.920\nNow, it does say if you don't measure it,\nthen you probably don't care.\n\n506\n00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:56.610\nIs that a true statement or not?\n\n507\n00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.210\nWell, yes, I really do believe that.\n\n508\n00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.890\nBecause if you don't measure it,\nif you can't work out with something\n\n509\n00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:07.170\nis being delivered to any specific\ntargets, then that probably means that all\n\n510\n00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.990\nyou're interested in is just saying,\nyes, it's there.\n\n511\n00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.758\nIt probably means that all you're\ninterested in doing is just checking\n\n512\n00:29:13.758 --> 00:29:15.090\nthe box or ticking a box.\n\n513\n00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.274\nBut the one thing that I will say is that,\nof course,\n\n514\n00:29:17.274 --> 00:29:20.170\nin ITIL we're interested in efficiency and\neffectiveness.\n\n515\n00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:24.173\nAnd so if you're not going to do\nanything with it, then don't measure it.\n\n516\n00:29:24.173 --> 00:29:29.097\nTake a look at knowledge management in\nour service transition lifecycle phase.\n\n517\n00:29:29.097 --> 00:29:34.120\nAnd you will hear me tell you quite\na lot that we only produce reports\n\n518\n00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.930\nif we're going to be able to make\nan informed decision from that report.\n\n519\n00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.300\nIn other words, we only produce a nice,\n\n520\n00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.030\npretty picture if we're\ngonna do something with it.\n\n521\n00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.567\nIf we're not gonna do something\nwith it and we're not gonna\n\n522\n00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:49.128\nmake an informed decision, then we're-\n&gt;&gt; We're wasting\n\n523\n00:29:49.128 --> 00:29:51.686\ntime generating the report,\nand then wasting time for\n\n524\n00:29:51.686 --> 00:29:53.864\nhaving people look at\nthese useless reports.\n\n525\n00:29:53.864 --> 00:29:55.969\n&gt;&gt; Right, and in fact, people don't\nlook at these useless reports.\n\n526\n00:29:55.969 --> 00:29:58.698\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, what happens is that we see reports\n\n527\n00:29:58.698 --> 00:30:02.770\nsitting on desks all the time\nthat are never, ever referred to.\n\n528\n00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.059\nAnd so, we'll tell you in ITIL,\n\n529\n00:30:04.059 --> 00:30:06.697\ndon't produce a report unless\nyou're gonna do something with it.\n\n530\n00:30:06.697 --> 00:30:09.850\nAnd that's exactly the same with\navailability management reports.\n\n531\n00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.080\nAnd that's why it's so important\nthat we get our targets perfect, so\n\n532\n00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.540\nthat we know what we're measuring.\n\n533\n00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:19.270\nBecause otherwise, and I'll say this in\nservice level management all the time,\n\n534\n00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:23.340\nthe color that I do not want to\nsee in a SLAM chart is green.\n\n535\n00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.020\nBecause that tells me that you're\nachieving all of your targets, and\n\n536\n00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.750\nI don't believe you, simple as that.\n\n537\n00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:29.930\nCall me cynical.\n\n538\n00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.380\nAll right,\nmaybe I'm a glass half-empty type person.\n\n539\n00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.360\nI'm not really, but\nI don't wanna see green.\n\n540\n00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.138\nBecause I guarantee that I'll go to any\none of your customers and I'll say,\n\n541\n00:30:39.138 --> 00:30:43.459\nare you happy with absolutely everything,\nand they're gonna turn around and say no.\n\n542\n00:30:43.459 --> 00:30:45.542\nIf they're not happy but\nyour SLAM charts agree,\n\n543\n00:30:45.542 --> 00:30:48.725\nthen there's something wrong\nwith what you're measuring.\n\n544\n00:30:48.725 --> 00:30:50.320\nSo think about what we're measuring.\n\n545\n00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.790\nI know that we look at this in\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n546\n00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.460\nAnd we looked at this in\nservice level management.\n\n547\n00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:00.260\nBut again, if we're going to agree\nto deliver availability management\n\n548\n00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.230\nto agreed target, then those targets\nhave gotta be meaningful, right?\n\n549\n00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.900\nAnd we've gotta be able\nto achieve those targets.\n\n550\n00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:11.680\nDon't forget that acronym, SMART,\nwith all of our targets, our KPIs as well.\n\n551\n00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.796\nSo what I'm gonna leave you with\nis exactly where we started.\n\n552\n00:31:15.796 --> 00:31:20.770\nAnd this is gonna be exactly where we\nstart in our next episode as well.\n\n553\n00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.732\nJust looking at the proactive and\n\n554\n00:31:22.732 --> 00:31:26.035\nthe reactive activities of\nAvailability Management.\n\n555\n00:31:26.035 --> 00:31:27.610\nAnd in our next episode,\n\n556\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:32.722\nwe're going to focus on some reactive\nactivities of availability management.\n\n557\n00:31:32.722 --> 00:31:34.348\nAnd then in subsequent episodes,\n\n558\n00:31:34.348 --> 00:31:38.560\nwe'll be looking at proactive activities\nof availability management too.\n\n559\n00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.557\n&gt;&gt; Well, it sounds like you\nhave everything planned out.\n\n560\n00:31:40.557 --> 00:31:44.072\nJust like we should be doing when we're\ntalking about availability management, so\n\n561\n00:31:44.072 --> 00:31:45.430\nthank you for that, Jo.\n\n562\n00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.340\nBut thank you for joining us as well.\n\n563\n00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.720\nStay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n564\n00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.440\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n565\n00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.308\nRemember I've been your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n566\n00:31:53.308 --> 00:31:54.307\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:08.049\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.009\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.340\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL Intermediate\nSeries, I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.770\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ntalking about Availability Management,\n\n7\n00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.128\nwe're actually in a part three.\n\n8\n00:00:22.128 --> 00:00:24.793\nSo far Jo's given us some\npretty great tips, and\n\n9\n00:00:24.793 --> 00:00:28.764\nwe were able to get her back in studios\ntoday to continue with this topic.\n\n10\n00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:29.820\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.340\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.156\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:33.746\n&gt;&gt; I had to bribe her with cookies.\n\n14\n00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:35.483\n&gt;&gt; Actually that's not a bad idea yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:37.804\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's only joking right.\n\n16\n00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:42.570\n&gt;&gt; All I had to say was Availability\nManagement and she was there spot on.\n\n17\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.569\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't quite like that.\n\n18\n00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:44.724\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He wasn't.\n\n19\n00:00:44.724 --> 00:00:46.456\nIt was the cookies but anyway.\n\n20\n00:00:46.456 --> 00:00:48.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nwhat is the first will be looking out?\n\n21\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.747\nI know we have talking about it,\na good amount here but\n\n22\n00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:56.009\nwe have a couple of other things at I\nknow you wouldn't cover here in the show.\n\n23\n00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:57.191\n&gt;&gt; Believe me,\nI've got more than a couple.\n\n24\n00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:58.735\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:00:58.735 --> 00:00:59.790\n&gt;&gt; Of course you do.\n\n26\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course I do.\n\n27\n00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.458\nCome one, when have you only ever\nknown me to talk for two minutes?\n\n28\n00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:05.446\nNo, we got more than a couple\nof things to cover here.\n\n29\n00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:11.550\nI'm gonna start off by looking at\nthis favorite diagram of mine, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.958\nIt's how we've ended up\nour previous episode, and\n\n31\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.540\nit's how we started off our\nprevious episodes as well.\n\n32\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.268\nSo we're gonna look at this same diagram,\nand I just want to remind you that\n\n33\n00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:23.480\navailability management is about\nplanning for availability.\n\n34\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.520\nDown at the bottom there,\nour proactive activities.\n\n35\n00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.780\nBut it's also about, well, acknowledging\nthe fact that availability can be\n\n36\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.120\nhampered in the real world,\nin our life production environment, and\n\n37\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.510\nit doesn't matter how well\nwe plan things go wrong.\n\n38\n00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.630\nSo we have reactive activities for\navailability management.\n\n39\n00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.050\nSo we're going to look at\nthis particular episode.\n\n40\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.063\nWe're going to focus on the reactive\nactivity of the extended or\n\n41\n00:01:49.063 --> 00:01:51.890\nexpanded incident lifecycle.\n\n42\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.650\nIt's an acronym.\n\n43\n00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.630\nWe call it EIL, and in some books it's\nwritten extended and in some books it's\n\n44\n00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.240\nwritten expanded, and it doesn't\nreally matter which one you use.\n\n45\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.382\nBut reactive availability management is\n\n46\n00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:09.160\nall about monitoring our\nlive production service.\n\n47\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.270\nMonitoring our live environment and\nidentifying when something's gone wrong.\n\n48\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.930\nNow, incident management is going to\nhelp us with that, and then to try and\n\n49\n00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.000\nfix it when it does go wrong.\n\n50\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.570\nGet it back up and\nrunning as quickly as we possibly can.\n\n51\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.961\nSo we're monitoring,\nwe're measuring, we're analyzing and\n\n52\n00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.857\nreporting on both service and\ncomponent availability, as it says there.\n\n53\n00:02:31.857 --> 00:02:34.870\nEvent management is\ngonna help us with this.\n\n54\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.600\nWe're not gonna to be doing\nthe monitoring in Installation and\n\n55\n00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.750\nin fact what we should be doing\nis ensuring that event management\n\n56\n00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.970\nhas the right parameters in place to\nactually do the monitoring for us.\n\n57\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.050\nRemember ITILS is about two ways.\n\n58\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.126\nIt's about efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n59\n00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:54.333\nAnd it's never going to be efficient for\nus to well,\n\n60\n00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:59.560\nto do something that duplicates\nwhat somebody else is doing.\n\n61\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.670\nSo, if event management is actually\nmonitoring as specific service or\n\n62\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.855\na specific component then let's\nleave event management to\n\n63\n00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.955\nwe don't have to do that as well\nduplication is certainly not efficient.\n\n64\n00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:16.245\nWhat we're going to be doing is we're\ngoing to be taking what event management\n\n65\n00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:19.705\nis monitoring, and we'll be telling event\nmanagement what to monitor as well.\n\n66\n00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:23.133\nAnd then we're going to be\nanalyzing what's happening.\n\n67\n00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:27.796\nAnd assisting incident and problem\nmanagement at the same time to ensure that\n\n68\n00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:33.460\nour service is, well, we restored them\nwithin our availability parameters.\n\n69\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.117\nSo we have got to initially when we start\noff with any new service we as it says in\n\n70\n00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:41.714\nthat bullet point,\nestablish measures of availability.\n\n71\n00:03:41.714 --> 00:03:44.650\nWhat is availability really look like?\n\n72\n00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.932\nAnd I mentioned in previous episodes that\nwe've got to be very specific about what\n\n73\n00:03:48.932 --> 00:03:50.490\navailability really means.\n\n74\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.593\nAnd then we go to identify one\navailability jobs, sometimes, not all\n\n75\n00:03:55.593 --> 00:04:01.920\nthe time, sometimes availability drops and\nit's not being reported as an incident.\n\n76\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.307\nThink about when we have\nmirrored service for instance.\n\n77\n00:04:06.307 --> 00:04:08.270\nSo if we have a mirrored server and\n\n78\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.810\none goes down then management\nshould pick that up.\n\n79\n00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.070\nI should hope they pick that up.\n\n80\n00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.810\nIf the Event Management do not pick\nthe fact up that a server has failed,\n\n81\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.420\nthen we seriously need to\nlook at Event Management.\n\n82\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.020\nSo Event Management should pick that up.\n\n83\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.933\nIncident Management may not pick that up.\n\n84\n00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.510\nEvent Management, I should hope,\nwill raise an incident automatically.\n\n85\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.116\nBut I don't expect our users to notice.\n\n86\n00:04:32.116 --> 00:04:35.620\nSo I don't expect anybody to have\ncalled the service desk to say,\n\n87\n00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.825\nhey one of our servers has failed because\nthey should be carrying on business as\n\n88\n00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:41.782\nusual as per normal.\n\n89\n00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.550\nBut event management\nshould pick that up and\n\n90\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.160\navailability management then needs to\nwork towards restoring that service.\n\n91\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.836\nBecause we have to make sure that our\nservice is available as per what's agreed\n\n92\n00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:53.792\nwith the business.\n\n93\n00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:57.249\nAnd if the business say that we should\nhave two-mirrored service then we should\n\n94\n00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.300\nhave two-mirrored service.\n\n95\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.281\nSo we should be identifying that\nunacceptable level of availability, and\n\n96\n00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:05.948\nthen we should be trying\nto do something about it.\n\n97\n00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:11.524\nAnd then on a regular basis, probably\nthrough the service review meeting that we\n\n98\n00:05:11.524 --> 00:05:17.350\nhave between service level management and\ntheir customers on a regular basis.\n\n99\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.273\nWe should be discussing levels of\navailability with our customers,\n\n100\n00:05:21.273 --> 00:05:25.412\nbecause we should perhaps be doing\nsomething to improve availability.\n\n101\n00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:28.031\nOr maybe we want to adjust the targets and\n\n102\n00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:32.201\nthe parameters that we have agreed\nto deliver a service within.\n\n103\n00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:36.179\nWe always want to ensure that we're\nrelying to the needs of the organization,\n\n104\n00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:39.740\nand that's what CSI is about,\nContinual Service Improvement.\n\n105\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.136\nWhich is why that's brought in, because\nevery single process is subject to CSI.\n\n106\n00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:46.184\nSo what do we look for?\n\n107\n00:05:46.184 --> 00:05:52.270\nWell, traditionally we look for percentage\navailability or percentage unavailability.\n\n108\n00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.820\nAnd we're looking for\nhow many failures we've had,\n\n109\n00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.130\nwhat the duration of those failures were,\nwhat the impact of those failures were.\n\n110\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.710\nBut now, more than ever before, we have to\n\n111\n00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.560\ndemonstrate the cost effectiveness or\nefficiency in terms of finances.\n\n112\n00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.326\nIn other words, we have to demonstrate\nthat we really are the best choice for\n\n113\n00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:16.870\nthe organization.\n\n114\n00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.919\nSo we also have to look at the impact\nof unavailability and that impact of\n\n115\n00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.630\nunavailability can be articulated in\nterms of user minutes that were down.\n\n116\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.180\nIt can be articulated in terms of\nbusiness transactions that were lost It\n\n117\n00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.324\ncan also be articulated in\nterms of money as well.\n\n118\n00:06:35.324 --> 00:06:37.650\nSo how much money was lost?\n\n119\n00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.930\nIt's easy to articulate how much money\nwas lost if were in a sales environment,\n\n120\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.553\nif we were in a sales environment\nyou can say that, okay,\n\n121\n00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:51.270\nour payment processing system was down for\n10 minutes.\n\n122\n00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.039\nWe normally take in 5,000 pounds or\n$5,000 in 10 minutes,\n\n123\n00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.207\ntherefore, we've lost 5,000 pounds or\n$5,000.\n\n124\n00:07:00.207 --> 00:07:05.320\nAnd that's easy enough to do but quite\noften it's not just about that because\n\n125\n00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.370\nwe've actually got 10 minutes worth of\npeople sitting around doing nothing.\n\n126\n00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.992\nSo it's not just loss of sales but\nit's also user minutes as well.\n\n127\n00:07:13.992 --> 00:07:18.570\nWell that's 10 minutes worth of salary\nacross the board of say 5,000 people.\n\n128\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.609\nNow all of a sudden that $5,000 or\n\n129\n00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:27.710\n5,000 pounds is suddenly insignificant\nwhen you compare it to that.\n\n130\n00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.110\nCherokee, you had a question?\n\n131\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Jo sometimes when you're talking\nabout being able to identify that\n\n132\n00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.830\nparticular loss and\nwe look at hard numbers,\n\n133\n00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.880\nwe're looking at qualitative analysis and\nwe can easily attach a monetary figure.\n\n134\n00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.686\nBut sometimes that's not always the case,\nright?\n\n135\n00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:46.976\nJust sometimes we have qualitative\nanalysis that we need to think\n\n136\n00:07:46.976 --> 00:07:50.799\nabout when it comes to things\nlike brand reputation loss.\n\n137\n00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:52.690\nWhat did that cost us as an organization?\n\n138\n00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.682\n&gt;&gt; Well, we like to try and take the\nqualitative and turn it into quantitive.\n\n139\n00:07:57.682 --> 00:07:59.696\nWhich is not that easy.\n\n140\n00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:04.368\nIt's not that easy to say it either.\n\n141\n00:08:04.368 --> 00:08:04.877\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n142\n00:08:04.877 --> 00:08:05.867\n&gt;&gt; We wanna take that,\n\n143\n00:08:05.867 --> 00:08:09.900\nand we'll use things like satisfaction\nsurveys to help us do that.\n\n144\n00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.220\nObviously, that's not really\nthe bottom line, though.\n\n145\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.960\nLet's think about where we are right now.\n\n146\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.660\nHere we are in a TV studio, and we're\ndoing two things, really, simultaneously.\n\n147\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.400\nWe are streaming live via the Internet,\nvia our website,\n\n148\n00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.040\nvia our-\n&gt;&gt; Even Facebook.\n\n149\n00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.910\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n150\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.390\nYes so\nhey everybody that's out there right now.\n\n151\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.640\nWe're streaming live, but\nwe're also recording so\n\n152\n00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.700\nthat people can watch\nthis at a later date.\n\n153\n00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.480\nSo let's just say for instance, in\na previous episode we were talking about,\n\n154\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.850\nI had a reward for\ngetting through a previous episode.\n\n155\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.000\nThis is terrible by the way.\n\n156\n00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.745\nShe makes me sound like such a bad person.\n\n157\n00:08:47.745 --> 00:08:49.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This time it was cookies.\n\n158\n00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.398\nLast time it was watching a blooper reel.\n\n159\n00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:53.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n160\n00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:57.700\nin a previous episode we mentioned that,\nwe talked about blooper reels, and\n\n161\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.910\nI'll be the first one to make a mistake.\n\n162\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.490\nI always am.\n\n163\n00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.300\nWhat's the cost of downtime?\n\n164\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.000\nOkay?\nWhat's the cause of downtime?\n\n165\n00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.705\nLet's just say, for instance,\nthat I said something that I shouldn't.\n\n166\n00:09:09.705 --> 00:09:11.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n167\n00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.485\n&gt;&gt; I'm British.\nIt's possible.\n\n168\n00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:15.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's just say I said something\n\n169\n00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.080\nthat I shouldn't.\n\n170\n00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.610\nWhat about loss of credibility to us as\norganization if I do something like that?\n\n171\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.160\nThat really is unquantifiable.\n\n172\n00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.220\nIt really is.\n\n173\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.910\nWhat about the downtime that's caused\nby a thunderstorm, for instance?\n\n174\n00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.880\nIf it thunders too loudly,\nthen we have to stop recording.\n\n175\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.250\nNow we can't just record that in terms of\nlost sales, because actually there's no\n\n176\n00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:45.870\nway of working out what our lost\nsales were because maybe Joe's said\n\n177\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.090\nsomething that she shouldn't have said, or\nmaybe because there was a thunderstorm.\n\n178\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.640\n&gt;&gt; And I am thinking, now I'm questioning,\n\n179\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.245\ndid I say, qualitative versus\nquantitative the right way?\n\n180\n00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:55.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you guys might wann go back and\n\n181\n00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.460\ncheck and make sure I used those terms\nproperly, cuz they are very similar.\n\n182\n00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.330\nBut yes,\nyou have me questioning myself right now.\n\n183\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.130\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n184\n00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:02.700\nYeah.\n\n185\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.150\nWell, let's, no,\nyou don't get any cookies.\n\n186\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.660\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; But, yeah.\n\n187\n00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.690\nI mean, we gotta think about this in terms\nof loss of availability of our service,\n\n188\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.520\nand we will expect any organization\nto be able to work that out.\n\n189\n00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.970\nWe've got to know how\nmuch downtime costs us.\n\n190\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.750\nBecause if the downtime is\ncaused by the fact that,\n\n191\n00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.898\nwell, Ronny didn't plug the right thing\nin in the server room earlier on today.\n\n192\n00:10:29.898 --> 00:10:30.750\nI saw him.\nHe was in there.\n\n193\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.405\nHe was patching something or other.\n\n194\n00:10:32.405 --> 00:10:34.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what he was doing, but\n\n195\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.290\nlet's just say that he didn't plug\nsomething back in that he should\n\n196\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.890\nhave plugged in.\n\n197\n00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.275\nWhat's the cost of downtime to us?\n\n198\n00:10:40.275 --> 00:10:44.630\nWe've got to be able to\narticulate that because\n\n199\n00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.040\nthat's in terms of lost revenue,\nbut it could be more than that.\n\n200\n00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.520\nIt could be in terms of loss of\ncredibility or loss of our reputation, so\n\n201\n00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.490\nwe have to be able to measure\nboth the quantitative results,\n\n202\n00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.820\nthe actual figures, but also we have\nto be able to measure quality, too.\n\n203\n00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:09.260\nSo, let's just take a look\nat our next slide here.\n\n204\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.560\nAnd it says here, we can only really\nbegin to measure our availability\n\n205\n00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.620\nmanagement once we understand\nreally what our services do.\n\n206\n00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.680\nAnd it goes back to both\nthe qualitative and the quantitative.\n\n207\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.580\nSo it's not just about,\nas it says in the bullet points,\n\n208\n00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.780\nthe minimal level of functionality.\n\n209\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.520\nBut it's also about, and\nI've mentioned this in previous episodes,\n\n210\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.280\nat what point is the service\nconsidered unavailable?\n\n211\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.510\nIf it states in the service level\nagreement that we should have two servers\n\n212\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.070\nand that they should be mirrored then\nin that case if one of them goes down,\n\n213\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.330\nthen is that service unavailable or not?\n\n214\n00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.300\nSome organizations will actually\ndifferentiate now between\n\n215\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.150\nthe unavailability of\na service as a whole and\n\n216\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.340\nthe unavailability of\na service to the end user.\n\n217\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:54.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n218\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.880\n&gt;&gt; Because there's\na difference between the two.\n\n219\n00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.680\n&gt;&gt; I could see that, yeah.\n\n220\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.130\nAs long as,\nif you're crippled a little bit, but\n\n221\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.040\nyou're still able to offer that service,\n\n222\n00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.480\nbut on the back end you've got maintenance\nto do, then that's something to consider.\n\n223\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n224\n00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.780\nAnd so we've gotta now consider then,\nif that's what we're going to do,\n\n225\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.460\nhow are we going to measure that?\n\n226\n00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:16.710\nExactly how do we articulate this in\nterms of availability to our users?\n\n227\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.190\nI will never ever tell you that\nyou should be secretive in this.\n\n228\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:20.940\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n229\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.950\n&gt;&gt; And yet it seems to me that\nit's quite a common concept for\n\n230\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.360\na lot of organizations where we\nwanna keep that to ourselves.\n\n231\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.280\nYeah that's IT information.\n\n232\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.570\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n233\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:37.330\n&gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you that we should have\ntechnical reports, of course we should.\n\n234\n00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.930\nAnd we've also gotta think about\nthe language of any report,\n\n235\n00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.360\nand it's gotta be in\nthe language of the audience.\n\n236\n00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.630\nYour end users and your customers\ndon't want to see technical details.\n\n237\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.980\nThey might not want to see specific\ncomponent availability, and we do in IT.\n\n238\n00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.310\nAnd that can sometimes be misconstrued\nas being quite secretive because\n\n239\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.520\nwe're keeping it to ourselves.\n\n240\n00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.900\nAnd we shouldn't be secretive.\n\n241\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:04.780\nWe're about delivering value to the\nbusiness, to our customers and our users.\n\n242\n00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.160\nThis is not about doing this for\nourselves.\n\n243\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.830\nSo we have to be able to articulate things\nin a way that our customers understand,\n\n244\n00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.780\nbut we also have to be able\nto articulate availability\n\n245\n00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.800\nin a way that we can do something with it.\n\n246\n00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.980\nBecause we're analyzing what went wrong,\nand\n\n247\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.190\nwe're analyzing what we\ncan do about it as well.\n\n248\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:28.430\nSo we have to first of all acknowledge\nwhat is considered to be unavailability\n\n249\n00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.180\n&gt;&gt; Sure we can't just say like fast speeds\n\n250\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.660\nunless you use units of measurement here.\n\n251\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly that,\n\n252\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.270\nand we'll look at that a little bit\nfurther in capacity management.\n\n253\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.006\nIt's about bandwidth.\n\n254\n00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:41.530\nIt's about transaction throughput rate.\n\n255\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:47.240\nIt's about performance, and\nwe've got to consider what do we mean by-\n\n256\n00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.510\n&gt;&gt; High speed internet.\n\n257\n00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.336\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n258\n00:13:50.336 --> 00:13:52.014\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n259\n00:13:52.014 --> 00:13:54.540\nI'm gonna get on my soap box right now,\nokay?\n\n260\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.525\nI've got to do this.\n\n261\n00:13:56.525 --> 00:14:00.075\nAnywhere that says, right, and\nwe're talking about high speed Internet.\n\n262\n00:14:00.075 --> 00:14:05.125\nAnywhere that says we will guarantee\nyou up to eight megabits per second.\n\n263\n00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:09.895\nJust remember that one megabit\nper second is up to eight.\n\n264\n00:14:09.895 --> 00:14:13.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We will never, ever, ever recommend\n\n265\n00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.720\nthat that sort of terminology is\nused in any service level agreement.\n\n266\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.880\n&gt;&gt; They could cover it with\nadvertising that's for sure.\n\n267\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.390\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nit frustrates the life out of me.\n\n268\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.090\nIt really, really does, and so\n\n269\n00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.860\nwe will never ever recommend\nthat this is what you do.\n\n270\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.310\nWe'll never recommend this.\n\n271\n00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.950\nWe will always tell you that you\nshould be very very specific.\n\n272\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.810\nBut remember,\nwe're not guaranteeing anything.\n\n273\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.800\nWe're just ensuring our level of service.\n\n274\n00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.110\nWe're not actually guaranteeing it.\n\n275\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.210\nSo let's get back to this reactive\navailability management then.\n\n276\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:48.730\nAnd reactive availability management is\njust about ensuring that if something\n\n277\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.390\ngoes wrong, that we're able to pick up\nthe pieces and we're able to restore it.\n\n278\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.410\nWe're thinking about maintainability and\nserviceability.\n\n279\n00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.560\nSo go back to our previous\nepisode if you're looking for\n\n280\n00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.620\nmore detailed explanations on\nmaintainability and serviceability.\n\n281\n00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:09.410\nSo we're thinking about what affects\nthe users on an ongoing basis.\n\n282\n00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.860\nIn other words, how often something\nbreaks or how long it's down for.\n\n283\n00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.660\nWhat's the scope?\n\n284\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.840\nWhat is the actual impact of it?\n\n285\n00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.010\nWhat would you rather have?\n\n286\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.300\nAnd this is a rhetorical\nquestion cuz there's no right or\n\n287\n00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.916\nwrong answer to this because\neverybody's got their own opinion.\n\n288\n00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:27.755\nWould you rather have your laptop\nfail ten times during the day but for\n\n289\n00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:31.511\njust one minute at a time,\nso you have to reboot it, or\n\n290\n00:15:31.511 --> 00:15:36.874\nwould you rather have it fail once during\nthe day but it be down for two hours?\n\n291\n00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:40.340\nThere's no right or wrong answer to that.\n\n292\n00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.750\nYou've got to work this\nout with your users, and\n\n293\n00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.760\nyour customers have got\nto agree this with you.\n\n294\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.625\nIt's got to be worked out as to what\nis acceptable for your business.\n\n295\n00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:53.352\nNow I don't think that either of\nthose is acceptable by the way.\n\n296\n00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:55.837\n[LAUGH] It's not a measure\nof good availability.\n\n297\n00:15:55.837 --> 00:15:58.269\nBut consider whether your.\n\n298\n00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:02.372\nTalking about duration of a down time,\nor frequency of down time,\n\n299\n00:16:02.372 --> 00:16:04.720\nwhat's more acceptable?\n\n300\n00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.190\nTo me personally,\nit's the ten times that's the frequency.\n\n301\n00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.950\nYou know?\nYou think it's up, and then it's not, and\n\n302\n00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.050\nyou think it's up, and then it's not.\n\n303\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.305\n&gt;&gt; Gotta love intermittent issues.\n\n304\n00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:16.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is what happens on a daily basis\n\n305\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.055\nwith my cell phone.\n\n306\n00:16:17.055 --> 00:16:19.990\n[LAUGH] I think I've got signal,\nthen I haven't,\n\n307\n00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.130\nand then I think I've got it and\nthen it's off again.\n\n308\n00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.650\nAnd also think about the scope\nof the impact as well.\n\n309\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.910\nIf this happening to absolutely everybody\nthen your entire organization is down,\n\n310\n00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.400\nand it's as simple as that.\n\n311\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.870\nSo as we've already talked about we're\ngoing to be doing unavailability analysis\n\n312\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:42.360\nin other words we're going to be\nanalyzing impact of unavailability on our\n\n313\n00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.460\nusers and on our business itself,\nbecause there's a cost to this.\n\n314\n00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.840\nSo we have to, and I've already\nmentioned this in a previous episode,\n\n315\n00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.890\nwe have to identify what our\nvital business functions are.\n\n316\n00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.380\nThe customer availability of email\nto us here is not that great.\n\n317\n00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.200\nWell, all right.\n\n318\n00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.400\nI say that now because\nthe customer availability to\n\n319\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.900\nemail if we lose it is not that great.\n\n320\n00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.910\nIf it's 10 minutes.\n\n321\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.420\nCost of unavailability if it's\ntwo days is going to be great.\n\n322\n00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:21.510\nAnd look at the tangible costs, the things\nthat we can actually touch and feel.\n\n323\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:26.820\nAnd it's that quality versus quantity\nthat make this easier to say.\n\n324\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.550\nAll right, let's forget qualitative.\n\n325\n00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.720\n&gt;&gt; It's easier to think about too,\nwhen you shorten it like that as well.\n\n326\n00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nlet's think about quality versus quantity.\n\n327\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.160\nAnd look at these intangible costs that\nwe've got here, including staff morale.\n\n328\n00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.140\nWell, you never think about that, do you?\n\n329\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.750\n&gt;&gt; What is my good mood worth, Jo?\n\n330\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.158\nCould we put a number on that?\n\n331\n00:17:47.158 --> 00:17:49.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not in terms of dollars, no.\n\n332\n00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.150\nYou know, that's a really\nimportant one because if you\n\n333\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:59.170\nhave got a 1,000 users\nthat are really unhappy,\n\n334\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.990\nthey're really paid off,\nthen how effective\n\n335\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:07.440\nare they gonna be in their job and how\nefficient are they gonna be at their job?\n\n336\n00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.180\nThey're not gonna be given 100%.\n\n337\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.310\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n338\n00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.530\nWhat if they even go on strike?\n\n339\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.550\nHow efficient will they be then?\n\n340\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.370\n&gt;&gt; That's definitely an extreme,\ncertainly.\n\n341\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:20.790\nBut yeah, it's really important\nthat we consider staff morale.\n\n342\n00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.920\nAnd I know that we\noverlook this quite often,\n\n343\n00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.910\nbut that's one tha we gotta factor in.\n\n344\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:30.840\nIf you go an global organization and\nthere is a period of constant or\n\n345\n00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.030\nfrequent disruption then\nthey're gonna be feed up.\n\n346\n00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.980\nHave you ever been a position\nwhere you turn on your laptop and\n\n347\n00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.465\nyou don't know whether is going to work?\n\n348\n00:18:39.465 --> 00:18:43.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know I mean I quite often I,\n\n349\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.540\nyou get to that point and we mention cell\nphones as a bit of a joke really, but\n\n350\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.630\nyou get to that point where you\npick up your cell phone and\n\n351\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.360\nyou go, does it have signal?\n\n352\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.150\nYes or no,\n\n353\n00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.610\nI don't expect it to have signal any\nmore so therefore I don't rely on it.\n\n354\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.420\nWell I'm going to be looking for\nalternative solutions.\n\n355\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.920\nAnd this is exactly what happens is that.\n\n356\n00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.995\n&gt;&gt; We'll see Jo with a pager.\n\n357\n00:19:05.995 --> 00:19:12.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Please [LAUGH] the sad thing\nis that I actually remember those.\n\n358\n00:19:12.605 --> 00:19:14.979\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You remember the pager codes.\n\n359\n00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.380\n&gt;&gt; No, to be perfectly honest,\nwhere I come from in the UK,\n\n360\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.857\npages were around in the 1980s and then\nthey died very, very quickly after that.\n\n361\n00:19:24.857 --> 00:19:27.800\n[CROSSTALK] It wasn't\nsomething that we even-\n\n362\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.257\n&gt;&gt; High digress.\n\n363\n00:19:29.257 --> 00:19:35.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's take a look at\none of our reactive techniques,\n\n364\n00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.830\nour reactive availability\nmanagement techniques.\n\n365\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.230\nWe call this the expanded or\nthe extended incident life cycle, okay.\n\n366\n00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.220\nAnd then this expanded or\n\n367\n00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.390\nextended incident life cycle\nwhat I want to take you through.\n\n368\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.676\nIs well, all of it really,\n[LAUGH] I guess.\n\n369\n00:19:49.676 --> 00:19:50.252\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\n\n370\n00:19:50.252 --> 00:19:55.130\nlet's start off here on our\nleft-hand side with our uptime.\n\n371\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.940\nSo let's assume that our service is up and\nrunning, and then something happens.\n\n372\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.270\nLook at this, we started an incident,\nwhoops there's been a failure So\n\n373\n00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.210\nnow the incident.\n\n374\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.850\nWell, there's been a failure.\n\n375\n00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.240\nThe service is down.\n\n376\n00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.320\nThe service is unavailable,\nas it says here on this dark purple line.\n\n377\n00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.810\nIt's unavailable.\n\n378\n00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.350\nThen we fix it.\n\n379\n00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.530\nSo it's back.\n\n380\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.390\nUp and restored to our users.\n\n381\n00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:21.270\nHere is our availability.\n\n382\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.600\nNo, it happens again.\n\n383\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.780\nI'm not going to go any further\nthan that for the moment.\n\n384\n00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.040\nWhat we're going to do here\nin availability management,\n\n385\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.480\nis we are going to recognize that there,\nwell, there's a problem.\n\n386\n00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.330\nWell, there is a problem.\n\n387\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.100\nIf every there's an incident,\nthere's always a problem.\n\n388\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.410\nAnd the problem is whatever caused it.\n\n389\n00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.070\nBut here, we're not interested\nin what the problem is.\n\n390\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:47.040\nWhat we're interested in is what\nwe did to try and restore service.\n\n391\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.390\nRemember, restoring\nservice is actually about\n\n392\n00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.620\ndelivering the service back to the user.\n\n393\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.680\nThis is not about fixing what went wrong.\n\n394\n00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.210\nNow, if you are confused about that,\n\n395\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:05.650\nI would recommend that you go to\nthe service operation, and show.\n\n396\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.910\nAnd take a look there is an episode in\nthere that is called incidence versus\n\n397\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:15.170\nproblems where we look at the difference\nbetween an incidence and a problem.\n\n398\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.990\nAnd an incidence is an interruption to\nservice, problem is what caused it.\n\n399\n00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.160\nAnd incidence management is just\nabout getting everything back up and\n\n400\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.030\nrunning and\nin fact it's about getting out the tape.\n\n401\n00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:29.320\nAs you'll see, if you were to look at that\nepisode, whereas problem management, well,\n\n402\n00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.110\nit is to stop the failure\nin the first place.\n\n403\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.360\nIn Availability Management, we're gonna\nlook at the incident, and we're going to\n\n404\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.940\nsay, okay, here in our incident then\nwe went through these five steps.\n\n405\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.890\nAnd the five steps were detection,\nin other words,\n\n406\n00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.120\nwe detected that something went wrong.\n\n407\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.820\nWe diagnosed it, we repaired it,\nwe recovered the data and\n\n408\n00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.990\nthen we restored the service to the user.\n\n409\n00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.780\nAnd what we want to do\nis we want to take this.\n\n410\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.300\nAnd we want to say, okay.\n\n411\n00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.390\nIn availability management I'm going to\nanalyze each of these five steps, detect,\n\n412\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.020\ndiagnose, repair, recover, restore.\n\n413\n00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:12.900\nAnd I'm going to see how I can\nshorten each of those steps so\n\n414\n00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.230\nthat next time it happens here in this box\nthat I didn't want to go into just yet.\n\n415\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.760\nThe next time it happens here you'll\nnotice that the unavailability\n\n416\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.460\nwas shorter.\n\n417\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.110\nAnd if the unavailability is shorter\nthen that means that the availability\n\n418\n00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.260\nis increased.\n\n419\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.370\n&gt;&gt; You're doing your job.\n\n420\n00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:35.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the meantime between\nfailures is actually better.\n\n421\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:40.620\nAnd this mean time to restore service,\nwhich is not mentioned here.\n\n422\n00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.450\nthis is the MTRS.\n\n423\n00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:47.500\nThen what I'm doing here is\nactually decreasing the MTRS.\n\n424\n00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.740\nSo let's look at these individually then.\n\n425\n00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.710\nLet's look at the detection.\n\n426\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.190\nWhat can we do to shorten that time.\n\n427\n00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.890\nWell the next time that incident occurs,\nI know that it's happened, so\n\n428\n00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.100\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put in\nautomatic measures to help me detect.\n\n429\n00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:09.030\nSo I might use availability management to\nhelp me detect an incident, for instance.\n\n430\n00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.480\n&gt;&gt; Or something that's really common,\nJo, would be like, malware.\n\n431\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.410\nOr like, if I have a antivirus protect,\nanti-malware protection.\n\n432\n00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And, because if you think about it,\n\n433\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.990\nwhat you're describing here happens so\noften when there's even just.\n\n434\n00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.850\nnot even just software based issues\nlike malware, but even hardware.\n\n435\n00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:26.930\nWhenever we have that failure.\n\n436\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.820\nAnd in that little first section there,\nwith your five steps,\n\n437\n00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.770\nthings that you could do,\nhaving hot spares,\n\n438\n00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:37.230\nor hot-swappable devices that we can\njust throw in in the event of, yes,\n\n439\n00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.360\nwell let me get with my terminology here,\nyou're gonna correct me on that, though.\n\n440\n00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.570\nWhat I mean, a box ready to go.\n\n441\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.830\nSo instead of me-\n&gt;&gt; Well hang on a minute,\n\n442\n00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.614\nwe're still in detection phase.\n\n443\n00:23:48.614 --> 00:23:49.214\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n444\n00:23:49.214 --> 00:23:50.501\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n445\n00:23:50.501 --> 00:23:51.245\n&gt;&gt; Solve the problem here, but.\n\n446\n00:23:51.245 --> 00:23:54.727\nWe'll let the antimalware\ngive you an alert first.\n\n447\n00:23:54.727 --> 00:23:55.457\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's event management.\n\n448\n00:23:55.457 --> 00:23:58.720\nEvent management is that monitoring.\n\n449\n00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.593\nAnd event management happens in absolutely\nevery single service that we have.\n\n450\n00:24:04.593 --> 00:24:08.041\nI mean we think of event management\nas just being managing our jobs and\n\n451\n00:24:08.041 --> 00:24:11.431\nmanaging our infrastructure\nInfrastructure, but actually event\n\n452\n00:24:11.431 --> 00:24:15.440\nmanagement is about monitoring and\nmanaging any event, any change of state.\n\n453\n00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:20.391\nSo that could happen in virus protection,\nin malware protection, in a firewall,\n\n454\n00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:23.320\nthat sort of event management as well.\n\n455\n00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.094\nSo that's the detection part.\n\n456\n00:24:25.094 --> 00:24:26.068\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n457\n00:24:26.068 --> 00:24:30.430\nNow we get into the well the diagnosis and\nyou know what?\n\n458\n00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:34.140\nSometimes we might choose exactly\nwhat you just mentioned there.\n\n459\n00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.002\nWe might elect to skip the diagnosis part.\n\n460\n00:24:37.002 --> 00:24:38.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n461\n00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.260\n&gt;&gt; So, we might just say, you know what,\nforget about the diagnosis.\n\n462\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.880\nWe're not interested in the diagnosis.\n\n463\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.960\nWhat we're going to do is we're\ngonna go straight to repair.\n\n464\n00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.100\nSo, we're going to go straight to,\nif we can just.\n\n465\n00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.008\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Jo needs\nto have her laptop up.\n\n466\n00:24:48.008 --> 00:24:50.707\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we're gonna go straight to,\n\n467\n00:24:50.707 --> 00:24:55.580\nif we look at this, we're going to go\nstraight to recovery of, well recovery of\n\n468\n00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.273\ndata and restoration, so that repair\nwould be right, give Jo a new laptop.\n\n469\n00:25:00.273 --> 00:25:01.890\nOkay, because she's\nshouting way too loudly.\n\n470\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Give her a new laptop that's\n\n471\n00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.040\nthe hot swappable bit, and\nthen we'll recover data,\n\n472\n00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.880\nwe'll restore from a previous backup.\n\n473\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.840\nOkay?\nAnd then we restore that to the user.\n\n474\n00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.190\nNow, this is quite important as well.\n\n475\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:20.577\nSo this restoration to the user,\nthis restoration of service to the user,\n\n476\n00:25:20.577 --> 00:25:24.520\nthe user has to confirm\nthe service has been restored.\n\n477\n00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.330\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n478\n00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:26.669\n&gt;&gt; This is a tricky one.\n\n479\n00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.837\nBecause in incident management,\n\n480\n00:25:29.837 --> 00:25:33.970\nit's very very typical that,\neverything's working now.\n\n481\n00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:34.700\nRight, okay.\n\n482\n00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.679\nWho's that on the phone?\n\n483\n00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:36.571\nIt's the service desk.\n\n484\n00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:39.390\nI don't need to talk to\nthem cuz it's working now.\n\n485\n00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.140\nAnd so\na user will ignore the service desk call.\n\n486\n00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.910\nAnd the service desk call is once,\nit's all right, I'm working now.\n\n487\n00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.430\nAnd then service desk call is again,\nit's okay, I'm working now.\n\n488\n00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.670\nBy rights that service desk\nshould keep on calling.\n\n489\n00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:53.690\nAnd keep on calling and\n\n490\n00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:58.120\nkeep on calling until the users confirmed\nthat the service is up and working.\n\n491\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:03.020\nProblem is that as a user, I'm listening\nin my voicemail and I'm just sitting here\n\n492\n00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.250\nthinking, I wish they'd stop calling me,\nleave me alone, everything's working.\n\n493\n00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.920\nBut then in the service desk\nthey're caught between a rock and\n\n494\n00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.290\na hard place, really.\n\n495\n00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:17.590\nBecause they don't want to close\nan incident in case it's not been fixed.\n\n496\n00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.070\nBut they don't want to have\nlots of incidents open and\n\n497\n00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.005\nthey don't want to keep pestering you.\n\n498\n00:26:22.005 --> 00:26:25.799\nSo what we would tell you is that it's\nperfectly acceptable to have what we call\n\n499\n00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:27.525\na three strikes and out rule.\n\n500\n00:26:27.525 --> 00:26:30.458\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was thinking, how many\ncauses do you have to have before?\n\n501\n00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:33.115\n&gt;&gt; Well, it has to be agreed in the SLA.\n\n502\n00:26:33.115 --> 00:26:33.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n503\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.160\n&gt;&gt; You don't just arbitrarily decide that\nyou're going to put in a three strikes and\n\n504\n00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.150\nyou're out rule.\n\n505\n00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nnot tell anybody about it, right?\n\n506\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.735\n&gt;&gt; But you know what?\n\n507\n00:26:41.735 --> 00:26:43.730\n[LAUGH] This is quite common.\n\n508\n00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.430\nThis is what a lot of organizations\ndo that implement a three\n\n509\n00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.240\nstrikes and out rule.\n\n510\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.690\nAnd then not even think about actually\ntelling the users that they're doing it.\n\n511\n00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.320\nAnd then the users call up the service\ndesk and say, why is my incident closed?\n\n512\n00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.110\nI never agreed to it.\n\n513\n00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:00.561\nSo again, this restoration of service\nwill think about maybe putting in a three\n\n514\n00:27:00.561 --> 00:27:04.270\nstrikes and out rule but\nwe'll agree that with the user.\n\n515\n00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:09.440\nSo we analyzed each step of an incident,\ndetection, diagnosis, repair\n\n516\n00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.570\nof the actual incident itself, recovery\nof any data, and restoration of service.\n\n517\n00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:20.170\nAnd we'll look to how we can\nshorten each particular step so\n\n518\n00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:24.600\nthat next time it happens,\nas we see here, that unavailability,\n\n519\n00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.920\nwell is actually shortened.\n\n520\n00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.900\nSo the mean time to restore service,\nwell that's shortened.\n\n521\n00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.660\nAnd the mean time between failures is,\ntherefore, extended.\n\n522\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.120\nSo that's just one of our\nreactive availability management\n\n523\n00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.050\nmethods that we use.\n\n524\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.030\nJust analyze in the expanded\nincident life cycle.\n\n525\n00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.580\nThat's it for this episode but\nwhen we come back in our next episode,\n\n526\n00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.820\nwe're actually going to be looking\nat service failure analysis.\n\n527\n00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.450\nSo looking at why services failed, and\n\n528\n00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.500\nit's not necessarily\njust about the technical.\n\n529\n00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.870\nWe've mentioned this in quite a few\nof our episodes up until now.\n\n530\n00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.790\nAnd we're gonna carry on with that theme.\n\n531\n00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:04.490\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you, Jo.\n\n532\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.920\nYou've explained a lot of information.\n\n533\n00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.740\nYou've also introduced those acronyms\nthat we can use to help really\n\n534\n00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.330\nefficiently analyze and help reduce\nthose downtimes and those service times,\n\n535\n00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:21.210\nthe MT,\nmean time between service incident, MTBSI.\n\n536\n00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.650\nThat's a long acronym, but you guys\nknow them now, so that's not an excuse.\n\n537\n00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.320\nI can't have an excuse either.\n\n538\n00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.730\nSo, thank you for\ntaking the time to share that with us Jo.\n\n539\n00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.670\nAnd thank you for\nspending your time with us as well.\n\n540\n00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.270\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign

00:00:08.406\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:12.115\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:14.550\nWelcome back to your\nITIL Intermediate Series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.450\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.080\nIn this episode, we'll continue taking\na look at availability management.\n\n8\n00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.620\nWe're up to part four, but that's great\nbecause we're gonna continue taking a look\n\n9\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.800\nat those reactive components and Jo\nPeacock is back in studio with us today.\n\n10\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.060\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.940\nIt's absolutely great, thank you Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you're here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.040\nYes, I'm great.\n\n14\n00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.270\nWe still haven't got our cookies yet,\nbut you know what,\n\n15\n00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.720\nI think that [LAUGH] we'll get there.\n\n16\n00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.501\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna have to get them ourselves.\n\n17\n00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:44.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's no wait staff here.\n\n18\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.690\nThat's what we're saying.\n\n19\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I miss the old days.\n\n20\n00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.540\nI'm just showing how old I am.\n\n21\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.480\nWhen people used to come\naround with the tea trolley.\n\n22\n00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.240\n&gt;&gt; A tea trolley.\n\n23\n00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.230\n&gt;&gt; A tea trolley, yeah.\n\n24\n00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.020\n&gt;&gt; I haven't experienced that.\n\n25\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you have to have your cup of\ntea first thing in the morning and\n\n26\n00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.620\nin the afternoon as well.\n\n27\n00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.890\nAlong with homemade cakes too.\n\n28\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.011\n&gt;&gt; I did have cake this morning.\n\n29\n00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:08.081\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On that note, [LAUGH]\n\n30\n00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:12.674\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Availability management.\n\n31\n00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:17.909\nRight, okay the cake was definitely\navailable for you then this morning.\n\n32\n00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:18.464\n&gt;&gt; It was.\n\n33\n00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:19.858\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Past tense.\n\n34\n00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:23.047\n&gt;&gt; It was yes, it's no longer available.\n\n35\n00:01:23.047 --> 00:01:27.231\nLet's take a look then at,\nwe continued in our series of reactive\n\n36\n00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:31.950\navailability management and in our\nlast episode we looked at the expanded\n\n37\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.993\nincident life cycle as one technique for\nreactive availability management.\n\n38\n00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:40.301\nIn other words what we are trying\nto do is in the real world,\n\n39\n00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:44.689\nin the production the live environment\nhowever you want to call it, we want to\n\n40\n00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.806\nensure that we maintain availability\nof our services and that we are able\n\n41\n00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:54.000\nto deliver those services to the agreed\ntargets in the service level agreement.\n\n42\n00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.310\nWell now we're gonna take\na look at another technique.\n\n43\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.490\nAnd another technique that we will use for\nreactive availability management\n\n44\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.849\nis looking at what we call\nthe service failure analysis.\n\n45\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.780\nReactive availability management is all\nabout analyzing where something has gone\n\n46\n00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.090\nwrong and then trying to prevent\nit from happening in the future.\n\n47\n00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.870\nVery, very similar in It's outlook\nto proactive problem management.\n\n48\n00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.810\nAnd if you want to learn more proactive\nproblem management then take a look\n\n49\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.400\nat the service operation.\n\n50\n00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.020\nAnd our service operation show.\n\n51\n00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.550\nThere are a couple of episodes\nthere about problem management.\n\n52\n00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.700\nAnd take a look at proactive\nproblem management and\n\n53\n00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.140\nyou will see very,\nvery similar techniques and used there.\n\n54\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.020\nAs what we do with reactive\navailability management.\n\n55\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.260\nWe are performing trend analysis along\nwith problem management on our incidents\n\n56\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.900\nand we're looking at incidents in greater\ndepth to find out why something failed.\n\n57\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.881\nSo let's take a look at, we've got\na service failure analysis diagram there.\n\n58\n00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:03.220\nAnd you will have this available to\nyou in your downloadable material.\n\n59\n00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.080\nSo please don't and be to put off about\nthe actual scale of that diagram.\n\n60\n00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.670\nBecause it looks very very small\non the screen in front of you.\n\n61\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.020\nBut take a look at the steps.\n\n62\n00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.000\nWe call this a structured approach.\n\n63\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.320\nAnd what we will do is we\nselect an opportunity.\n\n64\n00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.030\nIn other words,\nwe will select the incident itself and\n\n65\n00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.260\nthen we will scope the assignment.\n\n66\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.920\nIn other words, we will decide what we're\ngoing to do in analyzing that incident and\n\n67\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.450\nthen we plan for this.\n\n68\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.480\nAnd then we build hypotheses.\n\n69\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.530\nThen we analyze the data.\n\n70\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.460\nWe might interview personnel.\n\n71\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.820\nThen we come up with our findings and\n\n72\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.500\nwe make recommendations which we obviously\nreport and then they are validated.\n\n73\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.950\nIn other words this is\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n74\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.737\nService failure analysis, I will put my\nteeth in in a moment I promise you this.\n\n75\n00:03:54.737 --> 00:03:57.307\n[LAUGH] It's a structured\napproach as we saying and\n\n76\n00:03:57.307 --> 00:04:01.410\nit's done with problem management in\nconjunction with problem management.\n\n77\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.780\nBut the thing that I really want\nto point out is that on the bottom\n\n78\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.990\nbullet point there,\nthat goes beyond the technical.\n\n79\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.100\nYou know what,\nif you hadn't guessed it right now,\n\n80\n00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.989\nright in the middle of that diagram\non the left-hand side it talks\n\n81\n00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.827\nabout interviewing personnel,\ninterviewing key personnel.\n\n82\n00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:23.040\nIn other words, it's not just\nabout analyzing event management,\n\n83\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.712\nit's not just about looking at\nthe technical details of what went wrong,\n\n84\n00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:34.320\nbut it's also about understanding\nwhere people fit in to this.\n\n85\n00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.820\nWe ask questions like,\nwere the service desks available?\n\n86\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.000\nIf they weren't available,\nwhy weren't they available?\n\n87\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.180\nOr were the service desks\nsimply understaffed?\n\n88\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.300\nWere the service desks too busy\ndealing with other things?\n\n89\n00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.210\nOr maybe they didn't consider\nthis particular service\n\n90\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.780\nto be a vital business function.\n\n91\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.230\nSo all of these happens as\nwe interview personnel.\n\n92\n00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.510\nThis is not just about looking at\nthe technical aspects as to why\n\n93\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.540\nour service wasn't restored quick enough.\n\n94\n00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.210\nThis is also about looking\nat the other aspect.\n\n95\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.540\nAs I've already mentioned, if something\nhasn't been identified as a vital business\n\n96\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.450\nfunction then that service is not going to\nbe given a priority for instance, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.645\nSo let's look look at what we do\nin each particular step, though.\n\n98\n00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:24.665\nIt's a structured approach.\n\n99\n00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:29.755\nThis is not an approach that we\nwill just do at an ad hoc basis.\n\n100\n00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.445\nIt has to be structured and\nit has to be documented.\n\n101\n00:05:33.545 --> 00:05:36.645\nIn one of our previous episode,\nI showed you this wonderful diagram.\n\n102\n00:05:36.645 --> 00:05:38.575\nI said to you, I love this diagram.\n\n103\n00:05:38.575 --> 00:05:40.780\nIt's in the beginning of\na lot of our episodes,\n\n104\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.668\nit's at the end of a lot of our episodes.\n\n105\n00:05:42.668 --> 00:05:45.318\nAnd if you can remember\nthat particular diagram,\n\n106\n00:05:45.318 --> 00:05:49.103\nyou'll remember that in the right-hand\nside of that diagram we had our\n\n107\n00:05:49.103 --> 00:05:51.710\navailability management\ninformation system.\n\n108\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.093\nAnd then that availability\nmanagement information system,\n\n109\n00:05:55.093 --> 00:05:59.383\nI've said to you in these episodes that\nthis is where we store all of reports and\n\n110\n00:05:59.383 --> 00:06:03.819\nall of our valuations and evaluations,\nhave all of our risk management as well.\n\n111\n00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.423\nWell, here's one technique\nwhere the results of this, and\n\n112\n00:06:07.423 --> 00:06:10.462\nall of the aspects that\ncontribute to this, well,\n\n113\n00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:15.970\nall of that's stored in our availability\nmanagement information system.\n\n114\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.610\nSo the first thing that we need to do is\nit says here, select the opportunity.\n\n115\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.620\nAnd select the opportunity\nmeans identify which service,\n\n116\n00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.795\nwhich failure is going to be analyzed.\n\n117\n00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:31.410\nOne we might do with the service failure\nanalysis is we might select say,\n\n118\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.950\none service or two services every single\nyear or maybe even more than that.\n\n119\n00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.340\nAnd say we're going to analyze\nall the failures on this\n\n120\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.610\nparticular service,\ntwice a year for instance.\n\n121\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.790\nSo as part of selecting the opportunity\n\n122\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.680\nwe're also going to scope\nthe assignment as well.\n\n123\n00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.290\nAnd what that means really,\nreally simply is what's excluded and\n\n124\n00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.460\nwhat's included in our\nservice failure analysis.\n\n125\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.236\nSo we might decide that we're going to\nanalyze any failures to our email service\n\n126\n00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:09.950\ntwice a year and\nwe're going to do a full analysis and\n\n127\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.780\nthat full analysis means\nevery single component.\n\n128\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.460\nBear in mind you know\nsome of the influences\n\n129\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.830\non any interruptions to service,\nwell they could come from other services.\n\n130\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.519\nIt could be just an outage caused\nby the failure in another service.\n\n131\n00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.187\nSo the scope, because it says\nin the bottom bullet point,\n\n132\n00:07:30.187 --> 00:07:34.704\nthat defines explicitly what's\nincluded and what's excluded.\n\n133\n00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:38.842\nSo we first off decide what\nservice we're going to analyze or\n\n134\n00:07:38.842 --> 00:07:44.640\nwhich component, because we look at\nthe components themselves, as well.\n\n135\n00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.542\nAnd then we will scope exactly\nwhat it is we're going to do.\n\n136\n00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:54.192\nFor the most part a service failure\nanalysis looks out very much at the high\n\n137\n00:07:54.192 --> 00:07:55.250\nlevel service.\n\n138\n00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.335\nIt's looking at the failure of a service,\nnot just as a component.\n\n139\n00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:03.720\nHowever, this can be done at a component\nlevel as I've already mentioned.\n\n140\n00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.868\nSo then what we will do is we will, and\nbelieve it or not that slide has just\n\n141\n00:08:07.868 --> 00:08:11.610\nchanged [LAUGH], even though it\nmight not have appeared that way.\n\n142\n00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.960\nWe'll plan that assignment, okay.\n\n143\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.270\nSo we've already scoped it.\n\n144\n00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.480\nWe've decided what's included and\nwhat's excluded.\n\n145\n00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.980\nSo now we're going to plan it.\n\n146\n00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:28.190\nAnd we're going to plan exactly how we're\ngoing to conduct this end-to-end analysis.\n\n147\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.912\nEnd-to-end means absolutely everything.\n\n148\n00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:35.473\nEnd-to-end means all\nthe technical components.\n\n149\n00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:38.655\nPlus it means all of\nthe process components, too.\n\n150\n00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:41.940\nSo it may be that in\nany particular failure,\n\n151\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.600\nit might not be that the failure\nlay with a technical component.\n\n152\n00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.670\nBut the failure to restore service\nmay have actually lain with\n\n153\n00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.540\nincorrect service level targets\nbeing agreed in an OLA.\n\n154\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.284\n&gt;&gt; So\nway before that start of the incident.\n\n155\n00:08:57.284 --> 00:09:00.883\n&gt;&gt; Not before the start of the incident,\nbut during the incident, itself.\n\n156\n00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:03.286\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo there might have been a process that\n\n157\n00:09:03.286 --> 00:09:08.510\nhas caused the incident to be outstanding\nfor ten hours instead of two hours.\n\n158\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.111\nIn a previous episode, we used\nthe example where I took an incident and\n\n159\n00:09:12.111 --> 00:09:13.340\nthen I passed it to you.\n\n160\n00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.121\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd we had an unsupporting service level\n\n161\n00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:18.870\ntarget as opposed to a supporting one.\n\n162\n00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.100\n&gt;&gt; Just looping it around to\ndifferent departments, escalating?\n\n163\n00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.680\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so when we perform\nfunctional escalation, and we move\n\n164\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.140\nan incident around, or tennis, as we like\nto call it between all of the different\n\n165\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.240\nsupport teams, that might actually\nexacerbate the failure of an incident,\n\n166\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.390\nor exacerbate the mean time to\nrestore service of any incident.\n\n167\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.820\nSo that's something that would come\nup in a service failure analysis.\n\n168\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n169\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.484\n&gt;&gt; So we're not just looking\nat the technical aspects.\n\n170\n00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:49.056\nAlthough the, We're in IT,\nand you know what?\n\n171\n00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:51.417\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's hard not to be technical.\n\n172\n00:09:51.417 --> 00:09:55.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but the problem is is\nthat we try and be too technical.\n\n173\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.058\nAnd that's the problem that we have\nwithin IT is that we're here in IT, and\n\n174\n00:09:59.058 --> 00:10:01.009\nwe like to analyze technical things.\n\n175\n00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:03.970\nAnd to be perfectly honest,\nthey're easier to analyze.\n\n176\n00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.240\nYou know what, you get the truth\nout of a technical component.\n\n177\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n178\n00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.450\nit's always going to tell you\nexactly what happened and\n\n179\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.660\nexactly what time it happened.\n\n180\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.524\nNow, you come and ask me what happened\nat 10:03 AM yesterday morning,\n\n181\n00:10:17.524 --> 00:10:21.248\nand I'm gonna sort of hem and\nhaw a bit, scratch my head and\n\n182\n00:10:21.248 --> 00:10:24.215\nthen think about this for\na little bit longer.\n\n183\n00:10:24.215 --> 00:10:26.440\nAnd then I'm gonna give\nyou half an answer.\n\n184\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.513\nAnd then in about 10 minutes time, I'm\ngonna give you another third of an answer.\n\n185\n00:10:31.513 --> 00:10:36.174\nAnd I'm never gonna give you a complete\nanswer because I didn't write it all down.\n\n186\n00:10:36.174 --> 00:10:37.550\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n187\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.710\n&gt;&gt; But you see sometimes it's that aspect\nthat's actually either exacerbated\n\n188\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.780\nthe failure or even caused the failure.\n\n189\n00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.850\nSo we have to analyze everything.\n\n190\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:50.260\nAnd we do tend to think about analyzing\njust the technical because it's\n\n191\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.210\nthe technical that, as I said,\nwill tell us the truth.\n\n192\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:58.266\nWe don't often get complete answers\nwhen we talk to people, for instance.\n\n193\n00:10:58.266 --> 00:11:00.506\nAnd that's no failure of any person,\n\n194\n00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:04.854\njust the simple fact that we don't all\nwrite everything down that we did.\n\n195\n00:11:04.854 --> 00:11:11.711\nI remember, a few years ago, when we\nhad this new, now what did we call it?\n\n196\n00:11:11.711 --> 00:11:12.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Was it Google Glass,\n\n197\n00:11:12.744 --> 00:11:15.162\nisn't that what it was called,\nthese wonderful new-\n\n198\n00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:15.880\n&gt;&gt; The glasses?\n\n199\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nthe glasses that would come out.\n\n200\n00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.990\nAnd we all had these wonderful ideas\nthat we was gonna record absolutely\n\n201\n00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.188\neverything that we did so that we could\nplay back our life and everything.\n\n202\n00:11:25.188 --> 00:11:26.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It sounds-\n\n203\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.510\n&gt;&gt; Not creepy at all.\n\n204\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.330\n&gt;&gt; No, right, I mean it sounds like\nsomething out of a Hollywood movie.\n\n205\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.415\nAnd the reality of the situation\nis that it probably was\n\n206\n00:11:33.415 --> 00:11:36.433\nsomething out of a Hollywood\nmovie because, I mean,\n\n207\n00:11:36.433 --> 00:11:39.667\nhow many times would you forget\nto take your glasses off?\n\n208\n00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:42.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Jo.\n\n209\n00:11:42.582 --> 00:11:46.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\nit's just not worth thinking about.\n\n210\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.780\nBut we don't have the ability to remember,\nor some people do.\n\n211\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.830\nBut we don't have the ability to\nremember absolutely everything.\n\n212\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.165\nAnd we don't write it all down either.\n\n213\n00:11:58.165 --> 00:12:01.300\nAnd so for that reason,\n\n214\n00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.830\nwe in IT tend to think about the nuts and\nbolts, the evidence that's in front of us.\n\n215\n00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.170\nAnd a service failure impact\nanalysis just looks at this and\n\n216\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.290\nsays you've got to think about\nthe nontechnical aspects, as well.\n\n217\n00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.800\nEven, and in that middle bullet point,\nif we can bring that slide back up.\n\n218\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.080\nEven where it says,\nwe think about our suppliers, as well.\n\n219\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.970\nBecause our suppliers could also\nbe maybe the cause of failure, or\n\n220\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.970\nthey may have exacerbated how long\na failure was outstanding for.\n\n221\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:38.240\nAnd they can help us not only\nto identify what a failure,\n\n222\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.970\nor the cause of a failure and\nthe length or duration of a failure,\n\n223\n00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.620\nbut they can also help us\nbuild these hypotheses.\n\n224\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.250\nTake a look at these hypotheses.\n\n225\n00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.640\nThese are just scenarios that we can test\nthat we can say, maybe it was this and\n\n226\n00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.600\nmaybe it was that.\n\n227\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.674\nAnd as I've already said the maybe, well,\n\n228\n00:12:55.674 --> 00:13:00.837\nit could be absolutely anything,\nand it's not necessarily technical.\n\n229\n00:13:00.837 --> 00:13:03.447\nSo we'll get our suppliers\nto help us with this.\n\n230\n00:13:03.447 --> 00:13:07.007\nMaybe it was caused by this,\nmaybe it was caused by that.\n\n231\n00:13:07.007 --> 00:13:11.980\nSometimes the cause of any failure,\nwell, it's beyond our control.\n\n232\n00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.740\nFlooding, fire, all of those sort of\nthings, the things that we look at in risk\n\n233\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.390\nmanagement, the things that we look\nat in service continuity management,\n\n234\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.290\nall of those sort of things,\nthey can be the cause of a fire.\n\n235\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.820\nAnd then we need to consider what we're\ngoing to do about that in the future.\n\n236\n00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:30.250\nAnd we will consider that in conjunction\nwith service continuity management.\n\n237\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.564\nHypotheses, as it says in that\nbottom bullet point there,\n\n238\n00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:39.440\nthese are likely scenarios\nthat can be tested.\n\n239\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.830\nI am not telling you to go out and start\nfires, by the way, all right [LAUGH].\n\n240\n00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.258\nJust I wanna add that one in there\nbecause, I mean, I say to you, well,\n\n241\n00:13:47.258 --> 00:13:50.020\nit could be caused by a fire or\nit could be caused by flood.\n\n242\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.670\nAnd please don't go out there into your\nserver room with a bucket of water.\n\n243\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.740\nThe only place that that's going to\nlead to is out of the door [LAUGH].\n\n244\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n245\n00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we don't wanna do that,\nbut we can still hypothesize about it.\n\n246\n00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.440\nWe can still say,\nperhaps it was caused by too much water.\n\n247\n00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.240\nWe don't need to recreate that again.\n\n248\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.160\nSo we've taken all\nthe data that's shown us,\n\n249\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.190\nwell, where our failure occurred and\nwhere our failures were.\n\n250\n00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.570\nBearing in mind that we\nare analyzing a complete service.\n\n251\n00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.130\nAnd then we're going to\nassign the data for analysis.\n\n252\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.892\nThe person that's performing availability\nmanagement in this particular case,\n\n253\n00:14:33.892 --> 00:14:38.781\nwell, you can't assume that they\nunderstand all of the technical details\n\n254\n00:14:38.781 --> 00:14:40.890\nabout every single component.\n\n255\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.371\nBecause they don't.\n\n256\n00:14:42.371 --> 00:14:44.723\nI mean, let's take a look at me, okay.\n\n257\n00:14:44.723 --> 00:14:49.040\nI did, way back in the dim and\ndistant past,\n\n258\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.190\nI was CNE certified,\na Certified Novell Engineer.\n\n259\n00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.540\nAll right, now do I know\nanything about Cisco networks?\n\n260\n00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.490\nAbsolutely not.\n\n261\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.360\nAll right, I can probably help out\na little bit with networks, okay.\n\n262\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.540\nI understand some of the terminology and\nsome of the acronyms.\n\n263\n00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.230\nDoes that mean I know\nanything about things in?\n\n264\n00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.529\nIt's the 21st century now and\nI'm ancient [LAUGH].\n\n265\n00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:14.948\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Stop it.\n\n266\n00:15:14.948 --> 00:15:15.592\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:15:15.592 --> 00:15:19.320\nI'm not the best person for\nthat particular role.\n\n268\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.180\nAnd so this comes back to ITIL and\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n\n269\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.780\nAnd the fact that you've gotta accept and\nstop being stubborn.\n\n270\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.690\nAnd we've gotta accept sometimes that we\nare not the best person for the role.\n\n271\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.641\nAnd, therefore, we'll get somebody\nelse to analyze data for us.\n\n272\n00:15:35.641 --> 00:15:38.739\nIf you're going to analyze\ndata on your infrastructure,\n\n273\n00:15:38.739 --> 00:15:42.414\nI want somebody with the right\nqualifications to analyze that data.\n\n274\n00:15:42.414 --> 00:15:45.210\nCuz I can look at it and go,\nyeah, look, that's a failure.\n\n275\n00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.320\nAnd that's about as good as\nyou're gonna get from me.\n\n276\n00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.057\nSo how can I prevent that from happening\nin the future if I don't even know\n\n277\n00:15:52.057 --> 00:15:56.107\nwhat's caused it,\nlet alone how to prevent it in the future?\n\n278\n00:15:56.107 --> 00:15:58.451\nSo then think about who\nour people are as well.\n\n279\n00:15:58.451 --> 00:16:02.321\nAnd when it comes to looking at\nthe service failure analysis team, or who\n\n280\n00:16:02.321 --> 00:16:07.090\nwe're going to give the analysis to, yeah,\nmake sure that we've got the right people.\n\n281\n00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.570\nAnd that's part of the key personnel.\n\n282\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.370\nBut make sure we've got the right\npeople analyzing the data.\n\n283\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:17.840\nBut also, this particular step is about\ngoing out and finding out what happened.\n\n284\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.510\nThis is where you go and talk to me.\n\n285\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.570\nAnd you say, what were you doing\nat 10:30 yesterday morning?\n\n286\n00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:25.160\nDo not.\n\n287\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.137\nYou are not a policeman, or\npolicewoman for that matter.\n\n288\n00:16:29.137 --> 00:16:31.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are not in the FBI or\n\n289\n00:16:31.025 --> 00:16:33.592\nany other criminal investigation bureau.\n\n290\n00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:37.276\nSo there's no need to get people into\na darkened room with a spotlight\n\n291\n00:16:37.276 --> 00:16:38.111\nagainst them.\n\n292\n00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:42.190\n[LAUGH] And\nstart writing down names and numbers.\n\n293\n00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.520\nAll right, no, we don't need to do that.\n\n294\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.920\nBut we do need to find out exactly\nwhat went on in certain situations.\n\n295\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.950\nAnd I really wanna make\na valid point about this.\n\n296\n00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.570\nAnd this is one of\nthe reasons why we don't\n\n297\n00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.510\noften get cooperation from people in IT.\n\n298\n00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.040\nAnd this is actually really serious, it\nthat this is not about apportioning blame.\n\n299\n00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.310\nAnd yet, so many times I've\nseen problem management, and\n\n300\n00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.530\nI've seen service failure\nanalysis used as a leverage,\n\n301\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:19.160\nused as a method for\nconducting what we'd call a post-mortem or\n\n302\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.890\nan autopsy just to find out what\nwent wrong and then point fingers.\n\n303\n00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.567\nIt's not about that,and people\nhave a ration,about being open if\n\n304\n00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:31.024\nthey feel that they're\ngonna be repercussions.\n\n305\n00:17:31.024 --> 00:17:34.690\nAnd this is about preventing\nfailure in the future,\n\n306\n00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.200\nthis is not about pushing blame,.\n\n307\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:43.490\nAnd I think that that's something that\nI call a stress enough about service\n\n308\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:49.260\nfailure analysis, this is really just\nabout try to prevent this ion the future.\n\n309\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.120\nSo, interviews should involve,\nsort of like quick win opportunities,\n\n310\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.320\nabout where do you think we went wrong,\n\n311\n00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.880\nwhat do you think we can do for\nnext time, to prevent it happen again.\n\n312\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.300\nAnd you want to pick out\nsort of ok individuals.\n\n313\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.330\nYou might also want to\npick out customers and\n\n314\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.940\nusers as well,\nbecause they may have a part in it.\n\n315\n00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.330\nThey'll certainly have a part\nin identifying the scope or\n\n316\n00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.500\nthe impact of any particular failure.\n\n317\n00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:19.110\nAnd then after the analysis, well,\nthen we need to document our findings and\n\n318\n00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:24.590\ndocument our conclusions, and\nexactly what it was went wrong.\n\n319\n00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.160\nIt's okay to use the words, we think.\n\n320\n00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.340\nAs long as you've got\nthe evidence to back it up.\n\n321\n00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.560\nWe think it was this, and\n\n322\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.000\nthis is the reason why we've drawn this\nconclusion, and here's our evidence.\n\n323\n00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.172\nAnd it's okay to use those words, as\nlong as, I say, you've got the evidence.\n\n324\n00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:46.260\n&gt;&gt; And Jo,\nyou mentioned earlier about being open and\n\n325\n00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.830\nbeing transparent with them.\n\n326\n00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:52.050\nAnd so let's say you wanted\nto run some kind of network\n\n327\n00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.700\nmonitoring utility to verify and\nprovide those facts for you.\n\n328\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.870\nSo as long as someone doesn't feel hurt or\n\n329\n00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.421\nbetrayed that you\nare running those utilities.\n\n330\n00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:03.709\nYou've already predefined that and\nsay, hey look,\n\n331\n00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:07.530\nthere is a correlation between x and\ny and this is y.\n\n332\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:11.010\nYes, this is not, as I said,\nabout apportioning blame,\n\n333\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:16.240\nit's about identifying the ways to\nimprove our service availability.\n\n334\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.290\nAnd if we can be assured,\nas just regular people.\n\n335\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.650\nIf we can be assured\nthat whatever we say and\n\n336\n00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.575\nwhatever evidence that we give is\nactually gonna be used in the right way,\n\n337\n00:19:27.575 --> 00:19:31.320\nthen we're likely to be open and\nwe're likely to be transparent about it.\n\n338\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.880\nPeople become very protected,\nthey become very self protected\n\n339\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.490\nif they feel threatened and\nthat's just a natural instinct.\n\n340\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.450\nSo we wanna make sure that\nwe're doing this to improve.\n\n341\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.240\nWe're not doing this to point fingers and\napportion blame.\n\n342\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.750\nThat's not what we're doing.\n\n343\n00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:49.478\nAnd our recommendations are always\ngoing to be based on fact.\n\n344\n00:19:49.478 --> 00:19:54.678\nWe recommend that the failure was,\nbecause, and in fact we had a huge\n\n345\n00:19:54.678 --> 00:20:00.510\nfailure last week and it was because\na virus came into our organization.\n\n346\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.480\nAnd because Jo opened\nthat particular email.\n\n347\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.099\nAnd she shouldn't have done-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] those sites, Jo.\n\n348\n00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:06.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, right.\n\n349\n00:20:06.932 --> 00:20:10.378\nYeah, Jo opened his email and\nshe was an idiot, all right.\n\n350\n00:20:10.378 --> 00:20:12.061\n[LAUGH] It had an attachment on it and\n\n351\n00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:14.624\nI thought that it looked\nlike a nice pretty picture.\n\n352\n00:20:14.624 --> 00:20:19.080\nOr what was it Cherokee was\nsaying in a previous episode?\n\n353\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.095\nPeople declaring undying love to me.\n\n354\n00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:22.168\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Happens all the time.\n\n355\n00:20:22.168 --> 00:20:27.594\n[LAUGH] I open the email, and\nhey, look, I've got a virus.\n\n356\n00:20:28.605 --> 00:20:33.123\nService failure analysis is not about\napportioning fingers and saying, okay Jo,\n\n357\n00:20:33.123 --> 00:20:34.423\nit's time to go, bye.\n\n358\n00:20:34.423 --> 00:20:35.748\nThis is about saying, okay,\n\n359\n00:20:35.748 --> 00:20:38.985\nwe've got to make sure that we put\nin the appropriate virus protection.\n\n360\n00:20:38.985 --> 00:20:41.725\n&gt;&gt; Provide that in user training for Jo.\n\n361\n00:20:41.725 --> 00:20:46.455\n&gt;&gt; Maybe yeah, maybe I need training or\nmaybe perhaps stop it at source.\n\n362\n00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:47.285\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n363\n00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.130\n&gt;&gt; And put it in the firewall.\n\n364\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:54.047\nPerhaps if we had upgraded our virus\ndetection when we were advised to do so\n\n365\n00:20:54.047 --> 00:20:58.586\nby our supplier, then Jo wouldn't\nhave got us in to this position.\n\n366\n00:20:58.586 --> 00:20:59.168\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n367\n00:20:59.168 --> 00:21:02.305\n&gt;&gt; But because we decided to\nput it off for an extra week,\n\n368\n00:21:02.305 --> 00:21:05.590\nbecause now wasn't a convenient time.\n\n369\n00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.920\nAnd that's our recommendation.\n\n370\n00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.749\nOur recommendation in that instance for\nthe future would be, when we get an email\n\n371\n00:21:10.749 --> 00:21:14.653\nfrom the suppliers telling us we need to\nupgrade virus protection, let's do it.\n\n372\n00:21:14.653 --> 00:21:17.943\n[LAUGH] And\nthat could be something simple like that,\n\n373\n00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:21.622\nthat's what we're looking for\nin our recommendations.\n\n374\n00:21:21.622 --> 00:21:27.200\nAnd so the final report is what\nwe then present to our sponsors.\n\n375\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.170\nA sponsor is somebody who is\na guiding stakeholder, so\n\n376\n00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:35.220\nsomebody like a service owner or\nmaybe even the customer, etc.\n\n377\n00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.130\nBecause what we need to show\nthat there has been a loss or\n\n378\n00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.180\nthat we need to show the impact\nof a particular failure.\n\n379\n00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.260\nThen that sponsor's gonna be\nsomebody who's interested\n\n380\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:49.710\nIn what that failure was and what the\nimpact was and therefore is going to be\n\n381\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.970\neager to do something about it and\nto prevent it happening again.\n\n382\n00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.830\nAnd that validation is\nreally just a comparison,\n\n383\n00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:02.170\nas we've said, from the actual FSA itself,\n\n384\n00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.880\nthat Service Failure Analysis,\nagainst our initial perspectives.\n\n385\n00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.752\nSo you know what, before we did\nthis Service Failure Analysis,\n\n386\n00:22:09.752 --> 00:22:11.410\nit looked like John was the culprit.\n\n387\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.936\nIt looked like I was the one that opened\nthe email with the attachment, and\n\n388\n00:22:15.936 --> 00:22:19.660\nI was the reason why we lost our\ninfrastructure for two days.\n\n389\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:25.006\nWhen in fact, the reason why we lost our\ninfrastructure for two days was because we\n\n390\n00:22:25.006 --> 00:22:31.020\nignored data email from our supplier that\nsaid update our virus protection service.\n\n391\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.450\nSo why do we do then the service failure\nanalyses, as I've already said it's\n\n392\n00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.890\nnot about pointing fingers, and\nit's not about apportioning blame.\n\n393\n00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:42.183\nIt's just about identifying,\nwell that's proactive problem management,\n\n394\n00:22:42.183 --> 00:22:45.176\nit's about identifying why\nSomething happened, and\n\n395\n00:22:45.176 --> 00:22:49.874\nto detail recommendations about what we'd\ndo to prevent it happening in the future.\n\n396\n00:22:49.874 --> 00:22:53.520\nWhat we want to do is\nenhance availability.\n\n397\n00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.701\nWe wanna make sure that our services\nare available and we want to.\n\n398\n00:22:56.701 --> 00:23:00.583\nIt says demonstrate a visible\ncommitment to improve, but\n\n399\n00:23:00.583 --> 00:23:04.320\nwe wanna really prevent\nany impact in the future.\n\n400\n00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.810\nThat's what we want to do.\n\n401\n00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:11.200\nIt's part of a health check of our\nprocesses and also our services as well.\n\n402\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.430\nWe want to prevent it happening again.\n\n403\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.800\nSo many times there are failures.\n\n404\n00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.950\nAnd we address what's failed.\n\n405\n00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.130\nAnd then we never go back to analyze\nhow we can prevent it happening\n\n406\n00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.850\nagain in the future.\n\n407\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.700\nSo, we know that we got\na virus on our network.\n\n408\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.390\nAnd we got a virus on the network\nbecause I opened an attachment that I\n\n409\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.450\nshouldn't have done.\n\n410\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.390\nSo we know what caused the failure, okay?\n\n411\n00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.620\nAnd what caused the failure\non the network was me.\n\n412\n00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.910\nI was opening up attachments.\n\n413\n00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:39.620\nBut actually,\n\n414\n00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:45.010\nthe real root cause of this was because\nwe fail to update our virus protection.\n\n415\n00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.090\nAnd this is what service\nfailure analysis does.\n\n416\n00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.460\nYou see,\nproblem management ill just identify me\n\n417\n00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.410\nas being the root cause of that incident.\n\n418\n00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.950\nProblem management will say, Joe was\nthe one that caused this because Joe\n\n419\n00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:02.410\nopened up the e-mail, and\nthat e-mail had an attachment in it.\n\n420\n00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.600\nWhereas Service Failure Analysis goes\none level further and says okay, and\n\n421\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.000\nhow was you able to do that?\n\n422\n00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.330\nSo Service Failure Analysis is\nactually just as beneficial,\n\n423\n00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.650\nif not more beneficial.\n\n424\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.620\nProblem management addresses\nthe root cause and says okay,\n\n425\n00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.750\nlet's fix the root cause.\n\n426\n00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:27.060\nLet's find out why something went wrong\nand let's Fix that whereas availability\n\n427\n00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.558\nmanagement says, okay, let's prevent the\nroot cause from happening in the future.\n\n428\n00:24:32.558 --> 00:24:38.810\nSo Service Failure Analysis,\nwell, what I want you to do now\n\n429\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:44.840\nis I want you to go back over this\nparticular session and I would like you\n\n430\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:51.090\nto refer to your Downloadable material,\nand in your downloadable material you\n\n431\n00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:56.670\nhave a exercise on service value\nanalysis in relation to that case study.\n\n432\n00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.760\nWhat I'd like you to do is I would like\nyou to spend at this point in time before\n\n433\n00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.530\nwe move further into proactive activities\navailability management in our next\n\n434\n00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.640\nepisode I'd like you to spend about\nan hour looking at your case study and\n\n435\n00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.700\nthen undertaking that exercise\non service value analysis.\n\n436\n00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.150\nNow, as I say at the end\nof every single episode,\n\n437\n00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:22.020\ncertainly where I've asked you to go\naway and look a something again or\n\n438\n00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.700\nperhaps perform an exercise,\nthen we're available on our forum.\n\n439\n00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.040\nSo please feel free to chat to us,\n\n440\n00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.930\nhighlight any concerns that you may

00:25:38.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you for your time, Jo.\n\n443\n00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:42.510\nThank you for explaining those\ndifferent types of reactive\n\n444\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.600\nsteps that we need to take.\n\n445\n00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.420\nEspecially when we're\ngoing to dive deep and\n\n446\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.140\nperform the particular service\nfailure analysis there.\n\n447\n00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.230\nSo, thank you, and\nthank you for joining us.\n\n448\n00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.302\nBut for this show,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n449\n00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:55.023\nRemember, I've been your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n450\n00:25:55.023 --> 00:25:55.805\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n451\n00:25:55.805 -->

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We also\ngotta work out exactly what the components\n\n36\n00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:34.560\nof each service are and what the shared\ncomponents of each service are.\n\n37\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.220\nCuz as we've explored in many episodes and\n\n38\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.550\nin many of our lifecycle shows,\nour components are shared.\n\n39\n00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.530\nThey're not just unique to\neach individual service.\n\n40\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.656\nSo first of all, we have to understand\nwhat services we've got to plan for,\n\n41\n00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:51.783\nincluding our new services, the ones\nthat are currently being developed,\n\n42\n00:01:51.783 --> 00:01:53.990\nas well as our existing services, too.\n\n43\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.510\nAnd which of these services\nare our vital business functions?\n\n44\n00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.740\nIn the previous episode, I mentioned\nabout prioritizing our services and\n\n45\n00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.650\nusing our service portfolio management and\n\n46\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.070\nour service catalog to help us with\nthe prioritization of those services.\n\n47\n00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.940\nBecause this is not about what we deem\nto be a priority for the business.\n\n48\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.410\nIt's about what they\ndeem to be a priority.\n\n49\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.360\nAs it says there, we've gotta\ndetermine their requirements from,\n\n50\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.220\nit's gotta come from them,\nvia business relationship management.\n\n51\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.490\nBusiness relationship management\nare gonna help us out with this.\n\n52\n00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.550\nSo we've got to define targets for\navailability and we have then got to,\n\n53\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.670\nas I mentioned in a previous episode,\ngo out there and\n\n54\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.470\nactively identify potential\npoints of failure.\n\n55\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.210\nI called them SPOFs earlier on,\nSingle Points of Failure.\n\n56\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.140\nWe determine a potential point of failure,\nand\n\n57\n00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.580\nthen we'll perform a risk assessment\non that point of failure.\n\n58\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.590\nIn other words,\nwe're going to look at that failure and\n\n59\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.640\nwe're going to say, what is\nthe likelihood of that failure happening?\n\n60\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.090\nWhat's its vulnerability?\n\n61\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.409\nAnd then we will perform risk management.\n\n62\n00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.041\nWell, the risk assessment looks at\nthe risk and looks at the likelihood.\n\n63\n00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:14.132\nAnd risk management then makes\nthe decision as to what to do about that\n\n64\n00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:15.650\nparticular risk.\n\n65\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.128\nAnd that allows us then to design\nthe services to meet the availability and\n\n66\n00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:27.840\nany recovery target, bearing in mind\nthat we have to consider cost as well.\n\n67\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.450\nAnd this is one of the aspects that we\n\n68\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.780\nlook at when we're doing risk\nassessment and risk management.\n\n69\n00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.167\nYou see, if it's going to cost us too much\nmoney to add in resilience options or\n\n70\n00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:42.120\nredundancy options, then maybe the\norganization might choose not to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.198\nRemember, we are delivering value to\nthe organization, to the business.\n\n72\n00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:49.250\nBut they're gonna give us the money and\nthey're going to\n\n73\n00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.820\ntell us within which parameters we\nneed to provide that availability.\n\n74\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.230\nSo really we have to\nwork with the business,\n\n75\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.240\nwith relationship management,\nto agree on this.\n\n76\n00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.930\nIf we wanted, in IT we like to have\nthe best of absolutely everything cuz\n\n77\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.340\nwe want to deliver the best\nservice to the organization.\n\n78\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.390\nWell, if that's the case, if we wanted\nto have resilience options in for\n\n79\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.360\nevery single router that\nthere was on the network.\n\n80\n00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.856\nOr maybe we even wanted it to\nhave a failover network, well,\n\n81\n00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:21.510\nhow much would that cost us?\n\n82\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.690\nWe would have to go back to the business\nand ask the business for their approval.\n\n83\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.580\nWe need to understand what\ntheir requirements are.\n\n84\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.380\nDo they really need that level of\nredundancy, that level of resilience?\n\n85\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.060\nOr actually,\ndo they just need a basic network?\n\n86\n00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.100\nAnd all we need to do is just highlight\nthat these are potential points of failure\n\n87\n00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.260\nand that we accept those\npoints of failure.\n\n88\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.260\nBecause the likelihood of these\nparticular, let's say the routers,\n\n89\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.570\nthe rooters, the likelihood of\nthem failing is pretty slim.\n\n90\n00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.090\nSo we're gonna accept that\nresponsibility for that particular risk.\n\n91\n00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.940\nThat's a decision that has to be\nmade hand-in-hand with the business,\n\n92\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.430\ncuz they'll tell us how much\nmoney we've got to spend.\n\n93\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.534\nAnd they'll also tell us what is\ntheir priority, in other words,\n\n94\n00:05:08.534 --> 00:05:10.600\nwhere we should spend the money.\n\n95\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.556\nSo availability management will help\nby identifying the impact of any\n\n96\n00:05:15.556 --> 00:05:17.350\npotential failure.\n\n97\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.350\nWhether that's a failure for service in\nits entirety or a failure for a component.\n\n98\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.860\nAnd then implement\ncountermeasures where required.\n\n99\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.610\nWe are going to review all of our\nexisting availability performance for\n\n100\n00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.120\nall of our existing components and\nour existing services, too.\n\n101\n00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.030\nWe'll identify any failures in reactive\navailability management and then, we'll\n\n102\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.930\nplan to mitigate against those failures\nin proactive availability management.\n\n103\n00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.110\nAnd we produce this availability plan,\nwhich as we learned,\n\n104\n00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.260\nwe do at least once a year.\n\n105\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.450\nAnd we'll do this for\n\n106\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.785\nany new service also, and\nany major change to any existing service.\n\n107\n00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:03.955\nSo proactive problem,\nproactive availability management, sorry.\n\n108\n00:06:03.955 --> 00:06:07.508\nTied in very closely with proactive\nproblem management, as we looked\n\n109\n00:06:07.508 --> 00:06:12.535\nat in one of our previous episodes, we\nhave to identify vital business functions.\n\n110\n00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:18.345\nThose functions, those processes,\nthat the business\n\n111\n00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:23.550\ndeemed to be necessary to\ntheir organization as a whole.\n\n112\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.230\nAs we already looked at,\nthe example that we have here at ITProTV,\n\n113\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.320\nwhat is it that we need to achieve?\n\n114\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.295\nWell, we've gotta be able to record\nour content, deliver quality content,\n\n115\n00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:41.350\nand we've gotta be able to\nstream live content as well.\n\n116\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.870\nNow, we had the discussion in the previous\nepisode as to which was more important.\n\n117\n00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.232\nAnd the fact is that Cherokee and\nI can't agree on this, right?\n\n118\n00:06:48.232 --> 00:06:50.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because Cherokee thinks that the live\n\n119\n00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.680\nstream is more important and I think that\nthe recording is more important, but\n\n120\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.210\nyou know what?\n\n121\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.870\nIt's not up to either one of us.\n\n122\n00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.730\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n123\n00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.059\n&gt;&gt; It's up to the organization.\n\n124\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.062\nHere I am in IT and I'm gonna have one\nopinion, and Cherokee has another opinion.\n\n125\n00:07:05.062 --> 00:07:08.250\nBut it's the organization that are gonna\ntell us which is more important.\n\n126\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.750\nAnd it's up to us then to facilitate that.\n\n127\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.200\nIt's not up to us to make the decisions,\nthey're going to tell us.\n\n128\n00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.470\nWe can advise and I love that word.\n\n129\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.428\nBecause we can advise based on maybe\ninformation that we've had from suppliers\n\n130\n00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:26.026\non how certain components will perform.\n\n131\n00:07:26.026 --> 00:07:31.110\nWe can advise on history,\non how certain components have performed.\n\n132\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.980\nWe can even advise on, well,\nlet's just call them reference sites or\n\n133\n00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.230\nwhat we know about reputation for\ncertain components.\n\n134\n00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.150\nAnd in fact, we do this all the time.\n\n135\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.020\nWhen we go to research buying\na new component at home,\n\n136\n00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.190\nwe'll do our research first,\nand we'll look at reliability.\n\n137\n00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.595\nAnd that's exactly what we're doing here.\n\n138\n00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:54.599\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nhere at ITProTV we could have,\n\n139\n00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.532\njust looking at statistical information.\n\n140\n00:07:57.532 --> 00:08:01.411\nLike how many viewers do we have watching\nlive, how many viewers have watched this\n\n141\n00:08:01.411 --> 00:08:04.166\nrecorded episode over a certain\namount of time Compare and\n\n142\n00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:05.981\nthen make the best decision, right?\n\n143\n00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:08.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly what we'll do.\n\n144\n00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.650\nWe do this in every single\naspect of our life.\n\n145\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.600\nWhen we're going to buy a car, we might\nwant to look at the reliability of a car\n\n146\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.470\nand we pick a car based\non its reliability.\n\n147\n00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.040\nWell, our business is going to pick\na service based on its reliability.\n\n148\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.660\nAnd you like to think that\nthey will allow us to\n\n149\n00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.190\nselect components of services\nbased on reliability as well.\n\n150\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.850\nBut obviously, one thing that\nwe do which is really important,\n\n151\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.047\nis we have to be able to\ntranslate the technical\n\n152\n00:08:39.047 --> 00:08:42.540\nspecifications into something\nthat the business understands.\n\n153\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.884\n&gt;&gt; Like financial.\n\n154\n00:08:43.884 --> 00:08:45.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] like financial, yeah.\n\n155\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you want to really\nsolidify an idea or argument or\n\n156\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.490\njust your perspective on something.\n\n157\n00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.590\nRelating it into money, when your dealing\nespecially with upper management,\n\n158\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.280\nis usually a good way to go there.\n\n159\n00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.830\n&gt;&gt; But then you've also\ngotta look at other aspects,\n\n160\n00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.520\nlike the loss of faith, for instance.\n\n161\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.590\nLoss of reputation or\nloss of our current market position.\n\n162\n00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.610\nOr maybe even time to market, as well.\n\n163\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.740\nThat could be a huge driver as well.\n\n164\n00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.380\nSo there are lota of factors that\nthe business would consider.\n\n165\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.410\nAnd obviously they're giving us the money.\n\n166\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.440\nBut we still have to be able to\ntranslate the technical stuff.\n\n167\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.820\nAnd we put that into a plain and\nsimple language that they can understand.\n\n168\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.801\nSo that when it comes to that decision\nas to how much money they're gonna give\n\n169\n00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:28.809\nus for something.\n\n170\n00:09:28.809 --> 00:09:30.516\nWell, we could say, you know what?\n\n171\n00:09:30.516 --> 00:09:34.730\nWe could go out and we could buy\nall of these routers or routers,\n\n172\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.001\nand they're going to be, say, $100 each.\n\n173\n00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:43.370\nAnd we can buy these, but\nthey tend to fail at least twice a week.\n\n174\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.620\nThat's what seems to be the current\nthinking is that their failure rate is at\n\n175\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.380\nleast twice a week per router.\n\n176\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.407\nWe can go and buy these if we want, or\nwe can go and buy these other routers,\n\n177\n00:09:56.407 --> 00:10:00.645\nand these are $500 each, but\nthey only fail once a month.\n\n178\n00:10:00.645 --> 00:10:02.090\nWhich do you prefer?\n\n179\n00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.480\nAnd it's at that point in time where\nwe go back to the business and\n\n180\n00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.630\nask them which they prefer.\n\n181\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.050\nBut it's up to us,\n\n182\n00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.410\nas you've just mentioned,\nto articulate the cost of downtime.\n\n183\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.500\nIt's part of that proactive\navailability management is\n\n184\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.570\nthis is what the impact\nof downtime will be.\n\n185\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.830\nIf we go with the $100 routers and\nwe know they're gonna fail twice a week.\n\n186\n00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.990\nWell okay, they may only need rebooting,\nwe just have to go in and\n\n187\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.800\nturn them off and turn them back on again.\n\n188\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.420\nBut for ten minutes twice a week every\nsingle person in the organization is down.\n\n189\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.990\nThey cannot get onto the network at all,\n\n190\n00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.450\nwhich means that working\noffline is the only option.\n\n191\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.540\nNow I don't know about you, but when\nI've got no connection to the network,\n\n192\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.370\nI feel like my right arm's been cut off.\n\n193\n00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.532\n&gt;&gt; Well most people these days are,\na lot of services are Internet-based.\n\n194\n00:10:50.532 --> 00:10:52.585\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nnot even Internet if the router's down.\n\n195\n00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.130\nYou don't have access to any\nof the servers or anything.\n\n196\n00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.370\nSo you're working completely offline.\n\n197\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:02.530\nNow, that might not sound like a big deal\nfor only ten minutes, but it might be.\n\n198\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:07.170\nBecause when you've got 5,000 people who\ncan't work for, what, twice every week?\n\n199\n00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.896\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exponentially,\nthink about the impact.\n\n200\n00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:13.284\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so this is why we have\nto design for that availability and\n\n201\n00:11:13.284 --> 00:11:17.610\nwe have to understand these components,\nso we have to do our research.\n\n202\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.546\nThis is why availability\nmanagement is part of design.\n\n203\n00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:25.003\nBecause we looked at the reactive\nside to availability management and\n\n204\n00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:28.260\nwe looked at sort of\nanalyzing previous failures.\n\n205\n00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.150\nAnd how that could be useful\nto us in planning for\n\n206\n00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.590\nfuture availability and\nhelping us to prevent further failures.\n\n207\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.710\nWell here we're starting off from scratch.\n\n208\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.600\nHere in service design we're\nlooking at new services,\n\n209\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.690\nwe're looking at upgrades\nto existing services.\n\n210\n00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:49.070\nWe're looking at planning for next year,\nbearing in mind that things could change.\n\n211\n00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.070\nWe could be bringing in an extra\n5,000 business users, for instance.\n\n212\n00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.470\nSo we're looking at planning\non a continual basis,\n\n213\n00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.730\niterative, a regular basis,\nwe're planning for availability.\n\n214\n00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.760\nYou see,\nlook at this bottom bullet point here.\n\n215\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.120\nHigh levels of availability\ncan be purchased,\n\n216\n00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.010\ntypically they can be purchased.\n\n217\n00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.898\nBut you have to think about the fact that,\nif you are going out and\n\n218\n00:12:14.898 --> 00:12:18.590\nyou are purchasing, say, for\nhigh level of availability.\n\n219\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:24.191\nSo let's say we've gone out and we've\npurchased those $500 routers, we've got.\n\n220\n00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:29.141\nWell, purchasing the $100 routers may\nmean that we don't have to give any\n\n221\n00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:32.170\nof our support team any more training.\n\n222\n00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.860\nBut going and purchasing the $500 routers,\nwell, we might start have to give people\n\n223\n00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.760\nthe relevant training to\nbe able to support that.\n\n224\n00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.700\nSo again, it's not just about\nthe actually technology itself, it's not\n\n225\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:50.080\njust about the money, but translate\nthat into something for us in IT.\n\n226\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.180\nWe've got to start supporting\nthis new equipment.\n\n227\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.633\nAnd then it gets back to the money again,\n\n228\n00:12:55.633 --> 00:12:59.249\nbecause people have got to take\ntime out to do the training.\n\n229\n00:12:59.249 --> 00:13:03.852\nIt might sound like we're sort of\nverging on project management here, and\n\n230\n00:13:03.852 --> 00:13:09.057\nwe're verging on being able to articulate\nour expenses in the project, and we are.\n\n231\n00:13:09.057 --> 00:13:11.280\nBut we still have to do\nthis on a regular basis.\n\n232\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.870\nThis is not just a one-off exercise\nthat we do when we first bring in a new\n\n233\n00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.630\nservice.\n\n234\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.541\nSo yes, it's very very true we are\nstarting off with project management here,\n\n235\n00:13:20.541 --> 00:13:22.535\nand we're now in new services.\n\n236\n00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.340\nSo let's take at the well,\n\n237\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.540\nwe call this our PROACTIVE Availability\nManagement sort of curve here.\n\n238\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.942\nThe higher the availability\nthat we require and\n\n239\n00:13:33.942 --> 00:13:40.997\nthe more money we've got available to\nspend, then look at what we've got.\n\n240\n00:13:40.997 --> 00:13:43.080\nIf we've got a load of money to spend,\n\n241\n00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.090\nlet's say we've got millions of dollars to\nspend, but we want a high availability.\n\n242\n00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.529\nWell, we're gonna look for\nspecial solutions with redundancy.\n\n243\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.880\nIf we only want low availability and\nwe don't wanna spend any money,\n\n244\n00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.890\nthen you're gonna look at base products.\n\n245\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.180\nAnd we've got to find where\nwe need to fit on that curve.\n\n246\n00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.900\nAnd the next few slides that we've got,\nreally in your downloadable material,\n\n247\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.500\nwell, I'm gonna show them on\nthe screen to you right now.\n\n248\n00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.640\nBut, really, we're just gonna go through\nthis and it just makes perfect sense.\n\n249\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:19.108\nIn that if we start off with not expecting\nmuch from availability management and\n\n250\n00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:22.713\nnot doing much availability\nmanagement planning.\n\n251\n00:14:22.713 --> 00:14:25.537\nAnd it doesn't warrant us\nspending a lot of money,\n\n252\n00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:29.120\nthen you're not gonna get\nthat high end availability.\n\n253\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.970\nBut the more you invest into\navailability management planning, and\n\n254\n00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.770\nthe more money you're willing to invest,\n\n255\n00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.650\nthen obviously the better\nthe availability you are going to get.\n\n256\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.490\n&gt;&gt; Like you said, perfect sense.\n\n257\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, it makes sense.\n\n258\n00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.180\n&gt;&gt; Just about with anything, right?\n\n259\n00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.050\nThe more time and effort you invest\ninto developing it and nurturing it,\n\n260\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:47.940\nit's going to get better.\n\n261\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.210\n&gt;&gt; And I look at this as\nan evolutionary curve as well.\n\n262\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.321\nBecause we start off very basic.\n\n263\n00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:58.368\nGenerally when we're implementing\navailability management, we're gonna start\n\n264\n00:14:58.368 --> 00:15:02.240\noff with just understanding what\nour current components can do.\n\n265\n00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.610\nAnd even that sometimes can be\na hurdle for most organizations,\n\n266\n00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:10.030\nis really understanding the capabilities\nof our current components.\n\n267\n00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.490\nSometimes we'll go out and we will buy\na router just to go and buy a router.\n\n268\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.240\nBecause we need a router, and\nwe need it to be wireless, and\n\n269\n00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.220\nso we need to connect, say,\n20 devices through that.\n\n270\n00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.083\nHow often do we understand\nthe capacity of that router?\n\n271\n00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:27.984\nWhen you're at home,\ndo you actually physically go out and\n\n272\n00:15:27.984 --> 00:15:29.830\nlook at the capacity of your router?\n\n273\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.150\nCuz I can tell you now that I do.\n\n274\n00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.046\nCuz I think about availability, and\n\n275\n00:15:35.046 --> 00:15:38.240\nI don't just think about putting\nredundancy into the house.\n\n276\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.780\nI know I'm a little bit sad like that.\n\n277\n00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.596\nBut I don't just think\nabout the reliability, but\n\n278\n00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:44.439\nI also think about the capacity.\n\n279\n00:15:44.439 --> 00:15:47.601\nBecause if we exceeded\ncapacity requirements,\n\n280\n00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:51.000\nthen quite simply the router's\nthen unavailable.\n\n281\n00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.710\nAnd I think about the amount of devices\nI've got connected in my home as well.\n\n282\n00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.946\nIt's a basic capacity requirement for\nthat router.\n\n283\n00:15:58.946 --> 00:16:04.087\nAnd in order to plan for the availability,\nin order to plan what I need,\n\n284\n00:16:04.087 --> 00:16:08.128\nthen I need to make sure that\nI can meet my requirements.\n\n285\n00:16:08.128 --> 00:16:11.310\nIf I had-\n&gt;&gt; You've got a lot of IoT devices\n\n286\n00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.739\nwith your fancy house and\nall your wireless gadgets and stuff.\n\n287\n00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.050\n&gt;&gt; I counted this.\n\n288\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:18.840\nYou'll not believe it.\n\n289\n00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.610\nI counted this.\n\n290\n00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:24.185\nAt any one point in time, in my house,\nI can tell you now, right now, and\n\n291\n00:16:24.185 --> 00:16:25.911\neven though I am not there.\n\n292\n00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:27.907\nRIght now,\nthere are 17 devices in my house.\n\n293\n00:16:27.907 --> 00:16:30.010\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why, I was thinking 30.\n\n294\n00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.580\nI knew yours was high but then I was\nthinking there's one other person and\n\n295\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.860\ntheir magic number is 30, so.\n\n296\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, that's right now.\n\n297\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.290\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot [LAUGH] compared to me,\nyeah.\n\n298\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.733\n&gt;&gt; That's right now and I know that.\n\n299\n00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so when you're there.\n\n300\n00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.939\n&gt;&gt; When I'm there ,just me alone,\n\n301\n00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:50.501\nI have at least ten devices on my person-\n&gt;&gt; But they must have been [CROSSTALK].\n\n302\n00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:51.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it probably is.\n\n303\n00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.110\nQuite easily and that's not to\nmention anybody else that obviously,\n\n304\n00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.165\nit's not just me that lives in the house.\n\n305\n00:16:57.165 --> 00:17:00.690\n[LAUGH] Let's not forget,\nI'm talking about me and\n\n306\n00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.890\nall the equipment that I have.\n\n307\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.452\nBut you're right, I have to think\nabout the bandwidth requirements for\n\n308\n00:17:07.452 --> 00:17:09.173\nthat particular router and\n\n309\n00:17:09.173 --> 00:17:13.160\nI have to think about what\nthe availabilities going to be like.\n\n310\n00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.800\nNow I will quite often,\nI will work from home.\n\n311\n00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.720\nSo I have to ensure that my router is\ngoing to give me that above 99.99%\n\n312\n00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.315\navailability.\n\n313\n00:17:22.315 --> 00:17:25.240\nCuz I can have a fail in the middle\nof an important meeting.\n\n314\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:32.400\nSo even at home, as a single user,\nI am looking not\n\n315\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.970\njust at the base products as we got there\nand the technology in the components.\n\n316\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.960\nI'm looking at all of my components\ntogether from a system's perspective\n\n317\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.070\nto ensure that I can meet my\navailability requirements.\n\n318\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:50.750\nIt mentions without good\nbase product investments.\n\n319\n00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.740\nThen levels of availability\nwell will be wasted.\n\n320\n00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.220\nIs it true that if you spend more money,\n\n321\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.020\nthen you're gonna get\na better quality product?\n\n322\n00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:02.800\n&gt;&gt; Not always.\n\n323\n00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n324\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.140\nSo be careful of making that assumption,\n\n325\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.180\nit's not just about throwing\nmoney at availability.\n\n326\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.620\nSometimes we think that in IT if\nwe throw money at availability or\n\n327\n00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.090\nwe through money at capacity.\n\n328\n00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.900\nWell, then therefore, we should have\nenough capacity or enough availability but\n\n329\n00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.110\nas you said that's not always the case.\n\n330\n00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.190\nAnd certainly when we talk\nabout capacity management,\n\n331\n00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.830\nwe'll be looking at the interaction with\ndemand management to help us with this.\n\n332\n00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:30.910\nSo don't always assume that because we've\ngot more money or we thrown in more money\n\n333\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.290\nat something, we're going to get those\nhigh levels of availability that we need.\n\n334\n00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:38.030\n&gt;&gt; Well Jo, you mentioned a really good\npoint earlier about the training for\n\n335\n00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:38.910\nyour IT staff.\n\n336\n00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.610\nSo sometimes you really do need\nto take that into consideration\n\n337\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.540\nif you're gonna be\nimplementing something new.\n\n338\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:48.990\nBecause I have noticed that different\ntypes of even shareware or freeware.\n\n339\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.560\nIt may take a little bit additional\nbit of a learning curve or\n\n340\n00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.860\nadditional training there.\n\n341\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.360\nBut then in the long run,\nonce you get people trained on that,\n\n342\n00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.220\nthen you'll be saving money.\n\n343\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.580\nBut something to consider because\nwhat if you buy a really, you go for\n\n344\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.290\nthe expensive equipment, but then you\nalso have to perform the training.\n\n345\n00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.440\nSo you never, you need to think about\nthat than just jumping right in.\n\n346\n00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.520\nBecause, hey this is, it must be\nbetter because it's more expensive.\n\n347\n00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, and when you buy the more\nexpensive product, you say.\n\n348\n00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.610\nIf you're going to then\ninvest in training,\n\n349\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.650\nyou've gotta make sure that that\ntraining is kept up-to-date as well.\n\n350\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:21.640\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n351\n00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.190\n&gt;&gt; With a lot of these expensive,\nespecially with a lot of what we would\n\n352\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:30.320\ncall the tailor made or bespoke equipment\nstuff that's actually created for\n\n353\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.690\nyour organization and just for you.\n\n354\n00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.850\nAnd that training is very niche.\n\n355\n00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.390\nAnd it's very specialist.\n\n356\n00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.880\nSo in order to insure that the products\nare available, you have to make sure\n\n357\n00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.800\nthat you've got the right team that\nare trained in how to use those products.\n\n358\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.620\nAnd how to manage those products as well.\n\n359\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.210\nSo moving on from the sort of\nthe base entry level as it were,\n\n360\n00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.782\nlooking at just the components.\n\n361\n00:19:53.782 --> 00:19:57.560\nWe then start looking at\nthe services as a whole and\n\n362\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.730\nthe processes that actually\nunderpin those services.\n\n363\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.650\nSo this is about how we're\ngoing to monitor and\n\n364\n00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.310\nthings like automatic detection\nof any failures for instance.\n\n365\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.809\nSo if something does go wrong that we can\ndo something about it very, very quickly.\n\n366\n00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.560\nThis is part of planning, this is\npro active availability management.\n\n367\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.860\nThat can be quite a challenge because\nwhen in previous episodes, we've look at\n\n368\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.680\nreactive availability management and\nwe've look the service failure analysis.\n\n369\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.710\nAnd we looked at something\nthat is failed and\n\n370\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.290\nwe analyze what went wrong and\nwhat really caused it.\n\n371\n00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.340\nNow I'm talking about\npredicting the future.\n\n372\n00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.540\nNow I'm talking about\npredicting what could go wrong.\n\n373\n00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.840\nSo putting in the monitoring to predict or\n\n374\n00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.390\nthe monitoring to detect if\nsomething goes wrong well.\n\n375\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.240\nHow do you know what to monitor if\nyou don't know what could go wrong?\n\n376\n00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.150\nAnd conversely,\n\n377\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:57.930\nhow do you know what could go wrong\nuntil you start monitoring something?\n\n378\n00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.650\nHere we are, we're designing.\n\n379\n00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.050\nWe're in service design.\n\n380\n00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:06.460\nWe are designing a service, and we're\ndesigning the components of a service,\n\n381\n00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.705\nand we're designing availability for\nthose components.\n\n382\n00:21:10.705 --> 00:21:12.735\nWe don't necessarily\nknow what we can provide.\n\n383\n00:21:12.735 --> 00:21:17.385\nAnd in fact, it's not until we get through\nthe testing that happens in service\n\n384\n00:21:17.385 --> 00:21:19.405\ntransition before we deploy.\n\n385\n00:21:19.405 --> 00:21:23.515\nThat we really understand\nthe true nature of\n\n386\n00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:27.955\nthe capabilities of any hardware or\nsoftware product.\n\n387\n00:21:27.955 --> 00:21:30.290\nWe don't really know what it's capable of.\n\n388\n00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.980\nSo here we are in service design\ntrying to design a service model,\n\n389\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.880\ntrying to design how it looks like from\na network topology perspective for\n\n390\n00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.760\ninstance and\nfrom an availability perspective.\n\n391\n00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.610\nAnd yet we don't even know whether that\ndesign is going to work until we test it.\n\n392\n00:21:47.978 --> 00:21:50.440\nSo that one it can by quite tricky.\n\n393\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.670\nAnd when it talks about well-designed and\nimplemented processes, again,\n\n394\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.580\nwe're talking there about\ndesigning a process for\n\n395\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.860\nsomething that you don't\nknow is going to work yet.\n\n396\n00:22:03.315 --> 00:22:07.915\nI always liked the use of the words\nwell designed and resilient technology.\n\n397\n00:22:07.915 --> 00:22:10.755\nThese are words are used in the ITL books\n\n398\n00:22:10.755 --> 00:22:13.845\nwhen referencing service\ndesign as a lifecycle phase.\n\n399\n00:22:13.845 --> 00:22:15.875\nWell-designed and resilient technology.\n\n400\n00:22:17.055 --> 00:22:21.270\nYes, but unless you have\nactually designed it before\n\n401\n00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.550\nHow do you know that it's well designed?\n\n402\n00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.080\nCuz you won't know until it fails or\nuntil you've tested it.\n\n403\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.760\nSo sometimes the result of testing\n\n404\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.590\nin service transition means that we\nhave to go back to the drawing board and\n\n405\n00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:38.269\nwe have to start the design again when\nit comes to availability management.\n\n406\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:44.830\nSo once we're in, as we say, we've\ngone past that systems management and\n\n407\n00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:49.220\nthe process design, we're now\nlooking at the availability design.\n\n408\n00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.440\nAnd we're looking at eliminating\nsingle points of failure.\n\n409\n00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.380\nAnd again, as I say, this is our\nevolution of availability management.\n\n410\n00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.400\nSo as we get more sophisticated and more\nmature in our availability management and\n\n411\n00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.360\nwe start spending more money.\n\n412\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.070\nThen this is what we are looking at,\ntrying to eliminate those SPofs,\n\n413\n00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.245\nthose single points of failure\nby way of resilience options,\n\n414\n00:23:10.245 --> 00:23:13.520\nbuilt-in redundancy, or\nhave it hot-swappable.\n\n415\n00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.340\nI think we mentioned,\n\n416\n00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.150\nwe talked about hot-swappable\ndevices in a previous episode.\n\n417\n00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.600\nAnd that's what we're considering.\n\n418\n00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.610\nAnd rapid recovery techniques as well.\n\n419\n00:23:23.995 --> 00:23:27.140\nRedundancy on our special solutions.\n\n420\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:34.270\nSo that's what we really want to get to,\nultimately, but only if we need it.\n\n421\n00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.565\nBe careful about over-engineering or\n\n422\n00:23:36.565 --> 00:23:41.070\nover-designing a solution if we don't\nneed that level of sophistication.\n\n423\n00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.430\nRedundancy, as it says there,\n\n424\n00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.630\nwants to improve availability by using\nthe The duplicate or mirrored components.\n\n425\n00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.600\nBut think about everything.\n\n426\n00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.820\nAnd remember all of our components,\nour software and our hardware and\n\n427\n00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.560\nour environment and our people and\ninfrastructure and our documentation.\n\n428\n00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.289\nWhat about redundancy of people?\n\n429\n00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:03.914\nDoes that mean that we've gotta have\ninstead of just one person on the service\n\n430\n00:24:03.914 --> 00:24:08.160\ndesk we have to have two people just in\ncase somebody decides to take a day sick?\n\n431\n00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.098\n[CROSSTALK] unnecessary rework.\n\n432\n00:24:10.098 --> 00:24:11.639\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n433\n00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:15.720\nSo all of this has got to\nbe carefully considered.\n\n434\n00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.180\nAnd when we talk about redundancy\nin terms of power, for\n\n435\n00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.000\ninstance, we talk about UPS and\nuninterruptible power supply.\n\n436\n00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.840\nOr you mentioned in a previous episode,\ngenerators.\n\n437\n00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.780\nWhat about redundancy in air conditioning?\n\n438\n00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:35.610\nI worked for a large organization\nat one point in time a good\n\n439\n00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:40.390\nfew years ago where we were in a very,\nvery, very old building, incredibly old.\n\n440\n00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:45.930\nAnd the server rooms were in places where\nthey didn't have any natural ventilation,\n\n441\n00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:49.290\nand even if they did, it wouldn't have\nbeen sufficient for all of the servers.\n\n442\n00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.160\nHowever, because the building was so\n\n443\n00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.360\nold, you then were very restricted\nas to the air conditioning options.\n\n444\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.440\nWell, we all know that servers\ngenerate a huge amount of heat.\n\n445\n00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.210\nSo we need to have air\nconditioning options.\n\n446\n00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:06.090\nAnd so when your backup,\nyour redundancy option for\n\n447\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.810\nyour air conditioning is\nactually to bring in portable air\n\n448\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.250\nconditioning-\n&gt;&gt; I've been in several\n\n449\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.680\njobs where they've had to do that, so\n\n450\n00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.660\nI'm sure a lot of you have probably\nalready dealt with that, too.\n\n451\n00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.980\nA perfect example, Jo.\n\n452\n00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's what we have to\nplan for in availability management.\n\n453\n00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:24.160\nIs thinking about redundancy and thinking\nabout what, when something goes wrong.\n\n454\n00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.110\nAnd maybe, and we talk about\nservice continuity as well, but\n\n455\n00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.890\nmaybe that is your service\ncontinuity fail-over.\n\n456\n00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.460\nThat's your high availability for\nyour air conditioning,\n\n457\n00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.250\nis actually having portable units, okay?\n\n458\n00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.290\nYour level of availability,\nthough, it has to be,\n\n459\n00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.240\nand as it says in this\nbottom bullet point, and\n\n460\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.080\nas I keep saying, designed to meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n461\n00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.973\nIt's not about what you want to provide,\nit's what the organization want.\n\n462\n00:25:49.693 --> 00:25:53.186\nBusiness availability,\nas far as they are concerned,\n\n463\n00:25:53.186 --> 00:25:56.170\nis always going to be\nexpressed in their terms.\n\n464\n00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.030\nIt's never going to be\nexpressed in your terms.\n\n465\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.470\nSo business relationship\nmanagement has to help with\n\n466\n00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.960\nthat translation of their requirements and\n\n467\n00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.988\ntranslating that into something that\nwe can technically define and design.\n\n468\n00:26:11.988 --> 00:26:14.460\nThey'll tell us what they want.\n\n469\n00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.220\nBut they're gonna tell\nus in business terms.\n\n470\n00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.869\nAnd it is up to us to take the,\nlet's have a look,\n\n471\n00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:24.319\nthey required service hours,\nit's up to us to take that and\n\n472\n00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:29.660\ntranslate it into a design document\nthat is going to design a service and\n\n473\n00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:35.025\nall of it's components that will\ndeliver the required service hours.\n\n474\n00:26:35.025 --> 00:26:39.628\nAnd as I've said, availability management\nneeds to work with business relationship\n\n475\n00:26:39.628 --> 00:26:41.720\nmanagement to translate those needs.\n\n476\n00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.385\nThose needs are going to be in terms\nof what the business want to see.\n\n477\n00:26:46.385 --> 00:26:50.290\nWe've got to translate them\ninto a technical specification.\n\n478\n00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:58.230\nWe have to understand the impact of\nany loss of service on the business.\n\n479\n00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:02.010\nAnd we have to understand any other\nrequirements that the organization\n\n480\n00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.180\nmay have.\n\n481\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.150\nWe have to make sure that we\nunderstand any external factors.\n\n482\n00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.630\nFor instance, things like time to market.\n\n483\n00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.470\nThat's always a key driver.\n\n484\n00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:17.420\nOr maybe loss of face or\nloss of credibility, another key driver.\n\n485\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:21.250\nIt's not just about loss of sales.\n\n486\n00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:25.130\nWe have to understand the loss of,\nalso the impact,\n\n487\n00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.129\nof loss of service from the organization.\n\n488\n00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:32.800\nThink about designing for\navailability and designing for recovery.\n\n489\n00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.290\nThey are two completely different things.\n\n490\n00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:42.200\nDesigning for availability is about\nensuring that everything is available and\n\n491\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.220\nthen it doesn't break.\n\n492\n00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.900\nDesigning for\n\n493\n00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:50.020\nrecovery is about ensuring that we can\npick up the pieces after it breaks.\n\n494\n00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.350\nThink about what's important\nto your organization.\n\n495\n00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.330\nIt's the difference between continuity and\nrecovery.\n\n496\n00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.950\nDo we want to be able to pick up\nthe pieces after something has gone wrong?\n\n497\n00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.830\nOr do we actually want to try and prevent\nit from going wrong in the first place?\n\n498\n00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.510\nThat's the difference.\n\n499\n00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.730\nWhat do we want to do?\n\n500\n00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.582\nDo we wanna prevent it from going wrong or\n\n501\n00:28:12.582 --> 00:28:15.860\ndo we just want to be able to pick up\nthe pieces after it has gone wrong?\n\n502\n00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.780\nThat first option, the prevention there\nis gonna be the expensive option.\n\n503\n00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.650\nSo think about what\nthe business actually requires.\n\n504\n00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:28.100\nWe design for the organization, not\nbecause that's what we want to design for.\n\n505\n00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.120\nAnd then of course think about security.\n\n506\n00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.750\nI know that I've talked about this\nin previous episodes where security,\n\n507\n00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:41.630\nany breach of security,\nis a potential loss of availability.\n\n508\n00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.410\nA virus could take down a whole network.\n\n509\n00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.520\nAnybody, any person that\nshouldn't be in your server room,\n\n510\n00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.120\nshouldn't be in your server room for\na reason.\n\n511\n00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.860\nThey, again,\ncould take down your entire network.\n\n512\n00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:58.960\nSecurity is not just about physically\nlogging onto your network.\n\n513\n00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.380\nIt's actually about having\npeople around the building.\n\n514\n00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.540\nI'm gonna give you a little anecdote here.\n\n515\n00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.930\nDid you know that there\nwas a large organization,\n\n516\n00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:13.290\nan international organization,\nthat made some claims to the press.\n\n517\n00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.560\nI'm not too sure when this was, but made\nsome claims to the press that they had\n\n518\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.470\nthe most secure network in the world, and\ntheir network was completely impenetrable.\n\n519\n00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.780\nAnd so-\n&gt;&gt; Very arrogant statement.\n\n520\n00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.870\nJust throwing that out there.\n\n521\n00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.822\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean,\nmaking this to the press as well.\n\n522\n00:29:29.822 --> 00:29:31.330\n&gt;&gt; Right? [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; You know\nwhat's gonna happen, okay?\n\n523\n00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.105\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Somebody's gonna try and test that.\n\n524\n00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:34.860\nAnd that's exactly what they did.\n\n525\n00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.800\nAnd I don't know the exact\ncircumstances to this.\n\n526\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.450\nBut what I do know is that\nmembers of the press,\n\n527\n00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.100\nI don't whether they got together or\nwhatever, but they recruited a firm,\n\n528\n00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.908\none of these professional hacking firms,\nand they recruited three, well,\n\n529\n00:29:49.908 --> 00:29:55.300\nthey recruited four people to try and\npenetrate this organization's network.\n\n530\n00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.290\nThey set three people about hacking into\nthe network, but they recruited four.\n\n531\n00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:06.483\nAnd they gave the fourth\nperson a fake badge,\n\n532\n00:30:06.483 --> 00:30:14.968\nand that fourth person went to the site\nof this particular organization.\n\n533\n00:30:14.968 --> 00:30:18.007\nWhen they turned up,\nbecause we know, nowadays,\n\n534\n00:30:18.007 --> 00:30:22.100\nthat our services tend to dial\nhome when they've got an issue.\n\n535\n00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.570\nAnd he turned up,\nhe was allowed into the building,\n\n536\n00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:28.930\nhe was allowed in to the server room.\n\n537\n00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:33.640\nAnd what he did was, just to prove\na point, was on their intranet site,\n\n538\n00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.490\nhe changed one letter\non their intranet site.\n\n539\n00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.012\nSo he changed one letter\nthroughout the site.\n\n540\n00:30:41.012 --> 00:30:45.160\nSo he changed all of the S's to Zeds or\nZ's.\n\n541\n00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.623\nJust to prove the point\nthat nobody is above-\n\n542\n00:30:49.623 --> 00:30:52.366\n&gt;&gt; Sure, it's amazing what a blank badge\n\n543\n00:30:52.366 --> 00:30:54.533\nand a uniform you will get you.\n\n544\n00:30:54.533 --> 00:30:59.255\nBecause a lot of times people, if you're\nnot enforcing those security policies and\n\n545\n00:30:59.255 --> 00:31:01.184\nare relaxed in your environment,\n\n546\n00:31:01.184 --> 00:31:04.700\nthen that's what [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and then, this organization\n\n547\n00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.640\nbelieved that they were the most\nsecure that they could possibly be.\n\n548\n00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.120\nBut nevertheless this guy\nwas able to walk in and\n\n549\n00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.250\njust simply gain access to their system.\n\n550\n00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.670\nAnd it wasn't until,\nhe was wearing a hidden camera, and\n\n551\n00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:20.720\nit wasn't until their camera footage was\nshown to this person who had claimed their\n\n552\n00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.330\nservices were completely\nsort of impenetrable.\n\n553\n00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:27.900\nIt wasn't until that footage was shown\nthat they realized that actually,\n\n554\n00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.770\nyes, they did have a vulnerability there.\n\n555\n00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.713\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Availability management is working\n\n556\n00:31:33.713 --> 00:31:38.310\nwith, remember we've got our warranty\nprocesses and they all must work together.\n\n557\n00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:43.560\nBecause any breach of security will\nimpact the availability of our services.\n\n558\n00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:49.070\nAnd availability is about being\navailable to those that should\n\n559\n00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:54.150\nhave access, and not being unavailable\nto those that shouldn't have access.\n\n560\n00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.055\nSo security, yeah,\nwe've all gotta work together this.\n\n561\n00:31:58.055 --> 00:32:01.240\nThese warranty processes\nhave got to work together.\n\n562\n00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.970\nSo we've got some techniques.\n\n563\n00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:07.610\nAnd we're going to look a little\nbit more in our next episode at\n\n564\n00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.400\nthe specific techniques.\n\n565\n00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.520\nBut things like component failure\nimpact analysis, for instance.\n\n566\n00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:18.220\nWhich these techniques we used to try and\npredict the impact on an IT service.\n\n567\n00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.870\nAnd we use these techniques to predict\nthe impact on our new services and\n\n568\n00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:26.170\non changes to existing services,\nand on a regular basis.\n\n569\n00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.110\nSo in our next episode, we're gonna\ntake a little bit more of an in-depth\n\n570\n00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:36.290\nlook in these techniques that we use for\nPROACTIVE Availability Management.\n\n571\n00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:40.760\nBut for now, what I'd like you to do\nis just to go over your notes again,\n\n572\n00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.800\nthe downloadable material, and\n\n573\n00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.170\njust make sure you understand\nthe difference between proactive and\n\n574\n00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.680\nreactive availability management, and\nhow that actually works together.\n\n575\n00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.600\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan, Jo.\n\n576\n00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.365\nHow are we doing with\navailability management?\n\n577\n00:32:53.365 --> 00:32:54.670\nDo we have more information to go?\n\n578\n00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:57.096\nTrying to give them a teaser here.\n\n579\n00:32:57.096 --> 00:32:57.596\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n580\n00:32:57.596 --> 00:32:58.451\n&gt;&gt; As I mentioned,\n\n581\n00:32:58.451 --> 00:33:02.666\nwe're gonna look at component failure\nimpact analysis, and then we're going to\n\n582\n00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:06.881\nlook at, yeah, we're gonna have another\nepisode of looking at critical success\n\n583\n00:33:06.881 --> 00:33:09.597\nfactors, and yeah, we've got-\n&gt;&gt; Taking a trip\n\n584\n00:33:09.597 --> 00:33:13.360\ndown memory lane and-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] We got quite a few to\n\n585\n00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.425\ngo with availability management,\nmost definitely.\n\n586\n00:33:15.425 --> 00:33:16.922\n&gt;&gt;

the proactive\nsides to availability management.\n\n21\n00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.520\nWe've had quite a few episodes\nlooking at the reactive side.\n\n22\n00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.016\nWe've looked at one episode\non proactive techniques.\n\n23\n00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:55.552\nAnd now,\n\n24\n00:00:55.552 --> 00:01:00.186\nwe're going to look a little bit further\nat component failure impact analysis and\n\n25\n00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:04.433\nactually preparing for failure,\nbecause we need to be able to predict it.\n\n26\n00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:05.050\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n27\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.580\nAnd when we're talking about components\nwith hardware, with moving components,\n\n28\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.920\nmechanic devices, eventually,\nthere's wear and tear on these devices.\n\n29\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.164\nWe need to be prepared for that.\n\n30\n00:01:15.164 --> 00:01:17.193\n&gt;&gt; Bit like my knees, really.\n\n31\n00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:20.467\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyway,\n\n32\n00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:24.018\nlet's take a look at\navailability management then and\n\n33\n00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:28.892\nlet's take a look at planning for\nour moveable components, not my knees.\n\n34\n00:01:28.892 --> 00:01:34.362\nI looked at this particular, how should I\nsay, the theory in our last episode and\n\n35\n00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:37.909\nI just want to explore this or\nremind you about this.\n\n36\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.352\nRight now right at the very start,\nremember that we are either designing for\n\n37\n00:01:43.352 --> 00:01:46.341\navailability or\nthat we're designing for recovery.\n\n38\n00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:50.540\nIf you remember availability was all\nabout keeping things up and running.\n\n39\n00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.560\nWhereas recovery is acknowledging\nthat things are going to fail and\n\n40\n00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.250\npicking up the pieces after they failed.\n\n41\n00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.040\nSo do we want to design for What you might\nconsider to be continuous availability.\n\n42\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.937\nIn other words trying to\nprevent something from failing,\n\n43\n00:02:03.937 --> 00:02:05.599\nor do you want to allow it to fail?\n\n44\n00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.530\nAnd then just pick up the pieces\nreally quickly afterwards.\n\n45\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.832\nSo this ties in very closely\nwith service continuity,\n\n46\n00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:14.570\nas well one of our other\nwarranty processes.\n\n47\n00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.858\nWhy do we differentiate between the two?\n\n48\n00:02:16.858 --> 00:02:20.843\nWell because there's significant\ndifference in cost in the two.\n\n49\n00:02:20.843 --> 00:02:22.907\nAnd so we have to make decisions very,\n\n50\n00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:25.229\nvery early on as to what\nwe are going to do and\n\n51\n00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:29.205\nwe will use risk management techniques\nto help us make those decisions.\n\n52\n00:02:29.205 --> 00:02:32.481\nBut lets take a look at\na technique that we use quiet\n\n53\n00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:36.931\nextensively in availability\nmanagement food planning purposes.\n\n54\n00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:41.460\nAnd it is what we call component\nfailure impact analysis.\n\n55\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.235\nNow you've got a grid\non the left hand side,\n\n56\n00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:47.910\nwhat I like to do with component\nfailure impact analysis,\n\n57\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.040\nI have to say is that I like to look at\nthis from our network topology diagram.\n\n58\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.715\nSo give me a network topology\ndiagram which I guess is a very,\n\n59\n00:02:56.715 --> 00:03:00.331\nvery basic form in the diagram\nto the right, in the middle.\n\n60\n00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:05.964\nAnd then we look at each individual\ncomponent and we ask the question,\n\n61\n00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:11.229\nif that component fails,\nwhat will the impact to the service be?\n\n62\n00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:14.210\nThis is why we call it component\nfailure impact analysis really.\n\n63\n00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.649\nI know it sounds as though\nit's fairly straight forward.\n\n64\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.972\nSo in this particular example,\nand this is just an example,\n\n65\n00:03:20.972 --> 00:03:25.395\nyou'll see here that in the greater they\ngo listed on the right hand side, they've\n\n66\n00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:29.270\nput in an X where a component failure\nwill bring down the entire service.\n\n67\n00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.528\nAnd A where there is redundancy or\nresilient option, and\n\n68\n00:03:33.528 --> 00:03:38.772\nan M where it needs manual intervention\nto get to at redundant option.\n\n69\n00:03:38.772 --> 00:03:41.824\nAnd in this particular diagram,\nthe next one,\n\n70\n00:03:41.824 --> 00:03:45.730\nwell this is an advance component\nfailure impact analysis.\n\n71\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.340\nBecause this looks at, wow, look we've\ngot a probability of failure here.\n\n72\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.361\nSo what's the probability that\nthis could actually fail?\n\n73\n00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.960\nAnd in CI,\nremember that's a Configuration Item.\n\n74\n00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.750\nThis CI is gonna weight in at 100%.\n\n75\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.940\nIn other words,\nif it fails it's definitely going to bring\n\n76\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.330\nthe service down.\n\n77\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.639\nAnd the likelihood of failure is a red.\n\n78\n00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.614\nSo a likelihood of failure,\n\n79\n00:04:12.614 --> 00:04:17.319\nwell what that actually means is\nthat it's probably going to fail.\n\n80\n00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:20.000\nCuz it's red, that's worrying.\n\n81\n00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.458\nSo we're gonna have recovery\nprocedures in place.\n\n82\n00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:26.695\nBecause in this instance,\nthen if it's going to fail, well,\n\n83\n00:04:26.695 --> 00:04:29.950\nwe need to do something about it,\nwe need to pick up the pieces.\n\n84\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.868\nAnd so\nwe talk about recovery procedures or\n\n85\n00:04:32.868 --> 00:04:36.279\nwe may talk about resilience\nprocedures as well.\n\n86\n00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:40.097\nNow, the actual wording in this\nparticular diagram, I wouldn't say\n\n87\n00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:45.300\nis very explicit but you certainly get\nthe gist of what it is we're trying to do.\n\n88\n00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.660\nWe're taking what happened in the last\ndiagram, which is this one here.\n\n89\n00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.300\nAnd instead of just saying, hey, look\nthere's a manual intervention here that\n\n90\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.965\nwe can use to switch over\nto in case of a failure.\n\n91\n00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:03.235\nWhat we're actually saying here is, look,\nthis is which component is more important.\n\n92\n00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:07.215\nAnd therefore, this is where we need\nto consider recovery procedures or\n\n93\n00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:08.995\nredundancy procedures.\n\n94\n00:05:08.995 --> 00:05:12.785\nSo here, in this particular diagram,\nwe're just looking at the component.\n\n95\n00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:15.574\nAnd there's nobody that's actually\ngiven any weight into any one\n\n96\n00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:16.526\nof these components.\n\n97\n00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:20.411\nSo at no point in time have we\noutlined the VBF, as we call it,\n\n98\n00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:22.930\nthat vital business function.\n\n99\n00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.840\nWe'd never outlined the priority\nof any service or any component.\n\n100\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.639\nIn this one here,\nwe're giving it a weighting.\n\n101\n00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.434\nAnd that's exactly what it does,\nit outlines that priority,\n\n102\n00:05:33.434 --> 00:05:36.310\nthe importance of that\nparticular component.\n\n103\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.751\nHere what we have, then, is another\none of our proactive techniques and\n\n104\n00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:47.134\nthis is what we call fault tree analysis.\n\n105\n00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:51.749\nNow where as the previous one looked at\nthe component failure impact analysis\n\n106\n00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:54.802\nlooked very much at\nthe network topology and said,\n\n107\n00:05:54.802 --> 00:05:57.578\nif I take out this\ncomponent what will happen?\n\n108\n00:05:57.578 --> 00:06:02.431\nThis one here says okay then\nlet's take a look at what would\n\n109\n00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:06.530\nhappen that could cause a service to fail.\n\n110\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.938\nSo let's look at what we call basic\nevents, then resulting events, and\n\n111\n00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:13.483\nconditional events and trigger events.\n\n112\n00:06:13.483 --> 00:06:18.796\nSo we'll use things like and, and\nor, or here so in this case then,\n\n113\n00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:25.640\nif a service is down it stop people in\nlogging in that's the inhibiting part.\n\n114\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.548\nWe have to consider what\nare normal service hours are.\n\n115\n00:06:28.548 --> 00:06:31.890\nBut if the service is there it's\nbecause the system is down.\n\n116\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.590\nAnd if the system is down it's\nbecause in this where OR is.\n\n117\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.701\nEither the server is down or the\napplication's down or the network's down.\n\n118\n00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:42.850\nAnd let's follow that network tree down.\n\n119\n00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.290\nAnd if the server is down, it's because\neither the primary line is down and,\n\n120\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.270\nthis one would be an and, and\nthe failover is down as well.\n\n121\n00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.870\nBecause if the network is down,\nthen both of these have to be down.\n\n122\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:02.030\nSo this one's looking at, as we say here,\nthe Boolean functions of OR and IF etc.\n\n123\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.193\nSo this is looking at what will\ntake this server down, and\n\n124\n00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:09.937\nthat's what your fault\ntree analysis looks like.\n\n125\n00:07:09.937 --> 00:07:11.320\nThen we also have modeling.\n\n126\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.681\nIt says here that this is known\nas simulation or load testing,\n\n127\n00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.149\nI like to call this, what if?\n\n128\n00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:20.118\nOr let's pretend,\nthis is my modeling I like,\n\n129\n00:07:20.118 --> 00:07:25.480\nlet's pretend that we've added 500\nadditional users onto our infrastructure.\n\n130\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.630\nWhat will our infrastructure do,\nhow will it react if we do that.\n\n131\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.778\nLet's pretend that we\nare taking away 500 users.\n\n132\n00:07:33.778 --> 00:07:36.830\nLet's pretend we've added\nin that new service and\n\n133\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.580\nlet's look to see how our\ninfrastructure as whole will perform.\n\n134\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.639\nSo don't call me on that one, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:47.231\nThat's not the official term but\nthat's what I like to call moderate.\n\n136\n00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:52.805\nLet's pretend what if, a simulation or\nlow testing for instance just to assess\n\n137\n00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:59.270\nwhether Any particular component will\nactually meet its required functionality.\n\n138\n00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.930\nModeling is a very difficult thing to do.\n\n139\n00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.630\nBecause modeling will, in some respects,\nwhen we're talking about modeling for\n\n140\n00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.700\ndata sizing for instance,\n\n141\n00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.840\napplication sizing You're gonna be\ndoing this on maybe a test server.\n\n142\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.650\nWell your test server will not mimic\nyour live environment exactly, so\n\n143\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.360\nthat's gonna be quite challenging.\n\n144\n00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.420\nYou may bring in a supplier to\nhelp you with modeling, and\n\n145\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.860\na supplier will tell you how\na particular service, an application,\n\n146\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.439\nhas performed in their\nother customer sites.\n\n147\n00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.428\nBut all you're going to get a customer\nsite to another customer site that's\n\n148\n00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:37.599\nidentical to yours.\n\n149\n00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:41.782\nYou might even use reference sites and\nyou might try and find someone yourself or\n\n150\n00:08:41.782 --> 00:08:44.500\nagain on the recommendation\nof the supplier.\n\n151\n00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.230\nWell, you will go and\nyou will ask pertinent questions and\n\n152\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.880\nyou'll ask them how a particular component\nperforms its certain functions or\n\n153\n00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.720\nin certain conditions.\n\n154\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.590\nAgain, it's very, very difficult.\n\n155\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.770\nModeling is fantastic as a technique,\nbut it's something that's very,\n\n156\n00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:06.120\nvery difficult to predict because no\ntwo environments are exactly the same.\n\n157\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.740\nSo we can use it to determine performance\nand to forecast availability.\n\n158\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.580\nHowever it's very, very difficult\nto do because it's very difficult\n\n159\n00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.860\nto get an environment that's exactly\nthe same as your environment.\n\n160\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.587\nSo sometimes we just choose\nto do modeling theoretically,\n\n161\n00:09:23.587 --> 00:09:26.800\nwhich is why I mention\na spreadsheet will suffice.\n\n162\n00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.695\nAnd some tools will offer a modeling\ncapability, but in a lot of instances when\n\n163\n00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:36.800\nwe're talking about these tools,\nthis capability is really theoretical.\n\n164\n00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.821\nThis capability is not by actually testing\nin the live environment because you\n\n165\n00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:47.083\ndon't have your live environment available\nfor you to perform that modeling in.\n\n166\n00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:50.027\nBecause then well,\nyou're in the live environment so\n\n167\n00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:52.720\nyou're not modeling,\nif you get my drift there.\n\n168\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.910\nPart of this is all about risk analysis.\n\n169\n00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.950\nAnd I've mentioned this\nin previous episodes.\n\n170\n00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.810\nAnd I know that here we\nare in proactive availability\n\n171\n00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.848\nmanagement where we're planning for\nthe availability of our services.\n\n172\n00:10:06.848 --> 00:10:11.988\nAnd so availability management in\na nutshell Its role is to detect points\n\n173\n00:10:11.988 --> 00:10:17.380\nof failure and then to decide what\nto do about those points of failure.\n\n174\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:24.920\nSo the component failure impact analysis,\nor CFIA, as we call it.\n\n175\n00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.710\nThat will allow us to detect\nthe impact if a component fails.\n\n176\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:35.540\nNow, risk analysis will come along and\nwill help us decide what to do about it,\n\n177\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.170\nbecause we will look at our components,\nthese are our assets.\n\n178\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.310\nAnd then we'll look at the failures that\ncould happen, these are our threats.\n\n179\n00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.100\nSo maybe a security breach is a failure.\n\n180\n00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.900\nAnd then we'll look at the vulnerability.\n\n181\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.490\nAnd the vulnerability is actually what\nwe would consider to be the likelihood,\n\n182\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.920\nthe likelihood of that failure occurring.\n\n183\n00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.320\nAnd then by understanding\nthe likelihood of that failure,\n\n184\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.660\nthat allows us to then\nallocate a risk score\n\n185\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.210\nbased on the severity of the impact and\nthe likelihood of it failing.\n\n186\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.291\nAnd that then allows us to\ndecide on counter measures.\n\n187\n00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:20.360\nNow, there is no in terms ITIL and\nin terms of Management.\n\n188\n00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.960\nThere is no defined way of\nperforming risk management.\n\n189\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.273\nWe'll tell you that you have\nto perform risk management.\n\n190\n00:11:27.273 --> 00:11:31.252\nAnd there are other ways of performing\nrisk management, such as M_o_R,\n\n191\n00:11:31.252 --> 00:11:33.390\nwhich is management of risk.\n\n192\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.450\nNow M_o_R is a sister publication to ITIL.\n\n193\n00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.550\nIt comes out of the AXELOS background.\n\n194\n00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:45.920\nIt came out of the OGC originally, the\nOffice of Government Commerce in the UK.\n\n195\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.090\nAnd it is just a technique for\nmanaging risk,\n\n196\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:52.780\nbut there are lots more of\nthe frameworks to managing risks.\n\n197\n00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.440\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n198\n00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.953\nI've seen some risk matrices that are very\nbasic, and then some that are extremely\n\n199\n00:11:57.953 --> 00:12:02.159\ndifficult to even understand what\ninformation you're getting out of them.\n\n200\n00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:06.410\nBut it really just depends on how\ndetailed that information needs to be.\n\n201\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:11.660\n&gt;&gt; And we'll always tell you, think of\nthe CSI guiding principles within ITIL,\n\n202\n00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.360\nand one of our first guiding\nprinciples is keep it simple.\n\n203\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.090\nAnd so we will tell you quite\nhappily to start off simple,\n\n204\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.150\nto start off very very basic as you were.\n\n205\n00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:26.310\nSo use something like MOR, and\nMOR is this particular diagram here\n\n206\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.240\nJust use this and\njust look at that and say, okay.\n\n207\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.160\nFrom a very simplistic level let's list\ndown our components or our assets.\n\n208\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.700\nLet's list down what could happen and\n\n209\n00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.790\nthen how likely are each\nof those threats to happen.\n\n210\n00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.510\nAnd then we can work out a risk matrix.\n\n211\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.367\nNow what we'll tell you in MOR\nis that we will give our assets.\n\n212\n00:12:46.367 --> 00:12:47.839\nOn a scale of one to ten,\n\n213\n00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:52.630\nwe'll give them a score based on\ntheir importance to the organization.\n\n214\n00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:59.010\nWe also give our threats a score as well,\nbased on their impact.\n\n215\n00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.728\nAnd then we will give the vulnerabilities\na score of one to ten based on their\n\n216\n00:13:02.728 --> 00:13:03.440\nlikelihood.\n\n217\n00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.540\nAnd then we can use that.\n\n218\n00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.380\nWe combine those scores and we can\nuse that to create our risk register.\n\n219\n00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.320\nAnd that's really essentially how\nmanagement of risk works in a nutshell.\n\n220\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.190\nAnd we'll tell you, keep it simple.\n\n221\n00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.660\nReally do keep it simple.\n\n222\n00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.210\nIt should be an approach\nto risk management, so\n\n223\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.720\nsomebody should be\nnominated to do that but\n\n224\n00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.970\nthen at the same time We're talking\nabout designing an infrastructure.\n\n225\n00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.140\nWe're talking about designing a service.\n\n226\n00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.440\nThe only people that can really\ndo this are the technical people,\n\n227\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.990\nthe project team that are actually\ndesigning the service.\n\n228\n00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.600\nWhilst it says here, nominate the senior\nmanagement as risk owners, yes,\n\n229\n00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.617\nthat's great.\n\n230\n00:13:40.617 --> 00:13:44.457\nBut nevertheless, the people that\nare identifying risk and are doing\n\n231\n00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:49.077\nthe risk analysis of the people that are\nworking with these individual components,\n\n232\n00:13:49.077 --> 00:13:53.720\nsenior management are not gonna understand\nnecessarily how each component works.\n\n233\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.378\nAnd they normally aren't going to\nunderstand the vulnerabilities,\n\n234\n00:13:57.378 --> 00:14:00.670\nwhich is why we need to have some\nform of recognized technique.\n\n235\n00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.060\nBut I do really like and I have mentioned\nthis in a number of occasions on previous\n\n236\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.190\nepisodes, about this null blame approach,\nabout the fact that we are not using this\n\n237\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.730\nto point fingers or to highlight where\nsomebody is really not doing their job.\n\n238\n00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.120\nWe're doing this to highlight\nother vulnerabilities and\n\n239\n00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.250\nto ensure that we actually\ndo something about that,\n\n240\n00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.480\nthat we're considerate even if the\ndecision that we make is to do nothing.\n\n241\n00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.480\nAnd there is nothing wrong\nwith making that decision,\n\n242\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.600\ndo nothing is definitely an option.\n\n243\n00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.280\nSo what else do we do then\nin availability management?\n\n244\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.483\nBecause it strikes me\nthat we are doing a lot.\n\n245\n00:14:36.483 --> 00:14:40.040\nWell what about planned\npreventative maintenance.\n\n246\n00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.938\nPeople like to avoid it, okay, I avoid it.\n\n247\n00:14:45.938 --> 00:14:49.598\nI got a Windows machine at home and\nevery now and then it will tell me, and\n\n248\n00:14:49.598 --> 00:14:53.809\nin fact this happens in all operating\nsystems, there's a new update available,\n\n249\n00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:55.350\ndo you want to install it now?\n\n250\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.548\nAnd invariably my response\nis absolutely not.\n\n251\n00:14:58.548 --> 00:15:00.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What is this, no,\n\n252\n00:15:00.547 --> 00:15:02.324\nI don't want to do that.\n\n253\n00:15:02.324 --> 00:15:03.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm busy, leave me alone.\n\n254\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you put it off,\nand you put it off, and\n\n255\n00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.250\nyou put it off,\nbecause you don't want to do it.\n\n256\n00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:12.110\nWe do the same in our\nwork environment too.\n\n257\n00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.730\nWe don't want to do that right now.\n\n258\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.550\nOr, I haven't got time right now,\nI'm busy.\n\n259\n00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.660\nYeah, there's always 101 different\nreasons why we don't perform\n\n260\n00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.820\npreventative maintenance or\nany plans maintenance.\n\n261\n00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.900\nAnd its generally something to do will\ncost or time, or maybe even skills.\n\n262\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.568\nI don't want to go on that\ntraining just yet, so\n\n263\n00:15:31.568 --> 00:15:35.128\ntherefore I'm not going to\nimplement this particular patch.\n\n264\n00:15:35.128 --> 00:15:38.028\nCuz it means that I've got to\nlearn something new and I haven't\n\n265\n00:15:38.028 --> 00:15:41.490\ngot a time cuz I'm busy delivering\ntraining, to actually take training.\n\n266\n00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.729\nNow being in that position before.\n\n267\n00:15:43.729 --> 00:15:45.149\n&gt;&gt; True story.\n\n268\n00:15:45.149 --> 00:15:45.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n269\n00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:47.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a position we're in all the time.\n\n270\n00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.838\nToo busy giving training to\nactually do any training ourselves.\n\n271\n00:15:52.838 --> 00:15:57.480\nIt's a dilemma that in organizations\nwe're faced with on a daily basis.\n\n272\n00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.055\nSo we will tell you that as part of your\navailability plan you have to consider\n\n273\n00:16:02.055 --> 00:16:03.847\npreventative maintenance.\n\n274\n00:16:03.847 --> 00:16:07.230\nAnd what about in 24 hour\noperational environment?\n\n275\n00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.183\nWhere we're running our\norganization 24 hours and\n\n276\n00:16:10.183 --> 00:16:12.289\nwe have to ensure high availability.\n\n277\n00:16:12.289 --> 00:16:13.520\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was thinking.\n\n278\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.571\nThey're like hey, I gotta take this\nmachine down, because of maintenance.\n\n279\n00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:20.235\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nwhoever will allow you to do that?\n\n280\n00:16:20.235 --> 00:16:22.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's really difficult, and\n\n281\n00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.130\nthe thing is, it tells you in\nthese last two bullet points,\n\n282\n00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.310\nit's easy to achieve\nwith today's technology.\n\n283\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:33.040\nAnd there are ways of ensuring that\nthe service is up and running, but\n\n284\n00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.790\nit's not cheap.\n\n285\n00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:40.715\nIf you're going to maintain 24 by 7\noperations and you want to have so\n\n286\n00:16:40.715 --> 00:16:46.391\nmuch resilience in those operations\nthat you want to be able to perform PM,\n\n287\n00:16:46.391 --> 00:16:52.632\npreventative maintenance, without your\nexisting operations being affected.\n\n288\n00:16:52.632 --> 00:16:55.012\nThat's not gonna be a cheap option, but\n\n289\n00:16:55.012 --> 00:16:59.774\nthen at the same time we don't want to\nimpact on our live operating environment.\n\n290\n00:16:59.774 --> 00:17:02.550\nSo again, you have to make a decision.\n\n291\n00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.750\nAnd that's what's most\nimportant is the decision.\n\n292\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:09.725\n&gt;&gt; Jo, virtualization technologies\nhave really been a game changer for\n\n293\n00:17:09.725 --> 00:17:10.950\nthat last bullet point, too.\n\n294\n00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.030\nJust thinking about how it really has\nimpacted the industry all together because\n\n295\n00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.011\nin the past it was much more difficult.\n\n296\n00:17:17.011 --> 00:17:21.321\nYou'd have to have an additional physical\nserver to provide those services for\n\n297\n00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:22.500\nany kinda down time.\n\n298\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.360\nNow with virtualization and you have your\nimages that you can just redirect and\n\n299\n00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.184\npoint to different machines,\nit really helps out a lot.\n\n300\n00:17:29.184 --> 00:17:31.973\nBut still, yes, expense.\n\n301\n00:17:31.973 --> 00:17:35.490\n&gt;&gt; Well virtualization does\nhelp with a lot of things.\n\n302\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:40.493\nVirtualization doesn't help us though,\nwith, hardware failure.\n\n303\n00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:43.202\nAnd quite often,\nhardware failure is a result of\n\n304\n00:17:43.202 --> 00:17:47.311\nthe fact that we just haven't performed\nany preventative maintenance.\n\n305\n00:17:47.311 --> 00:17:49.275\nBecause we haven't\nactually done anything for\n\n306\n00:17:49.275 --> 00:17:51.796\nsuch a long time that it's\ncaused the hardware failure.\n\n307\n00:17:51.796 --> 00:17:56.230\nAnd so yes, virtualization really,\nreally does help, but at the same time,\n\n308\n00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.810\nsometimes we rely on\nvirtualization as an option.\n\n309\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:03.887\nAnd we can say well, that's okay\nbecause I partitioned my drive.\n\n310\n00:18:03.887 --> 00:18:06.663\nAnd so that's not a problem\ncuz I can update this half and\n\n311\n00:18:06.663 --> 00:18:09.810\nthen I can start running things\non this particular partition.\n\n312\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.530\nAnd that's okay, that's not a problem.\n\n313\n00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.452\nBut then you get a hardware failure and\neverything's affected anyway.\n\n314\n00:18:16.452 --> 00:18:18.652\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Looking at those spin-up times,\n\n315\n00:18:18.652 --> 00:18:22.787\nit definitely does help, but yes, we're\nnot gonna use that as a catch-all for\n\n316\n00:18:22.787 --> 00:18:24.471\nall of our problems, for sure.\n\n317\n00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:28.058\n&gt;&gt; I know I sound like some sort of\nharbinger of doom and gloom right now.\n\n318\n00:18:28.058 --> 00:18:28.601\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:18:28.601 --> 00:18:30.183\n&gt;&gt; But then this is all about planning,\n\n320\n00:18:30.183 --> 00:18:32.082\nokay, it's about planning for the worst.\n\n321\n00:18:32.082 --> 00:18:33.403\nAnd that's what we're trying to do.\n\n322\n00:18:33.403 --> 00:18:36.212\nIs we're trying to plan to ensure\nthat the service is available.\n\n323\n00:18:36.212 --> 00:18:37.980\n&gt;&gt; That's a good quality\nto have though Jo.\n\n324\n00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.470\nEven in like with when you're taking\na look at from a security perspective,\n\n325\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.040\nbeing able to think like an attacker.\n\n326\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.600\nSo you're just yeah,\nbeing motherly in that sense, right?\n\n327\n00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.704\nMaybe that'll help a little bit.\n\n328\n00:18:48.704 --> 00:18:51.485\n&gt;&gt; Well, I prefer motherly to attacker,\nI think.\n\n329\n00:18:51.485 --> 00:18:53.012\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not too sure.\n\n330\n00:18:53.012 --> 00:18:55.071\nOkay, let's carry on.\n\n331\n00:18:55.071 --> 00:18:56.440\n&gt;&gt; I thought they were one and\nthe same, Jo.\n\n332\n00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.617\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually, in my house,\n\n333\n00:18:59.617 --> 00:19:00.889\nyes [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:02.429\n&gt;&gt; Let's carry on with some CSI.\n\n335\n00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:04.079\n&gt;&gt; Shall we?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n336\n00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:06.786\nlet's leave that topic here.\n\n337\n00:19:06.786 --> 00:19:09.411\nAnd I hate the cliche that says that,\n\n338\n00:19:09.411 --> 00:19:14.380\nthe only thing that we know about the\nfuture is that the future is gonna change.\n\n339\n00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.950\nBut unfortunately, especially with IT,\nis that is so true.\n\n340\n00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.715\nThe only thing that we do know\nis that things are gonna change.\n\n341\n00:19:20.715 --> 00:19:25.137\nAnd so we've gotta make sure that our\navailability plans are flexible enough to\n\n342\n00:19:25.137 --> 00:19:25.998\nallow change.\n\n343\n00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.384\nAnd, of course, it's a plan,\nit's a document so\n\n344\n00:19:28.384 --> 00:19:30.281\nit has to go through change management.\n\n345\n00:19:30.281 --> 00:19:35.209\nBut we have to ensure that we can change\nbecause our organization changes and\n\n346\n00:19:35.209 --> 00:19:39.530\nwe need to make sure that we are aligned\nto their needs all the time.\n\n347\n00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.700\nAvailability management\nhas got to be recognized.\n\n348\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:49.010\nIt's got to be recognized that we need\nto deliver availability of our services.\n\n349\n00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.460\nOf course it has, and yet\nyou saw in a previous episode\n\n350\n00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.730\nwhere I went through the evolution\nof availability management.\n\n351\n00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.140\nAnd I said that, you know what?\n\n352\n00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:03.002\nSometimes we start off not investing any\nmoney in availability management at all.\n\n353\n00:20:03.002 --> 00:20:06.122\nAnd therefore we just think\nabout our individual components.\n\n354\n00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:09.908\nAnd if one of them fails then we think,\nokay, then that's not a problem,\n\n355\n00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:11.163\nwe'll just swap it out.\n\n356\n00:20:11.163 --> 00:20:14.033\nThat's bad availability planning.\n\n357\n00:20:14.033 --> 00:20:20.710\nWe need to ensure that availability\nis tested on a regular basis.\n\n358\n00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:26.223\nAnd we have what we call this projected or\npredicted service outage document.\n\n359\n00:20:26.223 --> 00:20:28.330\nThis is a little bit of a gray area,\n\n360\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:33.580\nbecause it mentions this document is\nproduced in availability management.\n\n361\n00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.913\nAnd it's all about scheduled downtime.\n\n362\n00:20:36.913 --> 00:20:41.606\nI'm often asked, and for those of you\nthat have looked at service transition,\n\n363\n00:20:41.606 --> 00:20:44.070\nyou may have done, you may not have done.\n\n364\n00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.270\nBut in service transition, you learned in\nyour foundation material that there was\n\n365\n00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.890\na document called the change schedule.\n\n366\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:56.720\nAnd the change schedule was a schedule\nof planned changes, upcoming changes.\n\n367\n00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.500\nAnd I'm often asked if the change\nschedule is the same thing as the PSO,\n\n368\n00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.280\nthe projected service outage document.\n\n369\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.900\nI want you to think of this PSO as\na subset of the change schedule.\n\n370\n00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.191\nThe change schedule is a list\nof all upcoming changes.\n\n371\n00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:16.095\nWhereas your PSO is a list of all\nof those changes that are going\n\n372\n00:21:16.095 --> 00:21:18.850\nto impact availability.\n\n373\n00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.650\nNot all changes impact availability, but\n\n374\n00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.380\nyour PSO is just a plan\nof availability impacts.\n\n375\n00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.880\nWhen I say think of this as\na subset of your change schedule\n\n376\n00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.730\nit's because every single\nscheduled maintenance.\n\n377\n00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:41.220\nEvery single scheduled downtime should\nhave an associated request for change.\n\n378\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.920\nIt should have an associated\nchange record.\n\n379\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.860\nSo, of course, this should be\na subset of your change schedule.\n\n380\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.762\nSo think of this as part of your change\nschedule that shows what changes\n\n381\n00:21:53.762 --> 00:21:55.433\nimpact availability.\n\n382\n00:21:55.433 --> 00:21:58.933\nAnd this is what your PSO is.\n\n383\n00:21:58.933 --> 00:22:03.183\nSo for this particular episode\nI'm going to leave it there.\n\n384\n00:22:03.183 --> 00:22:05.464\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\n\n385\n00:22:05.464 --> 00:22:09.790\nand I think our next episode is episode\nseven, for availability management.\n\n386\n00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:13.253\nSo yeah, we've got quite a lot\nto look at here in availability.\n\n387\n00:22:13.253 --> 00:22:16.883\nWe're going to look in episode\nseven at the imputs and outputs and\n\n388\n00:22:16.883 --> 00:22:19.330\nwhat starts off availability management.\n\n389\n00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.540\nAnd also the critical success factors and\n\n390\n00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.911\ninteractions that availability management\nhas with all of our other processes.\n\n391\n00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:27.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Jo.\n\n392\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.431\nThank you for sharing that with us.\n\n393\n00:22:28.431 --> 00:22:30.660\nAnd thank you for being with us as well.\n\n394\n00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.785\nFor this show,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n395\n00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:34.322\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n396\n00:22:34.322 --> 00:22:35.217\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n397\n00:22:35.217 --> 00:22:37.639\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n398\n00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:43.501\n[MUSIC]\n\n399\n00:22:43.501

00:00:11.937\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:14.345\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nITIL Intermediate series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:16.315\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:19.695\nIn this episode we're gonna continue\ntaking a look at our availability\n\n7\n00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:20.495\nmanagement.\n\n8\n00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:24.165\nWe've made it to part seven, but we still\nhave some odds and ends to take care of.\n\n9\n00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:27.500\nAnd guess who's back in studios\nwith us today to help me with that?\n\n10\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.350\nYep, you got it, it's Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.470\nHow you doing today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.428\n&gt;&gt; I am feeling absolutely great and\nraring to go, Cherokee, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:33.428 --> 00:00:36.874\n&gt;&gt; I know, I see all that energy you've\ngot over there, you're bouncing around,\n\n14\n00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:38.070\nbubbling over there.\n\n15\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.035\n&gt;&gt; That's hysteria.\n\n16\n00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:40.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not energy, that's hysteria.\n\n17\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.090\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, what are we gonna\nbe looking at in this episode?\n\n18\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.080\nI know we've talked a lot so far about\navailability management, so what's left?\n\n19\n00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.645\n&gt;&gt; Well this is our final episode for\navailability management.\n\n20\n00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:57.302\nWe're now in part seven,\nno you're not allowed to sigh.\n\n21\n00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:58.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; It's not really fair,\n\n22\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.070\nokay, yep, this is our final episode.\n\n23\n00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.435\nAnd we're just going to look at, sort of,\n\n24\n00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:06.410\nthe inputs and\noutputs into availability management.\n\n25\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.570\nWe're gonna look at relationships\nwith other processes.\n\n26\n00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.480\nAnd we're going to look at roles and\n\n27\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.870\nresponsibilities of\navailability management.\n\n28\n00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.430\nSo let's get started.\n\n29\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.930\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n30\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.530\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's take a look then at our first slide.\n\n31\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.820\nNow this is available in your\ndownloadable material, so\n\n32\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.560\ndon't be worried about\nfeeling too overwhelmed.\n\n33\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.090\nI always like to start\noff with the triggers.\n\n34\n00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.060\nWhat starts off planning for availability?\n\n35\n00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.029\nWell, bearing in mind,\navailability management is split into two.\n\n36\n00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:36.661\nIt's split into proactive\navailability management,\n\n37\n00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:40.450\nthat's the bit at the beginning,\nwhen we're designing a new service.\n\n38\n00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.146\nAnd then the reactive\navailability management,\n\n39\n00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:46.236\nwhich is where we're analyzing\nour existing services.\n\n40\n00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:51.590\nAnd we're analyzing failures to try and\nprevent them from happening in the future.\n\n41\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.120\nSo what starts off availability management\nreally is any request for a new service,\n\n42\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.750\nor a change to a service or\nan update to a service.\n\n43\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.260\nOr maybe even security breaches, or\nmajor incidents where we need to look at\n\n44\n00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.380\nthe actual service itself and try and\nprevent any failures in the future.\n\n45\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.520\nIt might even be just a simple request\nfrom the service level management\n\n46\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.670\nto look at the service level targets we've\ngot in that service level agreement.\n\n47\n00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.170\nSo what do we consider then when we\nare planning for availability management?\n\n48\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.950\nWell look at everything\non that left-hand side.\n\n49\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.000\nOne of the important things that I want\nto mention on this one is at number five,\n\n50\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.640\nwe've got a financial information.\n\n51\n00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.940\nDo you know what?\n\n52\n00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.470\nAvailability management is\nreally dependent on money.\n\n53\n00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.610\nDo we have the money to spend?\n\n54\n00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.640\nNow we've seen this.\n\n55\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.940\nWe've looked at all of the options in\nour previous episodes on the fact that,\n\n56\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.400\nhow much money we've got to spend really\nwill denote as to whether we want to\n\n57\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.970\ndesign for availability or\ndesign for recovery.\n\n58\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.380\nNow how much money we've got to spend\nwill also help us decide on what\n\n59\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.290\nrecovery options and what availability or\nresilience options are available to us.\n\n60\n00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.190\nAlso what components\nare available to us to buy.\n\n61\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.510\nAgain that's dependent on cost.\n\n62\n00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.800\nSo really what I want to know, is my two\nmain inputs are the financial management.\n\n63\n00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.130\nBut I'm also concerned about\nthe business requirements as well.\n\n64\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.140\nSo, that comes under number one,\nbusiness information.\n\n65\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.570\nBut I think business information and\n\n66\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.330\nbusiness requirements\nare slightly different.\n\n67\n00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.150\nI want to know the requirements,\n\n68\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.560\nI want to know what the business\nneeds from any service.\n\n69\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.750\nI want to understand what\noutcomes they need facilitated.\n\n70\n00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.650\nI also need to know, and\nthis is part of the business information,\n\n71\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.430\nI need to know what their\nvital business functions are.\n\n72\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.290\nI need to understand their priorities,\ntoo.\n\n73\n00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.268\nAs well as, because I'm planning for\navailability, I'm planning for\n\n74\n00:03:53.268 --> 00:03:54.419\nmy components.\n\n75\n00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.460\nI'm planning for my services and\nI'm looking at my network topology and\n\n76\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.730\nall of my technical information.\n\n77\n00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.200\nSo I'm interested in all of that, and\nI'm interested in all of my trends,\n\n78\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.730\ntoo, from incident and problem management.\n\n79\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.412\nSo what comes out, well look at this,\nwe've got a couple of acronyms there.\n\n80\n00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:14.270\nWhat do you reckon those acronyms\nstand for then, Cherokee?\n\n81\n00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.190\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nthat looks like alphabet soup to me, Jo.\n\n82\n00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.070\nOnly you can tell us here.\n\n83\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.640\n&gt;&gt; No,\nwe've had these in our previous episodes.\n\n84\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.220\n&gt;&gt; On the top right, number one?\n\n85\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do remember.\n\n87\n00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.918\nThat was the diagram with\nthe dark purple on the right.\n\n88\n00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:31.077\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not gonna help you on\n\n89\n00:04:31.077 --> 00:04:32.076\nthe exam, though.\n\n90\n00:04:32.076 --> 00:04:35.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's not going to\nhelp you on the test, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.184\nBut it's the availability management\ninformation system, that's our AMIS.\n\n92\n00:04:39.184 --> 00:04:42.935\nIt's a database, okay,\nwhere we do all of our calculations and\n\n93\n00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:44.821\nwhere we store all of our plans.\n\n94\n00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:47.344\nAnd one of the plans\nthat we store is a PSO,\n\n95\n00:04:47.344 --> 00:04:50.240\nwhich is a projected\nservice outage document.\n\n96\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.898\nAnd I mentioned in our last episode,\n\n97\n00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:58.232\nthat I want you to think of that as more\nof a subset of the changed schedule.\n\n98\n00:04:58.232 --> 00:05:03.000\nBecause that is a document that looks\nat the availability of our services.\n\n99\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.430\nOr, more importantly, the impact and\n\n100\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.090\navailability on our services of any\nscheduled maintenance and any change, etc.\n\n101\n00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.440\nSo what else comes out of\navailability management then?\n\n102\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.580\nWhat do I wanna bring out?\n\n103\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.350\nWell, I want to bring out\nthe availability and reliability and\n\n104\n00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.320\nmaintainability reports.\n\n105\n00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.280\nI also want to bring out risk analysis and\n\n106\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.488\ndecisions from risk management,\nthat's an important output.\n\n107\n00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:32.960\nThink about tested and testing schedules,\nand improvement actions for,\n\n108\n00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.480\nlook there's another acronym there,\nthe service improvement plan.\n\n109\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.567\nThat's what comes out of the service\nreviews and service level management.\n\n110\n00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:45.435\nSo if you've watched the previous\nepisodes, and I know that you have.\n\n111\n00:05:45.435 --> 00:05:49.356\n[LAUGH] And I know that you've watched\nall six, then you'll understand\n\n112\n00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:54.110\nthe interaction between incident\nmanagement where there have been failures.\n\n113\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.190\nAnd therefore, we need to try and\nascertain the impact of\n\n114\n00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.780\nthe failures in order to decide what kind\nof availability options to put in place.\n\n115\n00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.250\nAnd the same goes with problem management\nwhere we're identifying the root causes of\n\n116\n00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.020\nany incidents.\n\n117\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.410\nAnd therefore, that would help us,\nagain, to go back and to find out\n\n118\n00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.201\nexactly what caused the incident and\nwhat measures we need to put in place.\n\n119\n00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:22.655\nI do want to highlight the difference\nbetween availability management and\n\n120\n00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:24.040\nproblem management though.\n\n121\n00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.058\nDo you remember in the previous episodes,\nI looked at the fact that\n\n122\n00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:34.639\nour network was down, and\nour network was down because of me.\n\n123\n00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.790\nOkay, I dialed into an email,\nand I opened an email.\n\n124\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.200\nCuz it had a really, really,\n\n125\n00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.180\nreally nice, sort of,\nwell it had a nice picture attached to it.\n\n126\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.130\nI just liked the look of that attachment,\nand that's all.\n\n127\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.931\nI'm gonna open this, and I did,\nand, sure enough, it had a virus.\n\n128\n00:06:48.931 --> 00:06:52.250\nAnd I brought the entire network down,\nbecause I'm good like that.\n\n129\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.480\nTechnically minded, I am [LAUGH].\n\n130\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.583\nSo problem management would identify\nthat the point of failure or\n\n131\n00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:04.677\nrather the root cause of\nthe incident was me, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:04.677 --> 00:07:06.735\nThat sounds accurate enough,\ndoesn't it, Cherokee?\n\n133\n00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:10.354\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I plead the fifth here, yep.\n\n134\n00:07:10.354 --> 00:07:12.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If I knew what that meant,\n\n135\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.330\nI don't know whether I'd agree with you or\nnot.\n\n136\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.760\nBut anyway [LAUGH] yeah as far\nas I'm concerned, it's me.\n\n137\n00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.280\nAll right,\nI am the failure in that instance.\n\n138\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.790\nExcept that what availability management\ndoes is availability management\n\n139\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.850\nlooks at not just what caused\nthe immediate failure.\n\n140\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.820\nBut how did that happen?\n\n141\n00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:38.350\nAnd actually how that happened\nwas because we didn't update our\n\n142\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:44.450\nvirus protection software when we\nwere asked to do so by our supplier.\n\n143\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.170\nAnd so that virus was allowed through.\n\n144\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.855\nNow okay, I was the person\nthat opened that attachment.\n\n145\n00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:54.549\nAnd I was the person that actually\ndownloaded the virus onto the network.\n\n146\n00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:58.972\nBut the fact was that,\nhad our virus protection been updated,\n\n147\n00:07:58.972 --> 00:08:01.989\nThen I wouldn't have been able to do that.\n\n148\n00:08:01.989 --> 00:08:05.632\nSo why has problem management\nascertained that the root cause of\n\n149\n00:08:05.632 --> 00:08:07.910\nthat incident was me?\n\n150\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.050\nAnd I'll hold my hands up to that.\n\n151\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.670\nHowever availability management\nwent one step further and\n\n152\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.850\nsaid, okay,\nwhat was the root cause of that?\n\n153\n00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.680\nWhat caused that?\n\n154\n00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.360\nWhat allowed me to do that?\n\n155\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.870\nAnd that's the difference between\navailability management and\n\n156\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.850\nproblem management.\n\n157\n00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.260\nNow I'm just going on around this\nparticular spider's web clockwise here.\n\n158\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.000\nAnd I'm gonna take a look at\nService Continuity Management.\n\n159\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.760\nAnd we've already talked about\nthat in previous episodes,\n\n160\n00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.330\nabout the fact that\nService Continuity Management.\n\n161\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.900\nWell, there's a difference\nbetween continuing a service and\n\n162\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.370\nrecovering after a disaster.\n\n163\n00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.530\nSo while service continuity\nmanagement only looks at those\n\n164\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.690\ninstances that are considered to be a\ndisaster, while we work hand in hand with\n\n165\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:02.500\navailability management to ensure that we\nplan for availability when it's needed and\n\n166\n00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.910\nthat we plan for\ndisaster recovery when it's needed to.\n\n167\n00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.650\nSo we work hand in hand with\navailability management.\n\n168\n00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.610\nAnd of course, security,\n\n169\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:14.530\nwe know that any breach in security\nthreatens availability of a service.\n\n170\n00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.920\nAgain, capacity management and these\nare our three wanted processes there and,\n\n171\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.110\nof course,\navailability management being the fourth.\n\n172\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:28.140\nCapacity management, yet again,\nwell if we run out of capacity,\n\n173\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.030\nthen our services aren't available,\nwhether that be band width,\n\n174\n00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:35.820\nwhether that be disk space, whether that\nbe memory, if we run out of capacity,\n\n175\n00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.930\nAnd then our services aren't available.\n\n176\n00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.160\nSo the two are tied together hand in hand.\n\n177\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.400\nAnd of course access\nmanagement is the process, and\n\n178\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.960\ngoing back to service operation or\ngoing back to your foundation material,\n\n179\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.020\nand you'll see that access\nmanagement is the process\n\n180\n00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.110\nthat allows access to our services and\ntakes access away.\n\n181\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.960\nSo it's executing the policies that\nare defined in security management.\n\n182\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.580\nSo it's access management that gave me\n\n183\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.880\nthe access to email in order to\nallow me to download a virus.\n\n184\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.770\nAnd then service level management,\n\n185\n00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:12.880\nthey define the targets within which\nwe are delivering our IT services.\n\n186\n00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.740\nSo of course In availability management,\nwe have influence over those targets,\n\n187\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:24.050\nof course, and in availability then,\nwe have to ensure that our\n\n188\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.940\nservice availability meets or\nexceeds those targets.\n\n189\n00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.389\nAny change to any targets has\nto go through change management.\n\n190\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.090\nChange management, any failed change,\n\n191\n00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.280\nhas a direct impact on our\nservice availability too.\n\n192\n00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:47.600\nSo availability has to be considered\nduring every single change evaluation,\n\n193\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.470\nevery single one.\n\n194\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.050\nWe have to ensure that we can\ncontinue To deliver the services\n\n195\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.210\nas per their agreed targets,\nthe ones that were agreed in the SLAs.\n\n196\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.710\nSo what do we have then in availability\nmanagement in terms of roles and\n\n197\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.890\nresponsibilities?\n\n198\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:04.670\nWell, of course,\n\n199\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.660\nevery single process should have a process\nowner, somebody who defines that process.\n\n200\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.880\nAnd any process manager as well.\n\n201\n00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.140\nAnd that might be one in the same person.\n\n202\n00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.900\nBut obviously go back to your\nfoundation recap, which was the first\n\n203\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.970\nepisode in this particular show,\nthe service design show, and you'll\n\n204\n00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.460\nsee the difference between the process\nowner and the process manager role.\n\n205\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.150\nI also expect my availability\nmanagement people,\n\n206\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.890\nmy practitioners of availability\nmanagement to be technical people.\n\n207\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.070\nThey have to design the service.\n\n208\n00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.180\nThey have to design the topology of the\nservice including all of the components.\n\n209\n00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.720\nAnd they have to specify\nthe reliability and maintainability and\n\n210\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.620\nserviceability for\nthat particular service.\n\n211\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.240\nBut then on an ongoing basis,\nthis is the reactive part,\n\n212\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.600\nthen we have to monitor\nperformance against those targets.\n\n213\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.550\nAnd we also have to create\nan availability plan.\n\n214\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.700\nThe process itself has got to be\nreviewed on a regular basis, but\n\n215\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.050\nwe've also got to work with financial\nmanagement to ensure that we've\n\n216\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.370\ngot enough money to be able to\nperform availability management.\n\n217\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.260\nThe other thing that I want to see is\nI want to see a testing schedule for\n\n218\n00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.700\navailability management.\n\n219\n00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.220\nAnd that testing has got\nto include security,\n\n220\n00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.360\nit's got to include service continuity.\n\n221\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.250\nIt needs to incorporate any modeling\ntechniques and any modeling scenarios\n\n222\n00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.610\nthat we may have thought of and that\nwe may have come across in our design.\n\n223\n00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:41.340\nWe have to make sure that we have got\na focus on both the service itself and\n\n224\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.880\nthat is the technology and\nhow it all hangs together.\n\n225\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.780\nAnd that includes things like our\nexpanded or extended incident lifecycle.\n\n226\n00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.200\nIt includes things like analyzing\nour mean time between failures, etc.\n\n227\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.980\nWe also have to ensure that\nwe've got a focus on access.\n\n228\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.150\nMaking sure that service is available\nto those that should have access\n\n229\n00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.670\nto the service.\n\n230\n00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.820\nAnd that we've gotta focus on cost.\n\n231\n00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.990\nRemember from foundation,\niTool is all about efficiency and\n\n232\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.100\neffectiveness and\nefficiency means minimum waste.\n\n233\n00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.030\nMinimum waste in terms of cost,\nminimum waste in terms of time and\n\n234\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:26.110\nminimum waste in terms of skills, having\nthe right person to do the right job.\n\n235\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.980\nSo, here we have got to consider the cost.\n\n236\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.980\nAny high availability that's required\nby the organization is gonna come at\n\n237\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.140\nan extra cost.\n\n238\n00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.290\nAnd sure, things like cloud and\n\n239\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.710\nvirtualization are going\nto help us with that.\n\n240\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.835\nBut then in itself, cloud storage For\ninstance, no, that cost money.\n\n241\n00:13:45.835 --> 00:13:49.575\nUsing a third party to provide\nsoftware for service again,\n\n242\n00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:53.505\nthat comes at a higher price than\nactually just purchasing a license and\n\n243\n00:13:53.505 --> 00:13:57.095\ndownloading that software for\nyourself and maintaining it yourself.\n\n244\n00:13:58.485 --> 00:14:01.205\nYou have to consider\nthe benefits versus the costs.\n\n245\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.460\nService strategy's going\nto help you with this.\n\n246\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.160\nBecause service strategy,\n\n247\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.280\nwell financial management will\nhelp with the business case.\n\n248\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.680\nBusiness relationship management\nwill help with the justification for\n\n249\n00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.280\nany expenditure and understanding\nthe impact to the organization.\n\n250\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.930\nAnd then of course service\nportfolio management Well,\n\n251\n00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.860\nthey're gonna help justify\nany new services as well and\n\n252\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.640\njustify the requirement for\nour services for the business.\n\n253\n00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.650\nAll of these need to be factored in when\nwe are creating an availability plan.\n\n254\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.700\nLet's take a look at challenges then and\nat critical success factors and\n\n255\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.160\nthe risk that are involved\nwithin Availability Management.\n\n256\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.960\n&gt;&gt; There are always challenges and\nrisks, so\n\n257\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.528\ndefinitely something to be\nconcerned with or aware of?\n\n258\n00:14:47.528 --> 00:14:50.390\n&gt;&gt; Well we have talked a lot\nabout risk management and\n\n259\n00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.420\nwe've talked a lot about overcoming.\n\n260\n00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.880\nThese challenges and\nthe fact that cost is a big challenge.\n\n261\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.650\nIt's something that has to be overcome and\nthat, as it says there,\n\n262\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.048\nconvincing management of the need for\nproactive investment, that's cost.\n\n263\n00:15:05.048 --> 00:15:11.840\nUnfortunately, we talk about this in\ndisaster recovery service continuity.\n\n264\n00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.440\nAnd sometimes, we don't always\nsee the benefit in paying for\n\n265\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.420\nadditional, sort of, availability,\nas it were, and a higher availability,\n\n266\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.190\nwhen we don't really understand\nthe impact to the organization.\n\n267\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's usually until that service,\nor a component goes down,\n\n268\n00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.020\nwhen that need is immediately addressed\n&gt;&gt; And you know what, there's a lot of\n\n269\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:39.670\nvery, very large organizations in this\nworld that have made that same decision.\n\n270\n00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.230\nAnd have regretted\nthe decision not to invest in.\n\n271\n00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.015\nAvailability management, not to invest in\nproactive planning for availability or\n\n272\n00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:50.694\nservice continuity management, and have\nfound that they have lost a substantial\n\n273\n00:15:50.694 --> 00:15:52.364\namount of business because of that.\n\n274\n00:15:52.364 --> 00:15:55.717\nSo, we have to ensure that we can\njustify this to the organization.\n\n275\n00:15:55.717 --> 00:15:58.783\nWhy we need availability management and\n\n276\n00:15:58.783 --> 00:16:04.204\nwhy we have to work hand-in-hand\nwith Service continuity, as well.\n\n277\n00:16:04.204 --> 00:16:09.770\nWe have to ensure that the business\nhave their outcomes facilitated.\n\n278\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.330\nAnd we have to ensure that we provide\nthe right amount of access for\n\n279\n00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.600\nthe business to have\ntheir needs facilitated.\n\n280\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.665\nBut we also have to ensure that\nwe protect the business, as well.\n\n281\n00:16:19.665 --> 00:16:23.725\nAnd we want to facilitate their needs,\nbut not in a way that we are insecure.\n\n282\n00:16:23.725 --> 00:16:27.788\nAnd not in a way that exposes us\nto any additional risk, over and\n\n283\n00:16:27.788 --> 00:16:30.479\nabove what we've already highlighted.\n\n284\n00:16:30.479 --> 00:16:34.461\nSo, of course,\ncost plays a factor in this.\n\n285\n00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:39.124\nNow, when we're talking about availability\nplanning, then we need to be aware of what\n\n286\n00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:43.360\nthe business is trying to achieve and\nwhat the strategy of the organization is.\n\n287\n00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.390\nAnd what the outcomes are, that they not\nonly need facilitated right now, but\n\n288\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.460\nthat they will need\nfacilitated in the future.\n\n289\n00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:55.560\nSo availability management is not done\nin isolation with the organization.\n\n290\n00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.972\nAvailability management has to work\nhand in hand with business relationship\n\n291\n00:16:58.972 --> 00:16:59.608\nmanagement.\n\n292\n00:16:59.608 --> 00:17:03.050\nAnd it has to be done hand in\nhand with the organization.\n\n293\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.900\n&gt;&gt; When we were talking about VRM, Jo,\n\n294\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.538\nyou made a statement that\nkind of resonated with me.\n\n295\n00:17:07.538 --> 00:17:09.635\nAnd I remember, I don't know\nexactly the wording that you used.\n\n296\n00:17:09.635 --> 00:17:13.299\nBut it was something to the effect of we\nneed to know the organization well enough\n\n297\n00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:15.484\nto be able to,\nwhen we see these challenges, so\n\n298\n00:17:15.484 --> 00:17:17.720\nthe organization knows\nwhat they need to do.\n\n299\n00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.191\nThey're not really sure how to get there.\n\n300\n00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:25.172\nSo it's up to us to provide those\nsolutions in an effective way.\n\n301\n00:17:25.172 --> 00:17:28.390\n&gt;&gt; I like to think a business relationship\nmanagement as being proactive.\n\n302\n00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.770\nAnd, in fact, business relationship\nmanagement should be, for\n\n303\n00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.090\nthe most part, predominantly proactive.\n\n304\n00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.650\nIt's not really down to us\nto wait until our users and\n\n305\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.410\nour customers ask us for something.\n\n306\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.720\nWe should be predicting\ntheir requirements.\n\n307\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.680\nWe should understand, by taking note\nof the strategy of the organization,\n\n308\n00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.080\nby taking note of the direction that\nthe organization is moving in, and\n\n309\n00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.970\nalso the ways of working\nat the organization.\n\n310\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.670\nWe should be aware of this.\n\n311\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:03.302\nAnd so we should be putting ourselves in\na position where, as business relationship\n\n312\n00:18:03.302 --> 00:18:07.231\nmanagers, we should be saying,\nI see what you're trying to achieve.\n\n313\n00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:11.653\nI'm going to help you achieve that, rather\nthan waiting for them to come to us.\n\n314\n00:18:11.653 --> 00:18:13.808\nWhen the organization comes to us with\na request, it's generally a request for\n\n315\n00:18:13.808 --> 00:18:14.428\nsomething specific.\n\n316\n00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:20.420\nAnd it's generally a request for something\nthat they don't quite understand.\n\n317\n00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.268\nThe organization comes to us, and they'll\nsay to us, I've seen a commercial on TV,\n\n318\n00:18:24.268 --> 00:18:24.938\nI need an iPad.\n\n319\n00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.664\nWell, we've got to then try and\nfind out why they need an iPad.\n\n320\n00:18:30.664 --> 00:18:33.979\nAnd the problem that we've got with\nthat is the fact that every single\n\n321\n00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:36.911\nquestion that we ask,\nwe're perceived as being negative.\n\n322\n00:18:36.911 --> 00:18:40.870\nWe're perceived as looking for\na way to not give them an iPad.\n\n323\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:45.690\nIt would have been much better in that\nparticular situation, had we known\n\n324\n00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.550\nenough about the organization, to say I\nsee you're struggling with that laptop.\n\n325\n00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.617\nWould something more portable\nnot be better suited to you?\n\n326\n00:18:53.617 --> 00:18:57.259\nYou know what, and at that point in time,\nwe're already, then,\n\n327\n00:18:57.259 --> 00:19:00.006\nthinking about the solution\nthat we can provide.\n\n328\n00:19:00.006 --> 00:19:05.078\nSo we can provide a solution that actually\nsuits our requirements well as theirs,\n\n329\n00:19:05.078 --> 00:19:09.207\nin other words, a solution that we\ncan support and we can develop.\n\n330\n00:19:09.207 --> 00:19:13.778\nI've seen way too many organizations\nwhere the sales guys have come and\n\n331\n00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:16.880\nthey've said, right, I want an iPad.\n\n332\n00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.010\nAnd if you don't give us iPads, then we're\ngonna go down to our nearest store and\n\n333\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.460\nwe're gonna buy iPads, and\nwe're going to start using them.\n\n334\n00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.820\nAnd IT are completely on\nthe back foot on this one because\n\n335\n00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.460\nthey're left trying to figure out\nhow to not only support an iPad, but\n\n336\n00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.520\nhow to configure an iPad, and how to get\nit working with the existing applications.\n\n337\n00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.880\nWouldn't it have been much better if\nwe'd gone to the organization and\n\n338\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.710\nsaid to them,\nI see you need something more portable.\n\n339\n00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.822\nLet us look into solutions for you, and\n\n340\n00:19:46.822 --> 00:19:50.023\nwe'll come back to you in\na little while with some options.\n\n341\n00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:52.107\nWe'd have been seen as\nbeing much more proactive.\n\n342\n00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:54.891\nBut more to the point,\nit would have given us a heads up, and\n\n343\n00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:57.419\nit would have allowed us\nto influence that decision.\n\n344\n00:19:57.419 --> 00:20:00.790\nOnce they've made the decision\nthat they want an iPad,\n\n345\n00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.600\nthen we can't shift them\nfrom that decision.\n\n346\n00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.490\nWe can't move their thoughts unless we can\noffer them something bigger and better.\n\n347\n00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.480\nSo this the reason why business\nrelationship management is\n\n348\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.010\nreally important.\n\n349\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.229\nAnd, in fact,\nevery time I do a class with students,\n\n350\n00:20:17.229 --> 00:20:21.953\none of the first thing that they'll say\nto me is I didn't realize that business\n\n351\n00:20:21.953 --> 00:20:25.100\nrelationship management was so\nkey to all of this.\n\n352\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.190\nAnd it really, really is.\n\n353\n00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.496\nUnderstanding your organization\nis incredibly key.\n\n354\n00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:33.774\nSo, with that said, what I'd really like\nyou to do, because now we've looked at\n\n355\n00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:38.248\navailability management, you have some\nexercises in your downloadable material.\n\n356\n00:20:38.248 --> 00:20:42.229\nAnd you've got probably about two hours\nworth of exercises that I would like you\n\n357\n00:20:42.229 --> 00:20:43.840\nto take a look at.\n\n358\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.190\nBut what I'd also like you to do,\n\n359\n00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.790\nif you don't understand business\nrelationship management, if\n\n360\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.720\nyou haven't yet chosen to do your service\nstrategy show and looked through that,\n\n361\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.040\nthen what I would invite you to do is take\na look at the service strategy show, and\n\n362\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.760\nmore specifically the episodes on\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n363\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.420\nBecause by understanding that,\nthat will actually allow you to understand\n\n364\n00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.500\nthe proactive side of availability\nmanagement, where we're planning for\n\n365\n00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.942\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n366\n00:21:11.942 --> 00:21:18.411\nAs always, if you have any questions at\nall, then we're available on the forum.\n\n367\n00:21:18.411 --> 00:21:21.807\nSo please let us know any\nqueries that you may have, or\n\n368\n00:21:21.807 --> 00:21:26.277\nany feedback, and I will be happy to\nanswer any queries that you have.\n\n369\n00:21:26.277 --> 00:21:28.742\n&gt;&gt; All right, ladies and\ngentlemen, congratulations,\n\n370\n00:21:28.742 --> 00:21:31.318\nyou made it successfully with\navailability management.\n\n371\n00:21:31.318 --> 00:21:34.149\nIt was a lot of information,\nbut it was great information.\n\n372\n00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:37.555\nAnd like Jo says, now just take that\ntime to make sure you solidify and\n\n373\n00:21:37.555 --> 00:21:39.096\nfully understand all of that.\n\n374\n00:21:39.096 --> 00:21:42.950\nIf not, that's the magic\nof the rewind button there.\n\n375\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.750\nSo, thank you so much for joining us\ntoday, and thank you, Jo, for your time.\n\n376\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.380\nBut that about wraps it up for this show.\n\n377\n00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.440\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign out as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n378\n00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock, and\nI wish I had a rewind button sometimes.\n\n379\n00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you next\ntime here at ITProTV.\n\n380\n00:21:57.791 --> 00:22:04.462\n[MUSIC]\n\n381\n00:22:04.462 -->

Francisco\n\n3\n00:00:05.928 --> 00:00:06.654\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.654 --> 00:00:08.514\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.514 --> 00:00:10.852\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:16.360\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL Intermediate\nSeries, I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.930\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ntaking a look at capacity management.\n\n8\n00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.741\nAnd who better to help us with that than\nMrs. Jo Peacock, back in studios today.\n\n9\n00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:25.150\nHow's it going, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.390\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing absolutely great,\nhow are you Cherokee?\n\n11\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.681\nYou nearly forgot my name right now.\n\n12\n00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:33.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't even know\nhow I speak English sometimes,\n\n13\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.527\nit's a difficult thing for me.\n\n14\n00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:38.280\n&gt;&gt; Do you need to borrow my teeth cuz\nI have problem with it sometime, yeah?\n\n15\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.385\n&gt;&gt; I know you, Jo.\n\n16\n00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:43.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And thank you for being with us.\n\n17\n00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.490\nBecause you can't leave us\nhanging with a part two here.\n\n18\n00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.560\nI mean, we started talking\nabout capacity management, and\n\n19\n00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.220\nI certainly can't finish this off.\n\n20\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.930\nSo what are we gonna be looking at, Jo?\n\n21\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're gonna have part two and\na part three to capacity\n\n22\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.650\nmanagement as well, so-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You really would have left\n\n23\n00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.650\nus hanging.\n\n24\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.150\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, in our last\nepisode we looked at the, obviously,\n\n25\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.610\nthe difference between the proactive and\nthe reactive capacity management.\n\n26\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.700\nAnd we also looked at the relationship\nwith the other warranty processes,\n\n27\n00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.680\nspecifically availability management.\n\n28\n00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.160\nAnd I did say that I wasn't\ngonna repeat myself.\n\n29\n00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.710\nAnd that I wasn't going to go over\neverything that we talked about in\n\n30\n00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.710\navailability management and\nI'm still not going to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.864\nSo in our first episode we looked at\nproactive and reactive activities and\n\n32\n00:01:24.864 --> 00:01:27.952\nhow we want to align ourselves\nwith the organization.\n\n33\n00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:32.903\nAnd here in our second episode we're\ngonna look more at the process activities\n\n34\n00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:34.864\nwithin capacity management.\n\n35\n00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:39.064\nAnd I like to think, and I know that\nI've said this in our last episode,\n\n36\n00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:43.210\nI like to think of capacity\nmanagement as being the innovator.\n\n37\n00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.980\nWe're looking for innovative ways to\nmeet the needs of the organization.\n\n38\n00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.870\nAnd it doesn't necessarily mean\nbuying more, as I've already said.\n\n39\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.240\nSo we're looking at new technology.\n\n40\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.362\nWe're looking in bringing in\nresilience for our capacity usages.\n\n41\n00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:04.200\nBut we're also looking at different ways\nin meeting those capacity requirements.\n\n42\n00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.120\nSo maybe we don't need to bring in\nmore capacity to increase resilience.\n\n43\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.000\nMaybe we'll use demand\nmanagement techniques.\n\n44\n00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.210\nSo were going to undertake modeling and\ngonna perform trending analysis and\n\n45\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.650\nwe're gonna perform application sizing to\nensure that we can predict capacity usage.\n\n46\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.858\nSo when we talk about bringing\nin new technology, well,\n\n47\n00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:31.691\nwe mean any new techniques,\nany research that we can undertake.\n\n48\n00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:35.076\nWhen our suppliers are telling us that\nthey're bringing out in the near future,\n\n49\n00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:36.160\nfor instance.\n\n50\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.492\nI mean,\nlook at the sources of information.\n\n51\n00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:42.699\nPeriodicals, websites,\nuser group meetings, suppliers,\n\n52\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.675\nthe sources of information for\nnew technology are absolutely limitless.\n\n53\n00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:51.780\nAnd sometimes word of mouth, is actually\nthe best source of information.\n\n54\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.810\nBecause sometimes we get to hear\nthings from our suppliers, or\n\n55\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.390\neven perhaps competitors of theirs,\nbefore we hear it officially.\n\n56\n00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.020\nSo there's no definitive source\nof information when it comes to\n\n57\n00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.720\nlooking at new technology.\n\n58\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.280\nBut we need to think about things like\nvirtualization and cloud technologies.\n\n59\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.321\nI mean let's face it,\nthey had to start somewhere, didn't they?\n\n60\n00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.451\n&gt;&gt; I know, we've even,\n\n61\n00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:21.560\nat least I've noticed a shift in the way\nthat some of this information is relayed.\n\n62\n00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.030\nFor instance, I would have never guessed\nyears ago that social media would even be\n\n63\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.010\ninfluencing in bringing some of us,\nlike some of us this information.\n\n64\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.630\nBefore it really made a full-fledged\nadvertisement campaign with\n\n65\n00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.220\nan organization.\n\n66\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact, social media now,\n\n67\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.180\nwhen you think about this, a lot of\norganizations are using social media.\n\n68\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.400\nAnd yet, social media was something,\n\n69\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.930\nwhen it first came out, that we were\nall sort of kind of dismissing, really.\n\n70\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.420\nAnd we were looking at this as something,\n\n71\n00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.060\nwell, it's quite entertaining\nfrom a personal perspective.\n\n72\n00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.530\nBut now, I wonder how many organizations\nhave actually got their own social media\n\n73\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.470\npages.\n\n74\n00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.895\nAnd in fact, I know plenty of people that\nwill use things like social media and\n\n75\n00:04:01.895 --> 00:04:05.930\nTwitter and Facebook to actually\nmake complaints to organizations.\n\n76\n00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.930\nAnd you find that more effective now\n\n77\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.300\nthan following the standard\ncustomer complaint procedure.\n\n78\n00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.849\n&gt;&gt; I actually did that last week\nbecause their automated telephone\n\n79\n00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.884\nservice didn't have a human\nanswering the phone.\n\n80\n00:04:16.884 --> 00:04:22.970\nAnd my question to them didn't fit in any\none of those predefined buttons to push.\n\n81\n00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.050\nSo I'm like, hey,\nI'm just gonna message them on Facebook.\n\n82\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.650\nI got a faster response,\nit was easier for me, so why not?\n\n83\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.860\n&gt;&gt; And we're finding this, that technology\nis helping us in all sorts of ways.\n\n84\n00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.690\nAnd that is part of capacity management,\nis looking at new technology and\n\n85\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.940\nlooking at ways to meet demand.\n\n86\n00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.250\nI mean, let's think about this just for\na second.\n\n87\n00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.572\nSo you're using Facebook or Twitter or\n\n88\n00:04:43.572 --> 00:04:48.280\nany one of the other sort of social\nmedia forums to make a complaint.\n\n89\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.200\nWell, guess what?\n\n90\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.930\nThat means that that organization doesn't\nneed to put anybody on the phone.\n\n91\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.670\nIt means that the person that is\nresponding to your complaint doesn't\n\n92\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.600\neven have to speak English\nas their first language.\n\n93\n00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.630\nThe person that's responding to your\ncomplaint could be in a geographical\n\n94\n00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.120\nregion where it's cheaper for\nthem to have a call center.\n\n95\n00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.730\nIt doesn't have to be\nsomewhere that's local to you.\n\n96\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.216\nIt just needs to be somewhere where the\nperson or the team that are on the other\n\n97\n00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:23.370\nend of that message can respond to\nyou in a way that you can understand.\n\n98\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.210\nBecause you're not actually\nphysically talking to anybody.\n\n99\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.195\nSo that's more efficient and yet it's\nan innovative way of dealing with capacity\n\n100\n00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:35.150\nrequirements that's much more efficient\nfrom the organization's perspective.\n\n101\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.340\nSo yes, anything is possible nowadays.\n\n102\n00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.930\nAnd that's not something that we would\nhave considered even five years ago.\n\n103\n00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.890\nAnd yet it's taken off as a way\nof dealing with complaints.\n\n104\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.100\nSo what we're also gonna look at,\nas well as looking at new technology,\n\n105\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.980\nwe're gonna look at working\nwith availability management to\n\n106\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.000\ndesign resilience into\nour new service models.\n\n107\n00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.050\nThe idea is that, proactively,\n\n108\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.300\nwe're going to be understanding the impact\nof any potential performance on a service.\n\n109\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.880\nAnd that will allow us to\nfactor in resilience options.\n\n110\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.270\nAnd again, we're doing this hand in\nhand with availability management.\n\n111\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.540\nYou can use demand management\ntechniques here, but\n\n112\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.130\nsometimes it means\nbringing in more capacity.\n\n113\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.354\nSo we're gonna work hand in hand\nwith availability management, and\n\n114\n00:06:22.354 --> 00:06:23.800\nwith financial management and\n\n115\n00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.981\nbusiness relationship management,\nto justify any expenditure.\n\n116\n00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:29.880\nAnd to be able to satisfy any expenditure,\ntoo.\n\n117\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.220\nTake a look at the activities\nwithin capacity management itself.\n\n118\n00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.150\nAnd we already looked at\nthese in a previous episode.\n\n119\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.660\nBut start off right at the very\nmiddle with monitoring.\n\n120\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.590\nWe're gonna monitor capacity usage,\n\n121\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.525\nwe're gonna analyze it, we're gonna\nmake any fine tuning that we need.\n\n122\n00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:51.950\nAnd we'll implement any capacity solution,\nwhether that'd be bringing in new\n\n123\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.850\ncapacity, or maybe implementing demand\nmanagement or bringing in innovation.\n\n124\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.655\nBut part of the monitoring, and\n\n125\n00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:01.630\nevent management will undertake\nthe monitoring for us.\n\n126\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.030\nPart of that monitoring is understanding\nthe resource thresholds and\n\n127\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.940\nunderstanding the thresholds\nthat we are actually monitoring.\n\n128\n00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.520\nSo all of that is done by event\nmanagement on our behalf and\n\n129\n00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.000\nwe'll compile that to any\nexception reports etc.\n\n130\n00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.190\nThat's what the analysis is for.\n\n131\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.202\nSo the next slide is just simply that\nbreakdown in what we actually do is,\n\n132\n00:07:25.202 --> 00:07:30.060\nwe monitor and then we analyze,\nwe do pattern identification, etc.\n\n133\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.310\nAnd we'll actually put\nthings into groups and\n\n134\n00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.850\nensure that we can, well,\nanalyze the data, as we said.\n\n135\n00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.900\nAnd then, we perform any fine tuning,\n\n136\n00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:47.990\nwhich means workload balancing, maybe\nbringing in differential charging, or\n\n137\n00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.270\nbringing in demand management, and\nimplementing any performance enhancement.\n\n138\n00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.976\nAnd then once we've implemented\nthe performance enhancement,\n\n139\n00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.669\nthen we carry on monitoring.\n\n140\n00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:02.750\nOkay, and we do all of this all over\nagain, it's an iterative process.\n\n141\n00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.921\nLet's take a look more at other\nactivities that we've got.\n\n142\n00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:09.853\nWe've got threshold management and\ncontrol,\n\n143\n00:08:09.853 --> 00:08:13.530\nthis is going to be helped here\nby event management, okay.\n\n144\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.730\nLooking at alert management, the words\nthat we mention in the event management.\n\n145\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.240\nAnd if you're not too sure about that,\nthen please look to your\n\n146\n00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.060\nfoundation material or\nlook to the material on event management.\n\n147\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.690\nThe episodes that are there within\nyour service operation show.\n\n148\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.560\nAnd then workload management.\n\n149\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.190\nScheduling jobs so that they happen\nat certain times of the day, which\n\n150\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.850\nare certain times of the day when the\nservice is not being utilized by people.\n\n151\n00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.550\nBecause we don't want any jobs to\n\n152\n00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.950\ntake away from the performance of us\nactually being able to use the service.\n\n153\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:56.430\nWorkload management also could mean\nload balancing on our network as well.\n\n154\n00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.370\nSo again, we'd start using things\nlike virtualization, for instance.\n\n155\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.294\nAnd as we've already mentioned,\ndemand management.\n\n156\n00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.155\nWhat about response time monitoring?\n\n157\n00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:11.651\nAgain, it's part of monitoring and\nit's just looking at where potential\n\n158\n00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:17.247\nbreaches have occurred and saying,\nokay, if this happens, then do that.\n\n159\n00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:20.515\nAnd we've mentioned passive\nmonitoring systems there.\n\n160\n00:09:20.515 --> 00:09:25.250\nOne thing that I will just wanna mention\nabout monitoring and about capacity\n\n161\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.790\nmonitoring and it's something that\nwe quite often overlook here.\n\n162\n00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:36.180\nIf you're bringing in a tool to monitor\nyour capacity usage on any database,\n\n163\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.980\non any server, on any network, guess what?\n\n164\n00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.368\nThat tool's gonna use capacity.\n\n165\n00:09:43.368 --> 00:09:47.600\nIf you've got something sitting in your\nnetwork monitoring the usage of your\n\n166\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.260\nnetwork, then it's going to use\nbandwidths, simple as that.\n\n167\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.848\nDon't overlook that.\n\n168\n00:09:53.848 --> 00:09:56.740\nIf you're bringing in a monitoring tool,\nit's gonna use capacity,\n\n169\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.460\nit's gonna use the exact thing\nthat you're monitoring for.\n\n170\n00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.880\nSo don't overlook that, you have\nto think about those requirements.\n\n171\n00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.090\nEvery time you download an app\nin your phone, you not only\n\n172\n00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:13.280\nhave to think about what space you're\ngoing to use for the data in that app.\n\n173\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.940\nBut the actual app itself,\n\n174\n00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.450\nit doesn't sit there in the ether\nsomewhere, it's on your phone.\n\n175\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.820\nIt's using your capacity.\n\n176\n00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.020\n&gt;&gt; That kinda goes back to the old adage\nof measure your measuring tools, so\n\n177\n00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.815\nyou gotta think about that,\nkind of coincides with that.\n\n178\n00:10:27.815 --> 00:10:32.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, and any tool that we use to\nmeasure our measuring tools is actually\n\n179\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.490\ngoing to require some configuration so\nthat we can measure our measuring tools.\n\n180\n00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.980\nAnd it kind of just goes back all the way.\n\n181\n00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.150\nWhenever we bring in a tool\nto monitor something,\n\n182\n00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.710\nit's gonna use whatever\nit is it's monitoring.\n\n183\n00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.550\nJust remember that.\n\n184\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.690\nSo capacity management has got,\nas we've already said, proactive and\n\n185\n00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.910\nreactive elements.\n\n186\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:57.266\nAnd so here, if we look at these bullet\npoints here, we're actually monitoring\n\n187\n00:10:57.266 --> 00:11:02.017\nour usage right now, we're responding\nto any outages that may occur.\n\n188\n00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:07.619\nBut we are also researching and\nmodeling into new technologies and\n\n189\n00:11:07.619 --> 00:11:12.320\ninto new ways of meeting\nthe capacity requirements, or\n\n190\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.815\nwhat we might call the demand.\n\n191\n00:11:15.815 --> 00:11:17.720\nLet's not forget demand management.\n\n192\n00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.520\nDemand management's focus is\nto influence customer demand,\n\n193\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.480\nit's used to influence behavior.\n\n194\n00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.980\nThat's what demand management is for.\n\n195\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.250\nNow if you need to know more\nabout demand management,\n\n196\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.690\nthen I would suggest you go\nback to service strategy.\n\n197\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.830\nAnd in the service strategy show, we had\nepisodes on the demand management process.\n\n198\n00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:43.110\nBut in a nutshell, demand management will\nmonitor patterns of business activity.\n\n199\n00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:49.000\nAnd then will seek to adjust\nuser behavior or influence user\n\n200\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.460\nbehavior in order to meet the capacity\nrequirements of the organization.\n\n201\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:00.020\nSo this is a way of changing behavior\nto meet capacity requirements,\n\n202\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.330\nrather than just bringing\nin more capacity.\n\n203\n00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.490\nDemand management is optional.\n\n204\n00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.210\nIt's not something that we're going to\ntell you that you have to utilize, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:10.200\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n206\n00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.140\nYou don't have to\nimplement load balancing.\n\n207\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.330\nYou don't have to implement\ndifferential charging.\n\n208\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.390\nBut demand management is an option\nthat is available to you,\n\n209\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.020\nas a capacity management process manager.\n\n210\n00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:30.150\nAnd then of course, proactively\npredicting capacity requirements.\n\n211\n00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.400\nWe're going to perform modelling and\nwe're going to perform trending as well.\n\n212\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.050\nModelling looks at, what if I do this?\n\n213\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:43.047\nAnd I like to call this the,\nlet's pretend version.\n\n214\n00:12:43.047 --> 00:12:47.200\nOr, sorry, the let's pretend method,\nnot version, for capacity management.\n\n215\n00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.950\nAnd it really is just about, well,\nwhat's gonna happen in the future.\n\n216\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.950\nWhat if I do that?\n\n217\n00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.660\nMy baseline is where am I right now, and\n\n218\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.500\nthen I will, well,\nI'll look at different scenarios.\n\n219\n00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.830\nI will hypothesize,\nwhat if I add in 500 additional users?\n\n220\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.780\nWhat if I take away 500 users?\n\n221\n00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.908\nWhat if I increase my workload by 500%?\n\n222\n00:13:14.908 --> 00:13:17.170\nThese are what-ifs.\n\n223\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:18.964\nAnd so we will hypothesize,\n\n224\n00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:23.018\nwe'll use information from our\nsuppliers to help us with this.\n\n225\n00:13:23.018 --> 00:13:27.826\nWe will use information from maybe our\ncompetitors, maybe industry standards,\n\n226\n00:13:27.826 --> 00:13:31.320\nand they will help us\nperform modelling exercises.\n\n227\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.040\nUltimately what we're trying to do is\nensure that we have enough capacity\n\n228\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.130\nfor the future.\n\n229\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.882\nWe're trying to predict\ncapacity utilization and\n\n230\n00:13:38.882 --> 00:13:41.140\nensure that we've got enough.\n\n231\n00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.400\nSo we're going to use any method and\n\n232\n00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.640\nany technique that we have at our\ndisposal to allow us to do that.\n\n233\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.450\nAnd then we've also got\napplication sizing.\n\n234\n00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.950\nWhich again, is about looking to\nthe future at our requirements and\n\n235\n00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.090\nensuring that we have enough space,\n\n236\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:08.630\nenough capacity in our applications,\nto meet the needs of the organization.\n\n237\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.899\nWhat we have to do is that we have to,\nin service design,\n\n238\n00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:13.930\nlook at the lifespan of a service.\n\n239\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:21.900\nHow much capacity do we need for\nthe service in its entirety?\n\n240\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.760\nIt's proactive, it's predictive.\n\n241\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.360\nHere's a challenge, though, for you,\n\n242\n00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.410\nbecause when you bring in a new service,\nyou're designing a new service.\n\n243\n00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.630\nLet's think about the reality of this.\n\n244\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.290\nFirst things first,\nis when you're designing a new service,\n\n245\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.890\nquite often, if your project\ntakes longer than a year, then\n\n246\n00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.520\nyour service is going to be out of date\nfrom the day that you first implement it.\n\n247\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.110\nThere's one problem.\n\n248\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.710\nFrom the minute you implement that\nservice, if you designed it a year ago,\n\n249\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:53.770\nthen it's already out of date.\n\n250\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.440\nThere's challenge number one.\n\n251\n00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.290\nChallenge number two is trying to\npredict how long you're going to\n\n252\n00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.840\nuse that new service for.\n\n253\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.970\nSo let's say then for,\nwe're bringing in, a new email service.\n\n254\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.169\nWell, by the time we brought in\nthat new email service, well,\n\n255\n00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:13.092\nwe're already a year into the future.\n\n256\n00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:16.761\nAnd then let's consider how long we're\ngonna have that email service for.\n\n257\n00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:20.526\nCuz I'll guarantee that in five years'\ntime something else has already come along\n\n258\n00:15:20.526 --> 00:15:23.230\nthat's newer and bigger and\nbrighter, and you want that.\n\n259\n00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.520\nSo we have to then work out\nwhat the lifespan is of, or\n\n260\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.375\nthe projected lifespan is of that service,\nin order to work out what\n\n261\n00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:39.750\ncapacity we need to be able to\nmeet the needs of that service.\n\n262\n00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.800\nSo application sizing is looking at a one\ncomponent of that particular service.\n\n263\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.090\nThat's the application and working out how\nmuch space we need for that application.\n\n264\n00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.350\nAnd that includes licences as well, it\nincludes the software, and the hardware,\n\n265\n00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.620\nand the environment it,\nincludes the licensing.\n\n266\n00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:03.956\nSo what we've looked at so far in these\nprevious few slides in this episode so\n\n267\n00:16:03.956 --> 00:16:09.203\nfar is just techniques at a very,\nvery high level to predict our\n\n268\n00:16:09.203 --> 00:16:14.450\ncapacity utilization for\nour future business requirements.\n\n269\n00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.574\nAnd I'll mention two words here, and\nthe words that I mention was high level.\n\n270\n00:16:19.574 --> 00:16:24.277\nAnd it's really important that I cannot do\nthis at a detailed level because I don't\n\n271\n00:16:24.277 --> 00:16:27.230\nknow what services you're bringing in.\n\n272\n00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:33.503\nSo there is absolutely no way that we\ncan test you, from an ITIL perspective,\n\n273\n00:16:33.503 --> 00:16:39.018\non any details to do with modeling,\nto do with application sizing.\n\n274\n00:16:39.018 --> 00:16:42.690\nBecause we don't know what\nservices you're bringing in.\n\n275\n00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:47.620\nWhat we can do is we can tell you what\ntechniques you can use to predict\n\n276\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.640\nthe utilization and\nthe requirements for each service.\n\n277\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.080\nAnd that's what we've done so\nfar in this episode.\n\n278\n00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.340\nSo what I'd like you to do right now\nis I would like you just to review\n\n279\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.230\nthose techniques, and as I've\nalready said, it's at a high level.\n\n280\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.918\nSo just take a moment to\nreview those techniques and\n\n281\n00:17:02.918 --> 00:17:07.107\nif you do have any questions regarding\nthose techniques, then please come back\n\n282\n00:17:07.107 --> 00:17:10.944\nto us via the following and I will be\nhappy to help you in any way that I can.\n\n283\n00:17:10.944 -->

00:00:14.120\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nITIL Intermediate series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.340\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.840\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat IT services continuity management.\n\n9\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.480\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.930\nHow is it going today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.710\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n12\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.360\nThank you, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.060\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.000\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty well.\n\n15\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.950\nThank you for asking.\n\n16\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.235\nI'm excited because we're gonna be\nlooking at a new process in this section.\n\n17\n00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:37.337\nBut I was wondering if you could\nexplain a little bit what we're gonna\n\n18\n00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.706\nbe talking about here and\nwhat we'll be looking at.\n\n19\n00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.009\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be looking at today,\nin this particular episode and\n\n20\n00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.782\nin fact a couple of other\nsubsequent episodes as well.\n\n21\n00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:50.231\nWe're gonna look at\nIT Service Continuity which is all about\n\n22\n00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:53.670\nmaintaining continuity and services.\n\n23\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.490\nNow, I know that some people\ncall this disaster recovery and\n\n24\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.770\nit's not about disaster recovery.\n\n25\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.350\nThis is about Service Continuity.\n\n26\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.510\nThere's a huge difference.\n\n27\n00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.530\nDo you know the difference?\n\n28\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.350\n&gt;&gt; So I know we've talked\nabout this before, Jo, and\n\n29\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.620\nlet me just see if I can\nremember the idea here.\n\n30\n00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.262\nSo disaster recovery would be if there\nwas some kind of catastrophic event,\n\n31\n00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:17.262\nhow I as an organization react to\nthat event and how long it takes.\n\n32\n00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:21.098\nI know usually you have when we're\ntalking about like a hot site,\n\n33\n00:01:21.098 --> 00:01:24.608\nyou have at least like 24 hours\nto get that up and running.\n\n34\n00:01:24.608 --> 00:01:27.500\nBut for continuity, that's something\nthat you wanna maintain and\n\n35\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.540\nkeep it stable throughout\nthe entire process.\n\n36\n00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.350\nYou're not allowing for that disruption.\n\n37\n00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, well let's kinda get\nrid of the technical terms,\n\n38\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.290\nas it were for the moment.\n\n39\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.610\nBecause a is not that, but anyway.\n\n40\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.660\nWhat we're gonna talk about\nis exactly as you say,\n\n41\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.400\nService Continuity is about\nkeeping things up and running.\n\n42\n00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.950\nIt's about not letting things fail.\n\n43\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.850\nWhereas disaster recovery is about picking\nup the pieces after they have failed.\n\n44\n00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.924\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So what we actually want to do is we\n\n45\n00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:58.342\nwant to try and I mean this\nincludes disaster recovery as well.\n\n46\n00:01:58.342 --> 00:02:01.733\nThings do fail, but what we wanna try and\ndo is we want to try and\n\n47\n00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.309\nkeep things up and running.\n\n48\n00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:08.750\nRather than picking up the pieces after\neverything has crashed all around us.\n\n49\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.380\nService Continuity is\nsimply about supporting\n\n50\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.890\nthe overall Business Continuity\nas it says.\n\n51\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.310\nNow this is where it gets\nquite interesting because in\n\n52\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.010\navailability management and\n\n53\n00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.350\nin demand management as well we talked\nabout vital business functions.\n\n54\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.440\nAnd a vital business function is\nsomething that a company has to\n\n55\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.780\ndo in order to be able\nto survive as a company.\n\n56\n00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.140\nSo for instance let's take\na grocery store, a supermarket.\n\n57\n00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.180\nA supermarket has a vital\nbusiness function, believe it or\n\n58\n00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.360\nnot, of selling stuff.\n\n59\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.090\n&gt;&gt; Imagine that.\n\n60\n00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, imagine that, right?\n\n61\n00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.480\nHas a vital business\nfunction of selling stuff.\n\n62\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.520\nSo let's say that there's\none supermarket out there,\n\n63\n00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.620\njust one store that happens to,\nI don't know explode in a ball of flames.\n\n64\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.080\nLuckily there was nobody in it.\n\n65\n00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.400\nExplode in a ball of flames,\nit's burnt to the ground.\n\n66\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.372\nWhat's the vital business function of that\none super store right now, do you think?\n\n67\n00:03:11.372 --> 00:03:13.588\nLet me tell you, nobody ever\ncomes up with the right answer.\n\n68\n00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:14.660\n&gt;&gt; I am thinking.\n\n69\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.260\nI'm really really I'm thinking here and I\ndon't want you guys to have to wait on me\n\n70\n00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.310\nto actually try to come\nup with a good answer.\n\n71\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.840\nSo what, I don't know Jo,\nwhat would it be?\n\n72\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.020\nI mean just to maintain,\nmake sure everyone's safe I guess.\n\n73\n00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.070\nBut if you've already said\neveryone's safe, yeah I don't know.\n\n74\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.537\n&gt;&gt; People always go with the answers of\nwell we've gotta get the fire brigade,\n\n75\n00:03:34.537 --> 00:03:36.038\nthe fire department out.\n\n76\n00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:39.464\nOr we've gotta get it rebuilt.\n\n77\n00:03:39.464 --> 00:03:44.398\nYeah but that's not it's vital business\nfunction right now, at this point in time.\n\n78\n00:03:44.398 --> 00:03:47.278\nSure okay, we've gotta get\nthe fire department out but\n\n79\n00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:49.430\nthat's something that happens anyway.\n\n80\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.430\nRebuilding is gonna take months.\n\n81\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.310\nThe vital business function of that\nstore at that moment in time is\n\n82\n00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.250\nactually to divert customers to\nthe nearest alternate store.\n\n83\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.410\nThat's its vital business function,\n\n84\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.160\nbecause what we want to\ndo is maintain sales.\n\n85\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.970\nSo you might turn around and say,\nokay so what's that gotta do with IT?\n\n86\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.430\nWell, in IT we like to automate.\n\n87\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.680\nWe really do like to try and make things\nas streamlined as possible, and in fact,\n\n88\n00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.170\nthat's the aim of ITIL is to\nbe efficient and effective.\n\n89\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.120\nAnd we'll use things like event\nmanagement as a process to do this.\n\n90\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.740\nTo imagine you're working in\nIT in a supermarket chain.\n\n91\n00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.170\nIn a grocery store chain.\n\n92\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.930\nAnd you happen to see\nevent management that\n\n93\n00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.320\none store has lost all of it's check outs.\n\n94\n00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.810\nWhat do you do?\n\n95\n00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.760\nThe IT thing to do is to suddenly\nsay no we've lost two servers.\n\n96\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.220\nWe lost all of these check\nouts let's quickly get a truck\n\n97\n00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.610\ndown there with two servers and\nwith a lot of checkouts.\n\n98\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.630\nAnd we'll get some technicians\nout there to install these.\n\n99\n00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.940\nThat's not a lot of help to the fire\ndepartment who are trying to put out\n\n100\n00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.800\nthe flames right now.\n\n101\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.130\nWhat we need to do is we need to\nactually provide additional bandwidth\n\n102\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.210\nto our marketing team.\n\n103\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.570\nTo allow our marketing team\nthen to send out fliers and\n\n104\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.540\nmailers with coupons and vouchers,\nand directions to the nearest store.\n\n105\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.470\nThat's how we support\nthe organization in this instance.\n\n106\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.750\nSo part of IT Service Continuity is\nunderstanding not only the VBF's\n\n107\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.810\nto the organization but how those VBF's\nmight change in the event of a disaster.\n\n108\n00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.300\nSo we can facilitate the right outcomes.\n\n109\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.180\nSo we can provide the right support.\n\n110\n00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.750\nAnd remember, it's not what we want to do,\nit's what the business need us to do.\n\n111\n00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.160\nIt's no good turning up at a store site\nwith all of these firetrucks around\n\n112\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.990\nwith a truck full of servers and\ncheck outs.\n\n113\n00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.820\nThat's not gonna help anybody and\nit's kind of gonna sit around for\n\n114\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.150\na good few months while\neverything gets rebuild.\n\n115\n00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.460\nAnd what we actually want to do is\nsupport the business with the appropriate\n\n116\n00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.170\ncontinuity mechanism.\n\n117\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.290\nAnd so this is why we say you have to\nsupport overall Business Continuity.\n\n118\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.550\nIt's not about what we want to do.\n\n119\n00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.970\nIt's about what the business needs.\n\n120\n00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.680\nSo of course we have to have\nthose VBF's highlighted\n\n121\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.910\nfrom availability management and\nfrom demand management.\n\n122\n00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.320\nAnd that will help us to identify well,\n\n123\n00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.650\nwhat we need to restore and\nhow we need to restore it.\n\n124\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.500\nWe've got to have\nan IT Service Continuity plan.\n\n125\n00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.420\nBut hand in hand with the organization we\nhave to asses business impact analysis.\n\n126\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.730\nAssess business impact of any failures.\n\n127\n00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.590\nAnd we have to conduct risk assessments,\nand\n\n128\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.100\nwork with the organization to establish\nappropriate recovery mechanisms.\n\n129\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.070\nAnd the obvious recovery mechanism\n\n130\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.790\nis not always the right recovery\nmechanism, just remember that.\n\n131\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.845\nNow it mentions in our last bullet point\non there about agreeing contracts with\n\n132\n00:06:58.845 --> 00:07:00.430\nsuppliers.\n\n133\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.690\nI'd expect within every contract with\nyour suppliers that you should have\n\n134\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.360\nsome clause to cover cases of disaster.\n\n135\n00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.770\nService Continuity applies to any event\nthat we considered to be serious enough,\n\n136\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.720\nto be clustered as a disaster.\n\n137\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.960\nAnd so we should have some clause\nin our contract that covers\n\n138\n00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.220\nwhat we would consider to be a disaster.\n\n139\n00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.270\nSo in this instance I need\nyou to get 300 PCs to\n\n140\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.850\nme within an hour, for\ninstance, should this happen.\n\n141\n00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.530\nI don't know how you're going to do that.\n\n142\n00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.460\nThat's entirely up to you.\n\n143\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.130\nI can give you 1,001\ndifferent ways to do this but\n\n144\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.210\nit really depends on your contract.\n\n145\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.783\nThat is completely unique to you.\n\n146\n00:07:44.783 --> 00:07:49.089\nSo as I've said we have to focus on these\nevents that the business considers to be\n\n147\n00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:53.589\na disaster, not what you consider to be a\ndisaster what the business considers to be\n\n148\n00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:54.318\na disaster.\n\n149\n00:07:54.318 --> 00:07:59.393\nAnd we produce strategies and plans in\nline with the organizations strategy\n\n150\n00:07:59.393 --> 00:08:04.718\nplans And then there's the next bit\ndown there on this bullet point there.\n\n151\n00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:07.786\nThe bit that talks about testing.\n\n152\n00:08:09.898 --> 00:08:11.830\nHow often do you think we should test,\nCherokee?\n\n153\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.480\n&gt;&gt; As much as your organization\nrequires you to test.\n\n154\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:23.170\nI mean, it really is contingent upon that\nfor your business continuity plan here.\n\n155\n00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.480\nAll right, so, again,\nany major change in the network.\n\n156\n00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right.\n\n157\n00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.070\n&gt;&gt; Any new service, again,\nlike we had spoke about.\n\n158\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n159\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.430\n&gt;&gt; And then whatever your predetermined\nmaintenance schedule looks like.\n\n160\n00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.970\nAnd that's something, maybe,\nI know you had said at least once a year.\n\n161\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:39.700\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n162\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.280\nmaybe it just depends on if they have like\nquarterly, or whatever that standard is.\n\n163\n00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.040\n&gt;&gt; So\nthere are two different types of tests.\n\n164\n00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.480\nAnd you'll notice that it\nsays test enough plans.\n\n165\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:58.380\nSo we test our plans, and we also test our\nservice continuity mechanisms as well.\n\n166\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.260\nTesting of the plans invariably\ninvolves a walk-through of the plans,\n\n167\n00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.350\nthat's what it does.\n\n168\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.330\nIt's testing that everything\nis going to work,\n\n169\n00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.310\nit's testing the,\nour suppliers all ready, etc.\n\n170\n00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.760\nAnd organizations\nare quite happy to do that.\n\n171\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.160\nThe testing of the actual\nmechanisms themselves,\n\n172\n00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.570\nthat means somebody's gotta walk into your\nserver room and press that big red button.\n\n173\n00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.985\nAnd guess how many people\nare reluctant to do that?\n\n174\n00:09:24.183 --> 00:09:28.425\nService continuity is an area\nwhere organizations will not like\n\n175\n00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:33.071\nto invest budget because it's a bit\nlike buying an insurance policy.\n\n176\n00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:37.615\nAnd they'd rather not do that because\nthey'd rather hope that something\n\n177\n00:09:37.615 --> 00:09:38.568\ndidn't happen.\n\n178\n00:09:38.568 --> 00:09:43.530\nAnd they'd rather beef up availability\nmanagement and beef up capacity\n\n179\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:48.590\nmanagement and in the hope that service\ncontinuity management is not needed.\n\n180\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.700\nBut obviously I mean,\nwe'd consider that to be a false economy.\n\n181\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.510\nHowever, we'd also tell you that you\nperform the regular risk assessment.\n\n182\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.050\nAnd if the risk assessment says that\nyou are willing to accept that risk,\n\n183\n00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.200\nthen obviously that's a decision\nthat you have to make.\n\n184\n00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.480\nBut I know that I've seen plenty of\ninternational organizations, and in fact\n\n185\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.540\nyou hear about a new one every single\nweek, where a disaster has happened.\n\n186\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.070\nAnd their service continuity\nhasn't been tested for some time.\n\n187\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.760\nAnd funnily enough, it doesn't work.\n\n188\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.720\nSo even though it's going to\nresult in business disruption,\n\n189\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.370\nwe have to find a way to actually test\nour service continuity mechanisms,\n\n190\n00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.840\nas well as just\na walk-through of the plans.\n\n191\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.520\nSo yeah, we'll tell you that you need to\nbe testing this at least once a year and\n\n192\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.230\nafter any major change.\n\n193\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.890\nYou have to consider your\ndisaster recovery site\n\n194\n00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.250\nwhen it comes to major changes.\n\n195\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:46.832\nAgain, another common pitfall here\nis that we upgrade our live site,\n\n196\n00:10:46.832 --> 00:10:53.690\nwe might migrate all of our PCs, etc,\nto a new version of an operating system.\n\n197\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.720\nAnd we don't bother upgrading any\nPCs at our disaster recovery site.\n\n198\n00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.950\nAnd we get to our DR site because\nthere's been a disaster and\n\n199\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.600\nfind that nothing works.\n\n200\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.130\nAnd all of these backups that we've got,\nwe can't actually restore onto\n\n201\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.410\nthese PCs because the operating\nsystem's out of date.\n\n202\n00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.500\nYou wouldn't believe how\nmany times that happens.\n\n203\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.890\nAnd in terms of frequency,\nI'd seriously say that that happens in at\n\n204\n00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.630\nleast 60% to 70% of DR sites.\n\n205\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.280\nWhich is why we say,\nyou've got to test them.\n\n206\n00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.736\nYou know, we talked about backups\nin availability management and\n\n207\n00:11:25.736 --> 00:11:31.560\nin capacity management, and\nI'll say it exactly the same again now.\n\n208\n00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.170\nYou've got to test that\nthe restores actually work.\n\n209\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.040\nYou can't just rely on your backups.\n\n210\n00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.850\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, earlier I had mentioned for\na hot site, I just want to make sure\n\n211\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.300\nI understand properly, because some of us,\nif we've been studying for\n\n212\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.500\nCompTIA, I want to make sure\nthat we understand those terms.\n\n213\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.930\nIs ITIL going to be asking us the\ndifference between hot sites, cold sites?\n\n214\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.370\nIs that something we should worry about?\n\n215\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.480\n&gt;&gt; That's something that we worry about at\nfoundation level to be perfectly honest.\n\n216\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're not too bothered about\n\n217\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.440\nthe terminology here,\nalthough we are gonna talk about it.\n\n218\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.510\nWe're not worried too much\nabout the terminology.\n\n219\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.260\nWhat I really need you to take\naway from this is the concept.\n\n220\n00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.910\nAnd the concept between hot sites and\nwarm sites and cold sites and\n\n221\n00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.740\nthen manual restarts, etc.\n\n222\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.765\nYeah, we going to talk about this and\n\n223\n00:12:14.765 --> 00:12:18.165\nwe're probably going to talk about\nthis in a subsequent episode.\n\n224\n00:12:18.165 --> 00:12:19.107\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But we will talk\n\n225\n00:12:19.107 --> 00:12:21.545\nabout this in a bit more detail.\n\n226\n00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:24.385\nI don't want anybody at this particular\nlevel, an intermediate level,\n\n227\n00:12:24.385 --> 00:12:28.367\nI don't want you to get too\nhung up on definitions.\n\n228\n00:12:28.367 --> 00:12:31.817\nI don't want you to get too hung\nup on the actual terminology.\n\n229\n00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:35.127\nBecause the terminology's\nright there in front of you.\n\n230\n00:12:35.127 --> 00:12:37.987\nWhat's important is that\nyou understand the concept.\n\n231\n00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:40.688\nYou see, with ITIL,\nyou would update it with a framework.\n\n232\n00:12:40.688 --> 00:12:43.420\nAnd then you adapt it to\nsuit yourself anyway.\n\n233\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.738\nSo whether you call this service\ncontinuity, or whether you call it\n\n234\n00:12:46.738 --> 00:12:50.018\ndisaster recovery, well,\nwe're gonna call it service continuity.\n\n235\n00:12:50.018 --> 00:12:51.728\nAnd I've explained the reason why.\n\n236\n00:12:51.728 --> 00:12:53.908\nBut then,\nwhen I walk in to an organization and\n\n237\n00:12:53.908 --> 00:12:57.678\nthey call it disaster recovery,\nI'm not pulling my hair out about that,\n\n238\n00:12:57.678 --> 00:13:01.448\nbecause that's your adaptation\nof service contiguity.\n\n239\n00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:07.000\nSo I don't want you to get too hung up\non the words that we use right now.\n\n240\n00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.939\nAlthough, I am gonna sort of pick you up.\n\n241\n00:13:10.939 --> 00:13:12.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If we get it wrong, but\n\n242\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.144\nthat's just me, [LAUGH] all right?\n\n243\n00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:16.517\nThat's just me.\n\n244\n00:13:16.517 --> 00:13:20.110\nSo what about then service continuity\nmanagement, what does it include?\n\n245\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.250\nWell, we've already\ntalked about all of this.\n\n246\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.380\nOngoing operation and\nmaintenance of the plan.\n\n247\n00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.990\nOne thing that I want to say, and\nI know that it's in a later slide, but\n\n248\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.950\nI'm gonna mention it anyway,\nis invocation criteria.\n\n249\n00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.040\nThe invocation criteria must be clear,\nconcise, and unambiguous.\n\n250\n00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.200\nIt has to be clear,\nconcise, and unambiguous.\n\n251\n00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.000\nYour service continuity plan should be\navailable for absolutely everybody to see.\n\n252\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.320\nBut there should be no ambiguity as\nto whether you press that big red\n\n253\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.560\nbutton or not.\n\n254\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.470\nAnd everybody within the IT\nservice provider organization\n\n255\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.900\nshould be empowered to do that.\n\n256\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.650\nYou can't always get hold of your CIO.\n\n257\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.900\nYou can't always get hold of\nsomebody with decision making power.\n\n258\n00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.170\nSo if it's in black and white, plain and\n\n259\n00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.240\nsimple, this is when you\npress the big red button.\n\n260\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.600\nIf you see a fire at the door\nof your server room,\n\n261\n00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.080\nthen you go and press that big red button.\n\n262\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.320\nAnd this is not about apportioning\nblame or pointing fingers afterwards.\n\n263\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.490\nThis is about the simple fact that\nit says here this is what I do.\n\n264\n00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.800\nWhat's the alternative?\n\n265\n00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.411\nYou let it burn, and then you try and\nfind somebody to make a decision for you?\n\n266\n00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:32.820\nNo, invocation criteria must be clear,\nconcise, and unambiguous.\n\n267\n00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.710\nAnd everyone in IT should\nbe empowered to do this.\n\n268\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.030\nEveryone.\n\n269\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.810\nNow obviously there are different\nlevels of pressing the big red button,\n\n270\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.440\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n271\n00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:49.180\nBut the simple fact is that if we've got\nservice continuity right, then there\n\n272\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.280\nis no apportioning blame, everybody's\nempowered, and everybody feels empowered.\n\n273\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.940\nThere are so\nmany organizations where people just\n\n274\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.720\nfeel a little bit too nervous\nabout doing something.\n\n275\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.907\nAnd actually the results,\nthe consequences are much worse.\n\n276\n00:15:03.656 --> 00:15:06.449\nWith part of business\ncontinuity management,\n\n277\n00:15:06.449 --> 00:15:08.435\nwe have to support the business.\n\n278\n00:15:08.435 --> 00:15:10.360\nWe've already looked at this.\n\n279\n00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.565\nSo we have to work hand in\nhand with the business.\n\n280\n00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:16.020\nWe don't do this in\nisolation from the business.\n\n281\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.900\nThis is not about what we want to do,\nit's about what the business needs, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.250\nWhat I will say, and leave the sort of\nsecond from last bullet point, it talks\n\n283\n00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:30.800\nabout the potential to deliver service at\nagreed levels independently of conditions.\n\n284\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:38.050\nI would expect to see service level\ntargets in our service level agreement for\n\n285\n00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.230\nservice continuity.\n\n286\n00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.700\nIf something happens, if there is\na disaster and we have to go off to our\n\n287\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:49.950\ndisaster recovery site, then different\nservice level targets are going to apply.\n\n288\n00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:54.768\nI don't expect everything to\nwork exactly the same, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:54.768 --> 00:16:00.079\nIf you have different service levels\nthat apply in this particular situation,\n\n290\n00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:01.434\nthen that's okay.\n\n291\n00:16:01.434 --> 00:16:07.200\nIt's not a problem Just document it and\nget it agreed with your customer.\n\n292\n00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:13.470\nIt doesn't matter what it's in your\nregular service level agreement.\n\n293\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.680\nAt that point in time,\nwe agree for a disaster.\n\n294\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.550\nIf you don't have anything in your\nSLA that covers you in the event of\n\n295\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.220\na disaster, then your regular\nservice level targets will apply.\n\n296\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:31.050\nYou might not be able to achieve those,\nso you have to be realistic about this.\n\n297\n00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.240\nNow this particular\ndiagram I absolutely love.\n\n298\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.230\nI really love this diagram.\n\n299\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:41.028\nOn this diagram, well, it shows\nthe synergy between business continuity\n\n300\n00:16:41.028 --> 00:16:46.450\nmanagement here on the left and IT service\ncontinuity management here on the right.\n\n301\n00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.884\nWe gonna go through all of these\nparticular steps in a moment in the next\n\n302\n00:16:50.884 --> 00:16:51.720\nfew slides.\n\n303\n00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.653\nBut what I really wanna point\nout here are these arrows.\n\n304\n00:16:54.653 --> 00:16:57.579\nThese arrows are by directional.\n\n305\n00:16:57.579 --> 00:16:59.530\nThey work both ways.\n\n306\n00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:00.950\nWhy do they work both ways?\n\n307\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.910\nBecause the business give\nus their requirements, but\n\n308\n00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.480\nwe will always influence the business.\n\n309\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.560\nWe'll tell them what we can do for them.\n\n310\n00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.800\nThe business will tell us, and\nI've advised in previous episodes and\n\n311\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.840\nin previous processes, I have advised\nthat we will have a priority list for\n\n312\n00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.000\nour services.\n\n313\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.554\nNow, our email service, and in fact, when\nwe spoke during availability management\n\n314\n00:17:25.554 --> 00:17:28.037\nepisodes, I talked about\nus here at ITProTV.\n\n315\n00:17:28.037 --> 00:17:33.003\nAnd I said that our vital business\nfunction is to record quality\n\n316\n00:17:33.003 --> 00:17:34.510\nonline training.\n\n317\n00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.260\nThat's what we need to do.\n\n318\n00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:42.250\nAnd then we kind of have a secondary VBF\nwhere we stream live online training.\n\n319\n00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.440\nAnd then we have other services as well.\n\n320\n00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.706\nWe have an email service.\n\n321\n00:17:46.706 --> 00:17:49.880\nAnd so\nwe might prioritize all of our services.\n\n322\n00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.104\nAnd so, in this instance, we'd prioritize\nour recording as number one and\n\n323\n00:17:54.104 --> 00:17:55.759\nour streaming as number two.\n\n324\n00:17:55.759 --> 00:17:58.150\nAnd maybe our emails\nservice as number three.\n\n325\n00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:02.432\nBut let's say that there was a disaster.\n\n326\n00:18:02.432 --> 00:18:07.033\nAnd if there is disaster and\nNate, our, well-\n\n327\n00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:07.607\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] He's an IT guy.\n\n328\n00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:09.403\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's our guru,\nyeah, he really is.\n\n329\n00:18:09.403 --> 00:18:11.890\nYeah, he's the guy that knows everything.\n\n330\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.650\nThen let's just say that Nate turns\naround and says, you know what?\n\n331\n00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:19.390\nOkay, it's gonna be more difficult for\nus to get the studios back up and running.\n\n332\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.533\nAnd that's gonna take us\na couple of hours, but\n\n333\n00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.470\nI can get email up\nrunning in five minutes.\n\n334\n00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.817\nSo should I do that?\n\n335\n00:18:25.817 --> 00:18:27.109\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n336\n00:18:27.109 --> 00:18:31.120\nAnd this is why these arrows, the arrows\nthat go down the middle are, well,\n\n337\n00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.574\nthey're bidirectional.\n\n338\n00:18:32.574 --> 00:18:36.120\nBecause we can advise on what we can do.\n\n339\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.020\nThere is no way that me, with my common\nsense hat on, will turn around and\n\n340\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.990\nsay, no, don't bother with email.\n\n341\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.120\nIf it's only gonna take five minutes\nto recover, then yeah, sure,\n\n342\n00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.870\nbother with email.\n\n343\n00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.730\nBecause at least we've got some form of\ncommunication with people to let them know\n\n344\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.430\nwhat's going on, okay?\n\n345\n00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.700\nSo the arrows of every single\nstep are bidirectional.\n\n346\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.960\nAnd then down in this bottom left-hand\ncorner, we have our invocation and\n\n347\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.400\nour continuity event.\n\n348\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.145\nYou'll notice that actually this\nsits on the side of the business.\n\n349\n00:19:04.145 --> 00:19:07.590\nCuz the business will decide\nwhat is constituted or\n\n350\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.010\nwhat is considered a disaster or not.\n\n351\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:17.110\nAgain, we'll advise, but the business will\ndecide what is considered a disaster.\n\n352\n00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.860\nIt's not down to us to consider that.\n\n353\n00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.810\nIt's a bit like a priority one incident.\n\n354\n00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.280\nThe business decides and it's agreed\non our service level agreements,\n\n355\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.310\nthe business decides what\nconstitutes priority one.\n\n356\n00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.760\nIt's not down to us.\n\n357\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.062\nWe don't agree this.\n\n358\n00:19:33.062 --> 00:19:36.301\nSo let's take a look then\nthrough each of these steps.\n\n359\n00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:41.025\nSo our first step there, then,\nin the top there is our policy setting and\n\n360\n00:19:41.025 --> 00:19:44.350\nthe scope of\nService Continuity Management.\n\n361\n00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:48.950\nSo here we have, then, well, the scope\nof Service Continuity Management.\n\n362\n00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.120\nAnd it talks about a lifecycle approach.\n\n363\n00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.006\nIn other words, we decide in strategy\nthat we're going to implement\n\n364\n00:19:55.006 --> 00:19:59.904\nService Continuity Management, and then\nwe design Service Continuity Management.\n\n365\n00:19:59.904 --> 00:20:04.040\nAnd then we transition it and\nthen it's live operation, and\n\n366\n00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.890\nthen we test it on\na regular basis as well.\n\n367\n00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.890\nThe service continuity\nplan should be current.\n\n368\n00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.261\nAnd of course, it should be aligned\nwith the organization, most definitely.\n\n369\n00:20:18.261 --> 00:20:22.284\nWhere should your service\ncontinuity plan be kept?\n\n370\n00:20:22.284 --> 00:20:25.761\n&gt;&gt; Some centralized location,\nand not on-site,\n\n371\n00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:28.229\nin the building that just blew up.\n\n372\n00:20:28.229 --> 00:20:30.863\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] okay, off site.\n\n373\n00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:32.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's the obvious place.\n\n374\n00:20:32.786 --> 00:20:37.619\nIt's the obvious place, but\nyou'll be surprised how many places it's,\n\n375\n00:20:37.619 --> 00:20:40.080\nyeah, it actually get on site.\n\n376\n00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.380\nYou had me a little bit worried there when\nyou mentioned the centralized location.\n\n377\n00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.363\nI'm thinking to myself, no,\nplease don't go down that road, Cherokee.\n\n378\n00:20:46.363 --> 00:20:49.027\n&gt;&gt; We just don't want one person\nto have access to it as well.\n\n379\n00:20:49.027 --> 00:20:53.131\nBecause what if that one person\nunfortunately was involved in some kind of\n\n380\n00:20:53.131 --> 00:20:53.810\ndisaster?\n\n381\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.496\n&gt;&gt; We've got Cloud technology now.\n\n382\n00:20:56.496 --> 00:21:02.375\nAnd so I would always recommend that you\nkeep your service continuity plan and\n\n383\n00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:06.725\nall of the details to the procedure,\netc, in the Cloud.\n\n384\n00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.560\nKeep them offsite somewhere.\n\n385\n00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.603\nNow, previously, and certainly with a lot\nof secure locations, government locations,\n\n386\n00:21:13.603 --> 00:21:18.398\netc., this type of thing might be kept on,\nsay, USB sticks, encrypted USB sticks.\n\n387\n00:21:18.398 --> 00:21:23.311\nI've known one location that\nwas a highly secure location.\n\n388\n00:21:23.311 --> 00:21:28.042\nAnd what happened was every single month,\nevery single employee within IT,\n\n389\n00:21:28.042 --> 00:21:32.220\nwithin the service provider,\nwas given a color-coded USB stick.\n\n390\n00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:38.150\nAnd depending on what month it was, then\nthere was a different colored USB stick.\n\n391\n00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.100\nAnd that was updated on a regular basis,\nso\n\n392\n00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.050\nevery single month there\nwas a new plan released.\n\n393\n00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.230\nNothing wrong with that.\n\n394\n00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:48.110\nI don't know how you're going to do this,\njust do it.\n\n395\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.570\nThat's [LAUGH] what I'd say.\n\n396\n00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.140\nEverybody should be aware\nof service continuity and\n\n397\n00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.930\neverybody should be aware of what to\ndo in cases of service continuity.\n\n398\n00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.920\nIf you want to have something like\na calling tree, then have a calling tree.\n\n399\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.865\nWhere one person calls two people and\neach of those call another two people,\n\n400\n00:22:06.865 --> 00:22:08.494\netc., etc., etc..\n\n401\n00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:09.483\nIt's entirely up to you.\n\n402\n00:22:09.483 --> 00:22:12.470\nIt really is down to you how you do this.\n\n403\n00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.880\nBut again, the organization needs\nto be involved in this as well,\n\n404\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.550\nbecause we need to\nsupport the organization.\n\n405\n00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:23.110\nThere are some very, very clear instances\nthat are considered to be a disaster, and\n\n406\n00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.330\nthere are some that aren't so clear.\n\n407\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.810\nAnd this is why our invocation\ncriteria has to be very clear.\n\n408\n00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:34.840\nI was working at one site in the UK\nthat was in the same vicinity and\n\n409\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.992\nthe same road as an oil refinery plant.\n\n410\n00:22:37.992 --> 00:22:41.900\nAnd 6AM one Sunday morning,\nthat oil refinery plant blew up.\n\n411\n00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:48.260\nBlew a complete hole in the whole of\nthat town, to be perfectly honest.\n\n412\n00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:54.030\nAnd, yes, that was when service\ncontinuity was incredibly important.\n\n413\n00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.049\nBecause the whole of that site, well,\nthere was no site [LAUGH] after that.\n\n414\n00:22:58.049 --> 00:23:03.290\nAnd so disaster recovery was\ninvoked at 6AM that morning.\n\n415\n00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.960\nAnd we didn't need a call-in sheet cuz\nyou just turned on the news [LAUGH] and\n\n416\n00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.510\nfound that a whole town had\nbeen completely wiped out.\n\n417\n00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:14.550\nWell, almost, so\nnot everything is as clear as that.\n\n418\n00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.830\nSometimes things are a little\nbit more ambiguous,\n\n419\n00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.250\nwhich is why we say the invocation\ncriteria should be incredibly clear, and\n\n420\n00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.360\nit should have the support\nof the organization.\n\n421\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.810\nSo we perform business impact\nanalysis with the organization.\n\n422\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.420\nIf this fails, what would\nthe impact to the organization be?\n\n423\n00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.230\nAnd we produce a strategy and\nprocedures and\n\n424\n00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:41.500\npolicies based on what the organization\nwants supporting those VDFs, okay?\n\n425\n00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:44.798\nSo, here we go.\n\n426\n00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:47.010\nTake a look at this, then.\n\n427\n00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.415\nIn our next stage,\nis our Initiation stage.\n\n428\n00:23:50.415 --> 00:23:53.915\nWell, we're involved with\nthe Policy Setting, and\n\n429\n00:23:53.915 --> 00:23:56.815\nthen the Terms of Reference and\nScope and the Project.\n\n430\n00:23:56.815 --> 00:24:00.690\nAnd Allocating Resources to that project.\n\n431\n00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.019\nAnd who's going to be in\ncharge of that project, and\n\n432\n00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:06.603\nwhat sort of plans we're going to have.\n\n433\n00:24:06.603 --> 00:24:09.566\nAnd then during the requirements stage,\nthat next stage,\n\n434\n00:24:09.566 --> 00:24:12.680\nthen we're looking at\nthe Business Impact Analysis.\n\n435\n00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.060\nWell, it's up to you\nif we're talking about\n\n436\n00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.390\narticulating this in financial terms.\n\n437\n00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.920\nWe'll tell you the Business Impact\nAnalysis should normally be done in terms\n\n438\n00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.460\nof financial impact.\n\n439\n00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.571\nBut also it could.\n\n440\n00:24:25.571 --> 00:24:28.385\nWe could include time to market,\nfor instance.\n\n441\n00:24:28.385 --> 00:24:35.200\nWe could include say, achievement of\nregulations or any sort of legislation.\n\n442\n00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.769\nThat could be considered in\nthat Business Impact Analysis.\n\n443\n00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.820\nAnd then the requirements themselves.\n\n444\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.290\nOne thing that I wanna say,\nthis is a Business Impact graph.\n\n445\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:50.290\nAnd this just a very, very high level\n\n446\n00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:55.600\nlooking at sort of the impact over one\nweek, two weeks, four weeks, over time.\n\n447\n00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.640\nAnd If the impact is\ncritical in a very short\n\n448\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.920\nspace of time, then we want to try and\nprevent any risk.\n\n449\n00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.790\nWe want to try and prevent a disaster.\n\n450\n00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.600\nBut if the risk or\n\n451\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.895\nthe impact is going to be low to\nmedium over a long space of time,\n\n452\n00:25:15.895 --> 00:25:20.870\nthen maybe what we want to be considering\nis a recovery after it has happened.\n\n453\n00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.708\nThis will help you.\n\n454\n00:25:22.708 --> 00:25:27.534\nYour Business Impact Analysis will help\nyou to decide is to whether you want\n\n455\n00:25:27.534 --> 00:25:31.860\nto use continuity or\nwhether you want to use recovery.\n\n456\n00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.000\nIf it's very low impact and it's going to\nbe spread over for a long period of time,\n\n457\n00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.582\nthen you probably want to use recovery,\nas I said.\n\n458\n00:25:38.582 --> 00:25:42.066\nIf its gonna have high impact\nover a very short period of time,\n\n459\n00:25:42.066 --> 00:25:45.818\nmaybe an oil refinery blows up and\nwipes out almost an entire town,\n\n460\n00:25:45.818 --> 00:25:50.120\nthen in that case there, we probably\nwant to be trying to prevent that.\n\n461\n00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.125\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so we can focus our efforts on to\nwhere we really need to be focusing them.\n\n462\n00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:55.645\nEfforts, budget, etc.\n\n463\n00:25:55.645 --> 00:25:58.315\n&gt;&gt; RIght, yeah, exactly.\n\n464\n00:25:58.315 --> 00:26:00.935\nSo, the purpose of\nthe Business Impact Analysis really to\n\n465\n00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:02.555\nquantify that business impact.\n\n466\n00:26:02.555 --> 00:26:05.902\nSo, and as I've already said,\nwe do want to talk about money.\n\n467\n00:26:05.902 --> 00:26:11.372\nBut we also want to talk about reputation,\nand anything else such as\n\n468\n00:26:11.372 --> 00:26:14.842\npublic relations, legislation,\nregulatory requirements, etc.\n\n469\n00:26:14.842 --> 00:26:20.990\nThink about how it's going to\naffect people, because not\n\n470\n00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:25.300\nonly are we talking about loss of sales,\nbut we're talking about a lot of people\n\n471\n00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.800\nwho potentially could be sitting around\ntwiddling their thumbs and doing nothing.\n\n472\n00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.630\nAnd again, in terms of a disaster,\n\n473\n00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.390\nperhaps you could repurpose these\npeople to do something else.\n\n474\n00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:39.180\nPerhaps they could actually assist you\nin moving things over to your DR site,\n\n475\n00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.440\nor perhaps that they could be\nemployed doing something else whilst\n\n476\n00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.550\nIT are trying to get everything\nmoved over to the DR site.\n\n477\n00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.030\nThe last thing that we want is to have\na lot of people sitting around doing\n\n478\n00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.110\nnothing, because that actually\nexacerbates the business impact,\n\n479\n00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.550\nbecause then you're paying salaries\nto staff that aren't doing anything.\n\n480\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.580\nSo, and as it says on the bottom there,\n\n481\n00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.220\nassign a business recovery priority for\neach service.\n\n482\n00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.400\nAnd then we'll do a risk assessment.\n\n483\n00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.230\nNow, for further information about\nrisk assessment, I want you to\n\n484\n00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:16.140\ntake a look at\nthe Availability Management Process.\n\n485\n00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.790\nWe looked in some of the episodes\nin availability management\n\n486\n00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.260\nat risk assessment.\n\n487\n00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.330\nSo, I'm not gonna repeat myself there.\n\n488\n00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.000\nHowever, what I am gonna say is,\n\n489\n00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.310\ndraw your attention to the diagram\non the right-hand side.\n\n490\n00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:31.422\nYou'll notice that in the UK\ngovernment we like the use of wheels.\n\n491\n00:27:31.422 --> 00:27:34.726\nOr, as we would call this,\na washing machine approach.\n\n492\n00:27:34.726 --> 00:27:36.710\n&gt;&gt; A washing machine, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we use this in ITIL.\n\n493\n00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:42.000\nWe have the same type of diagram in\nITIL and we have this one in MOR.\n\n494\n00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.710\nMOR is Management of Risk and\n\n495\n00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:49.180\nit's just one example of\na Risk Management Framework.\n\n496\n00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.034\nAnd we have another example of\nMOR just displayed from another\n\n497\n00:27:54.034 --> 00:27:56.940\nangle in Availability Management.\n\n498\n00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.710\nSo, I'd like you to go back to\nAvailability Management and\n\n499\n00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.410\njust review the Risk Management\nsection there.\n\n500\n00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:07.478\nBut ultimately,\nwe have to assess the vulnerability and\n\n501\n00:28:07.478 --> 00:28:09.522\nthe likelihood of any risk.\n\n502\n00:28:09.522 --> 00:28:12.943\nAnd that will help us determine\nwhat we will do about that risk,\n\n503\n00:28:12.943 --> 00:28:15.150\nwhether we want to mitigate against it.\n\n504\n00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.690\nWhether we want to just accept it.\n\n505\n00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.130\nWhether we want to transfer it.\n\n506\n00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.550\nOr whether we want to share\nit with somebody else.\n\n507\n00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.870\nAnd then again,\nas part of our requirements, then\n\n508\n00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.090\nwe look at the Service Continuity Strategy\nwith a focus\n\n509\n00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:36.930\non Business Continuity,\nhow will we support the business.\n\n510\n00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:41.730\nThink about prevention, as well as\ndisaster recovery, as we've already said.\n\n511\n00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.090\nSo, prevention in terms of UPS,\nUninterruptible Power Supply.\n\n512\n00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.560\nYou know, fault tolerant or\nresilient systems.\n\n513\n00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.150\nRAID arrays for our disks,\nfor our servers.\n\n514\n00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.220\nThink in terms of mirroring for\nour servers as well.\n\n515\n00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.660\nThink about offsite storage.\n\n516\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:02.710\nA lot of organizations will use cloud\nnow and will use virtualization.\n\n517\n00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:07.481\nA lot of organizations will still\nuse what we call redundant systems.\n\n518\n00:29:07.481 --> 00:29:11.938\nAnd I know many, many global organizations\nhave what we call redundant data centers,\n\n519\n00:29:11.938 --> 00:29:14.808\nwhere you've got two data\ncenters In different parts of\n\n520\n00:29:14.808 --> 00:29:17.150\nthe world that are actually mirroring.\n\n521\n00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.420\nAnd they're doing full mirroring as well.\n\n522\n00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.730\nSo, they're both processing\nat exactly the same time.\n\n523\n00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.595\nObviously, that's expensive.\n\n524\n00:29:24.595 --> 00:29:27.670\nThat's not something that\nis cheap to maintain.\n\n525\n00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.180\nIt's entirely up to the organization.\n\n526\n00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:37.650\nAnd it depends on how much you want to\ninvest in service continuity, okay.\n\n527\n00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.610\nAgain, up to your organization.\n\n528\n00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.510\nSo, now let's think about\nimplementation then.\n\n529\n00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:48.658\nAnd we're just simply going through\nthat diagram that we first saw.\n\n530\n00:29:48.658 --> 00:29:51.857\nAnd the implementation of\nservice continuity well,\n\n531\n00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:56.200\nas I keep saying it's all about\nreflecting business continuity plans.\n\n532\n00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.100\nIt's more than just about recovery.\n\n533\n00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.020\nIt's also about continuing\nin the case of a disaster.\n\n534\n00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:11.960\nEven if we have continuity in place and we\nare continuing in the case of a disaster,\n\n535\n00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.320\nwe still need to be aware that\nthere has been a disaster.\n\n536\n00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.619\nWe can't just ignore that disaster, okay?\n\n537\n00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:24.790\nWe still have to acknowledge\nthat it has happened.\n\n538\n00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.230\nSo, now let's just take\na quick look at recovery then.\n\n539\n00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.230\nThis is what should be\nin your recovery plans.\n\n540\n00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.400\nI mean, it's got the usual in there.\n\n541\n00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.630\nLots of documents such as revisions,\nand a circulation list,\n\n542\n00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.988\nand as I've already said,\nclear conditions for\n\n543\n00:30:41.988 --> 00:30:48.520\nthe invocation etc.\n\n544\n00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.330\nAnd then let's take another look\nat more information in there.\n\n545\n00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.640\nWho's going to be doing what?\n\n546\n00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.170\nWhat about security?\n\n547\n00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:56.890\nWhat about sites?\n\n548\n00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.380\nHow do we get access to sites?\n\n549\n00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:04.580\nAnd the one thing that we don't wanna\nforget, how do we go back, yeah?\n\n550\n00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:09.080\nThat's something that\nneeds testing as well.\n\n551\n00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.780\nHow do we actually get\nback to our live site.\n\n552\n00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.870\nOr there's the ultimate question,\nof course,\n\n553\n00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.260\nis do we actually go\nback to our live site?\n\n554\n00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.070\n&gt;&gt; Not in the case of that oil refinery.\n\n555\n00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.670\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH] yeah,\nthere is no live site, yeah.\n\n556\n00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:23.240\nBut sometimes, if we've got live\nmirroring that's happening,\n\n557\n00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.920\nespecially across data sites,\nwe have data centers across the world,\n\n558\n00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.760\nwe might choose not to go\nback to the live site.\n\n559\n00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.440\nWe just might maintain that one now and\nthat's our live site.\n\n560\n00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.185\nAnd then, the next time something happens,\nthen we just switch over.\n\n561\n00:31:37.185 --> 00:31:39.890\nAnd again, that choice is up to you.\n\n562\n00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:43.860\n&gt;&gt; You have to plan for\nthe implementations of\n\n563\n00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.810\nyour service continuity or\nyour disaster recovery implementation.\n\n564\n00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:53.110\nIncluding things like accommodation,\ncrisis management, communication.\n\n565\n00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.976\nWhat about money?\n\n566\n00:31:53.976 --> 00:31:58.104\nIs there any money that's been put\naside to actually move stuff to another\n\n567\n00:31:58.104 --> 00:31:58.778\nlocation?\n\n568\n00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:03.570\nIf your DR site Is 100 miles away,\nyou're gonna have to pay for hotels.\n\n569\n00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.972\nAnd you're going to have\na hotel on standby as well,\n\n570\n00:32:05.972 --> 00:32:08.661\nbecause you never know when\nsomething is going to happen.\n\n571\n00:32:08.661 --> 00:32:11.861\nAnd if you have to relocate\n500 people at the last minute,\n\n572\n00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:14.330\nthen you better have a few\nhotels on your list.\n\n573\n00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.770\nAnd think about who's gonna be doing what.\n\n574\n00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:22.430\nAs I've already said, your role might\nnot exist in the case of a disaster.\n\n575\n00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:25.970\nSo you might be deployed\nto do something else.\n\n576\n00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.790\nSo think about who's going to do what.\n\n577\n00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.275\nWhat happens if you are on what\nwe call the executive team, and\n\n578\n00:32:31.275 --> 00:32:33.440\nyou're managing the migration.\n\n579\n00:32:35.612 --> 00:32:39.330\nEverybody should have very defined\nroles and responsibilities.\n\n580\n00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.460\nAnd this process should be\naudited on a regular basis.\n\n581\n00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.700\nAt least once a year we should ensure, and\n\n582\n00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.500\nafter any major change, that our\nservice continuity plans are valid.\n\n583\n00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.820\nAnd, of course, I've already mentioned, we\nshould what we call walkthrough tests and\n\n584\n00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:00.310\nwe should have full tests,\nat least once a year.\n\n585\n00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:06.140\nThat's when somebody actually presses that\nbig red button, at least once a year.\n\n586\n00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.700\nYou can have partial tests and\nyou can have scenario tests as well.\n\n587\n00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.810\nWe're not going to tell you exactly how\nyou need to do that because we can't,\n\n588\n00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.860\nevery single organization\nworks completely differently.\n\n589\n00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.993\nHowever, we will tell you that\nyou do need to undertake this.\n\n590\n00:33:21.993 --> 00:33:25.540\nAnd then don't forget change management.\n\n591\n00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.949\nChange management,\nevery time we make a major change,\n\n592\n00:33:28.949 --> 00:33:34.027\nI've already mentioned this, if you're\nupgrading your operating system, then\n\n593\n00:33:34.027 --> 00:33:38.981\nyou need to make sure that your operating\nsystem in your DR site is also upgraded.\n\n594\n00:33:38.981 --> 00:33:42.972\nAnd any changes to our\nservice continuity plans,\n\n595\n00:33:42.972 --> 00:33:47.923\nthey've also got to be managed\nby change management, okay?\n\n596\n00:33:47.923 --> 00:33:51.792\nAnd for any new service then we have\nto conduct that risk assessment as\n\n597\n00:33:51.792 --> 00:33:53.070\nwe've already said.\n\n598\n00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:59.040\nAnd then the last part to this program and\nthese next two slides in this\n\n599\n00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.640\nparticular part, that's where we're gonna\nleave it for this particular episode.\n\n600\n00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.120\nAnd that is just the ongoing\noperation of service continuity.\n\n601\n00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.280\nYou have to be aware that this could\nbe invoked at any point in time,\n\n602\n00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.940\nand that third bullet point there about\nservice continuity tends to be driven as\n\n603\n00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:20.320\na project and then forgotten about,\nthat's very, very true.\n\n604\n00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.780\nThat's exactly what happens, so we have\nto make sure that our education and\n\n605\n00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.720\nour awareness is always there.\n\n606\n00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.490\nIf you wanted to pass an ISO20000 audit,\nwhich, of course,\n\n607\n00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:33.960\nis the international standard for\nservice management, then an auditor,\n\n608\n00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.130\nsomebody like myself,\nis going to walk into your organization.\n\n609\n00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:41.890\nAnd we'll ask anybody within your service\nprovider organization where your service\n\n610\n00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:43.630\ncontinuity plans are.\n\n611\n00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:49.070\nAnd if they can't show anyone, if they\ncan't show the auditor, then you fail.\n\n612\n00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:50.460\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n613\n00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.920\nThere should be ongoing awareness.\n\n614\n00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.510\nAnd that's within the organization.\n\n615\n00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.660\nAnd I don't expect to see\nit on the Intranet either.\n\n616\n00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:02.190\nI expect to see it somewhere off-site\nin some virtual environment, perhaps.\n\n617\n00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.698\nI also expect to see testing programs,\nas well.\n\n618\n00:35:05.698 --> 00:35:11.920\nAnd I expect to see that change control\nis controlling service continuity.\n\n619\n00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:18.000\nSo as I've already said, we've now looked\nat the process for service continuity,\n\n620\n00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.690\nIT service continuity.\n\n621\n00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:21.005\nAnd in our next episode,\n\n622\n00:35:21.005 --> 00:35:25.138\nwe're going to look at those different\nrecovery options that you mentioned,\n\n623\n00:35:25.138 --> 00:35:28.914\nCherokee, and we're going to be\nlooking at some of that terminology.\n\n624\n00:35:28.914 --> 00:35:31.304\nBut for now what I'd like you to do,\n\n625\n00:35:31.304 --> 00:35:35.340\nis I'd like you just to recap\nover the process itself.\n\n626\n00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.520\nLook at the stages within the process.\n\n627\n00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.527\nThere is an exercise in your downloadable\nmaterial which should take you around\n\n628\n00:35:41.527 --> 00:35:42.619\nabout 30 minutes.\n\n629\n00:35:42.619 --> 00:35:46.730\nAnd if you have any questions as per\nusual we are available on the forum.\n\n630\n00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:51.990\nAnd I will do as much as I can within my\npower to help any questions you may have.\n\n631\n00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.880\n&gt;&gt; Perfect Jo, thank you so much.\n\n632\n00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.920\nBut when it comes to IT service continuity\nmanagement, we're not quite finished yet.\n\n633\n00:35:57.920

00:00:08.424\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.424 --> 00:00:12.176\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:15.095\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL intermediate\nseries, I'm your show host,\n\n6\n00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:16.460\nCherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.910\nIn the last episode, Jo introduced us to\nour IT service continuity management.\n\n8\n00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.270\nIn this episode,\nwe'll continue taking a look at that, and\n\n9\n00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.130\nshe's back in studios with us today.\n\n10\n00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.890\nThank you for joining us, Jo, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm fine, thank you Cherokee,\nhow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.250\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\nI'm excited to keep the momentum here,\n\n13\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.300\nbecause you've given us\na lot to think about.\n\n14\n00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.420\nIn case of a disaster, and how we can\neven maintain that continuity there.\n\n15\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.110\nSo what are we going to be\nlooking at first here today, Jo?\n\n16\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.559\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're actually going to do,\nat the beginning of our last episode,\n\n17\n00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.060\nyou mentioned some terminology.\n\n18\n00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.134\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n19\n00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:50.330\n&gt;&gt; And so now,\nwe're gonna go over our recovery options.\n\n20\n00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.770\nAnd we're just actually gonna go\nover the terminology that we use\n\n21\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.260\nin service continuity.\n\n22\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.930\nWe're gonna be doing that, and\nthen we're going to look at the inputs and\n\n23\n00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.660\noutputs to service continuity.\n\n24\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.510\nAlthough, to be honest, we covered\na lot of that in our last episode.\n\n25\n00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.963\nAnd you know what, service continuity is\nour third warranty process that we've\n\n26\n00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:11.790\nlooked at in this particular\nservice design show.\n\n27\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.610\nSo the same principles\napply to all of them,\n\n28\n00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.130\nreally, in that we've got to be hand in\nhand with the needs of the organization.\n\n29\n00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.279\nAnd we've gotta look at the warranty\nlevels that are required by\n\n30\n00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:24.281\nthe organization.\n\n31\n00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:31.536\nSo everything in service continuity is\nmatched to the needs of the organization.\n\n32\n00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:36.740\nIt's really what they want to see,\nand what they need us to provide.\n\n33\n00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.810\nSo let's take a look at our\nrecovery options, then,\n\n34\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.510\nand we're gonna get straight into it.\n\n35\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.785\nAnd the first one is a manual workaround,\n\n36\n00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:47.525\n[LAUGH] be surprised how\nmany people still do this.\n\n37\n00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:52.124\n&gt;&gt; Jo, I was at a gas station one time,\nand their computer systems went down,\n\n38\n00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:54.899\nso I had to stay there\nuntil they came back up.\n\n39\n00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.058\n&gt;&gt; Great [LAUGH].\n\n40\n00:01:57.058 --> 00:01:58.192\n&gt;&gt; I mean, you think about it, but\n\n41\n00:01:58.192 --> 00:02:00.844\na lot of companies just really aren't\nprepared to deal with this anymore.\n\n42\n00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:04.034\n&gt;&gt; No, and a lot of companies just do\nnot think about service continuity,\n\n43\n00:02:04.034 --> 00:02:05.429\nthey really, really don't.\n\n44\n00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.079\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I mean to be perfectly honest,\n\n45\n00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.618\nif somebody had said to me,\nyou're gonna stay here.\n\n46\n00:02:10.618 --> 00:02:12.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'd be saying, do you know what,\n\n47\n00:02:12.748 --> 00:02:14.410\nyou need to call the police,\ncuz I'm leaving.\n\n48\n00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.750\n[LAUGH] There is no way that\nI would just stay there.\n\n49\n00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.500\nBut this is a problem,\na lot of people don't think about this.\n\n50\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.620\nThere are a lot of independent shops,\nfor instance, independent stores,\n\n51\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.880\nwhere we rely so\nmuch on our credit cards now.\n\n52\n00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.080\nWell, you know what, that's IT,\nit's IT that manages that,\n\n53\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.889\nand when it doesn't work,\nthey don't know what to do.\n\n54\n00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.654\nIn that instance,\nthey just don't know what to do.\n\n55\n00:02:38.654 --> 00:02:43.887\nYou see, a manual recovery, it just\nsimply involves getting the paper out,\n\n56\n00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:46.970\nand I've seen a lot of\nservice desks do this.\n\n57\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.620\nOkay then,\n\n58\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.350\nwell, if the service desk call login goes\ndown, we'll get our Excel spreadsheet.\n\n59\n00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.970\nWhich is absolutely great, but\n\n60\n00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.930\nthen you've gotta input that information\nback into the call logging system.\n\n61\n00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.410\nAnd so, it actually does require\nnot just higher levels of staff,\n\n62\n00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.170\nbecause you're doing things manually, but\n\n63\n00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.100\nit also requires a lot more\nintervention in the long run.\n\n64\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.530\nBecause all of that information's gotta\nbe put into your systems when you\n\n65\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.950\ncome back up.\n\n66\n00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.680\nThat's not to say that we should\neliminate it, it is a valid option for\n\n67\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.160\nsome organizations, and\nthink about this in terms of scale.\n\n68\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.130\nThe smaller organizations are more\nlikely to do something like this.\n\n69\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.590\nIf this doesn't happen right now,\nif something's not working right now,\n\n70\n00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.540\nI'm just going to write it down for\nthe moment, and\n\n71\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.459\nI'll pick up the pieces\na little bit later.\n\n72\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.635\nWe all do that,\nwe do that in our day to day world, so\n\n73\n00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:43.458\nwe all have some form of manual workaround\nwhen something doesn't quite work.\n\n74\n00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:48.039\nBut in a large scale, international\norganizations, I expect them to have\n\n75\n00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:53.790\na little bit more sophisticated disaster\nrecovery than just a manual recovery.\n\n76\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.015\nSo then we have, now, and this is an\ninteresting one, I really love this one,\n\n77\n00:03:58.015 --> 00:03:59.755\nthe reciprocal arrangements.\n\n78\n00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:03.590\nA reciprocal arrangement is where\nwe go of to a partner site,\n\n79\n00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.558\nsometimes a competitor's site, and\nuse a portion of their infrastructure,\n\n80\n00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:11.190\nin the case of a disaster.\n\n81\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.903\n&gt;&gt; So what are we reciprocating?\n\n82\n00:04:12.903 --> 00:04:17.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's exactly what we're\nreciprocating, our infrastructure.\n\n83\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.200\nSo in a reciprocal arrangement, a partner\nsite, or maybe even a competitor,\n\n84\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.912\nit's somebody that performs\na similar function to you.\n\n85\n00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:29.244\nAnd therefore their infrastructure\nis set up in a similar way to you.\n\n86\n00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:32.822\nAnd they will dedicate a portion of\ntheir infrastructure to you if you have\n\n87\n00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:33.467\na disaster.\n\n88\n00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:36.035\nAnd you will do exactly-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n89\n00:04:36.035 --> 00:04:37.422\nthat's what we're reciprocating,\nthe sharing.\n\n90\n00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:39.713\nIf it happens to you,\nthen I'll help you out.\n\n91\n00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:44.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, you scratch my back and I'll\nscratch yours, that's exactly what it is.\n\n92\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.429\nI get a lot of people that will say to me,\nwhen would you ever use that?\n\n93\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.800\nIt's more common than you think,\nand in fact,\n\n94\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.570\nit's used in a lot of\ngovernment departments and\n\n95\n00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.760\na lot of government agencies, where\na reciprocal arrangement works perfectly.\n\n96\n00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.040\nWhere you've got two opposing,\npotentially,\n\n97\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.580\ngovernment agencies,\ngovernment departments.\n\n98\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.340\nWell, they both need to be equally\nas secure, in which case, then,\n\n99\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.540\nit makes sense to move off to\nthe other department's live\n\n100\n00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.890\noperating environment, as a disaster\nrecovery site for another one.\n\n101\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.060\nBecause we already have all of\nthe security requirements, etc, in place.\n\n102\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.270\nSo it does make more sense, and it does\nwork, it works really, really well.\n\n103\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.550\nAnd you know what, it's fairly cheap,\nwe don't have to pay for an expensive\n\n104\n00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.760\ndisasters recovery site to so sort of\nsit there and keep warm, as it were.\n\n105\n00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.118\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nkind of co-oping with that other entity.\n\n106\n00:05:39.118 --> 00:05:40.787\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly that,\n\n107\n00:05:40.787 --> 00:05:46.087\nthen we also have what we cold\nthe call standby or gradual recovery.\n\n108\n00:05:46.087 --> 00:05:51.587\nAnd a gradual recovery is a recovery\nwhere we gradually bring back\n\n109\n00:05:51.587 --> 00:05:59.000\nour services into a live operating\nenvironment, within, well, 72+ hours.\n\n110\n00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.536\nSo you're talking about sort of four days,\nsimple as that, three to four days.\n\n111\n00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:07.396\nGenerally, what you would have,\nin this particular instance,\n\n112\n00:06:07.396 --> 00:06:09.610\nis that you would have an empty site.\n\n113\n00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.070\nIt'd have power and\nit would have sort of the cabling, and\n\n114\n00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.700\nit would have the telecommunications,\nbut nothing is live.\n\n115\n00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.397\nSo what we'll do is, we move over\nto the disaster recovery site, and\n\n116\n00:06:20.397 --> 00:06:24.571\nwe turn up with our truck full of tapes,\nand we start loading them in.\n\n117\n00:06:24.571 --> 00:06:27.820\nAnd it'll take three to four days for\neverything to come back online.\n\n118\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.726\nThat's what we call a cold standby,\nor gradual recovery.\n\n119\n00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:36.550\nWhereas an intermediate recovery,\nwhich is a warm standby,\n\n120\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.610\nthat's something that we consider\nthat we have between 24 and 72 hours.\n\n121\n00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.260\nSo what we've got is a site\nthat's got all of the equipment,\n\n122\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.290\nit's got all of the facilities in place.\n\n123\n00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.840\nIt's got all of the cablings,\nit's got all of the network,\n\n124\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.648\nit's got all of the telecommunications.\n\n125\n00:06:55.648 --> 00:07:00.527\nBut it's also got all of the servers,\nand they're all kept updated,\n\n126\n00:07:00.527 --> 00:07:05.170\nand therefore what we need to do\nis to simply restore from backups.\n\n127\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.053\nYou can use a shared facility for this,\nand quite often, an organization,\n\n128\n00:07:11.053 --> 00:07:14.928\nwhen we're looking for one standby,\nwe use a partner company.\n\n129\n00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:15.699\nAnd we'll use,\n\n130\n00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:19.460\nthere are a lot of companies around that\nactually provide this type of facility.\n\n131\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:26.113\nWhere they provide an empty office,\nas it were, with PCs, etc, all ready.\n\n132\n00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:30.140\nAnd all we need to do is just simply\nturn up and plug in our tapes.\n\n133\n00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.788\nThere's a big problem with that, and\n\n134\n00:07:32.788 --> 00:07:37.837\nthat is if you are sharing that facility\nwith many other customers, many\n\n135\n00:07:37.837 --> 00:07:42.245\nother clients of that particular provider-\n&gt;&gt; If it was a large disaster,\n\n136\n00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:43.869\nthey might need it as well, right?\n\n137\n00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:46.715\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, somebody else might need\nit, another one of their clients might\n\n138\n00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:48.440\nneed the site, and so-\n&gt;&gt; How do they deal with that?\n\n139\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:48.976\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n140\n00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:50.527\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the problem, is that, and\n\n141\n00:07:50.527 --> 00:07:52.675\nthis is why I said,\nthere's a big problem with this.\n\n142\n00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:56.990\nIf you're using an external provider\nto maintain the site for you,\n\n143\n00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.878\nyou're kinda paying an insurance company.\n\n144\n00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:02.893\nBut you're kind of paying\nan insurance policy for\n\n145\n00:08:02.893 --> 00:08:07.140\na rental car that might not necessarily\nbe available when you need it.\n\n146\n00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.023\nAnd so there is a danger,\nthere is a risk to that, but\n\n147\n00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:15.216\nyou know what with service continuity we\nperform risk assessment anyway and so\n\n148\n00:08:15.216 --> 00:08:18.800\nI'd expect that you'd\nperform your risk assessment.\n\n149\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.890\nAnd then we've got our fast recovery.\n\n150\n00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.950\nNow, this is also known as hot standby.\n\n151\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.140\nAnd a hot standby is within 24 hours.\n\n152\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.740\nSo it requires everything to be up and\nrunning within those 24 hours.\n\n153\n00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.880\nAgain, this can be outsourced,\nnothing wrong with that.\n\n154\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.400\nBut again,\n\n155\n00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.920\nyou're gonna have to perform the risk\nmanagement in order to make that decision.\n\n156\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.940\nAnd then think about\nthe continuity management,\n\n157\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:50.605\nwhich is maintaining the services, as\nopposed to the disaster recovery as well.\n\n158\n00:08:50.605 --> 00:08:57.215\nSo in a fast recovery, what do you\nwant to keep in that recovery site?\n\n159\n00:08:57.215 --> 00:08:58.475\nDo you want to mirror?\n\n160\n00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:01.810\nIf you do, then that would be\nwhat we call immediate recovery.\n\n161\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.650\nOkay, so think about this.\n\n162\n00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.720\nOkay, think about what your options are,\nand again, business impact analysis and\n\n163\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.240\nrisk assessment will\nactually help you with this.\n\n164\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:10.840\nNow, of course,\n\n165\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.520\nCherokee, that was what you were talking\nabout earlier on with your CompTIA.\n\n166\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; This was your hot standby which was\n\n167\n00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.370\nthe under 24 hours.\n\n168\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n169\n00:09:19.535 --> 00:09:23.470\nAnd we also have this immediate recovery.\n\n170\n00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.220\nAn immediate recovery is the standby,\nin other words,\n\n171\n00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.060\nit's a split site,\nits continuous operation.\n\n172\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.650\n&gt;&gt; Sounds expensive, Jo.\n\n173\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.740\n&gt;&gt; Very, very e expensive.\n\n174\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.808\nA lot of large organizations are\ninternational organizations will use this.\n\n175\n00:09:39.808 --> 00:09:43.970\nNowadays of course, we're moving\nto cloud and to virtualization and\n\n176\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.145\nactually this is not as\nexpensive as it used to be.\n\n177\n00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:49.635\nMany years ago,\nI mean well say many years ago,\n\n178\n00:09:49.635 --> 00:09:54.095\nI think about sort of even just as\nfrequently, or as recently as five,\n\n179\n00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:58.375\nten years ago, then cloud wasn't really\nan option for a lot of organizations.\n\n180\n00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:01.645\nAnd you still have to consider security\nwhen you're thinking about cloud and\n\n181\n00:10:01.645 --> 00:10:04.285\nwhen you're thinking about virtualization.\n\n182\n00:10:04.285 --> 00:10:07.595\nBut this is still the real world for\na lot of organizations,\n\n183\n00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:09.165\nespecially the international ones.\n\n184\n00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.877\nSo these are our recovery options just\nthink about our vital business functions\n\n185\n00:10:15.877 --> 00:10:20.432\nand think about what I've mentioned in\nthat first episode when we looked at\n\n186\n00:10:20.432 --> 00:10:25.294\nservice continuity management that your\nvital business function may change.\n\n187\n00:10:25.294 --> 00:10:30.360\nIn the conditions of a disaster,\nthey may change.\n\n188\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.880\nSo we have to think about this.\n\n189\n00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.400\nInvocation is kind of the ultimate\ntest of our service continuity plan.\n\n190\n00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.220\nIt's something that we\nhope we never have to do.\n\n191\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.630\nBut you do have to bear in mind\nthat invocation may happen at any\n\n192\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.110\npoint in time, during the day,\nduring the week, during the year.\n\n193\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.030\nIt could happen in your major holidays.\n\n194\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.660\nIt could happen at 7 AM\non Christmas morning\n\n195\n00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.740\nwhen you want to be sitting at home with\nthe kids opening presents, for instance.\n\n196\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.450\nInvocation can happen\nat any point in time.\n\n197\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.020\nAnd as I mentioned in our first episode\nwhen we looked at service continuity\n\n198\n00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.330\nmanagement, I need you to\nensure that in your service\n\n199\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.750\ncontinuity plans you are invocation\ncriteria is very, very explicit.\n\n200\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.970\nIt's clear, concise and its unambiguous.\n\n201\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:24.600\nAnd the fact is that you may use to help\nyou decide what would be considered or\n\n202\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.160\nwhere we would need invocation would\nbe the extent to the damage and\n\n203\n00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.620\nthe impacts,\nthe disruption to the organization.\n\n204\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.060\nYou may even consider the day,\ntime and months, of the year as well.\n\n205\n00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.680\nJust bear in mind that if you're an\ninternational organization, then the day,\n\n206\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.280\ntime, months and year, it's gonna vary\ndepending on what site you're at.\n\n207\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.220\nAnd things like holidays,\npublic holidays, we can't take for\n\n208\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.920\ngranted are the same public holiday all\nyear round and for every single country.\n\n209\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.900\nSome public holidays even change dates,\netc, as well.\n\n210\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.050\nSo invocation criteria has gotta\nbe flexible enough to be able to\n\n211\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.820\naccommodate that.\n\n212\n00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.530\nBut it also has to be rigid enough that\nit's completely unambiguous, that there\n\n213\n00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:13.000\nshould be no doubt as to whether we\npress the big red button or not.\n\n214\n00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.560\nWho should have access to our\nservice continuity plans?\n\n215\n00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.520\n&gt;&gt; It should be limited Jo.\n\n216\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.260\n&gt;&gt; It should be limited?\n\n217\n00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.302\nTo who?\n\n218\n00:12:21.302 --> 00:12:25.389\n&gt;&gt; Well I guess that depends on\nwhat your organization decides,\n\n219\n00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:27.432\nbecause what if like you said,\n\n220\n00:12:27.432 --> 00:12:32.874\nyou want to maintain that security through\nthis in a very sensitive process here.\n\n221\n00:12:32.874 --> 00:12:36.430\nSo I don't think I would want\neveryone knowing exactly my\n\n222\n00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.820\nmost vital business functions\nof my organization.\n\n223\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.450\nIf I wanna protect that from\nany kind of competitors,\n\n224\n00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.350\nI don't want it out as public knowledge.\n\n225\n00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.330\nBut I also wanna make sure that\nthere is that hierarchy available.\n\n226\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.890\nSo that if Cherokee isn't here to\nhelp explain what needs to happen,\n\n227\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.820\nJo's still here and\nshe has access as well.\n\n228\n00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, the short answer is everybody\nshould have access to your service\n\n229\n00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.340\ncontinuity plan.\n\n230\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.280\n&gt;&gt; Even the public?\n\n231\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.700\n&gt;&gt; Everybody should have access\nto your service continuity plan.\n\n232\n00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.450\nHowever, access should be controlled.\n\n233\n00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n234\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.680\n&gt;&gt; So we're talking about\nusing user profiles, etc.\n\n235\n00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.250\nBecause if something happens and\nwe're invoking service continuity,\n\n236\n00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.400\nif you've got external customers that\nare relying on you to deliver something at\n\n237\n00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.230\na certain point in time, then, yes,\neven the public, they need to know.\n\n238\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That actually this is not happening.\n\n239\n00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.920\nWe're in a disaster situation and\ntherefore the following applies.\n\n240\n00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.330\nSo everybody should have access\nto the service continuity plan.\n\n241\n00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.590\n&gt;&gt; To some degree.\n\n242\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.830\n&gt;&gt; Right, the details of what\nthey have access to should\n\n243\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.100\nbe tightly controlled\nby access management.\n\n244\n00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.280\nYou're right, definitely,\nin that particular instance.\n\n245\n00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.660\nWe should all know what's expected of us.\n\n246\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.780\nAnd this is part of\nthe communication plan.\n\n247\n00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.010\nWho we're communicating to,\nhow we're communicating and\n\n248\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.750\nwhat message we're communicating as well.\n\n249\n00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.355\nSo think about in your invocation.\n\n250\n00:13:56.355 --> 00:13:57.705\nAnd I love this one.\n\n251\n00:13:57.705 --> 00:14:01.675\nThe retrieval of your backup media and\nessential documentation.\n\n252\n00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.815\nWhere are your backup tapes?\n\n253\n00:14:03.815 --> 00:14:05.925\nWho?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, Jo, where'd you put them?\n\n254\n00:14:05.925 --> 00:14:06.755\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWho's gonna?\n\n255\n00:14:06.755 --> 00:14:08.855\n&gt;&gt; Now's not the time to\nbe thinking about that.\n\n256\n00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:09.515\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n257\n00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:12.126\nAnd who's gonna go and get them?\n\n258\n00:14:12.126 --> 00:14:13.181\n&gt;&gt; Do you have a car?\n\n259\n00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:16.926\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, I do with me right now,\nbut it's gonna rain today and\n\n260\n00:14:16.926 --> 00:14:18.845\nit might get wet cuz it's a truck.\n\n261\n00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.670\nYeah, do you know, it's funny how often\nthat one's overlooked [LAUGH] and\n\n262\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.540\nthat one always makes me smile.\n\n263\n00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.765\nIs that we've got a contract with somebody\nto actually take our backup tapes and take\n\n264\n00:14:30.765 --> 00:14:35.637\nthem off-site and keep them in a secure\ncontainer or in a secure environment.\n\n265\n00:14:35.637 --> 00:14:39.996\nBut then we don't have a contract with\nthat same person to bring them back or\n\n266\n00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:44.230\nbring them over to our disaster recovery\nsite should we have a disaster.\n\n267\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.440\nYou gotta think about this, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.850\nIt's gotta be part of your\nservice continuity plans.\n\n269\n00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.346\nIt's no good taking a backup and\nthen just hiding it away somewhere and\n\n270\n00:14:52.346 --> 00:14:53.459\nnot knowing what to do with it.\n\n271\n00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.181\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nit's just a waste of money.\n\n272\n00:14:55.181 --> 00:14:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nthink about who's going to do what.\n\n273\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.030\nAnd think about who's going to go where.\n\n274\n00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.610\nIf you got a disaster recovery site and\nif it's a few hundred miles away,\n\n275\n00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.100\nthen who's gonna go there and\nwho's gonna stay behind.\n\n276\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:15.100\nAnd what about, I gave the example in\nprevious episode of a site where I worked\n\n277\n00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.541\nwhich was adjacent to an oil refinery\nwhich just happened to blow up and\n\n278\n00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:22.910\nwipe out half a town one\nSunday morning at 6 AM.\n\n279\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.080\nIn that instance,\n\n280\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.390\nwhose gonna stay behind isn't really\nan option because to be perfectly honest\n\n281\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.320\nnobody needs to stay behind cuz\nthere is no way to stay behind too.\n\n282\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.710\n&gt;&gt; Right and\nyou've looked at instances like Fukushima,\n\n283\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:41.000\nlike no one is gonna stay around\nwith nuclear radiation and so.\n\n284\n00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.640\n&gt;&gt; Exactly exactly.\n\n285\n00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.410\nSo think about communication and\n\n286\n00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.453\nthe fact that you can't\npredict every single instance.\n\n287\n00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:51.774\nYou cannot prepare for\nabsolutely everything, but\n\n288\n00:15:51.774 --> 00:15:55.602\nnobody should be in any\nstate of frustration or\n\n289\n00:15:55.602 --> 00:15:59.645\nany state of confusion as\nto what they should do.\n\n290\n00:15:59.645 --> 00:16:01.480\nOkay, this has happened.\n\n291\n00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.479\nWe didn't preempt this in our\nservice continuity plans, but\n\n292\n00:16:04.479 --> 00:16:08.710\nwe should still know what to do because\nthe buildings are no longer available.\n\n293\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:12.860\nAnd so you'd actually use phrases like\nif your building is no longer available,\n\n294\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.370\nthen you go here.\n\n295\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.700\nYou're not actually using words like if\nthe oil refinery next door happens to\n\n296\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.520\nblow up, then this is what you do.\n\n297\n00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.140\nBut we should use generic phrases, but\n\n298\n00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:28.010\nthey should still be precise enough for\nus to be able to do something about it.\n\n299\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.967\nSo this particular diagram, or this\nparticular slide, I always really like.\n\n300\n00:16:33.967 --> 00:16:36.155\nI always start up with my triggers and\n\n301\n00:16:36.155 --> 00:16:39.128\nwhat starts off service\ncontinuity management.\n\n302\n00:16:39.128 --> 00:16:43.716\nWell, I've already mentioned in\navailability management and capacity\n\n303\n00:16:43.716 --> 00:16:48.830\nmanagement, we've got exactly the same\ncriteria that starts off this process.\n\n304\n00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.510\nAnd that is newer change services,\nnew targets,\n\n305\n00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:57.768\nany major incident if something's\ngone wrong, lessons learned, and\n\n306\n00:16:57.768 --> 00:17:03.131\nservice continuity and CSI,\nContinual Service Improvement.\n\n307\n00:17:03.131 --> 00:17:07.910\nThese will all start\noff service continuity.\n\n308\n00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.020\nAnd when I say start\noff service continuity,\n\n309\n00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:15.580\nI don't mean that these are all\nconsidered to be invocation criteria, no.\n\n310\n00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:20.124\nThese all start service continuity into\neither reviewing existing plans or\n\n311\n00:17:20.124 --> 00:17:21.409\ncreating new plans.\n\n312\n00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:25.096\nIncluding things like periodic\nbusiness impact analysis, or\n\n313\n00:17:25.096 --> 00:17:30.043\nchanges in direction from organization and\nchanges rights or business functions.\n\n314\n00:17:30.043 --> 00:17:35.100\nThese sort of changes will come in\nthrough business relationship management.\n\n315\n00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.310\nSo, all of that, well,\nwe'll consider those to be inputs.\n\n316\n00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.073\nAnd like availability management and\n\n317\n00:17:41.073 --> 00:17:45.151\ncapacity management that we've already\ncovered, we've got business information,\n\n318\n00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:49.330\nwe've got patterns of business activity,\nwe've got vital business functions.\n\n319\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.928\nThey should all be inputs.\n\n320\n00:17:50.928 --> 00:17:53.474\nAnd of course, another major input, and\n\n321\n00:17:53.474 --> 00:17:58.202\nits number five in this process as well\nas it is in availability management and\n\n322\n00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:01.930\ncapacity management,\nit's that financial information.\n\n323\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:06.880\nHow much money have we got to\nspend in service continuity?\n\n324\n00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.440\nObviously that's gonna play a big part.\n\n325\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.650\nIf we don't have the money to\nhave to have a hot standby,\n\n326\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.120\nthen we're not going to\nhave a mirrored site.\n\n327\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.190\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n328\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.020\nWe've got to be able to pay for it.\n\n329\n00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.990\nAnd the outputs then,\nwell, are a policy and\n\n330\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:25.700\na revised policy if we've already got one,\nbusiness impact analysis results and\n\n331\n00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.160\nrisk assessment results as well,\nand then testing schedules.\n\n332\n00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.970\nYeah, and\ndon't forget the testing reports.\n\n333\n00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.480\nWhat happened when we tested?\n\n334\n00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.580\nSimple as that.\n\n335\n00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.840\nYou have to test.\n\n336\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.890\nAnd it's not just a case of\na walk through of your plans.\n\n337\n00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:49.250\nWe should be doing a test of\nour service continuity at least\n\n338\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.490\nonce a year, and\nafter any major change as well.\n\n339\n00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.010\nSo what about our processes then?\n\n340\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.536\nWhat sort of interactions do\nwe have with other processes?\n\n341\n00:18:58.536 --> 00:19:03.430\nWell, absolutely anything could and\n\n342\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:09.900\ndoes need to be backed up, and\nthen recovered in the case of a disaster,.\n\n343\n00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.630\nSo all of these will have an input and\n\n344\n00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.010\nwill have a relationship into\nService Continuity Management.\n\n345\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.160\nWell, let's think about, let's start\nwith capacity management, for instance.\n\n346\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.060\nCapacity management, well,\n\n347\n00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.470\nthey've gotta make sure we've got\nenough capacity disaster recovery site.\n\n348\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.500\nWhat about asset and\nconfiguration management?\n\n349\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.390\nThey tell us how the services are made up,\nwhat components are in our services.\n\n350\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.360\nWhat about information\nsecurity management?\n\n351\n00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.160\nWe've already mentioned\nsecurity on our plans.\n\n352\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.540\nBut think about security\nin our DR sites and\n\n353\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.920\nsecurity on our recovery servers as well.\n\n354\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.840\nWe still got to maintain exactly\nthe same profiles as we did\n\n355\n00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.200\nin our live environment.\n\n356\n00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.510\nBear in mind that different\npeople might have different roles\n\n357\n00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.780\nin the case of a disaster.\n\n358\n00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.790\nSo all of that's gotta be contained.\n\n359\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.720\nAnd I mentioned in our previous episode\nthat in service level management we should\n\n360\n00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.270\nhave different service level targets for\na continuity event.\n\n361\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:12.379\nSo any continuity event should have\ndifferent targets for availability and\n\n362\n00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:18.226\ndifferent targets for capacity, different\ntargets for incident management, etc.\n\n363\n00:20:18.226 --> 00:20:23.548\nAnd of course, availability is\ngoing to help define those targets,\n\n364\n00:20:23.548 --> 00:20:28.160\ninclude in those targets\nin the event of a disaster.\n\n365\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.350\nSo, let's take a look at\nincident management now then.\n\n366\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.930\nIncident management is a tricky one.\n\n367\n00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.700\nOkay, because incident management, well,\n\n368\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.020\nwhat is considered to be a disaster, and\nwhat isn't considered to be a disaster?\n\n369\n00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.290\nWhat's just a major incident?\n\n370\n00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.460\nAnd is a disaster a major incident?\n\n371\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.790\nThat's up to you.\n\n372\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.850\nThat's part of your invocation criteria.\n\n373\n00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.190\nBut it's also part of your\nservice level agreement and\n\n374\n00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.820\nneeds to be agreed with the customer.\n\n375\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:59.100\nAnd it's also part of your\nincident procedures as well.\n\n376\n00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.570\nSo you should have a model.\n\n377\n00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.640\nAnd if you don't understand\nthe concept of models, go back and\n\n378\n00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.310\ntake a look at your foundation material,\nand also go and\n\n379\n00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.800\ntake a a look at the material on incident\nmanagement on the service operations show.\n\n380\n00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:19.780\nBut you should have a model for the event\nof a disaster within incident management.\n\n381\n00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.790\nAnd the problem management,\nexactly the same.\n\n382\n00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.500\nProblem management is about identifying\nthe root cause of an incident.\n\n383\n00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.160\nSo problem management will help us\n\n384\n00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.850\nto find out what went wrong\nin the case of a disaster.\n\n385\n00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:41.600\nWe do not expect you to go rooting around\nfor root causes when something's happened.\n\n386\n00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.560\nWe expect you to pick up the pieces and\nthen go and find out what went wrong.\n\n387\n00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.455\nOur priority has to be\non restoring service.\n\n388\n00:21:48.455 --> 00:21:51.965\nSo our priority in the case of\nservice continuity is always on\n\n389\n00:21:51.965 --> 00:21:54.545\nincident management,\nit's on restoring service.\n\n390\n00:21:54.545 --> 00:21:56.645\nAnd then we'll go and\nfind out what caused it.\n\n391\n00:21:56.645 --> 00:21:59.301\nWe don't need to go and\nfind out what caused it straightaway,\n\n392\n00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:01.329\nwe just need to get things back up and\nrunning.\n\n393\n00:22:01.329 --> 00:22:03.986\n&gt;&gt; And I guess you could maybe say\nthe same for change management as well,\n\n394\n00:22:03.986 --> 00:22:04.492\nright, Jo?\n\n395\n00:22:04.492 --> 00:22:05.306\nLooking at priorities.\n\n396\n00:22:05.306 --> 00:22:08.462\nBecause we're not gonna be\nlooking at implementing some,\n\n397\n00:22:08.462 --> 00:22:12.501\nif we had a scheduled new e-mail server\nthat we we're gonna be setting up and\n\n398\n00:22:12.501 --> 00:22:17.040\nspinning up, then that's kind of pushed\nto the back burner at this point in time.\n\n399\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, but then that's not the reason\nwhy Change Management is in here.\n\n400\n00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.670\nChange Management is actually in here\nbecause, and I mean you're right,\n\n401\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.110\nthere's nothing wrong with\nwhat you're saying at all.\n\n402\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.460\nWe do have to consider that.\n\n403\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.620\nAnd if there are any changes,\nthen Change Management or\n\n404\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.060\nthe actual implementation of changes is\nthe last thing that we're going to be\n\n405\n00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.840\ndoing because we're implementing\nchanges in the live environment, and\n\n406\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.250\nif the live environment's no longer there,\nthen we can't do that, right?\n\n407\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.530\nBut the reason that change management is\nactually in here is because whenever we\n\n408\n00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:49.450\nmake any major change, we have to ensure\nthat we change the disaster recovery site.\n\n409\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:53.718\nSo anything that's changed in the live\nenvironment has to be reflected in the DR\n\n410\n00:22:53.718 --> 00:22:55.450\nsite, in our continuity site.\n\n411\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.812\nSo that's why-\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n412\n00:22:56.812 --> 00:23:00.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's why we have\nchange management in there.\n\n413\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.740\nSo what about roles and\nresponsibilities, then?\n\n414\n00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.960\nWell, you know what?\n\n415\n00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.810\nWith service continuity management,\nyou've got to have an owner.\n\n416\n00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.780\nSomebody's got to take ownership of this,\nand\n\n417\n00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.000\nyou've got to have somebody that\nmanages it on a day to day basis.\n\n418\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.800\nBut everybody, and this is what\nI like to point out to people,\n\n419\n00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.998\neverybody's got a responsibility for\nservice continuity management.\n\n420\n00:23:19.998 --> 00:23:24.890\nWe all need to know what we need\nto do in the case of a disaster,\n\n421\n00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.470\nwe all need to know that.\n\n422\n00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.530\nSo, yes, that's service\ncontinuity owner and manager.\n\n423\n00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.000\nWell, look at what they need to do.\n\n424\n00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.900\nThey need to participate in\nbusiness impact analysis along with\n\n425\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.810\nthe business relationship manager and\nfinancial management.\n\n426\n00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.690\nThey need to assess\nservice continuity issues.\n\n427\n00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.151\nThey need to maintain\na service continuity strategy.\n\n428\n00:23:46.151 --> 00:23:49.550\nAnd that may even mean looking at\nthe international standards and\n\n429\n00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.217\nother frameworks that there are for\nservice continuity management.\n\n430\n00:23:53.217 --> 00:23:54.838\nYes, they need to do all of this.\n\n431\n00:23:54.838 --> 00:23:59.507\nThey need to do the postmortem or\nrather as you call them in the states,\n\n432\n00:23:59.507 --> 00:24:03.388\nthe autopsy reports on what went wrong but\nnevertheless,\n\n433\n00:24:03.388 --> 00:24:09.620\nwe all still have a responsibility for\nundertaking service continuity management.\n\n434\n00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.080\nEverybody's got to be aware.\n\n435\n00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.560\nAnd as I've already mentioned, including\nstaff, including the organization and\n\n436\n00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.900\nincluding possibly our customers as well.\n\n437\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.570\nEverybody needs to be aware\nthat something's happened.\n\n438\n00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.700\nAnd as we've already mentioned,\nassessing changes for\n\n439\n00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.740\ntheir impact on service continuity.\n\n440\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:31.550\nWhenever we make a change, we've got to\nthink about our service continuity site.\n\n441\n00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.130\nWhich is why our service\ncontinuity manager\n\n442\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.140\nshould be part of that\nchange advisory board.\n\n443\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.960\nWhenever we talk about something\nthat's going to affect\n\n444\n00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.820\nthe whole of the organization.\n\n445\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.570\nIt's gonna affect our IT services\nthen they need to be present.\n\n446\n00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:50.870\nCuz they need to make sure that's\nreflected in our service continuity site.\n\n447\n00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.908\nSo, what is it that we need to achieve?\n\n448\n00:24:54.763 --> 00:24:59.470\nWe'll, we've gotta have regular audits\nof our service continuity plans.\n\n449\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:03.187\nAnd this is where I always get\nquite frustrated sometimes\n\n450\n00:25:03.187 --> 00:25:07.768\nwhen I see the word regular,because\nonce every ten years is regular.\n\n451\n00:25:07.768 --> 00:25:10.270\n[LAUGH] So what does that mean, right?\n\n452\n00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:16.410\nAnd the other words that we like to\nuse in IT a lot where appropriate and\n\n453\n00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.370\nwhat does that mean.\n\n454\n00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.850\nIt's where appropriate for you.\n\n455\n00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.840\nRegular ordinance does not meet once every\nten years, it means at least once a year.\n\n456\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.660\nBut you can do it every three months or\nsix months if you want to.\n\n457\n00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.120\nWe have to make sure that all of\nthe targets in our SLAs obviously\n\n458\n00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.150\nare not just agreed for our live\nenvironment but are also agreed for\n\n459\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.250\nour continuity environment as well.\n\n460\n00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.190\nAnd we have to have regular tests.\n\n461\n00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.740\nNot just of the plans but of also of\nthe service continuity mechanism as well.\n\n462\n00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.870\nHow regular that is is entirely up to you.\n\n463\n00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:54.550\nIn terms of staff awareness, and\nstaff preparedness, and training, and\n\n464\n00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:55.280\nbriefings, etc.\n\n465\n00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.090\nIf you want to go for, and\nI've mentioned this in a previous episode,\n\n466\n00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:02.108\nan ISO 20,000 audit, for instance.\n\n467\n00:26:02.108 --> 00:26:07.790\nThen an auditor, I will come along and\nI will ask anybody within your IT\n\n468\n00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:13.080\nservice provider whether you actually know\nwhere your service continuity plans are.\n\n469\n00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.160\nAnd if one person in the whole of\nIT tells me that they don't know\n\n470\n00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.490\nwhere the service continuity plans are,\nthen I am going to be failing that audit.\n\n471\n00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.440\nBecause quite simply, you need to know.\n\n472\n00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.850\nEverybody needs to be aware.\n\n473\n00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.730\nSo we have to have, well business\ncontinuity management because we have to\n\n474\n00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.740\nunderstand what's\nimportant to the business.\n\n475\n00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.230\nIt's important to the organization.\n\n476\n00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.510\nWe cannot make decisions on their behalf.\n\n477\n00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.470\nWe have to understand what their\nvital business functions are and\n\n478\n00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.780\nhow they want to operate\nshould a disaster occur.\n\n479\n00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:52.280\nIn our previous episode I mentioned\nabout you know a supermarket and\n\n480\n00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.700\nthe fact that its vital to business\nfunction is to sell stuff.\n\n481\n00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.790\nOrdinarily on a day to day basis.\n\n482\n00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.090\nBut you know if something\nhappens to that supermarket,\n\n483\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.241\nlet's say it burns to the ground then\nits vital business function changes.\n\n484\n00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:07.100\nAnd its vital business function is\nactually then to direct people,\n\n485\n00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.260\ncustomers to the nearest\nstore within the same chain.\n\n486\n00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.540\nAnd it's our job to support that,\n\n487\n00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.780\nit's not our job to change that\nbecause you can't change it.\n\n488\n00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.369\nWe've got to support the organization.\n\n489\n00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.330\nWe've gotta be completely\naligned with what they want and\n\n490\n00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:28.310\nof they don't have business continuity,\nthen that's going to be a problem to us.\n\n491\n00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.660\nWe have to meet their objectives.\n\n492\n00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.690\nBut we have to ensure that everybody\nin the organization is aware when there\n\n493\n00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:40.110\nis a disaster and\nwhen we have invoked service continuity.\n\n494\n00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:47.230\nSo, we've all ready mentioned the lack of\nbusiness continuity management process but\n\n495\n00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:51.090\nlook at the lack of support and the lack\nof commitment for business continuity.\n\n496\n00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:56.360\nThis is quite often manifested as\nlack of finances and lack of money.\n\n497\n00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.140\nThat's how we see it.\n\n498\n00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.610\nAnd when we don't have the funds to\nperform business continuity management,\n\n499\n00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.870\nthen this is when we\nexpose ourselves to risk.\n\n500\n00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.670\nI'm not gonna tell you\nthat that's wrong and\n\n501\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.870\nI'm not gonna tell you that\nthat's right obviously.\n\n502\n00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.360\nWhat I'm gonna tell you is that\n\n503\n00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.910\nwhatever decision you make in\nterms of business continuity and\n\n504\n00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:21.310\nin terms of IT service continuity\nto support the business continuity.\n\n505\n00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:27.300\nWell, you have to assess the risk and\nyou make the decision based on the risks.\n\n506\n00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.890\nAnd that decision needs\nto be documented and\n\n507\n00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.530\nyou need to be able to\njustify your decision.\n\n508\n00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:37.080\nThere is no right or wrong, but these\nare all things that you have to consider.\n\n509\n00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.950\nAnd you have to ensure that when\nyou perform the risk analysis,\n\n510\n00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.790\nespecially risk analysis on whether\nto simply have service continuity or\n\n511\n00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.440\nnot, when you perform that risk analysis,\nit's not done in isolation.\n\n512\n00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.920\nIt's not something that we do here in IT,\nand we forget about the organization.\n\n513\n00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.550\nSo now what I'd like you to do,\n\n514\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:01.590\nbecause we've wrapped up our episodes\nnow on service continuity management.\n\n515\n00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:06.725\nYou do have a couple of exercises\nin your downloadable material and\n\n516\n00:29:06.725 --> 00:29:10.275\nwhat I'd like for\nyou to do is to download that material and\n\n517\n00:29:10.275 --> 00:29:14.305\nI'd like you to go through\nthose exercises that you have.\n\n518\n00:29:14.305 --> 00:29:16.675\nIf you have any queries\nabout those exercises,\n\n519\n00:29:16.675 --> 00:29:21.222\nif you have any concerns at all, then\nplease come back to us by the forum and\n\n520\n00:29:21.222 --> 00:29:24.982\nI will be happy to help in\nanyway that I possibly can.\n\n521\n00:29:24.982 --> 00:29:28.142\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Jo, we appreciate that, and\nthank you for joining us as well, but for\n\n522\n00:29:28.142 --> 00:29:30.252\nthis show she's right, we are out of time.\n\n523\n00:29:30.252 --> 00:29:31.892\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n524\n00:29:31.892 --> 00:29:33.462\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n525\n00:29:33.462 --> 00:29:34.222\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n526\n00:29:34.222 --> 00:29:36.531\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n527\n00:29:36.531 -->

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:13.719\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nITIL Intermediate series.\n\n5\n00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.130\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.439\nIn this episode, we'll be looking\nat information security management.\n\n7\n00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.410\nBack in studios with us today we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.780\nHow's it going today Jo?\n\n9\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.710\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great Cherokee, how are you?\n\n10\n00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.560\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n11\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.280\nSo today we're gonna be talking about\ninformation security management.\n\n12\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.559\nWe kind of touched about security somewhat\nas it relates to disaster recovery,\n\n13\n00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.680\nbut specifically will we, if I can speak-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.990\n&gt;&gt; Be looking at in this show?\n\n15\n00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.770\n&gt;&gt; We'll be looking at the ITIL\nprocess of IT security management.\n\n16\n00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.750\nSo it's the last of our\nfour warranty processes.\n\n17\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.379\nWe've already looked in previous episodes,\nat availability management and\n\n18\n00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.791\ncapacity management.\n\n19\n00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:59.018\nAnd we just in our previous episode we\nlooked at service continuity management\n\n20\n00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:02.230\nand now we're looking at IT\nsecurity managements as well.\n\n21\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.262\nSo this is about the security\nof all of our IT.\n\n22\n00:01:06.262 --> 00:01:07.072\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n23\n00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:10.376\n&gt;&gt; Basically, it's about\nthe security of our information and\n\n24\n00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:14.080\nour information technology that\nsupports all of our information.\n\n25\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.670\nThink about CIA.\n\n26\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.203\nThink about the confidentiality,\nthe integrity, and\n\n27\n00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:21.167\nthe availability of our data.\n\n28\n00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:25.631\nEnsuring that we can maintain\nthe confidentiality of our data as we\n\n29\n00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:27.711\nhave in our first slide there.\n\n30\n00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:32.609\nEnsuring that we can maintain the\nintegrity of our data, as well, and that\n\n31\n00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:38.072\nit's available only to those that should\nhave access to it and not to anybody else.\n\n32\n00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:41.833\nAnd of course then, we've got the\nnon-repudiation there on the bottom there,\n\n33\n00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:45.415\nwhich is the ability to trust\nthird party transactions, as well.\n\n34\n00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:49.975\nBecause obviously, that plays a huge part,\nespecially now when we're in this sort\n\n35\n00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:53.675\nof world of virtualization and\nof cloud technology.\n\n36\n00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.200\nA lot of the transactions that we\ndo are third party transactions.\n\n37\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.180\nIt's very rare now, depending on\nthe size of your organization,\n\n38\n00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.680\nthat you actually have\nclient-based applications anymore.\n\n39\n00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.750\nA lot of your applications\nare now cloud-based.\n\n40\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.180\nWhich means that we're trusting\nthird party vendors and\n\n41\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.350\nsuppliers to help us with it.\n\n42\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.400\nSo the purpose here is to align ourselves\nwith the organization's security.\n\n43\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.930\nThey will tell us what level\nof security we need to have.\n\n44\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.355\nGovernment departments and\nfinancial institutions, well,\n\n45\n00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:32.113\nwe've got laws and we've got\nregulations that will tell us exactly\n\n46\n00:02:32.113 --> 00:02:34.794\nwhat we have to do with personal data.\n\n47\n00:02:34.794 --> 00:02:38.253\nIf you think about medical facilities,\nfor instance,\n\n48\n00:02:38.253 --> 00:02:42.224\nthey will tell us again exactly what\nwe need to do with our data and\n\n49\n00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:46.713\nwhat information we can keep, and\nwhat information we can't keep, and\n\n50\n00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:50.180\nwhat information we can\nshare with other parties.\n\n51\n00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.290\nIt's all part of IT security,\n\n52\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.075\nbecause even though this is part\nof the organization itself,\n\n53\n00:02:57.075 --> 00:03:00.770\nnevertheless, we are actually the people\nthat actually manage the data for them.\n\n54\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.645\nSo we have the met the needs\nof the organization.\n\n55\n00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:08.525\nSo this particular process in IT security\nmanagement, we're the focal point for\n\n56\n00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:10.585\nsecurity issues, funnily enough.\n\n57\n00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:13.955\nSo we have to understand\nwhat the organization wants.\n\n58\n00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:18.425\nWe have to understand their security\nneeds now and in the future as well,\n\n59\n00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:22.605\nbecause it's always our aim to align\nour sales with both the current and\n\n60\n00:03:22.605 --> 00:03:25.470\nfuture needs of the organization.\n\n61\n00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.230\nAnd I expect to see this documented in\nour service level agreements as well.\n\n62\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.840\nWe should have targets for security.\n\n63\n00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.614\nWe should have definitions of what is\nconsidered to be a security breach and\n\n64\n00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:43.691\nwe should have targets for how we intend\nto deal with those security breaches and\n\n65\n00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:47.658\nhow quickly and what should\nhappen with those as well, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:49.450\nAnd all of that should be agreed.\n\n67\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.383\nAnd I keep mentioning that word\nagreed because it's in the SLA,\n\n68\n00:03:52.383 --> 00:03:55.880\nthe service level agreement, that\nagreement between IT and the business.\n\n69\n00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.276\nSo working hand in hand with\navailability management and\n\n70\n00:04:00.276 --> 00:04:05.357\nwith IT service continuity management and\nwith business relationship management,\n\n71\n00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:08.340\nwill of course perform in risk management.\n\n72\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.260\nAnd then we have to, as we've mentioned\nin all of the previous processes,\n\n73\n00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.510\nwe have to assess risk and\nthen we manage risk.\n\n74\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.900\nIn other words, we decide what\nwe're going to do with each risk.\n\n75\n00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.752\nWe have to ensure that we have\nproduced an IT security policy.\n\n76\n00:04:24.752 --> 00:04:29.680\nAnd that should be enforced, and\nthat applies to absolutely everybody.\n\n77\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.490\nI was ask a question normally\nat this point in time and\n\n78\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.260\nI'll ask sort of who should have\naccess to the IT security policy.\n\n79\n00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.420\nAbsolutely everybody should have\naccess to the security policy.\n\n80\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.064\nThere should be no ambiguity as to\nwhether you have breached the security\n\n81\n00:04:43.064 --> 00:04:43.850\npolicy or not.\n\n82\n00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.484\nAnd when I say everybody,\nI mean your visitors,\n\n83\n00:04:46.484 --> 00:04:49.770\nI mean absolutely everybody\ninto your organization.\n\n84\n00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.130\nYour security policy should be there for\neverybody to see.\n\n85\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.310\nThere should be no ambiguity whether\nyou're visitor, whether you're supplier,\n\n86\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.620\nwhether you're an employee, you should\nknow whether you're doing something wrong.\n\n87\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.600\nAnd it's not just that sort of quickly\nfeeling at the back of your neck\n\n88\n00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.430\nthat says I shouldn't be doing this and\n\n89\n00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.290\nshould be written down in clear concise\nlanguage that everybody understands.\n\n90\n00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.475\nAnd it should be integrated\nwith all of our processes and\n\n91\n00:05:15.475 --> 00:05:17.522\nwith all of our activities as well.\n\n92\n00:05:17.522 --> 00:05:18.570\n&gt;&gt; That's a good point Jo.\n\n93\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.995\nI've actually gotten a postcard and\nan email after a potential breach\n\n94\n00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:27.495\nhad occurred, outlining particular\nsections of security policies,\n\n95\n00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:32.681\njust to reinforce that confidence, me as\nan end user from particular companies.\n\n96\n00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:36.753\nAnd I thought, wow, that was really cool\nof them to let us know what they're doing\n\n97\n00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.535\nto keep me and my information safe.\n\n98\n00:05:38.535 --> 00:05:41.045\n&gt;&gt; We also have to have some common\nsense attached to that as well,\n\n99\n00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:46.720\nbecause you remind me of a previous\nepisode when I was in the UK government.\n\n100\n00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.666\nAnd of course with any government data,\nwe have security levels attached to data.\n\n101\n00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:56.640\nAnd those security levels\nwould be sort of open.\n\n102\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.922\nAnd then we have restricted and\nthen confidential then secret etc.\n\n103\n00:06:01.922 --> 00:06:07.074\nAnd so I remember at one point in\ntime coming into my desk one morning\n\n104\n00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:11.592\nto find notification of a security\nbreach left on my desk.\n\n105\n00:06:11.592 --> 00:06:15.364\nAnd that meant that I needed to go down to\nthe security office cuz somebody was in\n\n106\n00:06:15.364 --> 00:06:15.888\ntrouble.\n\n107\n00:06:15.888 --> 00:06:21.574\nAnd as it turned out, one of my team\nhad printed something off a printer and\n\n108\n00:06:21.574 --> 00:06:23.881\nhad left it there overnight.\n\n109\n00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:26.277\nAnd because there was\ntheir name attached to it,\n\n110\n00:06:26.277 --> 00:06:29.848\nthen they received a security breach\nwhich I then had to go and deal with.\n\n111\n00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:33.694\nThe interesting point to all of that\nwas the fact that this wasn't actually\n\n112\n00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:37.920\na government confidential report,\nthis was a management confidential report.\n\n113\n00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.183\nAnd it was actually just the minutes of\na management meeting that we had had.\n\n114\n00:06:42.183 --> 00:06:45.855\nSure, it shouldn't have been left\non a printer, but nevertheless,\n\n115\n00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:50.040\nit's at that point in time where I say you\nhave to have some common sense in this.\n\n116\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.450\nBecause think about the difference\nbetween if you're going to use words,\n\n117\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.880\nif you have security levels\nwithin your documentation and\n\n118\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.430\nyou have security levels in your data,\nthink about common sense on this one.\n\n119\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.010\nBecause, don't use that word for\nanything else.\n\n120\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.610\nIf that word is used for\n\n121\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.920\na specific security level,\nthen don't use it for something else.\n\n122\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.490\nUse another word for something else, and\ninstead of saying management confidential,\n\n123\n00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.240\nit should say something along\nthe lines of management information or\n\n124\n00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.216\nmanagement eyes only as opposed to-\n&gt;&gt; Sure enough, it's confusing [CROSSTALK]\n\n125\n00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:26.068\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\n\n126\n00:07:26.068 --> 00:07:29.970\nthat's what I'll always tell you,\nis use common sense.\n\n127\n00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.660\nWith ITIL,\nyes okay will give you guidelines,\n\n128\n00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.890\nbut then at the same time use your brains,\nokay?\n\n129\n00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.375\nWe've got one on our shoulders for\na reason.\n\n130\n00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:44.222\nWe also might want to bring in something\nlike international standard for\n\n131\n00:07:44.222 --> 00:07:46.374\nIT security, ISO 27002.\n\n132\n00:07:46.374 --> 00:07:51.377\nAnd in that instance then we would audit\nagainst certain security criteria and\n\n133\n00:07:51.377 --> 00:07:54.654\nachieve hopefully that\ninternational standard.\n\n134\n00:07:54.654 --> 00:07:59.631\nSo don't think that we're just limited\nto ITIL here, there are lots of other\n\n135\n00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:04.383\nsecurity methodologies and\nsecurity standards as well, international\n\n136\n00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:09.151\nstandards that we could actually Hope\nto achieve in terms of IT security.\n\n137\n00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:12.865\nSo literally what we're gonna do\nhere within ITIL is simply look\n\n138\n00:08:12.865 --> 00:08:17.470\nat this from a very high level, because\nas I've already said in a lot of previous\n\n139\n00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.040\nepisodes we just adopt\nITIL as a framework.\n\n140\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.420\nAnd then we adapt it to suit ourselves.\n\n141\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.990\nIf we want to work towards say\n\n142\n00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.510\nISO 27002 then obviously that's\ncompletely up to your organization.\n\n143\n00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:34.595\nBut again, all of these other security\nmethodologies including ISO 27002,\n\n144\n00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:36.955\nand they're complimentary to ITIL.\n\n145\n00:08:36.955 --> 00:08:39.890\nWe're never gonna contradict\nanything that is said\n\n146\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.570\nin any of these other frameworks or\nmethodologies.\n\n147\n00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.690\nWe'll just provide guidance on that issue.\n\n148\n00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.720\nAnd common sense is one of\nthe biggest pieces of advice and\n\n149\n00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.660\nguidance that I can give you,\ndon't forget it.\n\n150\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.520\nWe ultimately have to support\nthe security of the organization.\n\n151\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.100\nWhat we want to see is all of this.\n\n152\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.220\nThis is my if we get it right slide,\nand I love this.\n\n153\n00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.540\nThe value to the organization,\nif we get it right,\n\n154\n00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.570\nwe're going to achieve all of these.\n\n155\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.090\nWe're gonna increase awareness\nof the security policy.\n\n156\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.450\nWe're gonna decrease security breaches.\n\n157\n00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.800\nWe're gonna decrease\ninstances of non-conformance.\n\n158\n00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.020\nAnd we have an increase in services\nthat include security in them\n\n159\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.610\nif we get it right.\n\n160\n00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:28.020\nIf we get it wrong, well, we result in\ncompromises to our services themselves and\n\n161\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.910\nthen that CIA, well, we can't be\nassured of any element of the CIA.\n\n162\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.760\nWhat we want to do is provide assurance\nto the business through enforcing IT\n\n163\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.190\nsecurity controls, making sure that we\nmeet the needs of the organization.\n\n164\n00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:45.575\nThere's a balance though that\nwe have to have with this,\n\n165\n00:09:45.575 --> 00:09:49.763\ncuz quite often IT security is\nseen to be a complete pain, and\n\n166\n00:09:49.763 --> 00:09:56.315\n[LAUGH] IT security is seem to be\nvery draconian and incredibly rigid.\n\n167\n00:09:56.315 --> 00:09:59.635\nLike I said, you've got to bring in\ncommon sense into this because sure,\n\n168\n00:09:59.635 --> 00:10:04.350\nit depends on the environment as to the\nlevel of security that you have to have.\n\n169\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:09.134\nBut let's just think about this sensibly\nand this is why I say common sense,\n\n170\n00:10:09.134 --> 00:10:13.570\nbecause sometimes we get so\nsecure that we actually become insecure.\n\n171\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.660\nYou know that password policy?\n\n172\n00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.370\nWell, your password changes\nevery single week and\n\n173\n00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.250\nit has to have 15 characters in it.\n\n174\n00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.430\nAnd it has to have one uppercase,\none lowercase.\n\n175\n00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.560\nAnd it has to have no two\nconsecutive letters or numbers.\n\n176\n00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.750\nAnd it has to have a special character.\n\n177\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.620\nAnd it has to start with the same letter\nas the day of the month that it's in.\n\n178\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.460\nYou know the one.\n\n179\n00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.890\nAnd what happens is that you\nend up actually getting so\n\n180\n00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.780\nsecure that you write the password down.\n\n181\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.050\nAnd you put it on a Post-it note,\na sticky note, and leave it somewhere,\n\n182\n00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.860\nunderneath your keyboard,\nor on top of your screen.\n\n183\n00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.540\nWe become so\nsecure that we become insecure.\n\n184\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.800\nSensible, we have to be sensible.\n\n185\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.780\nSo we should have an IT security policy.\n\n186\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.240\nBut our IT security policy should\nbe available to everybody.\n\n187\n00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.392\nAnd should include or\nat least consider all of these, okay?\n\n188\n00:11:11.392 --> 00:11:14.952\nAll of these including access control,\npassword control,\n\n189\n00:11:14.952 --> 00:11:19.278\nas we've just mentioned, your Internet\npolicy, what you can access and\n\n190\n00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:22.766\nwhat you can't access on the Internet,\nthe email policy,\n\n191\n00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:27.121\nthe document classification policy\nas I've already just talked about.\n\n192\n00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:30.690\nAnd think about being sensible.\n\n193\n00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.300\nThink about the fact that without common\nsense then all of this is meaningless.\n\n194\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.540\nAnd by the way,\nif you impose too strict of security\n\n195\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.780\ncontrols then people will try to get\naround it, it's as simple as that.\n\n196\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.280\nYou become so\nsecure that you become insecure.\n\n197\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.840\nWe should always undertake risk assessment\nwhen it comes to security management.\n\n198\n00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.830\nThis is another one of our risk processes,\nwhere we evaluate risk along with service\n\n199\n00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:59.890\ncontinuity management and along with\navailability management as well.\n\n200\n00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.190\nAnd as with all risk assessment,\nit should be documented.\n\n201\n00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.813\nAnd whatever framework you're following,\nwe should document the results and\n\n202\n00:12:07.813 --> 00:12:09.814\nwe should document the actions and\n\n203\n00:12:09.814 --> 00:12:13.961\nthe decisions that you're making as\na result of that risk assessment.\n\n204\n00:12:15.498 --> 00:12:22.718\nIT security management, well we should\nhave policies for this, simple as this.\n\n205\n00:12:22.718 --> 00:12:26.960\nIt's critical, when it comes to our\nsecurity there should be a policy in\n\n206\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.757\nplace, it should be part of our service\nlevel agreements and it should be signed,\n\n207\n00:12:31.757 --> 00:12:35.117\nand everybody should be aware\nof our IT security policy.\n\n208\n00:12:35.117 --> 00:12:39.536\nAnd at the bottom there, it asks a\nquestion about what other processes would\n\n209\n00:12:39.536 --> 00:12:41.967\nneed to consider information security?\n\n210\n00:12:41.967 --> 00:12:43.504\nThe simple answer to that is,\n\n211\n00:12:43.504 --> 00:12:47.220\nabsolutely every single process\nneeds to consider IT security.\n\n212\n00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.889\nIf we have data and we're storing data,\n\n213\n00:12:49.889 --> 00:12:55.388\nwhether it's data to do with individuals,\nwhether it's data to do with finance,\n\n214\n00:12:55.388 --> 00:12:59.568\nwhether it's data to do with\ncompany sensitive information.\n\n215\n00:12:59.568 --> 00:13:04.087\nMaybe even data about our competitors and\nour marketplace,\n\n216\n00:13:04.087 --> 00:13:07.108\nwhere we are in our marketplace, then.\n\n217\n00:13:07.108 --> 00:13:11.490\nYeah, we need to have that data or\nsecurity policy that tells us who should\n\n218\n00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.610\nhave access to what and\nhow we're going to look after it as well.\n\n219\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.360\nThink about also our suppliers.\n\n220\n00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.000\nPeople that take away our backup tapes,\nfor instance.\n\n221\n00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.860\nWhat do they do with our backup tapes?\n\n222\n00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.500\nHow can we trust them?\n\n223\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.680\nAnd I'm not saying that you should be\nuntrusting of everybody, but nevertheless,\n\n224\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.530\ndo you have nondisclosure\nagreements with these people?\n\n225\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.220\nYou know what, you might think that you\ndon't need to because it's all right,\n\n226\n00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.270\nwe're just giving them tapes.\n\n227\n00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.890\nBut surely somebody somewhere\nhas got access to a machine,\n\n228\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.810\nwhatever the technology is\nthat could read those tapes.\n\n229\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.858\nAnd what happens if they also store\ndata for our competitors as well?\n\n230\n00:13:46.858 --> 00:13:53.471\nThey store their data, what if they give\nthe wrong tapes to the wrong person?\n\n231\n00:13:54.664 --> 00:13:59.037\n&gt;&gt; Or worse, are even bribed,\nto any kind of corruption there.\n\n232\n00:13:59.037 --> 00:14:00.738\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's happened, and\n\n233\n00:14:00.738 --> 00:14:04.770\nwe can't pretend that it doesn't happen\nbecause it does and it has happened.\n\n234\n00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.910\nAnd so we have to be incredibly\ncareful with our data.\n\n235\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.620\nWe have to consider our people,\nour process, our products, and\n\n236\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.420\nour partners when it comes to security.\n\n237\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.843\nThese four Ps are our four Ps of service\ndesign and they actually apply to every\n\n238\n00:14:19.843 --> 00:14:24.840\nsingle one of our processes, our service\ndesign processes, including this.\n\n239\n00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.510\nWe have to consider the security\nof all of these, people,\n\n240\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.850\nprocess, products, and partners.\n\n241\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.757\nSo we have an ISMIS,\n\n242\n00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:40.058\nan Information Security Management\nInformation System, okay?\n\n243\n00:14:40.058 --> 00:14:44.239\nAnd that should consist of,\nit's a database where we keep our policy,\n\n244\n00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:48.585\nwhere we keep our standards, and\nour procedures, and our strategy.\n\n245\n00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:52.225\nWhere we keep hold of our organizational\nstructure, which by the way, everybody\n\n246\n00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:56.895\nshould see who has the responsibility and\naccountability for security.\n\n247\n00:14:56.895 --> 00:15:00.858\nIt's where we should keep data for\nour security controls, and\n\n248\n00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:04.597\nit's also where we should keep\nour staff awareness plan and\n\n249\n00:15:04.597 --> 00:15:08.959\njust think about how you're going\nto make people aware of security.\n\n250\n00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:13.769\nI've worked in organizations where,\nand in fact just last week I was in\n\n251\n00:15:13.769 --> 00:15:19.130\nan organization where there is a very\nstrict policy in place for security.\n\n252\n00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.558\nIn that training is done on\na computer-based training.\n\n253\n00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:30.290\nAnd everybody every year has to pass this\nparticular security training program and\n\n254\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.100\nif they don't pass then their access\nto the IT services are revoked.\n\n255\n00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.254\nThat's quite standard,\n\n256\n00:15:36.254 --> 00:15:39.105\nit's quite commonplace in\na lot of secure environments.\n\n257\n00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:43.045\nAnd so I expect to see those\nsort of policies in place.\n\n258\n00:15:43.045 --> 00:15:44.455\nIt doesn't matter what policy you have.\n\n259\n00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:46.045\nI expect it to be documented and\n\n260\n00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:50.972\nI expect it to be in your\nsecurity management system, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:50.972 --> 00:15:54.223\nOf course, we have to be integrated\ninto our service asset and\n\n262\n00:15:54.223 --> 00:15:56.233\nconfiguration management process.\n\n263\n00:15:56.233 --> 00:15:59.929\nSo our configuration management system,\nwhat that's going to tell\n\n264\n00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:03.889\nus what services we have and what\ncomponents there are of those services.\n\n265\n00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:08.719\nIn other words this is where we\nneed to enforce security on all\n\n266\n00:16:08.719 --> 00:16:13.380\nof these services and\non all of these components.\n\n267\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.018\nSo let's take a look at the process then.\n\n268\n00:16:15.018 --> 00:16:20.470\nThe process itself, and\nwe're going to see this over the next\n\n269\n00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.260\nfew pages, over the next few slides, but\nwe start off with controlling security and\n\n270\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.610\nthen we plan for it, we implement it,\nthen we evaluate it, and we maintain it.\n\n271\n00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.690\nBy control, what I actually mean is we\nhave to establish a framework for control.\n\n272\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.460\nWe have to establish\nan organizational structure for\n\n273\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.980\ncontrol and allocate responsibilities.\n\n274\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.550\nWho is going to be in charge?\n\n275\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.320\nWho is gonna take ownership\nof your IT security?\n\n276\n00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.640\nAnd who's going to do what?\n\n277\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.310\nWho has what responsibility?\n\n278\n00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.150\nRemember what I said, everybody,\n\n279\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:58.150\nabsolutely everybody has got\na responsibility for security, everyone.\n\n280\n00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.850\nNow we plan for security.\n\n281\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.640\nWe talk about security recommendations and\nsecurity measures, but\n\n282\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.440\nyour plans need to be reflected\nin your SLAs and your OLAs, etc.\n\n283\n00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.050\nWe have to have funding,\nwhere appropriate, for security, but\n\n284\n00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:22.160\nthere should be no ambiguity as to what\nis considered to be a security breach.\n\n285\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.880\nNo ambiguity, at all.\n\n286\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.850\nIt is not about that prickly feeling\nat the back of your neck that says,\n\n287\n00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.700\nI think I'm doing something wrong.\n\n288\n00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.290\nThat's not what it is about.\n\n289\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.930\nIt's about having something documented\nthat says, this is wrong and\n\n290\n00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.340\nthis is acceptable.\n\n291\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.840\nIf you plug a USB device into your laptop,\nis that okay?\n\n292\n00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.750\nI don't have the answer to that, but\n\n293\n00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:49.360\nsomebody in your security team\nshould have the answer to that.\n\n294\n00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.200\nAnd more importantly you should know,\n\n295\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.770\nand you should know where to\nfind the answer to that, too.\n\n296\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:18:00.250\nAnd that's part of the implementation of\nsecurity, is that creating awareness.\n\n297\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.710\nHaving that clear and agreed policy and\n\n298\n00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.110\nmaking sure that we're marketing this,\nas well.\n\n299\n00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.600\nThat we actually have a mindset for\nsecurity and\n\n300\n00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.610\nthat everybody is aware of security.\n\n301\n00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.540\n&gt;&gt; And Jill, we've talked about this\nbefore considering our audience.\n\n302\n00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.200\nBecause what good does it do if we create\nthis wonderful security policy that\n\n303\n00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.380\npeople don't understand?\n\n304\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.630\nSo if we need to have a training to\nexplain the policy, then so be it, but\n\n305\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.230\nwe can't just assume that-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n306\n00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.750\none of the things that we will tell you\nin our guiding principles in ITIL is that\n\n307\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:34.350\ncommunication is a two way process, and\nwe should always be eliciting feedback.\n\n308\n00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.930\nAnd we forget about this\nwhen it comes to security.\n\n309\n00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.810\nWe have a tendency in IT\nto impose some draconian\n\n310\n00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.730\nmeasures on security where\nwe will be very very secure.\n\n311\n00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.100\nBut then as I say, we get so\nsecure that we become insecure.\n\n312\n00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.690\nAnd if we miss out that feedback and\nif we don't take that feedback,\n\n313\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.810\nwhen we're doing our training and\nwhen we're doing our sort of\n\n314\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.640\nawareness campaigns, then actually we\ndon't pick up on things like this.\n\n315\n00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.020\nThis password policy that\nwe all adopt nowadays,\n\n316\n00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:09.340\nwe have this password policy that\nbecomes so secure that it's insecure.\n\n317\n00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.128\nWell, where was the feedback to the\nsecurity team that said, you know what,\n\n318\n00:19:13.128 --> 00:19:15.477\nI'm never going to\nremember these passwords.\n\n319\n00:19:15.477 --> 00:19:19.397\nSo I'm going to write them down from now\non because that should have been fed back\n\n320\n00:19:19.397 --> 00:19:22.730\nto the security team, and\nthe security team should have said okay,\n\n321\n00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.230\nI need to look for other ways,\nmaybe fingerprint recognition.\n\n322\n00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.453\nI mean there was a time, and\nit was quite a few years ago now, where\n\n323\n00:19:29.453 --> 00:19:34.090\nyou used to have laptops with fingerprint\nrecognition, and then that died out.\n\n324\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.920\nFor some strange reason that died out.\n\n325\n00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.907\nAnd now it's back on our cell phones.\n\n326\n00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:40.884\nWe have to consider security.\n\n327\n00:19:40.884 --> 00:19:43.692\nAnd sometimes we have to consider\ninnovative ways in security,\n\n328\n00:19:43.692 --> 00:19:47.060\nbut we also have to take into\nconsideration that feedback.\n\n329\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.870\nBecause if I'm not going\nto observe security, and\n\n330\n00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:56.010\nI'm gonna find a way around security-\n&gt;&gt; We're working against ourselves.\n\n331\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWhat's the point in having the security?\n\n332\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.020\nAnd that's what we've got to consider.\n\n333\n00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.990\nSo yes.\n\n334\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.930\nSecurity's gotta have common sense,\n\n335\n00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.358\nbecause otherwise people\nare just gonna bypass it.\n\n336\n00:20:06.358 --> 00:20:07.102\nAnd by the way,\n\n337\n00:20:07.102 --> 00:20:11.180\nI mean there are people out there that\nmake a living out of bypassing security.\n\n338\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.420\nWe have professional hackers nowadays,\nand a lot of companies will use\n\n339\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.870\nthese professional hacking companies to\ncome in and test their level of security.\n\n340\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.890\nWe'll actually advise that\nin certain instances.\n\n341\n00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.720\nWe will advise those sort of companies-\n&gt;&gt; Penetration testing for sure.\n\n342\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n343\n00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.006\nYeah, we will definitely advise that.\n\n344\n00:20:29.006 --> 00:20:32.270\nSo security is a big deal, and\nsecurity needs to be a big deal, but\n\n345\n00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.810\nwe also need to think about the common\nsense aspect of security as well.\n\n346\n00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.468\nAnd you can't just impose\ndraconian measures in security and\n\n347\n00:20:38.468 --> 00:20:40.640\nexpect everybody to be\nable to follow them.\n\n348\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.090\nCuz quite simply,\nit's beyond our capability.\n\n349\n00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:49.010\nI can't remember a password either, and\nyou know you have a password for, I mean-\n\n350\n00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.380\n&gt;&gt; How many accounts?\n\n351\n00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, I must have probably about 40\ndifferent passwords for various accounts.\n\n352\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.880\nRight the way from banking to medical\ninformation through to my password for\n\n353\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.820\nthe office, through to my email password\nand my personal email password.\n\n354\n00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.460\nWe've got a password for\nabsolutely everything, and\n\n355\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.082\nactually now I think about it, I've\nprobably got a lot more the 40 passwords.\n\n356\n00:21:13.082 --> 00:21:14.732\n&gt;&gt; You got password for a password list.\n\n357\n00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:16.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n358\n00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.650\nYeah, exactly.\n\n359\n00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.870\nSo you know what?\n\n360\n00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:23.910\nWe're just getting to the situation\nwhere we take security for\n\n361\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.390\ngranted, and we take the fact that we\ncan bypass security for granted, too.\n\n362\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.160\nBecause now, you just mentioned\nsomething really interesting.\n\n363\n00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.940\nThere's a password for a password list.\n\n364\n00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.030\nWe now keep lists of passwords.\n\n365\n00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:39.250\nWe now have tools that will actually\nmanage our passwords for us.\n\n366\n00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.025\nWe're giving management of our\npasswords to a third party!\n\n367\n00:21:43.025 --> 00:21:46.108\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we've got to think about this.\n\n368\n00:21:46.108 --> 00:21:49.610\nOkay, in security,\nyou've got to be sensible because while\n\n369\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.680\notherwise now you get to the situation\nwhere a third party can come along,\n\n370\n00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.650\noffer to manage your passwords for\nyou, and you were saying, yes please.\n\n371\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.670\nI need you to help with that.\n\n372\n00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:58.510\n&gt;&gt; That's so nice of you.\n\n373\n00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, that's so nice of you, but\n\n374\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.990\nhang on a minute I'm giving\nyou my password, really?\n\n375\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.768\nAll of them?\n\n376\n00:22:04.768 --> 00:22:07.370\nYeah, we've got to think about this.\n\n377\n00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:08.740\nThat's part of the implementation.\n\n378\n00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.840\nIt's part of planning for\nsecurity and then implementing and\n\n379\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.990\ncreating that awareness campaign,\nbut also eliciting feedback.\n\n380\n00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:21.210\nWe've got to get feedback from people\nas to whether this is sensible and\n\n381\n00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.500\nwhether we can actually\nachieve security or not.\n\n382\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.650\nAnd that's another part of the, I guess\nthe evaluation of security as well.\n\n383\n00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:32.069\nAnd we talk about regular audits etc, but\n\n384\n00:22:32.069 --> 00:22:36.770\njust think about people using\nsecurity on a daily basis.\n\n385\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.030\nI mentioned an example a little while ago\nabout me coming in in the morning and\n\n386\n00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:45.600\nfinding a little envelope on my desk cuz\none of my team had breached security.\n\n387\n00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.710\nThat's part of a security audit that\nhappened every single night in that\n\n388\n00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:53.650\nparticular department where the security\nteam would walk around, and\n\n389\n00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.610\nthey would look at printers,\nthey would look at desks,\n\n390\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.290\nand they would check to ensure that there\nwas nothing confidential lying around.\n\n391\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.440\nThat was an audit that\nhappened every single day.\n\n392\n00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.230\nAnd I mean, there's really no excuse.\n\n393\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.082\nIf you know that's gonna happen every\nsingle day then you really don't need to\n\n394\n00:23:08.082 --> 00:23:10.218\nbe leaving anything lying around [LAUGH].\n\n395\n00:23:10.218 --> 00:23:11.753\nThere is no excuse.\n\n396\n00:23:11.753 --> 00:23:14.395\nBut we have to conduct regular audits,\n\n397\n00:23:14.395 --> 00:23:18.743\nespecially if you are in charge\nof personal data about people.\n\n398\n00:23:18.743 --> 00:23:22.060\nAnd you have to learn by\nthese audits as well.\n\n399\n00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.810\nIt's no good just having an audit and\nthen noting down what's happened and\n\n400\n00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.780\nthe results of an audit,\nand then ignoring it.\n\n401\n00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.470\nYou have to learn by\nthis particular audit.\n\n402\n00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.630\nSo, ensure that we have regular audits,\nand\n\n403\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.600\nthen ensure that we learn and\nthat we actually do something about it.\n\n404\n00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.070\nAnd we utilize then,\nthis is that the plan to check out,\n\n405\n00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:47.350\nthe Deming cycle to actually plan for\nsecurity.\n\n406\n00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.280\nDo it, make any changes.\n\n407\n00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.839\nCheck that it's worked, and\nthen decide what we're going to do next.\n\n408\n00:23:53.839 --> 00:23:56.971\nSo take any remedial action and\ndecide what we're going to do next.\n\n409\n00:23:56.971 --> 00:23:58.830\nIt's an iterative process.\n\n410\n00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.999\nAs you see in the bottom right corner.\n\n411\n00:24:00.999 --> 00:24:02.038\nWe have an iterative process.\n\n412\n00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:07.261\nWe plan security, we implement it,\nwe evaluate it, and then we maintain.\n\n413\n00:24:07.261 --> 00:24:12.230\nAnd again, as I said previously,\nwe should be really, really confident as\n\n414\n00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.380\nto what is considered a security breach\nand what's not a security breach.\n\n415\n00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.340\nThere's no ambiguity about this at all.\n\n416\n00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.983\nSo, just before we leave you for\nthis episode,\n\n417\n00:24:22.983 --> 00:24:26.336\nI want you to take a look at our\nsecurity management process.\n\n418\n00:24:26.336 --> 00:24:31.220\nBecause we've already talked about the\niterative nature of security management.\n\n419\n00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.682\nAnd as you see in that right-hand corner,\nwe produce the policy.\n\n420\n00:24:34.682 --> 00:24:37.213\nWe assess all of our assets.\n\n421\n00:24:37.213 --> 00:24:42.881\nWe assess regularly exactly how\nwe're performing against security,\n\n422\n00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:45.830\nand then we impose any controls.\n\n423\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.980\nAnd this is an iterative process.\n\n424\n00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:54.430\nWe want to maintain a security policy that\nmeets the needs of the organizations.\n\n425\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.250\nOver here, we have to monitor and\nmanage any incidents and any breaches.\n\n426\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:05.110\nAnd we have to, on an iterative basis,\ncommunicate security as well.\n\n427\n00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:10.221\nAnd everything is kept in information\nsecurity management information system.\n\n428\n00:25:10.221 --> 00:25:13.679\nOur IT security management\ninformation system,\n\n429\n00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:19.043\nit's kept here in this particular\ndatabase, as we've already mentioned.\n\n430\n00:25:19.043 --> 00:25:24.500\nSo this is it for\nepisode one of IT Security Management.\n\n431\n00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.490\nAnd what I'd like you to do right now is,\nI'd like you to to spend a little bit of\n\n432\n00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.550\ntime looking at the exercise\nin your downloadable material.\n\n433\n00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.488\nAnd I'd also like you to spend a little\nbit of time, I've talked about ISO 2702.\n\n434\n00:25:36.488 --> 00:25:40.847\nAnd it really would be worth your while\njust researching out there on what other\n\n435\n00:25:40.847 --> 00:25:42.500\ncomplementary frameworks,\n\n436\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.290\nwhat other complementary standards\nthere are on IT security.\n\n437\n00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.400\nAnd I use the word complementary, and\nI mean to use the word complementary.\n\n438\n00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.027\nBecause we're not gonna tell\nyou how to do your security.\n\n439\n00:25:53.027 --> 00:25:54.830\nWe'll tell you that you\nneed to have security.\n\n440\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.685\nBut obviously, it's up to you to adapt\nsecurity to suit your environment.\n\n441\n00:25:59.685 --> 00:26:03.035\nSo when I say, go away and\nhave a look at complementary frameworks,\n\n442\n00:26:03.035 --> 00:26:05.335\nbecause every single\norganization works differently.\n\n443\n00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:09.937\nSo every single organization will\nimplement a different framework or\n\n444\n00:26:09.937 --> 00:26:12.589\na different methodology for security,\n\n445\n00:26:12.589 --> 00:26:17.667\nincluding those that want to attain\nthe ISO 27000 into accreditation.\n\n446\n00:26:17.667 --> 00:26:20.480\nSo now's your opportunity to go away and\nresearch that.\n\n447\n00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.036\nAnd when we come back, we'll be looking in\nour next episode at a little bit more of\n\n448\n00:26:25.036 --> 00:26:27.722\nthe security controls\nthat we may put in place.\n\n449\n00:26:27.722 --> 00:26:28.944\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\nGreat advice, Jo,\n\n450\n00:26:28.944 --> 00:26:30.460\nespecially my favorite is NIST.\n\n451\n00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.072\nWe talk about that a lot when we talk\nabout security here at IT PRO TV.\n\n452\n00:26:34.072 --> 00:26:37.220\nSo like she said, looking at those\ntools that are available to you,\n\n453\n00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.280\nyou don't have to go at this alone.\n\n454\n00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.401\nBut for this show, we are out of time and\nJo said, for this episode.\n\n455\n00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:47.051\nSo I have a feeling there's a part two\nheaded your way, so don't go anywhere.\n\n456\n00:26:47.051 --> 00:26:48.180\n&gt;&gt; There certainly is.\n\n457\n00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.093\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll sign out.\n\n458\n00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:51.860\nRemember, I've been your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n459\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.789\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n460\n00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:55.501\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n461\n00:26:55.501 --> 00:27:01.352\n[MUSIC]\n\n462\n00:27:01.352 --> 00:27:04.559\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

ladies and gentlemen\nto your ITIL INtermediate series.\n\n4\n00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.584\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose, in this\nepisode we will continue with Apache 2\n\n5\n00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:22.170\nwhere we will be looking at\ninformation security management.\n\n6\n00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.350\nBack in studios with us today we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock.\n\n7\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.560\nHow are you today, Jo?\n\n8\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.340\n&gt;&gt; I am fine, thank you Cherokee.\n\n9\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.900\nHow are you?\n\n10\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.140\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.760\nI'd like to know what we're\ngonna be talking about here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.120\nWe just spoke about security management,\nbut we didn't quite finish up.\n\n13\n00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.000\nSo where will be begin in this episode?\n\n14\n00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.790\n&gt;&gt; Well, in our previous episode we\nlooked at the IT Security management\n\n15\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.750\n&gt;&gt; Process.\n\n16\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.510\nAnd about how we have to plan for\nsecurity, and\n\n17\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.460\nthen we implement it, and we audit it.\n\n18\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.120\nThen obviously, we update it,\nbased on the findings of our audit.\n\n19\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.810\nOf course, we have to have\nan establishment of control for security.\n\n20\n00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.660\nSomebody's gotta take ownership of it.\n\n21\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.480\nAnd here we are, we're just gonna carry\non with the actual physical controls of\n\n22\n00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.910\n&gt;&gt; IT Security and\n\n23\n00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.930\nthen we're going to look at security\nbreaches and also roles and\n\n24\n00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.520\nresponsibilities with an IT security,\nand to be fair roles and\n\n25\n00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.850\nresponsibilities with an IT security,\nwell I can sum that up in one word.\n\n26\n00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.760\nEverybody.\n\n27\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.000\nYou know everyone's got\na role in IT security.\n\n28\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.020\nWe've all got our parts to play and\n\n29\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.595\nI know that sounds a little bit like\nsome sort of motivational speech.\n\n30\n00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:27.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's true though.\n\n31\n00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.860\n&gt;&gt; I don't tend to go in for\nthese motivational speeches very much and\n\n32\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.280\nI don't like to use the cliches.\n\n33\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.710\nBut it's very, very true.\n\n34\n00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.250\nEveryone's got a part to\nplay in IT security and\n\n35\n00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.010\nif we\n&gt;&gt; One person just fails\n\n36\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.980\nwithin IT security can compromise\nthe entire organization.\n\n37\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.640\n&gt;&gt; The cliche that comes to my mind,\n\n38\n00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.900\nyou're only as strong as your weakest\nlink, and that is exactly right here.\n\n39\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is with security.\n\n40\n00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.190\nSo let's take a look then at the type\nof controls we might want to\n\n41\n00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.150\nimpose on our data itself.\n\n42\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.010\nSo we've got a slide here that looks\nat sort of, preventative control,\n\n43\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.600\nactually preventing people from\ngetting access to our data or\n\n44\n00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.610\nreductive control that reduces\nthe impact of any security bleach.\n\n45\n00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.750\nDetective controls in other words\nis those controls that sit there\n\n46\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.700\nmanagement we monitor security.\n\n47\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.310\nRepressive controls that actually sort\nwill lock certain access completely.\n\n48\n00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.270\nCorrective controls, well that's where we\n\n49\n00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.090\nput something back to how it was\nbefore because something's happened.\n\n50\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.555\nWe can implement security measures\nwith absolutely any stage.\n\n51\n00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:38.945\nI mean, take a look at the incident\non the left hand side there.\n\n52\n00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:42.985\nA security incident, we detect a threat,\nwe raise the incident,\n\n53\n00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:46.735\nwe do damage control,\nwhatever that damage control may be, and\n\n54\n00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:48.915\nwe ensure that it doesn't happen again.\n\n55\n00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:50.015\nSo we fix it.\n\n56\n00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:55.190\nWe ensure that it doesn't happen again,\nwhich is the correction and recovery.\n\n57\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.780\nIt's very simple, and that seems to\nbe very, very high level as well.\n\n58\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.490\nBecause, to be perfectly honest,\nthe management of security breaches,\n\n59\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.600\nthat's completely up to you and\nyour organization.\n\n60\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.150\nWe have to have a method,\nand a process, and\n\n61\n00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.260\na model for managing security breaches.\n\n62\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.840\nSo we should have an incident model for\nsecurity management.\n\n63\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.770\nAnd in fact, I would advise that we\nshould have more than one model for\n\n64\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.750\nsecurity management not just\na simple security management model,\n\n65\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.000\nbut you know many depending on\nthe type of security breach.\n\n66\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.060\nWe have to evaluate security for\nsecurity has to be directed by\n\n67\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.390\nour organization they will tell us\nwhat level of security they require.\n\n68\n00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.220\nIts not up to us to decide what\nlevel of security we wanted,\n\n69\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.060\nits up to them to tell us what level of\nsecurity on that data that they require.\n\n70\n00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.020\nNow I mentioned on previous\nepisode about being careful,\n\n71\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.710\nyou know being careful to be.\n\n72\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.920\nWell, not too secure\nthat you become insecure.\n\n73\n00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.320\nAnd that's a problem that we have\nwith NIT is we get quite eager and\n\n74\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.140\nquite enthusiastic about\nsecurity sometimes.\n\n75\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.400\nAnd we like to impose all of\nthese security methods and\n\n76\n00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.290\nwe put them in place and then realize\nthat actually we've become insecure.\n\n77\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.060\nJust think about simple things\nlike what we're using right now.\n\n78\n00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.470\nWe're using a camera.\n\n79\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.100\nThis camera ia on a network.\n\n80\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.900\nThis camera has an IP address.\n\n81\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.640\nWho has access to this camera?\n\n82\n00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.150\nI mean, me personally, I've got security\ncameras set up around my house.\n\n83\n00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.200\nWell, they're connected to my internet.\n\n84\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.280\nObviously, they're connected to my router.\n\n85\n00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.720\nThat means they've got an IP address.\n\n86\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.870\nThat means that without\nthe relevant security controls.\n\n87\n00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.160\nAnybody could have access to that.\n\n88\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.830\nNow, the reason why I put cameras\nup around the outside of my house,\n\n89\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.620\nis simply so that I can be secure and\nI can monitor whats going on.\n\n90\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.450\nBut actually, in doing that, have I\nbecome more insecure because now more\n\n91\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.720\npeople have access, remotely,\nto what's going on around my house.\n\n92\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.760\nIt's something that we have to think\nabout, as we implement security methods\n\n93\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.920\nall we actually making ourselves less\nsecure in the doing so, and it's a risk\n\n94\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.780\nand it's something that you will have\nto balance within your organization.\n\n95\n00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.050\n&gt;&gt; What's start off security management?\n\n96\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.400\nIt's simply a requirement for\nsecurity requirement for\n\n97\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.950\neither additional security,\nor requirement for\n\n98\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.010\ninitial security maybe we've changed\nour policy within the organization or\n\n99\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.120\nmaybe we brought in the services\nthat require new security.\n\n100\n00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.820\nThe one thing that I will tell\nyou is that security has to be\n\n101\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.930\nmentioned in your service level agreement.\n\n102\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.470\nAnd we have to have security targets\nin your service level agreement.\n\n103\n00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.620\nAnd as we've already looked\nat in our previous episode,\n\n104\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.700\nwe have to review our security methods.\n\n105\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.110\nWe have to conduct audits.\n\n106\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.310\nAnd so the results of those audits\nactually act as improvement initiatives.\n\n107\n00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.660\nSo they are inputs and triggers to\nstarting off the security process again.\n\n108\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.790\nOur business information and\n\n109\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.600\nour business requirements are the number\none input into IT security.\n\n110\n00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.560\nGovernments profiles etc.\n\n111\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.980\nRisk analysis.\n\n112\n00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.450\nOne thing that's not up there,\n\n113\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.780\nand has been up there in every\nother one about warranty processes.\n\n114\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.820\nAnd it was number five in all of there\nothers of that warranty process and input.\n\n115\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.229\nI'd like you to add in, on your notes,\nand that is financial management.\n\n116\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.850\nBecause financial information, how much\nmoney we've got to spend on security,\n\n117\n00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.640\nwill quite often determine\nthe level of security that we have.\n\n118\n00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.260\nIf we don't have enough money to spend\non security then perhaps we might\n\n119\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.530\nlook to cut corners in security.\n\n120\n00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.380\nAnd of course we then have to consider\nrisk evaluation when we do that.\n\n121\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.590\nSo, It's something that we\ndefinitely got to consider and\n\n122\n00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.270\nalso consider our suppliers and\nwho have access to our services.\n\n123\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.500\nIn one of my episodes and\n\n124\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.120\nI think it was to do with\nAvailability Management Hierarchy,\n\n125\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.980\nI mentioned that I gave na\nexample of an organization\n\n126\n00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.080\nwhere the CEO of the organization\nstated publicly.\n\n127\n00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.820\nAnd that they had absolutely\n\n128\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.880\nno way of having a security\nbleach in their organization.\n\n129\n00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.630\nThey were the most secure\norganization in the entire world and\n\n130\n00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.370\nnobody could ever bleach\ntheir security and so\n\n131\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:23.665\nthe priority Decided to employ four people\nto try and get into their IT services.\n\n132\n00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:27.555\nAnd three hackers set about,\nthey sat down at the screens and\n\n133\n00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:30.411\nthey set about trying to get\ninto their infrastructure.\n\n134\n00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:34.715\nIn the meantime, though,\nI said that they employed four people, and\n\n135\n00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:38.860\nin the meantime, this fourth person,\nthey created a fake badge.\n\n136\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.600\nAnd they arrived on site.\n\n137\n00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.869\nAnd just simply asked for access to server\nroom because, apparently the server\n\n138\n00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:52.228\nhad called home, and a call back to the\nmanufacturer and said there was an issue.\n\n139\n00:07:52.228 --> 00:07:57.625\nAnd you know what That person was\nallowed straight into the server room,\n\n140\n00:07:57.625 --> 00:07:59.530\ninto a secure area.\n\n141\n00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:06.420\nAnd that person then proceeded\nto lay a little clue.\n\n142\n00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.620\nYou're not quite as\ninfallible as you think.\n\n143\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.990\nAnd that's something that when it\ncomes to the inputs of IT security.\n\n144\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.270\nThe last bullet point down there,\n\n145\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.200\nnumber seven, talks about the details\nabout partner and suppliers requirements.\n\n146\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.250\nQuite often our service will\nphone home home as it were.\n\n147\n00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.540\nWhenever they have an issue.\n\n148\n00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.060\nIf they do that Then what\naccess do our suppliers have?\n\n149\n00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.020\nNot just to our data, but\nto our physical environment as well.\n\n150\n00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.340\nIt's something that we have to consider.\n\n151\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.780\nThat if we're going to allow\nthe servers to phone home and\n\n152\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.560\nreport, then do we automatically\nallow then the engineers to come to\n\n153\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.400\nfix any potential hardware problems?\n\n154\n00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.480\nDo we automatically allow\nthem access to our sites?\n\n155\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.410\nSometimes we do, and\nsometimes that's a security breach.\n\n156\n00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.090\nAnd I will say that\nthese security breaches\n\n157\n00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.940\nare most commonly found in the areas\nthat we don't think to look in.\n\n158\n00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.520\nThe areas where we have\nstuff that may be performing\n\n159\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.930\nroles that maybe are maintenance roles,\nmaybe our janitorial type roles.\n\n160\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:14.190\nWhere, we don't ever think about the fact\nthat actually they could be working for\n\n161\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.870\nsomebody else.\n\n162\n00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.150\nThey could be working for a third party.\n\n163\n00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.320\nSo, security has to apply to everybody.\n\n164\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.580\nAnd that's one of the key\nprinciples of security.\n\n165\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.350\nIt's not just for a certain few.\n\n166\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.810\nIt's not just for those that have\naccess to our infrastructure.\n\n167\n00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.440\nThrough APC, or through a laptop.\n\n168\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.580\nSecurity controls have to\napply to absolutely everybody.\n\n169\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.260\nI mean, no offense to my daughter,\nbut my daughter has a,\n\n170\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.440\nwell I should say no offense to me, cuz my\ndaughter has a much better understanding\n\n171\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.490\nof the technical requirements\nof IT than I ever hope to have.\n\n172\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.220\nAnd in fact when she\nwas a very small child,\n\n173\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.265\nshe would be able to operate a DVD long\nbefore I'd even got it out of the box.\n\n174\n00:09:53.265 --> 00:09:54.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because these days they're brilliant\n\n175\n00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.710\nwhen it comes to that.\n\n176\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:01.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I mean, you've got, your\nkids are making videos etc., and then.\n\n177\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:06.100\nThey're doing things that we would\nnever even considered of doing, so.\n\n178\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.916\nYou can't assume that certain people\ndon't have [CROSSTALK] It's very arrogant\n\n179\n00:10:10.916 --> 00:10:11.918\nto assume that.\n\n180\n00:10:11.918 --> 00:10:15.197\nYou can't assume that the people\ndon't have certain skills.\n\n181\n00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:17.720\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Because everybody's got a cell phone\n\n182\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.320\nand there's an app on a cell phone\nto do absolutely everything.\n\n183\n00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.620\nSo, think about then in security, look at\nour outputs at what comes out of security.\n\n184\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.320\nOur IT Security policy should\nbe up there as number one.\n\n185\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.860\nOkay, that's what everybody\nshould have access to.\n\n186\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.400\nAnd as I've said in the previous episode,\n\n187\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.580\nthere should be no ambiguity as to\nwhether you've breached security or not.\n\n188\n00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.200\nIt's not about this feeling that you get\nto say, I think I'm doing something wrong.\n\n189\n00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.140\nYou know that you're\ndoing something wrong and\n\n190\n00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.970\nit should be documented what's right and\nwhat's wrong.\n\n191\n00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.430\nWe should also be conducting\nregular audits and\n\n192\n00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:56.530\ntherefore the output of those audits\nhave reports and our assessments, etc.\n\n193\n00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.250\nAnd that's an output from security.\n\n194\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.280\nWe should also be testing\nsecurity as well.\n\n195\n00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.070\nAnd number five talks about test\nschedules, penetration tests,\n\n196\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.670\netc., and reports are breached and\nthird party management\n\n197\n00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.630\nDo we bring in a third party to come and\nactually test our security?\n\n198\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.660\nYou know what, it's a great idea and\n\n199\n00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.330\nI would encourage a lot of\norganizations to do that.\n\n200\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.540\nBecause there are companies out there\nthat will specifically come and\n\n201\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.210\ntest your security.\n\n202\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.580\nAnd trust me,\nthey can get into your infrastructure,\n\n203\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.160\nthey can get into your building\nWays that you never even though of.\n\n204\n00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.080\n&gt;&gt; Especially like even, when people\nhave said hey, is this possible?\n\n205\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.670\nEven when it comes to technologies or\nprotocols or something like that.\n\n206\n00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.220\nAnd I said don't ever like to use\nthe word no, because you never know.\n\n207\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.080\nThere's always something that could\nbe invented or could be hacked or\n\n208\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.510\ncould be done that like you had\nmentioned we just havent thought of yet.\n\n209\n00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:53.760\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n[LAUGH] I like to play to cultural biases.\n\n210\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes.\n\n211\n00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.850\nAnd it works great here in\nthe States with my accent.\n\n212\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.650\nIt really does because you would be\nsurprise what an English accent will\n\n213\n00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:03.945\nget you here in the States.\n\n214\n00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:05.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In terms of IT security,\n\n215\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.850\nand I have highlighted,\nI've been on site in a lot of organization\n\n216\n00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.450\n&gt;&gt; Where I have done exactly and\n\n217\n00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.900\nI've highlighted breaches.\n\n218\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.990\nAnd because I woke up to somebody in\na very sort of authoritative way, and\n\n219\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.490\nI'll just woke up to somebody say,\ncould you give me access to this please?\n\n220\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.670\nYou'll be surprise how many people and\nI'm talking about secure organizations,\n\n221\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.660\nI'm talking about banks and other types,\n\n222\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.240\nmedical facilities where\nthey've simply just let me in.\n\n223\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.480\n&gt;&gt; Because I sound as though\nI've got the authority and\n\n224\n00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.210\nI sound as though I should be there.\n\n225\n00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:39.440\nI mean, how can you sound as though you\nshould be there and I'm able to do that.\n\n226\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.250\n&gt;&gt; Well it obviously works, as you look\nat different types of social engineering\n\n227\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.440\ntechniques, authority and\nintimidation, urgency.\n\n228\n00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.300\nThose are all something that they work,\nthat's why people keep doing them.\n\n229\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.080\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah, and we've exposed, I managed\nto expose security breaches in a lot of\n\n230\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.530\norganizations in that way,\njust by simply walking into a building.\n\n231\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.320\nAnd people will say to me,\nit's because of the accent, and\n\n232\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.610\nI think that's got something to do\nwith it, it's because of the accent.\n\n233\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.540\nBut nevertheless All of\nthese sort of things,\n\n234\n00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.390\nthat's part of security considerations.\n\n235\n00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.030\nAnd that needs to be picked up.\n\n236\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.470\nJust because somebody's got a British\naccent doesn't mean that you should\n\n237\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.985\nautomatically trust them, and\nyou should automatically let them in.\n\n238\n00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:17.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean come off it,\n\n239\n00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.090\nlook at Hollywood, right?\n\n240\n00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.340\nWe play all the villains!\n\n241\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.842\nDon't you get this, right?\n\n242\n00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:21.381\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n243\n00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:22.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm in.\n\n244\n00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.420\nSo, let's take a look\nat our relationships.\n\n245\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.280\nYou know what?\n\n246\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.040\nI'm not gonna look at all of these\nindividually, because, what I will say is,\n\n247\n00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.830\nthat, absolutely, every single process\nneeds to consider the security.\n\n248\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.900\nThat's it.\nWe've already talked about financial\n\n249\n00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.840\nmanagement, and we've talked\nabout all of the other processes,\n\n250\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.500\nin our previous episode,\nand in this process,\n\n251\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.740\nincluding service level management\n&gt;&gt; Access management, don't forget,\n\n252\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:51.150\nwell they actually fulfill the security\npolicy in that they grant access and\n\n253\n00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.590\nthey take it away.\n\n254\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.660\nBut in terms of all of\nthe other processes,\n\n255\n00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.870\nwell, we've actually looked at those in\nour previous episode in a lot more detail.\n\n256\n00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:07.000\nJust bear in mind right at the very bottom\nof the screen where it says legal and HR.\n\n257\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.590\n&gt;&gt; Depending on your organization, you're\ngoing to have legal requirements for\n\n258\n00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.060\nsecurity.\n\n259\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.650\nIt doesn't just depend\non the organization.\n\n260\n00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.020\nIt also depends on your culture and\nyour country as well.\n\n261\n00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.760\nAnd in certain parts of the world in\nEurope for instance we've go very,\n\n262\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.730\nvery strict data protection laws that\nprohibit the sharing of any personal data\n\n263\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.020\nincluding things like cell phones and\naddresses and that sort of thing.\n\n264\n00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.290\nSo different countries will\nhave different regulations and\n\n265\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.360\ndifferent legal requirements\nIn terms of data protection.\n\n266\n00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.510\nSo you need to be aware that if you're\nin an international organization,\n\n267\n00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.480\nthat those discrepancies exist.\n\n268\n00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.890\nAnd so\nyou have to find a way to get around them.\n\n269\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.365\nWhat most organizations will\ndo is any [INAUDIBLE] policy\n\n270\n00:14:50.365 --> 00:14:53.375\nthat is a legal requirement\nin one country.\n\n271\n00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:56.505\nWell they'll take the strictness\nlegal requirement and\n\n272\n00:14:56.505 --> 00:15:00.925\nthen they will impose that as an ethical\npolicy around the organization as a whole.\n\n273\n00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:06.568\nAnd that certainly is the most\nefficient way of managing IT Security.\n\n274\n00:15:06.568 --> 00:15:10.150\nNow I've already mentioned right at the\nvery start in this that in terms of roles\n\n275\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.820\nand responsibilities, well, this should\nbe a very quick one because we've all got\n\n276\n00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.730\na responsibility for security.\n\n277\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:20.830\nSure, we're gonna have somebody who's\ngoing to take ownership of security, and\n\n278\n00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.460\nthat person will be responsible for\ncommunication, they'll be responsible for\n\n279\n00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.260\nthe plan.\n\n280\n00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.410\nThey'll be responsible for identifying\nwhat is considered to be a security breach\n\n281\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.850\nand they will be responsible for\nensuring that audits, etcetera, happen.\n\n282\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.289\nBut then we all have a responsibility for\nsecurity.\n\n283\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.340\nWe all have to take that responsibility\nto ensure that we've maintained CIA.\n\n284\n00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.603\nThat we're not giving out our\npassword to anybody else.\n\n285\n00:15:48.603 --> 00:15:52.590\nThat we're not allowing our third\nparties either access to something that\n\n286\n00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.448\nthey shouldn't have access to, or\nwe're giving them our password, or\n\n287\n00:15:56.448 --> 00:16:00.939\nwe're just letting them through a door for\nWe have that security manager, the owner\n\n288\n00:16:00.939 --> 00:16:04.753\nof IT security that acts as a focal\npoint for all of our security issues.\n\n289\n00:16:04.753 --> 00:16:07.107\nBut think about the involvement\nwith our service desk.\n\n290\n00:16:07.107 --> 00:16:12.750\nService desk need to be able to log all\nsecurity breaches as incidents, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:17.700\nWe need to record all incidents and\nall breaches of security.\n\n292\n00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.110\nAnd security is not just\nabout virus protection.\n\n293\n00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:26.022\nSecurity is about the physical security\nas well as virtual security too.\n\n294\n00:16:26.022 --> 00:16:30.510\nOne of the biggest challenges is\nthe overview of concept of security.\n\n295\n00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:35.130\nAnd then as I've already said, becoming so\nsecure that we become insecure.\n\n296\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.400\nAnd security's quite often seen\nas a responsibility of IT.\n\n297\n00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.450\nAnd IT is seen as being a complete\npain when it comes to security,\n\n298\n00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.150\nbecause we impose these draconian\nmeasures that they say.\n\n299\n00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:51.850\nWell, let's go back to episode one\nin IT security, and look at what\n\n300\n00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:57.990\nwe did with our process itself, where we\nactually created an awareness campaign.\n\n301\n00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.890\nEverybody should be aware why\nsecurity measures are in place.\n\n302\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.340\nThis is not just something that we\nwant to impose cuz we feel like it.\n\n303\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.890\nIt's something that we need to do\nbecause we need to maintain security for\n\n304\n00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.110\nthe organization.\n\n305\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.600\nSo we have to market our security policy.\n\n306\n00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.720\nIn IT we're traditionally not\nvery good at marketing ourselves,\n\n307\n00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.910\nwe're not very good at selling ourselves.\n\n308\n00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.710\nWe are really good at sort of laying\ndown the law and imposing regulations,\n\n309\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.940\nbut we're not very good at actually\njustifying why we're doing it and\n\n310\n00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.900\nmarketing ourselves.\n\n311\n00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.280\nAnd so we need to get back to that.\n\n312\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:35.080\nWe need to ensure that we've got\nthe right security levels in place.\n\n313\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.980\nAnd we need to ensure that\neverybody considers security.\n\n314\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.670\nIt's an integral part, as it says up\nthere on that slide, of our IT services.\n\n315\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.490\nBut we also need to ensure that everybody\ntakes ownership of IT security.\n\n316\n00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.560\nAnd then as a challenge,\nbusiness support is mentioned, but\n\n317\n00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.030\nalso let's take a look at the lack\nof business support as a risk.\n\n318\n00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.140\nWithout that business support,\nwell, it's gotta be ongoing.\n\n319\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.770\nIt's gotta be something that they have to\n\n320\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.440\ncarry on supporting this\nthroughout the life of IT.\n\n321\n00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.840\nBecause otherwise,\nthere are gonna be security breaches.\n\n322\n00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.490\nAnd you know what,\n\n323\n00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.100\nif there are security breaches,\nit's the organization that suffers.\n\n324\n00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.650\nIt's not just IT,\nit's the entire organization.\n\n325\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.730\nSo we can't just be focused on IT.\n\n326\n00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:23.630\nThe business has got a tendency to\nkind of give us their requirements and\n\n327\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.194\nthen walk away and leave it.\n\n328\n00:18:25.194 --> 00:18:31.050\nBut ultimately we've all got to\nassume that responsibility for IT.\n\n329\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:36.070\nWe have got to understand\nthat IT's no longer\n\n330\n00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:40.340\nthat sort of necessary evil that it used\nto be considered many, many years ago.\n\n331\n00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.960\nIT is actually an integral\npart of everything that we do.\n\n332\n00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.020\n&gt;&gt; Even if the employee doesn't\nhave direct access to a PC.\n\n333\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.435\nI mean, if you think about even,\nlike you said, coming in and\n\n334\n00:18:50.435 --> 00:18:54.654\nallowing that access maybe it's an after\nhours janitor or security guard.\n\n335\n00:18:54.654 --> 00:18:58.849\nAnd maybe they don't use a computer for\nthat janitorial type role but\n\n336\n00:18:58.849 --> 00:19:03.950\nthey still have to adhere, like you said,\neveryone is equally as important here.\n\n337\n00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.551\n&gt;&gt; When we think about security,\nwe quite often consider the obvious,\n\n338\n00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:11.820\nthe viruses, the malware,\nthe spyware, etc.\n\n339\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.593\nAnd in fact, just last week in\nan organization where I was,\n\n340\n00:19:16.593 --> 00:19:21.366\nI had somebody whose close\nfamily member was unfortunately\n\n341\n00:19:21.366 --> 00:19:25.675\nthe victim of one of these\nsort of malware companies.\n\n342\n00:19:25.675 --> 00:19:28.850\nWhere the message pops up on the screen,\nyou need to call this number.\n\n343\n00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.883\nAnd sure enough, they call the number and\nthe next thing you know they're handing\n\n344\n00:19:32.883 --> 00:19:35.231\nover security details or\ncredit card details.\n\n345\n00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:40.310\nBecause apparently they've got\n5,000 viruses on their PC.\n\n346\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:44.230\nI've had family members that have\nbeen affected like that as well.\n\n347\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.490\nAnd so we think of that as\nthe obvious security threat.\n\n348\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.660\nBut we forget about the fact that\nthe person that we held the door open for\n\n349\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.750\nthis morning as we walked into the office,\neven though we didn't know them,\n\n350\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.040\nwe just simply said,\npolitely, hello, how are you?\n\n351\n00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.070\nAnd we let them in.\n\n352\n00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And they're just as much of a threat as\n\n353\n00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.050\nany message that might\npop up on our screen.\n\n354\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.783\nUltimately, security is\ngoing to be down to you, and\n\n355\n00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:11.080\nit's gonna be down to your organization.\n\n356\n00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.319\nAnd I can't tell you how\nto implement security,\n\n357\n00:20:14.319 --> 00:20:17.803\nI can tell you that we need\nto have security in place.\n\n358\n00:20:17.803 --> 00:20:24.963\nI can tell you to look at frameworks and\ninternational standards like ISO 27002.\n\n359\n00:20:24.963 --> 00:20:27.168\nAnd in fact,\nat the end of the last episode,\n\n360\n00:20:27.168 --> 00:20:30.399\nthat's exactly what I told you to do,\nto do a lot more research.\n\n361\n00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.400\nNow at the end of this episode\nin your downloadable material,\n\n362\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.890\nyou have some exercises on security.\n\n363\n00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.750\nAnd they're designed to make you think and\nI want to make you think.\n\n364\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.320\nCertainly, when it comes\nto the real world and\n\n365\n00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.210\nwhen it comes to your ITIL test, then\nyou're going to get questions on security.\n\n366\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.550\nAnd security, you have to remember,\n\n367\n00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.760\nsecurity is an integral part in\nabsolutely everything that we do.\n\n368\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.650\nSo even though you might get\na question in your test about, say,\n\n369\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.640\navailability management, you better\nconsider security in that, okay?\n\n370\n00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.020\nSo security has to be in\neverything that you do.\n\n371\n00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.200\nSo for now, what I'd like you to\ndo is I would like you to go and\n\n372\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.590\ndownload the material\nthat's available to you.\n\n373\n00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.100\nI'd like you to undertake\nthe exercises and\n\n374\n00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.440\nremember all of your other processes,\nas well.\n\n375\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.750\nYou have to bring them into consideration.\n\n376\n00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.450\nAnd if you do have any questions or\nany queries, then as always,\n\n377\n00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.540\nfind me on the forum and I will be happy\nto answer any questions that you may have.\n\n378\n00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.790\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Jo, great advice.\n\n379\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.660\nYou're always keeping security in the back\nof your mind, or the front of your mind,\n\n380\n00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.910\nhowever you wanna think about it.\n\n381\n00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.170\nBut just think about it.\n\n382\n00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.080\nBut we are out of time for this show,\nso we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n383\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.540\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n384\n00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.370\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:06.593\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:08.503\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:12.119\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.924\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen\nto your ITIL Intermediate Series.\n\n8\n00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:15.540\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.250\nIn this episode we'll be taking\na look at service design activities.\n\n10\n00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.510\nAnd back with us today in the studios\nwe have ITIL expert Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.010\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.460\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.160\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.020\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful.\n\n15\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.241\nYou look great, nice and\nbright and beautiful as always.\n\n16\n00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:37.149\nSo, let's take some of that brightness and\n\n17\n00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.777\n[LAUGH] bring it on in to our\nservice design activities.\n\n18\n00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:44.920\n&gt;&gt; I think she's actually feeling\na lot brighter than I look.\n\n19\n00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.200\nJust wanna put that out there right now.\n\n20\n00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.157\n&gt;&gt; It's these bright lights.\n\n21\n00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:50.043\nI think they fried my brain or\nsomething like that.\n\n22\n00:00:50.043 --> 00:00:55.235\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I didn't have any brain\ncells to start with so that's okay.\n\n23\n00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:56.965\nYou're much ahead of me.\n\n24\n00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:58.684\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou're gonna have to take this time.\n\n25\n00:00:58.684 --> 00:01:00.605\nWell, you're gonna have to,\nlike I'm holding you hostage.\n\n26\n00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:03.915\nTo explain to us the activities\nthat we need to know for the exam.\n\n27\n00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:05.007\nBecause you know what?\n\n28\n00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:06.874\nI can't tell everyone, so that's what.\n\n29\n00:01:06.874 --> 00:01:11.980\n[LAUGH] The lights have fried my brain so\nI need you, Jo.\n\n30\n00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.850\nOkay then, fair enough.\n\n31\n00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.943\nBut you know there are laws against this.\n\n32\n00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.560\nPutting that out there right now.\n\n33\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.050\n&gt;&gt; We'll let you leave when\nwe pass the exam, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.110\n&gt;&gt; If you see me mouth help into\nthe camera, then please come rescue me.\n\n35\n00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.010\nIn this particular session,\n\n36\n00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.910\nwhat we're actually going to do is we're\ngoing to take a look at the, we're gonna\n\n37\n00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.200\nstart to take a look at the activities\nthat we perform in service design.\n\n38\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.230\nNow, way back at the beginning in\nour first episode in service design,\n\n39\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.480\nwe looked at the concept of the fact that\ndesign is all about the operational side\n\n40\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.010\nof the project, as it were.\n\n41\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.240\nSo, in service strategy,\nwe had our business case approved.\n\n42\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.550\nAnd it was at that point in time\nwhen the project was started.\n\n43\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.570\nAnd then this is when design\ncoordination as a process takes over\n\n44\n00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.310\nfrom an operational standpoint.\n\n45\n00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.760\nWe do not takeover project management,\nabsolutely not.\n\n46\n00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.620\nOf course, there is a huge\nintegration with project management.\n\n47\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.000\nI mean just look at\nthe DevOps movement itself.\n\n48\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.742\nThat's exactly what we support.\n\n49\n00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:13.550\nAnd in fact it's exactly\nwhat we work towards.\n\n50\n00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.230\nBut projecting, they look at\nthe design requirements for the actual\n\n51\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.830\nnew service itself or for the update,\nthe change to any existing service.\n\n52\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.330\nHere in IT service management, in ITIL,\nwe're looking at the operational side.\n\n53\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.248\nSo we're looking at things\nspecifically like service levels.\n\n54\n00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:34.810\nWe're looking at\navailability requirements.\n\n55\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.070\nWe're looking at actually,\ndesigning all of the tools and\n\n56\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.440\nall of the techniques that we need to\nbe able to manage any new service.\n\n57\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.890\nWe acknowledge that there\nare functional requirements.\n\n58\n00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.780\nBut we also acknowledge that\nthose functional requirements,\n\n59\n00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.160\nwell, they're addressed\nby the project team.\n\n60\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.480\nAnd so here in our ITIL environment,\nwhat we do is we\n\n61\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.140\ndesign our management techniques and\nour management activities and\n\n62\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.880\nhow we're going to operate\nthe service on a live environment.\n\n63\n00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.790\nSo what we're interested in is we work\ntogether with project management to\n\n64\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.400\ndocument our user requirements and\nour business requirements to find out\n\n65\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.180\nwhat they want and\nhow they're going to work with that.\n\n66\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.500\nThat also includes not just\nworking with our project team, but\n\n67\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.900\nalso working with service asset and\nconfiguration management for\n\n68\n00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.280\ninstance, understanding our\ncurrent environment and\n\n69\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.080\nwhat the changes are going to be to\nour current environment and looking at\n\n70\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.029\nwhat we need to do in order to get\nthe support right for our new service.\n\n71\n00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.770\nSo we need to have a design coordination\nprocess that's going to act as that.\n\n72\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.640\nWell, it says repository of\nindividual requirements for\n\n73\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.290\neach individual new service.\n\n74\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.350\nBut I'm not just looking\nat having a repository.\n\n75\n00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.550\nI'm looking at somebody who will work\nclosely with project management.\n\n76\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.110\nAnd again, think DevOps.\n\n77\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.500\nThis should not be done in isolation.\n\n78\n00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.090\nWe've got three different\ntypes of requirement.\n\n79\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.740\nWe've got the functional\nrequirements which as I said,\n\n80\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.600\nthey're going to be looked\nat in the project team.\n\n81\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.600\nThen we've got our\noperational requirements and\n\n82\n00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.170\nour management requirements.\n\n83\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.700\nAnd that's how are we going to\nmanage those services going forward.\n\n84\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.980\nAnd then there's the usability\nrequirements going forward as well.\n\n85\n00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.180\nHow easy is it for us to do that?\n\n86\n00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.690\nIt's not just about what the service does.\n\n87\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.200\nIt's about how it does it and\nhow we deliver that service as well.\n\n88\n00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.860\nThat's really important.\n\n89\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.190\nBecause you see,\nright at the very start of any project,\n\n90\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.020\nway back in the service strategy we've\ncome up with this idea for a new service.\n\n91\n00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.624\nAnd now we've started a new project.\n\n92\n00:04:40.624 --> 00:04:44.255\nAnd that project will define\nthe functional requirements for\n\n93\n00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:45.870\nthat particular service.\n\n94\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.750\nBut we've gotta consider\nthe service throughout its life.\n\n95\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.890\nHow long is that life going to be?\n\n96\n00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.620\nWhat is its expected end date?\n\n97\n00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:59.370\nBearing in mind that, in service strategy,\nwe looked at the concept of value and\n\n98\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.970\nthe fact that value diminishes over time.\n\n99\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.434\nAnd here we are, trying to design the\noperational side of any new service for\n\n100\n00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:10.551\nthe life of that service,\nunderstanding that it's going to change,\n\n101\n00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:13.448\nunderstanding that value\nis going to diminish.\n\n102\n00:05:13.448 --> 00:05:18.060\nAnd therefore we're gonna have to change\nthe functionality requirements perhaps.\n\n103\n00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.550\nWe're going to have to\nchange the usability and\n\n104\n00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.760\nmaybe even the operational requirements.\n\n105\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.690\nWhat we monitored in event management\nat the very start of a new service\n\n106\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.100\nwhen it first was launched is completely\ndifferent to what we monitor,\n\n107\n00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.420\nperhaps, ten years down the line,\nfor instance.\n\n108\n00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.372\nNow, I'm not saying that we have\nall of our services for ten years.\n\n109\n00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:42.500\nBut I know some that are out there, in the\nbig wide world, that have been there for\n\n110\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.129\nten years.\n\n111\n00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.270\nAnd some organizations see no\nneed to change those services.\n\n112\n00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.600\nMaybe those services have been\nsubject to upgrade, but that's it.\n\n113\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.040\nBut then that still means that\nthe operational requirements and\n\n114\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.020\nthe usability requirements have changed.\n\n115\n00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.790\nSo when we're designing these management\nand these operational requirements,\n\n116\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.250\nwe've got to look at\nthe manageability of the service.\n\n117\n00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.240\nDoes it run?\n\n118\n00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.600\nHow does it fail?\n\n119\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.990\nWhere is it likely to fail?\n\n120\n00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.930\nRemember, in availability management we're\nlooking at the single points of failure.\n\n121\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.270\nWe're concerned with efficiency and\neffectiveness.\n\n122\n00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.670\nWe're concerned with availability,\nreliability, and resilience, and\n\n123\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.220\ncapacity, and security, as well.\n\n124\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.964\nWe've already looked at these processes.\n\n125\n00:06:22.964 --> 00:06:29.030\nSo what we're just outlining in in this\nparticular section in this episode and\n\n126\n00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.820\nin our subsequent episode, we're looking\nat the types of activities that we might\n\n127\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.750\ndo, either as part of these processes or\n\n128\n00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.920\nas part of those five aspects of\nservice design that we highlighted\n\n129\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.180\nway back in one of our introductory\nepisodes to service design.\n\n130\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.730\nThink about things like\nthe installation of a service.\n\n131\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.510\nWhat about the level of continuity,\ncontinuity as opposed to recovery?\n\n132\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.670\nWhat about the controllability\nof a service?\n\n133\n00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.850\nAnd I'm not just talking about security.\n\n134\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.910\nI'm talking about whose going\nto control the service.\n\n135\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.670\nWhose gonna schedule backups?\n\n136\n00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.542\nWho's going to monitor the backups?\n\n137\n00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:04.827\nWho's gonna schedule any jobs?\n\n138\n00:07:04.827 --> 00:07:06.650\nWho's going to monitor them?\n\n139\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.710\nAnd who's going to be able to\nfix something if it goes wrong?\n\n140\n00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.980\nAnd what about reporting?\n\n141\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.580\nDo we leave that to CSI or is that done\nin the individual process area, for\n\n142\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.290\ninstance in event management?\n\n143\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.130\nYou know, all of this we've got to decide.\n\n144\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.800\nSo how do we decide?\n\n145\n00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.155\nHow do we gather these requirements?\n\n146\n00:07:26.155 --> 00:07:29.440\nWell, a multitude of different\nways to gathering requirements.\n\n147\n00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.250\nBut ultimately,\nthey all involve talking to people.\n\n148\n00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:38.550\nSo we could use something like a workshop\ntechnique, where we discuss our issues and\n\n149\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.710\nelicit these requirements and\nsometimes extract them.\n\n150\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.100\nA workshop needs a good facilitator.\n\n151\n00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.882\nIt's dependent on getting\nthe right stakeholders involved.\n\n152\n00:07:46.882 --> 00:07:51.639\nBut you need to have a good facilitator\nthat has enough of a technical background\n\n153\n00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.479\nto be able to extract\ninformation from people,\n\n154\n00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:58.035\nespecially from people like\na organization, a business.\n\n155\n00:07:58.035 --> 00:08:01.280\nWho are not technical people, per se.\n\n156\n00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.258\nAnd therefore we've gotta be able to\nextract the right information from\n\n157\n00:08:06.258 --> 00:08:11.330\nthem that we can then use to define\nour operational requirements.\n\n158\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.910\nYou can't just ask a direct question.\n\n159\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.920\nAsking a direct question like,\ndo you want a full backup or do you want\n\n160\n00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.809\nan incremental backup is always going to\nelicit the response of, what do you mean?\n\n161\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.990\nSo instead of asking that,\nwhat you might want to say is,\n\n162\n00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.970\ndo you wanna back up everything or do you\njust want to back up those things that\n\n163\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.000\nhave been changed overnight or\nduring the day?\n\n164\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.430\nSo forget the terms.\nThat's why we need to have\n\n165\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.468\na good facilitator for\nany workshop environment.\n\n166\n00:08:36.468 --> 00:08:39.879\nBecause you have to be able to speak\nthe language of your audience.\n\n167\n00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.420\nAnd that's a theme that I\nput throughout every single\n\n168\n00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.120\nITIL session is that any communications\ngotta be in the language of the audience.\n\n169\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.460\nI have to talk to you in your language.\n\n170\n00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.690\nNow, I don't know you personally, so\nhow do I talk to you in your language?\n\n171\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.700\nWell, I'm gonna talk in a very generic\nlanguage because I really don't\n\n172\n00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:06.520\nunderstand, or I don't know, what your\nenvironment looks like, technically.\n\n173\n00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.910\nSo I can't make any assumptions.\n\n174\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.340\nSo I will talk to you in your language,\nand in this case, a very generic language.\n\n175\n00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.840\nBut the facilitator for any workshop has\ngot to talk to the audience in a language\n\n176\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.160\nthat they understand.\n\n177\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.943\nThere are other techniques as well.\n\n178\n00:09:20.943 --> 00:09:24.260\nObservation, I love observation.\n\n179\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.972\nIf you ask a direct question,\nyou'll get a direct answer.\n\n180\n00:09:26.972 --> 00:09:29.636\nBut you never actually get the full truth.\n\n181\n00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:32.489\nI'm not telling you\nthat people lie to you.\n\n182\n00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.639\nI'm telling you that\npeople make assumptions.\n\n183\n00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:37.329\nAnd this is really [LAUGH]\nbad when it comes to IT.\n\n184\n00:09:37.329 --> 00:09:41.703\nIf I asked Cherokee, now,\nyou're kind of a different beast,\n\n185\n00:09:41.703 --> 00:09:44.683\nCherokee, because you're an IT person.\n\n186\n00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:46.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n187\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.380\n&gt;&gt; If I ask you how you send an email,\njust tell me how you send an email.\n\n188\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.511\n&gt;&gt; With a computer.\n\n189\n00:09:52.511 --> 00:09:57.537\n[LAUGH] I was trying to\nbe the average end user.\n\n190\n00:09:57.537 --> 00:09:59.387\nDo you want me to go all technical here?\n\n191\n00:09:59.387 --> 00:10:02.402\n&gt;&gt; And that's an average end user.\n\n192\n00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:06.085\nI think that we normally get a little\nbit more information than that.\n\n193\n00:10:06.085 --> 00:10:06.989\n&gt;&gt; More information than that?\nOkay.\n\n194\n00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:08.568\n&gt;&gt; From an average end user.\n\n195\n00:10:08.568 --> 00:10:11.438\nNormally, it's something\nalong the lines of,\n\n196\n00:10:11.438 --> 00:10:16.349\nwell, I log on and then I hit, you know,\nthat button in the top left-hand corner.\n\n197\n00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:19.917\nAnd then I type it and send it but,\nhey, with a computer works.\n\n198\n00:10:19.917 --> 00:10:22.428\nIt wasn't a joke by the way.\n\n199\n00:10:22.428 --> 00:10:24.584\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway.\n\n200\n00:10:24.584 --> 00:10:26.142\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Moving on.\n\n201\n00:10:26.142 --> 00:10:29.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The fact is that you are gonna get\n\n202\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.870\nsort of information like that,\nand what does that mean?\n\n203\n00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.789\nWhen we're defining something, when we're\ndesigning [LAUGH] a new service in IT and\n\n204\n00:10:37.789 --> 00:10:40.800\nwhen we're designing our new requirements,\nwe have to know the,\n\n205\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.386\nwhat we call the moments of truth.\n\n206\n00:10:42.386 --> 00:10:44.899\nWe have to understand\nthe customer experience.\n\n207\n00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:49.324\nWe have to know all the contact points\nthat a particular user has with our\n\n208\n00:10:49.324 --> 00:10:50.640\nservice.\n\n209\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.347\nSo here in IT, we're gonna sit and\nwe're actually going to watch Cherokee.\n\n210\n00:10:54.347 --> 00:10:59.030\n&gt;&gt; Wait, I forgot about my iPad and\nmy cellphone, my smart watch and\n\n211\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.405\nall that too, so.\n\n212\n00:11:00.405 --> 00:11:04.577\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'd just like to know when the\nlast time she sent an email with her smart\n\n213\n00:11:04.577 --> 00:11:05.805\nwatch was but anyway.\n\n214\n00:11:05.805 --> 00:11:08.397\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Carrying on,\n\n215\n00:11:08.397 --> 00:11:13.444\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sit\nwith Cherokee, and I'm gonna watch.\n\n216\n00:11:13.444 --> 00:11:15.898\nAnd I'm gonna write down all\nof these moments of truth.\n\n217\n00:11:15.898 --> 00:11:19.573\nSo I'm actually gonna write down\nthe fact that she turned her laptop on.\n\n218\n00:11:19.573 --> 00:11:22.504\nAnd she used this button\nto turn her laptop on and\n\n219\n00:11:22.504 --> 00:11:25.100\nthen her laptop connected to the Wi-Fi.\n\n220\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:31.110\nAnd then she put in her password, and her\npassword was x amount of characters long,\n\n221\n00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.100\nbecause that was the password requirement.\n\n222\n00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.880\nAnd then she selected this particular\nicon, and then she went and\n\n223\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.160\nshe doubled-clicked on.\n\n224\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.250\nAnd I'm going to observe\nevery single click,\n\n225\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.490\nwhich is completely different\nto what she told me.\n\n226\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.160\nAnd in this case,\n\n227\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.000\nit was completely different [LAUGH]\nto everything that she told me.\n\n228\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.800\nIt's supposed to create a better\nunderstanding of problems and\n\n229\n00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.195\ndifficulties, but\nclearly not if you ask Cherokee.\n\n230\n00:11:54.195 --> 00:11:59.550\n[LAUGH] You need to find a solution that's\ngonna be acceptable to the business.\n\n231\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.330\nAnd you're not gonna get a true\nreflection of the environment just by\n\n232\n00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.070\nasking somebody, clearly.\n\n233\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.760\n[LAUGH] Right, so\nyou have to really sit with them and\n\n234\n00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.190\nwork out exactly what they do.\n\n235\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.940\nAnd then there's the analysis technique,\n\n236\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.960\nwhich is simply just getting them to,\npretty much the same as observation,\n\n237\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.080\ngetting them to perform a task and\nthen writing down exactly what they do.\n\n238\n00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.800\nThere is a slight\ndifference between the two,\n\n239\n00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.175\nbecause the observation\ntechnique just watches.\n\n240\n00:12:24.175 --> 00:12:28.330\nAnd the observation technique doesn't\nactually ask you to perform a specific\n\n241\n00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.940\ntask, it watches the way\nthat you interact.\n\n242\n00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.927\nIn observation techniques, I expect\nto bring out requirements such as,\n\n243\n00:12:34.927 --> 00:12:36.740\nCherokee doesn't need a mouse.\n\n244\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.740\nShe doesn't need an external mouse.\n\n245\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.710\nShe works pretty well with\nthe mouse she's got, but\n\n246\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.630\nshe would benefit from a touch screen.\n\n247\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.190\nI expect observation to bring\nthat sort of element out,\n\n248\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:52.990\nwhereas a Protocol analysis is very much,\nshow me how you do x.\n\n249\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.310\nShadowing is actually trying to learn\nfrom somebody, sitting with somebody, and\n\n250\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.280\ntrying to learn.\n\n251\n00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.895\nAnd these are all very similar techniques,\nwhich is where we sit with a person.\n\n252\n00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:05.955\nBut then there's a Scenario analysis\ntechnique which is, where I would\n\n253\n00:13:05.955 --> 00:13:09.961\ngive you, and I use this a lot and\nin fact you've heard me use this a lot.\n\n254\n00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:13.624\nSo if this were to happen,\nCherokee, how would you respond?\n\n255\n00:13:13.624 --> 00:13:16.024\nAnd so I can say to her now, Cherokee,\n\n256\n00:13:16.024 --> 00:13:20.625\nif we were to get a message in our\nforum right now, how would you respond?\n\n257\n00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:24.340\n&gt;&gt; Jo, I would log into my account and\n\n258\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.380\nI would respond via my keyboard\nto that individual user.\n\n259\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.587\n&gt;&gt; Well, that was technical, wasn't it?\n\n260\n00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:34.020\nWe've come from one extreme [LAUGH] to\nthe other now in the past two [INAUDIBLE].\n\n261\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.623\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Respond with a keyboard, all right,\n\n262\n00:13:36.623 --> 00:13:37.593\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n263\n00:13:37.593 --> 00:13:42.300\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n&gt;&gt; So, I would probably be using HTTP,\n\n264\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.970\nbecause we're not setting any\nkind of secure information.\n\n265\n00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.780\nI don't have to worry about\nthat over the wire, yeah.\n\n266\n00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's exactly what I hope to pick up.\n\n267\n00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.488\nAnd to be perfectly honest, when we\nuse this scenario analysis technique,\n\n268\n00:13:54.488 --> 00:13:56.540\nwe can pick up any one of those.\n\n269\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.720\nIt depends on the user.\n\n270\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.931\nSome users are really technical like\nCherokee, and other users are not.\n\n271\n00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:04.922\nThey're like Cherokee mach one-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n272\n00:14:04.922 --> 00:14:06.264\n&gt;&gt; We have [INAUDIBLE].\n\n273\n00:14:06.264 --> 00:14:07.780\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n274\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.268\n&gt;&gt; And then there's Prototyping\ntechniques, which is the prototype,\n\n275\n00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.410\nthe, what if we do that?\n\n276\n00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.980\nWe use that to validate requirements or\n\n277\n00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.290\nwe might use that in\nconjunction with modeling.\n\n278\n00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.690\nWhat if we did this?\n\n279\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:21.940\nWould this work for you?\n\n280\n00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.747\nSome of the common problems that we have\nwhen we're doing requirement engineering\n\n281\n00:14:26.747 --> 00:14:27.905\nis that we're too rushed.\n\n282\n00:14:27.905 --> 00:14:29.126\nOr we don't have enough time.\n\n283\n00:14:29.126 --> 00:14:32.449\nMaybe I'm too rushed and so\nI don't have time to sit with Cherokee and\n\n284\n00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:34.230\nobserve what she's doing.\n\n285\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.500\nOr maybe we just don't have enough money.\n\n286\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.866\nNot enough budget means not being able to\nget on a plane and fly to that person and\n\n287\n00:14:39.866 --> 00:14:41.859\nfind out what they're doing, for instance.\n\n288\n00:14:41.859 --> 00:14:45.028\nOr maybe I don't really understand\nwhat it is I'm looking for.\n\n289\n00:14:45.028 --> 00:14:49.900\nBecause I don't know anything about this\nnew service that we're trying to design.\n\n290\n00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.685\nAnd when we talk about the apparent\ninability of the users to articulate,\n\n291\n00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.782\nyeah, [LAUGH] I know we had that.\n\n292\n00:14:56.782 --> 00:15:00.749\nBut ultimately,\nit's not an apparent inability,\n\n293\n00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:04.090\nthey know what they need to know.\n\n294\n00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:08.120\nAnd it's an inability on our\npart to understand them.\n\n295\n00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.908\nThat's where the challenge comes in\nthis is the engineering problem.\n\n296\n00:15:11.908 --> 00:15:14.702\nIt's not that they don't know\nwhat they're talking about or\n\n297\n00:15:14.702 --> 00:15:16.482\nthat they're not able to articulate.\n\n298\n00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:20.360\nIt's quite simple that they don't\nknow what it is we're asking for.\n\n299\n00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.003\nAnd if they don't know what we're asking\nfor, then quite simply they're not going\n\n300\n00:15:24.003 --> 00:15:26.120\nto be able to articulate\nthe right answer for us.\n\n301\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:33.120\nIt's our inability to understand them, and\nthat's something that we have to overcome.\n\n302\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.570\nThere are some people that we have to\n\n303\n00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:40.220\nhave as key stakeholders when\ndefining any requirements.\n\n304\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.510\nAnd that are people like the business.\n\n305\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.451\nNow, we've got the user community as well,\nand of course,\n\n306\n00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:51.267\nthere's a difference between customers,\ntheir business, and users.\n\n307\n00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:52.943\nCustomers, well, they pay for\n\n308\n00:15:52.943 --> 00:15:56.080\na service, so\nthey're interested in the utility aspect.\n\n309\n00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.861\nThey're interested in, does it do what\nit's supposed to do in the functionality?\n\n310\n00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:06.120\nWhereas users, well, they use our service\nso they've interested in the usability.\n\n311\n00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.560\nDon't forget, customers can also be users,\n\n312\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.340\nand then we've got our\ndevelopment teams as well.\n\n313\n00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.720\nNow our development teams are also\nincredibly interested in this\n\n314\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.220\nbecause our development teams, well, these\nare the people that are gonna design and\n\n315\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.900\ndevelop the actual\nservice solution itself.\n\n316\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.080\nWe have to have a statement\nof requirements document.\n\n317\n00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.790\nIt has to be done.\n\n318\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.890\nSo we have to make sure that everything\nis documented and this forms part of our\n\n319\n00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:39.280\nservice denying package and that each\ndocument should have its own unique ID and\n\n320\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.210\nwe should understand and articulate\nfully where that document came from.\n\n321\n00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.990\nAnd where the requirements\ncame from rather, and\n\n322\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:51.310\nlike any document,\nsubject to basic document control.\n\n323\n00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.420\nSuch as, it's got to have an author and\nit's got to have an owner, and\n\n324\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.880\nthose two could be different.\n\n325\n00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.860\nIt has to have a version number and\nit has to have a date.\n\n326\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.040\nWe have to have a priority for\nany new service.\n\n327\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.463\nAnd we have to have the Moscow approach,\n\n328\n00:17:04.463 --> 00:17:09.220\nand we'll talk about this in a little\nwhile for defining requirements.\n\n329\n00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.143\nMust have, should have,\ncould have, and would like.\n\n330\n00:17:12.143 --> 00:17:16.632\nAnd we have to be able to manage changes\nto that document because as I've already\n\n331\n00:17:16.632 --> 00:17:19.650\nsaid, this is about\nbasic document control.\n\n332\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.630\nTop version control.\n\n333\n00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:28.120\nSometimes we may choose to outsource\nthe production of a requirements document.\n\n334\n00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.120\nThat means that we,\nactually it's not uncommon, and\n\n335\n00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.730\nI do quite like the idea of outsourcing\nthe document because that means\n\n336\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.500\nthat we get an impartial\nview to requirements.\n\n337\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.790\nSometimes, the challenge with having\nin-house data engineering as it were,\n\n338\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:52.030\nan in-house requirements engineer, is the\nfact that we go to a user as an IT service\n\n339\n00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:56.910\nprovider with a preconceived idea as to\nwhat we think that they actually require.\n\n340\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.140\nWhen what they need can be\nsomething completely different.\n\n341\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.640\nGetting somebody external to do\nthis actually gives us an impartial\n\n342\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.912\nperspective and it means-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n343\n00:18:05.912 --> 00:18:07.830\nthen there's that bias\nthat may be existing?\n\n344\n00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.760\n&gt;&gt; Precisely.\n\n345\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.855\nYeah, it means that the customer view and\nthe user view is heard and\n\n346\n00:18:12.855 --> 00:18:16.770\nit's detailed and\narticulated very precisely.\n\n347\n00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.850\nThe problem with having somebody internal\nto do this is that an internal person\n\n348\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.755\nis going to have some form of bias,\nthey are not going to be impartial.\n\n349\n00:18:25.755 --> 00:18:27.845\nThey're going to document\nwhat they want to see, or\n\n350\n00:18:27.845 --> 00:18:30.105\nmaybe even what they want to design.\n\n351\n00:18:30.105 --> 00:18:31.855\nSo we've gotta be really careful.\n\n352\n00:18:31.855 --> 00:18:36.255\nI know how to develop this, so therefore,\nyeah, it's okay, I know Java, right?\n\n353\n00:18:36.255 --> 00:18:37.665\nI can do this in Java.\n\n354\n00:18:37.665 --> 00:18:38.835\nWell, that's great.\n\n355\n00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:42.945\nBut maybe it wouldn't be\nbest off written there.\n\n356\n00:18:42.945 --> 00:18:44.647\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe it would be best off using\n\n357\n00:18:44.647 --> 00:18:45.655\nsomething else.\n\n358\n00:18:45.655 --> 00:18:48.540\nAnd so that's the reason why\n\n359\n00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.520\nwe might want to consider bringing\nin somebody external to do this.\n\n360\n00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.930\nBear in mind though, if you do bring in\nsomebody external, if you're going to\n\n361\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:00.960\nbring in somebody from a specific supplier\nto help document the requirements,\n\n362\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.960\nthen they could be just as biased.\n\n363\n00:19:04.122 --> 00:19:06.610\nBecause if it's from a specific supplier\n\n364\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.990\nthey may have a particular product\nthey basically want to sell to us.\n\n365\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:15.895\nSo they could be just as biased,\njust as eager to sell\n\n366\n00:19:15.895 --> 00:19:20.730\nus a specific solution\nthan somebody internal.\n\n367\n00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.600\nSo weigh out the pros and cons before\nyou decide that you're going to go with\n\n368\n00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.390\nsomebody external or whether you're\ngoing to go with somebody internal.\n\n369\n00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.210\nWeigh out the pros and cons.\n\n370\n00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.960\nWork out which is best for you.\n\n371\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:36.610\nSo think about then also how\nwe're going to manage our data.\n\n372\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.540\nWhat kind of data are we going to have and\nhow we're gonna manage it.\n\n373\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.830\nSo we've got to ensure that we\nhave the right databases and\n\n374\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:50.190\nthat they have the right space to be able\nto handle the right amount of data and\n\n375\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.710\nthat they're subject\nto the right controls.\n\n376\n00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.190\nSo we have to ensure that we can\nmanage all of our data standards, and\n\n377\n00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.055\nour policies,\nsuch as retention policies for instance.\n\n378\n00:20:01.055 --> 00:20:04.515\nNow I know of an example\nin your sample paper and\n\n379\n00:20:04.515 --> 00:20:09.147\nwe'll be looking at a sample\npapers well in another episode.\n\n380\n00:20:09.147 --> 00:20:12.087\nAnd I know of an example\nin your sample paper that\n\n381\n00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:15.610\nrefers specifically to\ndata retention policies.\n\n382\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.880\nWe have to consider all of those.\n\n383\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.390\nAnd you may have policies in\nterms of security of your data,\n\n384\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.950\nin terms of movement of your data,\nmaybe between one database and\n\n385\n00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.330\nanother database or between sites.\n\n386\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.290\nYou may have data retention policies.\n\n387\n00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.100\nYou might have back up policies.\n\n388\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.700\nBut one of these are policies that\nwill help us manage our data.\n\n389\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.260\nThese all have to form\npart of our requirements.\n\n390\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.500\nAnd don't forget, it's our end users,\nit's our business\n\n391\n00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.610\nthat actually help us to define\nthe parameters within those policies.\n\n392\n00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.200\nThis is not down to what we want to do,\n\n393\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.390\nbut this is about what our\norganization requires of us.\n\n394\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.306\nIt's always recommended that when we\ndefine not just the data policies, but\n\n395\n00:20:58.306 --> 00:21:01.997\nour data parameters,\nthat we use that lifecycle approach.\n\n396\n00:21:01.997 --> 00:21:06.530\nSo that we understand exactly what it is\nthat's required and service strategy and\n\n397\n00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.260\nthen we design these particular policies.\n\n398\n00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.650\nThings like, what data do we hold?\n\n399\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.240\nHow are we going to classify it?\n\n400\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.930\nHow are we going to collect it?\n\n401\n00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.220\nHow are we going to store it?\n\n402\n00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.820\nHow are we going to access it?\n\n403\n00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.030\nThis is all part of defining the data and\n\n404\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.504\nthen through transition in\nthis life cycle approach,\n\n405\n00:21:26.504 --> 00:21:30.895\nwe then build answers to all\nof those general issues.\n\n406\n00:21:30.895 --> 00:21:33.227\nAnd then of course in\nthe live environment,\n\n407\n00:21:33.227 --> 00:21:37.008\nonce our service has gone live,\nthen we're going to be maintaining our\n\n408\n00:21:37.008 --> 00:21:40.830\ndata according to all\nthe policies we just designed.\n\n409\n00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:45.020\nSo, we use data to support\nthe whole of ITIL.\n\n410\n00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.920\nIncluding in design, we keep all\nof our design documentation, and\n\n411\n00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.560\nall of our design data,\nand all of our parameters.\n\n412\n00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.140\nAnd, you know what?\n\n413\n00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.350\nAt the end of every single project,\nI expect us to conduct a lessons\n\n414\n00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:59.440\nlearned exercise, to go over\nwhat we did really, really well.\n\n415\n00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.190\nWhat didn't work quite so well,\nand improvements for next time.\n\n416\n00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.450\nAnd design coordination as a process, well\nthey're gonna help us with that because\n\n417\n00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.170\nthey have that accountability to do that.\n\n418\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.360\nYou know,\ndata can also provide as it says here,\n\n419\n00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.840\nthe technical expertise on\nthe management of data systems.\n\n420\n00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:24.340\nIn other words, we've got specialists\nin our organization that can help us\n\n421\n00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:29.030\nto define a database that can help us\nto actually configure our databases.\n\n422\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.500\nI love that bottom bullet point where it\ntalks about many services have failed\n\n423\n00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.450\nbecause we simply didn't know\nwhat to do with the data.\n\n424\n00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.020\nOr because we stored it in\na place that was inappropriate.\n\n425\n00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.590\nWe didn't actually create a database for\nall of our data.\n\n426\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.425\nThings like a CRM database.\n\n427\n00:22:46.425 --> 00:22:48.230\nCustomer Relationship Management.\n\n428\n00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.140\nWhat data do we collect\nabout our customers?\n\n429\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.350\nWe collect their name, and\n\n430\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.820\nwe collect the date that they\nstarted with us maybe as a customer.\n\n431\n00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.880\nWe collect their address.\n\n432\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.340\nWhat about, say, frequent payment?\n\n433\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.610\nDo we collect information on\ntheir regular payment type and\n\n434\n00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.050\ntheir regular payment method,\nor do we not?\n\n435\n00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:13.225\nSome organizations do,\nsome organizations don't retain that data.\n\n436\n00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:17.134\nAnd if we don't retain that data, then\nwhat do we do with it once it's been used,\n\n437\n00:23:17.134 --> 00:23:20.065\nonce they paid us for one thing,\nwhat do we do with that data,\n\n438\n00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.830\ncuz I guarantee it's stored somewhere.\n\n439\n00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:28.030\nAnd if we do keep that information, then\nwhat are we doing to assure the customers\n\n440\n00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.630\nthat we're not going to\nmisuse that information or\n\n441\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.840\nthat it's not going to be lost for\ninstance, or subject to a security breach?\n\n442\n00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and like you were\nmentioning with the audits there\n\n443\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.690\nin a previous episode where even I've\nheard of individuals having just\n\n444\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.080\ncompanies having clean desk policies.\n\n445\n00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.700\nLook, we're not gonna be printing\nout on sheets of paper any kind of\n\n446\n00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.300\nimportant credit card information.\n\n447\n00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:52.470\nIt all has to be on lockdown\nwith our network access control.\n\n448\n00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, yeah.\n\n449\n00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.311\nDefinitely.\n\n450\n00:23:55.311 --> 00:24:00.351\nAnd what about then, it tells you here\nthat data is an asset and has a value,\n\n451\n00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:04.842\nand I would say, yes and no,\nit's very much a proprietary asset.\n\n452\n00:24:04.842 --> 00:24:09.692\nIt has a value to you,\nit doesn't have a value to other people.\n\n453\n00:24:09.692 --> 00:24:13.220\nThis depends on the culture, and\nit depends on the environment.\n\n454\n00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:18.280\nIn certain cultures and in certain\ncountries, it is perfectly legal to\n\n455\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.030\nsell certain pieces of data\non to other organizations.\n\n456\n00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.580\nAnd so in certain countries,\n\n457\n00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.930\npeople are very protective over things\nlike their telephone number, for instance.\n\n458\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.260\nIn other countries around the world,\nit's completely illegal to do that.\n\n459\n00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.587\nSo whereas data doesn't have the same\nvalue in their country, because data\n\n460\n00:24:38.587 --> 00:24:43.680\nin a country where information is not\npassed around, and is not sold on.\n\n461\n00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.748\nWell, then the data is only valuable\nto that particular company.\n\n462\n00:24:49.748 --> 00:24:54.718\nWhereas in countries where it's\nperfectly legal to sell data on,\n\n463\n00:24:54.718 --> 00:24:57.570\ndata does have then a physical value.\n\n464\n00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.610\nSo we will classify all of\nour data as operational data,\n\n465\n00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:08.560\nwhich is just necessary for\nhow we actually manage our services.\n\n466\n00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.320\nWe have tactical data, which is data\nthat's used by management to help manage\n\n467\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.090\nthose services,\ndata such as performance, for instance.\n\n468\n00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.900\nAnd then strategic data, which is used for\n\n469\n00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.240\nmanaging the long term investments and\nthe long term goals,\n\n470\n00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.890\nof either the organization or\nof the actual service itself.\n\n471\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:35.380\nWe have to set standards for\nhow we're going to record our data.\n\n472\n00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.930\nWho's going to own our data, and\nwhat we're going to do with it.\n\n473\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:42.148\nAt what point in time do we archive it,\nat what point in time do we migrate it?\n\n474\n00:25:42.148 --> 00:25:47.450\nMaybe to a new service, or\nmaybe just to archive facilities.\n\n475\n00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.160\nAnd we talk about retention as well,\nso we have to set standards.\n\n476\n00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.790\nWe also have to set standards for\nstorage of data, where do we keep it?\n\n477\n00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.800\nPhysically, where do we keep that data,\nhow do we capture it?\n\n478\n00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.510\nDo we capture it automatically, or\ndo we allow data to be input manually,\n\n479\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.590\nI would say both.\n\n480\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:11.480\nAnd what about if we want access to our\ndata, how do we retrieve that data?\n\n481\n00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.550\nWhat if we've already archived something,\nand somebody wants access to that,\n\n482\n00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:18.760\nthen how do we retrieve that data?\n\n483\n00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.550\nAnd we think about, obviously,\nour data integrity as well.\n\n484\n00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:28.626\nNow, way back in the processes\nwithin service design,\n\n485\n00:26:28.626 --> 00:26:32.090\nwe looked at IT security management.\n\n486\n00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.405\nAnd we looked at CIA,\nthe confidentiality and integrity and\n\n487\n00:26:35.405 --> 00:26:36.900\navailability of our data.\n\n488\n00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.991\nEnsuring that we could\nmaintain its integrity, and\n\n489\n00:26:39.991 --> 00:26:42.099\nto maintain its confidentiality,\n\n490\n00:26:42.099 --> 00:26:47.520\nwhilst making sure that it's available to\neverybody that needs to have access to it.\n\n491\n00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.390\nSo we need to have policies for this, and\n\n492\n00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.330\nwe're not just talking about security\nas in this controlled access.\n\n493\n00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.550\nWe're talking about corrupted data and\nlost data, what about\n\n494\n00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:03.780\nwhen you want to go back and retrieve\nsomething, because you made a mistake?\n\n495\n00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.575\nAnd then you saved it, and you think,\nI need to go back to a previous version,\n\n496\n00:27:07.575 --> 00:27:11.547\nand then we find that the previous version\nhas been corrupted, what happens to that?\n\n497\n00:27:11.547 --> 00:27:14.852\nHave you ever been into, and\n\n498\n00:27:14.852 --> 00:27:20.090\nthis is sort of a security\nimplication here.\n\n499\n00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.663\nBut have you ever been into a store\nwhere you've used a credit card, and\n\n500\n00:27:23.663 --> 00:27:26.956\nthat credit card transaction for\nsome reason has been canceled?\n\n501\n00:27:26.956 --> 00:27:27.572\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n502\n00:27:27.572 --> 00:27:30.665\n&gt;&gt; Right, and what happens to that\npiece of paper that they print out?\n\n503\n00:27:30.665 --> 00:27:35.431\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I don't know if\na piece of paper was actually printed.\n\n504\n00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:39.721\n&gt;&gt; You see, when I go into a store, if a\ncredit card transaction has been canceled\n\n505\n00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:43.090\nfor whatever reason, I ask for\nthat piece of paper.\n\n506\n00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.683\nBecause at some point in time,\n\n507\n00:27:44.683 --> 00:27:47.513\nI might need proof of what's\nhappened with that data.\n\n508\n00:27:47.513 --> 00:27:50.845\nBut also what's happened with that money,\nbecause then if you then log on to your\n\n509\n00:27:50.845 --> 00:27:53.455\ncredit card account and\nsee that that money's been taken out.\n\n510\n00:27:53.455 --> 00:27:58.077\nYou have absolutely no proof\nthat that was cancelled,\n\n511\n00:27:58.077 --> 00:28:04.517\nit's that sort of data integrity that\nwe have to have policies to deal with.\n\n512\n00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:06.812\nWhat happens in that sort of instance,\n\n513\n00:28:06.812 --> 00:28:10.427\nnow that particular example\nthat I described, to be honest,\n\n514\n00:28:10.427 --> 00:28:14.690\nmost stores have got a policy for\nhanding you that piece of paper.\n\n515\n00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.870\nAnd then if they don't,\nthen you're legally allowed to ask for\n\n516\n00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.320\nthat piece of paper because it's yours.\n\n517\n00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.064\nIt's to do with your credit, and\nit's to do with your finances,\n\n518\n00:28:24.064 --> 00:28:27.360\nbut what if a store\ndidn't have that policy?\n\n519\n00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:33.113\nWell, here we are in IT, it's up to\nus to actually define that policy.\n\n520\n00:28:33.113 --> 00:28:36.313\nSo far, what we've done is,\nin this particular episode,\n\n521\n00:28:36.313 --> 00:28:39.120\nwe've looked at how we\ngather requirements.\n\n522\n00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.560\nAnd then we've looked at our data,\nand what we do with our data, and\n\n523\n00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.780\nhow we manage our data.\n\n524\n00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.073\nWhat I'd like you to do, for the moment,\n\n525\n00:28:47.073 --> 00:28:50.066\nis I would like you just to\nreview the downloadable material.\n\n526\n00:28:50.066 --> 00:28:53.932\nTo do with the data retention, and\nto do with data management, and\n\n527\n00:28:53.932 --> 00:28:56.359\nalso to do with requirements gathering.\n\n528\n00:28:56.359 --> 00:29:00.847\nAnd when we come back, we're going to look\na little bit more in our next episode at\n\n529\n00:29:00.847 --> 00:29:04.290\napplication management and\napplication development.\n\n530\n00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.300\nBut if you do have any questions or\nany queries,\n\n531\n00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.700\nthen please feel free to reach\nout to us via the forum.\n\n532\n00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.835\n&gt;&gt; We'll find you out there.\n\n533\n00:29:12.835 --> 00:29:14.228\n&gt;&gt; Yep, [LAUGH] out there somewhere.\n\n534\n00:29:14.228 -->

your\nITIL Intermediate Series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:16.153\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.153 --> 00:00:19.913\nThis is actually a part two where we\ncontinue taking a look at our service\n\n9\n00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:21.760\ndesign activities.\n\n10\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.962\nIn the previous episode,\n\n11\n00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:26.400\nJo walked us through the process\nof looking at some types of\n\n12\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.910\ndata management as well as different\ntypes of functional specifications.\n\n13\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.390\nShe promised us application\nmanagement in the series\n\n14\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.730\nalong with a few other surprises,\nI'm sure.\n\n15\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.660\nSo thank you for joining us today, Jo.\n\n16\n00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.330\nHow's it going?\n\n17\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.430\n&gt;&gt; I promise all the surprises\nwill be pleasant surprises.\n\n18\n00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.948\nHow's that?\n\n19\n00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:44.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's great.\n\n20\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.580\nAlways a plus.\n\n21\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.980\n&gt;&gt; In this particular episode, we're going\nto be looking at application management,\n\n22\n00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.080\nthe concepts of application management and\n\n23\n00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.950\nthe difference between application\nmanagement and application development.\n\n24\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.100\nSo where should we start off, then?\n\n25\n00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.150\nBy looking at, well,\nwhat is application management?\n\n26\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.070\nWell, it's about managing\nour applications.\n\n27\n00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.260\nHow's that then for straightforward?\n\n28\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.190\nAn application is really our software and\nsoftware functions.\n\n29\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.810\nWhat our software does.\n\n30\n00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.950\nThat's what we consider\nto be an application.\n\n31\n00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.550\nSo an application is just\none component of a service.\n\n32\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.285\nAnd if you remember, the components of\na service are software and hardware and\n\n33\n00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:27.820\nthe environment and the people that use\nthe service and the people that also\n\n34\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.830\ndevelop and support the service and\nour infrastructure and our documentation.\n\n35\n00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.190\nAnd all of those elements are being\ndesigned here in service design.\n\n36\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.030\nBut we do have a specific team that looks\nspecifically, again, at applications.\n\n37\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.740\nAnd we have what we call\nan application management team.\n\n38\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.550\nAnd the application management team, well,\nthey work out the functional requirements\n\n39\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.700\nfor an application, and\nthey then go on to support\n\n40\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.860\nan application, as well, once that\napplication is in the live environment.\n\n41\n00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.680\nNow, I want you to think of this as,\nhow do I say this?\n\n42\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.560\nWe've got a subset of\napplication management, and\n\n43\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.520\nwe call them application development.\n\n44\n00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.850\nApplication development is an optional\nsubset of application management.\n\n45\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.941\nWhen we first start off with a new\nservice, somebody has got to agree that,\n\n46\n00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:27.445\nyes, this new service is gonna ahead and\nwe start the project off.\n\n47\n00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.810\nAnd at that point in time,\napplication management come along and\n\n48\n00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.940\nthey gather the functional\nrequirements for that service.\n\n49\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.280\nAnd then one of two things happen.\n\n50\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.480\nWe either develop it in-house or\nwe go outside and\n\n51\n00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.010\nwe buy something commercial off the shelf,\nor COTS, as we call this.\n\n52\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.062\nOr maybe we buy something that\nwe in England call bespoke, but\n\n53\n00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:50.363\nI think you guys probably\ncall tailor-made.\n\n54\n00:02:50.363 --> 00:02:51.688\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, custom.\n\n55\n00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:54.446\nBespoke is not too popular here,\nat least that I've encountered.\n\n56\n00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:56.073\nBut I would know what it meant.\n\n57\n00:02:56.073 --> 00:02:57.200\n&gt;&gt; It sounds better though, right?\n\n58\n00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.897\n&gt;&gt; It does sound better.\n\n59\n00:02:57.897 --> 00:02:58.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it.\n\n60\n00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:01.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll stick with bespoke, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.680\nSo we need to do one of three things.\n\n62\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.190\nWe either build it in-house,\n\n63\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.570\nwhich again is bespoke, we either\nget somebody else to build it for\n\n64\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.030\nus, bespoke, or we'll buy it off\nthe shelf, COTS, commercial off the shelf.\n\n65\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.610\nAll three of those are what we\ncall application development.\n\n66\n00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.908\nSo application management\nis kind of the big banner.\n\n67\n00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:24.633\nAnd underneath,\nwe've got application development.\n\n68\n00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:29.730\nAnd then once application development have\nfinished the design and the development,\n\n69\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.547\nit's then passed back to application\nmanagement to then manage the transition,\n\n70\n00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.110\nthey do it both together.\n\n71\n00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.977\nAnd then application\nmanagement carry on and\n\n72\n00:03:38.977 --> 00:03:42.229\nsupport the application\nin the live environment.\n\n73\n00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:47.368\nSo think of application development as\nbeing a subset of application management.\n\n74\n00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:52.748\nHowever, application\ndevelopment can be external.\n\n75\n00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:55.917\nYou know, application management can also\nbe external as well, just to try and\n\n76\n00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:56.970\nconfuse things.\n\n77\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.810\nAnd certainly, if we're going with\ncommercial off-the-shelf product,\n\n78\n00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.650\nthen the support of that and\n\n79\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.080\ntherefore the ongoing application\nmanagement may well be offsite.\n\n80\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.340\nSo don't think of this as being\nsomething that's predominantly in house,\n\n81\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.790\nit doesn't have to be, but it can be.\n\n82\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.194\nSo we need to have a portfolio\nof our applications.\n\n83\n00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:22.009\nAnd in our application portfolio,\nwell, I expect that to be a database\n\n84\n00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.330\nthat feeds into our service asset and\nconfiguration management process.\n\n85\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.920\nSo it feeds into both our service\nportfolios and into our configuration\n\n86\n00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.230\nmanagement system, because an application\nis a component of a service.\n\n87\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.010\nAnd as we know, if we take a look\nat service transition, and\n\n88\n00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.300\nin fact, way back in your\nfoundation material as well,\n\n89\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.170\nthen we saw that knowledge management\nensured that all of our relationships\n\n90\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.409\nbetween our databases went through\nour configuration management system.\n\n91\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.630\nWe'll have a framework for\nhow we both design and\n\n92\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.100\nhow we develop and\nhow we manage our applications.\n\n93\n00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.950\nAnd it's really important that we do this,\n\n94\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.730\nbecause we want a standard way\nof approaching applications.\n\n95\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.541\nWhether it will be a standard way\nof developing an application, or\n\n96\n00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:19.509\nif we're going outside for development, a\nstandard way of sourcing new suppliers for\n\n97\n00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:20.678\nour applications.\n\n98\n00:05:20.678 --> 00:05:25.764\nAnd a standard way of then\nsupporting those applications.\n\n99\n00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:27.497\nBut we must have a standard.\n\n100\n00:05:27.497 --> 00:05:30.408\nIf we were to do everything\nin an ad-hoc way and\n\n101\n00:05:30.408 --> 00:05:34.887\nif we were to do everything in a specific\nservice by service by service,\n\n102\n00:05:34.887 --> 00:05:39.817\nthen we'd find that we'd have quite\na dysfunctional application management\n\n103\n00:05:39.817 --> 00:05:43.360\nteam and\napplication management group of people.\n\n104\n00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.710\nSometimes you might call them\nthe developers or the software team.\n\n105\n00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.480\nAnd as I've always said, this is ITIL.\n\n106\n00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.700\nWe'll give you a framework and\n\n107\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.230\nit's up to you then to adapt\nthat framework to suit you.\n\n108\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.940\nSo what you call these people,\nthat's entirely up to you.\n\n109\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.760\nWe're just talking about the activities\nthat these people will undertake.\n\n110\n00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.259\nYou need to have a consistent approach to\nboth the design and the build and the test\n\n111\n00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.779\nof our software, and then a consistent\napproach to the support of our software.\n\n112\n00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:18.810\nBecause an ad-hoc approach, or a service\nby service approach, is not efficient.\n\n113\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.970\nNow, I'm not saying that there\nshouldn't be anomalies in there,\n\n114\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.280\nbecause of course there should.\n\n115\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.210\nEvery service is different, and\nevery single application and\n\n116\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.490\nevery single piece of\nhardware is different.\n\n117\n00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.460\nSo of course you're\ngoing to have specifics.\n\n118\n00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.260\nBut nevertheless,\nwe should all follow a standard approach.\n\n119\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.340\nSo what about the design\nof our applications?\n\n120\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.190\nWell, it says here the design is one\nof the most important phases, but\n\n121\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.680\nto be perfectly honest,\nthe design is the most important phase,\n\n122\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.850\nbecause this is where we design\nwhat we're going to develop and\n\n123\n00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.820\ntherefore what we're going to deliver and\nwhat we have to support.\n\n124\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.880\nThis is about where we take the customer\nand the end user perception of value and\n\n125\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.860\nthen we design something that's\ngoing to deliver value and\n\n126\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.110\nis going to facilitate their outcomes.\n\n127\n00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.300\nSo we have to think about\nhere in service design.\n\n128\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.570\nWe're not just thinking about the project.\n\n129\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.650\nWe're thinking about in service design\nthe availability requirements and\n\n130\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.320\nthe capacity requirements.\n\n131\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.879\nAnd then also maintainability and\nreliability.\n\n132\n00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:21.743\nHow we're going to fix\nsomething if it goes wrong.\n\n133\n00:07:21.743 --> 00:07:26.357\nAnd then security and\ncontinuity requirements as well.\n\n134\n00:07:26.357 --> 00:07:29.587\nAnd then think about our tradeoffs too.\n\n135\n00:07:29.587 --> 00:07:31.433\nAnd of course, our design tradeoffs, and\n\n136\n00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:34.140\nwe talk about this when we\nlook at project management.\n\n137\n00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.539\nOur design tradeoffs include\nthe tradeoff between the resources and\n\n138\n00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:44.285\nthe skills we've got available,\nand the functionality and\n\n139\n00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:47.820\nthe time,\nwhich is the schedule itself, and\n\n140\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.933\nthe requirements and\nthe money that we have as well.\n\n141\n00:07:51.933 --> 00:07:55.040\nWe have to think about the tradeoff here.\n\n142\n00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.530\nThe more money we spend then you'd like to\n\n143\n00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.790\nthink that the more\nfunctionality that we could get.\n\n144\n00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.250\nBut then the more functionality\nthat we're getting,\n\n145\n00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.520\nthen the longer it's going to take us\nto develop that and to deploy that.\n\n146\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.470\nThe shorter the time scale we have,\nthen the chances are the less\n\n147\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.840\nfunctionality that we can\nimplement in a short time scale.\n\n148\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.770\nBut sometimes a short time scale\nmeans investing more money,\n\n149\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.570\nbecause we've gotta get it out\nof the door quicker, as it were.\n\n150\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.859\nYou've gotta get your balance right.\n\n151\n00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:27.710\nAnd this needs to be done\nwithin the project team.\n\n152\n00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.680\nAnd it's the project team that will help\nwith this, even though we will support and\n\n153\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.660\nwe will help with\nthe operational aspect of that.\n\n154\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.338\nYou need to include the following,\nlike the user interface.\n\n155\n00:08:40.338 --> 00:08:45.130\nAnd this is why we talk about utility and\nwarranty.\n\n156\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.010\nWe talk about the utility being,\ndoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n157\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.543\nAnd the warranty being, can I use it?\n\n158\n00:08:51.543 --> 00:08:55.845\nAnd here we are in this\nwarranty aspect thinking about\n\n159\n00:08:55.845 --> 00:08:58.719\nthe usability of any given server.\n\n160\n00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.070\nIt's okay being able to send and\nreceive email, but\n\n161\n00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.080\nif it's not available when you need it,\nor if it's so\n\n162\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.210\ncumbersome that we can't actually\nreally send an email, or we can't send\n\n163\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.090\nthe size of attachment that we need to,\nthen what's the point in having it?\n\n164\n00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.230\nWill the users perceive value?\n\n165\n00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.620\nThat's what we're aiming towards.\n\n166\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.691\nWe're aiming to value perception and\nto facilitate an outcome.\n\n167\n00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:25.654\nWe want to have, if we can, and I say if,\n\n168\n00:09:25.654 --> 00:09:29.670\na consistent design pattern\nto all of our designs.\n\n169\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.159\nWhat I would say to you is that we\nshould have a standard methodology for\n\n170\n00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:35.846\ndesigning our services.\n\n171\n00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:41.270\nNow, we talk about design patterns,\nI want to see a consistent methodology.\n\n172\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.020\nI want us to see maybe using an agile,\na waterfall approach,\n\n173\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:50.900\nmaybe using something like PRINCE2 or\nPMP as an approach to project management.\n\n174\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.900\nI'm not gonna tell you how to do this,\nbut I want to encourage consistency,\n\n175\n00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.080\nbecause consistency is\nobviously efficient.\n\n176\n00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.900\nBut in terms of the individual\napplications themselves,\n\n177\n00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.880\nof course there are going to be nuances.\n\n178\n00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.880\nAnd of course each one is going\nto be completely unique and,\n\n179\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.960\ntherefore, we have to design and\ndevelop our services in a unique way.\n\n180\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.570\nIt's just that how we do that,\nthat needs to be consistent.\n\n181\n00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:24.330\nAnd again we talk about consistent coding\nconventions and code generation and using\n\n182\n00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.240\na consistent method of code generation and\nmaybe using consistent tools.\n\n183\n00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.910\nYet again, I can't tell you how to do\nthis, cuz it really depends on the service\n\n184\n00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.980\nthat you are developing and\nthe service that you will be supporting.\n\n185\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.890\nBut what I can tell you is that you need\nto use a consistent method to do this,\n\n186\n00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.040\nbecause that then promotes efficiency, and\n\n187\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.070\nof course, that's exactly what\nwe're interesting in within ITIL.\n\n188\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.010\nI'd like to think about\nembedding the support\n\n189\n00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.920\ntools within the application itself.\n\n190\n00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.330\nIt sounds kind of straightforward,\nreally, and\n\n191\n00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.010\nit sounds really like common sense,\nand of course it is.\n\n192\n00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.108\nBut it's not good implementing\nsomething that you can't support.\n\n193\n00:11:06.108 --> 00:11:08.650\nSo design for support.\n\n194\n00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.846\nIt makes sense, of course you should.\n\n195\n00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:13.410\nDesign for diagnostic hooks.\n\n196\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.330\nWhich are those little hooks, the codes\nwithin any application that we can\n\n197\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.220\ngo to and we can say, okay then,\nI understand that the application does x,\n\n198\n00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.090\ny, and zed or\nz as you might refer to it as.\n\n199\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:32.000\nIt does x, y, and zed, and this is how\nit does it, and now let's go through\n\n200\n00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.120\nthe workflow to try and diagnose where\nsomething's gone wrong, where we might\n\n201\n00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.179\nhave functionality gaps or where we\nmight have functionality failures.\n\n202\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:48.290\nWhat development has to give\nus is a developed service and\n\n203\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.940\nwhat design gives us\nis a designed service.\n\n204\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.370\nBut application management\nincludes both the design and\n\n205\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.800\nthe development and\nthe ongoing support as well.\n\n206\n00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.630\nSo if I look at development and\nthe development side of things,\n\n207\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.670\nyou can see what comes out of development.\n\n208\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.180\nYou know, customized scripts and\nspecification of metrics.\n\n209\n00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.655\nI want you to think of\nyour five design aspects,\n\n210\n00:12:14.655 --> 00:12:19.645\nthe five things that we design and\nwe design the complete service solution.\n\n211\n00:12:19.645 --> 00:12:23.375\nBut we also designed the tools\nthat we're going to use\n\n212\n00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:25.685\nto support that service solution.\n\n213\n00:12:25.685 --> 00:12:28.293\nWe design our metrics as well.\n\n214\n00:12:28.293 --> 00:12:32.770\nAnd we design our processes, and\nwe design our architectures.\n\n215\n00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.010\nAnd I'm not just talking\nabout our network topology.\n\n216\n00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.850\nI'm also talking about how we're\ngoing to work together and\n\n217\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:43.055\nwhat teams we're going to have to be able\nto support a new service going forwards.\n\n218\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.840\nUltimately, with application management,\nas I've already said,\n\n219\n00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.530\nwe're not just talking about\nthe management of our applications and\n\n220\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.100\nthe support,\nwe're also talking about development.\n\n221\n00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.840\nAnd application management makes\nthe decision whether to build in-house or\n\n222\n00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:04.140\nwhether to go outside and\nsource from an external provider.\n\n223\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:09.480\nEither way, application management\nare going to manage the support ongoing\n\n224\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.990\nof a particular service, even if that\nis through a third-party provider.\n\n225\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.830\nBut the decision as to whether to build or\nwhether to buy, that's made by\n\n226\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.720\napplication management and then it's\npassed over to application development for\n\n227\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.625\nthem to develop, be that in house or\nwhether that's external or not.\n\n228\n00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:30.380\nThere's no right or\nwrong way to doing this.\n\n229\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.260\nAnd you have to consider what the\nrequirements are that the business wants,\n\n230\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.660\nand you have to consider who is best\nsuited to meet those requirements and\n\n231\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.200\nto deliver the outcome for\nthe organization.\n\n232\n00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.683\nAnd there's no right or wrong way.\n\n233\n00:13:44.683 --> 00:13:47.400\nBut what we will tell you is\nto use a consistent approach.\n\n234\n00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.410\nAnd then that way, with a consistent\napproach, if everything's documented,\n\n235\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:56.970\nthen we know whether we are,\nwell, being efficient or\n\n236\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.460\nwhether we're not being efficient,\nwhether we're being inefficient.\n\n237\n00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.370\nAnd we know whether we're actually\ndelivering value to the organization.\n\n238\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.510\nSo at this point in time,\nyou have an exercise in your downloadable\n\n239\n00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.150\nmaterial which should take you\naround about 45 minutes to complete.\n\n240\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:17.140\nRelating to the activities that we've\njust looked at within service design.\n\n241\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:22.075\nNow, as always, I invite you to\nundertake that exercise right now.\n\n242\n00:14:22.075 --> 00:14:26.216\nAnd if you do have any queries, then\nplease reach out to me through the forum\n\n243\n00:14:26.216 --> 00:14:30.890\nand I will be happy to help you with\nany questions that you might have.\n\n244\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.720\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Jo, for taking a look at, or\n\n245\n00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.240\nshowing us how to take a look at our\ndifferent types of our development and\n\n246\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.640\napplication design and\nmanagement techniques there.\n\n247\n00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.542\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\nbut for this show we are out of time.\n\n248\n00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:45.003\nSo we will go ahead and sign out.\n\n249\n00:14:45.003 --> 00:14:46.419\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n250\n00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:47.416\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n251\n00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:49.936\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n252\n00:14:49.936 -->

00:00:12.059\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.316\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your\nITIL Intermediate series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:16.170\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.680\nIn this episode we'll be taking\na look at organizing for\n\n7\n00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.100\nservice design as well as\ntechnology considerations.\n\n8\n00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.080\nAnd back with us today in studio,\nwe have Ms. Joe Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.290\nHow's it going, Joe?\n\n10\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.570\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely fine, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.110\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.820\nSo, we're actually taking two topics here.\n\n14\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.340\nWe're combining them together.\n\n15\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.869\nBecause we have information still yet\nto cover.\n\n16\n00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:36.514\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's exactly right.\n\n17\n00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:40.400\nWe've got lots of information still left\nto cover when it comes to service design.\n\n18\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.160\nFirst thing that we're going to do is\nlook at organizing for service design.\n\n19\n00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.830\nand what sort of people that we need.\n\n20\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.400\nAnd then we're gonna look at the\ntechnology considerations as you said and\n\n21\n00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.170\nthe real reason why we're combining\nthese two into one session.\n\n22\n00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.580\nAnd in your downloadable material,\n\n23\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.100\nwe've actually got two different\nsections here in your material.\n\n24\n00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.570\nAnd that's simply because I can sum up\nthese particular sessions in two words and\n\n25\n00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.940\nthat is, it depends.\n\n26\n00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.360\n&gt;&gt; So we have actually,\nwe don't get to merge this together and\n\n27\n00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.260\nonly have one set of homework there.\n\n28\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.765\nWe have to-\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm afraid not.\n\n29\n00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:15.225\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, we've still got to do lots of\n\n30\n00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:16.670\nhomework with that one, right?\n\n31\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.610\nBut you know, this completely\nthis entire section this episode\n\n32\n00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.660\nreally is completely dependent\non your organization.\n\n33\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.170\nThere is no right or wrong way to\norganize and if you want to look at\n\n34\n00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.300\norganization itself in more detail then\nplease go to the service strategy show.\n\n35\n00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.400\nAnd you'll see that we\ncover organization for\n\n36\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.440\nIT service management in\na lot more details there.\n\n37\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.830\nThere's no right or wrong way.\n\n38\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.420\nIt really is completely\ndependent on your organization.\n\n39\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.930\nAnd it's the same with technology.\n\n40\n00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.810\nThere's no right or wrong tools.\n\n41\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.920\nIt's completely dependent\non your organization.\n\n42\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.890\nAll you need to do, and all I will tell\nyou that you have to do, is make sure that\n\n43\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.540\nyou define the roles and responsibilities\nthat you need within service design.\n\n44\n00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.390\nAnd that's it.\nI mean, what I can tell you\n\n45\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.900\nis that you need to have processes, and\ntherefore you need to have process owners.\n\n46\n00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.350\nBut with any service,\na service needs a process owner.\n\n47\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.330\nBut what about all of the other\npeople that are involved in service?\n\n48\n00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.620\nWe spoke in previous episodes\nabout application management.\n\n49\n00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.320\nWhat about the people\nthat support a service?\n\n50\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.800\nWhat about the people\nthat develop a service?\n\n51\n00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.046\nWell they could be internal,\nor they could be external.\n\n52\n00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:26.220\nI don't know,\nbecause I don't know your organization.\n\n53\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.210\nAnd as it talks there\nabout a strategic choice,\n\n54\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.220\nwell you have to make sure that you\nunderstand who makes that choice,\n\n55\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.100\nwho makes the choice to go outside, or\nwho makes the choice to stay inside.\n\n56\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.340\nUltimately what I will tell you you\nhave to do is create a RACI matrix And\n\n57\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.790\na RACI matrix is something that\nyou saw in foundation, that we had\n\n58\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.040\na recap over in our foundation recap at\nthe start of the service design show.\n\n59\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.670\nSo a RACI matrix is something that you\nare completely familiar with already.\n\n60\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.750\nAnd so, when we look at RACI matrix,\n\n61\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.610\nI need to have one Person accountable for\neach task.\n\n62\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.120\nBut I have to make sure,\n\n63\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.560\nthough you haven't got too\nmany people involved, as well.\n\n64\n00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.850\nAnd what about responsibilities?\n\n65\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.310\nThe question it asks though, is this\ntoo much for one particular function?\n\n66\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.980\nBe careful,\nbecause in terms of responsibilities for\n\n67\n00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.950\nsomething like,\nmaybe requirements definition.\n\n68\n00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.770\nWell, everybody's got\na responsibility there because.\n\n69\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.030\nEverybody has to contribute\nto requirement's definition.\n\n70\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.730\nSo think about using something like\na stakeholder map for instance.\n\n71\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.560\nAnd again, we find that in service\nstrategy, and in CSI as well.\n\n72\n00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.950\nSo we'll take a look at those shows for\nmore information on that.\n\n73\n00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.780\nBut really what we need to do is\njust complete a RACI matrix for\n\n74\n00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.520\nabsolutely every single process.\n\n75\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.480\nAnd just remember, you only have one A,\none accountability for\n\n76\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.240\neach task and for each activity, and\n\n77\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.099\nyou can have as many as you want,\ndepends on the actual activity itself.\n\n78\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.760\nC is always been consulted,\nthe more opinion you ask for\n\n79\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.910\nthe more opinion you\nare going to get back and\n\n80\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.840\nyou have to do something with that\nyou have to be able to feedback and\n\n81\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.730\nalso in font the I how many people do\nyou tell about a specific activity,\n\n82\n00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.180\nthere is no right or wrong just that\nwhen you put in any A or any R or\n\n83\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.110\nany Any C or any I, no AC matrix, ask\nyourself the question, is this relevant?\n\n84\n00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.680\nSome organization just\nactually having the roles and\n\n85\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.305\nresponsibilities defined is actually\na full-time, Time role in itself.\n\n86\n00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:45.795\nSo some organizations actually\nhave an HR person within IT.\n\n87\n00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:50.875\nOr they have a strategy person within IT\nthat assigns roles and responsibilities.\n\n88\n00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:57.100\nIn other organizations, it might actually\nbe the CSI manager or that CSI owner.\n\n89\n00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.600\nIt's completely up to you.\n\n90\n00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.620\nAnd as I've already said,\nthis entire section\n\n91\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.820\nreally involves the words well it depends,\nit depends on your organization.\n\n92\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.360\nBut it's got to be considered.\n\n93\n00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.760\nYou cannot just have people wandering\naround doing what they want to do.\n\n94\n00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.070\nThere has to be some structure\nto your organization.\n\n95\n00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.150\nAnd, here's an example of a racy matrix\nA RACI matrix in this instance is just for\n\n96\n00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.430\na particular process, and we have\nthe activities listed down the side and\n\n97\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.260\nthere is no right or wrong, the only thing\nthat I will tell you is you can only have\n\n98\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.112\none person accountable for\neach activity or for each task.\n\n99\n00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:37.760\nSo, for\nevery process there has to be a process.\n\n100\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.220\nFor every process there\nhas to be a process\n\n101\n00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.110\nmanager and we've looked at\nthis in each of the processes.\n\n102\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.680\nAnd so, of course we looked at the service\nAs Catalog Process Owner and Manager, and\n\n103\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.250\nthey can be combined, an owner and\na manager can be combined.\n\n104\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.510\nAnd in every process\nthe Service Level Manager and\n\n105\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.690\nthe Availability Manager and\nwe've got a Service Continuity Manager,\n\n106\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.820\na Capacity Manager and Security Manager\nand a Supplier Manager as well.\n\n107\n00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.250\nNow one thing that we did do is when\nwe looked at design coordination,\n\n108\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.200\nwe looked at the fact that we might\nhave a design manager as opposed\n\n109\n00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.010\nto a design coordination process owner.\n\n110\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.240\nIt's up to you what you call them.\n\n111\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.000\nBut notice the activities and the\nresponsibilities of the design manager.\n\n112\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.390\nThey are the activities and\n\n113\n00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.420\nresponsibilities of design\ncoordination process owner.\n\n114\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.020\nIn other words, that particular\nperson takes full accountability for\n\n115\n00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.140\nperforming all of the duties\nof design coordination.\n\n116\n00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.430\nNow when we talked about design\ncoordination as a process, I highlighted\n\n117\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.890\nthe synergy that exists between design\ncoordination and transaction planning and\n\n118\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.250\nsupport as a process, and also the\ninteraction between design coordination\n\n119\n00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.260\nand transaction planning and support and\nthe project management role as well.\n\n120\n00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.770\nSo these all work hand in hand together.\n\n121\n00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.090\nWe may also have an IT Planner role.\n\n122\n00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.840\nSomebody who's responsible for\n\n123\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.370\nthe production of IT plans that\nmeet the needs of the organization.\n\n124\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.189\nThat particular person may\nbe part of service strategy.\n\n125\n00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.860\nMaybe part of service design.\n\n126\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.250\nThat's entirely up to you\nbecause I'm using the word may.\n\n127\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.270\nYou may have an IT Planner and\nthis is what they may do.\n\n128\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.130\nThere is no right or wrong.\n\n129\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.600\nThese are just guidelines for you.\n\n130\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.210\nAnd the guidelines here for\nan IT Planner looks at standards and\n\n131\n00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.840\nlooks at policies and\nlooks at plans and looks at strategies.\n\n132\n00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.910\nWhether you put that person in strategy,\nor\n\n133\n00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.150\nwhether you put that person in design,\nagain that's completely up to you.\n\n134\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.960\nAgain we've got other activities here\nfrom the IT planner perspective,\n\n135\n00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.040\nsuch as taking the requirements from\nthe organization and taking ultimate\n\n136\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.950\nresponsibility for Planning and for\nscheduling projects for instance.\n\n137\n00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.600\nSo that person might actually sit in you\nPMO or in your project management office\n\n138\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.770\nbecause they conduct post\nimplementation reviews etcetera.\n\n139\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.150\nSo if this might be a project role,\nthis might sit in service design or\n\n140\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.820\nit might sit in service strategy.\n\n141\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.300\nThat is entirely up to you, but\n\n142\n00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.230\nobviously these activities no matter where\nthat person sits no matter whether you\n\n143\n00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.666\nhave a person that is called an IT planner\nsomebody has to perform these activities.\n\n144\n00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:40.780\nSo if you don't You don't have\nan IT planner, just think about for\n\n145\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:46.780\nyour organization where that\nparticular activity sits.\n\n146\n00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.700\nNow I can tell you that in your\ndownloadable material, and as\n\n147\n00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.770\nCherokee mentioned earlier on, does that\nmean we only got one loads of homework?\n\n148\n00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.890\nWell no you don't.\n\n149\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.870\nIn your downloadable material,\nthere is a case study.\n\n150\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.720\nAnd there is an exercise based on\nthat case study on where we would put\n\n151\n00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.870\nthese roles and roles and responsibilities\nincluding the responsibilities\n\n152\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.630\nof the architect or the designer\nas you might want to call them.\n\n153\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.790\nAnd that architect of designer has\nthat overall responsibility for\n\n154\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.660\ndesigning a new service, so\nthose functional requirements, etc, and\n\n155\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.330\nproducing all of the SLAs, and\nworking with service level management,\n\n156\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.630\ndesigning measurement systems with\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n157\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.540\nI have just mentioned just\na couple of processes in there but\n\n158\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.850\nsomebody who is designing and\nor an architect for\n\n159\n00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.530\na particular service well they're gonna\nbe working with more of these processes.\n\n160\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:46.350\nSo what I need you to do is\nI need you to ensure that\n\n161\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:51.220\nWhoever's undertaking these activities\nthat you have that racing matrix defined,\n\n162\n00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.790\nand that you understand who is\nperforming these activities, and\n\n163\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:02.290\nwhy those activities belong with that\nspecific role or with that specific team.\n\n164\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.840\nSo let's take a look at technology then.\n\n165\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.420\nNow I kind of jumped\nonto our next topic here.\n\n166\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.830\nAnd I want to make sure that you\ndo have the opportunity, and\n\n167\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.100\nnow is the time to take a break if you so\ndesire, to go and do your homework.\n\n168\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.520\nOr you can do it again at the end\nof this particular session.\n\n169\n00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.580\nBut let's take a look at\ntechnology Exactly the same\n\n170\n00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.380\nas our previous section on organization.\n\n171\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.510\nThere is no right or wrong.\n\n172\n00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:37.630\nIt really depends on your organization and\nwhat it is that you are trying to\n\n173\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.520\nsupport within your organization and\nwhat you're designing or\n\n174\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.680\nsubsequently going to be developing\nI love this, I love the quote.\n\n175\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.980\nAt the bottom of this particular slide.\n\n176\n00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.250\nI absolutely love it.\n\n177\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.555\nAnd it's one of this [INAUDIBLE] for\nyears in the ITIL world.\n\n178\n00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:57.144\nA fool with a tool is still a fool.\n\n179\n00:10:57.144 --> 00:10:59.520\nAnd I say it slighty differently to that.\n\n180\n00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.550\nAnd I will tell you.\n\n181\n00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.740\nAnd I used this saying very similar\nwhen it When it comes to tools.\n\n182\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.810\nAnd when it comes to automation.\n\n183\n00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.980\nIf you don't define your requirements\nfirst, then going out and\n\n184\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.240\nbuying a tool is just gonna get\nyou to a bad result quicker.\n\n185\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.600\nSimple as that.\n\n186\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.474\nYou can go on, you can automate\nwhatever you want to automate But\n\n187\n00:11:20.474 --> 00:11:23.486\nits just going to get you\nto a bad result quicker and\n\n188\n00:11:23.486 --> 00:11:27.644\nit is exactly the same you know a fool\nwith a tool is still a fool its just\n\n189\n00:11:27.644 --> 00:11:31.947\nthat it gets the job done with a little\nbit quicker and if the job is trying\n\n190\n00:11:31.947 --> 00:11:36.251\nto get done is a bad job then obviously\nthat is going to cause a problem.\n\n191\n00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:40.775\nThe general rule of thumb is that\na tool should support a process that is\n\n192\n00:11:40.775 --> 00:11:42.549\nthe general rule of thumb.\n\n193\n00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:48.020\nBut in practical terms as it says here\nthat you might have to redone your process\n\n194\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.670\nsometimes.\n\n195\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.670\nI wouldn't do that.\n\n196\n00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.330\nThe way that we work is that\nwe will define the process and\n\n197\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.700\nour tool will facilitate that process.\n\n198\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.470\nAnd then if there is any tweak to be\ninvolve then it needs to be very, very,\n\n199\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.140\nvery minute tweaking.\n\n200\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:08.140\nIf you're tool doesn't support your\nprocess Then it's not the right tool for\n\n201\n00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.110\nyou, it's as simple as that.\n\n202\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.320\nBy the way, the bottom bullet point,\nI love this bottom bullets point.\n\n203\n00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.620\nThey're about organization believe\nthat purchasing or developing a tool,\n\n204\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.156\nall of their problems are gonna be solved,\nit doesn't work\n\n205\n00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:21.725\nlike that, now come on, we know-\n&gt;&gt; You gotta know how to use\n\n206\n00:12:21.725 --> 00:12:22.537\nthe tool as well.\n\n207\n00:12:22.537 --> 00:12:26.335\nRight, exactly but even then if the tool\nis not gonna facilitate the right outcome\n\n208\n00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:29.530\nthen it doesn't really matter\nwhat tool it is that you bought.\n\n209\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.200\nIt's like the organization\nthat goes out and\n\n210\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.050\nselect a tool based on the fact\nthat it gets 500 reports.\n\n211\n00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.210\nIf you're not gonna use anyone of\nthose 500 reports then it doesn't\n\n212\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.970\nmatter how many it produces.\n\n213\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.560\nBecause 499 of them\nare irrelevant You have to\n\n214\n00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.260\nunderstand want you want a tool to\ndo before you can go out and buy it.\n\n215\n00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.840\nAnd this is our evaluation process for\ntool selection, and\n\n216\n00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:59.290\nyou can apply this to absolutely any\ntool or to any piece of software.\n\n217\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.850\nYou identify your requirements.\n\n218\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.170\nSo this comes from the organization.\n\n219\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.290\nAnd then also your requirements\nin terms of your process.\n\n220\n00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.090\nAnd you're going to identify what\nproducts there are out there and\n\n221\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.060\nthen you will have your\nselection criteria.\n\n222\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.500\nAnd now your selection criteria is\nbased on things like Supportability or\n\n223\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.500\ncost, or maintainability.\n\n224\n00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.350\nAnd then you evaluate your products\nbase on your selection criteria and\n\n225\n00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.690\nalso the ability to\nachieve the requirements.\n\n226\n00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.650\nAnd you produce a short list and\nyour scoring short list again base on,\n\n227\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.790\nits ability to achieve\nthe requirements and.\n\n228\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.800\nThe selection criteria, including things\nlike cost and supportability, etc,\n\n229\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.320\nand you rank the products and you select\nthe product that you are going to buy.\n\n230\n00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:53.140\nThis is an impartial way\nof selecting our tools.\n\n231\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.250\nI just want you to bear in\nmind where ITIL came from and\n\n232\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.380\nITIL came from the government.\n\n233\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.370\nAnd in the government we have to select\nour tools and we select any software and\n\n234\n00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.490\nany supply in a completely impartial way.\n\n235\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.480\nWe have to ensure that\neverybody is evaluated\n\n236\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.460\non exactly the same platform and this is\nwhere our evaluation process comes from,\n\n237\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.740\nit's a completely impartial\nevaluation process that enables you\n\n238\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.270\nTo evaluate a tool based\non your requirements.\n\n239\n00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.560\nAnd in terms of selection criteria,\nand I mentioned things like cost.\n\n240\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.160\nBut look at the other selection criteria\nthat you can have such as international\n\n241\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:39.760\nstandards conformity or maybe flexibility\nor support options as we've already said.\n\n242\n00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.620\nAll of these could be\nour selection criteria.\n\n243\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.720\nThe one thing that we will always do with\nevery single tool is we work out our\n\n244\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.240\nMoSCoW list, and MoSCoW is our,\nor MoSCoW, or MoSCoW,\n\n245\n00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.125\nhowever you prefer to pronounce\n&gt;&gt; I remember that debate.\n\n246\n00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:57.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've had this debate once,\n\n247\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.580\nwe're not having it again okay?\n\n248\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.590\nThat's our MoSCoW list I should have,\nI could have and\n\n249\n00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.730\nI would like in the future,\nor won't have right now.\n\n250\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.900\nAnd what I said to you is, that there\nis a principle involved in this.\n\n251\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:16.140\nCan you remember what percentage of must\nhaves we should achieve with any tool?\n\n252\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.180\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember.\n\n253\n00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:21.949\n&gt;&gt; It's about 80%.\n\n254\n00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:23.400\n&gt;&gt; 80%, okay, we'll [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n255\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.140\nYeah, so it's 80% your tools\nshould meet your must have needs,\n\n256\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.400\nor at least 80% of your must have needs.\n\n257\n00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.700\nAnd then it's up to you to decide how many\nof your should haves and your could haves,\n\n258\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.650\netcetera.\n\n259\n00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.770\nBut it should meet about 80%\nof your must have needs,\n\n260\n00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.060\nif it doesn't then it's probably\nnot the right tool for you.\n\n261\n00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.070\nUltimately tools can be.\n\n262\n00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:49.870\nPurchased and can be developed\noutside by other suppliers,\n\n263\n00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.510\nor by software houses, or\nthey can be developed in a house.\n\n264\n00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.310\nJust remember though, if we're talking\nabout service management tools.\n\n265\n00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.980\nThen we're looking for\na tool that possibly can be\n\n266\n00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.800\nintegrated with your suppliers and\nwith you know your customers perhaps.\n\n267\n00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.520\nAnd maybe even with other processes,\n\n268\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.620\nwithin other business areas such as HR,\netc.\n\n269\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.560\nAnd so if we're talking about this then\n\n270\n00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:19.880\nBringing in a tool from\nan outside organization\n\n271\n00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.940\nis probably going to be the best bet for\nyou in terms of compatibility.\n\n272\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.850\nBuilding something in house, you may\nhave issues with integration with that.\n\n273\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.210\nBut ultimately, only you know\nwhat's best for your organization.\n\n274\n00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.190\nSo, there we go.\n\n275\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.810\nWe've covered organizing for\nservice design, and\n\n276\n00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:42.170\nwe've also looked at technology\nconsiderations for service design.\n\n277\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.070\nAnd again, with technology,\nI have an exercise available for\n\n278\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.990\nyou on your downloadable material.\n\n279\n00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.780\nSo, I'd like you to go away and\nundertake those exercises.\n\n280\n00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.910\nAnd as per usual,\nI am available in the forum, so\n\n281\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.320\nif you do have any questions Then\nplease feel free to let me know.\n\n282\n00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:58.920\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Jo.\n\n283\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.840\nThank you.\nSo don't forget that we had\n\n284\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.580\nthose additional,\nthose supplemental study materials for\n\n285\n00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:10.330\nnot only organising service design, but\nalso for those technology considerations.\n\n286\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:11.190\nThat's it for this show.\n\n287\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.030\nWe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n288\n00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.830\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boost.\n\n289\n00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:15.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n290\n00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.386\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n291\n00:17:18.386 --> 00:17:24.285\n[MUSIC]\n\n292\n00:17:24.285 --> 00:17:26.240\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.025\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:14.020\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nIntermediate ITIL Series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.180\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.200\nIn this episode we'll be taking\na look at implementations of\n\n7\n00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.240\nour critical success\nfactors of service design.\n\n8\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.470\nAnd back with us today we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock, how are you today Jo?\n\n9\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.430\n&gt;&gt; I am absolutely great,\nCherokee how are you?\n\n10\n00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.550\nI'm very well, I just had some coffee, and\n\n11\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.248\nI am ready to talk about our\ncritical success factors.\n\n12\n00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:34.528\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Excellent!\n\n13\n00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:35.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, but\n\n14\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.790\nbefore we get into\ncritical success factors,\n\n15\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.260\nwe're gonna look at implementation.\n\n16\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n17\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.250\n&gt;&gt; And how we implement service design,\nand to be perfectly honest,\n\n18\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.710\nit's very straightforward.\n\n19\n00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.300\nAnd for those of you that have\ncompleted your foundation class,\n\n20\n00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.030\nwhich I'd like to hope that\nyou have watched that show.\n\n21\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.290\nAnd certainly you've\nlooked at the foundation\n\n22\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.670\nrecap at the beginning of\nthe service design show.\n\n23\n00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.230\nThen you will be very,\n\n24\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.770\nvery familiar with the diagram that's on\nthe screen in front of you right now!\n\n25\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.410\nThere we go.\nLook at that, as if by magic.\n\n26\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.261\nAnd this diagram is the CSI approach.\n\n27\n00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:16.540\nThe CSI approach is an incremental\napproach to implementing improvements.\n\n28\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.586\nAnd so, this is exactly the approach\nthat we will want to use,\n\n29\n00:01:19.586 --> 00:01:22.943\nwhen we're implementing service design,\nbecause you know what?\n\n30\n00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:27.602\nWhen we're implementing any process, when\nwe're implementing any life cycle phase,\n\n31\n00:01:27.602 --> 00:01:30.260\nit's an improvement to our current state.\n\n32\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.960\nAnd so therefore, it makes perfect\nsense to use the CSI approach to\n\n33\n00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.430\nactually improve our current state.\n\n34\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.220\nSo we start off by\nunderstanding our vision, and\n\n35\n00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.900\nwhat it is that we want to achieve.\n\n36\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.740\nWhat's our long-term goal?\n\n37\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.990\nAnd then, where are we right now?\n\n38\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.330\nThen, exactly where do we want to be,\nwhat's our next step,\n\n39\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.050\nhow are we going to get there, and\nthen, after we've managed that,\n\n40\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.810\nthen it's, did we get there,\nand then, what do we do next?\n\n41\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.350\nCuz, you don't just stop\nat one improvement.\n\n42\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.620\nCuz then, it doesn't stay an improvement\nfor very long, it becomes business as\n\n43\n00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.320\nusual, and very soon,\nthe value of it diminishes completely.\n\n44\n00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.720\nSo right at the very beginning,\n\n45\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.110\nwe're looking at alignment\nwith our organization.\n\n46\n00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.100\nSo what is the vision?\n\n47\n00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.850\nWhere do I want to be?\n\n48\n00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.100\nWell, I want to go to the beach.\n\n49\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.150\nThat's where I want to be.\n\n50\n00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.480\nSo I'm gonna head off in that direction,\ncuz I want to go to the beach.\n\n51\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.930\nSo now the first thing I look at is,\nand we put this into our GPS don't we,\n\n52\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.620\ninto our sat nav all the time.\n\n53\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.590\nWe say right, okay,\nI want to go to the beach.\n\n54\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.740\nOkay, so where am I right now?\n\n55\n00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.750\nWell I know where I am.\n\n56\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.855\nI'm probably about maybe\n17 miles from the beach,\n\n57\n00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:40.750\nit depends which beach I wanna go to,\nbut okay, I know where I am right now.\n\n58\n00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.340\nSo exactly where do I want to be?\n\n59\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.557\nWhat's my next step?\n\n60\n00:02:44.557 --> 00:02:51.437\nAnd this is where I work out my\nexact destination for my next step.\n\n61\n00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.350\nI only planned the short term in detail.\n\n62\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.810\nMy long term goal, well,\nI don't plan that in detail.\n\n63\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.380\nBut that's still my long term goal.\n\n64\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.850\nAnd then I work out how\nam I gonna get there?\n\n65\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.140\nWell, now I've worked it out.\n\n66\n00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.950\nI've put it into my GPS.\n\n67\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.864\nSo now I go.\n\n68\n00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:11.585\nOkay, how am I gonna get\nthere now I'm going to go?\n\n69\n00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:16.790\nAnd then once I get there I say have I\narrived at my destination, yes or no.\n\n70\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.840\nYes, I have.\n\n71\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.680\nOkay, so what next?\n\n72\n00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.760\nWhere am I gonna go next?\n\n73\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.089\nAnd we always wanna make sure that we are\naligned to the vision of the organization.\n\n74\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.580\nWe want to make sure that we understand\nthe direction that the organization's\n\n75\n00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.400\ngoing in and that everything that we do is\ngoing to help them achieve their vision.\n\n76\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.820\nBecause what we have to do of course,\nis facilitate their outcomes.\n\n77\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.390\nSo on our next two slides here,\nwe can take a look at,\n\n78\n00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.210\nfirst of all,\nour organizational maturity and\n\n79\n00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.210\nif we look at the business outcomes and\nthe organizational maturity grid.\n\n80\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.775\nThe culture maturity in the top there,\nyou'll see that we start off with,\n\n81\n00:03:58.775 --> 00:04:03.170\nwell, looking at our technology, that's\nalways the first place we start in IT.\n\n82\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.440\nAnd then we build that technology\nup because we are not just\n\n83\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.700\ntalking about individual pieces of\ntechnology, we're talking about services.\n\n84\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.480\nAnd we incorporate them,\nour customer and our business and\n\n85\n00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.410\nthen the entire value chain into our\nculture but we have to start off small.\n\n86\n00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.881\nAnd we start off looking at\nindividual technology pieces and\n\n87\n00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:29.275\nthen we build up the components\nof a service into a Service.\n\n88\n00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:32.228\nAnd then look at the value\nthat that service and\n\n89\n00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:34.970\nthat each service delivers to a customer.\n\n90\n00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.820\nIn the bottom, on our bottom slide there,\nwe've got our CMMI model.\n\n91\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.330\nOur CMMI scale of maturity of our\nservices, sorry of our processes.\n\n92\n00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.690\nWhat I can tell you about this, and\n\n93\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.129\nwe talk about this in much more depth in\nCSI, in Continual Service Improvement.\n\n94\n00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.080\nBut when we first start\noff with a process,\n\n95\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.168\nthen we start off as an initial phase.\n\n96\n00:04:58.168 --> 00:05:00.620\nAnd we will use this by\nthe way as an assessment\n\n97\n00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.950\nto look at how mature our processes are.\n\n98\n00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.560\nWe start off with the initial\nad hoc phase for any process.\n\n99\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.170\nIn other words, process is just\nbeing performed on an ad hoc basis.\n\n100\n00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.820\nThere is absolutely no consistency to it.\n\n101\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.597\nAnd then our processes over time,\n\n102\n00:05:17.597 --> 00:05:21.630\nwe'll actually like to think that\nthey mature and become repeatable.\n\n103\n00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.670\nAnd then become better defined and\nmanaged.\n\n104\n00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.940\nAnd by defined,\nwe mean we're able to measure them.\n\n105\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.180\nAnd then number four, level four,\nis that we manage them.\n\n106\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.240\nAnd level five is that we have continual\nservice improvement involved in\n\n107\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.000\nour process itself.\n\n108\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.660\nAnd so when we perform\nan assessment of our process.\n\n109\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.120\nThen we will always do that with a view\nto the CMMI process maturity model.\n\n110\n00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.010\nAnd look at exactly where\nwe are with each process.\n\n111\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.375\nNow as I've already said, we spend a lot\nmore time looking at process maturity and\n\n112\n00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:56.097\nculture maturity in CSI.\n\n113\n00:05:56.097 --> 00:06:00.444\nSo please take a look at the CSI show If\nyou do need more information then go to\n\n114\n00:06:00.444 --> 00:06:03.273\nthe CSI show and\nlook at assessment techniques.\n\n115\n00:06:03.273 --> 00:06:07.379\nOr you can, by all means,\ngo to the internet and\n\n116\n00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:13.930\ntake a look at the CMMI Institute,\nthe Capability Maturity Model.\n\n117\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.150\nIt comes from the Software and\nEngineer Institute, but\n\n118\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.450\nthere's now actually\na CMMI Institute as well.\n\n119\n00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.020\nPredominantly at just CMMI in\nprocess maturity and assessments.\n\n120\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.008\nWe have to implement service\ndesign from somewhere,\n\n121\n00:06:28.008 --> 00:06:31.820\nand to ensure that it's a success,\nwe've got to be able to measure it.\n\n122\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.850\nYou know there is a saying,\nif you can't measure something,\n\n123\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.720\nthan you can't manage it and\nif you're not measuring it,\n\n124\n00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.785\nthen there's an implication that you\ndon't care about how well it performs.\n\n125\n00:06:41.785 --> 00:06:47.700\nSo we want to ensure that not only can\nwe measure that service design performs,\n\n126\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:54.150\nbut we also need to measure that service\ndesign is actually achieving its goals.\n\n127\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.970\nAnd we here in service design design\nall of our processes as well.\n\n128\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:05.010\nSo we will use methods like Lean Sigma or\nSix Sigma which actually looks at\n\n129\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.060\nprocess efficiency, and we'll use this\nparticular method to help us not only\n\n130\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.220\ndefine our processes but also help us\nensure that our processes are efficient.\n\n131\n00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.590\nAnd we talk about minimal waste in\nterms of Lean Sigma and Six Sigma, and\n\n132\n00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.410\nit's about that efficiency\nof our processes.\n\n133\n00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.970\nAnd again, In CSI,\nwe look at using the lean or\n\n134\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.180\nSix Sigma to help us\nwith process efficiency.\n\n135\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.840\nUltimately what we're interested\nin in ITIL is the efficient and\n\n136\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.890\neffective facilitation of outcomes for\nthe organization.\n\n137\n00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.430\nAnd so all of these methods and\n\n138\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.150\nall of these techniques are going\nto help us to achieve that.\n\n139\n00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.010\nAnd again, look at those words that I've\njust mentioned, efficient and effective.\n\n140\n00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:54.240\nThese are what I call our two Es for\nservice management and two Es for ITIL.\n\n141\n00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.313\nAll of our measurements have\nto have clearly defined goals.\n\n142\n00:07:57.313 --> 00:08:00.553\nAnd all of our processes,\nand our functions and\n\n143\n00:08:00.553 --> 00:08:04.847\nour services have to have clearly\ndefined objectives as well.\n\n144\n00:08:04.847 --> 00:08:08.626\nWe also have to be able to\nunderstand the interfaces and\n\n145\n00:08:08.626 --> 00:08:12.816\nthe dependencies between our processes and\nour services and\n\n146\n00:08:12.816 --> 00:08:16.860\nall of our functional areas,\ntoo, so what fits in where.\n\n147\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:23.033\nAnd it's only by understanding that,\nthat we can then, well, count and\n\n148\n00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:26.639\nmeasure the performance\nagainst those objectives and\n\n149\n00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.633\nagainst those goals that\nwe want to achieve.\n\n150\n00:08:29.633 --> 00:08:35.225\nWe have to be able to demonstrate not only\nthe overall health of service design,\n\n151\n00:08:35.225 --> 00:08:39.658\nbut demonstrate the overall\nhealth of IT service management.\n\n152\n00:08:39.658 --> 00:08:43.260\nAnd that includes all of the processes\nwithin service strategy.\n\n153\n00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.590\nAnd all of those processes within design\nand transition and service operation.\n\n154\n00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.818\nWe have to ensure that we are continually\naligned to the needs of the organization.\n\n155\n00:08:52.818 --> 00:08:57.870\nAnd here in service design is\nwhere we design our services.\n\n156\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:03.060\nHere in service design is where we\ndesign the efficiency of our services.\n\n157\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.440\nSo of course,\nwhen we're implementing service design,\n\n158\n00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.640\nthe first thing that we've really gotta go\nover, and when we're designing any process\n\n159\n00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.990\nand any service, we've gotta get\nover these resistance to change.\n\n160\n00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.820\nThere's going to be\na resistance to change.\n\n161\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.450\nNo matter which way we look at this, when\nwe're implementing any new service and\n\n162\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.530\nany new process.\n\n163\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.110\nSo we actually cover this\ntopic in a lot more depth\n\n164\n00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.440\nwhen we look in service\ntransition change management.\n\n165\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.150\nWhen we look in CSI and\ncontinue with service improvement.\n\n166\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.890\nAnd also,\nin our ITIL practitioner shows as well.\n\n167\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.153\nSo we will look at overcoming\nthat resistance to change and\n\n168\n00:09:41.153 --> 00:09:44.808\nwe call this organizational\nchange management.\n\n169\n00:09:44.808 --> 00:09:48.648\nWhat other challenges might we\nhave then within service design?\n\n170\n00:09:48.648 --> 00:09:52.018\nWell, I'm not gonna read all of these,\ncuz quite clearly you can read these for\n\n171\n00:09:52.018 --> 00:09:52.530\nyourself.\n\n172\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.430\nHowever, let's take a look at the changing\nrequirements from the business or\n\n173\n00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.958\nunclear requirements from the business.\n\n174\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.665\nWe talked about this in\nour previous episode, and\n\n175\n00:10:01.665 --> 00:10:03.930\nwe looked at different ways around this.\n\n176\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.050\nThings like workshops and\nobservation techniques, etc.\n\n177\n00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.328\nBecause the business will tell\nus that they want one thing.\n\n178\n00:10:10.328 --> 00:10:13.883\nBut are they actually able\nto fully articulate what it\n\n179\n00:10:13.883 --> 00:10:16.550\nis that they need to be able to do?\n\n180\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.310\nWhat outcomes do they want facilitated?\n\n181\n00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.676\nIn a previous episode, I asked\nCherokee how she sends an email, and\n\n182\n00:10:23.676 --> 00:10:25.910\nshe said to me, well, I use my PC.\n\n183\n00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.164\nAnd I thought, oo, well,\nthat's articulated well, isn't it?\n\n184\n00:10:30.164 --> 00:10:30.664\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n185\n00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:33.529\n&gt;&gt; So if I'm designing a service that's\n\n186\n00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:38.452\ngoing to help her to send an email,\nwell, what that means is that I\n\n187\n00:10:38.452 --> 00:10:43.390\nhave got carte blanche to do\nabsolutely anything that I want.\n\n188\n00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:47.210\nBecause all she's told me so\nfar is that she wants to use her PC.\n\n189\n00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.811\nShe later changed that, and she later then\ntold me that you wanted to use a pad or\n\n190\n00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:53.220\na phone or even a watch.\n\n191\n00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.432\nNow how on Earth she plans on sending\nan email on her watch, I don't know.\n\n192\n00:10:57.432 --> 00:10:59.182\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll take my microscope out for that.\n\n193\n00:10:59.182 --> 00:11:03.537\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right, either that,\nor have a really good Siri!\n\n194\n00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:04.539\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n195\n00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:07.712\nthe simple fact is that if we\ndo get unclear requirements\n\n196\n00:11:07.712 --> 00:11:11.290\nfrom the organization, and\nwhat Cherokee didn't realize was\n\n197\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.435\nthat she was playing right\ninto my hands with that one.\n\n198\n00:11:14.435 --> 00:11:17.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because that's a perfect example\n\n199\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.210\nof when we actually need to work\nout what it is they want to do,\n\n200\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.880\nand how they usually work.\n\n201\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.265\nBecause otherwise,\nI'm gonna design a solution for\n\n202\n00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:30.290\nher that's gonna be, well, unusable,\nthat she's not going to use.\n\n203\n00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.710\nAnd how much value will\nshe perceive in this?\n\n204\n00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.735\nAnd let's go back to the foundation and\nlet's go back to service strategy and\n\n205\n00:11:35.735 --> 00:11:38.079\nlet's look at the fact\nthe value is perceived.\n\n206\n00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.550\nThere's another one that I wanna\ndraw your attention to, and\n\n207\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:47.020\nthat's the resistance to planning or\nlack of planning.\n\n208\n00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.962\nWe're all guilty of that, aren't we?\n\n209\n00:11:49.962 --> 00:11:51.213\nI know I am.\n\n210\n00:11:51.213 --> 00:11:53.197\n&gt;&gt; You just put it off, put it off.\n\n211\n00:11:53.197 --> 00:11:54.656\n&gt;&gt; No, that's too soon to get on with it.\n\n212\n00:11:54.656 --> 00:11:56.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Forget planning,\n\n213\n00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.950\nI'm just gonna go and do it.\n\n214\n00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.320\nWhen it comes to actually\nplanning something out,\n\n215\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.330\nI'm probably the world's worst.\n\n216\n00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.981\nEven though I am a project manager,\nI am the world's worst.\n\n217\n00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:07.659\nAnd I will be the one that says, well,\n\n218\n00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:10.878\nlook, I know exactly how it needs to\nbe done and this how I'm gonna do it.\n\n219\n00:12:10.878 --> 00:12:15.570\n[LAUGH] And so,\nthere is a natural resistance to planning.\n\n220\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.260\nYou have some people, and\nthis comes down to personality,\n\n221\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.560\nyou'll have some people\nwho are natural planners.\n\n222\n00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.879\nAnd will spend longer planning\nthan they will actually doing.\n\n223\n00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:27.416\nAnd then you have other people who\nwould rather be doing than planning.\n\n224\n00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:29.254\nAnd so it's getting that balance right and\n\n225\n00:12:29.254 --> 00:12:31.622\nacknowledging the fact that\nthere has to be a balance.\n\n226\n00:12:31.622 --> 00:12:33.545\n&gt;&gt; You should've seen me trying\nto pack this last weekend.\n\n227\n00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n228\n00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.185\nit took me longer to come up with my lists\nof what I was gonna bring on the trip.\n\n229\n00:12:39.185 --> 00:12:40.493\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, you see,\n\n230\n00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:44.399\nnow I travel every single week, and I can\ntell you now that I pack in ten minutes.\n\n231\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.599\nAnd so we all got different personalities.\n\n232\n00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:50.369\nWe've all got different ways of working.\n\n233\n00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:53.000\nAnd so\nthere could be a resistance to planning.\n\n234\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.708\nOr there could be a resistance to actually\ngetting on and doing something as well.\n\n235\n00:12:56.708 --> 00:13:00.866\nThere's that reluctance,\nthere's that fear of making a mistake or\n\n236\n00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:02.235\nwhat if it goes wrong?\n\n237\n00:13:02.235 --> 00:13:03.270\n&gt;&gt; I forgot my toothbrush.\n\n238\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n[LAUGH] I forgot my toothbrush.\n\n239\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.332\nHey, look,\n\n240\n00:13:06.332 --> 00:13:11.401\nthere's always a pharmacy around somewhere\nwhere you can buy a toothbrush, right?\n\n241\n00:13:11.401 --> 00:13:13.572\nEverywhere in the world,\nthere's one of those.\n\n242\n00:13:13.572 --> 00:13:16.249\nBut people will panic about whether\nthey've remembered their toothbrush or\n\n243\n00:13:16.249 --> 00:13:16.775\nnot, right?\n\n244\n00:13:16.775 --> 00:13:20.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Think about lack of knowledge as well.\n\n245\n00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:22.640\nAnd again, that plays to the fear.\n\n246\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.950\nIf you have forgotten your toothbrush,\nand you're worried about forgetting your\n\n247\n00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.340\ntoothbrush, if you don't know where you're\ngoing, and you don't know the area,\n\n248\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.080\nthen you might be worried that\nthere won't be a pharmacy anywhere.\n\n249\n00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.450\nWell, you know what?\n\n250\n00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.840\nYou can gain knowledge.\n\n251\n00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.600\nYou can gain knowledge\nabout an environment.\n\n252\n00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.210\nYou can gain knowledge\nabout a new service.\n\n253\n00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.670\nYou can always gain knowledge.\n\n254\n00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.605\nHowever, it's very, very important\nto gain knowledge before you\n\n255\n00:13:47.605 --> 00:13:50.123\nactually start on the road\nto doing something.\n\n256\n00:13:50.123 --> 00:13:53.577\nIt's no good going out to try and\nfind a pharmacy.\n\n257\n00:13:53.577 --> 00:13:57.798\nAnd then just driving aimlessly for three\nhours just looking for one, when it turns\n\n258\n00:13:57.798 --> 00:14:01.414\nout that if you turned right at that\nfirst set of lights that you come to,\n\n259\n00:14:01.414 --> 00:14:03.060\nyou would've found one there.\n\n260\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.556\n&gt;&gt; I think we should start a book of\nJoisms, because that was pretty amazing.\n\n261\n00:14:06.556 --> 00:14:09.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just having the knowledge before you\n\n262\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.179\nattempt, who would've ever thought?\n\n263\n00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:15.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah, that's quite\na good place to start, though, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.490\nAnd what about poor relationships and\npoor communication?\n\n265\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.710\nAgain, that is another challenge.\n\n266\n00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.490\nAnd I hate to mention this again, but\nwhile we're talking about personalities,\n\n267\n00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.990\nwhat about personality conflicts?\n\n268\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:33.980\nIt happens, and in ITIL, we acknowledge\nthat the way that we're organized and\n\n269\n00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.800\nwho are management are,\nactually it's an asset to our services.\n\n270\n00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.280\nIt's what we call a capability,\nand of course,\n\n271\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.330\nwe mentioned this in our\nfoundation recap as well.\n\n272\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:48.250\nSo personality conflicts,\nthey're the complete opposite to an asset.\n\n273\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.850\nIf two people don't get\non in the same team, or\n\n274\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.160\nif you've got project management and,\ndare I say it,\n\n275\n00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.990\nservice management fighting against\neach other, well, guess what?\n\n276\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.681\nYou're not going to get efficiency, and\n\n277\n00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:03.009\nyou're certainly not gonna\nget effectiveness either.\n\n278\n00:15:03.009 --> 00:15:06.009\nSo personality, poor relationships, etc.,\n\n279\n00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:10.484\nreally does have a detrimental effect\non the success of service design.\n\n280\n00:15:10.484 --> 00:15:14.482\n&gt;&gt; And Joe, I've noticed, even with\npeople who have very good credentials,\n\n281\n00:15:14.482 --> 00:15:18.669\nhigh education levels, they feel very\npassionate about what they're doing,\n\n282\n00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:20.931\nwhat they've studied their entire life.\n\n283\n00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:24.600\nSo a lot of time you do see those\nstrong personalities clashing.\n\n284\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.050\nAnd it's great that they're\npassionate about it.\n\n285\n00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.673\nBut just being able to\ncommunicate in an effect way,\n\n286\n00:15:28.673 --> 00:15:31.430\nthat's really the key here, right?\n\n287\n00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.380\n&gt;&gt; And it's about acknowledging\nthat two opinions do exist.\n\n288\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.102\n&gt;&gt; Right!\n&gt;&gt; And it's okay to have separate\n\n289\n00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:38.842\nopinions and what you need to\ndo is find some common ground.\n\n290\n00:15:38.842 --> 00:15:43.844\nAnd when it comes to project management\nand when comes to service management,\n\n291\n00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:46.820\nyou have to look at what\nbenefits the end user.\n\n292\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.090\nAnd it's not necessarily\nabout personal preference.\n\n293\n00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.012\nIt's about the preference of the end user.\n\n294\n00:15:51.012 --> 00:15:54.229\nAnd whether you agree with\nwhat they want or not,\n\n295\n00:15:54.229 --> 00:15:57.612\nthen you have to think\nabout what's best for them.\n\n296\n00:15:57.612 --> 00:16:00.128\nAnd sometimes, you kinda have\nto swallow your pride on this.\n\n297\n00:16:00.128 --> 00:16:02.032\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n[INAUDIBLE] down a little bit.\n\n298\n00:16:02.032 --> 00:16:03.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Yeah.\n\n299\n00:16:03.405 --> 00:16:07.039\nAnd I mean look at all the other\nchallenges there are as well about tools\n\n300\n00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:07.850\nfor instance.\n\n301\n00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.650\nAnd again it talks about\nlack of information and\n\n302\n00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.830\nover commitment of available resources.\n\n303\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.740\nI'm gonna mention people again in there.\n\n304\n00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.290\nYou know there's a tendency,\nif you have one person that is\n\n305\n00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.710\na guru Is knowledgeable about\na certain particular topic or\n\n306\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.320\none person who's always\nwilling to help even.\n\n307\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.240\nThen your tendency is to\ngo with that one person.\n\n308\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.463\nAnd again, you got an obvious utilization\nof resource there and that you're going to\n\n309\n00:16:35.463 --> 00:16:40.703\nuse just the one person or you're going to\nwant to gravitate towards that one person.\n\n310\n00:16:40.703 --> 00:16:43.572\nWhen in fact somebody else\ncould actually help you or\n\n311\n00:16:43.572 --> 00:16:46.670\nsomebody else can do the work for you but.\n\n312\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.810\nMaybe you doubt the quality of\nthat person, we all do this.\n\n313\n00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.950\nWe do.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n314\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.380\nI am so guilty, Jo, and\nI saw something today,\n\n315\n00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.720\nI can't even remember how the quote went\nbut it's like, okay can you just do this?\n\n316\n00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.410\nAnd it's like, wait!\n\n317\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.145\nBut not that way.\n\n318\n00:16:59.145 --> 00:17:01.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me do it my way.\n\n319\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:06.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that happens in\nproject management all the time.\n\n320\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.170\nWe talk about empowering\npeople a lot in ITIL and\n\n321\n00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.870\nwe talk about this when we talk in CSI\nabout Kotter's eight steps, etc, which\n\n322\n00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:19.230\nis something that we use, a technique that\nwe use to overcome resistance to change.\n\n323\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:23.620\nAnd we'll actually mention the fact that\nyou've gotta get people on board, and\n\n324\n00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.250\nyou've got to empower them.\n\n325\n00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.650\nAnd you've gotta trust that\nthey're gonna deliver the goods.\n\n326\n00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:33.220\nAnd sometimes it might not be your way,\nbut that's okay, because as long as they\n\n327\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:38.920\ndeliver the outcome that you wanted, then\neverybody works in a different way, okay?\n\n328\n00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.020\nSo let's take a look at some of\nthe other challenges that we've got,\n\n329\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.690\nsuch as cost and budget, etc.\n\n330\n00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.580\nA the lack of focus on what\nthe customer actually wants,\n\n331\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.740\nthat's a difficult one as well.\n\n332\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.870\nAnd the bottom one there about difficulty\nin ascertaining the ROI the return\n\n333\n00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.410\non investment or\nthat realization of business benefit.\n\n334\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.600\nI know that I've mentioned\nin previous episodes and\n\n335\n00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.480\nI know that I've certainly mentioned\nin service strategy and in CSI as well.\n\n336\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.610\nBut sometimes it can be quite\ndifficult to quantify the ROI and\n\n337\n00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.610\nespecially if that ROI is quality related.\n\n338\n00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:18.460\nAnd if that ROI is related to say\nachievement of legislative requirements or\n\n339\n00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.746\nregulatory requirements or\nmaybe it's just a case of quality.\n\n340\n00:18:22.746 --> 00:18:25.060\n&gt;&gt; Security, especially.\n&gt;&gt; Right, security, yeah.\n\n341\n00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.480\nThere's not necessarily a tangible\nreturn on investments in that.\n\n342\n00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.400\nAnd so It can be difficult\nsometimes to quantify that.\n\n343\n00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.140\nBut of course, business relationship\nmanagement is going to help you with this.\n\n344\n00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.800\nBecause business relationship management\nwill tell you what the organization\n\n345\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.364\nvalues.\n\n346\n00:18:42.364 --> 00:18:46.180\nSo what about CSF then for\nservice design, okay?\n\n347\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.870\nWell, the CSF is something\nthat we have to achieve.\n\n348\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.760\nAnd, of course, we'll tell you that for\nevery CSF that you define, you should\n\n349\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.920\nhave at least two or three KPIs, so we'll\ntell you if you are achieving that CSF.\n\n350\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.910\nSo, of course, look\n\n351\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:07.080\nat the CSFs that we have got defined\nthere, very, very high level.\n\n352\n00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.300\nAnalyzing how well our\ninfrastructure was designed or\n\n353\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:15.300\nwhat about a service that's being defined\nto meet requirements for availability and\n\n354\n00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.150\nsecurity and serviceability and\nfunctionality.\n\n355\n00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.910\nWell whatever our CSFs are,\nwe've got to be able to measure them.\n\n356\n00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.790\nAnd so we measure them using KPIs.\n\n357\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:30.300\nAnd so our KPIs are normally\nperceived as maybe a percentage\n\n358\n00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.990\ncertainly over a period of time.\n\n359\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.370\nWe need to measure these\nover a period of time.\n\n360\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:41.840\nSo for instance the percentage of service\ndesign packages completed on time.\n\n361\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.830\nThen that would be on time over\na period of, say, six months.\n\n362\n00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:51.250\nOr the accuracy of the cost estimate\nof the whole service design stage.\n\n363\n00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:57.151\nI'd want to see that of the project over\na period of six months or 12 months etc.\n\n364\n00:19:57.151 --> 00:20:00.967\nThe accuracy of the service level\ntargets for instance again,\n\n365\n00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:03.640\nI want to see these over\na set period of time.\n\n366\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.340\nBut only you will define the right\nKPIs for your organization and for\n\n367\n00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.920\nyour individual project and\nyour individual implementation, too.\n\n368\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.480\nSo what can cause service\ndesign to fail and\n\n369\n00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.730\nwhat are the external factors that\ncould cause service design to fail?\n\n370\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:28.165\nWell, we talk about maturity\nlevels of one process is low.\n\n371\n00:20:28.165 --> 00:20:31.110\nYou got to be really careful\nwith your processes.\n\n372\n00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.060\nAnd when you're implementing processes\nthink about what processes you\n\n373\n00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.740\nwant to implement first.\n\n374\n00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.070\nAnd the answer is never all of them,\nright.\n\n375\n00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.510\nYou never ever when you're implementing\nITIL want to go all out and\n\n376\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.950\nimplement absolutely everything.\n\n377\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.100\nThat is not going to work.\n\n378\n00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.860\nWell, it will work,\nit will result in complete chaos,.\n\n379\n00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.650\nThat's what it will achieve but\nthat's not something that we want to do.\n\n380\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.280\nSo think about the CSI approach and\nwe'll do one at a time.\n\n381\n00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.790\nAnd it's okay to get one to a specific\nmaturity level and then work on another\n\n382\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.550\none and then work on another one\nas long as that is in your plan.\n\n383\n00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:11.380\nBut when you're up to say level three in\nyour CMMI scale on one process then you've\n\n384\n00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.330\ngot one that's down at level one, well\nthere's your opportunity for improvement.\n\n385\n00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.810\nThat's where you have to improve.\n\n386\n00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.280\nWhat other risk are there,\n\n387\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.890\nwhat other external factors are there\nthat could cause design to fail?\n\n388\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.170\nWell let's go back to\nthe business requirements.\n\n389\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.000\nAnd having poor business\nrelationship management which\n\n390\n00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.310\naddresses things like requirements and\ntime scales ect and\n\n391\n00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:35.780\nalso addresses the testing aspect in\ngetting the business involved and tested.\n\n392\n00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:41.970\nThat could all be a risk to successful\ndesign and that balance between risk and\n\n393\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:46.930\ncost and innovation or between cost and\nschedule and functionality,\n\n394\n00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.830\ngetting the balances wrong,\nthat can be a risk as well.\n\n395\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.240\nThat can cause us to fail.\n\n396\n00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.310\nAnd over or under engineered processes.\n\n397\n00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:03.530\nOver engineered processes are the biggest\nbane of my existence, I have to say.\n\n398\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.050\nIf I see a process that's over-engineered,\n\n399\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.040\nthen in terms of maturity,\nit's not gonna be great.\n\n400\n00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.190\nAnd in fact in terms of CSI,\nit's clearly not working at all.\n\n401\n00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.430\nSo it's never gonna make level five.\n\n402\n00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.700\nBut as far as efficiency is concerned?\n\n403\n00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.550\nIf it's over engineered,\nit's generally not going to be efficient.\n\n404\n00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.540\nI think of change management as a process\nthat's generally poorly designed,\n\n405\n00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.080\nbecause we design in too much\nbureaucracy into change management.\n\n406\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.900\nAnd that actually causes inefficiencies,\nnot efficiencies.\n\n407\n00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.690\nAnd so we wanna use models.\n\n408\n00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:40.280\nWe make use of process models in order\nto ensure efficiencies in our processes.\n\n409\n00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.530\nSo I wanna take you back to\nyour foundational material and\n\n410\n00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.280\nI wanna take you back to\nthe foundation recap.\n\n411\n00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.400\nAnd I want to take you back\nto service transition and\n\n412\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.280\ninto service operation where we explore in\ngreater depths process models themselves.\n\n413\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.610\nAnd then think about commitment.\n\n414\n00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:01.160\nAnd it says here about commitment\nwith functional development but\n\n415\n00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.060\nI'm thinking about management\ncommitment as well.\n\n416\n00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.330\nAnd I'm thinking about commitment\nfrom the organization.\n\n417\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:11.380\nThere has to be an ongoing visible\ncommitment to service design in order for\n\n418\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.220\nservice design to succeed.\n\n419\n00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.760\nSo now at this point in time then,\nwe have reached the end of\n\n420\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.390\nour how would I say coaching\nepisodes in service design.\n\n421\n00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.910\nSo what I'd like you to do\ncertainly at this point,\n\n422\n00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.130\nis to go back over your material.\n\n423\n00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.600\nYou do have a couple of exercises that\nlook at organization for service design,\n\n424\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.020\nthen look at implementation of service\ndesign and I'd like you to go over them.\n\n425\n00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:44.000\nAnd then what I'd like you to do\nis I would like you then to review\n\n426\n00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.250\nour episode on preparing for\nyour intermediate exam.\n\n427\n00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:54.090\nAnd at the end of that episode, then I\nwould like you to undertake sample paper\n\n428\n00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:58.670\none, which is in your downloadable\nmaterial for service design.\n\n429\n00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.530\nAnd once you've done that,\nthen join us again and\n\n430\n00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.960\nwe will go all over a sample\npaper one together.\n\n431\n00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.444\nAnd we will take a look at\nthe specific questions in that\n\n432\n00:24:09.444 --> 00:24:12.570\nsample paper in a couple of episodes.\n\n433\n00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:17.025\nSo if you do have any questions then\nplease feel free to join us in the forum\n\n434\n00:24:17.025 --> 00:24:19.610\nand we'll be happy to help you.\n\n435\n00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.290\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for leading us through\nthat process of service design,\n\n436\n00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.430\nJo, as well as all those\nother proceeding processes.\n\n437\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.280\nSo thank you for\nbeing out there with us as well, but\n\n438\n00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.010\nyou've got some work to do like she said.\n\n439\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.670\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out and let you get to that.\n\n440\n00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.740\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n441\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.540\nAs your host I've been Cherokee Boose.\n\n442\n00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n443\n00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.695\n&gt;&gt;

great to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:45.414\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n15\n00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:48.040\nJo now, again, what I said is true, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.868\nThe very fact is that\nthey've gotten to this point,\n\n17\n00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:53.630\nthey now need to really\nfocus in on the exam.\n\n18\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.720\nLearning the material, of course,\nis foremost and key but getting ready for\n\n19\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.860\nthe exam is a big part of this as well.\n\n20\n00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.430\nSo where are we gonna begin?\n\n21\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.923\n&gt;&gt; So yes, you're right,\nwe've completed the class.\n\n22\n00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:06.194\nCongratulations everybody,\n\n23\n00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:11.093\nyou've put in the prerequisite\n21 hours worth of contact time.\n\n24\n00:01:11.093 --> 00:01:16.162\nAs we say in the course syllabus with\nboth me, an accredited instructor,\n\n25\n00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:20.660\nand also by going through the material\nthat you've been given and\n\n26\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.790\nprovided with your course materials.\n\n27\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.020\nSo now, it's time for the exam, and\n\n28\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.180\nI know Ronnie, that's a dreaded word for\nsome people, right?\n\n29\n00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.773\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But don't worry,\n\n30\n00:01:31.773 --> 00:01:33.848\nI'm here to guide you through it.\n\n31\n00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:36.987\nI can't promise that [LAUGH] I'm\ngonna give you a pass on this, but\n\n32\n00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:39.683\nI tell you what,\nif you listen to everything that I say.\n\n33\n00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:43.817\nAnd if you follow all the instructions and\nmake sure that you read the question,\n\n34\n00:01:43.817 --> 00:01:47.020\nthen you should find it really,\nreally straightforward.\n\n35\n00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.401\nSo please don't worry,\n\n36\n00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:53.014\nnow is the time actually to relax because\nyou've done all of your learning, okay.\n\n37\n00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:57.346\nSo the first thing that I want you\nto do is, I want you to go away and\n\n38\n00:01:57.346 --> 00:02:01.040\nto ensure that you have\ndownloaded the sample papers,\n\n39\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.753\nthat were given to you as\npart of the course materials.\n\n40\n00:02:04.753 --> 00:02:08.945\nNow if you didn't receive them as\npart of the course materials or\n\n41\n00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:13.913\nyou feel that you might want to check\nout the Acellus website which obviously\n\n42\n00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:17.025\nAcellus also the people that own ITIL now.\n\n43\n00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:22.905\nThen please feel free to go to\ntheir website at www.axelos.org,\n\n44\n00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:28.050\nand if you type in the search there,\nITIL intermediate and\n\n45\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.572\nyou can download a sample\npaper from that website.\n\n46\n00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:37.137\nSo what we're going to do over the next\nfew moments is that I'm gonna take you to\n\n47\n00:02:37.137 --> 00:02:38.462\nsome exam technique.\n\n48\n00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:43.144\nAnd then I'm going to ask you to go\naway and attempt sample paper one,\n\n49\n00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:45.743\nonce you completed sample paper one.\n\n50\n00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:47.577\nThen I'm gonna over it with you and\n\n51\n00:02:47.577 --> 00:02:51.383\nI'm gonna make sure that you have\npicked out all of the salient points.\n\n52\n00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:54.710\nAnd all of the relevant points and\neverything that you need in order to,\n\n53\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.880\nto get the right answer.\n\n54\n00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:59.123\nYeah, talking about the right answer.\n\n55\n00:02:59.123 --> 00:03:05.820\nTake a look at this slide, okay, there is\nno right answer; there is no wrong answer.\n\n56\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.260\nWhat you've got is a best fit answer.\n\n57\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.030\nNow I know that way, way back in\nthe introduction to our class I very,\n\n58\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.980\nvery briefly mentioned\nthe exam at the end of this.\n\n59\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.150\nAnd I said to you that it was\ncomplex multiple choice exam.\n\n60\n00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.250\nAnd they looked at, I think the word in\nthere we used right at the very start\n\n61\n00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.190\nof the class was most correct and\nI use the words best fit, and\n\n62\n00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.690\nthat's what I like to use.\n\n63\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.050\nThe best fit answer is five points,\nyour second best answer is three points.\n\n64\n00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.650\nThen your first your third-best\nanswer will give you one point and\n\n65\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.970\nthen we've got this\ndistractor that we mentioned.\n\n66\n00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.960\nBoy, is that there to distract.\n\n67\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.400\nThe distractor will quite often\nuse some nice, pretty words,\n\n68\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.460\nthe words that you find in\nyour ITIL publications.\n\n69\n00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.250\nYou say, you know?\n\n70\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.440\nThat sounds great because it's\nmentioned all of these processes and\n\n71\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.640\nit's mentioned all of these Functions and\nit's mentioned all of these activities,\n\n72\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.370\nthat's gotta be the right answer, right?\n\n73\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.240\nNo, because the right answer,\nthe best fit answer,\n\n74\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.120\nhas got to be completely relevant to\nthis scenario, completely relevant.\n\n75\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.180\nSo, sometimes the best fit\nanswer doesn't actually\n\n76\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.520\nuse any of the ITIL wording at all.\n\n77\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.710\nSo, be careful, that distractor is\ncalled a distractor for a reason, right?\n\n78\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.300\nSo the exam, let me tell you about\nit then, you get 90 minutes.\n\n79\n00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.830\nThat's an hour and\na half you get to complete this exam and\n\n80\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.320\nyou will be given eight\nmultiple choice questions.\n\n81\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320\nSo you get two booklets,\nyou get a scenario booklet and\n\n82\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.410\nyou get a question booklet.\n\n83\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.490\nOkay, now, be very, very careful, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.270\nThe scenario booklet,\nas it says there, sets the scene,\n\n85\n00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.940\nthe question booklet asks the question.\n\n86\n00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.610\nOkay, fairly straightforward not really.\n\n87\n00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:59.049\nFirst thing that I want you to check\nwhen you see your question booklet,\n\n88\n00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:03.267\nis at the top of every single question,\nan boy is this important.\n\n89\n00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:09.453\nDon't forget this, at the top of\nevery single question it says,\n\n90\n00:05:09.453 --> 00:05:16.092\nrefer to scenario x Sometimes,\nnot all the time, not in every paper.\n\n91\n00:05:16.092 --> 00:05:22.235\nAnd in fact it's a rarity I'll admit, but\nsometimes you've got one scenario for\n\n92\n00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:28.303\ntwo questions, in other words, two\nquestions refer to just that one scenario.\n\n93\n00:05:28.303 --> 00:05:32.822\nBest way to ascertain whether that's\nthe case in your particular exam\n\n94\n00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:36.370\nis scroll through to the end\nof the scenario booklet.\n\n95\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.740\nLook at the end of the scenario booklet.\n\n96\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.200\nSee how many you've got.\n\n97\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.900\nIf you've only got seven, then that means\nthat somewhere in your question booklet,\n\n98\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.800\nyou've got two questions for\nonce scenario.\n\n99\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.300\nThis is not the norm,\nit's not in every single paper but\n\n100\n00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.660\nit's one definitely\nworth watching out for.\n\n101\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.190\nSo always look at them,\nright at the very, very top.\n\n102\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.480\nTake a look,\nsee what scenario it refers to.\n\n103\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.410\nYou've gotta get a total of 28\npoints out of 40 in order to\n\n104\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.960\npass the ITL Intermediate,\nthe life cycle phase, so think about this.\n\n105\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.580\nYou can't get all 3s, that's not going to\nwork, you have to get some 5 pointers.\n\n106\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.610\nObviously, what I'd like you to\ndo is get all five pointers and\n\n107\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.750\n40 out of 40 by the way is not impossible.\n\n108\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.660\nIt really, really isn't impossible and\n\n109\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.930\nI have quite a few delegates that\ndo actually achieve that okay.\n\n110\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.160\nSo what am I gonna ask you to do\nthen when it comes to this test?\n\n111\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.620\nWell I've got an acronym for\n\n112\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.485\nyou and it's not one I guess I'm supposed\nto give you but I'm gonna give you anyway.\n\n113\n00:06:45.485 --> 00:06:53.150\nR-T-F-Q, R-T-F-Q, Ron,\ndid you have any idea what that means?\n\n114\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.820\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't.\n\n115\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.503\n&gt;&gt; Good [LAUGH] at least,\n[LAUGH] it means read\n\n116\n00:06:58.503 --> 00:07:03.738\nthe full question, read the full question,\n\n117\n00:07:03.738 --> 00:07:08.890\nreally, really, really important.\n\n118\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.360\nThere is not one word in that\nquestion that is not relevant.\n\n119\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.940\nEvery single word is completely relevant,\n\n120\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.260\nif you try and skim read, bearing in\nmind that this test is not a race.\n\n121\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.490\nOkay, you're not gonna get any points for\nfinishing in 20 minutes.\n\n122\n00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:31.140\nOkay, you're not gonna get any prizes for\nthat and nobody's gonna recognize you for\n\n123\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.960\nbeing the fastest person ever to finish\nan ITIL test so please don't try it okay.\n\n124\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.750\nIt's not gonna get you anything additional\nover your score, read the full question.\n\n125\n00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.420\nTake the time to read the full question,\n\n126\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.110\nread every single word and that applies to\nthe scenario as well, read the scenario.\n\n127\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.890\nYou're looking for key words, but you're\nalso looking for small words as well.\n\n128\n00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.289\nWords like all, and words like might,\nand could, and should, and must.\n\n129\n00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.680\nPlease, please, please pick out those\nwords, cuz they are incredibly important.\n\n130\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.980\nFirst thing that I want you\nto do is read the question.\n\n131\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.130\nThe question can generally\nbe very very small.\n\n132\n00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.710\nAnd sometimes that question can simply\nturn round and say, so given the scenario,\n\n133\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.240\nwhat do you think is the best answer to\n\n134\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.840\nresolve the issues\nmentioned in the scenario?\n\n135\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.330\nWhen our question tells\nyou absolutely nothing, so\n\n136\n00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.290\nyou have to go then back to the scenario.\n\n137\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.900\nAnd the example you've given\non there is you've been asked\n\n138\n00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:38.450\nby the CEO to identify the the next\nsteps to address the identified issues.\n\n139\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.961\nWell, guess what?\n\n140\n00:08:39.961 --> 00:08:43.283\nIf you've been asked for the next steps,\nand this is why I say read the full\n\n141\n00:08:43.283 --> 00:08:45.871\nquestion, cuz if you've been asked for\nthe next steps.\n\n142\n00:08:45.871 --> 00:08:50.297\nDon't you dare select the answer that\ngoes over everything that you've already\n\n143\n00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:53.173\ncovered cuz they're asking you for\nthe next steps.\n\n144\n00:08:53.173 --> 00:08:55.674\nIt also mentions, and\nit's been highlighted there again,\n\n145\n00:08:55.674 --> 00:08:58.972\nabout addressing the issues mentioned\neither in the question or the scenario.\n\n146\n00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:02.785\nIf you answer those and\naddress the issues, i.e relevant,\n\n147\n00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:08.910\nif it's not relevant then again you're\nnot gonna be onto that five point answer.\n\n148\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:15.352\nSo, read the full question,\nbe very very careful, okay?\n\n149\n00:09:15.352 --> 00:09:18.741\nIt says that as you read\nthe scenario highlight, underline or\n\n150\n00:09:18.741 --> 00:09:20.575\nwrite down the specific issues.\n\n151\n00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:24.601\nWell, you can only do that if you\ngot a paper exam in front of you,\n\n152\n00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:29.320\nyou cannot do that, When you\nare online and doing a virtual test.\n\n153\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.430\nYou will be allowed, in your virtual test,\nto have a piece of blank paper with you.\n\n154\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.210\nWhat I would recommend, and\nI was just thinking if I had one here and\n\n155\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.930\nI don't unfortunately.\n\n156\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:48.130\nWhat I would recommend for you is to\nactually take one piece of blank paper and\n\n157\n00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.770\nfold it into quarters.\n\n158\n00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.560\nBy doing that you've divided up\nthe front page into four sections and\n\n159\n00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.590\nyou've divided up the back\npage into four sections too.\n\n160\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.329\nYou'll be allowed to have piece\nof paper and a pencil with you.\n\n161\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.990\nIn every single quarter,\n\n162\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.540\nI would write down the notes for\neach particular question.\n\n163\n00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.690\nWhat that allows you to do is actually\nkeep your questions separate,\n\n164\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.500\nwhich is a huge start.\n\n165\n00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.110\nIf you just start writing down\nrandom words on a piece of paper,\n\n166\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.180\nyou'll not really know what\nquestion it refers to.\n\n167\n00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.190\nAnd if you have to go back to a question,\nthen you'll really be in trouble.\n\n168\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:29.010\nOkay, so take that piece of paper and\nliterally kind of fold it into four and\n\n169\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.310\nthen as you unfold it,\nyou've now got dividers.\n\n170\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.760\nFour on each side and\nuse one quarter for each question and\n\n171\n00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.470\nwrite down the specific\nwords you want to highlight.\n\n172\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.410\nSo the third bullet point up there\ntalks about sticking to the facts and\n\n173\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.860\nwhat I will say to you is, don't assume.\n\n174\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.280\nPlease don't assume,\nstick to what's in front of you.\n\n175\n00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.200\nRead the full question and\ndon't read in between the lines.\n\n176\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.860\nThere is nothing written there, so\ndon't read in between the lines.\n\n177\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.020\nDon't assume anything.\n\n178\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.570\nIf it's not down in black and white,\nthen it simply doesn't exist.\n\n179\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.370\nNow you've completed your class.\n\n180\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.690\nNow's the time when you follow this\nlink and you download your exam voucher.\n\n181\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.950\nWhat will happen is you will\nbe given this voucher and\n\n182\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:23.020\nyou will also be given an instruction\nbooklet or an instruction email, rather.\n\n183\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.580\nAnd you will be asked to go to\nthe website at peoplecert.org and\n\n184\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.690\nyou will be asked to register as\na client if you haven't already done so.\n\n185\n00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.630\nYou may already have\na candidate log in and\n\n186\n00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.548\nthen you select the option to register for\nan exam.\n\n187\n00:11:38.548 --> 00:11:44.930\nUsing exam voucher,\nlet me repeat that again, okay?\n\n188\n00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:51.814\nYou'll be asked to register for an exam\nusing an examination voucher, okay?\n\n189\n00:11:51.814 --> 00:11:56.290\nAnd then the voucher that you've\nbeen given in your email from\n\n190\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.004\nPassionIT is the voucher\nnumber that you will use.\n\n191\n00:12:00.004 --> 00:12:03.472\nOnce you've input that it's gonna\nask you for an appropriate date and\n\n192\n00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:05.480\ntime to sit your test.\n\n193\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.060\nYou can do it whatever time you like, so\n\n194\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.540\npick something that's appropriate for\nyou, okay?\n\n195\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.000\nSomething that you can work with.\n\n196\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.200\nThere are a few things that I wanna tell\nyou about this online exam as well and\n\n197\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.780\nthe first thing is,\nplease make sure you can't be interrupted.\n\n198\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.570\nYou need to be in a room\nwhere it's only you and\n\n199\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.680\npreferably where the door is closed.\n\n200\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.790\nYou will need to be using a laptop or\na tablet with a camera.\n\n201\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.280\nIf your laptop or your tablet or\nyour desktop does not have camera,\n\n202\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.860\nthen you won't be able to sit your test.\n\n203\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.210\nBecause you will be watched by\na prompter through out your entire test.\n\n204\n00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:52.370\nyou can't use more than one screen,\nyou can only use one screen, and\n\n205\n00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:57.040\nyou can not at any point in time have\nany other devices on your desk either.\n\n206\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.180\nSo nothing that can connect\nto the Internet, okay.\n\n207\n00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.980\nYou will be asked when you register for\nyour test for\n\n208\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.410\nabout an hour before your test is due\nto download some exam guard software.\n\n209\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.100\nWhat that does is that allows\nthe proctor to remotely watch what\n\n210\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.640\nyou are doing on your laptop or\non your PC or on your device and\n\n211\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.430\nmake sure that you're not on\nthe internet Googling the answer.\n\n212\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:27.320\nSo, okay, so we started our exam,\nwe've downloaded all the software.\n\n213\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.250\nAnd by the way, when I mentioned that,\nif you're using a work PC, you better make\n\n214\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.770\nsure you have the permissions in order\nto be able to download that software.\n\n215\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.190\nIf the software's not on your PC, then\nyou won't be able to sit the test, okay.\n\n216\n00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:44.120\nSo then, the proctor will come online and\nthey will ask you if you're all ready, and\n\n217\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.020\nthey'll tell you that you can\nhave a piece of paper and a pen.\n\n218\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.150\nAnd then they will ask to\nsee around your room, so\n\n219\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.540\nyou must be in a position where you\ncan physically pick up your laptop and\n\n220\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.700\nturn it around so\nthat the proctor can view the room.\n\n221\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.980\nThat's to make sure that you don't\nhave any ITIL books with you.\n\n222\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.870\nThat you don't have anybody\nlike me hiding in a corner or\n\n223\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.170\nhiding under your desk helping you out.\n\n224\n00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.460\nThen it's also to make sure that\nyou are completely alone and\n\n225\n00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.260\ncan't be interrupted during\nthat particular test.\n\n226\n00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.120\nAt that point in time,\n\n227\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.940\nthe examiner will ask you to start\nyour test, you'll get 90 minutes.\n\n228\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.470\nand to be perfectly honest, 90 minutes or\nan hour and a half is pretty comfortable.\n\n229\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.890\nAt the end of your test,\none thing I will tell you,\n\n230\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.160\nplease don't change your answers.\n\n231\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.780\nGo with your gut instinct,\nit's generally right.\n\n232\n00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.160\nAnd to be perfectly honest\nit's about 75% of cases,\n\n233\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.930\nthe person that changes their answer\nchanges it to the wrong one, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:44.700\nYou wanna aim for\n\n235\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.470\nabout 10 minutes per question the average\nis 11 minutes per question but aim for\n\n236\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.160\n10 and then you'll feel completely\ncomfortable with the timings.\n\n237\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:59.727\nAt the end of your test, you will be\nasked to submit and when you're finished,\n\n238\n00:14:59.727 --> 00:15:05.714\nthen you click submit at that point\nin time your screen will disappear.\n\n239\n00:15:05.714 --> 00:15:07.604\nYou will be given an intermediate,\n\n240\n00:15:07.604 --> 00:15:12.331\nI don't like to use that word actually\nwhen we're talking about intermediate.\n\n241\n00:15:12.331 --> 00:15:14.946\nYou'll be given an interim\nresult there and then and\n\n242\n00:15:14.946 --> 00:15:17.010\nthat interim result will tell you.\n\n243\n00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.910\nVery simply,\nwhether you've passed or failed.\n\n244\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.740\nYou're not gonna to be able to get\nanything more than that out of it, okay.\n\n245\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.150\nThat's all you're going to get, is just\na pass or fail, because it has to be\n\n246\n00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:29.420\nindependently audited before they\ncan release the result to you, okay.\n\n247\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.340\nSo you'll get your intern\nresult immediately, and\n\n248\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.040\nthen you'll get your real result\nwith your school within a week.\n\n249\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.450\nI wanna just draw your attention\nto that bottom bullet point there,\n\n250\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.620\njust before we move on.\n\n251\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.260\nIf you're struggling with a question,\nmove on, come back to it.\n\n252\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.320\nAnd just remember that if you don't answer\na question because you think it's too\n\n253\n00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.110\ndifficult, then you're\ngonna get zero points.\n\n254\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.020\nYou've got a 25% chance of\ngetting a five pointer and\n\n255\n00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:01.570\nyou've got a 50% chance of either getting\nfive or three, so please answer it.\n\n256\n00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.180\nOkay, don't just leave it blank.\n\n257\n00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.860\nAlways answer a question.\n\n258\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:11.370\nRight, I think I've probably given\nyou enough exam tips for now.\n\n259\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.180\nNow it's your turn.\n\n260\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.160\nWhat I want you to do now\nis I want you to go and\n\n261\n00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.320\nI want you download sample paper one.\n\n262\n00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.080\nAnd then I want you to do sample paper\none, including the scenario booklet and\n\n263\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.600\nthe question booklet,\nI want you to do that now.\n\n264\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.620\nAnd then we're gonna come back and we're\ngonna go through that question booklet.\n\n265\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.790\nNow you'll notice that with this\nparticular booklet with sample paper one\n\n266\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.650\nyou've got answers and\nyou've got rationale.\n\n267\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.190\nIn other words that's the reasons why.\n\n268\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.330\nThat's the five pointer, the reason why\nthis one is the three pointer, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.530\nBut, for the moment, what I want us to do,\n\n270\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.660\nis I want us to come back,\nwhen you finish that exam.\n\n271\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.660\nI want us to come back and\nI want us to go through that test, okay?\n\n272\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.830\nAnd then, you'll see how you did and don't\nforget, we've got the forum available\n\n273\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:07.180\nto us and now, more than anything else, is\nwhen you really

We look at the operational aspects to designing an IT service, such as Service Level Management, managing suppliers, and planning for service availability and resilience. All of our planning cumulates into a Design Package which we then handover to the Service Transition lifecycle phase. Like all ITIL shows we also look at critical success factors and key performance indicators and we do some exam prep too!

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.253\n[SOUND] Hi, I'm Jo Peacock with ITProTV.\n\n2\n00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:11.038\nAnd by now, you have hopefully\ncompleted your sample paper\n\n3\n00:00:11.038 --> 00:00:15.353\none from your service design for\nITIL Intermediate.\n\n4\n00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:17.546\nCongratulations, how did you do?\n\n5\n00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:19.550\nWell, let's check.\n\n6\n00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.480\nLet's go straight into\nthen sample paper one, and\n\n7\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.860\nwe're going to go through in this\nparticular session, questions one to four.\n\n8\n00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.290\nAnd then in our net episode,\nwe'll go through questions five to eight.\n\n9\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.050\nSo let's take a look at how you did, and\n\n10\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.560\nlet's see if we can have\nsome clarification on here.\n\n11\n00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.360\nSo as per usual with ever single question,\nI'm going to ask you to check\n\n12\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.740\nto make sure that you're\nreferring to the right scenario.\n\n13\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.550\nAnd here we are in question number 1,\nwe're referring to sample paper, sorry,\n\n14\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.500\nto scenario one.\n\n15\n00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.980\nAnd you have been given responsibility for\nserving the capacity, solving even,\n\n16\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.570\nthe capacity issues,\nimproving the management of capacity.\n\n17\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.700\nWhich of these is the best way to achieve?\n\n18\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.750\nSo you have been given\nthe role of capacity\n\n19\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.950\nmanager in this particular question.\n\n20\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.464\nVery, very important to pick out\nexactly what role you've been given.\n\n21\n00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:14.610\nAnd then the next important\nthing is to try and\n\n22\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.120\nunderstand the scale of the company.\n\n23\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.470\nSo it's an internet shopping company,\nand it was set up two years ago and\n\n24\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.120\nit's been very successful.\n\n25\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.320\nMuch of its success can be attributed to\nmarketing campaigns with special offers.\n\n26\n00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.140\nOkay, so it's an internet company.\n\n27\n00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.510\nSo it could be global or it could just be\nlocated in one particular geographical\n\n28\n00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.580\narea, it doesn't actually state but it\ndoes say that it's been very successful.\n\n29\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.840\nIt develops its own website application so\n\n30\n00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.290\nit has its own development team,\nused by shoppers for\n\n31\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.420\nbrowsing and ordering products,\nthe website's hosted by a well-known ISP,\n\n32\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.970\nWho provides the infrastructure\nthat supports live operations.\n\n33\n00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.570\nThe applications are developed and tested\non the company's own infrastructure.\n\n34\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.360\nSo they're developed and\ntested there as well as, obviously,\n\n35\n00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.220\ntheir live on their\ninfrastructure as well.\n\n36\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.040\nChanges and\nupgrades are sent to the ISP one.\n\n37\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.340\nRelationships with the ISP are generally\ngood, but there's been occasions when\n\n38\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.180\nthe ISP has charged high prices for\nlast minute increases in capacity.\n\n39\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.230\nDidn't we talk about this when we\ntalk about capacity management?\n\n40\n00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.380\nAnything that is not planned is\ngenerally going to cost you more.\n\n41\n00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.730\nSome shoppers have reported unexpected\nerrors when using the website which\n\n42\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.910\nhas resulted in lost or duplicate orders.\n\n43\n00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.470\nIt's not known how often\nthis has happened, and\n\n44\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.410\nas not all customers report their errors.\n\n45\n00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.420\nAlso, when they launch new products,\n\n46\n00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.190\nthey've complained of slow\nresponse times from the website.\n\n47\n00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.642\nOver the last six months,\n\n48\n00:02:45.642 --> 00:02:49.935\nthe company has introduced an initiative\nto implement service management.\n\n49\n00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:51.520\nThat's ITIL to you and me.\n\n50\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.003\nThe main purpose is to streamline\noperations and reduce costs.\n\n51\n00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:59.185\nOkay, so they're implementing ITIL.\n\n52\n00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:03.444\nThey've got problems with capacity, and it\nlooks like problems with the relationship\n\n53\n00:03:03.444 --> 00:03:05.063\nwith that particular supplier.\n\n54\n00:03:05.063 --> 00:03:09.950\nBut, primarily, is because we are not\nplanning capacity effectively enough.\n\n55\n00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.680\nSo you've been given a responsibility for\nsolving this capacity issues, and\n\n56\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.520\nimproving capacity management,\nwhat are we going to do?\n\n57\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.723\nWell, the answer here to this\nparticular question is B.\n\n58\n00:03:24.653 --> 00:03:28.573\nTake a look at B, establishing links\nwith the marketing department in order\n\n59\n00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:31.145\nto get adequate warning\nof product launches, and\n\n60\n00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:34.530\ncampaigns that may increase\ncustomer use of the website.\n\n61\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.320\nThis is what we call demand management.\n\n62\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.520\nNow we looked at demand management\nin service strategy, but\n\n63\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.830\ndemand management will predict and will\ndocument patterns of business activity.\n\n64\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.640\nSo this is going back to the business.\n\n65\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.300\nKeep in a very close relationship,\n\n66\n00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.190\nmaybe using BRM to predict\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n67\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.780\nAs I said, last minute purchases of\nanything is always gonna be more\n\n68\n00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.980\nexpensive.\n\n69\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.950\nThen what would the ISP to ensure\nthat change is an updates to the web\n\n70\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.200\napplications are tested in\nmodels on their infrastructure\n\n71\n00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.230\nas well as on the company's\ninfrastructure.\n\n72\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.870\nYou know when you say it out loud,\nit kinda sounds like a no brainer,\n\n73\n00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.960\ndoesn't it?\n\n74\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.758\nWell, that's fairly obvious, really.\n\n75\n00:04:15.758 --> 00:04:20.210\nYou're gonna test it in every single\nscenario, you don't just test it in one.\n\n76\n00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.907\nThen agree with the ISP to introduce\nmonitoring against pre-determined\n\n77\n00:04:24.907 --> 00:04:28.997\nthreshold that will give advanced\nwarning of capacity issues,\n\n78\n00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:32.350\nallow an action to be\ntaken to avoid incidents.\n\n79\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.540\nOkay, that's proactive, perfect.\n\n80\n00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.108\nAnd then introduce a plan so\n\n81\n00:04:37.108 --> 00:04:40.906\nthat longer term capacity changes\nbased upon growth prediction,\n\n82\n00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:45.135\ncuz we're working with the marketing team,\ncan be planned and founded.\n\n83\n00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:47.818\nIt all makes perfect sense, doesn't it?\n\n84\n00:04:47.818 --> 00:04:50.820\nAll right, well,\nlet's take a look and see, and\n\n85\n00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.640\nsee why C is not our five pointer then.\n\n86\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.510\nC is our three pointer.\n\n87\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.970\nEstablishing improved links with\nthe marketing department in order to get\n\n88\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.520\nadequate warning of product launches and\n\n89\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.150\ncampaigns that may increase\ncustomer use of the website.\n\n90\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.990\nOkay, I'm happy with that one.\n\n91\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.930\nWe already know that,\nthat's in the five pointer.\n\n92\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.930\nImprove the testing of changes and\nupdates to the website application, and\n\n93\n00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.669\nensure that modeling is included\nin the testing programs.\n\n94\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.867\nDid it say we had a problem with testing?\n\n95\n00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:23.360\nI don't think it said we\nhad a problem with testing.\n\n96\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.590\nWhat it said was that testing\nis only on our website.\n\n97\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.230\nTesting is only on now our infrastructure.\n\n98\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.620\nSo improving the testing is still\ngoing to keep it restricted.\n\n99\n00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.440\nWe need to expand the testing,\nnot improve the testing.\n\n100\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.910\nWatch out for those little words.\n\n101\n00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.010\nThose little words can make a huge,\nbig difference.\n\n102\n00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.450\nPerform usage growth predictions based\non monitoring data to enable accurate\n\n103\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.350\npredictions of future demand to be made\nand necessary resources to be provided.\n\n104\n00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.410\nThat's okay as long as\nwe've got monitoring data.\n\n105\n00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.410\nThere's an assumption, though,\nthat we've got monitoring data.\n\n106\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.930\nFirst of all, we've gotta decide\nwhat we're going to monitor, surely.\n\n107\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.279\nBe careful of assumptions.\n\n108\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.610\nThe other thing that I wanna warn you\nabout is also be careful of if I've read\n\n109\n00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.870\na previous answer, then the next\nanswer does not build on that answer.\n\n110\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.780\nSo just because it says in B that we're\ngoing to introduce monetary thresholds\n\n111\n00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.000\ndoesn't mean that,\n\n112\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.799\nthat still applies to C because it doesn't\ntreat each of these answers in isolation.\n\n113\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.040\nI'm okay with it, as long as we've\ngot the monitoring data, and\n\n114\n00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.190\nit doesn't say that we have.\n\n115\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.707\nEstablish interfaces between\ncapacity management and\n\n116\n00:06:35.707 --> 00:06:38.887\nchange management of both the company and\nthe ISP.\n\n117\n00:06:38.887 --> 00:06:41.671\nThere's nothing wrong with\nthat particular statement, but\n\n118\n00:06:41.671 --> 00:06:43.230\nit doesn't answer the question.\n\n119\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.620\nIt's not relevant to\nthe actual question itself.\n\n120\n00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.513\nBut we need to go back to the question, go\nback to the scenario when we need to look\n\n121\n00:06:51.513 --> 00:06:55.693\nat the relationship between the testing\nof the company and the ISP.\n\n122\n00:06:55.693 --> 00:07:00.289\nAnd, in fact, the ISP was still treating\nus as separate entity even though they\n\n123\n00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.050\nare a partner of ours.\n\n124\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.700\nSo we need to expand testing\nto include the ISP, and\n\n125\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.850\nwe need to expand predictions\nto include the ISP.\n\n126\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.980\nIt's not just about\nestablishing interfaces,\n\n127\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.040\nit's about actually getting\nthem involved completely.\n\n128\n00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.530\nSo what about our one pointer then?\n\n129\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.560\nAnd our one pointer is D.\n\n130\n00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.830\nSo D says introduce business capacity\nmanagement to identify business changes\n\n131\n00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.440\nthat might alter demand for\nwebsite applications.\n\n132\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.680\nI'm okay with that,\nI really am okay with that.\n\n133\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.690\nAlthough, I much prefer\nthe targeted improved links with\n\n134\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.760\nthe marketing department.\n\n135\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.085\nThat first bullet point in D seems\na little bit, how do we say this?\n\n136\n00:07:39.085 --> 00:07:39.880\nAmbiguous.\n\n137\n00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.814\nSo let's look at this\nsecond bullet point then.\n\n138\n00:07:42.814 --> 00:07:47.485\nIntroduce applications sizing so\nthat accurate predictions of the resources\n\n139\n00:07:47.485 --> 00:07:51.670\nrequired to support the applications\ncan be predicted and provided.\n\n140\n00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.675\nThere's an assumption there,\nwatch out for that assumption.\n\n141\n00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:59.192\nThe assumption is that it's\nthe application that's at fault.\n\n142\n00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:00.533\nWe don't know that.\n\n143\n00:08:00.533 --> 00:08:04.804\nWe know that there have been some\nsort of capacity issues with\n\n144\n00:08:04.804 --> 00:08:09.190\nthe actual Internet itself or\nwith the ISP, we know that.\n\n145\n00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.740\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat it's actually the fault of\n\n146\n00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.810\nthe application.\n\n147\n00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.600\nIt could be that we just simply don't\nhave enough bandwidth on the Internet.\n\n148\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.490\nThat's an assumption, and\nthat's a huge, big assumption to make.\n\n149\n00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.310\nWhen there hasn't been any statement\nin the scenario to say that it is\n\n150\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.370\nthe application.\n\n151\n00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.670\nSo watch out for that,\ndon't make assumptions.\n\n152\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.750\nIntroduce the modelling techniques\nto ensure that the performance\n\n153\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.310\nof the applications are tested\nunder various workloads scenarios.\n\n154\n00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.060\nThat's okay, but again,\nwe're looking at the applications.\n\n155\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.932\nI don't see any mention of the Internet.\n\n156\n00:08:44.932 --> 00:08:48.320\nI don't see any mention\nof our network at all.\n\n157\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.210\nAnd then write a capacity plan\nto support the annual budget.\n\n158\n00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:58.540\nOkay, you're assuming we need to spend\nmore money and we need to bring in more\n\n159\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.360\nresources, and ensure that adequate funds\nare available to buy additional capacity.\n\n160\n00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.107\nBut we know that if we plan for\ncapacity it won't cost us as much.\n\n161\n00:09:09.107 --> 00:09:13.254\nJust making sure we've got enough\nmoney to be able to cope with last\n\n162\n00:09:13.254 --> 00:09:16.680\nminute demands is not\nactually predicting anything.\n\n163\n00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.170\nIt's not actually planning ahead, and\n\n164\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.090\nit's certainly not going to be\nefficient use of our money.\n\n165\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.830\nSo it's not just a case of making\nsure we've got enough money.\n\n166\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.260\nWe should really be planning and\npreparing for this better in the future.\n\n167\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.120\nSo then let's take a quick\nlook at our distractor then.\n\n168\n00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.558\nSo our distractor talks about\nmodifying the contract with the ISP.\n\n169\n00:09:36.558 --> 00:09:41.243\nSo that they're required to seek approval\nfor any increase in capacity prior\n\n170\n00:09:41.243 --> 00:09:45.380\nto implementation in order to\nreduce the number of panic updates.\n\n171\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.190\nOkay, then, so let's put a huge,\n\n172\n00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:53.470\nbig roadblock into the way that our\ncustomers buy things, should we?\n\n173\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.880\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n174\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.140\nSo we're saying at the time of urgency,\nwhen everything is getting a little\n\n175\n00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:05.330\nbit frantic and we don't have enough\ncapacity, let's just kind of what?\n\n176\n00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.040\nLeave it as it is until we can agree\nthe terms and conditions of a contract?\n\n177\n00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.480\nI don't think so.\n\n178\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.820\nSurely that's going to make things worse?\n\n179\n00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.220\nThat's not gonna make things any better.\n\n180\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.950\nImplement capacity thresholds and\n\n181\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.130\nautomatic alerts to warn\ncustomers when systems are slow.\n\n182\n00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.280\nThere's nothing like a little bit of\nnegative marketing really, is there, yeah?\n\n183\n00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.760\nSorry, we've got problems.\n\n184\n00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.350\nLet's look at this from\na realistic standpoint here.\n\n185\n00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.890\nIf you go onto a website,\nif I go onto a website and\n\n186\n00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.860\nit tells me that they're experiencing\nproblems, you know what I'm gonna do?\n\n187\n00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.770\nI'm gonna go somewhere else.\n\n188\n00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.300\nThat's what's going to happen.\n\n189\n00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.920\nSo yeah,\nthat one's not going to help at all.\n\n190\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.870\nImprove change management processes\nof the company and the ISP.\n\n191\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.290\nYou cannot improve\na process of a third party.\n\n192\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.160\nThat's up to them.\n\n193\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.380\nYou can make recommendations but\nyou can't do that.\n\n194\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.766\nSo I'm really,\nreally not convinced about that at all.\n\n195\n00:11:02.798 --> 00:11:07.871\nThen agree with the ISP that they\nwill set up a project to review\n\n196\n00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:12.761\ntheir capacity management processes and\nalign with them.\n\n197\n00:11:12.761 --> 00:11:17.170\nHm, they're gonna set up and they're\ngonna review their capacity management\n\n198\n00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.802\nprocesses, but\nsurely it's us predicting and\n\n199\n00:11:19.802 --> 00:11:24.040\nit's us telling them what we want\nthat's actually really what's needed.\n\n200\n00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.740\nIt's not really down to them, is it?\n\n201\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:32.450\nYeah, I can see now why A is definitely,\ndefinitely your distractor.\n\n202\n00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:37.650\nOkay, so let's take a look now\nthen at question number two,\n\n203\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.690\nand question number two\nlooks at a RACI matrix.\n\n204\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:46.270\nWhich of the following options is the most\nappropriate RACI chart for allocating\n\n205\n00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:51.690\nthe new service design activities across\nexisting roles within the IT unit?\n\n206\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.480\nAnd here we have,okay, we've got\nresponsible, accountable, consulted and\n\n207\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.120\ninformed.\n\n208\n00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.990\nAnd we've got all of these,\nthat's not a very good depiction,\n\n209\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.390\nI just want to say that.\n\n210\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.340\nWe know that RACI stands for\nresponsible, accountable,\n\n211\n00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.144\nconsulted and informed, and here we\nhave just a label there in front of us.\n\n212\n00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:15.020\nWe've labeled ACCM, that's an abbreviation\nfor account managers, etc.\n\n213\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.440\nSo let's take a look then at question\nnumber two and scenario number two.\n\n214\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.560\nWe're the IT unit of a very\nsmall retail company.\n\n215\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.820\nWe've been implementing service\nmanagement for a number of year, and\n\n216\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.670\nwe've got several mature processes\nin place with responsible managers.\n\n217\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.873\nIn addition, there are account managers\nworking within IT who are responsible for\n\n218\n00:12:36.873 --> 00:12:38.864\ninterfacing with the business units.\n\n219\n00:12:38.864 --> 00:12:44.298\nThe IT unit's about to migrate its service\nmanagement activities towards a lifecycle\n\n220\n00:12:44.298 --> 00:12:49.511\nfocus, which means that we have strategy,\nwe have design, we have transition and\n\n221\n00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:54.150\nwe have service operation and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n222\n00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.430\nBut before they do that they need\nto allocate responsibility for\n\n223\n00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.160\nthe new services.\n\n224\n00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.810\nThis is where we look at the skills\nof these relevant people.\n\n225\n00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.000\nOur account managers were\nbusiness analysts, so\n\n226\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.310\nthey've got knowledge of the business,\nparticularly within their own areas,\n\n227\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.940\nand they've got an appreciation for\nservices and applications.\n\n228\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.750\nBut they've got a little knowledge\nof IT infrastructure, and\n\n229\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.150\nthey've got great communication and\nrelationship skills.\n\n230\n00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:28.070\nService level manager, he was\npreviously the service desk manager.\n\n231\n00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.170\nBut he's become qualified in\nservice level management, and\n\n232\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.040\nnow reviews all SLAs and\nperformance with the customers.\n\n233\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.700\nHe's got good communication and\nrelationship skills, but\n\n234\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.010\nagain, he's got a little knowledge\nof the IT infrastructure.\n\n235\n00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.900\nThe capacity manager was\nthe network support team leader,\n\n236\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.470\nso is very technically minded and\nhe's got knowledge of the infrastructure.\n\n237\n00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:52.560\nThe availability manager, well,\nthey worked in service support,\n\n238\n00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.810\nso is very knowledge about service.\n\n239\n00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:58.575\nService continuity manager,\nworked in operations, so\n\n240\n00:13:58.575 --> 00:14:02.040\nunderstands risk management and\ncontinuity techniques, and\n\n241\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.720\nhas got a reasonable knowledge of\ninfrastructure and recovery techniques.\n\n242\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.990\nThen we've got the security manager\nwho also worked in operations and\n\n243\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.830\nis also trained in risk and\nsecurity techniques.\n\n244\n00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:17.030\nAnd then we've got the financial manager,\nwho's actually an accountant from finance\n\n245\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.470\nbut who specializes in purchasing and\nIT finance.\n\n246\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.390\nExcellent, okay, so\nwho's going to fit into what role?\n\n247\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.440\nWell, our five pointer here for\n\n248\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.830\nnumber two is actually\nB is our five pointer.\n\n249\n00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.770\nAnd our five pointer is, well,\nif we look at the activities here, and\n\n250\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.390\nthe requirements and\nthe analysis definition.\n\n251\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.240\nWell, let's just go back here.\n\n252\n00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.340\nRequirements and analysis for\nour account managers.\n\n253\n00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.700\nWell, they're not particularly technical,\nbut\n\n254\n00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.580\nthey do have good communication and\ngood knowledge of the organization.\n\n255\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.640\nSo of course within B,\n\n256\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.810\nwe're gonna give them the accountability\nfor requirements and analysis.\n\n257\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.550\nAnd of course, service level management\nare good at communication, so\n\n258\n00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.640\nwe're going to give them a responsibility.\n\n259\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.100\nAnd availability management\nknow about service, and\n\n260\n00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:19.300\nthey know about what is possible, so\nwe're going to give them a responsibility.\n\n261\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:25.610\nAnd the same with our information security\nmanager because he's been trained in risk.\n\n262\n00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.420\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\n263\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.520\nSo then let's look at production\nof the service design itself.\n\n264\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:36.077\nWell the production of the service design,\nwe're gonna give the accountability\n\n265\n00:15:36.077 --> 00:15:40.844\nto service-level management because\nthey work at a tactical level.\n\n266\n00:15:40.844 --> 00:15:45.177\nThe account manager seems to undertake a\nbusiness relationship role, so therefore,\n\n267\n00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:47.390\nhe's gonna be at a strategic level.\n\n268\n00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.209\nWhereas the service design, well,\n\n269\n00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:53.154\nwe'll give that to service level manager\nbecause that's at a tactical level.\n\n270\n00:15:53.154 --> 00:15:57.789\nWith a responsibility for\nthe capacity manager because You'll\n\n271\n00:15:57.789 --> 00:16:02.076\nnotice that the capacity manager,\nas it says here, well,\n\n272\n00:16:02.076 --> 00:16:08.630\nhe's technically minded and he's got\na good knowledge of networks and service.\n\n273\n00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.680\nAll right, that makes sense.\n\n274\n00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.569\nDefinition of the service\nacceptance criteria?\n\n275\n00:16:13.569 --> 00:16:16.110\nWell, that goes back to requirements and\nanalysis.\n\n276\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:20.660\nAnd so therefore that needs to be within\nthe account manager because he has that\n\n277\n00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.030\nrelationship with the business and\nthe understanding of the business.\n\n278\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.014\nBut to the responsibility with\nservice level management,\n\n279\n00:16:27.014 --> 00:16:30.370\nbecause we have to agree\nwith that the customer.\n\n280\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:35.140\nAnd then definition of the SDP,\nof the actual document itself.\n\n281\n00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.880\nAgain, it's at a tactical level, so\nwe give that to the service level manager,\n\n282\n00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.390\nbut of course, we've go to have\navailability plans, capacity plans,\n\n283\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.340\nservice continuity plans, security plans.\n\n284\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.680\nThey all need to form part of that SDP,\nso of course,\n\n285\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.560\neverybody is gonna be\ngiven that responsibility.\n\n286\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.789\nAnd then reviewing the final service\nacceptance criteria and the SDP.\n\n287\n00:16:57.789 --> 00:17:02.469\nWell, everybody needs to be involved in\nthat, including consulting with financial\n\n288\n00:17:02.469 --> 00:17:06.980\nmanagement because they'll tell us\nhow much money we've got to spend.\n\n289\n00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.050\nAnd we need to go back to\nthe account manager and\n\n290\n00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.720\nmake sure that they're involved as well.\n\n291\n00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:16.650\nNow as far as this particular\nquestion is concerned,\n\n292\n00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.900\nI'm not going to go any further into\nthe one pointer, into the three pointer,\n\n293\n00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.980\ninto the one pointer and the zero.\n\n294\n00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.390\nOne thing that I would check, okay.\n\n295\n00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.570\nAlways check with any RACI that you\nhaven't got two accountabilities in\n\n296\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:31.670\none row.\n\n297\n00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.330\nSo look at A, for instance.\n\n298\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.090\nIn A, we've got two accountabilities there\n\n299\n00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.700\nunder the definition of\nthe service design package.\n\n300\n00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.230\nThat's wrong,\nquite clearly that is wrong, okay?\n\n301\n00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.280\nIf you've got two accountabilities,\nwell, yeah, that’s not going to\n\n302\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.630\nbe the right way to go, because we know\nthat only one person can be accountable.\n\n303\n00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.330\nThat’s the first thing\nthat you need to check.\n\n304\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:02.790\nAnd then the next thing that you need to\ndo is just simply go back to your roles,\n\n305\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.210\ngo back to your responsibilities,\ngo back to your skills and\n\n306\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:12.070\nwork out who will do what function best.\n\n307\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:16.870\nAnd just remember, what you have to do\nis bring into this particular question\n\n308\n00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.850\nyour understanding of\nthe service design package,\n\n309\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.360\nyour understanding of the definition\nof a service acceptance criteria and\n\n310\n00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.380\nwho actually performs each role.\n\n311\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:34.690\nSuch as defining the actual design itself\nof a service, the functional design okay.\n\n312\n00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.370\nThere is no right or wrong answer\nwithin your organization, but there's\n\n313\n00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.950\na definitely a right or wrong answer\nhere within this particular question.\n\n314\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:50.380\nSo be there is your five pointer because\nwe do have all of the right roles and\n\n315\n00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.370\nall of the right skills given to\nthe right place in the RACI matrix.\n\n316\n00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.460\nLet's take a look at\nquestion number three then.\n\n317\n00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.560\nQuestion number three, you are the service\ndesign manager in a company,\n\n318\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.344\nand it's an internal unit of a major\nmanufacturing company, okay?\n\n319\n00:19:09.344 --> 00:19:14.163\nAnd the head of IT has asked you to\ninvestigate the situation as a design\n\n320\n00:19:14.163 --> 00:19:19.150\nissue and quickly give a recommendation\nof the best way forward.\n\n321\n00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.180\nWhich of these is the best\napproach to adopt?\n\n322\n00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:27.240\nSo it's an internal unit of\na major manufacturing company, and\n\n323\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.190\nit's been implementing processes for\nthree years.\n\n324\n00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.190\nWe've now started to improve service\nmanagement activities in order to get\n\n325\n00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.790\nmore buy in from the business and\nmore business alignment.\n\n326\n00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.630\nSo that says CSI and\nservice strategy to me.\n\n327\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.298\nUntil now the business has been\nreluctant to get involved,\n\n328\n00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:45.620\nseeing them as an IT responsibility.\n\n329\n00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.180\nYeah, this is quite common,\neven to the extent of to expecting IT\n\n330\n00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.060\nto develop a business security policy and\nbusiness continuity plans.\n\n331\n00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.340\nYou wouldn't believe how common this is.\n\n332\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.246\nThe service desk finds it hard to\nprioritize incidents since the business\n\n333\n00:19:59.246 --> 00:20:01.960\nprioritizations are not properly defined.\n\n334\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.010\nThere are business relationship\nmanagers working with the IT unit\n\n335\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.420\nwho provide interfaces to\nthe various lines of business.\n\n336\n00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.597\nPart of the alignment activity,\n\n337\n00:20:11.597 --> 00:20:15.806\nsatisfaction surveys being\nconducted by the BRMs and SLM team.\n\n338\n00:20:15.806 --> 00:20:20.137\nAnd the feedback from the survey indicates\nthe customers are dissatisfied with\n\n339\n00:20:20.137 --> 00:20:24.740\nthe level of availability of IT services,\nand the resulting business disruption.\n\n340\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.550\nOkay, this is the first\ntime that's been mentioned.\n\n341\n00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.660\nIn order to investigate the complaints,\nthe service level manager and\n\n342\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.150\nthe availability manager have\nanalyzed service availability and\n\n343\n00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:39.510\nfound that there's been only two breaches\nof service level availability targets over\n\n344\n00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.110\nthe last six months.\n\n345\n00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.860\nThat sounds to me like we've got an issue\nhere with business relationship management\n\n346\n00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.370\nand with understanding the requirements\nthat the business actually have.\n\n347\n00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.820\nSo which of these then is the best\noption here in question number three?\n\n348\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.450\nYou're the service design manager,\nand the head of\n\n349\n00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.540\nIT has asked you to investigate\nthe situation as a design issue.\n\n350\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.840\nAnd to quickly give recommendation\nas the best way forward,\n\n351\n00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.830\nwhich of these is the best?\n\n352\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:07.520\nWell, as I've said,\n\n353\n00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.240\nit sounds to me like we've got an issue\nwith our business relationship managers\n\n354\n00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.710\nand with understanding what\nthe organization actually require.\n\n355\n00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.450\nSo let's look at my five pointer\nhere then, and my five pointer is B.\n\n356\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:26.490\nAnalyzing the situation with the BRMs,\nSLM and availability management teams.\n\n357\n00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.610\nExactly, get all of our\nstakeholders involved.\n\n358\n00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.690\nSo far in this scenario,\n\n359\n00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.000\nyou've only talked to\nthe availability manager and the SLM.\n\n360\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.360\nThe BRM has been involved in\ncustomer satisfaction, but\n\n361\n00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.980\nthey need to be involved in\ndefining parameters as well.\n\n362\n00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:48.252\nProduce a report which summarizes how\nthe existing SLAs and targets are invalid.\n\n363\n00:21:48.252 --> 00:21:50.804\nRight, and I always tell you, and\n\n364\n00:21:50.804 --> 00:21:56.265\nI've told you this when we looked at\nthe service level management shows.\n\n365\n00:21:56.265 --> 00:21:59.762\nWhen we looked at those particular\nepisodes, I said to you, I never,\n\n366\n00:21:59.762 --> 00:22:05.100\never wanna see a green slam chart, because\ngreen slam chart doesn't tell me anything.\n\n367\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.250\nIt tells me that you're achieving\nwhat you want to achieve, but\n\n368\n00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.710\nI'm pretty certain that if I go and\nask any customer how they're feeling.\n\n369\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.810\nI'm pretty certain they're going\nto say that they're dissatisfied.\n\n370\n00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.490\nI always want to see areas for\nimprovement, so\n\n371\n00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.940\nit sounds to me like in this particular\ninstance, we're measuring the wrong thing.\n\n372\n00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:23.880\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n373\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.520\nWe've got different targets, certainly\ndifferent customer perception, and\n\n374\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.470\nremember about value, value is perceived.\n\n375\n00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.540\nSo going on, agree on a set of\nimprovement actions with the BRMs,\n\n376\n00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.939\nand the service level management and\navailability management.\n\n377\n00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.921\nAnd then produce an executive summary for\nsenior IT management and customers,\n\n378\n00:22:45.921 --> 00:22:50.960\nrequesting funding for the implementation\nof identified improvement actions.\n\n379\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.680\nThat seems to me, and remember\nthe question's always going to ask you for\n\n380\n00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.550\nthe best fit answer.\n\n381\n00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.643\nIt's never going to ask you for\nsomething that's 100% correct.\n\n382\n00:23:01.643 --> 00:23:03.870\nIt's going to ask you for the best fit.\n\n383\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.770\nThat to me seems to be an assumption.\n\n384\n00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.820\nThat we're going to request\nheightened availability, and\n\n385\n00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.420\nthat therefore that's\ngoing to need more money.\n\n386\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.840\nThere is an assumption, and\n\n387\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.880\nthe assumption is that heightened\navailability is going to cost more money.\n\n388\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.620\nAnd it might not but it probably will.\n\n389\n00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.140\nThere's also an assumption there\nthat we need more availability.\n\n390\n00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.300\nIt's true to say that perception\nis what defines value.\n\n391\n00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.240\nAnd therefore,\n\n392\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.770\nif the customers don't perceive that\neverything is available enough,\n\n393\n00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.850\nwhich is what it said in the case study,\nthen chances are that it's probably not.\n\n394\n00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:41.190\nAnd if we are redefining the availability\ntargets, then we're probably gonna make\n\n395\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:47.350\nthem tighter, and that is probably going\nto results in us requiring more money.\n\n396\n00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.954\nYes, it's an assumption, but\nto be perfectly honest, it's a completely\n\n397\n00:23:50.954 --> 00:23:54.406\nlogical assumption, and it's a very,\nvery small assumption to make.\n\n398\n00:23:54.406 --> 00:24:00.101\nBecause naturally, if you want more of\nsomething, it's going to cost you more.\n\n399\n00:24:00.101 --> 00:24:03.250\nI am never happy with assumptions\nwhen it comes to tests.\n\n400\n00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.940\nAnd I will always tell you to\nstay away from assumptions.\n\n401\n00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.560\nBut nevertheless,\nthis one is a fairly logical assumption.\n\n402\n00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.190\nAnd we're asking you for\nthe best approach.\n\n403\n00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.609\nSo in this case, B is the best approach.\n\n404\n00:24:14.609 --> 00:24:17.030\nSo let's take a look at\nour three pointer then.\n\n405\n00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:22.825\nSo our three pointer is C, discussing\nthe results of the analysis with the BRM,\n\n406\n00:24:22.825 --> 00:24:25.690\nSLM, and customer representatives.\n\n407\n00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:32.020\nOkay, B's a little bit better\nbecause B goes back and reanalyzes.\n\n408\n00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.849\nIt says analyze the situation.\n\n409\n00:24:33.849 --> 00:24:37.228\nWhereas, C assumes that there's\nalready been a comprehensive analysis.\n\n410\n00:24:37.228 --> 00:24:39.331\nAnd so, yeah, I prefer B.\n\n411\n00:24:39.331 --> 00:24:43.550\nI much prefer B, because it talks\nabout analyzing the situation.\n\n412\n00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:48.469\nProduce a report, summarizing the\nfindings, and then circulate it to IT and\n\n413\n00:24:48.469 --> 00:24:50.601\nthe customer representatives.\n\n414\n00:24:50.601 --> 00:24:54.380\nThat's okay, but\nare we circulating it to our sponsors?\n\n415\n00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.817\nIt's our senior management that really\nwant to be aware of how our customers and\n\n416\n00:24:59.817 --> 00:25:03.960\nhow our organization are feeling,\nbecause you know what?\n\n417\n00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.419\nThings hit them out of the blue sometimes.\n\n418\n00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:08.185\nAnd sometimes a customer can\nsimply turn around and say,\n\n419\n00:25:08.185 --> 00:25:09.691\nyou've not been performing.\n\n420\n00:25:09.691 --> 00:25:12.530\nIt's time that we looked at\nanother service provider.\n\n421\n00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:17.470\nSo we should always let our senior\nmanagement know if something like this\n\n422\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:18.810\nis happening.\n\n423\n00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.700\nThen meet with the BRMs and\nthe business to discuss the report.\n\n424\n00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.140\nI don't think it's just\ndiscussion that we need.\n\n425\n00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.711\nI think we need a little bit\nmore than just discussion.\n\n426\n00:25:28.711 --> 00:25:32.743\nWe've already discussed,\nbecause we've produced a report and\n\n427\n00:25:32.743 --> 00:25:34.803\nwe've given it to the customer.\n\n428\n00:25:34.803 --> 00:25:36.412\nSo it's already out there.\n\n429\n00:25:36.412 --> 00:25:41.272\nAgreeing on a set of improvement actions\nwith the customers, the BRMs, the SLM,\n\n430\n00:25:41.272 --> 00:25:44.449\nand availability management,\nI'm okay with that.\n\n431\n00:25:44.449 --> 00:25:45.227\nI'm okay.\n\n432\n00:25:45.227 --> 00:25:49.166\nAlthough that doesn't address the issue\nthat if we increase availability,\n\n433\n00:25:49.166 --> 00:25:51.720\nthen we're probably going\nto need more money.\n\n434\n00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.950\nSo I'm okay with C.\n\n435\n00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.421\nBut it's not as good as B.\n\n436\n00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:59.030\nLet's take a look then at our one pointer,\nokay.\n\n437\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:03.960\nAnd our one pointer talks about discussing\nthe result of the analysis with\n\n438\n00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.198\njust the SLM team, nobody else.\n\n439\n00:26:06.198 --> 00:26:09.201\nWe're not going to involve anymore\nstakeholders, just the SLM team.\n\n440\n00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:14.450\nGet agreement from the BRM that\nthe SLA's are still valid.\n\n441\n00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:18.260\nWhoa that's a huge, big assumption.\n\n442\n00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.328\nAnd that the problem is that\nthe business users are not aware of\n\n443\n00:26:21.328 --> 00:26:22.721\nthe existing targets.\n\n444\n00:26:22.721 --> 00:26:24.441\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n445\n00:26:24.441 --> 00:26:26.881\nWe are delivering value to the business.\n\n446\n00:26:26.881 --> 00:26:29.440\nThe business tell us what they value.\n\n447\n00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.138\nWe don't turn around to them and\nsay you're wrong, okay.\n\n448\n00:26:33.138 --> 00:26:36.820\nWe can't simply go with that.\n\n449\n00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.358\nWe really, really can't, okay.\n\n450\n00:26:39.358 --> 00:26:42.960\nYou never turn around to\nthe organization and say, you're wrong.\n\n451\n00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.380\nYour targets are invalid.\n\n452\n00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.130\nWe can't do that.\n\n453\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.880\nUse an awareness campaign to ensure all\nbusiness users understand the existing\n\n454\n00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.060\nSLAs and targets.\n\n455\n00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.258\n[SOUND] It goes back to\nwhat I was just saying,\n\n456\n00:26:56.258 --> 00:26:58.403\nyou don't just tell them\nthat they're wrong.\n\n457\n00:26:58.403 --> 00:27:03.768\nRemember in previous episodes, and we've\ntalked about this in service strategy,\n\n458\n00:27:03.768 --> 00:27:08.453\nin shows of service strategy,\nalso in service level management as well,\n\n459\n00:27:08.453 --> 00:27:13.437\nin service design, in this episode, and\nthen we've looked at this in service\n\n460\n00:27:13.437 --> 00:27:17.550\noperation and in CSI,\nin fact in absolutely everything.\n\n461\n00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:22.068\nAnd I've talked about communication\nbeing in the language of the audience.\n\n462\n00:27:22.068 --> 00:27:25.840\nIt's not your job to try and\nfigure out what I’m saying.\n\n463\n00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.950\nIt's my job to ensure that I speak and\n\n464\n00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.060\nthat I communicate in\na way that you understand.\n\n465\n00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.530\nLook at that last bullet point in A.\n\n466\n00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:39.203\nIt says use an awareness campaign\nto ensure that all users understand\n\n467\n00:27:39.203 --> 00:27:40.290\nthe existing SLAs.\n\n468\n00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.450\nIn other words, what I'm gonna try and\ndo is I'm gonna try and\n\n469\n00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:50.379\nexplain everything to you, even though I'm\nwrong, I'm just gonna explain it to you.\n\n470\n00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:53.352\nAnd that's gonna make\neverything all right.\n\n471\n00:27:53.352 --> 00:27:55.880\nYou shouldn't explain\nthings in the first place.\n\n472\n00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.912\nThey should be self-explanatory\nto the organization.\n\n473\n00:27:59.912 --> 00:28:02.297\nIf you have to explain\nsomething to somebody,\n\n474\n00:28:02.297 --> 00:28:05.020\nthen you're communicating ineffectively.\n\n475\n00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.339\nAnd that applies to our service\nlevel agreements as well, okay.\n\n476\n00:28:08.339 --> 00:28:11.130\nIt applies to any form of communication.\n\n477\n00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.080\nIf you have to explain something,\nif you have to justify something,\n\n478\n00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.680\nthen you've communicated\nineffectively in the first place.\n\n479\n00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.940\nSo that last bullet point is never gonna,\nI’m just gonna tell you why I’m right?\n\n480\n00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.009\nI don't think so.\n\n481\n00:28:26.009 --> 00:28:29.510\nIf that's at one point to them,\nwhat's our distractor gonna look like?\n\n482\n00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.920\n&gt;&gt; Let's have a look.\n\n483\n00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.300\nDistractor just says\nanalyze the situation and\n\n484\n00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.856\nproduce a report summarizing the findings.\n\n485\n00:28:35.856 --> 00:28:36.376\nTo who?\n\n486\n00:28:36.376 --> 00:28:39.430\nWhat situation?\n\n487\n00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.759\nGet an agreement from SLM that\nthe existing targets are invalid, okay.\n\n488\n00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:45.750\nAnd propose revised targets.\n\n489\n00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.760\nWhere are you going to get them from?\n\n490\n00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.652\nAre you just going to magic\nthem out of thin air?\n\n491\n00:28:49.652 --> 00:28:52.155\nAre we not gonna go back\nto the business at all?\n\n492\n00:28:52.155 --> 00:28:55.465\nProduce an executive summary for\nsenior IT management and\n\n493\n00:28:55.465 --> 00:28:59.327\ngain their backing to\nenforce the new targets.\n\n494\n00:28:59.327 --> 00:29:04.327\nThere's nothing like a baseball bat\nto encourage people to accept what\n\n495\n00:29:04.327 --> 00:29:05.757\nyou are proposing.\n\n496\n00:29:05.757 --> 00:29:09.884\nAnd then implement these new SLAs as\na matter of urgency before customer\n\n497\n00:29:09.884 --> 00:29:11.715\nsatisfaction worsens.\n\n498\n00:29:11.715 --> 00:29:17.106\nSo me dictating something to you is\ngoing to make you happier, is it?\n\n499\n00:29:17.106 --> 00:29:20.225\nOkay.\n[LAUGH] I have this sort of theory or\n\n500\n00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:25.890\nthis premise that I'll tell\neverybody to take into a test.\n\n501\n00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.537\nIf the answer makes you laugh,\nit's the wrong answer, all right.\n\n502\n00:29:29.537 --> 00:29:33.111\nIf any answer, if any statement\nin any answer makes you laugh,\n\n503\n00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:35.749\nthen I can tell you now\nit's the wrong answer.\n\n504\n00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.310\nLet's go on to question number four then.\n\n505\n00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:43.107\nAs an ITIL expert, you've been asked\nto give guidance on how to gain better\n\n506\n00:29:43.107 --> 00:29:46.280\nmanagement and\ncontrol of suppliers and contracts.\n\n507\n00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.420\nWhich of these is the best approach?\n\n508\n00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.520\nWe've got a company in a shipping\nindustry with 5,000 employees.\n\n509\n00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.730\nThey've got 100 small offices\nin 80 different countries.\n\n510\n00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.061\nThink about culture, think about language.\n\n511\n00:29:59.061 --> 00:30:03.741\nThe IT department has got 70 people\nwith some local IT staff and\n\n512\n00:30:03.741 --> 00:30:05.831\nsuperusers at each office.\n\n513\n00:30:05.831 --> 00:30:08.181\nSo they understand the local environment.\n\n514\n00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:09.550\nThey understand the culture.\n\n515\n00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.371\nThey understand the environment.\n\n516\n00:30:11.371 --> 00:30:13.499\nIT offers a broad range of services.\n\n517\n00:30:13.499 --> 00:30:16.570\nAnd delivery of these\ndepends on many suppliers.\n\n518\n00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.477\nAnd these contracts are being managed by\ndifferent teams which hasn't been an issue\n\n519\n00:30:20.477 --> 00:30:21.311\nuntil recently.\n\n520\n00:30:21.311 --> 00:30:25.570\nBecause of high staff turnover, some of\nthe contracts aren't managed properly.\n\n521\n00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.869\nAnd the contract for management of\nthe Internet domain was not renewed,\n\n522\n00:30:29.869 --> 00:30:33.268\nnearly resulted in the loss\nof the domain name, nearly.\n\n523\n00:30:33.268 --> 00:30:36.458\nThe contract with the laptop\nsupplier was renewed in a hurry.\n\n524\n00:30:36.458 --> 00:30:38.190\nThat's never a good idea.\n\n525\n00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.870\nAnd that's not good for negotiation.\n\n526\n00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:43.541\nEven though, there have been delays in\nthe delivery of the laptop service.\n\n527\n00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:44.977\nThat make sense then.\n\n528\n00:30:44.977 --> 00:30:48.030\nAnd there are no plans for improvement.\n\n529\n00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.803\nSounds to me like there should be.\n\n530\n00:30:49.803 --> 00:30:52.940\nCommunication with another\nsupplier has been really poor.\n\n531\n00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.800\nAnd there have been instances\nwhere targets have not been met.\n\n532\n00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:02.040\nThe management team realizes they need to\nmanage supply contracts more efficiently.\n\n533\n00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:04.848\nThat's called stating the obvious.\n\n534\n00:31:04.848 --> 00:31:08.550\n[LAUGH] They ask each team to report\non how many contracts they manage.\n\n535\n00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:13.170\nAnd the managers were surprised to\nsee how many contracts were involved.\n\n536\n00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.452\nThat doesn't sound very efficient at all.\n\n537\n00:31:15.452 --> 00:31:18.907\nSenior management is concerned about\nthe high number of local contracts\n\n538\n00:31:18.907 --> 00:31:20.102\nwith the same supplier.\n\n539\n00:31:20.102 --> 00:31:25.660\nAnd they believe there is potential to\nintroduce greater cost efficiencies.\n\n540\n00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.018\nSo, you're the ITIL expert.\n\n541\n00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:30.740\nAnd you have been asked to give guidance\non how to gain better management and\n\n542\n00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.050\ncontrol of the supplies.\n\n543\n00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.760\nWhich of these is the best approach?\n\n544\n00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.490\nSo let's take a look at\nour five pointer then, B.\n\n545\n00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.282\nEstablish a policy.\n\n546\n00:31:39.282 --> 00:31:40.730\nThat's consistency.\n\n547\n00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.880\nThat's gonna introduce efficiency.\n\n548\n00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.562\nEnd the supply on contract\nmanagement information system,\n\n549\n00:31:47.562 --> 00:31:50.831\none central database where we\nstore all of our contracts.\n\n550\n00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:55.774\nAnd then categorize supplies as strategic,\ntactical, operational, or commodity.\n\n551\n00:31:55.774 --> 00:32:00.104\nThat gives us a priority matrix for\nour supplies, excellent Then\n\n552\n00:32:00.104 --> 00:32:04.906\nestablish a process with a focus on\nmaintenance of standard contracts,\n\n553\n00:32:04.906 --> 00:32:09.830\nterms and conditions, again,\nconsistency that leads to efficiency.\n\n554\n00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.140\nI love it.\n\n555\n00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.090\nEstablish regular meetings with suppliers.\n\n556\n00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:17.240\nThese are our service review meetings in\norder to monitor contractual performance\n\n557\n00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.320\nand identify improvement areas.\n\n558\n00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.730\nRemember, we went through this when we\nlooked at service level management and\n\n559\n00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:23.740\nsupplier management.\n\n560\n00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.610\nAnd I said to you in our supply\nmanagement episode, go back\n\n561\n00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.549\nto service level management and look at\nwhat we do in service level management.\n\n562\n00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.180\nAnd in fact, in our service level\nmanagement episode I even wrote\n\n563\n00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.910\nout the process by hand on\na piece of paper for you.\n\n564\n00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:44.410\nAnd then I said to you we need to\napply this to supplier management.\n\n565\n00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:48.100\nSo a process of negotiating terms and\nconditions, and\n\n566\n00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:53.636\nthen reviewing behavior and performance\nagainst the targets that we've agreed and\n\n567\n00:32:53.636 --> 00:32:56.680\nthen introducing a service\nimprovement plan.\n\n568\n00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.490\nSo, so far, B has told me\neverything that I need to know.\n\n569\n00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:04.454\nAnd then renegotiate and consolidate\ncontracts with strategic suppliers.\n\n570\n00:33:04.454 --> 00:33:09.830\nYes, because we know that having too many\nsuppliers is just going to be inefficient.\n\n571\n00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.690\nSo let's look at my three pointer then, D.\n\n572\n00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:16.510\nEstablish a supply a policy and\nan SCMIS, supply and\n\n573\n00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.720\ncontract management information system.\n\n574\n00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.890\nCategorize supplies based on risk and\nstrategic value.\n\n575\n00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:27.200\nNo, we categorize suppliers based\non the importance of that supply to\n\n576\n00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.670\nthe organization.\n\n577\n00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:35.140\nStrategic suppliers have a huge impact and\na huge value to the organization.\n\n578\n00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.830\nAnd if you're not too sure,\nif you don't remember this,\n\n579\n00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.490\ngo back to our supplier\nmanagement episodes and\n\n580\n00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.890\nyou'll see a categorization matrix\nin there for our suppliers.\n\n581\n00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:50.630\nAnd we do actually categorize them\nbased on impact and based on value, but\n\n582\n00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:54.710\nthat's why we categorize them as strategic\nand as tactical or as operational.\n\n583\n00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.220\nThen it says establish a process\ndefining a standard approach for\n\n584\n00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:05.570\ncontract evaluation and selection, as well\nas for review, renewal and termination.\n\n585\n00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.664\nWhat about improvements?\n\n586\n00:34:07.664 --> 00:34:10.630\nHm, I like the wording in B better.\n\n587\n00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.570\nThen focus on the relationship and\nperformance management in order to manage\n\n588\n00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:19.220\ncontracts, improvement plans and\ncontractual dispute resolution.\n\n589\n00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:24.370\nOkay, I'm happy with that, but again,\nI like the wording in B better because\n\n590\n00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.740\nthe wording in B talks about regular\nmeetings and regular communication.\n\n591\n00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:32.230\nI mean, I'm not saying that performance\nmanagement isn't going to do that, but\n\n592\n00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.910\nI do like the face to face meetings.\n\n593\n00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:39.654\nRecommend a separate project to assess\npossibilities for contract consolidation\n\n594\n00:34:39.654 --> 00:34:44.341\nwith supplier's delivery services to\nlocal offices on the multiple contracts.\n\n595\n00:34:45.454 --> 00:34:48.133\nWe're recommending a second project,\n\n596\n00:34:48.133 --> 00:34:51.500\nthat's kind of like he big deferral,\nisn't it?\n\n597\n00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.050\nThat's what that is.\n\n598\n00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.760\nI'm recommending that we\ndo something else, but\n\n599\n00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.400\nI'm not going to do it right now.\n\n600\n00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.210\nThe question that you've been asked,\n\n601\n00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:04.480\nis you've been asked to give guidance on\nhow to gain better management and control.\n\n602\n00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.960\nYou've not been asked to\nrecommend ideas for the future.\n\n603\n00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.800\nYou've been asked what to do right now.\n\n604\n00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.070\nBe careful,\nyou have to answer the question, and\n\n605\n00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.606\nI always say to everybody, right.\n\n606\n00:35:15.606 --> 00:35:19.856\nThere's an acronym that I use\nwith everyone with testing,\n\n607\n00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:22.152\nRTFQ, read the full question.\n\n608\n00:35:22.152 --> 00:35:25.810\nOkay, make sure you understand\nwhat's being asked of you.\n\n609\n00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:26.750\nSo what about A then?\n\n610\n00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.200\nA is our one pointer.\n\n611\n00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.380\nA says revise all existing\ncontracts to make sure they're\n\n612\n00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:36.150\naligned with the business needs and\nservice level agreement targets.\n\n613\n00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.640\nCheck all contracts for\nconformance to company policy.\n\n614\n00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.500\nThat's okay, but\nwe're not bringing in any efficiency.\n\n615\n00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.080\nWe're just, sort of, at the moment, just\nadding in a little bit of extra overhead.\n\n616\n00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:54.620\nImplement a FCMIS, include contract\nexpiry dates and automatic notifications.\n\n617\n00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.200\nThat's okay, that will\n\n618\n00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.010\nactually address one of the issues about\na contract expiring and we didn't notice.\n\n619\n00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:04.360\nThat's okay, but it's very targeted.\n\n620\n00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.660\nI'd rather see consistency brought in and\nbringing in efficiency.\n\n621\n00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.780\nAssigning account managers for each\ncontract, I think we've already got one.\n\n622\n00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.380\nI'm sure it said that in the scenario.\n\n623\n00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.610\nThat the contracts were\nmanaged very disparately.\n\n624\n00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:21.560\nSo that's not solving anything,\nbecause we need to consolidate, and\n\n625\n00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.820\nwe need to actually manage\nthem in a consistent way.\n\n626\n00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.960\nAnd renegotiate and\nconsolidate contracts with all suppliers.\n\n627\n00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.490\nDo we need to do that with all suppliers?\n\n628\n00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.320\nSurely, we've got to evaluate\nthe suppliers first.\n\n629\n00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:37.590\nAnd then, of course,\nC's our zero, our distractor.\n\n630\n00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:42.876\nAssign contract manager roles to the teams\nworking closest to the suppliers.\n\n631\n00:36:42.876 --> 00:36:45.980\nWhat are we doing about consolidation\nin that particular point?\n\n632\n00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.740\nAnd what are we doing about consistency?\n\n633\n00:36:49.472 --> 00:36:52.550\nAn NCMIS,\nit's not there to share knowledge, and\n\n634\n00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.650\nit's not there to avoid\ndependency on key people.\n\n635\n00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.980\nMake two people responsible for\neach contract.\n\n636\n00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.531\nLet's just add to the confusion,\nshould we?\n\n637\n00:37:00.531 --> 00:37:01.940\nThat's what that's going to do.\n\n638\n00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.745\nTo counter the high turnover\nemployee satisfaction, why?\n\n639\n00:37:06.745 --> 00:37:11.680\n[LAUGH] What is that going to\ndo to answer the question and\n\n640\n00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.930\nto resolve the issue that\nwe've got in front of us.\n\n641\n00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:19.650\nAnd then decide that the consolidation of\ncontracts with suppliers is out of scope.\n\n642\n00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.410\nIt's exactly not out of scope.\n\n643\n00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.230\nYou've been asked what to do.\n\n644\n00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.520\nIt's not out of scope at all.\n\n645\n00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.170\nThat's even worse than\nthe deferral answer, isn't it?\n\n646\n00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.516\nOkay so, we're now at a point where we\nhave gone through questions one to four,\n\n647\n00:37:34.516 --> 00:37:37.210\nand that is it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n648\n00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.340\nPlease join us again in our next episode,\n\n649\n00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:46.500\nwhere we will go through questions\nnumber five through to eight.\n\n650\n00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.458\nSo for now, I have been Jo Peacock for\nITProTV, and\n\n651\n00:37:50.458 --> 00:37:53.230\nwe'll see you in the next episode.\n\n652\n00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.580\n[SOUND]\n\n",

in episode two of\nour service design exam review.\n\n4\n00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.730\nSo in our previous episode, we went\nthrough questions number one to four.\n\n5\n00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.530\nAnd now, we are going to go to\nquestions number five to eight.\n\n6\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.130\nSo let's just jump straight\ninto question number five then.\n\n7\n00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.970\nAnd question number five looks at\nour service acceptance criteria and\n\n8\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.910\nour service design packages.\n\n9\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.680\nAnd it says, we've got several different\nopinions being put forward on how and\n\n10\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.590\nwhen to create the service\nacceptance criteria and STPs and\n\n11\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.360\nwhich of these is the best approach.\n\n12\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.050\nWell, we've got a large company\nwith an internal IT unit.\n\n13\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.860\nAnd the IT unit's been using ITIL as\na framework for best practice for\n\n14\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.430\na number of years and has demonstrated\nCSI in the quality of our services.\n\n15\n00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.510\nThe processes implemented during this time\nare mainly those within service transition\n\n16\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.430\nand operation stages.\n\n17\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.180\nSo what does that mean for you then?\n\n18\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.427\nThat means that we're looking at maybe\ntransition planning and support.\n\n19\n00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:08.458\nWe're looking at change management,\nperhaps change evaluation, release and\n\n20\n00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:11.490\ndeployment management,\nservice validation and testing.\n\n21\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.630\nWe could be looking at\nknowledge management.\n\n22\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.190\nWe could also be looking\nat service asset and\n\n23\n00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.280\nconfiguration management in\nterms of service operation.\n\n24\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.800\nAnd we're looking at incident and\nproblem and request fulfillment.\n\n25\n00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.120\nWe're looking at events and\naccess managements as well.\n\n26\n00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.701\nSo they've recently reviewed their\nservice management activities and\n\n27\n00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:34.728\ndecided that they should be implementing\nprocesses that have a greater influence\n\n28\n00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:35.851\nover service design.\n\n29\n00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:39.419\nThere have recently been a number of\nissues related to the handover and\n\n30\n00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:41.260\noperation of new services.\n\n31\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.420\nSo that tells me that we're looking\nat some early life support,\n\n32\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.360\nreleasing deployment,\nchange management perhaps.\n\n33\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.330\nAnd then it shouldn't there be an issues\nwith the ability to meet the levels of\n\n34\n00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.850\nservice warranty.\n\n35\n00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.220\nWarranty in our short\nlevels of availability,\n\n36\n00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.899\ncapacity, continuity and\nsecurity must be and expected by users.\n\n37\n00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:04.820\nThe design coordination managers decided\nthat in order to address these issues,\n\n38\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.660\nthey'll introduce service acceptance\ncriteria and SDPs for all services,\n\n39\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.010\nto new services that\nare considered pilots.\n\n40\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.050\nThe new web ordering service\nto be launched next month.\n\n41\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.780\nAnd the client management service for\n\n42\n00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.940\nwhich the design project has just\nstarted very, very important.\n\n43\n00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.360\nThe new web ordering\nservice is next month.\n\n44\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.250\nIf it's going to be launched next month,\n\n45\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.650\nthink about where that is\nin that project life cycle.\n\n46\n00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.520\nIt's gonna be towards the end.\n\n47\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.180\nIt's gonna be towards the end\nof service transition.\n\n48\n00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.403\nIt should be in the testing\nphase right now,\n\n49\n00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:43.984\nif it's going to be launched\nin the next months.\n\n50\n00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:47.584\nAnd then think about the new\nclient management system for\n\n51\n00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.720\nwhich the design project has just started.\n\n52\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.080\nSo we're way back in that timeline and\nwe're at the beginning of service design.\n\n53\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.760\nWe haven't started any development yet.\n\n54\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.360\nThink about what a design package does.\n\n55\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.150\nA design package is a blueprint for\nthe development, and\n\n56\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.910\nfor the transition, and for the build and\nthe testing and the deployment.\n\n57\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.780\nAre we going to produce a service design\npackage for a service that is going\n\n58\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.610\nto be launched within the next month,\nwhen all that work have been down already?\n\n59\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.460\nJust think about this.\n\n60\n00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.650\nLet's go into our answers then and let's\nsee what we've got for our five pointer.\n\n61\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.853\nAnd our five pointer is D.\n\n62\n00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:35.870\nD, talks about standard templates and\nguidelines should be developed.\n\n63\n00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.490\nYes, definitely we want consistency and\n\n64\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.090\ndesign coordination is\ngoing to give us that.\n\n65\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.470\nChoose the new client management\nservice to be a pilot.\n\n66\n00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.990\nSpecific SAC should be created\nduring the requirements phase of\n\n67\n00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.710\nthe service design stage.\n\n68\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.640\nAnd an SDP should be assembled for\n\n69\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.160\nthe client management service\nbefore it moves into transition.\n\n70\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.342\nNotice that we have not looked at the web\nordering service because as I have\n\n71\n00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:08.293\nalready said, that web ordering service is\nalready into that sort of launch phase.\n\n72\n00:04:08.293 --> 00:04:10.027\nSo let us take a look at\nthat three pointer then.\n\n73\n00:04:10.027 --> 00:04:12.176\nAnd the three pointer is A.\n\n74\n00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:15.641\nAnd your three pointer talks about\nsimply standard templates and\n\n75\n00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:19.500\nguidelines should be developed for\nboth the SAC and the SDP.\n\n76\n00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.500\nYes, we know this, okay?.\n\n77\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.650\nChoose the new client service\nmanagements service to be a pilot?\n\n78\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.450\nYes, because it's still\nwithin a design stage.\n\n79\n00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.210\nSpecific SAC should be produced and\nindividual SDP assembled for\n\n80\n00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.140\nthe new client management service before\nit's passed to service transition.\n\n81\n00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.730\nYes, I like this, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.022\nHowever, there's only really one\ndifference between A and D, and\n\n83\n00:04:47.022 --> 00:04:49.441\nthat one difference is the fact that.\n\n84\n00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:55.820\nWe talk about developing SAC during\nthe requirement phase of service design.\n\n85\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.210\nOkay, and\nit doesn't actually say that in A.\n\n86\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.080\nIt just says,\nspecific SAC should be produced.\n\n87\n00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.620\nAnd so that's the reason why A is 3.2\nis that it's just not as specific.\n\n88\n00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.740\nLet's take a look then at C.\n\n89\n00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.760\nC, is your one pointer.\n\n90\n00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.121\nAnd C talks about standard templates and\nguidelines should be developed for STPs.\n\n91\n00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:20.793\nYes, but not SAC.\n\n92\n00:05:20.793 --> 00:05:23.220\nOkay, how is that consistent?\n\n93\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.200\nSo how is that efficient?\n\n94\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.050\nUse both of the new services.\n\n95\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.780\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n96\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.680\nDefinitely no.\n\n97\n00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.965\nBecause one of them is already about to\nbe launched, we don't want to reinvent\n\n98\n00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:38.710\nthe wheel for each pilot,\nspecific SAC should be produced.\n\n99\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:45.390\nNo, it's too late to produce the SAC for\nthe one that's about to be launched.\n\n100\n00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.090\nThe SAC is something that\n\n101\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.870\nwe start producing at the beginning of\nservice design in the requirement stage.\n\n102\n00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.810\nThe SDP should be assembled before\nthe service moves into transition,\n\n103\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.330\nthat's right.\n\n104\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.449\nBut one of them is already\nat the end of transition.\n\n105\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.460\nLet's look at our distractor then.\n\n106\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.001\nThere's been a lot of handover issues and\nso therefore,\n\n107\n00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:11.562\nthe new web ordering service\nshould be chosen as a pilot.\n\n108\n00:06:11.562 --> 00:06:14.919\nThe web ordering service,\nthe one we're just about to launch.\n\n109\n00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.501\nWe're not going to introduce SAC and\n\n110\n00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:22.420\nSDP in the web ordering service\nbecause we're reinvented the wheel.\n\n111\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.450\nWe've already designed it.\n\n112\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.660\nWhy would we want to build\na service design package for\n\n113\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.410\nsomething we've already designed and\ndeveloped and are testing right now?\n\n114\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.200\nIt doesn't make any sense to do so.\n\n115\n00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.280\nThe SAC and SDP for\neach service will be different, so\n\n116\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.960\nthere's no need to create standard\ntemplates, no, that goes against\n\n117\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.820\neverything that I stand for when it\ncomes to efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n118\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.987\nNo, no,\nrun away as quick as you can, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.290\nSpecific SAC should be produced and\n\n120\n00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.800\na regional SDP should be assembled for\nthe new client management service\n\n121\n00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.830\nduring the requirements\nphase of the service design.\n\n122\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.110\nEverything should be done during\nthe requirements phase of service design.\n\n123\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.990\nThis web ordering service is way,\nway past that.\n\n124\n00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.390\nAs we said as we went\nthrough the scenario itself.\n\n125\n00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.360\nOkay, let’s take a look then\nat question number six.\n\n126\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.330\nAnd question number six asked you,\nwhich of the following options is the best\n\n127\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.160\nproposal to present to\nthe steering committee?\n\n128\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.070\nIt’s a small mobile phone company,\na cellphone company.\n\n129\n00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.000\nIt’s renowned for the quality\nof their products and services.\n\n130\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.910\nAnd six months ago they decided\nto offer fixed line services.\n\n131\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.570\nIt's a strategic business project which\nhas been kept secret to make it hard for\n\n132\n00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.810\ncompetitors.\n\n133\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.960\nNew business processes have been prepared\nand marketing campaign is planned.\n\n134\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.960\nIt's gonna start in four months time.\n\n135\n00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.680\nOn that date, the company then should\nbe ready to sell, activate and\n\n136\n00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.730\nmanage contracts.\n\n137\n00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.469\nAnd the contract with the fixed\nwas operator was signed.\n\n138\n00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.240\nThe business has just informed\nIT of the new project.\n\n139\n00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.300\nIt happens in this way all the time.\n\n140\n00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.556\n[LAUGH] Their external\nconsultant did an analysis.\n\n141\n00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:05.659\nAnd concluded that it should take about\nthree months to develop the services.\n\n142\n00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:09.404\nOkay, the service is going\nto start in four months, but\n\n143\n00:08:09.404 --> 00:08:14.500\nit's gonna take three months to\ndevelop the required IT services.\n\n144\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.380\nThis is a strategic move for\nthe company, and it has to be a success.\n\n145\n00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.870\nSo a significant budget\nhas been allocated,\n\n146\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.090\nyou're the service design manager.\n\n147\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.180\nYou can't see how it's possible to design\nand develop the required IT services\n\n148\n00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.060\nwithin four months, but the external\nconsultant said it should take three.\n\n149\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.950\nThe infrastructure will\nhave to be expanded, and\n\n150\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.340\nthe new applications are needed.\n\n151\n00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.750\nAnd it might be possible to reuse\nsome existing applications, but\n\n152\n00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.930\ninterfaces to the telepathy\nsystem must be rewritten.\n\n153\n00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.686\nIt's also necessary for them to review\nthe IT processes and train the staff.\n\n154\n00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:50.890\nThe CIO is under pressure to make\nsure the design is balanced.\n\n155\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.140\nBut it's feasible and achievable\nwithin the time constraints, and\n\n156\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.040\nit's going to be a success.\n\n157\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.550\nYou're the service design manager, so\n\n158\n00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.700\nyou've been invited to the next\nmeeting with the steering committee.\n\n159\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.810\nBearing in mind, you're the service design\nmanager, and you're fairly negative.\n\n160\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.880\nOkay, read the above paragraph.\n\n161\n00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.660\nYou've been asked to propose\nan approach that will best meet\n\n162\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.640\nthe business need to\nlaunch in four months.\n\n163\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.520\nYou know what the first\nthing that I would do is?\n\n164\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.880\nThe first thing that I would do, is go and\nhave a chat with that external consultant,\n\n165\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.260\nand find out where he\ngot his timeline from.\n\n166\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.010\nAnd that's exactly what we've\ngot in our five pointer there.\n\n167\n00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.140\nOkay, work with the external consultant.\n\n168\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.090\nThe requirements for\n\n169\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.220\nbusiness validation will be documented\nbased on current business knowledge.\n\n170\n00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.800\nSo thereafter,\nthen do a high level design,\n\n171\n00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.590\nincluding the technical operation and\norganizational aspects.\n\n172\n00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.310\nAnd then, a preferred solution\nwith the costs and risks and\n\n173\n00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.640\nhigh level plan should be proposed\nto the business for final decision.\n\n174\n00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.680\nAll of that makes complete sense to me.\n\n175\n00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.030\nMy three pointer is B.\n\n176\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.870\nFirst of all,\na business requirements analysis will be\n\n177\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.100\ncarried out to identify priorities and\ntime constraints.\n\n178\n00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.963\nWe've already got them.\n\n179\n00:10:01.963 --> 00:10:04.400\nWe know the priorities, and\nwe know the time constraint.\n\n180\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.956\nSo you don't need to do that again,\nyou're wasting time by doing that.\n\n181\n00:10:08.956 --> 00:10:12.477\nThe analysis from the external consultant\nwill be taken into consideration,\n\n182\n00:10:12.477 --> 00:10:13.020\nof course.\n\n183\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.880\nBut I'd go to him first and find out where\nhe got all of his research from, and\n\n184\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.240\nwhere he got his timeline from.\n\n185\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.680\nRequirements will be presented to\nthe business for validation and sign off.\n\n186\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.250\nNo, we already know their requirements.\n\n187\n00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.475\nThey're after a high level\ndesign including technical,\n\n188\n00:10:30.475 --> 00:10:34.858\noperational, and organizational\naspects will be produced to replace.\n\n189\n00:10:34.858 --> 00:10:39.106\nSorry, and then external resources\nwill be hired to replace internal\n\n190\n00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:42.290\nresources on less strategic projects.\n\n191\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.440\nI'm worried that that's an assumption.\n\n192\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.470\nOkay, we don't know that\nuntil we produce the plans.\n\n193\n00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.490\nA preferred solution with customers\nin the high level plan, and\n\n194\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.270\nsourcing options will be proposed\nto the business for final decision.\n\n195\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.950\nI quite like that, but there's\nan assumption there that we're going to\n\n196\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.860\ngo outside, and\nthat worries me a little bit.\n\n197\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.520\nSo let's think about, then,\nour one pointer, which is D.\n\n198\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.130\nConsidering time constraints,\n\n199\n00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.770\nthe development project should be\noutsourced to a software company.\n\n200\n00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.150\nRenowned for their ability to\ntake over challenging tasks.\n\n201\n00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.960\nOr you are the service design manager,\nand you'll just basically turn around and\n\n202\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.570\nsay, no, I don't wanna do this,\nand then running away.\n\n203\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.753\nThat's what's happening.\n\n204\n00:11:22.753 --> 00:11:26.760\nInternal business experts will be\ninvolved in requirements phase.\n\n205\n00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.640\nThe contract should specify the defaced\napproach with regular progress meetings\n\n206\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.920\nshould be followed.\n\n207\n00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.480\nSo that the balance between time\nfunctionality and cost, can be met.\n\n208\n00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.070\nOkay, but regular meetings doesn't\nmean that that's going to be bad.\n\n209\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.740\nIt should also guarantee,\n\n210\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.230\nwe guarantee nothing in IT that\nword needs to jump out at you.\n\n211\n00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.750\nThat the final product will be ready for\nthe launch in four months time.\n\n212\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.390\nWe need that, but\nwe don't like to guarantee anything in IT.\n\n213\n00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:57.340\nSo that doesn't sound\nvery good to me either.\n\n214\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.568\nLet's take a look at our distractor, then.\n\n215\n00:12:00.568 --> 00:12:05.852\nSee, considering the time constraints,\nthe pragmatic approach will be adopted.\n\n216\n00:12:05.852 --> 00:12:10.340\nSo the screens and interfaces can be shown\nto the business as quickly as possible.\n\n217\n00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.830\nTo ensure enough time to get feedback, and\n\n218\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.090\nadjust the solution to\nthe actual requirements.\n\n219\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.930\nWhere on earth have you\ncome up with this from?\n\n220\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.680\nWhere on earth can you just suddenly\nmagic screens, and interfaces from?\n\n221\n00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.900\nDid they just appear in the ether and\nyou said, that's a good idea,\n\n222\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.980\nlet's show them to the business?\n\n223\n00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.860\nHow could you start off a project?\n\n224\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.870\nYou can't get into the end of the project\nbefore starting off the project.\n\n225\n00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.120\nI'm going to show you something,\nbut you know,\n\n226\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.240\nit doesn't mean anything,\nbecause I haven't yet design it.\n\n227\n00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.210\nYeah, all right, then.\n\n228\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.500\nFlexible and agile development techniques.\n\n229\n00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.970\nPlease, please, please, please,\n\n230\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:52.500\nplease do not be distracted by\nthe use of project management methods.\n\n231\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.230\nOr by the use of project management tools.\n\n232\n00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.880\nJust because it mentions agile,\ndoesn't mean that that's a good answer.\n\n233\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.550\nCuz you're kind of assuming\na lot of things here.\n\n234\n00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.570\nFlexible and Agile development techniques\nwill be used to ensure the services go\n\n235\n00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.820\nlive on time with\nthe functionality required.\n\n236\n00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.828\nJust because you're using Agile doesn't\nmean that you're going to ensure this.\n\n237\n00:13:14.828 --> 00:13:15.710\nA pre requisite for\n\n238\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:20.700\nsuch an approach is to work with technical\nexperts throughout the project, okay.\n\n239\n00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.490\nExternal experts must be involved as\nthe skills are not available in house.\n\n240\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.610\nWhere does it say that in the scenario?\n\n241\n00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.010\nThat is one huge assumption, and\nit doesn't say that to me at all.\n\n242\n00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.500\nI didn't read it that way, did you?\n\n243\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.390\nIt said that we had an external consultant\nthat consulted on the project, but\n\n244\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.110\nnot that we don't have the expertise.\n\n245\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.310\nOkay, all right then, so now let's take\na look at then at the question number 7.\n\n246\n00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:51.400\nQuestion number 7, you have been asked to\nassist in the design of measurements and\n\n247\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.445\nKPIs for processes covered by a project,\n\n248\n00:13:54.445 --> 00:13:58.281\nas well as to design\neffective management reports.\n\n249\n00:13:58.281 --> 00:14:02.144\nThe process and key stakeholders have\nalready identified quite a few metrics for\n\n250\n00:14:02.144 --> 00:14:03.250\nmeasurements.\n\n251\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.450\nBut they need your guidance on which ones\nto choose and how they should use them.\n\n252\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.420\nNow let's take a look at this\nscenario then for question seven.\n\n253\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.210\nThe IT department in a retail company is\norganized ITIL training for all employees.\n\n254\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.320\nUnless, the staff learned about it, they\nrealized that there were many potential\n\n255\n00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.940\nareas for improvement in the organization.\n\n256\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.470\nThey've got a well established\nservice desk and a process for\n\n257\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.740\nincident management.\n\n258\n00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.340\nBut there's a general impression that\nincidents could be solved quicker.\n\n259\n00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.491\nIt's an impression.\n\n260\n00:14:32.491 --> 00:14:35.648\nChange management is not\nfollowed as intended.\n\n261\n00:14:35.648 --> 00:14:40.160\nIn practice, different teams carry out\nchange management in different ways,\n\n262\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.020\nbecause they see the documented\nprocess as slow and bureaucratic.\n\n263\n00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.285\nThat is such a common issue\nwith change management.\n\n264\n00:14:48.285 --> 00:14:51.935\nThey realize the problem management\nprocess is based on misunderstanding of\n\n265\n00:14:51.935 --> 00:14:56.355\nwhat incidents and problems are, and\nthat this process should be redesigned.\n\n266\n00:14:56.355 --> 00:15:00.815\nAnd by the way, if you have any\nmisconceptions about any of these then\n\n267\n00:15:00.815 --> 00:15:04.245\nplease take a look at our\nepisodes on change management,\n\n268\n00:15:04.245 --> 00:15:05.665\ntake a look at our episodes.\n\n269\n00:15:05.665 --> 00:15:08.475\nWe actually have an episode\nin Service Operation\n\n270\n00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:11.635\nthat specifically looks at the difference\nbetween an incident and a problem.\n\n271\n00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.090\nA significant issue was that no\nformal process information or\n\n272\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.720\nreporting was in place.\n\n273\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.960\nSo, process improvement project\nhas been initiated, and\n\n274\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.720\na new problem management process will\nsoon be ready for implementation.\n\n275\n00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.260\nSeveral improvement areas have been\nidentified for change management.\n\n276\n00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.450\nManagement and\nreporting system has been defined,\n\n277\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.320\nas a key delivery for this project.\n\n278\n00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.712\nAs management realized that\nwell defined KPIs, and\n\n279\n00:15:38.712 --> 00:15:42.577\nthe improvement well reported,\ncan motivate employees.\n\n280\n00:15:42.577 --> 00:15:47.930\nIt can also de-motivate employees,\nit can be very demoralizing.\n\n281\n00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.950\nAs well as improve overall\ncontrol of processes.\n\n282\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:55.276\nThe challenge is to determine the best\nway to set up the measurement system.\n\n283\n00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:59.013\nSo you've been asked to\nassist in that design.\n\n284\n00:15:59.013 --> 00:16:01.358\nAs well as to design\nthe reports themselves.\n\n285\n00:16:01.358 --> 00:16:05.461\nSo you're being asked to assist in\nthe design of the measurement system, and\n\n286\n00:16:05.461 --> 00:16:08.570\nin the actual report, so\nin what you are going to measure.\n\n287\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:15.004\nWe've got key stakeholders identified,\nbut they need your guidance.\n\n288\n00:16:15.004 --> 00:16:16.600\nSo what's the best answer here?\n\n289\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.447\nAll right, so\nwhat's our five pointer then?\n\n290\n00:16:19.447 --> 00:16:21.708\nOur five pointer here is B.\n\n291\n00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:26.700\nFirst thing that we have to do is\ncategorize our metrics with progress,\n\n292\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.240\ncompliance, effectiveness, and efficiency.\n\n293\n00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.080\nRemember what I always tell\nyou about effective and\n\n294\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.460\nefficiency, progress is\nprogress with any process and\n\n295\n00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:40.590\ncompliance to the actual\nprocess objectives, okay.\n\n296\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.810\nOut of few effectiveness metrics for\nthe change in incident management,\n\n297\n00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.170\nbut yeah,\ncuz we know we've got issues there.\n\n298\n00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.880\nEfficiency metrics should\nbe used of this stage for\n\n299\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:55.410\nincident management because we've got\nthis perception, back in the scenario,\n\n300\n00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.740\nthat we could be doing incident\nmanagement a little bit better.\n\n301\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.920\nAnd then a balanced scorecard approach\nwith primary metrics underpinned\n\n302\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.530\nby secondary metrics to be\npresented in dashboard reports\n\n303\n00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.940\nin regular meetings with\nthe different stakeholder groups.\n\n304\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.880\nWe actually looked at this in a lot more\ndepth when we looked at the five aspects\n\n305\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.020\nof service design, and\nwe looked at designing our metrics.\n\n306\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:23.320\nAnd the answer that we got there is\ncompletely out of that particular episode.\n\n307\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.900\nSo that's our five pointer.\n\n308\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.760\nAnd let's take a look at our three pointer\nthen, and our three point being C.\n\n309\n00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.500\nCategorizing the metrics within\nthe four types of progress, compliance,\n\n310\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.290\neffectiveness, and efficiency.\n\n311\n00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:40.250\nIdentify a balance set of efficiency and\ndefectiveness, and progress, and\n\n312\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.335\ncompliance metrics to be implemented for\neach process.\n\n313\n00:17:43.335 --> 00:17:45.580\nI'm happy with this,\nI am happy with that, except for\n\n314\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.940\nthe fact that it doesn't identify or\naddress the specific issues\n\n315\n00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:56.080\nin the scenario, which is for\nchange management and incident management.\n\n316\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.140\nAnd then we talk about dashboard reports\nwith primary metrics for management,\n\n317\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.310\na secondary metrics.\n\n318\n00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.410\nA dashboard is my real time reports.\n\n319\n00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.550\nMy score card is my point in time report.\n\n320\n00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:14.990\nSo my scorecards will give me, at a point\nin time, how things are looking right now,\n\n321\n00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.210\nor how things are looking\nat that particular point.\n\n322\n00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.150\nMy dashboard's just gonna tell me\nhow things are looking right now.\n\n323\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.770\nA scorecard's going to give me,\na balance scorecard should give me,\n\n324\n00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.340\na report looking at a period of time.\n\n325\n00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.768\nWhereas, the dashboard's just\ngonna tell you the real time view.\n\n326\n00:18:32.768 --> 00:18:36.880\nSo a dashboard's never going\nto give you everything,\n\n327\n00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.780\njust that quick snapshot real time.\n\n328\n00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.160\nAnd it says ensure that\nreports are on the agenda for\n\n329\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.790\nmanagement meetings to be\nheld at monthly basis.\n\n330\n00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:50.190\nAnd that's okay, but if you put in a\ndashboard report in for a monthly meeting,\n\n331\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.010\nthen I'm not too sure that, that's going\nto tell management anything at all,\n\n332\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:59.640\nbecause it's just gonna tell you what\nhappened at exactly that point in time.\n\n333\n00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.270\nIt's not going to give you\nan overview over a period of time.\n\n334\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.950\nLet's look at my one pointer then.\n\n335\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.600\nMy one pointer being A,\ncategorize the metrics within three types.\n\n336\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.940\nNo, what about effectiveness?\n\n337\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.560\nFocus mainly on progress metrics for\nincident management and\n\n338\n00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.200\ncompliance for change management, and\nefficiency for problem management.\n\n339\n00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.600\nProblem management isn't a problem.\n\n340\n00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.050\nProblem management is being followed,\nit's being improved.\n\n341\n00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.958\nAnd then problem management, well, the\nonly confusion is between incidents and\n\n342\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:34.460\nproblems, are we doing\nsomething to address that?\n\n343\n00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:40.826\nCreate standard templates for\nthe process reports, and decide dates for\n\n344\n00:19:40.826 --> 00:19:45.428\nregular posting on an internal website\nin order to make reports easily\n\n345\n00:19:45.428 --> 00:19:47.547\naccessible for all employees.\n\n346\n00:19:47.547 --> 00:19:51.016\nDo they need to be easily accessible for\neverybody?\n\n347\n00:19:51.016 --> 00:19:55.755\nUnfortunately, A lost me the minute\nit talked about categorizing\n\n348\n00:19:55.755 --> 00:19:57.286\nwithin three types.\n\n349\n00:19:57.286 --> 00:20:00.100\nIt mentions incident and\nchange management, but\n\n350\n00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.857\nit doesn't actually address the problems\nwithin incident and change management,\n\n351\n00:20:04.857 --> 00:20:08.609\nbecause the problems are based\non efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n352\n00:20:08.609 --> 00:20:12.274\nAnd that's what we want to really\nemphasize, is the effectiveness for\n\n353\n00:20:12.274 --> 00:20:15.942\nincident management because nobody\nreally understands what incident\n\n354\n00:20:15.942 --> 00:20:17.175\nmanagement should do.\n\n355\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.480\nSo let's look at D then, and\nD talks about, this is our distractor.\n\n356\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.980\nCategorizing our process metrics\nis primary or secondary.\n\n357\n00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:31.130\nWe don't, we categorize as progress,\ncompliance, efficiency, and effectiveness.\n\n358\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.710\nAnd then we go on to measure capability\nand performance of the processes,\n\n359\n00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.510\nfocus on primary metrics for\nall processes and\n\n360\n00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.590\ncontinue a secondary metrics\nas the processes mature.\n\n361\n00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.050\nNo, absolutely not, no,\nwe don't want to do that.\n\n362\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.245\nThe primary and secondary metrics are what\nwe display in a balance scorecard.\n\n363\n00:20:51.775 --> 00:20:54.990\nMetrics that are not possible to measure\nshould be documented requirements for\n\n364\n00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.090\na new tool.\n\n365\n00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.490\nI didn't see anywhere in the scenario\nthat it mentioned a new tool.\n\n366\n00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.176\nAnd the attitude of, well,\nif something doesn't work,\n\n367\n00:21:03.176 --> 00:21:06.807\nthen let's just go and\nbuy something and see if that works.\n\n368\n00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:08.903\nJust because you buy a new\ntool doesn't mean that,\n\n369\n00:21:08.903 --> 00:21:10.680\nthat's going to improve anything at all.\n\n370\n00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.110\nA tool is only as good as\nwhoever has configured it,\n\n371\n00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.290\nand what it's been configured to do.\n\n372\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.480\nSo you have to understand what you're\ntrying to achieve before you actually go\n\n373\n00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.300\nout and buy the tool.\n\n374\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.280\nSo yeah, that's definitely my distractor.\n\n375\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.650\nMy distractor is always going to be\nwherever I see something that says just go\n\n376\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.940\nout and buy something, and\nthen I tend to wanna run away with that.\n\n377\n00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.840\nUnless I can see very,\nvery clear justification for doing so.\n\n378\n00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.790\nSo let me take a look then now at our last\nquestion on this particular exam page or\n\n379\n00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.940\npaper, which is question number eight.\n\n380\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.390\nWhich is the best approach for\nlong term improvement?\n\n381\n00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.900\nYou're the service design manager.\n\n382\n00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.630\nIt's a large company which has been\nsuccessful over the last six months\n\n383\n00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.990\nas the result of launch of new products.\n\n384\n00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.140\nLet's cut its down side.\n\n385\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.100\nAt the last IT management meeting,\nthe service level manager presented\n\n386\n00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.360\nthe results of the customer satisfaction\nsurvey, which show that business\n\n387\n00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.750\nsatisfaction has dropped off\nsignificantly in the last six months.\n\n388\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.290\nEven though the company's\nbeen very successful,\n\n389\n00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.360\ncustomer satisfaction's\ndropped off significantly.\n\n390\n00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.760\nThere seems to be a concern about IT\napplications that support the new\n\n391\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.920\nproducts, and customers complain\nabout poor performance and\n\n392\n00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.770\na high number of incidents which\nare the result of infrastructure issues.\n\n393\n00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.730\nOn several occasions,\nthe IT applications and\n\n394\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.810\nsystems couldn't cope with\nthe volume of new customers and\n\n395\n00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.710\ncontracts, even though the sales are fully\nin line with business expectations.\n\n396\n00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.500\nThat sounds like poor\nplanning on our part.\n\n397\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.550\nIt's caused several significant outages,\n\n398\n00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.340\nwhich have adversely\nimpacted the business.\n\n399\n00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.770\nAvailability planning and capacity\nplanning definitely need to be in on this,\n\n400\n00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.120\nmost definitely.\n\n401\n00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.020\nThere's been an advancement in additional\ncapacity to improve the situation in\n\n402\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.430\nthe short term.\n\n403\n00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.270\nHowever, the main issues\nare linked to design flaws.\n\n404\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.160\nThat's my service design package.\n\n405\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.290\nAnd to a lack of operational staff\ninvolvement in design activities.\n\n406\n00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.310\nYou see, this is why I love DevOps, and\n\n407\n00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:10.560\nthis is why I will tell you that we need\nto have DevOps in order to be successful.\n\n408\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.240\nOur operation staff need to be involved.\n\n409\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.300\nIt's suggested that design and\noperations resources work together\n\n410\n00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.940\nto ensure long-term improvement,\nand I agree with that completely.\n\n411\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.780\nSo let's take a look at our answers,\nand looking at our five pointer then.\n\n412\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.048\nOur five pointer talks about organizing\na meeting with senior business\n\n413\n00:23:31.048 --> 00:23:33.609\nmanagement and with the service operation\n\n414\n00:23:33.609 --> 00:23:38.030\nteams in order to understand\nthe latest business and IT strategies.\n\n415\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:44.244\nStep one for planning, okay, find out what\nthe organization are wanting to achieve.\n\n416\n00:23:44.244 --> 00:23:49.693\nOkay, we can't plan unless we know what\nthe organization are wanting to do, okay.\n\n417\n00:23:49.693 --> 00:23:53.912\nStep two,\nwith the help of the internal auditor,\n\n418\n00:23:53.912 --> 00:23:58.941\nan internal auditor reviewed\ncurrent design activities.\n\n419\n00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:03.763\nLet's set priorities, and define a formal\nimprovement program, and measure progress,\n\n420\n00:24:03.763 --> 00:24:06.760\nand report regularly to all stakeholders.\n\n421\n00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.720\nEnsure that the improvements are\nintegrated into existing work practices,\n\n422\n00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.250\nand regularly review design activities and\n\n423\n00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.910\ncustomer satisfaction to identify\nnew improvement opportunities.\n\n424\n00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.730\nWe have to work with the business,\n\n425\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:27.390\nbecause we have to understand what it\nis the business are trying to achieve.\n\n426\n00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:32.440\nSo we have to understand their strategies,\nokay?\n\n427\n00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.300\nSo let's take a look at\nmy three pointer then.\n\n428\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.220\nMy three pointer is A,\nSet up a formal project.\n\n429\n00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:44.620\nThat sounds very formal, and that sounds\nlike that's gonna be a costly overhead,\n\n430\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.660\nand it may be too much bureaucracy\nwith key business representatives and\n\n431\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.800\nservice design resources.\n\n432\n00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.540\nWhat about service operation?\n\n433\n00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.780\nDidn't it say in that scenario we\nshould be involving service operation?\n\n434\n00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.050\nAnalyze documentation describing\nthe latest business and\n\n435\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.770\nIT visions in order to understand\nthe high level drivers.\n\n436\n00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.600\nI'm okay with that, but\nI don't want to analyze documentation.\n\n437\n00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.530\nI want to ask them.\n\n438\n00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.770\nWith the help of an internal auditor\nreview the design against ITIL.\n\n439\n00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.550\nITIL is never going to be\nthe right answer for you.\n\n440\n00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.870\nITIL is not a plug and play.\n\n441\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:23.150\nYou cannot just take it out of the book\nand say, hey, this is going to work here.\n\n442\n00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.090\nYou have to adopt it, and\nyou adapt it to suit your environment.\n\n443\n00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.770\nDefine and agree on priorities,\nand develop an action plan.\n\n444\n00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.290\nOkay.\nI'm all right with that.\n\n445\n00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.590\nAnd plan regular project update\nmeetings to keep everybody informed.\n\n446\n00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.240\nAnd I'm okay with that.\n\n447\n00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.990\nAt the end of the project,\nsubmit a final report to all stakeholders.\n\n448\n00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.130\nNo, because we still need to ensure\nimprovement on an ongoing basis.\n\n449\n00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.780\nProjects don't just stop.\n\n450\n00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.740\nAnd this is the problem.\n\n451\n00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.120\nThis is why we need DevOps involvement,\nbecause projects don't just stop.\n\n452\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.620\nWe hand over to our operating environment,\nand\n\n453\n00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:05.800\nthen we carry on improving any\nnew service or any new process.\n\n454\n00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.810\nSo let me take a look then at our one\npointer, and our one pointer be in D.\n\n455\n00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.787\nOrganize the meeting with the operations\nteams in order to analyze the latest\n\n456\n00:26:13.787 --> 00:26:18.160\nsatisfaction survey and the incidents\nrelated to customer dissatisfaction.\n\n457\n00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.080\nThere wasn't anything that\nsaid that we had incidents\n\n458\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.500\nin that scenario relating\nto dissatisfaction.\n\n459\n00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:30.540\nIn parallel, ask an external consultant to\nreview the design process against ITIL.\n\n460\n00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.060\nWell now we've gone even further,\n\n461\n00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.210\nbecause I've already told you\nthat ITIL isn't plug and play.\n\n462\n00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.120\nIt's not a one-size-fits-all.\n\n463\n00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.040\nBut an external consultant, what somebody\nwho doesn't understand our organization\n\n464\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:48.490\nand who doesn't understand IT, that's not\ngoing to be our best solution for us.\n\n465\n00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:52.940\nSet priorities and present an action\nplan for approval by IT management.\n\n466\n00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.600\nI'm okay with that.\n\n467\n00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.730\nI'm okay with setting priorities.\n\n468\n00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.040\nBut then setting up a formal project to\nget sufficient visibility, resources, and\n\n469\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:01.880\ncontrol.\n\n470\n00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.080\nA formal project suggests bureaucracy.\n\n471\n00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.560\nPlan regular progress meetings to\ntake corrective actions if needed.\n\n472\n00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.260\nThat's okay.\n\n473\n00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:13.160\nIt's not as good as in our three pointer,\nbut that's an okay statement.\n\n474\n00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.070\nAnd at the end of the project, yeah,\n\n475\n00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.140\nwe know that we don't like\nthat bullet point, okay?\n\n476\n00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.000\nIt doesn't accommodate CSI.\n\n477\n00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.950\nSo what's our distractor\ngoing to tell us then?\n\n478\n00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:26.200\nWell our distractor talks about meeting\nwith just the service operation teams\n\n479\n00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.006\nin order to analyze how staff\ncould better collaborate.\n\n480\n00:27:30.006 --> 00:27:30.850\nAll right then.\n\n481\n00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.900\nSo we're putting all of\nthe blame on operations.\n\n482\n00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.790\nThat sounds great.\n\n483\n00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:39.650\nAnd then give them ITIL training,\ncuz that'll solve everything, of course.\n\n484\n00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.480\nInvolve operations staff\nin design projects.\n\n485\n00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.010\nThat's the best statement I've seen so\nfar in my distractor.\n\n486\n00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:50.340\nSet up a group with members from both\nteams to come up with an improvement plan.\n\n487\n00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.640\nOkay.\nThis sounds kind of informal.\n\n488\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.860\nWe've gone from one extreme to the other.\n\n489\n00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.600\nOne answer is really, really formal and\nseems bureaucratic, and\n\n490\n00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.360\nthe other is just too informal.\n\n491\n00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.459\nSponsor and\nfollow the implementation of a plan.\n\n492\n00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.320\nOkay, is it my job to sponsor?\n\n493\n00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.640\nShouldn't it be senior IT management?\n\n494\n00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.030\nAnd then make sure there's a fair\nrepresentation from both teams.\n\n495\n00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:13.764\nWhat teams?\n\n496\n00:28:13.764 --> 00:28:15.600\nI think that we're on it.\n\n497\n00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.970\nBoth teams as in, what,\noperations and development, perhaps?\n\n498\n00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:24.420\nAnd to maximize the chance that\nproposed improvements are properly\n\n499\n00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.690\nintegrated into the, the chance.\n\n500\n00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.990\nYeah, that would help me running\nstraight way, maximizing the chance.\n\n501\n00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.380\nNo, definitely going\nto be your distractor.\n\n502\n00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:42.360\nOkay, so now, we have reached the end\nof sample paper one for service design.\n\n503\n00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.920\nYou do have another sample paper\nin your downloadable material.\n\n504\n00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:52.430\nSo, I would advise you to perform or\ndo that sample paper.\n\n505\n00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.900\nAnd if you do have any queries,\nthen by all means please come back to us\n\n506\n00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.240\nvia our forum, and I will be happy to\nhelp with any queries that you have.\n\n507\n00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.472\nBut for now I have been Jo Peacock, and\n\n508\n00:29:04.472 --> 00:29:07.919\nyou're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n509\n00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:08.720\n[SOUND]\n\n",
