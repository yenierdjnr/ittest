          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.635\n[NOISE] Hi, and welcome to ITPro.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:08.139\nMy name is Jo Peacock and\n\n3\n00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.190\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL Intermediate.\n\n4\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.250\nSo let's take a look then at\nour first slide here coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.250\nAnd we have our introduction\nto our intermediate class and\n\n6\n00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.340\nYou will see what we will cover\nis an introduction to the class,\n\n8\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.100\nfollowed by the principles and\nthe processes of the life cycle phase.\n\n9\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550\nThen we'll take a look at organizing for\nthat life cycle phase.\n\n10\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.255\nAnd also the technology considerations,\n\n11\n00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:47.998\nespecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n12\n00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:52.421\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand critical success factors and\n\n13\n00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:56.999\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith that particular life cycle phase.\n\n14\n00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.778\nAnd most importantly, of course for\nyou, is that preparation for\n\n15\n00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:04.980\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class.\n\n16\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.497\nSo let me take a look now then at how\nwe're going to approach this particular\n\n17\n00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:11.869\nintermediate class.\n\n18\n00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work.\n\n19\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.280\nObviously, you're going to be watching us\non screen both myself and my colleagues.\n\n20\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.110\nAnd we're going to be taking you through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n21\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.300\nAnd then there are going to be some\ndiscussions and some exercises.\n\n22\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.720\nThat are going to be based\nprimarily in our chat rooms, and\n\n23\n00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.140\nalso in our forums as well.\n\n24\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.214\nAnd we're also available if you want\nundertake any of the assessments,\n\n25\n00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:45.568\nthen please feel free to come\nback to us through the forums.\n\n26\n00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:49.270\nAnd we will be able to help\nyou out in any way we can.\n\n27\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.950\nAlso provided in the course\nmaterial which is available for\n\n28\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.390\nyou to download are mock tests or\nexams, if you prefer to use that word.\n\n29\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.720\nAnd we will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you.\n\n30\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.540\nSo where are we then at\nITIL intermediate level.\n\n31\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.090\nWell you'll see in using Blooms Taxonomy\nthat we are actually at level 4 analyzing.\n\n32\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.390\nIn other words, we've done foundation\nlevel, we've done the remembering and\n\n33\n00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.470\nunderstanding of those\nconcepts within ITIL.\n\n34\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.198\nAnd we're actually moving through applying\nthose concepts to analyzing those\n\n35\n00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:28.911\nconcepts.\n\n36\n00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:33.325\nAnd being able to apply\nthe ITIL processes and\n\n37\n00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:39.957\nalso the concepts at a real world level,\nin a real world situation.\n\n38\n00:02:39.957 --> 00:02:42.590\nOkay, so where does ITIL come from then?\n\n39\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.080\nWell let me give you a little\nbit of a background.\n\n40\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.330\nIt's actually owned by\na company called Axelos.\n\n41\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.110\nAnd it was first published in\nthe mid 1980s by the UK government.\n\n42\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.020\nAnd the office of government commerce\nowned ITL for a very, very long time.\n\n43\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.509\nAnd we developed ITIL right\nthe way back from the 1980s.\n\n44\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:14.147\nThrough its version 2 in the mid 1990s\nto version 3 which was released in 2007.\n\n45\n00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:19.006\nAnd then there was an update\nto version 3 in 2011 which is\n\n46\n00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:22.450\nexactly where we are right now.\n\n47\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.660\nIt is copyright, it is trademark\nprotected, it's a framework for\n\n48\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.670\nmanaging services.\n\n49\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.960\nAnd as such it is a flexible framework,\n\n50\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.730\na framework that we would expect any\norganization to adopt as a framework.\n\n51\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.126\nBut they're to adapt it\nto suit your needs, okay?\n\n52\n00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:44.898\nITIL was born right\naway back in the 1990s,\n\n53\n00:03:44.898 --> 00:03:49.519\nout of a desire to be able to\ndemonstrate value for money and\n\n54\n00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.068\nefficiency for\nthe use of taxpayers money within the UK.\n\n55\n00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:58.650\nWay back in the 1980s these things\nstarted appearing on desks.\n\n56\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.002\nAnd quite frankly we didn't know\nhow to manage these in an unbiased,\n\n57\n00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:10.109\nin an impartial, and in an efficient and\neffective way and thus ITIL was born.\n\n58\n00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.661\nAnd ITIL was born from a group of\nindustry experts that went out into\n\n59\n00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:19.297\nthe big wide world and analyzed\nvarious organizations from various\n\n60\n00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:22.971\ndifferent industry sectors,\nnot just government.\n\n61\n00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:27.633\nBut we're talking finance,\nwe're talking retail, etc, and\n\n62\n00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:31.230\nthey came back with\na set of best practices.\n\n63\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.176\nBest practices that they\nobserved in the real world for\n\n64\n00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:40.488\nmanaging our IT services and\nthus we have ITIL.\n\n65\n00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:43.207\nAs I've already said we have\nhad subsequent revisions.\n\n66\n00:04:43.207 --> 00:04:46.787\nAnd now we are up to version 3, 2011.\n\n67\n00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:51.363\nSo we welcome the understanding that\n\n68\n00:04:51.363 --> 00:04:56.240\nwe have a life to every single service.\n\n69\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.298\nAnd we start off with\na concept in Service Strategy.\n\n70\n00:05:00.298 --> 00:05:05.080\nAnd there we take that concept and\nwe design it.\n\n71\n00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.890\nAnd then we develop it, and\nwe deploy it as a service into\n\n72\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.520\na live environment, which is where\nwe operate and where we maintain it.\n\n73\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.360\nAnd we continually seek to\nensure that we are aligned with\n\n74\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.230\nthe needs of the organization in CSI.\n\n75\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.040\nSo you're attending this class\nbecause you probably want\n\n76\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.040\nto achieve an ITIL\nintermediate qualification.\n\n77\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.509\nSo you can see that if we were to\nstart off right at the very, very top,\n\n78\n00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.011\nyou'll see where I am.\n\n79\n00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n80\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.491\nI'm also an accredited examiner and\nand the proctor or\n\n81\n00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:52.720\ninvigilator for these exams.\n\n82\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.320\nAnd work very, very closely with\nthe official ITIL accreditor and\n\n83\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.829\nalso AXELOS who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n84\n00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:06.492\nNow in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n85\n00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:10.045\nWell we start off with ITIL Foundation,\nand\n\n86\n00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:15.040\nITIL Foundation would traditionally\nbe a three day classroom\n\n87\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.050\nexperience where we learn\nthe foundations of ITIL.\n\n88\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.809\nWe learn all the terminology and all\nof the definitions to that terminology.\n\n89\n00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:28.900\nThere's roughly around about 75 that we\nlearn within the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n90\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.820\nAnd then as we move through, we can\neither take an ITIL practitioner class,\n\n91\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.710\nwhich can be taken at any point in time\n\n92\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.820\nthroughout the progression\nof your career within ITIL.\n\n93\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.330\nBecause ITIL practitioner focuses\non the implementation of ITIL.\n\n94\n00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.474\nOkay, whereas if we take a look\nat a more advanced intermediate\n\n95\n00:06:50.474 --> 00:06:54.851\nclasses you are at this\nmoment In a Lifecycle module.\n\n96\n00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:59.529\nAnd there is a Lifecycle modules consist\nof service strategy, service design,\n\n97\n00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:04.157\nservice transition, service operation and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n98\n00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:05.550\nAnd that's where we focus,\n\n99\n00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.330\non those Lifecycles that we've\njust looked at previously.\n\n100\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.308\nOkay, and on the right hand side\nthen we have our capability modules.\n\n101\n00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:19.515\nAnd these capability modules\nreally focus on specific\n\n102\n00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:27.450\nareas within ITIL such as off RCV which\nfocuses on release control and validation.\n\n103\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.115\nAnd these classes, you will notice that\nevery single one of these classes has\n\n104\n00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:34.430\ngot a score right beside each one.\n\n105\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.592\nSo we've got a number two for\nITIL Foundation, and we've got a three for\n\n106\n00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:44.510\nLifecycle modules and we've got a four for\nour capability modules.\n\n107\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.585\nNow what we need to do is\nensure that we have achieved\n\n108\n00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:54.779\na minimum of 15 credits at\nboth either life cycle,\n\n109\n00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:57.744\nor capability module level.\n\n110\n00:07:57.744 --> 00:08:03.043\nIn order to be able to qualify to sit\nthe managing across the Lifecycle class,\n\n111\n00:08:03.043 --> 00:08:08.665\nand therefore, subsequently,\nthe test that goes along with that class.\n\n112\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:12.797\nSo we need to take two from the ITIL\nFoundation, that's a prerequisite.\n\n113\n00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:17.823\nWe have to do the foundation, and\nthen we need to add in another 15 scores\n\n114\n00:08:17.823 --> 00:08:22.379\nfrom either as I've said the Lifecycle or\nthe capability stream.\n\n115\n00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.484\nNow you can interchange,\nyou can mix and match,\n\n116\n00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:29.100\nyou do not have to stick to one stream or\nthe other.\n\n117\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.215\nOnce you've got that 17 in total scores\n\n118\n00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:37.165\nthat are needed to be able to sit\nmanaging across the lifecycle.\n\n119\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:41.345\nYou're perfectly able to sit\nthat Lifecycle class and\n\n120\n00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.845\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n121\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.145\nAnd as soon as you've taken that test\nyou will be awarded those five credits\n\n122\n00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:52.535\nwhich will mean that you\nhave achieved ITIL expert.\n\n123\n00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:57.240\nNow ITIL expert is allocated\nas soon as you have passed\n\n124\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.510\nthe managing across the Lifecycle test and\nhave achieved 22 credits.\n\n125\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.160\nBoth of those must have happened for\nyou to achieve ITIL expert.\n\n126\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.741\nNow, we have the ITIL\nmaster qualification and\n\n127\n00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:14.279\nthe ITIL master is\na completely different beast.\n\n128\n00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:18.910\nThe ITIL master is a two\nyear qualification.\n\n129\n00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:24.579\nAnd during that two years,\nyou will be expected to submit various\n\n130\n00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:31.190\nwhite papers on specific topics,\nwithin the ITIL qualifications scheme.\n\n131\n00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.870\nSo these could be topics\non activities within ITIL.\n\n132\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.830\nThese could be topics of\nprocesses within ITIL.\n\n133\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.810\nThese could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n134\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.860\nBut you will be required to sit\na number of white papers, or\n\n135\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.410\nsubmit a number of white papers\nover the period of two years.\n\n136\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.535\nAt the end of those two years,\nonce you have submitted the prerequisite\n\n137\n00:09:56.535 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers, then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n138\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.427\nAnd during that panel interview, you\nwill be assessed not only on your white\n\n139\n00:10:06.427 --> 00:10:11.611\npapers but also on your experience\nwithin the IT service management arena.\n\n140\n00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.514\nAnd at the end of that panel\ninterview then if successful,\n\n141\n00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:18.630\nyou will be awarded\nthe status of ITIL master.\n\n142\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.816\nSo the qualification scheme,\n\n143\n00:10:21.816 --> 00:10:25.067\nI'm going to take this back\nnow to blooms taxonomy then.\n\n144\n00:10:25.067 --> 00:10:28.877\nAnd just very, very quickly look at\nthe fact that an ITIL Foundation and\n\n145\n00:10:28.877 --> 00:10:32.069\nI know that I've already covered\nthis in a previous slide.\n\n146\n00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:36.679\nThat we just looked at understanding,\nunderstanding the terminology and\n\n147\n00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:39.150\nthe concepts of ITIL Foundation.\n\n148\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.169\nAnd then in the life cycle modules,\n\n149\n00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:45.358\nwe're looking at implementing those\nprocesses contained within ITIL.\n\n150\n00:10:45.358 --> 00:10:50.617\nAnd in capability, we're looking\nat actually those processes and\n\n151\n00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:52.838\nmanaging those processes.\n\n152\n00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:57.658\nWhereas managing across the life cycle,\nthis is for senior management.\n\n153\n00:10:57.658 --> 00:11:02.406\nThis is at CIO level and\nat senior management level, and\n\n154\n00:11:02.406 --> 00:11:05.437\nMALC as we like to abbreviate it to,\n\n155\n00:11:05.437 --> 00:11:10.475\nyour concern with leading\nIT service management.\n\n156\n00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:14.875\nSo I mentioned, right at the very\nbeginning of all of this,\n\n157\n00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:20.507\nthat we had a test to go along with every\nsingle life cycle phase and there is.\n\n158\n00:11:20.507 --> 00:11:25.621\nAnd we will be conducting a session to\ngo all over this particular test or\n\n159\n00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:30.310\nat least a sample of this test just\nto give you some preparation for\n\n160\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.960\nthe actual test itself.\n\n161\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.892\nSo your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually.\n\n162\n00:11:38.892 --> 00:11:43.810\nIt is an eight multiple\nchoice question test.\n\n163\n00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.390\nIt's complex multiple choice.\n\n164\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.440\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test, and\n\n165\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.500\nwith every single question.\n\n166\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:58.270\nYou will be given a scenario, and then\nyou will be given four possible options,\n\n167\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.680\nfour possible answers for the question\nthat is posed along with that scenario.\n\n168\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.805\nGet five points for the best fit answer.\n\n169\n00:12:07.805 --> 00:12:10.140\nNow it mentions up there the most correct.\n\n170\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.287\nI always call it the best fit,\nbecause every single question asks,\n\n171\n00:12:14.287 --> 00:12:19.300\nwhat is the best answer given\nthe scenario, and given the question.\n\n172\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.350\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct,\n\n173\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.380\nbecause the question is asking you for\nthe best fit.\n\n174\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.990\nAnd for that best fit,\nyou're gonna get 5 points.\n\n175\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.000\nFor the next best fit,\nyou're going to get 3.\n\n176\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.674\nFor the next one, which we consider to be\nthe least correct, you're gonna get 1.\n\n177\n00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:44.940\nAnd for the next one,\nyou're gonna get a 0.\n\n178\n00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.712\nNow, it mentions up on that slide there\nthe next one is 0 marks for incorrect.\n\n179\n00:12:50.712 --> 00:12:56.490\nWe like to call that in the industry, us\nin the know, we call that the distractor.\n\n180\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.600\nAnd we call that the distractor for\na reason, cuz it distracts.\n\n181\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.103\nAnd quite often what you will\nfind is with your distractor.\n\n182\n00:13:04.103 --> 00:13:09.287\nA lot of the words in the terminology that\nare taken straight out of the ITIL book,\n\n183\n00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:14.168\nstraight out of the publication and\nare input into that zero pointer because\n\n184\n00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:17.081\nit's there to distract and\nit sounds great.\n\n185\n00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:22.111\nBut more often than not,\nthat distractor has absolutely\n\n186\n00:13:22.111 --> 00:13:26.600\nno relevance to the scenario or\nto the question.\n\n187\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.390\nSo you have to be incredibly\ncareful with that.\n\n188\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.322\nIt's so easy to be distracted,\nyou have to get 28\n\n189\n00:13:34.322 --> 00:13:39.138\nout of a possible 40 in\norder to be able to pass and\n\n190\n00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:44.432\nachieve accreditation at\nany Lifecycle test, okay?\n\n191\n00:13:44.432 --> 00:13:48.339\nIf English is not your first language\nyou are allowed a paper dictionary.\n\n192\n00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:53.315\nBut you will be asked to show that\nto the proctor at the time that\n\n193\n00:13:53.315 --> 00:13:55.650\nyou take your test.\n\n194\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.844\nAnd as I've already said, you have to have\n\n195\n00:13:59.844 --> 00:14:05.439\nan ITIL Foundation in version 3 or\nversion 3 2011 or\n\n196\n00:14:05.439 --> 00:14:10.579\nan ITIL version 2 Foundation\nbridge to version 3.\n\n197\n00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:12.628\nI will be very, very honest with you.\n\n198\n00:14:12.628 --> 00:14:17.546\nThere are not that many people that\nhave attained the version 2 to version\n\n199\n00:14:17.546 --> 00:14:18.348\n3 bridge.\n\n200\n00:14:18.348 --> 00:14:22.278\nAnd most people will have the version 3 or\n\n201\n00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:27.230\n2011, sorry, ITIL Foundation certificate.\n\n202\n00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.385\nYou will be required to upload\nthat certificate to the examining\n\n203\n00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:38.430\nboard prior to sitting your Lifecycle\ntest, so be prepared with that.\n\n204\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.590\nYou will need to have it to hand and\nsaved as a PDF as well.\n\n205\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:51.760\nSo when we come to the end of every single\nlife cycle class, we will be going over,\n\n206\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.410\nand this one's no exception,\nwe'll be going over a sample test for you.\n\n207\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.535\nAnd during that sample test,\nI'll be giving you lots of hints and\n\n208\n00:15:00.535 --> 00:15:03.841\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n209\n00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:08.090\nAnd also how to ensure that you read\nthe full question, how to relax.\n\n210\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.737\nAnd to make sure that you\napproach it with an open mind,\n\n211\n00:15:12.737 --> 00:15:17.200\nbut you consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n212\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.680\nUltimately we want to get you past\nthe test just as much as you want to\n\n213\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.760\nachieve that accreditation.\n\n214\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.993\nSo just to sum up,\nwhat we will be doing over the next few\n\n215\n00:15:29.993 --> 00:15:37.108\nshows is encouraging you to take your\nITIL Lifecycle intermediate classes.\n\n216\n00:15:37.108 --> 00:15:42.718\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n217\n00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:45.954\n[NOISE]\n\n",
