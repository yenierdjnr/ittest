          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.635\n[NOISE] Hi, and welcome to ITPro.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:08.139\nMy name is Jo Peacock and\n\n3\n00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.190\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL Intermediate.\n\n4\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.250\nSo let's take a look then at\nour first slide here coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.250\nAnd we have our introduction\nto our intermediate class and\n\n6\n00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.340\nYou will see what we will cover\nis an introduction to the class,\n\n8\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.100\nfollowed by the principles and\nthe processes of the life cycle phase.\n\n9\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550\nThen we'll take a look at organizing for\nthat life cycle phase.\n\n10\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.255\nAnd also the technology considerations,\n\n11\n00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:47.998\nespecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n12\n00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:52.421\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand critical success factors and\n\n13\n00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:56.999\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith that particular life cycle phase.\n\n14\n00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.778\nAnd most importantly, of course for\nyou, is that preparation for\n\n15\n00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:04.980\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class.\n\n16\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.497\nSo let me take a look now then at how\nwe're going to approach this particular\n\n17\n00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:11.869\nintermediate class.\n\n18\n00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work.\n\n19\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.280\nObviously, you're going to be watching us\non screen both myself and my colleagues.\n\n20\n00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.110\nAnd we're going to be taking you through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n21\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.300\nAnd then there are going to be some\ndiscussions and some exercises.\n\n22\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.720\nThat are going to be based\nprimarily in our chat rooms, and\n\n23\n00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.140\nalso in our forums as well.\n\n24\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.214\nAnd we're also available if you want\nundertake any of the assessments,\n\n25\n00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:45.568\nthen please feel free to come\nback to us through the forums.\n\n26\n00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:49.270\nAnd we will be able to help\nyou out in any way we can.\n\n27\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.950\nAlso provided in the course\nmaterial which is available for\n\n28\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.390\nyou to download are mock tests or\nexams, if you prefer to use that word.\n\n29\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.720\nAnd we will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you.\n\n30\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.540\nSo where are we then at\nITIL intermediate level.\n\n31\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.090\nWell you'll see in using Blooms Taxonomy\nthat we are actually at level 4 analyzing.\n\n32\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.390\nIn other words, we've done foundation\nlevel, we've done the remembering and\n\n33\n00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.470\nunderstanding of those\nconcepts within ITIL.\n\n34\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.198\nAnd we're actually moving through applying\nthose concepts to analyzing those\n\n35\n00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:28.911\nconcepts.\n\n36\n00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:33.325\nAnd being able to apply\nthe ITIL processes and\n\n37\n00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:39.957\nalso the concepts at a real world level,\nin a real world situation.\n\n38\n00:02:39.957 --> 00:02:42.590\nOkay, so where does ITIL come from then?\n\n39\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.080\nWell let me give you a little\nbit of a background.\n\n40\n00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.330\nIt's actually owned by\na company called Axelos.\n\n41\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.110\nAnd it was first published in\nthe mid 1980s by the UK government.\n\n42\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.020\nAnd the office of government commerce\nowned ITL for a very, very long time.\n\n43\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.509\nAnd we developed ITIL right\nthe way back from the 1980s.\n\n44\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:14.147\nThrough its version 2 in the mid 1990s\nto version 3 which was released in 2007.\n\n45\n00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:19.006\nAnd then there was an update\nto version 3 in 2011 which is\n\n46\n00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:22.450\nexactly where we are right now.\n\n47\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.660\nIt is copyright, it is trademark\nprotected, it's a framework for\n\n48\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.670\nmanaging services.\n\n49\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.960\nAnd as such it is a flexible framework,\n\n50\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.730\na framework that we would expect any\norganization to adopt as a framework.\n\n51\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.126\nBut they're to adapt it\nto suit your needs, okay?\n\n52\n00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:44.898\nITIL was born right\naway back in the 1990s,\n\n53\n00:03:44.898 --> 00:03:49.519\nout of a desire to be able to\ndemonstrate value for money and\n\n54\n00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.068\nefficiency for\nthe use of taxpayers money within the UK.\n\n55\n00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:58.650\nWay back in the 1980s these things\nstarted appearing on desks.\n\n56\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.002\nAnd quite frankly we didn't know\nhow to manage these in an unbiased,\n\n57\n00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:10.109\nin an impartial, and in an efficient and\neffective way and thus ITIL was born.\n\n58\n00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.661\nAnd ITIL was born from a group of\nindustry experts that went out into\n\n59\n00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:19.297\nthe big wide world and analyzed\nvarious organizations from various\n\n60\n00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:22.971\ndifferent industry sectors,\nnot just government.\n\n61\n00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:27.633\nBut we're talking finance,\nwe're talking retail, etc, and\n\n62\n00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:31.230\nthey came back with\na set of best practices.\n\n63\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.176\nBest practices that they\nobserved in the real world for\n\n64\n00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:40.488\nmanaging our IT services and\nthus we have ITIL.\n\n65\n00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:43.207\nAs I've already said we have\nhad subsequent revisions.\n\n66\n00:04:43.207 --> 00:04:46.787\nAnd now we are up to version 3, 2011.\n\n67\n00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:51.363\nSo we welcome the understanding that\n\n68\n00:04:51.363 --> 00:04:56.240\nwe have a life to every single service.\n\n69\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.298\nAnd we start off with\na concept in Service Strategy.\n\n70\n00:05:00.298 --> 00:05:05.080\nAnd there we take that concept and\nwe design it.\n\n71\n00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.890\nAnd then we develop it, and\nwe deploy it as a service into\n\n72\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.520\na live environment, which is where\nwe operate and where we maintain it.\n\n73\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.360\nAnd we continually seek to\nensure that we are aligned with\n\n74\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.230\nthe needs of the organization in CSI.\n\n75\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.040\nSo you're attending this class\nbecause you probably want\n\n76\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.040\nto achieve an ITIL\nintermediate qualification.\n\n77\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.509\nSo you can see that if we were to\nstart off right at the very, very top,\n\n78\n00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.011\nyou'll see where I am.\n\n79\n00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n80\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.491\nI'm also an accredited examiner and\nand the proctor or\n\n81\n00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:52.720\ninvigilator for these exams.\n\n82\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.320\nAnd work very, very closely with\nthe official ITIL accreditor and\n\n83\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.829\nalso AXELOS who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n84\n00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:06.492\nNow in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n85\n00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:10.045\nWell we start off with ITIL Foundation,\nand\n\n86\n00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:15.040\nITIL Foundation would traditionally\nbe a three day classroom\n\n87\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.050\nexperience where we learn\nthe foundations of ITIL.\n\n88\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.809\nWe learn all the terminology and all\nof the definitions to that terminology.\n\n89\n00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:28.900\nThere's roughly around about 75 that we\nlearn within the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n90\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.820\nAnd then as we move through, we can\neither take an ITIL practitioner class,\n\n91\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.710\nwhich can be taken at any point in time\n\n92\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.820\nthroughout the progression\nof your career within ITIL.\n\n93\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.330\nBecause ITIL practitioner focuses\non the implementation of ITIL.\n\n94\n00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.474\nOkay, whereas if we take a look\nat a more advanced intermediate\n\n95\n00:06:50.474 --> 00:06:54.851\nclasses you are at this\nmoment In a Lifecycle module.\n\n96\n00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:59.529\nAnd there is a Lifecycle modules consist\nof service strategy, service design,\n\n97\n00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:04.157\nservice transition, service operation and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n98\n00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:05.550\nAnd that's where we focus,\n\n99\n00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.330\non those Lifecycles that we've\njust looked at previously.\n\n100\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.308\nOkay, and on the right hand side\nthen we have our capability modules.\n\n101\n00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:19.515\nAnd these capability modules\nreally focus on specific\n\n102\n00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:27.450\nareas within ITIL such as off RCV which\nfocuses on release control and validation.\n\n103\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.115\nAnd these classes, you will notice that\nevery single one of these classes has\n\n104\n00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:34.430\ngot a score right beside each one.\n\n105\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.592\nSo we've got a number two for\nITIL Foundation, and we've got a three for\n\n106\n00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:44.510\nLifecycle modules and we've got a four for\nour capability modules.\n\n107\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.585\nNow what we need to do is\nensure that we have achieved\n\n108\n00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:54.779\na minimum of 15 credits at\nboth either life cycle,\n\n109\n00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:57.744\nor capability module level.\n\n110\n00:07:57.744 --> 00:08:03.043\nIn order to be able to qualify to sit\nthe managing across the Lifecycle class,\n\n111\n00:08:03.043 --> 00:08:08.665\nand therefore, subsequently,\nthe test that goes along with that class.\n\n112\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:12.797\nSo we need to take two from the ITIL\nFoundation, that's a prerequisite.\n\n113\n00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:17.823\nWe have to do the foundation, and\nthen we need to add in another 15 scores\n\n114\n00:08:17.823 --> 00:08:22.379\nfrom either as I've said the Lifecycle or\nthe capability stream.\n\n115\n00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.484\nNow you can interchange,\nyou can mix and match,\n\n116\n00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:29.100\nyou do not have to stick to one stream or\nthe other.\n\n117\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.215\nOnce you've got that 17 in total scores\n\n118\n00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:37.165\nthat are needed to be able to sit\nmanaging across the lifecycle.\n\n119\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:41.345\nYou're perfectly able to sit\nthat Lifecycle class and\n\n120\n00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.845\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n121\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.145\nAnd as soon as you've taken that test\nyou will be awarded those five credits\n\n122\n00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:52.535\nwhich will mean that you\nhave achieved ITIL expert.\n\n123\n00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:57.240\nNow ITIL expert is allocated\nas soon as you have passed\n\n124\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.510\nthe managing across the Lifecycle test and\nhave achieved 22 credits.\n\n125\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.160\nBoth of those must have happened for\nyou to achieve ITIL expert.\n\n126\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.741\nNow, we have the ITIL\nmaster qualification and\n\n127\n00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:14.279\nthe ITIL master is\na completely different beast.\n\n128\n00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:18.910\nThe ITIL master is a two\nyear qualification.\n\n129\n00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:24.579\nAnd during that two years,\nyou will be expected to submit various\n\n130\n00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:31.190\nwhite papers on specific topics,\nwithin the ITIL qualifications scheme.\n\n131\n00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.870\nSo these could be topics\non activities within ITIL.\n\n132\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.830\nThese could be topics of\nprocesses within ITIL.\n\n133\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.810\nThese could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n134\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.860\nBut you will be required to sit\na number of white papers, or\n\n135\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.410\nsubmit a number of white papers\nover the period of two years.\n\n136\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.535\nAt the end of those two years,\nonce you have submitted the prerequisite\n\n137\n00:09:56.535 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers, then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n138\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.427\nAnd during that panel interview, you\nwill be assessed not only on your white\n\n139\n00:10:06.427 --> 00:10:11.611\npapers but also on your experience\nwithin the IT service management arena.\n\n140\n00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.514\nAnd at the end of that panel\ninterview then if successful,\n\n141\n00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:18.630\nyou will be awarded\nthe status of ITIL master.\n\n142\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.816\nSo the qualification scheme,\n\n143\n00:10:21.816 --> 00:10:25.067\nI'm going to take this back\nnow to blooms taxonomy then.\n\n144\n00:10:25.067 --> 00:10:28.877\nAnd just very, very quickly look at\nthe fact that an ITIL Foundation and\n\n145\n00:10:28.877 --> 00:10:32.069\nI know that I've already covered\nthis in a previous slide.\n\n146\n00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:36.679\nThat we just looked at understanding,\nunderstanding the terminology and\n\n147\n00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:39.150\nthe concepts of ITIL Foundation.\n\n148\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.169\nAnd then in the life cycle modules,\n\n149\n00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:45.358\nwe're looking at implementing those\nprocesses contained within ITIL.\n\n150\n00:10:45.358 --> 00:10:50.617\nAnd in capability, we're looking\nat actually those processes and\n\n151\n00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:52.838\nmanaging those processes.\n\n152\n00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:57.658\nWhereas managing across the life cycle,\nthis is for senior management.\n\n153\n00:10:57.658 --> 00:11:02.406\nThis is at CIO level and\nat senior management level, and\n\n154\n00:11:02.406 --> 00:11:05.437\nMALC as we like to abbreviate it to,\n\n155\n00:11:05.437 --> 00:11:10.475\nyour concern with leading\nIT service management.\n\n156\n00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:14.875\nSo I mentioned, right at the very\nbeginning of all of this,\n\n157\n00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:20.507\nthat we had a test to go along with every\nsingle life cycle phase and there is.\n\n158\n00:11:20.507 --> 00:11:25.621\nAnd we will be conducting a session to\ngo all over this particular test or\n\n159\n00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:30.310\nat least a sample of this test just\nto give you some preparation for\n\n160\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.960\nthe actual test itself.\n\n161\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.892\nSo your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually.\n\n162\n00:11:38.892 --> 00:11:43.810\nIt is an eight multiple\nchoice question test.\n\n163\n00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.390\nIt's complex multiple choice.\n\n164\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.440\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test, and\n\n165\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.500\nwith every single question.\n\n166\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:58.270\nYou will be given a scenario, and then\nyou will be given four possible options,\n\n167\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.680\nfour possible answers for the question\nthat is posed along with that scenario.\n\n168\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.805\nGet five points for the best fit answer.\n\n169\n00:12:07.805 --> 00:12:10.140\nNow it mentions up there the most correct.\n\n170\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.287\nI always call it the best fit,\nbecause every single question asks,\n\n171\n00:12:14.287 --> 00:12:19.300\nwhat is the best answer given\nthe scenario, and given the question.\n\n172\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.350\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct,\n\n173\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.380\nbecause the question is asking you for\nthe best fit.\n\n174\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.990\nAnd for that best fit,\nyou're gonna get 5 points.\n\n175\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.000\nFor the next best fit,\nyou're going to get 3.\n\n176\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.674\nFor the next one, which we consider to be\nthe least correct, you're gonna get 1.\n\n177\n00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:44.940\nAnd for the next one,\nyou're gonna get a 0.\n\n178\n00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.712\nNow, it mentions up on that slide there\nthe next one is 0 marks for incorrect.\n\n179\n00:12:50.712 --> 00:12:56.490\nWe like to call that in the industry, us\nin the know, we call that the distractor.\n\n180\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.600\nAnd we call that the distractor for\na reason, cuz it distracts.\n\n181\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.103\nAnd quite often what you will\nfind is with your distractor.\n\n182\n00:13:04.103 --> 00:13:09.287\nA lot of the words in the terminology that\nare taken straight out of the ITIL book,\n\n183\n00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:14.168\nstraight out of the publication and\nare input into that zero pointer because\n\n184\n00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:17.081\nit's there to distract and\nit sounds great.\n\n185\n00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:22.111\nBut more often than not,\nthat distractor has absolutely\n\n186\n00:13:22.111 --> 00:13:26.600\nno relevance to the scenario or\nto the question.\n\n187\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.390\nSo you have to be incredibly\ncareful with that.\n\n188\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.322\nIt's so easy to be distracted,\nyou have to get 28\n\n189\n00:13:34.322 --> 00:13:39.138\nout of a possible 40 in\norder to be able to pass and\n\n190\n00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:44.432\nachieve accreditation at\nany Lifecycle test, okay?\n\n191\n00:13:44.432 --> 00:13:48.339\nIf English is not your first language\nyou are allowed a paper dictionary.\n\n192\n00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:53.315\nBut you will be asked to show that\nto the proctor at the time that\n\n193\n00:13:53.315 --> 00:13:55.650\nyou take your test.\n\n194\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.844\nAnd as I've already said, you have to have\n\n195\n00:13:59.844 --> 00:14:05.439\nan ITIL Foundation in version 3 or\nversion 3 2011 or\n\n196\n00:14:05.439 --> 00:14:10.579\nan ITIL version 2 Foundation\nbridge to version 3.\n\n197\n00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:12.628\nI will be very, very honest with you.\n\n198\n00:14:12.628 --> 00:14:17.546\nThere are not that many people that\nhave attained the version 2 to version\n\n199\n00:14:17.546 --> 00:14:18.348\n3 bridge.\n\n200\n00:14:18.348 --> 00:14:22.278\nAnd most people will have the version 3 or\n\n201\n00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:27.230\n2011, sorry, ITIL Foundation certificate.\n\n202\n00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.385\nYou will be required to upload\nthat certificate to the examining\n\n203\n00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:38.430\nboard prior to sitting your Lifecycle\ntest, so be prepared with that.\n\n204\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.590\nYou will need to have it to hand and\nsaved as a PDF as well.\n\n205\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:51.760\nSo when we come to the end of every single\nlife cycle class, we will be going over,\n\n206\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.410\nand this one's no exception,\nwe'll be going over a sample test for you.\n\n207\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.535\nAnd during that sample test,\nI'll be giving you lots of hints and\n\n208\n00:15:00.535 --> 00:15:03.841\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n209\n00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:08.090\nAnd also how to ensure that you read\nthe full question, how to relax.\n\n210\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.737\nAnd to make sure that you\napproach it with an open mind,\n\n211\n00:15:12.737 --> 00:15:17.200\nbut you consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n212\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.680\nUltimately we want to get you past\nthe test just as much as you want to\n\n213\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.760\nachieve that accreditation.\n\n214\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.993\nSo just to sum up,\nwhat we will be doing over the next few\n\n215\n00:15:29.993 --> 00:15:37.108\nshows is encouraging you to take your\nITIL Lifecycle intermediate classes.\n\n216\n00:15:37.108 --> 00:15:42.718\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n217\n00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:45.954\n[NOISE]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:15.610\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.870\nYou're watching\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation.\n\n5\n00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.350\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.020\nAnd today, we're jumping right into it\nwith our subject matter expert, Ms.\n\n7\n00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.900\nJo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.160\nJo, welcome to our studios.\n\n9\n00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.310\nHow are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.550\n&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm doing fine.\n\n11\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.490\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.879\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo, as we begin this idea\nof service operation, not operations,\n\n13\n00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.890\nservice operation, what are we\nreally going to be taking a look at?\n\n14\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.810\nHow do we get started here?\n\n15\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Well in this very first episode\nwhat we're going to be looking at is\n\n16\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.340\njust very much the purpose\nof service operation.\n\n17\n00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.500\nService operation being our\nfourth life cycle phase\n\n18\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.146\nas we go through the life\nof our services within IT.\n\n19\n00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:56.310\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n20\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.170\nSo Jo, as we take a look at some of these,\n\n21\n00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.930\nare we going to learning\nabout terminology?\n\n22\n00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.030\nIs there more that\n\n23\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.210\nwe're going to be covering than\njust this introductory episode?\n\n24\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.850\n&gt;&gt; No, we're going to do a very\nvery brief recap from foundation.\n\n25\n00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.340\nFrom the foundation material where\nwe looked at the purpose of every\n\n26\n00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.900\nlifecycle phase.\n\n27\n00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.970\nSo in this particular section here,\nwe're just going to do a very brief recap.\n\n28\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.065\nWe're not learning any new technology,\nnew terminology, I'm sorry.\n\n29\n00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:25.440\n[LAUGH] We're not covering\nany technology either.\n\n30\n00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But we're not\n\n31\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.820\nlearning any new terminology here.\n\n32\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.798\nWhat we're going to be doing\nthroughout this entire class in fact,\n\n33\n00:01:30.798 --> 00:01:34.860\nis expand it on everything that\nwe've covered in foundation and\n\n34\n00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.330\nwe're going to be analyzing everything\nthat we learned in the foundation class.\n\n35\n00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.460\n&gt;&gt; All right, it sounds great.\n\n36\n00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.740\nSounds like an exciting opportunity for\nall of us.\n\n37\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.220\nSo where are we gonna get started, Jo?\n\n38\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, first place to start is\non designing what service operation is.\n\n39\n00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.700\nAnd that's exactly what\nwe're gonna be doing.\n\n40\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.850\nSo let's start out by taking a look\nat the purpose of service operation.\n\n41\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.510\nSo, you have the course\nmaterial available to you.\n\n42\n00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.220\nAnd the first thing that I want you to, or\n\n43\n00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.400\nwant to draw your attention to is\nthe purpose of service operation.\n\n44\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.690\nNow, I'm not gonna read\nthrough these slides for you,\n\n45\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.750\nyou're perfectly capable of doing that.\n\n46\n00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.970\nWhat I'm gonna do is add some context to\nthis and what you can see straight away\n\n47\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.970\nwhen you look at this in the blue box in\nfront of you, what you can see immediately\n\n48\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.190\nis that we're talking about business\nas usual, nothing more than that.\n\n49\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.900\nThis is about carrying out\nall of the activities and\n\n50\n00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.040\nthose on dependent processes that\nare required to simply deliver and\n\n51\n00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.270\nmanage the services at agreed levels.\n\n52\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.560\nAgreed levels, where are these agreed?\n\n53\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.670\nWell, they're in the service level\nagreement documents, of course.\n\n54\n00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.730\nSo we're delivering these services\nto provide value to our business and\n\n55\n00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.729\nto our organization.\n\n56\n00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.750\nSo what we have to do then if we're\ntalking about providing value to our\n\n57\n00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.040\nbusiness and\nwe have to keep them happy obviously and\n\n58\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.720\nin fact what we really have to do\nis maintain business satisfactions.\n\n59\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.070\nWe've got to ensure that w are delivering\nvalue to the organization,\n\n60\n00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.642\nthat value being perceived.\n\n61\n00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:12.620\nAnd so, if you think about this logically,\nwe all have a different concept of value.\n\n62\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.700\nWhat you value,\n\n63\n00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.690\nwhat you value is completely\ndifferent to what I might value.\n\n64\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.960\nSo that's a challenge in itself.\n\n65\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.670\nSo we're talking about\nkeeping the business running.\n\n66\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.730\nWe're talking about minimizing\nthe impact of any outages.\n\n67\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.915\nAnd we're also referring to ensuring\nthat everybody does have access\n\n68\n00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:37.175\nto our services that should have access\nto our services and at the same time\n\n69\n00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:43.195\nstopping those that shouldn't have access\nto our services from having that access.\n\n70\n00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:44.945\nSo that's what service operation is about.\n\n71\n00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:49.785\nAnd the service operation class,\nthat we're going to be looking at over\n\n72\n00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:55.640\nthe next few modules,\nthis focuses on all of the processes,\n\n73\n00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.005\nall of the functional areas and\nthe tools that under paying\n\n74\n00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:04.950\nthis ability to deliver up\nservices at agreed levels.\n\n75\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.220\nSo we have some explanations here\nunderneath in bullet points.\n\n76\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.340\nYou'll see that we have services, and\n\n77\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.460\na service is,\nif you remember from foundation.\n\n78\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.950\nA means of delivering value by\nfacilitating the outcomes that customers\n\n79\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.570\nwant to achieve without the ownership\nof specific costs and risks.\n\n80\n00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.740\nRisks.\nLet me put that into plain and\n\n81\n00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.792\nsimple English for you.\n\n82\n00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:26.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] better.\n\n83\n00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.210\n&gt;&gt; What that actually means is that\nwhat we will be doing is we will\n\n84\n00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.085\nbe providing an ability.\n\n85\n00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:33.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n86\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.790\n&gt;&gt; We're going to give you the ability\nto send and receive email, for instance.\n\n87\n00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.050\nWe are not going to send and\nreceive that email for you.\n\n88\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.930\nAfter all, you know what you want\nto type when you send an email.\n\n89\n00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.660\nI don't know what you want to\ntype when you send and email.\n\n90\n00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.650\nSo, I'm gonna give you the ability to\nsend and receive any emails, but I'm not\n\n91\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.780\ngoing to actually do it for you, which is\nwhy we talk about facilitating outcomes.\n\n92\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.960\nNow, in order for me to do that, I have\nto be organized in a way that I work and\n\n93\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.510\nthis is where our service management\nprocesses come into this.\n\n94\n00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.700\nBecause we have to make sure that we're\norganized in delivering that ability.\n\n95\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.245\nIf we're not organized, then we\ncan't deliver an ability very well.\n\n96\n00:05:16.245 --> 00:05:20.595\nAnd certainly, if you think about the two\ntenets of ITIL, which are efficiency and\n\n97\n00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:24.245\neffectiveness, I need to be able\nto deliver these services is\n\n98\n00:05:24.245 --> 00:05:28.685\na business-as-usual environment\nefficiently and effectively,\n\n99\n00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:31.665\nwith minimal disruption to service.\n\n100\n00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:35.325\nSo I need to have some processes\nthat underpin these services,\n\n101\n00:05:35.325 --> 00:05:37.790\nto enable me to do that.\n\n102\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.610\nOf course there's technology involved.\n\n103\n00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.030\nThere has to be technology involved,\nbecause let's face it,\n\n104\n00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.850\nwe're delivering IT services.\n\n105\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.920\nBut we also have to have tools\nthat underpin these services too.\n\n106\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.050\nAnd then, lets not forget the people.\n\n107\n00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.520\nThe most important element\nof service delivery.\n\n108\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.150\nWithout the people, without the skills,\nand without their ability to manage those\n\n109\n00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.992\nservices we simply would\nnot have a service.\n\n110\n00:06:00.992 --> 00:06:04.285\nSo I have already talked about value.\n\n111\n00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:09.750\nI've already talked about\nthe fact that value is perceived.\n\n112\n00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.456\nAnd so, we have to ensure that we can\ndeliver value to the business and\n\n113\n00:06:14.456 --> 00:06:18.990\nin an ever changing world,\na very fastly changing world.\n\n114\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.327\nIs that a word, fastly?\n\n115\n00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:21.527\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyway,\n\n116\n00:06:21.527 --> 00:06:24.220\nin rapidly changing world,\nthat sounds better.\n\n117\n00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.690\nI can't speak English, it's the.\n\n118\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.000\nIn this rapidly changing world we\nhave to be able to deliver value,\n\n119\n00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.540\nin a continual way because value changes.\n\n120\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.480\nThink about that cellphone that\nyou bought last year for instance.\n\n121\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.200\nThat cellphone you bought last year, you\nbought it because it was the latest thing.\n\n122\n00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.660\nIt had all the functionality\nthat you needed and\n\n123\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.620\nit did everything that you wanted to do\nand I bet you even thought it would make\n\n124\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.780\nyou a cup of coffee on a morning\nwhen you got out of bed.\n\n125\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.390\nYeah, but unfortunately it doesn't.\n\n126\n00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.010\nAnd since you bought that cell phone,\n\n127\n00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.670\nsomebody else has brought out another one\nthat actually does a little bit more.\n\n128\n00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.490\nSo your valued perception of that\ncell phone has now diminished,\n\n129\n00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.930\nover a very short period of time.\n\n130\n00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.120\nAnd you know what?\nIt hasn't changed.\n\n131\n00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.170\nIt still delivers that say,\nability to make and\n\n132\n00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.390\nreceive that phone call but,\nyou don't value it as much.\n\n133\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.100\nSo, what we have to do is we have to\nensure that we can deliver value in\n\n134\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.050\nan ongoing way.\n\n135\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.450\nSo we talked about meeting the goals and\nobjectives of an organization in relation\n\n136\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.820\nto security,\nin relation to facilitating that outcome.\n\n137\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.180\nWe talked about providing access to those\nservices in a way that delivers value and\n\n138\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.700\nthat doesn't hinder because let's face it,\nsometimes we don't always get the access\n\n139\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.330\nthat we need or the functionality that\nwe need the minute that we want it.\n\n140\n00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.618\nWe like to talk about\nautomated operations and\n\n141\n00:07:53.618 --> 00:07:56.931\nwe like to do things as\nefficiently as we possibly can.\n\n142\n00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:03.963\nBut we have to consider that automation,\nwherever we utilize automation has to be.\n\n143\n00:08:03.963 --> 00:08:05.856\nWhere appropriate.\n\n144\n00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:09.548\nYou don't just automate something\nbecause it seems like a good idea.\n\n145\n00:08:09.548 --> 00:08:13.329\nAfter all, you're only going\nto get to that result quicker.\n\n146\n00:08:13.329 --> 00:08:16.726\nAnd if that result is a bad result\nbecause you've actually scoped\n\n147\n00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:21.256\nout the process inefficiently yourself,\nthen you're just gonna get there quicker.\n\n148\n00:08:21.256 --> 00:08:22.880\nIt's still gonna be a bad result.\n\n149\n00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.250\nSo what we have to do is assure\nthat we deliver that value.\n\n150\n00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.380\nAnd that first bullet point that you\nsee on the slides in front of you that\n\n151\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.830\ntalks about difficulty in maintaining\nthat expected return on investment.\n\n152\n00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.010\nWhen we talk about return,\n\n153\n00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.490\nwe don't just talk about financial return,\nwe talk about value return.\n\n154\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:50.140\nSo things that aren't necessarily\ndemonstrable in a financial sense.\n\n155\n00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.050\nThink about that cell phone again.\n\n156\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.080\nReally once you've spent\nthe money on that,\n\n157\n00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.460\nyou don't care about how much that's\nactually physically cost you at the time.\n\n158\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.210\nThe money's been spent.\n\n159\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.950\nWhat you want to be able\nto do is to send and\n\n160\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:07.680\nreceive emails and to send and\nreceive texts and to make phone calls.\n\n161\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.850\nAnd if that phone let's you down, or if\nyou find a phone that can do it a little\n\n162\n00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.320\nbit better,\nthen your value perception has changed.\n\n163\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:21.470\nSo you're no longer maintaining a value on\nan investment on that particular phone.\n\n164\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.770\nIt's that value perception and\nthe diminishment of that value perception,\n\n165\n00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.390\nthat actually makes it hard to\nmaintain funding for changes.\n\n166\n00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.630\nBecause nowadays,\nwe're all familiar with technology.\n\n167\n00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.520\nThere's nobody in this world that's\nnot familiar with technology.\n\n168\n00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.910\nAnd so, we all know better.\n\n169\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.550\nWe all know what's available\nin the market space.\n\n170\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.860\nAnd how many times has our\norganization come to us and said, but\n\n171\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.500\nwhy can't we do it like this?\n\n172\n00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.680\nBecause I've seen this commercial\non TV and that's available.\n\n173\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.110\nWhy can't I do it like this?\n\n174\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.622\nAnd so, our organization\nperceives value in one way.\n\n175\n00:09:56.622 --> 00:09:59.399\nWe perceive value delivery in another way.\n\n176\n00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:04.333\nAnd it's that inability to articulate\nwhat value really means that can make it\n\n177\n00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:06.960\nvery difficult for us to obtain funding.\n\n178\n00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.640\nAnd that means funding not just for the\nservices themselves, but also funding for\n\n179\n00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.460\nthe tools that we use in IT to\nsupport those services, too.\n\n180\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:25.000\nSo what we're looking for over a period of\ntime, as we are delivering these services,\n\n181\n00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.350\nis that we are looking for incremental,\niterative, step by step, improvement.\n\n182\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.130\nBecause as we've already said,\nvalue diminishes over time.\n\n183\n00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.666\nAnd value diminishes very, very, quickly.\n\n184\n00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:41.865\nSo we're going to be,\non an ongoing iterative basis,\n\n185\n00:10:41.865 --> 00:10:46.540\nchecking the performance of\nthese services that we supply.\n\n186\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.729\nWe're going to be ensuring that the\nservices are not only working as per those\n\n187\n00:10:50.729 --> 00:10:52.276\nservice level agreements,\n\n188\n00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:55.253\nthat we mentioned right away\nback on that first slide.\n\n189\n00:10:55.253 --> 00:10:59.485\nBut we're also going to be making\nsure that those services continue\n\n190\n00:10:59.485 --> 00:11:03.740\nto deliver value,\nunderstanding the value changes.\n\n191\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.540\nSo when we talk about improvements,\n\n192\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.610\nwe could be talking about\nimprovement to service availability.\n\n193\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.950\nWe could be talking about improvements\nto the uptime of a service, but we also\n\n194\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:20.060\ncould be talking about improvements by\nadding in new functionality to a service.\n\n195\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.370\nAnd that's what we would call a long\nterm incremental improvement,\n\n196\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.810\nsomething that's looking to the future.\n\n197\n00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.690\nWe also have short term improvements\nthat we can make on a regular basis,\n\n198\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.010\nwhich could be something as simple\nas maybe changing the hours of\n\n199\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.616\nthe service desk work.\n\n200\n00:11:38.616 --> 00:11:41.858\nWe get a peak on Monday mornings at 9 AM,\nand\n\n201\n00:11:41.858 --> 00:11:47.400\nthe service desk staff don't start\nuntil 9:30 AM on Monday morning.\n\n202\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.061\nWell, in that case then,\n\n203\n00:11:49.061 --> 00:11:54.357\nwe made need to change those hours because\nwe need to deliver value to the business.\n\n204\n00:11:54.357 --> 00:11:57.928\nSo short term improvements,\nthey're not just one off.\n\n205\n00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:01.139\nIt's not something that we do,\nit's something that we do and\n\n206\n00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:05.603\nthen we check that it's worked, and then\nwe'll look to do something else, as well.\n\n207\n00:12:05.603 --> 00:12:08.930\nWe're looking to maintain momentum.\n\n208\n00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.320\nInitially, we have to build it,\nbut we have to maintain that.\n\n209\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.650\nWe don't want to change\nthe fundamental nature of any service,\n\n210\n00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.630\nwe don't want to change who we are, but\n\n211\n00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.400\nlet's face it, we all know when we're\nbeing a little bit disorganized.\n\n212\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.395\nWe all know when we're putting\noff that one task that we really,\n\n213\n00:12:25.395 --> 00:12:26.619\nreally don't want to do.\n\n214\n00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:31.494\nAnd so, that's the idea of\nthe short term ongoing intuitive\n\n215\n00:12:31.494 --> 00:12:35.040\nimprovements is the ongoing improvement.\n\n216\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.557\nThose small things that we\nknow it is that we can do.\n\n217\n00:12:39.557 --> 00:12:42.004\nSo what we're going to be looking at,\n\n218\n00:12:42.004 --> 00:12:46.216\nthe first five bullet points over\nthe service operation course.\n\n219\n00:12:46.216 --> 00:12:52.272\nThe first five bullet points are the five\nprocesses within service operation.\n\n220\n00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:55.169\nAnd we're going to be looking\nat event management, and\n\n221\n00:12:55.169 --> 00:12:58.692\nwe're also going to covering\nmonitoring as part of that, as well.\n\n222\n00:12:58.692 --> 00:13:02.631\nWe're going to be looking at incident\nmanagement and problem management.\n\n223\n00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:06.995\nWe're going to be looking at request\nfulfillment which you could perceive to be\n\n224\n00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:11.879\na huge big misnomer, because it's not just\nabout fulfilling requests, it's actually\n\n225\n00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:16.640\nabout managing requests or dealing\nwith requests as in the ITIL books.\n\n226\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.900\nAnd then, we're going to be\nlooking at access management,\n\n227\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.930\nwhich is about giving access and\ntaking access away also.\n\n228\n00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:28.910\nAnd then, we're going to look at the four\nfunctions, or four functional areas,\n\n229\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:33.990\nas I like to call them, within service\noperation, within the business as usual.\n\n230\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.160\nThat's the Service Desk, that's the fairly\nobvious one that we can all relate to and\n\n231\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.480\nwe've all heard of.\n\n232\n00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.710\nAnd then we've got our\ntechnical management guys.\n\n233\n00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.134\nAnd these are the people that\nlook at our infrastructure.\n\n234\n00:13:44.134 --> 00:13:48.082\nAnd all the teams and the tools and\nthe skills that they have to deal with our\n\n235\n00:13:48.082 --> 00:13:51.570\nnetworks and our infrastructure and\nour service.\n\n236\n00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.130\nWe've got operations management.\n\n237\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.610\nAnd they do all of our batch jobs,\nthey do our backups,\n\n238\n00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.470\nthey do our restores,\nthey do our print scheduling.\n\n239\n00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.590\nAnd they also have facilities management,\n\n240\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.940\nas part of that particular\nfunctional area, too.\n\n241\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.401\nAnd that's the group that look after our\ndata centers, look after our disaster\n\n242\n00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:14.728\nrecovery sites, or our service continuity\nsites as we like to call them, and\n\n243\n00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:16.407\nlook after our backup tapes.\n\n244\n00:14:16.407 --> 00:14:18.637\nAnd then we've got our applications guys,\nand\n\n245\n00:14:18.637 --> 00:14:21.158\nthese are the guys that do\nApplications Management.\n\n246\n00:14:21.158 --> 00:14:24.925\nAnd they do, where necessary,\nthe development and\n\n247\n00:14:24.925 --> 00:14:28.271\nthe support of all of our applications,\ntoo.\n\n248\n00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:33.063\nSo this first bullet point in front of you\nnow then, I've already mentioned this one,\n\n249\n00:14:33.063 --> 00:14:36.293\nand I know that it rolls off\nthe tongue fairly easily to me.\n\n250\n00:14:36.293 --> 00:14:37.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n251\n00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:43.306\nI don't expect it to do that to you and\ndon't worry, you don't need to.\n\n252\n00:14:43.306 --> 00:14:47.910\nBut what you have to understand\nis the concept of a service.\n\n253\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.780\nI've already said,\nit's not about delivery and outcome.\n\n254\n00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.608\nWe're not going to send that email for\nyou, because we don't know what's in your\n\n255\n00:14:54.608 --> 00:14:57.950\nhead, we might be great people,\ncuz I mean let's face it, we're IT.\n\n256\n00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.630\nWe know everything.\n\n257\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.890\nBut we don't know what's in your head.\n\n258\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.080\nWe don't know what you want to say.\n\n259\n00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.410\nSo what we have to do is\nfacilitate that outcome.\n\n260\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.433\nAnd that's where we talk\nabout delivering value,\n\n261\n00:15:11.433 --> 00:15:16.920\nbecause you know what you want to send and\nyou now how you want to type that email.\n\n262\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.057\nYou know how you want to present it, or\nhow you want to attack that picture or\n\n263\n00:15:21.057 --> 00:15:25.194\nthat photograph, whether you want it\nin the body of the email or whether you\n\n264\n00:15:25.194 --> 00:15:29.945\nwant it as an attachment, I don't know any\nof these things, you know what you value.\n\n265\n00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:35.260\nBut then it goes on to say without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n266\n00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.430\nLet's think about that for a moment.\n\n267\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.470\nA specific cost of a laptop, we all know.\n\n268\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.618\nA laptop can cost us, let's say $1,000.\n\n269\n00:15:44.618 --> 00:15:47.740\nBut what about specific costs and risks?\n\n270\n00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.944\nIf we're talking about just one service,\n\n271\n00:15:50.944 --> 00:15:56.640\nthe specific cost of email to a person,\nwell, we have to take that laptop and\n\n272\n00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.621\nthen we have to divide it by the number of\nother services that are on that laptop.\n\n273\n00:16:02.621 --> 00:16:06.848\nSome might say they're using\nMicrosoft Office, they say they're using,\n\n274\n00:16:06.848 --> 00:16:09.237\nI don't know, maybe SAP, for instance.\n\n275\n00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:11.901\nMaybe they've got 20 services.\n\n276\n00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:17.030\nSo, the cost of email then,\nis one 20th of that laptop.\n\n277\n00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.260\nOkay, that's just the hardware.\n\n278\n00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.110\nThen we've got the license fee.\n\n279\n00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.880\nAnd then what about the portion\nof the infrastructure as well,\n\n280\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.740\nthat they're using just for email?\n\n281\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.436\nSo, the portion of\nthe infrastructure is one 20th\n\n282\n00:16:30.436 --> 00:16:33.461\nof the infrastructure to that PC, right?\n\n283\n00:16:33.461 --> 00:16:37.780\nWell, let's take that up a level, and then\nlet's look at say router level for that.\n\n284\n00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.761\nAnd how many PCs have\nwe got on the router?\n\n285\n00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:42.690\nIt gets complicated.\n\n286\n00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:46.750\nSo, why are we going to transfer\nspecific costs to our customers?\n\n287\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.076\nIt's gonna take us more than investment\nto work out those specific costs,\n\n288\n00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:54.040\nthan what we're going\nbe able to recoup back.\n\n289\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.390\nSo, of course we're mot\ngonna transfer those.\n\n290\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.550\nAnd the risks?\n\n291\n00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:01.890\nI don't expect our customers to\nknow anything about the cabling.\n\n292\n00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.490\nI don't expect them to know anything\nabout how it all hangs together.\n\n293\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.860\nSo, why on earth would I want to\ntransfer those risks to our customers?\n\n294\n00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.044\nWe're supposed to be delivering value.\n\n295\n00:17:12.044 --> 00:17:13.890\nWe're not supposed to be\ndelivering a headache.\n\n296\n00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.310\nWe're supposed to be delivering value.\n\n297\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:21.210\nThe idea is, that we are supposed to be\nimproving the performance of our business\n\n298\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.960\nby reducing the constraints.\n\n299\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.054\nNow, reducing the constraints\nmeans analyzing those risks, and\n\n300\n00:17:27.054 --> 00:17:28.887\nwe'll take ownership of those risks.\n\n301\n00:17:28.887 --> 00:17:32.988\nReducing the constraints means giving\npeople access that need to have access.\n\n302\n00:17:32.988 --> 00:17:36.841\nBut removing those that don't\nneed to have access, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:39.721\nThe idea is that we want to.\n\n304\n00:17:39.721 --> 00:17:43.050\nIt says there,\nincrease probability of desired outcomes.\n\n305\n00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:48.512\nBut we want to ensure that every time\nyou go to send an email, it sends.\n\n306\n00:17:48.512 --> 00:17:52.937\nAnd every time you open up your laptop,\nyour emails are downloaded and\n\n307\n00:17:52.937 --> 00:17:55.200\nyou receive your emails.\n\n308\n00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.690\nThat's what increased probability means.\n\n309\n00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:02.090\nWe don't want you to have any doubts\nthat when you open up your laptop,\n\n310\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.830\nthat you're going to receive that email.\n\n311\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.441\nI want you to open up that laptop and\n\n312\n00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:08.840\nknow that you're emails\nare going to be received.\n\n313\n00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.245\nI want you to hit send and\n\n314\n00:18:10.245 --> 00:18:13.418\nknow that you're going to\nbe able to send that email.\n\n315\n00:18:13.418 --> 00:18:15.040\nAnd that it's going to go through.\n\n316\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.450\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, before we move on to\nwhat we're about to see here.\n\n317\n00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.829\nUnder service,\nis there in ITIL that we're talking about.\n\n318\n00:18:24.829 --> 00:18:29.243\nDoes it distinguish between something\nlike just outsourcing that,\n\n319\n00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:31.993\nusing a service provider to provide that?\n\n320\n00:18:31.993 --> 00:18:35.349\nVersus what's an internal resource for\nus to do this?\n\n321\n00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:40.340\nOr, regardless of which side you're on,\nyou're still providing the same service?\n\n322\n00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.980\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, I'm glad you asked that.\n\n323\n00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.940\nWe have in service strategy,\nin the first life cycle phase,\n\n324\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.950\nwe look at the types of service\nprovider that there are.\n\n325\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.600\nNow, whether they be\ninternal service provider so\n\n326\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.186\nthat somebody internal to the business\nunit, to the organization.\n\n327\n00:18:56.186 --> 00:19:00.258\nOr whether we have a shed\nservice service provider.\n\n328\n00:19:00.258 --> 00:19:04.822\nWhich is a service provider within\nthe organization still, but\n\n329\n00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:08.850\nthat supports services\nacross all business units.\n\n330\n00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.870\nOr we have external service providers.\n\n331\n00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.950\nAnd external service providers come\nin many different shapes and forms.\n\n332\n00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:19.070\nThey could be a service provider\nthat provides the whole of IT.\n\n333\n00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.520\nOr they could be a service provider\nthat provides just one portion.\n\n334\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.560\nAnd you can have many\nexternal service providers.\n\n335\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.870\nSo, in service strategy,\n\n336\n00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.920\nwe look at the concept of different\ntypes of service provider.\n\n337\n00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.729\nAnd in service design, we make\nthe decisions as to what type of service\n\n338\n00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:39.983\nprovider we're going to utilize\nas we bring in new services.\n\n339\n00:19:39.983 --> 00:19:43.610\nAnd as we look to provide\nvalue to the business.\n\n340\n00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.690\nSo, what we're looking at\nhere in service operation,\n\n341\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.490\nis what we need to\ndeliver to the business.\n\n342\n00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.960\nWhat we need for business as usual.\n\n343\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.595\nSo, we step outside of the boundaries\nof the service provider types.\n\n344\n00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:59.100\nAnd we just look at\nproviding that service.\n\n345\n00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.982\nAnd it doesn't matter whether it\nis internal service provider, or\n\n346\n00:20:02.982 --> 00:20:05.032\nmany external service providers.\n\n347\n00:20:05.032 --> 00:20:07.100\nThey still need all of these elements.\n\n348\n00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; These processes need to be in place.\n\n349\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.470\nThese skills need to be present.\n\n350\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.070\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n351\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.861\n&gt;&gt; So, the slide that we have just coming\nup right now, that we had on the screen.\n\n352\n00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:21.699\nYou'll see the functional areas that\nwe had within, or that we have.\n\n353\n00:20:21.699 --> 00:20:25.990\nSo, within IT operations,\nthese need to exist.\n\n354\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.040\nWhether you are using\nan external service provider, or\n\n355\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.360\nwhether you're using an internal service\nprovider, or a combination of both.\n\n356\n00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.962\nThese functional areas and\nthese skills need to exist.\n\n357\n00:20:37.962 --> 00:20:41.197\nAnd, as I've said, we've already gone\nall over these very, very briefly.\n\n358\n00:20:41.197 --> 00:20:44.779\nAnd we're going to go in more into\ndepth in these, in other modules.\n\n359\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.946\nSo, I mentioned functional areas.\n\n360\n00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:52.871\nAnd that last slide actually looked\nat the four functional areas\n\n361\n00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:54.520\nthat we have in ITIL.\n\n362\n00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.324\nAnd a function is simply,\nthis is just from our ITIL foundation.\n\n363\n00:20:58.324 --> 00:21:01.276\nIt's simply a team, or\na group of people, and\n\n364\n00:21:01.276 --> 00:21:04.930\nthe tools that they use\nto carry out processes.\n\n365\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.430\nProcesses are what they do,\nthe set of activities.\n\n366\n00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.780\nFunctional areas are the people\nthat actually do them.\n\n367\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.301\nThey're described as\na self-contained of an organization.\n\n368\n00:21:15.301 --> 00:21:19.433\nNow we don't tell you\nhow to organize your IT.\n\n369\n00:21:19.433 --> 00:21:21.690\nWe can't, let's face it.\n\n370\n00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.950\nSo, this is why I like to refer\nto the misfunctional areas,\n\n371\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.900\nas opposed to just functions themselves.\n\n372\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.710\nThere is a tendency for\npeople who just read the ITIL\n\n373\n00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.820\nbooks to look at these and say, hey look,\nITIL's given us an organizational chart.\n\n374\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.736\nWell, we're not.\n\n375\n00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:40.963\nWe're just telling you that,\nyou know what?\n\n376\n00:21:40.963 --> 00:21:44.535\nIf you're going to deliver services,\nwhether you're an external service\n\n377\n00:21:44.535 --> 00:21:47.990\nprovider or internal,\nyou need people to manage your network.\n\n378\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.350\nSo, we're gonna call\nthem technical people.\n\n379\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.070\nYou need people to manage applications,\n\n380\n00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.480\nand we're gonna call\nthem application people.\n\n381\n00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.970\nAnd you need people to have\na direct contact with your users.\n\n382\n00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.700\nAnd we call them a service desk.\n\n383\n00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.330\nNow, you see the aims of the functional\nareas in bullet points at the bottom of\n\n384\n00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.330\nthe slide in front of you.\n\n385\n00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.627\nSuch as, having their own knowledge.\n\n386\n00:22:09.627 --> 00:22:12.360\nAnd having their own processes and\ntheir own work methods.\n\n387\n00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.400\nAnd that third bullet point is always\nthe one that's really interesting.\n\n388\n00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.040\nService management itself,\nthe definition of service management,\n\n389\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.070\nis a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities.\n\n390\n00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.010\nFor providing value to customers\nin the form of goods or services.\n\n391\n00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.380\nA set of specialized\norganizational capabilities.\n\n392\n00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.237\nAnd this is what we mean\nby functional areas.\n\n393\n00:22:33.237 --> 00:22:35.085\nIt's about how organized we are.\n\n394\n00:22:35.085 --> 00:22:37.531\nAnd about how in\nthe specialized knowledge,\n\n395\n00:22:37.531 --> 00:22:40.760\nto be able to facilitate those\noutcomes in those services.\n\n396\n00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.590\nSo to summarize, service operation.\n\n397\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.675\nThe life cycle phase,\nour fourth life cycle phase,\n\n398\n00:22:48.675 --> 00:22:51.138\nis where we look at the business as usual.\n\n399\n00:22:51.138 --> 00:22:53.497\nIt's where we look at delivering value.\n\n400\n00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:59.180\nAnd it's where we look at the fact\nthat value diminishes over time.\n\n401\n00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.241\nAnd so, what we're interested\nin doing is ensuring that\n\n402\n00:23:02.241 --> 00:23:05.576\nwe are continually aligned to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n403\n00:23:05.576 --> 00:23:09.420\nBy providing services that\nthey will continually value.\n\n404\n00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.378\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n405\n00:23:11.378 --> 00:23:14.880\nWell, thank you for\nhelping us in the introduction here.\n\n406\n00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.490\nAs we get started in service operations,\n\n407\n00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.160\none of the key elements\nthat Jo did talk about.\n\n408\n00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.500\nNot only the purpose, but the scope,\nas well as the optimization.\n\n409\n00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.140\nAnd some of these different aspects that\nwe may not have actually considered during\n\n410\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.980\nthe foundations.\n\n411\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.133\nWe're gonna dive a little bit\ndeeper into the operational side,\n\n412\n00:23:31.133 --> 00:23:33.940\nhelping us to deliver\nthe value that we need to.\n\n413\n00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.800\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n414\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.643\nSigning of for ITPro TV.\n\n415\n00:23:39.643 --> 00:23:41.600\nI've been your host Ronny Wong.\n\n416\n00:23:41.600 -->

00:00:08.073\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.073 --> 00:00:12.202\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.760\nYou're watching an ITIL Foundation\nrefresher for your intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.900\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.390\nwe're about to get started here with\nour maestro in ITIL, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.820\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.520\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie,\nand pleased to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.260\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.190\n&gt;&gt; We are doing great today, Jo.\n\n13\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.020\nAs we begin, we understand that\nFoundation's pretty much set the tone for\n\n14\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.570\neverything that we'll be\ntaking a look at here.\n\n15\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.840\nSo having this refresher at this\npoint in our class that we're doing,\n\n16\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.790\nis gonna be a great opportunity for us to\nmake sure we submit those concepts down.\n\n17\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.790\nSo where are we gonna begin, Jo?\n\n18\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.243\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what we;re doing today\nin this particular session, is we're\n\n19\n00:00:56.243 --> 00:01:01.135\ngoing to be going over what everyone\nlearned during the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n20\n00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:05.907\nYou see, we cover lots and lots of topics\nin every single intermediate class,\n\n21\n00:01:05.907 --> 00:01:10.800\nwhether it be the lifecycle classes,\nwhich the service operation is one.\n\n22\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.340\nOr whether it be the capability classes,\nsuch as release control validation, etc.\n\n23\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.102\nOr even through to the [INAUDIBLE] class,\nthe managing across the lifecycle, or\n\n24\n00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:23.430\nthe ITIL practitioner class.\n\n25\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.982\nWe need to understand\nthe Foundation material,\n\n26\n00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:30.350\nbecause it's Foundation, and it is the\nfoundation for all of our other material.\n\n27\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.016\nNow in our Foundation class in ITIL,\n\n28\n00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:37.402\nwe learn all the terminology\nthat's associated with ITIL,\n\n29\n00:01:37.402 --> 00:01:42.391\nalong with 75 terms and\ndefinitions in the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n30\n00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:43.956\nAnd I'll be honest with you,\n\n31\n00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:47.471\nsometimes the ITIL Foundation class\ncan be a little bit daunting.\n\n32\n00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:52.174\nCertainly, the feedback that you get\nfrom a lot of delegates watching\n\n33\n00:01:52.174 --> 00:01:56.561\nITIL Foundation is that they feel\nlike their brains are full after\n\n34\n00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.251\nthe end of the first day.\n\n35\n00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.612\nAnd so what we're going to do really, and\n\n36\n00:02:00.612 --> 00:02:04.060\nwe do this at the start of very\nsingle intermediate class is.\n\n37\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.513\nWe will just go over the foundation\nprinciples just to refresh them in\n\n38\n00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:09.909\neverybody's mind.\n\n39\n00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.620\nAnd then to act as a basis for\n\n40\n00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.520\nwhat we're going to cover\nover the following sessions.\n\n41\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.731\nAnd so what we're going to do\nover the next few sessions is we\n\n42\n00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:23.195\nare going to go over\nthe ITIL Foundation itself.\n\n43\n00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:27.520\nAnd we're going to go over\nthe concept of the lifecycle, etc.\n\n44\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.638\nAnd we're going to be going over,\nas I said, the foundation material.\n\n45\n00:02:31.638 --> 00:02:34.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo,\nthis is best time to get started.\n\n46\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.440\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n47\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.511\nWhere are we beginning?\n\n48\n00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:40.661\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the first thing\nthat we're going to do, and\n\n49\n00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:44.735\nyou saw this slide flash out very,\nvery quickly on the screen there.\n\n50\n00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:48.930\nAnd let's take a look at that\nfirst particular slide there.\n\n51\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.480\nIt says here,\n\n52\n00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.740\nITIL is presented in five core values that\nare referred to as a service lifecycle.\n\n53\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.910\nLet's take a step back.\n\n54\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.495\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I want to do.\n\n55\n00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:02.870\nLet's just think about\nthe fact that a service,\n\n56\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.600\nan IT service, the definition\nof a service very shortly, but\n\n57\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.680\na service\n&gt;&gt; Well, it has a beginning, and\n\n58\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.210\nit has an end.\n\n59\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.410\nIt starts off as an idea.\n\n60\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.580\nThese things don't just happen,\nyou don't just walk in, and\n\n61\n00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.840\nall of a sudden everything's\nthere on your laptop.\n\n62\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.059\nAny new service, well,\nit has an idea, any service.\n\n63\n00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:27.604\nAnd that idea has got to be developed,\nit's gotta be designed first of all,\n\n64\n00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:29.104\nthen it gets developed.\n\n65\n00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:31.665\nAnd then it gets tested, and\nthen it gets deployed, and\n\n66\n00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:34.010\nthen it's put into the live environment.\n\n67\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.530\nAnd then we continually check into\nthat service to make sure that it's\n\n68\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.510\ndoing what it's supposed to do, and\neventually that service will be retired.\n\n69\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.769\nSo we refer to that as\nthe life of a service.\n\n70\n00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.633\nAnd that's the concept of the lifecycle,\nis the fact that we understand\n\n71\n00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:58.275\nthe concept that not just all about\nservices, but also IT as a whole.\n\n72\n00:03:58.275 --> 00:04:02.783\nWell, any process starts off as an idea,\nand then it's designed, and\n\n73\n00:04:02.783 --> 00:04:06.767\nthen developed, and then built,\nand then transitioned, and\n\n74\n00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:09.130\nput into the live environment.\n\n75\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.660\nAnd then we wanna continually improve it,\nokay?\n\n76\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.710\nAnd it's the same with\nany organization and\n\n77\n00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.590\nwith any IT service provider,\nit starts off as an idea.\n\n78\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.973\nThings have to start off with a concept,\nokay?\n\n79\n00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:27.320\nSo what we have is the concept\nof a service lifecycle.\n\n80\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.660\nAnd we've split it into five.\n\n81\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.560\nAnd in the first book, and\nwe call them core publications or books,\n\n82\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.640\nbecause there's a book for\neach lifecycle phase.\n\n83\n00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.870\nAnd we start off with service strategy.\n\n84\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.570\nAnd then that's where our ideas\ncome from in service strategy.\n\n85\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.210\nThis is where we go back to the business,\nand we understand what our business needs.\n\n86\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.880\nHow our business works, and\nhow we can add value to our business.\n\n87\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.777\nAnd then in service design,\nwe then take that idea that we've\n\n88\n00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:02.588\ncome out with in service strategy,\nand we design that idea.\n\n89\n00:05:02.588 --> 00:05:04.125\nThis is not where we develop.\n\n90\n00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:07.750\nThis is where we design the idea.\n\n91\n00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.060\nAnd then in service transition,\nthis is where we do the development.\n\n92\n00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.590\nAnd we do the build, and the test, and\nthe deployment of our new services.\n\n93\n00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.660\nAnd then we deploy them into\nthe live service operation.\n\n94\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.520\nAnd then on a regular basis,\nwe want to continually improve.\n\n95\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.860\nSo while I'm looking at this next slide,\nand it'll show you the processes\n\n96\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.850\nwithin the next slide, I wanna bring\nin a different concept for you.\n\n97\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.946\nI wanna take you just out of IT for\na moment.\n\n98\n00:05:34.946 --> 00:05:37.598\nBecause a service strategy,\nI said, we come up with the idea.\n\n99\n00:05:37.598 --> 00:05:41.439\nAnd we have processes and service\nstrategy, such as financial management,\n\n100\n00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.880\nand business relationship management,\nand strategy management.\n\n101\n00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.094\nWhere, we come up with those ideas,\nand make sure we've got enough money.\n\n102\n00:05:49.094 --> 00:05:53.846\nAnd then in service design, we have\nthings like service level management that\n\n103\n00:05:53.846 --> 00:05:57.882\nwork out our targets for\nhow we're going to deliver that service.\n\n104\n00:05:57.882 --> 00:06:00.991\nSo this is still in design,\nand then design and\n\n105\n00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:04.590\navailability, and\ncapacity and continuity, etc.\n\n106\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.779\nAnd we've got supplier\nmanagement in there, too.\n\n107\n00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.838\nNow let's take this out of IT, as I said.\n\n108\n00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.310\nLet's say we were building a house.\n\n109\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.069\nNow I know, I've got grand ideas,\nI can tell you now.\n\n110\n00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:23.823\nI know that what I want is,\nI want a five bedroom.\n\n111\n00:06:23.823 --> 00:06:25.520\nYeah, I reckon that'll be enough.\n\n112\n00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.160\nBut I want six bathrooms,\nbecause I need one bathroom just for\n\n113\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.770\nguests that are visiting for the day.\n\n114\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.132\nNot that anybody ever visits me, but\nnevertheless, I want six bathrooms, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:35.132 --> 00:06:38.280\nAnd I don't think I need a swimming pool.\n\n116\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.438\nBut I wouldn't mind having\na dedicated office just for me,\n\n117\n00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:43.530\nthat was soundproof that I can work in.\n\n118\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.640\nThat would be great, okay.\n\n119\n00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.800\nThat's what I want.\n\n120\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.052\nSo what I do instead of a strategy,\nis I go the bank and I say,\n\n121\n00:06:50.052 --> 00:06:51.300\ncan I have some money?\n\n122\n00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.580\nOkay, I've got this idea.\n\n123\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.490\nCan I have some money, please?\n\n124\n00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.689\nAnd here's my idea.\n\n125\n00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:59.070\nAnd this is what happens\nin service strategy.\n\n126\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.445\nIt means at the end of service strategy,\nthe bank says, yeah, here you go, have,\n\n127\n00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:06.084\nI don't know, $500,000, there we go.\n\n128\n00:07:06.084 --> 00:07:07.428\nSo now what do I do?\n\n129\n00:07:07.428 --> 00:07:09.770\nWhat do I do with that $500,000,\ndo you reckon?\n\n130\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.340\n&gt;&gt; You take that money, and\n\n131\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.970\nthen you would either have it\ndesigned to be ready to build.\n\n132\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now I'll go to an architect.\n\n133\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.139\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n134\n00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:25.524\nthis is what's happening here in service\ndesign, is I go to an architect and\n\n135\n00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:28.940\nI say, okay,\nplease can you design me a house.\n\n136\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.809\nThese are my prerequisites,\nand generally, you know what?\n\n137\n00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:34.180\nWell, I'm a customer.\n\n138\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.800\nI'm not a builder, so\nI don't know anything about materials.\n\n139\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.460\nBut what I do know, is that I've got\nsome very specific requirements.\n\n140\n00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.765\nAnd probably, because I'm a little bit\nstrange, they're incredibly specific.\n\n141\n00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:50.890\nSo I'm gonna go to him, and I'm gonna\nsay to him, I want five bedrooms.\n\n142\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.812\nAnd I want six bathrooms, and\nI want my own sort of soundproofed office,\n\n143\n00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:56.380\nwhere I still want a window.\n\n144\n00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.331\nAnd I like daylight, but then at the same\ntime, I don't want any noise coming in.\n\n145\n00:08:00.331 --> 00:08:04.892\nAnd I want bathrooms, and\nI wanna have marble in the bathrooms.\n\n146\n00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:08.498\nAnd This is everything that\nI want all in my kitchen.\n\n147\n00:08:08.498 --> 00:08:12.090\nI gotta have one of those\nrefrigerators with a TV screen in it.\n\n148\n00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.478\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you now,\n\n149\n00:08:13.478 --> 00:08:15.360\nit's got to have one of those.\n\n150\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.885\nAnd I wanna camera in every room,\nand I want at least two, maybe,\n\n151\n00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:21.627\nthree routers in there.\n\n152\n00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:25.870\nAnd I want everything to be wireless, and\nI want everything hidden in the walls.\n\n153\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.996\nI don't wanna see any of these technology.\n\n154\n00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:29.645\nI told you I was picky.\n\n155\n00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:32.323\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to\n\n156\n00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:35.644\nthe architect, and\nI'm gonna tell him all of this,\n\n157\n00:08:35.644 --> 00:08:38.200\nand he is going to produce a blueprint.\n\n158\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.557\nBut here's something special\nabout that blueprint.\n\n159\n00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:46.138\nThat blueprint is not just\ngoing to be the plans,\n\n160\n00:08:46.138 --> 00:08:50.400\nthe two-dimensional plans for that house.\n\n161\n00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.407\nWhat that architect is going to deliver\nme is a three-dimensional mock up of what\n\n162\n00:08:56.407 --> 00:08:58.426\nthat house is going to look like.\n\n163\n00:08:58.426 --> 00:09:03.171\nHe's going to include all of the plans for\nall of the plumbing, for\n\n164\n00:09:03.171 --> 00:09:07.430\nall of the electrics, for\nall of the IT wiring that I want.\n\n165\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:12.276\nHe's going to include the list of\ncontractors that he's going to use,\n\n166\n00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:13.583\nthose suppliers.\n\n167\n00:09:13.583 --> 00:09:17.840\nHe's going to tell me exactly what tiles\nare going to be used in the bathroom.\n\n168\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.630\nHe's going to tell me\nexactly where he's going to\n\n169\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.660\npurchase all of the furniture from,\nyeah, I didn't mention furniture, did I?\n\n170\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.044\nHe's gonna tell me where he's\ngonna purchase everything,\n\n171\n00:09:30.044 --> 00:09:32.642\nlike even the bed sheets and\neverything from.\n\n172\n00:09:32.642 --> 00:09:36.203\nHe's going to even tell what color\nthe bed sheets are going to be.\n\n173\n00:09:36.203 --> 00:09:39.240\nThis is not just any blueprint.\n\n174\n00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.100\nThis is what I call, and what we call\nin ITIL, a service design package.\n\n175\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.070\nAnd that service design package\ncontains absolutely everything\n\n176\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.468\nthat's needed to build, and to test, and\n\n177\n00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:59.030\nto deploy, and then to run that house.\n\n178\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.680\nThat service design package even includes\nall of the instruction manuals for\n\n179\n00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.870\nall of the appliances, and everything\nelse that I've got in that house.\n\n180\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.155\nThat's what's in that\nservice design package.\n\n181\n00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:12.164\nSo we think of it as an architect's\nblueprint, but here in ITIL,\n\n182\n00:10:12.164 --> 00:10:14.770\nwe think of it as\na service design package.\n\n183\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.030\nAnd this is why we've got all of\nthose processes in service design.\n\n184\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.799\nAnd then what happens is we hand\nthat over to service transition.\n\n185\n00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:27.350\nWe hand it over to the builder,\nokay, to the contractors.\n\n186\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.828\nAnd we let them come and do their work.\n\n187\n00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:30.868\nAnd they do the build, and the test, and\n\n188\n00:10:30.868 --> 00:10:33.340\ntake a look all of those\nprocesses in there.\n\n189\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.547\nThey understand, with that\ncertain configuration management,\n\n190\n00:10:36.547 --> 00:10:40.496\nexactly what the wiring is going to look\nlike and how it's going to hang together,\n\n191\n00:10:40.496 --> 00:10:44.125\ncuz the last thing you need is me trying\nto put a TV up on that wall over there.\n\n192\n00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:48.886\nOr me asking for TV on that wall up there,\nand you can't because it's a solid brick\n\n193\n00:10:48.886 --> 00:10:52.970\nwall, because I wanted it in brick,\nright, all the external walls.\n\n194\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.688\nAnd so the TV can't go on there.\n\n195\n00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:55.928\nIt's gotta go on that wall.\n\n196\n00:10:55.928 --> 00:10:56.448\nSo asset and\n\n197\n00:10:56.448 --> 00:11:00.540\nconfiguration management tells me how\neverything is going to hang together.\n\n198\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.665\nSo here in service transition,\nwe do all the build.\n\n199\n00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:09.001\nAnd at the end of service transition,\nwhat happens is I'm the customer,\n\n200\n00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.849\nand somebody hands over the case to me.\n\n201\n00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:16.528\nAnd I walk in that house,\nand I open the refrigerator,\n\n202\n00:11:16.528 --> 00:11:21.180\nthe one that was designed\nin service design.\n\n203\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.383\nI get out that bottle of wine that\nwas designed in service design, but\n\n204\n00:11:25.383 --> 00:11:27.934\nthat's being nicely chilled right now.\n\n205\n00:11:27.934 --> 00:11:29.983\nAnd I go to the cupboard in the kitchen,\n\n206\n00:11:29.983 --> 00:11:32.230\nwhere I said I wanted\nmy glasses to be kept.\n\n207\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.221\nAnd they've got the right glasses in the\nright cupboard, and I take out a glass,\n\n208\n00:11:36.221 --> 00:11:37.173\nand I pour my wine.\n\n209\n00:11:37.173 --> 00:11:41.886\nAnd I walk over to the couch that I\ntold service design that I wanted, and\n\n210\n00:11:41.886 --> 00:11:44.910\nsit in front of the TV\nwith my glass of wine.\n\n211\n00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.464\nI pick up the controls because\nthe remote control are next to\n\n212\n00:11:49.464 --> 00:11:54.199\nthe instruction manual, and\nI just sit back, and I watch TV,\n\n213\n00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:57.313\nbecause all of my services are in place.\n\n214\n00:11:57.313 --> 00:12:03.334\nI've got my contracts in place with the TV\ncompany, and with the Internet, etc.\n\n215\n00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:06.414\nAnd so now I am in to what\nwe call service operation,\n\n216\n00:12:06.414 --> 00:12:09.270\nwhich is just business as usual.\n\n217\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:14.046\nAnd business as usual is where I just\ncarry on living in my house without any\n\n218\n00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:14.748\nproblem.\n\n219\n00:12:14.748 --> 00:12:17.164\nOkay, that's not going to happen,\nall right?\n\n220\n00:12:17.164 --> 00:12:17.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We know that\n\n221\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.130\nthere are going to be problems.\n\n222\n00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.588\nAnd so during service operation,\n\n223\n00:12:22.588 --> 00:12:27.843\nthen I'm going to have systems that\nare going to monitor internet usage,\n\n224\n00:12:27.843 --> 00:12:33.540\nand systems that are going to monitor what\nTV that I watch, and I set DVRs, etc.\n\n225\n00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.551\nAnd then if anything does go wrong,\n\n226\n00:12:35.551 --> 00:12:39.923\nI've got contractors etc that I can call\nif anything goes wrong in the house.\n\n227\n00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:42.480\nThat's incident and problem management.\n\n228\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.940\nI know who to call if I want something\nnew, if I want an upgrade, for instance.\n\n229\n00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.660\nBut then in continual service improvement,\n\n230\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.037\nwe're continually assessing\nthat you know what?\n\n231\n00:12:53.037 --> 00:12:57.971\nThe showers remain water tight, that\nthe refrigerator is at the right level of\n\n232\n00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:00.374\ntechnology because I do like my toys.\n\n233\n00:13:00.374 --> 00:13:05.361\n[LAUGH] And so we're continually improving\nthat house, because let's face it,\n\n234\n00:13:05.361 --> 00:13:09.880\nyou don't live with the same decor for\nten years, do you?\n\n235\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.304\nAnd this is what happens.\n\n236\n00:13:11.304 --> 00:13:16.295\nSo from an IT perspective, service\nstrategy's where we come up with the idea,\n\n237\n00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.610\nand where we go to the bank for money.\n\n238\n00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.320\nAnd service design is where we design\neverything, including our testing,\n\n239\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.500\nour training, and\ndesign how we're going to operate.\n\n240\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.582\nIn service transition, we build it,\nwe test it, we deploy it.\n\n241\n00:13:30.582 --> 00:13:35.530\nAnd in operation, we manage those\nservice on an ongoing basis.\n\n242\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:40.294\nAnd in continual service improvement,\nwe continue to ensure that our services\n\n243\n00:13:40.294 --> 00:13:43.079\nare aligned to the needs\nof the organization.\n\n244\n00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:48.778\nIn other words, that they're\nexactly what we want to see for\n\n245\n00:13:48.778 --> 00:13:53.320\nthe organization at that point in time,\nyeah?\n\n246\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.293\nBecause things change, needs change.\n\n247\n00:13:57.293 --> 00:14:02.470\nSo that's quite a lot there,\njust to take in, just on one slide.\n\n248\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.242\nSo now we're gonna look\na little bit more in-depth, and\n\n249\n00:14:05.242 --> 00:14:09.114\nthis is where I say sometimes, everybody\ndoes need a refresher from foundation\n\n250\n00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.808\nbecause we've got a lot to learn.\n\n251\n00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.483\nSo let's take a look, then.\n\n252\n00:14:13.483 --> 00:14:16.210\nI talked about services, and\nabout the idea of a service.\n\n253\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.240\nSo what is a service?\n\n254\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.351\nWell, the definition of a service\nis up there in blue, okay?\n\n255\n00:14:21.351 --> 00:14:26.155\nAnd the ITIL definition of a service from\nthe publication is a service is a means of\n\n256\n00:14:26.155 --> 00:14:30.609\ndelivering value to customers by\nfacilitating the outcomes that they want\n\n257\n00:14:30.609 --> 00:14:34.370\nto achieve without the ownership\nof specific costs and risks.\n\n258\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.970\nSeems like a mouthful, doesn't it?\n\n259\n00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.734\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Let me break it down then.\n\n260\n00:14:38.734 --> 00:14:44.050\nOkay, a service is a means\nof delivering value.\n\n261\n00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.409\nHm, that's the first challenge\ncuz value is perceived.\n\n262\n00:14:47.409 --> 00:14:50.763\nIf I were to go out and buy a car,\n\n263\n00:14:50.763 --> 00:14:55.412\nwell, Ronnie, let me ask you a question.\n\n264\n00:14:55.412 --> 00:14:57.229\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you were to go out and\n\n265\n00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:58.810\nbuy a car right now,\n\n266\n00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:04.018\nbearing in mind that I'm looking\nat this definition of a service,\n\n267\n00:15:04.018 --> 00:15:09.940\nand a service is a means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating outcomes.\n\n268\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.130\nSo the outcome of a car that we wanna\nfacilitate is to get from A to B, right?\n\n269\n00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:14.922\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's the outcome.\n\n270\n00:15:14.922 --> 00:15:20.380\nSo if you were to go and buy a car,\nwhat would you look for in a car?\n\n271\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.592\n&gt;&gt; If it's just to facilitate A to B?\n\n272\n00:15:23.592 --> 00:15:24.749\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n273\n00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:30.590\n&gt;&gt; It would probably be a very small and\neconomical car that's a manual driven car.\n\n274\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n275\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.366\nYou see, where as me, I come from Europe.\n\n276\n00:15:36.366 --> 00:15:38.353\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We have roads with no speed limit\n\n277\n00:15:38.353 --> 00:15:38.905\non them.\n\n278\n00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:39.805\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n279\n00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:41.662\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I want something quick.\n\n280\n00:15:41.662 --> 00:15:44.315\nI want something that's going to handle.\n\n281\n00:15:44.315 --> 00:15:48.046\nI want something that's going\nto lose me my license, probably.\n\n282\n00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:51.679\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I want something that's,\n\n283\n00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:56.270\nI'm with you on the manual, yeah,\nso I can handle it round corners.\n\n284\n00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.141\nYeah, I'm gonna get myself into trouble.\n\n285\n00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:00.956\n[LAUGH] But ultimately,\n\n286\n00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:05.864\nwhat I value is completely\ndifferent to what you value, right?\n\n287\n00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Given the limitation of what you\nsaid just to get from A to B, yes.\n\n288\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.870\nBut if I wanted to take that car and\ndo other things with it,\n\n289\n00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.190\nI might have chosen the same thing.\n\n290\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.366\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n291\n00:16:15.366 --> 00:16:17.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n292\n00:16:17.204 --> 00:16:21.843\nI still like to get from\nA to B fast [LAUGH].\n\n293\n00:16:21.843 --> 00:16:23.201\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n\n294\n00:16:23.201 --> 00:16:26.283\n&gt;&gt; You see, the thing is that we know\nthe outcome that we want to facilitate.\n\n295\n00:16:26.283 --> 00:16:29.640\nBut we all have a different\nperception of value.\n\n296\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n297\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.620\n&gt;&gt; That's our first challenge, straight\naway, is a means of delivering value.\n\n298\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.030\nAnd you can say, okay then, well,\nput this in the business perspectives.\n\n299\n00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.830\nThen actually, that's not too bad,\n\n300\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.900\ncuz everybody values\nthe same thing in business.\n\n301\n00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.059\nThat's not true at all.\n\n302\n00:16:47.059 --> 00:16:50.090\nWhat desktop picture do you\nhave on your laptop there?\n\n303\n00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.000\nIs it the one that you were give when\nyou were first given that laptop?\n\n304\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.000\n&gt;&gt; Probably, yes.\n\n305\n00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.281\n&gt;&gt; It is, right, okay.\n\n306\n00:16:57.281 --> 00:16:58.855\nI can tell you that this one isn't.\n\n307\n00:16:58.855 --> 00:17:01.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because we all change it.\n\n308\n00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.560\nWe all customize our desktop.\n\n309\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.690\nAnd so to say, well, that's okay in\nbusiness, we all value the same thing.\n\n310\n00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.000\nWe don't.\n\n311\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.530\nWe don't.\n\n312\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.685\nI take a look at my keyboard right now.\n\n313\n00:17:11.685 --> 00:17:15.131\nAnd my keyboard, even though we\nhave exactly the same laptop,\n\n314\n00:17:15.131 --> 00:17:17.938\nmy keyboard looks completely\ndifferent to yours.\n\n315\n00:17:17.938 --> 00:17:18.866\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n316\n00:17:18.866 --> 00:17:21.968\n&gt;&gt; Because we both value\nthe different things, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:21.968 --> 00:17:25.810\nYou like yours exactly how\nit came out of the box.\n\n318\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.255\nWhereas I like mine completely different.\n\n319\n00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:30.020\n[LAUGH] Completely different.\n\n320\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.640\nWe gotta be a little bit colorful here.\n\n321\n00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.520\nSo even in a business perspective,\nwe don't have the same concept of value.\n\n322\n00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.890\nWhat we can do though, we can understand\nthat we deliver value to customers.\n\n323\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.090\nAnd that in itself can be a challenge,\nokay?\n\n324\n00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:51.065\nBecause a customer is\nsomebody who buys a service.\n\n325\n00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:52.710\nNot a user.\n\n326\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.330\nA user is somebody who uses the service.\n\n327\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.070\nSo, let me ask you a question.\n\n328\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.301\nSee, I don't ask you a lot of questions.\n\n329\n00:18:01.301 --> 00:18:02.110\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n330\n00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:05.290\n&gt;&gt; When was the last time you\nwent into a coffee shop and\n\n331\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.350\nbought a drink for someone?\n\n332\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.065\n&gt;&gt; The last time,\nit was probably close to two years ago.\n\n333\n00:18:12.065 --> 00:18:12.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n334\n00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.930\nSo when you go into that coffee shop and\nyou buy somebody a drink,\n\n335\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.660\nthe person behind the counter,\nare they interested in\n\n336\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.410\nwhat you value or are they interested in\nthat person that you bought the drink for?\n\n337\n00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.670\nDo they care whether they\nlike the drink or not?\n\n338\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.333\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that they would care.\n\n339\n00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:33.383\nBut maybe they don't.\n\n340\n00:18:33.383 --> 00:18:34.746\nMaybe they just wanna sell it.\n\n341\n00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, see there's an assumption.\n\n342\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.590\nBecause you see,\nif you think about it from a user and\n\n343\n00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.290\ncustomer perspective, okay.\n\n344\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:49.507\nIf I take somebody into a coffee shop, and\nI buy them a drink, I expect that that\n\n345\n00:18:49.507 --> 00:18:54.503\ncoffee shop is probably only gonna care\nabout getting that money out of me.\n\n346\n00:18:54.503 --> 00:18:58.199\nAnd not care about whether\nthe person I bought a drink for\n\n347\n00:18:58.199 --> 00:18:59.939\nis going to like it or not.\n\n348\n00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:03.340\nBut the simple fact is, that if\nthe person that I bought the drink for\n\n349\n00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.623\ndoesn't like it, then they're\ngonna turn around to me and say,\n\n350\n00:19:06.623 --> 00:19:10.108\nwell, we're not going back there again,\nI don't like that place.\n\n351\n00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:15.869\nSo, users influence customers' decisions.\n\n352\n00:19:15.869 --> 00:19:18.926\nSo even though we wanna deliver\nthe value to customers,\n\n353\n00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:22.970\nwe're actually really concerned with\nvalue perception of users, too.\n\n354\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n355\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.750\n&gt;&gt; Because if that person\nthat I bought a drink for\n\n356\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.970\ndidn't like it,\nthen we're not going back there.\n\n357\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.335\nCuz I don't wanna listen to it.\n\n358\n00:19:34.335 --> 00:19:36.600\n[LAUGH] So yeah,\nwe're not going back there.\n\n359\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.680\nSo we talk then about\ndelivering value to customers,\n\n360\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.540\nnot forgetting owners, by facilitating\nthe outcomes that they want to achieve.\n\n361\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.870\nFacilitating the outcomes.\n\n362\n00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.923\nWe cannot achieve their outcomes for them.\n\n363\n00:19:49.923 --> 00:19:52.119\nThey have got to put some input into this.\n\n364\n00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:55.390\nSo we want to facilitate outcomes.\n\n365\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.943\nSo we're not going to type\nyour e-mails for you.\n\n366\n00:19:58.943 --> 00:20:00.774\nWe can't do that, okay?\n\n367\n00:20:00.774 --> 00:20:04.236\nWhat we can do is we can give you\nthe ability to send and receive e-mail.\n\n368\n00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:08.540\nBut you've got to type that out yourself,\nand you've got to send that e-mail, and\n\n369\n00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.918\nyou've gotta read\nthe e-mails that come in.\n\n370\n00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:13.170\nSo we're gonna do all that for you.\n\n371\n00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:17.083\nBut then, we want to facilitate\nthat outcome for you.\n\n372\n00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:23.400\nBut without transferring to\nyou specific costs and risks.\n\n373\n00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.976\nA service is made up of components.\n\n374\n00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:30.362\nAnd out of those components, we consider\nthings like software and hardware and\n\n375\n00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:34.812\nenvironmental aspects, and people that\nsupport the service and the people that\n\n376\n00:20:34.812 --> 00:20:39.290\nimplement the service, and the\ninfrastructure and documentation as well.\n\n377\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.059\nThese are all components of a service.\n\n378\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.490\nNow, without any single one of those\ncomponents, that service would not exist.\n\n379\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:52.060\nBut if you consider that we\nwould have to actually work out\n\n380\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:57.130\nthe specific cost of each one of those\ncomponents to each individual customer for\n\n381\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.240\neach individual service,\nthat's a lot of effort.\n\n382\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:00.803\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n383\n00:21:00.803 --> 00:21:02.767\nwe're not gonna transfer\nthose specific costs to you.\n\n384\n00:21:02.767 --> 00:21:04.582\nWe might charge you a nominal fee,\n\n385\n00:21:04.582 --> 00:21:07.579\nbut we're not gonna transfer\nthe specific cost to you.\n\n386\n00:21:07.579 --> 00:21:12.200\nFor the same reason, we're not gonna\ntransfer specific risks to you.\n\n387\n00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.236\nIdeally, what we want to do is\ndeliver a service that's going to\n\n388\n00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:18.854\nallow you to improve your performance and\n\n389\n00:21:18.854 --> 00:21:24.117\nreduce any constraints that you might\nfeel whilst achieving that outcome, okay?\n\n390\n00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:27.604\nAnd that outcome being,\nas it says there, the intended or\n\n391\n00:21:27.604 --> 00:21:30.410\nactual result of carrying out an activity.\n\n392\n00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.180\nOver on the right-hand side of that slide.\n\n393\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.390\nSo, what about service management, then?\n\n394\n00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:40.130\nWell, service management, which is ITIL\nis a framework for service management.\n\n395\n00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:46.170\nService management is a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities for providing\n\n396\n00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:51.976\nvalue to customers in the form of goods or\nservices, as it says in the ITIL books.\n\n397\n00:21:51.976 --> 00:21:54.682\nThere's a couple of words\nI want to bring out there.\n\n398\n00:21:54.682 --> 00:21:59.906\nAnd that is, specialized\norganizational capability, all right?\n\n399\n00:21:59.906 --> 00:22:01.180\nThree words, not a couple.\n\n400\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.100\nSo we've gotta have the specialism.\n\n401\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.610\nIn other words, we don't just need broad\nexperience, we need specialist experience.\n\n402\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.210\nWe also need to be organized.\n\n403\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.453\nIf we're disorganized, if there's absolute\nchaos going on in our IT organization,\n\n404\n00:22:18.453 --> 00:22:22.664\nthen unfortunately it's not an IT\norganization, it's an IT disorganization.\n\n405\n00:22:22.664 --> 00:22:24.982\nAnd we're never going to deliver value.\n\n406\n00:22:24.982 --> 00:22:28.556\nBut we gotta be capable, too.\n\n407\n00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:33.521\nYet we've got to have the right\ncapabilities to be able to deliver those\n\n408\n00:22:33.521 --> 00:22:34.880\nservices, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.690\nSo we've got to take what we consider\nto be our asset, our resources and\n\n410\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.970\nour capabilities, and\n\n411\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:46.790\ntransform them into something that\nwill deliver valuable services.\n\n412\n00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.086\nOur tangible capabilities, our resources,\nare things that we can touch and feel.\n\n413\n00:22:52.086 --> 00:22:55.440\nSo, things like our money,\nsomething tangible,\n\n414\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.434\nour hardware is something tangible,\nour software is something tangible.\n\n415\n00:23:00.434 --> 00:23:05.570\nAnd people in terms of bums on\nseats are tangible as well.\n\n416\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.770\nThese are things that we can touch and\nfeel.\n\n417\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.665\nDon't go touching and feeling people too\nmuch, though, we end up in court, right?\n\n418\n00:23:11.665 --> 00:23:12.260\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n419\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Just a warning on that one.\n\n420\n00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.320\n[LAUGH] And\nthen we've got our capabilities, too.\n\n421\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.110\nBecause we can't just have bums on seats,\nas we would call it.\n\n422\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.030\nThey've gotta have the right skills.\n\n423\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.170\nAnd so our capabilities encompass\nthings like intangible assets.\n\n424\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.660\nThings that we have to have that\nare an asset to the organization, but\n\n425\n00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.640\nthat are very, very difficult\nto quantify such as experience.\n\n426\n00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.870\nSuch as the way that we're organized.\n\n427\n00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.760\nEven who are management are.\n\n428\n00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.321\nIf our management are, how should I say,\nif they're disorganized themselves.\n\n429\n00:23:44.321 --> 00:23:49.118\nOr perhaps we've got interpersonal\nconflict in some of our teams,\n\n430\n00:23:49.118 --> 00:23:54.688\nthen we're not going to be able to\ndeliver efficient and effective services.\n\n431\n00:23:54.688 --> 00:23:58.828\nSo service management is\nall about implementing and\n\n432\n00:23:58.828 --> 00:24:02.215\nmanaging those quality services, okay,\n\n433\n00:24:02.215 --> 00:24:08.141\nwe have to ensure that the customer\nreceives the service that they value and\n\n434\n00:24:08.141 --> 00:24:11.809\nthat it performs at a level\nthat they expect and\n\n435\n00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:16.228\nto a cost that they expect to So\nhere we are then in IT, and\n\n436\n00:24:16.228 --> 00:24:20.555\nwe are what is considered to\nbe a service provider, and\n\n437\n00:24:20.555 --> 00:24:25.300\nwe have three different\ntypes of service provider.\n\n438\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.840\nWe have a service provider that\nis internal to the business unit.\n\n439\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:34.000\nAnd we have a service provider that\noperates a shared services unit, so\n\n440\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.990\ninternal to the organization but\nserves many business units.\n\n441\n00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:42.980\nAnd then we have a type three, as we call\nit, which is an external service provider\n\n442\n00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.430\nand that is somebody who is completely\nexternal, outsourced, we'd like to say.\n\n443\n00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.180\nOkay.\n\n444\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.917\nCompletely external to the organization.\n\n445\n00:24:51.917 --> 00:24:55.389\nSo, within our service\nprovider organization and\n\n446\n00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:59.355\nwithin our business,\nwe have what we call stakeholders.\n\n447\n00:24:59.355 --> 00:25:04.546\nA stakeholder is defined\nas any interested party.\n\n448\n00:25:04.546 --> 00:25:11.612\nNot just financial interest, biggest\nmistake that I think that we make here.\n\n449\n00:25:11.612 --> 00:25:16.253\nAlthough, I have to say that we\nhave had discussions in other\n\n450\n00:25:16.253 --> 00:25:20.400\nsession about the nuances\nbetween languages.\n\n451\n00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.370\nAnd there is an inference Is that\nstakeholder in certain cultures\n\n452\n00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.080\nmeans that somebody who\nhas a financial interest.\n\n453\n00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.500\nBut that's not the case.\n\n454\n00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.980\nWe're taking about anybody\nthat's had an interest.\n\n455\n00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.941\nYou know, I hate to say this but\n\n456\n00:25:33.941 --> 00:25:38.773\neven my nosy neighbor is considered to\nbe a stakeholder in my life because she\n\n457\n00:25:38.773 --> 00:25:42.185\ndefinitely has an interest\nin everything that we do.\n\n458\n00:25:42.185 --> 00:25:46.154\n[LAUGH] So, we got stakeholders within\nour internal service providers such\n\n459\n00:25:46.154 --> 00:25:51.010\nas functions, these groups of people, and\nwe'll talk a little bit more about them.\n\n460\n00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:57.320\nAnd groups and teams and we've got people\noutside of service provider organization\n\n461\n00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:03.380\nsuch as customers and users and\nnow suppliers and now stakeholders too.\n\n462\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.220\nOkay so\na stakeholder is any interested party.\n\n463\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.940\nYou'll notice that what we're doing is\nwe're just going over a lot at the moment.\n\n464\n00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.060\nWe're going over a lot of the terms and\n\n465\n00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.840\nthe definitions that we\nlearned in foundation cracks.\n\n466\n00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.190\nHere's another term and definition\nthat we learned in foundation class,\n\n467\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.750\nis the concept of both internal and\nexternal services.\n\n468\n00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:32.450\nAnd internal services is service\nthat we provide Internally to\n\n469\n00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:37.505\nour organization, and an external service\nis a service that we provide externally,\n\n470\n00:26:37.505 --> 00:26:39.520\n[LAUGH] to external customers.\n\n471\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.820\nSo an internal service would be something,\nand I use examples like SAP or\n\n472\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:49.180\nlike our email service, is something\ninternal to our organization But\n\n473\n00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:54.520\nthen an external service is something that\nour customers use such as the website for\n\n474\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.050\ninstance or external service catalogs\n\n475\n00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:02.280\nif we're in an industry where we are\nselling goods externally to our customers.\n\n476\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.460\nSo you will see here from this\nparticular slide, that over on\n\n477\n00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:11.430\nthe left-hand side internal services\nare delivered to business units and\n\n478\n00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:17.250\nthey, in turn, use those to deliver\na service to external customers.\n\n479\n00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.890\nThen, we have on the right hand side,\nwe have services, like our internet,\n\n480\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.470\nthat are delivered direct through\nto our external customers.\n\n481\n00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.830\nOn the next slide, there's just really\na little bit of an example over\n\n482\n00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:39.700\nCore services, enabling services,\nand enhancing services.\n\n483\n00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.990\nOkay, which is just further\nclassification of our services.\n\n484\n00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.099\nTo be honest, we split our services down,\nbelieve it or\n\n485\n00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:49.937\nnot into those that are called,\nthose that are enabling services and\n\n486\n00:27:49.937 --> 00:27:52.380\nthose that are enhancing services.\n\n487\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.228\nNow, we've got pizza delivery example\nup there on the screen in front of you.\n\n488\n00:27:56.228 --> 00:27:59.215\nI wanna give you an IT example,\nfor instance.\n\n489\n00:27:59.215 --> 00:28:04.650\nSos let's think about our email service.\n\n490\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.520\nSo, the core service in an email service\nis that ability to send and receive email.\n\n491\n00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.718\nThat's a core service.\n\n492\n00:28:12.718 --> 00:28:17.412\nNow, the enabling service is a service\nthat's a service in its own right but\n\n493\n00:28:17.412 --> 00:28:19.550\nthat underpins the core service.\n\n494\n00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.400\nAnd that would be our infrastructure,\nit's a service in its own right, but\n\n495\n00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.580\nwithout it, emails are not going\nto be able to be sent or received.\n\n496\n00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.960\nAnd then an enhancing\nservice is an optional extra.\n\n497\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.310\nSomething that we can do that maybe\nsets us apart from our competitors, or\n\n498\n00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.570\nsomething that we just choose to do.\n\n499\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.940\nIt's optional for our business.\n\n500\n00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.544\nAnd that would be something like\na shared calendar, for instance, okay?\n\n501\n00:28:45.544 --> 00:28:49.726\nSo, something that is an optional\nextra that's our email,\n\n502\n00:28:49.726 --> 00:28:55.302\nthat's our shared directory, shared\ncalendar, is the word I'm looking for.\n\n503\n00:28:55.302 --> 00:28:59.460\nSo, these are our core and\nour enabling and our enhancing services.\n\n504\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.970\nNow, I asked you About value,\n\n505\n00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:09.460\nlittle earlier on and\nabout what we perceive as value.\n\n506\n00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.170\nSo I'm just gonna wrap up this section\n\n507\n00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:17.240\nby going over a couple of slides that\nlook over The definition of volume.\n\n508\n00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:22.310\nNow you'll see that in the bottom\nof this particular slide\n\n509\n00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:27.270\nright in front of you now you'll\nsee that the diagram that\n\n510\n00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:32.330\nyou saw in your Intel foundation class and\nnotice that diagram that always looks\n\n511\n00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.250\nvery very complicated and everybody always\nsays how I'm I supposed to remember this.\n\n512\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.270\nWell, it's really easy,\n\n513\n00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:44.530\nbecause you just need to remember the\nconcepts of utility and warranty, okay.\n\n514\n00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.980\nSo the concept of utility is very,\n\n515\n00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.150\nvery simply,\ndoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n516\n00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.644\nAnd that's its fitness for purpose.\n\n517\n00:29:52.644 --> 00:29:54.818\nDoes that service send and receive email?\n\n518\n00:29:54.818 --> 00:29:56.100\nYes, it does.\n\n519\n00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.140\nOkay then it has a utility.\n\n520\n00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.640\nYou could have a web based email service\nthat will do exactly that for you.\n\n521\n00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.810\nIt will deliver that email.\n\n522\n00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:11.040\nBut can I ask you in a business\nperspective then Ronnie, would a web based\n\n523\n00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.280\nemail deliver you levels of security\nthat you would feel comfortable with?\n\n524\n00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.140\nDo you think?\n\n525\n00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.800\n&gt;&gt; Not Yeah, not necessarily.\n\n526\n00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.600\nEspecially if I'm actually\nusing a public provider, and\n\n527\n00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.360\nnot my own, as far as a portal that allows\nme access inside of my own network.\n\n528\n00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n529\n00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:34.000\nSo what you're saying is\n&gt;&gt; Is then, in effect, is that service\n\n530\n00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.860\nprovides utility which it does, but\nit doesn't provide warranty aspects.\n\n531\n00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.208\nAnd if we look at the warranty aspects,\n\n532\n00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:46.409\nyou will see that those warranty\nWarranty aspects are availability,\n\n533\n00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:50.485\ncapacity, security which is one\nthat I mentioned and continuity.\n\n534\n00:30:50.485 --> 00:30:57.075\nAnd so both utility and warranty have to\nexist in order for us to perceive value.\n\n535\n00:30:58.125 --> 00:31:01.431\nSo let's go through those\nwarranty aspects, okay?\n\n536\n00:31:01.431 --> 00:31:03.205\nIs their service available enough?\n\n537\n00:31:03.205 --> 00:31:10.930\nWell okay an Internet based web mail\nservice might be available enough.\n\n538\n00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.590\nBut does it have enough capacity?\n\n539\n00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:18.050\nGuarantee when you try and send some files\nit will tell you that they're too big.\n\n540\n00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.094\nDoes it have continuity?\n\n541\n00:31:19.094 --> 00:31:22.745\nWell, it might do but\nwe don't have any assurance of that and\n\n542\n00:31:22.745 --> 00:31:27.490\nthat's the key thing about warranty,\nis that we have assurance.\n\n543\n00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.222\nAnd we certainly don't have\nany insurance for security.\n\n544\n00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:36.430\nSo, you see both utility and warranty\nneed to exist for us to perceive value.\n\n545\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:41.450\nIt's not just good enough for us to have a\nservice that does what it says on the can.\n\n546\n00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.610\nWe've gotta be able to use it as well.\n\n547\n00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.450\nAnd this next slide,\n\n548\n00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:51.090\nwhich is something that I'm going\nto use to wrap up this session.\n\n549\n00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:56.230\nIf you look, the utility effect\nin that bottom left hand corner\n\n550\n00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:01.030\nis all about increasing\nthe probability and\n\n551\n00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:06.530\nmaintaining that probability of that\nservice Working, in other words\n\n552\n00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:11.560\nthat service will do what it says on\nthe cam without the shadow of a doubt,\n\n553\n00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:17.740\nbut the warranty effect has to\nactually decrease variances\n\n554\n00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:24.060\nin the In availability and in capacity and\nin continuity and in security.\n\n555\n00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.422\nBecause what we actually want to do is we\nwant to ensure that we have all of those.\n\n556\n00:32:29.422 --> 00:32:31.802\nSo, we want to decrease and\n\n557\n00:32:31.802 --> 00:32:37.502\nwe want to decrease the uncertainty\nof providing those aspects.\n\n558\n00:32:37.502 --> 00:32:41.082\nAs we've said,\nwe have got to have both utility and\n\n559\n00:32:41.082 --> 00:32:44.510\nwarranty in order for\nanyone to perceive value.\n\n560\n00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.120\nSo for now, we're going to wrap\nup this particular session,\n\n561\n00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:54.140\nwhich is part one of our\nrecap over ITIL foundation.\n\n562\n00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.670\nAnd in our next session, we're going\nto look further into our assets and\n\n563\n00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.740\ninto our resources and capabilities, etc.\n\n564\n00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.470\nAnd we're also going to look at processes\nand we're going to look at Roles and\n\n565\n00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:11.780\nwe're going to look at all about\nresponsibilities, etc, too.\n\n566\n00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.345\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\nWell, thank you again for\n\n567\n00:33:13.345 --> 00:33:15.757\nhelping us out with this\npart of the refresher.\n\n568\n00:33:15.757 --> 00:33:19.826\nThere's a lot more for us to cover but\nthat means we're gonna go ahead and\n\n569\n00:33:19.826 --> 00:33:21.670\nend this episode then.\n\n570\n00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.960\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n571\n00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.260\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n572\n00:33:27.260 -->

having me back,\nRonnie, how are you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.020\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, taking work and\n\n13\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.870\nremembering all those different terms\nthat I have seen in the foundation.\n\n14\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.980\nAnd now getting those things\nkind of brought back up\n\n15\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.160\nis really starting to help.\n\n16\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.470\nSo what do we actually have left to do,\nwhere are we gonna begin?\n\n17\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.587\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, it's this foundation\nmaterial that we're recapping over.\n\n18\n00:00:56.587 --> 00:01:00.944\nThere's so much information to absorb,\nso much information.\n\n19\n00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:05.550\nAnd trust me you're not the only one\nbecause we have delegates that leave\n\n20\n00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.843\nfoundation class.\n\n21\n00:01:06.843 --> 00:01:11.501\nAnd the feedback that they'll\ngive you sometimes is just, woah,\n\n22\n00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:14.505\nit's just so much information to absorb.\n\n23\n00:01:14.505 --> 00:01:17.487\nAnd it really is, and\nthe unfortunate thing is that we\n\n24\n00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:21.996\nhave to get through the foundation, you\nhave to understand all of the concepts in\n\n25\n00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:25.734\nthe foundation to be able to then\ndelve deeper into the processes.\n\n26\n00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:31.388\nAnd until we can understand really what\na process is, or really what a functional\n\n27\n00:01:31.388 --> 00:01:37.060\narea is, and what a role should do,\nthen it's difficult to apply that concept.\n\n28\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.960\nAnd so,\nwhat we're learning here is concepts and\n\n29\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.922\nI will admit that there is a lot to learn.\n\n30\n00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:44.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Jo, so\n\n31\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.920\njust take us a little bit through\nwhat we reviewed last time.\n\n32\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.750\nAnd then where we're going\nto be heading from there.\n\n33\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.313\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in part one we actually\nlooked at the concept of a service.\n\n34\n00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.284\nAnd the concept of a service is,\n\n35\n00:01:56.284 --> 00:02:01.029\na service is a means of delivering value\nby facilitating the outcomes that our\n\n36\n00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:05.857\ncustomers want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n37\n00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:11.790\nNow value is perceived, as I mentioned, we\nall have a different perception of value.\n\n38\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.460\nAnd even in a business environment, our\nperception of value is still different.\n\n39\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.320\nNo matter how much we'd like to try and\ndeliver a one size fits all approach to\n\n40\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.590\nour services, to our business, we can't\ndo that because value is perceived.\n\n41\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.410\nSo we looked at that and we looked\nat the fact that service management,\n\n42\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.431\nwhich ITIL is a framework, is a set of set\nof specialized organizational capabilities\n\n43\n00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:42.410\nfor delivering value to customers\nin the form or goods and services.\n\n44\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.220\nNow I know that I've just rattled off two\ndescriptions, two definitions to you, and\n\n45\n00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.760\nnow that's made me look like\na bit of a nerd [LAUGH].\n\n46\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.189\nI'm fully aware of that, okay.\n\n47\n00:02:54.189 --> 00:03:00.909\nWe also noted the concept of value being\nbroken down into utility and warranty.\n\n48\n00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.509\nAnd the fact that it's not just about us\nbeing able to do what it says on the can,\n\n49\n00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.314\nwe've gotta be able to send and\nreceive email.\n\n50\n00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:14.027\nBut we've gotta do it in a way that we can\nassure our customers of levels of utility,\n\n51\n00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:17.782\nand warranty, and\navailability, and capacity, and\n\n52\n00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:20.410\nservice continuity, and security.\n\n53\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.910\nSo we've gotta need both that utility and\nwarranty to be present in order for\n\n54\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.320\nthem to perceive value.\n\n55\n00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.010\nAnd so in this particular section we're\ngonna start off just by going over\n\n56\n00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.860\nwhat our service assets were.\n\n57\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.580\nI mentioned them in very,\n\n58\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.300\nvery briefly in the last session about\ntangible, and our intangible assets.\n\n59\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.390\nAnd how we use those to\ndeliver our services.\n\n60\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go head and begin then.\n\n61\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.270\nSo where are we picking up from there?\n\n62\n00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.612\n&gt;&gt; So, as I said, we begin with\nour service assets and our assets.\n\n63\n00:03:55.612 --> 00:04:00.542\nSo what we use within our\norganization to deliver value\n\n64\n00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:04.090\nby way of goods or services, as we say.\n\n65\n00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.110\nAnd an asset is described there,\nyou've got some definitions there.\n\n66\n00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.540\nAn asset is described as a resource or\na capability.\n\n67\n00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.540\nAnd a resource is what we\nconsider to be a tangible asset,\n\n68\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.250\nsomething that you touch and feel.\n\n69\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.780\nSuch as, is mentioned there,\nmoney, our infrastructure itself,\n\n70\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.960\nthe software that we have, the actual\ndata that we have, our hardware.\n\n71\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.898\nThese are tangible assets,\n\n72\n00:04:27.898 --> 00:04:32.508\nyou'll notice that people span\nboth capabilities and resources.\n\n73\n00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:36.478\nSo they are tangible assets,\nsomething that you can touch and feel,\n\n74\n00:04:36.478 --> 00:04:41.008\nbut I gave you that warning in that first\nsection, don't you do that too much.\n\n75\n00:04:41.008 --> 00:04:44.787\n[LAUGH] And\nthen people are also intangible assets.\n\n76\n00:04:44.787 --> 00:04:49.909\nAnd you know what, under the intangible\nassets, soft assets, as they're mentioned\n\n77\n00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:55.240\nthere, our capabilities, we've got things\nlike how we're managed, who manages us?\n\n78\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.900\nWe've got the organization itself,\nhow well organized we are.\n\n79\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.750\nIf there's complete chaos going on then\nwe'll never gonna be able to deliver value\n\n80\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.800\nto our customers, are we?\n\n81\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.578\nOur processes have to be efficient and\neffective.\n\n82\n00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:12.125\nAnd if our processes don't do what they're\nsuppose to do, and they're not efficient,\n\n83\n00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:16.489\nand they're not effective, then you know\nwhat, they're not going to deliver value\n\n84\n00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:19.419\nto our business, to our users,\nand then our knowledge.\n\n85\n00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.160\nAnd underneath people we've got\nexperience and skills, too.\n\n86\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.795\nAnd knowledge can be quantified,\nwe should document our knowledge.\n\n87\n00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:32.635\nAnd then it becomes\ninformation that we can\n\n88\n00:05:32.635 --> 00:05:34.705\nput into our knowledge management system.\n\n89\n00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:38.842\nSo our knowledge, though,\nis also our experience, and our skills.\n\n90\n00:05:38.842 --> 00:05:41.877\nAnd believe it or not, our attitude, and\n\n91\n00:05:41.877 --> 00:05:46.647\nattitude fall under the soft assets,\nthe capabilities.\n\n92\n00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:50.476\nMorale, I expect to see morale\nin there as well, which is why,\n\n93\n00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:53.802\nas we've moved through\nthe service operation class,\n\n94\n00:05:53.802 --> 00:05:59.460\nyou'll see that we've put a huge emphasis\non people and on morale and on attitudes.\n\n95\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.210\nAnd on understanding, sort of\norganizational change management and\n\n96\n00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.650\nthe people aspect.\n\n97\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.510\nBecause our people are what's going\nto enable us to deliver value, but\n\n98\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.750\nthey're also what's going to hinder\nus from delivering value too.\n\n99\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.940\nLook at our soft skills,\nlook at our capabilities there.\n\n100\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.560\nAnd how well we are organized.\n\n101\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.590\nWell, that is whilst it might be,\n\n102\n00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.230\nyou might consider it to\nbe driven by management,\n\n103\n00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.660\ncuz management set our organizational\nstructures, but it's also driven by people\n\n104\n00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.950\ntoo, as to how collaborative they\nare within that organization.\n\n105\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.024\nAnd think about our management.\n\n106\n00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:40.400\nI know I asked you, I put you on\nthe spot last time, didn't I, Ronnie?\n\n107\n00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.530\nAnd I said to you, do you get on\nwith your managers all of the time?\n\n108\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.845\nAnd the simple fact of the matter\nis that there are always going\n\n109\n00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:51.465\nto be interpersonal conflicts, there are\nalways going to be interpersonal issues.\n\n110\n00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:56.350\nAnd so we've got to accept that,\nthat even if we've got good management\n\n111\n00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.570\nthen there may be\ninterpersonal issues there.\n\n112\n00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.860\nAnd certainly, I know that we've\nall worked in environments where\n\n113\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.280\nthere may be a siloed\nmentality between teams.\n\n114\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.280\nAnd it doesn't matter how good our\nprocesses are, if our people do not\n\n115\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.350\nhave the right attitude or don't have\nthe right experience to be able to follow\n\n116\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.520\nthose processes,\nthen they're never going to deliver value.\n\n117\n00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.040\nThat's really as simple as that.\n\n118\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.630\nSo people are very, very important\nto this, incredibly important.\n\n119\n00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.240\nSo I mentioned processes, well,\nlet's take a look at a process.\n\n120\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.920\nI have mentioned in other sessions\nthat we look at in service operation\n\n121\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.520\nthat a process is a set\nof structured activities\n\n122\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.630\ndesigned to accomplish\na specific objective.\n\n123\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.700\nAnd it takes an input and\nturns it into an output.\n\n124\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.156\nI think I remember I've said that,\nwe've had that discussion before, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:50.156 --> 00:07:54.845\nSo we are looking to deliver\nvalue to our organization by\n\n126\n00:07:54.845 --> 00:07:57.553\nfacilitating their outcomes.\n\n127\n00:07:57.553 --> 00:08:02.753\nWe can't achieve their outcomes for\nthem, but we can facilitate Them.\n\n128\n00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:08.330\nSo we want to facilitate business process,\nwhich lead to business outcomes,\n\n129\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.920\nand we will use our processes in order\nto support the services that we deliver.\n\n130\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.180\nThen exactly is it says\nin the next slide there.\n\n131\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.080\nSupporting business processes so\n\n132\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.140\nwe use our IT processes to\nsupport business processes.\n\n133\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.120\nNow processes has four characteristics\nis they are written there.\n\n134\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.859\nA process has to be measurable.\n\n135\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.370\nI know that it's something that\nI've mentioned before, but\n\n136\n00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.520\nbecause I think so\nis not a good enough measurement, okay.\n\n137\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.530\nWe have to have tangible metrics that\ntells us whether process is delivering\n\n138\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.520\nvalue or not, whether the process\nis effective and efficient.\n\n139\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.730\nA process has to deliver\na specific result.\n\n140\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.790\nWe have to know what that\nprocess is delivering.\n\n141\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:58.595\nIt has to be defined and it has to\ndeliver that result to a customer.\n\n142\n00:08:58.595 --> 00:09:01.820\nNow, a customer or stakeholder,\n\n143\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.010\nI like to use that word because sometimes\nit's not always our customers that\n\n144\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:11.460\nare raising particular processes or\nthat are triggering processes.\n\n145\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.620\nIf I think of incident management,\n\n146\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.690\nwhich is the ability to\nrestore service operation.\n\n147\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.640\nIts not always customers that\nraise incidents or users, but\n\n148\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.070\nit could be internal IT people as well.\n\n149\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.840\nSo I like to use the word\nstakeholder in there as well.\n\n150\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.580\nWe deliver the specific results\nto a customer or stakeholder.\n\n151\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.970\nBut more importantly, at the bottom there,\n\n152\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.250\nresponding to specific events,\nall processes have to start somewhere.\n\n153\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.190\nSomething is got to start them off.\n\n154\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.500\nOkay, so we call that a trigger,\na trigger to a process.\n\n155\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.320\nNow this next diagram is coming up.\n\n156\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.700\nWe're gonna spend a little\nbit of time on this.\n\n157\n00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:53.220\nBecause I absolutely really love\nthis diagram, I really, really do.\n\n158\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.370\nAnd yet everybody tells me whether\nI look at it I say my goodness.\n\n159\n00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.990\nJo, that looks so messy and yet it really,\nreally explains what a process is.\n\n160\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.617\nNow, I've mentioned that\nthe process will start off with,\n\n161\n00:10:05.617 --> 00:10:09.984\nwell, taking an input and\nturn it into a defined output.\n\n162\n00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:14.963\nOkay, so what we're going to day is\nwe're going to start off with in the top\n\n163\n00:10:14.963 --> 00:10:19.970\nright hand corner here that you can\nsee my arrow, the process objectives.\n\n164\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.390\nAnd I am going to, using incident\nmanagement as an example here.\n\n165\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.460\nAnd the objective of incident\nmanagement is to restore\n\n166\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.660\nnormal service operation\nas quickly as possible.\n\n167\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.410\nSo that means then that the process output\nthen, what do you think that is Ronnie?\n\n168\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.650\nIf the objective is to restore\nnormal service operation,\n\n169\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.760\nwhat do you think the output\nto the process is?\n\n170\n00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.940\n&gt;&gt; Is that the process gets restored?\n\n171\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that the service gets restored.\n\n172\n00:10:47.765 --> 00:10:48.928\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the service gets restored.\n\n173\n00:10:48.928 --> 00:10:52.020\n&gt;&gt; So the output is a fixed,\nit's a fixed service.\n\n174\n00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.750\nIt's been repaired, okay.\n\n175\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.980\nSo it's the output here in process\noutput to something fixed.\n\n176\n00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.260\nAnd what do you think the input is?\n\n177\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.475\n&gt;&gt; Something that is maybe not fixed.\n\n178\n00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:03.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something broken.\n\n179\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.470\n&gt;&gt; Something broken.\n\n180\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.970\n&gt;&gt; I know okay.\n\n181\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.580\nSo what we do then if you notice okay\nwe've got the first three steps of\n\n182\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.790\ndefining a process.\n\n183\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just worked out.\n\n184\n00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.320\nThere and then so we started off in this\ntop right hand corner with our process\n\n185\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.880\nobjectives and then,\nwe looked at our process outputs,\n\n186\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.410\nwhich was something broken, and\nthe inputs, something fixed.\n\n187\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:30.140\nAnd here in this middle box, we've\ngot all of the actual process itself.\n\n188\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.580\nWe've got the activities, and\nthe procedures and the work instructions,\n\n189\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.240\nthat will get us from broken to fixed.\n\n190\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.570\nIt will get us from here to here.\n\n191\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.770\nWe also have identified here\nwhat we call process roles.\n\n192\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.740\nThese are what roles and\n\n193\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.420\nwhat skills we need in order to\nget us from broken to fixed.\n\n194\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.790\nWe also have process metrics and\n\n195\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.870\nthat will tell us whether we\nare getting from broken to fixed.\n\n196\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:05.395\nNow, we'll have a policy and here in\nthis process control box at the top,\n\n197\n00:12:05.395 --> 00:12:08.791\nwe've got this policy that\ntells us what our ethics are,\n\n198\n00:12:08.791 --> 00:12:12.069\nwhat our way of working is and\nhow we're going to do it.\n\n199\n00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:14.455\nBecause I've just mentioned\nincident management, but\n\n200\n00:12:14.455 --> 00:12:17.430\ndon't forget we do this for\nevery single process.\n\n201\n00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:22.610\nWe have a defined process owner, somebody\nwho takes ownership of that process and\n\n202\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.020\nwho ensures that process is documented.\n\n203\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.650\nNow, I wanna bring you down to here,\nwhere it says process improvement.\n\n204\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.760\nAnd notice we have an arrow going\ndirectly from our outputs to\n\n205\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.370\nfeedback and\nthat's what we call our feedback loop.\n\n206\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:46.030\nAnd our feedback then comes down and\ncomes in to process improvement.\n\n207\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.150\nIn other words, so\nwhen we restore service,\n\n208\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.910\nwe're going to conduct a survey,\nhopefully,\n\n209\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.370\nwith our customers to see whether they\nhave actually had their service restored.\n\n210\n00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.160\nAnd we'll also conduct a lessons learned.\n\n211\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.150\nWhat worked well?\n\n212\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.010\nAnd we'll use that to improve\nour process in the future.\n\n213\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.870\nWe also conduct a lessons learned\nwith what didn't work so well, too.\n\n214\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.420\nAnd we use that to improve,\nagain, in the future.\n\n215\n00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.400\nNow let's bring you down to this\nblue box at the bottom, here.\n\n216\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.800\nAnd you'll notice you see two familiar\nwords in here, the words resources and\n\n217\n00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.250\ncapabilities.\n\n218\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.230\nSo these are the people and\nthe tools and the experience and\n\n219\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.860\nthe hardware and the PCs,\netc, that they use in\n\n220\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.080\norder to get us from something\nbroken to something fixed.\n\n221\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.120\nNow, there's one thing I haven't\nmentioned and that's this.\n\n222\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.220\nThe trigger.\n\n223\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.215\nAnd I said to you that,\nhere we go, there's my arrow.\n\n224\n00:13:45.215 --> 00:13:49.050\n[LAUGH] I said to you that every\nprocess has to have a trigger,\n\n225\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.520\nsomething that started it off.\n\n226\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.320\nIncident management doesn't just happen.\n\n227\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.797\nSo, that trigger could be something\nlike an event that's occurred\n\n228\n00:13:57.797 --> 00:14:01.724\nthat's been notified to us\nthrough an event management and\n\n229\n00:14:01.724 --> 00:14:05.349\nthey've automatically raised an incident,\nsorry.\n\n230\n00:14:05.349 --> 00:14:10.725\nOr that trigger could be somebody calling\nthe service desk or somebody picking\n\n231\n00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:16.032\nup their cellphone and logging a call\nvia the app to raise an incident, okay.\n\n232\n00:14:16.032 --> 00:14:20.019\nThat's the trigger and all processes have\nto have a trigger although some of those\n\n233\n00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:21.420\ntriggers can be automated.\n\n234\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.062\nOkay so function or\nfunctional area as we like to call it,\n\n235\n00:14:27.062 --> 00:14:30.177\nwell let's go back to that previous slide.\n\n236\n00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:34.679\nIn that previous slide we have this\nblue box and that blue box represents\n\n237\n00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:39.572\nthe resources and the capabilities that\nwe needed to undertake the process.\n\n238\n00:14:39.572 --> 00:14:44.773\nWell, we have what we call teams of\npeople, groups of people, we call\n\n239\n00:14:44.773 --> 00:14:50.750\nthem functions and we use all these\nfunctions to carry out those processes.\n\n240\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:56.120\nIn other words, that blue box represents\nthe role of our functional areas and\n\n241\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:02.630\nwe can structure our functions into groups\nand teams and departments and divisions.\n\n242\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.880\nWe can do whatever we want in regards to\nthe structure of our IT organization.\n\n243\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.980\nRemember, we've got to deliver\nvalue to our organization.\n\n244\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:17.120\nAnd so it really is down to us how we\nstructure ourselves to deliver that value.\n\n245\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.260\nITIL is not a prescription.\n\n246\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.600\nIt's not a one size fits all pill that\ngoing to resolve any issues that you might\n\n247\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.470\nhave within IT.\n\n248\n00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.580\nAnd it's certainly not gonna tell you\nhow you need to structure yourself.\n\n249\n00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.800\nNow as we move through the other\nservice operation modules,\n\n250\n00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.460\nyou'll see that there\nare various ways to structure.\n\n251\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.818\nAnd if we go in to service strategy and\nlook through the service strategy\n\n252\n00:15:40.818 --> 00:15:44.159\nlifecycle, you'll see that\nthere is an evolution for\n\n253\n00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:48.733\nthe structure of an IT organization and\nwe certainly go in to a lot more depth\n\n254\n00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:52.683\nof structures in the service\nstrategy lifecycle phase, okay.\n\n255\n00:15:52.683 --> 00:15:55.442\nSo a function then is\na group of people and\n\n256\n00:15:55.442 --> 00:15:58.860\nthe tools that they use\nthe skills that they have.\n\n257\n00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.777\nI like to refer to them\nmore as functional areas.\n\n258\n00:16:01.777 --> 00:16:05.646\nBecause as I said, we don't have\n\n259\n00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:10.630\na prescriptive answer to your structure.\n\n260\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.810\nYour structure will be how you\nwant your structure to look.\n\n261\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.410\nSo, within every single process, and\nI already mentioned, and if I just,\n\n262\n00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.250\nI'm gonna jump back now to\nthis particular process model.\n\n263\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.710\nYou'll see that we have\nthat red box at the top.\n\n264\n00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.273\nAnd that red box is our Process Control.\n\n265\n00:16:29.273 --> 00:16:32.283\nAnd so with every single process we have,\n\n266\n00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:35.646\nin the top left hand corner,\na Process Owner.\n\n267\n00:16:35.646 --> 00:16:39.905\nNow, if we were to use\nsomething called a racy matrix,\n\n268\n00:16:39.905 --> 00:16:45.210\nwhich we cover in great depth\nin service foundation itself,\n\n269\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.377\nWell, you'll see that we have\na roll call accountability, and\n\n270\n00:16:49.377 --> 00:16:53.710\naccountability is where the box\nstops if we wanna use that saying.\n\n271\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:17:01.310\nAccountable means somebody who takes\nownership of a particular process.\n\n272\n00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:06.600\nAnd ensures that it's performed according\nto, not just the documented processes,\n\n273\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.870\nbut also any service level\ntargets that may exist.\n\n274\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:14.940\nSo when you see the word accountable,\nI want you to use the word ensured,\n\n275\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.350\nas part of that sort of, relationship\nthat goes on in your mind, okay?\n\n276\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.019\nSo, accountable means ensured.\n\n277\n00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:27.800\nSo the process owner ensures that\nall of those bullet points happen.\n\n278\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.920\nHe takes accountability for ensuring\nthat all of those bullet points happen.\n\n279\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.780\nYou know what?\n\n280\n00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:39.500\nHe may delegate the responsibility\nto do that to the process manager.\n\n281\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.860\nBut the fact is that he\nensures that it happens.\n\n282\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.408\nHe doesn't necessarily\nhave to do it all himself.\n\n283\n00:17:47.408 --> 00:17:51.097\nNow the Process Manager is accountable for\nmore basically,\n\n284\n00:17:51.097 --> 00:17:53.760\nwhatever the process only tells him.\n\n285\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.128\nBut now,\nthe Process Manager is accountable for\n\n286\n00:17:56.128 --> 00:17:58.960\nthe day-to-day operations of the process.\n\n287\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.433\nSo, if you look at the bullet points here,\nhe's reviewing KPI's, he's making sure\n\n288\n00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:07.697\neverybody's got the right skills, he is\ngoing to monitor on performance, He is\n\n289\n00:18:07.697 --> 00:18:13.043\ngoing to make sure we've got enough people\nto be able to perform the process and\n\n290\n00:18:13.043 --> 00:18:17.430\nhe's also going to be providing\nfeedback to the Process Owner.\n\n291\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.820\nSo the Process Owner is a figurehead but\nis also somebody who\n\n292\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.960\nensures that we've got the policies,\nthat we've got the right documentation.\n\n293\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.280\nHe takes accountability for publishing\nthe process, etc., and even improving it.\n\n294\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.070\nBut the Process Manager manages\nthe process on a day-to-day basis.\n\n295\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.864\nI want you to think about\nincident management again and\n\n296\n00:18:40.864 --> 00:18:43.058\nI want you to think\nabout the service desk.\n\n297\n00:18:43.058 --> 00:18:44.444\nAnd what we may have,\n\n298\n00:18:44.444 --> 00:18:49.813\nespecially in a service desk where we have\nmultiple shifts, We will have a service\n\n299\n00:18:49.813 --> 00:18:55.190\ndesk manager who sits in an overall\naccountability for the service desk.\n\n300\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:00.170\nWe would consider them to be the incident\nmanagement Process Owner, takes ownership\n\n301\n00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:06.130\nfor the entire service desk, and\ntherefore for incident management, period.\n\n302\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.230\nAnd then we've got the Process Manager, so\n\n303\n00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.401\nthink of these as your shift leaders,\nokay?\n\n304\n00:19:10.401 --> 00:19:11.420\nYour team leaders.\n\n305\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.780\nThey are the people that\nmanage the service desk and\n\n306\n00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.630\nmanage incident management\non that middle level, okay?\n\n307\n00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.340\nOn a day-to-day basis,\non a team-by-team basis.\n\n308\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.300\nAnd then we have what we call\nthe Process Practitioners.\n\n309\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.550\nAnd for incident management,\nthat would be the service desk analysts.\n\n310\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.670\nAnd they are the people\nthat carry out one or\n\n311\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.260\nmore of those process activities,\nworking with other stakeholders.\n\n312\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.650\nStakeholders, remember from a previous\nsession, is any interested party.\n\n313\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.787\nSo a stakeholder can be a user,\na customer, it can be your colleague,\n\n314\n00:19:43.787 --> 00:19:45.852\nIt could be somebody in a second level or\n\n315\n00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:49.780\nthird level support team,\nsomebody that you escalate to.\n\n316\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.400\nOne thing that a Process Practitioner\nhas to do, though,\n\n317\n00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.055\na Process Practitioner has to ensure the\nprocess documentation is kept up-to-date.\n\n318\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:06.309\nI've mentioned, as we move into the actual\nprocesses within service operation, I've\n\n319\n00:20:06.309 --> 00:20:11.330\nmentioned that in incident management,\nAll incidents have to be logged.\n\n320\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.110\nAnd you know what?\n\n321\n00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.590\nThat is the responsibility\nof the Process Practitioner,\n\n322\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.930\nto ensure that all incidents are logged.\n\n323\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.150\nAnd that's not just for\nincident management, by the way,\n\n324\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.110\nthat's for every single process too.\n\n325\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.270\nThere has to be relevant documentation\nto ensure that the process is happening.\n\n326\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.820\nOtherwise, the Process Owner has\ngot absolutely nothing to go on.\n\n327\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.211\nAnd then we're back to that,\nwell because I think so\n\n328\n00:20:37.211 --> 00:20:42.600\nin metric, when somebody says is\nthe process effective or is it efficient.\n\n329\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.190\nAnd because I think so,\nit's just not good enough.\n\n330\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.580\nSo let's move on from processes then.\n\n331\n00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.880\nAnd then just to wrap this session up,\n\n332\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.380\nlet's take a look at\nthe services themself, okay?\n\n333\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:59.950\nEvery single service must\nhave a Service Owner.\n\n334\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.043\nThat is a Service Owner within IT.\n\n335\n00:21:03.043 --> 00:21:06.546\nThere's an important\ndifferentiation there, okay?\n\n336\n00:21:06.546 --> 00:21:12.160\nThat Service Owner takes accountability\nfor the entire IT service.\n\n337\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:18.400\nAs we move through into service operation,\nand as we've looked previously at the life\n\n338\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:25.300\ncycle phases within IT, You'll see\nthat there were 20 odd processes,\n\n339\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:30.200\nwell that service owner does not take\naccountability for all of those processes.\n\n340\n00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.433\nThat service owner takes\naccountability for the service, and\n\n341\n00:21:33.433 --> 00:21:36.243\nthat diagram in the bottom\nright-hand corner there,\n\n342\n00:21:36.243 --> 00:21:42.420\nYou will see that each process\napplies to each service.\n\n343\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.542\nSo if we looked at Process 1 and we said\nthat that was incident management, Well,\n\n344\n00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:49.232\nincident management applies\nto every single service.\n\n345\n00:21:49.232 --> 00:21:52.588\nAnd problem management applies\nto every single service, and\n\n346\n00:21:52.588 --> 00:21:55.980\nrequest fulfillment applies\nto every single service.\n\n347\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.655\nBut, you will notice that each\nservice is separate, and so\n\n348\n00:22:00.655 --> 00:22:05.998\neach service or each silo as it is there,\nwill have a Service Owner,\n\n349\n00:22:05.998 --> 00:22:11.360\nAnd we use that word accountable again and\nwe use the word ensure.\n\n350\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.890\nThey ensure that value is\ndelivered to the organization.\n\n351\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.350\nSo they liaise with the Process Owners,\nbut\n\n352\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.930\nthey liaise with business\nrelationship management.\n\n353\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:25.062\nThey will liaise with our organization,\n\n354\n00:22:25.062 --> 00:22:29.361\nand they will be present in\nour service review meetings,\n\n355\n00:22:29.361 --> 00:22:34.148\nWhich is where we review performance\nagainst those service level targets,\n\n356\n00:22:34.148 --> 00:22:38.370\nand service level management,\nand with our customer as well.\n\n357\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.975\nSo I expect the Service Owner\nto be present for that.\n\n358\n00:22:40.975 --> 00:22:45.518\nUltimately, the Service Owner takes\naccountability for a service.\n\n359\n00:22:45.518 --> 00:22:50.731\nSo in this particular section here then,\nwell in the last two sections,\n\n360\n00:22:50.731 --> 00:22:55.649\nWe've done a very, very brief\noverview of some of the fundamentals\n\n361\n00:22:55.649 --> 00:22:59.199\nthat we learned within\nour IT foundation class.\n\n362\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.790\nNow, I do understand that there\nis a lot to learn there, so\n\n363\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.580\nplease feel free to browse further,\n\n364\n00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:13.173\nthe ITIL Foundation material that\nis available here through ITPRo.TV.\n\n365\n00:23:13.173 --> 00:23:17.340\nBut what I would ask you to do now\nis obviously to move into your\n\n366\n00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.669\nservice operation material, And\n\n367\n00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:23.600\nto take a look at all of our\nother service operation modules.\n\n368\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.550\nAll right Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us out and reminding us of some of\n\n369\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.340\nthose foundational concepts that we may be\na little bit weak on, But now with this\n\n370\n00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:37.440\nrefresher, it means we're ready to\nhead on to our ITIL intermediate show.\n\n371\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520\nWell, great place for us to sign off then.\n\n372\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.551\nFor ITPRo.TV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n373\n00:23:43.551 --> 00:23:47.036\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right now for\nyour ITIL Intermediate introduction.\n\n374\n00:23:48.699 --> 00:23:54.351\n[MUSIC]\n\n375\n00:23:54.351 -->

00:00:08.454\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:10.679\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.467\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:15.490\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.240\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.230\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and\n\n9\n00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.400\ntoday, we're diving into\nprinciples of service operation.\n\n10\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.800\nAnd here to help us is gonna be our ITIL\nkung fu master herself, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.450\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.100\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, great to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.193\n&gt;&gt; All right, so as we begin to take\na look at the idea, the principles here,\n\n14\n00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:43.800\nwhat are we really going to try to dive\ninto in terms of the different principles?\n\n15\n00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.030\nAre there a lot that we\nhave to worry about.\n\n16\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.030\n&gt;&gt; Not too many.\n\n17\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.850\nWhat we need to do is understand.\n\n18\n00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.920\nIn the last episode,\nwe explored the idea of value and\n\n19\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.530\nthe fact that value diminishes\nover time and so what we're\n\n20\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.120\ngoing to do in this particular episode is\njust explore that factor even further.\n\n21\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.440\nSo we're going to look at how\nwe actually maintain value.\n\n22\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.780\nAnd that's what we are gonna be\nfocusing on over the next few moments.\n\n23\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.040\n&gt;&gt; All right so Jo,\nwhen you talk about this idea of value and\n\n24\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.120\nits diminishing over time,\nwhich apparently I can't say here, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.730\nWhat are some of the factors that\nwe're really gonna have to consider\n\n26\n00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.795\nwhen we start doing it?\n\n27\n00:01:21.795 --> 00:01:24.990\nYou've mentioned in a previous\nepisode that we do have to worry about\n\n28\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.650\nthe very fact that there are things that\nactually degrade or devalue over time or\n\n29\n00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.660\nlong period of time and then some that\nactually kind of very quickly happen.\n\n30\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.850\nWhat are some of the other\nprinciples we have to worry about?\n\n31\n00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.420\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nlet's take a look at our first slide\n\n32\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.010\nthat we have in front of us right now,\nwhere, that first statement is so true.\n\n33\n00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.820\nAnd it's so true nowadays in this 21st\ncentury that all businesses face change.\n\n34\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.660\nBut it's not just that they face change,\nit's they will change.\n\n35\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.860\nBusinesses will change.\n\n36\n00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.720\nLife will change.\n\n37\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.250\nTechnology will change.\n\n38\n00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.590\nAnd in fact, it's the only thing\nthat's fairly inevitable about IT,\n\n39\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.435\nis that IT is going to change.\n\n40\n00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:08.475\nNow we explored in the last episode\nabout the value diminishes over time.\n\n41\n00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:13.030\nWell now we're going to tie that in with\nthe fact that business requirements change\n\n42\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.200\ntoo.\n\n43\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.060\nSo it's not the fact that you\nbought a cell phone last year,\n\n44\n00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.160\nas we mentioned in the last episode and\nnow you don't perceive as much value in\n\n45\n00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.440\nthat cellphone because there's a new\none come out to the marketplace.\n\n46\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.529\nTie that in with the fact that maybe your\nrequirements have changed and no longer do\n\n47\n00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.921\nyou just need to be able to make\na phone call and receive a phone call.\n\n48\n00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:35.892\nNow you want to be able to do\nsomething else with it as well.\n\n49\n00:02:35.892 --> 00:02:40.805\nMaybe now you want to live stream,\nI don't know, a course online?\n\n50\n00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:41.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n51\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n52\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.242\nSo you're requirements change over time as\nwell as your perception of value changes\n\n53\n00:02:47.242 --> 00:02:48.420\nover time.\n\n54\n00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.340\nSo it mentions in our particular\nslide here while the value or\n\n55\n00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.820\nthe challenge being\ncompounded by balance issues.\n\n56\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.660\nNow, don't worry I'm not going\nto do anything as dramatic as\n\n57\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.685\nwhat you can see on that\nphotograph in the slide there.\n\n58\n00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:04.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Trust me,\n\n59\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.860\nwe wouldn't wanna do that, but let's\ntake a look at the value of the balances\n\n60\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.680\nthat we have to maintain within IT.\n\n61\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.160\nAnd the first one is the balance on\nexternal versus the balance on internal.\n\n62\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.380\nAn organization and I don't just mean IT,\nI mean an organization as a whole.\n\n63\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.750\nAn organization as a whole that's very,\nvery focused on an internal perspective.\n\n64\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.669\nThat looks very, very much at\nmaintaining customer satisfaction for\n\n65\n00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.600\nthis current customers that they have.\n\n66\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.640\nWell, if you maintain\nan internal perspective,\n\n67\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.240\nyou get very, very good at what you do.\n\n68\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.280\nYou're very,\nvery efficient of what you do.\n\n69\n00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.800\nBut before you've noticed,\nthe rest of the world has moved on.\n\n70\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.252\nWe can all think of technology companies\nwhere that's happened exactly to them.\n\n71\n00:03:56.252 --> 00:04:00.340\nWhether it become completely\nfocused on their core business and\n\n72\n00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.990\nwhat they actually do as a USP.\n\n73\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.990\nWithout realizing that the rest\nof the world has moved on.\n\n74\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.035\nAnd so that's an organization\nthat focuses on the internal and\n\n75\n00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:13.655\nthen you've got other organizations\nthat are considered to be drivers and\n\n76\n00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:15.620\nthat they focus on the external.\n\n77\n00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.440\nYou might consider them to be innovators,\nfor instance, in technology.\n\n78\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.952\nWell, an organization that's an innovator\nsometimes forgets what's happening back\n\n79\n00:04:25.952 --> 00:04:27.260\nat base.\n\n80\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.520\nAnd so we have to maintain that balance\nand here in IT, we have to support that\n\n81\n00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.160\nand we have to maintain that balance\nwith our service operations.\n\n82\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.400\nWe can't everybody going out and\nplaying with new toys.\n\n83\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.720\nWe can't have everybody being innovators.\n\n84\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.160\nSomebody still has to\nmaintain the status quo.\n\n85\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.570\nSomebody still has to ensure\nthat our services keep running.\n\n86\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.080\nBut the fact that our services\nare running cannot be the only focus.\n\n87\n00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.340\nSo we can't just focus on the internal,\n\n88\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.180\nwe have to look to the future and\nthe fact that things are going to change.\n\n89\n00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.150\nAnd that ties us into the next one,\n\n90\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.820\nwhich is the focus on\nResponsiveness versus Stability.\n\n91\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.540\nYou see, an organization that\ncan be quite introspective and\n\n92\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.440\nquite internally focused,\ntends to look for stability.\n\n93\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.610\nAnd stability means minimal change.\n\n94\n00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.370\nIt means, I don't want to change anything\non our infrastructure right now,\n\n95\n00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.930\nbecause there's a risk involved.\n\n96\n00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.350\nSo they tend to be risk-averse.\n\n97\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.710\nWhereas an IT organization that wants\nto be responsive to the business needs,\n\n98\n00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.610\nwell that means frequent change.\n\n99\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.130\nAnd let's face it,\nwe don't like frequent change.\n\n100\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.570\nIt can be very unstable.\n\n101\n00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.560\nAnd actually, what happens is we end up\nlooking as though, from an IT perspective,\n\n102\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.230\nwe're very disorganized in the way\nwe manage our IT services.\n\n103\n00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.510\nBecause quite often,\n\n104\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.240\nan IT service provider that is very\nresponsive to the business needs,\n\n105\n00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.585\nis asked the question, well can you\nnot tie these changes in together?\n\n106\n00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:02.600\nCould you not just do one change per\nmonth rather than one every day?\n\n107\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.100\nThat would be really good because\nit's less disruptive to us.\n\n108\n00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.030\nSo we want to be responsive, but\nwe still have to maintain stability.\n\n109\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.780\nAnd then you've got\nthe Cost versus Quality.\n\n110\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.650\nNow this is one that we can all relate to,\nbecause we all go grocery shopping.\n\n111\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.720\nOkay.\nWe all go shopping for food.\n\n112\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.470\nAnd we all make that decision every\ntime we walk into a grocery store.\n\n113\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.490\nWe say, okay, there is an assumption\nthat if we buy what we would consider to\n\n114\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:37.075\nbe the value line brand of a particular\ncommodity, whatever that may be.\n\n115\n00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:41.665\nThat, if we buy that, then we're\ngoing to suffer on quality, whereas,\n\n116\n00:06:41.665 --> 00:06:45.725\nif we buy a branded version,\nthen the quality will be better.\n\n117\n00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:47.165\nIt's an assumption we make.\n\n118\n00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:49.745\nAnd it's not necessarily\na true assumption.\n\n119\n00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:52.025\nBut it's nevertheless\nan assumption that we make.\n\n120\n00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.920\nSome organizations are very,\nwhat we would call, cash rich and\n\n121\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.010\ntherefore they think that if\nwe can just invest more and\n\n122\n00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.680\nmore money into IT then therefore\nwe're going to get quality.\n\n123\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.060\nThat's not necessarily the case.\n\n124\n00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.270\nSo we have to get that balance right.\n\n125\n00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.050\nUnderstanding that quality does cost but\n\n126\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.220\nat the same time, you can carry on\nthrowing money at IT services and\n\n127\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.800\nif they're failing, it doesn't matter\nhow much money you throw at them.\n\n128\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.170\nThey're still going to fail.\n\n129\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.250\nBut then, of course, if we don't\nhave any money available to us,\n\n130\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.280\nthen our services are never\ngoing to deliver value.\n\n131\n00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.550\nSo again,\nwe have to get that balance right.\n\n132\n00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.464\nSo if you take a look at\nthe graph in front of you,\n\n133\n00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:39.806\nyou'll see that actually where we\nwant to be is we want to be in\n\n134\n00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:44.766\na position where we have the right\nbalance between cost and quality.\n\n135\n00:07:44.766 --> 00:07:51.942\nIf we look at that particular graph and we\nlook at the middle section in that graph,\n\n136\n00:07:51.942 --> 00:07:57.768\nwe want to see that cost is decreasing but\nquality is still rising.\n\n137\n00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:01.777\nAnd it's a common misconception, again,\nas I said, when we walk into the grocery\n\n138\n00:08:01.777 --> 00:08:05.768\nstore, that the more money we put into our\nour IT, then the better our IT will get.\n\n139\n00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:10.553\nAnd we've gotta be in a position\nwhere we're continually improving IT,\n\n140\n00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:12.260\nand IT is getting better.\n\n141\n00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:17.991\nBut we're not spending as much money as we\nexpected to spend, that we're actually,\n\n142\n00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:22.090\nhopefully, maintaining\nthe status quo with our budget..\n\n143\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.039\nBut you never know, we could even be\nreducing it as we get more efficient in\n\n144\n00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:28.790\nsupporting those services and\ndelivering value.\n\n145\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:35.662\nThe other thing that we have to take\ninto consideration, and this particular\n\n146\n00:08:35.662 --> 00:08:40.383\nslide here looks at the amount of\ninformation that we have access to.\n\n147\n00:08:40.383 --> 00:08:43.563\nYou see,\nif you look on the left-hand side,\n\n148\n00:08:43.563 --> 00:08:47.345\nyou have what we call our\ndecision-making quality.\n\n149\n00:08:47.345 --> 00:08:52.098\nAnd there is an assumption that if\nsomebody has a lot of information at their\n\n150\n00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:55.417\nfingertips, if their service will do x,\ny, and z,\n\n151\n00:08:55.417 --> 00:08:58.710\nthen that means it's a better service,\nright?\n\n152\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.417\nSo we're putting more money into it,\nwe're getting more functionality, and\n\n153\n00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.560\nit's going to be a better service.\n\n154\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.120\nBut like I said, that's an assumption, and\n\n155\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.930\nsometimes what you get what\nwe call information overload.\n\n156\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:16.060\nI'm going to go back to the example I used\nin the previous section, where I said,\n\n157\n00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.160\nwhat about that cellphone\nthat you bought last year?\n\n158\n00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.952\nAnd so Ronnie,\nI'm going to ask you a direct question.\n\n159\n00:09:20.952 --> 00:09:22.620\nThe cellphone that you have right now,\n\n160\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.390\nhow much of the functionality of\nthat cellphone do you actually use?\n\n161\n00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.053\nI probably just use about a quarter of it,\nmore than anything else, right,\n\n162\n00:09:30.053 --> 00:09:33.450\nI check some emails, I check Facebook,\nI do a little bit of browsing.\n\n163\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.720\nThere are some other things I do,\nI play some games on it, but overall,\n\n164\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.620\nthough, I probably don't use\nevery bit of the functionality.\n\n165\n00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.980\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's what we, in ITIL\nterms, would consider to be information\n\n166\n00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.260\noverload, or functionality overload,\nin that we have bought a new product.\n\n167\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.590\nWe have brought in some innovation,\nsome new technology, but\n\n168\n00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.120\nactually, we brought in more than we need.\n\n169\n00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.330\nAnd this is addressed in the service\nstrategy life cycle phase,\n\n170\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.408\nwhere we look at the relationship\nbetween IT and the business.\n\n171\n00:10:02.408 --> 00:10:03.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n172\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.600\n&gt;&gt; How often has a business user, or\nwhat we would consider to be an internal\n\n173\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.585\ncustomer, sat there at their screen and\nsaid, do you know what, I don't need this.\n\n174\n00:10:13.585 --> 00:10:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n175\n00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.600\n&gt;&gt; There's too much here for\nme for me to do.\n\n176\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.520\nI cannot work with this,\nit's too cumbersome, it's too complicated.\n\n177\n00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.850\nI don't need all the functionality,\nI need something simple.\n\n178\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:29.150\nAnd so one of the principles of ITIL\nis that keep it simple approach,\n\n179\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.050\nit's the very simple\napproach to providing value.\n\n180\n00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.890\nSo again, when we look at our balances,\n\n181\n00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.580\nwe have to think about\nreactive versus proactive, and\n\n182\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.840\nwe've mentioned this when we talked\nabout responsiveness versus stability.\n\n183\n00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.340\nAre we a reactive service provider, or\nare we a proactive service provider?\n\n184\n00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.690\nThe service provider, the IT service\nprovider that the business most values,\n\n185\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.570\nis one that can get the balance right.\n\n186\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.944\nAre we constantly responding to\nthe needs of the organization,\n\n187\n00:11:01.944 --> 00:11:04.541\nthe can I have this and can I have that?\n\n188\n00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:07.167\nCuz that's not a particularly efficient,\nand\n\n189\n00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:11.390\nthe two tenets of ITIL are about\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n\n190\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.910\nWe want to be efficient, and efficiency\nmeans minimal waste, in terms of time,\n\n191\n00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.670\nin terms of money,\nin terms of skills as well.\n\n192\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:25.045\nIf we're reacting,\nwe're constantly firefighting.\n\n193\n00:11:25.045 --> 00:11:29.737\nAnd if we're reacting to the can I have\nthis technology, then that means that us\n\n194\n00:11:29.737 --> 00:11:34.569\nin IT have to go away and learn about that\nnew technology, and maybe even integrate\n\n195\n00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:38.960\nit into our current infrastructure\nbefore we can give it to our business.\n\n196\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.279\nHow long does that take us?\n\n197\n00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:41.800\nIt could take us quite some time.\n\n198\n00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.960\nSo what we want to do is put some focus,\nnot all of the focus,\n\n199\n00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.950\nwe want to put some focus on\nthe proactiveness of our service delivery,\n\n200\n00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.970\nand we've got a process\nthat does exactly this.\n\n201\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:00.282\nThe business relationship management\nprocess will sit amongst our organization,\n\n202\n00:12:00.282 --> 00:12:04.270\nand we'll say, I see that you're\nstruggling, performing a certain task.\n\n203\n00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.400\nDo you know what, we've got something\nthat can help you with that.\n\n204\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.520\nAnd because it's proactive, because it's\nsomething that's come from within IT,\n\n205\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.440\nit means that we're already prepared for\nthis new technology, we know about it.\n\n206\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.450\nIt may already be integrated into our\ninfrastructure, and it may be very\n\n207\n00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.970\nseamless to just slot it in, so\nwe're delivering value to the business.\n\n208\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.816\nNow, we still have to react,\nwe can't be completely 100% proactive,\n\n209\n00:12:31.816 --> 00:12:33.120\ncuz things change.\n\n210\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.790\nSo we have to get that balance\nright between being proactive and\n\n211\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.950\nbeing reactive.\n\n212\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.059\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo, when you take a look at that,\nI think, at least, from my perspective,\n\n213\n00:12:44.059 --> 00:12:49.100\nthose two terms, especially, not the other\nterms that we looked at in balance, but\n\n214\n00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:54.141\nthe term reactive, versus proactive today,\nreactive just tends to have a negative\n\n215\n00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:58.772\nconnotation to it, even in the IT world,\nversus the idea of proactive here.\n\n216\n00:12:58.772 --> 00:13:02.270\nSo trying to keep a balance is\nprobably the right approach.\n\n217\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.010\nBut at the same time, we all tend to\ngravitate towards that terminology that we\n\n218\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.400\nuse as being more positive,\nrather than the idea that\n\n219\n00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.290\nreactive is always something bad and\nproactive is always something good.\n\n220\n00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.830\nSo I like the point that you made there.\n\n221\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.810\n&gt;&gt; It is about achieving a balance, and\n\n222\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.560\nit's about understanding that\nreactive is not necessarily wrong.\n\n223\n00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And even I used the words,\n\n224\n00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.400\nmyself, firefighting,\nwhich has a very negative connotation.\n\n225\n00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.060\nAnd firefighting is not just\nabout putting out fires,\n\n226\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.220\nit's also about fire prevention,\ntoo, and that's where we have to be.\n\n227\n00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.999\nWe have to get that balance right,\nbecause things change, and\n\n228\n00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:41.652\nwe have to react to change.\n\n229\n00:13:41.652 --> 00:13:42.848\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n230\n00:13:42.848 --> 00:13:47.030\n&gt;&gt; But when we think about reactive,\nwe think about reacting to disasters.\n\n231\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n232\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.500\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's something that we want to avoid.\n\n233\n00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.271\nWe want to be able to react to change, but\n\n234\n00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:57.418\nwe don't want to just react to the\ndisasters, and we want to be proactive.\n\n235\n00:13:57.418 --> 00:14:02.108\n&gt;&gt; All right, so in ITIL, the goal of the\nbalance is to almost remove that negative\n\n236\n00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:06.868\nconnotation, and achieve the balances that\nwe need to on all the different terms\n\n237\n00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:10.700\nthat we've been mentioning,\nbut on that one especially.\n\n238\n00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.126\nLike I said, in the last ten years,\nwhen you hear about that,\n\n239\n00:14:13.126 --> 00:14:16.310\nyou're just reacting to everything,\nit always is that negative connotation.\n\n240\n00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.942\nAnd it's hard to overcome that,\n\n241\n00:14:17.942 --> 00:14:20.916\neven though there are frameworks\nin place that are there, so\n\n242\n00:14:20.916 --> 00:14:24.550\ntrying to achieve that balance is\nprobably gonna be harder than we think.\n\n243\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.331\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first bullet point\non the next slide, actually,\n\n244\n00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:30.549\njust outlines exactly that,\nbecause it just tells us, very simply,\n\n245\n00:14:30.549 --> 00:14:32.746\nall IT staff are there\nto support the business.\n\n246\n00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:38.620\nWe're there to deliver a service,\nespecially these within service operation.\n\n247\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.405\nWe are there to deliver value,\nwe're not there to hinder,\n\n248\n00:14:42.405 --> 00:14:44.320\n[LAUGH] we're there to deliver value.\n\n249\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.290\nWe're not there to put in obstacles,\nwe're there to remove barriers, and\n\n250\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.970\npart of that could be\nthe psychological barriers.\n\n251\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:56.848\nDid you ever consider the concept that\nevery single interaction that a business\n\n252\n00:14:56.848 --> 00:15:00.213\nhas with the service desk\nhas a negative connotation?\n\n253\n00:15:00.213 --> 00:15:00.934\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n254\n00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:01.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It has a negative focus.\n\n255\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nnow that you say that, yeah.\n\n256\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.690\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou imagine being a service desk analyst.\n\n257\n00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.150\nAs a service desk analyst,\nyou come in and you do your shift, and\n\n258\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.380\nevery single interaction that you\nhave is a negative interaction.\n\n259\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.940\n&gt;&gt; Right, somebody is calling because\nthere's an issue on hand, and\n\n260\n00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.710\nthey have to have something that's done,\nthat's not done, so I could see that.\n\n261\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.230\n&gt;&gt; How many people actually call\nthe service service desk just to say, hey,\n\n262\n00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.550\nthanks very much for being there,\n\n263\n00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.780\nyou're doing a great job,\nI hope you're having a fantastic day?\n\n264\n00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know of very many,\n[LAUGH] as far as I can think of, yeah.\n\n265\n00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.340\n&gt;&gt; Which is why we mention here about\nbeing professional and courteous, and\n\n266\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.010\nhaving interpersonal skills,\n\n267\n00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:45.760\nbecause a lot of our interactions with a\nbusiness can have a negative connotation.\n\n268\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.085\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They can come across\n\n269\n00:15:47.085 --> 00:15:51.288\nas very negative because the business\ncontacts us when they want something.\n\n270\n00:15:51.288 --> 00:15:52.216\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n271\n00:15:52.216 --> 00:15:54.852\n&gt;&gt; Or, when something has gone wrong.\n\n272\n00:15:54.852 --> 00:15:59.247\nAnd what we need to ensure that\nwe do is that we display a very\n\n273\n00:15:59.247 --> 00:16:02.300\nprofessional manner to the business.\n\n274\n00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.158\nBut also that we're able\nto provide services for\n\n275\n00:16:05.158 --> 00:16:07.396\nthem that actually meet their needs.\n\n276\n00:16:07.396 --> 00:16:10.997\nAnd I can't say they don't go wrong\nbecause let's face it, this is IT and\n\n277\n00:16:10.997 --> 00:16:12.130\nthings happen.\n\n278\n00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:16.060\nBut we need to make sure that we provide\na service that can deliver value.\n\n279\n00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.740\nSo we've talked about other\nlife cycle phases, and\n\n280\n00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.480\nI talk about sort of the strategy\na little while ago and I mentioned\n\n281\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.310\nbusiness relationship management,\nwhich is a process in service strategy.\n\n282\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.500\nAnd in service strategy,\n\n283\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.350\nthis is where we have the proactive\nrelationship with the business.\n\n284\n00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.900\nWhere we understand\nthe needs of the business.\n\n285\n00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.000\nAnd where we understand what\nour strategies will do for\n\n286\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.730\nthe business, either in a positive or\npotentially a negative way.\n\n287\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.560\nBecause you know sometimes things happen\nwhere we have to upgrade our network.\n\n288\n00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.960\nOur firewalls,\n\n289\n00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.320\nwe have to upgrade certain operating\nsystems because suppliers tell us to do.\n\n290\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.149\nSo we have to be able to have that\nrelationship with the business where we\n\n291\n00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:04.448\ncan say, hey look, change happens\non both side of the fence so\n\n292\n00:17:04.448 --> 00:17:07.763\nlet's work with each other to\nmake sure that it's seamless.\n\n293\n00:17:07.763 --> 00:17:11.791\nAnd this is also where we maintain that\nproactive relationship in making those\n\n294\n00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:14.620\nrecommendations to the business.\n\n295\n00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.210\nSo our service design, well,\nthat's where we design those services.\n\n296\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.140\nSo those ideas that we've come up with and\n\n297\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.290\nservice strategy, those,\nhopefully, proactive ideas.\n\n298\n00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.030\nWell in service design,\nwe design those ideas.\n\n299\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.340\nAnd that includes designing all\nof the measurement systems and\n\n300\n00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.560\nall of the targets in which we\nare going to operate those services as\n\n301\n00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.540\nwell as the service solutions itself.\n\n302\n00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:42.200\nAnd we design also the processes and\nall of that are architectures too that\n\n303\n00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.450\nare required to meet those\nneeds of the business.\n\n304\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.780\nService transition, this is where\nwe build all of those new services.\n\n305\n00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.640\nAnd where we make changes to our\nbusiness as usual environment.\n\n306\n00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.730\nAnd here is where we do\nall of our testing too.\n\n307\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:02.350\nBoth of our customer acceptance testing\nand our user acceptance testing.\n\n308\n00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.410\nAnd then CSI,\ncontinue of service improvement.\n\n309\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.023\nIt's got absolutely nothing to do\nwith anything you may see on TV.\n\n310\n00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:15.984\nIt's all about continually\niteratively improving,\n\n311\n00:18:15.984 --> 00:18:21.277\nbecause as we know,\nvalue perception changes over time.\n\n312\n00:18:21.277 --> 00:18:25.960\nWe are concerned here at service\noperation with the operational health of\n\n313\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.180\nthe whole of IT, not just the process,\nnot just the odd one or two services.\n\n314\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.150\nBut we, on a regular basis,\n\n315\n00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:38.360\nneed to ensure that the operational\nhealth of the whole of IT is maintained.\n\n316\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.894\nI mentioned earlier on about short of\nthe interpersonal scales, and so just to\n\n317\n00:18:44.894 --> 00:18:49.759\nfinalize really this particular section,\njust to wrap it up, we've got a couple\n\n318\n00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:54.645\nof slice that talk about communication,\nthat talk about interpersonal scales.\n\n319\n00:18:54.645 --> 00:18:56.620\nYou see?\n\n320\n00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.450\nAny interaction is a form of communication\nand what we have to remember\n\n321\n00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.760\nis that communication has to be\nin the language of the audience.\n\n322\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.580\nNow, in case anybody hadn't guessed,\nwe've both got different accents.\n\n323\n00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.140\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n324\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:10.646\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n325\n00:19:10.646 --> 00:19:13.442\nAnd that means that we come from\ndifferent sides of the world and\n\n326\n00:19:13.442 --> 00:19:16.350\nyet we both speak in the same language,\nis that right?\n\n327\n00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.532\n&gt;&gt; As far as I know, yes.\n\n328\n00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:18.825\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n329\n00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:20.770\nWell, we like to think that we are.\n\n330\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.565\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nBut unfortunately we're not.\n\n331\n00:19:23.565 --> 00:19:27.100\nNow we all know the difference\nbetween petrol and gas.\n\n332\n00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.320\nI put petrol in my car.\n\n333\n00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.235\nYou put gas in yours, but there's lots\nof differences between our language.\n\n334\n00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:39.757\nNow if I'm talking to you as my customer,\nIs it your role to figure out what I'm\n\n335\n00:19:39.757 --> 00:19:46.110\nsaying, or is it my role to talk to you\nin a way that I know you can understand?\n\n336\n00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I'm the customer,\nand you are providing a service,\n\n337\n00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.260\nI'm assuming you should figure\nout what I really mean by it.\n\n338\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.440\nThat's my assumption.\n\n339\n00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, but you would not believe\nhow many service level agreements and\n\n340\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:04.540\nhow many documents are written\n&gt;&gt; In a language that\n\n341\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.400\nhas been created by IT.\n\n342\n00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.802\nHow many documents are written\nin technical language?\n\n343\n00:20:09.802 --> 00:20:13.770\nThat a customer has absolutely\nnow hope to understand it\n\n344\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.260\nbecause it's not their role and\nthey shouldn't have to.\n\n345\n00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.080\nThat puts IT at a great disadvantage\nbecause the trust is lost.\n\n346\n00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:22.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n347\n00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.730\n&gt;&gt; So it's our role to ensure that\nwhen we are fostering that productive\n\n348\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:33.520\nrelationship, we are also fostering a,\nan ethic of positive communication.\n\n349\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.750\nThat means that if I talk to you,\nI talk to you in your language.\n\n350\n00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.440\nIf I talk to anybody else,\nI talk to them in their language.\n\n351\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.030\nNow that doesn't mean that I'm fluent\nin every single language in the world.\n\n352\n00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.600\nBecause a couple is probably\nas good as I'm gonna get.\n\n353\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.180\nBut it does mean that I have to understand\nwhat's valuable to the business.\n\n354\n00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.320\nI have to understand what's\nvaluable to the organization and\n\n355\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.420\nI have to understand what's valuable\nto the person that I'm speaking to.\n\n356\n00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.950\nSo we have to have what we call\nformal communication policies.\n\n357\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.910\nWhich means that we got to be\nvery careful of the language.\n\n358\n00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:10.740\nWe've gotta be very careful of how\nmany emails we send to people.\n\n359\n00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.470\nHow many emails I wonder\ndo you on a percentage\n\n360\n00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:19.240\nhow many emails do you actually\ndelete without even reading them?\n\n361\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.540\nI know probably I delete about 40% of\nmy emails without even opening them.\n\n362\n00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.150\nThat suggests to me that those\nemails are just simply not relevant.\n\n363\n00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.750\nSo before you communicate think.\n\n364\n00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.460\nThink about what you want to communicate,\nthink about why and\n\n365\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.780\nthere are many reasons.\n\n366\n00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.930\nLook at the bullet points\nin front of you now and\n\n367\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:45.260\nthink about what feedback you're expecting\nto get from that communication and\n\n368\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.690\nthat communication also includes\nemails and meetings as well.\n\n369\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.950\nAny form of communication,\nwhether that's face-to-face, or\n\n370\n00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.840\nwhether that's communication via email.\n\n371\n00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.970\nWe all know the usual principles of well,\ndon't put a joke in an email,\n\n372\n00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.880\nbecause you never know the person reading\nit might not be having a good day.\n\n373\n00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.250\nBut that's exactly the same in every\nway that we communicate, it's not just\n\n374\n00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:16.990\nrelated to email at all because\nyou see here in service operation.\n\n375\n00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.990\nAnd this is our last slide\nbefore we call this a wrap,\n\n376\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.510\nI think is the technical term here.\n\n377\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:28.360\nFor this particular session\nwe just need to ensure\n\n378\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.980\nthat all of our documentation and\nall of our communication Is relevant.\n\n379\n00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:38.008\nIt's too the point, it's what we\ncall clear, concise and unambiguous.\n\n380\n00:22:38.008 --> 00:22:42.020\nAnd that it has a purpose,\nhence the relevance.\n\n381\n00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.510\nWhether that's process documentation,\nwhether it's technical documents.\n\n382\n00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.124\nWhether it's planning documents,\n\n383\n00:22:48.124 --> 00:22:53.266\nwhether it's communication documents,\nwe need to ensure that in every\n\n384\n00:22:53.266 --> 00:22:58.679\nsingle document that we write that we\nunderstand the value to the business.\n\n385\n00:22:58.679 --> 00:23:02.063\nThat we understand the value\nto the reader, and\n\n386\n00:23:02.063 --> 00:23:06.300\nthink almost always about efficiency and\neffectiveness.\n\n387\n00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.940\nDoes it serve a purpose and\nis it efficient?\n\n388\n00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.200\nIs it clear, concise and unambiguous?\n\n389\n00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.820\nAll right Jo, well thank you for\n\n390\n00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.770\nhelping us to review these\ndifferent principles and service\n\n391\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.470\noperation that we all need to consider as\nour business continues to move forward.\n\n392\n00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.250\nRemember that the key terms here of\ncourse is gonna be the idea of balance\n\n393\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:30.360\nas well as what she just mentioned,\nthe relevancy that we also need to have\n\n394\n00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.290\nespecially in the communication process,\nand making sure that we\n\n395\n00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.950\nunderstand the point of the business and\nwhat we're communicating for as well.\n\n396\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:42.150\nThese are all clear tools that will\ncontinue to help us out as we see more and\n\n397\n00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.820\nmore in the service\noperation side of things.\n\n398\n00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.920\nWell that's a great place for\nus to wrap this show up then.\n\n399\n00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.320\nFor IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie

00:00:06.774\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:08.217\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:11.988\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:15.755\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:19.479\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:24.970\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're jumping into event management and\n\n9\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.030\nhere to help us out today is gonna\nbe our ITIL genius, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.330\nJo, welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.170\nHow are you doing today?\n\n12\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.260\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I'm fine, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.190\nThank you for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.990\nHow are you?\n\n15\n00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.175\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n16\n00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:41.059\nNow, Jo we've already talked a little bit\nabout the introductory things that we have\n\n17\n00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.580\nto in service operations.\n\n18\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.744\nNow we're really starting to jump into\nthe processes a little bit, right, and\n\n19\n00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:50.681\nwe're gonna begin with event management,\nso where are we going to begin?\n\n20\n00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:54.295\n&gt;&gt; Well, we started off in\nour previous few sessions,\n\n21\n00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:59.141\nwe looked at the value to the business\nthat we have to provide in order to\n\n22\n00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:02.281\nbe aligned to the needs\nof the organization.\n\n23\n00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:06.411\nAnd so now what we're going to do is we're\ngonna look at the processes that underpin\n\n24\n00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:07.950\nthe services that we provide.\n\n25\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.460\nSo I'm going to start off first of\nall by looking at event management.\n\n26\n00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.720\nNow, event management is a process\nthat exists within service operation\n\n27\n00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.110\nto underpin all of the services\nthat we provide to the business.\n\n28\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.380\nThe purpose of event management\nis to detect events,\n\n29\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.370\nmake sense of them, and\ndetermine the appropriate control action.\n\n30\n00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.460\nIt's in that blue box at the bottom.\n\n31\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.530\nNow, what does that really mean?\n\n32\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.245\nWell, event management is a process\nthat could be fully automated.\n\n33\n00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:49.522\nIt's the only process that could be\nfully automated in all honesty and\n\n34\n00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:52.962\nwe think of event management\nas a monitoring process, but\n\n35\n00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:56.200\nit's actually a little bit more than this.\n\n36\n00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.860\nBecause the purpose event management as\nI said, is actually to detect events,\n\n37\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.220\nmake sense of them, and\nthen decide what to do with them.\n\n38\n00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.490\nNow, the detecting events part\nis what we call monitoring but\n\n39\n00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.180\nthe making sense of them and\nthen deciding what to do about it, well,\n\n40\n00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.300\nthat's what makes it event management and\nnot just monitoring.\n\n41\n00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.280\nSo, I want to take you out of IT for\na moment and\n\n42\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.780\nI just want to draw your attention to the\nthermostat that's on the wall right now.\n\n43\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.410\nNow we could just have a thermostat and a\nthermostat will just, sorry a thermometer,\n\n44\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.640\nand a thermometer will simply just\nmonitor the temperature in the room.\n\n45\n00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.948\nIt tells you what the temperature is.\n\n46\n00:02:34.948 --> 00:02:38.650\nNow in our last session we\ntalked about communication and\n\n47\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.270\nthe fact that we speak\ndifferent languages.\n\n48\n00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.491\nNow I speak in Celsius and I know that\nyou speak in Farenheit but either way,\n\n49\n00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:46.910\nit doesn't matter which way we look at it.\n\n50\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.580\nWe would know, that if we were in the room\nand temperature was 35 Celsius, or\n\n51\n00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.440\nit was 90 Fahrenheit, then we'd know,\nthat that was too hot.\n\n52\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.642\nBut all the thermometer is going is to do\nis just tell you what the temperature is,\n\n53\n00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:00.777\nthat's monitoring.\n\n54\n00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:06.510\nA thermostat on the other hand,\nwill tell you not only about what\n\n55\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.189\nthe temperature is but will then make\nan adjustment of the temperature\n\n56\n00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.280\nbased on a predefined setting\nthat you have preprogrammed.\n\n57\n00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.540\nWe'd call that a parameter.\n\n58\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.720\nSo, you might set your thermostat on\nyour wall to say 72 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n59\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.178\nAnd so, when the temperature goes\nabove 72 degrees Fahrenheit,\n\n60\n00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:30.760\nwell the thermostat ensures that the air\n\n61\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.850\nconditioning kicks in and\nit lowers the temperature in that room.\n\n62\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.880\nThat's event management.\n\n63\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.890\nSo event management's job is to detect\nevents, make sense of them, and\n\n64\n00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.690\nthen decide what to do about them.\n\n65\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.710\nSo there you go,\nthe purpose of event management.\n\n66\n00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.750\nSo, what's that gotta do with IT?\n\n67\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.520\nWell, in IT we are continually monitoring\nour servers and things happen.\n\n68\n00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.920\nBackups start, backups finish, sometimes\nbackups fail and event management\n\n69\n00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.420\nmonitors all of those activities and\nthen decides what to do about them.\n\n70\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.260\nSo let's say I'm going to\nask you a question then.\n\n71\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.120\nLet's say a backup starts,\nwhat do we need to do about that?\n\n72\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.370\nWe get a message to tell\nus that a backup starts.\n\n73\n00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to backup the machine we would\nactually run some type of backup utility\n\n74\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.230\nand at least begin the process of\ndeciding what needs to be backed up and\n\n75\n00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.960\nthen of course making sure we have\nthe capacity to back it up as well.\n\n76\n00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.780\n&gt;&gt; So let's say you get an alert message\nthat pops up on your screen that\n\n77\n00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.040\nsays the backup has started.\n\n78\n00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.960\nWhat would you do?\n\n79\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.663\n&gt;&gt; I would probably monitor it.\n\n80\n00:04:38.663 --> 00:04:39.464\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n81\n00:04:39.464 --> 00:04:40.942\n&gt;&gt; Make sure that it starts\n&gt;&gt; Nothing really.\n\n82\n00:04:40.942 --> 00:04:41.663\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n83\n00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:42.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's okay.\n\n84\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.133\nThat's what we call\nan informational event.\n\n85\n00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:48.280\nIt's just information,\nnothing more than that.\n\n86\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.720\nYou get a message to say\nthat the backup's finished,\n\n87\n00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.910\nyou're probably gonna do\nexactly the same thing.\n\n88\n00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.010\nNothing, that's great.\n\n89\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.010\nBut then you get a message to\nsay that the backup has failed.\n\n90\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.850\nNow, that's what we would\ncall either a warning or\n\n91\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.050\nan exceptional event depending on what the\nexpectation was for you to do about that.\n\n92\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.610\nA warning event is a warning that\nsomething's about to happen and\n\n93\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.490\nan exceptional event is that\nthere has been a failure and\n\n94\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.090\nevent management will take those events,\ndepending on those parameters, and\n\n95\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.540\nsay right, okay, so the backup has failed.\n\n96\n00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.410\nNow I need to send a message\nasking somebody to intervene and\n\n97\n00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.470\nit may be that the backups fail\nbecause the tape's full and\n\n98\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.570\nsomebody needs to go and replace the tape.\n\n99\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.106\nSo this is what event management does and\nso\n\n100\n00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:42.083\nthe objective of event management\nis to detect changes of state.\n\n101\n00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:44.340\nIn other words something's happened.\n\n102\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.220\nFor the management of our configuration\nitems, remember those components of\n\n103\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.830\na service, those configuration items that\nwe referred to in service transition?\n\n104\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.180\nAnd then decide what to do about it that\ndetermine appropriate control actions.\n\n105\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.130\nThe third bullet point in\nthe objectives talks about a trigger or\n\n106\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.740\nan entry point for other processes.\n\n107\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.400\nSo the appropriate action could\nwell be to raise an incident and\n\n108\n00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.580\nwe'll take a look at that when we look at\nthe section of incident management and\n\n109\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.010\nproblem management.\n\n110\n00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.490\nSo when I say to you that a thermostat\non the wall actually compares against\n\n111\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.000\na parameter, that's that next bullet point\ndown about comparing actual performance.\n\n112\n00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.402\nThe actual real temperature of\nthe room versus the design parameters.\n\n113\n00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:35.049\nSo the real temperature of the room is 78,\nwe designed it to be maintained at 72 so\n\n114\n00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:38.720\nwe're going to bring in\nthe air conditioning, okay.\n\n115\n00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.902\nWhich is why we talk about a basis for\nservice assurance as well and also for\n\n116\n00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:47.427\nservice improvement because perhaps\nif the temperatures of the room keeps\n\n117\n00:06:47.427 --> 00:06:51.447\nexceeding 72, then maybe we need\nto do something about servicing\n\n118\n00:06:51.447 --> 00:06:53.973\nthat air conditioning unit for instance.\n\n119\n00:06:53.973 --> 00:06:59.024\nSo, as I've already said this\ncould be completely automated and\n\n120\n00:06:59.024 --> 00:07:02.214\nanything that needs to be controlled,\n\n121\n00:07:02.214 --> 00:07:07.929\nanything that needs to be monitored\ncan come under event management.\n\n122\n00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:11.620\nAnd the event management\nprocess simply monitors events,\n\n123\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.500\ndetermines changes of state, makes sense\nof them, and then does something about it.\n\n124\n00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.270\nAnd anything could be\ncovered by event management.\n\n125\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.730\nCould be monitored and\n\n126\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.790\nthen managed by event management including\nenvironmental considerations, in other\n\n127\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.340\nwords the temperature in a room but\nincluding the use of software licenses.\n\n128\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.080\nAlso security activity,\nsomebody logging in or\n\n129\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.340\nsomebody logging out or somebody\nforgetting their password for instance.\n\n130\n00:07:39.522 --> 00:07:43.703\nThat part of logging in to your\norganization where you've forgotten\n\n131\n00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:47.823\nyour password three times and\nthen it locks you out for ten minutes.\n\n132\n00:07:47.823 --> 00:07:49.598\nThat's event management doing that.\n\n133\n00:07:49.598 --> 00:07:53.842\nThere's not a real person sitting there\nwatching you through the camera on your\n\n134\n00:07:53.842 --> 00:07:58.168\nscreen saying you've forgotten your\npassword, I'm gonna lock you out now.\n\n135\n00:07:58.168 --> 00:08:01.012\nIt's event management that does that for\nyou.\n\n136\n00:08:01.012 --> 00:08:04.775\nSo the value to the business owner\nshould be fairly self explanatory,\n\n137\n00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:07.345\nit's about the early\ndetection of incidents.\n\n138\n00:08:07.345 --> 00:08:12.030\nWhen something goes wrong,\nevent management will automatically detect\n\n139\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.193\nthat something's gone wrong and\nwill raise an incident for you.\n\n140\n00:08:16.193 --> 00:08:20.090\nSo as we've already said,\nit's all about automated activities.\n\n141\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.980\nThe last bullet point, because we've\ncovered all the others on that slide,\n\n142\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.220\nthe last bullet point talks about\npreventing service degradation.\n\n143\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.180\nI mentioned that we had three\ndifferent types of event.\n\n144\n00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.640\nI mentioned the information event,\n\n145\n00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.850\nwhere we do absolutely nothing other\nthan just log that something happened.\n\n146\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.890\nThe backup started, the backup finishing,\nsomebody logging in, somebody logging out.\n\n147\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.350\nWe also have warning events, warning\nthat a threshold is about to be reached.\n\n148\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.750\nSo for instance,\ncapacity is running at say 80%,\n\n149\n00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.870\nwe might set a threshold to\nalert us when that's happened.\n\n150\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.231\nAnd that's a warning event, so\nnothing's been breached yet,\n\n151\n00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:03.546\nthere's been no interruption to service.\n\n152\n00:09:03.546 --> 00:09:07.334\nBut we need to know about it because\nwe need to do something about it,\n\n153\n00:09:07.334 --> 00:09:11.794\nhence the preventing service degradation,\nor preventive customer service.\n\n154\n00:09:11.794 --> 00:09:16.095\nAnd then we've got the warning events,\nwhere there has been a failure.\n\n155\n00:09:16.095 --> 00:09:20.369\nWhere you've tried to put your\npassword in three times and\n\n156\n00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:23.597\nforgotten it, and\nit has locked you out, or\n\n157\n00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:28.409\nwhere capacity is being exceeded,\nor where a backup has failed.\n\n158\n00:09:28.409 --> 00:09:32.496\nAnd there's a thought point at the bottom\nof the screen there that said,\n\n159\n00:09:32.496 --> 00:09:36.851\nif you were trying to convince your\norganization to set up Event Management,\n\n160\n00:09:36.851 --> 00:09:38.536\nwhat reasons would you give?\n\n161\n00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.575\nWell, they've given you all of\nthe reasons in the slides above.\n\n162\n00:09:41.575 --> 00:09:45.655\nThere are quite a few reasons, but\nthere's also security reasons,\n\n163\n00:09:45.655 --> 00:09:49.270\nlet's think about that\nsecurity implication.\n\n164\n00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:55.280\nIt's also, we talked in the last section\nabout proactive versus reactive.\n\n165\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.110\nIt's also cheaper to be\n\n166\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.900\naware that capacity is pretty\nmuch near to its threshold, and\n\n167\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.850\nit's been like that over the last,\nI don't know, six weeks for instance.\n\n168\n00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:13.385\nSo it's cheaper to buy in\ncapacity when we're preparing,\n\n169\n00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:18.680\nthan it is to have a breach, and\nthen realize that we need more capacity,\n\n170\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.920\nand having to buy servers or\ndisk space at the last minute.\n\n171\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.015\nSo actually,\nyou can save us a lot of money as well, so\n\n172\n00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:31.929\nthat's another point that we could\nuse to sell to the business,\n\n173\n00:10:31.929 --> 00:10:34.672\nthe benefits of event management.\n\n174\n00:10:34.672 --> 00:10:40.490\nEvent management should be streamlined,\nand everything should be logged.\n\n175\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:45.290\nThis means that you have to ensure\nthat you have enough disk space\n\n176\n00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.050\nto be able to store those events.\n\n177\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.900\nSo you'll need to have policies in\nplace that are going to help you.\n\n178\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:57.326\nFor instance, policies that say, where are\nyou going to archive all of this data to?\n\n179\n00:10:57.326 --> 00:11:01.201\nYou can't just keep it in your live\nservice forever and ever and ever.\n\n180\n00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:04.260\nDo you ever delete any of your events?\n\n181\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.135\nOr do you actually just archive them off\nonto tapes after a certain period of time?\n\n182\n00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.567\nThat's a policy decision you have to make.\n\n183\n00:11:10.567 --> 00:11:14.851\nYou have to decide what\nparameters that you need to\n\n184\n00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:19.240\ninput into the event\nmanagement tool that you use.\n\n185\n00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.050\nAnd you will need a tool to\nhelp you with event management.\n\n186\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.253\nEither that or you'll need a very large\nbudget, because you'll need a lot of\n\n187\n00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:30.082\npeople sitting in front of a screen,\nmonitoring what's happening.\n\n188\n00:11:30.082 --> 00:11:31.061\nSo think about the tool,\n\n189\n00:11:31.061 --> 00:11:33.544\nthink about the parameters that\nyou're gonna put in the tool.\n\n190\n00:11:33.544 --> 00:11:37.802\nAnd service level management\nis going to help us with that,\n\n191\n00:11:37.802 --> 00:11:43.350\nbecause this is where we define the target\nfor our operation of our services.\n\n192\n00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.274\nWe need to have, and\n\n193\n00:11:46.274 --> 00:11:52.330\nI really love this fourth bullet\npoint that talks about standards.\n\n194\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:57.016\nYou need to have a set of standards for\nwhat will appear on your alert messages,\n\n195\n00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:59.714\nthose messages that\nflash up on the screens.\n\n196\n00:11:59.714 --> 00:12:03.310\nYou also need to have a set of standards\nfor what you're going to monitor.\n\n197\n00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.866\nBecause quite simply,\n\n198\n00:12:04.866 --> 00:12:09.998\nif I'm the operator that's looking at\nthese events scrolling on the screen,\n\n199\n00:12:09.998 --> 00:12:14.835\nand every single event is set up in\na different way and a different format.\n\n200\n00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:19.029\nWe're going to go back to this language\nthing that we talked about just a few\n\n201\n00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:21.840\nminutes ago, and\nI don't know what I'm seeing.\n\n202\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.208\nI could be seeing 100 different things and\nit's very difficult for\n\n203\n00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:30.514\nme to ascertain which one needs my\nattention and which one doesn't.\n\n204\n00:12:30.514 --> 00:12:34.334\nAnd so other policies that we would need\nto have is what we're going to automate,\n\n205\n00:12:34.334 --> 00:12:38.061\nand what we're not going to automate,\nif there's anything that we're not.\n\n206\n00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:42.736\nBecause let's face it, we're talking\nabout efficiency and effectiveness, and\n\n207\n00:12:42.736 --> 00:12:47.140\nas far as event management is concerned,\nit's always going to be efficient to\n\n208\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:52.120\nautomate as long as the parameters are set\nup correctly, in an effective way.\n\n209\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.610\nAnd then what are we going to do\nabout those exceptional events and\n\n210\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.170\nthose warning events?\n\n211\n00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:03.890\nSomething has to be done with them,\nthey have to be what we call escalated.\n\n212\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:09.230\nAnd maybe we need to raise an incident\nrecord to deal with any failures,\n\n213\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.330\nor perhaps to prevent\nservices being interrupted.\n\n214\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.490\nSo those policies have to\nbe very clearly defined.\n\n215\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.820\nSo this next page actually shows us\nwhat the different types of events are.\n\n216\n00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.090\nThere are three different types,\nas we've already said.\n\n217\n00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.590\nInformational, just information.\n\n218\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.490\nWarning, something's about to happen,\nbut it hasn't happened yet.\n\n219\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.520\nAnd exceptional, there has been a failure.\n\n220\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.060\nNow we also have something else\nwithin event management, and\n\n221\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.700\nI've mentioned it a few times,\nand we call that an alert.\n\n222\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.698\nAnd an alert is the message that pops\nup on the screen that tells you that\n\n223\n00:13:47.698 --> 00:13:52.280\nsomething is either about to fail,\nor something has failed.\n\n224\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:00.100\nYou'll also need to set up a policy and\nparameters for alert notification.\n\n225\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.860\nIn the last section that we looked at,\nthe principles of service operation,\n\n226\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.747\nI talked about communication,\nand I asked the question.\n\n227\n00:14:10.747 --> 00:14:16.130\nHow many emails, on a percentage,\ndo you delete without even opening them?\n\n228\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.184\nAnd I said, I actually admitted and\nI shouldn't really, but\n\n229\n00:14:21.184 --> 00:14:25.373\nI admitted that I deleted probably\nabout 40% of my emails, so\n\n230\n00:14:25.373 --> 00:14:28.257\nlet's think about alert generation then.\n\n231\n00:14:28.257 --> 00:14:32.101\nIf you're in receipt of\nalerts from any server,\n\n232\n00:14:32.101 --> 00:14:38.027\nat what point in time do you delete\nthose emails without even opening them?\n\n233\n00:14:38.027 --> 00:14:41.137\nNow, you're probably going\nto delete warning emails,\n\n234\n00:14:41.137 --> 00:14:43.295\nwould you delete exceptional emails?\n\n235\n00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:47.792\nWell, obviously we shouldn't,\nit wouldn't be best practice,\n\n236\n00:14:47.792 --> 00:14:49.652\nbut I know that it happens.\n\n237\n00:14:49.652 --> 00:14:52.122\nBecause if you've got 100 emails a day and\n\n238\n00:14:52.122 --> 00:14:54.658\nthey've all come in in\nthe last five minutes,\n\n239\n00:14:54.658 --> 00:14:58.965\nI can be pretty certain that you're not\ngoing to read all those 100 emails.\n\n240\n00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:04.114\nSo again we have to have a policy for\nalert generation, but let's face it,\n\n241\n00:15:04.114 --> 00:15:08.557\nit has to be a common sense policy,\nsometimes we do forget that.\n\n242\n00:15:08.557 --> 00:15:12.990\nWe like to generate alerts just for\nthe sake of generating alerts,\n\n243\n00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.830\nand there needs to be a policy to back\nup all aspects of event management.\n\n244\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.670\nSo that leads us in to\ndesigning event management.\n\n245\n00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:28.180\nAnd in service design, that life cycle\nphase where we took the ideas from service\n\n246\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.031\nstrategy, and\nthen we designed the services, and\n\n247\n00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:34.306\nwe designed the processes\nthat underpin those services.\n\n248\n00:15:34.306 --> 00:15:38.680\nWell, event management is one of\nthose processes that we designed.\n\n249\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.522\nAnd so we designed for any new service and\nalso for our existing services because\n\n250\n00:15:43.522 --> 00:15:48.250\nwe're interested in value and\nmaintaining alignment to the business.\n\n251\n00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:54.752\nSo we design on a continual basis,\non an iterative basis.\n\n252\n00:15:54.752 --> 00:15:59.729\nWe look at what we're monitoring,\nwe look at what we do with those events,\n\n253\n00:15:59.729 --> 00:16:03.995\nand then we decide What we're going\nto do with all these events on\n\n254\n00:16:03.995 --> 00:16:07.090\na continual basis to\nensure that we add value.\n\n255\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.763\nNow I mentioned about automation.\n\n256\n00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:14.608\nWe've gotta have the right tools\nto perform event management.\n\n257\n00:16:14.608 --> 00:16:17.812\nEvent management doesn't just happen.\n\n258\n00:16:17.812 --> 00:16:22.680\nWe have to have the right tools that\nallow us to monitor the services that we\n\n259\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.919\nhave but also allow us to do\nsomething with the information, and\n\n260\n00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:30.470\nit may allow us to archive or\nforward our data as well.\n\n261\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:38.016\nSo if I take a look at the bullet points\nthat we've got here we have to design for\n\n262\n00:16:38.016 --> 00:16:39.595\nevent management.\n\n263\n00:16:39.595 --> 00:16:42.515\nWe have to decide what\nwe're going to monitor,\n\n264\n00:16:42.515 --> 00:16:46.019\nbearing in mind that not enough\nis gonna be no value to us,\n\n265\n00:16:46.019 --> 00:16:50.490\nbut then too much monitoring is not\ngoing to be valuable to us either.\n\n266\n00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.500\nBecause we'll be in a position where\nyou quite simply can't see the wood for\n\n267\n00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.480\nthe trees.\n\n268\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.580\nOr as perhaps you would say we\ncan't see the forest for the trees.\n\n269\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.490\nSo we have to design what\nwe're going to monitor and\n\n270\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.790\nwe have to make sure that the error\nmessaging that we use is meaningful,\n\n271\n00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.180\nit's very specific, it's clear,\nconcise and unambiguous.\n\n272\n00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.619\nBut more importantly it's in\nthe language of the audience.\n\n273\n00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:22.330\nWe don't want to be scare mongery,\nwe want to be honest with our messaging.\n\n274\n00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.200\nAnd that's actually quite\nan important point.\n\n275\n00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.968\nBecause if you get a message\nthat flashes up on your screen\n\n276\n00:17:28.968 --> 00:17:33.287\n20 times in five minutes, and\nit says alert, alert, alert and\n\n277\n00:17:33.287 --> 00:17:37.448\nthen when you actually go and\nlook further into that alert, and\n\n278\n00:17:37.448 --> 00:17:42.812\nfind out that actually it's only the CPU\nthat's been running at sort of 65%.\n\n279\n00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.360\nThen the next time you get a message,\nyou're going to ignore it.\n\n280\n00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.326\nSo we have to ensure our\nmessages are meaningful and\n\n281\n00:17:50.326 --> 00:17:52.959\nthat they're completely relevant.\n\n282\n00:17:52.959 --> 00:18:00.109\nAnd, we have to have a way of filtering\nand escalating those alerts where needed.\n\n283\n00:18:00.109 --> 00:18:03.387\nSo, of course we have to identify\nwhat the thresholds are and\n\n284\n00:18:03.387 --> 00:18:06.670\nservice level management\nwill help us with that.\n\n285\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.170\nAnd it says also then that it's\nmanaged by availability management and\n\n286\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.760\ncapacity management.\n\n287\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.417\nAnd they would be the proactive\nparts of availability management and\n\n288\n00:18:15.417 --> 00:18:16.685\ncapacity management.\n\n289\n00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:20.627\nThe proactive parts where\nwe're looking at redundancy,\n\n290\n00:18:20.627 --> 00:18:25.776\nwhere we're looking at reliability and\nwe're looking at potential threat\n\n291\n00:18:25.776 --> 00:18:31.102\nto those service level targets that we\nplace in the service level agreements.\n\n292\n00:18:31.102 --> 00:18:37.653\nThe last particular three words in this\nslide are probably the most important.\n\n293\n00:18:37.653 --> 00:18:42.721\nAnd that is the fact that event\nmanagement has to be based on experience.\n\n294\n00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:47.291\nWhether that experiences come from\nin-house whether that experiences come\n\n295\n00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:48.635\nfrom your suppliers.\n\n296\n00:18:48.635 --> 00:18:52.868\nThey will be able to help you with this\nfor any service that you're implementing.\n\n297\n00:18:52.868 --> 00:18:57.686\nOr whether that experience comes from\nsaying industry standard because it's not\n\n298\n00:18:57.686 --> 00:19:01.823\nsomething that you ever monitored before,\nthen it doesn't matter.\n\n299\n00:19:01.823 --> 00:19:07.252\nWe still need to have the experience\nto set the right level of alerts and\n\n300\n00:19:07.252 --> 00:19:11.220\nto set the right parameters for\nevent management.\n\n301\n00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:18.170\nSo in conclusion I'm going\nto just look at the example\n\n302\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:24.010\nthat we have in the ITIL book\nof the event management process.\n\n303\n00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.080\nAnd remember what I said,\nabout event management and\n\n304\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.170\nliking it to that thermostart.\n\n305\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:34.120\nWhere we monitor the temperature\nin a room, and then we\n\n306\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.420\nmake adjustments based on the parameters\nthat we've set on that thermostat.\n\n307\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.447\nSo, let's take a look at this\nparticular process then.\n\n308\n00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:48.950\nSo the event occurs, something happens\nI don't know, a user logged on.\n\n309\n00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.290\nLet's take this one for an example.\n\n310\n00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:56.270\nSo we're notified of the event, in other\nwords the Event Management System is\n\n311\n00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:01.650\nnotified, or the tool is notified of the\nevent and it's detected and it logs it.\n\n312\n00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.610\nSo then what is it doing?\n\n313\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:09.384\nWell the first thing that the tool has\nto do is decide on the significance of\n\n314\n00:20:09.384 --> 00:20:10.156\nthe event.\n\n315\n00:20:10.156 --> 00:20:13.177\nIs it just informational,\nis it a warning, or\n\n316\n00:20:13.177 --> 00:20:16.821\nis it a exceptional in\nthe example that I've given you.\n\n317\n00:20:16.821 --> 00:20:20.900\nAnd we're going to be just going through\nthese different slides here over the next\n\n318\n00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.020\nthree slides.\n\n319\n00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.319\nSo in the example that I gave you,\nsomebody is logged in it's informational.\n\n320\n00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:28.731\nSo let's follow that left hand arrow then,\nand look at it,\n\n321\n00:20:28.731 --> 00:20:32.487\nthe left hand arrow there it just\ncomes straight down and it says,\n\n322\n00:20:32.487 --> 00:20:35.866\nokay we can just close the event,\nnothing more than that.\n\n323\n00:20:38.063 --> 00:20:45.197\nSo let's go back, and let's say that\nthat event was a warning event.\n\n324\n00:20:45.197 --> 00:20:51.619\nYou have reached 75% or 80% of disk space.\n\n325\n00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:54.880\nSo, let's follow the middle arrow then,\nthe warning event.\n\n326\n00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.580\nSo the warning event goes in to\nthe second level event correlation, and\n\n327\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.982\nbearing in mind this is just an example,\nit's up to you to adopt ITIL processes and\n\n328\n00:21:04.982 --> 00:21:08.680\nthen adapt them to suit your environment.\n\n329\n00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.940\nSo let's scroll down then and\nlook for what this examples tells us.\n\n330\n00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.530\nWell, second level event correlation just\n\n331\n00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.750\nlooks at the fact that you might\njust have to do something about it.\n\n332\n00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.289\nDo I need to do something?\n\n333\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.340\nNo and\n\n334\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:26.940\nif the answer is no you don't need to do\nanything cuz 75% is perfectly acceptable.\n\n335\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.462\nOr 80% and you'll notice that\nif 75% is perfectly acceptable,\n\n336\n00:21:31.462 --> 00:21:34.612\nthen look we carry on to\njust causing that event.\n\n337\n00:21:34.612 --> 00:21:39.500\nBut if it was at 80% then\nmaybe it needs further action.\n\n338\n00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.970\nIn which case,\nwe can do one of many things and\n\n339\n00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:48.260\nwe can either generate an auto\nresponse that perhaps goes to\n\n340\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.500\nincident management or\nproblem management or change management.\n\n341\n00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:57.050\nOr, maybe it generates an alert\nthat goes to a human intervention,\n\n342\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.590\nit goes to a person.\n\n343\n00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.710\nAnd that person then will\ndo something about it.\n\n344\n00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.520\nAnd if necessary,\nthey'll raise a request for\n\n345\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.330\ninstance to perhaps make standard change.\n\n346\n00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:14.390\nIf that worked, whatever the person did,\nthen, if it's effective,\n\n347\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.560\nthen they'll close the event.\n\n348\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.780\nIf not,\nthen we go back potentially to incident,\n\n349\n00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.169\nor problem, or raising a change record.\n\n350\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.025\nThen they start third option.\n\n351\n00:22:27.025 --> 00:22:29.426\nAnd, the third type of event\nis that exceptional event.\n\n352\n00:22:29.426 --> 00:22:31.216\nThat's something failed.\n\n353\n00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:33.243\nSomething has gone wrong.\n\n354\n00:22:33.243 --> 00:22:34.764\nIf something has failed,\n\n355\n00:22:34.764 --> 00:22:38.650\nthen this is not just a warning\nwhere it needs human intervention.\n\n356\n00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.638\nWe've got to do something\nwith that failure.\n\n357\n00:22:42.638 --> 00:22:48.560\nAnd so what we may choose to do is either\nraise an incident and that incident record\n\n358\n00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:54.587\nwill allow somebody to restore no more\nservice operation as quickly as possible.\n\n359\n00:22:54.587 --> 00:22:57.066\nIn other words,\nget it back up and running.\n\n360\n00:22:57.066 --> 00:23:01.133\nOr, we raise a problem record and\na problem record will look for\n\n361\n00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:04.684\nthe root cause and\ndetermine why something is failed.\n\n362\n00:23:04.684 --> 00:23:07.696\nOr we might raise a change of record and\n\n363\n00:23:07.696 --> 00:23:13.733\na change record will allow somebody to\nmake a change to the infrastructure.\n\n364\n00:23:13.733 --> 00:23:18.102\nBecause something has failed and\nwe need to say swap out a disk or\n\n365\n00:23:18.102 --> 00:23:20.333\nswap out a server for instance.\n\n366\n00:23:20.333 --> 00:23:25.447\nObviously that's sort of quite\nexceptional, very exceptional.\n\n367\n00:23:25.447 --> 00:23:29.600\nOnce that has been completed,\nthen, if it's affected,\n\n368\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.446\nthen again we close the event and\nthat's it, the end of that event.\n\n369\n00:23:37.252 --> 00:23:44.430\nThis is just an example from the ITIL book\nas to what an event process may look like.\n\n370\n00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.137\nIt's up to you to work out\nwhat is the most effective and\n\n371\n00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:54.191\nthe most efficient process flow for\nyour events.\n\n372\n00:23:54.191 --> 00:23:58.504\nBut it's this process that\nunderpins the day to day\n\n373\n00:23:58.504 --> 00:24:02.324\nbusiness as usual running\nof your services.\n\n374\n00:24:05.437 --> 00:24:08.700\nSo, in conclusion, in event management,\n\n375\n00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.227\nthe only process that may\nbe fully automated and\n\n376\n00:24:12.227 --> 00:24:17.978\nit is the process that underpins the day\nto day running of all of our services.\n\n377\n00:24:17.978 --> 00:24:21.489\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, and there's been a lot\nof information that we've covered so\n\n378\n00:24:21.489 --> 00:24:22.360\nfar in the series.\n\n379\n00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.450\nIs there anything that we need\nto kind of just think about or\n\n380\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.130\ndo at this point Before we proceed on?\n\n381\n00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.244\n&gt;&gt; Yes, within your course\nmaterials that you have downloaded,\n\n382\n00:24:33.244 --> 00:24:34.958\nyou have some exercises.\n\n383\n00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:40.671\nAnd we do have recap exercises to\ngo all of this particular process.\n\n384\n00:24:40.671 --> 00:24:45.185\nBut also part of these exercises\nthat will help to expand your\n\n385\n00:24:45.185 --> 00:24:48.030\nunderstanding of event management.\n\n386\n00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.158\nFor instance that question that I\nasked about if you're trying to\n\n387\n00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:56.748\njustify event management within your\norganization how would you do it?\n\n388\n00:24:56.748 --> 00:25:00.993\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo thank you for that\nreminder that we do need to take advantage\n\n389\n00:25:00.993 --> 00:25:03.612\nof those materials that are also provided,\n\n390\n00:25:03.612 --> 00:25:07.676\ncuz it also helps of course as you\nprepare for that ITIL exam as well.\n\n391\n00:25:07.676 --> 00:25:11.316\nSo remember that the concept that we\nlooked at here under event management and\n\n392\n00:25:11.316 --> 00:25:14.739\nthis is the first process that we're\ndiving into in service operation.\n\n393\n00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:18.035\nWe also of course, talked about the\ndifferent alerts that are out there and\n\n394\n00:25:18.035 --> 00:25:20.274\nthe activities which Jo\nshowed us here at the end.\n\n395\n00:25:20.274 --> 00:25:24.030\nBut this is a great place for\nus to end this episode, then.\n\n396\n00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.874\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n397\n00:25:27.874 --> 00:25:29.009\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n398\n00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:34.669\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation shows.\n\n399\n00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:40.743\n[MUSIC]\n\n400\n00:25:40.743 --> 00:25:43.553\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:18.309\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n5\n00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:23.276\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're going to actually jump\n\n6\n00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:27.999\ninto a smaller little segment here\non instances versus problems.\n\n7\n00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:33.360\nAnd here to help us out is going to be\nour ITIL genius herself Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.820\nJo, what are we taking a look at here?\n\n9\n00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what I want to do really is take\nthe most of the next few minutes just\n\n10\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.490\nto get to the bottom of\na common misconception and\n\n11\n00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.670\na common area of confusion.\n\n12\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.630\nIn ITIL we look at incident\nmanagement as a process and\n\n13\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.260\nwe also look at problem\nmanagement as a process.\n\n14\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.620\nBut for a lot of organizations,\nand in fact for a lot of people,\n\n15\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.230\nthere is an area of\nconfusion between the two.\n\n16\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.950\nAnd a lot of organizations will try and\n\n17\n00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.350\ncombine the two without fully\nunderstanding what they are.\n\n18\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.915\nSo what I'd like to try and\ndo is explain just really what\n\n19\n00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:17.605\nthe difference is between incidents and\nproblems, and also the difference\n\n20\n00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:22.427\nbetween then incident management and\nproblem management as two processes.\n\n21\n00:01:22.427 --> 00:01:24.967\nAnd why, as far as ITIL is concerned,\n\n22\n00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:29.757\nfrom a best practice perspective it\ndoesn't actually make any sense to try and\n\n23\n00:01:29.757 --> 00:01:35.813\ncombine the two because we\nhave two conflicting purposes.\n\n24\n00:01:35.813 --> 00:01:39.733\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, so how are we\ngoing to help solve this conundrum\n\n25\n00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.063\nof whether it's a problem or an incident?\n\n26\n00:01:42.063 --> 00:01:43.263\nAnd how are we gonna do this?\n\n27\n00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:46.065\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so first of all we need\nto understand what an incident is.\n\n28\n00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:49.596\nAnd an incident is\nan interruption to service, or\n\n29\n00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:52.965\nit's something that may\ninterrupt a service.\n\n30\n00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:56.294\nBut we'll go into that a little bit\nmore in detail when we look at incident\n\n31\n00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:57.471\nmanagement.\n\n32\n00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:01.641\nSo an incident is an interruption to, or\nreduction in the quality of a service.\n\n33\n00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:07.287\nNow, a problem is the root\ncause of an incident.\n\n34\n00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:12.373\nBut quite often when people want\nto undertake incident management\n\n35\n00:02:12.373 --> 00:02:19.250\nthey think that what they've got to do\nis they've got to fix the problem, okay?\n\n36\n00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.440\nBut that's not the case.\n\n37\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.420\nSo this level management will give us a\nset of parameters for providing a service.\n\n38\n00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.800\nSo we have to make a service available\nbetween the hours of, let's say, 8 AM and\n\n39\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.980\n6 PM on an evening, for ease.\n\n40\n00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.220\nAnd so incident management is concerned\nwith interruptions to that service.\n\n41\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.010\nBecause incident management wants to make\nsure that that service stays available\n\n42\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.080\nbetween the hours of 8 AM and 6 PM.\n\n43\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.400\nSo what incident management is trying to\ndo is to restore normal service operation.\n\n44\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.100\nIncident management doesn't\nactually care what caused it.\n\n45\n00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.670\nWhat incident management wants to\ndo is just restore the service.\n\n46\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.282\nProblem management wants to get to\nthe bottom of what caused it and\n\n47\n00:03:12.282 --> 00:03:16.835\nfix the root cause to\nprevent further incidents.\n\n48\n00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:19.830\nWhereas incident management is\nconcerned with that target and\n\n49\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.250\nwe wanna keep that service available.\n\n50\n00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.295\nSo, I have in my hands\na humble piece of paper.\n\n51\n00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:31.314\nThis\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n52\n00:03:31.314 --> 00:03:32.297\n&gt;&gt; Is an incident.\n\n53\n00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:35.872\nThat service has been interrupted.\n\n54\n00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:40.618\nNormal service operation that's\ndefined in the service level\n\n55\n00:03:40.618 --> 00:03:44.386\nagreement has been, well,\nbroken in this case.\n\n56\n00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:52.656\nSo let's say that my service to you is to\nprovide you with a piece of paper, okay.\n\n57\n00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:54.060\nWhat am I gonna do?\n\n58\n00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.810\nHow do I restore normal service operation?\n\n59\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.260\n&gt;&gt; You could try that weird,\nsticky glue or you could try tape.\n\n60\n00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so, well it just so\n\n61\n00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.030\nhappens, as if by magic,\nI've got some tape.\n\n62\n00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.680\nSo what I'm going to do Is I'm gonna\ntape that piece of paper together and\n\n63\n00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.805\nnow we have a restored service.\n\n64\n00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:17.820\n&gt;&gt; There you go, all right,\nsounds good, yep.\n\n65\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.884\n&gt;&gt; So this tape that we've got in our\nhands is what we call a work around.\n\n66\n00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:25.056\nNow, there's an issue though.\n\n67\n00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:32.080\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that incident's happened again.\n\n68\n00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.860\nSo we can use a workaround again to\nrestore normal service operation.\n\n69\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.475\nThat's great!\nAnd I still have a service.\n\n70\n00:04:41.475 --> 00:04:45.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it looks a little bit raggidy,\nbut I still have the service.\n\n71\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.600\nSo I can carry on using workarounds and\n\n72\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.110\nI can carry on until I've used\nan entire reel of tape, if I wanted.\n\n73\n00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.080\nBut eventually somebody's\ngonna have to fix the problem.\n\n74\n00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.510\nBut what's the problem?\n\n75\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.850\n&gt;&gt; You're tearing the paper.\n\n76\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.357\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n77\n00:05:04.357 --> 00:05:07.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's be more specific.\n\n78\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.807\nWhat or who is the problem?\n\n79\n00:05:08.807 --> 00:05:10.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That would be you.\n\n80\n00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.122\nYou'd be the problem.\n\n81\n00:05:11.122 --> 00:05:12.690\n&gt;&gt; That would be me, right, okay.\n\n82\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.620\nI am the problem.\n\n83\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n84\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.370\nI hold my hands up to being the problem.\n\n85\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.690\nSo how do we solve the problem?\n\n86\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.260\n&gt;&gt; We would have to get you\nto stop tearing the paper,\n\n87\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.080\nso we can try and make sure that we bind\nyour hands and keep them away from paper.\n\n88\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay, or\nwe can take the paper away from me.\n\n89\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.257\n&gt;&gt; We can take the paper away from you.\n\n90\n00:05:33.257 --> 00:05:36.066\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\nSo there is a difference between the two.\n\n91\n00:05:36.066 --> 00:05:40.481\nIncident management simply\nbrings out the tape,\n\n92\n00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:45.230\nit doesn't care whether it happens again.\n\n93\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.520\nBut problem management wants\nto do something about me.\n\n94\n00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.477\nNow, that sounds fairly\nstraight forward until now.\n\n95\n00:05:55.477 --> 00:06:02.327\nProblem management, however, will want\nto find out what exactly is causing it.\n\n96\n00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:06.627\nAnd quite often, problem management\nwill walk into a situation,\n\n97\n00:06:06.627 --> 00:06:09.640\nand what they see is\na ripped up piece of paper.\n\n98\n00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.150\nSo they say, well okay then, don't fix it.\n\n99\n00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.820\nDon't restore normal\nservice operation just yet,\n\n100\n00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.800\ncuz I want to see what's causing it.\n\n101\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.330\nBecause I want to see it happen again and\n\n102\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.160\nthen I can get to the bottom of what's\ncausing the interruptions to service.\n\n103\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.100\nThe issue with that is, and the biggest\nchallenge to incident management is\n\n104\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.600\nthat while problem management to saying,\nlook,\n\n105\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.010\nI need you to keep the service down so\nI can watch to see what's going on.\n\n106\n00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.890\nIncident management is saying hey,\nyou know what?\n\n107\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.100\nWe've got these availability\ntargets that we have to maintain,\n\n108\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.740\nso I'm just gonna carry\non getting the tape out.\n\n109\n00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.610\nSo incidents and problems are two\ncompletely different things, because\n\n110\n00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.080\nan incident is an interruption to service\nand the problem is what's caused it.\n\n111\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.060\nProblem management will want to find\nout what's caused the incident and\n\n112\n00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.300\nwill want to keep the service down\nsometimes in order to try and\n\n113\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.370\nstop it from happening in the future.\n\n114\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.970\nWhereas incident management just\nsimply wants to get the tape out.\n\n115\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.340\nSo now I'm going to ask you a question,\nand this is a question that I\n\n116\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.885\nask everybody, so don't feel unique.\n\n117\n00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:30.910\n[LAUGH] When does an incident\nthen become a problem?\n\n118\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.105\n&gt;&gt; When does an incident become a problem?\n\n119\n00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:35.957\nI really don't know now.\n\n120\n00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:36.457\n[LAUGH] I really don't know.\n\n121\n00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.810\n&gt;&gt; Well I can tell you that every single\nperson that's watching this right now\n\n122\n00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.610\nhas started off with the word when.\n\n123\n00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.580\nWhen there's been so many instance,\nwhen there has been so many interruptions.\n\n124\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.070\nBut the answer is never, because they\nare two completely different things.\n\n125\n00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.980\nThere is no when.\n\n126\n00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.390\nAn incident, well, this is an incident.\n\n127\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.920\nBut this is the problem.\n\n128\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:14.430\nSo the question I'm asking you\nis when does this become this?\n\n129\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.080\nWell it doesn't.\n\n130\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.600\nLet's look at it in another situation\nthen, I can give you another example.\n\n131\n00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.112\nLet's say that I went outside into the\nparking lot and I fell into a pothole and\n\n132\n00:08:27.112 --> 00:08:27.952\nbroke my leg.\n\n133\n00:08:27.952 --> 00:08:32.726\nThat break would\n\n134\n00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:37.842\nbe the incident.\n\n135\n00:08:37.842 --> 00:08:38.382\nWhat would be the problem?\n\n136\n00:08:38.382 --> 00:08:39.106\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That I wasn't\n\n137\n00:08:39.106 --> 00:08:39.701\nwatching where I was going.\n\n138\n00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:44.570\n&gt;&gt; Well no, yeah, the problem is\nthere is a hole that you fell into.\n\n139\n00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.480\n&gt;&gt; No,\nwell the problem is that there is a hole.\n\n140\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there's a hole, all right.\n\n141\n00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.540\n&gt;&gt; That hole though can\ncause many incidents.\n\n142\n00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.170\nBecause, you see,\nI can go to the hospital and\n\n143\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.130\nI can get my leg set in a cast and\nthat would get me walking again.\n\n144\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.400\nIn other words, restore my service, yeah.\n\n145\n00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.700\nBut somebody else could come along and\n\n146\n00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:11.820\nfall into that pothole and they could\nbreak their leg or sprain their ankle.\n\n147\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.834\nAnd they'd have to go to the hospital and\n\n148\n00:09:13.834 --> 00:09:17.638\nthey'd have to have their normal service\nrestored as quickly as possible.\n\n149\n00:09:17.638 --> 00:09:21.888\nBut that incident is going\nto keep on happening until\n\n150\n00:09:21.888 --> 00:09:25.568\nsomebody comes along and\nfixes the problem.\n\n151\n00:09:25.568 --> 00:09:28.850\nUntil somebody comes along and\nfills in the hole.\n\n152\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.850\nSo problem management's job is to come and\nfill in the hole.\n\n153\n00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.910\nIncident management's job is to supply the\ncrutches to get everybody walking again.\n\n154\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.350\nTwo completely different things.\n\n155\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.543\nTwo completely different purposes.\n\n156\n00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:54.810\nWe both are concerned with delivering\nvalue, but two different elements.\n\n157\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.740\nSo the question of when does\nan incident become a problem, well,\n\n158\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.140\nthat's like saying when does my\nbroken leg become that pothole?\n\n159\n00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.062\nIt just doesn't.\n\n160\n00:10:03.062 --> 00:10:07.398\nAnd so the examples that I've used\nhere are really just to try and\n\n161\n00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:12.158\nclear up that common misconception\nbetween incidents and problems.\n\n162\n00:10:12.158 --> 00:10:16.996\nAnd also to try and articulate why\nin ITIL, in this best practice\n\n163\n00:10:16.996 --> 00:10:22.050\nenvironment that we operate in,\nwe look at them both separately.\n\n164\n00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:27.060\nAnd we address them both separately with\nseparate processes with separate aims.\n\n165\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.530\nNow, as we move into problem management,\n\n166\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.950\nyou'll see that problem management\nhas a lot more depth to it than\n\n167\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.690\njust fixing potholes or tying my\nhands up to stop me ripping up paper.\n\n168\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.330\nBut really,\nthe purpose of this particular section\n\n169\n00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.130\nwas just to look at\nthe difference between them.\n\n170\n00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.180\nAnd when we do this we realize\nthat actually they're not as\n\n171\n00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.555\nsimilar as we once thought they were.\n\n172\n00:10:51.555 --> 00:10:55.400\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\nAll right Jo, well thank you again for\n\n173\n00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.980\nhelping us make that clear distinction\nBetween the ideas of problems and\n\n174\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.490\nincidences.\n\n175\n00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.990\nAnd it will help us as we continue on with\nthe course, the incident management and\n\n176\n00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.640\nthe problem management itself.\n\n177\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.510\nAll right, well that's a great place for\nus to sign off then.\n\n178\n00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.040\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n179\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n180\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.512\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation shows.\n\n181\n00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:25.911\n[MUSIC]\n\n182\n00:11:25.911 --> 00:11:28.476\n&gt;&gt;

Jo emphasizes the goal is two fold: restore normal service operations and deliver value to the organization.  This is done by managing incidents where they minimize the adverse effects, ensure to the agreed SLA and restoration of services in a timely fashion, according to Jo.  This is also a point where it is emphasized to stop and review the concepts up to this point!",

00:00:08.601\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:12.652\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:15.941\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:20.776\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation, and,\n\n7\n00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:25.120\nson of a gun, what was I about\nto say next, that was me, yep.\n\n8\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.613\nOkay, that was just me in my head,\njust going a little bit too fast,\n\n9\n00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:34.859\nmy mouth not moving faster than my brain,\n\n10\n00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.706\nor mouth moving too fast for\nmy brain, let's put it that way.\n\n11\n00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.323\n&gt;&gt; Stand by.\n\n12\n00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:43.062\n&gt;&gt; Standing by.\n\n13\n00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:44.759\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to ITProTV, I'm your host.\n\n14\n00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:49.724\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n15\n00:00:49.724 --> 00:00:51.337\n[MUSIC]\n\n16\n00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:54.572\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n17\n00:00:54.572 --> 00:00:58.012\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n18\n00:00:58.012 --> 00:01:01.969\nYou're watching the ITIL Intermediate\non Service Operation.\n\n19\n00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.210\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n20\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.653\nwe're taking a look at\nincident management.\n\n21\n00:01:06.653 --> 00:01:11.070\nAnd here with us, of course,\nis going to be our ITIL guru, Jo Peacock.\n\n22\n00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.590\nJo, welcome back to the studios,\nhow are you doing?\n\n23\n00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.550\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I'm fine,\nthank you, how are you today?\n\n24\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.055\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well, and ready to get\nstarted taking a look at the idea\n\n25\n00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:23.723\nof incident management here\n&gt;&gt; We've already just taken a look in that\n\n26\n00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:26.200\nlittle previous segment that we did.\n\n27\n00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.650\nComparing the difference, and\nnow that I know the difference,\n\n28\n00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.386\nJo, what do I need to understand\nin incident management?\n\n29\n00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:36.223\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so as you said, last time,\nwe did a very sort of brief session on\n\n30\n00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:39.040\nthe difference between an incident and\na problem.\n\n31\n00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.837\nAnd therefore why we would want to\nseparate incident management and\n\n32\n00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:47.566\nproblem management, because quite clearly\nwe're looking at two different things\n\n33\n00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:50.020\nwith two different objectives.\n\n34\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.112\nNow we're going to delve further\ninto incident management.\n\n35\n00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:57.783\nAnd we're going to take a look at what\nincident management is actually going to\n\n36\n00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:01.530\nfocus on, and\nthe objectives of incident management.\n\n37\n00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.500\nAnd we're going to look at an example\nof an incident management process flow.\n\n38\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.238\nAnd then following that,\n\n39\n00:02:06.238 --> 00:02:11.453\nonce we're finished with incident\nmanagement as a process, then we will take\n\n40\n00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:17.150\na further in-depth look into problem\nmanagement as well, in another session.\n\n41\n00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.590\nBut for the moment, we're going to\nconcentrate on incident management,\n\n42\n00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.870\nand we're going to look at how we\nrestore normal service operation.\n\n43\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, so\nrestoring normal service operations.\n\n44\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.605\nThat sounds like there's more\nsteps involved in the process, so\n\n45\n00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:33.896\nwhere is the first step for us to begin?\n\n46\n00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:35.426\n&gt;&gt; The first thing that we've gotta do is,\n\n47\n00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:38.550\nwe've gotta understand the objectives\nof incident management.\n\n48\n00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.500\nNow, in a previous session, I outlined\nthe purpose of incident management,\n\n49\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.900\nand it's in the bottom right hand\ncorner of your screen right now.\n\n50\n00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.910\nThe purpose of incident management is\nto restore normal service operation\n\n51\n00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.755\nas quickly as possible.\n\n52\n00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:57.667\nIt's all about minimizing the adverse\nimpact on business operations.\n\n53\n00:02:57.667 --> 00:03:04.687\nRemember, we are in a position where we\nare delivering value to the organization.\n\n54\n00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:11.960\nWe are in a position where we are running\na business as usual live environment.\n\n55\n00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.930\nSo we have to be able to\ndeliver those services,\n\n56\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.210\nat a level that has been previously\nagreed in the service level agreements.\n\n57\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.270\nAnd we have to ensure\nthat we deliver those\n\n58\n00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.400\nservices to add value to the business.\n\n59\n00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.405\nSo, the objectives of incident management\nis simply to restore normal service\n\n60\n00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:34.498\noperation as quickly as possible.\n\n61\n00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:40.385\nIt's to ensure that we use a standardized\nprocess for managing incidents.\n\n62\n00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:43.309\nIt's about consistency, and\nthat's a word I like to use.\n\n63\n00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:48.396\nBecause, of course, we have those two\ntenets of ITIL, the efficiency and\n\n64\n00:03:48.396 --> 00:03:53.915\neffectiveness, and consistency will\nhelp us towards that goal of efficiency.\n\n65\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.436\nIt’s about ensuring that our organization\nunderstands what we are trying to do for\n\n66\n00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:05.720\nthem in terms of delivering value, but\nalso in terms of restoration of service.\n\n67\n00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.568\nSometimes the complaints that you\nhear from organizations is that,\n\n68\n00:04:09.568 --> 00:04:14.142\nI reported an incident to the service\ndesk, I reported it 30 minutes ago and\n\n69\n00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:16.089\nI don’t know what’s happening.\n\n70\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.750\nThe scope of incident management and\n\n71\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.220\nthe objective of incident management\nis not just to restore normal service\n\n72\n00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.960\noperation, it's actually to ensure\nthat we deliver value in its entirety.\n\n73\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.291\nAnd that's about communication too,\neffective communication.\n\n74\n00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:33.872\nI never ever want to hear from anyone\nin the organization that they don't\n\n75\n00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:36.680\nunderstand what's\nhappening with an incident.\n\n76\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.750\nIf you've reported an incident\nto the service desk and\n\n77\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.290\nto IT, then it's important that we keep\nyou up to date with what's happening.\n\n78\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.594\nBecause if we don't\nmanage your expectations,\n\n79\n00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:49.358\nif you don't know what's\nhappening with your incident.\n\n80\n00:04:49.358 --> 00:04:54.308\nThen you could decide that well,\nmaybe I can do other things\n\n81\n00:04:54.308 --> 00:04:58.780\nright now while you're\nworking on that incident.\n\n82\n00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.980\nIt's about efficient use\nof your time as well.\n\n83\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.320\nSo we want to improve our\ncommunication as well\n\n84\n00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.210\nas improve the time that we restore\nnormal service operation, as we say.\n\n85\n00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.500\nAnd it's all about being professional,\nit's about adopting that business focus.\n\n86\n00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.960\nBecause everything that we do\nis to support our organization,\n\n87\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.060\nis to support our business.\n\n88\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.591\nIt's to deliver value to them and\nalign ourselves with them.\n\n89\n00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:27.932\nWhich means that we have got\nto communicate with them, and\n\n90\n00:05:27.932 --> 00:05:30.760\nlet them know what's happening.\n\n91\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.760\nIt's about their priorities,\n\n92\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.680\nit's not down to me to decide\nwhat I want to work on next.\n\n93\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.473\nIt's about what's important\nto our business, and\n\n94\n00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:42.656\nwhat our organization tells me\nthey want me to work on next.\n\n95\n00:05:42.656 --> 00:05:46.072\nLook at that bottom bullet\npoint under the objective,\n\n96\n00:05:46.072 --> 00:05:49.810\nmaintaining customer and\nuser satisfaction.\n\n97\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.010\nAnd the service quality is not just about\nwhat it looks like on the screen, but\n\n98\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.010\nit's about the delivery with our\nservice that we give to you.\n\n99\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.040\nSo an incident,\n\n100\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.960\nas we explored in the last topic,\nan incident is an interruption to service.\n\n101\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.660\nNow we explored in the last topic or\nthe topic before that,\n\n102\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.760\nwe looked at event management.\n\n103\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.776\nAnd an event is any change of\nstate that has significance for\n\n104\n00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:17.474\nthe IT infrastructure.\n\n105\n00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:21.721\nWhich means that an event is\nsomething that's happened, and\n\n106\n00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:27.534\nwe looked at events being informational,\nbackups starting or backups finishing.\n\n107\n00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:29.499\nWe looked at warning events,\n\n108\n00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:35.590\nwe looked at exceptional events where\nsomething is broken, something has failed.\n\n109\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.182\nWell, that means then if an incident\nis an interruption to service,\n\n110\n00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:44.625\nthat means that an incident is\nactually by definition, an event.\n\n111\n00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:46.683\nSomething's happened, so\n\n112\n00:06:46.683 --> 00:06:52.010\nan incident is any event that either\ndisrupts or could disrupt a service.\n\n113\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.340\nBecause an incident is\nan interruption to or\n\n114\n00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:04.450\na reduction in the quality of service,\nas I explained in our last section.\n\n115\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.490\nSo an incident is not just about\na piece of paper being ripped in two,\n\n116\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.800\nbut an incident is any event that\ndegrades the quality of service.\n\n117\n00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.850\nSo it's about not being able to use\nthat piece of paper as your service,\n\n118\n00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.968\nnot being able to write on it.\n\n119\n00:07:23.968 --> 00:07:28.522\nSo an incident is any event that the the\ndisrupt or could disrupt a service, and\n\n120\n00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:31.220\nit's a reduction in\nthe quality of a service.\n\n121\n00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.310\nWhere do you think, let me ask you,\n\n122\n00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.670\nRonnie, where do you think that\ndefinition of a service is to be found?\n\n123\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.330\n&gt;&gt; I would assume it would found\nunder the service level agreement,\n\n124\n00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.816\nthat's my assumption.\n\n125\n00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:47.549\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you'd be exactly right.\n\n126\n00:07:47.549 --> 00:07:48.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH].\n\n127\n00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:55.050\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, service is defined\nin the SLA, why is that important?\n\n128\n00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.691\nWell, it's really important\nto incident management.\n\n129\n00:07:56.691 --> 00:08:01.704\nWithout service level management process,\nwe couldn't define an incident,\n\n130\n00:08:01.704 --> 00:08:05.684\nbecause an incident is defined\nas an interruption to service.\n\n131\n00:08:05.684 --> 00:08:07.994\nWell, if you don't know\nwhat a service looks like,\n\n132\n00:08:07.994 --> 00:08:09.790\nthen how do you know what an incident is?\n\n133\n00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.490\nSo let's say, that my service means that,\n\n134\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.100\nnow I need you to use\nyour imagination here.\n\n135\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.790\nMy service means that every morning\nI go to that printer over there.\n\n136\n00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.140\nThere's a printer over there, we're\nimagining it, and it's nice, it's fancy,\n\n137\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.920\nit looks really good.\n\n138\n00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.180\nWe go to that printer over there,\nand we get our report.\n\n139\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.100\nAnd that's my service.\n\n140\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.964\nAnd every morning I go\nover to that printer and\n\n141\n00:08:35.964 --> 00:08:38.922\nI get that report in color, okay.\n\n142\n00:08:38.922 --> 00:08:43.940\nThis morning I went to that printer\nover there, and my report wasn't there.\n\n143\n00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.946\nSo my service has been interrupted,\nright, I mean that makes sense, yeah,\n\n144\n00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:50.020\nI didn't get my report.\n\n145\n00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.120\n&gt;&gt; All right\n&gt;&gt; So I call the service desk, and\n\n146\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.320\nI say to the service desk,\nI haven't got my report.\n\n147\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.390\nAnd they say, okay, there's no problem Jo,\n\n148\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.830\nI'll divert your report to\nthat printer over there.\n\n149\n00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.080\nAnd you can go and get that report\n,and it'll be in black and white.\n\n150\n00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.930\nOkay, so let me ask you another question.\n\n151\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n152\n00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.570\n&gt;&gt; Has my service been restored?\n\n153\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.400\n&gt;&gt; Not fully restored,\naccording to the Service Level Agreement.\n\n154\n00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.970\n&gt;&gt; But I didn't tell you what was\nin the Service Level Agreement.\n\n155\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.015\n&gt;&gt; That's true, you did not.\n\n156\n00:09:24.015 --> 00:09:25.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n157\n00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.629\nwhat we have in the example\nthough is a work-around.\n\n158\n00:09:28.629 --> 00:09:29.202\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n159\n00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:32.890\n&gt;&gt; But has service has been restored, or\nnot is really down to what's in the SLA.\n\n160\n00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:33.870\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n161\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:39.250\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if the SLA states that\nmy service is that report in\n\n162\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:44.330\ncolor from this printer over here, then\n\n163\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.990\nif it's that specific an explanation,\nthen having my report in black and\n\n164\n00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.810\nwhite from that printer over there\n&gt;&gt; That's not a restoration of service.\n\n165\n00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n166\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:00.270\n&gt;&gt; But if in the SLA my service is\ndescribed as simply that report,\n\n167\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.440\nthat output, then actually it doesn't\nmatter where I get the report from.\n\n168\n00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.940\nAnd it doesn't matter whether it's in\nblack and white or whether it's in color.\n\n169\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.870\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n\n170\n00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.760\n&gt;&gt; So, service level management\nis key to incident management.\n\n171\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.800\nYou cannot define what an incident is.\n\n172\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.890\nYou cannot define if a service\nhas been interrupted, or\n\n173\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.720\ndegraded, or reduced in quality.\n\n174\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.540\nUnless you know what that service\nlooks like in the first place.\n\n175\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.660\nAnd the only place that we can go to for\nthat is service level management.\n\n176\n00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.240\nThat service level management is gonna\nhelp us with a few other things in\n\n177\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.520\nincident management too.\n\n178\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.250\nService level management also going to,\nif we going back to the slides.\n\n179\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:49.180\nIt's going to tell us what parameters\nwithin which we are supposed to get\n\n180\n00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.050\nthat service to.\n\n181\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.550\nTake a look at the third\nbullet point down under Scope.\n\n182\n00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.840\nAnd it talks about alerts\ngenerated from management tools.\n\n183\n00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.739\nNow if we go back to event management and\nwe talk about setting parameters in event\n\n184\n00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:06.077\nmanagement on which they will alert\nus if something is not quite right.\n\n185\n00:11:06.077 --> 00:11:10.432\nAnd something doesn't work the way it's\nsupposed to work, with those alert\n\n186\n00:11:10.432 --> 00:11:14.720\nparameters set based on the targets\nwithin service level agreement again.\n\n187\n00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.690\nSo, all of these processes are actually\nintertwined to help us deliver value.\n\n188\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.880\nAn event management is\ngoing to tell us whether\n\n189\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.210\nan incident is happening right now.\n\n190\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.455\nOur users will always be\nthe first to tell us as well.\n\n191\n00:11:30.455 --> 00:11:32.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Especially when they notice something,\n\n192\n00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.430\nthey'll be straight on the phone or\nstraight onto email.\n\n193\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.980\nSo, we rely on them for\nthat information too.\n\n194\n00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.712\nWe don't just rely on event management.\n\n195\n00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:43.580\nBut again, we looked at balance\nin one of our previous.\n\n196\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.921\nSections and again, we focus on that\nbalance between being proactive and\n\n197\n00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:48.628\nreactive.\n\n198\n00:11:48.628 --> 00:11:53.024\nYou see, event management proactively will\ntell us whether there's been an incident\n\n199\n00:11:53.024 --> 00:11:54.900\nbefore the users have even noticed.\n\n200\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.020\nWhere as,\n\n201\n00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.650\nwe still have to react to incident\nmanagement when a failure has occurred,\n\n202\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:06.890\nthat the users have noticed and event\nmanagement hasn't necessarily noticed.\n\n203\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.960\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, so in that last bullet\npoint that you have there under Scope,\n\n204\n00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.270\nit says however,\nnot all events then are incidences.\n\n205\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.660\nSo, how do we distinguish that when it\ncomes down to whether it's an event or\n\n206\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.680\njust an incident that we're talking about?\n\n207\n00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nan incident is an exceptional event.\n\n208\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n209\n00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.755\n&gt;&gt; So an incident is a type of event.\n\n210\n00:12:26.755 --> 00:12:27.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n211\n00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.040\n&gt;&gt; But it's an event that's\neither an exception or a warning.\n\n212\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.800\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n213\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.430\n&gt;&gt; Because an incident is defined\nas an interruption to a service or\n\n214\n00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.400\nreduction in a quality of a service.\n\n215\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.130\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n216\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.820\n&gt;&gt; So, let me get a little bit\ntechnical here for a moment.\n\n217\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's imagine that we have got\n\n218\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.787\ntwo service, and\nthey're both running in a marriage way.\n\n219\n00:12:48.787 --> 00:12:49.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n220\n00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n221\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:55.280\n&gt;&gt; And both of these service are providing\nthis email service to our end users.\n\n222\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.870\nAnd what we would consider\nto be the backup server or\n\n223\n00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.476\nthe fail over server goes down.\n\n224\n00:13:01.476 --> 00:13:02.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n225\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.060\n&gt;&gt; For whatever reason.\n\n226\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.880\nHas the service been interrupted?\n\n227\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:07.850\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n228\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.270\n&gt;&gt; No, okay so you might say,\nwell that's not an incident.\n\n229\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:11.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n230\n00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.585\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but its definitely and event.\n\n231\n00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:14.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n232\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.900\n&gt;&gt; And an alert, well if being generated\nto say, hey, this has happened and\n\n233\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.450\nit would be a warning alert.\n\n234\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.630\nNevertheless, service hasn't been\ninterrupted, so do we raise an incident?\n\n235\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.290\nWell an incident is also,\n\n236\n00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:32.250\nif we go back to that bullet point\nThe first bullet point in Scope,\n\n237\n00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.690\nan incident is an event that either\ndisrupts, or could disrupt a service.\n\n238\n00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:41.460\nAnd an incident is also defined as\na reduction in the quality of a service.\n\n239\n00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.500\nThe quality of the service\nis defined in the SLA.\n\n240\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.130\nSo if the SLA says that,\nthat email service\n\n241\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.865\nhas two servers that are marriage and\none fails, it's still an incident.\n\n242\n00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:54.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n243\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.425\n&gt;&gt; It's a warning event and\nit's an incident.\n\n244\n00:13:56.425 --> 00:13:59.240\n&gt;&gt; Not.\n&gt;&gt; But in incident is where something has\n\n245\n00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.630\nhappened that has a detrimental\neffect on the service.\n\n246\n00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.445\nSo informational events are not incidents.\n\n247\n00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:07.390\nOkay.\n\n248\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.270\n&gt;&gt; Because that's just somebody\nlogging on, and somebody logging off.\n\n249\n00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.400\nThat's not incident.\n\n250\n00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.436\n&gt;&gt; All right so Jo,\nagain even though you just said this,\n\n251\n00:14:16.436 --> 00:14:20.729\nwhich disrupts or could disrupt.\n\n252\n00:14:20.729 --> 00:14:23.670\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So help me distinguish that a little\n\n253\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.700\nbit more than, because I understand\nthe idea of disrupting a service,\n\n254\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.895\nbut it sounds like that the fail of\nthat one server, it is possible that,\n\n255\n00:14:32.895 --> 00:14:36.405\nthat could be a disrupting event.\n\n256\n00:14:36.405 --> 00:14:39.050\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nwhich is why we'd raise an incident.\n\n257\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.555\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n258\n00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:42.877\n&gt;&gt; Let me take you back\nto a previous session.\n\n259\n00:14:42.877 --> 00:14:47.547\n&gt;&gt; And in a previous session,\nwe talked about having availability\n\n260\n00:14:47.547 --> 00:14:51.367\ntargets in our service level agreement,\nand about the Email service being\n\n261\n00:14:51.367 --> 00:14:56.447\navailable from eight in the morning\nuntil 6pm, or 1800, whatever you prefer.\n\n262\n00:14:57.527 --> 00:15:02.730\nSo let's just say then,\nthat one of those merit servers\n\n263\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.300\nwent down, but it was the live one,\nit wasn't the backup,\n\n264\n00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.130\nit wasn't the redundant one,\nit was the live one went down,\n\n265\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.150\nat quarter to eight in the morning\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n266\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.090\n&gt;&gt; Now, service hasn't been interrupted\n\n267\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:22.630\nbecause service doesn't start\nuntil 8 AM as part of the SLA,\n\n268\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.120\ntargets in the SLA\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n269\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.240\nsurely you'd wanna raise\nan incident right?\n\n270\n00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.420\n&gt;&gt; I probably would, but\nam I wrong in doing that?\n\n271\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.155\n&gt;&gt; No, of course not.\n\n272\n00:15:32.155 --> 00:15:33.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because you see,\n\n273\n00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.390\nyou have to raise an incident where\nservice might be interrupted.\n\n274\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.929\nIt could interrupt service.\n\n275\n00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:41.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; At that point in time.\n\n276\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.730\nSo even though it's outside\nof those targets in the SLA,\n\n277\n00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:50.440\nservice could be interrupted, and\ntherefore, we have to raise an incident.\n\n278\n00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.625\nBecause the aim is to ensure that we\nadhere to, we deliver to, or meet, or\n\n279\n00:15:55.625 --> 00:16:00.658\nexceed as it says in the books,\nthe targets that are in the SLA.\n\n280\n00:16:00.658 --> 00:16:04.507\nAnd if the target says that email\nneeds to be available at 8:00 AM,\n\n281\n00:16:04.507 --> 00:16:07.132\nthen Email need to be\navailable at 8:00 AM.\n\n282\n00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:10.103\nAnd if it's not available at 7:45 AM.\n\n283\n00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:13.449\nThen it's probably not going\nto be available at 8 AM.\n\n284\n00:16:13.449 --> 00:16:14.065\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n285\n00:16:14.065 --> 00:16:17.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we wanna deliver value.\n\n286\n00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n287\n00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.550\n&gt;&gt; We're not going to deliver value\nif we turn around at 8 AM and\n\n288\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.410\nsay to our users well,\nwe had a problem but\n\n289\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.340\nwe couldn't raise an incident record for\nthe last 15 minutes.\n\n290\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.210\nAnd we don't exactly know what it was\nbecause we decided not to work on it for\n\n291\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.500\nthose 15 minutes cuz we didn't\nwanna raise an incident record.\n\n292\n00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.560\nBut now that the SLA's kicked in,\nwe'll raise an incident now.\n\n293\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.090\nSo I hope you don't mind, but you'll\nget your service back in, I don't know,\n\n294\n00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.369\nmaybe 15, 20 minutes?\n\n295\n00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:44.350\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n296\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they wouldn't be happy.\n\n297\n00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:48.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we can't really go with that one\n\n298\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.210\nbecause ultimately, it's about\nvalue to the business after all.\n\n299\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.243\nAnd that's exactly what it is\nthat we're trying to achieve,\n\n300\n00:16:57.243 --> 00:17:01.053\nis reducing unplanned costs\nbecause of incidents,\n\n301\n00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:05.960\nlowering downtime,\nwe want to increase uptime.\n\n302\n00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.850\nWhat I said about delivering\nvalue to the business and\n\n303\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:15.820\nabout prioritizing our incidents,\nearlier on during a previous session,\n\n304\n00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.380\nabout me picking and choosing what\nit is I want to work on, well,\n\n305\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.392\nI also mentioned that I don't do that.\n\n306\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:26.306\nThe organization tells me\nwhat my priorities are.\n\n307\n00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:30.154\nAnd we'll talk about priorities\nin a little while when we\n\n308\n00:17:30.154 --> 00:17:35.134\ngo through the incident process, or\nthe example of an incident process.\n\n309\n00:17:35.134 --> 00:17:39.861\nWe also like to, well,\nit's best practice, let's face it,\n\n310\n00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:46.720\nit's not just a case of liking to, we like\nto take a look at previous incidents.\n\n311\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:53.510\nSee what exactly happened and use those to\nhelp us prevent incidents in the future.\n\n312\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.599\nNow we call that proactive\nproblem management.\n\n313\n00:17:55.599 --> 00:18:00.712\nAnd when we look at problem management\nwe'll delve a lot more in-depth into that.\n\n314\n00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:05.129\nBut this is basically about reducing\nthe impact to the organization.\n\n315\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.270\nIncident management could\nalso serve as a point\n\n316\n00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.440\nto identify training requirements\nwithin the user community, too.\n\n317\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.430\nIf we're getting a lot of incidents\nbecause of a lack of awareness out in\n\n318\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.590\nthe user community then that can\nactually help us train our users and\n\n319\n00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.650\ntrain our customers.\n\n320\n00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.811\nAnd I'm not just talking about\ngiving them work arounds or\n\n321\n00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:30.663\ngiving them tape as I used\nin that previous session.\n\n322\n00:18:30.663 --> 00:18:32.175\nI'm not talking about that, but\n\n323\n00:18:32.175 --> 00:18:35.793\nI'm talking about educating them maybe to\nstop ripping that piece of paper up in\n\n324\n00:18:35.793 --> 00:18:39.250\nthe first place if we can explain to\nthem why they really shouldn't do that.\n\n325\n00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:46.320\nSo let's think about incident\nmanagement itself and\n\n326\n00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.275\nthe sort of policies then that we need\nto have in incident management, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:56.181\nWe've already talked about targets and\nthe fact that we have to ensure\n\n328\n00:18:56.181 --> 00:19:00.684\nthat service is available as per\nthe targets that are in the SLA.\n\n329\n00:19:00.684 --> 00:19:03.715\nWe also have other targets,\ntoo, in our SLA.\n\n330\n00:19:03.715 --> 00:19:07.125\nWe'll have targets for incident response.\n\n331\n00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:10.385\nWe may even have targets for\nincident resolution.\n\n332\n00:19:10.385 --> 00:19:14.505\nWe'll probably have targets for\ncustomer and user satisfaction as well.\n\n333\n00:19:14.505 --> 00:19:17.235\nBecause ultimately we want\nto keep our users happy.\n\n334\n00:19:17.235 --> 00:19:20.665\nWe want to ensure that we're\ndelivering value to the business.\n\n335\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.491\nThis means that in order\nto achieve these targets,\n\n336\n00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:30.992\nwe have to effectively\nlog all of our incidents.\n\n337\n00:19:30.992 --> 00:19:36.420\nThat's not just the ones that are reported\nto the service desk by the users.\n\n338\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.480\nThat's all of our incidents.\n\n339\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.567\nNow sure, we're gonna use event\nmanagement to help us with that and\n\n340\n00:19:41.567 --> 00:19:43.900\nevent management can log incidents for us.\n\n341\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.417\nBut it also means the one from your\nfriend, your friend who works in that\n\n342\n00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:52.935\ndepartment over there, and who just\ncalled you just on the off chance,\n\n343\n00:19:52.935 --> 00:19:57.112\nor maybe sent you a text just to say,\ncould you help out with that?\n\n344\n00:19:57.112 --> 00:20:01.735\nAnd then the one where you dropped\neverything and worked on that?\n\n345\n00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:06.245\nYeah, we've also got to\naddress those incidents.\n\n346\n00:20:06.245 --> 00:20:09.680\nAnd if we're going to address them,\nthen they gotta be logged.\n\n347\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.510\nWe need to have an accurate perspective\non how many incidents we have.\n\n348\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.150\nAnd need to have an accurate perspective\non the prioritization of those\n\n349\n00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.700\nincidents and the impact to the business.\n\n350\n00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.198\nSo we'll tell you that you need to have\na tool for logging your incidents.\n\n351\n00:20:26.198 --> 00:20:28.890\nThat tool has to help you\nmanage those incidents and\n\n352\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.780\nit has to help you manage those\ntargets as well that we've agreed to.\n\n353\n00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:38.064\nSo I'd expect your tool to show\nup alert messages themselves\n\n354\n00:20:38.064 --> 00:20:40.606\nthat will actually tell us that, hey,\n\n355\n00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:45.333\nthis incident is about to breach its\nservice level target for response.\n\n356\n00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:51.480\nAnd those targets will be set based\non the priorities of those incidents.\n\n357\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.600\nAnd on a regular basis, and this is where\na continual service improvement comes\n\n358\n00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.660\ninto this, on a regular basis, all of\nour incident policies should be audited.\n\n359\n00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.060\nIn other words, they should be checked for\nrelevance, okay?\n\n360\n00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.550\nThey should be checked for efficiency,\nthey should be checked for effectiveness.\n\n361\n00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:16.150\nAnd effectiveness means relevance,\nand efficiency means minimal waste.\n\n362\n00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.390\nIt doesn't mean getting through\na process as quickly as possible.\n\n363\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.720\nBut it means delivering an outcome\nas quickly as possible.\n\n364\n00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.986\nAnd giving the service back to\nthe organization as quickly as we possibly\n\n365\n00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:33.182\ncan while still achieving the desired\nresult of service restoration.\n\n366\n00:21:35.325 --> 00:21:37.279\nSo, what are the basic concepts then?\n\n367\n00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:40.752\nWell, as we already said,\nwe're gonna have targets, and\n\n368\n00:21:40.752 --> 00:21:43.880\nthose targets are going to be in the SLA.\n\n369\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.093\nThey're going to be\ncaptured as OLA targets for\n\n370\n00:21:47.093 --> 00:21:50.074\nwhen we transfer incidents to other teams.\n\n371\n00:21:50.074 --> 00:21:54.730\nAnd we'll talk about that a little\nbit more in a little while.\n\n372\n00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.635\nWe also cover that in a lot more depth\nwhen we look at service level management\n\n373\n00:21:58.635 --> 00:22:00.535\nin the service design class as well.\n\n374\n00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:02.266\nAnd as I've already said,\n\n375\n00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:07.397\nwe're gonna use our incident management\ncall logging tool to help us with this.\n\n376\n00:22:07.397 --> 00:22:12.060\nNow the concept of models\nis an interesting concept.\n\n377\n00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.730\nIt's about achieving efficiency\nwithin our processes.\n\n378\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:22.192\nIt's about understanding that sometimes\nwe do the same thing over and over again.\n\n379\n00:22:22.192 --> 00:22:26.834\nAnd if you look in your materials, your\ndownloaded materials over the next two to\n\n380\n00:22:26.834 --> 00:22:31.681\nthree slides, you'll see that we've got\nan incident management process flow that\n\n381\n00:22:31.681 --> 00:22:35.450\nwe're going to look at in a little\nmore depth in the next session.\n\n382\n00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:42.433\nDo you want to stick to that process\nflow for every single incident?\n\n383\n00:22:42.433 --> 00:22:45.109\nWell, no, of course not.\n\n384\n00:22:45.109 --> 00:22:48.700\nI want to be able to restore\nservice as quickly as possible.\n\n385\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.186\nWhich means that even though I need\nto follow a structured process,\n\n386\n00:22:55.186 --> 00:22:57.400\nI want to be efficient too.\n\n387\n00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.500\nSo what we do is we\npredefine sets of steps.\n\n388\n00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:07.130\nWe still have a process, of course we do,\nand it's still a structured process.\n\n389\n00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:12.460\nBut we predefine those steps that we can.\n\n390\n00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.480\nAnd we'll look a little bit more in\ndepth in that as we look at the incident\n\n391\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.390\nprocess flow in a moment,\nin our next section.\n\n392\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.680\nWe're also going to talk in the next\nsection about escalation and\n\n393\n00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.610\nabout hierarchical and functional\nescalation, and about setting priorities.\n\n394\n00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:33.520\nBut just as a recap, really,\na winding up to this particular section,\n\n395\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.630\nI want to mention major incidents.\n\n396\n00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.200\nAnd the last topic we're going to\ncover here is the understanding that\n\n397\n00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.540\nsomething significant is going\nto happen to your organization.\n\n398\n00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.990\nWhether you want it to or not, and\nit doesn't matter how proactive you are,\n\n399\n00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.630\nthere are some things\nthat we cannot avoid.\n\n400\n00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:55.097\nSo the organization will help you to\ndetermine, in the same way that they'll\n\n401\n00:23:55.097 --> 00:23:58.533\nhelp you to determine what\nservices are important to them,\n\n402\n00:23:58.533 --> 00:24:03.227\nthey'll help you to determine when an\nincident is considered a major incident.\n\n403\n00:24:03.227 --> 00:24:07.274\nIn other words,\nit has significant disruption to them,\n\n404\n00:24:07.274 --> 00:24:11.842\nto the business, to our achievement\nof corporate objectives.\n\n405\n00:24:11.842 --> 00:24:18.440\nAnd in the instance of a major incident,\nthen we will have separate procedures.\n\n406\n00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.950\nThe separate procedures will allocate a\ndefined manager of that incident process.\n\n407\n00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:31.910\nThe process may differ depending\non the type of incident it is and\n\n408\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.210\nthe service that it is.\n\n409\n00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:37.240\nAnd of course, we've got models for\nthat, predefined steps, for\n\n410\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:42.320\neach type of major incident and predefined\nsteps for each service, potentially.\n\n411\n00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.100\nBut it will have a defined owner.\n\n412\n00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.720\nAnd with a major incident, when we\nhave gone through all of our steps,\n\n413\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.930\nwe will always,\nin conjunction with problem management,\n\n414\n00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.350\nconduct what we call\na major incident review.\n\n415\n00:24:55.350 --> 00:25:00.150\nAnd that's to conduct lessons learned and\nto see whether we can improve\n\n416\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:04.710\nthe efficiency of that process in\nthe future to get everything up and\n\n417\n00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.000\nrunning again,\nrestore service even quicker.\n\n418\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.860\nOkay, so the last bullet point on this\nslide, just to wrap up this session,\n\n419\n00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.302\nreally involves incident tracking.\n\n420\n00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:15.790\nAnd I mentioned a tool.\n\n421\n00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.305\nAnd I said that we needed to have\na tool in place that can help us\n\n422\n00:25:20.305 --> 00:25:25.090\nmanage our incidents,\nthat will allow us to log incidents, and\n\n423\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.500\nthen will give us consistency.\n\n424\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.540\nThat tool will also allow for\nalerts and will allow us to identify\n\n425\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.960\nwhat incidents are in danger of\nbreaching the service level targets.\n\n426\n00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.000\nThat tool will allow us to\ntrack every incident throughout\n\n427\n00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.980\nits life and it will also allow us to\nproduce management information that will\n\n428\n00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:52.360\nshow whether we are indeed meeting\nthe targets to find in the SLA and\n\n429\n00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.470\nwhether we are indeed delivering\nvalue to the organization.\n\n430\n00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.946\nSo, to summarize,\nIncident management is about restoring\n\n431\n00:26:01.946 --> 00:26:05.926\nnormal service operation\nas quickly as possible.\n\n432\n00:26:05.926 --> 00:26:10.428\nAnd an incident is any event\nthat either disrupts, or\n\n433\n00:26:10.428 --> 00:26:16.810\ncould disrupt, service as defined\nin the service level agreement.\n\n434\n00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:21.965\nAnd of course, as we've already looked at,\nwithout that service level agreement,\n\n435\n00:26:21.965 --> 00:26:24.910\nincident management is very,\nvery difficult.\n\n436\n00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.739\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo,\nthere's a lot of different things\n\n437\n00:26:27.739 --> 00:26:32.293\nin perhaps this particular episode in\nincident management that might require\n\n438\n00:26:32.293 --> 00:26:35.990\na little bit more in-depth thought for\nus to go through.\n\n439\n00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.250\nAre there any helps in our\ncourse that we can provide for\n\n440\n00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.910\nthose that are viewing it right\nnow to just take advantage of?\n\n441\n00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:47.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we have exercises available for\neverybody, and\n\n442\n00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.400\nat the end of the next section that we do,\n\n443\n00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.960\nwe have some specific exercises that look\nat the incident management process flow.\n\n444\n00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.093\nAt the end of this section,\nwhat I would like everybody to do, and\n\n445\n00:26:58.093 --> 00:27:00.650\nwhat I would recommend everybody does,\n\n446\n00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:05.558\nis to go over the process objectives and\nthe purpose of incident management.\n\n447\n00:27:05.558 --> 00:27:08.193\nAnd also get themselves familiar and\n\n448\n00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:13.463\ncomfortable with the definition of\nan incident, especially as directed\n\n449\n00:27:13.463 --> 00:27:18.234\nto Problem Management 2 because\nthat's very, very important.\n\n450\n00:27:18.234 --> 00:27:22.623\nAs we delve further into incident\nmanagement, and into problem management in\n\n451\n00:27:22.623 --> 00:27:26.690\nfuture sessions, then we need to\nensure that that distinction is made.\n\n452\n00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.020\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us out and\n\n453\n00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.710\nlearning a little bit more about\nthe idea of incident management as well.\n\n454\n00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.620\nAnd being able to take advantage some of\nthe stuff that we actually saw right here,\n\n455\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.500\nas well as what we have\nin our course material.\n\n456\n00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.838\nAnd that means it's a great time for us to\ngo ahead and sign off for this episode.\n\n457\n00:27:44.838 --> 00:27:47.546\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n458\n00:27:47.546 --> 00:27:49.016\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Joe Peacock.\n\n459\n00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:53.448\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation shows.\n\n460\n00:27:53.448 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.546 --> 00:00:08.438\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:12.440\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.290\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.070\nWe are about to get started here.\n\n8\n00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.440\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n9\n00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.770\nand today we're gonna take a look at\nIncident Management Process Flow,\n\n10\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.528\nand here to help us out, of course,\nis going to be well our ITIL guru,\n\n11\n00:00:32.528 --> 00:00:36.450\nextraordinaire Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.560\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nthank you very much for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.065\nHow are you?\n\n15\n00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:41.630\n.&gt; I am doing fine, Jo.\n\n16\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.020\nNow as we take a look,\n\n17\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.400\nwe've already talked about Incident\nManagement in pretty decent depth here.\n\n18\n00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.280\nWhen we get into the process\nflow of things, what are we\n\n19\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.880\nreally taking a look at now that we have\nkind of the foundations down of that?\n\n20\n00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what we're going to\ndo in this particular section\n\n21\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.920\nis we're going to look at a sample\nof an incident process flow.\n\n22\n00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.930\nNow, it's very clear right from\nthe very start within ITIL that\n\n23\n00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.210\nITIL is a framework.\n\n24\n00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.040\nAnd as a framework, we will encourage\norganizations to adopt the framework.\n\n25\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.950\nBut then it has to be adapted to suit\nthe needs of the organization for\n\n26\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.510\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n\n27\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.770\nBecause let's face it,\nno two organizations are the same.\n\n28\n00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.430\nSo what we have here is just an example\nof an incident management process flow.\n\n29\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.247\nWhat your incident management process flow\nwould look like is completely different to\n\n30\n00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:40.250\nwhat somebody else's incident\nmanagement process flow will look like.\n\n31\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.950\nNo two organizations are the same.\n\n32\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.360\nEven organizations that on the surface\nappears to be doing exactly the same\n\n33\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.070\nthing, they were working a slightly\ndifferent way, depending on perhaps\n\n34\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.160\ngeographical location or perhaps depending\non the strategy of the organization.\n\n35\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.645\nSo no two processes will look the same.\n\n36\n00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:03.595\nNow in a previous section,\nwe talked about models and\n\n37\n00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:06.625\nwe talked about pre-defining\nsome of the steps, and\n\n38\n00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:11.625\nwhat we're just going to look at here\nis the steps that we need to go through\n\n39\n00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:16.075\nwithin incident management in order\nto restore normal service operation.\n\n40\n00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:18.995\nThat doesn't mean that we have to\ngo through all of these steps,\n\n41\n00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:21.575\nwe can pre-define some of these steps and\n\n42\n00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:26.500\nso, what I'm gonna do here is just\ngive you an example of a process flow.\n\n43\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.070\nAnd we're going to look at some\nof the key characteristics\n\n44\n00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.560\nof each particular process.\n\n45\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.690\nWe're going to look at what can be\npredefined, what can't be predefined and\n\n46\n00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.490\nhow we can achieve that.\n\n47\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.520\nJo, that sounds great.\n\n48\n00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.420\nOne of the things that when I, I guess\nI first encountered the idea of ITIL,\n\n49\n00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.430\nI always came at it from the perspective,\n\n50\n00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.450\nright, of somebody implementing this\nstuff, and not understanding that term and\n\n51\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.990\nthat foundational idea of it being\na framework, which means it's not really\n\n52\n00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.700\nprescriptive of anything that we're doing\nbut it's more definitive of those things.\n\n53\n00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.210\nAnd so I think that if we're coming\nfrom an IT background sometimes and\n\n54\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.320\nwe're used to doing it,\n\n55\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.480\nwe always think that there's gotta be\nsomething prescriptive behind this.\n\n56\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.940\nBut the goal is to get us to be\nable to manage better not so\n\n57\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.250\nmuch as setting down every point, right.\n\n58\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nITIL is not a one size fits all approach.\n\n59\n00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.410\nIt doesn't work like that because\nno two organizations are the same.\n\n60\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.880\nITIL is not a pill that's going to cure\nall of the dysfunction within your IT\n\n61\n00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.820\norganization, either.\n\n62\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.900\nWe can't do that.\n\n63\n00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.250\nThe way that I look at it, let's say\nthat your IT organization was a living,\n\n64\n00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.800\nbreathing being.\n\n65\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.330\nAn animal, whatever that animal may be.\n\n66\n00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.200\nWhat we're going to do is we're\ngonna give you a skeleton and\n\n67\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.540\nwe're gonna tell you that you need\nthese bones, that's what you need.\n\n68\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.965\nBut we're not gonna tell you how\nhow to fit that skeleton together,\n\n69\n00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.565\nwe're going to give you some\npointers that will help you.\n\n70\n00:03:54.565 --> 00:03:58.805\nBut it's up to you as to what you\nwant that project to look like.\n\n71\n00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.535\nWhether you want it to have four legs or\nwhether you want it to have two arms or\n\n72\n00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:03.435\ntwo legs.\n\n73\n00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:07.745\nWhether you want it to have three eyes or\nwhether you want it to have one eye.\n\n74\n00:04:07.745 --> 00:04:11.190\nWhether you want it to have skin or\nwhether you want it to have fur.\n\n75\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.740\nEntirely up to you.\n\n76\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.990\nSo only you know what IT looks like for\nyour organization.\n\n77\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.010\nWe're going to give you a set of bones,\nand we're going to say,\n\n78\n00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.080\nyou need these bones, but\nit's up to you to make it into something\n\n79\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.630\nthat works for you and\nsomething that fits you.\n\n80\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.080\nAnd so that's why when you described it\nas looking very unique, even though we're\n\n81\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.750\nfollowing the same thing, it works that\nway, because it is that framework.\n\n82\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, and that's why,\nas I say, I describe it as a skeleton.\n\n83\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.285\nWe've all got one, and yet we all look\ncompletely different on the outside.\n\n84\n00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:47.025\n&gt;&gt; Alright Jo, so where are we going to\nbegin with this particular structure that\n\n85\n00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:48.375\nyou're talking about?\n\n86\n00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:52.745\n&gt;&gt; So in this session,\nwe're going to look through a example of\n\n87\n00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:56.595\nan ITIL incident management process.\n\n88\n00:04:56.595 --> 00:05:01.360\nNow this is the example that comes\nstraight out of the ideal books And so\n\n89\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.780\nwe're going to start off\nright at the very top,\n\n90\n00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.307\ncuz that's a very good place to start,\nisn't it?\n\n91\n00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:08.210\n[LAUGH] And so we're going to look,\n\n92\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.300\nfirst of all, in that first step\nthere at the incident identification.\n\n93\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.400\nAnd incidents are notified\nto us in 101 different ways.\n\n94\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.030\nIt could come from event management.\n\n95\n00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.120\nSo it could come automatically.\n\n96\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.777\nIt could come from the web interface\nwith user logging on to the web-based\n\n97\n00:05:26.777 --> 00:05:30.680\nfront end of the tool and\nlog into incident in that way.\n\n98\n00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.660\nIt could come from a phone call\nin to the service desk, or\n\n99\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.260\nit could come via an email.\n\n100\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.030\nNowadays it can come via text and a lot\nof our service management tools actually\n\n101\n00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.060\nhave apps associated with them, so\nyou could even log an incident via an app.\n\n102\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.150\nSo that's how we identify an incident,\n\n103\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.490\nand the first thing that we've got\nto do is we call this filtering.\n\n104\n00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.340\nAnd filtering is just\nsimply asking the question,\n\n105\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.480\nis this really an incident or\nis it a request?\n\n106\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.470\nIs it a request for something?\n\n107\n00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.330\nAnd the reason we do this is that\nsome organizations will, they\n\n108\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.470\nlike to manage request fulfillment through\ntheir instant management process flow.\n\n109\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.310\nAnd so we want to, first of all,\n\n110\n00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.740\nfilter that incident to make sure that,\nyes it's an incident.\n\n111\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.130\nThere's something wrong and we need to\nrestore service, or no, it's a request and\n\n112\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.490\nactually it's user asking\nif they can have something.\n\n113\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.270\nSo, let's assume then that this is\nan incident and normal service needs to be\n\n114\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.270\nrestored, in which case then, we're going\ndown the right-hand side of this slide.\n\n115\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.220\nIn which case then, we log the incident\nand then we would categorize the incident.\n\n116\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.740\nNow, this is where this looks\nentirely unique to you.\n\n117\n00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.550\nYou will notice that on the left hand side\nof the slide as you are looking at it\n\n118\n00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.380\nright now, there are two options\nthat are presented to you.\n\n119\n00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.810\nThe first one looks at the application or\nthe service and drills down into sort\n\n120\n00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.680\nof the application with sub categories\nof database or server or disk drive.\n\n121\n00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.067\nNow obviously that's a very, very\ntechnical way of looking at things and\n\n122\n00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:09.790\nI don't expect any of our\nusers to be able to do this.\n\n123\n00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.450\nAnd this would involve\na certain skill level and\n\n124\n00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.415\nthe service desk goes well\nto be able to do this.\n\n125\n00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:20.640\nSo, we could if we chose to or\nwe could categorize via\n\n126\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.620\nin the second instance that you've got,\nhey you could categorize via location.\n\n127\n00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.800\nAnd then location in the sub\ncategory be in service and\n\n128\n00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.640\nanother sub category being\napplication that is impacted.\n\n129\n00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.750\nYou could categorize that way.\n\n130\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.540\nYou could categorize by business unit.\n\n131\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.100\nYou could categorize by\ngeographical location.\n\n132\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.260\nYou could categorize by language.\n\n133\n00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.090\nYou could categorize by whether or\nnot that service is a VBF.\n\n134\n00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:54.580\nAnd VBF is an ITIL acronym that we\ndiscover in service strategy and\n\n135\n00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.930\nin service design.\n\n136\n00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.430\nAnd it means vital business function.\n\n137\n00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.910\nAnd a vital business function\nis a service that is\n\n138\n00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:08.260\ncritical to the operation\nof the organization.\n\n139\n00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.880\nSo it really is entirely up to you and,\nas I said,\n\n140\n00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.750\nthis process is going to look like what\nyou need the process to look like.\n\n141\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.140\nSo after categorization,\nthen we prioritize.\n\n142\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.820\nAnd we prioritize based on two things.\n\n143\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.700\nWe prioritize based on both impact and\nurgency.\n\n144\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.490\nSo, let me ask you a question then,\nRonnie.\n\n145\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.960\nSo let's say that our payroll goes\ndown two days before you get paid.\n\n146\n00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n147\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.590\n&gt;&gt; High impact or low impact?\n\n148\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.470\n&gt;&gt; High impact.\n\n149\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.190\n&gt;&gt; I would think so.\n\n150\n00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.720\nAnd what about urgency?\n\n151\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.540\nHigh or low?\n\n152\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.060\nUrgency would be pretty high.\n\n153\n00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.990\n&gt;&gt; Pretty high right because if that money\ndoesn't hit our accounts in two days’\n\n154\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.760\ntime, yeah, we're not going to be happy.\n\n155\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n156\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so I would set\na priority of probably one on that one.\n\n157\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.020\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n158\n00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:05.080\nSo let’s say the payroll goes down then\ntwo days after we've just been paid.\n\n159\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.590\nThat high impact or low impact?\n\n160\n00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.410\n&gt;&gt; That'd be low impact.\n\n161\n00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.590\n&gt;&gt; No it wouldn't.\n\n162\n00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.660\nThe impact is still exactly the same.\n\n163\n00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.140\nIt still impacts the same\nnumber of people.\n\n164\n00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, sure, right, okay.\n\n165\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.900\n&gt;&gt; It still impacts\nthe entire organization.\n\n166\n00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.430\n&gt;&gt; I get it, right.\n\n167\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.860\nBut then let's look at urgency.\n\n168\n00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.880\nHigh urgency or low urgency?\n\n169\n00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.710\n&gt;&gt; Low urgency.\n\n170\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nokay, so the urgency has been reduced.\n\n171\n00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:27.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n172\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.380\nthe priority in that case then is reduced.\n\n173\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n174\n00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.960\n&gt;&gt; So whilst before it was a priority\none two days before we got paid, now,\n\n175\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.792\ntwo days after we get paid\nthe priority may well be a three.\n\n176\n00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:45.860\nNow you're going to find a table for\nwhat is considered to be a priority one,\n\n177\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.990\nand a priority two, and a priority three\nIn a certain document that we think is\n\n178\n00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.230\nreally important to incident management\nand, of course, that is in the SLA.\n\n179\n00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:59.730\nThat service level agreement is going to\ntell us what constitutes priority one,\n\n180\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.620\nand what constitutes priority two,\n\n181\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.810\nthree, etc., depending on how many\nprioritization levels we go down to.\n\n182\n00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.540\nAnd we do that for efficiency purposes,\n\n183\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.530\nbecause It's not fair on a service\ndesk analyst to expect them\n\n184\n00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:20.300\nto make a call based on one phone\ncall as to what the impact is or\n\n185\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.460\nas to what the urgency is\nof any given incident, so\n\n186\n00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.280\nwe have it in the service level agreement\nwhere the customer has agreed to it.\n\n187\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.030\nThey've signed the SLA And where IT\nhave agreed to that prioritization too.\n\n188\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.743\nNow, I also mentioned\nin a previous section\n\n189\n00:10:37.743 --> 00:10:42.910\nthat we have targets assigned for\nincident management that\n\n190\n00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:48.090\nduring the incident management\nprocess itself, I expect the tool to\n\n191\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.150\nflag up when something is about to breach\nit's service level target for a response.\n\n192\n00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.030\nAgain, that's something else\nI expect to find in the SLA.\n\n193\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:02.360\nBecause again it's an agreement between\nthe customer and IT, where we will say,\n\n194\n00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.430\nokay then we would consider\nthan this to be a priority one.\n\n195\n00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.430\nAnd if this is a priority one,\n\n196\n00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.890\nthen we would respond to this\nwithin ten minutes for instance.\n\n197\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.500\nThat's just an example obviously, but\nthis comes part of the tailoring ITIL,\n\n198\n00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.540\nadapting it to suit your environment.\n\n199\n00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.190\nI can't give you a table of defaults on\n\n200\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.770\nwhat I expect your\nprioritization to look like.\n\n201\n00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:32.000\nThat's prioritization,\nagreed with the customer.\n\n202\n00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.990\nSo then let's go onto the next step then.\n\n203\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.060\nAnd the next step there looks at\nwhether it's a major incident.\n\n204\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.610\nAnd I've already discussed with\nyou in a previous section that if\n\n205\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:45.290\nit's a major incident, then we have\na separate major incident procedure.\n\n206\n00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:50.360\nAnd that separate major incident procedure\nwill outline who the owner of that\n\n207\n00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.210\nincident is and who takes accountability\nfor ensuring that the incident progresses\n\n208\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:01.090\nthroughout it's life cycle, that it\nadheres to its service level targets and\n\n209\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.710\nthat it is communicated\nto the organization.\n\n210\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:11.609\nSo then, if it's not a major incident,\nthen we'll diagnose as any other incident.\n\n211\n00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.830\nAnd so there's an example on this\nslide here of what prioritization\n\n212\n00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.892\nmight look like based on that\nlast conversation that we had.\n\n213\n00:12:20.892 --> 00:12:25.630\nAnd as I said, I expect so\nsee this in the service level agreement.\n\n214\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.100\nSo, now we are going to investigate.\n\n215\n00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.030\nAnd we can do this next step by\nthe way at any point in time.\n\n216\n00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.580\nAnd the next step is escalation.\n\n217\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.560\nAnd if you have been presented with\nan incident that is considered to be that\n\n218\n00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.120\nVBF, that vital business function,\nthen I expect escalation,\n\n219\n00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.900\ncertainly hierarchical escalation,\nto happen immediately.\n\n220\n00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:56.300\nSo hierarchical escalation means quite\nsimply escalating to senior management.\n\n221\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.830\nWhereas, functional escalation means\n\n222\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.310\nescalating to another team or\nanother functional area.\n\n223\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.660\nSo I'm gonna ask you another question,\nRonnie.\n\n224\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.650\nWhy do think we might want to\nescalate to senior management?\n\n225\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.580\nWhy would we want to\nescalate hierarchically?\n\n226\n00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.270\nIf a decision that needs to be made and\n\n227\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.830\nwe're not sure if we actually\nhave the authority to make it.\n\n228\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.570\nThat's my guess.\n\n229\n00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's quite a good guess actually.\n\n230\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'd escalate usually for\n\n231\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.750\ntwo reasons and\none of which is for a awareness.\n\n232\n00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because senior\n\n233\n00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.060\nmanagement obviously want to know\nexactly what is impacting the business.\n\n234\n00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.330\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; And we also escalate for\n\n235\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.520\ndedicated resources.\n\n236\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n237\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.330\n&gt;&gt; For decisions to be made.\n\n238\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.960\nSometimes, we might have to spend\nmoney in order to restore service.\n\n239\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.780\nSometimes, we might need dedicated\nresources functionally too.\n\n240\n00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.980\nSo, and it happens,\nlet's face it, we're in IT.\n\n241\n00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.740\nWe're incident management here and\nwe escalate an incident to,\n\n242\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.730\nsay, another support team and\nthen they take a look at it and\n\n243\n00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.210\nthink that it's really not\ngot anything to do with them.\n\n244\n00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.840\nAnd so it gets passed on to somebody\nelse and then they take a look at it and\n\n245\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.780\nthey think, well it's really\nnot a network problem, it's\n\n246\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.980\ndefinitely a server problem so we pass\nit to somebody else, and you know what?\n\n247\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.190\nWe've got these targets in this\nservice level agreement, and\n\n248\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:24.100\nif we've got a four-hour resolution\ntarget in that SLA and then we've\n\n249\n00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.800\nspent three hours passing it around\nfrom one functional area to another,\n\n250\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.160\nwe're pretty close to being\nin breach of that target.\n\n251\n00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.740\nSo we might choose to escalate\nhierarchically to get somebody to\n\n252\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.930\ntake ownership of that.\n\n253\n00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.940\nAnd it's something that you don't\nnecessarily want to admit happened.\n\n254\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.080\nBut we're in IT and\nsometimes it's difficult to\n\n255\n00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.660\nascertain exactly who\ncan fix that incident.\n\n256\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.760\nAt any point in time,\nas I have said, we can escalate and\n\n257\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.600\nthen we move into investigation and\ndiagnosis and then resolution identified.\n\n258\n00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.329\nOne thing that I want to\nsay about the resolution.\n\n259\n00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.940\nWe always notify our users.\n\n260\n00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.720\nRecovering means in the next step,\nrecovery means recovering data.\n\n261\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.220\nOkay?\n\n262\n00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:30.020\nResolution is about resolving and\nrestoring service.\n\n263\n00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.830\nSo, resolving what happened, maybe getting\nthat previous tape out from one of our\n\n264\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:40.300\nprevious episodes, and\nrecovery means recovering the data.\n\n265\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.460\nSo, we restore service and\nwe recover data.\n\n266\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.660\nNow, the next step there is incident\nclosure, and it's never going to be best\n\n267\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:53.910\npractice to close an incident without\nfirst confirming with the user\n\n268\n00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:59.230\nthat the incident has indeed been closed\nand that service has indeed been restored.\n\n269\n00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:06.470\nSo in terms of the three strikes I'm out\nrule that sometimes seems to be fairly\n\n270\n00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:12.920\npopular within I.T., designed to advocate\nthe three strikes and out rule, yes or no?\n\n271\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.060\nWell, if it's in the SLA and\n\n272\n00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.840\nit's been agreed by the customer,\nthan that's fine.\n\n273\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.280\nBecause don't forget,\n\n274\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.590\nthis is all about what you need\nincident management to look like.\n\n275\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:31.020\nYou see, we've got to provide\nvalue to our customers.\n\n276\n00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.820\nAnd not telling them that\nsomething's been restored, and\n\n277\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.510\nnot telling them that they've actually got\na resolution, that's not best practice and\n\n278\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.210\nthat's certainly not delivering value.\n\n279\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.820\nBut then pestering them\nevery ten minutes for\n\n280\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.910\na week because they haven't responded to\nyour phone calls or they haven't replied\n\n281\n00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.850\nto your emails, that's not\nnecessarily delivering value either.\n\n282\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.110\nSo how do we get around that?\n\n283\n00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.980\nHow do we find that compromise?\n\n284\n00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.610\nWell, what we do is we ensure that if\nwe're employing something like a three\n\n285\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:06.090\nstrikes and out rule, that we will\nincorporate that into the SLA so\n\n286\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.660\nthat it's agreed by the customer.\n\n287\n00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.450\nUltimately, you can do whatever you\nwant as long as it's been agreed by your\n\n288\n00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:19.300\ncustomer because this is about making\nITIL right for your organization and\n\n289\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.780\ndelivering value to you.\n\n290\n00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:26.690\nSo, the next slide then\njust simply looks at\n\n291\n00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.330\nthe entire workflow all on one page,\njust to summarize.\n\n292\n00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:38.820\nSo now what we'd like you to do is we'd\nlike you to take everything that we've\n\n293\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:44.060\ncovered in the last few modules\nof incident management, and\n\n294\n00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:49.920\nwe'd like you to go to your exercise\nguide and to look at the case\n\n295\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.590\nstudy that's in your exercise guide and\nthe exercises that have been given to you.\n\n296\n00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:58.400\nAnd that should take between 60 minutes,\nan hour, to an hour and a half.\n\n297\n00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.130\nOkay.\nNow it's not a priority to\n\n298\n00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.780\nuse the case study that you've been given.\n\n299\n00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.550\nYou can use your own organization, but\n\n300\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.700\nit is imperative that you understand\nthe concepts within incident management.\n\n301\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:15.450\nAnd so our forum is always available if\nyou do have any questions following this.\n\n302\n00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:20.070\nAll right Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us to understand the idea here\n\n303\n00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.530\nof incident management and\nusing the idea of a process flow.\n\n304\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:28.800\nThere are a lot of times that I remember,\nespecially being relatively new in IT,\n\n305\n00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.890\nit was more of just a scatter gun\napproach in which, it's like,\n\n306\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.280\nall right, somebody fix it,\nthat was all that we had to do.\n\n307\n00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.810\nBut this is much more efficient,\n\n308\n00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.720\nit gives us a bit of a process\nthat we can go through and\n\n309\n00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.110\nit gives us solutions along the way as we\nwork through that process flow as well.\n\n310\n00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.270\nSo it is something that we want to take\nthe time to make sure that we learn.\n\n311\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.280\nMake sure you take advantage of\nthose course materials for us too.\n\n312\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.960\nNow that's a great place for us to end for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n313\n00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.270\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n314\n00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.674\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation

00:00:12.001\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.265\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:19.790\nyou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.290\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and\n\n7\n00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.160\ntoday, we're jumping into\ninstant management metrics.\n\n8\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.700\nAnd here to help us is gonna be of course,\nour IT giant herself, Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.460\nJo, welcome back to the studios,\nhow are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.660\n&gt;&gt; Hi, I am fine thank you, fine.\n\n11\n00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.178\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great,\n\n12\n00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:39.747\nas we are now taking a look\nat the idea of metrics.\n\n13\n00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:44.101\nNow, Joe I've been in the IT business for\na long time now.\n\n14\n00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.964\nI don't think I've ever really followed\nany particular metrics as far as instant\n\n15\n00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:50.440\nmanagement goes.\n\n16\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.020\nSo what are really taking a look at here.\n\n17\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.662\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean the first thing that\nI want to mention about metrics, and\n\n18\n00:00:55.662 --> 00:00:59.305\nwhen you mention you've been in IT for\nquite a number of years now-\n\n19\n00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:00.065\n&gt;&gt; I've just said a while,\n\n20\n00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:00.970\nI didn't say years.\n\n21\n00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.636\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay then.\n\n22\n00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:02.785\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I mean-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n23\n00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:03.549\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n24\n00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.984\n&gt;&gt; All right, [LAUGH] hey now look,\ncome on, you called me a giant earlier,\n\n25\n00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:08.537\n[LAUGH].\n\n26\n00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:12.367\nSo when we look at metrics,\nwhen we wanna talk about metrics,\n\n27\n00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:15.627\nthe first thing that pops to my mind,\nand I don't know about yours.\n\n28\n00:01:15.627 --> 00:01:19.237\nBut I have seen so\nmany reports that are just so\n\n29\n00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:23.042\nsimply reports for\nthe sake of having reports.\n\n30\n00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:27.622\nPretty pictures just because we\nneed to have pretty pictures, and\n\n31\n00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:31.850\nI wonder how many of those\nreports are actually looked at.\n\n32\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.683\nI wonder how many of those metrics that\nare taken that are actually needed.\n\n33\n00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:38.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n34\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.650\n&gt;&gt; And here in the IT world,\nwe have what we call knowledge management.\n\n35\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.850\nA knowledge management really\nlooks at the principle\n\n36\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.520\nof having reports only where relevant.\n\n37\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.850\nIn other words, we call it wisdom.\n\n38\n00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.130\nBelieve it or not sorry,\nwe have wisdom in IT.\n\n39\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.060\nIt's the premise that,\nyou see on its own individual\n\n40\n00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.030\ndata sources have very,\nvery limited meaning.\n\n41\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.280\nAnd what we do is we add in\nrelationships to those data sources and\n\n42\n00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.020\nthat gives us information.\n\n43\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.330\nWhich we then analyze to\ngive us knowledge and\n\n44\n00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.360\nwe present of a nice pretty picture\nlike the graphs that you see.\n\n45\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.980\nAnd that allows us to make an informed\ndecision, therefore, giving us wisdom.\n\n46\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.550\nSo, let's turn that on its head\ncuz I started off with data.\n\n47\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.360\nWhat that means is that every\nsingle pretty picture that we see,\n\n48\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.520\nevery single report that we see.\n\n49\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.282\nWhether it's from service level management\nand it's what we call a SLAM chart\n\n50\n00:02:42.282 --> 00:02:45.142\na service level agreement\nmanagement chart or a RAG chart.\n\n51\n00:02:45.142 --> 00:02:49.978\nOr whether it's actually a graph,\nevery single report should\n\n52\n00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:55.500\nallow us to make an informed decision,\nit should give us wisdom.\n\n53\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.780\nSo by that token,\nyou could look at the reports and\n\n54\n00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.370\nsay, can I make a decision\nfrom this report?\n\n55\n00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.568\nIf I can't make a decision from that\nreport, then why have I got this report?\n\n56\n00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:09.480\nWhy am I looking at this report?\n\n57\n00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.610\nHow many reports are produced\nwithin IT just for\n\n58\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.520\nthe sake of having that\nnice pretty picture.\n\n59\n00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.210\nIt's not efficient, and\nit's certainly not effective and\n\n60\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.930\nnobody has the time to\nwade through 500 reports.\n\n61\n00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.150\nNow, I know that we've got reporting\ntools, nowadays, that are very,\n\n62\n00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.950\nvery smart and that will only show\nyou the reports that you want to see.\n\n63\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.330\nBut nevertheless, if you're not going\nto make a decision on that report.\n\n64\n00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.390\nIf you do not need that report and\nit's not efficient for\n\n65\n00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.580\nus to produce that report.\n\n66\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.340\nSo in terms of incident management,\nto get back to your question.\n\n67\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.330\nIn terms of the incident management, well,\n\n68\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.150\nwe want reports that show us whether\nincident management is being effective.\n\n69\n00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.720\nIn other words,\n\n70\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.830\ndoes it meet those targets that are in\nthose service-level agreements?\n\n71\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.200\nOr is incident management being efficient?\n\n72\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.192\nAnd ideally we want to see reports that\nwill show us whether incident management\n\n73\n00:04:05.192 --> 00:04:06.987\nis efficient or effective.\n\n74\n00:04:06.987 --> 00:04:10.624\nAnd allow us to make decisions as\nto improve in the efficiency or\n\n75\n00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:14.469\nthe effectiveness of the incident\nmanagement process in relation\n\n76\n00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.480\nto our services.\n\n77\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.830\nAlso those reports can be extended and\nbroken down.\n\n78\n00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.950\nAnd allows us to look at how we are\nmanaging each individual service as well.\n\n79\n00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n80\n00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.700\nJo when we start talking about this, I\ndon't know why it just popped in my head.\n\n81\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.680\nSometimes we can be very efficient\nwithout, not very efficient.\n\n82\n00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.395\nSometimes we can be very effective,\nexcuse me.\n\n83\n00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:39.280\nBut without really being very\nefficient at things, and\n\n84\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.890\nso the goal of these reports when we\nstart taking a look at them then.\n\n85\n00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.580\nIs to produce something so\n\n86\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.035\nthat hopefully in the end result,\nwe're actually doing both.\n\n87\n00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:50.881\nIs that what the overall\ngoal is going to be?\n\n88\n00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:55.003\n&gt;&gt; Well, you say we can be effective\nwithout being efficient, yes, we can.\n\n89\n00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.755\nWe can also be efficient without\nbeing particularly effective.\n\n90\n00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:59.033\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n91\n00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:03.176\nwe just get to that sort of\nineffectiveness quicker, that's all.\n\n92\n00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:07.108\nAnd so\nthe aim is that with every single process.\n\n93\n00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:11.072\nThe two tenants of IT are about\nefficiency and effectiveness,\n\n94\n00:05:11.072 --> 00:05:13.255\nit's about doing a very good job.\n\n95\n00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:16.916\nAnd doing it in an efficient way and\nefficiency means minimal waste.\n\n96\n00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:17.461\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n97\n00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.264\n&gt;&gt; Minimal waste in terms of time,\nminimal waste in terms of money,\n\n98\n00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:23.530\nminimal waste in terms of skills.\n\n99\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.820\nHaving the right person to do the right\nrole, what it's like yourself.\n\n100\n00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.190\nYou call the service desk and\n\n101\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.800\nif you have somebody who doesn't have\nnecessarily the right amount of skills\n\n102\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.580\nto be able to restore your service,\nthey're going to be inefficient.\n\n103\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.900\nNow if you've got somebody\nwho is under-skilled,\n\n104\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.920\nthen they're going to have to find\nout how to restore your service.\n\n105\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.390\nThat's not particularly efficient.\n\n106\n00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n107\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.320\n&gt;&gt; It also doesn't deliver value\ncuz remember, value is perceived.\n\n108\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.970\nNow imagine the morale of that person,\nat the other side of that telephone.\n\n109\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.407\nWho's probably not feeling great,\nbecause they can't help you.\n\n110\n00:06:03.407 --> 00:06:05.927\nAnd because we talked\nin a previous session,\n\n111\n00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:10.270\nabout interactions with the service desk,\nbeing negative sometimes.\n\n112\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.520\nWell, most of the time then just think,\n\n113\n00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.307\nthat person was probably\nnot going to feel great.\n\n114\n00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:18.870\nAnd you're not going to feel as\nthough you got a good service.\n\n115\n00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.220\nSo it's not efficient, and\nit's definitely not effective for\n\n116\n00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.690\nthat person to have\nthe wrong level of skills.\n\n117\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.835\nAnd the same is also conversely said for\nthose people that have too many skills.\n\n118\n00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:36.045\nThere is an assumption there, that the\nperson with too many skills is going to be\n\n119\n00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:38.590\nactually very, very efficient at the job.\n\n120\n00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:40.700\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n121\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.648\n&gt;&gt; What about boredom?\n\n122\n00:06:41.648 --> 00:06:43.187\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n123\n00:06:43.187 --> 00:06:46.711\n&gt;&gt; We all get bored from time to time,\nlet's face it, we do and\n\n124\n00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:49.820\ndoes that make us an efficient person?\n\n125\n00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.411\nHow do you feel from a moral perspective\nif you're in a role where you think that\n\n126\n00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:56.370\nyou can do something different.\n\n127\n00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.270\nWhere you think that your\nskills do not match that role.\n\n128\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.218\nYou might be able to perform\nthat role very, very well but\n\n129\n00:07:04.218 --> 00:07:09.747\nyour attention span tends to be a lot less\nbecause you can be doing other things.\n\n130\n00:07:09.747 --> 00:07:13.267\nAnd so there's a tendency there\nto maybe try and multi-task, or\n\n131\n00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:16.590\nthere's a tendency to be\ndistracted very easily.\n\n132\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.200\nNow again,\n\n133\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.360\nas a person calling into the service\ndesk to get somebody who's over-skilled.\n\n134\n00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.665\nYou might have somebody that speaks\na different language because they're\n\n135\n00:07:24.665 --> 00:07:27.290\ncommunicating in a technical language.\n\n136\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.610\nAnd again,\nas a user the user might not feel valued.\n\n137\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:38.710\nSo it's very, very important that we get\nefficiency and effectiveness, right.\n\n138\n00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:45.020\nIt's very important that we deliver both\nto deliver value to the organization.\n\n139\n00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.846\nSo when we talk about metrics within\nincident management we have to\n\n140\n00:07:49.846 --> 00:07:53.214\nmeasure both effectiveness and efficiency.\n\n141\n00:07:53.214 --> 00:07:58.101\nSo we have in our first slide,\nwe've got an example.\n\n142\n00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:02.661\nOf what we call we call our CSFs,\nour Critical Success Factors, and\n\n143\n00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:05.710\nour KPIs, our Key Performance Indicators.\n\n144\n00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.658\nNow, Ronnie, do you understand\nthe difference between a CSF and a KPI?\n\n145\n00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:12.472\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say no at this point.\n\n146\n00:08:12.472 --> 00:08:15.942\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that's what most people feel.\n\n147\n00:08:15.942 --> 00:08:21.633\nIn all fairness, we have a situation\nwhere we have a lot of acronyms in IT.\n\n148\n00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:23.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Let's face it, and so\n\n149\n00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:29.970\na lot of acronyms are either used\ninterchangeably such as CSF or KPI.\n\n150\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.900\nOr, they may be misused, or\n\n151\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:38.000\norganizations will bring in their own\ninterpretation of different acronyms.\n\n152\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.330\nSo let's think about CSFs.\n\n153\n00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.960\nAnd a CSF is what we term\na critical success factor.\n\n154\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.915\nIn other words,\n\n155\n00:08:43.915 --> 00:08:50.260\nit's something that will tell us whether\nwe are succeeding in our objectives.\n\n156\n00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:55.190\nNow, when we look at CSI,\nthe last lifecycle phase, the next\n\n157\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:01.080\nlifecycle phase in fact, continual service\nimprovement is very focused on metrics.\n\n158\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.450\nAnd we look at the vision to metrics tree,\n\n159\n00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.560\nwhich ensures that all of our metrics\nare directly linked to our vision.\n\n160\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.690\nSo a critical success factor is linked\nto our vision as an organization and\n\n161\n00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.360\nour vision as an IT service provider.\n\n162\n00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.720\nSo really what we're doing is\nwe're taking that vision, and\n\n163\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.440\nwe are coming up with a number of critical\nsuccess factors for incident management.\n\n164\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.700\nAnd so the examples that we've got there,\nincrease communication about incidents,\n\n165\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.450\nmaintaining the quality of services, or\n\n166\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.370\nresolving incidents as\nquickly as possible.\n\n167\n00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.820\nNow I don't know whether you've noticed,\nbut\n\n168\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.270\nif I look at those CSFs,\nthey seem fairly intangible to me.\n\n169\n00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, hard to measure.\n\n170\n00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very, very difficult to measure.\n\n171\n00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.870\nYou see, they will tell us\nwhether we're delivering value.\n\n172\n00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.010\nIf I can increase my\ncommunication to IT staff and\n\n173\n00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.850\nto the business, then, by default,\nthen surely I'm delivering value.\n\n174\n00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.410\nBut then, how do I measure that?\n\n175\n00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.150\nYes, the organization wants\nto see communication.\n\n176\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.490\nLet's look at the next one.\n\n177\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.400\nI mean, quality.\n\n178\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.420\nWhat does quality mean?\n\n179\n00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.980\nThat's completely perceived.\n\n180\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we know that value is perceived.\n\n181\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:20.420\nSo what we do is we will allocate KPIs,\nkey performance indicators.\n\n182\n00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.875\nAnd those KPI's will be\ndirectly related to the CSFs.\n\n183\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.450\nAnd we want to see a KPI,\non a regular basis,\n\n184\n00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:37.650\nachieve the targets that are set\nin the service level agreement.\n\n185\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:43.490\nAnd if these KPIs are achieved over\na period of time on a regular basis,\n\n186\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.400\nthat will tell us whether we\nare achieving the CSF or not.\n\n187\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.740\nLet's take a look at\nthat first example then.\n\n188\n00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:56.530\nOur first example, and bear in mind, these\nare just examples, nothing more than that.\n\n189\n00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.559\nYou will determine your own CSFs and\nKPIs for your organization.\n\n190\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.170\nThat first CSF talks about\nincreasing communication.\n\n191\n00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.140\nOkay, so what will help us measure that?\n\n192\n00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:13.450\nWell, you'll see two examples here of\nKPIs that talk about business complaints,\n\n193\n00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.440\nuser complaints about communication.\n\n194\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.000\nA number of calls to report\na previously detected incident.\n\n195\n00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.970\nIn other words, if we achieve these KPIs\nthen therefore we have achieved our CSF.\n\n196\n00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.580\nThat's the way to look at it, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.790\nSo you'll see the next one talks\nabout maintaining quality of service.\n\n198\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.520\nSo we want to look at the total number of\nincidents, which are the interruptions\n\n199\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.160\nto service, or we want to look at\nthe size of the incident backlog.\n\n200\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.430\nIn other words,\nhow many incidents we've got outstanding.\n\n201\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.970\nBut also when we talk about quality,\n\n202\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.630\nwe might want to have another KPI\nin there that talks about, say,\n\n203\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.310\ncustomer satisfaction, for instance,\nbecause that determines quality too.\n\n204\n00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.702\nWe might want to break\nthat down by service,\n\n205\n00:12:00.702 --> 00:12:04.154\nor we might want to break that\ndown by day of the month.\n\n206\n00:12:04.154 --> 00:12:09.169\nHowever we want to do it,\nthat's entirely up to the organization.\n\n207\n00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.620\nThere is no recommended\nmaximum number of KPIs.\n\n208\n00:12:17.118 --> 00:12:20.753\nHowever, we will tell you that you need\nat least two to three KPIs to tell you\n\n209\n00:12:20.753 --> 00:12:22.440\nwhether you're achieving a CSF.\n\n210\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.780\nAnything less than that, and it's not\ngoing to give you that well-rounded\n\n211\n00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.490\nanswer as to whether that CSF\nis being achieved or not.\n\n212\n00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.505\nSo think of it like this, you see yourself\nwith something that you got to achieve and\n\n213\n00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:40.920\nyour CSF is fairly intangible.\n\n214\n00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.983\nSo your KPIs are the tangible\nelements that tell you whether\n\n215\n00:12:44.983 --> 00:12:46.696\nyou achieving that CSF.\n\n216\n00:12:46.696 --> 00:12:51.223\nNow, if you look at the last examples\nwhich is resolving incidents as\n\n217\n00:12:51.223 --> 00:12:56.550\nquickly as possible, look at\nthe number of KPIs that you've got.\n\n218\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.812\nThat's what I would tell you would be\na good healthy number of KPIs that\n\n219\n00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:04.426\nwill help you to determine whether\nyou can check that box and\n\n220\n00:13:04.426 --> 00:13:07.405\nwhether you can say you're\nachieving that CSF.\n\n221\n00:13:07.405 --> 00:13:12.596\nNow just to sort of add little bit\nof weight to the CSF achievement\n\n222\n00:13:12.596 --> 00:13:17.610\nis not something that you just achieve and\nthen, that's it.\n\n223\n00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:18.530\nI've done that now.\n\n224\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.440\nI can move on to something else.\n\n225\n00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.370\nWe've got to achieve this\nover a period of time.\n\n226\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.320\nAnd we've got to continue\nto achieve those KPIs, too.\n\n227\n00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.910\nYou don't just increase communication\nas a one-off, and then,\n\n228\n00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.030\nthat's it, that's done, yeah?\n\n229\n00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.530\nCommunication has to be apparent\nthroughout all incidents.\n\n230\n00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.860\nSo therefore, it's got to be something\nthat we do over a period of time.\n\n231\n00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:46.130\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Jo, going back kind of\nto the beginning of what we were talking\n\n232\n00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:51.240\nabout, about the number of reports that\nwe get that really are just reports for\n\n233\n00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.010\nthe sake of reports\n&gt;&gt; How does that factor into a KPI,\n\n234\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:59.260\nif I'm getting more of these reports,\nand then you start looking at them, and\n\n235\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.250\nyou start realizing,\nthe majority of them are really that.\n\n236\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.960\nThey're just reporting for\nthe sake of reporting.\n\n237\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.632\nDoes that go into the factoring of\nthat critical success factor, too?\n\n238\n00:14:10.632 --> 00:14:13.280\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, most definitely.\n\n239\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.070\nAll reports should be, we call it\nauditing, but that sounds a bit formal.\n\n240\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.870\nBut all reports should be\naudited at least once a year for\n\n241\n00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.990\nelements, and at least once a year\nseems like a long time to me.\n\n242\n00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:33.570\nI would recommend, depending on\nthe circumstances, in a highly-evolving\n\n243\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.350\norganization, you want to be doing\nthat at least once every six months.\n\n244\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.450\nBut remember in a previous session we\ntalked about balance and we talked about\n\n245\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:46.060\nresponsiveness and instability as well and\nwe had to get that balance right.\n\n246\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.410\nIt's the same with our reporting.\n\n247\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:53.334\nWhen we first start producing KPIs,\nwhatever that KPI may be, it's going to\n\n248\n00:14:53.334 --> 00:14:58.182\ntake at least two to three months before\npeople get used to seeing that KPI and\n\n249\n00:14:58.182 --> 00:15:02.165\nthat particular report and\nbefore they start to take notice.\n\n250\n00:15:02.165 --> 00:15:06.165\nIf you then reevaluate your reports after\nevery three months, you're never going\n\n251\n00:15:06.165 --> 00:15:10.010\nto see any value in it, because\nthey're always going to be changing.\n\n252\n00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.330\nSo whilst we don't want to keep\nthem there forever and a day.\n\n253\n00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.510\nNevertheless we still want to\nensure that they are bedded in and\n\n254\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.610\nthat they do allow informed\ndecisions as well.\n\n255\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.420\nSo we have to get that balance right,\nso when we say\n\n256\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.500\norder your reports at last once a year\nthat is actually not too bad a time frame.\n\n257\n00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:36.210\nThis is where knowledge management from\na service transition lifecycle phase\n\n258\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.550\nwill help us to do that.\n\n259\n00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:44.505\nIt will help us to set a time frame for\nevaluating those reports.\n\n260\n00:15:44.505 --> 00:15:49.172\nThe other lifecycle phase that will\nhelp us enormously in evaluating\n\n261\n00:15:49.172 --> 00:15:52.233\nreports is Continual Service Improvement.\n\n262\n00:15:52.233 --> 00:15:57.680\nContinual Service Improvement is\nthe lifecycle phase that follows\n\n263\n00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.423\nservice operation where we look at\nour alignment to the organization.\n\n264\n00:16:03.423 --> 00:16:07.798\nAnd as you can see here,\nCSI gathers all of our data,\n\n265\n00:16:07.798 --> 00:16:14.267\ngathers all of the information from\nthose KPIs and from those reporting, and\n\n266\n00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:21.462\nwill ascertain whether we are continually\naligned to the needs of the organization.\n\n267\n00:16:21.462 --> 00:16:27.002\nSo CSI's gonna help us in those audits,\nCSI is going to evaluate those reports and\n\n268\n00:16:27.002 --> 00:16:32.975\nis going to look at the benefit in\nthe value that we get from those reports.\n\n269\n00:16:32.975 --> 00:16:37.375\nIt tells you then that CSI is interested\nin prevention and Proactivity, and\n\n270\n00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:43.210\nin previous sessions we've talked\nabout Proactivity versus reactivity,\n\n271\n00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.520\nand how there is a negative\nconnotation with reactivity.\n\n272\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.000\nWell CSI is concerned with\n\n273\n00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.950\nensuring that we're aligned to the needs\nof the organization, before they ask us.\n\n274\n00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:59.060\nSo we're constantly evaluating our\nperformance against what the organization\n\n275\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.960\nrequires from us.\n\n276\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.939\nCSI is also interested in efficiency too.\n\n277\n00:17:03.939 --> 00:17:05.896\nIt's interested in speed.\n\n278\n00:17:05.896 --> 00:17:11.658\nCSI is interested in delivering value\nto the business in an efficient way,\n\n279\n00:17:11.658 --> 00:17:16.321\nwith minimal wastage in terms of time and\nin terms of money and\n\n280\n00:17:16.321 --> 00:17:19.260\nskills, but still being effective.\n\n281\n00:17:20.753 --> 00:17:25.210\nSo CSI is going to analyze\nthose incident reports.\n\n282\n00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:30.090\nAnd CSI is going to tell us, because\nthey're the experts in efficiency and\n\n283\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:30.770\neffectiveness.\n\n284\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:31.980\nAnd they're going to tell us,\n\n285\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.630\nwhether incident management is actually\ndoing what it's supposed to do.\n\n286\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.426\nSeeing whether incident management is\nfulfilling its objectives and its purpose.\n\n287\n00:17:43.489 --> 00:17:48.096\nSo the challenges that we have\nthen to incident management.\n\n288\n00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:50.906\nAnd again, our reporting and\n\n289\n00:17:50.906 --> 00:17:56.650\nour CSS will help us to determine\nwhat those challenges are.\n\n290\n00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:00.210\nAnd later after implementation,\nwhat those risks are.\n\n291\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.300\nAnd the challenges to incident management.\n\n292\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.540\nI would say the number one\nchallenge to incident management,\n\n293\n00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.280\nis that second bullet point down.\n\n294\n00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.490\nAnd that's the fact that, and I know I've\nalluded to this in a previous session.\n\n295\n00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.210\nIt's the fact that not\nall incidents are logged.\n\n296\n00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.906\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we're never gonna get an accurate\n\n297\n00:18:18.906 --> 00:18:22.542\npicture of what is happening\nin our live environment,\n\n298\n00:18:22.542 --> 00:18:24.686\nif we don't log all incidents.\n\n299\n00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:28.821\nSo the fact that your friend sends you a\ntext and asks you to look into something,\n\n300\n00:18:28.821 --> 00:18:32.030\nand you're in the middle of\nsomething else but that's okay,\n\n301\n00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.880\nbecause you think that you can get\nonto that and do it within 10 minutes.\n\n302\n00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.112\nThat's great as long as it's logged.\n\n303\n00:18:40.112 --> 00:18:43.249\nShould we like everybody's\ncome through the service desk.\n\n304\n00:18:43.249 --> 00:18:47.641\nYeah, and that would be best practice,\nbut you know what?\n\n305\n00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:51.093\nWe're realists too and we understand\nthat the text messages still happen, and\n\n306\n00:18:51.093 --> 00:18:53.130\nall we would say is make sure it's logged.\n\n307\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.905\nWe need an accurate picture as to what\nis happening on our infrastructure.\n\n308\n00:18:57.995 --> 00:19:01.895\nWithout that accuracy, we're not able\nto deliver value to the business.\n\n309\n00:19:01.895 --> 00:19:03.245\nBecause we're not efficient and\n\n310\n00:19:03.245 --> 00:19:08.615\nwe're not effective, if we don't know\nwhat is happening on our environment.\n\n311\n00:19:08.615 --> 00:19:11.149\nSo we have to log all of our incidents.\n\n312\n00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:17.403\nWe have to ensure that we have\nintegration between all of our processes,\n\n313\n00:19:17.403 --> 00:19:22.543\nand with our configuration\nmanagement system [INAUDIBLE].\n\n314\n00:19:22.543 --> 00:19:26.130\nOur configuration management\nsystem is a system made up of\n\n315\n00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.253\ndatabases [INAUDIBLE] databases,\n\n316\n00:19:28.253 --> 00:19:33.370\nthat contain all of the information\nabout the components of our services.\n\n317\n00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:39.240\nNamely our CIs,\nour configuration management details,\n\n318\n00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.020\nall are kept on our configuration\nmanagement system, and\n\n319\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.330\nour configuration items\nare logged within this system.\n\n320\n00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.790\nWell, the purpose of configuration\nmanagement is to provide accurate and\n\n321\n00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.976\nreliable information,\nabout all of our services and\n\n322\n00:19:53.976 --> 00:19:56.116\nthe components of those services.\n\n323\n00:19:57.741 --> 00:20:02.837\nThe first place where we\noften find these inaccuracies\n\n324\n00:20:02.837 --> 00:20:07.388\nhighlighted, is when we\ncall the service desk.\n\n325\n00:20:09.325 --> 00:20:14.205\nThe user calls the service desk and\nthey'll say, hi, my name is Jo and\n\n326\n00:20:14.205 --> 00:20:16.270\nI can't get into email.\n\n327\n00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.200\nAnd the service desk analyst,\nwhat do you think is the first thing that\n\n328\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.020\na service desk analyst\nwould ask in that instance?\n\n329\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:29.080\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that they would ask,\nwhat have they tried to do or\n\n330\n00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:29.790\nsomething like that.\n\n331\n00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.018\nI'm not exactly sure what they would\nask in that particular instance.\n\n332\n00:20:33.018 --> 00:20:35.475\n&gt;&gt; You don't think they'd\nask who they were?\n\n333\n00:20:35.475 --> 00:20:37.070\n&gt;&gt; Who they were, probably not.\n\n334\n00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.400\nI'd doubt it.\n\n335\n00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but no you're right, they should.\n\n336\n00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwere told by the research analysts.\n\n337\n00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.940\nSo the first thing you\nask is what is the name,\n\n338\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.820\nwhat's the user ID of\nthe person who's calling.\n\n339\n00:20:48.918 --> 00:20:51.390\nBecause, and I'll tell you why we do this,\n\n340\n00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.000\nit's because if we input the details\ninto the call logging system,\n\n341\n00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.490\nthen what we have hopefully if we've got\nthat accurate information being pulled\n\n342\n00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:06.760\nfrom the CMDB, then we should have all\nthat information at our finger tips.\n\n343\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.840\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n344\n00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.390\n&gt;&gt; So if you call me on the service desk,\n\n345\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.380\nmy first reaction is to ask you your\nname and ask you for your user ID.\n\n346\n00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.206\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I type in your user ID, and then all of\n\n347\n00:21:17.206 --> 00:21:23.097\na sudden it tells me who you are, where\nyou're located, what machine you're using,\n\n348\n00:21:23.097 --> 00:21:28.044\nwhat PC you have, what portion of\nthe infrastructure you're on, etc.\n\n349\n00:21:28.044 --> 00:21:33.464\nAnd all of that information is pulled out\nof this configuration management system,\n\n350\n00:21:33.464 --> 00:21:35.844\nthat is on the slides in front of you.\n\n351\n00:21:35.844 --> 00:21:41.842\nAnd so, the service desk\nare the first people to determine,\n\n352\n00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:47.846\nwhether the information that's\nin that CMS is inaccurate.\n\n353\n00:21:47.846 --> 00:21:48.678\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n354\n00:21:48.678 --> 00:21:51.972\n&gt;&gt; So that integration is really,\nreally important.\n\n355\n00:21:51.972 --> 00:21:55.370\nNow I don't know if we can take a look\nat that yet, the slide's in front of us.\n\n356\n00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.270\nThat allows us to be\nan effective service desk.\n\n357\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:02.477\nBecause that integration that exist.\n\n358\n00:22:02.477 --> 00:22:06.660\nWell, if the service desk update\nthe information in the configuration\n\n359\n00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:12.760\nmanagement system, then that ensures that\naccurate information is kept in our CMDB.\n\n360\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.820\nSo the next time the change\nmanagement want to raise a change,\n\n361\n00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:23.010\nthey look at a particular I\nknow an asset number let's say,\n\n362\n00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:27.810\nor a CI number and they look at that CI\nand they say, we'd like to change that CI.\n\n363\n00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:34.450\nThey can be assured that the information\ncontained about that CI is accurate.\n\n364\n00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.220\nSo let's say they wanted to swap\nout a router on the third floor.\n\n365\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:43.092\nWell, they simply go into the CMS,\nthey look at that router number and\n\n366\n00:22:43.092 --> 00:22:46.494\nit tells them exactly\nwho's using that router.\n\n367\n00:22:46.494 --> 00:22:50.618\nNow just imagine how happy you'd be\nif you got a notification to say,\n\n368\n00:22:50.618 --> 00:22:53.390\nwe're going to swap out\na router at lunch time.\n\n369\n00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.150\nYou'd know what was happening.\n\n370\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:59.890\nJust imagine how unhappy you'd be if\nyou didn't receive that information,\n\n371\n00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.820\nbecause the last time you\ncalled the service desk,\n\n372\n00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.560\nthe analysts didn't take\nyour exact location.\n\n373\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.250\nDidn't change the information\nin the call login system,\n\n374\n00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:15.550\nit didn't therefore change in\nthe configuration management system.\n\n375\n00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:21.620\nAnd now you're being impacted just because\nof inefficient incident management.\n\n376\n00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, I agree.\n\n377\n00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.820\n&gt;&gt; So that integration there is really,\nreally important and\n\n378\n00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.120\nthat's what makes\nan effective service desk.\n\n379\n00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.520\nBut that's also what allows us to\ntie all of our processes together.\n\n380\n00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.580\nAnd we look at configuration\nmanagement in a lot more detail,\n\n381\n00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.285\nin our service transition modules.\n\n382\n00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.830\nSo, what about the risks?\n\n383\n00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.860\nWhat are going cause us to fail\nwithin incident management?\n\n384\n00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.914\nLook at that incident back log.\n\n385\n00:23:47.914 --> 00:23:52.915\nLook at how many incidents we've\ngot outstanding in our queue.\n\n386\n00:23:52.915 --> 00:23:56.800\nThat's what leads to user dissatisfaction.\n\n387\n00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.000\nNow, if you've already got an incident\nback log, what do you do [LAUGH] about it?\n\n388\n00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.880\nWell, [LAUGH] I know of some organizations\nthat will say, well that's okay, Jo.\n\n389\n00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.320\nWe'll just change the times.\n\n390\n00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.840\nWe'll just change the priorities\nof our incidents.\n\n391\n00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.320\nWell of course that's not\nreally best practice.\n\n392\n00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n393\n00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.740\n&gt;&gt; What we need to do is ensure that we've\ngot the right processes in place and\n\n394\n00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.910\nthat we do have the right\ntargets in place.\n\n395\n00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.890\nAnd maybe we do have to revisit some of\nthose targets, but we have to ensure that\n\n396\n00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.910\nthe targets that we have are relevant and\nthat they're in the service level\n\n397\n00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.830\nagreement, because they're needed and\nbecause they add value to the business.\n\n398\n00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.880\nAnd then we can use our reporting,\nour CMS and\n\n399\n00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.040\nour KPIs,\nto highlight any training issues.\n\n400\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.818\nAnd that could be training issues\nwithin the service desk itself,\n\n401\n00:24:40.818 --> 00:24:44.056\ncould be training issues\nwithin our technical teams, or\n\n402\n00:24:44.056 --> 00:24:47.375\nit could be training issues\nwithin the user environment.\n\n403\n00:24:47.375 --> 00:24:49.902\nRemember, we talked about\nthis very early on in\n\n404\n00:24:49.902 --> 00:24:53.756\nan earlier module about the fact that\nincident management can highlight\n\n405\n00:24:53.756 --> 00:24:57.010\ntraining issues in our\nuser environment too.\n\n406\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:02.310\nSo, if we get the reporting right,\nthen actually, we can highlight any\n\n407\n00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:07.220\nissues there, any risks straight away,\nand that allows us to tackle them.\n\n408\n00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.520\nSo the last slide that I\nreally want to look at in this\n\n409\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.610\nparticular section is\nthe service desk involvement.\n\n410\n00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:18.150\nYou see, I've mentioned\nthe Service Desk quite a lot,\n\n411\n00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.700\nquite extensively throughout all\nour system management modules.\n\n412\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.030\nBecause the Service Desk takes\nownership of incident management.\n\n413\n00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.230\nThis is the only time in ITIL where we\nactually tell you which functional team,\n\n414\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.840\nwhich functional area,\nshould own which process.\n\n415\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.210\nThe only time that we do that and\n\n416\n00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:42.970\nthe Service Desk takes accountability for\nincident management.\n\n417\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:50.129\nAnd so, it's not unusual that he Service\nDesk Manager is also the manager as well.\n\n418\n00:25:50.129 --> 00:25:55.054\nThe Service Desk acts as a single point of\ncontact between IT and the business and\n\n419\n00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:59.096\nwe're gonna come to that in more\ndetail a little bit later on one of\n\n420\n00:25:59.096 --> 00:26:00.365\nthe other modules.\n\n421\n00:26:01.645 --> 00:26:03.265\nBut we call it a SPOC,\n\n422\n00:26:03.265 --> 00:26:07.875\na single point of communication as\nis on that last bullet point there.\n\n423\n00:26:07.875 --> 00:26:11.600\nAnd so the Service Desk\nassumes responsibility for\n\n424\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.970\nall of the incident management process\nflow including all of that communication,\n\n425\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:22.530\nand including managing those incidents\nthroughout their life cycle, okay.\n\n426\n00:26:24.062 --> 00:26:26.780\nSo, now what I'd like everybody to do,\nbecause, again,\n\n427\n00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:31.180\nwe've covered more information here,\ncertainly, to do with metrics.\n\n428\n00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.280\nAnd the concepts and\nthe differentiation between a CSF and\n\n429\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.150\na KPI can be quite a challenging\none to get your head around.\n\n430\n00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:43.910\nSo now is the time for us to review or\nfor you to review your notes and\n\n431\n00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:49.820\ngo back over the CSF and KPI concepts and\nhighlight to us if there\n\n432\n00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:54.760\nare any challenges that you face, and if\nyou have any questions relating to this.\n\n433\n00:26:56.038 --> 00:26:59.515\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo,\nwell thank you again for helping us,\n\n434\n00:26:59.515 --> 00:27:02.528\nif not,\nat least introducing me to the realm,\n\n435\n00:27:02.528 --> 00:27:07.029\nthe idea here of using metrics inside\nof service operations as well.\n\n436\n00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:11.489\nRemember that these concepts are very key\nif we are gonna be part of taking a look\n\n437\n00:27:11.489 --> 00:27:16.156\nat the continual service improvement,\nas well as learning those different terms\n\n438\n00:27:16.156 --> 00:27:20.760\nthat you need reminding of the CSF as\nwell as the KPIs that are out there too.\n\n439\n00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.700\nSo, a lot of acronyms that\nyou have to take a look at.\n\n440\n00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.640\nBut there is time for you to do that.\n\n441\n00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.610\nSo, it is recommended by Jo that you do\ntake the time to make sure that you review\n\n442\n00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.850\nthose concepts before you\nmove forward here as well.\n\n443\n00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.100\nWell that's a great place for\nus to sign off on this episode then.\n\n444\n00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.310\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n445\n00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.903\nI'm Jo Peacock\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here

us is our ITIL\nroyalty herself, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.016\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:32.257\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good morning.\n\n10\n00:00:32.257 --> 00:00:33.238\nHow are you, Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:33.238 --> 00:00:35.530\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, Jo.\n\n12\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.080\nAs we have already taken a look a little\nbit about some of the incident management.\n\n13\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.984\nTake us a little bit back through that and\n\n14\n00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:45.560\nthen tell us where we're\ngonna be heading now.\n\n15\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.626\n&gt;&gt; So in our first few sessions we\nlooked at the objectives of operations,\n\n16\n00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:50.950\nservice operation.\n\n17\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.630\nAnd service operation is all\nabout the business as usual.\n\n18\n00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.830\nIt's all about the life services,\ndelivering value.\n\n19\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.570\nAnd in earlier sessions, we looked at\nthe concept of value being perceived.\n\n20\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.120\nWe also looked at the interaction\nwith other processes,\n\n21\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.350\nsuch as service level management which\nof course was key to service operation.\n\n22\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.249\nWithout service level management, we just\ndon't know how to deliver our services and\n\n23\n00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.082\nwhat parameters to deliver\nour services within.\n\n24\n00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:24.247\nSo service level management then\ngave us a very good grounding for\n\n25\n00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:29.160\nincident management which was\nthe second process actually that\n\n26\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.755\nwe looked at throughout\nour previous sessions.\n\n27\n00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:39.530\nAnd incident management is where we try\nand restore normal service operation.\n\n28\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.230\nNormal service operation as defined\nin that service level agreement.\n\n29\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.480\nAnd we call it an SLA,\n\n30\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.650\na service level agreement, because\nit's been agreed with the customer.\n\n31\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.578\nSo, in incident management\nwe're trying to fix something.\n\n32\n00:01:55.578 --> 00:01:57.864\nNow we did little\nexercise if you remember.\n\n33\n00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:02.260\nIn one of the session we did little\nexercise with a piece of paper and\n\n34\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.894\na roll of tape where we look at\nthe difference between an incident which\n\n35\n00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:11.545\nwas that rip in that piece of paper and\nthe problem which were my hands.\n\n36\n00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:16.120\nAnd the difference between them and the\ndifference between restoring service which\n\n37\n00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.858\nis simply getting the tape and\nsticking the paper back together, and\n\n38\n00:02:19.858 --> 00:02:22.387\nfixing the problem which\nwas rather drastic.\n\n39\n00:02:22.387 --> 00:02:25.665\nI just wanna say Ronnie,\nyou wanted to tie my hands behind my back.\n\n40\n00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:26.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was wrong.\n\n41\n00:02:26.785 --> 00:02:28.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was wrong,\n[LAUGH] that was wrong.\n\n42\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.966\n[LAUGH] So, now what we're going to do,\n\n43\n00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:34.087\nwe spent some time in looking\nat incident management.\n\n44\n00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:41.430\nAnd exactly how we get the tape and that\npiece of paper and we restore service.\n\n45\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.320\nAnd we have to do it within a certain time\nframe, so that tape had better be handy.\n\n46\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.880\nBut that tape was a workaround and\n\n47\n00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.680\nthose workarounds are defined\nby problem management.\n\n48\n00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.100\nProblem management will tell\nus what type of tape to use,\n\n49\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.730\nthat will tell us what tape works best.\n\n50\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.840\nBut problem management also will look at,\nas I've already said,\n\n51\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.580\nyou know the extreme [LAUGH]\nthe tying my hands behind my back.\n\n52\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.280\nAnd problem management's objective\nis simply to prevent incidents,\n\n53\n00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.333\nto prevent problems, and\nto look at the root cause of incidents.\n\n54\n00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:24.340\nSo, problem management's role is to\nfind out exactly why something happened.\n\n55\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.220\nIncident management, we didn't care.\n\n56\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.250\nAll we knew was that something had\nhappened, something had broken, and\n\n57\n00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.000\nwe wanted to fix it.\n\n58\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.530\nOr a reduction in the quality\nof the service, as we say.\n\n59\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.040\nSo something wasn't working\nquite as it should be,\n\n60\n00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.690\nquite as it was defined in\nthe service level agreement.\n\n61\n00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.200\nAnd so, incident management just\nwanted to get it back up again.\n\n62\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.860\nDidn't care whether it broke anymore,\njust wanted to get it back up and running,\n\n63\n00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.170\nwhereas problem management does care.\n\n64\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.201\nProblem management, yes problem\nmanagement does have an interest\n\n65\n00:03:57.201 --> 00:04:03.480\nin getting the service back up and running\nand restoring normal service operation.\n\n66\n00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.438\nBut problem management is more\ninterested in trying to prevent it from\n\n67\n00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:12.903\nhappening in the first place,\nso finding out what went wrong.\n\n68\n00:04:12.903 --> 00:04:17.145\nAnd you'll see that within the first\nbullet point in Scope over on the right\n\n69\n00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:19.364\nhand side of that slide in front of you,\n\n70\n00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:22.280\nthat we're split into two\nin problem management.\n\n71\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.590\nWe're split into proactive and reactive.\n\n72\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.800\nWe looked at balances yesterday,\nif you remember.\n\n73\n00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.509\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n74\n00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.009\n&gt;&gt; And one of the balances we looked at\nwas the balance between proactive and\n\n75\n00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.810\nreactive, because we don't\nwant to be just reactive.\n\n76\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.290\nThere's a negative connotation\nin being reactive.\n\n77\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.960\nWe want to be proactive as well so,\nlet's look at that box.\n\n78\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.302\nThe blue box at the bottom of the screen\ntalks about minimizing the adverse\n\n79\n00:04:50.302 --> 00:04:55.232\nimpact of incidents and\nproblems by understanding the root cause,\n\n80\n00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:58.940\nand initiating actions to improve or\ncorrect the situation.\n\n81\n00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.080\nSo problem management's aim is to\nstop something from happening.\n\n82\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.610\nThat's what problem management\nis trying to do is to prevent\n\n83\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.030\nfurther interruptions to service.\n\n84\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.465\nAnd the second bullet point in\nthe objectives talks about eliminating\n\n85\n00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:14.338\nrecurring incidents.\n\n86\n00:05:14.338 --> 00:05:18.450\nSo whilst incident\nmanagement gets the tapes,\n\n87\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.950\nthat's what incident management does,\nproblem management goes and gets the rope.\n\n88\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.380\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n89\n00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.310\n&gt;&gt; So problem management is trying to\nprevent me from ripping paper again.\n\n90\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.330\nProblem management, though,\nis a little bit cleverer than that.\n\n91\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.525\nAnd this is why we talk\nabout proactive and\n\n92\n00:05:36.525 --> 00:05:39.912\nreactive cuz problem management\nmight have already identified.\n\n93\n00:05:39.912 --> 00:05:44.960\nYou see, if you were a problem manager,\nI would be expecting you to identify that\n\n94\n00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.562\nI have a liking for tearing up paper.\n\n95\n00:05:48.562 --> 00:05:53.600\nYou've seen me before,\nyou've seen me playing with paper and\n\n96\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.900\nyou might think to yourself,\nJo likes tearing up paper.\n\n97\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.925\nIn which case I would expect\nyou to do one of two things.\n\n98\n00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:03.449\nI'd expect you to take the paper away.\n\n99\n00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:04.042\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n100\n00:06:04.042 --> 00:06:07.696\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe to tie my hands\nbehind my back, yeah, and\n\n101\n00:06:07.696 --> 00:06:11.160\njust tell me that I can't do this anymore.\n\n102\n00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.022\nRight, I'm not allowed to tear up paper,\n\n103\n00:06:13.022 --> 00:06:15.310\nwe've got to prevent\nthe incident from happening.\n\n104\n00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.250\nSo that's what problem management does.\n\n105\n00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:25.543\nProblem management comes along,\neither before incidents have happened,\n\n106\n00:06:25.543 --> 00:06:31.582\nso we identify potential root causes or we\ncome along after an incident has happened.\n\n107\n00:06:31.582 --> 00:06:36.259\nAnd it may be that incident management\nhave asked us to get involved and\n\n108\n00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.063\nthey've said to us look,\nwe had this weird thing happen and\n\n109\n00:06:40.063 --> 00:06:44.864\nwe don't really know what it was that\ncaused it, and do you know what?\n\n110\n00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:49.611\nWe fixed it, we got it up and\nrunning again by rebooting, but\n\n111\n00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:52.130\nwe wanna find out what went wrong,\nso can you help?\n\n112\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.829\nLet me give you an example,\nlet me just say that your\n\n113\n00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:03.795\nlaptop locked up right now,\nwhat would you do?\n\n114\n00:07:03.795 --> 00:07:05.779\n&gt;&gt; If it locked up right\nnow what would I do?\n\n115\n00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:10.520\nI would probably just try and\ndetermine at least on my laptop.\n\n116\n00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.958\nI would just to close the lid and\ntry to open the backup,\n\n117\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.980\nsee if I got a different result.\n\n118\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.884\nOr probably just press a few keys to do\nthat, but ultimately if it locked up,\n\n119\n00:07:18.884 --> 00:07:20.290\nI would try and restart it.\n\n120\n00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.620\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you'd turn it off and\nturn it back on again.\n\n121\n00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.147\nIt's always our first go to, isn't it?\n\n122\n00:07:24.147 --> 00:07:28.260\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, do you care why it went wrong?\n\n123\n00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.730\n&gt;&gt; Not at that point, if I'm busy,\n\n124\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.700\nI would rather it'd be up then really\ncare about solving the root problem.\n\n125\n00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what we're doing then\nis we're fixing the incident.\n\n126\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n127\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.160\nwe quite often do that\nas our first protocol,\n\n128\n00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.740\nespecially with something\nsimple like a laptop.\n\n129\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.901\nLocks up, then your first reaction is,\nwell, I'm just going to reboot it.\n\n130\n00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:51.553\nAnd that's what we call a workaround, and\n\n131\n00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:54.801\nthat's just restoring\nnormal service operation.\n\n132\n00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:58.472\nNow I asked the question,\nwhether you cared?\n\n133\n00:07:58.472 --> 00:08:00.832\nDo you really care why it locked up?\n\n134\n00:08:00.832 --> 00:08:02.330\nAnd you said, no,\nnot really at the moment.\n\n135\n00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.700\nAnd the truth of the matter is,\nthe first time it happens, you don't.\n\n136\n00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.680\nYou just think, it's one of those things,\nokay, this is IT.\n\n137\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.960\nThese things happen and\nsometimes we can't find an explanation, so\n\n138\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.349\nwe're just gonna reboot it and\neverything works fine.\n\n139\n00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.240\nIn that instance we haven't bothered\nto try and find out what went wrong, so\n\n140\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.740\nwe haven't identified the root cause.\n\n141\n00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.435\nSo what we haven't done is\ninvestigated the problem.\n\n142\n00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of the key points to\n\n143\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.962\nproblem management, is that we don't\nalways want to investigate the problem.\n\n144\n00:08:33.962 --> 00:08:38.345\nSometimes we're just happy with\nthe restoration of service,\n\n145\n00:08:38.345 --> 00:08:40.480\nwe're just happy with the work around.\n\n146\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.430\nSo, we don't always raise what\nwe call a problem record.\n\n147\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.710\nAnd that's another reason why we have to\nhave the differentiation between the two\n\n148\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.594\nand we have to understand what\nit is we're trying to achieve.\n\n149\n00:08:51.594 --> 00:08:55.760\nSo, here we are, we've got a locked\nup laptop, we've just rebooted it.\n\n150\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.400\nBut then it happens again\nten minutes later, and\n\n151\n00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.060\nyou'll probably reboot it again.\n\n152\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.130\nBut after the third or\n\n153\n00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.995\nfourth time, you're going to want\nto find out what's causing it.\n\n154\n00:09:08.995 --> 00:09:11.778\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n&gt;&gt; And it's at that point in time when\n\n155\n00:09:11.778 --> 00:09:16.216\nwe'd raise the problem record\nto investigate what went wrong.\n\n156\n00:09:16.216 --> 00:09:21.452\nSo raising a problem record is not\nour initial reaction to an incident,\n\n157\n00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:26.428\nour initial reaction to something failing,\nsomething breaking,\n\n158\n00:09:26.428 --> 00:09:29.588\nor a reduction in\nthe quality of a service.\n\n159\n00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:33.338\nWhen your laptop's running slow\nyour initial reaction is to try and\n\n160\n00:09:33.338 --> 00:09:37.030\nimplement a workaround\njust to restore service.\n\n161\n00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.760\nAnd then we choose when we want\nto raise a problem record.\n\n162\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.140\nSo let's go back to that slide again,\nbecause, in the top right-hand corner,\n\n163\n00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.370\nin that first bullet point,\nwe talked about reactive and proactive.\n\n164\n00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.580\nPart of proactive problem management,\nand to be perfectly honest,\n\n165\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.390\nit fits into two, part or\ninto both of them,\n\n166\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.698\npart of proactive problem\nmanagement is trend analysis.\n\n167\n00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:05.770\nNow it mentions a little bit later,\non a later slide, that proactive\n\n168\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.330\nproblem management is tied in with\ncontinual service improvement with CSI.\n\n169\n00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.110\nAnd it is because CSI spends\na lot of time analyzing,\n\n170\n00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.530\nreporting, and analyzing our metrics,\nand seeing where we can improve.\n\n171\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.670\nAnd so it is a CSI activity, but\n\n172\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.860\nnever the less, proactive problem\nmanagement analyzes incidents.\n\n173\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.640\nIt identifies, by incident records,\nwhere something\n\n174\n00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.720\nhas failed repeatedly,\nwhether they have identified a trend,\n\n175\n00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.110\nand it analyses those incidents and says,\nyou know what, this keeps happening.\n\n176\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.580\nI'm gonna try and find out what's\ngoing on, I'm gonna try and\n\n177\n00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.080\nget to the bottom of this or\nget to the root cause of this.\n\n178\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.410\nAnd then I'm going to identify it and\n\n179\n00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:59.970\npotentially resolve the problem to prevent\nthe incidence from happening again.\n\n180\n00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.370\nSo problem management is coming along in\nthe background, and you might not even\n\n181\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:09.900\nknow about this, because not all\nproblems are raised by the users.\n\n182\n00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.080\nProblem management is gonna come\nalong in the background and\n\n183\n00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.600\nis gonna analyze your reports to do\nwith your laptop and say, you know what,\n\n184\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.470\nRonnie's laptop,\nit's rebooted itself a few times now.\n\n185\n00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.380\nAnd so I'm gonna try and\n\n186\n00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.000\nfind out what's going on,\nI'm going to investigate further.\n\n187\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.420\nAnd so we consider that to be part\nof proactive problem management.\n\n188\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.935\nBut it also falls into\nreactive problem management as\n\n189\n00:11:33.935 --> 00:11:38.007\nwell because we're reacting\nto previous incidence.\n\n190\n00:11:38.007 --> 00:11:42.813\nSo problem management, whilst it's\nindependent of incident management,\n\n191\n00:11:42.813 --> 00:11:46.879\nbecause incident management is\njust about restoring service,\n\n192\n00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:50.217\nit's just about rebooting,\nproblem management still has\n\n193\n00:11:50.217 --> 00:11:54.830\nties into incident management because\nwe're looking at what causes incidents.\n\n194\n00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.634\nAnd then I'm gonna jump back to the left\nhand side of your screen there,\n\n195\n00:11:59.634 --> 00:12:02.205\nthe left hand side of the slide\nunder the objectives.\n\n196\n00:12:02.205 --> 00:12:06.603\nAnd the last one talks about\nminimizing the impact of incidents that\n\n197\n00:12:06.603 --> 00:12:07.923\nwe can't prevent.\n\n198\n00:12:07.923 --> 00:12:11.871\nSo again, this is both proactive and\nreactive, and\n\n199\n00:12:11.871 --> 00:12:18.120\nwe can see that you've got an issue\nwith your laptop, it keeps freezing.\n\n200\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.040\nWe can't prevent it from\nfreezing in the future, but\n\n201\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.110\nwe want to show you how to\nreboot it quicker, perhaps.\n\n202\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.720\nNow I mentioned that we don't\nalways want to raise a problem.\n\n203\n00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.480\nThe other thing that I wanna\nsort of put out there,\n\n204\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.470\nis that we don't always want\nto resolve a problem either.\n\n205\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.068\nLet's go back to your laptop again.\n\n206\n00:12:42.068 --> 00:12:42.625\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n207\n00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:43.905\n&gt;&gt; I keep picking on you a lot.\n\n208\n00:12:43.905 --> 00:12:44.630\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n209\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:49.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But let's just say your\nlaptop keeps rebooting itself,\n\n210\n00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:53.241\nand I'm problem management and\nI've come along and\n\n211\n00:12:53.241 --> 00:12:57.502\nI've done some investigation and\nI simply found out that\n\n212\n00:12:57.502 --> 00:13:02.250\nyour laptop is really just, well,\nit's kind of a bit too old.\n\n213\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:09.070\nSo am I going to spend my time\ntrying to fix the root cause?\n\n214\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.140\n&gt;&gt; No, you're probably not gonna\nspend your time trying to fix\n\n215\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.160\nthe root cause of the issue.\n\n216\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.086\nIt may cost too much to actually fix it,\nmore than likely,\n\n217\n00:13:19.086 --> 00:13:21.551\nreplacement is probably\nthe easier thing to do.\n\n218\n00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:25.372\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so\nwe don't always want to resolve a problem?\n\n219\n00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:27.068\n&gt;&gt; Correct, I can see that.\n\n220\n00:13:27.068 --> 00:13:34.010\n&gt;&gt; And that's an important point to make,\nwe don't always want to resolve problems.\n\n221\n00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:38.315\nAnd sometimes, if we've got a service\nthat's out there in the big wide world,\n\n222\n00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:42.617\nin our organization, that's reached\nit's sort of end of life, as we call it,\n\n223\n00:13:42.617 --> 00:13:45.050\nthen it's close to retirement.\n\n224\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.560\nIf it gets a problem, we may actually\nchoose not to resolve the problem,\n\n225\n00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.670\nwe may make a conscious decision that\nwe're not going to resolve the problem,\n\n226\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:59.950\nthat we will live with a workaround until\nthe date of retirement of that service.\n\n227\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:04.610\nSo sometimes, the choice of whether\nto resolve a problem or not, is based\n\n228\n00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:09.130\npurely on finances, or on strategy,\nthe strategy of the organization.\n\n229\n00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:15.102\nBearing in mind that we are delivering\nvalue to our organization, but I wonder,\n\n230\n00:14:15.102 --> 00:14:20.003\nhow many organizations there are out there\nthat have got old servers sitting around\n\n231\n00:14:20.003 --> 00:14:23.383\nin server rooms that are still\nconnected to the network.\n\n232\n00:14:23.383 --> 00:14:27.828\nAnd I've heard it so many times, where\nIT analysts have come to me and said,\n\n233\n00:14:27.828 --> 00:14:32.915\nwe're just waiting for that to die, Jo, as\nsoon as it dies, we're getting rid of it.\n\n234\n00:14:32.915 --> 00:14:33.686\n[LAUGH] Now,\n\n235\n00:14:33.686 --> 00:14:38.864\nwe don't tell you that that should [LAUGH]\nbe part of your strategy at all, okay.\n\n236\n00:14:38.864 --> 00:14:43.605\nBut there needs to be a documented\ndecision as to what would happen in\n\n237\n00:14:43.605 --> 00:14:47.515\nthe instance that there is\na problem with that server and\n\n238\n00:14:47.515 --> 00:14:50.610\nthat it's simply uneconomical to repair.\n\n239\n00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.680\n&gt;&gt; Jo, when I think about this\nas you continue to kind of talk\n\n240\n00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.720\nabout this point here.\n\n241\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.713\nFor a business, though,\nas they start to decide whether or\n\n242\n00:15:01.713 --> 00:15:06.190\nnot they want to deal with the issue and\nthe problem that's on hand.\n\n243\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.932\nThere has to be some level of like\na pain threshold that they go through,\n\n244\n00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:13.869\neven if they go it's\ngonna retire in a year.\n\n245\n00:15:13.869 --> 00:15:18.031\nThey've gotta realize that there's gotta\nbe a point in which even the incidence\n\n246\n00:15:18.031 --> 00:15:22.008\nmanagement itself is now being so\nhigh we're rebooting it every 30 minutes\n\n247\n00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:26.600\nduring the entire work day, we're just\nhaving to reboot it every 30 minutes.\n\n248\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.220\nThen that can't be a way to say,\nhere's our solution, in the end we're not\n\n249\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.300\ngoing to fix it, we're just going\nto wait for the retirement.\n\n250\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.580\n&gt;&gt; You know what, you just played\nstraight into my hands, and\n\n251\n00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.455\nthat's why I've got a huge big\ngrin on my face right now.\n\n252\n00:15:40.455 --> 00:15:45.640\n[LAUGH] Because I can tell you\nnow that I made a point yesterday\n\n253\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.770\nduring incident management about the fact\nthat we have to log all of our incidents.\n\n254\n00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.282\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n255\n00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:55.929\n&gt;&gt; We log all of our incidents because\nwe need to understand the impact of\n\n256\n00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:58.024\nthose particular incidents.\n\n257\n00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:02.223\nAnd you just made that point,\nabout that server, or that service,\n\n258\n00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:04.885\nthat is not due to retire for\nanother year.\n\n259\n00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:07.545\nBut the volume of\nincidents means that we've\n\n260\n00:16:07.545 --> 00:16:10.770\nprobably gonna have to\ndo something about that.\n\n261\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.710\nBut you know what, we don't understand\nthat we've got to do something,\n\n262\n00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.450\nif we don't have the volume\nof incidents recorded.\n\n263\n00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:21.500\nAnd so this is why it's incredibly\nimportant that all of our incidents\n\n264\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.420\nare logged, so that we do get\na true impact of any problem.\n\n265\n00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.036\nAnd believe it or not,\n\n266\n00:16:28.036 --> 00:16:33.573\nit's the volume of incidents that shows\nus what the impact of the problem is.\n\n267\n00:16:33.573 --> 00:16:37.771\nRemember, we looked at impact and\nurgency yesterday, in Incident Management.\n\n268\n00:16:37.771 --> 00:16:41.350\nAnd we look at it a little bit\nfurther in Problem Management, too.\n\n269\n00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:48.890\nBut the impact is the scope of the damage,\nas it were, to the organization.\n\n270\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:54.810\nHow many people does it actually impact,\nhow many incidents have there been?\n\n271\n00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:59.250\nAnd so that service,\nwe will choose whether to\n\n272\n00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:03.780\nfix the problem based on\nthe impact of the incidents.\n\n273\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.380\nSo if the service affects\nthe whole of the organization,\n\n274\n00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.810\nthen we will probably choose to\ndo something about the problem.\n\n275\n00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:15.923\nBut if we've only got record of\none incident affecting one person,\n\n276\n00:17:15.923 --> 00:17:19.530\nthen we're probably going to\nchoose not to fix the problem.\n\n277\n00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.980\nAnd this is why it's really important\nthat all incidents are logged.\n\n278\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.424\nNow I'm gonna go back to the relationship\nthat I mentioned in Incident Management,\n\n279\n00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:32.002\nwith our Configuration Management\ndatabases.\n\n280\n00:17:32.002 --> 00:17:35.907\nAnd I said to you, this Configuration\nManagement system was the foundation for\n\n281\n00:17:35.907 --> 00:17:37.400\nIncident Management,\n\n282\n00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.430\nbecause it gave us all of the information\nabout all of our configuration items.\n\n283\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.360\nAnd we went through the example where I\nasked you, if you called the service desk,\n\n284\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.300\nwhat would the service desk\nanalyst ask for first?\n\n285\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:50.809\n&gt;&gt; By the name.\n\n286\n00:17:50.809 --> 00:17:53.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, your name or your user ID.\n\n287\n00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.470\nAnd from there, they would extract\nall of the information about you, and\n\n288\n00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.070\nabout the laptop that you had.\n\n289\n00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.500\nWell, when they extract all\nof that information, and\n\n290\n00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.070\nit's pulled into the core login system,\ndo you know what?\n\n291\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.777\nIt also pulls the history of that laptop,\nso they can see exactly how many\n\n292\n00:18:09.777 --> 00:18:14.980\nincidents you have, and\nhow many problems, you have or have had.\n\n293\n00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.170\nSo straight away, we now realize that we\n\n294\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:25.072\ncan directly relate incidents\nto problem records.\n\n295\n00:18:25.072 --> 00:18:29.874\nSo when we raise a problem record,\nwe can see immediately the impact.\n\n296\n00:18:29.874 --> 00:18:34.899\nBecause we know how many incidents have\nbeen raised against that asset number,\n\n297\n00:18:34.899 --> 00:18:36.329\nagainst your laptop.\n\n298\n00:18:36.329 --> 00:18:39.490\nAnd the same works for\nevery single service as well.\n\n299\n00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.957\nSo the relationship with\nIncident Management and\n\n300\n00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.410\nProblem Management is very important.\n\n301\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.518\nAnd I know that we did a little session\non the difference between them, but\n\n302\n00:18:50.518 --> 00:18:52.051\nthey are heavily related.\n\n303\n00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:56.013\nSo if we go back, then,\nto that slide that we were looking at.\n\n304\n00:18:56.013 --> 00:19:01.049\nAnd in the bottom left-hand corner, sorry,\nbottom right-hand corner of that slide.\n\n305\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.019\nWe see some of the techniques that we\nwould use within Problem Management,\n\n306\n00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:08.668\nto get to that root cause.\n\n307\n00:19:08.668 --> 00:19:13.600\nSome brainstorming sessions,\nwe use techniques such as Ishikawa,\n\n308\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.925\nwhich is what we might\ncall fishbone diagram.\n\n309\n00:19:16.925 --> 00:19:19.474\nOr the five whys, the five hows.\n\n310\n00:19:19.474 --> 00:19:25.132\nHow we would get to the bottom of\na problem, How we'd get to the root cause.\n\n311\n00:19:25.132 --> 00:19:28.980\nAnd there are so many Problem Management\ntechniques out there,\n\n312\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.698\nthat we would use to\nidentify the root cause.\n\n313\n00:19:34.024 --> 00:19:35.930\nSo why bother with Problem Management?\n\n314\n00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:40.550\nI mean, why don't we just fix\nthe issue that we have at hand?\n\n315\n00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.042\nWhy don't we just get out the tape?\n\n316\n00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:46.142\nWell, how frustrated are you gonna be,\n\n317\n00:19:46.142 --> 00:19:48.852\nthat you have to keep\nrebooting your laptop?\n\n318\n00:19:48.852 --> 00:19:50.617\n&gt;&gt; Well,\ndepending on the frequency, right,\n\n319\n00:19:50.617 --> 00:19:52.203\nit would probably become frustrating.\n\n320\n00:19:52.203 --> 00:19:54.969\nBut after a couple of, or\nthree times that it's happening.\n\n321\n00:19:54.969 --> 00:19:56.842\nThere's gotta be another issue,\n\n322\n00:19:56.842 --> 00:20:00.230\nthan the rebooting is actually\njust fixing anything.\n\n323\n00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.590\nIt is at least managing, but\nit would be frustrating really quickly.\n\n324\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.413\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's why we need Problem Management,\n\n325\n00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:08.100\nthat's exactly why we\nneed Problem Management.\n\n326\n00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.170\nWe talk about increased\nservice productivity,\n\n327\n00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:15.510\nbecause quite simply, if you're rebooting\nyour laptop, then you're not working.\n\n328\n00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.320\nWhich is, of course,\nthe bad staff productivity.\n\n329\n00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.270\nAnd then lower support costs,\n\n330\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.230\nbecause you're not calling\nthe service desk every five minutes.\n\n331\n00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.564\nYou're not reporting it,\n\n332\n00:20:24.564 --> 00:20:28.016\nbecause we're going to fix\nthe problem with the laptop, okay?\n\n333\n00:20:28.016 --> 00:20:33.670\nSo then, what type of policies do we\nneed then, within Problem Management?\n\n334\n00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:38.600\nWell, one of the basic principles of\nProblem Management is that problems and\n\n335\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.110\nincidents really need to be logged\nin the same core logging system.\n\n336\n00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.410\nEven though it says they should be\ntracked separately from incidents,\n\n337\n00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.615\nthey're two completely different entities.\n\n338\n00:20:48.615 --> 00:20:51.787\nBut we should have a single\nmanagement system, for\n\n339\n00:20:51.787 --> 00:20:54.160\nboth our problems and our incidents.\n\n340\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.627\nThat allow us to relate them together, to\neach other, through both the incident and\n\n341\n00:20:59.627 --> 00:21:04.880\nproblem records, and also through the\nasset numbers within the CMBD, as well.\n\n342\n00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.239\nNow, we're going to look at\nthe Problem Management process flow in\n\n343\n00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:11.680\na later session.\n\n344\n00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.390\nBut that bottom bullet point about having\na consistent classification scheme.\n\n345\n00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.950\nWe're going to use the same classification\nscheme that we use in Incident Management,\n\n346\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.880\nwhich will really increase\nthat consistency.\n\n347\n00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.653\nWe need to have that standardization,\nokay.\n\n348\n00:21:26.653 --> 00:21:31.255\nSo I mentioned, earlier on,\nwhen we looked at Incident Management,\n\n349\n00:21:31.255 --> 00:21:33.291\nI mentioned incident models.\n\n350\n00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:38.513\nAbout you taking a look at\na Incident Management process flow,\n\n351\n00:21:38.513 --> 00:21:41.183\nand pre-defining some steps.\n\n352\n00:21:41.183 --> 00:21:43.566\nIt's exactly the same\nwith Problem Management,\n\n353\n00:21:43.566 --> 00:21:45.331\nwe're going to do exactly the same.\n\n354\n00:21:45.331 --> 00:21:50.150\nWhen you define your\nProblem Management process,\n\n355\n00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:54.071\nI expect to you to define Problem Models,\n\n356\n00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:59.015\npredefined steps for\ndifferent types of problems.\n\n357\n00:21:59.015 --> 00:22:03.716\nNow, there's something that I haven't\nmentioned before coming up, and\n\n358\n00:22:03.716 --> 00:22:07.610\nthat's the Known Error and\nthe Known Error Database, okay.\n\n359\n00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.975\nSo let's go back to this\nexample that I gave you.\n\n360\n00:22:10.975 --> 00:22:15.595\nAnd the example that I used\nof the piece of paper and\n\n361\n00:22:15.595 --> 00:22:19.890\nthe tape,\nthat we used in a previous session.\n\n362\n00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.701\nSo that example of that piece of paper,\n\n363\n00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:29.949\nwe know that I have this liking for\ntearing up pieces of paper.\n\n364\n00:22:31.144 --> 00:22:35.100\nSo this is what we call a Known Error, and\n\n365\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.190\na Known Error is simply\nthe fact that we know.\n\n366\n00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:45.510\nSo, one of the ways of restoring service,\nokay, in a very efficient way.\n\n367\n00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.040\nCuz bear in mind, we're still concerned\nwith efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n368\n00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.551\nOne of the ways of restore\na service in an efficient way,\n\n369\n00:22:52.551 --> 00:22:55.479\nis simply just to have\nsome tape on hand for me.\n\n370\n00:22:55.479 --> 00:22:57.821\nI'm gonna start ripping\nup pieces of paper,\n\n371\n00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:00.976\nso therefore somebody needs to\nhave a roll of tape next to me.\n\n372\n00:23:00.976 --> 00:23:03.243\nSo that I can just take off that tape, and\n\n373\n00:23:03.243 --> 00:23:06.190\nI can just put the paper\nback together again, okay?\n\n374\n00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.770\nThat's what's called a Known Error.\n\n375\n00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:14.320\nAnd a Known Error is a problem for which\nwe know the root cause, you remember,\n\n376\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.633\nthey were my hands, and for\nwhich a workaround has been identified.\n\n377\n00:23:19.633 --> 00:23:24.100\nWell, we identified the workaround,\nit was that roll of tape, right?\n\n378\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.190\nSo what we'll do is we'll document that.\n\n379\n00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.424\nSo the next time that it happens,\nwe'll have that workaround to hand.\n\n380\n00:23:32.424 --> 00:23:36.320\nAnd we document that and\nput it into the Known Error Database.\n\n381\n00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.400\nEven though it's used by\nProblem Management to restore service,\n\n382\n00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.345\nthat Known Error is still\nowned by Problem Management.\n\n383\n00:23:45.345 --> 00:23:50.220\nSo it's used by Incident Management,\nand it's owned by Problem Management.\n\n384\n00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.072\nLet's put this into an IT perspective.\n\n385\n00:23:54.072 --> 00:24:00.171\nSo your laptop keeps locking up, we know\nthat your laptop is prone to locking up.\n\n386\n00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:04.289\nSo what we're going to do is, we're gonna\ndocument a Known Error that says, okay,\n\n387\n00:24:04.289 --> 00:24:06.750\nRonnie's laptop is prone to locking up.\n\n388\n00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:11.430\nSo if it happened, then just reboot it,\nthat's the workaround.\n\n389\n00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:15.090\nAnd what we've done is we've\ntaken a Known Error, and\n\n390\n00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.040\nwe've documented it with a workaround.\n\n391\n00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.200\nAnd you might ask, well, what's\nthe point in this, why do we do this?\n\n392\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.002\nWell, because when you\ncall the service desk,\n\n393\n00:24:24.002 --> 00:24:27.064\nyou're not going to get the same\nperson every single time.\n\n394\n00:24:27.064 --> 00:24:29.930\nAnd one time you might get me,\nand of course,\n\n395\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.457\nI know everything that I'm doing, okay.\n\n396\n00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:38.290\nBut another time, you might get\nsomebody else who's just started,\n\n397\n00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.910\nwho doesn't even know who you are.\n\n398\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.530\nAnd wouldn't it be great,\nif when you called the service desk,\n\n399\n00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.470\nit didn't matter who you spoke to?\n\n400\n00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.243\nThey're able to take your name and\nyour user ID, and\n\n401\n00:24:49.243 --> 00:24:52.281\nas soon as they type in your details,\nthey can say, hey.\n\n402\n00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:56.998\nRonnie's got a Known Error on his laptop,\nand this is what you do if\n\n403\n00:24:56.998 --> 00:25:01.730\nit's happened again, and\nit prompts that service desk analyst.\n\n404\n00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.500\nThat's kind of what we call efficiency.\n\n405\n00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.090\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n406\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:09.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's what we\nwant to achieve in ITIL, okay.\n\n407\n00:25:09.932 --> 00:25:13.883\nSo now, we've looked at the principles\nof Problem Management, and\n\n408\n00:25:13.883 --> 00:25:17.167\nwe look to the objectives of\nProblem Management, okay?\n\n409\n00:25:17.167 --> 00:25:19.453\nAnd what I'd like you to do right now,\n\n410\n00:25:19.453 --> 00:25:23.035\nis to take a look at the materials\nthat you've downloaded.\n\n411\n00:25:23.035 --> 00:25:26.910\nAnd look at the exercises\nrelating to the principles and\n\n412\n00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.718\nthe objectives of Problem Management.\n\n413\n00:25:29.718 --> 00:25:33.839\nNow we'd recommend 60 minutes,\nwe'd recommend an hour for you to do that.\n\n414\n00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:38.220\nAnd just take a look at the case study,I\nf you don't want to use the case study,\n\n415\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.020\nthen use the examples from\nyour own organization.\n\n416\n00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well that's\na great place for us to sign off,\n\n417\n00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:48.440\ncuz there's more episodes to come for\nProblem Management.\n\n418\n00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.190\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n419\n00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.500\n&gt;&gt;

The process flow shows us an effective and efficient way of problem management according to the team. Jo helps us to remember the problems are identified, logged, the problem management team must also categorize and prioritize the problems then take the time to investigate and diagnosis.  She explains also following that, we may need a workaround, resolution or change needed then closure.",

00:00:08.258\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:12.352\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:15.859\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode,\nright here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.717\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:20.637\nI'm your host,\n\n8\n00:00:20.637 --> 00:00:25.187\nRonnie Wong, and today we're taking a look\nat Problem Management process flow.\n\n9\n00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:27.894\nWe've already talked about the idea\nof some of the principles behind\n\n10\n00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.210\nProblem Management.\n\n11\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.350\nAnd now we're about to actually\nlearn about the process flow itself\n\n12\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.690\nfrom the potentate of ITIL, Jo Peacock.\n\n13\n00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.944\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n14\n00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:39.790\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Ronnie, how are you this morning?\n\n15\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.979\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great as we continue on\nto learn more about Problem Management.\n\n16\n00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.868\nGreat material so\nfar as we've talked about it,\n\n17\n00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:52.120\nespecially the differences between\nincidences and Problem Management itself.\n\n18\n00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.315\nBut now this process flow,\nthat should help us out even more, so\n\n19\n00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:57.397\nJo, what are we gonna take a look at here?\n\n20\n00:00:57.397 --> 00:01:03.682\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so very similar to when we looked\nat the Incident Management process flow.\n\n21\n00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:06.811\nWe're going to take a look at\nProblem Management right now.\n\n22\n00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:10.412\nAnd we've already talked about\nthe differences between an incident and\n\n23\n00:01:10.412 --> 00:01:11.010\na problem.\n\n24\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.339\nAnd therefore, the difference\nbetween Incident Management and\n\n25\n00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:15.495\nProblem Management.\n\n26\n00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:19.040\nBut then we've also talked about\nsimilarities between Incident and\n\n27\n00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.028\nProblem Management as well, and the fact\nthat the two are very much related.\n\n28\n00:01:23.028 --> 00:01:26.564\nAnd we're going to take a look\nat the process flow itself now.\n\n29\n00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:30.260\nAnd you will see when you look at\nthis process flow, it looks very,\n\n30\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.901\nvery similar to one that\nyou've already seen.\n\n31\n00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.830\nThat would be the Incident Management\nprocess flow.\n\n32\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.220\nThere are a few differences and\nwe're going to go through them.\n\n33\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.347\nBut in the last session,\nwe talked about models and\n\n34\n00:01:42.347 --> 00:01:46.358\nwe've talked about models within\nIncident Management as well.\n\n35\n00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:51.228\nAnd we've talked right away throughout\nservice operation about the fact that\n\n36\n00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:53.882\nwe adapt ITIL to suit our own environment,\n\n37\n00:01:53.882 --> 00:01:57.690\nthat we have to make ITIL efficient and\neffective for us.\n\n38\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.250\nSo what we've got here is just an example\nof a Problem Management process\n\n39\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.157\nflow, okay.\n\n40\n00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:07.110\nThis is not what you would\nhave in your organization.\n\n41\n00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.360\nThis is not a one size fits all.\n\n42\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.410\nThis is not a pill that you\ncan take that's going to solve\n\n43\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.420\nall of your challenges within\nIT service management.\n\n44\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.002\nThis is just simply a framework for\n\n45\n00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:25.658\nyour adaptation for ITIL.\n\n46\n00:02:25.658 --> 00:02:28.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Jo, I'm noticing\nsomething a little bit, to me,\n\n47\n00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.240\nunusual about the process flow that\nwe're about to take a look at.\n\n48\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.672\nIt actually looks fairly linear in\ncomparison to what we've seen in event\n\n49\n00:02:36.672 --> 00:02:39.750\nmanagement and\neven in Incident Management here.\n\n50\n00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.423\nSo is this as straightforward\nas it sounds?\n\n51\n00:02:43.423 --> 00:02:45.839\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was just about to say,\njust wait.\n\n52\n00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n53\n00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:50.453\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is actually as\nstraightforward as it sounds, and\n\n54\n00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:51.668\nin the last episode,\n\n55\n00:02:51.668 --> 00:02:55.796\nwe looked at the fact that you might\nnot always want to resolve a problem.\n\n56\n00:02:55.796 --> 00:03:00.077\nBut we have to make that decision as to\nwhether we want to resolve a problem.\n\n57\n00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:02.738\nBut it is fairly linear.\n\n58\n00:03:02.738 --> 00:03:05.258\nIt is fairly straightforward.\n\n59\n00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:08.990\nIf you look at this, we detect\nthe problem, we log it, categorize it,\n\n60\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.000\nprioritize it, and\ninvestigate and diagnose it.\n\n61\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.411\nAnd we've got that relationship with\nthe Configuration Management System.\n\n62\n00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:18.238\nIt looks fairly similar to\nIncident Management and\n\n63\n00:03:18.238 --> 00:03:20.300\nit is fairly straightforward.\n\n64\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.307\nThat doesn't make it easy though.\n\n65\n00:03:21.307 --> 00:03:21.860\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n66\n00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.456\n&gt;&gt; There's a big difference\nbetween being simple and easy.\n\n67\n00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:27.028\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n68\n00:03:27.028 --> 00:03:30.011\nwe like the keep it simple\napproach within ITIL.\n\n69\n00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:33.727\nAnd we like the keep it\nsensible approach as well.\n\n70\n00:03:33.727 --> 00:03:38.575\nWe want to make sure that whatever\nprocess you define is relevant\n\n71\n00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:40.710\nto your organization.\n\n72\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.340\nIt can't just be a one\nsize fits all approach.\n\n73\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.931\nYou can't just take it out of the ITIL\npublications and make it fit,\n\n74\n00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:49.134\ncuz it simply won't.\n\n75\n00:03:49.134 --> 00:03:50.410\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n76\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.460\nYou'll notice that there is difference\nbetween Incident Management and\n\n77\n00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.940\nProblem Management because you see\nright at the very top the inputs in\n\n78\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.981\nthe Problem Management are different.\n\n79\n00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:04.559\nSure, we're got\nthe Incident Management coming in.\n\n80\n00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:05.275\nBut look at this.\n\n81\n00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:08.470\nWe've got event management,\nwe've got the service desk,\n\n82\n00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.794\nwe've got proactive Problem Management.\n\n83\n00:04:10.794 --> 00:04:14.721\nAnd we've even got some problems\ncoming from suppliers, or\n\n84\n00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.494\nit mentions contractors in there as well.\n\n85\n00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:22.898\nYou see, anybody can report a potential\nproblem, absolutely anybody.\n\n86\n00:04:22.898 --> 00:04:27.110\nRemember these known errors that I\ntalked about in the last section.\n\n87\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.323\nAnd those known errors were,\nI know that your PC is going to look up,\n\n88\n00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:38.132\nso I've got a predefined\nway of restoring service.\n\n89\n00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:41.846\nResolving the incident, okay,\nthat's what a known error is.\n\n90\n00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:45.572\nWe also have different\ntypes of known errors, too.\n\n91\n00:04:45.572 --> 00:04:49.310\nHave you ever had a software\nrelease from a supplier and\n\n92\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.000\nit's come with a list of known errors?\n\n93\n00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.797\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes we have a laugh,\n\n94\n00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:59.275\ndon't we, and say, yeah, they're features\nbut actually they're known errors.\n\n95\n00:04:59.275 --> 00:04:59.973\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n96\n00:04:59.973 --> 00:05:05.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're going to log those\nin the Known Error Database, too.\n\n97\n00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.260\nOur suppliers can tell us of a problem.\n\n98\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.600\nNow that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat we can resolve the problem.\n\n99\n00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.620\nBut it might mean that they're\nworking to resolve the problem.\n\n100\n00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.700\nSo it's still a problem.\n\n101\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.380\nIt's a root cause of an incident, and\nit could potentially be an incident\n\n102\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.680\nbecause of that recourse,\nbecause of that problem.\n\n103\n00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.750\nSo problems can be reported, yes, by\nthe service desk and Incident Management\n\n104\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.970\nbecause we want to find the root cause for\nan incident that we already have.\n\n105\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.216\nThey can even come in from,\nas I've already said, event management.\n\n106\n00:05:38.216 --> 00:05:41.387\nNow then management is\nthat automated process, or\n\n107\n00:05:41.387 --> 00:05:45.087\ncertainly the only process\nthat could be automated fully.\n\n108\n00:05:45.087 --> 00:05:48.460\nAnd they could raise problem records,\ntoo, okay.\n\n109\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.118\nAnd then of course, proactive\nProblem Management, as we looked at in\n\n110\n00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:56.706\nthe previous episode, proactive Problem\nManagement is about identifying problems,\n\n111\n00:05:56.706 --> 00:06:01.046\npreventing incidents from happening,\npreventing that reduction in service, or\n\n112\n00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:03.480\nthe interruption to service.\n\n113\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.355\nSo all of these are what we call triggers\nto the Problem Management process flow.\n\n114\n00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:11.703\nAnd then we detect the problem and\nwe log it.\n\n115\n00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:14.137\nNow we categorize it.\n\n116\n00:06:14.137 --> 00:06:18.013\nAnd in a couple of slides time,\nyou will see, and in fact,\n\n117\n00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:21.337\nwe're going to go through\nin the next few slides,\n\n118\n00:06:21.337 --> 00:06:24.765\nwe're going to go through\neach one of these steps.\n\n119\n00:06:24.765 --> 00:06:28.878\nBut I like to do that to be honest, while\nwe've got it on the screen in front of us,\n\n120\n00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:31.610\nbecause we can see it in a linear way.\n\n121\n00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.638\nSo we categorize these incidents,\nthese problems.\n\n122\n00:06:34.638 --> 00:06:36.420\nI'm sorry, now I'm.\n\n123\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.798\n[LAUGH] We categorize these problems\nin the same way that we would\n\n124\n00:06:40.798 --> 00:06:43.330\ncategorize incident.\n\n125\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.660\nSo let me ask you, Ronnie,\nwhy do you think we do that?\n\n126\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.381\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I'm really kind of lost.\n\n127\n00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:57.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well remember I said that we're\nusing the same service management system.\n\n128\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.172\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n129\n00:06:58.172 --> 00:07:01.888\n&gt;&gt; And remember, I told you that we\nhave to link them together, don't we?\n\n130\n00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:05.163\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So for continual service improvement,\n\n131\n00:07:05.163 --> 00:07:08.887\nfor CSI, and\nto accommodate trend analysis as well,\n\n132\n00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.801\nwe have to have the same categorization.\n\n133\n00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:12.600\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n134\n00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.870\n&gt;&gt; We have to have standards in there so\n\n135\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.320\nthat we can actually link\nincidents to problems.\n\n136\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.170\nIf we have two different standards, if we\nhave an inconsistency, it's gonna be very,\n\n137\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.440\nvery difficult to manage\nthose relationships.\n\n138\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.760\nSo we would categorize in the same way\nthat we would with Incident Management.\n\n139\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.622\nNow that's not to say it's\na carbon copy because it's not and\n\n140\n00:07:34.622 --> 00:07:36.227\nthere are going to be exceptions.\n\n141\n00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:36.974\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n142\n00:07:36.974 --> 00:07:41.458\n&gt;&gt; We have to allow for the fact that\nsometimes we are only ever going to fix\n\n143\n00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:43.510\nan incident on certain things.\n\n144\n00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.435\nAnd for some things we're only interested\nin the problems, especially those\n\n145\n00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:51.182\nthat have been reported by the suppliers,\nfor instance, that may not have\n\n146\n00:07:51.182 --> 00:07:55.010\neven generated or caused an incident and\nhopefully they never will, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.200\nSo we'd categorize in\nusing the same principles.\n\n148\n00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.640\nThat we do with an incident management.\n\n149\n00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.727\nAnd then we prioritize.\n\n150\n00:08:05.727 --> 00:08:09.973\nNow, notice two elements that\nwe use to prioritize incidents,\n\n151\n00:08:09.973 --> 00:08:13.746\nwhen we looked at the incident\nmanagement process flow,\n\n152\n00:08:13.746 --> 00:08:18.935\nthose same two categories, or elements\nthat we use to prioritize incidents,\n\n153\n00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:22.690\nthe same that we prioritize\nour problems too.\n\n154\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:28.160\nSo we prioritize based on impact and\nurgency, impact being\n\n155\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.420\nthe impact to the organization, and the\nurgency being how urgent it is right now.\n\n156\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.880\nAnd then of course we've got targets,\n\n157\n00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.550\nhaven't we,\nin those service level agreements for\n\n158\n00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:45.280\nhow we respond to problems, as well\nas incidents, given their priorities.\n\n159\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.380\nSo, of course,\nagain that prioritization table and\n\n160\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.870\nthat agreement as to what is\nconsidered a priority one, well,\n\n161\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.920\nthat's gonna appear in the SLA2 because\nthen there's no room for any ambiguity.\n\n162\n00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.355\nSo, once we've done all of that, that's\nkind of the preliminary work, really,\n\n163\n00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:05.290\nsnd then we'll go off to investigate and\ndiagnose.\n\n164\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.440\nAnd of course we pull all of\nthe information in from that configuration\n\n165\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.880\nmanagement system.\n\n166\n00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.590\nSo, the next few slides are just\ngoing to go over what I talked about.\n\n167\n00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.530\nLooking at the triggers, what starts\nthe problem management process?\n\n168\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.790\nAnd of course, in the last section,\n\n169\n00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.710\nwe already looked at the fact that\nproblem management is reactive.\n\n170\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:31.300\nIn other words, is responding to\nincidents that are happening right now.\n\n171\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.880\nBut also proactive, too, because we're\ntrying to prevent interruptions to\n\n172\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.780\nservice, or prevent reductions in\nthe quality of the service, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.010\nSo we detect.\n\n174\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.848\nHow do you detect the incident?\n\n175\n00:09:44.848 --> 00:09:48.690\nWell, even if management is gonna\nhelp us with some automation,\n\n176\n00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.380\nthe service desk are going tell us\nwhat incidents we have right now, and\n\n177\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.610\nthey will make choices as to\nwhether we wanna raise a problem.\n\n178\n00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:00.130\nAnd you know what, sometimes users\nmake choices too, I asked you in\n\n179\n00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.480\nthe last session, you were having a lot\nof trouble with your laptop session-\n\n180\n00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.370\n&gt;&gt; I remember that, yup.\n\n181\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.180\n&gt;&gt; Weren’t you, yeah, and in the last\nsession your laptop kept locking up,\n\n182\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.520\nand I said to you,\ndo you wanna find out what went wrong?\n\n183\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.135\nAnd you said?\n\n184\n00:10:13.135 --> 00:10:18.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it depends on the urgency\nof the moment more than likely.\n\n185\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.990\nIf I had the time to do it, I probably\nwould, but if I really just need to get\n\n186\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.735\nsomething done I just want to be be\nable to solve the issue and go on.\n\n187\n00:10:25.735 --> 00:10:28.755\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\nwhat we did was just reboot it.\n\n188\n00:10:28.755 --> 00:10:29.675\n&gt;&gt; Reboot.\n\n189\n00:10:29.675 --> 00:10:32.275\n&gt;&gt; And so that's left up to you,\nand in that instance,\n\n190\n00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:35.675\nthat interaction you're the user and\nthat choice is left up\n\n191\n00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:38.505\nto you as to whether you wanna\nraise the problem or not.\n\n192\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.300\nSo problems can be raised by, well it even\nmentioned sixth sense and intuition then.\n\n193\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.988\nYou know you get that feeling sometimes\nin IT when something is just wrong, and\n\n194\n00:10:49.988 --> 00:10:52.100\nwe're not sure what it is.\n\n195\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.300\nAnd in this instance we'd encourage you to\nraise a problem, because if nothing else\n\n196\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:04.050\nyou can keep track of that instinct,\nbut you can also follow it through.\n\n197\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.635\nYou know that it's there,\n\n198\n00:11:06.635 --> 00:11:09.993\nit's that little niggly feeling\nthat something's not quite right.\n\n199\n00:11:09.993 --> 00:11:13.397\nAnd so you've got it logged so\nyou don't forget about it,\n\n200\n00:11:13.397 --> 00:11:16.325\nbut you can also follow it\nthrough at a later date.\n\n201\n00:11:16.325 --> 00:11:20.346\nIf you're having that little niggly\nfelling that there's something not quite\n\n202\n00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:25.180\nright, I guarantee you that somebody\nelse is having that niggly feeling too.\n\n203\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:30.193\n&gt;&gt; Right, now Jo, I don't mean to\nshoot completely off topic here,\n\n204\n00:11:30.193 --> 00:11:35.475\nbut in the sense where we're allowing\nthe user or whoever the customer\n\n205\n00:11:35.475 --> 00:11:41.115\nis to decide when something is the\nincident or the problem since there are so\n\n206\n00:11:41.115 --> 00:11:45.769\nmany varieties, do we also include\nthat in like an SLA to say,\n\n207\n00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:49.924\nafter three attempts it should\nbe logged as a problem.\n\n208\n00:11:49.924 --> 00:11:54.900\nOr is that just something we go,\nno that's just left up to whoever?\n\n209\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.350\n&gt;&gt; Well that's entirely up to you.\n\n210\n00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n211\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.342\n&gt;&gt; There you go, there's an answer.\n\n212\n00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:00.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's look at some guidelines\n\n213\n00:12:00.948 --> 00:12:04.280\nreally on that one,\nyou can put that in the SLA.\n\n214\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.625\nThere's no reason why you can't put that\nin the SLA at all, and anything that's in\n\n215\n00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:12.845\nthe SLA is an agreement with the customer\nfor how we will deliver the service, and\n\n216\n00:12:12.845 --> 00:12:16.472\nif they perceive value in that,\nthen why shouldn't it be in the SLA.\n\n217\n00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:21.446\nSo there's absolutely no reason why not,\nand as we've seen just in the last\n\n218\n00:12:21.446 --> 00:12:26.265\nfew sections, you've seen that this\nservice level agreement is a really\n\n219\n00:12:26.265 --> 00:12:30.610\nimportant document and\nis a really comprehensive document too.\n\n220\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:36.200\nSo there's no reason why it couldn't\nbe in the SLA, if it's not in the SLA,\n\n221\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.070\nthen perhaps we can have policies\nwithin problem management for\n\n222\n00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.078\nthis is when we raise a problem.\n\n223\n00:12:42.078 --> 00:12:46.120\nIf we're seeing this incident five times,\nthen we need to raise a problem and\n\n224\n00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.620\nfound out what's happening.\n\n225\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.370\nYou most definitely will have\na policy that will outline that.\n\n226\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.010\nIf you don't have a policy\nthat outlines that,\n\n227\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.660\nthen problem management is really\nperformed on an ad hoc basis.\n\n228\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.340\nAnd if it's performed on an ad hoc basis,\nthen there's no consistency.\n\n229\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.480\nAnd if there's no consistency,\nhow can you measure effectiveness?\n\n230\n00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.580\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n231\n00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.610\n&gt;&gt; And you can't measure efficiency\neither, okay, so it's very,\n\n232\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.170\nvery important that we\nhave that consistency.\n\n233\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.320\nSo, we've already gone over,\nwe logged the incident,\n\n234\n00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.460\nand we have to log the problem, sorry.\n\n235\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.790\n[LAUGH] We have to log\nabsolutely everything, and\n\n236\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.970\nwe categorize it in\nthe same way as incidents.\n\n237\n00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:30.310\nAnd this is ideally using the same system,\nit is ideal and\n\n238\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.875\nwe understand that there\nare going to be exceptions.\n\n239\n00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:34.686\nAnd that discussion there,\n\n240\n00:13:34.686 --> 00:13:39.672\nthe discussion point at the bottom there\nasks about what benefits you can see?\n\n241\n00:13:39.672 --> 00:13:43.872\nWell we've already talked about some\nof the benefits, and the relationships\n\n242\n00:13:43.872 --> 00:13:47.436\nbetween incidents and problem\nmanagement is a huge benefit to us,\n\n243\n00:13:47.436 --> 00:13:50.890\nto allow us to ascertain the impact\nof any particular problems.\n\n244\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:58.224\nAnd we prioritize based on urgency and\nimpact, as we said.\n\n245\n00:13:58.224 --> 00:14:05.430\nNow, we should also have what we call\na severity assessment on any problem.\n\n246\n00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.757\nAnd that severity assessment ties into\nwhat we were talking about in the last\n\n247\n00:14:11.757 --> 00:14:12.445\nsession.\n\n248\n00:14:12.445 --> 00:14:17.389\nIn the last session remember we talked\nabout having that decision that\n\n249\n00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:21.850\nwe would have to make as to whether\nwe'd fix the problem or not.\n\n250\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.110\nMaybe we can't fix the problem because\nwe don't have enough skills, or\n\n251\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.100\nmaybe it's gonna cost too\nmuch to fix the problem.\n\n252\n00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.470\nOr maybe we decide we're not\ngoing to fix that laptop,\n\n253\n00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.860\nwe're going to buy you a new one.\n\n254\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:40.450\nBut in the case of that server, well,\nit's really past due for retirement.\n\n255\n00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.500\nIf that fails then we're not actually\ngoing to fix, or replace, that server.\n\n256\n00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.300\nAnd that would take a role\nin our severity assessment.\n\n257\n00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.990\nAnd that severity assessment\nreally is a strategic decision\n\n258\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.910\nas to what we're going\nto do with that problem.\n\n259\n00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.580\nSo we'd utilize all of the techniques\n\n260\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:08.560\nto analyze the problem to try and get to\nthe bottom of it, find out what the root\n\n261\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.580\ncause is, and then we're going to\nidentify what the solution is.\n\n262\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:20.843\nAnd then we make that decision as to\nwhether we implement that solution or not.\n\n263\n00:15:23.626 --> 00:15:28.560\nThen the second part of this\nparticular process flow.\n\n264\n00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.460\nNow, we talked about investigation and\ndiagnosis,\n\n265\n00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.930\nthis is where we're doing this work and\nwe're undertaking techniques such as\n\n266\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.050\nIshikawa that we looked at,\nand the five whys, and lots\n\n267\n00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:44.300\nof other problem management techniques\nthat are detailed in your notes.\n\n268\n00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:52.470\nNow, we may identify a workaround,\nand if we identify a workaround,\n\n269\n00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.733\nthen we create a known error, and\nwe put it into the known error database.\n\n270\n00:15:56.733 --> 00:16:00.842\nOkay, and the workaround in the example\nthat I gave you was, obviously,\n\n271\n00:16:00.842 --> 00:16:02.378\nyour laptop had locked up.\n\n272\n00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:05.760\nWe've identified a workaround,\nwe just simply reboot it, and\n\n273\n00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.709\nit's in that known error database.\n\n274\n00:16:07.709 --> 00:16:12.085\nNow that known error database should\neither be part of the core login system\n\n275\n00:16:12.085 --> 00:16:16.682\nthat we use, or the service management\nsystem as we like to call it that we use.\n\n276\n00:16:16.682 --> 00:16:20.920\nOr it should be related to the core\nmanagement system so that,\n\n277\n00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.809\nwhen the service desk analyst takes\nyour phone call, takes your name,\n\n278\n00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:30.960\ntakes your user ID, they can see\nstraight away what problems you've had.\n\n279\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.926\nWhat incidents you've had\nwith your laptop, and\n\n280\n00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:38.600\nthen identify that workaround that's\ngoing to restore your service, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.100\nNow something else that I wanted\nto bring in is the next step,\n\n282\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.570\nis there a chain record needed?\n\n283\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.930\nNow, in service transition,\n\n284\n00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:54.230\nwe will take a look at the change\nmanagement process flow.\n\n285\n00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.750\nChange management is about controlling\nchange to the infrastructure and\n\n286\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.320\nchange to our environment.\n\n287\n00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.000\nBecause we want to ensure that change is\nimplemented with minimal negative impact,\n\n288\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.200\nmaximum positive impact, but minimal\nnegative impact on the environment.\n\n289\n00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.845\nSo, if you need a new laptop\nbecause of this problem,\n\n290\n00:17:15.845 --> 00:17:20.810\nthen that's a change because\nwe're changing an asset.\n\n291\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.547\nWe're changing a component,\na configuration item, and\n\n292\n00:17:24.547 --> 00:17:27.680\ntherefore we'll need to\nraise a change record.\n\n293\n00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.252\nNo, this should not be complicated.\n\n294\n00:17:30.252 --> 00:17:35.038\nWe've gotta think about efficiency, and\nso raising a change record could be\n\n295\n00:17:35.038 --> 00:17:39.840\nas simple as just putting a check in\nthe box in the service management system.\n\n296\n00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.577\nAs long as the service\nmanagement system has been\n\n297\n00:17:43.577 --> 00:17:48.510\nset up with the correct models\nto facilitate this process flow.\n\n298\n00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.850\nbut we will look further at\nchange management when we look at\n\n299\n00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:53.860\nservice transition.\n\n300\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:02.560\nThen hopefully we are going to resolve\nthe problem and then close the record.\n\n301\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.824\nAnd if there is a major problem,\nvery similar to incident management,\n\n302\n00:18:06.824 --> 00:18:11.371\nif it is a major problem in other words\nit has got high impact Or high urgency,\n\n303\n00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:14.306\nthen we are going to have\na major problem review.\n\n304\n00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:18.150\nSo, if there's been significant\nbusiness impact, then we're going to\n\n305\n00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.940\nhave this major problem review where\nwe simply look at lessons learned.\n\n306\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.602\nWhat we we could do better next time,\nwhat went wrong, how we fixed it, and\n\n307\n00:18:26.602 --> 00:18:31.190\nwhat we could learn from that, and\nwhat we could apply to other problems.\n\n308\n00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.570\nSo we've already mentioned workarounds and\n\n309\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:39.230\na workaround is,\nwell this is a temporary measure, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:46.830\nRebooting a screen is a workaround, and\nthen we have the entire process flow.\n\n311\n00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:51.920\nOkay, just to summarize, it looks very,\nvery similar to incident management.\n\n312\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.970\nAnd It follows the same categorization\nas incident management, and\n\n313\n00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.270\nit should also be undertaken and\n\n314\n00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.850\nlogged in the same service management\ntool as incident management too.\n\n315\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:10.770\nSo that we can have those relationships in\nplace, but ultimately what we are looking\n\n316\n00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:16.820\nto do, is we're looking to resolve\nthe root causes of one or more incidents.\n\n317\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.342\nJo, thank you again for\n\n318\n00:19:18.342 --> 00:19:23.070\nhelping us to review this idea of\nthe process flow in problem management.\n\n319\n00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:27.115\nIt really is going to become helpful as\nwe continue to develop our skills here in\n\n320\n00:19:27.115 --> 00:19:28.465\nservice operations, and\n\n321\n00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:32.288\nit is something that we should consider\nthat it is never going to be ad hoc.\n\n322\n00:19:32.288 --> 00:19:37.895\nThere should be some process to what\nwe are doing to help us in the ideas,\n\n323\n00:19:37.895 --> 00:19:39.865\nideals of ITIL, right?\n\n324\n00:19:39.865 --> 00:19:43.680\nThe efficiency and the effectiveness\nof everything that we're doing here.\n\n325\n00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.730\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n326\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.490\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n327\n00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.670\n&gt;&gt;

continue on\nin dealing with problem management.\n\n13\n00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.510\nThere's a lot of stuff that\nwe've already covered.\n\n14\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.730\nNow we've come to this part on metrics.\n\n15\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.480\nSo, how are we gonna take a look at the\nidea of using the metrics to help us out\n\n16\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.299\nin our organization?\n\n17\n00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.380\n&gt;&gt; What well, we're actually going\nto do in this particular section,\n\n18\n00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.580\nis we're not just going\nto cover the metrics,\n\n19\n00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.050\nwe're actually going to cover the\nrelationships between the other processes.\n\n20\n00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.880\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n21\n00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.640\n&gt;&gt; And the inputs and\noutputs really to problem management and\n\n22\n00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.820\nalso the metrics that we need to manage,\nproblem management.\n\n23\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Joe,\nwhere are we gonna get started?\n\n24\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nwell we're gonna start off by looking\n\n25\n00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.000\nat the interfaces within\nproblem management.\n\n26\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.071\nSo the inputs to problem management and\nthe outputs by problem management.\n\n27\n00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:19.978\nAnd you can see there they\nare straight on the screen there.\n\n28\n00:01:19.978 --> 00:01:23.725\nNow we looked at, earlier on we looked at,\n\n29\n00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:28.110\nin the previous section, the process flow.\n\n30\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.650\nAnd we looked at the triggers\ninto problem management and\n\n31\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.610\nwhat starts off the problem\nmanagement process.\n\n32\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.620\nI think there's a general misconception,\nthe process has started as if by magic.\n\n33\n00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.080\nAs though somebody waves a magic wand and\nall of a sudden things happen.\n\n34\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.440\nWell of course, we have to with\nevery process have a defined trigger\n\n35\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.420\nsomething that starts that process off.\n\n36\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.090\nProblem management doesn't just happen.\n\n37\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.950\nVery similar to incident management,\nit doesn't just happen.\n\n38\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.960\nSomebody's gotta call us and tell us that\nthey're having issues with their laptops,\n\n39\n00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.930\nfor instance, yeah.\n\n40\n00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.200\nSo problem management was split\ninto both proactive and reactive.\n\n41\n00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.330\nAnd problem management is about\nidentifying the root cause of one or\n\n42\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.850\nmore incidences, also the potential root\ncause of an incident that might happen.\n\n43\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.400\nSo you can imagine, what sort of\ninformation that we need to be able to do\n\n44\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.350\nthat, as well as those triggers, as well\nas the incidences that have occurred.\n\n45\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.220\nAnd we use the example of your laptop, if\nyour laptop locks up then the first thing\n\n46\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.910\nthat you do is reboot it, and\nof course that just restores service.\n\n47\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.040\nIt just resolves the incident.\n\n48\n00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.100\nBut we've not found out the root cause,\nwhich is the problem.\n\n49\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.600\nAnd so, we choose to raise a problem,\nin that instance.\n\n50\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.700\nWe choose,\nwe don't automatically raise a problem.\n\n51\n00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.320\nSo, that's a trigger,\nthat choice is a trigger.\n\n52\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.870\nAnd there are many other trigger's that we\nlooked at, such as event management, and\n\n53\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.200\neven suppliers that can\ngive us information.\n\n54\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.830\nNow, we'd consider them to be triggers,\nbut\n\n55\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.855\nwe'd also consider them to be\ninputs into problem management.\n\n56\n00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:07.020\nThe problem management also does\na lot of investigation, diagnosis.\n\n57\n00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.811\nProblem management techniques are used\nwithin problem management to identify root\n\n58\n00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:12.356\ncauses.\n\n59\n00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:16.306\nAnd a problem management technique\ncould be something as simple as what we\n\n60\n00:03:16.306 --> 00:03:17.610\ncall a top.\n\n61\n00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.780\nA technical observation post.\n\n62\n00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.970\nWhere we simply wait and watch, and\nwait it out and see what happens.\n\n63\n00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.770\nAnd we use that sort of technique in\ninstances where we've seen failures.\n\n64\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.280\nWe've seen your laptop, it's locked up,\nwe can't identify what the problem is.\n\n65\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.140\nSo we're going to watch it, wait for\nit to happen, and when it happens again\n\n66\n00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.630\nthen we can get into the root cause and\nfind out exactly what's going on.\n\n67\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.900\nAnd so that's a technique that we use.\n\n68\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.800\nBut you see it's, again,\nit's an input into problem management\n\n69\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.600\nthe skills that are required to be\nable to undertake those techniques.\n\n70\n00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.750\nSo let's look at some of these inputs.\n\n71\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.260\nWe've already talked about the triggers.\n\n72\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.210\nWe've talked about associated incidents or\nrelated incidents as I like to call them.\n\n73\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.987\nAnd we've talked in previous sessions\nabout that relationship with configuration\n\n74\n00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:11.407\nmanagement and the CMS.\n\n75\n00:04:11.407 --> 00:04:17.050\nAnd that gives us information on our CIs,\nour configuration items, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.860\nAnd then we've got the relationship\nwith incident management.\n\n77\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.830\nBut because we're all on\none call logging system\n\n78\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.380\nwe've also got the relationship\nwith change management as well.\n\n79\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.860\nAnd also with request fulfillment and\nevent management too.\n\n80\n00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.240\nSo all of that is an input\ninto problem management.\n\n81\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.820\nWe also take information,\nsuch as the event logs themselves,.\n\n82\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.030\nSuch as the requirements and\n\n83\n00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.079\nthe targets that we have agreed with our\ncustomers in our service level agreements.\n\n84\n00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.870\nWe'll take into consideration.\n\n85\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.890\nRemember we did in the last section,\na severity assessment, so\n\n86\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.370\nwe'll take that it consideration too.\n\n87\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.440\nSo things like budget is\nan input into problem management.\n\n88\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.780\nAlso, the strategy of the organization and\nthe strategy of our IT.\n\n89\n00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.350\nThat is an input into problem management\nalong with customer feedback,\n\n90\n00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.940\nalong with even risk management too and\nhand in hand with availability management,\n\n91\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.770\na process that we look at in\nthis service design module.\n\n92\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.530\nThen we would perform risk\nmanagement to identify\n\n93\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.440\npotential points of failure and\nthen make decisions hand in hand with\n\n94\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.590\navailability management as to what we do\nwith those potential points of failure.\n\n95\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.490\nAnd we'll make those decisions\nbased on a risk assessment.\n\n96\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.305\nDo we actually want to prevent\nthat problem from happening?\n\n97\n00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:46.570\nDo we wanna wear the redundancy\non mirroring, or\n\n98\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.640\ndo we actually want to just accept\nthe risk and say, well you know,\n\n99\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.650\nyou don't know It's probably\nnot going to happen.\n\n100\n00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.650\nSo let's not worry about it.\n\n101\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.565\nOkay?\n\n102\n00:05:56.565 --> 00:06:00.145\nAnd then of course what comes\nout of problem management, well,\n\n103\n00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:04.410\nyou'd like to think resolve problems\ncame out of problem management.\n\n104\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.250\nBut you know what?\n\n105\n00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.355\nWe don't always want to resolve a problem.\n\n106\n00:06:07.355 --> 00:06:10.890\nAnd we looked at them in more\ndepths in the last section.\n\n107\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.270\nSo it's not always resolved problems,\nit could be closed problems.\n\n108\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.295\nBut we don't close a problem unless\nwe've made a definite decision\n\n109\n00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:22.865\nto close that problem and\nthere's a reason for that decision.\n\n110\n00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:26.365\nAnd maybe that decision may\nbe documented in the SLA.\n\n111\n00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:27.155\nWho knows?\n\n112\n00:06:27.155 --> 00:06:29.505\nBut it would certainly\nbe part of strategy.\n\n113\n00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:33.196\nAnd we would have somebody that would\ntake accountability for that decision.\n\n114\n00:06:33.196 --> 00:06:37.576\nNow known an error records come\nout of problem management too and\n\n115\n00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:41.389\nof course they're used by\nincident management in order\n\n116\n00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.367\nto resolve incidents to restore services.\n\n117\n00:06:45.367 --> 00:06:47.747\nAnd then improvement opportunities.\n\n118\n00:06:47.747 --> 00:06:52.877\nI would expect to see that as an output\nfrom every single process within\n\n119\n00:06:52.877 --> 00:06:58.530\nthe whole of item, Improvement\nopportunities are way that we can,\n\n120\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.950\nways, sorry in the plural that we can\nalign ourselves to the organization.\n\n121\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.270\nIt's all about delivering\nvalue to our organization.\n\n122\n00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.930\nWe want to facilitate the outcomes\nthat they need in order to\n\n123\n00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.978\nbe able to survive as an organization and\ngrow.\n\n124\n00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:23.980\nOkay, so I mentioned some relationships\nhere with some of the processes.\n\n125\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.350\nAnd I mentioned the relationships\nwith service level management to no\n\n126\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.190\nservice level agreement and\n\n127\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.440\nI've mentioned the relationship with\nchange management in the previous section.\n\n128\n00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.110\nWell, we raise changes in\norder to resolve problems and\n\n129\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.180\nI've just briefly mentioned\navailability management term.\n\n130\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.602\nWhat I'm going to do now, I'm just\ngonna spend a little bit of time and\n\n131\n00:07:46.602 --> 00:07:48.763\nwe're gonna go clockwise around this web.\n\n132\n00:07:48.763 --> 00:07:53.348\nAnd I'm gonna spend a little bit of time\njust talking more about configuration\n\n133\n00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.641\nmanagement and about availability and\n\n134\n00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.854\ncapacity management and\nknowledge management term.\n\n135\n00:07:58.854 --> 00:08:03.530\nNow configuration management provides\nus with all of the information about\n\n136\n00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.770\nthe configuration of our infrastructure.\n\n137\n00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.440\nAbout the components of each service and\nof course, some of those are shared.\n\n138\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.720\nWe don't have one network for email,\nand another network for office,\n\n139\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.740\nand another network for our internet.\n\n140\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.991\nWe have just one network.\n\n141\n00:08:21.991 --> 00:08:24.941\nSo some components of services are shared.\n\n142\n00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:26.310\nYou only have four laptop.\n\n143\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.390\nYou don't have 15 for\neach different service.\n\n144\n00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.544\nI don't think I'd be able to handle 15.\n\n145\n00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:32.917\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To be honest.\n\n146\n00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:35.910\nI can barely remember the password for\none nowadays.\n\n147\n00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.180\nSo, configuration management not just\ngives us the configuration of all our\n\n148\n00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:46.180\nservices and tells us what our CIs are,\nit also importantly gives us those\n\n149\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.160\nrelationships between all of\nthose configuration items.\n\n150\n00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.560\nSo we know exactly what\nservices are on this laptop.\n\n151\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.028\nSo I know exactly what PCs\nare connected to that router.\n\n152\n00:08:59.028 --> 00:09:04.485\nSo configuration management really\nhas to be that sort of accurate and\n\n153\n00:09:04.485 --> 00:09:09.479\nreliable information that we use\nin problem management to get to\n\n154\n00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:12.899\nthe bottom of why things are happening,\nand\n\n155\n00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:17.540\nalso then to fix that problem,\nto solve the root cause.\n\n156\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:22.690\nSo without accurate and reliable\ninformation from configuration management,\n\n157\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.130\nit would be very, very difficult for\n\n158\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:30.100\nus to effectively undertake problem\nmanagement, very difficult.\n\n159\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:35.740\nSo configuration management has a role\nin giving us accurate information.\n\n160\n00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:41.502\nWe also have a role, and that role is to\nensure that configuration is accurate.\n\n161\n00:09:41.502 --> 00:09:46.290\nSo if we see inaccuracies than\nwe have to highlight that.\n\n162\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:51.110\nIf we have made changes, if we've\nraised a change to resolve a problem,\n\n163\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.470\nthen we have to make sure\nthat that change is reflected\n\n164\n00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.660\nin our configuration\nmanagement system too.\n\n165\n00:09:58.258 --> 00:10:02.137\nNow I mentioned availability\nmanagement and availability and\n\n166\n00:10:02.137 --> 00:10:06.391\ncapacity management are two of what\nwe call our warranty processes.\n\n167\n00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.217\nThey sit within the service\ndesign life cycle process.\n\n168\n00:10:09.217 --> 00:10:12.365\nAnd they're both split\ninto both proactive and\n\n169\n00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:15.745\nreactive, very similar to\nproblem management, actually.\n\n170\n00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:17.555\nAnd now these are processes.\n\n171\n00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:23.250\nAnd what I'd like you to understand is\nreally a process is a set of activities.\n\n172\n00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.843\nNow I can perform more than\none process at any one time.\n\n173\n00:10:28.843 --> 00:10:31.630\nWell all right I could\nwhen I was in my 20s,\n\n174\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.215\nI don't supposed I'm that good at it now.\n\n175\n00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:37.624\n[LAUGH] But I can perform more than\none process in any point in time so\n\n176\n00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:42.622\nthe person that's performing\nproactive problem management could\n\n177\n00:10:42.622 --> 00:10:47.182\nalso be performing proactive\navailability management, and\n\n178\n00:10:47.182 --> 00:10:49.741\nproactive capacity management.\n\n179\n00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:54.180\nYou see, availability\nmanagement is about identifying\n\n180\n00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.064\npotential points of failure and\nthen planning for\n\n181\n00:10:58.064 --> 00:11:03.400\nwhat we are going to do about\nthose potential points of failure.\n\n182\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.330\nThat's the proactive side\nof availability management.\n\n183\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.455\nAnd capacity management from a proactive\nperspective is about identify\n\n184\n00:11:11.455 --> 00:11:17.430\na capacity requirements and preventing\nbreeches to those capacity requirements.\n\n185\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.760\nSo preventing capacity failures, okay.\n\n186\n00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.599\nThese are the proactive sides\nof those particular processes.\n\n187\n00:11:25.599 --> 00:11:30.233\nSo, when proactive problem management\nis looking at preventing failure and\n\n188\n00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:32.942\npreventing incidents, well guess what, so\n\n189\n00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:36.598\nis capacity management and so\nis availability management.\n\n190\n00:11:36.598 --> 00:11:41.950\nSo they work hand in hand together\nto prevent interruption to service.\n\n191\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.215\nThat level of service that's outlined\nin the service level agreement.\n\n192\n00:11:46.215 --> 00:11:50.224\nNow, all three of these processes\nhave reactive elements too,\n\n193\n00:11:50.224 --> 00:11:55.410\nand problem management has a reactive\nelement, reacting to incidents.\n\n194\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.645\nAnd part of the objectives\nof both capacity and\n\n195\n00:11:59.645 --> 00:12:05.943\navailability management is also to\nhelp with problem management and\n\n196\n00:12:05.943 --> 00:12:10.627\nwith incident management\nin resolving problems.\n\n197\n00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:14.293\nAnd also restoring service\nto ensure that we maintain\n\n198\n00:12:14.293 --> 00:12:19.080\nthose levels of service that\nhad been agreed in the SLA.\n\n199\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:24.430\nSo capacity and availability management\nwork hand in hand with problem management\n\n200\n00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.130\nand with incident management too.\n\n201\n00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.270\nAnd that brings us around\nthen to knowledge management.\n\n202\n00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.965\nNow, I mentioned in a previous section\nthat knowledge management was about\n\n203\n00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:36.000\nhaving wisdom.\n\n204\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.308\nI've also mentioned in a previous module\n\n205\n00:12:40.308 --> 00:12:45.155\nabout the fact you thought we were\nin IT and we like pretty pictures.\n\n206\n00:12:45.155 --> 00:12:47.220\nAnd we like to produce reports.\n\n207\n00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.950\nAnd sometimes it feels like, they're just\nreports for the sake of having reports.\n\n208\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.940\nA graph just because we feel\nlike we should have one.\n\n209\n00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.100\nThat nobody really looks at.\n\n210\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.950\nWell, knowledge management is about\ninsuring that we have got the right\n\n211\n00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:09.300\ninformation available, at the right\ntime to enable informed decision making.\n\n212\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.610\nNow problem management does trend\nanalysis which we've already looked at in\n\n213\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.210\na previous module.\n\n214\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.864\nSo knowledge management will help by\nensuring that that information is\n\n215\n00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.033\navailable to us.\n\n216\n00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:23.380\nBut knowledge management actually\nencompasses more than just reports.\n\n217\n00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.972\nKnowledge management is about\nall of our data sources.\n\n218\n00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:29.040\nSo that includes things\nlike unknown errors.\n\n219\n00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:36.810\nIt includes things like having the\ndocumentation for the skills that we need.\n\n220\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.500\nThose sort of activity documentations,\nthose standard operating procedures, etc.\n\n221\n00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.380\nThat will tell us how to do something\nif we're not quite sure how to do it.\n\n222\n00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.350\nSo in knowledge management, make sure that\nwe've got that right information available\n\n223\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.198\nto us at the right time to help\nus perform problem management.\n\n224\n00:13:53.198 --> 00:13:57.819\nSo knowledge management their role is\nto ensure that we've got the right\n\n225\n00:13:57.819 --> 00:13:58.810\ninformation.\n\n226\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.914\nThat that information is up to date and\n\n227\n00:14:01.914 --> 00:14:07.347\nthat's available to us to help us\ndiagnose and resolve problems.\n\n228\n00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.470\nSo I mentioned that we were\ngonna look at metrics.\n\n229\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.229\nSo I know that we've already\ntalked a little bit about graphs.\n\n230\n00:14:12.229 --> 00:14:17.285\nBut I wanted to talk about relationships\nas well I like to talk come on.\n\n231\n00:14:17.285 --> 00:14:20.533\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo,\nwith the idea of that relationship.\n\n232\n00:14:20.533 --> 00:14:24.771\nAt least, I'm starting to see a picture\nhere that problem management really\n\n233\n00:14:24.771 --> 00:14:29.006\nisn't gonna be effective if We don't\nhave the knowledge, or the capacity,\n\n234\n00:14:29.006 --> 00:14:30.130\nthe availability.\n\n235\n00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.093\nOr I don't know why I can't remember the\nother one that we were just talking about.\n\n236\n00:14:34.093 --> 00:14:37.438\nBut if we don't have all that information\nthat's up to date, that's complete,\n\n237\n00:14:37.438 --> 00:14:38.690\nthat's accurate.\n\n238\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.158\nProblem management itself becomes\nat least, more difficult,\n\n239\n00:14:42.158 --> 00:14:44.092\nif not almost impossible, right?\n\n240\n00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:47.712\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the one that you couldn't think\nof that was on the tip of your tongue was\n\n241\n00:14:47.712 --> 00:14:49.115\nconfiguration management.\n\n242\n00:14:49.115 --> 00:14:49.793\n&gt;&gt; Configuration, yeah.\n\n243\n00:14:49.793 --> 00:14:52.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and configuration\nmanagement ensures that we've\n\n244\n00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:57.820\ngot accurate information about all of\nour services and how they hang together.\n\n245\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.230\nAnd certainly, without the inputs\nfrom configuration management,\n\n246\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.390\nwe simply couldn't perform problem\nmanagement very effectively.\n\n247\n00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.630\nAnd if we were to be efficient,\nwe would be ineffective, but efficient.\n\n248\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.551\nSo we would just get to\nthe wrong result quicker.\n\n249\n00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:17.222\nSo configuration management is key, and\nI like to think of the configuration\n\n250\n00:15:17.222 --> 00:15:20.770\nmanagement system as being\nthe foundation for the whole of ITIL.\n\n251\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.380\nBecause without that\nconfiguration management system,\n\n252\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.970\nwithout that accuracy, then we can't\nperform availability management.\n\n253\n00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.475\nWe can't perform capacity\nmanagement very effectively, and\n\n254\n00:15:31.475 --> 00:15:35.257\nwe can't perform incident or\nproblem management for that matter.\n\n255\n00:15:35.257 --> 00:15:40.938\nSo configuration management really\nis the foundation stone for\n\n256\n00:15:40.938 --> 00:15:43.500\nall of our ITL processes.\n\n257\n00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.075\nBecause that provides us\nwith the information.\n\n258\n00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:50.193\nNow knowledge management provides us with\nthe relationships between all of our data\n\n259\n00:15:50.193 --> 00:15:51.250\nsources.\n\n260\n00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:55.531\nSo we may go to configuration management\nfor information about our hardware.\n\n261\n00:15:55.531 --> 00:15:58.772\nAnd even where software is located.\n\n262\n00:15:58.772 --> 00:16:03.320\nKnowledge management is\ngoing to give us the how to.\n\n263\n00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.590\nSo it's going to give us the reporting.\n\n264\n00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:10.025\nIt's going to give us the documentation\nand the standard operating procedures and\n\n265\n00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:14.350\nits going to ensure that all of that\ninformation is accurate for us.\n\n266\n00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:20.080\nWe're able to do our role into his off\nproblems efficiently and effectively.\n\n267\n00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.630\nThose relationships are very important.\n\n268\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.670\nAnd without those relationships then\nsimply problem management is just not\n\n269\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.830\neffective.\n\n270\n00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was just thinking of myself\nin an example of what happened and\n\n271\n00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.050\nlet me know if this actually does work.\n\n272\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:38.700\nIn this place where I've been\nhelping somebody out in configuring\n\n273\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.770\na Cisco router before and they just told\nme it's configured to do this, this, and\n\n274\n00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:43.940\nthis, and this.\n\n275\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.980\nBut without actually providing me the\nconfiguration, I started troubleshooting\n\n276\n00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:53.020\nto what they said it was, and\nthen finally I said, it's still.\n\n277\n00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.830\nWhen I realized it wasn't working I\nsaid I just need to take a look at\n\n278\n00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.100\nthe configuration itself\nthat is on that router.\n\n279\n00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.190\nAnd I realized it wasn't\nconfigured anything like what they\n\n280\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.110\nactually said it was configured.\n\n281\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.970\nSo for me,\nthat particular configuration being wrong\n\n282\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:11.260\nreally led me on a problem-solving\nsituation that I could not have actually\n\n283\n00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.170\nfigured out unless I had the right and\naccurate information.\n\n284\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.210\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhat you just demonstrated today there,\n\n285\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:21.010\nis the exact reason why need\naccurate configuration information.\n\n286\n00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.580\nAnd we use all sorts of tools.\n\n287\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.350\nAnd we look at this further when we\nlook at this service transition life\n\n288\n00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.360\ncycle phase.\n\n289\n00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:32.390\nBut we use all sorts of tools to be able\nto gain the accuracy of that information.\n\n290\n00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.835\nWe have network detection\ntools that would go out and\n\n291\n00:17:34.835 --> 00:17:39.265\nwill detect the exact accurate\nstate of every single CI.\n\n292\n00:17:39.265 --> 00:17:41.045\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And there a lots of ways,\n\n293\n00:17:41.045 --> 00:17:44.690\nwe're not just relying on\ninformation from people.\n\n294\n00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:45.412\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n295\n00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:49.592\nBut problem management as you discovered,\nyou cannot get to the root cause of\n\n296\n00:17:49.592 --> 00:17:53.242\nthe a problem without having\nthat accurate information.\n\n297\n00:17:53.242 --> 00:17:56.644\nAnd what it meant for\nyou is that resolving a problem and\n\n298\n00:17:56.644 --> 00:17:59.762\ngetting to the root cause\nwas an inefficient method.\n\n299\n00:17:59.762 --> 00:18:00.532\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n300\n00:18:00.532 --> 00:18:03.782\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't something that was because\nyou didn't have any information\n\n301\n00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:04.782\nat your fingertips.\n\n302\n00:18:04.782 --> 00:18:07.192\nIt wasn't something\nthat you could just do.\n\n303\n00:18:07.192 --> 00:18:08.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n304\n00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.840\n&gt;&gt; And the problem that we\nhave with problem management\n\n305\n00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.430\nis that sometimes we end up, because\nwe're kind of flailing in the dark,\n\n306\n00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.390\nwe end up duplicating our efforts.\n\n307\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.440\nWe end up trying the same thing three or\n\n308\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.890\nfour times, because we rely on\nthe information that we have.\n\n309\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.740\nI'm sure you did at the time.\n\n310\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.080\nYou relied on that information and\nsaid well, you know what,\n\n311\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.620\nthis is the information I've got.\n\n312\n00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.090\nI'm pretty sure it's accurate so\nI'm gonna keep trying this.\n\n313\n00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.740\nAnd it didn't give me the result I wanted.\n\n314\n00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.660\nSo let me just check the information.\n\n315\n00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.210\nYeah I'm pretty sure it's accurate,\nand you try it again.\n\n316\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.330\nAnd it's not until after about three or\n\n317\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.150\nfour attempts that you think well\nmaybe the information's not accurate.\n\n318\n00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.950\nWell of course by that time\nhow much time have you wasted?\n\n319\n00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:51.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n320\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.690\n&gt;&gt; And this is why having\nthose relationships in place\n\n321\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.490\nnot only ensures sort of an efficiency in\nterms of time but just think of the cost.\n\n322\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That we've wasted in trying to get to\n\n323\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.430\nthat root cause.\n\n324\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.850\nSo configuration management is key.\n\n325\n00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.530\nAnd if we take a look at the CFFs,\n\n326\n00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:13.250\nthe examples of the CFFs that we've\ngot here for config, sorry, for\n\n327\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:18.289\nproblem management, it's about minimizing\nbusiness impact and maintaining quality.\n\n328\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:25.060\nAnd focusing on the professionalism and\nthe quality of problem management.\n\n329\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.920\nI explained in incident management\nthe difference between a CSF and a KPI.\n\n330\n00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.300\nAnd a CSF is a critical success factor,\nit's something we have to achieve.\n\n331\n00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.720\nAnd the KPIs will tell us\nwhether we have achieved an CSF.\n\n332\n00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.110\nAnd we're always going to have\nmore than one KPI per CSF.\n\n333\n00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:47.960\nWe should have at least a minimum\nof two to three KPI's per CSF.\n\n334\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.255\nAnd over the time as you become\nmore mature in your process,\n\n335\n00:19:53.255 --> 00:19:57.395\nI expect the number of KPIs\nto grow as we understand\n\n336\n00:19:57.395 --> 00:20:00.935\nwith more accuracy exactly\nwhat it is we want to measure.\n\n337\n00:20:00.935 --> 00:20:05.025\nBut you see a CSF often fairly intangible,\nand so\n\n338\n00:20:05.025 --> 00:20:10.235\nwe use the KPIs to measure whether\nwe are achieving those CSFs.\n\n339\n00:20:10.235 --> 00:20:15.560\nNow I expect your CSFs to be focused\non delivering value to the business.\n\n340\n00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.740\nAnd I expect them to be focused\non efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n341\n00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.760\nSo minimizing that business impact, well,\n\n342\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.040\nthat's about efficiency and\nit's about effectiveness.\n\n343\n00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.050\nAnd delivering value,\nall at the same time.\n\n344\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.430\nAnd look at the KPI's.\n\n345\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.850\nThey refer to the configuration management\ndatabase, the CMDB, that we talked about.\n\n346\n00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:41.455\nThe accuracy of the information\nin our no error database.\n\n347\n00:20:41.455 --> 00:20:44.323\nIf problem management is\nworking efficiently and\n\n348\n00:20:44.323 --> 00:20:49.104\neffectively then we're actually going to\nreduce the number of incidents that have\n\n349\n00:20:49.104 --> 00:20:53.608\nto be passed to another team, that have\nto have that functional escalation and\n\n350\n00:20:53.608 --> 00:20:55.201\nthen the second CSF there.\n\n351\n00:20:55.201 --> 00:20:59.310\nAnd these are just\nexamples if you remember.\n\n352\n00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:04.500\nThese are examples that appear\nin our IT publications that I\n\n353\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:10.970\nexpect you to completely\ntailor to your needs.\n\n354\n00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.060\nYou'll come up with your own CSF's for\nyour problem management.\n\n355\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.910\nThe KPI's on quality, weve talked\nabout number of problems there and\n\n356\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.770\nthe size of the problem backlog.\n\n357\n00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.970\nIf were talking about quality I expect to\nsee some form of customer satisfaction\n\n358\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.400\nin there to.\n\n359\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.750\nBut that's going to be a challenge for\n\n360\n00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.280\nproblem management you see because\nnot all problems are raised by users.\n\n361\n00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.620\nSome problems are raised\nby a technical team and\n\n362\n00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:41.830\nif we've got problem management working\nproactively, then the proactive\n\n363\n00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:46.480\nside of problem management is going to\nbe completely hidden from the users.\n\n364\n00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.970\nBut we still take customer satisfaction\ninto consideration because,\n\n365\n00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.370\nlet's take a look at that first CSF.\n\n366\n00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.370\nIt's about minimizing\nbusiness impact of incidents.\n\n367\n00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.630\nWell, if we do a proactive\nproblem management right and\n\n368\n00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.570\nwe prevented failure, then therefore,\nwe're reducing the number of incidents.\n\n369\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.680\nAnd if we're reducing\nthe number of incidents,\n\n370\n00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.180\nthen we're delivering better\nvalue to our business.\n\n371\n00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.250\nOr if we're producing workarounds\nthat incident management can use\n\n372\n00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:19.260\nto restore service, then we're\nproviding better value to our business.\n\n373\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.880\nSo despite the fact that\nsome of problem management\n\n374\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.050\ndoesn't have a direct\ninteraction with the business,\n\n375\n00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:30.400\nit still does have an interaction\njust through incident management.\n\n376\n00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:36.990\nSo the KPI's that you have relating to the\nquality focused problem management process\n\n377\n00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.760\nis all about efficiency.\n\n378\n00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.030\nLook at the number of problems\nincorrectly assigned.\n\n379\n00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:48.600\nIf it's been assigned to somebody else,\nthen we have that example that we used\n\n380\n00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:54.070\nin incident management module, where you\nhave an incident or a problem record that\n\n381\n00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:59.040\njust passed around from one team to\nanother, that's not efficient, okay?\n\n382\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.050\nSo we want to ensure that we\nmaintain quality by ensuring that\n\n383\n00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:10.270\nproblems are managed by the people that\nneed to have access to those problems so\n\n384\n00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:15.430\nthat we have policies in place and\nvery, very clear policies in place for\n\n385\n00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:19.390\nwho will work on what\nparticular type of problem.\n\n386\n00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.410\nSo we understand where\nour boundaries lie and\n\n387\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.690\nwe understand what skills we\nneed within each problem type.\n\n388\n00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:27.630\nAnd that, in turn,\n\n389\n00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.730\nwill reduce hopefully, not just\nthe time that's spent on a problem, but\n\n390\n00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.890\nhopefully the cost of a problem\nbecause it will be resolved quicker.\n\n391\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.750\nNow, when it talks about cost per problem,\n\n392\n00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.580\nwe also have to take\ninto consideration the,\n\n393\n00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.660\nyou know what, we're gonna have to buy\nhardware sometimes to resolve the problem.\n\n394\n00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.173\nAnd there's no way around that.\n\n395\n00:23:47.173 --> 00:23:52.257\nAnd so, again, whilst we're looking to\nreduce the cost of problem resolution,\n\n396\n00:23:52.257 --> 00:23:54.332\nsometimes, it's inevitable.\n\n397\n00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:59.143\nAnd sometimes,\nwe just can't get around that at all.\n\n398\n00:23:59.143 --> 00:24:00.791\nSo, problem management then.\n\n399\n00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:04.170\nWell, we've already talked\nabout some of the challenges.\n\n400\n00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.990\nAnd we've talked about the challenges of\nhaving that interaction with the other\n\n401\n00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.530\nprocesses and it mentions it\nthere in those bullet points,\n\n402\n00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:16.810\nthe interprocess flows if we don't\nhave those relationships in place.\n\n403\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:21.660\nAnd I just mentioned about incidents\nthat have been passed around from\n\n404\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.540\npillar to post, essentially.\n\n405\n00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.820\nAnd that's that second and\nthird line stuff relationship.\n\n406\n00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.290\nWe want clear boundaries.\n\n407\n00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.390\nWe don't want people saying,\nit's not my problem.\n\n408\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.990\nWe want to establish clear boundaries,\nand clear relationships, and\n\n409\n00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.110\nclear responsibilities too.\n\n410\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.020\nWe need that.\n\n411\n00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.030\nWe need that for\nproblem management to be effective.\n\n412\n00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:49.620\nBut we also need an effective and\ndeficient incident management process too,\n\n413\n00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.820\nbecause incident management is one of\nthe main triggers into problem management.\n\n414\n00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.900\nAnd after all, it's one of the main\ninputs and one of the main outputs too,\n\n415\n00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.100\nbecause incident management\ncomes into problem management.\n\n416\n00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.090\nWe raise problems as a result\nof an incident that we've had,\n\n417\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.720\nor prevent incidents.\n\n418\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.171\nBut incident management is also an output\nto problem management because we want to\n\n419\n00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:13.365\nprevent incidents.\n\n420\n00:25:13.365 --> 00:25:18.133\nAnd we want to feed workarounds\nto incident management to enable\n\n421\n00:25:18.133 --> 00:25:21.158\nthem to be more efficient.\n\n422\n00:25:21.158 --> 00:25:24.333\nSo what about then some of\nthe risks that we've got,\n\n423\n00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:27.159\nwhat could cause problem\nmanagement to fail?\n\n424\n00:25:28.811 --> 00:25:32.296\nIf I look at the first two or\nthree bullet points,\n\n425\n00:25:32.296 --> 00:25:36.390\nthese all refer to issues\nthat we've just talked about.\n\n426\n00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.602\nPoor information flows,\n\n427\n00:25:39.602 --> 00:25:45.192\nthe lack of tools to support all of those\nrelationships and the information flow.\n\n428\n00:25:45.192 --> 00:25:49.220\nBut then look at the lack of training,\nand the lack of skills,\n\n429\n00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.238\nthat can be a challenge, too.\n\n430\n00:25:51.238 --> 00:25:53.744\nYou can't expect me to\nresolve a problem very,\n\n431\n00:25:53.744 --> 00:25:56.450\nvery efficiently if I\ndon't know what I'm doing.\n\n432\n00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n433\n00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.850\nSo, I need to have the right skills and\n\n434\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.190\nnot just skills in terms\nof technical skills.\n\n435\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:09.100\nI don't need to necessarily have that Unix\nadvanced administrative qualification.\n\n436\n00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:14.673\nWhat I do need though is access to\nthe right standard operating procedures,\n\n437\n00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:20.261\nthe right documentation that will help\nme to identify root causes quickly.\n\n438\n00:26:20.261 --> 00:26:23.450\nSo we're not just talking\nabout the technical skills.\n\n439\n00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.311\nWe're also talking about skills and\nproblem solving techniques as well.\n\n440\n00:26:28.691 --> 00:26:34.040\nWe've got to be very, very careful that\nproblem management is both proactive and\n\n441\n00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.840\nreactive until we get that balance right.\n\n442\n00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.360\nAnd that we work very closely\nwith availability, and\n\n443\n00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.320\nwith capacity management.\n\n444\n00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.130\nThe first bullet point in\nthe risks talks to us about\n\n445\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.650\nthe overload of problems that\ncan't be handled in time frames.\n\n446\n00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.664\nNow there are time frames\nthat are assigned in the SLA.\n\n447\n00:26:54.664 --> 00:26:59.856\nThey're mentioned again in the bottom\nbullet point in the contracts in OLAs.\n\n448\n00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.204\nIf problem management is not efficient,\nif problem management is not effective,\n\n449\n00:27:05.204 --> 00:27:07.571\nbecause say for instance,\nwe don't have the skills,\n\n450\n00:27:07.571 --> 00:27:10.270\nthen we're going to\nhave a problem backlog.\n\n451\n00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.670\nWe're gonna have a backlog\nin the number of problems.\n\n452\n00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.450\nAnd we don't want that, obviously.\n\n453\n00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.999\nWe want to demonstrate that we can\ndeliver value to the business.\n\n454\n00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.710\nSo it's very,\nvery important that we understand\n\n455\n00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.490\nwhat skills are needed to\nperform problem management.\n\n456\n00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:31.685\nAnd so we also have to consider the staff\nin numbers as well as the skills.\n\n457\n00:27:31.685 --> 00:27:35.846\nBut we also have to consider\nthe decisions that we have to make.\n\n458\n00:27:35.846 --> 00:27:38.973\nI've seen many organizations, and I mean,\n\n459\n00:27:38.973 --> 00:27:42.759\nthousands of organizations\nthat I've been into, and\n\n460\n00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:47.959\nI consulted where I see problem records\nsit in there for years in the queue.\n\n461\n00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:53.420\nAnd I ask why they do that, and they\nwill often tell me, well you know what,\n\n462\n00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.015\nwe don't want to resolve the problem,\nso we've left the problem open.\n\n463\n00:27:57.015 --> 00:27:58.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n464\n00:27:58.492 --> 00:28:02.309\nif you don't want to resolve the problem\nthat's fine, and you document that you\n\n465\n00:28:02.309 --> 00:28:06.740\ndon't want to resolve the problem, and\ncommunicate that with the organization.\n\n466\n00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.040\nAnd if it's in the SLA that\nat this point in time,\n\n467\n00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:15.990\nwe've decided that service is going to be\nretired, then we can close that problem.\n\n468\n00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.400\nWe don't have to keep it open.\n\n469\n00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.040\nBut, it has to be documented, and\n\n470\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.138\nit has to be agreed with the business\nthat that's what we're going to do.\n\n471\n00:28:25.138 --> 00:28:29.830\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well, thank you again for\nhelping us out here when we start\n\n472\n00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:34.130\ntaking look at the idea of some of these\nmetrics that we've been talking about.\n\n473\n00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.597\nAnd remember that in this episode, we did\ntake a look at some of the inner process\n\n474\n00:28:38.597 --> 00:28:42.274\nrelationships as well as the critical\nsuccess factors and KPIs.\n\n475\n00:28:42.274 --> 00:28:45.393\nAnd lastly, right here we talked\nabout some of the challenges and\n\n476\n00:28:45.393 --> 00:28:49.363\nrisks associated with what we're actually\ngonna be seeing that really do help us to\n\n477\n00:28:49.363 --> 00:28:53.450\nmake sure that we understand, what is\nat stake if we don't manage this well.\n\n478\n00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:55.030\nNow, Jo, you have something else to say?\n\n479\n00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:59.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I just wanted to add that I\ndo really recommend that what we do right\n\n480\n00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.019\nnow is take a look at the notes\nthat you've downloaded.\n\n481\n00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:07.594\nThere is a lot more information in\nthe notes in regards to problem management\n\n482\n00:29:07.594 --> 00:29:13.210\ntechniques, and that's something that you\nwill need to do some further research on.\n\n483\n00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.580\nAnd also in regards to the relationship\nbetween all over processes and\n\n484\n00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.650\nrelationships between all that talk,\nso we allocate at least an hour.\n\n485\n00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.660\nWe would tell you that,\nthat's what you should be doing for\n\n486\n00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.240\nyour next hour or at least on appropriate\ntime, take a look through the notes.\n\n487\n00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.810\nAnd if you do have any questions about any\nof the problem management techniques, or\n\n488\n00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.810\nabout any of the relationships at all,\nthen we have the forum.\n\n489\n00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:43.089\nAnd that's exactly why I'm here, to help\nyou navigate your way through those notes.\n\n490\n00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.220\nAll right, Joe, well thank you.\n\n491\n00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.510\nIt's a great reminder as we\ncontinue on our study towards\n\n492\n00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.670\nthe idea of everything that\nwe want to learn about ITIL.\n\n493\n00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.950\nBut it's also a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n494\n00:29:54.950 -->

Jo leads us through the idea of request fulfillment and identifies that users seek either a service or knowledge in request fulfillment.  Unlike an incident, which causes service interruption, according to Jo, a request fulfillment will provide a consistent and standardized service through the policies that are in place to guide how a company manages this request fulfillment.",

00:00:08.272\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.272 --> 00:00:12.105\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.981\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:19.050\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.120\nI'm you host Ronnie Wong and today,\nwe're diving into request fulfillment.\n\n8\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.830\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be\nour very own Dumbledore of ITIL.\n\n9\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.999\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.724\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:37.950\n&gt;&gt; Wow, well what can I say to that\nother than do I need to grow the beard?\n\n12\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.074\n&gt;&gt; No, you do?\n\n13\n00:00:39.074 --> 00:00:40.262\n&gt;&gt; Okay then, well that's fine.\n\n14\n00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:41.740\nCuz I think I might so-\n&gt;&gt; I told you,\n\n15\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.850\nyou'd find out what I was saying here.\n\n16\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.870\nSo Jo, in the realm of request\nfulfillment as we get started,\n\n17\n00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.100\nfor someone outside of ITIL, like I am,\nI'm not really jumped into it fully.\n\n18\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.800\nIt sounds like fulfilling a wish list.\n\n19\n00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.875\nIs that what we're talking about?\n\n20\n00:00:58.875 --> 00:00:59.667\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.\n\n21\n00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:00.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.\n\n23\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.795\nThe one thing that I can tell you is that,\nunlike Harry Potter-\n\n24\n00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:07.432\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:07.432 --> 00:01:09.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not everyone gets their wishes\n\n26\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.170\nfulfilled, and I don't have a magic wand.\n\n27\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Aw, well.\n\n28\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.800\n&gt;&gt; I wish I did.\n\n29\n00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.300\n[LAUGH] No, we don't give everybody\neverything that they want.\n\n30\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.809\nAnd so, actually request fulfillment,\nyou could think about it as a misnomer or\n\n31\n00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:30.648\nyou could think about it as just slightly,\nI wouldn't say misleading,\n\n32\n00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:34.982\nbut misconstrued sometimes\nby some organizations.\n\n33\n00:01:34.982 --> 00:01:37.804\nBecause it's not about\nfulfilling requests,\n\n34\n00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:40.490\nit's actually about dealing with request.\n\n35\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.022\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And actually, that's the word used in\n\n36\n00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:46.510\nthe autopublication is\nthe word dealing with request.\n\n37\n00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.220\nWe like to transposed that into managing\nrequest and it's about handling and\n\n38\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.233\nmanaging request but it's about dealing\nwith request and sometimes, we say no.\n\n39\n00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:59.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwhere are we gonna begin today?\n\n40\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.100\n&gt;&gt; Right, well we're just gonna\nlook at the principles really\n\n41\n00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.930\nof request fulfillment.\n\n42\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.560\nAnd just look at the process itself and\nwhat request fulfillment strives to do and\n\n43\n00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.823\nthe policies, and objectives, etc.\n\n44\n00:02:10.823 --> 00:02:14.290\nAnd then, we're going to get a little\nbit further in another session.\n\n45\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.591\nWe're going to delve into\nthe actual process itself.\n\n46\n00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:21.371\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go and start with\nwhat we see right here on the screen,\n\n47\n00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:24.270\nwhat do we take again in\nterms of the purpose?\n\n48\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.732\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nas I've already told you,\n\n49\n00:02:26.732 --> 00:02:31.104\nthe purpose of request fulfillment is\nactually to deal with requests from users.\n\n50\n00:02:31.104 --> 00:02:37.121\nAnd it provides a common,\nconsistent method for\n\n51\n00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:41.830\nusers to request things from IT.\n\n52\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.360\nNow, I say things and\nthat sounds really ambiguous and\n\n53\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.730\nit probably sounds like\na really clumsy word.\n\n54\n00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.581\nBut I like to summarize request\nfulfillment into two types of requests.\n\n55\n00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:54.740\nOkay, we have two types\nof requests from users.\n\n56\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.650\nWe have the, can I have something and\nthe call you tell me something?\n\n57\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.420\nSo can I have is all about\nstandard components of a service.\n\n58\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.690\nSo, can I have a new laptop, please?\n\n59\n00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.893\nCould I have access to\na particular service, please?\n\n60\n00:03:10.893 --> 00:03:13.140\nSo could I have something?\n\n61\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.660\nAnd then, can you tell me something\nas a request for information.\n\n62\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.255\nThey're both requests, so can you tell me\nhow to add two cells together in Excel,\n\n63\n00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:22.130\nfor instance.\n\n64\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.780\nOr can you tell me whether\nthe service desk is going to be\n\n65\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.230\navailable over the weekend?\n\n66\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.695\nSo two different types of requests.\n\n67\n00:03:29.695 --> 00:03:32.099\nSo those bullet points in the objectives,\n\n68\n00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.924\nyou'll see that they can be split\ninto can I have and can you tell me.\n\n69\n00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:40.380\nSo providing a channel for users to\nrequest standard services such as can\n\n70\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.189\nI have a new laptop or\ncan I have access, can I have something.\n\n71\n00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.380\nProviding information to users\nabout service availability is can\n\n72\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.885\nyou tell me something.\n\n73\n00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:54.080\nSourcing and\ndelivering elements of requested services.\n\n74\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.560\nCan I have something?\n\n75\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.382\nAnd again, general information,\ncomplaints, comments, can you tell me?\n\n76\n00:04:00.382 --> 00:04:06.430\nSo there are two elements there are no,\nthere isn't a clear definition.\n\n77\n00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.710\nBut anything that really falls into\nthe realms of can I have something or\n\n78\n00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.590\ncan you tell me something is\npart of request fulfillment.\n\n79\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.840\nNow, and this is where, there is a little\nbit of ambiguity there because that\n\n80\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.800\nthird bullet point under scope.\n\n81\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.660\nIt says can be dealt with by a separate\nteam or a separate management tool.\n\n82\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.830\nWe would like, we would prefer for\n\n83\n00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.860\nthe sake of efficiency and for\neffectiveness and for the relationships,\n\n84\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.680\nwe would prefer that it's dealt with\nwithin the same service management tool.\n\n85\n00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.834\nWe would also recommend\nthat request fulfillment is\n\n86\n00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:53.443\nmanaged as a separate process and\nnot part of incident management.\n\n87\n00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.080\nIn a previous module, we looked at\nincident management process flow.\n\n88\n00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.934\nAnd in that particular module, as you\nlooked at the incident management process,\n\n89\n00:05:05.934 --> 00:05:10.281\nprobably along the second step,\nmaybe second or third step of\n\n90\n00:05:10.281 --> 00:05:15.398\nthe incident management process,\nwe actually filtered the incident.\n\n91\n00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.877\nAnd we made that decision.\n\n92\n00:05:16.877 --> 00:05:18.967\nWas it a request or was it an incident?\n\n93\n00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:23.525\nAnd we said, if it's a request,\nthen it should be handled differently.\n\n94\n00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:28.812\nNow, some organizations will choose to\nmanage requests as part of incident\n\n95\n00:05:28.812 --> 00:05:34.690\nmanagement using exactly the same tool and\nexactly the same module within the tool.\n\n96\n00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.787\nThat can make, it can,\nnot necessarily does, but that can make it\n\n97\n00:05:39.787 --> 00:05:45.636\nvery difficult to differentiate between\nrequests and between incidents.\n\n98\n00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:50.408\nAnd of course, a request is, can I\nhave something whereas an incident is\n\n99\n00:05:50.408 --> 00:05:55.115\nan interruption to a service or\na reduction in the quality of a service.\n\n100\n00:05:55.115 --> 00:05:59.545\nSo from the user perspective, an incident\nis something that's gone wrong.\n\n101\n00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:03.040\nWhereas a request is\nsomething that they want.\n\n102\n00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.105\nSo you can manage it as\na type of incident and\n\n103\n00:06:06.105 --> 00:06:09.570\njust simply have it as a category\nwithin incident management.\n\n104\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.400\nBut we would recommend that it's\nmanaged as a separate process itself.\n\n105\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.044\nWhat we want to achieve, again with\nfocus on efficiency and effectiveness\n\n106\n00:06:21.044 --> 00:06:26.026\nwith Request Fulfillment, and what we want\nto achieve is actually a consistent and\n\n107\n00:06:26.026 --> 00:06:28.249\nstandard way of managing requests.\n\n108\n00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:33.484\nAnd Request Fulfilment is quite\noften triggered and managed up and\n\n109\n00:06:33.484 --> 00:06:39.012\nto a point, by the end user interface\nto the service management tool.\n\n110\n00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:43.247\nNow, I mentioned in a previous\nepisode that we have different\n\n111\n00:06:43.247 --> 00:06:46.343\ninterfaces into service\nmanagement tool and\n\n112\n00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:50.823\nwe'll sometimes have uses that\nwill log request on incidents and\n\n113\n00:06:50.823 --> 00:06:55.558\nproblems directly using the front-end\ninterface to the Internet.\n\n114\n00:06:55.558 --> 00:07:00.132\nBut sometimes, nowadays, these service\nmanagement tools, they collapse.\n\n115\n00:07:00.132 --> 00:07:03.879\nYou can do it via text message,\nyou can log a request via email,\n\n116\n00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:08.191\nyou can do it via an app on your cell\nphone that allows you to log a request or\n\n117\n00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:10.130\nto log an incident or a problem.\n\n118\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.358\nThe idea is that first bullet point is the\none that we really want to achieve which\n\n119\n00:07:16.358 --> 00:07:18.948\nis quick access to request fulfillment.\n\n120\n00:07:18.948 --> 00:07:24.223\nAnd therefore, quick access to standard\nservices and quick access to information.\n\n121\n00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:27.517\nSo already,\nI started talking about information.\n\n122\n00:07:27.517 --> 00:07:30.117\nSo that process of knowledge\nmanagement is going to really,\n\n123\n00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:32.247\nreally help us with this too.\n\n124\n00:07:32.247 --> 00:07:36.797\nAlso, problem management could help us\nwith this with some known errors and\n\n125\n00:07:36.797 --> 00:07:37.944\nsome FAQs as well.\n\n126\n00:07:37.944 --> 00:07:41.546\nSo we do have interfaces\ninto those other processes.\n\n127\n00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:42.656\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n128\n00:07:42.656 --> 00:07:45.758\nRequest fulfillment is not stand alone.\n\n129\n00:07:45.758 --> 00:07:49.301\nBut if we have that consistency,\nif we have process models,\n\n130\n00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:53.261\nthose pretty fine sets of steps that\nwe looked at in both incident and\n\n131\n00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:57.020\nin problem management,\nthen we should have less bureaucracy.\n\n132\n00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:04.283\nWe should have greater efficiency,\nwhile still maintaining the control.\n\n133\n00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:09.120\nSo, really a request fulfillment\nneeds to have policies.\n\n134\n00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.920\nWe need to have some\nform of decision making\n\n135\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.150\nthat says whether a request can be\ngranted, or whether it can't be granted.\n\n136\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.780\nThat applies to both elements\nof request fulfillment.\n\n137\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.550\nIf I call the service desk and I speak\nto you Ronnie, and I call you up and\n\n138\n00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.380\nI say can I have a new laptop please,\nare you gonna say yes to me straight away?\n\n139\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.460\n&gt;&gt; Probably not,\n\n140\n00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.000\nit would probably depend on guidelines,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.612\n&gt;&gt; More than likely, whether or\n\n142\n00:08:38.612 --> 00:08:39.980\nnot you're gonna get a new laptop or not.\n\n143\n00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.640\n&gt;&gt; So it wouldn't depend on\nwhether you liked me or not?\n\n144\n00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.585\n&gt;&gt; Well, not for a job, no [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so we have to have\n\n145\n00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:52.354\na policy in place that says whether I\nshould be allowed a new laptop or not.\n\n146\n00:08:52.354 --> 00:08:57.149\nOkay, so what about if I called you up and\nI said, okay then,\n\n147\n00:08:57.149 --> 00:09:01.661\ncould you tell me how to add in\na new cost type into to say SAP\n\n148\n00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:07.620\na financial management program,\nwould you help me with that?\n\n149\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.190\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nif I actually had the ability to do so and\n\n150\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.570\nthat was part of my job I probably would.\n\n151\n00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n152\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.774\nBut you didn't check whether I\nshould have had access to SAP.\n\n153\n00:09:17.774 --> 00:09:20.128\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n&gt;&gt; And whether I should actually have\n\n154\n00:09:20.128 --> 00:09:22.350\naccess to that information.\n\n155\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, I did not.\n\n156\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.480\n&gt;&gt; So, access to information, and I make\nthat point deliberately because access to\n\n157\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.450\ninformation is not just about\ngiving access to that information.\n\n158\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.640\nWe also have to check whether a person\nactually should have access to that\n\n159\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.520\ninformation.\n\n160\n00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.690\nNow I'm not telling you that everything\nshould be on a need to know basis and\n\n161\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.610\nwe should be really really\nsecretive with our information,\n\n162\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.380\nbecause that's not the case at all.\n\n163\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.790\nBut it's the same as when we move\ninto the Access Management Module.\n\n164\n00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:56.040\nWe'll look at people having access\nto certain services but perhaps they\n\n165\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.670\ndon't have the relevant security clearance\nor authorization to have access to.\n\n166\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.690\nAnd it's the same with our information.\n\n167\n00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.650\nObviously in certain organizations, and\n\n168\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.300\nwe better remind that ITIL came\nfrom a government background,\n\n169\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:15.055\ncertain information is classified or\nhas a classification ranking and\n\n170\n00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:18.940\nthat relates to or\napplies to whatever the organization is.\n\n171\n00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.824\nSo sometimes we don't always want\nto give out that information and\n\n172\n00:10:21.824 --> 00:10:24.572\nthe same way that we don't always\nwant to give out that laptop.\n\n173\n00:10:24.572 --> 00:10:26.832\nIt's not always approved.\n\n174\n00:10:26.832 --> 00:10:29.507\nSo we will have policies in place,\n\n175\n00:10:29.507 --> 00:10:33.488\nmost definitely for\nevery single type of request.\n\n176\n00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:36.574\nAnd that last bullet point\nunder the policies and\n\n177\n00:10:36.574 --> 00:10:41.200\nprinciples there refers to\nthe authorization considerations, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.880\nSo, I just wanna take you\nthrough those bullet points\n\n179\n00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.700\nthere on the left hand side and\nthe third one down that's really\n\n180\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.470\nsort of not self-explanatory is that\nconnection to a standard change.\n\n181\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.940\nChange management is covered in the\nservice transition life cycle phase, so\n\n182\n00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.370\nwe're not gonna spend a lot\nof time talking about that.\n\n183\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.700\nBut a standard change is a request for\n\n184\n00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:09.060\nchange that has been preauthorized\nby change management because it has\n\n185\n00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.080\nan acceptable level of impact\nto the IT infrastructure.\n\n186\n00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.570\nSo the first time we see\nthis particular change, or\n\n187\n00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.780\nthe first time somebody has asked for\nsomething, we're going to go through\n\n188\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.720\na change process which looks at\nthe risk to the IT infrastructure.\n\n189\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.940\nAnd then the second time we see that,\nchange management may turn around and say,\n\n190\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.650\nI don't need to see that type of change\nanymore, I'm really not interested in it.\n\n191\n00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.137\nIt's got an acceptable level of change, so\n\n192\n00:11:35.137 --> 00:11:38.711\ntherefore I'm gonna let request\nfulfillment deal with that.\n\n193\n00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:44.527\nI'm gonna go back to this laptop again,\nand if I ask for a new laptop, the first\n\n194\n00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:49.902\ntime I ask for a new laptop, I expect\nif it's a brand new model of laptop,\n\n195\n00:11:49.902 --> 00:11:55.368\nI expect change management to be involved\nbecause I expect them to do a risk\n\n196\n00:11:55.368 --> 00:12:01.960\nevaluation on whether that laptop is\nproviding a danger to the infrastructure.\n\n197\n00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.370\nIs that laptop going to cause\nimpact to the infrastructure\n\n198\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.680\nin a negative way, okay.\n\n199\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.585\nSo the first time that happens then,\n\n200\n00:12:09.585 --> 00:12:13.260\nI'm expecting change\nmanagement to get involved.\n\n201\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.490\nBut then the next time somebody ask for\nthat exact model of laptop, well,\n\n202\n00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.530\nthe risk evaluation's been done, and\nit has an acceptable level of risk.\n\n203\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.285\nSo we pre-authorize it, it is now\nwhat we call a standard change, and\n\n204\n00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:31.050\nwe allow request fulfillment to manage it.\n\n205\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:35.193\nNow, that doesn't override\nthe authorization considerations in there,\n\n206\n00:12:35.193 --> 00:12:38.502\nbecause I still need to have\nauthorization for that laptop.\n\n207\n00:12:38.502 --> 00:12:41.335\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; But it's still an expenditure, but\n\n208\n00:12:41.335 --> 00:12:46.340\nwhat I'm talking about here is\nthe impact to the IT infrastructure.\n\n209\n00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.660\nThat's what I'm referring to.\n\n210\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.612\nSo let's take a look then at these bullet\npoints on the right-hand side, then.\n\n211\n00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:57.010\nAnd we look at the principles and\nthe concepts of request fulfillment.\n\n212\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.980\nNow, if you look at some of\nthe wording on those bullet points,\n\n213\n00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:05.090\nyou see status tracking and\nprioritization and escalation and\n\n214\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.660\napprovals and closure and\nfulfillment activities.\n\n215\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.505\nYou know what, this process looks very\nsimilar to the incident management process\n\n216\n00:13:13.505 --> 00:13:15.485\nand the problem management process.\n\n217\n00:13:15.485 --> 00:13:18.515\nAnd that's one of\nthe reasons why we do them,\n\n218\n00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:23.325\nsorry that's one of the reasons why\nit may be combined with incident\n\n219\n00:13:23.325 --> 00:13:27.025\nmanagement because if you look at some\nof the steps they look fairly similar.\n\n220\n00:13:28.195 --> 00:13:30.315\nBut let's think about this logically.\n\n221\n00:13:30.315 --> 00:13:32.185\nAll request have to be prioritized.\n\n222\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.410\nIf I ask for a new laptop, should I get\nit tomorrow or should I get it next week?\n\n223\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.540\nWell, it depends on the impact.\n\n224\n00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.891\nIf I don't have a laptop and\nit's causing an impact to the business,\n\n225\n00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:48.077\nthen I probably need it tomorrow.\n\n226\n00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:51.477\nBut if actually, I have a laptop\nalready and I just want to upgrade,\n\n227\n00:13:51.477 --> 00:13:55.420\nthen it could probably wait until\nnext week or even next month.\n\n228\n00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.380\nSo there has to be prioritization,\nbut there also has to be,\n\n229\n00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.030\nguess what, it'll always links\nto the service level agreement.\n\n230\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:10.940\nWe have to have targets defined in\nour service level agreement for\n\n231\n00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.991\nrequest fulfillment.\n\n232\n00:14:11.991 --> 00:14:16.320\nAnd those targets should not only\ninclude prioritization table,\n\n233\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.560\nthe same type of prioritization table\nthat appears in incident management and\n\n234\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.530\nappears in problem management, but\nit should also include the time scales.\n\n235\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:32.010\nNow the time scales aren't just about\nfulfilling a request, the time scales\n\n236\n00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:37.570\nare also about rejecting a request too,\nbecause sometimes we say no.\n\n237\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.317\nSo we still have to come back within\nan agreed amount of time to say no, okay.\n\n238\n00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.607\nWe don't just say yes all the time\nas we've already established, okay.\n\n239\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.910\nSo again, very similar to the other\nprocesses that we looked at within service\n\n240\n00:14:53.910 --> 00:15:00.460\noperation, I am expecting to\nsee models for these processes.\n\n241\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.430\nOkay, we'll give you an example of\na process, and there will be one coming\n\n242\n00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:10.380\nup in the next module in a couple\nof slides time in your notes.\n\n243\n00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.990\nBut, it's up to you to decide what\nyour request process looks like and\n\n244\n00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.140\nwhat the models look like because every\nsingle organization has a different\n\n245\n00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.919\nset of requests.\n\n246\n00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.470\nWhat we will tell you is,\nthat really you should try and\n\n247\n00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.320\nutilize self help systems\nwherever you can.\n\n248\n00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.988\nSo or you should for\nthe sake of efficiency and effectiveness,\n\n249\n00:15:32.988 --> 00:15:36.069\nutilize those apps on your cell phone, or\n\n250\n00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:39.695\nthe internet linking to\nthat call login system.\n\n251\n00:15:39.695 --> 00:15:42.615\nAnd you know what,\nthat link in to the call login\n\n252\n00:15:42.615 --> 00:15:47.437\nsystem can also be used to allow users to\ntrack the status of their own request.\n\n253\n00:15:47.437 --> 00:15:52.055\nAnd it's not just about the service desk\nmanaging those requests, it's also about\n\n254\n00:15:52.055 --> 00:15:56.107\nusers being able to track what's\nhappening with their requests, okay.\n\n255\n00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.380\nSo as we've already said, Very,\nvery similar to incident management.\n\n256\n00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.915\nWe prioritize requests,\n\n257\n00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:08.120\nand I expect to see prioritization\ntable in our service level agreement.\n\n258\n00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.039\nWe can escalate requests, if I feel I'm\nnot getting my laptop quick enough,\n\n259\n00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:17.749\nthen I'm gonna want to escalate that,\ncuz I'm a very impatient person.\n\n260\n00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:18.755\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n261\n00:16:18.755 --> 00:16:21.123\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI'm used to having that long cape and\n\n262\n00:16:21.123 --> 00:16:24.333\nthat magic wand that I can just wave and\nhave it there again.\n\n263\n00:16:24.333 --> 00:16:28.364\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm an impatient person, so\n\n264\n00:16:28.364 --> 00:16:30.034\nI need to escalate.\n\n265\n00:16:30.034 --> 00:16:32.900\nWe don't just escalate if things\naren't happening quick enough.\n\n266\n00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.040\nWe might escalate if we don't\nget the result that we want.\n\n267\n00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.284\nLet's just say I opted for\na particular model of laptop,\n\n268\n00:16:39.284 --> 00:16:41.455\nbecause I really, really like that.\n\n269\n00:16:41.455 --> 00:16:45.216\nAnd some people have an affiliation\nwith a certain brand, and\n\n270\n00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:50.890\nif that's the brand I wanted, and you came\nto me and said, you're not having that.\n\n271\n00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:54.778\nWell, there may be a business\njustification for me asking for\n\n272\n00:16:54.778 --> 00:16:56.959\nthat particular device or model.\n\n273\n00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:01.894\nIn which case, then, I may need to\nescalate that, because it's not in\n\n274\n00:17:01.894 --> 00:17:07.674\nthe request fulfillment policies to grant\nme that, but I may have justification.\n\n275\n00:17:07.674 --> 00:17:12.131\nSo there needs to be some form of\nescalation, and there needs to be some\n\n276\n00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:16.513\nform of authorization,\nsometimes by way of financial approval, or\n\n277\n00:17:16.513 --> 00:17:20.615\nmaybe HR approval, or\nmaybe just business requirements.\n\n278\n00:17:20.615 --> 00:17:26.020\nIf I need a particular device\nbecause it's going to facilitate\n\n279\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:31.320\nme achieving my business outcome, well,\nthat's the definition of a service.\n\n280\n00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.283\nAnd therefore that's exactly\nwhat I want to achieve, so\n\n281\n00:17:35.283 --> 00:17:37.438\nyou should allow me to do that.\n\n282\n00:17:37.438 --> 00:17:41.817\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, before you move on here,\non the previous slide that we looked at,\n\n283\n00:17:41.817 --> 00:17:45.757\nthere was an unusual word that I saw\nright here, under request tracking.\n\n284\n00:17:45.757 --> 00:17:49.280\nWe'll actually take a look at\nthe whole thing here for a moment.\n\n285\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.355\nWhat is the difference, I see this\nunusual word that says rejected and\n\n286\n00:17:54.355 --> 00:17:59.612\ncanceled, you've gotta explain\nthe differences between that for me.\n\n287\n00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:02.450\nIf I have a request in, and\nit's rejected or it's canceled,\n\n288\n00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.017\nwhat is the real difference here, in\nthe way that you're taking a look at it?\n\n289\n00:18:06.017 --> 00:18:09.403\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you have a request in and\nI reject it, and I say,\n\n290\n00:18:09.403 --> 00:18:14.590\nno, I'm sorry, but I just don't authorize\nthat at all, then that's rejected.\n\n291\n00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.712\nBut you might submit a request,\nand then you may cancel it, so\n\n292\n00:18:18.712 --> 00:18:20.626\nyou might change your mind.\n\n293\n00:18:20.626 --> 00:18:23.475\nMaybe you've decided you wanted something\nbigger and better, [LAUGH] it can happen.\n\n294\n00:18:23.475 --> 00:18:28.693\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, thank you.\n\n295\n00:18:28.693 --> 00:18:34.584\n&gt;&gt; So let's just carry on then with those\nbasic concepts of request fulfillment.\n\n296\n00:18:34.584 --> 00:18:39.053\nAnd we talk about automation in there,\nnow, I mentioned that event management is\n\n297\n00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:41.728\nthe only process that\ncould be fully automated.\n\n298\n00:18:41.728 --> 00:18:47.080\nWell, we probably are going to have some\nsort of automation in request fulfillment.\n\n299\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:54.028\nThen we might have automation in ways of\nanswering the, can you tell me something.\n\n300\n00:18:54.028 --> 00:18:58.212\nIf I was a user,\nhow impressed would I feel as a user, and\n\n301\n00:18:58.212 --> 00:19:02.039\nhow much value would I feel,\nif I was able to get onto\n\n302\n00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:06.990\nthat self-help interface and\nI was able to type in something.\n\n303\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.378\nSome little web search engine that said,\nhow do I do this?\n\n304\n00:19:10.378 --> 00:19:13.921\nAnd it took me to all of the knowledge\nmanagement documents that told me how\n\n305\n00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:14.500\nto do that.\n\n306\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.010\nIt would save me having to\ncall up the service desk,\n\n307\n00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:22.130\nand save me having to raise a request,\nand save me having to perhaps\n\n308\n00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.500\nwait in a call queuing system to\nbe able to get to that answer.\n\n309\n00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.010\nIt might be just a very,\nvery simple answer as well.\n\n310\n00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.116\nSo we talk about automation,\nbut it really does work,\n\n311\n00:19:34.116 --> 00:19:36.945\nwe can also automate approvals as well.\n\n312\n00:19:38.598 --> 00:19:43.757\nYou see, it's not unusual for a call\ncenter manager, now I don't say that it is\n\n313\n00:19:43.757 --> 00:19:49.365\nusual, I just said it's not unusual, for\na call center manager to pre-authorize.\n\n314\n00:19:49.365 --> 00:19:53.446\nIt's perfectly acceptable for\na call center manager to say,\n\n315\n00:19:53.446 --> 00:19:58.715\nI allow any of my team to spend,\nlet's say, up to 500 pounds, or $700.\n\n316\n00:19:58.715 --> 00:20:01.720\nAnd anything above that,\nthen I want to know about.\n\n317\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.020\nNot unusual for that at all, so we may\nchose to automate, then, that request.\n\n318\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.923\nDoes it really need to be seen by\na service desk analyst, no, of course not.\n\n319\n00:20:12.923 --> 00:20:17.522\nIf the call center manager has logged\nonto the call login system, and\n\n320\n00:20:17.522 --> 00:20:20.080\nhas pre-authorized up to $700.\n\n321\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:26.257\nWell, then if I log in, then, and ask for\na new laptop and it's less than $700,\n\n322\n00:20:26.257 --> 00:20:31.129\nit's straight away going to go\ntowards the fulfillment team, for\n\n323\n00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:34.885\nthem to fulfill that request,\nso we can automate.\n\n324\n00:20:34.885 --> 00:20:38.265\nNow, obviously we can't automate\nthe fulfilling of the actual laptop,\n\n325\n00:20:38.265 --> 00:20:41.230\nbecause let's face it,\nwe still gotta get the laptop in.\n\n326\n00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.602\nIt's still got to have a build put on it,\nand\n\n327\n00:20:43.602 --> 00:20:47.455\nI know that we're into drone\ntechnology and everything nowadays, but\n\n328\n00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.105\nit's not going to just\nsuddenly land on my desk.\n\n329\n00:20:50.105 --> 00:20:53.289\nNot yet, give it a couple of years and\nthen it may well happen.\n\n330\n00:20:53.289 --> 00:20:58.945\n[LAUGH] We may have to forward some\nrequests to specialist groups.\n\n331\n00:20:58.945 --> 00:21:01.350\nAnd I talk about the example\nI just gave you,\n\n332\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.700\ndesktop support groups that will\nactually perform builds on the laptops.\n\n333\n00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.817\nBut also specialist groups in terms of\nknowledge as well, because, you know what.\n\n334\n00:21:09.817 --> 00:21:14.722\nI don't expect the service desk analyst to\nhave access to all of the knowledge, or\n\n335\n00:21:14.722 --> 00:21:19.010\nto be able to answer some of\nthe more complicated questions.\n\n336\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:23.510\nCertainly, if I was on a service desk,\nand you called me and\n\n337\n00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:29.363\nasked me how to add a new I'd pretty\nmuch be at a loss, to be honest.\n\n338\n00:21:29.363 --> 00:21:33.456\nOne thing that I do want to point out,\nand this applies to incident management,\n\n339\n00:21:33.456 --> 00:21:37.690\nas well as request fulfillment, is the\nservice desk has taken ownership of this.\n\n340\n00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.850\nSo the service desk will\nclose the requests,\n\n341\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.370\non condition that the user is\nsatisfied with that request.\n\n342\n00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:52.750\nThe only exception to this is\ncancellations, as we just mentioned.\n\n343\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:59.520\nAnd also requests that have been\ngenerated through the self-help facility,\n\n344\n00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.920\nand that have been responded to\nthrough the self help facility.\n\n345\n00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.954\nIn other words, I've logged\nonto the self-help facility and\n\n346\n00:22:06.954 --> 00:22:09.985\nI've typed in my question,\nhow do I do this?\n\n347\n00:22:09.985 --> 00:22:14.500\nIt's taken me to an article, and\nactually, I've found my answer.\n\n348\n00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.324\nIn that case, though, I'm still expecting\nto see some sort of response from this\n\n349\n00:22:18.324 --> 00:22:22.420\nself-help facility that says,\ndid you get the answer to your question?\n\n350\n00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:29.440\nThat goes into that, usage can be\nmeasured there, why do I need to do that?\n\n351\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.910\nWell, I want to see that information\nbecause I want to be able to identify\n\n352\n00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:33.964\ntraining needs.\n\n353\n00:22:33.964 --> 00:22:39.810\nCuz if five people have accessed\nthat particular help document,\n\n354\n00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:44.280\nif five people have gone in within\nthe last, say, two or three hours and\n\n355\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.670\nasked how to add a cost center into,\nor cost type, into SAP.\n\n356\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.874\nThen maybe we've got a training\nrequirement in the user community,\n\n357\n00:22:53.874 --> 00:22:58.235\nso I still want access to that,\nI still want to perform trend analysis.\n\n358\n00:22:58.235 --> 00:23:00.665\nBecause it does identify training needs,\nand\n\n359\n00:23:00.665 --> 00:23:03.540\nit identifies where we're\ngetting common requests.\n\n360\n00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.913\nAnd maybe it'll help us be more\nefficient in the future, so\n\n361\n00:23:06.913 --> 00:23:10.490\nthat's part of continual\nservice improvement.\n\n362\n00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:15.070\nNow, in the next section,\nwhat I'd like us to do is,\n\n363\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.180\nwe'll go over the request\nfulfillment process floor.\n\n364\n00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.810\nAnd in that particular section,\nwe will look at the actual process,\n\n365\n00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:29.000\nhow we may choose to define our models,\nand the authorization process too.\n\n366\n00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.776\nBut for the moment, what I would like\nyou to do is to refer to your notes and\n\n367\n00:23:34.776 --> 00:23:40.203\ntake a look at the exercises that\nare in your downloaded materials.\n\n368\n00:23:40.203 --> 00:23:45.894\nAnd just review the policies and\nthe guidelines for request fulfillment.\n\n369\n00:23:45.894 --> 00:23:47.770\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well, thank you again.\n\n370\n00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.730\nWhen taking a look at the idea\nof request fulfillment,\n\n371\n00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.330\nremember that this is not\nsaying yes to everything.\n\n372\n00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.400\nIt is about how we handle\nthese requests that come in.\n\n373\n00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.607\nTake a look at the examples and\nthe material that's provided for you.\n\n374\n00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:05.475\nThat will help to cement these concepts\ninto your mind as you are continuing\n\n375\n00:24:05.475 --> 00:24:06.797\nin all things ITIL.\n\n376\n00:24:06.797 --> 00:24:09.826\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode, then.\n\n377\n00:24:09.826 --> 00:24:13.176\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n378\n00:24:13.176 --> 00:24:14.676\n&gt;&gt; And I've been Dumbledore.\n\n379\n00:24:14.676 --> 00:24:18.901\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore ITIL service operation shows.\n\n380\n00:24:18.901 --> 00:24:26.277\n[MUSIC]\n\n381\n00:24:26.277 --> 00:24:28.851\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Jo starts from the beginning with understanding the “triggers” and takes us through the closure.  She emphasizes the ideal of the framework as being the important part of the process flow rather than the individual components.  The goal is to make a process flow that meet your organizational needs and provides a better value to you, says Jo.",

00:00:08.238\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:11.633\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.742\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.742 --> 00:00:19.670\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.762\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\nwe're taking a look at request for\n\n8\n00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:23.913\nfulfillment process flow.\n\n9\n00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:30.878\nAnd here to help us, again, is gonna be\nour superhero wonder on ITIL, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:32.980\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.830\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n12\n00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.860\nThank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.570\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.940\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great, Jo.\n\n15\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.808\nAs we continue on, we've already talked\nabout request fulfillment a little bit.\n\n16\n00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:44.140\nMade sure that we understand that\nit's not all about granting wishes,\n\n17\n00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.749\nwhich is actually a very important point\nI guess, as what you wanted to make,\n\n18\n00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:49.710\nat least that's what I think.\n\n19\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.390\nSo, where are we going in this process\nflow and what are taking a look at?\n\n20\n00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nright now in this particular session,\n\n21\n00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.600\nwe're going to look at a sample,\nprocess flow for request fulfillment.\n\n22\n00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.470\nAs you've already said,\n\n23\n00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.420\nit's not just about granting wishes,\nit is about analyzing requests.\n\n24\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.006\nAnd don't forget from the last section,\nwe looked at the factor, some request,\n\n25\n00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:12.276\ncan I have something?\n\n26\n00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:12.791\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n27\n00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:14.947\n&gt;&gt; Another request, so\ncan you tell me something?\n\n28\n00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:18.085\nNow, you'd like to think that\nmaybe one may be a quicker or\n\n29\n00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:20.273\nmore efficient process than the other.\n\n30\n00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:24.097\nSo for instance, the can you tell\nme something, you might think that,\n\n31\n00:01:24.097 --> 00:01:28.242\nthat could be resolved or fulfilled\nquicker than the, can I have something,\n\n32\n00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:30.371\nbut that's not necessarily the case.\n\n33\n00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:35.360\nWhat if the service desk analyst has to go\naway and find that information for you?\n\n34\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.990\nSometimes, that could not be resolved or\n\n35\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.300\nanswered as quickly as the,\ncan I have something?\n\n36\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.480\nSo we're going to be looking\nat the process flow.\n\n37\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.096\nWe're going to be looking at the\ncharacteristics of the process flow, and\n\n38\n00:01:47.096 --> 00:01:48.812\nthen the outputs of\nthe process in this session.\n\n39\n00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:53.435\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, sounds like we\nare now ready to get started.\n\n40\n00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:57.580\nSo, what is the first step in our process\nthat we are gonna take a look at?\n\n41\n00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the first slide\nthat you've got in your notes,\n\n42\n00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.700\nin front of you now, actually\nshows you the entire process flow.\n\n43\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.942\nNow as you can see, [LAUGH] even\nwith perfect 20/20 vision, [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:14.800\nthere is absolutely no way that you could\nlook at this without a magnifying glass.\n\n45\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.210\nSo we're going to break it down, and\n\n46\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.890\nwe are going to take a look over the next\nfew slides at the actual process itself.\n\n47\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.449\nNow remember, as with every other process\nin ITIL, this is just a framework,\n\n48\n00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:27.912\nthis is just an example.\n\n49\n00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:33.685\nAnd it's up to you to create a process\nthat meets your organization's needs,\n\n50\n00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:37.980\nand that aligns itself with\nthe organization, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.940\nUltimately, it's all\nabout delivering value.\n\n52\n00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.020\nSo in the last section,\n\n53\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.510\nwe looked at the various ways\nthat we can receive a request.\n\n54\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.070\nNow, we call them a trigger.\n\n55\n00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.330\nIt's something that\nstarts off the process.\n\n56\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.570\nThe process doesn't just happen by itself,\nsomething has to start it.\n\n57\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.010\nSo whether in the top of the screen there,\nthe top of that process,\n\n58\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.659\nyou can see the different\ntriggers that they have.\n\n59\n00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:05.770\nNow, I mentioned other triggers as well,\nthings like the app, for instance.\n\n60\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.760\nSome service management software actually\nhas an app for cellphones nowadays.\n\n61\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.870\nSo a request could come in from that app.\n\n62\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.751\nBut it could come in and\n\n63\n00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:15.730\nwhat we've considered to be\na traditional way like a phone call, or\n\n64\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.860\nmaybe even a visit to the service desk,\nor an email, or a request for change.\n\n65\n00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.885\nBecause, don't forget\nfrom the last session,\n\n66\n00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:27.815\nwe analyzed the fact that a request\ncould be a standard change.\n\n67\n00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:32.297\nSomething that change management has\nseen before and said, you know what,\n\n68\n00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:36.140\nwe don't need to go\nthrough change management.\n\n69\n00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.634\nAnd if that's the case, there could be\npossibilities of somebody raising a change\n\n70\n00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:47.770\nrequest, and then realizing that actually,\nwe don't need a full-blown change request.\n\n71\n00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.646\nIt doesn't need to go through evaluation,\netc.\n\n72\n00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:55.160\nAnd in that case, then, we can just\nraise a request fulfillment record.\n\n73\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.080\nSo, in terms of this service request,\n\n74\n00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.840\nthen, as we like to call these records,\nokay?\n\n75\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.020\nThey can come in a variety of ways, and\n\n76\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.160\nthis, the top layer there,\nthey are the triggers,\n\n77\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.290\nsome of the triggers that could stop\nthe request fulfillment process.\n\n78\n00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.279\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, before you move on, this\nquestion just popped in my mind as I start\n\n79\n00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:17.656\nseeing all of these different\ntriggers that are up there.\n\n80\n00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:23.470\nIs this a place for an organization\nto also just to find those triggers?\n\n81\n00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.750\nLet's say that we chose\nnot to do all of them.\n\n82\n00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.030\nIs that okay, and would we define that\ninside the service level agreement?\n\n83\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.519\nSo let's say, I only wanted to do two or\nthree of them, instead of all these or,\n\n84\n00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.333\nis this a place I need to\nactually be more general,\n\n85\n00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:39.687\nin terms of accepting the numbers\nof requests that come in?\n\n86\n00:04:39.687 --> 00:04:43.019\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwe are best practice framework in ITIL, so\n\n87\n00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:45.766\nlet's just think about this for a moment.\n\n88\n00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:50.327\nLet's say you wanted to eliminate\none of those, let's pick one,\n\n89\n00:04:50.327 --> 00:04:53.510\nlet's pick say,\nvisits to the service desk.\n\n90\n00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n91\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.965\nbecause we don't wanna encourage\npeople to visit the service desk.\n\n92\n00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:57.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Because obviously,\n\n93\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.440\nthey're busy with phone calls,\nemails, etc., so\n\n94\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.170\nwe don't like to encourage say\nlive visits to the service desk.\n\n95\n00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.670\nAnd if that's the case\nin your organization,\n\n96\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.340\nyou might choose to not take requests\nvia visit to the service desk.\n\n97\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.440\nSo then what would you do if\nsomebody came to the service desk?\n\n98\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good question.\n\n99\n00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.960\nI don't know if there's a way for\nus to politely tell them to go away.\n\n100\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.062\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n101\n00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:27.050\nthat's never gonna be best practice,\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.211\n[LAUGH] Unfortunately, there is no\npolite way to tell somebody to go away.\n\n103\n00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:32.026\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n104\n00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:33.494\nit would never be\nconsidered best practice.\n\n105\n00:05:33.494 --> 00:05:34.470\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n106\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.660\n&gt;&gt; So, we have to accept that\nno matter what in the SLA,\n\n107\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.650\nwe can get requested from\na variety of sources.\n\n108\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.310\nNow, that's not to say though,\n\n109\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.660\nthat we can't agree to handle those\ntype of requests in a certain way.\n\n110\n00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.590\nSo, we might discourage people\nfrom coming to the service desk.\n\n111\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.600\nBut then when they do,\nbecause somebody will, okay,\n\n112\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.510\nwe don't just tell them to go away.\n\n113\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.470\nWhat we'll do is we'll say, well,\nokay then, we need to log this.\n\n114\n00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.560\nAnd it needs to be logged as a request.\n\n115\n00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.500\nSo if you would like to hand me your\ncellphone, I can do this through the app,\n\n116\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.430\nor if you like to login to your email\nthen you can do it through your email.\n\n117\n00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.850\nAnd so\nwhat we can facilitate login that request.\n\n118\n00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.680\nBut we do it just here,\nright now, on the service desk.\n\n119\n00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.376\nAnd in that way,\nwhat we're doing is reinforcing to\n\n120\n00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:29.060\nthe visitor that the requester\nhas to be logged.\n\n121\n00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.990\nYou can't bypass the process just\nby coming to the service desk.\n\n122\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.730\nBut at the same time, w are not\nactively bypassing the process too.\n\n123\n00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.570\nAnd we are enforcing, or reenforcing,\n\n124\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.680\nour sort of ethic of no\nvisitors to the service desk.\n\n125\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.451\nSo, no,\nwe don't just tell somebody to go away.\n\n126\n00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:50.071\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n127\n00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:54.462\nit does make sense in that way of thinking\nabout it, is having them in place that\n\n128\n00:06:54.462 --> 00:06:59.005\nidea that even an exception does have,\nI don't know if that's the proper term.\n\n129\n00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:02.813\nIf something unusual happens,\nwhere we are getting the request instead\n\n130\n00:07:02.813 --> 00:07:07.123\nof the official channel, that we show them\nhow to take it to the official channel,\n\n131\n00:07:07.123 --> 00:07:09.622\nand that provides\nthe training that they need,\n\n132\n00:07:09.622 --> 00:07:12.670\nbut also keeps us in line\nwith that process as well.\n\n133\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.445\nSo it's a better way to think about it\nthan, instead, what I was thinking about\n\n134\n00:07:15.445 --> 00:07:17.730\nlike, I really don't want people\ncoming into service desk,\n\n135\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.835\nlet me just eliminate that possibility\nhere, by making sure we agree to it.\n\n136\n00:07:21.835 --> 00:07:22.899\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's face it.\n\n137\n00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:26.700\nTechnology changes all the time,\nit really does.\n\n138\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.642\nNow that we're, only a couple of\nyears ago, there was a new invention,\n\n139\n00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:36.503\nnew to technology, that allowed\nyour desktop, your emails, etc.,\n\n140\n00:07:36.503 --> 00:07:39.907\nto be displayed on the inside\nof your spectacles,\n\n141\n00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:42.195\nfrom the inside of your glasses.\n\n142\n00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:47.370\nNow, I don't know what happened to that\ntechnology, but we had to look for\n\n143\n00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.561\nways to incorporate that technology\ninto Some of the service\n\n144\n00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:56.325\nmanagement tools that there are out there,\nbecause if we have a way,\n\n145\n00:07:56.325 --> 00:08:00.170\nand I mean let's face it,\nlook at cars nowadays.\n\n146\n00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.790\nMost cars have got some form\nof Internet connection now.\n\n147\n00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.350\nThey may have a heads up display for\ninstance.\n\n148\n00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:10.150\nSo you may choose to use your\nvoice activation in your car or\n\n149\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.910\non your cell cellphone to log a request.\n\n150\n00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.870\nSo we have to work with service\nmanagement tools to ensure that\n\n151\n00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.540\nany new technology is accommodated.\n\n152\n00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.820\nAnd so, we cannot eliminate, and this is\nthe same for incident management, and\n\n153\n00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.290\nproblem management, etc.\n\n154\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.370\nWe cannot eliminate new technology,\nwe're in IT.\n\n155\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.020\nSo we can't just ignore it.\n\n156\n00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.510\nNow we'd like to think that we could\n\n157\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.430\nreduce the number of people coming to\nthe service desk on a personal visit, but\n\n158\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.250\nmaybe we could do something\nwith technology such as\n\n159\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.250\nset up a kiosk within the service desk\nthat people can go and actually visit.\n\n160\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.355\nOr maybe some form of\ninteractive pad on the wall in\n\n161\n00:08:48.355 --> 00:08:51.206\nthe entrance to the service desk.\n\n162\n00:08:51.206 --> 00:08:54.840\nSo technology,\nwell it moves very, very quickly,\n\n163\n00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.809\nand it means that we do have to make\nsure that keep pace with technology.\n\n164\n00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:03.100\nBut technology can also\nfacilitate this for us too.\n\n165\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.340\nAnd if the technology\nis sort of set up and\n\n166\n00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.080\nconfigured in an efficient way, it can\nreally help us with us, really help us.\n\n167\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n168\n00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.350\nSorry about the almost offshoot that\ntook us away from what we need to do.\n\n169\n00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.637\nWhat are we looking at next time?\n\n170\n00:09:19.637 --> 00:09:23.268\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the next step, then,\nis once we have this trigger, and no,\n\n171\n00:09:23.268 --> 00:09:25.630\nit's not an offshoot, trust me.\n\n172\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.760\nTechnology changes all the time.\n\n173\n00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.060\nThe first step in this process\nis really to ascertain\n\n174\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.050\nwhether it is genuinely a request.\n\n175\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.290\nAnd that sounds like a very bizarre\nquestion, because you think well,\n\n176\n00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.620\nis it really a service request?\n\n177\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.360\nWell if it's not a service request,\nwhat is it?\n\n178\n00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.840\nWell it could be an incident.\n\n179\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.770\nIt could be an interruption to service.\n\n180\n00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.090\nSo a request for access, for instance,\nor a request for password reset,\n\n181\n00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.000\nis a request for a password reset\nan incident or is it a request?\n\n182\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:01.446\nBecause you request your password to\nbe reset generally because you've\n\n183\n00:10:01.446 --> 00:10:08.010\nforgotten it, and if you've forgotten it,\nyou can't get into your services.\n\n184\n00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.570\nYou can't login to your account.\n\n185\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.770\nSo does that mean your\nservice is interrupted?\n\n186\n00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.330\nBecause yes it is,\nyour service is interrupted.\n\n187\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.990\nSo is that an incident, or is that\ngenuinely a request for a password reset?\n\n188\n00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.620\nWhat is it?\n\n189\n00:10:21.628 --> 00:10:27.350\nAnd then that leads us to the next point\nof, are we going to allow our users or\n\n190\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.160\nour service desk analyst\nto make that determination\n\n191\n00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.010\njust based on the wording that somebody's\nused when they call the service desk?\n\n192\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.290\nBecause if I rang the service desk, or\nI sent an email to the service desk and\n\n193\n00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.060\nsaid, could you please reset my password?\n\n194\n00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.250\nDo they log that as a request,\nbecause I'm asking for something?\n\n195\n00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.500\nOr if I send the email to\nthe service desk saying,\n\n196\n00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.320\nI can't get into my account because\nI've forgotten my password.\n\n197\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.140\nIs that an incident then,\n\n198\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.760\nbecause of the wording that I used in\nthat email or that telephone call?\n\n199\n00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.340\nSo we have to ensure consistency,\nbecause we have to have efficient and\n\n200\n00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.730\neffective processes and we have to\nbe able to measure those processes.\n\n201\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.800\nSo we have to have consistency.\n\n202\n00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.490\nAnd that consistency can't be\nbased just on the wording that\n\n203\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.260\nI choose to use when I\ncall a service desk.\n\n204\n00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:26.210\nSo we have to have policies in place\nthat will allow us to determine whether\n\n205\n00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:31.780\na password reset, as an example, is either\na request or whether it's an incident.\n\n206\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.220\nCuz ultimately service has been\ninterrupted but I'm asking for\n\n207\n00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.970\nmy password to be reset.\n\n208\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.530\nSo actually that's question seemed a\nlittle bit bizarre when you first look at\n\n209\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.300\nit, it's not really bizarre.\n\n210\n00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.840\nIt's something that drives us to\na policy decision that says, this is\n\n211\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:55.920\nhow in this organization we handle those\ntype of requests or incidents, either one.\n\n212\n00:11:57.426 --> 00:12:01.928\nSo then, once we've decided on that\npassword reset, how we gonna handle it,\n\n213\n00:12:01.928 --> 00:12:06.791\nis it through incident management or is\nthis through service request fulfillment?\n\n214\n00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:11.828\nThen we might choose to login\nunder request fulfillment or\n\n215\n00:12:11.828 --> 00:12:14.614\nwe log it as an incident, okay?\n\n216\n00:12:14.614 --> 00:12:19.210\nNow the next thing that\nhappens is a filter.\n\n217\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.350\nAnd that filter really is,\nis this a valid request yes or no, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.070\nIs it a valid request?\n\n219\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.681\nIs it something that,\nthat requester can ask for?\n\n220\n00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:37.613\nRemember I said to you, earlier on in\nthe last section that we looked at.\n\n221\n00:12:37.613 --> 00:12:42.640\nI asked you if you could explain to me\nhow I would add in a new cost type or\n\n222\n00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.502\ncost model or cost center into SAP, and\n\n223\n00:12:45.502 --> 00:12:50.660\nyou started to explain to me straight\naway, this is how we would do it.\n\n224\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.717\nI'm gonna find out the information,\n\n225\n00:12:52.717 --> 00:12:55.745\nbut what if I'm not supposed\nto have that information.\n\n226\n00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:56.406\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n227\n00:12:56.406 --> 00:13:01.145\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we have to ascertain whether\nit's a valid request straight away.\n\n228\n00:13:01.145 --> 00:13:05.601\nAnd then, once we've ascertained\nthat it's a valid request,\n\n229\n00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:09.736\nthen we will come down and\nwe will prioritize that request.\n\n230\n00:13:09.736 --> 00:13:15.090\nNow we prioritized incidents and\nwe prioritize problems.\n\n231\n00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.680\nSo I wonder if you can\nremember what the two\n\n232\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.660\nelements were that we used\nto determine prioritization?\n\n233\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:29.410\n&gt;&gt; In prioritization we use impact and\nurgency.\n\n234\n00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.330\n&gt;&gt; Well done.\n\n235\n00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:36.070\nYeah, perfect or spot on as I was saying,\nyup absolutely right.\n\n236\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.960\nAnd we do exactly the same\nwith request fulfillment,\n\n237\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:44.050\nwe will prioritize based on impact\nto the organization and priority.\n\n238\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.240\nNow I know I touched on the subject in\nthe previous session, but the impact to\n\n239\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.610\nthe organization really is, what will the\nimpact be to the business of this request\n\n240\n00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:58.520\nnot being fulfilled, or\nnot being managed in a timely manner?\n\n241\n00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.450\nAnd then the urgency of course\nis how quickly do we want it?\n\n242\n00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.720\nAnd of course,\nthe definition of each individual\n\n243\n00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.430\npriority will be found in\nthe service level agreement.\n\n244\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.700\nThat's what we've agreed\nwith our customers.\n\n245\n00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.301\nBut not only will a definition\nbe found in the SLA also a time\n\n246\n00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:25.580\nscale targets will be found in\nthe SLA too for fulfillment or\n\n247\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.620\nrejection of that request,\ncuz again, we don't always fulfill.\n\n248\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.230\nSo at this point in time\nonce we've prioritized,\n\n249\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.920\nwe make sure that we have got\nthe relevant authorization.\n\n250\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.959\nNow it's split into two here, but it\nactually can be split into more than this.\n\n251\n00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.010\nSplit in two, I'm gonna start with\nfinancial management there,because I\n\n252\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:53.710\nalready mentioned that request fulfillment\nin the previous session is about\n\n253\n00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:58.610\naccessing standard components\nof a service such as,\n\n254\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.420\nsay a new laptop or a printer,\na standard component.\n\n255\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.990\nNow we will need financial\nauthorization for that.\n\n256\n00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:11.120\nI also mentioned in a previous session\nthat it is possible that, that financial\n\n257\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.800\ninformation, or sorry, that financial\nauthorization can be given in advance.\n\n258\n00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.835\nSo the call center manager could\nauthorize a prebudget of say,\n\n259\n00:15:21.835 --> 00:15:26.588\n$700 I think was the example\nI used in the last session.\n\n260\n00:15:26.588 --> 00:15:31.892\nSo they could say, well look,\nanybody in my team could spend\n\n261\n00:15:31.892 --> 00:15:37.305\nup to $700 without me having\nto authorize it separately.\n\n262\n00:15:37.305 --> 00:15:42.109\nAnd that would be something\nthat we would input into our\n\n263\n00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:45.770\nmodels within the request process flow.\n\n264\n00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.101\nAnother authorization that it\nmentions there is access management.\n\n265\n00:15:50.101 --> 00:15:54.733\nBecause another typical request\nthat we get in is the request for\n\n266\n00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:57.410\naccess to a certain service, okay.\n\n267\n00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.020\nAnd, again, that would have to\ngo through access management,\n\n268\n00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.190\nwhich is another process we will\nbe covering in a different module.\n\n269\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.895\nOr it will also have to go,\nperhaps, to IT security management,\n\n270\n00:16:10.895 --> 00:16:14.754\nwhich is a process to be\nfound in ITIL service design.\n\n271\n00:16:14.754 --> 00:16:21.150\nAnd IT security management will\nset the policies for access.\n\n272\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.272\nWho can have access to\nwhat particular service?\n\n273\n00:16:24.272 --> 00:16:29.310\nRemember that example that I gave you\nabout me asking for information for SAP.\n\n274\n00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.637\nIf I'm not allowed to have access to SAP,\n\n275\n00:16:31.637 --> 00:16:35.236\nshould I be allowed to have access\nto the information, as well?\n\n276\n00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:35.986\nNo, no.\n\n277\n00:16:35.986 --> 00:16:40.078\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so\nif I call the service desk and asked for\n\n278\n00:16:40.078 --> 00:16:43.050\naccess to SAP, then I should be denied.\n\n279\n00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.571\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n280\n00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:44.877\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n281\n00:16:44.877 --> 00:16:50.026\nSo this is what happens then at the start\nof the request fulfillment process flow.\n\n282\n00:16:50.026 --> 00:16:54.911\nAnd the next slide really just\nreinforces everything that I have\n\n283\n00:16:54.911 --> 00:16:59.983\nmentioned about prioritization and\nalso about categorization.\n\n284\n00:16:59.983 --> 00:17:04.555\nAnd, again, we'd use, because we're\nlogging in the same management tool as\n\n285\n00:17:04.555 --> 00:17:07.354\nincident and\nproblem management, we're going\n\n286\n00:17:07.354 --> 00:17:12.510\nto use the same type of categorization as\nwe do for incident and problem management.\n\n287\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.069\nJust bearing in mind\nthat these are requests.\n\n288\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.830\nSo they could be functional requests,\nthey could be standard changes.\n\n289\n00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.900\nSo we could choose to categorize by type,\n\n290\n00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.560\nwhich is something that we wouldn't\nfind in incident and problem management.\n\n291\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.490\nSo let's just assume that in the last\nstage on the previous process flow was\n\n292\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.400\nrequest an authorization.\n\n293\n00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.300\nLet's just assume, then, that\nauthorization has either been given or\n\n294\n00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.050\nit's been denied.\n\n295\n00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.230\nAnd if it's been denied,\n\n296\n00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.750\nthen we go back to the requester\nto inform them of the decision.\n\n297\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:51.130\nIf it's been authorized, then we review\nthe request just to make sure that we\n\n298\n00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:55.460\nare giving that person, that requester,\n\n299\n00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.899\nthe right information, or that we're\ngiving them the right component.\n\n300\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.460\nAnd at this point in time,\nthat's when we route the request\n\n301\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.310\nto the person who's actually\ngoing to fulfill the request.\n\n302\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:14.040\nSo we route it to, say, the second\nlevel support team, or maybe our\n\n303\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.350\ndesktop support guys, because they're\ngoing to deliver that brand new laptop.\n\n304\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.500\nAnd we may need to escalate.\n\n305\n00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.897\nWe'd need to escalate functionally\nto another support team.\n\n306\n00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:30.351\nOr we may need to escalate hierarchically,\nfor instance,\n\n307\n00:18:30.351 --> 00:18:33.387\nif we need something expedited, okay.\n\n308\n00:18:33.387 --> 00:18:36.240\nAnd, of course, escalation,\nI use those two words,\n\n309\n00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.600\nthose two exact same words,\nin incident management, as well.\n\n310\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.210\nSo now we need to consider, then,\n\n311\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.840\nonce it's been given to the relevant\nteam to fulfill the request,\n\n312\n00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:53.070\nwe need to consider whether any\nconfiguration items have been impacted.\n\n313\n00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.030\nNow, if you remember from incident and\n\n314\n00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:02.050\nfrom problem management, I told you\nthat this configuration management\n\n315\n00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:06.720\ndatabase was the foundation to\nall of our other processes.\n\n316\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.870\nBut the configuration management system,\nand the configuration management system\n\n317\n00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:16.610\ndatabase, is needed to\nprovide accurate and\n\n318\n00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.530\nreliable information to support\nall of those other processes.\n\n319\n00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.850\nSo the one thing that we have to make\nsure that we do when we're fulfilling any\n\n320\n00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:31.010\nrequest is, if we make a change or\nwe update any CI information,\n\n321\n00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:36.200\nthen it has to be reflected in\nthe configuration management system.\n\n322\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.900\nSo if I'm giving you a new laptop, which\nI may well do because you've asked for\n\n323\n00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.570\nit and it's gonna cost less than $700, so\nI'm gonna give you a new one, well, I need\n\n324\n00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.700\nto make sure that I update the information\nin our configuration management system.\n\n325\n00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.530\nSo that if you get a problem or you have\nan incident with that laptop at any point\n\n326\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.390\nin time,\nwhen you call the service desk and\n\n327\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.860\nyou give them your name, then they've\nimmediately got all of the relevant\n\n328\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.410\ninformation right in front of them\nin that service management system.\n\n329\n00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.680\nIt also helps with change management, too,\n\n330\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:15.280\nbecause if I want to swap out a router\nin this particular room here,\n\n331\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.305\nI need to know who is using\nwhat equipment on that router.\n\n332\n00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:23.010\nAnd I have to have that\naccurate information, okay.\n\n333\n00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.800\nSo at this point in time, then,\n\n334\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.650\nwe ascertain whether any\nCIs are being impacted.\n\n335\n00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.200\nAnd if there isn't any CIs impacted,\nthen we fulfill the request and\n\n336\n00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.000\nwe let the requester know\nthat it's been fulfilled.\n\n337\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.020\nWell, they usually see.\n\n338\n00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.690\nI mean, let's face it, you know when a new\nlaptop lands on your desk, right, okay.\n\n339\n00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.360\nIf it needs to be referred\nto change management,\n\n340\n00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.200\nthen we would escalate\nto change management.\n\n341\n00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.320\nAnd then the next step there is to close.\n\n342\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.740\nNow, you'll notice that there is\na link to financial management\n\n343\n00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.940\nwhen we close that request.\n\n344\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.155\nAnd that is to let financial management\nknow that we've spent the money, yeah.\n\n345\n00:21:02.155 --> 00:21:06.350\nIt's no good just spending money,\nespecially if its been pre-authorized.\n\n346\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.390\nWe can't just spend money and\nthen not tell anybody we spent money.\n\n347\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.680\nOtherwise, how do we can keep\nan eye on our budgets and\n\n348\n00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.920\nour accounting if we don't tell\npeople how much money we've spent?\n\n349\n00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.927\nI mean, sure,\n\n350\n00:21:16.927 --> 00:21:21.748\nthis cost center manager might have\nauthorized any spend up to $ 700.\n\n351\n00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:25.081\nAnd if that's just one laptop,\nthen that's $700.\n\n352\n00:21:25.081 --> 00:21:28.881\nBut if there are ten people in his team\nand they've all asked for a new laptop,\n\n353\n00:21:28.881 --> 00:21:30.358\nthen that's $7,000.\n\n354\n00:21:30.358 --> 00:21:30.875\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n355\n00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:34.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we need to make sure\nthat we can account for that money.\n\n356\n00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.480\nSo we ensure we let\nfinancial management know.\n\n357\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.920\nAnd the other thing that we do as part\nof closure is it's the service desk's\n\n358\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:48.360\nresponsibility to ensure that\nwe check with the requestor,\n\n359\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.050\nthe person that's asked for that request.\n\n360\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:54.240\nThat we've delivered what they expected.\n\n361\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.540\nAnd that they're happy cuz ultimately what\nwe want to do is deliver value to them.\n\n362\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.910\nWe would undertake this whether\nit's a request for information or\n\n363\n00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.370\nwhether it's a request for a new laptop.\n\n364\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.210\nIf you've asked for a new laptop,\nI'm going to come back to you and\n\n365\n00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.735\nI'm going to say to you, are you happy\nwith that laptop that you've got?\n\n366\n00:22:12.735 --> 00:22:16.060\nI've fulfilled your request,\nare you happy?\n\n367\n00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.870\nBut if you've asked me for information,\nI'm also going to come back to you and\n\n368\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.910\nI'm going to say, okay,\nare you happy with the answer I gave you?\n\n369\n00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.050\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n370\n00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:29.810\nAnd it's just that confirmation that\nthe user is indeed happy, the requester is\n\n371\n00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:35.000\nhappy, and\nthat we can close that record knowing that\n\n372\n00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.060\nit doesn't need to be reopened because we\nhaven't actually fulfilled that request.\n\n373\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:46.200\nSo in a nutshell, that is\nthe request management process flow.\n\n374\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.310\nWhat I can tell you, and what I want to\nreinforce, really, cuz I already mentioned\n\n375\n00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:56.060\nthis at the start of the session, is that\nthis process flow is just an example.\n\n376\n00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.353\nAnd, really, it is up to you to adapt the\nframework that we give you in ITIL, and\n\n377\n00:23:01.353 --> 00:23:06.760\nto ensure that you are aligned to\nthe needs of your organization,\n\n378\n00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.300\nand that the process that you form for\n\n379\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:15.710\nyour organization meets the need and\ndelivers value.\n\n380\n00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.304\nWhat we don't want to do is to hinder.\n\n381\n00:23:19.304 --> 00:23:23.472\nAnd that is something that, quite often,\nis seen within request fulfillment,\n\n382\n00:23:23.472 --> 00:23:27.414\nis that there's a perception there\nthat this is just another bureaucracy.\n\n383\n00:23:27.414 --> 00:23:32.326\nAnd it's just gonna get in the way when\nall I wanna do is I just wanna buy\n\n384\n00:23:32.326 --> 00:23:33.350\na new laptop.\n\n385\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.830\nI just wanna add a new component\nto the infrastructure.\n\n386\n00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.360\nOr I just want some information,\nwhy do I have to go in and log it?\n\n387\n00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:46.940\nIf request fulfillment has been\nconfigured to be efficient,\n\n388\n00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.930\nthen the user will never ever notice\nthat requests have been logged.\n\n389\n00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.910\nBureaucracy will not exist.\n\n390\n00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:59.150\nAnd they will not be aware of what it\nis that we're doing in the background.\n\n391\n00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:05.810\nBut we can give them the assurance that if\nthey've got any questions to do with that\n\n392\n00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:10.090\nrequest that we are tracking that request,\nand that we can answer them straight away.\n\n393\n00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:15.881\n&gt;&gt; Jo, I agree, the idea of understanding\nthe formalization of request fulfillment\n\n394\n00:24:15.881 --> 00:24:19.879\nis something that may be difficult for\na new organization starting out.\n\n395\n00:24:19.879 --> 00:24:23.790\nBecause a lot of times, especially\nwhen startups, small startups happen,\n\n396\n00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.130\nthey just purchase.\n\n397\n00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.476\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And then they get used\n\n398\n00:24:26.476 --> 00:24:29.350\nto that idea of if I need it,\nI need to buy it.\n\n399\n00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:33.190\nAnd as organizations continue to grow,\nthey've got to realize that\n\n400\n00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.140\nputting this process in place gives them\nthe checks and balances that they need\n\n401\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.450\nto be able to operate more efficiently\nas well as more effectively.\n\n402\n00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.090\nSo this flow, and this process\nflow that we're talking about,\n\n403\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.640\nis really something that is\nessential to our organization.\n\n404\n00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:51.000\nNow, Jo, do we actually have to think\nabout some other materials, as well?\n\n405\n00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.370\nDo we have an assignment with this\nparticular show that we're doing?\n\n406\n00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.770\n&gt;&gt; We don't have a direct assignment\nwith this particular show.\n\n407\n00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:03.795\nObviously, as with all of the modules,\nyou do have corresponding notes.\n\n408\n00:25:03.795 --> 00:25:08.110\nAnd we always recommend that\nyou review those notes.\n\n409\n00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.220\nAt the end of the next assignment,\nin the next.\n\n410\n00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.280\nSorry, at the end of the next session,\n\n411\n00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.590\nwhich is where we look at\nrelationships and we look at metrics,\n\n412\n00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.598\nthere is an assignment which will take\napproximately an hour to undertake.\n\n413\n00:25:20.598 --> 00:25:25.462\nAnd so, yes I'll be directing you to that\n[LAUGH] at the end of the next assignment,\n\n414\n00:25:25.462 --> 00:25:26.389\nwithout fail.\n\n415\n00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:30.853\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right Jo, well, thank you\nagain for helping us to understand this\n\n416\n00:25:30.853 --> 00:25:35.020\nnature of request fulfillment\nprocess flow a little bit better.\n\n417\n00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.350\nAnd that is a great place for\nus to also sign off for this episode.\n\n418\n00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.490\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n419\n00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:42.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

00:00:08.226\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:12.034\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:14.579\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:19.410\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.270\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.240\nToday, we're gonna be diving in to\nthe request for filament matrix.\n\n9\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.050\nWe're specifically looking at\ndifferent types of relationships, and\n\n10\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.550\nof course, even matrix that we have to\nget under our sleeve here a little bit.\n\n11\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.310\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be\nour mastermind in ITIL, Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.919\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:39.636\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:40.501\nHow are you, Ronnie?\n\n15\n00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:42.500\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great, Jo.\n\n16\n00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.243\nAs we begin to take a look at some of\nthese different things that we really have\n\n17\n00:00:46.243 --> 00:00:50.687\nto cover, the process relationships, I'm\nassuming this is what we're talking about,\n\n18\n00:00:50.687 --> 00:00:54.079\nas well as some of these metrics that\nwe need to understand to help us to\n\n19\n00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.674\nfigure out whether we're\ndoing well in this or not.\n\n20\n00:00:56.674 --> 00:00:58.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n21\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.580\nLike all processes within ITIL,\n\n22\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.210\nall of these processes, including\nrequest fulfillment, are intertwined.\n\n23\n00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.800\nAnd without that relationship between\nall of the processes, then quite simply,\n\n24\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.980\nwe're not able to deliver\nvalue to the business.\n\n25\n00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.880\nJust imagine if everybody\nis working in a silo.\n\n26\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.730\nWhen you've got people that\nare working independently,\n\n27\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.470\nnot talking to each other,\nthere's no efficiency there.\n\n28\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.910\nThere's no collaboration there,\nthere's no cooperation.\n\n29\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.510\nAnd the end result is always going\nto be a little bit hit-and-miss.\n\n30\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.250\nCertainly, it's not\ngoing to be consistent.\n\n31\n00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.630\nSo it's exactly the same with processes.\n\n32\n00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.500\nWhere you've got processes that\nare operating independently, well,\n\n33\n00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.600\nthe results are going to be\na little bit hit-and-miss.\n\n34\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.010\nThere's gonna be no consistency there.\n\n35\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.510\nI mean, let's take a look at\nconfiguration management, for instance.\n\n36\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.050\nI've mentioned in a lot of our previous\nsessions, just in service operation,\n\n37\n00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.070\nhow important configuration management\nis and having an accurate and\n\n38\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.570\nreliable source of information about\nthe components of our service.\n\n39\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.340\nWell let's just say that I had\ninformation about your laptop.\n\n40\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.890\nAnd you had different\ninformation about your laptop,\n\n41\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.020\nand they were both stored\non different databases.\n\n42\n00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.580\nWhich one would be accurate?\n\n43\n00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.227\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know which one would\nactually be accurate at that point unless\n\n44\n00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:20.472\nI knew exactly everything\nabout my own laptop,\n\n45\n00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:22.848\nand maybe you were just\nsending the information.\n\n46\n00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:25.260\nI would assume mine\nwould be more accurate.\n\n47\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.910\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n48\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.610\nThere's an assumption there.\n\n49\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.740\nBut let's say that somebody in\nthe organization, let's call him Taylor,\n\n50\n00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.446\nwere to come in and\nwant to make a change to that laptop.\n\n51\n00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:39.400\nWho would he trust?\n\n52\n00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.170\nWho would he believe?\n\n53\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.400\nWhere would he get the right information?\n\n54\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.410\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n55\n00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.510\nI don't know exactly where he would get\nthe right information unless he did\n\n56\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.554\nresearch by himself, or he actually\nhad access to the device itself.\n\n57\n00:02:54.554 --> 00:02:55.162\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n58\n00:02:55.162 --> 00:03:01.190\nSo I'm not saying that either you or\nI are untrustworthy because we're not.\n\n59\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.515\nBut we've both got different information.\n\n60\n00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:04.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n61\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.633\n&gt;&gt; And so when Taylor wanted to\nmake a change to that laptop,\n\n62\n00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:11.727\nhe would have to find out who had\nthe right information, if anybody.\n\n63\n00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:12.347\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n64\n00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:16.422\n&gt;&gt; What that means is that so far we've\nhad three people now that have looked for\n\n65\n00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:18.535\nrelevant information on that laptop.\n\n66\n00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:20.531\nYou see, I have one load of information.\n\n67\n00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:24.726\nThat means that I have gleaned\nthat information somehow.\n\n68\n00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:26.232\nYou have another load of information.\n\n69\n00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:30.145\nAnd because there's that discrepancy,\nthen quite simply,\n\n70\n00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:35.620\nhe doesn't know which one is accurate, so\nhe's gonna have to do that work again.\n\n71\n00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So the same exercise\n\n72\n00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.555\nto gain information about the spec of\ntheir laptop has been done three times.\n\n73\n00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.040\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's not efficient.\n\n74\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.960\nIt's certainly not in a consistent way.\n\n75\n00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.740\nAnd so, you can see now that\nthe importance of having that relationship\n\n76\n00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.810\nbetween all of those processes, and\nthe importance of having accurate and\n\n77\n00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.890\nreliable information is really a priority,\nisn't it?\n\n78\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.580\nAnd we're not just talking about accuracy.\n\n79\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.030\nWe're talking about reliable.\n\n80\n00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.707\nBecause I could be accurate a hundred\npercent of the time, but my information\n\n81\n00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:13.550\nmight be a little bit sort of intermittent\nand a little bit hit-and-miss.\n\n82\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.260\nThe information I've got's accurate, but I\ndon't have the full suite of information.\n\n83\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.640\nYou might have the full suite or\nfull complement of information, but\n\n84\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.528\nyour information might not be accurate.\n\n85\n00:04:23.528 --> 00:04:27.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So there's no reliability there at all.\n\n86\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.390\nSo it's really important that we\nhave a single source of consistent,\n\n87\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.850\naccurate, and reliable information, and\n\n88\n00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.370\nthat information is then used to support\nall of the other ITIL processes.\n\n89\n00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.920\nSo if we take a look at the slide that\nwe have for this particular section,\n\n90\n00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.060\nyou'll see that there are a number of\nrelationships that are mentioned there.\n\n91\n00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.450\nAnd I just talked about\nconfiguration management.\n\n92\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.240\nNow configuration management is\nnot mentioned there, but yet,\n\n93\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.530\nconfiguration management provides\nthat single source of accurate and\n\n94\n00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.520\nreliable information for\nall of our processes.\n\n95\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.830\nWhy do I need to know the configuration\n\n96\n00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.600\nof a laptop if you have made\na request to replace your laptop?\n\n97\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.940\n&gt;&gt; Well to be able to get at least some of\nthe right specs that we need to match or\n\n98\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.341\nto exceed what we need.\n\n99\n00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:22.033\n&gt;&gt; I have to know your preferences.\n\n100\n00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:24.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n101\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.780\n&gt;&gt; I have to know who you are,\nhow you like to work,\n\n102\n00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.140\nwhether you have preferences\nin the type of laptop,\n\n103\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.400\nwhether you have certain requirements,\nsuch as screen size, for instance.\n\n104\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.130\nWhether you have requirements\nin terms of software.\n\n105\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.210\nSome people, for instance, there may be\nmedical requirements, believe it or not.\n\n106\n00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.229\nSome people may have issues with their\nwrist, which means that they can't type,\n\n107\n00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.619\nwhich means that we need to put on\nsome speech recognition software.\n\n108\n00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:56.156\nOther people may choose to have or\n\n109\n00:05:56.156 --> 00:06:01.370\nmay actually require a larger screen than,\nsay, other people.\n\n110\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.940\nAnd yet other people have preferences for\nsmaller devices.\n\n111\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.080\nRemember, the value is perceived.\n\n112\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.700\nIf somebody gave me a laptop\nthat had a 24\" screen, and that\n\n113\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.270\nwas very heavy and cumbersome, I probably\nwouldn't be too appreciative of that.\n\n114\n00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.240\nAnd yet,\nI walk into offices every single day, and\n\n115\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.560\nI see laptops that have been carried in,\nand that have been put into a docking\n\n116\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.980\nstation where their display is on a bigger\nscreen, sometimes even multiple screens.\n\n117\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.540\nNow, that's not my preference.\n\n118\n00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.180\nBut the configuration\nmanagement database carries my\n\n119\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.110\npreferences because it\nknows what I already have.\n\n120\n00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.890\nIt also knows things\nlike details about me.\n\n121\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.416\nIt knows my profile,\nit knows what services I have access to.\n\n122\n00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:59.060\nIt may even know my hours of work.\n\n123\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.234\nLet's face it, there's no point in\ndelivering a laptop to me at five in\n\n124\n00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:07.838\nthe afternoon if I'm never here beyond\nfour in the afternoon, for instance.\n\n125\n00:07:07.838 --> 00:07:11.193\nBut I'm quite happy for\nyou to deliver a laptop to me at seven\n\n126\n00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:15.029\nin the morning because that's\ngenerally what time I'm at my desk.\n\n127\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.210\nI also may need a laptop that will\nsupport a certain screen size or\n\n128\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.470\na certain resolution because of\nsome of the apps that I have.\n\n129\n00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.050\nThat's why configuration management\nhas that information for me, so\n\n130\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.620\nthere's no duplication.\n\n131\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.140\nSo that, in itself,\nis an important relationship.\n\n132\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.060\nAnd then let's take a look at the other\nrelationships that we have in front of us\n\n133\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.390\nright now.\n\n134\n00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.245\nSo what about the service catalogue?\n\n135\n00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.028\nThe service catalogue is\na list of services that\n\n136\n00:07:48.028 --> 00:07:53.140\nare available to users,\nfor them to purchase.\n\n137\n00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.884\nNow I use purchase in sort of quotes\nbecause we don't always cross-charge\n\n138\n00:07:57.884 --> 00:08:00.378\ninternally within the organization.\n\n139\n00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:03.272\nBut think of it in terms\nof online retailers.\n\n140\n00:08:03.272 --> 00:08:08.058\nOnline retailers have catalogues\nnowadays Then those catalogues just list\n\n141\n00:08:08.058 --> 00:08:10.833\nthe items that are available for purchase.\n\n142\n00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:13.564\nAnd our IT service catalogue\nis exactly the same,\n\n143\n00:08:13.564 --> 00:08:17.010\nit's the services that are available for\npurchase.\n\n144\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.840\nNow the purpose of Request Fulfillment is,\nor one of the purposes of\n\n145\n00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.839\nrequest fulfillment is to source and\ndeliver components of services.\n\n146\n00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.610\nSo if I want access to\na particular service,\n\n147\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.020\nthe first thing I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to go to the service catalog.\n\n148\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.740\nAnd the service catalog is going\nto tell me whether that service is\n\n149\n00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.170\navailable to me.\n\n150\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:42.910\nIt's also going to tell me how to gain\naccess to that particular service.\n\n151\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.040\nSo the service catalog I would\nexpect to have a direct link\n\n152\n00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.980\nfrom that catalog to Request Fulfillment.\n\n153\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.890\nAnd in the same way that you\nhave in online shopping,\n\n154\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.140\nyou have that little button that says,\nadd to basket, or add to cart?\n\n155\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.060\nWell, in the same way that you do that.\n\n156\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.770\nIn our IT service catalog, we have a link\nthat take us to Request Fulfillment.\n\n157\n00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.550\nAnd that does exactly the same thing is\nthat add to basket button that you have\n\n158\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.940\nin your online shopping.\n\n159\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.935\nAnd then release and deployment,\n\n160\n00:09:18.935 --> 00:09:21.630\nwell we get release deployment\nmanagement involved.\n\n161\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.116\nAnd they often service transition\nwill get them involved\n\n162\n00:09:25.116 --> 00:09:27.885\nto actually release any components, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:32.371\nBecause releasing components\nrole is to build and\n\n164\n00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:35.800\ntest, and then deploy new services.\n\n165\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.790\nSo, release and deployment,\n\n166\n00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:44.069\nthat process will actually\ndeliver that new service to you.\n\n167\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.560\nNow I said earlier on in one of\nthe sessions that we look up that\n\n168\n00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.690\nthe process is simply a set of activities,\nokay?\n\n169\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:00.070\nIs a set of activities design to deliver\nan outcome and it design to deliver value.\n\n170\n00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.890\nAnd one person can perform many processes.\n\n171\n00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.010\nSo when I say the release and deployment\nmanagement is actually going to release\n\n172\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.470\nthat component of that service for you.\n\n173\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.550\nIt sounds as though no we're ending in\nmore bureaucracy, cuz this sounds as\n\n174\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.340\nthough there are a huge amount of steps\ninvolved so far in Request Fulfillment.\n\n175\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.940\nBecause the first thing that happens is\nthat somebody goes to the catalog, and\n\n176\n00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.490\nthen they select something and\nthey add it to basket.\n\n177\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.840\nAnd then they've gotta make\nsure that they pay for it, or\n\n178\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.050\nthat they've got financial approval.\n\n179\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.400\nAnd then it's then released through\nrelease and deployment management.\n\n180\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.770\nWell, you know what,\n\n181\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.310\nwe're not talking about ten different\npeople getting involved in this.\n\n182\n00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.790\nWe're just talking about\na different set of activities.\n\n183\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.490\nAnd if we were efficient\nwith these processes and\n\n184\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.120\nefficient with these activities\nthen there is no bureaucracy.\n\n185\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.390\nAnd your users and your requesters do\nnot actually perceive that you're going\n\n186\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.639\nthrough different processes.\n\n187\n00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.680\nAnd it should be fairly\ninvisible to you too,\n\n188\n00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.950\nbecause our service management\ntool handle that for us.\n\n189\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.081\nThat's why we have models.\n\n190\n00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:07.680\nAnd it's the same with change management.\n\n191\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.200\nI mentioned to you that change\nmanagement will actually.\n\n192\n00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.110\nThe first time we get a new\nlaptop into this environment,\n\n193\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.623\nchange management evaluates\nthat laptop itself.\n\n194\n00:11:20.623 --> 00:11:25.152\nAnd whether it will have a negative\nimpact on our infrastructure and\n\n195\n00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:27.390\non our environment.\n\n196\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.242\nAnd then once it's done that,\n\n197\n00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:33.598\nit's at that point in time where we\ndecide that this is standard change.\n\n198\n00:11:33.598 --> 00:11:37.799\nAnd that it can be fulfill through\nRequest Fulfillment provide\n\n199\n00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:41.452\nyou in the right financial\nauthorization is in place.\n\n200\n00:11:41.452 --> 00:11:43.499\nAnd line management authorization too,\n\n201\n00:11:43.499 --> 00:11:46.723\nbecause it's not just about how\nmuch money you've got to spend.\n\n202\n00:11:46.723 --> 00:11:50.056\nAnd maybe that your line manager\njust simply doesn't want you to have\n\n203\n00:11:50.056 --> 00:11:50.750\na new laptop.\n\n204\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.460\nSo while we're talking about this, while\nwe're talking about money we might as well\n\n205\n00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.060\njump around to financial management.\n\n206\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.540\nAnd financial management,\n\n207\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.950\nwell, that's that authorization to\nsay that you can have a laptop.\n\n208\n00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:12.260\nBut, I mentioned in a previous session\nthe financial approval can be given for\n\n209\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.620\nany request in advance.\n\n210\n00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.771\nAnd it's perfectly feasible for\na call center manager to say well,\n\n211\n00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:21.318\nI authorize any of my\nstaff to spend up to say,\n\n212\n00:12:21.318 --> 00:12:24.549\n$700 without me having to\nauthorize it separately.\n\n213\n00:12:24.549 --> 00:12:29.880\nThere's nothing wrong with that,\nit's perfectly acceptable.\n\n214\n00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.663\nHowever, it is very important that\nonce that $700 has been spent,\n\n215\n00:12:34.663 --> 00:12:37.144\nthat our account are kept up to date.\n\n216\n00:12:37.144 --> 00:12:41.731\n$700 it may just be $700,\nbut if you've got 10 or\n\n217\n00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:45.239\n20 people that are asking for new laptops.\n\n218\n00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:48.709\nThen all of the sudden\nwe're talking about,\n\n219\n00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:53.473\nwe've talking about $7,000 or\n$14,000 even.\n\n220\n00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:57.330\nSo it's important that we\nare able to manage our budget and\n\n221\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.219\ntherefore we have to account for\nevery single penny that we spend.\n\n222\n00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:06.230\nSo then we have incident and\naccess management then.\n\n223\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.050\nAnd the link between\nRequest Fulfillment and\n\n224\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:15.190\nincident management started right at the\nvery, very beginning of that process flow.\n\n225\n00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:20.390\nAnd right at the beginning of the process\nflow, I really wanted to just sow the seed\n\n226\n00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:26.100\nin your mind that some things\ncould be construed in any way.\n\n227\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.300\nEither as an incident, or as a request.\n\n228\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.890\nNow I'm not going to go over\neverything that we talked\n\n229\n00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.810\nabout in the previous session.\n\n230\n00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.590\nBut I will just leave you with with this.\n\n231\n00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.420\nIf I send an email to the service desk,\nasking them to reset my password.\n\n232\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.090\nIs that a request, or is it an incident?\n\n233\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.950\nAnd should it just depend on\nthe way I've worded the email?\n\n234\n00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.990\nIf I've worded the email with,\ncould you please reset my password,\n\n235\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.000\nthat sounds like a request.\n\n236\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.340\nBut if I've worded the email with,\nwell, I can't get into my services,\n\n237\n00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.760\nbecause I've forgotten my password,\nand that's an incident.\n\n238\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.240\nSo you have to define policies\nwith request fulfillment for\n\n239\n00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.380\nwhether you consider that to\nbe an incident or a request.\n\n240\n00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.820\nBecause sometimes there is\na fine line between the two.\n\n241\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.200\nAnd that takes me onto then, lastly,\nas the relationship request for access.\n\n242\n00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:32.580\nAn access request is still a request and\nthat is a request for access to something.\n\n243\n00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.317\nWe're going to talk in another\nmodule about our access management.\n\n244\n00:14:38.317 --> 00:14:42.780\nBut just remember, Request Fulfillment\nis not about fulfilling requests.\n\n245\n00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.600\nIt's about dealing with requests as\nit's aligned in the ITIL publications.\n\n246\n00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.620\nSo it's actually about\nmanaging those requests.\n\n247\n00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.000\nAnd just because I've asked\nto have access to SAP\n\n248\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.192\ndoesn't mean that I should\nhave access to SAP.\n\n249\n00:14:58.192 --> 00:15:01.139\nSo there has to be subject\nto the relevant approvals.\n\n250\n00:15:02.941 --> 00:15:03.494\nSo now,\n\n251\n00:15:03.494 --> 00:15:08.566\nlet's move on to look at the metrics\nassociated with Request Fulfillment.\n\n252\n00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:13.137\nAnd I have told you on numerous\noccasions throughout all of the modules\n\n253\n00:15:13.137 --> 00:15:17.410\nthat we've looked at so far,\nthat ITIL is a flexible framework.\n\n254\n00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.704\nAnd we're just going to\ngive you a framework, and\n\n255\n00:15:20.704 --> 00:15:26.140\nit's up to you to create a process that\nmeets the needs of your organization.\n\n256\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.980\nAnd that's very,\nvery true in your metrics as well.\n\n257\n00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:36.058\nSo what we have in front of us is\nan example of the types of CSFs and\n\n258\n00:15:36.058 --> 00:15:41.935\nKPIs that you might want to assign for\nRequest Fulfillment.\n\n259\n00:15:41.935 --> 00:15:46.020\nA CSF is a critical success factor.\n\n260\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.470\nIt's something that we've got to achieve.\n\n261\n00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.775\nIt can often be seen as fairly intangible,\nwhich is why we have KPIs,\n\n262\n00:15:53.775 --> 00:15:55.867\nkey performance indicators.\n\n263\n00:15:55.867 --> 00:15:59.910\nAnd that will tell us whether\nwe are achieving those CSFs.\n\n264\n00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.251\nSo the CSFs are something\nthat we've got to achieve.\n\n265\n00:16:05.251 --> 00:16:07.964\nThe KPIs will tell us\nwhether we are achieve but\n\n266\n00:16:07.964 --> 00:16:10.270\nthis is not just a one off achievement.\n\n267\n00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.970\nYou don't just check a box and\nsay that's okay I've done this one now and\n\n268\n00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.920\ngood we can move onto the next one.\n\n269\n00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.420\nNo, we have to achieve these\nKPIs on a continual basis.\n\n270\n00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.220\nThat's iterative, that's repeatable.\n\n271\n00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:29.830\nWe don't do this just as a one off\nexercise, you have to carry on fulfilling\n\n272\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:37.470\nthose, or meeting those CSFs and\nachieving your KPIs on a regular basis.\n\n273\n00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:42.620\nSo let's take a look at the examples then\nthat we have in front of us, so first\n\n274\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.786\nCSF here is about fulfilling requests\nin an efficient and timely manner.\n\n275\n00:16:46.786 --> 00:16:50.340\nSo Ronnie, let me ask you a question.\n\n276\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.700\nEfficient and timely manner,\nsounds very ambiguous.\n\n277\n00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.070\nWhere do you think I'm gonna\nfind that information from?\n\n278\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.610\n&gt;&gt; I am going to assume that\nwe would find the ideas of\n\n279\n00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:07.210\nwhat is gonna be acceptable inside\nof the service level agreement.\n\n280\n00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly yes,\nthat's exactly where we find it.\n\n281\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.110\nSo we have targets in our\nservice level agreement for\n\n282\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:18.720\nwhat we would consider to be timely,\nor efficient and\n\n283\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.930\nwith every single request, there is going\nto be a priority set against that request.\n\n284\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.604\nAnd so we will have a time target,\n\n285\n00:17:28.604 --> 00:17:33.480\na service level target as we like to call\nit, will have a time target within that\n\n286\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.370\nSLA, that is then transposed into\nthat request within our service\n\n287\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.980\nmanagement tool that will monitor\nwhether we are achieving or\n\n288\n00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:48.270\ndelivering that request\nwithin that agreed timeframe.\n\n289\n00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:53.280\nSo the KPI's that we would need to monitor\nthen in order to be able to achieve\n\n290\n00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:00.790\nthat would be something along the lines of\nmeantime elapsed for handling requests.\n\n291\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.050\nNotice that doesn't say\nfulfilling requests\n\n292\n00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.900\nbecause we've already said you don't give\neverybody everything that they want.\n\n293\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.310\nNow there's cost mentioned in there and\nyet\n\n294\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:21.860\nI don't see cost mentioned in the CSF but\nthat's not true\n\n295\n00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:27.010\nbecause it talks about efficiency and\nefficiency means minimal waste.\n\n296\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:31.800\nWhen we refer to minimal waste in IT\nwe mean minimal in terms of time.\n\n297\n00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.500\nThat's the obvious one but\nwe also mean in terms of cost and\n\n298\n00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.830\nwe mean in terms of skills as well.\n\n299\n00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.920\nHaving the right person with the right\nskills to perform the right role.\n\n300\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.920\nSo yeah,\ncost is a huge part of this tome and then\n\n301\n00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.870\nthe bringing down of service requests for\neach stage of their life cycle.\n\n302\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:57.720\nWell that actually just refers\nto how we are handling requests.\n\n303\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.570\nIs there a backlog somewhere?\n\n304\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.360\nDo we have a sticking point?\n\n305\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.830\nDo we have a hurdle at some point\nthrough the process where we just seem\n\n306\n00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:13.400\nto be stuck, maybe some bureaucracy,\nthat is usually what it is, isn't?\n\n307\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.080\nSo that gives us a point for improvement.\n\n308\n00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.310\nIf we've got a blockage somewhere then\nmaybe we need to review the process\n\n309\n00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.170\nin order to eliminate that blockage or\nto overcome that hurdle.\n\n310\n00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.650\nAnd then of course,\n\n311\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.430\nthe next CSF seems like a fairly\nobvious one doesn't it really?\n\n312\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.000\nOnly authorized requests\nshould be fulfilled.\n\n313\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.020\nWe don't give everybody\neverything they ask for.\n\n314\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.950\nSo then we've got a KPI there,\nwhich looks like a very strange one,\n\n315\n00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.300\nwhich is about a percentage of\nunauthorized requests fulfilled.\n\n316\n00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.550\nYou wouldn't believe just how many\n\n317\n00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.450\nunauthorized requests\nactually get fulfilled.\n\n318\n00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.680\nHow do you think that we can address that?\n\n319\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.400\n&gt;&gt; That’s a good one.\n\n320\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.960\nWith the idea of unauthorized\nrequest fulfilled,\n\n321\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.660\nI'm trying to think of\neven where to begin.\n\n322\n00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.270\nA lot of times I can see where somebody\nmight just deal with the issue in the way\n\n323\n00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.520\nthat they can.\n\n324\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.275\nSo that it can just get the person,\nI shouldn't say the person.\n\n325\n00:20:17.275 --> 00:20:20.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The user out of their particular\n\n326\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.120\nhair ride at that moment and\nnot think about it.\n\n327\n00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.540\nOr that service desk is too busy with so\n\n328\n00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:31.200\nmany things that they forget to log it\nin some way, some measure, somehow.\n\n329\n00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.390\nSo if there's an automated system\nmaybe that's probably the best way or\n\n330\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.840\nat least an option that we have available.\n\n331\n00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.790\n&gt;&gt; I do like the way you refer to\nthe service desk as getting that user out\n\n332\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.493\nof their head [CROSSTALK] but\nyou know what, and\n\n333\n00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:47.638\nI do like to say that we got\nto be realistic about this.\n\n334\n00:20:47.638 --> 00:20:51.338\nWe have to and I mentioned when\nwe looked at incident management,\n\n335\n00:20:51.338 --> 00:20:53.963\none of the things I\nmentioned was about the fact\n\n336\n00:20:53.963 --> 00:20:57.599\nthat interactions with the service\ndesk are generally negative\n\n337\n00:20:57.599 --> 00:21:01.940\nbecause users call the service desk\nwhen something has gone wrong.\n\n338\n00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.730\nAnd so you can imagine if you're\nhaving a busy day on the service desk,\n\n339\n00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:09.670\nit might be really, really easy just to\nsay I can't be bothered to do this or\n\n340\n00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.630\nI can't be bothered to\ngo through the process.\n\n341\n00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Let's just fulfill it.\n\n342\n00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.420\nWell, of course that's not best practice.\n\n343\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.130\nSo, yes we might choose to automate.\n\n344\n00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:23.030\nWhat we might also do is ensure that\nwe have the right skills in place on\n\n345\n00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:28.590\nthe service desk, so that people are aware\nof what requests can be approved,\n\n346\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.310\nwhat requests we should take, a little bit\nmore time or maybe you need a little bit\n\n347\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.960\nof further investigation, and we'd launch\nsomething like an awareness campaign if we\n\n348\n00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.980\nfound that unauthorized\nrequests were being fulfilled.\n\n349\n00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.930\n&gt;&gt; Or additional policies, maybe?\n\n350\n00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we could implement policies too.\n\n351\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.830\nWhat we'd also like to do though is\nnot just have an awareness campaign or\n\n352\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.590\npolicies within the service\ndesk internally.\n\n353\n00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:56.320\nWe'd like to do that outside\nof the service desk, too.\n\n354\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.620\nSo it's not just the service desk, what\nwe're talking about is anybody in IT and\n\n355\n00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:04.350\nwhat we're talking about\nalso are our users as well.\n\n356\n00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.780\nAnd so when you mentioned automating,\nyou see a lot of requests\n\n357\n00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.620\ncome in via the interface\nto the call log in system,\n\n358\n00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.510\nwhether it by the app or\nvia the internet interface.\n\n359\n00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:22.400\nWhat we may do is put checks\nin place on that interface,\n\n360\n00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.389\nwe may even put help systems\navailable on that interface.\n\n361\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.120\nThink about sometimes you go to a web,\nyou go to a web search engine and\n\n362\n00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.690\nyou will see something on that\nsearch engine that's when you type\n\n363\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.650\nsomething in then suggestions come\nup well that's how most service\n\n364\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.750\nmanagement tools work nowadays so what\nwe'll do is we will actually put something\n\n365\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.850\non the service management tool that if it\nsays can I have a new computer please?\n\n366\n00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:54.940\nIt will actually say you can have\na new computer if you're eligible and\n\n367\n00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.300\nyou fulfill these requirements and\nthese are the hours that you work, etc.\n\n368\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:05.665\nOkay, so there are a number of ways to\ntackle the unauthorized request and\n\n369\n00:23:05.665 --> 00:23:09.785\nwe shouldn't really put all the blame on\nthe service desk cuz sometimes you know,\n\n370\n00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:12.455\nit's the users that are just\ntrying to get something,.\n\n371\n00:23:12.455 --> 00:23:17.125\nThat maybe they don't realize,\nthat they are not supposed to have.\n\n372\n00:23:17.125 --> 00:23:18.945\nThat they're not eligible for.\n\n373\n00:23:18.945 --> 00:23:20.665\n&gt;&gt; It's unusual.\n\n374\n00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.265\nI shouldn't say it's unusual.\n\n375\n00:23:22.265 --> 00:23:26.930\nYou do tend to have this sense,\nthat if you can talk to somebody directly,\n\n376\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.240\nthat you can somehow bypass\nwhatever system is in there.\n\n377\n00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.260\nSo you can't blame them for\ntrying but it is,\n\n378\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.930\nit's part of that process of saying, well\nhere's the policy and here's why we do it.\n\n379\n00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.310\nSo they learn how to do it the right way\nand they understand why we do it but\n\n380\n00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.020\nyou can't blame them for trying.\n\n381\n00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.250\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n382\n00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.960\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny you should mention\nthat because the way that we're\n\n383\n00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.810\ntalking about it almost\ninvalidates their requests.\n\n384\n00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.215\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But you see, and\n\n385\n00:23:52.215 --> 00:23:56.969\nthis is one of the advantages of making\nsure that all request are logged and\n\n386\n00:23:56.969 --> 00:24:01.953\neven if all requests are logged and then\nreject That may be a genuine reason why\n\n387\n00:24:01.953 --> 00:24:05.556\nusers already they're trying\nto bypass the system, or\n\n388\n00:24:05.556 --> 00:24:09.878\nmaybe asking for something that\nwe haven't authorized for them.\n\n389\n00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:14.138\nAnd if we got a lot of requests for\na certain piece of equipment or for\n\n390\n00:24:14.138 --> 00:24:18.703\ncertain amount of information,\nthen it may be that we need to review our\n\n391\n00:24:18.703 --> 00:24:23.344\npolicies to see if they can actually\nhave access to that information, or\n\n392\n00:24:23.344 --> 00:24:27.430\nif they can actually have access\nto that piece of hardware.\n\n393\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:32.250\nSo it's not just a case of people\ntrying to bypass the bureaucracy,\n\n394\n00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:36.640\nsometimes there's a genuine need and\nwe just haven't caught up with that.\n\n395\n00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.230\nAnd we're just not aligned to\nthe needs of the business, and\n\n396\n00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.400\nthat's what we're supposed to be,\nlets face it.\n\n397\n00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.900\nSomething else that was\nmention in that CSF,\n\n398\n00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:49.860\nunder the authorized requests was\nabout security threats and incidents.\n\n399\n00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.620\nAnd we do have to acknowledge that, if you\ngive somebody access to something that\n\n400\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.200\nthey shouldn't have access to,\nthat is a security breach.\n\n401\n00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.490\nA lot of organizations\nare trying very hard to\n\n402\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.360\nmaintain security policies at the moment.\n\n403\n00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.550\nWe know that IT security is very,\nvery real.\n\n404\n00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.090\nAnd we have to acknowledge that,\n\n405\n00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:17.450\nwhere we give out access to\nan inappropriate person or\n\n406\n00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:23.150\nto an unauthorized service,\nthen there could be a security breach.\n\n407\n00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.920\nSo security management may\nneed to get involved in this.\n\n408\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.900\nAnd then, the next CSF is\nall about user satisfaction.\n\n409\n00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.170\nBecause even though we\nhave to say no sometimes,\n\n410\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.560\nwe still want people to be happy.\n\n411\n00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.950\nSo let's think about efficiency here.\n\n412\n00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:48.230\nEven if we say no, we should go\nback in a timely manner and say no.\n\n413\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:53.340\nNobody wants to wait for six days, for\n\n414\n00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.300\nsomebody to come back and\nsay no you can't have this.\n\n415\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.180\nYou know what it's like yourself,\nyou've ordered something online and\n\n416\n00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.300\nwe all do it and\nit happened to me just the other week.\n\n417\n00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:08.620\nI ordered something online and\nit took about a week, maybe a week and\n\n418\n00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:13.780\na half before I got an email that said,\nyour credit card has been refunded and\n\n419\n00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.490\nwe don't have this particular\nitem available anymore.\n\n420\n00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.335\nI was not a happy bunny.\n\n421\n00:26:19.335 --> 00:26:20.936\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Put it that way,\n\n422\n00:26:20.936 --> 00:26:23.458\n[LAUGH] I was pretty annoyed.\n\n423\n00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:25.600\nAnd I kinda wish that they'd\nturned around to me, and\n\n424\n00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.580\nthat was actually my first thought was,\nwhy didn't it just say out of stock.\n\n425\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.460\nThen I could've looked for something else.\n\n426\n00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n427\n00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:36.147\n&gt;&gt; So none of us are very,\nvery happy if we get told no a week and\n\n428\n00:26:36.147 --> 00:26:37.500\na half down the line.\n\n429\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.202\nWe'd rather be told no.\n\n430\n00:26:39.202 --> 00:26:43.763\nSo user satisfaction not only has to\nbe maintained in the speed in which\n\n431\n00:26:43.763 --> 00:26:48.120\nwe fulfill requests, but\nalso the speed in which we say no as well.\n\n432\n00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.560\nSo we wanna try and\n\n433\n00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.820\nkeep our request backlog to an absolute\nminimum, it makes sense really.\n\n434\n00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:59.090\nSo the only ones that are outstanding are\ntheones that are waiting to be fulfilled,\n\n435\n00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:03.810\nand they are within their service\nlevel target for fulfillment.\n\n436\n00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.870\nWe don't certainly wanna have any\noutstanding that are waiting to be\n\n437\n00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.730\nrejected, put it that way.\n\n438\n00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:15.310\nThe last KPI on that though\nunderneath the size of the backlog,\n\n439\n00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:19.000\ntalks about the number of\nrequest related incidents.\n\n440\n00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.066\nThat's an interesting relationship here,\nand\n\n441\n00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:25.653\nwhat that really refers to is\nthe fact that sometimes if we\n\n442\n00:27:25.653 --> 00:27:30.379\ndon't fulfill a request quick enough,\nthere could be related incident.\n\n443\n00:27:30.379 --> 00:27:34.048\nLet's say you've highlighted the fact\nthat you don't want, I know that over\n\n444\n00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:38.124\nthe fast few sessions, you've been having\na huge amount of trouble with your laptop.\n\n445\n00:27:38.124 --> 00:27:40.950\n[INAUDIBLE] keep locking up on you.\n\n446\n00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.630\nYou've had to reboot it so many times\nright away throughout incident and\n\n447\n00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:46.890\nproblem management.\n\n448\n00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.394\nAnd you've got to the point\nnow where you thought,\n\n449\n00:27:48.394 --> 00:27:50.350\nwell I'll just put in a new request.\n\n450\n00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n451\n00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.030\n&gt;&gt; So you put in new request for\na laptop and\n\n452\n00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.530\nwe go into grant you a new laptop,\njust probably not quick enough.\n\n453\n00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:01.600\nAnd so you've had another incident\nbecause it's locked up again, and\n\n454\n00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.490\nmaybe you've had another\nthree in the last two days.\n\n455\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.750\nAnd why have you had\nthose three incidents?\n\n456\n00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.980\nWell, those three incidents\nare a direct result of the fact that\n\n457\n00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.088\nwe haven't fulfilled that\nrequest quick enough.\n\n458\n00:28:12.088 --> 00:28:18.840\nCuz if we'd fulfilled the request quicker,\nthen we wouldn't have had those incidents.\n\n459\n00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.939\nSo when we talk about the number\nof request-related incidents,\n\n460\n00:28:22.939 --> 00:28:28.093\nwell we can have incidents because we're\nnot fulfilling requests quick enough.\n\n461\n00:28:30.266 --> 00:28:36.430\nSo in summary then, the inputs and\noutputs to request fulfillment.\n\n462\n00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.390\nWell look at all of these inputs.\n\n463\n00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.920\nThey're just requests.\n\n464\n00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.480\nThe service request, the work request,\nthe request for information,\n\n465\n00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.015\nand that comes out of request\nfulfillment or hopefully no incidence.\n\n466\n00:28:48.015 --> 00:28:50.768\n[LAUGH] Let's hope no but\nit could be changes,\n\n467\n00:28:50.768 --> 00:28:55.890\nbecause somebody maybe asking for\nsomething they've never asked before.\n\n468\n00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.220\nBut it should authorized or\nrejected request.\n\n469\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.840\nSo even cancelled requests.\n\n470\n00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.010\nThat the user has cancelled themeself.\n\n471\n00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:07.830\nUltimately though, what we need to\nensure comes out of request fulfillment\n\n472\n00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.840\nis of course, updated request records.\n\n473\n00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.890\nIn other words, that we are keeping track\nall those requests, and that they're\n\n474\n00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:20.370\nare not just logged and then kind of\nforgotten about until they are fulfilled.\n\n475\n00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.666\nCommunication to our customers is really,\nreally important and\n\n476\n00:29:24.666 --> 00:29:29.040\nkeeping them updated of current\nprogress is absolute paramount,\n\n477\n00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.350\nbecause of course we're interested\nin customer satisfaction.\n\n478\n00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.876\nWhich is why this slide here\nis the perfect next slide,\n\n479\n00:29:36.876 --> 00:29:39.789\nbecause it talks about the service desk,\nand\n\n480\n00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:44.941\nthe service desk takes full accountability\nfor communication with our users.\n\n481\n00:29:44.941 --> 00:29:48.923\nAnd we like to think of them as\nthat single point of contact, or\n\n482\n00:29:48.923 --> 00:29:51.462\nthat window to IT as I like to call them.\n\n483\n00:29:51.462 --> 00:29:55.944\nAnd the service desk not only take\non shipper incident management, but\n\n484\n00:29:55.944 --> 00:29:58.937\nthey also manage request\nfulfillment as well.\n\n485\n00:29:58.937 --> 00:30:02.617\nSo the service desk,\nwill actually do that initial filter and\n\n486\n00:30:02.617 --> 00:30:06.389\ndecide whether it's an incident,\nor a request, or a change.\n\n487\n00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:10.121\nAnd the service desk will actually,\nwhilst they don't track the, or\n\n488\n00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:13.411\nwhilst they don't sorry,\nfulfill the request themselves,\n\n489\n00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:17.018\nthey'll certainly track that\nrequest throughout its lifecycle,\n\n490\n00:30:17.018 --> 00:30:21.344\nmonitor the service level targets to make\nsure we're still within the targets.\n\n491\n00:30:21.344 --> 00:30:26.895\nAnd they will communicate with the users\non a regular basis and they themselves\n\n492\n00:30:26.895 --> 00:30:33.350\nwill take ownership of the closure,\nmaking sure a customers are satisfied.\n\n493\n00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:37.100\nAnd lastly for this particular session.\n\n494\n00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:42.280\nThey will manage any\nreopening of any request.\n\n495\n00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.020\nNow we'd like to think that we\nnever ever reopen a request,\n\n496\n00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:50.525\nbecause we either give the users what they\nask for, or we've already told them no.\n\n497\n00:30:50.525 --> 00:30:54.159\n[LAUGH] But,\nsometimes we have to reopen a request.\n\n498\n00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:57.201\nMaybe it's because I asked for\nsome information and\n\n499\n00:30:57.201 --> 00:31:01.771\nthe information that I gave wasn't quite\nright, so I need to ask for it again.\n\n500\n00:31:01.771 --> 00:31:06.292\nBut we should have pretty fine guidelines\nfor this, cuz otherwise what tends to\n\n501\n00:31:06.292 --> 00:31:10.554\nhappen is that users will call up, and\nthey'll call up two or three times.\n\n502\n00:31:10.554 --> 00:31:13.091\nAnd when we keep reopening\nthe same request,\n\n503\n00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:17.498\nthen we don't have correlation between\nthe number of phone calls we've had,\n\n504\n00:31:17.498 --> 00:31:20.320\nand the number of requests\nthat have been logged.\n\n505\n00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.418\nSo we want to ensure that we have full\ninformation and accurate information,\n\n506\n00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:29.906\nas to what is actually\nhappening on our service desk.\n\n507\n00:31:29.906 --> 00:31:35.136\nSo now it's time to look\nat your exercise guide,\n\n508\n00:31:35.136 --> 00:31:42.291\nand the exercise guide in the material\nhas some self study for you.\n\n509\n00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:47.089\nLooking at a particular case study,\nbut I would prefer you to think of\n\n510\n00:31:47.089 --> 00:31:53.550\nan organization yourselves, and to use\nmaybe your own organization as an example.\n\n511\n00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:57.550\nI will give you probably about\n60 minutes worth of study time.\n\n512\n00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.360\nI mean feel free to take\nlonger if you want to.\n\n513\n00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.700\nAnd we do have the forum available for\nyou if you do have any questions.\n\n514\n00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.190\nThen please come back to us and\n\n515\n00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.100\nwe'll be happy to answer any\nquestions about your self study, or\n\n516\n00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.860\nabout any of the topics that we've covered\nso far in this particular session.\n\n517\n00:32:14.915 --> 00:32:15.430\n&gt;&gt; Alright Jo,\n\n518\n00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:20.340\nwell thank you again for helping us to\nunderstand this process a little bit more.\n\n519\n00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.050\nIn terms of understanding whether or\n\n520\n00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:26.150\nnot we're actually fulfilling\nrequests in a effective and\n\n521\n00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.890\nefficient matter, using of course\nthose metrics that we've talked about.\n\n522\n00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.790\nThese are gonna be very important points.\n\n523\n00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:34.600\nA lot of times it's easy to\nthink that we've done something.\n\n524\n00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.260\nWell here's how you prove that\nit's actually been working,\n\n525\n00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.040\nis by taking a look at this\nparticular aspect of these metrics.\n\n526\n00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.990\nWell that's a great place for\nus to also sign off for this episode then.\n\n527\n00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.610\nSigning off for ITPro.TV.\n\n528\n00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.080\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n529\n00:32:48.080 -->

great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.820\nYou are watching ITIL Intermediate\nService Operation show, and\n\n8\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.870\nI am your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.790\nWe're going to be taking a look at another\ncategory right now which is going to be\n\n10\n00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.480\naccess management as well as\nthe process flow to that.\n\n11\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.900\nAnd here to help us of course is going\nto be our genius in ITIL, Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.620\nJo, welcome back to the studio.\n\n13\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.664\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, it's good to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:43.212\n&gt;&gt; Jo, as we get started here and\nwe're now kind of transitioning away\n\n15\n00:00:43.212 --> 00:00:45.900\nfrom our last process that\nwe're taking a look at.\n\n16\n00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.762\nThe idea of access management may actually\nkind of be a little bit more vague\n\n17\n00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:53.520\nto those of us that are not in it yet.\n\n18\n00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.219\nSo help us out with that and what are we\nreally going to be taking a look at here?\n\n19\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.275\n&gt;&gt; Okay, in assess management we are\nreally concentrating on what we call CIA.\n\n20\n00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:07.650\nAnd I don't mean any sort of\ngovernment [LAUGH] enforcement agency.\n\n21\n00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.795\nOf what I actually mean is\nthe confidentiality, the integrity and\n\n22\n00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:13.725\nthe availability of our data.\n\n23\n00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:18.283\n&gt;&gt; I'm making sure that we can\nensure the confidentiality and\n\n24\n00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:22.932\nthe integrity, and\nalso ensure that the data is available to\n\n25\n00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:27.141\nthose who should have access to it,\nwhen they need it.\n\n26\n00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.828\nBut only to those that should\nhave access to it, and\n\n27\n00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:33.040\nnot to those that shouldn't\nhave access to it.\n\n28\n00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo, in the IT world\nwhen we start talking about this\n\n29\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.760\nit really sounds like the beginning and\n\n30\n00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.380\nthe underpinnings of the security\nprinciples that we need to have in place.\n\n31\n00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.210\nSo is this more about just security?\n\n32\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.305\nIs that what we're taking a look at?\n\n33\n00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:48.325\n&gt;&gt; It's more about enforcing security.\n\n34\n00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:52.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we have a process\ncalled security management, and\n\n35\n00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.400\nthat sits within or\nservice design life cycle phase.\n\n36\n00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.250\nNow that really is a high level\nprocess where we look at security.\n\n37\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.030\nIt doesn't go into as much\ndepth as say ISO 27002, for\n\n38\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.950\ninstance, which is the international\nstandard for IT security.\n\n39\n00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.180\nBut nevertheless,\nit sets the policies for IT security.\n\n40\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.940\nSo there we are setting the policies for\nthe type of security level that we need\n\n41\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.392\nfor our organization and also how\nwe are going to maintain security.\n\n42\n00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:30.880\nHere in access management what we\nare doing is we are undertaking\n\n43\n00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.510\nthe activities that security\nmanagement set out.\n\n44\n00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.607\nSo in security management,\nthey design security.\n\n45\n00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:43.380\nHere, what we do is we give people\naccess and we take access away.\n\n46\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.282\nAnd it sounds very very simple, but\nnevertheless we need a separate\n\n47\n00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:52.926\nprocess just to ensure that we\nare adhering to the principles and\n\n48\n00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:57.313\nthe policies that have been set\nout in security management.\n\n49\n00:02:57.313 --> 00:03:01.696\nAnd also in availability management,\ntoo, which again,\n\n50\n00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:06.177\nis another process within\nservice design life cycle phase.\n\n51\n00:03:06.177 --> 00:03:09.898\nBecause ultimately,\nif security is compromised,\n\n52\n00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:14.140\nthen it effects the availability\nof our services.\n\n53\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.120\nSo availability management and IT security\nmanagement will set the policies, and\n\n54\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.630\naccess management simply gives access and\ntakes access away.\n\n55\n00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.860\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo, help us out with\nsome of the principles that we're\n\n56\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.860\ngoing to be taking a look at as we go\nthrough the idea of the process here.\n\n57\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, as you can see on\nthe first slide, the purpose of\n\n58\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.040\naccess management is really simple\nto provide the rights for users.\n\n59\n00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.200\nSo give them access, and\nexecute the security management policies.\n\n60\n00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.090\nAnd that also means taking access away.\n\n61\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.310\nSo we're going to be talking about\nthings like leavers policy and\n\n62\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.900\na new starters policy, for instance.\n\n63\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.010\nWhen somebody new comes into\nthe organization, then HR normally\n\n64\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.360\ntell us that somebody new is coming, but\nthen how quickly do we give them access?\n\n65\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.240\nAre they subject to any form\nof security clearance, or\n\n66\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.170\ndo we just give them access\nstraight away on day one?\n\n67\n00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.850\nAnd what about when somebody\nleaves the organization?\n\n68\n00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.200\nHow quickly do we rescind that access?\n\n69\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.470\nHow quickly do we take it away?\n\n70\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.250\nNow, I mentioned about how quickly but,\nof course, we've got targets for this too.\n\n71\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.384\nSo the targets for\nassigning new user IDs or\n\n72\n00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:28.484\nmaybe somebody's changed a role,\nthey changed jobs.\n\n73\n00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:32.056\nThey've got a new role and\nthey need to have their rights and\n\n74\n00:04:32.056 --> 00:04:36.145\ntheir privileges updated, so\nwe'll have targets for all of that.\n\n75\n00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:39.803\nAnd they will be found firmly enough\nin the service level agreement,\n\n76\n00:04:39.803 --> 00:04:42.400\nalong with all our other\nservice level targets.\n\n77\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.540\nSo if once we understand what the targets\nare and what the requirements are that\n\n78\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.340\nare defined in the service level\nagreement, and we understand the policies\n\n79\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.620\nthat have been set by IT security\nmanagement and by availability management.\n\n80\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.970\nThen we're able to provide access,\nupdate access, and take access away.\n\n81\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.908\nAnd again,\nin that scope there it looks at the CIA,\n\n82\n00:05:05.908 --> 00:05:10.408\nthat confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n83\n00:05:10.408 --> 00:05:14.723\nSo this is not part of the availability\nof the services as a whole, this just\n\n84\n00:05:14.723 --> 00:05:20.005\nensures that the services are available to\nthose that need to have access to them.\n\n85\n00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:24.205\nAnd that it's not available to [LAUGH]\nthose that shouldn't have access, but\n\n86\n00:05:24.205 --> 00:05:30.040\nalso that we are aware that\nsecurity is very, very important.\n\n87\n00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.550\nIf we give out access to a service\nwhere we shouldn't have done\n\n88\n00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.070\nthat could actually the availability for\nabsolutely everybody.\n\n89\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.204\nSo the policies are set within security.\n\n90\n00:05:42.204 --> 00:05:44.434\nAnd those policies might have\nsomething to do with it.\n\n91\n00:05:44.434 --> 00:05:49.459\nI mentioned ISO 27002,\nwe might have Sarbanes-Oxley or\n\n92\n00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:54.320\neven COBIT, which of course is for\nthe financial industry.\n\n93\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.360\nWe may have those policies\nthat include that,\n\n94\n00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.710\nthat have been set by\nIT security management.\n\n95\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.150\nBut here in assess management we\nprovide a process that can be audited,\n\n96\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.420\nso that we can ensure compliance too\nSarbanes-Oxley,COBIT or ISO 27002.\n\n97\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.640\nIt mentions the hidden business\nvalues about peace of mind.\n\n98\n00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.350\nIt's about that security, and not as in\nIT security, but about that assurance and\n\n99\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:29.250\nthat security that we don't\nhave any holes in our access.\n\n100\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.590\nThat only the right people have the right\nlevel of access to do their role and\n\n101\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.425\nno one has complete global\naccess to absolutely everything.\n\n102\n00:06:39.575 --> 00:06:45.585\nSo the access management policy is in\nline with the IT security policy and\n\n103\n00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:47.805\nwith availability management.\n\n104\n00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:54.130\nAnd really what we want to do is ensure\nthat we've got all of the ability,\n\n105\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.930\nshould we say,\nto audit everything that happens.\n\n106\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.195\nSo when access is given it's audited,\nwhen access is taken away it's audited.\n\n107\n00:07:01.195 --> 00:07:06.440\nWell that means then really we should\nbe logging requests for access.\n\n108\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.590\nSo it's a request.\n\n109\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:16.190\nIt's part of the request fulfillment log\nin within our core management system.\n\n110\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:22.270\nAnd we log that request and then an access\nmanagement process will take over and\n\n111\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.820\ngrant access and take access away.\n\n112\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.963\nAnd we might use tools, for instance,\nlike Active Directory, for instance,\n\n113\n00:07:29.963 --> 00:07:34.981\nto grant privileges and to update\nprivileges and to update levels of access.\n\n114\n00:07:34.981 --> 00:07:38.248\nSo it's here that we talk\nabout things like rights, for\n\n115\n00:07:38.248 --> 00:07:40.785\ninstance, the right that our users have.\n\n116\n00:07:40.785 --> 00:07:44.708\nAnd when you think about documentation,\nyou think about updates rights.\n\n117\n00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:48.614\nYou think about whether somebody\nhas author rights, for instance.\n\n118\n00:07:48.614 --> 00:07:52.006\nAnd that's what we're talking about\nhere in access management, okay?\n\n119\n00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:55.870\nSo generally,\nyour requests will come in from HR.\n\n120\n00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.292\nBut then that really depends on\nthe security policy we have.\n\n121\n00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:00.304\nIt might come in from HR.\n\n122\n00:08:00.304 --> 00:08:05.048\nIt might come in from a line manager for\ninstance.\n\n123\n00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:07.599\nBut nevertheless,\njust because one person's asked for\n\n124\n00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:10.533\nsomething doesn't mean that\nthey're automatically given it.\n\n125\n00:08:10.533 --> 00:08:12.741\nRemember request fulfillment, okay?\n\n126\n00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:17.009\nIf I call the service desk and\nask for access to payroll well,\n\n127\n00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:18.778\nwhat are they gonna say?\n\n128\n00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:19.606\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n129\n00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:21.360\n&gt;&gt; Well not necessarily.\n\n130\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360\nAnd that's the thing.\n\n131\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.412\nYou say yeah,\nyour first knee jerk reaction would be.\n\n132\n00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:27.342\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We're not letting Jo have access\n\n133\n00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:27.960\nto payroll.\n\n134\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.790\nShe will set her own salary.\n\n135\n00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.881\nAnd you're right.\n\n136\n00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:36.046\nBut if I've just changed roles,\nand I'm now the HR Director,\n\n137\n00:08:36.046 --> 00:08:38.810\nthen I should have access to payroll.\n\n138\n00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:39.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n139\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:45.400\n&gt;&gt; So what Access Management does and\nthis may well be done on the service desk.\n\n140\n00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.773\nBut what Access Management does is they\nwill do two forms of verification.\n\n141\n00:08:51.773 --> 00:08:56.462\nSo lets say then Ronnie that you\nwanted access to payroll okay.\n\n142\n00:08:56.462 --> 00:09:00.300\nThe first thing that I'm going to do is,\nI'm going to ask you for\n\n143\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.728\nID because I want to check that\nyou are who you say you are.\n\n144\n00:09:03.728 --> 00:09:07.490\nIt's not that I don't trust you, but\nwe're talking about payroll here.\n\n145\n00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You could do some damage.\n\n146\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.490\nWell you could do our\naccounts some damage, but\n\n147\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.860\nyou could do your own\nbonded count a lot of good.\n\n148\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.130\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That so,\n\n149\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.280\nI'm gonna check that you\nare who you say you are.\n\n150\n00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's the first thing that I'm going\n\n151\n00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.670\nto do, you could be an impostor,you\ncould be trying to be Cathy.\n\n152\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.380\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n153\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right?\n\n154\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.420\nSo I'm gonna check that you are who you\nsay you are and then I'm going to look at\n\n155\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:37.170\nmy security policy and I'm going to see\nwhether you should have access to payroll.\n\n156\n00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:37.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n157\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:42.382\nthere're two types of verification there,\nand one is that you are indeed Ronnie, and\n\n158\n00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:45.477\nthe second is that Ronnie\nshould have access to payroll.\n\n159\n00:09:45.477 --> 00:09:50.104\nNow of course we have to tie things\nin with HR at this point in time,\n\n160\n00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:53.135\nbecause HR are the people\nthat will perform\n\n161\n00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:58.145\nyour transfer over to the payroll\ndepartment, to the HR department.\n\n162\n00:09:58.145 --> 00:09:58.793\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n163\n00:09:58.793 --> 00:10:02.645\n&gt;&gt; So therefore, they have to tell us,\nthey have to advise us.\n\n164\n00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:06.468\nSo at least they have to confirm,\nthat you should have access, and\n\n165\n00:10:06.468 --> 00:10:08.268\nthat you have actually moved.\n\n166\n00:10:08.268 --> 00:10:09.377\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n167\n00:10:09.377 --> 00:10:15.080\n&gt;&gt; So I'm, that relationship,\nor the relationships\n\n168\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.350\nthat we have between all of our ITIL\nprocesses, in this particular instance,\n\n169\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:24.050\nextends beyond our ITIL processes and\nactually moves in to HR as well.\n\n170\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:30.035\nSo the process that we have does\nneed to have a relationship into HR,\n\n171\n00:10:30.035 --> 00:10:33.399\nwhich we may consider external to IT.\n\n172\n00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:37.247\nBut depending on the type\nof service provider we are,\n\n173\n00:10:37.247 --> 00:10:41.781\nwe might actually be a shared\nservices operation, as it were,\n\n174\n00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:46.229\na shared services type of service\nprovider in which case we may\n\n175\n00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:51.302\nactually be in the same business\nunit as HR, that's not impossible.\n\n176\n00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:55.354\nSo what we also need to do,\nand it's the last bullet, or\n\n177\n00:10:55.354 --> 00:11:00.881\nthe second from last bullet point there\nwhich talks about communication and\n\n178\n00:11:00.881 --> 00:11:04.263\nescalation and\nhandling of security events.\n\n179\n00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:11.350\nWhat we also need to do is to report\nany attempt to access any services.\n\n180\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.454\nThat, let's fact it,\nthey shouldn't be accessing.\n\n181\n00:11:14.454 --> 00:11:19.257\nSo if you are pretending to be Kathy,\nand you've come and you've asked for\n\n182\n00:11:19.257 --> 00:11:23.009\naccess to payroll,\nthen I need to do something with that.\n\n183\n00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:24.840\nI can't just ignore that.\n\n184\n00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:30.082\nYou could be my best friend in the entire\nworld, but if you've asked me to do\n\n185\n00:11:30.082 --> 00:11:36.093\nsomething that I really shouldn't be doing\njust because I have the access to do that.\n\n186\n00:11:36.093 --> 00:11:39.299\nThen I need to have some form of,\nor some method,\n\n187\n00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:42.368\nsome process to be able\nto report that as well.\n\n188\n00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:46.251\nSo part of this role is\nthat responsibility of\n\n189\n00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:49.732\nhighlighting security incidence too.\n\n190\n00:11:49.732 --> 00:11:53.760\nThis is all part of Security\nof our IT services, and\n\n191\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.920\nmaking sure that we can maintain\nthat CIA as we've already said.\n\n192\n00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.400\nSo the process that you can see\nright in front of you now is again,\n\n193\n00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.006\nI'm very assuming to the request\nfulfillment process.\n\n194\n00:12:08.006 --> 00:12:11.942\nReally, really good if you\nhave a magnifying glass,\n\n195\n00:12:11.942 --> 00:12:15.185\nso I splitted down very, very simply okay.\n\n196\n00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:17.335\nSo we start off with our triggers,\n\n197\n00:12:17.335 --> 00:12:20.535\nas with any process we start\noff with our triggers.\n\n198\n00:12:20.535 --> 00:12:24.211\nAnd it could come in as a service request,\nto request for\n\n199\n00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:28.904\naccess to request fulfillment or\nit could come in from HR or as a script,\n\n200\n00:12:28.904 --> 00:12:31.040\nit could be any type of request.\n\n201\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.563\nOr any types of triggers.\n\n202\n00:12:32.563 --> 00:12:36.230\nAnd really we receive that request and\nthen we verify.\n\n203\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.687\nAnd as we've already said.\n\n204\n00:12:37.687 --> 00:12:44.830\nI need to verify that you are who you\nsay you are that's that valid user.\n\n205\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.190\nOkay, are you who you say you are?\n\n206\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.939\nIf you're not you'll notice\nthat that arrow goes off.\n\n207\n00:12:50.939 --> 00:12:55.892\nAnd that arrow to the left of\nthe valid user goes down to no, and\n\n208\n00:12:55.892 --> 00:12:59.226\nthe same with do you have a valid request,\n\n209\n00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:02.580\nwell that would also\ngo down to no as well.\n\n210\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.190\nAnd you'll see that what should happen is,\n\n211\n00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:13.690\nif we follow those arrows down it actually\ncomes out to log and track access.\n\n212\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:19.277\nIn other words, at that point in time\nthe right hand dotted arrow to the right\n\n213\n00:13:19.277 --> 00:13:25.754\nof that log and track access, goes back up\nto security management information system.\n\n214\n00:13:25.754 --> 00:13:29.410\nSo we let security management know.\n\n215\n00:13:30.972 --> 00:13:34.630\nI'm gonna go back to that previous\nslide because this slide actually\n\n216\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.380\nis a little bit better in\nterms of scalability here.\n\n217\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.435\nCertainly it's better on\nmy eyesight anyway, okay?\n\n218\n00:13:42.435 --> 00:13:47.027\nSo, if you are who you say you are,\nand you do have a valid request,\n\n219\n00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:50.800\nthen I'm actually going to\ngrant that access, okay.\n\n220\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:56.304\nSo I'm either gonna give you access,\nor I'm gonna take access away,\n\n221\n00:13:56.304 --> 00:13:58.741\nand you'll see over on the left hand side,\n\n222\n00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:02.209\nif the request is too remove\naccess then we take access away.\n\n223\n00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:06.040\nAnd we update the security\nmanagement information system.\n\n224\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.220\nIf the request is to grant access\nthen we provide those rights, but\n\n225\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.860\nin every single instance\nwe will track access.\n\n226\n00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:21.380\nAnd we always ensure that the security\nmanagement is updated, always.\n\n227\n00:14:23.249 --> 00:14:28.751\nSo at the end of this process flow then\nwe'll report whether it's an incident.\n\n228\n00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:35.288\nNow you may choose to log any attempted\nbreach of security as an incident.\n\n229\n00:14:35.288 --> 00:14:37.569\nBut it would be a security type incident.\n\n230\n00:14:37.569 --> 00:14:38.729\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n231\n00:14:38.729 --> 00:14:42.545\n&gt;&gt; In the same way that we would\nlog whether we'd had hackers.\n\n232\n00:14:42.545 --> 00:14:43.137\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n233\n00:14:43.137 --> 00:14:46.370\n&gt;&gt; That have been trying to get in or\nwe would log a virus.\n\n234\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:51.130\nWe would log a breach by\nsomebody who's tried to gain\n\n235\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.950\naccess to something that they shouldn't\nhave tried to gain access to okay?\n\n236\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.836\nSo anything that is a reduction\nin the quality of a service, or\n\n237\n00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:03.594\nthat could impact a service\nwould be logged as an incident.\n\n238\n00:15:03.594 --> 00:15:06.929\nAnd then we close this access request.\n\n239\n00:15:06.929 --> 00:15:09.498\nNow the one thing that I do want to say,\nand\n\n240\n00:15:09.498 --> 00:15:13.684\nI say this at the end of every\nsingle process flow, we never, ever,\n\n241\n00:15:13.684 --> 00:15:17.545\never close a request until we\nconfirm that the user's happy.\n\n242\n00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:20.552\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now, I have a question for you.\n\n243\n00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:21.127\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n244\n00:15:21.127 --> 00:15:23.899\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's say, for instance,\n\n245\n00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:28.285\nsomebody was leaving our organization,\nand I was removing access.\n\n246\n00:15:28.285 --> 00:15:29.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n247\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.150\n&gt;&gt; Well I can't confirm that they're\nhappy can I because they're already gone,\n\n248\n00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.590\nand certainly if I tried to call them and\nsaid to them.\n\n249\n00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.000\nHey I've revoked your access\nare you happy with that?\n\n250\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.525\nThey would turn around, well they\nprobably wouldn't answer the phone.\n\n251\n00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:43.545\nI doubt they'd say no,\n\n252\n00:15:43.545 --> 00:15:46.665\nI think they'd probably say something\na little bit stronger than that.\n\n253\n00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:49.856\nSo who should I confirm this with then?\n\n254\n00:15:49.856 --> 00:15:53.860\n&gt;&gt; At this point we would probably\nconfirm it with a supervisor or\n\n255\n00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.094\na former supervisor of\ntheirs To verify whether or\n\n256\n00:15:57.094 --> 00:16:03.170\nnot their access has been removed\nthe way that we needed it to be removed.\n\n257\n00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what we would actually\ndo would be to define a policy.\n\n258\n00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n259\n00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have to have policies for\neverything they tell us how we should\n\n260\n00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.760\nperform these activities and also give\nus some form of consistency as well.\n\n261\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.963\nSo we'll have a policy that will say\neither we confirm with the line manager or\n\n262\n00:16:20.963 --> 00:16:25.970\nthat will tell us whether we\nconfirm with HR, for instance.\n\n263\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.540\nSo that would be in the policing.\n\n264\n00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.861\nSo I was only trying to trip you up there.\n\n265\n00:16:29.861 --> 00:16:31.963\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's okay.\n\n266\n00:16:31.963 --> 00:16:34.130\n[LAUGH] All right, Julia.\n\n267\n00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.300\nThat did trip me up just\na little bit as I think about it.\n\n268\n00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.890\nBut what you said there and understand\nthat a policy should be in place,\n\n269\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.530\nthese are things I've actually seen\nbefore and probably just forgot.\n\n270\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.130\nThe very fact that somebody is let go, we\nnormally get something that is, at least\n\n271\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.820\nfor me, it's been an email that said,\nhere's the access that this user needs to\n\n272\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:58.220\nbe removed from and confirm with me or\nreply back to this email once its done.\n\n273\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.350\nSo that, actually, have been part of\na policy that has been in place for.\n\n274\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.683\nSo, Jo, anything else that we need\nto consider in terms of this idea of\n\n275\n00:17:06.683 --> 00:17:07.310\n[CROSSTALK]?\n\n276\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:11.189\n&gt;&gt; Well, I just wanna mention while\nyou're talking about policies there,\n\n277\n00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:15.280\njust remember, I always tell people\nto use the common sense approach.\n\n278\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.579\nAnd the common sense approach\nis most policies evolve.\n\n279\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.210\nAnd so when you say to me,\nwell I got an e-mail about this and\n\n280\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.700\nso I suppose we should have a policy,\nthat probably was the policy,\n\n281\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.320\nand it's just evolved over time.\n\n282\n00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.750\nWhat we will tell you though is it makes\nbest practice to document any policies.\n\n283\n00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.090\nBut, that's still, nevertheless, a policy,\nand it's something that you adhered to.\n\n284\n00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.270\nIt was something that happened\non a consistent basis.\n\n285\n00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.560\nI wouldn't say a regular basis,\n\n286\n00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.320\ncuz it depends how quickly\npeople left the organization.\n\n287\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.350\nBut, nevertheless, if it was the same\nprocess that happened every time,\n\n288\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:55.150\nthen there's your consistency,\nand there was a policy in place.\n\n289\n00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.860\nIt just needed more formalization.\n\n290\n00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.800\nSo in this next slide,\nwe actually look at sort of\n\n291\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.770\nformalizing some of the inputs and\nthe outputs to the process.\n\n292\n00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:11.590\nYou cannot define a process until\nyou understand what do you want that\n\n293\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.095\nprocess to achieve.\n\n294\n00:18:13.095 --> 00:18:18.169\nWhen we look back at foundation\nmaterial and when we look back at so\n\n295\n00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:23.248\nthe service management as a practice\nwhich is in the introductory\n\n296\n00:18:23.248 --> 00:18:29.273\nmodule to service operation, you'll\nsee that we have to define processes.\n\n297\n00:18:29.273 --> 00:18:32.828\nAnd in order to define a process,\nwe have to, first of all,\n\n298\n00:18:32.828 --> 00:18:36.370\nunderstand what the objective\nof that process is.\n\n299\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:40.420\nAnd then we work out what the outputs are\nthat are required from the processes, and\n\n300\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.810\ntherefore, what the inputs are.\n\n301\n00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.990\nAnd so, access management is no different.\n\n302\n00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.620\nWhat do we expect our outputs to be?\n\n303\n00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.500\nWell, our outputs would be\neither a granted right or\n\n304\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.480\na right that's been removed.\n\n305\n00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.720\nSo it's about either providing\na service or taking a service away.\n\n306\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.500\nSo the inputs are simply the requests, and\n\n307\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:05.090\nwe also consider the services that we'll\ntarget and the security policy as well.\n\n308\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.850\nSo the triggers are what\nstarts off that process,\n\n309\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:12.590\nthe process doesn't just happen,\nit's what starts off the process,\n\n310\n00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.180\nand all of these have to be understood\nbefore we can define a process.\n\n311\n00:19:18.265 --> 00:19:21.625\nSo now what I'm going to do,\nif it's all right with you,\n\n312\n00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:26.250\nis I wanna talk a little bit about\nrelationships between these processes.\n\n313\n00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.750\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; Because we've talked about, in fact,\n\n314\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.800\nwe've talked quite extensively\nabout the relationship between\n\n315\n00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.150\nour security management.\n\n316\n00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.170\nAnd I know that in previous modules we've\ntalked extensively about relationships\n\n317\n00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:43.430\nwith service asset and configuration\nmanagement because we have to have that\n\n318\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:48.700\naccurate and reliable information from\nour configuration management system.\n\n319\n00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.090\nBut let's take a look at\nsomething that's unexpected.\n\n320\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.840\nWe've mentioned service level management\nand we've mentioned request fulfillment.\n\n321\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.950\nWhat about strategy management then?\n\n322\n00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.130\nThat seems slightly bizarre.\n\n323\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.400\nBut it's not,\nbecause in Strategy Management and\n\n324\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.890\nalso in what we call\nBusiness Relationship Management,\n\n325\n00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:10.680\nboth of which are within the service\nstrategy lifecycle phase.\n\n326\n00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.810\nIn both of these processes,\nwe're interfacing with the business\n\n327\n00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:20.920\non a strategic level, understanding\nthe strategy for the organization.\n\n328\n00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:27.160\nPart of that strategy is the security\nlevel that that organization requires?\n\n329\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.330\nIt doesn't matter what\nyour organization is.\n\n330\n00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.380\nYou've got a level of security\nthat you have to comply with.\n\n331\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.220\nAnd so\nstrategy management sets that direction.\n\n332\n00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:42.220\nIt tells us what security level,\n\n333\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.160\nexcuse me, [LAUGH] what security level\nwe need, in conjunction with business\n\n334\n00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.850\nsecurity management and therefore,\nIT security management too.\n\n335\n00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.570\nThe other thing the Strategy Management\ndoes for us is Strategy Management sets\n\n336\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.600\na direction,\ntells us what's happening in the future.\n\n337\n00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.452\nBecause what's happening in the future\ncould really have a huge impact to us in\n\n338\n00:21:03.452 --> 00:21:04.197\nsecurity.\n\n339\n00:21:04.197 --> 00:21:10.405\nLets say that we bring in, I don't know,\nmaybe we acquire another organization or\n\n340\n00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:14.856\ntheres some merger that happens\nwithin the organization.\n\n341\n00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:18.064\nThat's gonna have a huge big\nimpact on security, and therefore,\n\n342\n00:21:18.064 --> 00:21:19.391\nin access management too.\n\n343\n00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:23.626\nAnd there are not only policy decisions\nthat have to be made, but there's also\n\n344\n00:21:23.626 --> 00:21:28.970\nsome work that has to be done, as well,\nin granting access and taking access away.\n\n345\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.630\nNow, it's not often, let's face it, that\nthe organization will come to us in IT and\n\n346\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:38.080\nask us for permission [LAUGH] and before\nthey acquire another organization or\n\n347\n00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.460\nbefore they merge with\nanother organization.\n\n348\n00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.910\nBut nevertheless, we need to be aware\nof the strategy as early as possible so\n\n349\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:51.900\nthat we can ensure that we can facilitate\nwhatever it is that's in their strategy.\n\n350\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:58.160\nSo let me take a look as we go around,\nclockwise, around this spiders web.\n\n351\n00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.340\nAnd we've looked at\nService Level Management, and\n\n352\n00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.030\nwe discussed the interaction with Request,\ncuz it's a request for access.\n\n353\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.860\nAnd we haven't taken taken\na look at Demand Management.\n\n354\n00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:13.536\nDemand management is the process\nthat sits within the service\n\n355\n00:22:13.536 --> 00:22:18.340\nstrategy life cycle phase,\nwhere we understand and\n\n356\n00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.285\nwe analyze the users demand for services.\n\n357\n00:22:22.285 --> 00:22:26.266\nAnd in Demand Management,\nwe don't just increase capacity,\n\n358\n00:22:26.266 --> 00:22:29.745\nthat's part of Capacity Management,\nfor instance.\n\n359\n00:22:29.745 --> 00:22:37.689\nBut we look for ways of influencing use of\nbehavior to meet capacity requirements.\n\n360\n00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:44.300\nThat sounds fairly complicated, so\nlet's think about this in a non IT way.\n\n361\n00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.671\nSometimes, certain times of the year,\nyou'll get on a plane and\n\n362\n00:22:49.671 --> 00:22:51.089\nyou'll fly somewhere.\n\n363\n00:22:51.089 --> 00:22:53.655\nSay we were going to New York and\n\n364\n00:22:53.655 --> 00:22:58.702\nthat seat from here might cost you,\nsay, $200 one way?\n\n365\n00:22:58.702 --> 00:22:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n366\n00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.710\n&gt;&gt; So let's say we wanted\nto travel Christmas Eve,\n\n367\n00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.660\nhow much would it cost you then?\n\n368\n00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.620\n&gt;&gt; I'm double, I would assume.\n\n369\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:10.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so\ndo you get a better seat?\n\n370\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.091\n&gt;&gt; No, you're getting in the same seat.\n\n371\n00:23:11.091 --> 00:23:13.095\n&gt;&gt; You're getting in the same seat.\n\n372\n00:23:13.095 --> 00:23:15.769\nWhat about meal,\nare you getting champagne and caviar?\n\n373\n00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.280\n&gt;&gt; You better belive it, no, no.\n\n374\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.050\n&gt;&gt; You're getting that same\nbag of peanuts, are not you?\n\n375\n00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.330\nSo why do they charge more money then?\n\n376\n00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.740\n&gt;&gt; Demand.\n\n377\n00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwe call that differential charging.\n\n378\n00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n379\n00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.510\nit's a technique in Demand Management.\n\n380\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:34.350\nAnd it's a technique that we use when we\nknow that there's an increased demand,\n\n381\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.460\nand we don't have the capacity\nto meet the demand.\n\n382\n00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.400\nAnd so we set a different price.\n\n383\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.180\nAnd the aim is to try and\neven out the demand.\n\n384\n00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.520\nSo to discourage people from traveling\nthe day before Christmas, and actually,\n\n385\n00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.410\nencourage them to travel,\nsay, a week earlier.\n\n386\n00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.610\nSo we'll increase the price for\nChristmas Eve to try and\n\n387\n00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.190\ndiscourage people from traveling.\n\n388\n00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.367\nThat's why they do it.\n\n389\n00:23:57.367 --> 00:23:58.950\nSo nothing to do with profits.\n\n390\n00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:03.525\n[LAUGH] Absolutely everything to do\nwith evening out what we call peaks and\n\n391\n00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:04.201\ntroughs.\n\n392\n00:24:04.201 --> 00:24:11.040\nWe can do that in IT as well,\nand we do that in IT.\n\n393\n00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.800\nSometimes we do it and\nwe don't realise it, but\n\n394\n00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.060\nquite often it's a conscious decision.\n\n395\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.100\nSo lets say a Monday\nmorning comes around and\n\n396\n00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.824\nwe know that everybody comes\nin to work on Monday morning.\n\n397\n00:24:21.824 --> 00:24:24.550\nAnd they all start work at 8 AM and\n\n398\n00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.030\nthe first thing that they\ndo is log onto their email.\n\n399\n00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:34.020\nEverybody at 8 AM is downloading\nemail from the server, so guess what?\n\n400\n00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.530\nNetwork traffic is pretty busy.\n\n401\n00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.480\nBandwidth is utilized by the email server.\n\n402\n00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.820\nBut we might have one group of people,\nlet's say our sales team or\n\n403\n00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.860\nour marketing team, that might need to\nbe able to download their emails quicker\n\n404\n00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.980\nbecause they've got to get out and\nget on the road.\n\n405\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.610\nSo what we do is we give\npriority on that network for\n\n406\n00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.239\nmaybe that hour to our sales team and\nour marketing team.\n\n407\n00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.351\nAnd guess what we use in order to do that?\n\n408\n00:25:01.989 --> 00:25:05.289\nWe use access management to do that, yeah.\n\n409\n00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:08.606\nWe do that by using user profiles.\n\n410\n00:25:08.606 --> 00:25:14.365\nSo access management and demand management\nactually have a very good relationship.\n\n411\n00:25:14.365 --> 00:25:18.455\nWhere we utilize demand\nmanagement to influence behavior,\n\n412\n00:25:18.455 --> 00:25:22.115\nwe will more often than not do\nit through access management.\n\n413\n00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:27.705\nSo then we have that interaction\nwith change management.\n\n414\n00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.490\nIf there is any change to\nthe definition of a profile\n\n415\n00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.440\nit's a change to our infrastructure.\n\n416\n00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.230\nSo therefore that has to go\nthrough change management.\n\n417\n00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.040\nSo if we have new teams,\nif we have new profiles,\n\n418\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.528\nit has to go through change management.\n\n419\n00:25:43.528 --> 00:25:49.670\nService continuity management and\ninformation security management,\n\n420\n00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.730\nwell they both have policies for\nthe continuity of our services.\n\n421\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.620\nAnd very similar to\navailability management,\n\n422\n00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:01.330\nif security is breached then that could\naffect the availability of our services.\n\n423\n00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:07.970\nSo we have to ensure that we remember\nto include security and continuity.\n\n424\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:13.150\nBecause access, giving the wrong access to\nthe wrong person could affect continuity.\n\n425\n00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.760\nAnd of course, our service catalog\nis our list of our services.\n\n426\n00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.130\nSo that will tell us what services\nwe need to have access control over.\n\n427\n00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.570\nSo what about metrics then?\n\n428\n00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.590\nCritical success factors.\n\n429\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.930\nWe've looked in previous modules\nabout critical success factors and\n\n430\n00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.680\nwhat they are, and\nit's something that we have to achieve.\n\n431\n00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.280\nAnd we've mentioned that critical success\nfactors are generally intangible.\n\n432\n00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.730\nAnd if you look at the CSFs that we\nhave here, which is just an example,\n\n433\n00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:47.420\nwe talk about maintaining CIA or\ntimely communication.\n\n434\n00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.958\nWell you see that the KPIs that talk\nabout timely all have something to\n\n435\n00:26:52.958 --> 00:26:59.760\ndo with providing access or taking access\naway within those service level targets.\n\n436\n00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.053\nThey're the ones that\nare agreed in our SLAs.\n\n437\n00:27:03.053 --> 00:27:06.238\nWe also have KPIs to deal with CIA, and\n\n438\n00:27:06.238 --> 00:27:11.815\nthose KPIs look at allocation of\ninappropriate security access,\n\n439\n00:27:11.815 --> 00:27:16.710\nwhere it's been given and\nit shouldn't have been given.\n\n440\n00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.040\nThe number of audit findings,\nfor instance,\n\n441\n00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.020\nthat have brought up discrepancies.\n\n442\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:29.710\nWhat about incidents that\nare raised to reset passwords?\n\n443\n00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.380\nNow, we mentioned when we\nlooked at request fulfillment,\n\n444\n00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.760\nwe mentioned that dilemma.\n\n445\n00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.720\nIs it an incident, or is it a password?\n\n446\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.330\nBecause it's an interruption to a service.\n\n447\n00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.280\nSo is it an incident, or is it a request?\n\n448\n00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.990\nWell that's down to your policies,\nit's to how you define that.\n\n449\n00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.240\nBut you see, if we reset\nthe password too many times for\n\n450\n00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.320\na particular user,\nthere's something wrong.\n\n451\n00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.630\nEither there's something wrong\nwith our security policy that\n\n452\n00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.090\nthey can't remember their password.\n\n453\n00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.350\nAnd sometimes security becomes so\nsecure it becomes insecure.\n\n454\n00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:07.980\nYou know those security policies\nthat require an uppercase letter and\n\n455\n00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:13.310\na lowercase letter and a special character\nand they've gotta be 16 characters long\n\n456\n00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.690\nand you can't have 2 consecutive\ncharacters the same.\n\n457\n00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.310\nAnd, you've got to have\nat least five numbers.\n\n458\n00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.838\nAnd what's the solution to that?\n\n459\n00:28:21.838 --> 00:28:24.200\nI know, a post-it note.\n\n460\n00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.560\nThat's the solution to that.\n\n461\n00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.787\nYou know, the one that get's\nstuck on top of the screen.\n\n462\n00:28:27.787 --> 00:28:31.873\nSo we become so secure we become insecure.\n\n463\n00:28:31.873 --> 00:28:35.188\nIf we keep forgetting our passwords,\nit's because they are difficult for\n\n464\n00:28:35.188 --> 00:28:37.920\nus to remember, but\ntechnology will help us with that.\n\n465\n00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.912\nNowadays we have\nfingerprint recognition and\n\n466\n00:28:40.912 --> 00:28:45.443\na lot of other things that we cando\ninstead of remembering a password.\n\n467\n00:28:45.443 --> 00:28:49.037\nSo you see they give off\nthe opportunity to improve, but\n\n468\n00:28:49.037 --> 00:28:54.315\nit's access management that provides\nsecurity management with the information\n\n469\n00:28:54.315 --> 00:28:59.536\non how many incidents there are to do with\nsay forgotten passwords for instance.\n\n470\n00:28:59.536 --> 00:29:04.572\nAnd also security gets wind of\nthe fact that a lot of passwords\n\n471\n00:29:04.572 --> 00:29:09.705\nare being reset at a certain time\nof day or by a certain person,\n\n472\n00:29:09.705 --> 00:29:16.260\nthen it may be that somebody is requesting\naccess that they shouldn't have.\n\n473\n00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.960\nMaybe access to someone else's user ID.\n\n474\n00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.150\nCuz of course, the one thing that we\nreally don't encourage is the sharing of\n\n475\n00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:22.750\nuser IDs.\n\n476\n00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.790\nSo access management then is\nall about giving access and\n\n477\n00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.030\nit's all about taking it away.\n\n478\n00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.710\nAnd the challenge is that we\nhave to get over are things like\n\n479\n00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.310\nverifying that that person\nis who they say they are.\n\n480\n00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:40.340\nYou know, I've known some organizations\nwhere they will actually ask you\n\n481\n00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.600\nto come to the service desk\nwith your driver's license.\n\n482\n00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.270\nIn fact I have worked in\ngovernment organizations and\n\n483\n00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:54.510\nmy role is head of IT services for\nHer Majesty's Treasury and the OGC.\n\n484\n00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:58.610\nWe had policies in place where you had\nto come with your government approved\n\n485\n00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.390\nID in order to have your password reset\n\n486\n00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:06.170\nbecause we needed to ensure that\nyou are who you said you were.\n\n487\n00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.740\nAnd irrespective of what your\nposition was within the country,\n\n488\n00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.100\nwe needed to be able to determine\nthat you were who you said you were.\n\n489\n00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.550\nCuz giving access away to the wrong\nperson could be quite catastrophic for\n\n490\n00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.190\nthe nation's finances.\n\n491\n00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.520\nSo, that is a huge, big challenge to us.\n\n492\n00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.380\nAnd managing those rights and restricting.\n\n493\n00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.321\nHave you ever to turn around to somebody\nand say no, you can't have access?\n\n494\n00:30:31.321 --> 00:30:34.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever tried to say to a prime\n\n495\n00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:38.220\nminister, well I'd really need you to come\ndown to the service desk with your ID\n\n496\n00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.600\nbefore I reset your password?\n\n497\n00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.290\nIt's a challenge [LAUGH].\n\n498\n00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.460\nBut, of course,\nthere are risks associated, too.\n\n499\n00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:51.550\nAnd these are things that could help\nus fail [LAUGH] with access management.\n\n500\n00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.530\nAnd not that we ever need\nany help in failing, but\n\n501\n00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.890\nthings like the technology that we have.\n\n502\n00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.340\nIf we don't have technology to\nfacilitate this then it's very,\n\n503\n00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.420\nvery difficult to enforce\naccess management.\n\n504\n00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.620\nTo enforce somebody to come down and\nbring their user ID, for instance.\n\n505\n00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.220\nWhat if they're 500 miles away?\n\n506\n00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.890\nWe have to have the technology\nthat can help us support that,\n\n507\n00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:20.870\nbecause the thing that we don't\nwant is sort of backdoor access.\n\n508\n00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.050\nWe don't want people\ngranting access just because\n\n509\n00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.965\nI think it sounded like them on the phone.\n\n510\n00:31:26.965 --> 00:31:30.272\nWe've got to monitor\nthat backdoor access and\n\n511\n00:31:30.272 --> 00:31:34.099\nthe access that comes in from\nall the sources as well.\n\n512\n00:31:34.099 --> 00:31:36.958\nSo in a nutshell,\nthat is access management.\n\n513\n00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:40.377\nAnd now what we'd like you\nto do is to go back and\n\n514\n00:31:40.377 --> 00:31:45.640\ntake a look at the notes that you have\navailable to you with this class and\n\n515\n00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.230\ndo some self-study on access management.\n\n516\n00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.740\nAnd I'd really like you\nto specifically focus on\n\n517\n00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.980\nthe challenges of access management\nwithin your organization.\n\n518\n00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.930\nAnd yes,\n\n519\n00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:02.700\nwe acknowledge that there is a huge,\nbig relationship into security management.\n\n520\n00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.170\nBecause without having that defined\nprocess within security management,\n\n521\n00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:11.230\nthen it's gonna be very,\nvery difficult to ensure that we maintain\n\n522\n00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:15.130\nthe right level of access that will allow\nus to be secure in our environment.\n\n523\n00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.052\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well, thank you again for\n\n524\n00:32:19.052 --> 00:32:23.849\nhelping us out when it comes to access\nmanagement and understanding that\n\n525\n00:32:23.849 --> 00:32:28.030\nprocess much better than what we\nhad before we began this show.\n\n526\n00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.620\nRemember that we took a look\nat the basic principles,\n\n527\n00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.305\nas well as the process flow and,\nof course, even the matrix that we've been\n\n528\n00:32:34.305 --> 00:32:37.145\ntalking about as well throughout\nthis entire series too.\n\n529\n00:32:37.145 --> 00:32:41.400\nAnd all these are great things that we\nhave to keep in mind as we continue in our\n\n530\n00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.930\ncareer towards more ITIL knowledge.\n\n531\n00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.670\nAnd that's a great place for\nus to also sign off then.\n\n532\n00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.650\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n533\n00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:50.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n534\n00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:55.093\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation

00:00:08.236\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:12.239\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.705\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.759\nyou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.690\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\nbeginning a new process, taking a look at\n\n8\n00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.560\ncommon service activities, specifically\naddressing monitoring and controls.\n\n9\n00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.406\nAnd here to help us once again is gonna be\nour our girl wonder in ITIL Jo Peacock,\n\n10\n00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:38.070\nJo, welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.231\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,\ngreat to be here again, Ronnie, and\n\n12\n00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:45.244\nI just want to say that you can carry on\ncalling me a girl as long as you like.\n\n13\n00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:47.381\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; If you could shave a few years off\n\n14\n00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:50.917\nwith every single session,\nI would be really grateful.\n\n15\n00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:51.458\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n16\n00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:53.680\nnow I wish I actually had that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.460\n&gt;&gt; Magical ability to do that for\n\n18\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.900\nall of us but, the ability that\nI do have though is to at least\n\n19\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.720\nturn over this show to you as we begin.\n\n20\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.850\nWe'll talk about monitoring and\ncontrolling, so\n\n21\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.302\nthis is gonna be a new process for\nme in terms of understanding anything.\n\n22\n00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:12.465\nSo Jo, where are we beginning?\n\n23\n00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:16.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, this isn't actually a process.\n\n24\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n25\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.500\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n26\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.072\n&gt;&gt; What we're doing now,\n\n27\n00:01:19.072 --> 00:01:23.158\nthe next three sections or\nsessions that we will be covering,\n\n28\n00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:27.290\nare what we call our common\nservice operation activities.\n\n29\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.747\nSo these are common activities\nthat are found within the service\n\n30\n00:01:30.747 --> 00:01:32.162\noperation environment.\n\n31\n00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:37.474\nSo, that business as usual live\nenvironment, so, these aren't processes,\n\n32\n00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:41.694\nthese are activities that\nare specific to each organization.\n\n33\n00:01:41.694 --> 00:01:46.773\nAnd, all we can do with these\nparticular activities is just\n\n34\n00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:52.564\ngive you examples of what we expect\nto see in any live organization,\n\n35\n00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:55.928\nin any business as usual environment.\n\n36\n00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:59.275\nNow, they will appear in any shape or\nform,\n\n37\n00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:04.078\nin some guise or another, but\nthey are going to appear, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:09.166\nSo as it says here, activities\nare generally technical in nature,\n\n39\n00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:13.915\nso they're going to vary from\norganization to organization.\n\n40\n00:02:13.915 --> 00:02:19.400\nThey're there to integrate our technology\nand the processes and the people.\n\n41\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.820\nSo really, our technology is here\nto facilitate those processes,\n\n42\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.105\nit's also here to deliver services and\nfacilitate outcomes for the customers.\n\n43\n00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:35.649\nAnd these activities are just the things\nthat we do generally as we said, technical\n\n44\n00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:41.980\nin nature, so they don't necessarily\nhave a process purpose to them.\n\n45\n00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.376\nBut they are a means to an end, so they're\nsomething that we do because we need to.\n\n46\n00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:52.007\nSo the first one that we're going to look\nat it, and in this particular section\n\n47\n00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:55.954\nhere, we're going to concentrate on\nwhat we call monitoring and control.\n\n48\n00:02:55.954 --> 00:03:00.905\nAnd as it says there, it's a continual\ncycle of monitoring, reporting and action,\n\n49\n00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:03.400\nso Ronnie, I'm gonna put you on the spot.\n\n50\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.684\n&gt;&gt; Sure thing.\n\n51\n00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.907\n&gt;&gt; Okay, how good are you\nat dictionary definitions?\n\n52\n00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:10.757\n&gt;&gt; I am terrible at dictionary\ndefinitions, but I will try and\n\n53\n00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:11.443\ngive you one.\n\n54\n00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:12.811\n&gt;&gt; Okay, excellent.\n\n55\n00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:15.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So do you know what the difference is\n\n56\n00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.635\nbetween continuous and continual?\n\n57\n00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:21.725\n&gt;&gt; Continuous and continual,\nI don't think I do,\n\n58\n00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:26.330\nI'm trying to think here,\nno, I don't, yeah.\n\n59\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.117\n&gt;&gt; Okay, not to worry, because not\nmany other people do either, and\n\n60\n00:03:31.117 --> 00:03:34.965\nin fact they tend to be words\nthat we use interchangeably,\n\n61\n00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:39.625\nthinking that they both mean pretty\nmuch the same thing, but they don't.\n\n62\n00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:46.355\nContinuous means ongoing, all the time,\nwhereas continual is iterative,\n\n63\n00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:50.509\nit takes one step at a time,\nit's repeatable.\n\n64\n00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.802\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's the difference between driving and\n\n65\n00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:53.306\nwalking.\n\n66\n00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:54.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n67\n00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.879\n&gt;&gt; When you're driving, your wheels are\nconstantly turning, continuously turning.\n\n68\n00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.767\nSo, maybe you want to get,\nlet's say you want to get over there,\n\n69\n00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:07.430\nthat's where you want to go,\nin that general direction.\n\n70\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.120\nAnd you've got an endpoint in mind and\nyou could drive, but\n\n71\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.460\nthen you never really get a true\npicture of exactly where you are.\n\n72\n00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.568\nBecause by the time you have looked\nat your GPS, it's got its signal from\n\n73\n00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:27.210\nthe satellite somewhere up in the ether,\nand that signals bounced back to you.\n\n74\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.258\nYour wheels have actually moved on,\nso it's never truly accurate,\n\n75\n00:04:32.258 --> 00:04:37.217\nand how many times have you gone past\nthat turn in that you wanted to go\n\n76\n00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:42.375\ndown before you've realized that\nyou needed to go down that turning.\n\n77\n00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:47.790\nSo it's not so easy to change direction\neither when we're moving continuously.\n\n78\n00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.205\nAnd then there's walking,\nnow walking is an iterative process,\n\n79\n00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:57.196\nit's continual, it's step by step.\n\n80\n00:04:57.196 --> 00:05:03.245\nBut with every single step that I take,\nI have got an exact point in time,\n\n81\n00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:08.698\nI know exactly where I am so\nI know exactly how far I've got to go and\n\n82\n00:05:08.698 --> 00:05:12.095\nhow far I've been, how far I've come.\n\n83\n00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:16.390\nSo it's an iterative process,\nit's step by step, and you know what?\n\n84\n00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.409\nI can change direction with the next step,\nit's easy.\n\n85\n00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:21.284\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n86\n00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:27.253\nSo, we still get to the same end point,\nbut we do it in an iterative way,\n\n87\n00:05:27.253 --> 00:05:33.350\nwhich is why we talk here about\nthe continual cycle of monitoring.\n\n88\n00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.667\nIt's not continuous,\nit's continual, it's repeatable,\n\n89\n00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:40.361\nit's iterative, it's step by step.\n\n90\n00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:45.079\nMonitoring and action, so\nwhen monitoring something and\n\n91\n00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:48.651\nthen we're doing something about it here.\n\n92\n00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:52.109\nNow we've got a process that\nactually helps us with that, and\n\n93\n00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:55.780\nthe process tells us how to do it,\nand this is actually what we do.\n\n94\n00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.124\nAnd of course,\nthat process is event management, and\n\n95\n00:05:59.124 --> 00:06:03.267\nI told you when we looked at event\nmanagement in a previous session,\n\n96\n00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:07.010\nI mentioned that event management\nmay be fully automated.\n\n97\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.702\nAnd monitoring and control is\nsomething that may be fully automated,\n\n98\n00:06:11.702 --> 00:06:14.095\nthis is exactly what we'd expect.\n\n99\n00:06:14.095 --> 00:06:17.346\nSo monitoring and control,\n\n100\n00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:22.090\nI expect this to be a closed loop process.\n\n101\n00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.038\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n102\n00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:29.360\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to take us back to a previous\nsession, and in Event Management,\n\n103\n00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.274\nI mentioned the difference between\na thermostat and a thermometer.\n\n104\n00:06:34.274 --> 00:06:39.234\nAnd I referred to a thermometer as just\nbeing something that we keep on the wall\n\n105\n00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:43.220\nand that tells us exactly what\nthe temperatures is right now.\n\n106\n00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.450\nAnd I said that's just monitored, it's not\ndoing anything else other than monitoring.\n\n107\n00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.568\nWhereas a thermostat actually tells us\nwhat the temperature is on the wall and\n\n108\n00:06:53.568 --> 00:06:57.979\nthen adjusts the heating or\nthe air conditioning depending on what\n\n109\n00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.383\nthe temperature is and\nwhat parameter we've set.\n\n110\n00:07:01.383 --> 00:07:05.714\nWell that's what we call\na closed loop system,\n\n111\n00:07:05.714 --> 00:07:09.396\nan open loop system actually responds to\n\n112\n00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:14.182\nthe fact that the temperature\nhas dropped in a room.\n\n113\n00:07:14.182 --> 00:07:17.408\nAnd we'd do something like,\nwe'd go and light a fire or\n\n114\n00:07:17.408 --> 00:07:20.167\nwe turn a heater on ourselves,\nwe light a fire.\n\n115\n00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:25.659\nNow there's nothing that turns that fire\noff, when we light a fire in a room,\n\n116\n00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:30.074\nit's open loop,\nit's a one-off activity that we go and do.\n\n117\n00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:33.663\nAnd if we look at the thermometer on\nthe wall, the thermometer will change,\n\n118\n00:07:33.663 --> 00:07:37.383\nit will gradually start to get hotter and\nthen it will carry on getting hotter.\n\n119\n00:07:37.383 --> 00:07:41.508\nAnd it doesn't start to get any cooler\nuntil we can't just suddenly turn off\n\n120\n00:07:41.508 --> 00:07:44.738\nthe heat, right, we have to wait for\nthat fire to die down.\n\n121\n00:07:44.738 --> 00:07:48.667\nThat's what we call an open loop\nsystem it's one specific task, and\n\n122\n00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:52.610\nas it says there, it's independent\nof any other influence, okay.\n\n123\n00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.598\nWhereas a closed loop system,\n\n124\n00:07:54.598 --> 00:07:59.040\nwell that thermostat that we have on\nthe wall is a closed loop system.\n\n125\n00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.618\nAnd I just wanna take you to that\nparticular diagram there, and\n\n126\n00:08:02.618 --> 00:08:04.791\non the right-hand side of the slide.\n\n127\n00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:07.665\nAnd we start off With the norm, and\n\n128\n00:08:07.665 --> 00:08:12.334\nthe norm is the temperature\nthat we have set in the room.\n\n129\n00:08:12.334 --> 00:08:16.331\nSo we've set that temperature to,\nand let's work in Fahrenheit here,\n\n130\n00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:19.258\nwe set this temperature to say,\n72 Fahrenheit.\n\n131\n00:08:19.258 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd all the time, we are monitoring\nthe temperature in the room.\n\n132\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:29.568\nAnd we're comparing to that\nstandard that we've set of 72.\n\n133\n00:08:29.568 --> 00:08:32.556\nAnd if it falls below,\nthen we move over to control.\n\n134\n00:08:32.556 --> 00:08:38.808\nIt falls below 72, so we come down to\nthat activity and we turn on the heating.\n\n135\n00:08:38.808 --> 00:08:43.020\nAnd then we're monitoring and\ncomparing against the norm.\n\n136\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.890\nAnd when it reaches 72,\n\n137\n00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:49.260\nthen the following control activity\nis to turn off the heating, okay?\n\n138\n00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.150\nSo what we have there is\na closed loop process.\n\n139\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:00.702\nNow the next slide then, whoa,\nthat looks a little bit worse I would say.\n\n140\n00:09:00.702 --> 00:09:03.678\nSo this is what we call\na complex monitor control loop.\n\n141\n00:09:03.678 --> 00:09:06.339\nSo I want you to take a look at it.\n\n142\n00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:09.584\nAgain, I'm gonna use\nthe analogy of heating,\n\n143\n00:09:09.584 --> 00:09:13.190\nbecause it seems to make sense for\neverybody.\n\n144\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.976\nSo you have to tell me if it's not making\nsense for you, because I can try and\n\n145\n00:09:16.976 --> 00:09:19.914\ndo something else if you want, okay?\n\n146\n00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:23.441\nBut let's take a look at the top\nright-hand side there then.\n\n147\n00:09:23.441 --> 00:09:26.880\nThe top right-hand side,\nyou'll see exactly the same things here.\n\n148\n00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.738\nSo we've got our norm, which is what\nwe've set, that's our temperature of 72.\n\n149\n00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:35.518\nAnd then we are continually,\ncontinually not continuously,\n\n150\n00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:37.960\nmonitoring against that norm.\n\n151\n00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.828\nBut you'll see we have individual\nmonitor control loops underneath.\n\n152\n00:09:43.828 --> 00:09:49.218\nWell let's say, for instance,\nin the last slide we just did one room.\n\n153\n00:09:49.218 --> 00:09:53.489\nNow we're going to do a whole building.\n\n154\n00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:58.001\nAnd each individual room\nhas its own thermostat.\n\n155\n00:09:58.001 --> 00:10:02.490\nSo for the entire building there,\nwe want to maintain\n\n156\n00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.292\nthe temperature across all\nof the rooms of 72 degrees.\n\n157\n00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.407\nSo we compare against\nthat norm of 72 degrees.\n\n158\n00:10:13.407 --> 00:10:18.309\nBut then what we will do, when it comes to\ncross to control, we could have one room\n\n159\n00:10:18.309 --> 00:10:22.864\nsay, that room on the left that's\na little bit warmer than 72 degrees.\n\n160\n00:10:22.864 --> 00:10:29.527\nSo what we might do there is we might\nchoose to put the air conditioning on.\n\n161\n00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:33.681\nThe room in the middle, well, that\nactually might be perfect at 72 degrees,\n\n162\n00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:35.580\nso we'll choose to do nothing.\n\n163\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.989\nBut the room on the right-hand side,\n\n164\n00:10:37.989 --> 00:10:41.700\nwell that actually might fall\nway below the 72 degrees.\n\n165\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.865\nWhich is what's causing the entire\nbuilding to fall below that 72 degrees, so\n\n166\n00:10:45.865 --> 00:10:47.900\nwe'll increase the heat in that room.\n\n167\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.097\nAnd we'll monitor until it\nreaches the desired temperature.\n\n168\n00:10:52.097 --> 00:10:57.681\nBut over all, in that top right-hand\ncorner what we're doing is,\n\n169\n00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:00.992\nwe are monitoring the entire building.\n\n170\n00:11:00.992 --> 00:11:06.255\nAnd then we are adjusting the controls\nin each room to ensure that\n\n171\n00:11:06.255 --> 00:11:11.136\nthe entire building maintains\na consistent temperature.\n\n172\n00:11:11.136 --> 00:11:17.720\nSo this is a closed loop system, but it's\nwhat we call a complex closed loop system.\n\n173\n00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.657\nA complex monitor control loop.\n\n174\n00:11:21.964 --> 00:11:23.660\nSo now let's look at ITIL.\n\n175\n00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:30.577\nAnd ITIL itself is a monitor control loop.\n\n176\n00:11:30.577 --> 00:11:34.657\nWe start off, and\nactually what we've got here in\n\n177\n00:11:34.657 --> 00:11:39.126\nthe top right-hand corner\nis us starting off with, or\n\n178\n00:11:39.126 --> 00:11:44.196\nmonitoring from CSI,\nfrom continual service improvement.\n\n179\n00:11:44.196 --> 00:11:49.871\nBecause believe it or not, that's exactly\nwhat continual service improvement does,\n\n180\n00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:51.773\nit monitors against a norm.\n\n181\n00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:58.320\nAnd if we are not, that norm being aligned\nto the business, if we are not aligned\n\n182\n00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.980\nto the needs of the organization then\nwe may implement an improvement.\n\n183\n00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.494\nIn other words, we create an idea for\na new service or for\n\n184\n00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:10.630\nan amendment to a service and\nservice strategy.\n\n185\n00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.611\nWhich we then design in service design and\n\n186\n00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:18.380\nthen in service transition we build and\ntest and we deploy it.\n\n187\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.790\nAnd then on an ongoing basis we check\nthat that service is aligned to\n\n188\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.618\nthe needs of the business.\n\n189\n00:12:24.618 --> 00:12:27.348\nAnd then we go back to\nservice strategy and\n\n190\n00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:32.496\nmake any adjustments that we need to\nensure that the services that we deliver,\n\n191\n00:12:32.496 --> 00:12:37.806\nand what we have in the bottom of that\nslide there are three individual services.\n\n192\n00:12:37.806 --> 00:12:38.844\nFor example,\n\n193\n00:12:38.844 --> 00:12:44.648\nthat those three individual services\nare aligned to the needs of the business.\n\n194\n00:12:44.648 --> 00:12:48.388\nAnd what we have around\nthe outside of this complex,\n\n195\n00:12:48.388 --> 00:12:53.669\nthis service management monitor control\nloop are all of our influences.\n\n196\n00:12:53.669 --> 00:12:56.810\nInfluences from our business\nexecutives because, of course,\n\n197\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.496\nthey give us our preferences and\ntell us what we value.\n\n198\n00:12:59.496 --> 00:13:04.329\nInfluences from our users which\nset the level of warranty,\n\n199\n00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:07.625\nhow we're going to use those services.\n\n200\n00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:12.011\nInfluences from account management and\nour suppliers.\n\n201\n00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:16.891\nAnd also influences from our internal and\nexternal staff,\n\n202\n00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:21.378\nour experts that will tell us\nhow they want us to work and\n\n203\n00:13:21.378 --> 00:13:24.515\nhow we can work with that technology.\n\n204\n00:13:24.515 --> 00:13:31.430\nSo we start off with monitoring and\ncontrol in our service level agreement.\n\n205\n00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.988\nWell actually, we don't start off\nin the service level agreements,\n\n206\n00:13:34.988 --> 00:13:37.895\nwe start off,\nyou notice those different letter there?\n\n207\n00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:40.608\nThat's the service level requirement.\n\n208\n00:13:40.608 --> 00:13:45.198\nWe start by generating service level\nrequirements way back in the service\n\n209\n00:13:45.198 --> 00:13:47.050\ndesign life cycle phase.\n\n210\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.083\nAnd I want you to think of these service\nlevel requirements as a draft SLAs,\n\n211\n00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:53.240\nbecause that's what they are.\n\n212\n00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.609\nIt's where we document the initial\nrequirements of our customers and\n\n213\n00:13:57.609 --> 00:13:58.355\nour users.\n\n214\n00:13:58.355 --> 00:14:01.910\nAnd then over a period of time,\nthroughout design and\n\n215\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:06.150\ntransition, we negotiate\nthese service level targets.\n\n216\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.855\nAnd then as we move through early\nlife support, after deployment,\n\n217\n00:14:10.855 --> 00:14:15.641\nand we sign off that service level\nagreement, then the service level\n\n218\n00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:20.444\nrequirement actually becomes\nthe signed SLA after signing, okay?\n\n219\n00:14:20.444 --> 00:14:24.932\nSo the objectives, as it says for\nmonitoring and control,\n\n220\n00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:26.650\nbegins with the SLRs.\n\n221\n00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:31.640\nWhat that really means is, these SLRs tell\nus what level of service we're to provide.\n\n222\n00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.390\nAnd of course we've got to monitor\nagainst that level of service.\n\n223\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:40.330\nAnd we monitor both internally,\nwithin the technology, but\n\n224\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.690\nwe also monitor externally.\n\n225\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:48.065\nIn other words we monitor the services\nthat we are delivering as a whole,\n\n226\n00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:51.336\nirrespective of who owns that technology.\n\n227\n00:14:51.336 --> 00:14:56.844\nBecause both of those are very important,\nwe are delivering value to our users.\n\n228\n00:14:56.844 --> 00:14:58.665\nAnd we can't deliver value to our users,\n\n229\n00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:01.120\nif we're not keeping an eye\non what we're delivering.\n\n230\n00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.623\nSo we have different types of monitoring.\n\n231\n00:15:05.623 --> 00:15:07.523\nWe have what we call active monitoring.\n\n232\n00:15:07.523 --> 00:15:12.063\nAnd active monitoring is where we for\ninstance may monitor a server console for\n\n233\n00:15:12.063 --> 00:15:12.761\ninstance.\n\n234\n00:15:12.761 --> 00:15:17.267\nAnd we're sitting in front of that server\nconsole, and we're watching things happen.\n\n235\n00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:24.191\nPassive monitoring is where we're using\ntechnology to do that monitoring for us.\n\n236\n00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:29.179\nAnd it's feeding activities to\nan external, it says a listening device,\n\n237\n00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.889\nbut it could be a log file, for instance.\n\n238\n00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:36.100\nSo things like logging in and logging out.\n\n239\n00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.714\nWhen a user logs into a system and\nwhen they log out again, that's logged.\n\n240\n00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:45.185\nBut do we really need to know about that?\n\n241\n00:15:45.185 --> 00:15:46.647\nWell not at the moment, no.\n\n242\n00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:49.774\nBut somebody might ask us\nabout that at a later date.\n\n243\n00:15:49.774 --> 00:15:53.949\nSo we do passive monitoring\non those sort of activities.\n\n244\n00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:58.540\nAnd we might do passive monitoring, but I\nwould expect us to do active monitoring on\n\n245\n00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.435\nthings like backup starting and\nbackup finishing.\n\n246\n00:16:01.435 --> 00:16:06.650\nBecause we want to check that a backup\nstarted and that it's completed okay.\n\n247\n00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:10.701\nBut passive monitoring is any monitoring\nwhere we need to keep the results.\n\n248\n00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:11.630\nWe might need them.\n\n249\n00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.020\nWe might need to see who's had\naccess to our computer room, but\n\n250\n00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.460\nwe don't necessarily need\nto see them in real time.\n\n251\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.970\nThen we have reactive monitoring, and\nreactive monitoring responds to a trigger.\n\n252\n00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:29.000\nAnd that's where,\nlet's go back to that thermostat again.\n\n253\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.740\nIt clicks in, you hear an audible click\nusually when the thermostat kicks in,\n\n254\n00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.450\nbecause the temperature has got too warm.\n\n255\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.045\nAnd so the air conditioning has come\non and that might generate an alert.\n\n256\n00:16:40.045 --> 00:16:42.959\nThat might say, hey look,\nI've had to bring the air conditioning on.\n\n257\n00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:46.721\nNow, I have been and\nI have to confess this,\n\n258\n00:16:46.721 --> 00:16:52.445\nin my years as a mainframe operator\nwhich were a long, long time ago.\n\n259\n00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:57.375\nI was in a situation where a computer room\nof ours, or a machine room as we used to\n\n260\n00:16:57.375 --> 00:17:01.441\ncall it, where the air conditioning\nfailed in a computer room.\n\n261\n00:17:01.441 --> 00:17:05.049\nAnd when the air conditioning failed and\nthis was for\n\n262\n00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:09.484\na very, very, very large telecom\norganization within the UK.\n\n263\n00:17:09.484 --> 00:17:13.263\nWhen the air conditioning failed\nat the data center, we had to shut\n\n264\n00:17:13.263 --> 00:17:17.803\ndown the mainframe and that means shutting\ndown the entire telephone network.\n\n265\n00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:22.056\nThat was not something that I'd ever\nwish to experience again because\n\n266\n00:17:22.056 --> 00:17:27.175\nthe temperature in that computer room\nrose to well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit,\n\n267\n00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:29.020\nwell over that.\n\n268\n00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.635\nSo yeah, we want to generate an alert once\nsomething like that starts to happen.\n\n269\n00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:36.389\nProactive monitoring is\nabout detecting patterns.\n\n270\n00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:41.276\nIt's really about not just responding\nto triggers that happen, but\n\n271\n00:17:41.276 --> 00:17:48.360\nit's about detecting patterns and trend\nanalysis, that's proactive monitoring.\n\n272\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.680\nContinuous monitoring is\nmonitoring all the time.\n\n273\n00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.020\nRemember the difference\nbetween continuous and\n\n274\n00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.282\ncontinual, continuous\nmonitoring is all the time.\n\n275\n00:17:56.282 --> 00:18:01.116\nAnd exception-based monitoring is where we\njust simply report on things that happen\n\n276\n00:18:01.116 --> 00:18:03.072\nthat are different from the norm.\n\n277\n00:18:03.072 --> 00:18:07.636\nAnd, of course,\nwe can use any combination of those.\n\n278\n00:18:07.636 --> 00:18:12.310\nThere is no right or wrong, it's whatever\nis required for your organization.\n\n279\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.590\nSo, of course, what we have to do,\nis we have to measure.\n\n280\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.600\nWe measure what is happening.\n\n281\n00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.528\nThat's part of monitoring and control.\n\n282\n00:18:22.528 --> 00:18:26.710\nAnd measuring simply\nmeans that we understand\n\n283\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.830\nwhat parameters we are looking to take.\n\n284\n00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.310\nAnd the metrics are the actual\nnumbers that we physically take.\n\n285\n00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:42.960\nSo the measurements, for instance\nwe may measure when backup starts.\n\n286\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.116\nSo the measurements we take are when a\nbackup starts and when a backup finishes,\n\n287\n00:18:47.116 --> 00:18:48.677\nthey're the measurements.\n\n288\n00:18:48.677 --> 00:18:54.436\nThe metrics that we take are that\nthe backup started at 22:15 and\n\n289\n00:18:54.436 --> 00:18:56.629\nfinished at 02:17.\n\n290\n00:18:56.629 --> 00:19:00.160\nThey're the metrics,\nthe actual physical numbers.\n\n291\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.640\nAnd, of course, those key performance\nindicators, if we look in previous\n\n292\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.737\nsections, we've actually seen examples\nof key performance indicators.\n\n293\n00:19:08.737 --> 00:19:13.593\nAnd key performance indicators will look\nat things like the average time that\n\n294\n00:19:13.593 --> 00:19:19.354\na backup takes to complete, say over\na period of six months or maybe a week.\n\n295\n00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.750\nMonitoring without control\nis completely irrelevant.\n\n296\n00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.620\nWhat's the point in getting\nall of those reports and\n\n297\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.040\nall of those statistics if we\ndon't do anything with it?\n\n298\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.540\nAnd remember, we have a process called\nknowledge management within ITIL.\n\n299\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.090\nAnd knowledge management works on\nthe understanding that we have the right\n\n300\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.976\ninformation available to us\nto make informed decisions.\n\n301\n00:19:42.976 --> 00:19:46.823\nIf all of that information is\ntelling us absolutely nothing and\n\n302\n00:19:46.823 --> 00:19:52.160\nwe can't make an informed decisions from\nit, then we're measuring the wrong thing.\n\n303\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.270\nWe need to be able to make informed\ndecisions from our information.\n\n304\n00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:59.600\nSo understand why you're taking\nmetrics before you take them,\n\n305\n00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.820\nunderstand the purpose.\n\n306\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.590\nEvent management, of course,\nis key to all of this.\n\n307\n00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:12.408\nThis is the process that manages\nall of the monitoring and control.\n\n308\n00:20:12.408 --> 00:20:15.340\nSo that's the monitoring and\ncontrol activity.\n\n309\n00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.530\nIt's one of our common\nservice operation activities.\n\n310\n00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:25.085\nAnd in our next sessions, we're going to\nbe looking more in-depth at the functional\n\n311\n00:20:25.085 --> 00:20:30.114\nareas that we have, within service\noperations, within business as usual.\n\n312\n00:20:30.114 --> 00:20:32.802\nAnd what we're going to be\ndoing is just analyzing\n\n313\n00:20:32.802 --> 00:20:35.630\nthe activities that\nthey undertake as well.\n\n314\n00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:40.620\nNow service operation, obviously,\ninvolves business as usual so\n\n315\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.665\nit involves a lot of monitoring and\ncontrol.\n\n316\n00:20:42.665 --> 00:20:47.520\nAnd monitoring and control applies to\nevery single functional area in some way,\n\n317\n00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.850\nshape, or form.\n\n318\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.916\nBut now we're going to be\nlooking in the next sections at\n\n319\n00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:56.735\nspecific roles within\nspecific functional areas.\n\n320\n00:20:56.735 --> 00:20:58.163\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n321\n00:20:58.163 --> 00:21:02.733\nThank you again for introducing us to the\nconcept of these different activities that\n\n322\n00:21:02.733 --> 00:21:06.398\nare really gonna keep our business\nlined up the way that it needs to,\n\n323\n00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.091\noperating against that norm.\n\n324\n00:21:08.091 --> 00:21:11.631\nMaking sure we have the monitoring and\nthe controls to be able to see that, and\n\n325\n00:21:11.631 --> 00:21:14.290\nto be able to put things\nback where they need to be.\n\n326\n00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.690\nNow there's a lot more of these different\nactivities that we need to go through,\n\n327\n00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.470\nbut that's gonna be for another day.\n\n328\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.518\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n329\n00:21:24.518 --> 00:21:25.775\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n330\n00:21:25.775 --> 00:21:30.682\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation

00:00:08.221\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.141\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:15.533\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:19.121\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:20.909\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n\n8\n00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.243\nand today we're diving into common\nservice operation activities.\n\n9\n00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:27.446\nAnd here to help us is gonna\nbe our ITIL maven, Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:30.239\nJo Peacock, Jo, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.075\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me,\nI'm fine, how are you Ronnie?\n\n12\n00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:38.340\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great, as we now head into\nthis area of common service activities.\n\n13\n00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.126\nI mistakenly called it a process,\nI think, in a previous episode, so\n\n14\n00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.217\nmake sure you distinguish that for\nme again.\n\n15\n00:00:46.217 --> 00:00:48.545\nAnd then tell me what we're\ngonna be seeing today.\n\n16\n00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:52.453\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well,\na process is a set of activities, so\n\n17\n00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:57.957\na process is something that takes\nan input and turns it into an output.\n\n18\n00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:02.283\nFor instance, if I use the incident\nmanagement process as an example,\n\n19\n00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:06.897\na process will take, the objective of\nthe incident management process is to\n\n20\n00:01:06.897 --> 00:01:09.150\nrestore normal service operation.\n\n21\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.212\nWhich means that the output is something\nthat's been fixed, so the input,\n\n22\n00:01:13.212 --> 00:01:17.605\ntherefore, is something that's been\nbroken, something that's not working.\n\n23\n00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:20.189\nSo we take something that's not working,\nand\n\n24\n00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.114\ntransform it into something that's\nworking, so that's a process.\n\n25\n00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:29.023\nBut a process is made up of activities,\nand activities are just the things\n\n26\n00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:34.188\nthat we do within the process in order\nto facilitate achieving that outcome.\n\n27\n00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:39.096\nSo what we're going to look at over\nthe next couple of sections, actually,\n\n28\n00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:44.096\nare just some of the common activities\nthat exist within service operation.\n\n29\n00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:46.830\nSo this operation, as you know,\nis the business as usual,\n\n30\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.211\nit's the live environment.\n\n31\n00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:51.094\nSo it's about keeping everything up and\nrunning, and\n\n32\n00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:55.485\nso we're looking at just some of the\ncommon activities that organizations do.\n\n33\n00:01:55.485 --> 00:02:01.617\nThere's no right or wrong in this section,\nthere is no definitive,\n\n34\n00:02:01.617 --> 00:02:05.622\nthis is the ITIL way\nthat you need to do this.\n\n35\n00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:11.297\nThese are just activities that people may\nrecognize, some people may not recognize,\n\n36\n00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:15.760\nespecially if they don't have any\ninvolvement in that particular area of IT.\n\n37\n00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.912\nBut that's okay,\n\n38\n00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:21.811\nwe're just outlining really what happens\nin service operation, that's all.\n\n39\n00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:25.816\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go ahead and\nstart, then, what is our first step, or\n\n40\n00:02:25.816 --> 00:02:28.309\nwhat are we gonna be taking\na look at right now?\n\n41\n00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:34.251\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the first thing that we're\ngoing to do on our first slide is,\n\n42\n00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:41.126\nwe look at IT operations itself, and the\nrunning of the service that we may have.\n\n43\n00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:45.388\nOrganizations 20 odd years ago,\nand a lot of organizations, okay,\n\n44\n00:02:45.388 --> 00:02:49.663\n30 years ago now [LAUGH],\nI'm showing my age, I just wish it was 20.\n\n45\n00:02:49.663 --> 00:02:53.487\nWe all had mainframes, and\nthat's how we all started, and\n\n46\n00:02:53.487 --> 00:02:59.163\nthen we kind of move through to local area\nnetworks, LANs, mid-range systems, etc.\n\n47\n00:02:59.163 --> 00:03:04.272\nAnd even starting off as a mainframe\noperator, we had what we called a network\n\n48\n00:03:04.272 --> 00:03:09.160\noperation center, or an operations bridge,\nwhere we managed console.\n\n49\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.191\nThis is where the process called\nevent management happens.\n\n50\n00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:20.515\nSo within the IT operation's functional\narea, we will have console management,\n\n51\n00:03:20.515 --> 00:03:25.420\nso we'll have that in that work operation\ncenter, sometimes called a NOC.\n\n52\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.774\nWe'll have the operations bridge,\nif we want to call it that,\n\n53\n00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:33.401\nwhere we just simply manage\nthe day-to-day jobs.\n\n54\n00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:37.398\nWe manage the servers, we manage all\nof the events that are happening on\n\n55\n00:03:37.398 --> 00:03:40.460\nthe servers, and\nas we learned in a previous section,\n\n56\n00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.170\nevent management can sometimes\ntrigger incidents too.\n\n57\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.420\nSo this is where some\nincidents are generated,\n\n58\n00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.360\nwhere some incident records are raised.\n\n59\n00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.776\nSo that point about routine activities,\n\n60\n00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:55.613\nthat's what happens in\nthe operations bridge.\n\n61\n00:03:55.613 --> 00:04:00.240\nNow, you might think that that sounds\nlike a very sort of mundane role, but\n\n62\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.409\nactually it's a really,\nreally important role.\n\n63\n00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:10.530\nBecause these are the guys, this is\nthe area where failures are noticed first.\n\n64\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.592\nSo it's really, really important\nthat the operations bridge, or\n\n65\n00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:20.560\nthe NOC as we like to call it, it's really\nimportant that this is on the ball.\n\n66\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.040\nThese guys are on the ball, and\n\n67\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.410\nthey are able to respond to\nany event very, very quickly.\n\n68\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.893\nWhat they may also do, and\nit could be in a separate team, or\n\n69\n00:04:30.893 --> 00:04:35.228\nit could be in the operations bridge,\nthey might also do job scheduling.\n\n70\n00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:41.717\nSo when we talk about job scheduling,\nexamples are such as batch runs for,\n\n71\n00:04:41.717 --> 00:04:48.103\nsay, statements if you're in a bank,\nor if you are in a utility company,\n\n72\n00:04:48.103 --> 00:04:52.441\nyou will do statement rounds for\na billing, etc.\n\n73\n00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:56.814\nSo that's part of job scheduling,\nas well as backup and restores that will,\n\n74\n00:04:56.814 --> 00:05:00.651\nquite often, take place either in\nthe operations bridge or maybe,\n\n75\n00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:02.363\nagain, by a different team.\n\n76\n00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:05.827\nAnd it's just monitoring\nthat backups work, and\n\n77\n00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:10.538\nthat the tapes have gone to the relevant\nplace where they need to go.\n\n78\n00:05:10.538 --> 00:05:14.583\nAnd then also we might have printing,\nthere might be a print shop involved.\n\n79\n00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:18.746\nSometimes printing is something\nthat happens outside of\n\n80\n00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:21.440\nthe network operations bridge.\n\n81\n00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.572\nIt might even happen in an external\norganization, with a third-party supplier,\n\n82\n00:05:26.572 --> 00:05:29.667\nwe might choose to use\na supplier to do this for us.\n\n83\n00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:32.874\nLike when you get your cell phone bill,\n\n84\n00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:37.548\netc, a lot of times that\ndoesn't come from the company.\n\n85\n00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:42.072\nIt comes from a separate company,\nand they just do the printing.\n\n86\n00:05:42.072 --> 00:05:46.354\nNevertheless, it still has to be\ncontrolled internally, somebody has\n\n87\n00:05:46.354 --> 00:05:50.793\nto manage that contract, and supplier\nmanagement will help us with that.\n\n88\n00:05:50.793 --> 00:05:55.695\nBut also, our operations guys have to\nmonitor to make sure that this works\n\n89\n00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:58.083\nokay and that it's happening too.\n\n90\n00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:02.638\nSo one of the other areas we've got then\nwithin service operation, bearing in mind\n\n91\n00:06:02.638 --> 00:06:07.250\nthat this is business as usual, we have\nour server guys, our mainframe guys.\n\n92\n00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.357\nAnd they're doing support\nof those servers, so\n\n93\n00:06:10.357 --> 00:06:14.828\nthey might be doing things like licensing,\nand third level support,\n\n94\n00:06:14.828 --> 00:06:17.879\neven procurement advice,\nas it says up there.\n\n95\n00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.927\nWhat these guys are doing,\nthough, is support, so\n\n96\n00:06:21.927 --> 00:06:26.987\nnot only are they programming jobs,\nthey're scheduling jobs,\n\n97\n00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:32.244\nbut they're also picking up\nthe pieces when something goes wrong.\n\n98\n00:06:32.244 --> 00:06:35.211\nSo the fact that it says that\nit's a specialized team, hey,\n\n99\n00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.780\nyou've gotta have the right\nskills to do that.\n\n100\n00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.509\nI mean, I couldn't go and\ndo that, I don't know about you.\n\n101\n00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:41.178\n&gt;&gt; it's possible.\n\n102\n00:06:41.178 --> 00:06:45.233\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, 30 years ago,\n\n103\n00:06:45.233 --> 00:06:49.137\nmaybe, I was quite good at JCL, but.\n\n104\n00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:50.144\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n105\n00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:52.129\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was a long time ago.\n\n106\n00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:55.538\nAnd so we've got the guys with\nthe right skills that can do that,\n\n107\n00:06:55.538 --> 00:06:59.753\ncuz the last thing you need is somebody\nlike me, going in there and interfering.\n\n108\n00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:04.624\nNowadays, I wanna draw your attention to\nthe second from last bullet point there,\n\n109\n00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:09.098\nwhich talks about virtual servers,\ncuz nowadays, we have virtualization.\n\n110\n00:07:09.098 --> 00:07:15.023\nAnd so we might manage what we\nconsider to be internal cloud service,\n\n111\n00:07:15.023 --> 00:07:18.200\netc, within this particular team.\n\n112\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.650\nNow I've already told you, okay, we do\nnot tell you how to organize your IT,\n\n113\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.670\nand we won't tell you what your\nprocesses should look like.\n\n114\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.670\nWe'll just tell you that you\nneed to have processes, so\n\n115\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.310\nthis is outside of the processes.\n\n116\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.809\nThese are the teams and the skills that\nthey need to have that you've probably got\n\n117\n00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:40.328\nwithin your organization, but\nthey'll perform processes.\n\n118\n00:07:40.328 --> 00:07:44.619\nSo, if they're doing support, then they're\ngoing to be doing problem management,\n\n119\n00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:47.514\nthey're going to be doing\nsome incident management too.\n\n120\n00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:51.395\nThey're probably going to be doing\nsome availability management, and\n\n121\n00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:53.250\nsome capacity management, too.\n\n122\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:58.125\nSo these guys are actually going to be\ndoing a lot of the problem Process is that\n\n123\n00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:03.770\nwe look at throughout the service life\ncycle but four servers and mainframes.\n\n124\n00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.373\nLook at the other activities that they do,\ndefining build standards,\n\n125\n00:08:07.373 --> 00:08:11.114\nthat's part of service design,\nthat's part of project work, surely.\n\n126\n00:08:11.114 --> 00:08:14.950\nSo they're gonna be doing some of\nthe encoding and installing service.\n\n127\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.100\nI remember the days when I used to get my\nhands dirty like that, and I miss that,\n\n128\n00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.751\nI really do.\n\n129\n00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:21.302\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n130\n00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:24.396\nyou don't wanna see me crawling\nbehind a rack anymore, trust me.\n\n131\n00:08:24.396 --> 00:08:28.545\n[LAUGH] But ongoing maintenance, etc.\n\n132\n00:08:28.545 --> 00:08:33.420\nQuite often, we would prefer to have\nthe server team do that, and to be honest,\n\n133\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.628\nit's quicker for\nus to have a server team doing that,\n\n134\n00:08:35.628 --> 00:08:38.510\nthan it is to get\nan outside vendor involved.\n\n135\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.542\nSo this is not beyond the realm of\npossibility that we can be doing this\n\n136\n00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:43.386\ninternally.\n\n137\n00:08:46.307 --> 00:08:49.084\nAnd then, of course,\nnow we separate these things out, but\n\n138\n00:08:49.084 --> 00:08:52.555\nlet's think about the scalability\nof any organization.\n\n139\n00:08:52.555 --> 00:08:55.925\nThe larger the organization,\nthe more likely it is that\n\n140\n00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:59.490\nthese things will be separated out,\nthese teams will be separated.\n\n141\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.830\nThe smaller the organization,\n\n142\n00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.290\nthe more likely we are that these\nteams are going to be combined.\n\n143\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.262\nAnd so, it's not impossible for\nthe server guys and the mainframe guys and\n\n144\n00:09:08.262 --> 00:09:10.736\nthe network guys to all\nbe one in the same team.\n\n145\n00:09:10.736 --> 00:09:14.703\nAnd we don't mind, as long as you\nunderstand what roles you need\n\n146\n00:09:14.703 --> 00:09:19.780\nin your organization, then we really\nreally don't mind how you organize.\n\n147\n00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.860\nYou can organize for\n\n148\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.990\nefficiency and effectiveness,\nthat's what we want you to do.\n\n149\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.531\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo, as you talk about that,\n\n150\n00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:31.275\nthe goal here in making sure that\nthese activities are in place.\n\n151\n00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:35.162\nAnd what we're doing is really to\naddress the scalability regardless of\n\n152\n00:09:35.162 --> 00:09:36.190\nthe size, right?\n\n153\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.313\nSo if my company grows from a very\nsmall shop to a large shop,\n\n154\n00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:44.282\nI'm not having to kind of put\nthe steps in place as I grow.\n\n155\n00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:46.650\nI've already got it set up and\nunderstand that process,\n\n156\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.450\nis that what you're trying to say?\n\n157\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.914\n&gt;&gt; Well, in service strategy,\nin that life cycle phase,\n\n158\n00:09:51.914 --> 00:09:55.242\nwe actually look a lot more\nin depth at organization.\n\n159\n00:09:55.242 --> 00:09:59.674\nAnd how we move from a flat structure in\na small organization, to a completely\n\n160\n00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:04.850\ncollaborative structure in a very,\nvery large international organization.\n\n161\n00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:09.420\nNow, we're not telling you that you\nhave to have these teams in place.\n\n162\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.710\nWe're not gonna tell you that,\n\n163\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.050\nbecause we don't know what\nyour organization looks like.\n\n164\n00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.500\nAnd it may be that even in\na really large organization,\n\n165\n00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.690\nlet's say an international organization,\nyou might outsource some of these roles.\n\n166\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.010\nYou might outsource IT in its entirety,\nand\n\n167\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.370\nyou might have an external\nservice provider.\n\n168\n00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.978\nAnd, you know what, you might even\nhave multiple service providers.\n\n169\n00:10:29.978 --> 00:10:35.130\nSo you may have one team doing network\nsupport and network management.\n\n170\n00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.621\nLet's say, for instance,\n\n171\n00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:40.487\nCisco, a lot of organizations use\nCisco to do their network management.\n\n172\n00:10:40.487 --> 00:10:43.311\nBut then you might have\nsomebody else that comes in and\n\n173\n00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:47.260\nmanages another portion of\nthe infrastructure, like servers, etc.\n\n174\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.180\nSo you might have HP coming in, and\nthey'll do the hardware support.\n\n175\n00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.680\nAnd they do the server, the software,\nthe firmware support for\n\n176\n00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.510\nthe servers, and\nthe operating system support.\n\n177\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:05.790\nSo, it's not impossible to\nhave any format for structure.\n\n178\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.674\nWe're just telling you that\nthese jobs will need to happen,\n\n179\n00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:14.237\ndepending on what your organization does.\n\n180\n00:11:14.237 --> 00:11:18.973\nEverybody's got a network nowadays, so\nwe have to have some form of network\n\n181\n00:11:18.973 --> 00:11:22.510\nmanagement, and\nsomebody has to make the decision.\n\n182\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.719\nLet's look at IP address management,\nsomebody's gotta make a decision whether\n\n183\n00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.506\nwe have dynamic IP addressing, or\nwhether we have static IP addressing.\n\n184\n00:11:30.506 --> 00:11:33.916\nNow, if it's a very,\nvery small organization and\n\n185\n00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:37.089\nyou don't have anybody\nwith the right skills,\n\n186\n00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:41.900\nand with the right level of experience\nto be able to make that decision.\n\n187\n00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.000\nAnd maybe you're going to let somebody\nlike Cisco come in and advise you, or\n\n188\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.570\nmaybe even make that decision for\nyou and take the management off you.\n\n189\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.998\nBut it has to happen nevertheless, even\nin our own homes, we make that decision.\n\n190\n00:11:54.998 --> 00:11:59.189\nI mean, let's think about my home,\n\n191\n00:11:59.189 --> 00:12:04.203\nI have cameras absolutely\nall over my home.\n\n192\n00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:07.910\nSome of them are set up on static IP,\nsome of them are on dynamic IP.\n\n193\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.511\nSo I have to reboot my routers,\nthen things might change.\n\n194\n00:12:12.511 --> 00:12:17.390\nBut I have to make that decision,\nand we all have to.\n\n195\n00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.540\nSo it really depends on,\nnot just the scale, but\n\n196\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.600\nalso the type of organization, too.\n\n197\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.302\nIf we're a small family run business that\nmaybe has got, let's say, for instance,\n\n198\n00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:33.702\na coffee shop that maybe's got 10,\n20 branches, somebody has to do this.\n\n199\n00:12:33.702 --> 00:12:37.393\nThey have to have a network, they have\nto manage their point of sale, so\n\n200\n00:12:37.393 --> 00:12:39.440\nthey have to have a network.\n\n201\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.062\nBut if their experience is\nin coffee shop management,\n\n202\n00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:45.373\ntheir experience is probably not\ngoing to be in network management.\n\n203\n00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:50.635\nSo they get somebody to do that for\nthem, so our network teams and\n\n204\n00:12:50.635 --> 00:12:55.620\nour server teams,\nthey are very specialist in what they do.\n\n205\n00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.223\nAnd as we say,\nwe put firewalls and gateways and\n\n206\n00:12:58.223 --> 00:13:01.361\ninternet service providers\nunder network management.\n\n207\n00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:04.363\nBut you know what, you might not put\nyour firewalls under the network,\n\n208\n00:13:04.363 --> 00:13:05.852\nyou might put them under servers.\n\n209\n00:13:05.852 --> 00:13:11.339\nWe really don't mind, as long as your\nacknowledge you have to have a firewall.\n\n210\n00:13:11.339 --> 00:13:16.007\nYeah, and that's what we're saying,\nis you have to have some form of security.\n\n211\n00:13:16.007 --> 00:13:20.787\nI mean, let's look at storage and\narchiving, some people would put,\n\n212\n00:13:20.787 --> 00:13:23.813\nand again,\nit can depend on scalability, or\n\n213\n00:13:23.813 --> 00:13:27.178\nit can depend on the purpose\nof the organization.\n\n214\n00:13:27.178 --> 00:13:31.390\nSome people put storage and\narchive in with server management.\n\n215\n00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.920\nBecause you're managing space, you're\nmanaging space on your disk arrays, and\n\n216\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.850\nso therefore,\nthat falls under the servers.\n\n217\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.800\nIt might fall under the networks\nin your organization, or\n\n218\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.757\nit might be a completely different team,\nwe don't mind.\n\n219\n00:13:47.757 --> 00:13:49.519\nBut when we think about storage and\n\n220\n00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:52.619\narchives, you think about sort\nof naming conventions, and\n\n221\n00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:56.710\nyou think about archive, and\nthen you think about backups and restores.\n\n222\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.800\nNow, we gave the job, in a previous slide,\nwe gave the job of backups and\n\n223\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.440\nrestores to our network operation center.\n\n224\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.550\nBut you know what,\nit might not lie there, backups and\n\n225\n00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.060\nrestores might come under storage and\narchiving.\n\n226\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.875\nAnd backup policies, and\nwhat to do with the tapes,\n\n227\n00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:19.814\nwhat to do with the, well, I mean,\nit was tapes a long time ago, but\n\n228\n00:14:19.814 --> 00:14:23.305\nmaybe we just backup\ndirectly to another site.\n\n229\n00:14:23.305 --> 00:14:29.102\nRetention policies, etc, will be set\nby this particular group of people, but\n\n230\n00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:34.379\nwhether they sit in operations, or\nwhether they sit in the server team,\n\n231\n00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:37.428\nwhether they sit in their separate team.\n\n232\n00:14:37.428 --> 00:14:42.450\nIt doesn't really matter, but\nwe have to make those decisions.\n\n233\n00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.000\nLook at the naming conventions and\nhousekeeping,\n\n234\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.500\nthese decisions have to be made.\n\n235\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.110\nWe can't call every single\nbackup exactly the same thing.\n\n236\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:57.104\n[LAUGH] You know what it's like when you\njust try to save a simple file on your\n\n237\n00:14:57.104 --> 00:15:02.840\nlaptop, and it's come up with another\ndocument that's got exactly the same name.\n\n238\n00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.000\nWe can't do it, so\n\n239\n00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.320\nsomebody has to make the decisions to\nwhat the naming convention's going to be.\n\n240\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.615\n[LAUGH] And believe it or not,\nI don't find that very simple at all.\n\n241\n00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:16.469\nI struggle when I have to save a document,\nand then I realize I've got one\n\n242\n00:15:16.469 --> 00:15:21.100\nalready called that, and I think, now I'm\ngonna have to change the name of both.\n\n243\n00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.260\nSo it's something that has to be done,\nit's the same with database\n\n244\n00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.606\nadministration, we will\nlook at databases now.\n\n245\n00:15:30.606 --> 00:15:35.402\nI don't know many organizations\nthat don't have even a simple\n\n246\n00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:38.420\ndatabase in some shape or form.\n\n247\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.076\nAnd so we have to do housekeeping,\nwe have to security, and again,\n\n248\n00:15:42.076 --> 00:15:44.142\nwe have to do backups of our database.\n\n249\n00:15:44.142 --> 00:15:48.839\nWe have to ensure,\nI used yesterday an acronym, CIA.\n\n250\n00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:51.780\nAnd we have to ensure the confidentiality,\n\n251\n00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.202\nthe integrity, and\nthe availability of the data.\n\n252\n00:15:55.202 --> 00:16:00.703\nSo, we have to have some form\nof database administration.\n\n253\n00:16:00.703 --> 00:16:04.962\nNow, whether, again,\nwe've put that in with Our server guys.\n\n254\n00:16:04.962 --> 00:16:07.642\nSo, we might have put it in\nwith the operations guys.\n\n255\n00:16:07.642 --> 00:16:12.150\nOr you might even put that in with\nsay application support guys.\n\n256\n00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.108\nThat's completely up to you,\nbut look at what they do.\n\n257\n00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:19.550\nThey're doing some development, because\nthey're doing the design of databases.\n\n258\n00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.046\nThey're managing the availability and\ncapacity.\n\n259\n00:16:22.046 --> 00:16:27.770\nWell, that's a process or\nprocesses within service management.\n\n260\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.471\nThey're doing all of the housekeeping.\n\n261\n00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:34.264\nLook, they're even defining event\nmanagement parameters as well.\n\n262\n00:16:34.264 --> 00:16:39.413\nNow a lot of these parameters, and\nI want to say this cuz this carries on\n\n263\n00:16:39.413 --> 00:16:45.105\nthroughout the activities that we're\ngoing to very quickly look at rather.\n\n264\n00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:48.124\nA lot of these parameters\nare going to be internal.\n\n265\n00:16:48.124 --> 00:16:52.160\nWe're going to find these in what we\ncall the operational level agreements.\n\n266\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.810\nWe're not going to find these in the SLA,\nbecause let's face it.\n\n267\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.980\nOur customers don't understand this.\n\n268\n00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.932\nWe don't need them to understand this.\n\n269\n00:17:01.932 --> 00:17:04.955\nThey don't need to understand it at all.\n\n270\n00:17:04.955 --> 00:17:09.920\nAnd we really don't want to give\nthem all out technical information.\n\n271\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.191\nImagine this lies in the SLA, if we would\nhave put all of these in there, okay?\n\n272\n00:17:14.191 --> 00:17:19.499\nThey don't really need to understand\nthe name and convention of our backup.\n\n273\n00:17:19.499 --> 00:17:23.129\nSo what sort of housekeeping\nwe provide on our databases or\n\n274\n00:17:23.129 --> 00:17:25.213\nwhatever event parameters are.\n\n275\n00:17:25.213 --> 00:17:27.655\nThey don't need to know that.\n\n276\n00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:31.200\nThey just need to know that it's\navailable when they need the data.\n\n277\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.481\nThat's what they're\ninterested in after all.\n\n278\n00:17:33.481 --> 00:17:36.391\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Jo, this seems to go\nback to emphasize that point\n\n279\n00:17:36.391 --> 00:17:39.380\nof the idea of the value that\nwe provide to the customer.\n\n280\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.572\nOverwhelming them with a technical aspects\nof this may be too much when they don't\n\n281\n00:17:43.572 --> 00:17:44.433\nunderstand it.\n\n282\n00:17:44.433 --> 00:17:47.433\nBut telling them that you're gonna\nprovide the service to them and\n\n283\n00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:50.340\nthat you'll be able to do it at\na particular level in agreement.\n\n284\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.927\nI think that provides the value to most\ncustomers and what they're looking for.\n\n285\n00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:58.875\nSo in that sense, what they were\ntalking about, it really does help for\n\n286\n00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:01.514\nus if we're setting everything up but\n\n287\n00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:06.228\nmay not help the customer in the end\nin the service level agreement.\n\n288\n00:18:06.228 --> 00:18:11.017\n&gt;&gt; We sort of slightly are going to sort\nof divert ourselves a little bit from this\n\n289\n00:18:11.017 --> 00:18:14.492\ntopic, but\nit's really important what you just said.\n\n290\n00:18:14.492 --> 00:18:21.793\nBecause we looked in all the section\nabout communication and we're in IT.\n\n291\n00:18:21.793 --> 00:18:24.033\nAnd I'll be perfectly honest with you and\n\n292\n00:18:24.033 --> 00:18:28.450\nit's something that we talk about a lot in\nservice strategy as a life cycle phase.\n\n293\n00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:32.738\nAnd we'll also talk about it when we look\nat the service desk in another session,\n\n294\n00:18:32.738 --> 00:18:34.270\nhere in service operation.\n\n295\n00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.373\nWe can be pretty ineffective\nat communication.\n\n296\n00:18:37.373 --> 00:18:38.890\nWe really can.\n\n297\n00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:43.450\nAnd we tend to keep ourselves\ninto the technical details.\n\n298\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.250\nWe like the technical details.\n\n299\n00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.020\nThere's kind of comfort and\nsecurity in the technical details.\n\n300\n00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.490\nBut unfortunately when we're trying\nto relay those technical details\n\n301\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:57.210\nto the customer,\nit's not their role to understand it.\n\n302\n00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:01.126\nAnd so when we do that, it can come\nacross a little bit patronizing.\n\n303\n00:19:01.126 --> 00:19:02.378\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n304\n00:19:02.378 --> 00:19:04.640\n&gt;&gt; They don't value that.\n\n305\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.603\nThey see us as distancing\nourselves from them.\n\n306\n00:19:08.603 --> 00:19:11.058\nAnd if we're trying to\ndeliver value to them, and\n\n307\n00:19:11.058 --> 00:19:14.216\nthen what we're doing is blinding\nthem with science in effect,\n\n308\n00:19:14.216 --> 00:19:16.740\nthen they're not going to\nperceive value in that.\n\n309\n00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:21.184\nAnd in fact, they actually think, and I've\nheard this said before from customers,\n\n310\n00:19:21.184 --> 00:19:25.627\nthey actually think that what we're trying\nto do is just confuse them deliberately or\n\n311\n00:19:25.627 --> 00:19:27.186\ndeliberately mislead them.\n\n312\n00:19:27.186 --> 00:19:28.554\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n313\n00:19:28.554 --> 00:19:31.007\n&gt;&gt; Not because we think that\nthey won't understand, but\n\n314\n00:19:31.007 --> 00:19:33.312\nbecause we're trying to\nhide something perhaps.\n\n315\n00:19:33.312 --> 00:19:36.393\nAnd so\nit's not that we want to hide anything,\n\n316\n00:19:36.393 --> 00:19:39.873\nit's just very simply we\nwant to deliver the value.\n\n317\n00:19:39.873 --> 00:19:44.020\nAnd so the technical information,\nthey don't need to see that.\n\n318\n00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.762\nIf they want to, they can.\n\n319\n00:19:45.762 --> 00:19:50.397\nAnd we're quite happy to let\nthem see any of our OLAs.\n\n320\n00:19:50.397 --> 00:19:54.533\nAnd in fact in service strategy,\nwe have a principle called governance,\n\n321\n00:19:54.533 --> 00:19:57.970\nwhich is about control with fairness and\ntransparency.\n\n322\n00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So we're happy to release any of our\n\n323\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.320\ndocumentation o our internal customers,\nmore than happy.\n\n324\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.873\nWe're not very good at\nselling ourselves in IT.\n\n325\n00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not really very good at\n\n326\n00:20:10.658 --> 00:20:11.663\nthe sales.\n\n327\n00:20:11.663 --> 00:20:15.305\nAnd so, it's very difficult sometimes for\n\n328\n00:20:15.305 --> 00:20:19.940\nus to articulate how we deliver\nvalue to our customers.\n\n329\n00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.576\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n330\n00:20:20.576 --> 00:20:26.130\nwe do fall into the trap of trying to\narticulate that value in a technical way.\n\n331\n00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n332\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:31.228\n&gt;&gt; We'll say, well we've done this and\nwe did this and this and this.\n\n333\n00:20:31.228 --> 00:20:33.630\nAnd they don't understand any of it.\n\n334\n00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.960\nAnd more to the point,\nthey don't need to understand any of it.\n\n335\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.901\nAnd this is where that\nrelationship breaks down.\n\n336\n00:20:38.901 --> 00:20:42.651\nAnd if our business thing,\nso we're being patronized.\n\n337\n00:20:42.651 --> 00:20:44.063\nThat we're trying to hide something,\n\n338\n00:20:44.063 --> 00:20:46.825\nthen it doesn't matter how good\nthe service are that we're delivering.\n\n339\n00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:49.840\nThen just not going to\nappreciate the value of it.\n\n340\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.988\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting that, I don't know why\nthis brought it up, but as an example I\n\n341\n00:20:53.988 --> 00:20:57.587\nremember sitting in on a conversation\nlike this where somebody said,\n\n342\n00:20:57.587 --> 00:21:00.759\nI don't know what you just said and\nfinally the guy just said,\n\n343\n00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:03.397\nwe're gonna provide you\nan IT guy that can do this.\n\n344\n00:21:03.397 --> 00:21:03.923\nThat's all they said.\n\n345\n00:21:03.923 --> 00:21:05.066\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n346\n00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:07.020\nthey like that makes more sense now.\n\n347\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:11.969\nSo without all the technical nature he was\nable to sell his particular service and\n\n348\n00:21:11.969 --> 00:21:16.574\nproduct just by saying we're gonna\nprovide you with a guy that can do this.\n\n349\n00:21:16.574 --> 00:21:18.880\nAnd that can actually do\nwhat you need to be done.\n\n350\n00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.026\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and communication though\nit's really, really important.\n\n351\n00:21:23.026 --> 00:21:25.446\nBecause if I went into a meeting and\nI said don't worry,\n\n352\n00:21:25.446 --> 00:21:26.641\nyou don't need to know it.\n\n353\n00:21:26.641 --> 00:21:27.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.002\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n355\n00:21:28.002 --> 00:21:30.093\nthat comes off the wrong way as well.\n\n356\n00:21:30.093 --> 00:21:33.686\nBut if I go into a meeting with\na load of technical information.\n\n357\n00:21:33.686 --> 00:21:38.111\nI start talking to a customer about the\ndifference between static IP addresses and\n\n358\n00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:39.850\ndynamic IP addresses.\n\n359\n00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.853\nAnd I say, well, which would you prefer,\nand what do you want, and\n\n360\n00:21:42.853 --> 00:21:45.308\nyou need this for\nthis particular piece of equipment.\n\n361\n00:21:45.308 --> 00:21:48.500\nThey're gonna look at me a s though\nI'm talking on a completely different\n\n362\n00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.640\nlanguage, because I am.\n\n363\n00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.597\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna get that balance right.\n\n364\n00:21:51.597 --> 00:21:55.023\nCuz you can't just walk up to\na customer and say, don't worry,\n\n365\n00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.812\nyou don't need to know about it.\n\n366\n00:21:56.812 --> 00:21:57.861\nThey don't trust you.\n\n367\n00:21:57.861 --> 00:21:58.615\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n368\n00:21:58.615 --> 00:22:01.216\n&gt;&gt; But you won't come to them to\ngive too much technical information.\n\n369\n00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:03.102\nAnd again they don't trust you.\n\n370\n00:22:03.102 --> 00:22:07.305\nSo it happens to get the balance right and\na lot of times it's really just a simple\n\n371\n00:22:07.305 --> 00:22:11.630\ncase to say hey, we've got this covered\nand we've got the information to hand.\n\n372\n00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.121\nIf you wanna have a look at it,\ntake a look at it.\n\n373\n00:22:13.121 --> 00:22:14.799\nAnd I will walk through and\n\n374\n00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:19.304\nexplain it to you in terms of hopefully\nyou'll be able to understand.\n\n375\n00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:23.505\nBut you probably don't really\nwanna spend your time doing this.\n\n376\n00:22:23.505 --> 00:22:25.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n377\n00:22:25.517 --> 00:22:29.391\n[LAUGH] So let's go back to\nwhat we were looking at then.\n\n378\n00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:31.347\nAnd we were looking at\ndatabase administration.\n\n379\n00:22:31.347 --> 00:22:34.736\nAnd another part of our\noperation activities and\n\n380\n00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:40.281\nwe've got quite a few that we're gonna\ncover over the next couple of sections.\n\n381\n00:22:40.281 --> 00:22:42.728\nDirectory services management,\n\n382\n00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:48.480\nnow we covered a process in a previous\nsection called access management.\n\n383\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.830\nAnd access management was all about\ngiving access and taking access away.\n\n384\n00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.880\nAnd we use directory\nservices to help us do that.\n\n385\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:05.135\nAnd directory services we use tools\nsimilar to Microsoft Active Directory for\n\n386\n00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:11.199\ninstance, which is all about making sure\nthat we do give the right access and\n\n387\n00:23:11.199 --> 00:23:15.270\nthe right level of access\nto the right users.\n\n388\n00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.585\nAnd so,\nthis is what directory services does.\n\n389\n00:23:17.585 --> 00:23:20.660\nBut directory services\nhas a group of people and\n\n390\n00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.340\nagain this could be part\nof the service desk.\n\n391\n00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.510\nIt could be part of server management for\ninstance.\n\n392\n00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.590\nIt's entirely up to you and\nyour organization as to where it sits.\n\n393\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.471\nBut somebody needs to control access.\n\n394\n00:23:35.471 --> 00:23:39.547\nSomebody needs to control\nthe rights that people have, and\n\n395\n00:23:39.547 --> 00:23:45.266\nsomebody also needs to control things like\nthe naming conventions of the user IDs.\n\n396\n00:23:45.266 --> 00:23:48.914\nI've seen organizations as they evolve,\nand they start off with\n\n397\n00:23:48.914 --> 00:23:53.312\nnaming conventions in their user IDs with\njust their last name and an initial.\n\n398\n00:23:53.312 --> 00:23:56.130\nAnd then as they evolved,\nas they grow quicker,\n\n399\n00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:00.138\nthey realized that they've got 15\npeople with the same last name.\n\n400\n00:24:00.138 --> 00:24:01.543\n&gt;&gt; Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And three of them yes,\n\n401\n00:24:01.543 --> 00:24:02.488\nSmith is a good one.\n\n402\n00:24:02.488 --> 00:24:03.046\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n403\n00:24:03.046 --> 00:24:05.752\nthree of them have got\nthe first initial of A.\n\n404\n00:24:05.752 --> 00:24:09.813\nAnd so, then they start adding in x's,\nand they start adding in z's, and\n\n405\n00:24:09.813 --> 00:24:10.850\nthings like that.\n\n406\n00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:18.386\nAnd start off, as you evolve, with a\nnaming convention that allows you to grow.\n\n407\n00:24:18.386 --> 00:24:22.091\nBecause if you use a naming\nconvention that is very simple,\n\n408\n00:24:22.091 --> 00:24:25.235\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n409\n00:24:25.235 --> 00:24:28.555\nBut you've gotta think about growth and\nyou've gotta think about expansion.\n\n410\n00:24:28.555 --> 00:24:33.216\nAnd you've gotta think about the fact that\nthe team that you have right now might not\n\n411\n00:24:33.216 --> 00:24:36.627\nnecessarily be the team that\nyou've got in five years time.\n\n412\n00:24:36.627 --> 00:24:41.235\nAnd let's say then that\nAndrew Smith left the organization,\n\n413\n00:24:41.235 --> 00:24:43.990\nwe don't just delete Andrew Smith.\n\n414\n00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:49.336\nWe remove the access for Andrew Smith,\nbut Andrew Smith created documents and\n\n415\n00:24:49.336 --> 00:24:53.642\ncreated a lot of information and\na lot of data in our databases.\n\n416\n00:24:53.642 --> 00:24:57.710\nSo we can't remove Andrew Smith's user ID.\n\n417\n00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:03.345\nAnd if his user ID was Smith, A,\nthen when we employ Allan Smith.\n\n418\n00:25:03.345 --> 00:25:04.266\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n419\n00:25:04.266 --> 00:25:05.580\n&gt;&gt; What do we do?\n\n420\n00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.800\nYou can't give him the same\nuser ID because, of course,\n\n421\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.200\nit's already been used and\nthose documents are already there and\n\n422\n00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.880\nthat might not have any relation\nto the role that he's doing.\n\n423\n00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.250\nSo somebody has to make those decisions.\n\n424\n00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:25.820\nAnd if you notice that a lot\nof these activities that we're\n\n425\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.093\ntalking about involve decision making.\n\n426\n00:25:29.093 --> 00:25:31.648\nAnd we're not going to tell\nyou how to do that because\n\n427\n00:25:31.648 --> 00:25:34.553\nwe're not gonna tell you what\ndecisions are right for you,\n\n428\n00:25:34.553 --> 00:25:37.710\nwe're just gonna tell you that\nthese activities need to exist.\n\n429\n00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.871\nSo then another team that we might have,\n\n430\n00:25:42.871 --> 00:25:47.463\ncertainly activities that\nneed to take place desktop.\n\n431\n00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:50.721\nDesktop support and\nwe've got here mobile device support now.\n\n432\n00:25:50.721 --> 00:25:55.208\nBecause more and\nmore often we are finding that people\n\n433\n00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:58.905\nare moving now towards mobile technology.\n\n434\n00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:02.326\nThey are now utilizing pads and\ntablets and\n\n435\n00:26:02.326 --> 00:26:06.070\nthey are now utilizing cell phones even.\n\n436\n00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.740\nAnd if you get a cellphone\nwith a decent enough screen,\n\n437\n00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.250\nthen why don't you use that cellphone.\n\n438\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.102\nAnd everybody nowadays has\nemail on their cellphone.\n\n439\n00:26:14.102 --> 00:26:16.774\nThey all have email on their tablet.\n\n440\n00:26:16.774 --> 00:26:19.182\nAnd they're looking for apps and\n\n441\n00:26:19.182 --> 00:26:24.260\nare using apps that can actually help\nthem work in a mobile situation.\n\n442\n00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.448\nSo we need people who can support that.\n\n443\n00:26:26.448 --> 00:26:30.376\nAnd of course,\nanother progression or evolution,\n\n444\n00:26:30.376 --> 00:26:34.492\nthat I see quite often is now\nthe bring your own device.\n\n445\n00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:40.400\nAnd bring your own device is something\nthat a lot of new organizations will use.\n\n446\n00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:46.092\nAnd a lot of, I guess,\ninnovative technology companies\n\n447\n00:26:46.092 --> 00:26:51.330\nuse that too because they\nare able to absorb that.\n\n448\n00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.918\nNow I don't see that too\nmuch in high security areas.\n\n449\n00:26:54.918 --> 00:26:56.050\nThings like banks,\n\n450\n00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.922\nand government buildings I don't\nexpect you bring your own device.\n\n451\n00:26:59.922 --> 00:27:02.945\nOkay, if I do see you bring your own\ndevice then I'm getting worried in\n\n452\n00:27:02.945 --> 00:27:03.721\nthat situation.\n\n453\n00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:04.549\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n454\n00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:06.002\n&gt;&gt; But yeah.\n\n455\n00:27:06.002 --> 00:27:11.604\nI expect to see desktop support\nevolve more into the device support,\n\n456\n00:27:11.604 --> 00:27:13.350\nmobile support.\n\n457\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.480\nEspecially over the next few years,\nI think that's going to happen.\n\n458\n00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.990\nSo we need to have somebody that\nhas the technical skills and\n\n459\n00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:23.630\nexperience to be able to\nprovide that support.\n\n460\n00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:30.590\nAnd it's not just about support, it's\nabout build, and testing, and deploying.\n\n461\n00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:36.200\nIf I'm bringing my own device, then\nsomebody needs to check that it's okay for\n\n462\n00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.240\nme to plug that into the network.\n\n463\n00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.572\nBecause you don't know what\nI've got on my device.\n\n464\n00:27:41.572 --> 00:27:45.210\nI might have a very good\ndetection tool on my device.\n\n465\n00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.596\nAnd now you see my device plugged\ninto the network here and\n\n466\n00:27:49.596 --> 00:27:51.140\nnow you're worried and I know.\n\n467\n00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.125\n[LAUGH] But\nI might have a very good detection tool.\n\n468\n00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:57.511\nI might have all sorts\nof things on my device.\n\n469\n00:27:57.511 --> 00:28:02.345\nSo this is what desktop support\nshould be doing now is they should\n\n470\n00:28:02.345 --> 00:28:07.088\nbe moving with the 21st century and\nproviding the building,\n\n471\n00:28:07.088 --> 00:28:11.311\nand the testing, and\nthe deployment of these devices.\n\n472\n00:28:11.311 --> 00:28:17.037\nBut also the supporting too, including\nconnectivity support as we say here for\n\n473\n00:28:17.037 --> 00:28:20.210\na lot of mobile users or home users.\n\n474\n00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.347\nNowadays a lot of people are working\nfrom home and we can do that.\n\n475\n00:28:23.347 --> 00:28:29.749\nWe have the right amount of technology now\nto be able to be in the office virtually.\n\n476\n00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.650\nSo the last thing that I want to cover\nin this particular section before\n\n477\n00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:40.030\nwe move on to other activities in\nthe next section is middleware.\n\n478\n00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:44.440\nMiddleware is bit of an ambiguous one\ncuz as it says here middleware is that\n\n479\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.990\nsoftware that integrates software\ncomponents across disparate applications.\n\n480\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.440\nSometimes we let our\nserver guys manage this.\n\n481\n00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.220\nSometimes depending on the organization\nwe've got a separate team to manage this.\n\n482\n00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.980\nSometimes, we let our desktop\nsupport guys manage this.\n\n483\n00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.220\nSometimes we let our\napplication guys manage this.\n\n484\n00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.936\nIt really is down to the organization.\n\n485\n00:29:09.936 --> 00:29:14.173\nThere is no right or\nwrong way to do middleware support.\n\n486\n00:29:14.173 --> 00:29:19.324\nHowever we have to acknowledge that\nmiddleware support is very very important\n\n487\n00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:24.017\nbecause when it comes to detection and\nresolving incidences.\n\n488\n00:29:24.017 --> 00:29:28.965\nWhen it comes to incident management\nmiddleware is the gray ambiguous area in\n\n489\n00:29:28.965 --> 00:29:30.530\nthe middle.\n\n490\n00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:35.720\nWhere there is quite often contention\nover who takes responsibility for it.\n\n491\n00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.830\nThis is where we see incidents\nbeing passed around from\n\n492\n00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:43.120\none support team to another.\n\n493\n00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.515\nIt's not a server issue,\nit's actually a software issue.\n\n494\n00:29:47.515 --> 00:29:49.595\nAnd then it goes to\nthe application team and\n\n495\n00:29:49.595 --> 00:29:54.365\nthe application team says, it's not an\napplication issue, it's a network issue.\n\n496\n00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:56.451\nAnd then it goes to the network guys, and\n\n497\n00:29:56.451 --> 00:29:58.482\nthen they throw it back\nto the server guys.\n\n498\n00:29:58.482 --> 00:30:02.411\nAnd before you know it,\nthis incident has been passed around for\n\n499\n00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:07.307\nthree hours, and we've got a four hour\nservice level target on that incident.\n\n500\n00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:13.234\nSo the real advice, best advice that I can\ngive anyone when it comes to middleware\n\n501\n00:30:13.234 --> 00:30:19.641\nmanagement, is make sure you have very\ndistinctive roles and responsibilities.\n\n502\n00:30:19.641 --> 00:30:24.610\nWe don't care where middleware sits,\nwe don't care if you have a separate team.\n\n503\n00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.090\nYou can put it in with the service.\n\n504\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.450\nYou can put it in with desktop support.\n\n505\n00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.130\nBut please make sure that\nyou have the right roles and\n\n506\n00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:36.910\nresponsibilities to avoid\nwhat we call incident tennis.\n\n507\n00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:42.244\nYeah, we don't need that incident being\nbatted around from one team to the next.\n\n508\n00:30:42.244 --> 00:30:47.665\nWe need to have direct responsibility for\nany particular incident.\n\n509\n00:30:47.665 --> 00:30:50.810\nSo that it can be managed\nthrough to resolution.\n\n510\n00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.078\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\n\n511\n00:30:53.078 --> 00:30:56.970\nhelping us with some of these common\nservice operation activities.\n\n512\n00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:02.030\nThat we should all consider as we continue\nforward in our knowledge in ITIL.\n\n513\n00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.710\nWell a lot of these activities that we\nlooked at really evolve around that word\n\n514\n00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.890\nmanagement, as well.\n\n515\n00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:09.702\nWhich means decision making activities\nare also gonna to be here, too.\n\n516\n00:31:09.702 --> 00:31:12.920\nBut there's more, of course,\nof these activities to come.\n\n517\n00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.000\nSo we're going to save that for\nanother part, as well.\n\n518\n00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.940\nBut, for this episode, signing off for\nITPRO.TV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n519\n00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.152\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n520\n00:31:22.152 --> 00:31:27.266\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more ITIL\nintermediate service operation shows.\n\n521\n00:31:27.266 --> 00:31:33.330\n[MUSIC]\n\n522\n00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.139\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.327\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:12.275\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:15.355\nWelcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:19.445\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:20.845\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:26.155\nAnd today we're diving into a another part\non common service operation activities.\n\n9\n00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:30.638\nAnd this time, with, of course, the\nmastermind of ITIL herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.638 --> 00:00:32.497\nJo, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:32.497 --> 00:00:34.554\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Ronnie,\nit's fine, pleased to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:34.554 --> 00:00:35.750\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.630\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine as we continue on with\n\n14\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.000\ntaking a look at some of\nthese different activities.\n\n15\n00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.730\nWe've already hit a lot of them.\n\n16\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.150\nAnd Jo I think you've warned me that\nthere's actually quite a bit of these for\n\n17\n00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.180\nus to cover.\n\n18\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.030\nSo let's get started and take a look\nat what we actually need to see.\n\n19\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we are in part two of\nthe service operation activities and\n\n20\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.362\nwe're going to continue\nlooking at the activity.\n\n21\n00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:04.621\nSort of starting off where we left it off\nyesterday, in the last session sorry,\n\n22\n00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:08.761\nand then we are going to start looking\nat some of the relationships between\n\n23\n00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:09.724\nthe processes.\n\n24\n00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:14.124\nIn the previous session I mentioned\nthat some of these activities\n\n25\n00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:16.770\nare performed by specific processes.\n\n26\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.870\nSo we're going to start off\nlooking at those processes.\n\n27\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.694\nAnd then again, in our next\nsession which would be part three,\n\n28\n00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:26.508\nwe'll carry on looking\nat those processes and\n\n29\n00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:30.130\nwhat activities are performed\nwithin service operation.\n\n30\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.095\nSo just recap,\n\n31\n00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:36.245\nthe service operation lifecycle phase is\nthe business as usual lifecycle phase.\n\n32\n00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:39.442\nSo this is where we are delivering and\nmaintaining and\n\n33\n00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:43.570\nrunning those services in\nthat live environment.\n\n34\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.920\nSo, the next section then that we are\ngoing to look at really is the activities\n\n35\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.130\nthat are contained within\nthe Internet/Web management arena.\n\n36\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.224\nYou might have a different team\nthat manages your Internet or\n\n37\n00:01:58.224 --> 00:01:59.838\nyour intranet as well.\n\n38\n00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:01.890\nAnd you might even have two teams.\n\n39\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.570\nYou might have one team that looks at\nintranet and manages all of the services\n\n40\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.410\non the intranet, including things like\nthe service catalog, for instance.\n\n41\n00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.900\nYou might have a separate team\nthat manages the Internet,\n\n42\n00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.652\nwhich is the external web page that\nyour external customers will look at.\n\n43\n00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:24.510\nOne thing's very,\n\n44\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.500\nvery clear though, you need to have\na standard for web development.\n\n45\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.780\nBecause you have to have a brand.\n\n46\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.590\nYou have to have a brand image.\n\n47\n00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.225\nAnd it doesn't matter what\nsize organization you are and\n\n48\n00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:41.705\nwhat arena you're in, what industry sector\nyou're in, you have to have a brand image.\n\n49\n00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:43.265\nAnd that's really important.\n\n50\n00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:45.119\nThere has to be that consistency.\n\n51\n00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.602\nAnd it's something that even very,\nvery small organizations,\n\n52\n00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:53.020\nI mentioned in the last section,\nyou might have a chain of coffee shops.\n\n53\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.040\nEven a chain of coffee shops has\na logo and has a brand image.\n\n54\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.200\nAnd so that's something that we have\nto carry through to our Internet sites.\n\n55\n00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.073\nAnd whether it be an Internet site for\nexternal customers or\n\n56\n00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:10.561\nwhether it be an intranet site for\nour internal teams.\n\n57\n00:03:10.561 --> 00:03:14.700\nNevertheless, we still need to have\na brand image in our standards.\n\n58\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.860\nThis is gonna be the look and\nfeel of our Internet site, okay.\n\n59\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.250\nI mean,\neven here at ITProTV we've got a logo.\n\n60\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.330\nSo, we have this brand image and\n\n61\n00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.740\nthat's what we've got to maintain\nwithin this particular team.\n\n62\n00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.780\nThere's nothing wrong with using\nan external organization to\n\n63\n00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.595\nhelp us with this and\na lot of organizations do that.\n\n64\n00:03:36.595 --> 00:03:39.565\nThen it's just an external\nservice provider as we call it.\n\n65\n00:03:39.565 --> 00:03:44.953\nAnd supply management will mange that\nparticular contract with that supplier or\n\n66\n00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:45.910\nthat vendor.\n\n67\n00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:49.940\nWhat's very key is that we've gotta\nwork with application management,\n\n68\n00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.320\nwe've gotta work with\ntechnical management teams.\n\n69\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.149\nAnd we've also gotta work\nwith our business as well.\n\n70\n00:03:55.149 --> 00:04:00.165\nA business will take accountability for\nwhat they want to\n\n71\n00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:05.086\nsee on the Internet,\nthe external view of our website.\n\n72\n00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:09.694\nThat really is down to the marketing teams\nwithin the organization as to what they\n\n73\n00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:12.080\nwant to show the world as a business view.\n\n74\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.200\nIT will take leadership of what\nis to be seen on the intranet.\n\n75\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.426\nNow, we may have a separate intranet\nteam that will actually look at IT's,\n\n76\n00:04:25.426 --> 00:04:29.415\nhow do I say,\nIT's delivery into the business or\n\n77\n00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:33.330\nit may just be something\nthat we do internally.\n\n78\n00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.905\nPerhaps by service catalog management\nbecause the service catalog is\n\n79\n00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:40.856\ngoing to be a key part\nof that intranet site.\n\n80\n00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:45.368\nEither way we look at it, and\nwe're in the 21st century now and\n\n81\n00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:50.220\nthere are not many organizations out\nthere that don't have an Internet site.\n\n82\n00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.305\nEven small, independent businesses\nwhere you have independent consultants,\n\n83\n00:04:56.305 --> 00:04:59.650\nthey generally got their\nown Internet site.\n\n84\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:08.040\nSo this is becoming more of\nan importance to a lot of organizations.\n\n85\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.220\nBecause it's not just enough that\nwe have that Internet site, but\n\n86\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.969\nwe have to keep it maintained as well.\n\n87\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.970\nSo that means maintaining content.\n\n88\n00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.270\nIt means ensuring that\ncontent is up to date and\n\n89\n00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.670\nthat we have the right information\nin the content as well.\n\n90\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.030\nThere's a difference between\nkeeping what we have up to date and\n\n91\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.420\nthen adding in new content and\nkeeping our relevance up to date as well.\n\n92\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.110\nSo then another activity then we have,\nnow this sits within\n\n93\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.710\nour IT operations function itself,\nour functional area.\n\n94\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.380\nWe have data center management,\nand facilities management.\n\n95\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.540\nNow you will see that we're talking about\nmanagement of the physical environment.\n\n96\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.210\nWe're talking about buildings management.\n\n97\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.480\nWe're talking about\ndata center management.\n\n98\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.010\nWe're talking about equipment,\nwe're talking about power and UPSs and\n\n99\n00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.240\nenvironmental conditions,\nlike air conditioning, etc.\n\n100\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.019\nAnd people say to me, quite often I\nget asked, why is facilities in IT?\n\n101\n00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:13.353\nWell, I always refer them\nback to service strategy and\n\n102\n00:06:13.353 --> 00:06:17.970\nservice design where we actually\nidentify the components of a service.\n\n103\n00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.882\nAnd the components of a service are all\nof those configuration items that make up\n\n104\n00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:27.220\na service that quite simply we\ncouldn't have a service without them.\n\n105\n00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.215\nSo service is a means of delivering value\nby facilitating outcomes the customers\n\n106\n00:06:32.215 --> 00:06:36.410\nwant to achieve without the ownership\nof specific costs and risks.\n\n107\n00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.840\nThat's the ITIL definition\nof this service.\n\n108\n00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.960\nIn other words, we want to deliver value,\nwe want to facilitate an outcome,\n\n109\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.681\nthat outcome being is that, let's say for\n\n110\n00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:50.160\nexample, I want to enable our\nbusiness to send and receive email.\n\n111\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.717\nSo let me ask you Ronnie then, if I\nwant to enable our business to send and\n\n112\n00:06:55.717 --> 00:06:59.546\nreceive email, what do they need in\norder to send and receive email?\n\n113\n00:06:59.546 --> 00:07:03.391\n&gt;&gt; I need at least an email server-\n&gt;&gt; Okay yeah.\n\n114\n00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:05.859\n&gt;&gt; To do that and\nthen an Internet connection.\n\n115\n00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:06.921\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n116\n00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:09.380\n&gt;&gt; They're going to be sending it\nacross the Internet and the network.\n\n117\n00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\ndon't they need a PC as well?\n\n118\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes they need something to be received.\n\n119\n00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.032\nTo be able to receive the emails on.\n\n120\n00:07:16.032 --> 00:07:17.066\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n121\n00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:19.294\nSo they need a PC, and\nthey need the software.\n\n122\n00:07:19.294 --> 00:07:21.272\nSo they need the infrastructure too.\n\n123\n00:07:21.272 --> 00:07:23.125\nThey need the server,\nthey need the network.\n\n124\n00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:25.469\nThey also need somebody to install it for\nthem.\n\n125\n00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:28.887\n&gt;&gt; Yes, somebody to manage it,\nsomebody to install it.\n\n126\n00:07:28.887 --> 00:07:33.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, somebody to be there\nwhen something goes wrong, yeah.\n\n127\n00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.080\nThey need something else as well though,\nsomething that's really, really important.\n\n128\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.450\nWithout which I can't send and\nreceive email and\n\n129\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.720\nit's the one thing that we all forget.\n\n130\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.370\n&gt;&gt; I've forgotten it too, so.\n\n131\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI've got a cable here right in my hand.\n\n132\n00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.845\nNow, if I didn't have this cable,\n\n133\n00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:56.071\nhow long do you think I would have that\nability to send and receive email for?\n\n134\n00:07:56.071 --> 00:08:00.448\nAs long as, just to your machine?\n\n135\n00:08:00.448 --> 00:08:01.318\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n136\n00:08:01.318 --> 00:08:03.144\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just to your machine as\n\n137\n00:08:03.144 --> 00:08:05.272\nlong as your battery will hold up.\n\n138\n00:08:05.272 --> 00:08:08.993\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, I need power.\n\n139\n00:08:08.993 --> 00:08:13.469\nSo people say to me,\nthat question, again, which is,\n\n140\n00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:17.980\nwhy is facilities management\npart of the IT service?\n\n141\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.050\nWell because quite simply, if I don't have\npower, I can't send and receive an email.\n\n142\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.990\nIf our servers don't have power,\nwe can't send and receive emails.\n\n143\n00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.740\nIf I don't have a desk to sit at,\nthen I can't send and receive an email.\n\n144\n00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.615\nWell, I can, all right, technically,\nI can go and stand in a parking lot and\n\n145\n00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:38.358\nI can send as many emails as I like.\n\n146\n00:08:38.358 --> 00:08:42.660\n[LAUGH] But trust me, I'm gonna get\nvery tired of that very, very quickly.\n\n147\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.597\nAnd again, my batteries are only\ngonna hold out for so long.\n\n148\n00:08:45.597 --> 00:08:50.397\nSo yes, it's really important\nthat we bring this into IT,\n\n149\n00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:55.197\nbecause it's a very important\ncomponent of a service, and\n\n150\n00:08:55.197 --> 00:08:59.860\nwithout it, we can't send and\nreceive email.\n\n151\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.803\nAnd if we take that component and\nwe give it to somebody else to manage,\n\n152\n00:09:05.803 --> 00:09:11.948\nthen we have to have a very,\nvery good relationship with that supplier,\n\n153\n00:09:11.948 --> 00:09:16.204\nto ensure that we do get\na consistency in service.\n\n154\n00:09:16.204 --> 00:09:20.701\nI have known a lot of organizations,\nglobal organizations,\n\n155\n00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:25.930\nthat have really experienced\ndifficulties because of this.\n\n156\n00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:31.409\nThere was a very large organization at\none point in time who not only lost\n\n157\n00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:37.549\ntheir life service because they lost\npower, they had a problem with their UPS.\n\n158\n00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:42.014\nBut this happened at a time\nwhen the backup data center was\n\n159\n00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:45.001\nundergoing essential maintenance.\n\n160\n00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.353\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so that organization,\n\n161\n00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:55.040\na global organization, was put out of\nbusiness for approximately 12 to 14 hours.\n\n162\n00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:02.163\nAnd that is simply because\nthe relationship between IT and\n\n163\n00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:08.660\nthe service provider providing the power,\nwas not mature enough.\n\n164\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:14.084\nIt was not well developed\nenough to understand that, yes,\n\n165\n00:10:14.084 --> 00:10:19.735\npower is a vital part of what we do and\nhow we deliver a service.\n\n166\n00:10:19.735 --> 00:10:23.708\nNow, sure, there were probably other\ncomponents in that as well, and\n\n167\n00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:27.286\nI'm sure that there are other influences,\nbut nevertheless,\n\n168\n00:10:27.286 --> 00:10:29.357\nit's a very costly mistake to make.\n\n169\n00:10:29.357 --> 00:10:32.065\nSo yes, we would bring facilities and\n\n170\n00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:37.909\ndata sent management into IT because\nwithout that we can't deliver the service,\n\n171\n00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:42.075\nwhich is why we talk about data\ncenter strategies as well.\n\n172\n00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:44.795\nAbout how we're going to\nmanage our data centers,\n\n173\n00:10:44.795 --> 00:10:48.084\nhow much automation we're going\nto have in our data centers,\n\n174\n00:10:48.084 --> 00:10:52.170\nand what about the type of\nequipment we're going to have.\n\n175\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.940\nThe larger the organization,\nthe more likely we are to have confirmed\n\n176\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.640\ncontract with preferred suppliers.\n\n177\n00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.530\nWe go out to tender and we will ascertain\nwhich supplier is to deliver value for\n\n178\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.980\nus, in terms of money but\nalso in terms of functionality, etc.\n\n179\n00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.995\nWe may even,\n\n180\n00:11:11.995 --> 00:11:16.412\ndepending on our organization,\ngo down the route of virtualization.\n\n181\n00:11:16.412 --> 00:11:21.570\nAnd nowadays, again,\nI keep saying we're in the 21st century,\n\n182\n00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.060\ncloud computing is here, and\nquite often we will utilize the cloud.\n\n183\n00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.750\nNow that's very, very common for\nsmaller organizations now, it's not so\n\n184\n00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.780\ncommon in high security environments.\n\n185\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.310\nWhen we're talking about government,\n\n186\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.430\nand when we're talking about\nfinancial institutions.\n\n187\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.613\nI'm not saying that it's impossible,\nbecause it's not, I've known a lot of\n\n188\n00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:46.555\ngovernment departments and agencies\nthat have utilized cloud services.\n\n189\n00:11:46.555 --> 00:11:51.271\nHowever, we do have to have the security\nconsiderations brought to mind\n\n190\n00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:54.690\nwhen we decide that that's\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n191\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.140\nSo let's take a look, then,\nat some of the processes, and\n\n192\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.960\nwhat we actually do with in service\noperations for those processes.\n\n193\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.952\nNow I know that we mentioned some\nin our last session in part one.\n\n194\n00:12:07.952 --> 00:12:11.460\nAnd now we're going to\nmention other processes,\n\n195\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.161\nas we move through the life-cycle phase,\nand look at we do for these processes.\n\n196\n00:12:17.161 --> 00:12:18.575\nSo change management, well,\n\n197\n00:12:18.575 --> 00:12:24.885\nchange management is all about controlling\nchange to our live environment.\n\n198\n00:12:24.885 --> 00:12:31.200\nAnd ensuring that our infrastructure is\nable to deliver the services that we have\n\n199\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.230\ncommitted to deliver, in order to provide\nvalue to our users and our customers.\n\n200\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:42.260\nSo here in service operation,\nwe have got all of the technical people,\n\n201\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.862\nwith the relevant technical skills,\nto be able to evaluate changes,\n\n202\n00:12:46.862 --> 00:12:50.068\nto be able to evaluate\nthe impact of any changes.\n\n203\n00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:55.603\nThe last thing we need is somebody like\nme coming in and plugging in a laptop\n\n204\n00:12:55.603 --> 00:13:01.360\ndirectly into a router, and finding out\nthat I've got a virus on my laptop.\n\n205\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.502\nSo the guys that are siting in service\noperation with these technical skills\n\n206\n00:13:06.502 --> 00:13:11.905\nare able to advise that this is not a good\nidea, this is not a change that we want.\n\n207\n00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:19.606\nSo these are the people with the technical\nskills within the arena of infrastructure.\n\n208\n00:13:19.606 --> 00:13:23.264\nWithin the arena of mainframe and\nserver management,\n\n209\n00:13:23.264 --> 00:13:28.048\nalso our operation center,\neven things like print scheduling, etc.\n\n210\n00:13:28.048 --> 00:13:33.247\nAnd these are the guys that will actually\nevaluate change, and will help change\n\n211\n00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:38.146\nmanagement make the decision as to\nwhether to authorize the change or not.\n\n212\n00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:40.332\nNow, I didn't say they\nwould authorize change,\n\n213\n00:13:40.332 --> 00:13:43.100\nI said they would help change\nmanagement to authorize change.\n\n214\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.564\nThey will do some of the evaluation,\n\n215\n00:13:45.564 --> 00:13:51.134\nthe authorization of changes still lies\nwithin the process of change management.\n\n216\n00:13:51.134 --> 00:13:55.450\nSo these guys will evaluate\nchanges as they come in.\n\n217\n00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.547\nThey will also then publicize\nchange schedules, and\n\n218\n00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:05.019\nthey will ensure that they follow\nthe change processes for any change.\n\n219\n00:14:05.019 --> 00:14:09.192\nBut they also implement change,\ntoo, they even go so\n\n220\n00:14:09.192 --> 00:14:12.580\nfar as to raise change requests.\n\n221\n00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.330\nBecause, let's face it,\nif there's been a failure on a disk array,\n\n222\n00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.640\nthen we need to raise an RFC, or request\nfor change in order to swap that out.\n\n223\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.170\nNow we did, when we looked at change\nmanagement in the service transition life\n\n224\n00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:30.630\ncycle phase, we did explore\nthe possibility of emergency changes.\n\n225\n00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.190\nAnd an emergency change is a change that\nhas to be implemented as an emergency.\n\n226\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:40.180\nAnd it's quite often the only change than\ncan be implemented in a change freeze.\n\n227\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.380\nNow, emergency changes\nare generally decreed to be\n\n228\n00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.430\nemergencies because of their impacts.\n\n229\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.310\nAnd it's something that has a high\nimpact in the live environment, and\n\n230\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.190\na high impact to the business.\n\n231\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.320\nSo, it's our guys in service operations\nthat are generally the people that\n\n232\n00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.600\nare implementing emergency changes.\n\n233\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.542\nAnd this is why I mentioned emergency\nchanges specifically, because it's usually\n\n234\n00:15:02.542 --> 00:15:05.772\nsomething serious, like swapping\nout a disk array, for instance.\n\n235\n00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:10.696\nOr like upgrading a component on a network\nbecause there's been a failure and\n\n236\n00:15:10.696 --> 00:15:14.271\nit's an emergency, and\nit has to be done immediately.\n\n237\n00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:19.499\nSo these are the guys that are gonna\nhelp implement emergency changes.\n\n238\n00:15:19.499 --> 00:15:22.324\nNow, in a previous session,\nwe looked at service asset and\n\n239\n00:15:22.324 --> 00:15:23.745\nconfiguration management.\n\n240\n00:15:23.745 --> 00:15:28.848\nAnd I mentioned that asset and\nconfiguration management's role\n\n241\n00:15:28.848 --> 00:15:33.949\nwas to ensure that we had accurate and\nreliable information about\n\n242\n00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:38.789\nthe components and\nthe services within our infrastructure.\n\n243\n00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:42.106\nWell, guess what,\nthese guys in service operation,\n\n244\n00:15:42.106 --> 00:15:46.013\nwell they actually see our\ninfrastructure on a day to day basis.\n\n245\n00:15:46.013 --> 00:15:49.661\nThey're monitoring,\nthey're doing event management, and\n\n246\n00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:54.420\nthey can see exactly what is happening on\nour infrastructure at any point in time.\n\n247\n00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:59.006\nWhen a component is swapped out,\nthere's a notification somewhere on our\n\n248\n00:15:59.006 --> 00:16:02.719\ninfrastructure When you turn\nyour laptop on every morning,\n\n249\n00:16:02.719 --> 00:16:07.449\nas you open up the screen on your laptop\nthere's a notification on the network\n\n250\n00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:10.030\nto say that Ronnie's now logged in.\n\n251\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.220\nRonnie has now connected to the network.\n\n252\n00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.680\nThere's a notification that says that\nJoe's now connected to the network, or\n\n253\n00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.740\nthat Joe is disconnected.\n\n254\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.730\nAnd we can see at a glance\nwho is on each network.\n\n255\n00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.180\nWell, it's because the operations\nguys have got the right parameters in\n\n256\n00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.590\nevent management that allow us to\nrecord the activity on our network.\n\n257\n00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.979\nAnd it's that accuracy of\nthe information that Service Asset &amp;\n\n258\n00:16:34.979 --> 00:16:37.500\nConfiguration Management\nare interested in.\n\n259\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.480\nSo something else that they also\ndo is remedy discrepancies.\n\n260\n00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.620\nSo when they see something that\nactually is not quite right,\n\n261\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.710\nthen they have the ability and the\nauthorization to be able to remedy that.\n\n262\n00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.830\nSo let's say for instance,\nI went away tonight and\n\n263\n00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:01.550\nI downloaded a new piece of software on to\nmy laptop, which is perfectly possible.\n\n264\n00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.690\nSo I downloaded a new app or\na new piece of software onto my laptop.\n\n265\n00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.620\nWhen I plug this laptop in tomorrow,\n\n266\n00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:12.631\nwhen I open up the lid, that laptop\nconfiguration will have changed.\n\n267\n00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.280\nSo our service operations guys using\nevent management will actually be able\n\n268\n00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:25.530\nto detect that the configuration of this\nparticular laptop has changed overnight.\n\n269\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.710\nAnd so I would expect them\nto change that CI status and\n\n270\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.220\nthe information in that CI to\nensure that the information\n\n271\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.040\nwe've got in our Configuration Management\ndatabase is accurate.\n\n272\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:37.730\nBecause you see,\n\n273\n00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.840\nsomebody might be implementing\na change at some point in time,\n\n274\n00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:46.700\nI want to know how many laptops have got\nthat particular piece of software on it.\n\n275\n00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.270\nSo it's important that these guys\nare able to react to changes and\n\n276\n00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.240\nare able to update.\n\n277\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.830\nNow, l mentioned that service operation\n\n278\n00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.880\nactually takes part in\nimplementation of changes.\n\n279\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.150\nAnd so,\nwhen we talk about large changes and\n\n280\n00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:08.070\nwe talk about changes that are affecting\nthe entire organization and\n\n281\n00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.000\nchanges that go through Release and\nDeployment Management.\n\n282\n00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.177\nWell, it's these guys that\nactually perform the release.\n\n283\n00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:17.165\nAnd Release and Deployment Management\nis service transition.\n\n284\n00:18:17.165 --> 00:18:22.754\nWe talked about the types of release\nthat we have such as big bang or phased,\n\n285\n00:18:22.754 --> 00:18:28.538\npush or pull, automated or manual,\nit's these guys that gotta do the work.\n\n286\n00:18:28.538 --> 00:18:31.345\nIt's these guys that push out releases or\n\n287\n00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:35.310\nautomate releases at\ncertain times of the day.\n\n288\n00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:39.277\nMost releases nowadays occur\nat 2:00 in the morning.\n\n289\n00:18:39.277 --> 00:18:43.176\nI don't want a release to occur at 10:00\nin the morning, thank you very much.\n\n290\n00:18:43.176 --> 00:18:46.714\nSo it's these guys that are gonna\nschedule that, and it's these guys in\n\n291\n00:18:46.714 --> 00:18:51.275\nservice operation that are gonna be here\nat 2:00 in the morning, that are actually\n\n292\n00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:54.719\nmanaging the release to make sure\nit goes out without any problems.\n\n293\n00:18:54.719 --> 00:18:59.185\nSo they have involvement in a Release and\nDeployment Management, as it says,\n\n294\n00:18:59.185 --> 00:19:02.375\nparticipation and\nimplementation of major releases.\n\n295\n00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:07.181\nThey might even do the physical\nhandling of CIs, okay.\n\n296\n00:19:07.181 --> 00:19:11.024\nAnd it talks about\nthe definitive media library and\n\n297\n00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:14.069\nthe physical handling of software CIs.\n\n298\n00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:18.284\nBut I'm not just talking about\nreleasing software from that DML,\n\n299\n00:19:18.284 --> 00:19:22.020\nfrom that shade area where\nyour software is located.\n\n300\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:27.230\nI'm also talking about physical\nhandling of CIs too, hardware CIs.\n\n301\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:31.447\nThese may be the guys that\nare actually in the data center,\n\n302\n00:19:31.447 --> 00:19:35.620\nin the server room putting in\na new server into that rack.\n\n303\n00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.580\nThese are the people that may well\nbe doing that physically too.\n\n304\n00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.980\nAnd then the next two slides,\n\n305\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.460\nbefore we take a break for this particular\nsection and then we will move on to\n\n306\n00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.480\na new session where we carry on looking at\nthis relationships with these processes.\n\n307\n00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.230\nI'm going to look at Capacity Management\nand Demand Management.\n\n308\n00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.540\nNow Capacity Management is a process\nsits in service design and\n\n309\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.280\ndemand management is a process\nsits in service strategy.\n\n310\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.925\nCapacity Management is concerned with\n\n311\n00:20:08.925 --> 00:20:13.049\nensuring that we've got enough capacity\nto meet the needs of the organization.\n\n312\n00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.700\nNow, when I see words like performance,\nI automatically think Capacity Management.\n\n313\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.220\nBecause we're talking about disk space,\nwe're talking about bandwidth,\n\n314\n00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.670\nwe're talking about whether\nwe've got enough memory or\n\n315\n00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:30.490\nenough processing speed to be able to\nmeet the needs of the organization.\n\n316\n00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.200\nSo anything to do with performance is\nto do with Capacity Management and\n\n317\n00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.640\nCapacity Management is split into two.\n\n318\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.870\nIt's split into the planning for\ncapacity, and it's\n\n319\n00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:47.440\nalso split into reactively addressing any\ncapacity incidents that may come along.\n\n320\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.560\nSo anything that's impacted capacity,\n\n321\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.110\nwhere we've got a new change that\nsuddenly uses up a huge amount of\n\n322\n00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:58.220\nbandwidth on that network then\nCapacity Management is going to step in.\n\n323\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:03.630\nAnd they might utilize something like\nworkload management to allow us to meet\n\n324\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.500\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n325\n00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.132\nCapacity Management is what you might\nconsider to be a technical job.\n\n326\n00:21:10.132 --> 00:21:14.789\nSo it's done by the guys in service\noperation, by the network guys,\n\n327\n00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:18.565\nby the server guys because\nwe're talking about space,\n\n328\n00:21:18.565 --> 00:21:21.074\nwe're talking about performance.\n\n329\n00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:25.868\nAnd so the teams that we mentioned in\nsection one, such as the storage teams,\n\n330\n00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:30.054\nand the mainframe guys, and\nthe infrastructure, and network guys,\n\n331\n00:21:30.054 --> 00:21:34.874\nthese are the people that are going\nto be performing capacity management.\n\n332\n00:21:34.874 --> 00:21:38.199\nIncluding, look at that second bullet\npoint where it talks about setting\n\n333\n00:21:38.199 --> 00:21:41.150\nalarm thresholds with events management.\n\n334\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.608\nIn a previous section, in part one\nactually in this session, we mentioned\n\n335\n00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:50.082\nthe fact that these targets would be\nin our operational level agreements.\n\n336\n00:21:50.082 --> 00:21:54.083\nThey're not gonna be in our SLAs with our\ncustomer because we know our customers\n\n337\n00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:57.247\naren't particularly technical,\nand they don't need to be,\n\n338\n00:21:57.247 --> 00:21:58.635\nthey've got us to do that.\n\n339\n00:21:58.635 --> 00:22:04.794\nSo Capacity Management sets targets for\nthe OLAs and it's our technical operations\n\n340\n00:22:04.794 --> 00:22:11.080\nguys that will actually advise on what\nthe targets are that need to be set.\n\n341\n00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.590\nAnd these are the people that\nare performing things like modeling for\n\n342\n00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.690\ninstance.\n\n343\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.656\nI like to refer to modeling as what if,\nyeah, this is my let's play.\n\n344\n00:22:20.656 --> 00:22:22.627\nMy let's pretend play model.\n\n345\n00:22:22.627 --> 00:22:24.121\nWhat if I do this?\n\n346\n00:22:24.121 --> 00:22:25.676\nWhat if we do that?\n\n347\n00:22:25.676 --> 00:22:32.040\nWhat if we increase the number of\nusers on our network by 500%, okay?\n\n348\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.201\nAnd that's what\nCapacity Management is doing.\n\n349\n00:22:34.201 --> 00:22:38.544\nAnd these are the guys that have\ngot the technical information,\n\n350\n00:22:38.544 --> 00:22:43.380\nthe technical expertise to handle,\nto be able to make those decisions.\n\n351\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:49.920\nSo this is why Capacity Management\nhappens right here in service operation.\n\n352\n00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.664\nNot only are we planning for\ncapacity in the future and our capacity\n\n353\n00:22:54.664 --> 00:23:00.370\nrequirements but we're dealing with\nany capacity issues that we may have.\n\n354\n00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:04.810\nSuch as that alarm threshold in\nevent management because capacity on\n\n355\n00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.300\na certain disk has reached 85% and\n\n356\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.640\nwe're a little bit worried about\nhow much space we've got left.\n\n357\n00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:17.948\nAnd this ties nicely into Demand\nManagement because Demand Management\n\n358\n00:23:17.948 --> 00:23:22.929\nas a process, you might think of\nit as part of Capacity Management.\n\n359\n00:23:22.929 --> 00:23:24.911\nAnd you know what, I don't mind if you do.\n\n360\n00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:30.441\nWe have it as a separate process because\nthis is about influencing user behavior.\n\n361\n00:23:30.441 --> 00:23:34.746\nAnd I mentioned this in a previous\nsession in service operation,\n\n362\n00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:37.496\nabout the purpose of Demand Management.\n\n363\n00:23:37.496 --> 00:23:40.755\nAnd Demand Management assists\nwith Capacity Management.\n\n364\n00:23:40.755 --> 00:23:45.088\nSo if you wanna think of it as part of\ncapacity, we give it a different name and\n\n365\n00:23:45.088 --> 00:23:48.700\nwe give it a different title,\nbut I'm happy for you to do that.\n\n366\n00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.299\nThe analogy that I used yesterday, or\n\n367\n00:23:52.299 --> 00:23:57.142\nin a previous session sorry,\nwas the fact that we.\n\n368\n00:23:57.142 --> 00:23:59.378\nTried to fly the day before Christmas,\n\n369\n00:23:59.378 --> 00:24:04.189\nand we realized that actually that seat on\nthat airplane is gonna cost twice as much,\n\n370\n00:24:04.189 --> 00:24:06.989\nbut you still gonna get\nthat same bag of peanuts.\n\n371\n00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.080\nWe use differential charging in\nthe airline industry to address that, and\n\n372\n00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.700\nwhat we're trying to do\nis to even out demand.\n\n373\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.150\nAnd you will notice in the previous slide,\n\n374\n00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.170\ncapacity management used something\ncalled workload management.\n\n375\n00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:27.573\nWe also utilize tools like load balancing,\netc on our network and\n\n376\n00:24:27.573 --> 00:24:30.063\nit's all about evening out demand.\n\n377\n00:24:30.063 --> 00:24:34.750\nAnd we'll ask access management\nto help us with that, too.\n\n378\n00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:38.620\nBut what we will do is\nutilize what we call demand\n\n379\n00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:43.670\nmanagement techniques in order\nto even out capacity usage.\n\n380\n00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:48.050\nSo, as it says here, rescheduling\na workload to run at a different time or\n\n381\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:52.170\nmoving a service from one\nphysical component to another, or\n\n382\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.080\nmaybe even virtualization.\n\n383\n00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.920\nIt's all about controlling demand and it's\nall about influencing behavior as we say.\n\n384\n00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.945\nSo it's one way to meet\ncapacity requirements.\n\n385\n00:25:03.945 --> 00:25:09.780\nAnd our operations guys, they need to\nbe completely conversant with that.\n\n386\n00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.470\nCompletely conversant.\n\n387\n00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.290\nSo these are the guys that\nare going to be doing this.\n\n388\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:21.062\nNow I promised you that that was going\nto be the last slide in this section,\n\n389\n00:25:21.062 --> 00:25:22.065\nbut I lied.\n\n390\n00:25:22.065 --> 00:25:26.750\n[LAUGH] Because I want to bring\nin availability management,\n\n391\n00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.950\njust while we're talking about capacity.\n\n392\n00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.830\nCuz availability management is another one\nof these warranty processes that we find\n\n393\n00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:41.190\nin service design where we are planning\nfor the availability of our services.\n\n394\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:47.660\nHere we are identifying potential points\nof failure on our infrastructure and\n\n395\n00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:48.974\nwith our service.\n\n396\n00:25:48.974 --> 00:25:54.240\nAnd we are performing risk management,\nand ascertaining whether we\n\n397\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:00.435\nneed to add in mitigation against a risk\nor maybe against the impact of a risk.\n\n398\n00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:03.714\nSo this is where we talk about\nthings like resilience and\n\n399\n00:26:03.714 --> 00:26:07.207\nadding in redundancy options.\n\n400\n00:26:07.207 --> 00:26:11.417\nAnd we perform techniques such as\nservice failure, impact analysis, or\n\n401\n00:26:11.417 --> 00:26:16.117\ncomponent failure impact analysis, or\neven a technical observation post which I\n\n402\n00:26:16.117 --> 00:26:21.938\nmentioned in a previous session, which we\nuse within problem management as well.\n\n403\n00:26:21.938 --> 00:26:26.068\nAnd these techniques will just\nhelp us identify failures.\n\n404\n00:26:26.068 --> 00:26:30.590\nAnd then utilizing analysis techniques and\nlooking at the risk and\n\n405\n00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:36.001\nthe vulnerabilities or the likelihood or\nprobability of that risk happening,\n\n406\n00:26:36.001 --> 00:26:40.544\nthen we'll identify what redundancy,\nif any, we need to put in.\n\n407\n00:26:40.544 --> 00:26:45.735\nAnd so this is tied hand-in-hand\nwith capacity because, you see,\n\n408\n00:26:45.735 --> 00:26:50.220\nwe do these modeling exercises\nwithin capacity, what if.\n\n409\n00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.430\nWe do this, too,\nwithin availability management.\n\n410\n00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.060\nWhat if this particular component failed?\n\n411\n00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:00.090\nWhat if we run out of space on this\nparticular server then what would we do?\n\n412\n00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.880\nCould we go to say chi out services for\nthe remaining space, etc.\n\n413\n00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.640\nSo availability management and capacity\nmanagement are also tied hand-in-hand and\n\n414\n00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:17.280\nyet again, we need that technical\nexperience from our operations guys.\n\n415\n00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.764\nThese guys that I've been talking about,\nthis operations team,\n\n416\n00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:23.587\nthey're absolutely amazing\nwhen you think about it.\n\n417\n00:27:23.587 --> 00:27:27.207\nThere's not one process\nwithin service operation and\n\n418\n00:27:27.207 --> 00:27:30.754\nwithin ITIL that they don't\nhave an involvement in.\n\n419\n00:27:30.754 --> 00:27:34.913\nYou think about it, and the more you think\nabout it the more you realize just how\n\n420\n00:27:34.913 --> 00:27:36.690\nmany skills they do really have.\n\n421\n00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.615\n&gt;&gt; And Jo, the more that you talk about\nthis, the more that, at least for\n\n422\n00:27:41.615 --> 00:27:44.454\nsomeone new like me to the realm of ITIL,\n\n423\n00:27:44.454 --> 00:27:49.148\nI begin to see that service operations\nin function or its process.\n\n424\n00:27:49.148 --> 00:27:52.822\nAnd what it's doing actually does seem to\nexpand the entirety of the life cycle of\n\n425\n00:27:52.822 --> 00:27:54.290\nITIL and what we have.\n\n426\n00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.740\nSo it's really neat to see all\nthese different activities\n\n427\n00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.570\nthat we can see and do right here.\n\n428\n00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.190\nSo anything else you wanna\nadd in this episode or\n\n429\n00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.870\nis that what we have for right now?\n\n430\n00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:09.268\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm going to save that for\nanother episode.\n\n431\n00:28:09.268 --> 00:28:12.202\nI think what we do is we just\nbuild up some anticipation there.\n\n432\n00:28:12.202 --> 00:28:14.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, that sounds great.\n\n433\n00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.850\nRemember that that's what you're taking\na look at here is more different common\n\n434\n00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:19.380\nservice operation activities.\n\n435\n00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.430\nBut this time, take a look at it from\nacross the different processes that we do\n\n436\n00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.670\nsee and the entirety of the ITIL life\ncycle that is right there for you.\n\n437\n00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.296\nBut there is more to come, just like\nJo teased right there at the end.\n\n438\n00:28:31.296 --> 00:28:33.140\nSo, you wanna stick around for\nthat as well, but for\n\n439\n00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.760\nthis episode, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n440\n00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.618\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n441\n00:28:38.618 --> 00:28:43.474\n&gt;&gt;

          "description": "In this episode, Ronnie and Jo dive into some of the remaining activities recommended by ITIL.  Jo mentions the key to keeping good service operations is making sure the communication between teams are effective and efficient as they perform activities that help the service provide value to the business.  She mentions that a great inefficiency that occurs between team is when the communication between them fails when working through a process.  The following processes were also mentioned: knowledge management should result DIKW (data to information to knowledge to wisdom), Financial Management for IT services (capex and opex), IT Service Continuity Management (Proactive) and IT Security Management",

continuing on with more of these\ndifferent activities that we need to see.\n\n16\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.490\nIn the previous episode, it was really\nneat to be able to take a look at how,\n\n17\n00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.890\nI think that the words that I use\nis intertwined or interwoven,\n\n18\n00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.100\nthat service operations seems to also\ntake throughout the entire life cycle.\n\n19\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.840\nSo, what are we gonna be taking a look\nat as we move through this particular\n\n20\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.590\nepisode here?\n\n21\n00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're gonna take a look at\nanother three processes, really, and\n\n22\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.390\njust look at service operation team's\ninvolvement within those processes.\n\n23\n00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.410\nBut as you quite rightly mentioned,\nservice operation,\n\n24\n00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.440\nthese are the people that\nare actually doing all the work.\n\n25\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.860\nSo all of the processes that we have,\n\n26\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.660\nthe 26 processes that we have within ITIL,\nwell, these guys perform all of them.\n\n27\n00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.750\nAnd a process is just a set of activities\nthat takes a defined input and\n\n28\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.420\nturns it hopefully into a defined output\nthat delivers value to the organization.\n\n29\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.490\nSo these are the guys that have\ngot all the technical skills and\n\n30\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.070\nthe expertise to be able\nto deliver that value.\n\n31\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.160\nAnd that is exactly what they are doing.\n\n32\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.530\nWe are in the service operations.\n\n33\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.260\nWe are in the business as usual.\n\n34\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.160\nSo of course all of these processes\nare part of business as usual.\n\n35\n00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.970\nYou know having a project\nis business as usual.\n\n36\n00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.900\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Managing and\n\n37\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.420\ndelivering a project is business as usual.\n\n38\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.170\nThe fact that people\nare talking to customers and\n\n39\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.820\nidentifying their requirements,\nthat's still business as usual.\n\n40\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.435\nIt's not something that should happen\non a one off exercise once a year.\n\n41\n00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:11.318\nIt's something that happens, business as\nusual all the time, on a continual basis.\n\n42\n00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:16.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at these three processes here.\n\n43\n00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.090\nHelp us out,\nwhat are we gonna take a look at first?\n\n44\n00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, first of all, we're gonna\ntake a look at knowledge management.\n\n45\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.710\nNow, I've mentioned in previous\nsessions that knowledge management\n\n46\n00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.830\nis about insuring that the right\ninformation is available at the right\n\n47\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.000\ntime to enable informed decision making,\nokay?\n\n48\n00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.490\nWhat does that mean?\n\n49\n00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.870\nI want to bring your attention to the last\nbullet point on this slide, actually.\n\n50\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.800\nAnd we have words there, and\nwe call this our DIKW model, Data,\n\n51\n00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.480\nInformation, Knowledge, and Wisdom.\n\n52\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.870\nWhat this actually means is that we start\noff with individual data sources and\n\n53\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.250\nwith individual pieces of data.\n\n54\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.040\nBut to be fair, individual pieces of\ndata can only tell us so much, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.790\nI know that the component that I\n\n56\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.790\nhave right in front of me\nright now is a Mac Book, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.620\nIt's a Mac Book, that is the component\nthat I have in front of me, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.620\nBut that's all I have is just that piece\nof data about that particular component.\n\n59\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.650\nBut if I add in relationships\nbetween my components, because\n\n60\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.350\nanother component would be the network\nthat we're on, that's another component.\n\n61\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.040\nAnother component would be the software,\nthe services that I use.\n\n62\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.600\nAnd if I add in relationships\nbetween those data sources,\n\n63\n00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.340\nthen that relationship allows\nme to have information.\n\n64\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.570\nBecause the relationships will tell me\nthat now that this MacBook Pro uses\n\n65\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.890\nthese services, xyz services,\n\n66\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.800\nto which I have these licenses for and\nI sit on this portion of the network.\n\n67\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.660\nAnd that gives me information.\n\n68\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.840\nNow, I can do a lot with information\nbecause I can analyze information.\n\n69\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.890\nAnd that's what gives me the knowledge.\n\n70\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.980\nAnd we generally display that analysis by\nway of a nice, pretty picture or a graph.\n\n71\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.190\nBut no matter how we display it,\nwhen we display knowledge, when we analyze\n\n72\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.280\nthat to give us knowledge, it's with\nthe intent of making an informed decision.\n\n73\n00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.670\nAnd that's where we get\nthe wisdom from in that DIKW.\n\n74\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.030\nIt's with the intent of\nmaking an informed decision.\n\n75\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.670\nI mentioned in a previous section\nabout the fact that in IT,\n\n76\n00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.540\nwe have, well, reports just for\nthe sake of reports.\n\n77\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.815\nI mean,\nsometimes some organizations I've been in,\n\n78\n00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:39.670\nI'm just fed up with seeing reports\nthat nobody ever refers to.\n\n79\n00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.310\nAnd so we'll tell you that if you\ncan't make an informed decision, then\n\n80\n00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.190\nthat report, you have to really go and\nunderstand the relevance of that report.\n\n81\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.434\nBecause if it doesn't allow\nyou make an informed decision,\n\n82\n00:04:53.434 --> 00:04:54.844\nthen what actually is it telling you?\n\n83\n00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:56.891\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n84\n00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:00.998\nwhat does service operation have\nto do with knowledge management?\n\n85\n00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:04.730\nWell, service operation,\nthey maintain the data sources.\n\n86\n00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.790\nThink about database administration.\n\n87\n00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.350\nBut it's not just about DBAs,\nit's also about all of our\n\n88\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.320\nother data sources like our servers,\nfor instance, our network.\n\n89\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.170\nThe configuration management\nsystem records all\n\n90\n00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.540\nof the data about our infrastructure and\n\n91\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.020\nwhat is on our infrastructure and\nwhat our components are.\n\n92\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.000\nAnd if you looked at the last\nsections that we did,\n\n93\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.180\nyou'll notice that we had a reference to\nthe configuration management system and\n\n94\n00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.610\nthe fact that these service operations\nguys have got a responsibility\n\n95\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.660\nto keep that accurate and\nto keep it up to date.\n\n96\n00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.170\nSo, it all ties in.\n\n97\n00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.870\nAnd I love, and\nmaybe there's something wrong with me.\n\n98\n00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.797\nI will admit this, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:53.510\nBut I really love when I go into\nan organization in a consultancy role and\n\n100\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.360\nanalyze the relationships\nbetween their processes.\n\n101\n00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.060\nBecause it's quite often the relationships\nbetween the processes that don't work.\n\n102\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.420\nAnd that is what causes inefficiencies.\n\n103\n00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.500\nIt's not the fact that they don't have,\nsay,\n\n104\n00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.600\nan incident management process in place.\n\n105\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.880\nIt's that they have an incident\nmanagement process in place, but\n\n106\n00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.700\nit is completely separate to\nthe change management process and\n\n107\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.970\ncompletely separate to\nconfiguration management.\n\n108\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.630\nAnd so that leads to inefficiencies.\n\n109\n00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.490\nAnd I love when we do these\nparticular sections in classes,\n\n110\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.570\nand we look at the relationships between\nthose processes, because without\n\n111\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.810\nthese relationships relationships,\nthen quite simply we can't be efficient.\n\n112\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.990\nAnd without that understanding\nthat the service operations guys,\n\n113\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.210\nthe guys that sit here in our\nbusiness as usual environment,\n\n114\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.380\nthese are the guys that are doing\nall of these processes.\n\n115\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.580\nYou don't just have one\nparticular process to perform.\n\n116\n00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.640\nThroughout the day I might\nperform bits of, say,\n\n117\n00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.010\n15 processes, and I'll perform\ndifferent activities within each one.\n\n118\n00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.940\nAnd sometimes I'm even performing\nthree processes at the same time.\n\n119\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.450\nIf I'm updating information in\nConfiguration Management System,\n\n120\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.380\nI am performing configuration or\nservice asset in Configuration Management,\n\n121\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.900\nas we call it in ITIL.\n\n122\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.590\nI'm performing that, but\nI'm also performing knowledge management,\n\n123\n00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.550\ntoo, just simply by updating data.\n\n124\n00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.260\nI'm keeping the data up-to-date,\nand I'm performing two processes.\n\n125\n00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.080\nAnd we don't often realize that.\n\n126\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.790\nSo I, yeah, okay, I'll admit that maybe\nit makes me a little bit of a nerd.\n\n127\n00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.359\nBut I like analyzing the relationships\nbetween those processes.\n\n128\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.900\nAnd the next process is\none that is despised,\n\n129\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.990\noverlooked sometimes, considered\nto be a necessary evil within IT.\n\n130\n00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.006\nBut it's financial management.\n\n131\n00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:55.140\nWe sometimes see that\nabbreviated as FM for IT.\n\n132\n00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.251\nFM for IT, yeah, it makes sense.\n\n133\n00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.100\nThat's the title up there.\n\n134\n00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.152\nThe financial management deals\nwith what we call the ABC.\n\n135\n00:08:04.152 --> 00:08:09.398\nAnd now, I'm gonna start off with B,\nbecause B stands for budgeting.\n\n136\n00:08:09.398 --> 00:08:13.903\nAnd budgeting is how much\nmoney have I got to spend.\n\n137\n00:08:13.903 --> 00:08:15.407\nSo we're looking into the future.\n\n138\n00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:17.390\nHow much I've got to spend?\n\n139\n00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.580\nAnd accounting stands for how much have\nI spent, so we're looking into the past.\n\n140\n00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.240\nHow much have I spent?\n\n141\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.550\nAnd the charging, the C,\nwell, that's optional.\n\n142\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.524\nWe don't always cross-charge our\norganization and cross-charge internal\n\n143\n00:08:32.524 --> 00:08:37.356\ncustomers, but of course, we definitely\ncharge our external customers.\n\n144\n00:08:37.356 --> 00:08:41.274\nSo budgeting tells us how much we've got\nto spend, and budgets are generally set.\n\n145\n00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:46.728\nAnd I say generally, but they're generally\nset based on how much money we spent so\n\n146\n00:08:46.728 --> 00:08:49.850\non our accounts for the previous year.\n\n147\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.810\nThat's usually how it works.\n\n148\n00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.145\nNow, here we are in IT, and like I said,\nwe despise financial management.\n\n149\n00:08:57.145 --> 00:09:02.135\nAnd to be perfectly honest, it wouldn't\nbe amiss of me to admit that there's\n\n150\n00:09:02.135 --> 00:09:06.315\nnot many of us in IT that are really\ngood at financial management.\n\n151\n00:09:06.315 --> 00:09:08.095\nGenerally, because we avoid it, I think.\n\n152\n00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:11.485\nBut it still exists.\n\n153\n00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:13.449\nYeah, we've still gotta have money.\n\n154\n00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.350\nAnd whilst service operation,\n\n155\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:23.100\nlike everybody in IT,\nwe don't particular like to get involved.\n\n156\n00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.570\nOf course, it makes sense for\nus to do this.\n\n157\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:30.200\nWe have to be able to identify and\nquantify,\n\n158\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.020\narticulate, if you will, how much money\nwe spend and what we spend it on.\n\n159\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.430\nBecause you see, it's that, that gives\nus then the budget for the next year.\n\n160\n00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:45.610\nSo we divide our expenditure into capital\nexpenditure and operational expenditure.\n\n161\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.800\nCapital expenditure should be in the one\nof things that we buy, like a new server,\n\n162\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.430\nfor instance, piece of hardware,\nor even a piece of software.\n\n163\n00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.230\nBut then, operational expenditure\nis something that's ongoing.\n\n164\n00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.930\nSo our utility bills are operational\nexpenditure, our licenses.\n\n165\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.090\nIf they're ongoing,\nthey're an operational expenditure.\n\n166\n00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.290\nAnd we have to be able to articulate not\nonly the difference between the two but\n\n167\n00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.710\nexactly what services we're\nspending our money on.\n\n168\n00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.020\nSo bear in mind, that's not so\n\n169\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.160\neasy when you consider that a lot of\nthe components in our services are shared.\n\n170\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.360\nYet we only have one network, and\nthat one network provides access and\n\n171\n00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.500\nsupporting service and provides as\na component for all of our services.\n\n172\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.705\nWe don't have a different network for\neach service.\n\n173\n00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:38.070\nSo when somebody asks you,\nin service strategy,\n\n174\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.410\nto come up with a business case for\na new service, and\n\n175\n00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:47.020\nthey want to know how much it's going\nto cost and then what return on\n\n176\n00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.880\ninvestment they're likely to see,\nthat's not exactly as easy as it sounds.\n\n177\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.455\nBecause we have to take into\nconsideration all costs,\n\n178\n00:10:56.455 --> 00:11:00.025\nincluding cost of shared\ncomponents like the network.\n\n179\n00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:02.526\nSo how do we work that out?\n\n180\n00:11:02.526 --> 00:11:03.161\nWell, you know what?\n\n181\n00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:07.310\nOur operations guys are gonna be\nthe people that are actually going to do\n\n182\n00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.360\nthis for us.\n\n183\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.870\nCuz these are the people that are in\nat the ground doing the work.\n\n184\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.710\nThese are the people\nthat understand exactly\n\n185\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.400\nwhat components are being\nused to resolve problems.\n\n186\n00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.560\nExactly what components are being used\nbecause of preventative maintenance, so\n\n187\n00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.630\nbecause of scheduled upgrades, etc.\n\n188\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:33.920\nI really like the bottom bullet point\nin this particular slide, okay?\n\n189\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.010\nBeware of proposed cost cutting, which\ncan actually increase unit support costs.\n\n190\n00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.950\nYou know the routine, right?\n\n191\n00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.520\nWe don't wanna spend money on this because\nit's been working okay up until now.\n\n192\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.010\nAnd we've had three years worth of\nreliability from this particular\n\n193\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.630\ncomponent, so we have no reason to think\nthat it's going to fail in the future.\n\n194\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.150\nAnd then we cut budget to it.\n\n195\n00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.040\nAnd as soon as we cut the budget to it,\nwhat happens?\n\n196\n00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.566\nIt fails.\n\n197\n00:12:01.566 --> 00:12:02.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yep.\n\n198\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.813\n&gt;&gt; And the thing is that if we'd planned\nto replace that particular component,\n\n199\n00:12:07.813 --> 00:12:12.280\nwe probably could have\nnegotiated a good price for it.\n\n200\n00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.570\nBut because we waited until it failed,\nit's a last minute purchase,\n\n201\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.315\nthere's no negotiation involved.\n\n202\n00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:22.461\nSo it actually costs us more, which is why\nwe talk about increased support costs.\n\n203\n00:12:22.461 --> 00:12:25.679\nThe other thing is that\nwe're going to have to, so\n\n204\n00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:29.910\nnothing ever fails at ten o'clock\non a Monday morning, does it?\n\n205\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.220\nIt always fails at two o'clock\non a Sunday morning, right?\n\n206\n00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.130\nSo think about the support cost in getting\nsomebody in two o'clock in the morning and\n\n207\n00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.530\nthen trying to get suppliers\nin at that time as well in\n\n208\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.248\norder to rectify any issue\nthat you might have.\n\n209\n00:12:44.248 --> 00:12:47.410\nYeah, it's expensive.\n\n210\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.232\nIt's a bit like not getting\nyour car serviced, really.\n\n211\n00:12:50.232 --> 00:12:54.093\nWe like to try and put it off as long\nas we possibly can, but we know that\n\n212\n00:12:54.093 --> 00:12:58.303\nthe longer we put it off, the more\ndamage it's doing to the engine, okay?\n\n213\n00:12:58.303 --> 00:12:59.704\nAnd let's face it.\n\n214\n00:12:59.704 --> 00:13:04.816\nIf we leave it two long before we replace\nthe brake pads, we very, very soon,\n\n215\n00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:08.948\nneeds replacing the brake pads\nbecause we won't have a car, right?\n\n216\n00:13:08.948 --> 00:13:14.271\nSo we have to understand that\nthis expenditure is required.\n\n217\n00:13:14.271 --> 00:13:19.024\nBut you see, our financial teams within\nour organization won't necessarily\n\n218\n00:13:19.024 --> 00:13:22.170\nunderstand that unless\nwe can articulate it.\n\n219\n00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.880\nAnd it goes back to what I said in\na previous session about communication.\n\n220\n00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.626\nSometimes in IT, we're not very good\nat articulating things outside of IT.\n\n221\n00:13:32.626 --> 00:13:34.650\nSo financial management is very important.\n\n222\n00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.013\nIt tells us how much money we've\ngot to spend, but in turn,\n\n223\n00:13:38.013 --> 00:13:42.952\nwe've got to tell financial management how\nmuch we realistically have spent as well.\n\n224\n00:13:42.952 --> 00:13:46.204\nThen I wanna bring us on to\nservice continuity management.\n\n225\n00:13:46.204 --> 00:13:52.518\nAnd service continuity management,\nit's not just about disaster recovery.\n\n226\n00:13:52.518 --> 00:13:54.798\nRonie, let me ask you a question, then.\n\n227\n00:13:54.798 --> 00:13:57.988\nWhat do you think is the difference\nbetween disaster recovery and\n\n228\n00:13:57.988 --> 00:13:59.090\nservice continuity?\n\n229\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.924\n&gt;&gt; Service continuity is about\nproviding the ability for\n\n230\n00:14:05.924 --> 00:14:11.606\nthe organization to continue\neven if something happens.\n\n231\n00:14:11.606 --> 00:14:14.565\nWhereas disaster recovery is\nsomething jas happened, and\n\n232\n00:14:14.565 --> 00:14:16.346\nnow you're recovering from that.\n\n233\n00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:18.855\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, yeah, I like that.\n\n234\n00:14:18.855 --> 00:14:22.139\nI mean, I'd like to think that it\nwas fairly self-explanatory, but\n\n235\n00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:25.490\nyou wouldn't believe how many people\ndo get confused between the two.\n\n236\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.320\nDisaster recovery is about picking up\nthe pieces after something is gone wrong,\n\n237\n00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.780\nsomething major, something that the\norganization considers to be a disaster.\n\n238\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.840\nIt's about recovering from that disaster.\n\n239\n00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.740\nService continuity is actually\nthe proactive side to that coin\n\n240\n00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.750\nbecause disaster recovery is very\nreactive whereas service continuity.\n\n241\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.910\nOkay, we incorporate disaster recovery,\nbut\n\n242\n00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.617\nwhat we're trying to do is keep\neverything up and running.\n\n243\n00:14:51.617 --> 00:14:56.634\nLet's stop it, having an impact to\nthe business in the first place, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:56.634 --> 00:15:01.454\nSo service continuity and\nservice operations, well,\n\n245\n00:15:01.454 --> 00:15:04.050\nthe two are really entwined.\n\n246\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.472\nBecause its these operations guys that\nnot only tell service continuity whats\n\n247\n00:15:08.472 --> 00:15:09.146\npossible.\n\n248\n00:15:09.146 --> 00:15:12.248\nCuz sometimes, the business asks for\nthe impossible,\n\n249\n00:15:12.248 --> 00:15:15.000\nespecially given the budget that we have.\n\n250\n00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.376\nSo service continuity will ask us in\nservice operation what's possible.\n\n251\n00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:21.080\nBut these service operation guys,\n\n252\n00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.991\nthey are also the people that\ncarry out the risk assessment.\n\n253\n00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:27.663\nThese are the people with\nthe experience and the skills, and\n\n254\n00:15:27.663 --> 00:15:31.890\nthey actually write these recovery\nplans and continuity plans.\n\n255\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.290\nThey'll advise on resilience options in\nconjunction with availability management.\n\n256\n00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.360\nWe looked at that in a previous session.\n\n257\n00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.329\nThey'll also do the testing, too.\n\n258\n00:15:40.329 --> 00:15:45.400\nITIL recommends that you do a test\nof service continuity at least\n\n259\n00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.780\nonce a year, and\nwe don't just mean a run through.\n\n260\n00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.723\nWe mean a physical test.\n\n261\n00:15:52.723 --> 00:15:57.280\nThat's not something most organizations\nwant to do because of the disruption.\n\n262\n00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.231\nBut We do need to test\nour service continuity.\n\n263\n00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:03.662\nAnd one of the things that we forget about\nquite often in service continuity, and\n\n264\n00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:06.030\nwe'll look at this in service design.\n\n265\n00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.610\nBut one of the things that we\nforget about, is actually,\n\n266\n00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:13.029\nonce we move to this DR site, as we\ncall it, we've got to get back again.\n\n267\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:20.160\nIt's not very often that we have\na mirrored server, that we can just\n\n268\n00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.840\nflick the switch between the two, that's\na very, very expensive redundancy option.\n\n269\n00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.740\nAnd so a lot of organizations don't\nhave that for all services, so\n\n270\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.480\nwe still have that concept of the DR site.\n\n271\n00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.500\nNow with cloud technology,\nservice continuity has become easier.\n\n272\n00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.400\nBut really what we're doing is, we're\njust transferring that risk to somebody\n\n273\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.030\nelse and\nletting somebody else deal with it.\n\n274\n00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.900\nSometimes, hoping,\nthat they will be able to deal with it.\n\n275\n00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.220\nBut we need to have that assurance there.\n\n276\n00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.990\nThe other thing that our service\noperation guys will get involved with in\n\n277\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:59.940\nterms of service continuity is that\ncommunication during a time of disaster.\n\n278\n00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.160\nWhen something has gone wrong,\n\n279\n00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.230\nit's the service operation guys\nthat carry service continuity.\n\n280\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.560\nThese are the people that manage\nthat movement over to the disaster\n\n281\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.660\nrecovery site.\n\n282\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.010\nAnd these are the people that will\ntake over the communication, etc,\n\n283\n00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.800\nwith the business,\nto tell them what's happening, okay?\n\n284\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:27.180\nSo a service continuity should be embedded\ninto all service operation activities.\n\n285\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.590\nSo what about security management.\n\n286\n00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.850\nI know that we've addressed\nsecurity in some previous sessions.\n\n287\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.440\nWe also addressed sort of firewalls,\netc., on our servers or on our network.\n\n288\n00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.150\nThese are the guys that\nare doing event management, so\n\n289\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:49.470\nthey're doing that monitoring and\nthey're doing the control as well, and so\n\n290\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.660\nwe should be monitoring\nsecurity activities.\n\n291\n00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.020\nWe don't just monitor people\nlogging in and people logging out,\n\n292\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.710\nwe also monitor when people\nhave forgotten their passwords.\n\n293\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:04.720\nI know we covered in the previous session\nwhen we looked at access management,\n\n294\n00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.410\nthe fact that if somebody has forgotten\ntheir password repeatedly over a period of\n\n295\n00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:13.550\ntime, then maybe there is something\nthere that we need to investigate.\n\n296\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.860\nAnd so, our service operations\nguys are involved in this.\n\n297\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.950\nThey may also be doing sort of screening\nand vetting and maybe doing training,\n\n298\n00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.280\netc., as well.\n\n299\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.540\nThat depends on the size of the\norganization cuz some organizations have\n\n300\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.055\nseparate training teams within IT, so\n\n301\n00:18:29.055 --> 00:18:33.340\nsits firmly within operations or\nmaybe even within the service desk.\n\n302\n00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:39.600\nSome organizations have security in\nvetting outside within the business.\n\n303\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.030\nIt's not necessarily within IT.\n\n304\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.840\nIt really depends on the organization.\n\n305\n00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.200\nBut the more secure the environment.\n\n306\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.380\nSo I use, for example,\ngovernment departments,\n\n307\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.700\ngovernment agencies, our military,\nfinancial institutions.\n\n308\n00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.540\nThey are more likely to have security and\n\n309\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.970\nvetting as part of the organization\nrather than just being as part of IT.\n\n310\n00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.820\nWhatever happens, we have to have\ndocumented procedures for security, and\n\n311\n00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:11.800\nthey have to be adhered to by everybody,\nincluding operations.\n\n312\n00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.790\nNow you could argue that operations, well,\n\n313\n00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.650\nthese guys have got access\nto absolutely everything.\n\n314\n00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:22.660\nSo therefore we have to ensure that they\nhave the highest security clearance and\n\n315\n00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.360\nthe highest security levels.\n\n316\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.190\nBecause they've got access to absolutely\neverything, and they're also the guys that\n\n317\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.950\nare in here at 2 o'clock in the morning\n[LAUGH] doing the work as well.\n\n318\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:39.250\nSo, we need to make sure that for\ntheir safety,\n\n319\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:44.030\nrather than [LAUGH] anything else,\nthat people that have\n\n320\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.030\nthe access into the server, so the people\nwith the right security clearance.\n\n321\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.160\nSo that just leads us onto the improvement\nof operational activities.\n\n322\n00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:00.165\nAnd the last bullet point there is one\nthat's in big, bold, capital letters.\n\n323\n00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:01.795\nAnd it talks about communication.\n\n324\n00:20:01.795 --> 00:20:05.255\nAnd it talks there about education and\ntraining, etc., too.\n\n325\n00:20:06.465 --> 00:20:09.385\nI've mentioned throughout\nthese last three sessions,\n\n326\n00:20:09.385 --> 00:20:12.995\npart one, two and three,\nthe importance of communication.\n\n327\n00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:17.275\nAnd about the fact that we in IT\nare really good at talking to each other.\n\n328\n00:20:17.275 --> 00:20:19.560\nWe're good at talking amongst ourselves.\n\n329\n00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.290\nBut when it comes to\ntalking to the business,\n\n330\n00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:26.610\nwhen it comes to talking to suppliers,\netc, financial management,\n\n331\n00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:33.380\nwe tend to try to maybe\novercompensate sometimes, I would say.\n\n332\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.350\nAnd so, we've got to get our communication\nspot on because communication\n\n333\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.370\nwill cause breaches in security.\n\n334\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.790\nCommunication or lack thereof,\nwill cause processes to fail,\n\n335\n00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.320\nwill cause changes to fail\nwhen they're implemented.\n\n336\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.250\nCommunication really is the key\nto successful IT operations, and\n\n337\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.730\nto successful ITIL processes, okay?\n\n338\n00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.860\nAt worst, we might want to look at\nimprovement in terms of automation,\n\n339\n00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.980\nand improvement in terms of audits,\nand making sure we follow processes.\n\n340\n00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.130\nThe key to all of this has got\nto be effective communication.\n\n341\n00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, you had mentioned\nthe idea of when you go in and\n\n342\n00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:20.310\nyou do some of these where you're auditing\nthe processes and where they fail and\n\n343\n00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.260\nit's usually because those teams are not\nable to communicate with each other.\n\n344\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.200\nIn ITIL, is there a particular\n\n345\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.810\nprocess that we go through to ensure\nthat communication happens well or\n\n346\n00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.590\nto better ourselves in that or is this\nsomething outside of the scope of ITIL?\n\n347\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.430\n&gt;&gt; We embed communication to\nabsolutely every process.\n\n348\n00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.790\nAnd we're going to look at\nthe service desk in a later session.\n\n349\n00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:48.260\nAnd the service desk is responsible for\ncommunication to the users.\n\n350\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.970\nWe also have a process called business\nrelationship management in strategy that\n\n351\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.470\nis responsible for\ncommunication to our customers.\n\n352\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.950\nAnd we will look at the introduction and\n\n353\n00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.940\nthe difference between a user and\na customer.\n\n354\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.870\nBut we do have teams and\nprocesses that are responsible for\n\n355\n00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.090\ncommunication to the business.\n\n356\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:14.480\nCommunication within IT, I would like to\nhope, should be a matter of common sense.\n\n357\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.710\nIt should be a matter of us\ngetting on with each other but\n\n358\n00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.238\nit also should be a matter of\nus speaking the same language.\n\n359\n00:22:21.238 --> 00:22:24.342\nAnd we have a process called\nsupply management as well,\n\n360\n00:22:24.342 --> 00:22:28.770\nthat is responsible for the communication\nbetween us and our suppliers.\n\n361\n00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.220\nSo we do have processes that\ntake ownership of this.\n\n362\n00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:38.130\nWe look in the ITIL practitioners\nguidance a lot more at communication and\n\n363\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.830\ncommunication techniques and\n\n364\n00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.500\norganizational change\nmanagement techniques as well.\n\n365\n00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.167\nBecause we have to understand that\nwhatever we want to do in IT,\n\n366\n00:22:48.167 --> 00:22:52.305\nthere may be resistance from\neither the organization or\n\n367\n00:22:52.305 --> 00:22:55.843\nthere may be resistance\ninternally within IT.\n\n368\n00:22:55.843 --> 00:22:59.415\nSo, we do address these concerns.\n\n369\n00:22:59.415 --> 00:23:02.711\nNow, we don't have,\nI know I've said this previously,\n\n370\n00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:07.220\nwe don't have a magic wand that we\ncan wave over absolutely everybody.\n\n371\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:13.540\nAnd you can't always deal with\ninterpersonal issues and conflict, etc.\n\n372\n00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.940\nBut nevertheless, there's no reason why\nwe can't look at conflict management\n\n373\n00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:22.445\ntechniques to try and ensure that we can\ncommunicate the best way that we can.\n\n374\n00:23:22.445 --> 00:23:25.075\nAnd I mentioned previously\nthat communication\n\n375\n00:23:25.075 --> 00:23:27.345\nhas gotta be in the language\nof the audience.\n\n376\n00:23:27.345 --> 00:23:30.655\nAnd that's the real important\npart of communication.\n\n377\n00:23:30.655 --> 00:23:33.100\nUnderstand what are your audience values.\n\n378\n00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.290\nWhoever your audience is, whether it's a\ncolleague or whether it's the business or\n\n379\n00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.670\nwhether it's somebody external,\nunderstand what's valuable to them and\n\n380\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.330\nthen you can communicate\nin their language.\n\n381\n00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:46.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us out with these\n\n382\n00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.660\nlast few processes that we're\nidentifying right here.\n\n383\n00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.830\nAnd also remember that the key, of course,\nmaking sure that all this works for\n\n384\n00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.900\nyour regular service operations and\nyour day-to-day business, is gonna be\n\n385\n00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.110\nthat key that she's emphasized,\nwhich is, of course, communication.\n\n386\n00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.440\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n387\n00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.470\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n388\n00:24:08.470 -->

          "description": "In this episode, Ronnie and Jo discuss the functional area of Service Desk.  Jo emphasizes that the service desk is where the perceived value of the service is determined because it normally is the SPOC, single point of contact to the services.  This, she says, means that it’s important that the people with the right set of qualities should be there.  The service desk personnel must be properly staffed, then properly trained, says Jo.  She also notes that the perception that service desk is a stepping stone means we must be considerate to train and retain individuals to work it properly.",

00:00:08.365\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:11.563\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.563 --> 00:00:15.400\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.580\nYou're watching\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.540\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n8\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.460\nwe're diving in to taking\na look at the service desk.\n\n9\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.320\nAnd here to help us out is going to be\nour kid genius in ITIL, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.870\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.410\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie, pleased to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.190\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.859\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine.\n\n14\n00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.940\nNow, we've really talked about a lot\nin the service operation side.\n\n15\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.683\nNow, we're moving into using\nthe service desk here.\n\n16\n00:00:42.683 --> 00:00:44.510\nWhere are we beginning with this?\n\n17\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.798\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what we're actually doing now,\nthis is the first session where we're\n\n18\n00:00:49.798 --> 00:00:54.646\ngoing to take a look at what we call\nfunctions or functional areas, okay.\n\n19\n00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:59.646\nSo a function is, as we describe in ITIL,\na self-contained unit of\n\n20\n00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:04.630\nan organization and the skills and\nthe tools that they use.\n\n21\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.785\nNow, so far, in our previous sessions,\nwe looked at processes.\n\n22\n00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:13.960\nAnd processes are sets of activities\nthat our functions perform.\n\n23\n00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.160\nNow, in the last sessions, the last\nthree sessions actually, we took a look\n\n24\n00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.370\nat operational activities, and\nI also related them to processes as well.\n\n25\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.448\nAnd so in this particular session,\nwhat we're going to do, in this one and\n\n26\n00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:29.612\nthe next one in fact,\n\n27\n00:01:29.612 --> 00:01:33.457\nis we're going to take a look at what\nwe deemed to be a functional area.\n\n28\n00:01:33.457 --> 00:01:36.930\nA functional group of people,\nand that's the service desk.\n\n29\n00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.400\nNow, we're not gonna tell you how\nyou organize your service desk.\n\n30\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.630\nWe're going to talk in the next\nsection about the different types of\n\n31\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.150\norganization and service desk that you\nmay have, and different structures.\n\n32\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.143\nBut in this section, we're going to look\nspecifically at the purpose of the service\n\n33\n00:01:55.143 --> 00:01:57.405\ndesk, what processes they perform.\n\n34\n00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:02.426\nCuz as we say, processes are the sets\nof activities that they perform.\n\n35\n00:02:02.426 --> 00:02:05.242\nAnd we're going to look more\nat the skill levels and\n\n36\n00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:08.462\nthe stuff in levels that\nare required of the service desk.\n\n37\n00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:10.587\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n38\n00:02:10.587 --> 00:02:12.131\nSo Jo, as we begin here and\n\n39\n00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:15.643\nwe start to take a look at this\nidea of this functional area,\n\n40\n00:02:15.643 --> 00:02:20.027\nin the service desk area, what are some\nof the things we need to consider?\n\n41\n00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:24.963\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, first of all, we need to\nunderstand that, and I'd like to draw your\n\n42\n00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:29.417\nattention to the first bullet point\non the left-hand side there is SPOC.\n\n43\n00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:30.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; SPOC.\n\n44\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.730\n&gt;&gt; A nice acronym, okay,\nwhich is a single point of contact.\n\n45\n00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.860\nBecause the service desk\nis the window to IT.\n\n46\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.780\nIt's the first port of call for any\nuser within the business to IT services.\n\n47\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.500\nNow, when do you think people\nusually call the service desk?\n\n48\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.180\nWhen do they contact the service desk?\n\n49\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.120\n&gt;&gt; Normally, when there's an issue.\n\n50\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.212\nBut I know that we've talked about this a\nlittle bit earlier when we started to talk\n\n51\n00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:04.564\nabout the communication, either they want\nsomething or they want to know something.\n\n52\n00:03:04.564 --> 00:03:08.810\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so they'll contact the\nservice desk when something's gone wrong.\n\n53\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.982\nThey'll contact the service desk,\nlike you say, when they want something or\n\n54\n00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:13.388\nwhen they want to know something.\n\n55\n00:03:13.388 --> 00:03:16.798\nSo generally,\nwhen users contact the service desk,\n\n56\n00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:20.040\nthere's an urgency about it for\nthem, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.062\nThey'll either want something and\nthey want it within a set time frame.\n\n58\n00:03:23.062 --> 00:03:24.562\nOr they want to know something, and\n\n59\n00:03:24.562 --> 00:03:27.620\nagain, they probably want to know\nthat within a set time frame.\n\n60\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.810\nAnd they'll contact the service\ndesk when something has gone wrong.\n\n61\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.480\nAnd generally, they [LAUGH] want that\nsorted out within a set time frame too.\n\n62\n00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.110\nSo service level agreements and service\nlevel management process is an input\n\n63\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.510\ninto the service desk functional area and\ninto the service desk team, okay.\n\n64\n00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.994\nThe idea of the service desk is to ensure\nthat we deliver value to the business.\n\n65\n00:03:49.994 --> 00:03:54.670\nAnd so we provide that contact point for\nthe organization.\n\n66\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.370\nIt talks in the top right-hand\ncorner there about reducing\n\n67\n00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.680\nnegative business impact.\n\n68\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.001\nBecause hopefully,\n\n69\n00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:05.117\nwe're resolving incidents within\nthose service level targets.\n\n70\n00:04:05.117 --> 00:04:08.520\nOkay, we're also there to provide\ninformation, and not just for\n\n71\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.098\nthe business, but\nalso from management as well.\n\n72\n00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:15.667\nBecause we produce reports on the service\ndesk on the performance of the services,\n\n73\n00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:18.750\nand also,\non the performance of incident management.\n\n74\n00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So how quickly we resolve any issues,\n\n75\n00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.490\nokay?\n\n76\n00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.550\nSo we'll talk a little\nbit later on in our next\n\n77\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.180\nsection about the type of\nservice desks that we have.\n\n78\n00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.250\nAnd the service desks structures\nthat are available to us.\n\n79\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.617\nAnd also, things like how we scale for\nusability and for geography, etc.\n\n80\n00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:40.190\nAnd also,\n\n81\n00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.310\nthe scope of services and the skill levels\nthat are required in the service desk.\n\n82\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.110\nYou see, the service desk is\nthat single point of contact.\n\n83\n00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.537\nThat's what it is, it's the window to IT.\n\n84\n00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:54.785\nAnd as such,\na really good service desk, well,\n\n85\n00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:59.080\na good service desk is going to\nset the valued perception for IT.\n\n86\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.610\nA bad service desk's also gonna set\nthe value perception for IT as well.\n\n87\n00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.900\nWhen you call the service desk as a user,\nif you have somebody who\n\n88\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.030\nis on the other end of the phone who's\nwilling to help, and who is polite, and\n\n89\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.870\ncourteous, and professional, and\nseems to know what they're talking about.\n\n90\n00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.140\nAnd it doesn't matter what type of this\n[LAUGH] organizational chaos is going on\n\n91\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.728\nat the background, that's the perception\nof IT that the user gets.\n\n92\n00:05:25.728 --> 00:05:30.300\nIf you called the service desk and\nyou are speaking to somebody who\n\n93\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.190\ndoesn't necessarily have\nthe right level of experience.\n\n94\n00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.110\nOr who maybe doesn't have the right skills\nto be able to communicate with the user,\n\n95\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.296\nperhaps, they're in different languages.\n\n96\n00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:42.860\nAnd I don't just mean one's in French and\none's in Spanish.\n\n97\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.292\nWhat I mean is that that difference\nbetween the IT language and\n\n98\n00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:48.200\nthe business language.\n\n99\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.133\nIf you get somebody who really can't\ncommunicate with the user, then,\n\n100\n00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:55.630\nit doesn't matter how organized\nwe are behind the scenes in IT.\n\n101\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.518\nIt's still going to give\na bad perception of IT.\n\n102\n00:05:59.518 --> 00:06:04.810\nAnd therefore, that valued perception\nis not going to be as high.\n\n103\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.910\nAnd the last bullet point there,\n\n104\n00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.560\nit can be used as a punishment room\nby managers who felt recognized.\n\n105\n00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.060\nI have to say, and\nthis is a passion of mine.\n\n106\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.398\nI have spent most of my career\nworking with service desks and\n\n107\n00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:20.752\nadvising service desks, etc.\n\n108\n00:06:20.752 --> 00:06:23.240\nAnd it is really a passion of mine.\n\n109\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.040\nThe service desk, you could argue,\nare the most important people in IT.\n\n110\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.457\nBecause if the purpose of IT is to be\naligned with the business and to deliver\n\n111\n00:06:33.457 --> 00:06:37.948\nvalue to the organization and value\nis perceived, then as I've just said,\n\n112\n00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:42.108\nif we've got a good service desk,\nthen the perception of IT is great.\n\n113\n00:06:42.108 --> 00:06:46.210\nBut if we've got a bad service desk,\nthen the perception of IT is poor.\n\n114\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.950\nAnd it doesn't matter how good\nall the technical guys are.\n\n115\n00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.910\nWe could have the best technical brains\nin the entire world at our disposal.\n\n116\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.100\nBut all we need is a service\ndesk that feels undervalued and\n\n117\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.950\na service desk that where moral is low,\nand\n\n118\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.190\nthat's going to set the perception for\nthe whole of IT amongst the business.\n\n119\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.970\nThe service desk is really important.\n\n120\n00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.490\nIt sets the value perception for\nIT, as we've said.\n\n121\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.890\nAnd if you look at these objectives,\n\n122\n00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.410\nwhat they're doing is they're doing\nthat incident management role.\n\n123\n00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.120\nTheir login incidents their\nlogin request they do\n\n124\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.670\nin the first line of Investigation.\n\n125\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.850\nSo everything that we did\nin incident management,\n\n126\n00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.490\nin that process,\nthat's what you're doing, okay.\n\n127\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.027\nThey're escalating if they need to,\neither hierarchically or\n\n128\n00:07:35.027 --> 00:07:36.668\nto another functional area.\n\n129\n00:07:36.668 --> 00:07:40.068\nAnd if you're looking for\nexplanations into what those two mean,\n\n130\n00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:43.467\nthen take a look at the module that\nwe did on incident management and\n\n131\n00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:45.851\nwe'll explain that a little bit more for\nyou.\n\n132\n00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:50.024\nThey're also conducting customer\nsatisfaction surveys, cuz they're really,\n\n133\n00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:52.653\nreally concerned with how\nhappy our customers are.\n\n134\n00:07:52.653 --> 00:07:57.372\nAnd of course we mentioned when we looked\nat incident management about how important\n\n135\n00:07:57.372 --> 00:08:02.250\nthat configuration management system is,\nwith all that accurate information.\n\n136\n00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.570\nSo they're gonna be updating that, when\nthey to talk somebody and they realize\n\n137\n00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.950\nthat the information that they have is not\naccurate, they're gonna be updating that.\n\n138\n00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.841\nSo I wanna ask a question then Ronnie,\nbefore we move on to the next slide.\n\n139\n00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:21.900\nWhat kind of skills do you think\na service desk analyst need?\n\n140\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.560\n&gt;&gt; They need at least some technical\nskill behind them to do what\n\n141\n00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.070\nthey were hired to do.\n\n142\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.070\nBut they also need some interpersonal\nskills like empathy, to be able to listen,\n\n143\n00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.488\nand understand what they're\nhearing as well, they need to be,\n\n144\n00:08:37.488 --> 00:08:41.460\nthe ability to\n\n145\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.500\ntolerate some of the unusual things\nthat they'll hear behind them.\n\n146\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.820\n&gt;&gt; You're being very polite.\n\n147\n00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.632\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n148\n00:08:48.632 --> 00:08:49.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n149\n00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.340\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes of course,\n\n150\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.520\nto analyze the situation that's before\nthem, but there's probably a lot of\n\n151\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.820\ndifferent skills that we have right there\nthat we really need to think about.\n\n152\n00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.516\nSo, and more and\nmore that you think about it,\n\n153\n00:09:00.516 --> 00:09:03.561\nit's probably more\ninterpersonal skills as well,\n\n154\n00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:07.520\nthe ability to relate the tone and\nto look at it in a positive manner.\n\n155\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.580\nHere at ITProTV we talk\nof facing challenges with\n\n156\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.840\noptimism-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n157\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.740\n&gt;&gt; Is what we do and so,\nyou know included in all that is\n\n158\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:22.200\nthe assurance that we can also convey\nthat at the end we'll fix this issue or\n\n159\n00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.850\nwe'll address this issue and\nwe'll make sure you're satisfied with it.\n\n160\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.417\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nNow,\n\n161\n00:09:26.417 --> 00:09:28.158\nI'm gonna disagree with\none thing that you said.\n\n162\n00:09:28.158 --> 00:09:28.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n163\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.820\n&gt;&gt; And that was the first thing that you\nsaid believe it or not, because you said\n\n164\n00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.797\nthat the service desk staff-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n165\n00:09:34.797 --> 00:09:36.550\n&gt;&gt; Would need technical skills.\n\n166\n00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n167\n00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.630\n&gt;&gt; But they don't.\n\n168\n00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.139\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n169\n00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:44.500\n&gt;&gt; It depends on the role that the service\ndesk will play within the organization.\n\n170\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n171\n00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:51.400\n&gt;&gt; But we will need the service desk\nanalysts to have a technical bias.\n\n172\n00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:51.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n173\n00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.610\n&gt;&gt; But,\nthe other skills that you mentioned\n\n174\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.700\nare skills that can't be learned.\n\n175\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n176\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.322\n&gt;&gt; Technical skills can be learned.\n\n177\n00:10:01.322 --> 00:10:02.928\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n178\n00:10:02.928 --> 00:10:05.583\n&gt;&gt; And so it's really,\nreally important for\n\n179\n00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:10.320\nservice desk analyst to have that empathy\nto be able to relate to the users.\n\n180\n00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.660\nTo be able to translate, to communicate\nin the language of the users.\n\n181\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.860\nYou know I have used words like\ntenacity and I use words like.\n\n182\n00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.902\nWell I've had [LAUGH] words to\nmean like thick skinned [LAUGH].\n\n183\n00:10:22.902 --> 00:10:27.319\nSo Service Desk analyst, most of\ntheir interactions all the day long\n\n184\n00:10:27.319 --> 00:10:30.300\nare going to be quite\nnegative interactions.\n\n185\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.280\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n186\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.150\n&gt;&gt; You know what it's like yourself.\n\n187\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.220\nAnd let's face it, there's not one person\nthat's watching out here now that can't\n\n188\n00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.930\ntell us that they have not had a negative\ninteraction with the service desk,\n\n189\n00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.294\nbecause we all have.\n\n190\n00:10:42.294 --> 00:10:45.920\nCuz you know we only ever call the service\ndesk when either we want something or\n\n191\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.975\nwhen something's gone wrong.\n\n192\n00:10:46.975 --> 00:10:48.524\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, we're starting off,\n\n193\n00:10:48.524 --> 00:10:52.751\nas a user we're starting off with a\nreally, really negative perception anyway.\n\n194\n00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:57.580\nAnd when you call up, and it doesn't\nmatter what service provider you call,\n\n195\n00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:03.400\nyou'll call up and your first impression\nis always given by that first answer.\n\n196\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.470\nThe way they talk to you,\nthe way that they address you.\n\n197\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.290\nAnd the willingness that\nthey show to understand you.\n\n198\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.640\nThe empathy that they show.\n\n199\n00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.361\nIf you have trust in that person,\n\n200\n00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:18.370\nthat you're talking to on\nthe other end of the phone.\n\n201\n00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.950\nIt really really doesn't matter\nnecessarily what their technical\n\n202\n00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.940\nskills are.\n\n203\n00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.077\nBecause if you can trust that they will\nsee that resolution to the end, and\n\n204\n00:11:26.077 --> 00:11:30.014\nthey will find the right person to be\nable to fix your incident for you,\n\n205\n00:11:30.014 --> 00:11:31.639\nit doesn't have to be them.\n\n206\n00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:33.762\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you trust them,\n\n207\n00:11:33.762 --> 00:11:39.150\nthen you're happy with the level\nof service that you receive.\n\n208\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.440\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n\n209\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.970\n&gt;&gt; The technical skills can be learned,\npatience can't be.\n\n210\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.020\nWe can put somebody on the time\nmanagement course, but\n\n211\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.930\nthat does not necessarily mean\nthat they're going to be punctual.\n\n212\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.420\nAnd teamwork is really important\non the service desk, too.\n\n213\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.870\nThey have to be a team player.\n\n214\n00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.700\nSo, it's really important that we get\n\n215\n00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.260\npeople on the service desk with\nthe right level of interpersonal skills.\n\n216\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.130\nBecause as long as they have a technical\nbias, and as long as they have\n\n217\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:12.150\nan analytical mind, then we can\ngive them the necessary training\n\n218\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:17.282\nto get them to the technical level that\nwe require from the service desk analyst.\n\n219\n00:12:17.282 --> 00:12:22.474\nYou see, some service desks are not\nthere to be technical service desks.\n\n220\n00:12:22.474 --> 00:12:26.356\nSo, that first statement that you made was\nactually an assumption that the service\n\n221\n00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:29.190\ndesk is looking to resolve all\nincidents on the first level.\n\n222\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n223\n00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.470\nsome aren't, and\nwe call them unskilled service desks.\n\n224\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.553\nThese are service desks that\nact as a rooting feature,\n\n225\n00:12:38.553 --> 00:12:41.855\nrouting feature to other technical areas.\n\n226\n00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:45.840\nSo,it really depends on the skill\nlevels that you require.\n\n227\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.660\n&gt;&gt; Now Joe,\n\n228\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.705\nl am not gonna disagree with you cuz l\nagree with everything that you said.\n\n229\n00:12:49.705 --> 00:12:55.086\nBut when we call the service desk,\nwe're expecting the help on the other end.\n\n230\n00:12:55.086 --> 00:13:00.486\nSo even though that person may be helpful\nand very courteous and energetic and\n\n231\n00:13:00.486 --> 00:13:05.155\neverything else, they are expecting\nsome technical knowledge.\n\n232\n00:13:05.155 --> 00:13:08.245\nOr that wouldn't have been put for\nany additional questions or\n\n233\n00:13:08.245 --> 00:13:14.150\nhelp in the number or in the email or\nin the the local Internet site.\n\n234\n00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.479\nSo, how do we deal with that?\n\n235\n00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:19.286\n&gt;&gt; Well, now, and\nthis is where we can be really sneaky.\n\n236\n00:13:19.286 --> 00:13:19.969\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n237\n00:13:19.969 --> 00:13:24.680\n[LAUGH] And I'm not saying\nthat we are subverting at all.\n\n238\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.449\nBut what I'm saying is\nthat if we have the right\n\n239\n00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:29.867\nknowledge management process-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n240\n00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:34.214\n&gt;&gt; Behind us to support us, then trust me,\neverything that you say to me, and\n\n241\n00:13:34.214 --> 00:13:36.629\nevery question that you ask to me or\nof me,\n\n242\n00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:40.370\nI can find the answer to before\nyou finished your sentence.\n\n243\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n244\n00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.510\n&gt;&gt; And so the skill level of the service\ndesk while we expect them to have\n\n245\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.665\na technical bias and a technical aptitude.\n\n246\n00:13:47.665 --> 00:13:48.960\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n247\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.040\n&gt;&gt; We don't necessarily need them to be as\ntechnical as third level support people.\n\n248\n00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.227\nWe really don't, because if this is\nsafe we've got the right tools in place.\n\n249\n00:14:00.227 --> 00:14:04.015\nAs long as you've got the right\npersonality at the other end of the phone,\n\n250\n00:14:04.015 --> 00:14:06.400\nthen we can find that answer for you.\n\n251\n00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.340\nBecause at some point and\n\n252\n00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.390\ntime you're gonna come to the service\ndesk with a technical problem that,\n\n253\n00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.165\nthat service desk analyst is not\ngoing to be able to resolve.\n\n254\n00:14:15.165 --> 00:14:18.885\nBut it doesn't matter how technical\ntheir service desk analyst is.\n\n255\n00:14:18.885 --> 00:14:20.150\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You don't expect them to\n\n256\n00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.279\nknow absolutely everything.\n\n257\n00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay I agree, again,\n\n258\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.570\nthat there does come that point where we\nall say that it's gonna be escalated,\n\n259\n00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:34.560\nor even on the service desk end where\nyou say, it's beyond my skill to do so.\n\n260\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.740\nBut I do think that people\ndo dial the expectation that\n\n261\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.290\nthey are going to get help right then,\neven though it's not realistic,\n\n262\n00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.920\nand I absolutely mean it,it's absolutely\nunrealistic, they do think that they\n\n263\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.050\nare gonna dial a number and\nmagic is gonna happen sometimes.\n\n264\n00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.035\n&gt;&gt; And maybe it does.\n\n265\n00:14:50.035 --> 00:14:51.601\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the thing,\n\n266\n00:14:51.601 --> 00:14:55.838\nif we've got the right supporting\ntools in place then magic will happen.\n\n267\n00:14:55.838 --> 00:14:59.013\nBut you see, let's imagine\nthis from another perspective,\n\n268\n00:14:59.013 --> 00:15:01.341\nlet's say that you were\non the service desk.\n\n269\n00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:02.173\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n270\n00:15:02.173 --> 00:15:04.757\n[LAUGH] Dear.\n\n271\n00:15:04.757 --> 00:15:08.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The service desk is\nreally high-pressured environment.\n\n272\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n273\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.600\n&gt;&gt; And so you are dealing with call,\nafter call, after call.\n\n274\n00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:17.335\nHow many phones calls do you think that\nyou would be expected to take per hour?\n\n275\n00:15:17.335 --> 00:15:21.692\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, let's say ten.\n\n276\n00:15:21.692 --> 00:15:22.291\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n277\n00:15:22.291 --> 00:15:23.179\n&gt;&gt; I say ten.\n\n278\n00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:24.563\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's one every six minutes.\n\n279\n00:15:24.563 --> 00:15:26.053\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n280\n00:15:26.053 --> 00:15:30.450\nSo how long do you think that you'd\nactually get to spend on that phone call?\n\n281\n00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.610\n&gt;&gt; I would assume two to\nthree minutes on the phone.\n\n282\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.729\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so you are expecting then if\n\n283\n00:15:36.729 --> 00:15:42.138\nyou want to take ten minutes per or\nyou want to do ten calls per hour.\n\n284\n00:15:42.138 --> 00:15:45.716\nYou gonna take one every six minutes then\nyou get two to three minutes per call and\n\n285\n00:15:45.716 --> 00:15:48.777\nthen the other two to three minutes\ncompleting the incident, etc.\n\n286\n00:15:48.777 --> 00:15:51.413\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; What's your chance of actually being\n\n287\n00:15:51.413 --> 00:15:54.552\nable to resolve that incident\nwithin two to three minutes?\n\n288\n00:15:54.552 --> 00:15:55.563\nNot very high.\n\n289\n00:15:55.563 --> 00:16:00.775\n&gt;&gt; Right okay, so I think sometimes and\nthis is one of the points that we make\n\n290\n00:16:00.775 --> 00:16:06.290\nwithin ITIL is that are unrealistic\nexpectations set on the service desk.\n\n291\n00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.827\nAnd we have ensure that we got\nthe right sort of staffing levels, and\n\n292\n00:16:09.827 --> 00:16:11.700\nthat we understand our call rates.\n\n293\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.550\nAnd we understand the types of calls,\nbecause what you were saying about,\n\n294\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:20.040\nand we have a discussion about\ntechnical skills on the service desk.\n\n295\n00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.790\nWhat you were saying about expecting\nthings to be resolved when you call\n\n296\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.850\nthe service desk.\n\n297\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.510\nWell, it really depends on the type\nof calls that they receive,\n\n298\n00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.520\nas to how technical you\nneed that person to be.\n\n299\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.260\nBut let's just say, that you are taken,\nand I mean as we look,\n\n300\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.990\nas we're talking, we could look at\nthat last section on that slide,\n\n301\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.540\nwhich is what we're\ntalking about right now.\n\n302\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.620\nLet's just say then that,\nyou're on the service desk and\n\n303\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.150\nyou are taking 10 calls per hour.\n\n304\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.120\nThat's one every six minutes,\n\n305\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.610\nthen if you're doing an eight hour shift,\nthat's 80 telephone calls,\n\n306\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.720\nthat's 80 different people that you\nhave spoken to throughout the day.\n\n307\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.110\nEvery single one of those telephone calls,\nthey're expecting something from you.\n\n308\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.120\nHow stressed do you feel\nby the end of the day?\n\n309\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.260\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's no doubt,\n\n310\n00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.930\nI think that the service desk\nperson does feel stressed.\n\n311\n00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.420\nHaving done it just briefly,\nand I mean for\n\n312\n00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.914\na period of two weeks before I was done.\n\n313\n00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:23.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did always come with that expectation\n\n314\n00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.138\nthat I needed to help someone.\n\n315\n00:17:25.138 --> 00:17:29.858\nBut that was me, and so I don't think that\nthat was expected of me from the people\n\n316\n00:17:29.858 --> 00:17:32.180\nthat I worked for at that point.\n\n317\n00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.700\nBut it was me hoping that I could\nactually help someone on that end,\n\n318\n00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.850\nand that every phone\ncall would be resolved.\n\n319\n00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.880\n&gt;&gt; But then that's exactly what we\nexpect from a service desk analyst.\n\n320\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.570\nIf a service desk analyst didn't want\nto help somebody then a service desk\n\n321\n00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.720\nanalyst wouldn't be in that role.\n\n322\n00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.060\nBecause somebody that doesn't\nwant to help, let's face it,\n\n323\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.790\ngiven the conditions that we've\njust describe somebody that\n\n324\n00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:57.850\ndoesn't want to help, is not going to\nfare too well on the service desk.\n\n325\n00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:03.750\nThey're really not, because you manage\nit for a couple of weeks and you say,\n\n326\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.840\nhey I can't deal with the stress anymore.\n\n327\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.560\nImagine if you were in a position,\nwhere you didn't actually want to be\n\n328\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.290\nhelping people and\nyou were on a service desk.\n\n329\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.434\nThen it wouldn't take two weeks before\nyou felt that I didn't wanna deal with it\n\n330\n00:18:15.434 --> 00:18:16.466\nanymore.\n\n331\n00:18:16.466 --> 00:18:22.242\nWe really underestimate the skills\nthat are required on the service desk,\n\n332\n00:18:22.242 --> 00:18:23.204\nwe really do.\n\n333\n00:18:23.204 --> 00:18:27.942\nAnd when we talk about the skill levels\nof the service desk we don't just\n\n334\n00:18:27.942 --> 00:18:30.560\ntalk about the technical skills.\n\n335\n00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.320\nThe technical skills have to be based on\nthe technical skills that are required for\n\n336\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.900\nthe users, and\nthe experience level of the users as well.\n\n337\n00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.870\nIf you've got users that don't\nhave a technical bias themselves,\n\n338\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:46.410\nthen they have a lower expectation of\nthe service desk than somebody who does\n\n339\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.860\nhave a technical bias.\n\n340\n00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.529\nThen you see, when we're talking about\nthe technical levels of a service desk and\n\n341\n00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:57.610\nyou're expect in things to be resolved,\nyou're an IT person, I'm an IT person.\n\n342\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:02.110\nSo yes, we have a different\nexpectation of somebody that doesn't\n\n343\n00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.320\nhave any involvement within IT.\n\n344\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.290\nAnd that's very true to say.\n\n345\n00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.994\nSo service desk analyst has to be in\ntheir position where they can translate\n\n346\n00:19:10.994 --> 00:19:15.772\nthe technical information, the second\nlevel, and third level support had\n\n347\n00:19:15.772 --> 00:19:21.245\ngiven them and translate that back to\nthe business, and back to the end user.\n\n348\n00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:26.692\nSo it's really important that\nwe value our service desk.\n\n349\n00:19:26.692 --> 00:19:32.142\nIt's really important that we give them\nthe tools that can help them do their job.\n\n350\n00:19:32.142 --> 00:19:34.929\nWe mention self help systems there, and\n\n351\n00:19:34.929 --> 00:19:40.333\nI've mentioned self help systems and,\nall types of tools that we can give them.\n\n352\n00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:45.733\nAnd even just sometimes the overlooking\nthe soft side of working\n\n353\n00:19:45.733 --> 00:19:51.830\non a service desk, that could\nreally help service desk analysts.\n\n354\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.780\nWe always tell you, and\nthis is right in the ITIL publication.\n\n355\n00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.370\nSo the service desk should be in a nice,\n\n356\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.500\nquiet area where they're not\ngonna get too many interruptions.\n\n357\n00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.860\nBecause really, if you're dealing with\nthat volume of phone calls you don't need\n\n358\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.860\nto have people walking past you and\ndistracting you all the time.\n\n359\n00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.700\nYou should have access to break rooms, you\nshould have access to vending machines,\n\n360\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.246\nyou should have access to\nrestrooms etcetera because you're\n\n361\n00:20:20.246 --> 00:20:22.560\na high pressured environment.\n\n362\n00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.200\nSo, it really our role within\n\n363\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.540\nIT to make that environment as\ncomfortable as we possibly can.\n\n364\n00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.120\nAnd there's even mentioned in\n\n365\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.880\nthat second from last bullet point\nabout travel considerations.\n\n366\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:41.170\nIf you have to travel for\ntwo hours in traffic,\n\n367\n00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.160\nor using public transport or\nsomething in order to get to work.\n\n368\n00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.610\nAnd then you're going to take\n80 phone calls per day, and\n\n369\n00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.530\nthen spend another two hours traveling.\n\n370\n00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.130\nHow long do you think you're\ngonna stay in that role?\n\n371\n00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:53.880\n&gt;&gt; Not very long.\n\n372\n00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.260\n&gt;&gt; So let me ask you the question then.\n\n373\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.460\nHow long do you think a service desk\nanalyst is expected to stay in the role?\n\n374\n00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.040\n&gt;&gt; I assume that it's gonna be a year,\nlet me say that, a year.\n\n375\n00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.890\n&gt;&gt; We would say between 18 months and\ntwo years.\n\n376\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:13.780\nWe should be looking at, and\nin fact it's actually on the next slide,\n\n377\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.020\nwe should be looking at staff attrition.\n\n378\n00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.980\nAnd we want, it's our natural instinct\nto hold onto those service desk analysts\n\n379\n00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.820\nthat are really, really, good, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.300\nIt's just our natural instinct, we want to\nkeep them our users love them, etcetera.\n\n381\n00:21:27.472 --> 00:21:31.320\nBut we've got to face the facts that\nthe service desk is a high pressured\n\n382\n00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.420\nenvironment.\n\n383\n00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:37.170\nAnd quite simply, you didn't want to stay\nthere for longer than two weeks, right?\n\n384\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:44.170\nSo, even somebody who's got that expert\nlevel of experience, and the expert skill\n\n385\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:49.650\nlevels, well, they're not gonna want to\nstay there too much longer than two years.\n\n386\n00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.860\nSo we need to factor that in.\n\n387\n00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:56.790\nAnd if we accept with an IT that service\ndesk staff are not going to stay there\n\n388\n00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:02.810\nforever, then we can show that we\nvalue those service desk staff,\n\n389\n00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.730\nby providing a career path for them.\n\n390\n00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.930\nBecause we have to accept that either\nwe lose them from the organization, or\n\n391\n00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:14.600\nwe lose them just from the service desk,\nand we move them to other areas within IT.\n\n392\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.940\nYou'll see before you a diagram.\n\n393\n00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.010\nA graph that looks at the skill levels and\nas we mentioned If we're just in\n\n394\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.500\na call center environment, and we have\nwhat we call an unskilled service desk,\n\n395\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.260\nthen I don't expect the service\ndesk skills to be very high.\n\n396\n00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.390\nBut, if we're in what we\ncall an expert service desk,\n\n397\n00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.440\nwhich is a highly\nspecialized service desk,\n\n398\n00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.040\nthen the speed of resolution is\ngoing to be higher, but then\n\n399\n00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.480\nthe staff attrition rate's going to be\nquicker, that's also going to be higher.\n\n400\n00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.759\nBecause as a technical person yourself\n\n401\n00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.810\njust think about how long you wanted\nto be in that environment, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.100\nAnd that's very, very true.\n\n403\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.130\nSo we've got to ensure that,\nwe talk about efficiency in ITIL.\n\n404\n00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.740\nAnd in ITIL, efficiency means\nminimal waste in terms of time, and\n\n405\n00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.090\nin terms of money, but\nalso in terms of skills,\n\n406\n00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.290\nhaving the right person,\nwith the right skill level.\n\n407\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.640\nAnd our resolution times that are within\nour service level agreements will\n\n408\n00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.300\ntell us what skill level we need.\n\n409\n00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:26.580\nSo think about then,\nhow we hold onto our staff.\n\n410\n00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.450\nBut also, how we progress them\nthrough their career, okay?\n\n411\n00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.962\nHow do we train service desk staff,\n\n412\n00:23:33.962 --> 00:23:38.821\nbecause as I've said you can't put them\non a course and teach them patience,\n\n413\n00:23:38.821 --> 00:23:43.103\nyou can't put them on a course and\nteach them to be punctual, okay?\n\n414\n00:23:43.103 --> 00:23:47.407\nAnd I really, really like\nthe second bullet point under staff\n\n415\n00:23:47.407 --> 00:23:52.381\nretention that talks about considering\na recognition scheme, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:52.381 --> 00:23:57.346\nOne of the most successful Projects or\ninitiatives I should say that I\n\n417\n00:23:57.346 --> 00:24:00.866\nimplemented in the Service Desk\na few years ago.\n\n418\n00:24:00.866 --> 00:24:03.275\nOr something that was so simple and yet\n\n419\n00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:08.530\nit sent resolution rate through the roof\nand it sent more else through the roof.\n\n420\n00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.120\nAnd it was something really really simple.\n\n421\n00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.960\nThat was within the hands of\nthe Service Desk Manager.\n\n422\n00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.980\nAnd I simply said to him,\nall you need to do is let's\n\n423\n00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.570\nlook at having an employee of the month\nscheme, where we have an analyst\n\n424\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.570\nof the month and we get their picture and\nwe put it on our board.\n\n425\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.450\nAnd what we do is we give\nthem an extra day's vacation.\n\n426\n00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.250\n&gt;&gt; Good\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n427\n00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:36.120\nit's not something that comes out of\nthe budget, it doesn't come out of any,\n\n428\n00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.730\nwe don't have to spend money on it, but\nwe give them an extra day's paid vacation,\n\n429\n00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.930\nand it's something that you\nabsorb within the Service Desk.\n\n430\n00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:49.930\nAnd every single month we know that we're\ngonna have to give 12 days paid vacation\n\n431\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.250\nevery year, and\nit's a different person every month.\n\n432\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.076\nAnd set some rules, so you can't have the\nsame person getting [LAUGH] two months in\n\n433\n00:24:57.076 --> 00:24:59.850\nadvance, so or [LAUGH] maybe\nthree months sort of in a row.\n\n434\n00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:04.700\nBut, set some rules and you know what,\nit was incredibly successful.\n\n435\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.680\nBecause we thought about stuff more out,\n\n436\n00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:12.380\nwe thought about recognizing the fact\nthat these people do an amazing job and\n\n437\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.930\nthese people are the ones that\nset the value perception for IT.\n\n438\n00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:21.230\nBut we also have to accept that\nmost people use the Service Desk as\n\n439\n00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.060\na stepping stone.\n\n440\n00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:27.600\nThat's an entry point into IT and it helps\nthem to learn all about the other areas\n\n441\n00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.370\nwithin IT and then maybe make a decision\nas to where they want to to go from there.\n\n442\n00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.830\nSo, I know that we jump around\non these bullet points but\n\n443\n00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.250\nthen go back up to the top and\nstart training.\n\n444\n00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.020\nWe should have a formalized program for\nstaff development.\n\n445\n00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.610\nWe should accept that they\nare going to move on, okay?\n\n446\n00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.600\nSo don't try and stop it,\ntry and accept it.\n\n447\n00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.520\nOne thing that we might want to implement\nwithin our Service Desk environment and\n\n448\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.762\nwithin our business environment\nare the use of super uses.\n\n449\n00:25:58.762 --> 00:26:03.773\nAnd super uses are people\nthat sit within the business,\n\n450\n00:26:03.773 --> 00:26:08.569\nthat act as a liaison point\nbetween the business, and\n\n451\n00:26:08.569 --> 00:26:11.564\nbetween the Service Desk and IT.\n\n452\n00:26:11.564 --> 00:26:15.540\nAnd so we could use them as the first\nlevel support for instance.\n\n453\n00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.470\nAnd we sometimes use them\nto run training courses or\n\n454\n00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.550\nto actually act as a communication point.\n\n455\n00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.940\nSo we may have new developments and\nchanges and etc, we'll utilize these\n\n456\n00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.650\nsuper users to deliver that message\nout to the business as a whole.\n\n457\n00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.620\nWe don't mind the use of super users, and\n\n458\n00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.510\nin fact we'll encourage\nthe use of super users.\n\n459\n00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:43.417\nHowever, what we will advise\nwith the use of super users is\n\n460\n00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:46.532\nthat all calls still must be logged.\n\n461\n00:26:46.532 --> 00:26:50.823\nWhen we talked about incident management\nyesterday, we mentioned the fact in\n\n462\n00:26:50.823 --> 00:26:54.570\nincident management,\nthat all calls had to be logged.\n\n463\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.929\nAnd that it was really important for\n\n464\n00:26:56.929 --> 00:26:59.995\ntrends analysis that all\ncalls were logged and\n\n465\n00:26:59.995 --> 00:27:05.515\nthat we ensured that we could understand\ntraining needs for instance of our users.\n\n466\n00:27:05.515 --> 00:27:11.500\nAnd business super users will act as\na contact point within IT but if they\n\n467\n00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:18.900\ndon't log the calls then we are not able\nto ascertain any training requirements.\n\n468\n00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:24.840\nSo of course our super users have to\npart of the IT Service Desk as well and\n\n469\n00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.130\nthey have to be a recognized part.\n\n470\n00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.210\nSo we're not telling you not to use them,\nbut\n\n471\n00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:34.720\nwhat we're telling you is that ensure\nthat if you do use super users,\n\n472\n00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.890\nthen make sure that they're considered\na part of the team as well.\n\n473\n00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.200\n&gt;&gt; And I think that makes a nice cohesion\nor that team unit that really brings\n\n474\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:48.090\nbonding and of course that ability to\nwork together well is kind of the key.\n\n475\n00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.440\nSo, Jo any other considerations\nthat we need to think about for\n\n476\n00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.660\nthis particular section?\n\n477\n00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.050\n&gt;&gt; No for this particular section.\n\n478\n00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.870\nIn the next section we're going to\nlook at measuring the performance of\n\n479\n00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:01.150\nthe Service Desk, and we're also going to\nlook at Service Desk structures as well.\n\n480\n00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:06.110\nSo, for this particular\nsection we're just going to\n\n481\n00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.898\nhold everybody with anticipation again.\n\n482\n00:28:08.898 --> 00:28:09.669\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n483\n00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:12.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nwe'll look forward to the next section.\n\n484\n00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n485\n00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.335\nremember that in this particular\nsection as we talked about the idea\n\n486\n00:28:17.335 --> 00:28:22.525\nof the Service Desk, it really is about\nthe person that we need in that place.\n\n487\n00:28:22.525 --> 00:28:26.045\nAnd it's not so much about the technical\nskills, but the right person and\n\n488\n00:28:26.045 --> 00:28:29.280\nthat was an emphasis that Jo really\nwanted to make sure that we got across.\n\n489\n00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.543\nBut there's a lot more to come\non the idea of Service Desk.\n\n490\n00:28:32.543 --> 00:28:33.915\nSo you wanna stick tuned for that.\n\n491\n00:28:33.915 --> 00:28:37.940\nStick tuned, stay tuned for\nthat one as well, but\n\n492\n00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.914\nfor this episode signing off for\nITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n493\n00:28:42.914 --> 00:28:44.145\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

00:00:25.250\nAnd today we're taking\na part two on service desk.\n\n9\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.840\nAnd here to help us out once again is\ngonna be our kid wonder, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.570\nJo welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.792\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:37.360\nEvery time you describe me Ronnie,\nyou come up with something different.\n\n13\n00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.162\nI wonder when you're\ngonna run out of ideas.\n\n14\n00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:40.443\n&gt;&gt; Probably in the next five minutes.\n\n15\n00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:42.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't count on me as being\n\n16\n00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:43.653\nan idea generating machine.\n\n17\n00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:45.292\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That I'm not, but\n\n18\n00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:49.308\nwe've already taken a look at a lot of the\nservice desk, especially about staffing.\n\n19\n00:00:49.308 --> 00:00:52.774\nSo where are we gonna begin\nin this particular segment?\n\n20\n00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:54.755\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in this section,\n\n21\n00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:58.726\nthis is the second part of\nour look at the service desk.\n\n22\n00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:00.537\nAnd in this particular segment,\n\n23\n00:01:00.537 --> 00:01:04.230\nwe're going to be looking at\nmeasuring service desk performance.\n\n24\n00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.199\nAnd also looking at the structures\nwithin the service desk environment, and\n\n25\n00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:11.270\nthe structures that we may see.\n\n26\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.924\nAnd structures that we may decide\nthat we want to utilize within IT\n\n27\n00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:18.260\nservice operations.\n\n28\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.920\n&gt;&gt; Alright Jo,\nit sounds like a very important topic for\n\n29\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.650\nus when we start to take a look at all\nthe service desk has involve so far, so\n\n30\n00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.010\nwhere we gonna begin right here?\n\n31\n00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well the first thing I'm gonna\nbegin with is that the understanding,\n\n32\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.370\nthe Service Desk actually sets value\nperception for the whole of IT.\n\n33\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.101\nNow we covered this in part one.\n\n34\n00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:44.537\nBut we need to reiterate again,\nright now, just before we get started,\n\n35\n00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:49.340\nbecause you see the Service Desk is all\nabout setting value perception in terms\n\n36\n00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.689\nof delivering value to the business.\n\n37\n00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.289\nAnd as we've already said, a really\ngood Service Desk could make up for\n\n38\n00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.572\na lot of chaos that goes\non in the background.\n\n39\n00:01:57.572 --> 00:02:02.031\nBut a really poor Service Desk will\nactually have the opposite effect, and\n\n40\n00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:07.056\nit doesn't matter how well organized and\nhow well skilled we are in the background,\n\n41\n00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:10.240\nif the Service Desk is not\ndelivering a good service,\n\n42\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.251\nthen the perception of IT\nis not very good, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:16.982\nSo the first thing that we're gonna\nlook then is actually how do we measure\n\n44\n00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:18.195\nthe performance of IT.\n\n45\n00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:23.343\nAnd in the last section, we looked at\nthe fact that the service desk skills\n\n46\n00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:28.090\ndon't necessarily need to be as\ntechnical as we originally think.\n\n47\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.540\nAnd so,\nit's all about delivering value, and\n\n48\n00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.940\nit's all about customer perception and\ntherefore customer satisfaction.\n\n49\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.050\nSo how do we measure what\ngoes on in the service desk?\n\n50\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.570\nWell the first thing that we've got\nto measure is customer satisfaction.\n\n51\n00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.190\nWe have to find a way to measure\nhow happy our end users and\n\n52\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.410\nour customers are with the service desk.\n\n53\n00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.000\nNow we can use traditional ways to\nmeasure service desk performance.\n\n54\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.870\nAnd if you look at the examples, we talk\nabout percentage of first line resolution,\n\n55\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.140\nand time to resolve an incident and\ntime to escalate, etc.\n\n56\n00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.870\nBut that's a very traditional look,\n\n57\n00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.540\nassuming that the service desk\nare going to be resolving incidents.\n\n58\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.320\nNow of course the rate of resolution of\nthe incidents is determined by the target\n\n59\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.580\nin the service level agreement.\n\n60\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.190\nSo we have to meet or exceed that target.\n\n61\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.260\nWe're not necessarily aiming\nto resolve 100% of incidents.\n\n62\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.680\nWe're aiming to meet or exceed the target\nthat's in that service level agreement.\n\n63\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.740\nBut what we are aiming to do\nis to keep our customers and\n\n64\n00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.090\nour users happy 100% of the time.\n\n65\n00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.530\nSo it's really important that we can\nmeasure customer satisfaction, and\n\n66\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.670\nwe will tell you that what\nis in your service level\n\n67\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.970\ntargets is important, but you should also\nhave a target for customer satisfaction.\n\n68\n00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.910\nI want to see that just as much\nimportance is placed on that\n\n69\n00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.460\nas it is placed on the actual facts and\nfigures of incident resolution.\n\n70\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.930\nYou see when we talk about assessing\nhealth and maturity and efficiency and\n\n71\n00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.890\neffectiveness, we're not just talking\nabout the incident management process.\n\n72\n00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.230\nWe're also talking about\nmeasuring fulfillment process, and\n\n73\n00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.920\nthe service desk as a whole.\n\n74\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.800\nIn a previous section, we look at the\nactivities of the service operation, and\n\n75\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.660\nwe looked at the different teams that\nwe might have in service operation.\n\n76\n00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.533\nBut what we didn't really discuss\nwas the concept that some of those\n\n77\n00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:34.864\nactivities might belong\nin the service desk.\n\n78\n00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:39.799\nRemember we looked at access management,\nand we looked at Active Directory, and\n\n79\n00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:41.168\ngiving rights, etc.\n\n80\n00:04:41.168 --> 00:04:43.019\nAnd I did mention during that section,\n\n81\n00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:45.440\nthat we might give some of\nthat to the service desk.\n\n82\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.040\nWe talked about change management, and\n\n83\n00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.460\nchange management's involvement\nin service operation.\n\n84\n00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.990\nWell we love the service\nthat's to raise request for\n\n85\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.260\nchanges, of course we do, because\na request could come in from a customer.\n\n86\n00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.370\nWe also allow the service\ntest to communicate,\n\n87\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.000\nremember there that spark,\nthat single point of communication.\n\n88\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.320\nWe allow the service desk to\ncommunicate the changed schedules and\n\n89\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.400\nthe availability schedules for\nthe coming week to our end users.\n\n90\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.340\nWe allow the service desk to update\nthe configuration management system,\n\n91\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.960\nthe configuration management databases.\n\n92\n00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.780\nSo the service desks are not just\ntied to incident request fulfillment.\n\n93\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.140\nThe service desk actually have input and\ninvolvement into every single process.\n\n94\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.020\nEven the strategy processes,\nsuch as service portfolio management and\n\n95\n00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.240\nbusiness relationship management,\nas well as financial management too.\n\n96\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.710\nThese strategy processes come up\nwith new ideas for new services.\n\n97\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.010\nWell those new ideas can come up from\nanywhere including service desk analysts.\n\n98\n00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.710\nAfter all the service desk works\nhand in hand with the users, so\n\n99\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.250\nwho better to understand\nhow the users work and\n\n100\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.540\nwhat they would appreciate in way of\na new service as the service desk.\n\n101\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.001\nSo when we think about measurements we\nalso wanna think about just because\n\n102\n00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:12.905\nsomething seems to be one way doesn't\nnecessarily mean that it is the right way.\n\n103\n00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:17.832\nAnd if you look at the movement in the\nmetrics might not be a result of what we\n\n104\n00:06:17.832 --> 00:06:18.398\nthink.\n\n105\n00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:20.734\nWell we call that logical fallacy.\n\n106\n00:06:20.734 --> 00:06:24.843\nAnd what logical fallacy means is that\njust because something appears to be one\n\n107\n00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:28.190\nway it does not necessarily\nmean that is the case.\n\n108\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.440\nThe example that I was giving early on and\nI think it is a great example to this,\n\n109\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.690\nis the fact that if we think\nabout two Incidents here.\n\n110\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.950\nOr we don't like to call them incidents,\nactually, to events that happen,\n\n111\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.100\nsomething that happens.\n\n112\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.520\nSo the cat walked across the road, and\n\n113\n00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.210\nthen five minutes later\nit started raining.\n\n114\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.680\nThere would be an assumption there, if we\nlooked at that metrics, that it started\n\n115\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.320\nraining because the cat crossed the road,\nwhen in fact, that's not the case.\n\n116\n00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.950\nThey were two completely separate events.\n\n117\n00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:03.130\nAnd so, we have to be very,\nvery careful about making assumptions\n\n118\n00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:09.490\nover the movements in our metrics, because\nif incidents decrease by 25% last month,\n\n119\n00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.380\nfor example, the assumption might be that\nthe service desk had better performance.\n\n120\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.660\nBut actually, what might have happened,\nit says there,\n\n121\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.690\n200 staff moved to a different company.\n\n122\n00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.440\nOr you might have found, that actually\nthe schools were all on summer break and\n\n123\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.830\neverybody's gone away on vacation or\nholiday, depending on what you call it.\n\n124\n00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.374\nAnd therefore, there's not as many\ncalled into the service desk.\n\n125\n00:07:32.374 --> 00:07:35.521\nSo yes,\nthe number of incidents have decreased.\n\n126\n00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:39.435\nAnd you might see an increase for instance\nin the number of incident resolutions at\n\n127\n00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:41.149\nthe front line on the service desk.\n\n128\n00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:44.726\nAnd you might assume that,\nthat is because well we've\n\n129\n00:07:44.726 --> 00:07:49.237\ngiven everybody additional training,\nbut that may not be the case,\n\n130\n00:07:49.237 --> 00:07:54.759\nwe might have actually brought some people\nin from second level support to help out,\n\n131\n00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:59.736\nbecause we were a little bit short staffed\nthat day So we can't always assume\n\n132\n00:07:59.736 --> 00:08:04.920\nthat because we see a decrease that\nsomething else has happened to cause that.\n\n133\n00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.190\nWe have to ensure that we investigate\nthe root cause of any trend\n\n134\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.298\nin service desk performance.\n\n135\n00:08:12.298 --> 00:08:14.430\nIdeally, we wanna provide value and\n\n136\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.270\ntherefore we want our incidents\nto decrease over time.\n\n137\n00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.490\nAnd we'd like our services\nto be more reliable.\n\n138\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.700\nWe'd also like incident\nresolution to increase as well.\n\n139\n00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.530\nBut be careful of watching those\ntrends and making assumptions.\n\n140\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.395\nSo we're gonna look at\nthe structures in the service desk.\n\n141\n00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:37.165\nI'd like to sort of engage in some\ndiscussion with you on what you\n\n142\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:41.955\nthink the pros and cons of each\nparticular structure type may be, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:45.233\nSo let me take a look first of all, then,\n\n144\n00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:48.452\nat what we call a local\nservice desk structure.\n\n145\n00:08:48.452 --> 00:08:52.652\nAnd we've got a graphic there to\nsort of help try and explain this.\n\n146\n00:08:52.652 --> 00:08:58.352\nAnd a local service desk is a service\ndesk that is local to the business unit.\n\n147\n00:08:58.352 --> 00:09:03.350\nAnd the example that we've got here\nis it's local to the geography\n\n148\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.680\nof that business unit.\n\n149\n00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.280\nWhat do you think the advantages are of\n\n150\n00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.250\nhaving a service desk that's\nlocal to the business unit?\n\n151\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.330\n&gt;&gt; Timeliness,\nI believe would be probably the most\n\n152\n00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.530\nobvious type of damage that we would have.\n\n153\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.527\nThe person or the help desk people being\nright there, easier to get a hold of, but\n\n154\n00:09:27.527 --> 00:09:29.840\nalso quicker to get a hold of.\n\n155\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could well be.\n\n156\n00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.580\nYes, there could definitely be some\ntiming issues there that you'd say,\n\n157\n00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.890\nwell actually, I can get hold of them\nquicker because they're right here,\n\n158\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.780\nand in fact I can physically get up and\nwalk to go and see them, yes.\n\n159\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.955\nBut there are other advantages to\nthis too, such as the local language.\n\n160\n00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:49.745\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The local culture.\n\n161\n00:09:49.745 --> 00:09:50.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n162\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.470\n&gt;&gt; The business culture.\n\n163\n00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:57.605\nUnderstanding exactly what\nthat business area does.\n\n164\n00:09:57.605 --> 00:10:00.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what about disadvantages known.\n\n165\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.080\nWhat do you think would be\na disadvantage of a local service desk?\n\n166\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.970\nCould you think of any?\n\n167\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.790\n&gt;&gt; I think the disadvantage\nis almost the same here.\n\n168\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.926\nThe very fact that they can get a hold\nof someone very quickly might also\n\n169\n00:10:12.926 --> 00:10:17.977\nbecome overwhelming to that help desk,\nand also the assumption that\n\n170\n00:10:17.977 --> 00:10:23.312\nthey can fix everything without having\nto go outside of that local desk.\n\n171\n00:10:23.312 --> 00:10:28.293\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nthere are quite a number of disadvantages\n\n172\n00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:31.110\nto having a local service desk.\n\n173\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.370\nThe one is that, well what about\navailability of the local service desk?\n\n174\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.690\nWhat happens if it's out of hours?\n\n175\n00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they may not be there.\n\n176\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.330\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah,\nthere'll be no one to support them if it's\n\n177\n00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.140\nout of their working hours.\n\n178\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.865\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And what about when they do get snowed\n\n179\n00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:54.160\nunder, when they get inundated with\npeople visiting them, then it's very,\n\n180\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.330\nvery difficult to control.\n\n181\n00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:01.050\nWe've also got the issue, though,\nthat we don't have any centralized\n\n182\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.800\ncontrol over that service desk, so\nthere's no consistency and standards.\n\n183\n00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n184\n00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.709\nwith local service desks what might be\nconsidered to be a priority one for\n\n185\n00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:14.070\none business unit, might not be\na priority one for another business unit.\n\n186\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.850\nAnd the way that we excavate\nmight be completely different.\n\n187\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.900\nSo we have problems with consistency and\nproblems with standards.\n\n188\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:27.450\nAnd therefore, it's difficult to manage\neach service desk in a consistent manner.\n\n189\n00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.400\nSo for the person that's in charge of\nthe entire service desk structure,\n\n190\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.590\nthat can be incredibly difficult for us.\n\n191\n00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.840\nSo what we might choose, and\nI'll talk about evolution in a moment,\n\n192\n00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.320\nwhat we might choose is\na centralized service desk.\n\n193\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.177\nAnd what you'll see, if we look at the\ngraphic at the top, is that we have three\n\n194\n00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:50.816\ndifferent customer sites, or\nthree different business units perhaps.\n\n195\n00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:55.020\nAnd they call come into\na centralized service desk.\n\n196\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.499\nSo let me ask you what you think the\nadvantages of centralized service desks\n\n197\n00:12:01.499 --> 00:12:02.430\nmight be.\n\n198\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.610\n&gt;&gt; Across those three sites,\nI believe that you would probably get\n\n199\n00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.570\na consistent answer among those\nthree sites as you call them for\n\n200\n00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.330\nsomething like,\nwhatever support issue it is.\n\n201\n00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.910\nThat it would not be different for each\nsite that you would end up calling in.\n\n202\n00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.000\nSo standardization, I think,\n\n203\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.760\nwould probably be one of\nthe advantages that you would get.\n\n204\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.970\nIt's not gonna be, well,\nso-and-so told me this over here.\n\n205\n00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.610\nOn this site,\nyou'll probably get a standardized answer\n\n206\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.070\nthat usually has worked across\neverything that they've tried.\n\n207\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.325\n&gt;&gt; And what about the disadvantages there?\n\n208\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:39.710\nThe disadvantage of the centralized\nsystem is, I think you might even get\n\n209\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:44.830\na single generic answer that may not work\nin any of those customized circumstances.\n\n210\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.470\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe've lost the business awareness then?\n\n211\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n212\n00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.930\nYou know what we did there?\n\n213\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.120\nWe took the pros and cons,\nthe advantages and the disadvantages,\n\n214\n00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.430\nand we simply flipped them around.\n\n215\n00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.050\nSo the differences between\na local service desk and\n\n216\n00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.100\na centralized service desk,\nwe've lost local language support,\n\n217\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.170\nwe've lost local cultural awareness,\nwhich could be a huge, big challenge,\n\n218\n00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:10.970\nespecially when communication is\nreally the key to us delivering value.\n\n219\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.450\nBut we've gained.\n\n220\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.990\nWe've gained that centralization.\n\n221\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.690\nWe've gained the standardized\nmethod of approach.\n\n222\n00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:23.110\nWe've gained standardized processes,\nand standardized prioritization, etc.\n\n223\n00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.850\nWe've also gained resilience, too.\n\n224\n00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.200\nBecause now we don't have to\nworry about local hours, etc.\n\n225\n00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.130\nWe've gained that resilience, so\nit makes sense in one respect.\n\n226\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.715\nBut then in another respect,\nit might not be relevant nor appropriate.\n\n227\n00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:46.015\nAnd so what we see here then\nis a virtual service desk.\n\n228\n00:13:46.015 --> 00:13:48.418\nAnd a virtual service\ndesk in this graphic,\n\n229\n00:13:48.418 --> 00:13:54.030\nyou'll see that we've got one data source,\nwhich is one service management tool.\n\n230\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.229\nBut we have a virtual service desk\nthat could be absolutely anywhere.\n\n231\n00:13:58.229 --> 00:14:02.992\nIt could be people working from home,\nanalysts working at home,\n\n232\n00:14:02.992 --> 00:14:07.430\nit could be analysts in a remote\ncore center, for instance.\n\n233\n00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.969\nAnd all of our locations,\nall of our customer sites,\n\n234\n00:14:10.969 --> 00:14:13.180\ncall into that one service desk.\n\n235\n00:14:14.356 --> 00:14:19.110\nNow, let's think about pros and\ncons for that particular environment.\n\n236\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:24.550\nYou see, what we've done here is we've\nexaggerated all of the disadvantages and\n\n237\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.680\nall of the advantages of\nthe centralized service desk.\n\n238\n00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.340\nSo now we've definitely\nhave got consistency.\n\n239\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.630\nWe have definitely got a standard\nway of approaching things.\n\n240\n00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.200\nBut, we've lost all business awareness.\n\n241\n00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.040\nWe've lost all cultural awareness.\n\n242\n00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.470\nWe've lost all language support.\n\n243\n00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.433\nAnd in fact, you could say that\nthe technical ability of the virtual\n\n244\n00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:48.493\nservice desk has been diluted somewhat.\n\n245\n00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:54.378\nBut what we do have is increased\nresilience in that virtual type\n\n246\n00:14:54.378 --> 00:14:55.720\nservice desk.\n\n247\n00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.790\nSo whilst the technical ability may have\nbeen diluted, the access to technical\n\n248\n00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.510\nskills, actually will have been increased\nbecause there are more people available.\n\n249\n00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:11.480\nSo you see, we have these different\nstructures of service desk.\n\n250\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.752\nAnd generally what will happen is,\nas an organization grows,\n\n251\n00:15:15.752 --> 00:15:20.507\nthey will evolve through the local\nservice desks, which are the local\n\n252\n00:15:20.507 --> 00:15:25.281\non-site support for each business\nunit to a centralized structure.\n\n253\n00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:28.323\nAnd then through to a virtual structure.\n\n254\n00:15:28.323 --> 00:15:33.596\nAnd then the large organization will\nimplement a follow-the-sun model.\n\n255\n00:15:33.596 --> 00:15:38.367\nAnd a follow-the-sun is a type\nof virtual service desk that is,\n\n256\n00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:42.112\nwell, simply exactly as it\nsays on the can really.\n\n257\n00:15:42.112 --> 00:15:48.433\nFollows the sun, wherever the daylight is,\nthen that's where the service desk is.\n\n258\n00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:55.120\nSo let's say, for instance then, we have\na global operation, a global organization.\n\n259\n00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.160\nThen as,\nit is daylight over in the far east,\n\n260\n00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.220\nthen the service desks may be located\nsomewhere in China or Asia or maybe India.\n\n261\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.090\nAnd as the end of the working day\napproaches there, and the start of\n\n262\n00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:15.260\nthe working day is in Europe then the\nservice desk may move locations to Poland,\n\n263\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.680\nor somewhere in say Eastern Europe,\nor maybe somewhere in North Africa.\n\n264\n00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.480\nSo somewhere on a very similar Time Zone.\n\n265\n00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.690\nAnd then as the working\nday concludes there,\n\n266\n00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.040\nthen we move the service desk\nover to our US time zone.\n\n267\n00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.045\nWe might have a service\ndesk that may be in say,\n\n268\n00:16:34.045 --> 00:16:36.970\nCanada or somewhere in South America.\n\n269\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.050\nArgentina is very popular for\nservice desks right now.\n\n270\n00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.903\nThen again, as the sun begins to set,\nand the working day starts in Asia,\n\n271\n00:16:45.903 --> 00:16:48.348\nthen the service desk moves, okay?\n\n272\n00:16:50.736 --> 00:16:53.360\nCan you think of any\ndisadvantages to that?\n\n273\n00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.130\nWhere do you recon the biggest\nsticking point is,\n\n274\n00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.630\nwith a follow the sun service desk?\n\n275\n00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:04.600\n&gt;&gt; I think once again, the laws in the\nlanguage and the culture is where I would\n\n276\n00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:09.190\nthink would be probably the most\nobvious disadvantage that I would see.\n\n277\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.980\n&gt;&gt; That is a disadvantage,\nit's something that some cultures find\n\n278\n00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.920\ndifficult to get used to, and especially\nif you're dealing with external customers,\n\n279\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.720\nwe have to be aware that some\nof our external customers\n\n280\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.170\ndon't understand accents-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n281\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.040\n&gt;&gt; As easily as some people do.\n\n282\n00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.918\nAnd so that is something that we have\nto be aware of when we design in\n\n283\n00:17:29.918 --> 00:17:31.250\na service desk.\n\n284\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.310\nThe biggest challenge to the virtual,\n\n285\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.590\nfollow the sun model is\nactually the handover.\n\n286\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n287\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:44.150\n&gt;&gt; The handover from one service desk to\nthe next we have to ensure consistency.\n\n288\n00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:50.000\nWe wanna operate to an efficient way,\nand that can be very difficult.\n\n289\n00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.520\nCan you imagine,\nyou call up the Service Desk and\n\n290\n00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.220\nit's literary five minutes before that\nService Desk is due to switch over\n\n291\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.150\nfrom let's say somewhere in\nIndia to somewhere in Europe.\n\n292\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.270\nFive minutes before and\n\n293\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:09.570\nyou've called Service Desk and\nyou have got a priority one incident.\n\n294\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.399\nSo something major has happened.\n\n295\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.245\nWhat would you say if the person that\nanswered the phone asked you to call back\n\n296\n00:18:16.245 --> 00:18:17.158\nin five minutes?\n\n297\n00:18:18.825 --> 00:18:23.990\n&gt;&gt; I'd probably be pretty upset if I had\na priority one type of incident there.\n\n298\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.493\nAnd I don't exactly know what I would\nsay except it probably wouldn't be nice.\n\n299\n00:18:28.493 --> 00:18:30.534\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I would say.\n\n300\n00:18:30.534 --> 00:18:32.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was thinking you were very,\n\n301\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.530\nvery calm there actually with\njust a little bit upset.\n\n302\n00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:38.570\nBut then let's think about\nefficiencies here, and\n\n303\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.290\nif you think about this from\nan efficiency perspective,\n\n304\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.370\nyou see that service desk analyst\nis gonna all of your details.\n\n305\n00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.820\nIt's gonna take them five\nminutes to do that, and\n\n306\n00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.820\nthen they're going to have to\npass that over to somebody else,\n\n307\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.510\nthey're going to explain it\nall again to that person.\n\n308\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.370\nAnd that second service desk analyst\nis probably gonna call you back and\n\n309\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.630\nask you for similar information again.\n\n310\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.140\nSo actually,\nwhat's happened is we've spent ten minutes\n\n311\n00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.270\nrather than just the initial five\nminutes if you'd been asked to wait for\n\n312\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.860\nfive minutes and call back in again, you\nwould have spoke directly to the person\n\n313\n00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.230\nthat's going to deal with your incident\nright the way through his life.\n\n314\n00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n315\n00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.390\n&gt;&gt; Now it sounds crazy doesn't it?\n\n316\n00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.090\nBut then we think about efficiency and\n\n317\n00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.120\nwe think well actually\nthat kind of makes sense.\n\n318\n00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.110\nBut I don't want to be the person\nthat turns around to you and\n\n319\n00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.180\nsays, can you call back in five minutes?\n\n320\n00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.100\nI know it's a priority one,\nbut, hey, look, I'm sorry.\n\n321\n00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.020\nSo we've got to think about this.\n\n322\n00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.800\nWe've got to think about this\nwith our common sense hat on and\n\n323\n00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.830\ndespite the fact that we want efficiency,\nwe have to think about how we can achieve\n\n324\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.666\nthat efficiency and\nstill keep the customers happy.\n\n325\n00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:49.960\nThe satisfaction rate and if we ask them\nto call back with a priority one incident,\n\n326\n00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.010\nwell it's not going to be very high is it?\n\n327\n00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.170\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n328\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.730\n&gt;&gt; So sometimes with this\nvirtual service desk then,\n\n329\n00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.920\nwe actually outsource that\nvirtual service desk.\n\n330\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:06.150\nWhat we've got to consider is,\nthat if we do outsource the service desk,\n\n331\n00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:12.245\nwe still own the contract with that\nparticular outsource provider.\n\n332\n00:20:12.245 --> 00:20:16.414\nAnd therefore, it's our responsibility\nto ensure that that provider\n\n333\n00:20:16.414 --> 00:20:19.355\ndelivers value to the organization.\n\n334\n00:20:19.355 --> 00:20:22.415\nIt's not their responsiblity, it's ours.\n\n335\n00:20:22.415 --> 00:20:27.335\nWe own that contract and we own\nthe work that the service desk does.\n\n336\n00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.660\nSo, that can be a challenging\ncontract to manage.\n\n337\n00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.610\nAlso think about how we are going to\nintegrate with that external service desk.\n\n338\n00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.790\nAre they going to perform second and\nthird level support as well?\n\n339\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.600\nOr are we going to maintain that in house?\n\n340\n00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.200\nHow do incidents get notified\nto this external service desk?\n\n341\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.900\nBecause our uses and\n\n342\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.910\nour customers shouldn't actually see that\nwe're using a different service desk.\n\n343\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:57.470\nThey shouldn't see that it's going\noutside of the organization.\n\n344\n00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.300\nSo how do we assure that integration?\n\n345\n00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.010\nThings like tools,\nhow do we pass our incidences to them,\n\n346\n00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.450\nto that particular organization and\nhow do we get updates back?\n\n347\n00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.650\nAnd again, what about communication?\n\n348\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.860\nWe want to ensure value\nis given to our users so\n\n349\n00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.560\nwe want to ensure that we communicate with\nthem on a regular basis about the progress\n\n350\n00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.090\nof incidents and requests.\n\n351\n00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.790\nSo, how do we ensure that that\nservice provider will do that?\n\n352\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.820\nSo think about not just how we\ncommunicate and what the vehicle is but\n\n353\n00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.858\nalso the language that\nwe use to communicate.\n\n354\n00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:35.826\nYou know, we'd like to think that\nwe speak the same language, right?\n\n355\n00:21:35.826 --> 00:21:36.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we like to.\n\n356\n00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.400\n&gt;&gt; We like to.\n\n357\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.290\nBut we don't.\n\n358\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.930\nIf I were to ask you,\nto go away and revise the document,\n\n359\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:50.220\nwhat would be your first thought what\nwould you do with that document?\n\n360\n00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.950\n&gt;&gt; I would retrieve the document and\ntry and\n\n361\n00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:59.640\nfigure out what needs revision after you\ntold me what we're actually revising for.\n\n362\n00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.750\n&gt;&gt; So your understanding there\nwas to change something?\n\n363\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n364\n00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.910\nThat's not what I meant.\n\n365\n00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:10.770\nYou see there are two dictionary\ndefinitions of the word revise.\n\n366\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.490\nOne is to look again or\n\n367\n00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:16.670\nto study, which is the one that\nwe in England use as a default.\n\n368\n00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.920\nAnd the other is to update and\n\n369\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.080\nto do something again, which is the one\nwe use in the states, as a default.\n\n370\n00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.690\nNow, I mention this as an example, and\n\n371\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:29.140\nit's an example I use\nin all of my classes.\n\n372\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:34.130\nSo everybody that's ever seen me face\nto face will know that I mention this\n\n373\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.230\nword all the time.\n\n374\n00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.470\nBecause it's really important.\n\n375\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.710\nIf I was communicating with you via email\nand I asked you to revise a document,\n\n376\n00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.110\nyou would go away and produce\nan updated version of that document.\n\n377\n00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.235\nWhen all I meant was for you to read it.\n\n378\n00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n379\n00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.460\nCommunication is really important.\n\n380\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.010\nAnd just because we think that we speak\nthe language, it doesn't mean that we do.\n\n381\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.300\nAnd sometimes that's overlooked.\n\n382\n00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.880\nWhen we look at outsourcing\nthe service desk.\n\n383\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:09.030\nWe think that because they are using\nthe English language that we are able\n\n384\n00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.210\nto communicate with them and that they're\nable to communicate with us effectively.\n\n385\n00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.480\nBut if we don't explain fully and\n\n386\n00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:22.110\nwe don't have processes in place to\nexplain the neurosis of the language,\n\n387\n00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.560\nthen customer perception is\nnot going to be very high.\n\n388\n00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.650\nAnd we're gonna have\na breakdown in procedures.\n\n389\n00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.730\nSo the last point that's mentioned\nhere is about ownership of data.\n\n390\n00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:37.300\nAnd that's a practical consideration\nthat should be fairly obvious, but\n\n391\n00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.710\nyou'll be amazed how often it's forgotten.\n\n392\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.748\nWho owns the data?\nYou've got customer information and\n\n393\n00:23:43.748 --> 00:23:45.188\nuser information.\n\n394\n00:23:45.188 --> 00:23:46.408\nWho owns that data?\n\n395\n00:23:46.408 --> 00:23:49.471\nIs that third party, that.\n\n396\n00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:51.948\nOff-shored service desk, as we call it.\n\n397\n00:23:51.948 --> 00:23:52.992\nIs it theirs?\n\n398\n00:23:52.992 --> 00:23:58.510\nAre they allowed to sell that data on\nto a marketing company, for instance?\n\n399\n00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.620\nWell it's our data isn't it?\n\n400\n00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.252\nSurely it's information about our users.\n\n401\n00:24:04.252 --> 00:24:09.353\nBut if that's the way that we feel and\nthat's what's in our processes and\n\n402\n00:24:09.353 --> 00:24:13.879\nin our policies, then we need to\nensure that it's documented and\n\n403\n00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:18.181\nthat our outsource service desk\nare able to comply with that.\n\n404\n00:24:18.181 --> 00:24:21.353\nDon't forget legal requirements, too.\n\n405\n00:24:21.353 --> 00:24:28.259\nThere is a mention right at the very top,\nin that top bullet point, for ISO 20,000.\n\n406\n00:24:28.259 --> 00:24:33.780\nISO/IEC 20,000 is the international\nstandard for service management.\n\n407\n00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.490\nWe will quite often, when outsourcing\na service desk, certainly look for\n\n408\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:45.380\na provider that has achieved\naccreditation in ISO 20,000.\n\n409\n00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.925\nBecause that tells us that they understand\n\n410\n00:24:49.925 --> 00:24:53.755\nall of the implications that have been\nmentioned on this particular slide,\n\n411\n00:24:53.755 --> 00:24:58.575\nincluding any legal issues, including\ndata ownership, including communication.\n\n412\n00:24:58.575 --> 00:25:02.809\nAnd it tells us that not only\ndo they understand incident and\n\n413\n00:25:02.809 --> 00:25:09.173\nproblem management, but actually that\nthey have passed an audit for ISO 20,000.\n\n414\n00:25:09.173 --> 00:25:14.298\nAnd that they are accredited, in other\nwords, that their processes are efficient,\n\n415\n00:25:14.298 --> 00:25:19.240\nand that they're effective, and\nthat they deliver the required outputs.\n\n416\n00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:25.140\nSo when it mentions about ISO/IEC\n20,000 is a critical factor.\n\n417\n00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:30.150\nIt's certainly a measurement that we\nwould use within the industry to tell us\n\n418\n00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:34.520\nwhether their working practices\nwould be compatible with ours.\n\n419\n00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.530\nSo at this point in time we've done\ntwo sessions on the service desk.\n\n420\n00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:46.450\nAnd so now is the time when I need\nyou to go to your course material.\n\n421\n00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.690\nAnd I need you to take a look at\nthe exercises that we have for\n\n422\n00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.830\nservice desk as a functional area.\n\n423\n00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.940\nNow those exercises also include\nthe operational activities\n\n424\n00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.600\nthat were in previous sections as well,\nthat we have covered.\n\n425\n00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.730\nIt should take you at least 1 hour and\n30 minutes,\n\n426\n00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:10.190\nat least 90 minutes to\nundertake those exercises.\n\n427\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:13.380\nAnd what I would mention, yet again,\n\n428\n00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:18.600\nis if you do have any questions then\nplease contact us via the forum.\n\n429\n00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.665\nPlease come back to us,\n\n430\n00:26:19.665 --> 00:26:23.300\nwe're more than happy to answer\nany questions that you have.\n\n431\n00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.630\nIf there's anything that is not quite\nclear to you, then please come back to us\n\n432\n00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.870\nand we'll be more than happy\nto explain it again to you.\n\n433\n00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.837\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well, thank you\nagain for helping us now to understand\n\n434\n00:26:34.837 --> 00:26:38.740\nthe differences as we continue to do\nmore in and learning about ITIL and\n\n435\n00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.744\nlearning about that service desk.\n\n436\n00:26:40.744 --> 00:26:45.568\nRemember the different aspects that we\ntook a look at today is really helpful and\n\n437\n00:26:45.568 --> 00:26:49.816\ntaking a look at the pros and cons of\neach of the types of service desk and\n\n438\n00:26:49.816 --> 00:26:53.240\nthings we must consider as\nwe continue forward in ITIL.\n\n439\n00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.424\nDo also the work assignment that\nJo said that you should do,\n\n440\n00:26:56.424 --> 00:26:58.150\nthat will also help you as well.\n\n441\n00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:03.428\nBut for this episode, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n442\n00:27:03.428 --> 00:27:04.663\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n443\n00:27:04.663 --> 00:27:09.543\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation shows.\n\n444\n00:27:09.543 -->

00:00:08.264\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.264 --> 00:00:12.271\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:15.480\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode,\nright here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.322\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.881\nI'm you're host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:25.570\nAnd today we're jumping into a new\narea on technical management.\n\n9\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.430\nAnd here to help us is going\nto be our superhero in ITIL,\n\n10\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.610\nWonder Woman herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.020\nJo, welcome back to these studios.\n\n12\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.584\n&gt;&gt; I quite like that, do I get\na nice sword and a cape with this?\n\n13\n00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:39.768\n&gt;&gt; Sure, why not?\n\n14\n00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:44.170\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, but\nthen I'm really pleased to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.440\n&gt;&gt; Alright, this sounds good.\n\n16\n00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.920\nNow Jo, We've already dealt\nwith a lot of different areas.\n\n17\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.250\nSo if there is technical management,\ntell me that there is not a untechnical\n\n18\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.255\nmanagement area that we\nare going to dive into as well.\n\n19\n00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:55.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n20\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.900\nthat's okay we are not going into\nthe untechnical management role, no.\n\n21\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.610\nThat's how I'm feeling today,\nI assure you right now.\n\n22\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.924\nNow what we're gonna do over\nthe next three sections, we actually\n\n23\n00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:10.962\nlooked at the previous two sessions at\nthe service desk being a functional area.\n\n24\n00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:14.077\nAnd over the next three Shorter sections,\n\n25\n00:01:14.077 --> 00:01:19.192\nwe're going to look at the other\nthree functional areas within ITIL.\n\n26\n00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:23.985\nNow, I know that I've mentioned in\nprevious sections that within ITIL,\n\n27\n00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:27.840\nwe cannot tell you how to\norganize your IT teams.\n\n28\n00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.820\nAnd we certainly looked at common\nservice operation activities.\n\n29\n00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.340\nAnd if we look at the technical\nmanagement role as it is laid out here,\n\n30\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.990\nwe talk about expertise and\nmanagement of the IT Infrastructure.\n\n31\n00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.740\nAnd it's all of the expertise and skills\nrequired to design, test, manage and\n\n32\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.700\nimprove these IT services, but\nin relation to the infrastructure.\n\n33\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.320\nSo it's everything to do with our network.\n\n34\n00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.340\nNow, this is not a team so\n\n35\n00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.050\nI'm not going to tell you that this\nis a team, an stand alone team.\n\n36\n00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.140\nWe refer to a function as being a group of\npeople and the tools that they use, but\n\n37\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.410\nthere is not rigid structure here.\n\n38\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.390\nI like to refer to this as well,\n\n39\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.588\nI like to refer to these functional\nareas as hats that we all wear.\n\n40\n00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:21.469\nAnd we've all got a different color hat.\n\n41\n00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.890\nAnd so for this one,\nI'm gonna give everybody a blue hat.\n\n42\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.310\nAnd every now and\nthen we wear our blue hat.\n\n43\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.884\nBecause every now and then,\n\n44\n00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:33.107\nwe might have something to do\nwith the IT Infrastructure.\n\n45\n00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:34.893\nSo the guys that manage the network,\n\n46\n00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:37.380\nthey're probably wearing\nin their blue hat a lot.\n\n47\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.309\nBut the guys that manage services and\ndo database administration and\n\n48\n00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.510\nmaybe middleware, maybe they wear\ntheir blue hats 50% of the time that\n\n49\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.580\nthey're actually performing their roles.\n\n50\n00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.870\nDon't think of these as rigid roles.\n\n51\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.290\nThink of these as activities and as,\n\n52\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.980\nwell I was gonna say activities,\nbut functions that we have to\n\n53\n00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.190\nperform in order to be able to\nleave a value to the organization.\n\n54\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.540\nSo, we think of this as a blue hat, okay?\n\n55\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.400\nSometimes, we need to\nbring in external people\n\n56\n00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.620\nto help us because we\nneed specialist's skills.\n\n57\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.330\nAnd so\nour functional areas are not just rigid.\n\n58\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.070\nThey are not just these people\nthat are within our organization.\n\n59\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.280\nThese are people that we could bring in,\nmaybe on an ad hoc basis.\n\n60\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.160\nOr maybe on a permanent basis,\nwhere we outsource some of these skills.\n\n61\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.040\nThe idea is that technical people\nare people that provide the experience and\n\n62\n00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.280\nthe skills to be able to support\nthe whole of the IT Infrastructure,\n\n63\n00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.610\nin whatever way you decide.\n\n64\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.425\nWhat we'll tell you is, that we're looking\nfor people that can design, and can build,\n\n65\n00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:58.639\nand can test, and can implement, and\ncan manage on a day to day basis.\n\n66\n00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.564\nAnd then improve, in other words,\nimprove our alignment to the business.\n\n67\n00:04:03.564 --> 00:04:05.800\nThe Technical Infrastructure.\n\n68\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.940\nIt's just that ongoing management of\nour technology of our infrastructure.\n\n69\n00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:15.190\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo as I just started\ntalking about that and\n\n70\n00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.365\nthe idea of the whole\ninfrastructure itself.\n\n71\n00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:20.610\nSo I don't know if this is proper or not.\n\n72\n00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.120\nBut are we now also saying that we're\nexcluding like specialty areas,\n\n73\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.690\nsuch as somebody that might be good and\ndesigning the email service,\n\n74\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.810\nor somebody bringing in some\nother special technical skills.\n\n75\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.281\nAre we including them in this as well?\n\n76\n00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:38.221\n&gt;&gt; No, we're including anybody\nthat we want to in this.\n\n77\n00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:40.205\n&gt;&gt; Okay, alright.\n\n78\n00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:42.775\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely anybody that we want to.\n\n79\n00:04:42.775 --> 00:04:47.745\nWe are really just giving\npeople a hat to wear.\n\n80\n00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:50.225\nIt's up to you who you put\nin what functional area.\n\n81\n00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:53.645\nIt's up to you what color\nhat you give people.\n\n82\n00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:54.700\nIt really is.\n\n83\n00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.450\nNobody's excluded from this.\n\n84\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.880\nThis is not a structure.\n\n85\n00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.510\nThis is not me saying okay,\nyou have to have a person in this team and\n\n86\n00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.990\nwe have to have this team called x.\n\n87\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.668\nThat's not what we're trying to do.\n\n88\n00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:14.750\nThe reason that we came across with\nthe concept of the functional areas, is\n\n89\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.573\nthat it's very, very difficult for us in\nITIL to look at every single organization.\n\n90\n00:05:20.573 --> 00:05:25.432\nAnd say from a generic perspective,\nbearing in mind that there are hundreds of\n\n91\n00:05:25.432 --> 00:05:29.850\nthousands of organizations that have\nadopted ITIL and adapted this for\n\n92\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.420\na framework to suit themselves.\n\n93\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.016\nIt's very difficult for us to say,\nthat one structure works in all\n\n94\n00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:41.873\nthe hundred thousand and\nmore organizations, because it doesn't.\n\n95\n00:05:41.873 --> 00:05:46.838\nSo there's no way that we could come up\nwith a generic structure for everybody.\n\n96\n00:05:46.838 --> 00:05:51.607\nSo what we have said in order to be\nable to address these people is we say,\n\n97\n00:05:51.607 --> 00:05:57.220\nwell people with these type of skills,\nwe're gonna call them this.\n\n98\n00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.770\nAnd people with different type of skills,\nwe're gonna call them that.\n\n99\n00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.001\nAnd it's something that we\nreference really for ease, for\n\n100\n00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:11.249\nwhen we're trying to explain functions and\nwhen we're trying to explain\n\n101\n00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:16.516\nwhat certain people do, and\nwhat activities belong in which processes.\n\n102\n00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:22.682\nBut really, it is just to try and\nget you or the reader,\n\n103\n00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:29.268\nthe watcher to understand that\nthese roles need to exist.\n\n104\n00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:33.260\nAnd it doesn't matter whether we\nuse outsourced contractors, or\n\n105\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.615\nwhether we use internal people.\n\n106\n00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:38.710\nWe have to have somebody\nsupporting our network.\n\n107\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.470\nSomebody has to build it, and\ntest it, and implement it.\n\n108\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.890\nWe have to have people that support\nour applications and our software.\n\n109\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.180\nAnd we have to have people that support\nthe day to day running of our jobs and\n\n110\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.610\nour job scheduling.\n\n111\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.100\nNow here we are in technical management,\nand\n\n112\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.590\nwe're looking primarily\nat the infrastructure.\n\n113\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.360\nIf you want to bring the server\nteams into the infrastructure,\n\n114\n00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.470\nthen we'll say hey that's great.\n\n115\n00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.191\nIf you want to take the server teams and\nput them in application management,\n\n116\n00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:07.054\nwe'll say okay that's fine,\nit's not a problem at all.\n\n117\n00:07:07.054 --> 00:07:11.593\nThe structure that you have within your\norganization is entirely up to you.\n\n118\n00:07:11.593 --> 00:07:13.867\nBut when we look at a structure,\n\n119\n00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:18.670\nwe will just look at the skills that\npeople have and we'll say okay,\n\n120\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.490\nthat's a technical person then or\nthat's an application person.\n\n121\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.730\nWe're not saying that you do\nsomething completely different,\n\n122\n00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.390\nwe're just saying that's\nthe category that we'd put them in.\n\n123\n00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.080\nSo we just give them a label.\n\n124\n00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.900\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n125\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.300\n&gt;&gt; So technical management is all\nabout the infrastructure, and\n\n126\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.310\nis about maintaining\na stable infrastructure.\n\n127\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:46.054\nSo we want to provide resilient,\nas we say cost-effective technology.\n\n128\n00:07:46.054 --> 00:07:48.653\nNow, we talk about cost-effective,\n\n129\n00:07:48.653 --> 00:07:53.224\nbecause cost-effective means not\nspending too much money [LAUGH] but\n\n130\n00:07:53.224 --> 00:07:57.811\nbeing efficient with our money,\nbut still having that resilience.\n\n131\n00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:02.546\nYou see if we don't put any resilience in\nplace, okay things will be cheaper, but\n\n132\n00:08:02.546 --> 00:08:06.950\nthen there are gonna be failures that\nare going to impact the organization.\n\n133\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.438\nBut if we put too much\nresilience in place,\n\n134\n00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:13.599\nthen it's going to cost us a lot more\nmoney and we may never ever need it.\n\n135\n00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:18.468\nSo we have to be able to do the risk\nassessment before we implement\n\n136\n00:08:18.468 --> 00:08:20.440\nany technology.\n\n137\n00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.490\nSo it's all about having the right\npeople with the right skills,\n\n138\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.520\nto be able to be able to\nmaintain that infrastructure.\n\n139\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.610\nSo they build it, they test it and they\nimplement it, and then they maintain it.\n\n140\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:36.620\nAnd it's all of the processes within ITIL\n,but in relation to the infrastructure.\n\n141\n00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.640\nSo as we've seen in that last bullet\npoint, we talk about technical failures,\n\n142\n00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.830\nwe talk about incident and\nproblem management.\n\n143\n00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.230\nThese guys are the people that\nare performing second and\n\n144\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.886\nthird level support,\nfor the infrastructure.\n\n145\n00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:52.550\nSo you'll see these are fairly\ngeneric skills, but\n\n146\n00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:57.560\njust relating to the infrastructure\nyou see managing, and\n\n147\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.600\ndocumentation, and training,\nand defining standards,\n\n148\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.840\nand research, and development, but\nin relation to the infrastructure.\n\n149\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.570\nSo these people are designing,\nthey're building,\n\n150\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.354\nthey're testing, they're modeling.\n\n151\n00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:19.065\nSo all of those things that we mentioned,\nthose activities that we talked about with\n\n152\n00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:23.085\ncapacity management and availability\nmanagement in previous sections,\n\n153\n00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:27.967\nthat's what these guys are doing but\nin relation to the infrastructure.\n\n154\n00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:33.117\nSo people that wear a blue hat,\nhave got involvement in projects and\n\n155\n00:09:33.117 --> 00:09:35.467\nin availability and\ncapacity as we've said.\n\n156\n00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:39.467\nAnd in testing, which is part of\nChange Management and part of release and\n\n157\n00:09:39.467 --> 00:09:40.770\ndeployment management.\n\n158\n00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.270\nThat perform in the risk analysis, for\nthings like security management and\n\n159\n00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.360\nservice continuity manage.\n\n160\n00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.920\nThey're actually doing vendor management,\nwhich is part of supplier management.\n\n161\n00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.860\nThey're dealing with incidents and\nproblems, etc, and there are data\n\n162\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:02.170\nin the database because they get that\ninformation from those suppliers.\n\n163\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.560\nSo they're performing\nall of those activities,\n\n164\n00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.110\nall of those processes from previous life\ncycle phases and from service operation,\n\n165\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.970\nbut they're doing that in\nrelation to the infrastructure.\n\n166\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.430\nNow, that's not to say that they just\nignore applications because as I\n\n167\n00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.870\nhave said, there's a very fuzzy\ngray line in between them.\n\n168\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.760\nAnd you can put people\nwherever you want to put them.\n\n169\n00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.080\nBut you'll see from these activities, that\nthere has to be a relationship between\n\n170\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.640\ntechnical people and application people.\n\n171\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.240\nAnd people that manage middleware for\ninstance, where do you want to put them?\n\n172\n00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.650\nWell we'll put them,\nwe'll give them that blue hat and\n\n173\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.590\nwe'll put them here with\nthe infrastructure.\n\n174\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.910\nBut you might put them\nwith the application guys.\n\n175\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.620\nAnd we might give them a green hat, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.650\nThat's entirely up to you.\n\n177\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.310\nIf I were to bring any of those\nbullet points out specifically,\n\n178\n00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.710\nI would bring the bullet point\nout about Financial Management.\n\n179\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.948\nBecause I've already mentioned\nin previous sections,\n\n180\n00:11:04.948 --> 00:11:07.730\n[LAUGH] we're not great with finances.\n\n181\n00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.711\nWell we've run away from finances,\nlet's face it.\n\n182\n00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:15.431\nAnd we have to I guess get a little bit\nmore mature in the way that we approach\n\n183\n00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:17.040\nfinancial management.\n\n184\n00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.448\nAnd I accept that things costs money and\nsupport cost money,\n\n185\n00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:25.780\nand we have to be able to account for\nthe money that we spent.\n\n186\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:31.465\nBecause that helps us achieve budget\nreaproval for new projects going forward.\n\n187\n00:11:31.465 --> 00:11:35.150\nSo in a nut shell,\nthat is technical management.\n\n188\n00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:40.720\nAnd what I'd like to do now,\nis to just take a moment to just review\n\n189\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.250\nthe notes that you have on technical\nmanagement in your course material.\n\n190\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.040\nAnd then in our next section, we're going\ngo to look at IT operations management.\n\n191\n00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.380\nAnd the section after that,\n\n192\n00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.090\nwe're going to take a look at\napplications management also.\n\n193\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.417\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Jo.\nWell thank you for\n\n194\n00:11:57.417 --> 00:12:00.920\nhelping us to understand more on\nthis idea of technical management.\n\n195\n00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.617\nThat's not necessarily a role as much as a\nhat that someone might wear to be able to\n\n196\n00:12:05.617 --> 00:12:10.264\nprovide assistance, or to actually take\nthat on to a particular point in time.\n\n197\n00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:14.202\nAlso the purpose of the technical manager\nas well as some of these different\n\n198\n00:12:14.202 --> 00:12:15.583\nactivities that we have.\n\n199\n00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:20.552\nAll these are good materials that you do\nneed to review as you continue on in your\n\n200\n00:12:20.552 --> 00:12:23.432\nITIL path, for\nwhat you actually need to do.\n\n201\n00:12:23.432 --> 00:12:26.512\nSo that's a great for us to also sign off,\n\n202\n00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:30.910\nsigning off from IT PRO.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n203\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n204\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.607\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation shows.\n\n205\n00:12:36.607 --> 00:12:42.600\n[MUSIC]\n\n206\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:49.459\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

Operation show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.160\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're jumping into operation management.\n\n7\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.750\nAnd here in studios is going to be\nthe ITIL mastermind herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.340\nJo, welcome back to studios.\n\n9\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.570\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Ronnie,\nhow are you?\n\n10\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.040\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, and\n\n11\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.180\nwe are starting to move through\nseveral topics relatively quickly now.\n\n12\n00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.630\n&gt;&gt; We've just talked about\nsome technical management and\n\n13\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.060\nnow we're moving into\noperations management.\n\n14\n00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.914\nWhat are we talking about here Jo?\n\n15\n00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:52.726\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're right that we're moving\nvery swiftly through these particular\n\n16\n00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:57.770\ntopics because in all honesty, we can't\nreally cover them in too much depth.\n\n17\n00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.960\nPurely because of the fact\nthat every single\n\n18\n00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.420\nstructure within an organization is\ngoing to be unique to that organization.\n\n19\n00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.170\nSo we can tell you what activities need to\nbe undertaken and we can tell you exactly\n\n20\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.100\nwhat processes need to be undertaken, but\nwe can't tell you who's going to do that.\n\n21\n00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.100\nAnd certainly technical abilities and\n\n22\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.140\ntechnical structure is going to depend\nentirely on what the organization needs.\n\n23\n00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo,\nwhen we start to take a look down,\n\n24\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.530\nsince we're ready inside\nof service operations.\n\n25\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.585\nWhat do we take a look at under\noperations management here?\n\n26\n00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:38.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, the naming of this is\nnot term is not particularly fortunate,\n\n27\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.742\nI don't think.\n\n28\n00:01:39.742 --> 00:01:43.163\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But in certainly in service operation,\n\n29\n00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:45.012\nin the life cycle phase-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n30\n00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:46.557\n&gt;&gt; We have this function,\n\n31\n00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:50.900\nand again, I introduced the concept\nof hats a littler earlier on.\n\n32\n00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.290\nThink of these guys as\nmaybe having a yellow hat.\n\n33\n00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.920\nAnd what we have are a group\nof people that perform\n\n34\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.810\nthe day to day operational activities.\n\n35\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.040\nNow we split this role into two.\n\n36\n00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.690\nOr we split this functional area into two.\n\n37\n00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.260\nBecause there are two very, very, clear\nsets of activities that need to happen.\n\n38\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260\nIn order to be able to just,\nkeep everything up and running.\n\n39\n00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.730\nAnd that's what we're doing.\n\n40\n00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.590\nSo we have operations control and\nthen we have facilities management.\n\n41\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.300\nNow operations control.\n\n42\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.460\nOperations control undertakes\nall of the activities that we\n\n43\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.390\nlooked at in previous sessions.\n\n44\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.990\nSo we looked at activities\nsuch as console management.\n\n45\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.234\nWe looked at job scheduling, and backups\nand restores, and print management,\n\n46\n00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:44.718\nand maintenance activities for\nthe hardware for our servers, etc.\n\n47\n00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:49.907\nThat's undertaken by the people\nthat perform operations control or\n\n48\n00:02:49.907 --> 00:02:52.560\nsit in the ops control arena.\n\n49\n00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.536\nNow you might give them the name\nof network operations center or\n\n50\n00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:58.118\nNOC or ops bridge, etc.\n\n51\n00:02:58.118 --> 00:03:00.774\nSo these are the people\nthat sit in ops control.\n\n52\n00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:03.322\nAnd the other sub function under\n\n53\n00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:07.910\noperations management is\nfacilities management.\n\n54\n00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.820\nAnd again, in a previous section we\nlooked at facilities management and\n\n55\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.400\nwe looked at the activities\nthat they perform.\n\n56\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.900\nSo they have responsibilities for\ndata centers, for\n\n57\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.120\ndisaster recovery sites, for\npower, and for air conditioning.\n\n58\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.140\nAnd so these guys,\n\n59\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.750\nthey're equally as important as\nanybody else within the whole of IT.\n\n60\n00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.755\nWe've already explained in previous\nsessions the fact that without power,\n\n61\n00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:37.758\nwithout me having this\nlead here on my laptop,\n\n62\n00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:40.467\nI'm not able to send or receive an email.\n\n63\n00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:44.791\nAnd if I can't send or\nreceive an email without power,\n\n64\n00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.150\nthen I don't have a service.\n\n65\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.600\nAnd so in IT, we're concerned with\ndelivering services and delivering value.\n\n66\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.416\nAnd if you take away one single component,\nI'm not able to facilitate those outcomes,\n\n67\n00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:02.413\nI'm not able to send and\nreceive that email.\n\n68\n00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:06.471\nSo I need to have the power,\nI need to have the air conditioner.\n\n69\n00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:08.154\nCan I ask you a question?\n\n70\n00:04:08.154 --> 00:04:13.052\nHave you ever sat in a room when the air\nconditions failed in the middle of summer?\n\n71\n00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:16.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not only have I sat in a room.\n\n72\n00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.935\nI have lived in rooms for that.\n\n73\n00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:20.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it is terrible.\n\n74\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not too good,\nit really isn't too good.\n\n75\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.030\nNow let me tell you, okay,\nI come from England, and so\n\n76\n00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.369\nwe have the opposite effect,\n[LAUGH] certainly during the winter,\n\n77\n00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:32.978\nbeing in a room where there's no heating.\n\n78\n00:04:32.978 --> 00:04:38.110\nAnd in fact, we even go so far as to have\nminimum operating temperatures for rooms,\n\n79\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.890\nwhich are legal requirements for the\ntemperature that buildings have to be in.\n\n80\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.830\nAnd our computer equipment is\nno different to you and I.\n\n81\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.150\nI don't want to be too cold and\nI don't want to be too hot.\n\n82\n00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.010\nAnd that's exactly the same\nwith our computer equipment.\n\n83\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.340\nSo of course, we have to maintain\nthat consistent temperature.\n\n84\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.370\nYou know, even your cellphone will tell\nyou if it's too hot or too cold and\n\n85\n00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.339\nit will shut down operations\nuntil you actually restore that.\n\n86\n00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.670\nSo IT equipment is quite sensitive.\n\n87\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Probably more than I am really,\n\n88\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.979\nI'm just a bit thick-skinned.\n\n89\n00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.430\n[LAUGH] So we need to have somebody\nthat's going to be able to manage\n\n90\n00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.740\nthe physical environment\nof our IT operations, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.370\nSo IT operation is about maintaining\nbalance, it's maintaining the status quo.\n\n92\n00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.050\nI like to refer to it as treading water\nbecause that's what we're doing, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.250\nWe have to tread water,\nwe have to make sure that everything is\n\n94\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.410\nticking over nicely,\nwe don't want interruptions to service.\n\n95\n00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.520\nSo we rely on service\ndesign to ensure that they\n\n96\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.470\ndefine operating parameters that will\nallow us to maintain that status quo.\n\n97\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.310\nAnd we rely on service\ntransition to build those\n\n98\n00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.030\nservices that will allow for\na stable environment.\n\n99\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.390\nAllows us to maintain the status quo.\n\n100\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.358\nNow, service or operations management,\nthey are people and\n\n101\n00:06:06.358 --> 00:06:09.190\nthey're performing various activities.\n\n102\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.220\nAnd they perform in\nactivities within design and\n\n103\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.625\nwithin service transition and\nwithin operation too.\n\n104\n00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:20.485\nSo the process is where we look at\nthe design characteristics, and\n\n105\n00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:22.435\nwe look at designing metrics.\n\n106\n00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:25.685\nAnd we look at building these services and\n\n107\n00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:28.735\nbuilding the monitoring\nsystems that we need.\n\n108\n00:06:28.735 --> 00:06:34.465\nWell, ops control are actually involved\nin that, that's exactly what they do.\n\n109\n00:06:34.465 --> 00:06:36.819\nFacilities management\nare involved in that, too.\n\n110\n00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.671\nJust think about the impact\nif we designed a new service,\n\n111\n00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:47.320\na new server that had to come\nin as part of that new service.\n\n112\n00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.290\nMaybe a complete rack of service were\nbrought in as part of that new service.\n\n113\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.700\nCan you just imagine what would happen if\nwe got to the implementation stage and\n\n114\n00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.240\nyour hardware supplier turned up,\ngenerally with a big truck,\n\n115\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.690\nfull of servers, etc., only to find\nthat there is insufficient power\n\n116\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.440\nin the computer room to\nbe able to deal with it.\n\n117\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.670\nOr maybe the air conditioning wasn't\npowerful enough to be able to deal with\n\n118\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.540\nthe additional heat.\n\n119\n00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.300\nOr maybe there wasn't even simply enough\nspace to be able to put that new rack in.\n\n120\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.080\nWell this is what happens if facilities\nmanagement [LAUGH] aren't involved.\n\n121\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.750\nWe have to get facilities\nmanagement involved.\n\n122\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.120\nSo all of this falls under\noperations management.\n\n123\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.890\nAnd it's not just about the day to\nday maintaining the status quo,\n\n124\n00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.880\nit's about planning for this as well.\n\n125\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.390\nWhich is why we're involved in design and\ntransition activities too.\n\n126\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.510\nBut then it talks about balance,\nand it talks about treading water,\n\n127\n00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.925\nmaintaining the status quo versus\nparticipating in added value.\n\n128\n00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:52.490\nOne of the sessions very, very early on,\n\n129\n00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.410\nwe looked at achieving balance within\nservice operation, and we mentioned\n\n130\n00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:02.200\nstability versus responsiveness and\nthat's exactly what this is.\n\n131\n00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.090\nYes, you've got to maintain stability.\n\n132\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.900\nYes, you've got to keep on treading water,\nkeep the business running.\n\n133\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.820\nThat's exactly what you've got to do, but\n\n134\n00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.930\nyou've also got to respond to\nthe changing business needs.\n\n135\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.750\nThe one thing that we know about\nthe business above everything\n\n136\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.820\nelse that we know about our organization,\nis that it's going to change.\n\n137\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.920\nNothing stays the same and\nespecially with the rapid\n\n138\n00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.850\npace of evolving technology now,\nnothing stays the same for very long.\n\n139\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.975\nSo we have to maintain that\nbalance between treading water and\n\n140\n00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:41.350\nkeeping everybody happy and\njust maintaining the status quo.\n\n141\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.300\nAnd being responsive to\nchanging business needs.\n\n142\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.890\nSo we have to understand then, what our\ntechnology does for the organization?\n\n143\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.120\nWhat impact does it have\non the organization?\n\n144\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.180\nAnd I'm not talking about what negative\nimpact does it have when it fails,\n\n145\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.650\nbecause that's a fairly\neasy one to ascertain.\n\n146\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.570\nThat's something that we\ndo in change management.\n\n147\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.210\nWhen we bring in a new change,\nwe, as part of change evaluation,\n\n148\n00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.700\nwe ascertain the negative impact of\nfailure of that particular service,\n\n149\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.860\nbut what about the positive\nimpact of that service?\n\n150\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.940\nWhat about what good that service does?\n\n151\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.400\nWe have to understand that there's always\ngoing to be an impact of any service and\n\n152\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.310\nwe have to make sure that the positive\nimpact outweighs the negative impact.\n\n153\n00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.292\nSo, all staff needs to understand this.\n\n154\n00:09:32.254 --> 00:09:36.518\nIf you don't feel involved,\nRonnie, in your particular role,\n\n155\n00:09:36.518 --> 00:09:38.843\nif people don't talk to you [LAUGH] or\n\n156\n00:09:38.843 --> 00:09:45.450\nif nobody explains to you why you're doing\nsomething, what's your motivation like?\n\n157\n00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.050\n&gt;&gt; It's probably not as high as it could\nbe if I knew why I was doing what I\n\n158\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.660\nwas doing.\n\n159\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.075\n&gt;&gt; You know, we keep going on about, or\nI keep going on about communications.\n\n160\n00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:53.820\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n161\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.370\n&gt;&gt; Communications is really,\nreally important when it comes to IT or\n\n162\n00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.960\nwhen it comes to service operation.\n\n163\n00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.235\nWhat we found, and of course we're\nfocusing on efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n164\n00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:09.445\nWhat we found though is that staff\nare obviously more effective and\n\n165\n00:10:09.445 --> 00:10:11.505\nmore efficient if we\ncommunicate with them.\n\n166\n00:10:11.505 --> 00:10:13.555\nIf they understand\nthe value of their role and\n\n167\n00:10:13.555 --> 00:10:18.205\nthey understand the value of their skills,\nthen actually they will give more to\n\n168\n00:10:18.205 --> 00:10:22.355\nthe organization because they\nsee the impact of their input.\n\n169\n00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.210\nSo, we like to ensure that\nall of our staff understand\n\n170\n00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.580\nthe impact of their input and the impact\nof their technical skills including\n\n171\n00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.910\nwhatever they do with their technology.\n\n172\n00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:40.025\nWe like to ensure that we keep all\nof our documentation up to date.\n\n173\n00:10:40.025 --> 00:10:41.865\nThat's part of Knowledge Management.\n\n174\n00:10:41.865 --> 00:10:46.305\nSo we will always encourage our\nstaff to facilitate that and\n\n175\n00:10:46.305 --> 00:10:49.767\nencourage our staff to\ncontribute their experience and\n\n176\n00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:53.757\ntheir knowledge and\ntheir skills to operational documentation.\n\n177\n00:10:55.097 --> 00:10:58.427\nBut we also have to remember\nthat we've gotta manage\n\n178\n00:10:58.427 --> 00:11:01.920\nwhether operations is actually working,\nokay?\n\n179\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.280\nWhich is where these metrics come in,\nwhich is where our strategy comes in,\n\n180\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.950\nwhich is where we talk about\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n181\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.710\nWe've gotta deliver value to the business.\n\n182\n00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.745\nAnd, well I think we're doing it.\n\n183\n00:11:15.745 --> 00:11:18.010\nIt's not really a good enough measurement.\n\n184\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.650\nIt's not just a case of sort of licking\nyour finger and holding it up and\n\n185\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.780\nsay, yeah, we're doing good.\n\n186\n00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.225\nNo, we can't just say that.\n\n187\n00:11:25.225 --> 00:11:29.450\nWe've gotta have some measurements\nto say whether we're achieving\n\n188\n00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.640\nthat value delivery or not.\n\n189\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.260\nWhether we're achieving that status quo.\n\n190\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.590\nAre we delivering that, or\nare we not delivering that?\n\n191\n00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.720\nAre we responding to changing needs, or\nare we not responding to changing needs?\n\n192\n00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.490\nEverything has to be focused on\ndelivering value to the organization.\n\n193\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.780\nBut because I think so,\n\n194\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:55.890\nis not a good enough reason to say\nthat we delivering that value.\n\n195\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.860\nBecause I think so, is just not a metric.\n\n196\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.840\nWe've gotta measure.\n\n197\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.880\nSo as we've already said then operations\nmanagement is about maintaining just\n\n198\n00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.510\nthe day to day stability,\nmaintaining that business as usual,\n\n199\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.330\nand ensuring that we\nare continually improving,\n\n200\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.160\ncontinually aligning ourselves\nto the needs of the business.\n\n201\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.700\nAnd so because we want to maintain\nstability, we've got to make sure if\n\n202\n00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:27.410\nsomething fails, that we're able to\npick up the pieces as soon as we can.\n\n203\n00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.370\nThat ties in with incident management,\nyeah,\n\n204\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.260\nwhere we've got to restore normal service\noperations as quickly as possible.\n\n205\n00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.830\nIt also has ties with\nproblem management too.\n\n206\n00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.150\nSo think about what other activities then,\noperations management have.\n\n207\n00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.195\nThey are doing event management for\ninstance.\n\n208\n00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:49.020\nThe event management is a process\nis where we monitored and\n\n209\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.590\nwhere we reacted to certain conditions and\nparameters\n\n210\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:57.090\nthat happened on our servers and on our\ninfrastructure, on our mainframe, etc.\n\n211\n00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.548\nWe're going to be liaising\nwith application management.\n\n212\n00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:05.120\nI mentioned during our last session\nabout that gray area that sits between\n\n213\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.000\nour technical teams, our network teams,\nand our applications team.\n\n214\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.120\nWhat about this middle ware?\n\n215\n00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.760\nWho does it belong to?\n\n216\n00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.440\nThere are gray areas there, we can't\ntell you how to be structured, but\n\n217\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.692\nwe can tell you that there needs\nto be relationships in place.\n\n218\n00:13:19.692 --> 00:13:24.220\nIf we've not talked to each other then we\nend up in that situation where an incident\n\n219\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:29.280\noccurs and it's passed around to 15\ndifferent people before somebody\n\n220\n00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.420\nfinally says, yes, that's actually my\nresponsibility, I can deal with this.\n\n221\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.880\nSo however we organize\nourselves within IT,\n\n222\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.550\nwe have to have very clear roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n223\n00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:46.075\nAnd above all, we have to ensure\nthat we have a stable environment\n\n224\n00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:49.214\nthat can deliver value\nto our organization.\n\n225\n00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.782\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, thank you again for\nhelping us out and\n\n226\n00:13:53.782 --> 00:13:57.684\nunderstanding more about this\nidea of operation management.\n\n227\n00:13:57.684 --> 00:14:01.565\nRemember that the key here of course\nis that for our business to function,\n\n228\n00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:05.775\nwe do have to maintain that idea of the\nstatus quo to ensure that things get done.\n\n229\n00:14:05.775 --> 00:14:09.139\nBut at the same time respond\nto the business needs and\n\n230\n00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:13.470\nwhat we also need there as\nbusiness continues to change too.\n\n231\n00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.160\nSo Jo also helped us to review the ideas\nsome these different activities\n\n232\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.720\nthat we will go through to be able\nto do well, both and maintain and\n\n233\n00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.930\ndo deliver, the great value that\nwe can to our costumers as well.\n\n234\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:29.450\nThat's a great place for\nus to sign off too, for itpro.tv.\n\n235\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.030\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock\n\n236\n00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.565\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right

00:00:12.106\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:15.329\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode,\nright here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.150\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.720\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're diving into application management.\n\n7\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.370\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be, well,\n\n8\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.240\nthe ITIL master blaster herself,\nJo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.490\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thanks very much for\nhaving me Ronnie, I'm pleased to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, Jo, we've already taken a look\nat a couple of different topics, and\n\n12\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.760\nI've mentioned this before,\nrelatively quickly.\n\n13\n00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.230\nWe are now moving into the realm\nof application management.\n\n14\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.694\nAnd I've said this in the plural,\nand you corrected me right away.\n\n15\n00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:51.710\nYou're going to have to explain why\nthat's actually so important, Jo.\n\n16\n00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.177\nSo Jo, what are we talking about here?\n\n17\n00:00:53.177 --> 00:00:55.215\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's important, really, for\n\n18\n00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:57.701\nthe case of its like with\neverything with ITIL.\n\n19\n00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:01.619\nIt's important for\nthe case of accreditation and\n\n20\n00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:06.467\nthis is an accredited class that\nanybody can take part in, and\n\n21\n00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:09.930\nthen go and sit an accredited examination.\n\n22\n00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.520\nSo, we wanna make sure that we\nget all of the terminology right,\n\n23\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.850\nexactly as it appears\nin publications because\n\n24\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.050\nthat could be the difference\nbetween some points in a test.\n\n25\n00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.684\nSo we wanna give everybody the opportunity\nto get everything right and\n\n26\n00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:30.601\nto get the right answers\nin the test as well.\n\n27\n00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:31.618\n&gt;&gt; All right Joe so\n\n28\n00:01:31.618 --> 00:01:36.870\nwhen it comes down to the idea\nthen of an application management.\n\n29\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.720\nWe one, of course, make sure that we\ncover everything that we need to.\n\n30\n00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.947\nWhere is the point that we need to begin?\n\n31\n00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:44.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well application management.\n\n32\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.910\nIt's another functional area.\n\n33\n00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.300\nSo it's another group of people\nthat we have within ITIL.\n\n34\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.810\nThat we can not tell you how\nto structure your team, so\n\n35\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.240\nwe can't tell you that you're\ngoing to have SAP support and\n\n36\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.500\nyou're going to have\nMicrosoft Office support etc.\n\n37\n00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.740\nBecause we really don't know what\nyou've got in your organization.\n\n38\n00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.482\nSo what we do is we'll tell you that\npeople that support application.\n\n39\n00:02:10.482 --> 00:02:13.061\nNo matter what those applications are and\n\n40\n00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:17.040\npeople that manage applications\nthroughout their life cycle,\n\n41\n00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.710\nwell they are what we consider to\nbe application management people.\n\n42\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.429\nSo we give in these guys I think\nwe gave them a green hand didn't\n\n43\n00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:26.939\nwe in previous section.\n\n44\n00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did.\n\n45\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.035\nSo, our technical management guys\nwell we gave them a blue hat and\n\n46\n00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:35.268\nwe said if you are doing anything\nif you are working on service,\n\n47\n00:02:35.268 --> 00:02:39.530\nif you're working on the infrastructure,\nthen you are wearing a blue hat.\n\n48\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.701\nBut, then later on that day, you might be\ndoing so work with some applications for\n\n49\n00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:47.450\ninstance doing some software support or\nsoftware development.\n\n50\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.710\nSo you'll be wearing a green hat.\n\n51\n00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.350\nAnd so, these people got to perform\ninto project management and\n\n52\n00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.670\nare doing the design and development\nof applications and of services\n\n53\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.540\nin their entirety are going to be wearing\ntwo hats, potentially at the same time.\n\n54\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.810\nBecause if you're designing a service,\nyou're designing the entire\n\n55\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.270\nservice includes in all of the components\nthat that service requires, so\n\n56\n00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.680\ntherefore you're going to\nbe doing some server work.\n\n57\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.530\nYou're going to be doing\nsome infrastructure work.\n\n58\n00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.660\nYou're going to be doing\nsome application work.\n\n59\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.761\nThe first thing that I want to draw\nyour attention to Is, if you notice,\n\n60\n00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:32.096\nthe technical knowledge and expertise\nrelating to managing applications, that's\n\n61\n00:03:32.096 --> 00:03:37.375\npretty much exactly the same wording as we\nhad in our technical management section.\n\n62\n00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:42.283\nThe only difference being is that we're\nrelating this to managing applications,\n\n63\n00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:44.620\nand not managing the infrastructure.\n\n64\n00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.200\nBut as I said,\nit's all about the hat that we wear.\n\n65\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.720\nAnd so this particular group of people,\nhowever you want to organize them,\n\n66\n00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.070\nare gonna provide all of the resources\nto manage all of the life of a service.\n\n67\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.067\nThat means the design, the development,\nthe bills, the test, the implementation,\n\n68\n00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:11.593\nand the ongoing support, and then the\nongoing continual improvements as well.\n\n69\n00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:16.701\nSo these people support the whole of\nthe service management life cycle,\n\n70\n00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:21.473\nthe whole of itel as we might call\nit including providing guidance to\n\n71\n00:04:21.473 --> 00:04:24.506\noperations on things like when to back up.\n\n72\n00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:26.410\nWhat types of backups are needed?\n\n73\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.950\nDo we need incremental backups or\ndo we need full backups?\n\n74\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.260\nThese people provide all the training for\nthe applications as well.\n\n75\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.791\nNow before we move on\nany further I just want\n\n76\n00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:42.863\nto draw your attention to\na differentiation here.\n\n77\n00:04:42.863 --> 00:04:47.316\nBecause there is a subset of\napplication management that we call\n\n78\n00:04:47.316 --> 00:04:49.300\napplication development.\n\n79\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.800\nNow when we first start a project and\n\n80\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.369\nwe come up in service strategy\nwith the idea for a new service.\n\n81\n00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.680\nAnd with that idea,\nwe go off into financial management,\n\n82\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.140\nand with business relationship management,\nand we create a business case, and\n\n83\n00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.500\nwe give that business case to our group.\n\n84\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.249\nAnd our steering group, based on\nthe details within the business case,\n\n85\n00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:16.446\nand the desire within the organization\nwill either approve or\n\n86\n00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:17.936\nreject that business case.\n\n87\n00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:21.330\nSo let's say that they\napprove a business case.\n\n88\n00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.830\nWell, the first thing that's\ngoing to happen then,\n\n89\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.150\nis a project manager is\ngoing to be assigned.\n\n90\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.390\nBecause the service has\nnow been chartered.\n\n91\n00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.260\nIn other words, it's been approved and\nit's been given a delivery date.\n\n92\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.050\nAlthough that point in time is estimated.\n\n93\n00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.230\nSo the first thing that happens\nis that the project manager\n\n94\n00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.370\nwill bring in some\napplication management people\n\n95\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.630\nto then design the application\nportion of that service.\n\n96\n00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.240\nHe's gonna bring in some people with\nsome technical management skills too.\n\n97\n00:05:50.245 --> 00:05:54.055\nSo he'll have people around him that are\nwearing both colored hats, maybe both at\n\n98\n00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:57.725\nthe same time, you never know, and\nthey're going to design a service.\n\n99\n00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:01.035\nOnce they've designed that service, or\n\n100\n00:06:01.035 --> 00:06:04.690\nmaybe as part of the design,\ncuz maybe they already know it.\n\n101\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.150\nThere's going to be a decision\nmade as to whether we build or\n\n102\n00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.326\ndevelop an application in-house or\nwhether we go out and\n\n103\n00:06:13.326 --> 00:06:18.240\nwe buy what we call a COTS product,\na Commercial Off The Shelf Product.\n\n104\n00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.430\nAnd so we have a subset to application\nmanagement called application development.\n\n105\n00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.818\nAn application development\nare the group of people\n\n106\n00:06:30.818 --> 00:06:33.986\nwho actually develop new software.\n\n107\n00:06:33.986 --> 00:06:39.014\nBut let's say for instance that we're\nin service design at the moment and\n\n108\n00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:44.042\nwe're designing this new service and\nthe service is to deliver financial\n\n109\n00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:49.580\naccounting for instance including payroll\nand including sales and marketing.\n\n110\n00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.536\nWould it be wise, do you think,\nRonnie, to build something in a house,\n\n111\n00:06:54.536 --> 00:06:58.860\nor do you think you're more likely to go\noutside of the organization to somebody\n\n112\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.622\nwho has already got the skills?\n\n113\n00:07:00.622 --> 00:07:04.296\n&gt;&gt; I think it would probably be better\nto go outside instead of me trying\n\n114\n00:07:04.296 --> 00:07:06.200\nto reinvent the wheel.\n\n115\n00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n116\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.490\nAnd you know what?\n\n117\n00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.890\nI love the way you use that word, because,\nand no it wasn't prompted, honest.\n\n118\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.116\nI love the way you use that, because\nthat's exactly how a lot of organization\n\n119\n00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:21.547\nsee this right now, is the fact that\nthere's no point in reinventing the wheel.\n\n120\n00:07:21.547 --> 00:07:24.474\nIf there's already a product out there, or\n\n121\n00:07:24.474 --> 00:07:30.025\nthere is already a product that meets\nwhat we call 80% of the requirements.\n\n122\n00:07:30.025 --> 00:07:35.745\nThen, in that case, really,\nthere's no point in doing it in house.\n\n123\n00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:39.000\nSo application development\nis not utilized.\n\n124\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.747\nAnd what we do is we manage,\nwe leave it within the realms of\n\n125\n00:07:42.747 --> 00:07:47.411\napplication management and we manage\nthe purchase of that product, and\n\n126\n00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:50.020\nthen the subsequent, how do I put this?\n\n127\n00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.925\nCustomization, I guess,\nof that product through to Development,\n\n128\n00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:58.400\nimplementation and\nthen into the live service.\n\n129\n00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.552\nSo we utilize a small framework,\na small technique, called MoSCoW or\n\n130\n00:08:03.552 --> 00:08:09.156\nI think we say it slightly differently\nhere is it MOSCOW is that how we say it.\n\n131\n00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:13.276\nYeah, okay [LAUGH] I what it stands for\nreally,\n\n132\n00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:19.088\nwhen it comes to application purchasing,\nwe have the must have,\n\n133\n00:08:19.088 --> 00:08:24.265\nshould have, could have and\neither wanna have right now,\n\n134\n00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:28.620\nor would like at some point\nin time in the future.\n\n135\n00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:34.604\nAnd the general rule that project teams\nwill employ here is that really a service,\n\n136\n00:08:34.604 --> 00:08:41.023\na new application, will need to meet about\n80% of the must have functionality within\n\n137\n00:08:41.023 --> 00:08:47.480\nthat list that we have of must haves and\nshould haves and could haves, etc.\n\n138\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.680\nSo, it's that, that will help us make\nthat decision as to whether we design and\n\n139\n00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.680\nbuild it in-house using application\ndevelopment or whether we go outside and\n\n140\n00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.210\nwe purchase something off the shelf.\n\n141\n00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.664\nBecause if somebody's already done it,\n\n142\n00:09:01.664 --> 00:09:04.990\nthere is absolutely no point\nin reinventing the wheel.\n\n143\n00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.550\nIt's very costly to do that and\n\n144\n00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.830\nif we have the right skills\nin-house to do that, that's great.\n\n145\n00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.999\nBut, what happens if those skills are no\nlonger there for whatever reason.\n\n146\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.701\nSo we find that buying applications\noff the shelf can quite often be\n\n147\n00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:25.688\nthe most cost-effective way of\nimplementing any new service.\n\n148\n00:09:25.688 --> 00:09:30.393\nSo application development is optional,\nwherever it's required,\n\n149\n00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:35.339\nit forms part of the application\nmanagement and application development\n\n150\n00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:40.160\nteam will quite often then go\non to support any application.\n\n151\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.330\nBut let's say for instance,\nwe're just going to assume that for\n\n152\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.910\nthis new service that we talking about,\nwe're going to buy it off the shelf.\n\n153\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.660\nSo it's going to need some\ncustomization once we've bought it.\n\n154\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.975\nBut we're gonna leave it within\nthe realms of application management.\n\n155\n00:09:54.975 --> 00:09:57.561\nAnd application management as a whole,\n\n156\n00:09:57.561 --> 00:10:01.143\ntheir role is to support all\nof the business processes.\n\n157\n00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:03.825\nSo right at the very start of any project,\n\n158\n00:10:03.825 --> 00:10:09.070\nwe are identifying functional\nrequirements for an application.\n\n159\n00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.750\nAnd then we're assisting with the design,\nnotice not the development.\n\n160\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.970\nWe're assisting with the design and\nthe deployment and\n\n161\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.490\nthe support and\nimprovement of those applications.\n\n162\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.270\nNow what it doesn't mention there and\nwhat we need to add into this,\n\n163\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:30.180\nis that it also assists with\nthe evaluation of the various products,\n\n164\n00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.690\nbecause we do have a process that will\nallow us to evaluate those products.\n\n165\n00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.759\nAnd we start off with MoSCoW,\nbut then we still have to,\n\n166\n00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:43.782\nonce we've evaluated the products\nthat meet that 80% criteria,\n\n167\n00:10:43.782 --> 00:10:48.458\nthen we want to compare against\nall of the products that meet that\n\n168\n00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:51.922\n80% criteria and\ncome up with a shortlist and\n\n169\n00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:55.943\nevaluate based on various\nfactors such as cost, etc.\n\n170\n00:10:55.943 --> 00:11:00.323\nYou see we need our applications because\nthey're a component of our service service\n\n171\n00:11:00.323 --> 00:11:03.460\ntoo and while there is the network and\nhardware, etc.\n\n172\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.300\nWe need our applications to be resilient.\n\n173\n00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.908\nWe need them to be well-designed and\nto be cost effective.\n\n174\n00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:13.760\nIn ITEL, and in our introduction section,\n\n175\n00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.270\nwe looked at the ability of\na service to facilitate an outcome.\n\n176\n00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.470\nWe looked at two aspects of the service,\nwhich were utility and warranty.\n\n177\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:29.120\nUtility is really the ability of\na service to do what it's supposed to do.\n\n178\n00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.715\nSo for instance, if we wanted\nit to send and receive e-mails.\n\n179\n00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:40.420\nWell the warranty aspects of the service\nlook at the warranty factors such as\n\n180\n00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:46.280\navailability, such as capacity,\ncontinuity, and security.\n\n181\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:52.542\nSo warranty looks at\nthe usability of a service, okay?\n\n182\n00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:56.776\nSo if you think about utility\nas being fit for purpose,\n\n183\n00:11:56.776 --> 00:12:00.210\ndoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n184\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.360\nDoes it send and receive e-mail?\n\n185\n00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.760\nAnd then warranty is about it being\nfit for use, but can I use it?\n\n186\n00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.950\nSo let me give you a real\nlife example in this one.\n\n187\n00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.280\nBecause sometimes it can be a little\nbit difficult to get your head around.\n\n188\n00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.200\nAnd I acknowledge that.\n\n189\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.430\nSo if we wanted to source\nan e-mail solution.\n\n190\n00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.450\nSo this what we're doing\nas part of our project,\n\n191\n00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.460\nwe want to source an email solution.\n\n192\n00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.050\nWe've ascertained that we're not going to\nuse application development because there\n\n193\n00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.970\nare so\nmany different e-mail products out there.\n\n194\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.393\nSo what we might do then is, we might\nevaluate something like an online product,\n\n195\n00:12:33.393 --> 00:12:37.730\nsomething that provides us\nwith free access to e-mail.\n\n196\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.620\nThat's great, right?\n\n197\n00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.050\nIt's free, so\nof course we want to go with that.\n\n198\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.020\nDon't we?\n\n199\n00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:48.012\nDo we really want to go with a free\nonline e-mail in a business environment?\n\n200\n00:12:48.012 --> 00:12:49.510\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n201\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.774\n&gt;&gt; Well,\none you don't have any support for it.\n\n202\n00:12:52.774 --> 00:12:53.726\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n203\n00:12:53.726 --> 00:12:57.450\n&gt;&gt; If you have a particular business\nfunction that you're saying, hey,\n\n204\n00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.305\nthis is not something that\nthey're going to support,\n\n205\n00:13:00.305 --> 00:13:03.260\nif it's something specific\nto your business.\n\n206\n00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.780\nTwo, you don't know who else\ncan have access to that and\n\n207\n00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.550\nthat means they may also gain\nunauthorized access to your material.\n\n208\n00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.000\n&gt;&gt; So you're looking at security here.\n\n209\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.560\n&gt;&gt; Security.\n\n210\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.737\n&gt;&gt; You're looking at supportability,\nyou're looking at availability, and\n\n211\n00:13:16.737 --> 00:13:17.708\ncapacity, etc.\n\n212\n00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:20.901\nWhat you're looking at is\nthe warranty aspects so\n\n213\n00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:24.940\nyou see that online e-mail\nservice provides us with utility.\n\n214\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n215\n00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\nIt does exactly what is supposed to do\n\n216\n00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.130\nwith, it does what it says on the can and\nthat's great.\n\n217\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.000\nBut it still doesn't mean\nwhat we value that service.\n\n218\n00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.927\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n219\n00:13:34.927 --> 00:13:39.447\n&gt;&gt; Because what you've outlined to me is\nthat we value the warranty aspects of that\n\n220\n00:13:39.447 --> 00:13:40.630\nservice, too.\n\n221\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.060\nWe value security.\n\n222\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.010\nYeah, we do.\n\n223\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:48.710\nAnd we value continuity as well and we\nvalue availability and capacity as well.\n\n224\n00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.170\nSo, we need both elements to exist,\nin order for\n\n225\n00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.710\nus to perceive value, in order for\nthe business to perceive value.\n\n226\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.540\nSo we probably wouldn't go with\nthe free online e-mail service,\n\n227\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:05.110\nbecause even though it's free, and\nprovides with cost-effectiveness,\n\n228\n00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:11.790\nit's not actually meeting our real needs,\nwhich is for security, etc.\n\n229\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.610\nSo we would go with something that was\ncommercially off-the-shelf available\n\n230\n00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.440\nperhaps, but something that allowed\nus to configure in-house and\n\n231\n00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.315\nallowed us to determine\nthe levels of availability, etc.\n\n232\n00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:28.710\nDependent on our own infrastructure and\nour own network.\n\n233\n00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.660\nSo we're utilizing both\napplication management and\n\n234\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.450\ntechnical management in that\ndecision as to what product to buy.\n\n235\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.510\nYou see, we talk about\napplications being easily and\n\n236\n00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.840\nwell designed and cost effective but\nit's not just about cost effectiveness.\n\n237\n00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.900\nIt's also about our ability to support,\nand\n\n238\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.800\nour ability to ensure that we meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n239\n00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.160\nSo it's not just about\nensuring functionality,\n\n240\n00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.700\nit's about ensuring all of\nthe warranty aspects, too.\n\n241\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:03.055\nSo here in application management then,\nwe maintain the skills that allow us not\n\n242\n00:15:03.055 --> 00:15:06.485\njust to design and develop and\n\n243\n00:15:06.485 --> 00:15:11.505\nimplement those services or customize\nrather than develop those services, but\n\n244\n00:15:11.505 --> 00:15:14.685\nalso that allow us to\nsupport those services too.\n\n245\n00:15:14.685 --> 00:15:19.419\nHence that last bullet point about\nresolving application related issues.\n\n246\n00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:24.270\nSo you'll see that the next slide\nreally just reinforces that.\n\n247\n00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:28.560\nWe're talking about the expertise\nneeded to manage these applications\n\n248\n00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.800\nthroughout their lifecycle.\n\n249\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.520\nFrom the inception,\n\n250\n00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.850\nright the way through continual service\nimprovement, and then retirement as well.\n\n251\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.716\nSo here in application management,\n\n252\n00:15:39.716 --> 00:15:43.096\nwe're actually performing all of\nthe training for our end users.\n\n253\n00:15:43.096 --> 00:15:46.959\nAnd we're performing\non-going support as well for\n\n254\n00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:52.577\nthose applications and for those\nservices Now in application management,\n\n255\n00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:57.668\nwe will take the new approved business\ncases back in service design,\n\n256\n00:15:57.668 --> 00:16:01.970\nand we will evaluate what\nproducts there are available off\n\n257\n00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.860\nthe shelf in order to meet\nthe needs of the business.\n\n258\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.180\nSo that includes research and development.\n\n259\n00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.990\nIt includes liaising with suppliers.\n\n260\n00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.920\nAnd it includes negotiating contracts\nwith suppliers that can meet or\n\n261\n00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.400\nexceed the needs of the business.\n\n262\n00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.372\nSo when we say involvement in all\nprojects, we're talking about involvement\n\n263\n00:16:22.372 --> 00:16:25.501\nin projects, we're talking\nabout involvement in support,\n\n264\n00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:28.210\ninvolvement in continual\nservice improvement, and\n\n265\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.830\nwe're talking about involvement\nin the decision making too.\n\n266\n00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.660\nThings like availability and\ncapacity management.\n\n267\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.740\nIn planning for requirements, for\nour technical management guys.\n\n268\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.680\nYou see and it's the same people,\nthey're just wearing two different hats.\n\n269\n00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.450\nThey're going to do testing,\nthey're going to do training, and\n\n270\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.230\nthere's of course that difference between\ncustomer testing and user testing as well,\n\n271\n00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.290\nand these guys are going\nto be involved in that.\n\n272\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.810\nThey're also going to be involved\nin sourcing a product, so\n\n273\n00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.451\ntherefore they're gonna be\ninvolved in supplier management.\n\n274\n00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:06.225\nOkay, they're going to be dealing\nwith incidents and with problems, and\n\n275\n00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:11.377\nalso with new changes too because you know\nour customers, they like to come along\n\n276\n00:17:11.377 --> 00:17:16.105\nwith new ideas for bits of functionality\nthat they can add into a service.\n\n277\n00:17:16.105 --> 00:17:20.137\nAnd so they're going to be evaluating\nthose new ideas as well so they can help\n\n278\n00:17:20.137 --> 00:17:25.470\nchange management with that, and they're\ngonna help with the actual deployment.\n\n279\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.060\nAnd I also like the bit which is the third\nbullet point from the bottom there about\n\n280\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.630\nsupporting the known error database.\n\n281\n00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:39.240\nWhen we looked at problem management,\nwe looked at the fact that sometimes, and\n\n282\n00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.920\nI dare mention the fact that sometimes our\nservices come to us with known errors.\n\n283\n00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.670\nSometimes they might call\nthem a list of features but\n\n284\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.260\nsometimes they're known errors and\nwe say, hey, where do we put them?\n\n285\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.380\nWell, we put them in our\nknown error database.\n\n286\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.100\nBut application management's role\nis to ensure that we validate\n\n287\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.969\nthose known errors.\n\n288\n00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:05.070\nSo we make sure that whatever we're doing\nwhen we're bringing in new services,\n\n289\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.890\nthat they are updated in our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n290\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.410\nAnd that we are continually aligned\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n291\n00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:19.220\nAnd that all project documentation and all\nsupport documentation and even the service\n\n292\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:24.900\ncatalog is up to date with\nthe details of that application.\n\n293\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.330\nAnd that we have the right\nservice level targets\n\n294\n00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.050\nin our service level agreements too.\n\n295\n00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.030\nNow, I like the fact that we refer\nto financial management as well.\n\n296\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:41.170\nAnd I've liked that in all of\nour previous sections too.\n\n297\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:45.248\nBecause, as I've said before,\nprobably ad nauseam,\n\n298\n00:18:45.248 --> 00:18:50.300\nthat quite simply, we need to be\ninvolved in financial management.\n\n299\n00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.460\nWe're in IT, and we don't like to be\ninvolved in financial management.\n\n300\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.570\nBut we need to be involved\nin financial management.\n\n301\n00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.258\nAnd we also need to be involved in\ndecision making and in policy definition\n\n302\n00:19:01.258 --> 00:19:06.120\ntoo, though sometimes in IT documentation\ndoesn't come easily to us either.\n\n303\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.670\nIt's not something that we like to do.\n\n304\n00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.300\nBut nevertheless, we understand\nthe need for that consistency and\n\n305\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.300\nwe understand the need for\nthat governance.\n\n306\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:19.130\nSo that's something here that, yes, is\nvery important in application management,\n\n307\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.035\nbecause these are the software\nsupport procedures that people like\n\n308\n00:19:24.035 --> 00:19:29.060\nthe service desk and second and third\nlevel support teams are going to be using.\n\n309\n00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:33.639\nSo these user manuals and\nthese standard operating procedures, well,\n\n310\n00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:37.090\nnot only have they got to be\ndefined in the first place,\n\n311\n00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.336\nthey've actually got to be\nkept up to date as well.\n\n312\n00:19:40.336 --> 00:19:43.765\nSo what we really took a look\nat over the last three sections,\n\n313\n00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:45.850\nwe looked at technical management,\n\n314\n00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.290\nwhich is the functional area that\ndeals with our own infrastructure.\n\n315\n00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:55.549\nWe looked at operations management, which\nis the functional area that deals with\n\n316\n00:19:55.549 --> 00:20:00.805\nthe business as usual, where we split that\ninto two subfunctions of ops control,\n\n317\n00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:05.249\nthat's the console management and\nfacilities management as well.\n\n318\n00:20:05.249 --> 00:20:09.049\nWhere we looked at the physical\nenvironment, such as power and\n\n319\n00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:11.290\nair conditioning and data centers.\n\n320\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.200\nAnd then we've looked at application\nmanagement, where we support the entire\n\n321\n00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.920\nlife cycle in defining the software\ncomponent of our services.\n\n322\n00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.390\nAnd on top of that,\nwe looked at application development too,\n\n323\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.480\nwhere we actually build and deploy and\n\n324\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.800\ntest those services that are specific.\n\n325\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.230\nVery, very specific and\nunique to our organization.\n\n326\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.740\nSo what I'd like you to do now is I'd\nlike you to refer back to your notes.\n\n327\n00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:46.150\nAnd you will see some, what I would call,\nbeing English, revision exercises or\n\n328\n00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:51.170\nstudy exercises that will help\nyou to understand further and\n\n329\n00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:56.170\nget a little bit more into depth in the\nconcept of the three technical areas of\n\n330\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:01.529\ntechnical management, and operations\nmanagement and applications management.\n\n331\n00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.409\nAlright, Jo, well, thank you again for\n\n332\n00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:07.230\nhelping us to understand\nthis a little bit better.\n\n333\n00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:13.190\nI've actually got a great little\nunderstanding between utility and\n\n334\n00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:17.140\nwarranty now that really does help me\nto understand that a little bit better.\n\n335\n00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.140\nApplication management is one of those\nkey elements that helps us to be able\n\n336\n00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.440\nto provide both.\n\n337\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.520\nBut, remember that there is more for\nyou to do than just watch the shows\n\n338\n00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.100\nthat you've been watching so make sure you\nalso do that assignment that Jo is talking\n\n339\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.150\nabout as well and\nreview these concepts as you move on.\n\n340\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.720\nBut, it's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n341\n00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.520\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n342\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.988\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n343\n00:21:39.988 --> 00:21:44.877\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation shows.\n\n344\n00:21:44.877 --> 00:21:50.793\n[MUSIC]\n\n345\n00:21:50.793 --> 00:21:54.351\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

According to Jo, geography, scale, culture and business environment must be considered when implementing organizational management.  Jo describes these management teams that can be organized along technical specialization, activities, geography; they also have benefits and drawbacks that must be considered too.  She also mentions the possibility of working toward a hybrid approach in which core services can be shared without duplication of services and services that need localization can be provided as needed.",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.857\nWelcome to IT ProTV I am your\nhost Don Pezet [CROSSTALK].\n\n2\n00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:12.097\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:15.020\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.990\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n5\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.685\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ndiving into organizational management,\n\n6\n00:00:25.685 --> 00:00:29.470\nbut with a Z instead of an S.\n\n7\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.625\nNow, we have with us, of course, then,\nour master at ITIL herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:39.760\nJo, is it okay that we\nactually do this with a Z?\n\n9\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know what?\n\n10\n00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.214\nIt's gonna be difficult for me but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:44.214 --> 00:00:46.268\n&gt;&gt; We can manage it just this once.\n\n12\n00:00:46.268 --> 00:00:47.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n13\n00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.080\nSo Jo as we, I know it's a joke but\n\n14\n00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.890\nat the same time, we do understand\nsome of these different things.\n\n15\n00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.690\nNow, when we start talking about\norganizational management,\n\n16\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.300\nthis sounds fairly like an umbrella\ntype of term that we're covering,\n\n17\n00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.760\nwhat are we looking at here?\n\n18\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're actually going to be\nlooking at the organizational structures\n\n19\n00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.610\nthat we could have within\nany IT service provider.\n\n20\n00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.560\nThe last few sections that we did,\nthe few sessions that we did.\n\n21\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.130\nWe looked at functional areas.\n\n22\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.060\nAnd a functional area is a group of\npeople and the skills that they use.\n\n23\n00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.862\nAnd I have said to you time and\ntime again, ad nauseam,\n\n24\n00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:29.360\nthat we can't tell you how\nto organize your IT teams.\n\n25\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.800\nBut you know what,\nwe're gonna give you some ideas.\n\n26\n00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.660\nAnd that's what this\nsection's really about.\n\n27\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.810\nIt's just giving you some ideas.\n\n28\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.920\nSo this, again, is a very short section\nthat really is just going to go\n\n29\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.600\nover the different types of organizational\nstructure there are and the pros and\n\n30\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.450\ncons of each of those types\nof organizational structure.\n\n31\n00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.750\nSo if you take a look\nat your course notes,\n\n32\n00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.490\nyou will see that we have got four\ntypes of organizational structure.\n\n33\n00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.840\nWe look at things like,\nor rather not four types,\n\n34\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.010\nthese are the four influences that will\ndecide what type of structure we have.\n\n35\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.970\nSo let's look at our geography,\n\n36\n00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.220\nwhere our offices are located,\nwhere our business is located.\n\n37\n00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.700\nMaybe we have manufacturing plants\nthat are in one particular state or\n\n38\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.825\nmaybe our offices could be in\nanother country, for instance.\n\n39\n00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:25.450\nThink about the scale of\nthe organization too.\n\n40\n00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.520\nAnd think about the culture.\n\n41\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.390\nSome people work very,\nvery well in a collaborative environment.\n\n42\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.570\nBut some cultures actually require,\nand prefer,\n\n43\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.000\nas well,\nhaving a hierarchical structure, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.400\nAnd then think about\nthe business environment itself.\n\n45\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.810\nWhat type of business\norganization are you in?\n\n46\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.640\nAre you in an organization that\nis geared very much towards\n\n47\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.650\ntechnical specialities where\npeople tend to work in silos?\n\n48\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.020\nOr are you in an organization where\ncollaboration is really important?\n\n49\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.240\nSo let's take a look, then,\nat one of the first structures that\n\n50\n00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.100\nwe could employ within service operations,\nokay?\n\n51\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.880\nSo you see here that this is what\nwe probably all see every day.\n\n52\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.370\nThis looks to me to be a fairly\ntypical organizational structure for\n\n53\n00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.110\nmost IT teams and\nmost IT service providers.\n\n54\n00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.219\nAnd that's organization by\ntechnical specification.\n\n55\n00:03:28.996 --> 00:03:33.712\nIt's easy to set internal performance\nobjectives because everybody knows\n\n56\n00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:36.520\nwhat each individual\nteam is supposed to do.\n\n57\n00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.880\nSo you've got the people with\nthe right skills that are managing\n\n58\n00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.880\nthose specific areas.\n\n59\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.810\nWe can manage training,\nwe can manage performance reviews, etc.\n\n60\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.290\nBut then,\nwe've got a down side to this too.\n\n61\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.960\nLook at that siloed mentality.\n\n62\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.210\nI mentioned in previous sections,\n\n63\n00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.040\nand it's one of the big dangers\nwithin incident management.\n\n64\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.490\nNot only incidents, on problems as well.\n\n65\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.730\nAnd even requests that get\npassed from pillar to post.\n\n66\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.400\nThey get passed from one team to another,\nto another, to another.\n\n67\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.980\nSo imagine you have an incident, and\nyou've got an incident that's got a four\n\n68\n00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.870\nhour response on that service\nlevel target for that incident.\n\n69\n00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:24.070\nAnd we know that it's something\nto do with our infrastructure.\n\n70\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.972\nSo the incidence is raised by the service\ndesk and the service desk is trying and\n\n71\n00:04:28.972 --> 00:04:32.940\ndo some determination on\nincident investigation diagnosis.\n\n72\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.980\nAnd they then,\nthey spend 30 minutes on that incident.\n\n73\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.320\nWell, now we're down to three and\n\n74\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.210\na half hours left on that\nparticular service level target.\n\n75\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.080\nBut they've decided that they need\nto escalate it functionally and\n\n76\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.835\nthey think it's something\nto do with the network.\n\n77\n00:04:48.835 --> 00:04:51.655\nSo what they're going\nto do is they're going\n\n78\n00:04:51.655 --> 00:04:53.875\nto escalate it to network operations.\n\n79\n00:04:55.015 --> 00:04:58.325\nAnd then our network operations team,\nwe can see them down there\n\n80\n00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:03.540\nunder infrastructure operations, and\nnetwork operations team they look at it.\n\n81\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.160\nBut it takes them about 15 minutes\nto actually pick up the incident and\n\n82\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.390\n15 minutes to investigate and\nthen they decide, well actually,\n\n83\n00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.350\nit's not really anything to do with them,\nit's something to do with middleware.\n\n84\n00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.639\nSo they're going to pass\nit to the server guys.\n\n85\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.840\nAnd the server guys then take a look at\nit, server operations, as we call them.\n\n86\n00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.770\nAnd it's taken them 15 minutes to pick it\nup, and it's taken them another 15 minutes\n\n87\n00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.660\nto look at it before they decide\nthat actually it's got nothing\n\n88\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.040\nto do with server it's back to\nnetwork again, it's a network problem.\n\n89\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.920\nAnd so\nwhat's happened is we have just wasted,\n\n90\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.450\nliterally wasted, an hour and\na half of that service level target time.\n\n91\n00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.250\nWe only have four hours and\nnow we've only got two and\n\n92\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.315\na half hours and nobody's started\nto resolve that incident yet.\n\n93\n00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:54.140\nWe're still in exactly the same\nposition as we were when\n\n94\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.210\nthat incident was first raised and\nyet one and half hours has elapsed.\n\n95\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.590\nAnd this is what happens\nwith that siloed mentality.\n\n96\n00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.470\nAnd it's very, very easy to get\ninto that siloed mentality as well.\n\n97\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.270\nLet's think about the teams that\ndon't want to collaborate and\n\n98\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.180\nthe teams that don't work very well\ntogether, you'll find the, them and\n\n99\n00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.190\nus, sort of mentality there, that says,\nwell, I don't wanna share information\n\n100\n00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.430\nwith that team because you never know\nthey might trying take over our jobs.\n\n101\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.950\nIt sounds crazy, doesn't it?\n\n102\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.670\nBut you know I've heard this before.\n\n103\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.900\nI've heard it way too many times.\n\n104\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.985\nSo you end up with fragmented knowledge\nbecause nobody wants to share knowledge.\n\n105\n00:06:33.985 --> 00:06:37.000\nAnd we've got that siloed mentality.\n\n106\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.500\nSo not only does that create difficulty\nfor things like incident resolution, but\n\n107\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.290\njust look at change management,\nchange assessments, and change schedules.\n\n108\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.200\nAnd if you're relying on somebody else and\n\n109\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.910\nthey're in a different team to you,\nto do some work.\n\n110\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.410\nThink about project management,\n\n111\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.270\na lot of projects actually progressed\nthrough tasks and dependencies.\n\n112\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.680\nOne action is dependent on\nthe previous one being completed.\n\n113\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.290\nSo all you need is one\nperson to hold that up, and\n\n114\n00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.150\nthe whole project is then\nheld up by one bottleneck.\n\n115\n00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.850\nAnd it could be just something simple,\n\n116\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.050\nlike two teams didn't\nwanna talk to each other.\n\n117\n00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.930\nSo technical specification allows for\ntechnical experience and\n\n118\n00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.980\ntechnical expertise to be built, but\nit can create a siloed mentality.\n\n119\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.820\nNow I'm not gonna tell you that any one\nof these structures is right or wrong.\n\n120\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.844\nWhat I'm gonna point out are the benefits\nto these structures, and also the dangers\n\n121\n00:07:34.844 --> 00:07:38.089\nas well, the pitfalls that we can\nfall into with these structures.\n\n122\n00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:44.100\nSo, in this particular structure,\nthen, we can organize by activity.\n\n123\n00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.710\nOrganizing by activity\nmeans that we've got groups\n\n124\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.010\nthat have got related activities\nthat are organized together.\n\n125\n00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.750\nSo, for instance, rather than having,\n\n126\n00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.360\nif we look in the previous structure, you\ncan see that we've got mainframe teams,\n\n127\n00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.690\nand we've got server teams, and\nwe've got storage teams, and\n\n128\n00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.560\nwe've got a network team, and then\nwe've got different application teams.\n\n129\n00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.620\nWell, at the moment, in that structure\nthere right in front of you,\n\n130\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.360\nfinancial application, and HR application,\nand business application may have\n\n131\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.660\ndifferent backup requirements and they\nmay even be managed by different teams.\n\n132\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.010\nBut if we go into this particular\nstructure, then the backups for\n\n133\n00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.774\nall of those applications\nwill be managed by one team,\n\n134\n00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:31.016\nwhich allows for prioritization.\n\n135\n00:08:31.016 --> 00:08:34.670\nThat's great, but\nthen we still have conflicts, then,\n\n136\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.640\nbetween those applications\nas to who is more important?\n\n137\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.730\nSo the output from each team is\nbased on a collective output and\n\n138\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.310\ncollective achievement.\n\n139\n00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.350\nHowever, it would also\nencourage collaboration but\n\n140\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.270\nwe then might have challenges\nwith prioritization.\n\n141\n00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.710\nBecause, you see, I can do more\nthan one thing at the same time.\n\n142\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.280\nI can only either schedule a backup for\n\n143\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.290\nthis particular application or I can\nperform the backup for this application.\n\n144\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.250\nBut I can't do both of\nthem at the same time.\n\n145\n00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.220\nAnd what about the fact that,\nhere I am working in mainframe and\n\n146\n00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.810\nthe server guys might actually\nhave a similar skill set to me.\n\n147\n00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:24.760\nAnd so they're gonna be duplicating their\nwork because we're based on activity and\n\n148\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.250\nwe're based on output.\n\n149\n00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.850\nAnd look at that bottom bullet point,\nthe bottom negative point there.\n\n150\n00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.960\nThat tells us that we're still not got any\nfocus on what the customer actually needs.\n\n151\n00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.680\nAnd actually, that's what we need to have,\nso [LAUGH] I jumped on a bit.\n\n152\n00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.520\nWe need to have focus on the customer,\nor focus on that value delivery.\n\n153\n00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.420\nSo we might have organizational\nstructures that are process-built.\n\n154\n00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.906\nAnd organizational structures that are\nprocess-built are those structures that\n\n155\n00:09:57.906 --> 00:10:04.120\nare incident management, and\nproblem management, and change management,\n\n156\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.600\nand releasing deployment management,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n157\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.449\nAnd you end up with\npotentially 26 different teams.\n\n158\n00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:15.835\nYou won't have that\nduplication in activity,\n\n159\n00:10:15.835 --> 00:10:21.911\nyou shouldn't have that reinventing\nthe wheel that happens sometimes,\n\n160\n00:10:21.911 --> 00:10:25.270\nbut it's still going to promote silos.\n\n161\n00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.888\nWe looked, in the previous session,\nat incident management and\n\n162\n00:10:28.888 --> 00:10:33.561\nproblem management and we actually did a\nseparate session looking at the difference\n\n163\n00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:38.260\nis between them but also the relationships\nbetween incidents and problems.\n\n164\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.090\nAnd can you imagine if there\nis a siloed environment\n\n165\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.510\nwhere we organize by incident management,\nand problem management.\n\n166\n00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.290\nCan you imagine the conflict between them?\n\n167\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.490\nJust think, the incident management\nteam will want to get out that tape and\n\n168\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.140\nwill want to restore service\nas quickly as possible.\n\n169\n00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.700\nBut the problem, management team will be\nfighting to actually stop anybody from\n\n170\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.210\nusing the tape because they want to watch\nit happen again to see what's causing it.\n\n171\n00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.150\nThere's going to be a huge conflict and\n\n172\n00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.150\nthere's going to be a conflict\nbetween a lot of these processes.\n\n173\n00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.340\nI always look at,\nwhen we look at conflict,\n\n174\n00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.750\nI look at configuration management.\n\n175\n00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.500\nAnd configuration management,\nand I've said previously,\n\n176\n00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:26.480\nthe configuration management system\nunderpins all other processes.\n\n177\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.213\nSo let's think about the service desk.\n\n178\n00:11:28.213 --> 00:11:31.280\nAnd the service desk has a role to\n\n179\n00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.590\nensure that we can restore normal serve\noperation as quickly as possible.\n\n180\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.230\nBut when they answer the telephone\nthe first thing that they ask is, well,\n\n181\n00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.240\nI think, in previous session I asked\nRonnie for his name and his user ID, etc.\n\n182\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.995\nAnd by taking his name and his user ID,\nthey were able to input it into the call\n\n183\n00:11:48.995 --> 00:11:52.495\nlogging system and\nit brought up all of the details.\n\n184\n00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:56.475\nNow one of the things that we've got\nto rely on is that service desk having\n\n185\n00:11:56.475 --> 00:11:59.845\nthe ability to be able\nto update those details.\n\n186\n00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:02.375\nSo when they ask Ronnie\nwhat PC he's got and\n\n187\n00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:04.982\nhe tells them that he's\ngot a different PC now.\n\n188\n00:12:04.982 --> 00:12:11.582\nThey need to be able to update the details\nin the configuration management system.\n\n189\n00:12:11.582 --> 00:12:16.215\nBecause it's the purpose of configuration\nmanagement to maintain accurate and\n\n190\n00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:17.652\nreliable information.\n\n191\n00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:22.578\nBut can you imagine how efficient we\nwouldn't be if configuration management,\n\n192\n00:12:22.578 --> 00:12:26.128\nas a process, turned around\nto the service desk and said,\n\n193\n00:12:26.128 --> 00:12:29.619\nyou are not allowed to update\nour database, it's ours.\n\n194\n00:12:29.619 --> 00:12:35.270\nYeah, there'd be no efficiencies, and\nwe'd not have accurate information either.\n\n195\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.140\nSo that approach,\nthe process approach, creates silos.\n\n196\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.290\nIt doesn't break them down.\n\n197\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.520\nNow certain processes\nneed to be kept separate.\n\n198\n00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.328\nThings like financial management and\nsecurity management.\n\n199\n00:12:48.328 --> 00:12:52.800\nYeah, we wanna keep them separate\nbecause they're very, very specialized.\n\n200\n00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.080\nAnd, in fact, it's mentioned there that\nassets and configuration management,\n\n201\n00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.210\nwe have to have\na particular focus on that.\n\n202\n00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.120\nBut nevertheless, it shouldn't\nbe kept completely separate from\n\n203\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.290\nthe other processes, and even financial\nmanagement and security management\n\n204\n00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.780\nshouldn't be completely separate\nfrom all the other processes.\n\n205\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.100\nSo you'll notice that as we move through\nand we get into the geography and\n\n206\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.440\nthe hybrid,\nyou'll see that actually these particular\n\n207\n00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.890\norganizational charts are growing.\n\n208\n00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.530\nIn other words, it's an evolution.\n\n209\n00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:30.040\nAnd as an organization grows,\nthen it's quite natural for\n\n210\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.170\nan organization to evolve.\n\n211\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.373\nWe can organize by geography, and\norganizing by geography means that\n\n212\n00:13:38.373 --> 00:13:44.210\nwe've got processes and we've got\nactivities in each particular location.\n\n213\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.105\nThat's great.\n\n214\n00:13:46.105 --> 00:13:50.509\nBut look at that second bullet point\nwith a minus symbol next to it,\n\n215\n00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:54.035\nmultiple duplication of roles and\nactivities.\n\n216\n00:13:54.035 --> 00:13:58.415\nWe're not just reinventing the wheel,\nwe're completing ripping it up and\n\n217\n00:13:58.415 --> 00:14:01.895\nthen we're starting again\nin every single location.\n\n218\n00:14:01.895 --> 00:14:03.915\nWe're smashing it to pieces.\n\n219\n00:14:03.915 --> 00:14:09.522\nAnd so, we end up with four different\nversions of incident management and\n\n220\n00:14:09.522 --> 00:14:12.922\nfour different versions of\nproblem management, and\n\n221\n00:14:12.922 --> 00:14:15.362\nfour different versions\nof change management.\n\n222\n00:14:15.362 --> 00:14:17.442\nThere is no consistency.\n\n223\n00:14:17.442 --> 00:14:22.222\nAnd what about services that\nare shared right across that geography,\n\n224\n00:14:22.222 --> 00:14:24.642\nlike our network, for instance.\n\n225\n00:14:24.642 --> 00:14:25.902\nWho takes ownership of that?\n\n226\n00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.580\nAnd, again,\nare we focusing on our customer here and\n\n227\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.640\nwhat's delivering value to our customer?\n\n228\n00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.420\nOr are we focusing on the,\nhow should we say,\n\n229\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.730\nthe competition between our\ngeographical locations?\n\n230\n00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.090\nIt looks to me like that particular\nstructure could lend itself to focus\n\n231\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.639\non the competition between\ngeographical locations.\n\n232\n00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.702\nIdeally, what we want to\nreally aim towards is a hybrid\n\n233\n00:14:55.702 --> 00:14:59.990\nstructure, which allows for\ncombined functions\n\n234\n00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:05.205\nwhere the functional areas are defined\nto meet the needs of the organization.\n\n235\n00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:07.215\nSo its a mixture of everything.\n\n236\n00:15:07.215 --> 00:15:11.255\nIt could be,\nif we look at the basis of that structure,\n\n237\n00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:15.480\nit seems to be based on\nfunctional structure.\n\n238\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.056\nBut it's not, because we have functional\nand we have a mixture of geographical in\n\n239\n00:15:20.056 --> 00:15:23.190\nthere and we have a mixture\nof activity based, as well.\n\n240\n00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:29.470\nSo the idea here is,\nthat we have dedicated functionality\n\n241\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.630\nin the areas that we need\ndedicated functionality.\n\n242\n00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.600\nBut we don't have a duplication\nof activities, and\n\n243\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.430\nwe don't have a duplication of processes.\n\n244\n00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:44.854\nSo we still have consistency,\nwe still have structure,\n\n245\n00:15:44.854 --> 00:15:49.880\nand we still have a focus\non delivery of services.\n\n246\n00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.680\nThis allows us to manage shared services,\nand\n\n247\n00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:58.030\nallows us to manage our shared\ncomponents such as our infrastructure.\n\n248\n00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:05.250\nThis structure can be hard to manage.\n\n249\n00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.840\nCan be,\nif we don't have the right skills, okay?\n\n250\n00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:14.720\nAnd so it's very, very important that\nthe management that are responsible for\n\n251\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.240\nthis structure have the right skills and\n\n252\n00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.480\nthe right experience to be able\nto manage in this environment.\n\n253\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.120\nNow at this point in time,\nyou have a case study exercise which\n\n254\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.870\nlooks at organizational structures\nwithin service operation.\n\n255\n00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:39.740\nAnd what we'd like you to do right\nnow is to spend 30 minutes looking\n\n256\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.840\nat that exercise and analyzing,\ngiven the case structure, what you would\n\n257\n00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:50.760\nconsider to be the best structure for\nthat organization within the case study.\n\n258\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.910\nIf you have any questions or\nany challenges, then please\n\n259\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:59.306\nlog on to our forum, let us know and\nwe'll be only too happy to help you.\n\n260\n00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:03.610\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well,\nthank you again for helping us out as we\n\n261\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.280\nstart to take a look at the idea of\nthe organization management here.\n\n262\n00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.440\nVery key that we get these concepts\ndown as our organization grows,\n\n263\n00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.150\nas our organization changes,\nto know exactly what we want in place or\n\n264\n00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.780\nat least what we need to have in place,\nas well.\n\n265\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.290\nThat's also a great place for\nus to sign off then for this episode.\n\n266\n00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.270\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n267\n00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n268\n00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:32.125\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Intermediate Service Operation

Jo describes the goal is to have all the tools and technology that supports the core functionality so the SLA targets can be met through the process capability.  Obtaining these tools and technology may be based on the MoSCoW (must have, should have, could have and won’t have) prioritization for example, says Jo.  She reminds us that all tools must have relevance to the overall value to the organization.",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.140\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.359\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.580\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.190\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.970\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Operation show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.570\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n9\n00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.380\ntoday, we're taking a look at\ntechnology considerations specifically,\n\n10\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.940\ndiving into some of the different tools\nand technology that we have to understand.\n\n11\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.560\nAnd here to help us, of course, is gonna\nbe our ITIL virtuoso herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.220\nJo, Welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.370\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.320\nHow are you?\n\n15\n00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.320\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great.\n\n16\n00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.910\nNow, we're moving into this idea\nof technology considerations.\n\n17\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.980\nWe've talked a lot in just the last few\nepisodes to make sure that we're kind\n\n18\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.060\nof gathering all of our ducks in a row,\nmaking sure we've got everything here.\n\n19\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.825\nWhat are we taking a look at here\nin this idea of the technology?\n\n20\n00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:58.110\n&gt;&gt; So like you say, in a lot of our\nprevious episodes, we have talked at\n\n21\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.040\ngreat lengths about the processes that\nexist within service operation and\n\n22\n00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.905\nwe've looked at the activities that\nare undertaken as part of those processes.\n\n23\n00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:11.025\nAnd we even looked at the people in the\nskills that performed those activities.\n\n24\n00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:13.965\nSo now what we're going to do is\nwe're going to look at the tools that\n\n25\n00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:16.645\nare going to help us with\nall of those activities.\n\n26\n00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:20.015\nSo we're not necessarily looking\nat the services themselves,\n\n27\n00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:23.215\nwe're looking at the tools\nthat we use within IT\n\n28\n00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:28.110\nto support the activities and\nto support the services.\n\n29\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.969\n&gt;&gt; All right so Jo again,\ntaking a look at it from my perspective,\n\n30\n00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.300\nnot being in really in depth into ITIL.\n\n31\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.140\nAs we started talking about service\noperation and providing a value to\n\n32\n00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.815\nthe customer I'm not seeing the connection\nwhere tools help to provide a value for\n\n33\n00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:46.815\nthe customer, so help me out here.\n\n34\n00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:47.315\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n35\n00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:50.365\nWell, let's look at this\nfrom a logical perspective.\n\n36\n00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:54.815\nLet's just say that you called a service\ndesk, any sort of service desk.\n\n37\n00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:59.045\nThe first thing that you would expect them\nto ask you be would for your name, or for\n\n38\n00:01:59.045 --> 00:01:59.985\nyour user ID.\n\n39\n00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:00.535\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n40\n00:02:00.535 --> 00:02:01.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n41\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.310\nSo what are they gonna do\nwith that information?\n\n42\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.510\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna enter\nthat into a database.\n\n43\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nImagine they didn't have that database.\n\n44\n00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.710\n&gt;&gt; It'd be much harder\nto find out anything.\n\n45\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, so they're gonna have to\nask you, every time you call up,\n\n46\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.580\nthey're gonna have to ask\nyou all of your details.\n\n47\n00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n48\n00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.340\nSo they'd ask you all of your details, and\nthen they might log it into I don't know.\n\n49\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.480\nWell if they didn't have a tool,\nit would probably be on a piece of paper.\n\n50\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.110\nMaybe they'd have an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n51\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.440\nBut then how would then then escalate\nthat incident to another support team?\n\n52\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.660\n&gt;&gt; That would be challenging as well.\n\n53\n00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nthey wouldn't be able to do that.\n\n54\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.900\nAnd then when you called to find out\nwhat was happening with your incident.\n\n55\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.395\nThe person that you speak to might not be\nthe same person as the person that you\n\n56\n00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:47.050\nspoke to last time.\n\n57\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n58\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.940\n&gt;&gt; So then how would they find out\nabout the progress of your incident.\n\n59\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.870\n&gt;&gt; It'd be very difficult.\n\n60\n00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.590\n&gt;&gt; It would be incredibly difficult.\n\n61\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.080\nAnd so\nwe just looked at one process right now.\n\n62\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.960\nBut in terms of incident management,\n\n63\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.750\nincident management without the tool\nset to support it is just not possible.\n\n64\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.020\nWe just simply cannot be efficient nor\neffective with incident management.\n\n65\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.550\nBut then I think of all of\nour other processes too.\n\n66\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.420\nAnd I've mentioned in great detail in\nprevious sessions about service asset and\n\n67\n00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.670\nconfiguration management.\n\n68\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.570\nAbout having single source of accurate and\n\n69\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.600\nreliable information about all of our\nassets and the components of our services.\n\n70\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.755\nImagine if we did not have that.\n\n71\n00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:33.594\nImagine if I had to find out information\nevery time I raised a change record.\n\n72\n00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:37.768\nSo every time I raised a request for\nchange, let's say I was swapping out\n\n73\n00:03:37.768 --> 00:03:41.616\na server, if I did not know how\nmany people were using that server.\n\n74\n00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:45.324\nIf I didn't know where that\nserver was physically located,\n\n75\n00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:49.976\njust think of the impact it would have\nwhen I decided to turn that server off,\n\n76\n00:03:49.976 --> 00:03:53.630\nto power it down, and\nto swap something out in that server.\n\n77\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.740\nI wouldn't be able to communicate\nwith you to tell you that\n\n78\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.580\nwe were going to perform some\nmaintainance on the server.\n\n79\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.470\nIt would just happen.\n\n80\n00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.420\nHow impressed would you be?\n\n81\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.060\n&gt;&gt; Not very impressed.\n\n82\n00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd that's why we need tools.\n\n83\n00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.340\nThat's why.\n\n84\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.210\nSo there's no right or\nwrong when it comes to tools.\n\n85\n00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.540\nAbsolutely not.\n\n86\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.770\nAnd you'll see that we need\nsome core functionality here.\n\n87\n00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:23.080\nSo we need things like self help,\nwe need FAQ areas for\n\n88\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.115\nour customers and our users to go to.\n\n89\n00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:29.625\nAnd Self Help means logging and\nrecording their own incidents and\n\n90\n00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:34.215\ntheir own requests as we've already seen,\nbut that's the customer visible\n\n91\n00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:38.340\nside of things, you know, like the service\ncatalogue that appears on the intranet.\n\n92\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.430\nImagine if we didn't have that\nservice catalog and the users and\n\n93\n00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.250\nthe customers just simply didn't know\nwhat services we supported and provided.\n\n94\n00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.760\nThat's the Self Help.\n\n95\n00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.680\nAnd then that's what we call\nthe Workflow Process Engine.\n\n96\n00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.840\nAnd the Workflow Process Engine is\nan engine that controls a workflow or\n\n97\n00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.360\na process.\n\n98\n00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.440\nSo that's the incident management tool.\n\n99\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.960\nIncident management tool is moved in\nto just a call logging tool by the way.\n\n100\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.240\nMuch more than that.\n\n101\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.730\nBecause of course we've got integration\ninto problem management and\n\n102\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.020\nchange management, services and\nconfiguration management,\n\n103\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.810\nrequest fulfillment and access management.\n\n104\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.220\nWow!\nI've just listed six off the top of my\n\n105\n00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.260\nhead, and that doesn't even begin to\nscratch the surface of the integration of\n\n106\n00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.950\nthat particular tool.\n\n107\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.110\nBut what it does is it manages each one,\neach of those processes,\n\n108\n00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.490\nit manages right the way\nthroughout its life.\n\n109\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.070\nSo that workflow or\nprocess engine takes a raised incident.\n\n110\n00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.580\nIt enables us to log that incident.\n\n111\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.000\nIt enables us to relate it to a problem or\nto a change, or even to request.\n\n112\n00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.410\nIt enables us to relate it to asset within\nthe configuration management system, and\n\n113\n00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.800\nthen after it's done that it then manages\nthat incidence through its life cycle too.\n\n114\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.970\nSo it will tell us if there are any\nother incidents that have been logged\n\n115\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.230\nrelating to that same service.\n\n116\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.527\nIt tells us what our service\nlevel targets are and\n\n117\n00:06:04.527 --> 00:06:08.000\nthen it'll tell us when we're about to\nbreach those service level targets.\n\n118\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.555\nSo that if we're having to escalate\nthat incident well it allows us to pass\n\n119\n00:06:11.555 --> 00:06:13.360\nthe incident to another team.\n\n120\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.480\nBut then it tells us again that you\npass it to another team but you've\n\n121\n00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.770\nonly got two and a half hours left on that\nservice level target to respond to it.\n\n122\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.810\nAnd that's just one tool.\n\n123\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.410\nThat's just one tool\nthat's doing all of this.\n\n124\n00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.520\nAnd it gives us that integration for\nthe configuration management system.\n\n125\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.380\nAnd that one tool can also be the same\ntool that communicates with the users.\n\n126\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.100\nNowadays, most service management tool\nsets, or workflow process engines have\n\n127\n00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.425\nan interface with some form of either\nSMS or some form of Mobile App.\n\n128\n00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:52.215\nThat actually notifies\nthe customer in real time\n\n129\n00:06:52.215 --> 00:06:57.205\nwhen an incident has been updated or\nwhen an incident has been resolved, etc..\n\n130\n00:06:57.205 --> 00:07:00.845\nSo it actually gives us that increased and\nenhanced communication.\n\n131\n00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:04.595\nLIke I said, this is just one tool.\n\n132\n00:07:04.595 --> 00:07:06.505\nAnd then what about other\ntools that we might have?\n\n133\n00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:09.510\nWell, we might have discovery tools.\n\n134\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.430\nNot all the discovery\ntools are invaluable,\n\n135\n00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.610\nbecause they tell us who's\ngot what on the network.\n\n136\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.660\nAnd it's not just about finding out\nwho's uploaded something on their\n\n137\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.340\nlaptop that they shouldn't have uploaded.\n\n138\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.580\nIt helps us with security, sure.\n\n139\n00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.030\nIt tells us who's plugged in what\ninto their desktop or their laptop.\n\n140\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.870\nAnd that might seem quite\nfrivolous to some, but\n\n141\n00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.660\nthen to others in places of high\nsecurity areas, maybe banks,\n\n142\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.530\nmaybe government agencies,\nmaybe our military etc.\n\n143\n00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.440\nThen we want to know who's\nplugging what into our devices.\n\n144\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.290\nSo we have discovery tools,\n\n145\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.030\ndiscovery tools help us with\nlicensing as well, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.213\nAnd then we have remote control tools.\n\n147\n00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:54.914\nNow remote control tools depending\non what side of the fence you're on,\n\n148\n00:07:54.914 --> 00:07:58.162\nthey can either be loathed,\nor they can be loved.\n\n149\n00:07:58.162 --> 00:08:02.047\nBut I find remote control tools very,\nvery useful So,\n\n150\n00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:06.522\nbecause remote control tools\nallow a service desk analyst, or\n\n151\n00:08:06.522 --> 00:08:11.420\nany technical support analyst,\nto log directly onto the computer,\n\n152\n00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:17.050\nthe desktop, the laptop of the user and\nsee exactly what's going on.\n\n153\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.600\nAnd you know we can even use remote\ncontrol tools to help with training too.\n\n154\n00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.700\nWe can provide training\nover remote control tools.\n\n155\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.810\nThen we've got diagnostic utility tools.\n\n156\n00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.840\nAnd diagnostic utility tools,\nwell are like\n\n157\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.460\nan FAQ area in certain respects\nonly from more technical people.\n\n158\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:43.120\nDiagnostic utility tools will help us\ndiagnose any incidence or any problems.\n\n159\n00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.800\nAnd it's not just about\ntelling us where to look but\n\n160\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.480\nthey can actually run certain scripts and\nthey can run certain things like\n\n161\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.070\nwe've all got them\nthe virus checker software.\n\n162\n00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.860\nThat's a diagnostic utility tool.\n\n163\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.457\nEvery time we run a virus check,\nwe run in a diagnostic utility.\n\n164\n00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:05.340\nAnd then of course we've got reporting and\ndashboards.\n\n165\n00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.750\nReporting is a point in time information\ngenerally over a period of that\n\n166\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:16.320\ntells us how we're performing\nagainst our service level targets.\n\n167\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.920\nWhereas dashboards, they're real time.\n\n168\n00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.960\nThat tells us how we're\nperforming right now.\n\n169\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.300\nWe will use dashboards to look at our\nnetwork and to tell us what parts of our\n\n170\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.740\nnetwork are open, what parts are down,\nand what backups are in progress and\n\n171\n00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.590\nwhat backups have started and\nwhat backups have finished.\n\n172\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:39.020\nSo dashboards are actually a very,\nvery good tool to give us a snapshot\n\n173\n00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.900\nof right here, right now,\nwhat's happening with our network.\n\n174\n00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.930\nNow we're also going to use\nbusiness management tools.\n\n175\n00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:51.370\nAnd business management tools,\nwhere we integrate simply with\n\n176\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.180\nthe organization that\nallows us to assist and\n\n177\n00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:01.460\nto facilitate the organization in\nmanaging some of their activities.\n\n178\n00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.360\nFinancial management, for instance.\n\n179\n00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.490\nFinancial management is a perfect example\nof where we'll use the same tool both\n\n180\n00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.100\nwithin IT and outside in\nthe business to manage our accounts.\n\n181\n00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.170\nWhy not?\n\n182\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.100\nAnd then of course nowadays, we're moving\nmore into the sort of the software as\n\n183\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.460\na service, as we move towards things like\nCloud Computing, and we move towards\n\n184\n00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:29.700\ngoing outside to external providers to\nprovide us with an entire service itself.\n\n185\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.060\nRather than just focusing on one\nparticular component of a service.\n\n186\n00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.830\nSo now we look to the various\ntools that we use.\n\n187\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.210\nHow do we select that tool?\n\n188\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.720\nWell I mentioned in a previous\nsection that we use the MoSCoW or\n\n189\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:52.230\nMoSCoW rule set in order to identify\nwhat our requirements are for any tool.\n\n190\n00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.890\nBearing in mind that tools are supposed\nto give us increase productivity, and\n\n191\n00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.079\nhopefully lead to cost savings, and\n\n192\n00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:01.918\ntherefore even more\nincreased productivity.\n\n193\n00:11:01.918 --> 00:11:06.535\nSo the first thing that we do,\nis we write out our MoSCoW list.\n\n194\n00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:08.454\nAnd that is a must have requirement.\n\n195\n00:11:08.454 --> 00:11:13.320\nI should have requirements, I could have,\nand I won't have right now, or\n\n196\n00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.277\nwould like in the future depending on\nwhich version of MoSCoW you've seen.\n\n197\n00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:21.500\nThey're both pretty much the same thing.\n\n198\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.630\nAnd what we want to achieve is we want\nto go out, and we want to research tools\n\n199\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:32.410\nthat will achieve at least 80%\nof our must have requirements.\n\n200\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.860\nSo, we identify our MoSCoW list, and\n\n201\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.650\nthen we go out and we're in that\nsecond stage in that workflow there,\n\n202\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:46.300\nidentify what products will meet\nthat 80% of our must have list.\n\n203\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:52.550\nThat's our selection criteria, sorry,\nour products evaluated or identified.\n\n204\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.070\nAnd, now we look at selection criteria.\n\n205\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:03.500\nAnd selection criteria may be something\nalong the lines of, is it customizable?\n\n206\n00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.390\nIs that tool easy to use?\n\n207\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.080\nIs it intuitive?\n\n208\n00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.550\nIs that tool scalable?\n\n209\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.554\nCan we increase the number of\nlicenses very, very quickly?\n\n210\n00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:18.305\nThen we evaluate the products.\n\n211\n00:12:18.305 --> 00:12:21.775\nAnd in this particular section\nwhere we evaluate the products,\n\n212\n00:12:21.775 --> 00:12:26.937\nI would suggest that what we do is\nthat we actually rate the products,\n\n213\n00:12:26.937 --> 00:12:30.082\nthat we grade them on a scale of\nsay one to five or one to ten,\n\n214\n00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:34.097\non their ability to perform\nagainst that selection criteria.\n\n215\n00:12:34.097 --> 00:12:40.410\nYou'll notice that we are not\ngrading them on their ability to\n\n216\n00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:45.310\nscore against their requirements, because\nwe know we've already met that 80%, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.830\nWe're grading them on the ability to\nscore against the selection criteria.\n\n218\n00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.370\nAnd we come up with a short list.\n\n219\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:58.080\nAnd that short list, well,\nthat's the one where we\n\n220\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.958\nnot take those products and\nwe actually physically evaluate them.\n\n221\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.905\nWe get the, what do we call them?\n\n222\n00:13:05.905 --> 00:13:10.714\nTrial copies, I guess, of that software\nand we'll take a look at it and\n\n223\n00:13:10.714 --> 00:13:13.600\nwe'll contact the suppliers directly and\n\n224\n00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.530\nwe will asses the performance against\nthat selection criteria, okay.\n\n225\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.847\nAnd then what we will do is\nwe will produce a score card.\n\n226\n00:13:22.847 --> 00:13:26.752\nAnd that score card will show us from\nthat short list whether it's been three\n\n227\n00:13:26.752 --> 00:13:30.983\nproducts, I would say definitely not more\nthan five should be on your short list.\n\n228\n00:13:30.983 --> 00:13:36.325\nAnd we will produce that score card\nthat will rank the products in order of\n\n229\n00:13:36.325 --> 00:13:42.710\ntheir ability to meet both the selection\ncriteria and the requirements as well.\n\n230\n00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.830\nAnd from there,\nwe select that product, okay.\n\n231\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.580\nAnd so that's very simply how\nwe would select the tool.\n\n232\n00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.560\nWe don't select a tool based on\nthe fact that we've got a best friend,\n\n233\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.630\nthough we know that's in that particular\nservice provider organization.\n\n234\n00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.910\nWe select it all based on\nit's performance against\n\n235\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.940\nthe selection criteria and\nthe requirements as well.\n\n236\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.336\nSo let's take a look at our\nindividual processes then.\n\n237\n00:14:09.336 --> 00:14:13.821\nAnd our individual processes\nall require specialists tools,\n\n238\n00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:16.390\nthings like event management.\n\n239\n00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:21.145\nNow event management, well,\nthey're doing the monitoring and\n\n240\n00:14:21.145 --> 00:14:23.138\nthey are doing the acting.\n\n241\n00:14:23.138 --> 00:14:27.174\nRemember they were monitoring,\ndetecting events,\n\n242\n00:14:27.174 --> 00:14:32.923\nmaking sense of them and then determining\nthe appropriate control action.\n\n243\n00:14:32.923 --> 00:14:37.382\nSo their tool needs to cover the entire\ninfrastructure because they need to\n\n244\n00:14:37.382 --> 00:14:40.340\nmonitor the entire infrastructure.\n\n245\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.860\nIt needs to be easy to deploy and\nit needs to be easy to use, and\n\n246\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.640\nit has to have some consistency of course.\n\n247\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:55.890\nNow what we will tell you is that\nthis tool needs to be intuitive.\n\n248\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:00.815\nIt needs to provide value\nto your organization but\n\n249\n00:15:00.815 --> 00:15:06.550\nit's something that your technical teams\nand your operation teams have to support.\n\n250\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.180\nSo we might want auto escalation\nto incidents, for instance.\n\n251\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.270\nWe'll certainly want it to\nproduce reports for us.\n\n252\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:19.170\nAnd we might even want it to route\ncertain alerts to centralize location or\n\n253\n00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.500\nmaybe even to individuals.\n\n254\n00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.430\nBe careful when routing escalations to\nindividuals because that individual is\n\n255\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.990\nnot gonna be working 24 hours a day.\n\n256\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:34.340\nWhatever we select with event management,\nit should have a direct link\n\n257\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:39.570\ninto the incident management tool because\nit has to be able to raise incidents.\n\n258\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.983\nThat's part of that escalation.\n\n259\n00:15:40.983 --> 00:15:45.172\nAnd given that event management\ncould be fully automated and\n\n260\n00:15:45.172 --> 00:15:49.121\nof course it's got to escalate\nto incident management.\n\n261\n00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:52.677\nAnd then of course, we've already talked\nat length about incident management and\n\n262\n00:15:52.677 --> 00:15:55.232\nthe type of tool Tool that we need for\nincident management.\n\n263\n00:15:55.232 --> 00:15:58.680\nAnd that tool needs to be\nable to log incidents.\n\n264\n00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.040\nIt needs to be able to escalate them.\n\n265\n00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.390\nIt needs to be able to manage performance\nagainst the service level targets.\n\n266\n00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:09.350\nIt needs to integrate with our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n267\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.232\nAnd it needs to also integrate\nagainst the front end,\n\n268\n00:16:12.232 --> 00:16:14.291\nhowever that front end is displayed.\n\n269\n00:16:14.291 --> 00:16:19.821\nWhether it's on the Internet, whether\nit's via text message alerts to the user,\n\n270\n00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:22.120\nor whether it's via a mobile app.\n\n271\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.610\nWe definitely need to have integration\ninto the Known Error Database,\n\n272\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.800\ntoo, because they're gonna\ngive us our workarounds\n\n273\n00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.880\nthat will allow us to identify\nhow we restore service.\n\n274\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.680\nRemember, we're not interested\nin resolving problems here.\n\n275\n00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.562\nWe're interested in restoring service.\n\n276\n00:16:39.562 --> 00:16:43.290\nSo databases gonna tell\nus where to find the tape\n\n277\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.710\nto put the piece of paper together.\n\n278\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:50.160\nNow, I expect to see request fulfillment\nperformed in exactly the same tool as\n\n279\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.220\nincident management, because we need to\nbe able to link requests to events or\n\n280\n00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:54.820\nto incidents.\n\n281\n00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.520\nAnd again, we need to have that\nintegration into the front end,\n\n282\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.010\ninto that self-help.\n\n283\n00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:05.350\nWe're gonna be doing pretty much the same\ntype of workflow as incident management\n\n284\n00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:10.230\ndoes, so it makes sense to have\nit all in exactly the same tool.\n\n285\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:15.080\nAnd of course, all of these tools,\nall of these processes produce reports, so\n\n286\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.410\nwe need to have the right\nlevel of reporting.\n\n287\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.020\nNow, one thing I do wanna say about\nreporting, while I mentioned it.\n\n288\n00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.960\nJust because a tool delivers\n500 reports out of the box\n\n289\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.775\ndoes not mean that that's\nthe tool you pick.\n\n290\n00:17:28.775 --> 00:17:31.385\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I said previously, Ronnie\n\n291\n00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:36.860\nlaughs because I said previously we're\nterrible in IT for reporting just for\n\n292\n00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.090\nthe sake of reporting, having a nice,\npretty picture just because it's there.\n\n293\n00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.190\nNo, reports have to be relevant, okay?\n\n294\n00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:51.640\nSo we don't do reporting just for\nthe sake of having reports, okay?\n\n295\n00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.330\nAll reports have to be relevant.\n\n296\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.485\nIf a tool says it's got\n500 out of the box,\n\n297\n00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:58.395\nI'll guarantee that 499 of them,\nyou won't need.\n\n298\n00:17:58.395 --> 00:18:01.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So problem management.\n\n299\n00:18:01.485 --> 00:18:04.830\nPretty much exactly the same\nas incident management, okay?\n\n300\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.470\nWe've gotta have the same relationships.\n\n301\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.080\nWe've gotta relate to incident records and\n\n302\n00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.090\nto known errors, and\nto requests, also to events.\n\n303\n00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:19.330\nWe've got to be able to relate to\nconfiguration items through the CMS.\n\n304\n00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.520\nAnd we've also got to be\nable to raise changes.\n\n305\n00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.870\nNow, the bottom bullet point on this\none is really important because that\n\n306\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:30.370\nbottom bullet point looks at the ability\nto integrate with third parties.\n\n307\n00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.030\nQuite often our problems\nare sent out to suppliers.\n\n308\n00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:39.090\nSo we have to be able to integrate that\nproblem record with supplier software.\n\n309\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.960\nAnd we have to be able to get\nupdates from supplier software.\n\n310\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.150\nAnd don't forget, with problem\nmanagement we've also got to escalate\n\n311\n00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.770\nto the suppliers, and\nnotify our end users at the same time.\n\n312\n00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.260\nSo think about that messaging.\n\n313\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.050\nHow do we do the notification\nto our users as well?\n\n314\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.100\nAnd then access management is\na slightly different beast,\n\n315\n00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.710\nalthough we still gotta log\nthe requests via request fulfillment.\n\n316\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:12.690\nBut we have to have some\nintegration into our HR databases.\n\n317\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.080\nWe have to be able to verify,\nif you remember when we looked at\n\n318\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.025\nthe access management process,\nwe had to be able to verify that that\n\n319\n00:19:22.025 --> 00:19:26.950\nperson is who they say they are, and\nthat that person should have access to\n\n320\n00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:32.200\nthat particular piece of software or\nthat particular service.\n\n321\n00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.270\nSo we have to have some\nintegration into HR okay?\n\n322\n00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:38.090\nWe have to have integration into\n\n323\n00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.990\nchange management because we have\nto be able to raise changes.\n\n324\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.720\nAnd we have to have integration into\nrequest fulfillment because it's a request\n\n325\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.040\nthat we receive to request access.\n\n326\n00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:53.310\nAnd of course,\nbecause we are updating access and we're\n\n327\n00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.640\nupdating people's user profiles, then\nwe've got to have access to that software.\n\n328\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.880\nSo, something like\nMicrosoft Active Directory, etc.,\n\n329\n00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.830\nwill allow us that integration.\n\n330\n00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:10.700\nAnd then, last but no means least\nin this particular section here,\n\n331\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.350\nwe're going to look at\nthe service desk tools.\n\n332\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.790\nNow, the service desk.\n\n333\n00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.110\nWe've already talked about\nincident management, and\n\n334\n00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.450\nwe've talked about requests fulfillment,\netc., and\n\n335\n00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.780\nwe know about things like the known-error\ndatabase and the self-help interface.\n\n336\n00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.130\nBut don't forget the things that the\nservice desk needs to be able to function.\n\n337\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:36.100\nLike a call queuing system or what we call\nan ACD, which is a call queuing system.\n\n338\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.720\nThink about tools that provide\nus with voice over IP or\n\n339\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.225\nan CTI, the customer telephony interface.\n\n340\n00:20:43.225 --> 00:20:51.190\nNow it's not unusual for us to\nreceive a telephone call from a user.\n\n341\n00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:56.440\nAnd actually, what we'd really like on\na service desk is when we receive it,\n\n342\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.880\nour service, our system that we have,\nrecognizes that phone number and\n\n343\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.670\nimmediately populates our database and\n\n344\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.610\ngives us all of the information\nabout that person.\n\n345\n00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.720\nAnd we think to ourselves, well,\nthat would be fantastical, wouldn't it?\n\n346\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.280\nBut you know what?\n\n347\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.010\nThat's a reality for\nmost service desks nowadays.\n\n348\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:18.490\nBut I wanna ask you a question\nwhile we're still on the subject of\n\n349\n00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.870\nservice desk technology.\n\n350\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:26.201\nSo when you call a service desk, Ronnie,\nand you get one of those messages that say\n\n351\n00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:31.780\nif you'd like help with this, press one,\nif you'd like help with this, press two.\n\n352\n00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.070\nThe fact that you're laughing,\ntells me everything.\n\n353\n00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:39.409\nHow many layers do you go down before\nyou give up and hang up the phone?\n\n354\n00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.300\n&gt;&gt; Normally I just press one and\n\n355\n00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.660\nif I get a whole list that goes\none through nine, I hang up.\n\n356\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n357\n00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the average is three.\n\n358\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:51.730\n&gt;&gt; Well that's not bad.\n\n359\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.600\n&gt;&gt; It's not bad at all is it\nbecause I'm with you on this one.\n\n360\n00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.440\nI have no patience for this.\n\n361\n00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.390\nThe average is three.\n\n362\n00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.625\nMost people will hang up\nafter three of those options.\n\n363\n00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:02.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n364\n00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.260\n&gt;&gt; Either that, or they'll start\nshouting operator at the phone, or\n\n365\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.220\nkeep pressing zero until\nthey get somewhere.\n\n366\n00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.390\nBut we tell people when we're advising and\n\n367\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.890\nconsulting a service desk,\nthink about your users.\n\n368\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.100\nAnd you know what,\nif you need to survey your users,\n\n369\n00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.340\nthen survey them and\nask them how they feel about this.\n\n370\n00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.790\nBecause these options are great,\n\n371\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:25.980\nespecially when we talk about\nspecialized service desks.\n\n372\n00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:32.290\nAnd so having a routine to specialize the\nareas where we've got specialized support\n\n373\n00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.410\non hand that can resolve their issues\nthere and then for them, then great.\n\n374\n00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.315\nBut if you get more than three layers?\n\n375\n00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:41.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we all hang up, right?\n\n376\n00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:46.410\nThe key thing when you remember\ntechnology is to remember relevance.\n\n377\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.830\nYour technology and\nyour tools have to meet your needs.\n\n378\n00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.190\nWe don't buy something as a tool just\nbecause it looks good on the box.\n\n379\n00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:02.400\nWe need to give it a try, and\nit has to meet our needs.\n\n380\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.840\nMost of all, it's got to deliver value\nto the service, to the business, sorry.\n\n381\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.020\nAnd like we've already said,\nif it's got more than three layers,\n\n382\n00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.400\nit's not gonna deliver value,\nit's delivering a hindrance.\n\n383\n00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.420\nAnd that's certainly how they see it.\n\n384\n00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.570\nSo with every tool, think relevance.\n\n385\n00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:22.020\nAnd think about whether it'll\nmake your customers and\n\n386\n00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.314\nyour users happy if we employ this tool.\n\n387\n00:23:25.314 --> 00:23:27.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well,\nthank you again for\n\n388\n00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:32.673\nreminding us how valuable the technology\nreally is throughout the entirety of\n\n389\n00:23:32.673 --> 00:23:35.190\nevery part of the ITIL life cycle.\n\n390\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:39.300\nIt really does help us to facilitate and\nto provide that effective and\n\n391\n00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.690\nthe efficiency that we need\nto be able to provide,\n\n392\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:46.090\nof course, the value to our businesses\nthat we will be serving as well.\n\n393\n00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.380\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n394\n00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.030\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n395\n00:23:53.030 -->

As organizational change is constant, there is a need to implement service operation well, Jo says.  This can be achieved if we do not look at service operation as being another added silo team but as partners in the whole of the IT infrastructure, according to Jo.  She also discusses some of the different challenges and risks that come with implementation.",

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:19.102\nYou're watching the ITIL,\nIntermediate Service Operation Show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.669\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n8\n00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.510\nwe're jumping into implementation and\nchallenges.\n\n9\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.450\nAnd here to help us once\nagain is going to be well,\n\n10\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.850\nour master blaster herself in ITIL,\nMiss Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.210\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.860\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for\nhaving me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.560\nHow are you today?\n\n14\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.972\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great, as we start to take\na look here at the idea of implementation,\n\n15\n00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:44.640\nand of course, the challenges.\n\n16\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.490\nThis sounds like a pretty big area for\nus to cover.\n\n17\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.245\nSo, what do we need to do,\nand how do we begin?\n\n18\n00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:54.432\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're going to be\nlooking at in this section here is\n\n19\n00:00:54.432 --> 00:00:57.665\nthe implementation of service operation.\n\n20\n00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:01.625\nAnd also the challenges we\nfaced during service operation.\n\n21\n00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:07.105\nAnd, we quite often don't think about,\ncertainly, the challenges that we face.\n\n22\n00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:11.610\nWe tend to go into service operation\nbelieving that everything is going to work\n\n23\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210\nabsolutely great ,and\neverything's going to be fine.\n\n24\n00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.470\nAnd not really taking into consideration\nthe fact that things can happen [LAUGH].\n\n25\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n26\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.890\n&gt;&gt; And things do go wrong.\n\n27\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.573\nI think there's a saying,\nsomething along those lines, but\n\n28\n00:01:22.573 --> 00:01:24.337\nnothing I could repeat right now [LAUGH].\n\n29\n00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:27.297\nSo, we have to understand that\nthere are other challenges.\n\n30\n00:01:27.297 --> 00:01:32.036\nAnd if we're proactive, and I know\nthat we've mentioned that word in so\n\n31\n00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:33.753\nmany previous sessions.\n\n32\n00:01:33.753 --> 00:01:37.977\nBut if we're proactive in\nidentifying challenges, and\n\n33\n00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:42.240\nthen looking for\nways to overcome those challenges.\n\n34\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.195\nThen, actually we will be more\nefficient and more effective, and\n\n35\n00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:46.636\ndeliver value to the business.\n\n36\n00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:52.360\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, sounds like a great\nopportunity for us, so let's begin.\n\n37\n00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.520\nHow are we gonna start?\n\n38\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.550\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing that we need to\naccept is the fact that change happens.\n\n39\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.170\nYou hear lots of sayings about\nthe only thing that's certain in life\n\n40\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.190\nare death and taxes.\n\n41\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.421\nWell, actually there are three\nthings that are certain in life.\n\n42\n00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:09.031\nAnd the third one is that,\nthings are never gonna stay the same.\n\n43\n00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:15.370\nAnd I know that it sounds so\nobvious, but it is so obvious.\n\n44\n00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.981\nYour business is never going\nto stay exactly the same.\n\n45\n00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:24.697\nThe organization, even though it may have\nthe same direction, it will still change.\n\n46\n00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:29.237\nWe have three different types of\nstrategy that we look at from a very,\n\n47\n00:02:29.237 --> 00:02:30.898\nvery high level in ITIL.\n\n48\n00:02:30.898 --> 00:02:36.150\nAnd the first one is the strategy of\njust simply run into the business.\n\n49\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.410\nJust simply maintaining the status quo.\n\n50\n00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.780\nIn some organizations,\nlike government departments for instance,\n\n51\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.220\nare a perfect example.\n\n52\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.721\nThey don't want to grow,\nthey don't want to do anything different.\n\n53\n00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.230\nThey simply want to\nmaintain the status quo.\n\n54\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.330\nAnother strategy used are strategies for\norganizations that want to grow.\n\n55\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.440\nAnd organizations that want to grow\nare looking to increase their profit.\n\n56\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.650\nThey're looking to increase market share.\n\n57\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.590\nThey're looking to increase\nperhaps their size, as well.\n\n58\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.490\nAnd so, those organizations obviously,\nwell, we consider innovational, and\n\n59\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.170\nwe consider those types of organizations.\n\n60\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.500\nThen we've got the complete extreme,\n\n61\n00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.630\nwhich are the organizations\nthat want to transform.\n\n62\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.150\nAnd these are organizations\nthat will completely diversify\n\n63\n00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.900\noutside of their industry sector.\n\n64\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.391\nAnd we've got a lot of organizations in\nthe world where every time they grow,\n\n65\n00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:28.174\nthey do something completely different.\n\n66\n00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:31.539\nI think of one organization,\nVirgin, for instance,\n\n67\n00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.180\nwhere every time they grow,\nit's something completely different.\n\n68\n00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.500\nFrom aircraft to aerospace,\n\n69\n00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.220\nto fiber optic communication,\nto cell phones, to credit cards.\n\n70\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.270\nEvery time they expand, and\n\n71\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.940\neven though they may do that\nby acquisition or by merger.\n\n72\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.190\nBut every time they expand,\nthey do something completely different.\n\n73\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.968\nBut you know, even those organizations\nthat just want to simply run the business,\n\n74\n00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:03.520\nthe ones who maintain the status quo,\nhave got to change.\n\n75\n00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.180\nLet's face it, Windows 95 is not\ngonna be around forever, nor\n\n76\n00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.910\nis it going to be supported forever.\n\n77\n00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.490\nSo, we have to change.\n\n78\n00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.170\nSo change is the only constant.\n\n79\n00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.680\nWe have to change.\n\n80\n00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.860\nEven when we don't want to, we have to\nacknowledge that even if we're not being\n\n81\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.410\nproactive and innovative in our support of\nthe organization, we still have to change.\n\n82\n00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.370\nAnd for organizations that want to run the\nbusiness, then a lot of change triggers,\n\n83\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.570\nas we say, come out of service operation.\n\n84\n00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.620\nBecause they come as a result of failures.\n\n85\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.534\nThey come as a result of\nyou know the problems,\n\n86\n00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:42.093\nidentifying root causes to incidents.\n\n87\n00:04:42.093 --> 00:04:47.500\nBut they also come as a result of supplier\nnotifications on preventative maintenance.\n\n88\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.590\nAnd as you can see in that\nthird bullet point down there,\n\n89\n00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.340\nthe new upgraded components etc.\n\n90\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.449\nAnd legislative changes,\npersonnel changes, etc.\n\n91\n00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.830\nSo these all trigger changes,\nand we're all subject to them.\n\n92\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.680\nAnd it doesn't matter what\nthe strategy of the organization is,\n\n93\n00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.835\nwe all still need to change, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:09.835 --> 00:05:13.190\nAnd IT operation staff,\nwe are conducting that business as usual.\n\n95\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.931\nAnd so we've got to be involved in it.\n\n96\n00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:19.499\nRight the way through from raising\na change to assessing the change and\n\n97\n00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:23.785\nevaluating it technically\nthrough to building that change.\n\n98\n00:05:23.785 --> 00:05:26.545\nTesting it, and deploying it\ninto the live environment, and\n\n99\n00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:29.445\nthen running it, and\ncontinuing to improve it.\n\n100\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.720\nSo, let's take a look, then,\nat one of our next challenges and\n\n101\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.140\nour implementation considerations,\nas well.\n\n102\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.770\nQuite often, and I hear it all the time.\n\n103\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.100\nThere is that divide between\nproject management and operations.\n\n104\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.490\nDivide between project management and\nbusiness as usual.\n\n105\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.376\nAnd you hear quite often the term,\nthrowing it over the fence.\n\n106\n00:05:56.376 --> 00:06:00.550\nBecause that's what project management\nis perceived to do with new services.\n\n107\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.710\nThey throw it over the fence\nto operations, and\n\n108\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.380\nyou know operations team,\nthen pick it up, and run with it.\n\n109\n00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.250\nWell, we don't like that,\nand we never have.\n\n110\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.071\nAnd way back, since ITIL started,\nway back in the 1980's,\n\n111\n00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:17.442\nwe never really liked that separation.\n\n112\n00:06:17.442 --> 00:06:19.101\nAnd in ITIL version two,\n\n113\n00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:23.500\nwe introduced the concept of\nwhat we call early life support.\n\n114\n00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.360\nThat ensured transition between, and\n\n115\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.047\na smooth transition between projects and\nservice operations.\n\n116\n00:06:31.047 --> 00:06:36.192\nAnd we introduced a handholding\nperiod during that time,\n\n117\n00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:42.020\nto allow service operations to\nrely on project management.\n\n118\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.980\nAnd to impart all of their wisdom,\nand their experience,\n\n119\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.610\nso that when Service Operations took\nover the support of any new service,\n\n120\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.970\nwe could support with confidence.\n\n121\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.560\nWell, now we take a look at things like\nDevOps and DevOps is a movement, that\n\n122\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.110\nhas come along, which is really expanded\non the early life support concept.\n\n123\n00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.280\nNow, DevOps doesn't,\nthis is not a separate entity.\n\n124\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.770\nI mean sure, we've got quite a lot of\ntools that have come along with DevOps.\n\n125\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.881\nAnd some automation,\nwhich has looked more at efficiency,\n\n126\n00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:15.760\nwhich really just underpins\neverything that we stand for at ITIL.\n\n127\n00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.490\nAnd DevOps doesn't replace project\nmanagement or ITIL at all.\n\n128\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.106\nIt looks at evening out that gap hole,\nmaybe,\n\n129\n00:07:23.106 --> 00:07:28.323\ncrashing down that fence, really,\nthat exists between the two.\n\n130\n00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:33.640\nIn a more formal way,\nthan we do with early life support.\n\n131\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.410\nWhat we've got to understand is that we\nneed to have synergy between the two.\n\n132\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.170\nWe can't, in Service Operation,\n\n133\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.900\njust pick up a project after\nit has been thrown over to us.\n\n134\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.485\nWe don't provide very good support.\n\n135\n00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:48.911\nAnd when we look at aspects like\nthe emotional cycle of change and\n\n136\n00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:50.950\norganizational change management.\n\n137\n00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.544\nIt's bad enough for\nthe users when they've got change.\n\n138\n00:07:55.544 --> 00:07:59.111\nWithout, when they call the service desk,\nand when they call support teams,\n\n139\n00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:02.693\nwithout them getting that response of\nwell, I don't know anything about it.\n\n140\n00:08:02.693 --> 00:08:06.992\nOr I don't know what to do with it,\nor this is the first I've seen of it.\n\n141\n00:08:06.992 --> 00:08:10.770\nSo DevOps and the early life\nsupport bringing that concept of\n\n142\n00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.697\ngetting operations guys involved\nin project management, and\n\n143\n00:08:14.697 --> 00:08:18.416\ngetting the project guys\ninvolved in support of services.\n\n144\n00:08:18.416 --> 00:08:22.806\nThis way, when the operations teams\nhave to support a service they know what\n\n145\n00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:27.010\nthey're supporting,\nbecause they know how it's being designed.\n\n146\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.439\nAnd I never ever wanna hear anybody\nin operations in to tell them and\n\n147\n00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:33.010\nsay, I don't know why\nthey did it like that,\n\n148\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.665\ncuz that's something that\nI've read before too.\n\n149\n00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:39.070\nBut then the project guy is\ngetting involved in the support.\n\n150\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.106\nSo now I never ever want to hear\na project guy turning round and\n\n151\n00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:46.917\nsay, it's okay support\nwill deal with that later.\n\n152\n00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:49.888\nBecause the responsibility is theirs, so\n\n153\n00:08:49.888 --> 00:08:54.921\nwe need to incorporate budget management\ninto service operations and as\n\n154\n00:08:54.921 --> 00:09:00.590\nmuch as we still like to try to maintain\nour silos we're gonna break them down.\n\n155\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.400\nWe're gonna break down\nthose barriers that exist.\n\n156\n00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.560\nThere are benefits to project management.\n\n157\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.350\nIf you're in an operational role,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n158\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.030\nproject management guys a good guys, okay.\n\n159\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.260\nAnd they're there to help us and\nthey will help us.\n\n160\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.510\nBut if you're in a project\nmanagement goal.\n\n161\n00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.970\nWell these operations guys,\nthey're good guys too.\n\n162\n00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.259\nThey can help you out, and\n\n163\n00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:24.963\nthey can really give you insights that\nyou've possibly never had before.\n\n164\n00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:29.697\nJust look at the benefits of\nthat synergy between the two in\n\n165\n00:09:29.697 --> 00:09:31.832\nthe last sections there.\n\n166\n00:09:31.832 --> 00:09:34.190\nWe can achieve that, if we work together.\n\n167\n00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.326\nSo what about risk assessment then?\n\n168\n00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:41.900\nRisk assessment is something that\nwe've looked at in previous sections.\n\n169\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.637\nIt's something that we look at more in\ndepth in our service strategy life cycle\n\n170\n00:09:46.637 --> 00:09:51.230\nphase and also we look at it during\nservice design as well in availability and\n\n171\n00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.417\nsecurity and service continuity.\n\n172\n00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:58.062\nAnd then we look at in transition and\nchange management too.\n\n173\n00:09:58.062 --> 00:10:02.860\nBut we're actually the people that\nperform availability management,\n\n174\n00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.900\nand security management,\nand evaluate changes.\n\n175\n00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.040\nSo we are performing the risk assessment.\n\n176\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.270\nAnd more important than that we're\nperforming the risk management.\n\n177\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.000\nCuz this is not just\nabout assessing risks.\n\n178\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.728\nAnd you'll see that there are lists in\nfront of you there of the different\n\n179\n00:10:19.728 --> 00:10:21.634\ntypes of things that we will assess.\n\n180\n00:10:21.634 --> 00:10:25.393\nBut we don't just want to assess,\nwe want to manage risk,\n\n181\n00:10:25.393 --> 00:10:30.230\nwhich means that when we've identified\na risk, we're going to assess for\n\n182\n00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.323\nits vulnerability, as we call it or\nyou might want to call it its probability.\n\n183\n00:10:35.323 --> 00:10:39.480\nWhat is the likelihood\nof that risk occurring.\n\n184\n00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.830\nAnd then we make a decision as to what\nwe're going to do with that risk,\n\n185\n00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.990\nwhether we're going to\nmitigate against the risk,\n\n186\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.410\nin other words try and\nprevent it from happening.\n\n187\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.820\nOr whether we're going to mitigate against\nthe effects of the risk, so not try and\n\n188\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.460\nprevent but try to prevent the impact\nwhen something does happen.\n\n189\n00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.031\nOr maybe we want to accept the risk.\n\n190\n00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:02.820\nWe know that it's there, but\nit's okay we can deal with that.\n\n191\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.970\nOr we might wanna share or\ntransfer the risk to somebody else.\n\n192\n00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.100\nRisk management is important.\n\n193\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.259\nWe can't just ignore it, and\nit happens within, as I've already said.\n\n194\n00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:18.202\nChange management, availability\nmanagement, security management too, and\n\n195\n00:11:18.202 --> 00:11:20.870\nalso service continuity management.\n\n196\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.099\nSo we need to ensure that when we're\ninvolved in those processes that we\n\n197\n00:11:25.099 --> 00:11:26.087\nidentify risk.\n\n198\n00:11:26.087 --> 00:11:30.231\nProblem management, when they work hand\nin hand with availability management,\n\n199\n00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.102\nare identifying points of failure.\n\n200\n00:11:32.102 --> 00:11:36.374\nThey're identifying potential root causes\nand then making decisions as to what\n\n201\n00:11:36.374 --> 00:11:39.513\nthey're going to do about that\nroot cause cuz ultimately,\n\n202\n00:11:39.513 --> 00:11:42.580\nwe wanna prevent incidents from happening.\n\n203\n00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.500\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo,\n\n204\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.370\nas you are talking about the idea here\nof risk assessment and doing that,\n\n205\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.380\nit brings me back to some of my project\nmanagement understanding a little bit.\n\n206\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.520\nAnd this is not a challenge to\nthe way that ITIL is saying it.\n\n207\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.610\nBut in its fit and service operation in\nthe way that we've been defining it as\n\n208\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.900\nkeeping business, or\nthe day to day things or\n\n209\n00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.750\nthe activities that we do to keep\nbusiness running and to provide for us.\n\n210\n00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.030\nNormally, when I think about risk,\n\n211\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.940\nwe're trying to assess it before even\nthe day to day operations come in.\n\n212\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.110\nBut here you're saying it should\neven extend through to day to\n\n213\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.630\nday operations now, right?\n\n214\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.719\n&gt;&gt; Well let's look at the DevOps concept.\n\n215\n00:12:22.719 --> 00:12:27.797\nWe want o get our operations guys\ninvolved in project management.\n\n216\n00:12:27.797 --> 00:12:32.849\nThere shouldn't be that very clear\nbarrier that there is quite often.\n\n217\n00:12:32.849 --> 00:12:37.148\nSo yes operation guys needs to\nbe involved in risk assessment.\n\n218\n00:12:37.148 --> 00:12:41.793\nBut then also let's think about the fact\nthat who is it that's got all of that\n\n219\n00:12:41.793 --> 00:12:42.737\nexperience and\n\n220\n00:12:42.737 --> 00:12:48.230\nall of that breadth of knowledge as to\nhow our infrastructure work right now?\n\n221\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.134\nIt's our operations guys, right.\n\n222\n00:12:50.134 --> 00:12:54.556\nSo, they know more than anybody\nelse what the probability or\n\n223\n00:12:54.556 --> 00:12:59.520\nthe likelihood is of a risk\nhappening in this environment.\n\n224\n00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.046\nSurprise will help project management\nteams by identifying potential risks and\n\n225\n00:13:04.046 --> 00:13:05.317\nsaying, hey, look.\n\n226\n00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:08.146\nThis is what we've experienced and\n\n227\n00:13:08.146 --> 00:13:13.723\nwhat we've seen in previous organizations,\nor in current clients.\n\n228\n00:13:13.723 --> 00:13:18.840\nBut suppliers don't know our\ninfrastructure the way that our guides do.\n\n229\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.508\nSo yeah, we've gotta get\noperations teams involved in this.\n\n230\n00:13:23.508 --> 00:13:28.448\nIt saddens me, and I do come across it,\nand it saddens me when the operations will\n\n231\n00:13:28.448 --> 00:13:32.607\nsometimes can feel a little bit\ndiminished in some organizations.\n\n232\n00:13:32.607 --> 00:13:37.330\nAnd operations guys feel as though\ntheir opinions which are not\n\n233\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.627\njust based on I think so\nbut based on facts and\n\n234\n00:13:40.627 --> 00:13:45.190\nevidence, when they feel that\ntheir opinions are unheard.\n\n235\n00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.593\nBecause the project team have\nliaise with the suppliers, and\n\n236\n00:13:48.593 --> 00:13:52.370\nthe suppliers have assured us\nthat this is never gonna happen.\n\n237\n00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.395\nAnd therefore, we're not going\nto mitigate against that risk.\n\n238\n00:13:56.395 --> 00:14:01.050\nWell, it's our operations guys that\nknow that it probably will happen.\n\n239\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.410\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense.\n\n240\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.070\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, we definitely gotta get\n\n241\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.350\noperations team involved with project\nmanagement, and with risk management.\n\n242\n00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.320\nAnd in fact this next\nslide just says absolutely\n\n243\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.240\neverything that I've already talked about.\n\n244\n00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.710\nWhen we've talked about DevOps, and\nwe've talked about risk management there.\n\n245\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:26.195\nLook at everything else on this particular\nslide unexpected operational costs.\n\n246\n00:14:26.195 --> 00:14:30.900\nIf we don't know how to\nsupport a new service,\n\n247\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:36.330\nthen it's gonna result in\nincreased cost for us.\n\n248\n00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.977\nCuz invariably what happens?\n\n249\n00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:43.285\nIf there's no DevOps mentality,\nif there is no smooth transition\n\n250\n00:14:43.285 --> 00:14:47.945\nbetween project management and\noperations management.\n\n251\n00:14:47.945 --> 00:14:52.307\nThen what happens is that\nthe project guys will rely on other\n\n252\n00:14:52.307 --> 00:14:54.848\ninformation like suppliers etc.\n\n253\n00:14:54.848 --> 00:14:58.452\nAnd they transition like service\ninto the live environment, and\n\n254\n00:14:58.452 --> 00:15:03.368\nif our guys don't know what they're doing\nin operation, they've never been trained,\n\n255\n00:15:03.368 --> 00:15:05.814\nthey've never been show this new service.\n\n256\n00:15:05.814 --> 00:15:09.295\nWell, just think about how long it's\ngoing to take to resolve an incident?\n\n257\n00:15:09.295 --> 00:15:13.640\nHow long it's going to take to resolve\nthe issue of a backup that has failed?\n\n258\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.740\nBecause they simply haven't been\ntold what to do about that backup.\n\n259\n00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.470\nThat results in phone calls.\n\n260\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.035\nIt results in additional\nsupport calls to suppliers.\n\n261\n00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:27.340\nIt results in a lot of extra time\ntaken to resolve an incident.\n\n262\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.140\nAnd it may even result in a lot of\nthings being undertaken that don't need\n\n263\n00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.146\nto be undertaken.\n\n264\n00:15:32.146 --> 00:15:36.372\nI mean, I've seen lots of hardware swapped\nout that didn't need to be swapped out,\n\n265\n00:15:36.372 --> 00:15:39.900\nbut because it was the only thing they\ncould think of doing at the time.\n\n266\n00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.971\nSo, get us involved,\noperations guys really need to be involved\n\n267\n00:15:45.971 --> 00:15:50.335\nin every single process\nthroughout the lifecycle phase.\n\n268\n00:15:50.335 --> 00:15:54.975\nBecause, if we can right the way back\nat the evaluation of a service if\n\n269\n00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:59.623\nwe can add some valuable input from\nservice operation that will say.\n\n270\n00:15:59.623 --> 00:16:03.488\nYou know what this looks like a great\nidea for a service and I really love it.\n\n271\n00:16:03.488 --> 00:16:07.534\nBut It's not gonna work\non our infrastructure.\n\n272\n00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:11.560\nI think of one large\ninternational corporation that I\n\n273\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.329\nassisted with ISO 20,000 accreditation.\n\n274\n00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:19.608\nAnd one of the things that they\nwanted to do before they write for\n\n275\n00:16:19.608 --> 00:16:25.749\nus our 20,000 accreditations, they wanted\nto change their entire infrastructure\n\n276\n00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:30.497\nfrom a Windows based infrastructure\nto a Mac based infrastructure.\n\n277\n00:16:30.497 --> 00:16:35.480\nNow, it was imperative, which was one\nof the reasons that it helped them\n\n278\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.440\nachieve ISO-20,000, in fairness,\n\n279\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.030\nbecause it was imperative that operations\nwere involved in that project.\n\n280\n00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.350\nBecause you're changing the way\nthe entire infrastructure worked.\n\n281\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:50.020\nThink about all the changes in experience\nand in skills etc, that were needed.\n\n282\n00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.970\nAnd yes, they had as we've got here\nlegal and contract obligations, and\n\n283\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.820\nthird party suppliers already in place,\nthat they were changing.\n\n284\n00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.900\nBut without operations involvement\nright at the start of that project,\n\n285\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.160\nthat project would have\nbeen a complete failure.\n\n286\n00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.210\nAnd to perfectly honest, if they didn't\nhave those relationships in place,\n\n287\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.860\nthen they'd never have\nachieved also 20,000 anyway.\n\n288\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.090\nBut that project would've\nbeen a complete failure.\n\n289\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.830\nThere would've been complete and\nutter chaos.\n\n290\n00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.440\nAnd that organization could not\nafford to have any downtime.\n\n291\n00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.490\nSo, this was a risky project.\n\n292\n00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:25.750\nA very, very risky project.\n\n293\n00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.390\nSo, when we're implementing\nthen service management.\n\n294\n00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:36.040\nWhen we're implementing service operation\nand ITIL, what do we need to think about?\n\n295\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.680\nWell, there's mention there of licenses,\n\n296\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.320\nwith any new service you've\ngot to think about licenses.\n\n297\n00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.160\nBut don't think about just licenses for\nthe service.\n\n298\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.270\nThat's our biggest mistake.\n\n299\n00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.005\nIf we're bringing in a tool to\nsupport service management,\n\n300\n00:17:50.005 --> 00:17:53.970\n[LAUGH] then it's going to need licensing,\nand you've got to think about\n\n301\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:59.100\nthe number of people that you've got, but\nnot just the number of people within IT.\n\n302\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.580\nIf you've got a web based access for\nyour users and\n\n303\n00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.870\nyour customers, maybe it's even something\nlike a mobile based now a days.\n\n304\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.750\nIf you got access like that, then you\ncould have to have licenses for it.\n\n305\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:16.370\nWhether they're dedicated licenses,\nor whether they're on demand licenses\n\n306\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.150\ndoesn't matter,\nyou have to consider through, okay.\n\n307\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.330\nAnd then, all of the obvious\nwhen you think about this.\n\n308\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.878\nWhen you're deploying any tool\nwithin service management, and\n\n309\n00:18:24.878 --> 00:18:26.885\nwhen you're deploying any server.\n\n310\n00:18:26.885 --> 00:18:30.159\nTo be honest, you've got to think\nabout have I got enough capacity?\n\n311\n00:18:30.159 --> 00:18:34.305\nYou know, one of the biggest mistakes\nis not considering capacity.\n\n312\n00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:38.770\nYou know, a tool that's going to monitor\ncapacity usage message on the network.\n\n313\n00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:39.990\nGuess what?\n\n314\n00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.610\nIt's going to take up capacity.\n\n315\n00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.150\nYeah, if you're monitoring bandwidth,\n\n316\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.730\nyou're going to use bandwidth\nby monitoring bandwidth.\n\n317\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.670\nSo, think about this.\n\n318\n00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.110\nWhen you bring in any tools, and\n\n319\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.710\nthink about with service management tools,\nincident management tools, etc,\n\n320\n00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.920\nthat we've talked about in previous\nepisodes, just think about the data.\n\n321\n00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.775\nWe plan for the data, yeah,\nin the first year, or so, but then,\n\n322\n00:19:08.775 --> 00:19:13.164\nwe don't necessarily plan for\nhow much data is going to be kept.\n\n323\n00:19:13.164 --> 00:19:15.400\nAnd what about migration of data?\n\n324\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.970\nKnowledge management is a huge big thing,\nand\n\n325\n00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.240\nwe always want to be adding to knowledge.\n\n326\n00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.510\nBut what if we start bringing knowledge\nin from external sources, and\n\n327\n00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.530\nwe find that we don't\nhave enough capacity?\n\n328\n00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.850\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n329\n00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:28.880\nWe need to do something.\n\n330\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.240\nSo, think also about bringing in tools\n\n331\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.870\nthat have the relevant amount of,\nhow would I say this?\n\n332\n00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:38.750\nUsability, yeah.\n\n333\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.790\nWe want to be able to\ngive everybody training.\n\n334\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.900\nBut if you're going to release a new\ntool across the organization for\n\n335\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.330\nincident management,\nthen think about your end users too,\n\n336\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.790\nbecause they need to be able to use it.\n\n337\n00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.850\nThey need to be able to\naccess the service catalog.\n\n338\n00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:58.490\nThey need to be able to access incident\nmanagement and raise requests.\n\n339\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.510\nAnd if they're going to do that on an app,\nor if they're going to do that via\n\n340\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.680\nthe Internet, it doesn't really\nmatter how they're going to do it.\n\n341\n00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.550\nThe fact is,\nyou're gonna have to tell them how.\n\n342\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.090\nAnd we discuss in a previous session\n\n343\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.110\nthe nuances of just\nthe English language alone.\n\n344\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.940\nSo, if you're going to try and\ntrain somebody using just a document,\n\n345\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.110\nyou have to accept that\ndocument may not be understood.\n\n346\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.654\nAnd so, you're still gonna get calls to\nthe service desk of how do I do this,\n\n347\n00:20:27.654 --> 00:20:30.707\neven documentation that's clear,\nconcise, and\n\n348\n00:20:30.707 --> 00:20:34.754\nunambiguous still is not necessarily\nunambiguous the whole time.\n\n349\n00:20:34.754 --> 00:20:39.240\nSo, then think about also how you're\ngoing to deploy any new tool.\n\n350\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.480\nThere's no mention on this particular\nslide, but I want you to also think about\n\n351\n00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.000\nmigration of data as well, because you've\nprobably already got a tool in place.\n\n352\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.050\nNow, whether that is just use\nin an Excel spreadsheet, or\n\n353\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:57.220\nwhether it is Word document, or\nwhether it's a shared driveway,\n\n354\n00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.630\nyou keep lots of individual\npieces of information.\n\n355\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.410\nYou are still going to\nneed to migrate that data.\n\n356\n00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.300\nSo, that should be a consideration.\n\n357\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.140\nWe looked in a previous\nline of tool selection.\n\n358\n00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.580\nMigration of data should be\na consideration in selecting that tool.\n\n359\n00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.370\nSo, that tells me then that\nwe've got some challenges\n\n360\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.680\nwhen it comes to implementing\nservice operation.\n\n361\n00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.915\nWhat is that we've got to overcome\nbefore we implement service operation.\n\n362\n00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:28.455\nI've already mentioned about development,\nand project staff and operations.\n\n363\n00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:30.765\nAnd I'm not gonna talk\nany more about that,\n\n364\n00:21:30.765 --> 00:21:35.045\ncuz you've heard the word dev\nops too many times now, okay?\n\n365\n00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:35.917\nThink about money though.\n\n366\n00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:40.577\nAnd a new tool, and\nany training that we give anybody,\n\n367\n00:21:40.577 --> 00:21:45.067\nit's going to cost some money, so we\nhave to have the right justification for\n\n368\n00:21:45.067 --> 00:21:50.100\nthat expenditure, but we also have to\nsee a return on that expenditure too.\n\n369\n00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.990\nSo, even when we bring a new tool in\nwe're expecting a tool to facilitate\n\n370\n00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.770\nour efficiency and\nour effectiveness, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:02.000\nAnd just remember that we're not just\ntalking about individual services.\n\n372\n00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.960\nEvery tool must support\nall of our services.\n\n373\n00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.500\nAn incident management tool has got\nto support all of our services.\n\n374\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.720\nAn event management tool has\ngot extract information,\n\n375\n00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.660\nand has got to monitor\nall of our services.\n\n376\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.660\nSo, it's got to have\nthe ability to do that.\n\n377\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.010\nYou don't want to bring in a tool that's\nonly gonna do 50% of the work that\n\n378\n00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.680\nyou need.\n\n379\n00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.900\nThink about the fact that, you know,\nI hate to say to this, but\n\n380\n00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.436\nlet's face it's true, okay.\n\n381\n00:22:31.436 --> 00:22:38.420\nA service operation stuff, then once\nthe carry become when development stuff\n\n382\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.240\ndon't deliver exactly what\ncustomers think they should see.\n\n383\n00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.110\nWhich is another reason why, I said, I\nwouldn't mention dev ops again, didn't I?\n\n384\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.360\nBut I'm gonna mention it, okay.\n\n385\n00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.725\nIt's another reason why dev ops is really,\nreally important, you see,\n\n386\n00:22:52.725 --> 00:22:55.339\nbecause it really does\nencourage that culture.\n\n387\n00:22:55.339 --> 00:22:59.204\nIf customer expectations\nhaven't been set correctly, or\n\n388\n00:22:59.204 --> 00:23:04.860\nmaybe they've got a different expectation\nof what they're likely to receive.\n\n389\n00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.641\nThen it's service operations\nguys that have to deal with it.\n\n390\n00:23:08.641 --> 00:23:11.340\nThey're the ones that have to\ndeal with the angry phone calls.\n\n391\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.740\nThey're the ones that have to deal\nwith the disappointment, etc.\n\n392\n00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:19.630\nSo, we really have to ensure that there\nis that the synergy between them,\n\n393\n00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.460\nand that we use service transition,\nand we use release, and\n\n394\n00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.710\ndeployment to actually\nmigrate that service.\n\n395\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.730\nWe have something, when we look in\nthe arts of partitioner on gardens,\n\n396\n00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.040\nwe have something called\nthe inflated peak of expectation.\n\n397\n00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:40.040\nAnd this is what happens when\nyou misset expectations.\n\n398\n00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.047\nNow, I know a company\nout in the real world,\n\n399\n00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:47.762\nan organization out in the real world,\nit's really, really good at\n\n400\n00:23:47.762 --> 00:23:52.828\nsetting customer expectations,\nreally fantastic at marketing, etc.\n\n401\n00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:57.422\nAnd I have to admit, when they first said,\nthat they were launching a particular\n\n402\n00:23:57.422 --> 00:24:01.613\npiece of hardware, a particular piece\nof equipment, I was so excited for\n\n403\n00:24:01.613 --> 00:24:06.235\nthis piece of equipment, I thought,\nit was going to be absolutely everything.\n\n404\n00:24:06.235 --> 00:24:07.061\nForming.\n\n405\n00:24:07.061 --> 00:24:10.630\nI really, really,\nreally wanted this piece of equipment, and\n\n406\n00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.860\nit was going to do,\nit was going to do wonders for me.\n\n407\n00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.200\nIt was going to read all of my texts for\nme.\n\n408\n00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:21.770\nIt was going to get me to the right place\nat the right time on my GPS tracker.\n\n409\n00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.402\nIt was going to make me tea\nin the morning when I got up.\n\n410\n00:24:24.402 --> 00:24:27.000\nIt was gonna do absolutely everything.\n\n411\n00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.620\nAnd then I got this piece of equipment and\n\n412\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.152\nsuddenly realized that at my\nage I'm too blind to see it.\n\n413\n00:24:32.152 --> 00:24:35.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And there we go.\n\n414\n00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.040\nMy inflated peak of expectation.\n\n415\n00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.650\nNow I've got used to it and\nI know that it will do really nice\n\n416\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:46.260\nnifty things like it opens my front door\nfor me before I even get to it, and it\n\n417\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:51.150\nallows me to see the cameras in my home,\nand yeah it does read my texts for me, but\n\n418\n00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.820\nI can't see them so there's no point,\nBut it will actually read them out loud.\n\n419\n00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.670\nAnd so you have this inflated\npeak of expectation and\n\n420\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:03.325\nthen straight away if things don't\nwork quite the way you need them to or\n\n421\n00:25:03.325 --> 00:25:07.010\nyou're expected, and as a customer,\nyou're disappointed.\n\n422\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:11.400\nAnd it's the service operations guys that\ninvariably have to pick up the pieces\n\n423\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.800\nwhen that happens, which is why we need\nto get these operations guys involved in\n\n424\n00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.160\nthe project, so\nthat that doesn't happen, okay.\n\n425\n00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.310\nSo what do we have to achieve\nthen in service operation?\n\n426\n00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:30.540\nWe like the use of the term\nSenior Management Buy-in.\n\n427\n00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.788\nBut it's not just a one-off thing.\n\n428\n00:25:32.788 --> 00:25:37.437\nYour senior management have\nto be there to support you.\n\n429\n00:25:37.437 --> 00:25:40.908\nYour senior management\nhave to be a figurehead.\n\n430\n00:25:40.908 --> 00:25:45.173\nBut not only that, they have to be\na driver throughout all of any project and\n\n431\n00:25:45.173 --> 00:25:47.800\nthroughout service operations.\n\n432\n00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.350\nI mean, I don't know about you,\nRonnie, but\n\n433\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.630\nhave you ever worked with a manager\nthat you never could really trust, or\n\n434\n00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.700\nyou never felt would back\nyou up on your decisions?\n\n435\n00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.565\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I should answer that,\nno I'm joking.\n\n436\n00:25:59.565 --> 00:26:00.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There are times when\n\n437\n00:26:00.731 --> 00:26:02.840\nthat has happened of course.\n\n438\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.350\nAnd you just kind of do the best that\nyou can when that doesn't happen.\n\n439\n00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really, really difficult.\n\n440\n00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.480\nI mean morale is in a service\noperation environment,\n\n441\n00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.700\nwe've already discussed that quite often\nthings like service desk you're dealing\n\n442\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.220\nwith negative interactions for\nthe majority of your day.\n\n443\n00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:25.180\nAnd so it's very, very important that\nyou have management to back you up.\n\n444\n00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.270\nNow, what can typically happen\nwithin an IT environment especially\n\n445\n00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:34.340\na fast-paced IT environment that's very,\nvery large in global organizations.\n\n446\n00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.470\nIs that we get management involvement\nat the start of any project.\n\n447\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.700\nAnd then it just kind of disappears.\n\n448\n00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:45.370\nAnd morale becomes very, very low\nespecially in the operations teams.\n\n449\n00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.040\nSo they don't feel as though\nmanagement really support them.\n\n450\n00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.180\nAnd it might not be the case and I know\nI asked you a loaded question just then.\n\n451\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.150\nBut it might not be the case that\nmanagement don't support them or\n\n452\n00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.580\nthey don't feel that management\nis going to support them.\n\n453\n00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.538\nThat's more important.\n\n454\n00:27:00.538 --> 00:27:01.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n455\n00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.000\nmanagement probably will support them,\nbut they don't feel it.\n\n456\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.150\nWhich is why we talk about\nsenior management support, but\n\n457\n00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.777\nwe talk about visible,\nongoing support, okay.\n\n458\n00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.310\nIt's not just a one-off thing.\n\n459\n00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.690\nIt has to be ongoing, and\nit has to be visible.\n\n460\n00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.840\nSome of the best methods of\ncommunication that I have ever seen\n\n461\n00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.780\nare when we have CIOs or\nCTOs that have done sort of town halls,\n\n462\n00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.970\nat the same time every\nweek across the globe.\n\n463\n00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:33.390\nAnd everyone in IT is sort of expected or\n\n464\n00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.960\nencouraged to come to the break room, so\njust see what the manager's got to say.\n\n465\n00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.890\nSee what the CIO has got to say, and then\nthey're given a forum to feed it back to.\n\n466\n00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:50.360\nSome of the most efficient and effective\nteams work with Senior Management Support.\n\n467\n00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.610\nIf I look at Business Support and\n\n468\n00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:57.950\nChampions, we can bring that\ninto exactly the same mold.\n\n469\n00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.810\nWe need to have that support and\n\n470\n00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.130\nwe need to have people that\nare singing our praises.\n\n471\n00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.240\nI said in a previous section,\n\n472\n00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.460\nwe're not really very good in IT at\nselling ourselves and marketing ourselves.\n\n473\n00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.640\nWe kinda just get on and do the work and\n\n474\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.410\nwe don't really think anything\nmore about promoting ourselves.\n\n475\n00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.780\nBut this is how we end up with low morale.\n\n476\n00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.050\nIf we don't feel appreciated\nthen morale dies.\n\n477\n00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.450\nAnd then you start looking at\nretention of staff et cetera.\n\n478\n00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.880\nAnd we already discussed\nin a previous section,\n\n479\n00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.340\nI don't expect service desk staff to\nhang around for more than two years.\n\n480\n00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Before they're looking to move\n\n481\n00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.970\non, okay?\n\n482\n00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.190\nService desk staff, if they're really\nvalued, will be looking to move\n\n483\n00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:43.670\non in two years, but will have given 110%\nwhile they were on the service desk.\n\n484\n00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.680\nSo give them the right tools\nto help them do their job, and\n\n485\n00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.440\nmake sure that before any service is\nimplemented into the live environment,\n\n486\n00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.840\nwell it's tested quite obviously.\n\n487\n00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.350\nAnd then the last bullet point on here,\n\n488\n00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:04.780\nor the last point on here under\nthe CSS are the reporting CSS.\n\n489\n00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.680\nAnd you've gotta make sure that\nyou know what you're doing.\n\n490\n00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.690\nAnd as I said and with previous session,\n\n491\n00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:17.290\nbecause I think so\nis just not a good enough measure.\n\n492\n00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:18.810\nSo very similar to the challenges.\n\n493\n00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.170\nThe challenges are gonna prevent\nus from achieving efficient and\n\n494\n00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.410\neffective service operation.\n\n495\n00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.420\nWhat's going to cause us to fail?\n\n496\n00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.110\nWell look,\nthey look pretty much the same thing.\n\n497\n00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.260\nLoss of funding, loss of momentum.\n\n498\n00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.210\nRemember what I said about morale,\nyeah and\n\n499\n00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.370\nservice management perceived as no value.\n\n500\n00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.460\nThat mismatch costs more\nexpectations that I just mentioned\n\n501\n00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.190\ncuz I was expecting a cup of tea every\nmorning and it didn't happen right, okay.\n\n502\n00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:48.440\nBut then think about\nresistance to change and\n\n503\n00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.400\nwhen we talk about low morale,\nloss of key personnel.\n\n504\n00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.650\nSometimes people will leave\nif they don't feel valued.\n\n505\n00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.620\nSometimes people will leave for\nmany other reasons.\n\n506\n00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:03.310\nBut if they don't feel valued,\nthen they're more likely to be looking for\n\n507\n00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.490\nsomething else.\n\n508\n00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.210\nOkay?\n\n509\n00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:06.740\nPeople are important.\n\n510\n00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.410\nAnd people are very,\nvery important in service operation.\n\n511\n00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:13.790\nAnd it's the people that will actually\ndetermine whether we succeed or\n\n512\n00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.110\nwhether we fail in service operation.\n\n513\n00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.480\nSo we have to value them, too.\n\n514\n00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:22.620\n&gt;&gt; Jo, it sounds like finding\nthe right people to really be\n\n515\n00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.840\nahead or in charge of getting\nthe service operation implementation\n\n516\n00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.860\nis very critical in what we do.\n\n517\n00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.170\nThey seem to help us to be\nable to overcome some of those\n\n518\n00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.040\nchallenges that we've just talked about.\n\n519\n00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.140\nAt the same time,\nthey might have the knowledge that we\n\n520\n00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.940\nneed to ensure that we get\nthe right things in place as well.\n\n521\n00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.650\nSo, how critical is it that you\ndo have that right person or\n\n522\n00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.110\nthat right team in place to try and\nimplement this?\n\n523\n00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:55.840\n&gt;&gt; It's very critical that we get people\nwith the right, how do I say this?\n\n524\n00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.420\nI was gonna say the right attitude and\n\n525\n00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.685\nI think that that is definitely\nthe right word to use.\n\n526\n00:31:00.685 --> 00:31:02.105\nWe need people that are willing to learn.\n\n527\n00:31:02.105 --> 00:31:04.105\nWe need people with a technical bias.\n\n528\n00:31:04.105 --> 00:31:06.355\nBut we need customer focused people.\n\n529\n00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:11.315\nAnd we need people that always, always\nhave it at the foremost of their mind that\n\n530\n00:31:11.315 --> 00:31:16.177\nthey are delivering value to our business,\nbecause ultimately,\n\n531\n00:31:16.177 --> 00:31:18.887\nthat's exactly what we've got to achieve.\n\n532\n00:31:18.887 --> 00:31:22.687\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Jo again for helping us\nas we get started here, as we talk about\n\n533\n00:31:22.687 --> 00:31:26.637\nthe implementation of service\noperation and the challenges, as well.\n\n534\n00:31:26.637 --> 00:31:28.447\nJo, any last words here?\n\n535\n00:31:28.447 --> 00:31:31.807\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd like to invite everybody\nto go back to our materials.\n\n536\n00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:37.247\nWe have some exercises there for you, just\ngoing over the challenges and the risks,\n\n537\n00:31:37.247 --> 00:31:43.320\nand the critical success factors for\nthe implementation of service operation.\n\n538\n00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.360\nSo this should take around about an hour\nto an hour and a half for you to complete,\n\n539\n00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.640\nand please feel free.\n\n540\n00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.730\nAny questions that you may have,\ncontact us via the forum, and I or\n\n541\n00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:57.040\none of my colleagues is going\nto be ever so happy to help

--> 00:32:03.790\nMake sure, of course,\nyou do that assignment as well.\n\n545\n00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:07.370\nAnd that means that this is a great\nplace for us to end this episode.\n\n546\n00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.930\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n547\n00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:11.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n548\n00:32:11.960 -->

gotten to this point,\n\n16\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.630\nthey now need to really\nfocus in on the exam.\n\n17\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.960\nLearning the material of\ncourse is foremost and key.\n\n18\n00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.860\nBut getting ready for\nthe exam is a big part of this as well.\n\n19\n00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.430\nSo where are we gonna begin?\n\n20\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.440\n&gt;&gt; So yes, you're right.\n\n21\n00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.610\nWe've completed a class,\ncongratulations everybody.\n\n22\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.230\nYou've put in the prerequisite\n21 hours worth of contact time\n\n23\n00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.130\nas we say in the course syllabus with\nboth me, an accredited instructor.\n\n24\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.070\nAnd also by going through the materials\nthat you've been given and\n\n25\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.790\nprovided with you course materials.\n\n26\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.696\nSo now it's time for the exam.\n\n27\n00:01:26.696 --> 00:01:30.180\nI don't know Ronnie, that's a dreaded\nwords for some people, right?\n\n28\n00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n29\n00:01:30.780

worry.\n\n36\n00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.710\nNow's the time actually to relax because\nyou've done all of your learning.\n\n37\n00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.330\nOkay, so the first thing that I want\nyou to do is, I want you to go away and\n\n38\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.030\nto ensure that you have\ndownloaded the sample papers.\n\n39\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.672\nThat were given to you as\npart of the course materials.\n\n40\n00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:09.096\nNow, if you didn't received them\nas part of the course materials or\n\n41\n00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:14.623\nyou feel that you might want to check out\nthe AXELOS website which obviously AXELOS.\n\n42\n00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:17.886\nSo that the people that own ITIL now,\n\n43\n00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:23.825\nthen please feel free to go to\ntheir website at www.axelos.org.\n\n44\n00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:27.985\nAnd if type in the search there,\nITIL intermediate, and\n\n45\n00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:31.719\nyou can download a sample\npaper from that website.\n\n46\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.010\nSo what we're going to do\nover the next few moments is,\n\n47\n00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.680\nI'm going you through some exam technique.\n\n48\n00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.700\nAnd then I'm going to ask you to go\naway and attempt sample paper one.\n\n49\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.440\nOnce you've complete sample paper one,\nthen I'm gonna go over it with you.\n\n50\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.760\nI'm gonna make sure that you have picked\nout all of the salient points and all of\n\n51\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.880\nthe relevant points and everything that\nyou need in order to get the right answer.\n\n52\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.250\nYeah, talking about the right answer,\ntake a look at this slide, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.780\nThere is no right answer.\n\n54\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.820\nThere is no wrong answer.\n\n55\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.260\nWhat you've got is a best fit answer.\n\n56\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.162\nNow I know that way, way back at\nthe introduction to our class, I very,\n\n57\n00:03:14.162 --> 00:03:18.191\nvery briefly mentioned the exam\nat the end of this, okay.\n\n58\n00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:23.093\nAnd I said to you that it was complex\nmultiple choice exam, and they looked at,\n\n59\n00:03:23.093 --> 00:03:26.437\nI think the wording that we\nused right at the very start\n\n60\n00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:28.391\nof the class was most correct.\n\n61\n00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.260\nAnd I used the words best fit, and\nthat's what I like to use, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.880\nThe best fit answer is five points.\n\n63\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.502\nYour second best answer is three points,\nand\n\n64\n00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:40.560\nyour third best answer\nwill give you one point.\n\n65\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.560\nAnd then, we've got this\ndistractor that I mentioned.\n\n66\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.960\nAnd boy, is that there to distract.\n\n67\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.400\nThe distractor will quite often\nuse some nice, pretty words.\n\n68\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.316\nThe words that you find in your ITIL\npublications, and you think, gee, no,\n\n69\n00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.705\nthat sounds great, cuz it's mentioned\nall of these processes, and\n\n70\n00:03:56.705 --> 00:03:58.764\nit's mentioned all of these functions.\n\n71\n00:03:58.764 --> 00:04:00.640\nAnd it's mentioned all\nof these activities.\n\n72\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.370\nThat's gotta be the right answer, right?\n\n73\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.020\nNo, because the right answer,\n\n74\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.440\nthe best fit answer has got to be\ncompletely relevant to the scenario.\n\n75\n00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.120\nCompletely relevant.\n\n76\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.520\nSo sometimes, the best fit answer doesn't\nuse any of the ITIL wording at all.\n\n77\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.290\nSo be careful right, destructive.\n\n78\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.710\nIt's called a destructive for\na reason, all right?\n\n79\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.340\nSo the example, let me tell you\na little bit about it then.\n\n80\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.300\nYou get 90 minutes.\n\n81\n00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.560\nThat's an hour and\na half you get to complete this exam.\n\n82\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.320\nAnd you will begin with eight\nmultiple choice questions.\n\n83\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.080\nSo you get two booklets.\n\n84\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.397\nYou get a scenario booklet, and\nyou get a question booklet, okay.\n\n85\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.490\nNow, be very, very careful, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.290\nThe scenario booklet as it\nsays there sets the scene and\n\n87\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.510\nthe questions booklet asks the question,\nokay?\n\n88\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.610\nFairly straightforward, not really.\n\n89\n00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:59.325\nFirst thing that I want you to check\nwhen you see your question booklet is at\n\n90\n00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:04.955\nthe top of every single question, and\nboy is this important, don't forget this.\n\n91\n00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:11.035\nAt the top of every single question\nit says, refer to scenario x.\n\n92\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.270\nSometimes not all the time,\nnot in every paper.\n\n93\n00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.480\nAnd in fact, it's a rarity, I'll admit.\n\n94\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.760\nBut sometimes, you've got one scenario for\ntwo questions.\n\n95\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.670\nIn other words, two questions\nrefer to just that one scenario.\n\n96\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.910\nBest way to ascertain whether that's\nthe case in your particular exam\n\n97\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.370\nis scroll through to the end\nof the scenario booklet.\n\n98\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.200\nLook at the end of the scenario booklet,\nsee how many you've got.\n\n99\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.240\nIf you running on seven, then that means\nthat somewhere in your question booklet,\n\n100\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.128\nyou've got two questions for\none scenario this is not the norm,\n\n101\n00:05:48.128 --> 00:05:50.149\nit's not in every single paper.\n\n102\n00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.660\nBut it's one definitely worth\nwatching out for, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.770\nSo always look at them.\n\n104\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:00.674\nRight at the very, very top, take a look,\nsee what scenario it refers to, okay.\n\n105\n00:06:00.674 --> 00:06:05.266\nYou've got to get a total of 28\npoints out of 40 in order to\n\n106\n00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:09.750\npass the ITIL intermediate,\nthe life cycle phase.\n\n107\n00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.960\nOkay, so, think about this, okay.\n\n108\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.820\nYou can't get all threes, right?\n\n109\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.020\nThat's not going to work.\n\n110\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.860\nYou have to get some five pointers, okay.\n\n111\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.520\nObviously, what I'd like you to do\nis to get all five pointers, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.750\nAnd 40 out of 40, by the way,\nis not impossible.\n\n113\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.660\nIt really, really isn't impossible and\n\n114\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.548\nI have quite a few delegates [LAUGH]\nthat do actually achieve that, okay.\n\n115\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.160\nSo, what am I gonna ask you to do\nthen when it comes to this test?\n\n116\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.980\nWell, I've got an acronym for you and\n\n117\n00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.526\nit is not one I guess I am supposed to\ngive you, but I am gonna give you anyway.\n\n118\n00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:51.110\nR-T-F-Q, R-T-F-Q.\n\n119\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.457\nRonnie, do you have any\nidea what that means?\n\n120\n00:06:53.457 --> 00:06:54.798\n&gt;&gt; No I don't.\n\n121\n00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:55.441\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n122\n00:06:55.441 --> 00:06:57.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm pleased [LAUGH].\n\n123\n00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:01.451\nIt means read the full question.\n\n124\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.440\n&gt;&gt; Read the full question.\n\n125\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.890\nReally, really, really important.\n\n126\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.360\nThere is no one word in our\nquestions that is not relevant.\n\n127\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.940\nEvery single word is completely relevant.\n\n128\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.640\nIf you try and skim read, bear it in\nmind that this test is not a race okay,\n\n129\n00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.490\nyou're not gonna get any points for\nfinishing in 20 minutes.\n\n130\n00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.110\nOkay, you're not gonna get any prizes for\nthat.\n\n131\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.140\nAnd nobody's gonna recognize you for\n\n132\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.560\nbeing the fastest person\never to finish an ITIL test.\n\n133\n00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.960\nSo please don't try it, okay.\n\n134\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.880\nIt's not gonna get you anything\nadditional over your score.\n\n135\n00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.420\nRead the full question,\ntake the time to read the full question.\n\n136\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.310\nRead every single word.\n\n137\n00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.110\nAnd that applies to the scenario as well,\nread the scenario.\n\n138\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.260\nYou're looking for key words.\n\n139\n00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.890\nBut you're also looking for\nsmall words as well.\n\n140\n00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.289\nWords like all, and words like might,\nand could, and should, and must.\n\n141\n00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.040\nPlease, please,\n\n142\n00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.060\nplease pick out those words,\ncuz they are incredibly important, okay.\n\n143\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.980\nFirst thing that I want you\nto do is read the question.\n\n144\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.512\nThe question can generally be very,\n\n145\n00:08:12.512 --> 00:08:16.438\nvery small, and sometimes that question\ncan [LAUGH] simply turn around and say.\n\n146\n00:08:16.438 --> 00:08:20.732\nSo, given the scenario, what do you think\nis the best answer to resolve the issues\n\n147\n00:08:20.732 --> 00:08:25.170\nmentioned in the scenario, well that\nquestion tells you absolutely nothing.\n\n148\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.135\nSo you have to go then back\nto the scenario, okay.\n\n149\n00:08:29.135 --> 00:08:34.239\nAnd the example that you've given on\nthere is you've been asked by the CIO to\n\n150\n00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:40.180\nidentify the next steps to address\nthe identified issues well, guess what?\n\n151\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.010\nIf you've been asked for\nthe next steps, and this is why I say,\n\n152\n00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.600\nread the full question, cuz if you've\nbeen asked for the next steps, don't you\n\n153\n00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.850\ndare select the answer that goes over\neverything that you've already covered.\n\n154\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.430\nCuz they're asking you for the next steps.\n\n155\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.790\nIt also mentions, and\nit's been highlighted there again,\n\n156\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.840\nabout addressing the issues mentioned,\neither in the question or the scenario.\n\n157\n00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.305\nIf your answer doesn't address\nthe issues i.e, relevant,\n\n158\n00:09:03.305 --> 00:09:08.910\nif it's not relevant, then again you're\nnot gonna be on to that five point answer.\n\n159\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:14.390\nSo, read the full question,\nbe very, very careful, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.433\nIt says that as you read the scenario,\nhighlight,\n\n161\n00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:21.430\nunderline or\nwrite down the specific issues, well,\n\n162\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.647\nyou can only do that if you got\na paper exam in front of you.\n\n163\n00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:29.320\nYou cannot do that when you are online and\ndoing a virtual test.\n\n164\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.430\nYou will be allowed in your virtual test\nto have a piece of blank paper with you.\n\n165\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.210\nWhat I would recommend, and I was just\nthinking is if I had one here, and\n\n166\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.930\nI don't, unfortunately.\n\n167\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:48.130\nWhat I would recommend for you is to\nactually take one piece of blank paper and\n\n168\n00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.770\nfold it into quarters.\n\n169\n00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.560\nBy doing that you've divided up\nthe front page into four sections, and\n\n170\n00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.590\nyou've divided up the back\npage into four sections too.\n\n171\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.329\nYou'll be allowed to have that piece\nof paper and a pencil with you.\n\n172\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.990\nIn every single quarter,\n\n173\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.528\nI would write down the notes for\neach particular question, okay.\n\n174\n00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.240\nWhat that allows you to do is actually\nkeep your questions separate which is\n\n175\n00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.508\na huge start.\n\n176\n00:10:14.508 --> 00:10:18.110\nIf you just start writing down\nrandom words on a piece of paper,\n\n177\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.180\nyou'll not really know what\nquestion it refers to.\n\n178\n00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.730\nAnd if you have to go back to a question\nthen you'll really be in trouble okay?\n\n179\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.890\nSo take that piece of paper and\nliterally just fold it into four.\n\n180\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.970\nAnd then as you unfold it,\nyou've now got dividers four on each side.\n\n181\n00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.530\nAnd use one quarter for each question and\n\n182\n00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.457\nthen write down the specific words\nyou want to highlight, okay.\n\n183\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.410\nSo the third bullet point up there\ntalks about sticking to the facts and\n\n184\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.440\nwhat I will say to you is,\ndon't assume, please don't assume.\n\n185\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.690\nStick to what's in front of you,\nread the full question.\n\n186\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.050\nAnd don't read in between the lines okay,\nthere is nothing written there.\n\n187\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.020\nSo don't read in between the lines,\ndon't assume anything.\n\n188\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.570\nIf it's not down in black and white,\nthen it simply doesn't exist.\n\n189\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.370\nNow you've completed your class.\n\n190\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.690\nNow's the time when you follow this\nlink and you download your exam voucher.\n\n191\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.950\nWhat will happen is you'll\nbe given this voucher and\n\n192\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:23.020\nyou'll also be given an instruction\nbooklet or an instruction email, rather.\n\n193\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.082\nAnd you will be asked to go to\nthe website at peoplecert.org and\n\n194\n00:11:27.082 --> 00:11:31.922\nyou will be asked to register as a client,\nif you haven't already done so.\n\n195\n00:11:31.922 --> 00:11:34.500\nYou may already have a candidate login.\n\n196\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.548\nAnd then you select the option\nto register for an exam,\n\n197\n00:11:38.548 --> 00:11:43.000\nusing exam voucher.\n\n198\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.930\nLet me repeat that again, okay.\n\n199\n00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:51.837\nYou'll be asked to register for an exam\nusing an examination voucher, okay.\n\n200\n00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:56.613\nAnd then the voucher number that you've\nbeen given in your email from Passion IT\n\n201\n00:11:56.613 --> 00:12:00.020\nis the voucher number that you will use.\n\n202\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.290\nOnce you've input that, it's gonna\nask you for an appropriate date and\n\n203\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.480\ntime to sit your test.\n\n204\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.060\nYou can do it whatever time you like and\nso\n\n205\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.540\npick something that's appropriate for\nyou, okay.\n\n206\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.000\nSomething that you can work with.\n\n207\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.170\nThere are a few things that I wanna tell\nyou about this online exam as well, okay.\n\n208\n00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.780\nAnd the first thing is,\nplease make sure you can't be interrupted.\n\n209\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.440\nYou need to be in a room\nwhere it's only you,\n\n210\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.680\nand preferably where the door is closed.\n\n211\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.790\nYou will need to be using a laptop or\na tablet with a camera.\n\n212\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.280\nIf your laptop or your tablet or\nyour desktop does not have a camera,\n\n213\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.860\nthen you won't be able to sit your test.\n\n214\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.210\nBecause you will be watched by a proctor\nthroughout your entire test, okay.\n\n215\n00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.820\nYou can't use more than one screen.\n\n216\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.764\nYou can only use one screen, okay.\n\n217\n00:12:51.764 --> 00:12:56.429\nAnd you cannot at any point in time have\nany other [LAUGH] devices on your desk\n\n218\n00:12:56.429 --> 00:12:57.040\neither.\n\n219\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.180\nSo nothing that can connect\nto the Internet, okay.\n\n220\n00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.244\nYou will be asked when you register for\nyour test for\n\n221\n00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:11.151\nabout an hour before your test is due to\ndownload some exam god software, okay.\n\n222\n00:13:11.151 --> 00:13:14.667\nAnd what that does is that allows\nthe proctor to remotely watch what you\n\n223\n00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:17.467\nare doing on your laptop or\non your PC or on your device and\n\n224\n00:13:17.467 --> 00:13:21.306\nit makes sure that you're not on\nthe Internet Googling the answers, okay.\n\n225\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.130\nSo, we started our exam.\n\n226\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.320\nWe've downloaded all the software.\n\n227\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.250\nAnd by the way, when I mentioned that if\nyou're using a work PC you better make\n\n228\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.770\nsure you have the permissions in\norder to download that software.\n\n229\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.460\nIf the software is not on your PC then\nyou won't be able to sit the test.\n\n230\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.667\nOkay, so then the proctor will come\nonline, and they will ask you if you're\n\n231\n00:13:42.667 --> 00:13:46.899\nall ready, and they'll tell you that you\ncan have a piece of paper and a pen.\n\n232\n00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:50.349\nAnd then they will ask to\nsee around your room, so\n\n233\n00:13:50.349 --> 00:13:55.314\nyou must be in a position where you\ncan physically pick up your laptop,\n\n234\n00:13:55.314 --> 00:13:59.453\nand turn it around, so\nthat the proctor can view the room.\n\n235\n00:13:59.453 --> 00:14:02.877\nThat's to make sure that you don't\nhave any ITIL books with you,\n\n236\n00:14:02.877 --> 00:14:06.114\nthat you don't have anybody like\nme hiding in a corner [LAUGH] or\n\n237\n00:14:06.114 --> 00:14:08.247\nhiding under your desk helping you out.\n\n238\n00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:12.463\nAnd it's also to make sure that\nyou are completely alone and\n\n239\n00:14:12.463 --> 00:14:16.269\ncan't be interrupted during\nthat particular test.\n\n240\n00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:22.160\nAt that point in time, the examiner\nwill ask you to start your test.\n\n241\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.940\nYou will get 90 minutes.\n\n242\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.470\nAnd to be perfectly honest 90 minutes or\nan hour and a half is pretty comfortable.\n\n243\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.890\nAt the end of your test,\none thing I will tell you,\n\n244\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.160\nplease don't change your answers.\n\n245\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.780\nGo with your gut instinct,\nit's generally right.\n\n246\n00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.160\nAnd to be perfectly honest\nin about 75% of cases\n\n247\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.930\nthe person that changes their answer,\nchanges it to the wrong one okay.\n\n248\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.371\nYou wanna weigh in for\nabout 10 minutes per question.\n\n249\n00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:49.426\nThe average is 11 minutes per question but\naim for ten and\n\n250\n00:14:49.426 --> 00:14:53.160\nthen you feel completely\ncomfortable with the timings.\n\n251\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.460\nAt the end of your test,\nyou will be asked to submit.\n\n252\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.890\nAnd when you finished,\nthen you click, submit.\n\n253\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.790\nAt that point in time,\nyour screen will disappear.\n\n254\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.070\nYou will be given an intermediate.\n\n255\n00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.682\nI don't like to use that word [LAUGH]\nactually when we're talking about ITIL\n\n256\n00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:12.510\nintermediate.\n\n257\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.010\nYou'll be given an interim\nresults there and then.\n\n258\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.910\nThat interim result will tell you very\nsimply whether you've passed or failed.\n\n259\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.740\nYou're not gonna be able to get\nanything more than that out of it okay?\n\n260\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.210\nThat's all you're going to\nget is just a pass or fail.\n\n261\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.190\nBecause it has to be independently audited\nbefore they can release the result\n\n262\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.420\nto you okay?\n\n263\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.180\nSo you'll get your interim\nresult immediately.\n\n264\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.300\nAnd then you'll get your real result\nwith your score within a week okay?\n\n265\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.450\nI wanna just draw your attention\nto that bottom bullet point there,\n\n266\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.620\njust before we move on.\n\n267\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.260\nIf you're struggling with a question,\nmove on and come back to it.\n\n268\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.140\nAnd just remember, that if you don't\nanswer a question because you think it's\n\n269\n00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.110\nto difficult,\nthen you're gonna get zero points.\n\n270\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.657\nYou've got a 20% chance of\ngetting a five pointer, and\n\n271\n00:15:56.657 --> 00:16:01.960\nyou've got a 50% chance of either getting\nfive or three, so please answer it, okay?\n\n272\n00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.860\nDon't just leave it blank,\nalways answer a question.\n\n273\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:11.370\nRight, I think I've probably given\nyou enough exam tips for now.\n\n274\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.290\nNow it's your turn, okay.\n\n275\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.040\nWhat I want you to do now\nis I want you to go, and\n\n276\n00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.320\nI want you to download sample paper one.\n\n277\n00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.080\nAnd then I want you to do sample paper\none including the scenario booklet and\n\n278\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.620\nthe question booklet.\n\n279\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.600\nI want you to do that now.\n\n280\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.878\nAnd then we're gonna comeback and we're\ngonna go through that question booklet.\n\n281\n00:16:32.878 --> 00:16:36.790\nNow, you notice that with this particular\nbooklet, with sample paper one.\n\n282\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.992\nYou've got answers and\nyou've got rationale,\n\n283\n00:16:38.992 --> 00:16:42.009\nin other words that's the reason why,\nthat's the five pointer.\n\n284\n00:16:42.009 --> 00:16:45.057\nThe reason why this one is\nthe three pointer okay.\n\n285\n00:16:45.057 --> 00:16:51.110\nBut for the moment, what I want us to do,\nis I want us to come back.\n\n286\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.780\nWhen you finish that exam,\nI want us to come back and\n\n287\n00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.600\nI want us to go through that text, okay.\n\n288\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.790\nAnd then, you'll see how you did.\n\n289\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.650\nAnd don't forget,\nwe've got a forum available to us and now,\n\n290\n00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.180\nmore than anything else, is when you\nreally want to be using that forum.\n\n291\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.687\nJust to answer questions, etc,\nas we run through that test.\n\n292\n00:17:11.687 --> 00:17:14.340\nSo good luck.\n\n293\n00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.240\nHave fun with your sample paper.\n\n294\n00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.750\nRemember, read the full question,\nread the full scenario.\n\n295\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.640\nEvery word counts, check for relevance.\n\n296\n00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.300\nAnd don't make assumptions.\n\n297\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.318\nAnd I'll see you when\nyou finish your test.\n\n298\n00:17:28.661 --> 00:17:30.895\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\n\n299\n00:17:30.895 --> 00:17:33.680\nhelping us out in those\ndifferent exam tips.\n\n300\n00:17:33.680

by now you have completed sample\n\n3\n00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:18.990\npaper one from your ITIL intermediate\nlife cycle service operation exam.\n\n4\n00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.960\nSo how did you do?\n\n5\n00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.820\nWell, hopefully, you've downloaded your\nexam paper, and it's been split up into,\n\n6\n00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.110\nand I've got papers here, a scenario\nbooklet, and there are eight scenarios.\n\n7\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.372\nYou'll also have a question booklet, and\nyou will have an answer booklet, as well.\n\n8\n00:00:37.372 --> 00:00:40.180\nGiving you all of the answers and\nrationales.\n\n9\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.370\nI am sure,\n\n10\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.660\nno doubt, that you have had chance to go\nthrough the answers and the rationales.\n\n11\n00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.622\nYou've probably marked yourself and\ngiven yourself a mark out of 40.\n\n12\n00:00:49.622 --> 00:00:54.765\nAnd I'm hoping that you\nhave achieved over 28,\n\n13\n00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:59.215\nwhich is over the pass mark, but I'm gonna\ngo through these questions right now.\n\n14\n00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:02.615\nAnd I'm going to point out\nin the scenarios exactly\n\n15\n00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:07.130\nwhere you'll find the questions and\nwhat points that you need to look out for.\n\n16\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.650\nAnd if you remember,\nwhen we went through the exam review,\n\n17\n00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.780\nI told you to make sure that\nyou read all questions fully,\n\n18\n00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.980\nevery single word in every single\nquestion, and every single scenario.\n\n19\n00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.730\nBecause the answer's in there.\n\n20\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.410\nIt's just knowing where\nto find the answer.\n\n21\n00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.380\nSo let's get going then.\n\n22\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.320\nLet's take a look, then,\nat question number one.\n\n23\n00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.500\nAnd that should be appearing\non your screen right now.\n\n24\n00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.390\nAnd I apologize if there\nare any ruffles in paperwork,\n\n25\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.180\nbecause I have the paper version in front\nof me, just so I can see it all together.\n\n26\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.960\nAnd I'd like to think that you've got\nthe paper version in front of you now,\n\n27\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.120\nas it says right in the very top there,\nyou'll probably find it helpful to have\n\n28\n00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.210\nthe sample paper materials with\nyou as you follow this through.\n\n29\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.190\nSo, one of the first tips that we give you\nwhen we're reading through these sample\n\n30\n00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.180\npapers is actually to read\nthrough the question first and\n\n31\n00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.740\nthen refer back to the scenario, okay.\n\n32\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.030\nSo, what does the question say?\n\n33\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.720\nWell, the question says, which of these\nfollowing options best summarizes\n\n34\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.530\nthe risks that an IT organization\ncurrently does and does not face.\n\n35\n00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.030\nOkay, so, first thing that you\nwant to know is, what to risk?\n\n36\n00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.110\nWell, a risk is something that could\ncause a current project to fail.\n\n37\n00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.210\nA risk is something that\ncould knock us off track.\n\n38\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.020\nSo let's go and\nlook at this scenario then.\n\n39\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.730\nIt's right in front of us.\n\n40\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.050\nWe've talked about right here, right at\nthe very top a large financial institution\n\n41\n00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.580\nrelies on a number of IT services to\nsupport its business functions, okay.\n\n42\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.260\nMany of these are critical.\n\n43\n00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.990\nGenerally there's a good relationship\nbetween IT and the business.\n\n44\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.660\nThat one's worth mentioning.\n\n45\n00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.494\nYou've got three bullet points or\nthree comments at the side of your\n\n46\n00:02:53.494 --> 00:02:56.470\nside of your case study\nin front of you now.\n\n47\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.080\nAnd these are the three things\nthat you really want to look for.\n\n48\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.880\nThat's for the business strategy, look for\nthe direction of the organization,\n\n49\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.430\nwhich is there,\nright in that first bullet point.\n\n50\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.544\nLook for any specific deficiencies or\nany requested actions.\n\n51\n00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:13.060\nSo, try and\npreempt what it is you're being asked for.\n\n52\n00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.900\nAnd then look to see what the service\nprovider's current capability or\n\n53\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.140\nconstraints are.\n\n54\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.110\nIn other words, when we say service\nprovider, we mean us in IT.\n\n55\n00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.178\nSo, we've looked through the fact that\nwe've got a large financial institution,\n\n56\n00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:28.081\nand we've got a number of IT services.\n\n57\n00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:30.550\nAnd we've adopted ITIL.\n\n58\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.980\nAnd that seen as an example of\nbest practice, excellent and\n\n59\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.160\nof course you remember when you adopt ITIL\nyou adapted to suit your environment.\n\n60\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.765\nAdopting ITIL has motivated staff,\nthat's a good place to start, so\n\n61\n00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:47.860\nwe've got happy people, they're motivated,\nthey have high morale, and\n\n62\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.830\nthey came to apply beneficial\nchanges to working practices.\n\n63\n00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.800\nSo obviously we haven't got\nany risks there clearly,\n\n64\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.690\nbecause they're accepting change.\n\n65\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.239\nThey're happy with change.\n\n66\n00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.373\nWe've got excellent service strategy and\ndesign activities and processes in place.\n\n67\n00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:06.940\nA well managed service portfolio so\nagain that's not a risk.\n\n68\n00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.349\nWe've got a well managed\nservice portfolio.\n\n69\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.801\nWhere were we, sorry I lost my place.\n\n70\n00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:17.838\nIn shows that we have that we've got\nstrong business cases establish for\n\n71\n00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:19.370\nnew and changed services.\n\n72\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.490\nAs a result funding and resources\nare matched to the business and IT needs.\n\n73\n00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.450\nExcellent, so\nwe've got funding in place etc.\n\n74\n00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.760\nSo this desk is well managed and\nuses established incident management and\n\n75\n00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.271\nproblem management processes, which\nare supported by mature configuration\n\n76\n00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:43.433\nmanagement system that incorporates\na [INAUDIBLE] database.\n\n77\n00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:47.846\nExcellent, remember problem management\n[INAUDIBLE] database if you\n\n78\n00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:51.116\nremember from when we went\nthrough our processes,\n\n79\n00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:55.528\nthese processes ensure that incidents and\nproblems are escalated to\n\n80\n00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:59.650\nthe correct technical teams as\na functional escalation there.\n\n81\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.153\nThis is essential as many services\nrely on specialist technology, okay.\n\n82\n00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:08.545\nSo we got specialist stuff,\nthat could be a risk you know,\n\n83\n00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:13.206\nif we rely on specialist stuff,\ndo we have the right knowledge\n\n84\n00:05:13.206 --> 00:05:17.240\nmanagement in place to\nensure their experience, and\n\n85\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.850\ntheir information is up to date and\nis recorded for all of us to see, okay.\n\n86\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.100\nSo, in general,\nthe service task is well liked but\n\n87\n00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.400\nthere's some users who don't follow\nservice desk procedures and who attempt to\n\n88\n00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.230\ncontact support staff directly or\nresolve issues without contacting IT,\n\n89\n00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:41.185\nokay, so that suggests to me that\nwe've got a gap there, then.\n\n90\n00:05:41.185 --> 00:05:42.935\nThat's something that we could fill.\n\n91\n00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:47.151\nThat would be, when we talk about you\nknow, having a capability or constraint,\n\n92\n00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:49.455\nwell that's an opportunity there, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:54.675\nRequests from IT ops manage is to business\nmanage is to ask users to adhere to\n\n94\n00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:59.490\nservice test procedures, have failed to\nbring about any change in the situation.\n\n95\n00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.970\nThis means that the business is actually\nquite happy with the way things are,\n\n96\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.860\nand they don't see the business\nbenefits in bringing about any change.\n\n97\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.980\nPerhaps we need to enforce\nthe benefit of this, okay.\n\n98\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.040\nTechnical management is organized\ninto a number of technology teams and\n\n99\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.120\neach team is well managed.\n\n100\n00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.260\nThe service operation as a whole is busy.\n\n101\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.440\nStaff are employed for\ntheir specialist skill sets.\n\n102\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.990\nYou know that's the second\ntime that's been mentioned.\n\n103\n00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.020\nThat's gonna raise a little red flag for\nme.\n\n104\n00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.030\nBut service operation as a whole is busy.\n\n105\n00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.063\nAlso, but because of the busy work\nload little time is available for\n\n106\n00:06:35.063 --> 00:06:37.912\ncross training of roles or\nsharing knowledge.\n\n107\n00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:39.530\nThere's that risk again.\n\n108\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.890\nYou know what, that's kinda the third\ntime that's been mentioned.\n\n109\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.420\nI'm a little bit worried about that.\n\n110\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.110\nI've gotta feeling that there's gotta\nbe something in the answer to do with\n\n111\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.740\nthat, surely.\n\n112\n00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.440\nTechnical management teams use\nestablished monitoring and\n\n113\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.210\nevent management supported\nby associated tools, okay.\n\n114\n00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.970\nSo, that sounds to me\nlike it's well developed.\n\n115\n00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.360\nThis provides access to much of\nthe information that is used\n\n116\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.480\nby other service management processes\nto report on various service levels.\n\n117\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.540\nService level achievements are good with\nvery few major incidents or outages.\n\n118\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.700\nAnd service availability targets\nare always met, excellent, okay.\n\n119\n00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.440\nSo let's go back to the question\nagain right at the top of that page.\n\n120\n00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.340\nWhich of the following options best\nsummarizes the risks that the organization\n\n121\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.740\ncurrently does and doesn't face,\nokay, so we've got a bit of both,\n\n122\n00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.390\nwe've got the risks that they do face and\nthen the risks that they don't face.\n\n123\n00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.060\nAnd the risks that they do face look to me\nto be along the lines of that specialist\n\n124\n00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.860\nteam that we have, you know,\nwith all of those specialist skills,\n\n125\n00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.950\nthat looks like that's a risk to me,\nmost definitely.\n\n126\n00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.797\nAlso it looks like the business aren't\nquite giving us the full amount of\n\n127\n00:07:54.797 --> 00:07:55.689\nsupport there.\n\n128\n00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:59.652\nThe business don't quite see\nthe benefit of what we're achieving.\n\n129\n00:07:59.652 --> 00:08:01.743\nSo that could be a risk too.\n\n130\n00:08:01.743 --> 00:08:04.300\nBut then I also look and\nI see the changes actually.\n\n131\n00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.680\nActually really well established.\n\n132\n00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.556\nAnd people embraced change and we\ncertainly got the right amount of funding,\n\n133\n00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:13.430\nand we've got the right processes\nin place for service strategy.\n\n134\n00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.980\nSo let's take a look at the answers then.\n\n135\n00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.710\nSo what answers do we have here?\n\n136\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:23.360\nNow, these answers are color-coded and\nC here is your five pointer.\n\n137\n00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.000\nB, the brown because we can't show orange,\nunfortunately or amber,\n\n138\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.300\nso B, the brown, is your three pointer,\nthat's your next best.\n\n139\n00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.430\nA is your one pointer, so\nlet's think about traffic rights, here.\n\n140\n00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.830\nAnd D, well D,\nsorry D is your one pointer, I apologize.\n\n141\n00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.094\nAnd A is your distractor,\nthat's a big red no, definitely not.\n\n142\n00:08:45.094 --> 00:08:48.260\nLet's take a look at C then.\n\n143\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.500\nReliance on key personnel\nwith their knowledge and\n\n144\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.530\nskills is a risk, yeah,\nwe've already identified that, haven't we?\n\n145\n00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.270\nYeah.\n\n146\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.620\nLack of business support is a risk, yeah.\n\n147\n00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.830\nWe've already identified that.\n\n148\n00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.770\nResistance to change is not a risk.\n\n149\n00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.570\nNo, it's not, we know that,\nthey're quite happy with change.\n\n150\n00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.900\nAnd inadequate fund is not a risk.\n\n151\n00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.270\nNo, we know that there's budget there.\n\n152\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.144\nSo your five pointer,\nC answers all of the questions, and\n\n153\n00:09:15.144 --> 00:09:19.343\nall of the points actually,\nthat we looked at in the scenario.\n\n154\n00:09:19.343 --> 00:09:24.180\nBut then let's take a look at your three\npointer then, your three pointer being B.\n\n155\n00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.740\nLet's see what's wrong with B.\n\n156\n00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.310\nSo reliance on key personnel is a risk.\n\n157\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:35.168\nYes it is, yeah we know,\nthat's the same as in C.\n\n158\n00:09:35.168 --> 00:09:39.370\nLack of adequate tools is a risk.\n\n159\n00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.820\nNo, there is evidence there\nof a no no database and\n\n160\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.570\nwe've got a CMDB and\nwe've got a Venn management tools as well.\n\n161\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.980\nSo actually that's not a risk at all,\nwe've actually got that.\n\n162\n00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.610\nLack of business support is not a risk.\n\n163\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.120\nWell that's the complete opposite\nto what we had in C, isn't it?\n\n164\n00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.000\nIn C it says, lack of business support\nis a risk and we know that that's true.\n\n165\n00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.970\nOkay, so we know that that's false too.\n\n166\n00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.580\nInadequate funding is not a risk.\n\n167\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.750\nThat's a correct statement,\n\n168\n00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.270\nbecause inadequate funding\ndefinitely isn't a risk.\n\n169\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.371\nWe know that we've got money.\n\n170\n00:10:15.371 --> 00:10:19.421\nSo then let's take a look\nat our one pointer now, and\n\n171\n00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:21.920\nour one pointer being D, okay?\n\n172\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.930\nSo in the bottom right hand corner of that\nscreen, resistance to change is a risk.\n\n173\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.060\nNo it's not,\nbecause there is no resistance to change.\n\n174\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:36.040\nIt states that very clearly right\nat the very start of the scenario,\n\n175\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.020\nresistance to change is not a risk.\n\n176\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.700\nInadequate funding is a risk.\n\n177\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.521\nWell no it's not,\nbecause we've got funding, so\n\n178\n00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:47.255\nwe know that that's not a risk.\n\n179\n00:10:47.255 --> 00:10:55.050\nSo alignment of IT with\nthe business is not a risk.\n\n180\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.310\nYeah, we know that that is actually a true\nstatement, because it clearly states in\n\n181\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:04.210\nthis scenario that actually there is\na very good relationship between IT and\n\n182\n00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:04.890\nbusiness.\n\n183\n00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.007\nAnd we've got service strategy well\ndeveloped,so that's in the scenario, okay.\n\n184\n00:11:09.007 --> 00:11:13.588\nSo lack of involvement of it\noperations staff in other life\n\n185\n00:11:13.588 --> 00:11:16.160\ncycle activities is not a risk.\n\n186\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.866\nI think it is.\nCzu they're really really busy and\n\n187\n00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:23.950\nthey don't actually get opportunity or\nget a chance to do anything else.\n\n188\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.379\nSo that's definitely a risk, okay.\n\n189\n00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:29.759\nSo yeah, that's the reason\nwhy that's my one pointer.\n\n190\n00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:33.681\nAnd let's look at A, and\nA is our distractor,\n\n191\n00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:37.830\nremember it's there to distract, okay.\n\n192\n00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.410\nSo, let's take a look at\nthat first point in A, then.\n\n193\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.680\nResistance to change within IT is a risk.\n\n194\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.750\nNo, we know that that's not a risk,\nbecause staff are motivated to change.\n\n195\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:54.630\nIt's way up there in the second\nparagraph of the scenario.\n\n196\n00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:59.130\nDiffering customer and\nIT expectations are a risk.\n\n197\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.700\nWell, no, we know that we've got\nSLA's which sets expectations,\n\n198\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.500\nwe know we've got design processes, and\nwe know that we're achieving those SLA's.\n\n199\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.650\nSo we know that expectations are set.\n\n200\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.550\nLack of testing is not a risk.\n\n201\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.831\nThat's a lie too, isn't it?\n\n202\n00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:20.760\nOkay, there's no reference\nhere in this scenario,\n\n203\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.550\nI don't see any reference to\nservice transition processes, okay?\n\n204\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.393\nSo, there isn't any evidence\nthat is a risk, but\n\n205\n00:12:27.393 --> 00:12:32.135\nthere isn't any evidence that it's not\na risk because we don't have any reference\n\n206\n00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:34.185\nto service transition here at all.\n\n207\n00:12:36.305 --> 00:12:38.530\nSo then let's look at the last one.\n\n208\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:43.610\nLack of involvement of IT op staff in\nother life cycle activities is not a risk.\n\n209\n00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.800\nWe know it is.\n\n210\n00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.930\nWe know they are busy, okay.\n\n211\n00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.430\nSo we know that they do\nnot have involvement.\n\n212\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.700\nSo within that distractor,\nwhat I've got there are three\n\n213\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.330\ndefinite bullet points that\nare definite no's, and I have got\n\n214\n00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.810\none bullet point that would be a question\nmark which is that third bullet point.\n\n215\n00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.060\nIn that case then, that tells me that\nthat's definitely my distractor,\n\n216\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.310\nbecause there's nothing that I\ncan say emphatically is correct.\n\n217\n00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.820\nI love these questions,\nthe ones with the bullet points.\n\n218\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.318\nI think they're absolutely great and\nthey really, really help us focus.\n\n219\n00:13:18.318 --> 00:13:21.862\nThe other thing about these, and\nI will show you the printed material, and\n\n220\n00:13:21.862 --> 00:13:23.450\nI'm just gonna hold that up now.\n\n221\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:28.579\nYou see that it's laid our very,\nvery clearly for us and\n\n222\n00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:35.075\nwhat we can do is, we can put a check or\na tick, if you're English.\n\n223\n00:13:35.075 --> 00:13:39.495\nAnd we can put a cross next to\neach individual bullet point.\n\n224\n00:13:39.495 --> 00:13:41.875\nAnd if we do that, then we can simply,\n\n225\n00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:46.757\nwhen it comes to your actual grading,\nof your five pointer, your three pointer,\n\n226\n00:13:46.757 --> 00:13:52.097\nyour one pointer, you can simply add up\nhow many checks you've got, or ticks.\n\n227\n00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:57.437\nHow many crosses you've got, and then you\ncan work out your five pointer from there.\n\n228\n00:13:57.437 --> 00:14:01.210\nNow, for those of you that\nare going to be sitting your test\n\n229\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.790\nin a virtual online experience,\nyou don't have the printed material and\n\n230\n00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.470\nyou're not going to be able\nto print off that material.\n\n231\n00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.060\nSo what I'm going to suggest to you is\nthat you take a piece of plain paper,\n\n232\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.410\nyou are allowed that, and\nyou fold it up into quarters.\n\n233\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.750\nAnd then you've got two sides to that\npaper, you've got four quarters on one\n\n234\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:27.000\nside and four on the other side, and what\nthat means is you've got eight sections.\n\n235\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.680\nAnd so what you simply do is write on\nthe corresponding quarter A, B, C and D,\n\n236\n00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.870\nand then put check, check, check, cross,\ncross and so on next to each question, and\n\n237\n00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:45.040\nyou'll still get exactly the same result,\nnot same visual result as you\n\n238\n00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.570\nwould do if you were going through\nan actual written test paper.\n\n239\n00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:56.292\nOkay, right so let's take a look\nthen at question number two then.\n\n240\n00:14:56.292 --> 00:15:01.150\nAnd question number two\ncorresponds to scenario two.\n\n241\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.200\nIt says right at the very\ntop refer to scenario two.\n\n242\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.300\nYou've been asked to review\nthe application management function.\n\n243\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.340\nApplication development and\noperations management,\n\n244\n00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:18.920\nall of them identify the cause of whatever\nissues have been outlined in the question.\n\n245\n00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.710\nWhich one of the following set of options\nis most likely to be causing the issues\n\n246\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.840\nexperienced by the organization?\n\n247\n00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.540\nSo yet again, go through,\nlook at the scenario and\n\n248\n00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.610\nwork out what the business strategy is,\nwhat the service provider's current\n\n249\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:38.730\ncapability or constraints are, and\nlook for any specific deficiencies,\n\n250\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.997\nor any actions requested, or\nany opportunities there, okay.\n\n251\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.650\nSo what does it say here?\n\n252\n00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.297\nWe're in a Internal IT service provider,\nso we're internal to the business unit and\n\n253\n00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:51.569\nwe've developed our own applications.\n\n254\n00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:55.619\nThat means that we have\napplication development\n\n255\n00:15:55.619 --> 00:15:58.981\nas well as application management too.\n\n256\n00:15:58.981 --> 00:16:02.740\nApplication developments carried\nout by developers, obviously.\n\n257\n00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.451\nAnd in general they're successful,\n\n258\n00:16:04.451 --> 00:16:07.340\nthey're considered to be\nsuccessful by the business.\n\n259\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.880\nThey're well received by the users,\nthey find them easy to use, and\n\n260\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.030\nin the past year,\n\n261\n00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:17.540\nthere's been an increase in the number\nof applications obtained from suppliers.\n\n262\n00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.878\nWell of course that's\napplication management and\n\n263\n00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:22.630\nnot application development.\n\n264\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.970\nSo six months ago, a new application\nmanagement team was established\n\n265\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.490\nas part of an improvement project.\n\n266\n00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.620\nGenerally, they will grow out together\nin the combination of development and\n\n267\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.110\nmanagement has improved many areas.\n\n268\n00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.100\nI would expect it to.\n\n269\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.570\nUser acceptance testing has improved,\ngood.\n\n270\n00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.970\nBecause we're bringing in\noff-the-shelf products as well.\n\n271\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.440\nWith the result, the common issues and\ndefects are identified either earlier in\n\n272\n00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.410\nthe life of the applications and\nthey're documented as known errors, okay.\n\n273\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.970\nAnd that has a tie into\nproblem management too, so\n\n274\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.530\nthey'll be documented in\nthat known error database.\n\n275\n00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:02.790\nDeployment activities have improved\nbecause application management,\n\n276\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.560\ndevelopment, and operations management\nwere involved in releasing deployment.\n\n277\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.120\nSo that includes the build-in, or\n\n278\n00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.540\nthe purchasing, if we're bringing\nin from an external organization.\n\n279\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.210\nThe testing and the deployment, and\n\n280\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.790\ndon't forget early life support that\nexists within release and deployment too.\n\n281\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.480\nAdditionally, application management\nhas implemented a policy that when\n\n282\n00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.750\napplications are obtained from suppliers,\nsupport is included in the contract.\n\n283\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.470\nBut we've got some unresolved\nconcerns over day-to-day support.\n\n284\n00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.019\nThe office management team finally can't\ndeal with all the issues that arise.\n\n285\n00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.280\nOne result is that the service\nlevel target, so SLTs for\n\n286\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.840\nrestoration of service, that's incident\nmanagement aren't always meant.\n\n287\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.250\nWhen incidents occur,\nthey can deal with common errors,\n\n288\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.880\nbut they're not able to provide\nmore specialist support.\n\n289\n00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.360\nSo we need that involvement\nfrom application development,\n\n290\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.090\nfrom application management\nfrom our suppliers, too.\n\n291\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:09.670\nThis is compounded by inconsistencies in\nthe architectures, in the platforms and\n\n292\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.550\ndevelopment methods, which means that\nevery application is development.\n\n293\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.687\nThat does present a skill issue,\nit presents a training issue too, okay.\n\n294\n00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.890\nThis means that each\napplication is different,\n\n295\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:30.130\nmaking incident problem diagnosis more\ndifficult and more time consuming.\n\n296\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.791\nAnd when applications are implemented\nutilizing the new technology, well,\n\n297\n00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:38.957\noperations management teams do not\nreceive the necessary training,\n\n298\n00:18:38.957 --> 00:18:43.208\ndefinitely within the hands of\nreleasing deployment management too.\n\n299\n00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:48.510\nAn additional issue is the number of\nincidents that are related to capacity and\n\n300\n00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.020\nperformance is increasing.\n\n301\n00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:55.560\nSo that sounds to me like the capacity\nmanagement process or certainly\n\n302\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.790\nthe proactive part of the capacity\nmanagement process, that plans for\n\n303\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:05.700\nnew services is not actually\nperforming its role.\n\n304\n00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.094\nOkay, so let's take a look\nat the answers then, okay.\n\n305\n00:19:09.094 --> 00:19:13.532\nSo, we've got a five pointer or\na three pointer or a one pointer and\n\n306\n00:19:13.532 --> 00:19:14.891\nzero pointer okay?\n\n307\n00:19:14.891 --> 00:19:19.900\nA five pointer let's take a look at it,\nthen, B, let's go through this.\n\n308\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.060\nApplication management has not developed\nan implemented set of standards for\n\n309\n00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.400\narchitecture, we know that, okay?\n\n310\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.120\nIt's in the fourth line down of that\nlast paragraph, most definitely.\n\n311\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.249\nSo that's a check definitely,\nnext to that bullet point.\n\n312\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.630\nApplication management is not\nproviding the resources required for\n\n313\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.240\nthird line support.\n\n314\n00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:47.820\nOkay, we know that too, because again,\nthat is in that last paragraph too.\n\n315\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.520\nApplication management has not\nadequately defined operational models or\n\n316\n00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.190\ndefined the technical resources required\n\n317\n00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:00.120\nto operate the applications in\nthe live environment, okay.\n\n318\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:06.729\nSo yet again, we see that,\n\n319\n00:20:06.729 --> 00:20:12.740\nwe see that in that last paragraph\nwithin the scenario, okay.\n\n320\n00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:19.490\nSo, let's take a look then at our three\npointer, and our three pointer being D.\n\n321\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:26.160\nOkay D, which is the orange one,\napplication management has not tested,\n\n322\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.710\nor sorry has not participated in testing\nthe functionality of applications.\n\n323\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.660\nOkay well we know that's definitely true,\ndon't we?\n\n324\n00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.150\nHave they participated or is it?\n\n325\n00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.830\nWell, let's take a look, okay.\n\n326\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:47.900\nThe scenario states that user acceptance\ntesting actually has improved.\n\n327\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.290\nSo, that's an incorrect statement.\n\n328\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:59.770\nThey have, or at least we know that\nthe users have been involved in testing.\n\n329\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.540\nLet's look at the second bullet point,\nthere.\n\n330\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.640\nApplication management has failed to\nidentify and fulfill training needs.\n\n331\n00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.930\nThat's in our last paragraph,\nwithin that scenario, isn't it?\n\n332\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.600\nMost definitely, okay.\n\n333\n00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.770\nRight in front of our very,\n\n334\n00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.350\nvery eyes it says that we're not\nreceiving the necessary training.\n\n335\n00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.850\nIt's right that second from\n\n336\n00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.750\nlast line there we've not received\nthe necessary training, okay.\n\n337\n00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.650\nSo what about bullet number three, then?\n\n338\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.870\nWe've not adequately, or\n\n339\n00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.990\napplication management has not\nadequately defined operational models or\n\n340\n00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:36.040\ndefined the technical resources required\nto operate in the live environment.\n\n341\n00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.360\nWell again, in that last paragraph it\ndoes actually tell us that we don't have\n\n342\n00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.630\nthe operational models and we don't have\nthe application architectures, okay?\n\n343\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.050\nSo we have two bullet points\nthere that are correct, and\n\n344\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.280\nthat's what gives us our three pointer,\nokay?\n\n345\n00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.000\nSo let's look, then, at our one pointer,\nand our one pointer is C.\n\n346\n00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.443\nSo C, the first bullet point there,\napplication management has\n\n347\n00:22:01.443 --> 00:22:05.746\nnot developed and implemented a set of\nstandard for application architecture.\n\n348\n00:22:05.746 --> 00:22:08.888\nAll right, well that was the first\nbullet point in our five pointer and\n\n349\n00:22:08.888 --> 00:22:10.280\nwe know that that one's true.\n\n350\n00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.140\nThe second one, application management and\n\n351\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:20.020\napplication development have failed to\nprovide information about known errors.\n\n352\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.290\nWell no, we know that that's not true\nbecause we know that there's a known\n\n353\n00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:28.100\nerror database and it tells us\nthat known errors are provided.\n\n354\n00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:33.596\nAgain, that is within that second\nparagraph within the scenario, okay.\n\n355\n00:22:33.596 --> 00:22:35.910\nSo what about the last bullet point?\n\n356\n00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:40.400\nOkay, application development has failed\nto provide the resources required for\n\n357\n00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.390\nthird level support for\nresolution of incidents and problems.\n\n358\n00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.240\nOkay, well it does state in the in\nthe scenario that incidents and\n\n359\n00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.670\nproblems diagnosis is difficult and\ntime consuming, but\n\n360\n00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.665\nthat's because of the disparate\ntypes of applications there are.\n\n361\n00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:59.260\nIt doesn't actually say that there\nisn't any third life support.\n\n362\n00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.170\nIt just says that we have\ndisparate applications.\n\n363\n00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.200\nThat's all, and\ntherefore disparate skills are required.\n\n364\n00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.370\nSo no, that's not true.\n\n365\n00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.610\nLet's look at our distractor, then.\n\n366\n00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.430\nAnd our distractor being A, okay?\n\n367\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.735\nApplication management has failed to\nobtain information about known errors\n\n368\n00:23:16.735 --> 00:23:18.410\nerrors and software suppliers.\n\n369\n00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.911\nThat kinda takes the last bullet point\nthat we looked at and kind of expands it\n\n370\n00:23:22.911 --> 00:23:27.179\n[LAUGH] in its degree of incorrectness,\nbecause we know that that's not true.\n\n371\n00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:28.860\nWe know we've got known errors.\n\n372\n00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.869\nSo the next bullet point, operations\nmanagement has failed to define and\n\n373\n00:23:34.869 --> 00:23:37.716\nprovide application training to users.\n\n374\n00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:44.397\nWell, there's no evidence in the scenario\nthat we don't have training at all.\n\n375\n00:23:44.397 --> 00:23:49.259\nSo, whilst I don't necessarily,\nwell I think that that statement is kind\n\n376\n00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:52.808\nof incorrect,\nbecause it doesn't say anything, but\n\n377\n00:23:52.808 --> 00:23:57.375\nwe don't have enough information\nthere to be able to ascertain that.\n\n378\n00:23:57.375 --> 00:23:59.854\nSo I'm gonna put a question\nmark against that.\n\n379\n00:23:59.854 --> 00:24:04.614\nI'm not gonna put a Tick or a check next\nto it because I don't think it's true.\n\n380\n00:24:04.614 --> 00:24:07.710\nBut I'm not sure that it's untrue,\nit's just not there.\n\n381\n00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.410\nAnd remember what I said about,\ndon't make assumptions?\n\n382\n00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.170\nWhen we did our exam\npreparation I mentioned,\n\n383\n00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:17.220\ndon't make assumptions,\nbecause we simply don't know, okay?\n\n384\n00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.730\nDon't read in between the lines,\nthere's nothing written there.\n\n385\n00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.930\nAnd there's certainly nothing there\nthat tells us whether this is\n\n386\n00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.860\na true statement or not.\n\n387\n00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.670\nOkay, so what about application\nmanagement then failing to involve IT\n\n388\n00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.890\noperation staff in deployment activities?\n\n389\n00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.720\nWell, it actually states that\nboth application management,\n\n390\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:41.220\napplication development and IT ops\nmanagement are involved in deployment.\n\n391\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.570\nSo that's definitely an untrue statement.\n\n392\n00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:48.430\nSo yet again very similar to\nthat last question, we have\n\n393\n00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:52.949\ntwo statements there, in that distractor\nthat I think are definitely incorrect,\n\n394\n00:24:52.949 --> 00:24:55.510\nand I've got one that I've\ngot a question mark against.\n\n395\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.910\nSo, I'm certainly not going to pick\nthat one because that one is definitely\n\n396\n00:24:58.910 --> 00:24:59.460\nambiguous.\n\n397\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.773\nNow I'm hoping that you can\nsee right now that, actually,\n\n398\n00:25:03.773 --> 00:25:08.145\nwith all of these questions, the answer\nis definitely there in the scenario,\n\n399\n00:25:08.145 --> 00:25:10.943\nit's just a case of being\nable to highlight that.\n\n400\n00:25:10.943 --> 00:25:13.864\nSo let's take a look\nthen at scenario three.\n\n401\n00:25:13.864 --> 00:25:18.551\nAnd scenario three, or question number\nthree tells you that you're the team\n\n402\n00:25:18.551 --> 00:25:21.850\nleader responsible for\nmonitoring and control.\n\n403\n00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.670\nSo that's an activity as\npart of IT operations and\n\n404\n00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.970\nas part of event management.\n\n405\n00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:33.990\nYou're required to resolve issues arising\nin the scenario and reach a conclusion.\n\n406\n00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:39.190\nWhich of these is the best solution\nto address data retention issues?\n\n407\n00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.690\nNow, obviously I know this question.\n\n408\n00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.920\nAnd what I am going to tell you\nis a warning to this question.\n\n409\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.340\nIs what I just said in the last question.\n\n410\n00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.910\nDo not make assumptions.\n\n411\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.430\nOkay, do not make assumptions,\n\n412\n00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:56.270\nit will be your biggest downfall\nin this particular question, okay?\n\n413\n00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.095\nLet's take a look at the scenario.\n\n414\n00:25:58.095 --> 00:26:00.411\nThey've recently purchased\nevent management and\n\n415\n00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:04.030\nthe service operation team is in the\nprocess of installing and configuring it.\n\n416\n00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:10.480\nAnd so questions being asked regarding\nretention of data relating to events.\n\n417\n00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.550\nEveryone has agreed that events\nthat are classified as warnings or\n\n418\n00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.720\nexceptions need to be retained for\na lengthy period.\n\n419\n00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.410\nThey don't say what that lengthy\nperiod is, don't make assumptions.\n\n420\n00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.020\nThere are concerns regarding the amount\nof storage space that will be used, and\n\n421\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.530\nthe sheer volume of data to be stored and\npotentially accessed.\n\n422\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.690\nIn response senior technical staff have\nproposed that events that are categorized\n\n423\n00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:44.320\nas informational,\nwell hang on a minute, because the last\n\n424\n00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.760\nparagraph talked about warning or\nexceptional events, okay?\n\n425\n00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.860\nSo now we're talking about information and\n\n426\n00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.730\nwe're saying that events that are\ncategorized as information will need or\n\n427\n00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.400\nonly be retained for\nminimal amount of time.\n\n428\n00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:05.200\nWell, that wasn't mentioned as a concern\na little bit earlier in the scenario.\n\n429\n00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.670\nSo watch out for that, but\nwhat is a minimum amount of time mean?\n\n430\n00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.830\nIt means absolutely nothing.\n\n431\n00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.890\nThey propose a period of one week for\ninformation on the events,\n\n432\n00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.180\nbased on the assumption that if\nthere is a follow up issue, well,\n\n433\n00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.610\nif it hasn't occurred by then,\nit's not gonna occur at all.\n\n434\n00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:25.700\nBut other team members have said that this\nis inadequate and it might be needed for\n\n435\n00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.575\nsome time beyond this point, so\nit should be retained indefinitely!\n\n436\n00:27:30.575 --> 00:27:34.992\nWow, okay, that's kind of a bit like using\nthe sledge hammer to crack a nut, right?\n\n437\n00:27:34.992 --> 00:27:38.310\nI mean, indefinitely, for\ninformational events?\n\n438\n00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.260\nOkay.\n\n439\n00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.570\nWhere's the justification?\n\n440\n00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.570\nSo a number of other requirements\nhave emerged, which include the legal\n\n441\n00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:50.170\ndepartment in the organization has\nsaid that there's a legislative and\n\n442\n00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:56.760\ncompliance issue that requires some data,\nsome, to be retained for up to six years.\n\n443\n00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.100\nWhat does some mean?\n\n444\n00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.180\nThere is no description\nof what some means.\n\n445\n00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:02.860\nDon't assume.\n\n446\n00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.930\nThere's been a number of\nserious IT security breaches,\n\n447\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.190\nthat the security team claim would\nhave been avoided if they'd had\n\n448\n00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:14.300\naccess to the history of event data for\nall categories, and\n\n449\n00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.820\nthey want all relevant data to\nbe retained for at least a year.\n\n450\n00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.600\nThat's both for informational warning,\nand the exceptional events.\n\n451\n00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.850\nProblem capacity and\n\n452\n00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:27.210\navailability management have requested\naccess to all event data to improve trend\n\n453\n00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:32.500\nanalysis, and they have agreed to\na retention period of six months.\n\n454\n00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.785\nOkay, so they've agreed, but\nit doesn't look to me as though anybody's\n\n455\n00:28:35.785 --> 00:28:39.070\ngone back to the business,\nother than speaking to their legal team.\n\n456\n00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.590\nOkay, wow.\n\n457\n00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.130\nWell, let's take a look at the answer,\nthere, on this one.\n\n458\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.600\nThe answer on this one,\nvery straight away, okay.\n\n459\n00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:54.590\nStraight, it just jumps out at me\nas your five pointer immediately.\n\n460\n00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.010\nAnd that is because the first\nthing that happens in D\n\n461\n00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:02.830\nas your five pointer is you'll\ngo back to the business, okay.\n\n462\n00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.960\nYou go back to the business, you can\nsolve specific discussions with them and\n\n463\n00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.810\nthe legal department to\nidentify the criteria.\n\n464\n00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:16.510\nAnd then you create criteria to identify\neach type of event and the retention\n\n465\n00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.840\nperiod for each type of event in\naccordance with the business need.\n\n466\n00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.290\nAnd then create a policy\nto document these.\n\n467\n00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.600\nThat is so obvious,\nwe go back to the business.\n\n468\n00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.680\nWe don't make any assumptions.\n\n469\n00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.940\nWe go back to the business.\n\n470\n00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.750\nAfter all, we are all about\ndelivering value to the organization.\n\n471\n00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.780\nThis is not about what we want,\nthis is about what the business wants.\n\n472\n00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.680\nSo let's look at our three pointer then,\nand our three pointer, B.\n\n473\n00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.730\nStraight away, I don't like it.\n\n474\n00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.270\nThe legal requirement\nis the most important.\n\n475\n00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.210\nWho says?\n\n476\n00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:55.160\nWe haven't had the verification\nfrom the business.\n\n477\n00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.640\nAnd then it goes on even worse to say\nnon-compliance could incur fines.\n\n478\n00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.600\nWow, that's one heck of an assumption,\nokay?\n\n479\n00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.450\nJust cuz it might happen in\nyour organization doesn't\n\n480\n00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.530\nmean it's gonna happen\nin this organization.\n\n481\n00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:15.450\nIt doesn't even say what\nkind of organization it is.\n\n482\n00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.790\nSo, that's one heck of an assumption,\nokay?\n\n483\n00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.067\nSo straight away,\nI'm running away from that answer, okay.\n\n484\n00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.540\nAnd then we talk about\nconsulting the legal and\n\n485\n00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.860\ncompliance departments\nto categorize the data.\n\n486\n00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:32.270\nI agree with that statement, but we don't\nneed to consult legal and compliance,\n\n487\n00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.510\nwe need to consult everybody.\n\n488\n00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.080\nAnd then the second bullet point,\nyou can solve problem or capacity and\n\n489\n00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.040\navailability and security and confirm\nthe need for one year retention and\n\n490\n00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.170\nsix months retention periods.\n\n491\n00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:52.830\nWell it says in the scenario that\nthey've requested six months.\n\n492\n00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.600\nThat last bullet point.\n\n493\n00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.531\nSo why have we changed that?\n\n494\n00:30:55.531 --> 00:30:59.780\nAnd then, we create a retention\npolicy to document those.\n\n495\n00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.310\nOkay, I'm happy with the retention policy,\nbut\n\n496\n00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.240\nwhere on Earth did you get your data from?\n\n497\n00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.060\nWhere did you get your statistics from?\n\n498\n00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.990\nSo look at number A then,\nthat's our one pointer.\n\n499\n00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.300\nWe consult with problem\ncapacity available in security\n\n500\n00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.970\nto gain a more detailed understanding\nof their event data requirements.\n\n501\n00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.190\nThey've already said what they want.\n\n502\n00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.890\nWe don't need to do that,\nthey've already said what they want.\n\n503\n00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:28.000\nThen we take into account the suggestions\nof the organization's legal department\n\n504\n00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.120\nregarding legislative and\ncompliance issues.\n\n505\n00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.340\nWell, they've already given us theirs,\n\n506\n00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:37.040\nit's the rest of the business\nthat we need to go back to.\n\n507\n00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:42.650\nAnd then define and document a policy that\nensures that all informational event data\n\n508\n00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:46.170\nis retained for\na minimum of six years and three months.\n\n509\n00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:50.030\nAnd at this point in time,\nI kinda wanna scream that I give up.\n\n510\n00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:54.530\nCuz where on Earth did six years and\nthree months come from [LAUGH]?\n\n511\n00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.930\nI look at that, and\nI think did somebody write this as a joke?\n\n512\n00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.100\n[LAUGH] Really?\n\n513\n00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.000\nWell, if we thing this is bad,\nthen take a look at C, okay.\n\n514\n00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.900\nYou agree that this data\nis extremely unlikely\n\n515\n00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.020\nto be needed beyond one week, okay.\n\n516\n00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:15.080\nThat's clearly not what is said in the\nscenario and you know, problem management,\n\n517\n00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.870\ncapacity management, etc, wanted for\nsix months, the legal department\n\n518\n00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:25.320\nwants data for six years, so\nseriously now you're gonna say one week?\n\n519\n00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.240\nAnd that on the balance of risk, the cost\nof returning the data outweighs the need.\n\n520\n00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.030\nThere is clearly a need.\n\n521\n00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.100\nOkay, so that's clearly wrong.\n\n522\n00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:38.270\nIn order to achieve the most cost\neffective solution, I do not see\n\n523\n00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:42.590\nanything in the scenario mentioning money.\n\n524\n00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:49.690\nThey talk about space, but\nthey don't talk about money at all.\n\n525\n00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.860\nSo why is that being brought in?\n\n526\n00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.229\nAnd documenting and then implementing\na one week retention policy, why?\n\n527\n00:32:55.229 --> 00:32:59.538\nAnd then you tell the legal\ndepartment of your decision,\n\n528\n00:32:59.538 --> 00:33:03.328\nin case IT governance\nissues arise in the future.\n\n529\n00:33:03.328 --> 00:33:07.060\nI think [LAUGH] there'll be more than IT\ngovernance issues arising in the future\n\n530\n00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.000\nif you're gonna tell the legal department\nthat they're not getting what they\n\n531\n00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.410\nabsolutely need for\nlegislative compliance, okay.\n\n532\n00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:20.250\nRight, well, so now we've looked\nat the first three questions and\n\n533\n00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.440\nwhat we're going to do is we're\ngoing to take a short break.\n\n534\n00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.629\nAnd when we come back in session two,\nwe'll take a look at the following\n\n535\n00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:33.314\nquestions in the ITIL sample paper one for\na service operation.\n\n536\n00:33:33.314 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.640\n[SOUND] Hi this is Jo Peacock for\nIT Pro TV.\n\n2\n00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.748\nAnd we are in the process of reviewing\nITIL Service Operation, sample paper one.\n\n3\n00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:18.336\nAnd in our previous session, we looked\nat questions one through three and\n\n4\n00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:22.702\nnow we're going to carry on with\nthe paper and look at question four and\n\n5\n00:00:22.702 --> 00:00:26.740\nthe remaining questions in this section,\nokay?\n\n6\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.770\nSo, let's go back to question\nnumber four then and\n\n7\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.610\nlet's take a look at\nthe actual question itself.\n\n8\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.850\nYou've been asked to advise when\nthere are any process related changes\n\n9\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.800\nshould be made to the way that the company\nhandles service requests in the future.\n\n10\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.279\nWhich one of the following recommendations\nbest reflects ITIL guidance?\n\n11\n00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:50.065\nSo you've got a travel company\nwith branches worldwide.\n\n12\n00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:54.085\nSo they've got a small number of\ngeographically dispersed service desks\n\n13\n00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:57.995\nthat act as the focal point for\na common incident management process.\n\n14\n00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:01.860\nSo you have local service\ndesk structure but\n\n15\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.600\nyou have a common incident\nmanagement process.\n\n16\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.414\nThe desks are well regarded but\nonly open during 8 'till 1800,\n\n17\n00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:12.780\nthat's 6 PM with some local variations.\n\n18\n00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.780\nAnd the business has asked for\n\n19\n00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.470\nsupport to be made available 24 hours\na day because or preventing that.\n\n20\n00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.240\nA number of trends have been identified,\n\n21\n00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.380\nsuch as there's been a gradual increase\nin the total number of incidents handled.\n\n22\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.540\nThat's a good thing, right?\n\n23\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.450\nAn increasing percentage of\nthe incidents handled are not, in fact,\n\n24\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.108\nrelated to failure, but are some\nform of service request from users.\n\n25\n00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:39.970\nMore than 60% of all incidents\nare now service requests of some sort.\n\n26\n00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.440\nThat's quite a percentage.\n\n27\n00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.880\nThere's some anecdotal evidence that\nhigher-priority failures are occasionally\n\n28\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.030\ndelayed or overlooked because\nof the volume of incidents and\n\n29\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.140\nrequests that are being\nhandled at busy times.\n\n30\n00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.900\nAnd a risk analysis of service requests\nhandled over the last six months\n\n31\n00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.090\nreveals the following.\n\n32\n00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:05.665\nWell, 35% of password reset,\n11% are mailbox based allocation,\n\n33\n00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:10.550\n9% is access to existing application,\n7% is\n\n34\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.285\na new desktop application, that's a lot\nof requests for access management there.\n\n35\n00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:20.010\nAgain 6% new user setup, 3% access for\n\n36\n00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.338\ntemporary staff, again,\na lot of requests for access management.\n\n37\n00:02:24.338 --> 00:02:30.800\nAnd then 3% workstation move and\n26% other, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.383\nSo let's take a look at the answers,\nthen, that are available to us, okay.\n\n39\n00:02:35.383 --> 00:02:39.193\nAnd let's take a look at number three and\nnumber C, sorry, letter C,\n\n40\n00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:42.280\nwhich is your five pointer\nin this particular answer.\n\n41\n00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.090\nOkay, a large proportion of service\ndesk calls a service request,\n\n42\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.160\nyeah we know this.\n\n43\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.199\nIt says that in the scenario.\n\n44\n00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:53.111\nAnd a separate request fulfillment process\nshould be recommended to channel these to\n\n45\n00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:56.880\nthe appropriate groups quickly and\nwithout impact.\n\n46\n00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.330\nYes, most definitely.\n\n47\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.500\nThen it mentions a web-based self-help\ncapability should be considered as this\n\n48\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.280\nmay help make some level of support\navailable outside of normal office hours.\n\n49\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.920\nYeah, definitely because they want\nto expand the hours of support, but\n\n50\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.680\nof course they don't have\nthe money to do that.\n\n51\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.350\nIt's too costly.\n\n52\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.540\nAnd then a business case has got to be\nmade to justify the cost involved in\n\n53\n00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.620\nsetting up and running the new process,\n\n54\n00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.860\nbecause there was a concern about\ncost in that first paragraph.\n\n55\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.630\nSo therefore, if they've got some concern\nabout cost, it's always worthwhile\n\n56\n00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.010\nensuring that with any significant item\nof expenditure, we need a business case\n\n57\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.150\nto be able to identify the potential\nreturn on investment for that new process.\n\n58\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.420\nSo let's take a look at our\nsecond answer then, and\n\n59\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.170\nsee why that's our three pointer.\n\n60\n00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.930\nAs a large proportion of service desk\ncalls are service requests, a separate\n\n61\n00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.630\nrequest fulfillment should be recommended\nto channel these to the appropriate groups\n\n62\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.560\nquickly without impact on critical or\nhigh priority incidents.\n\n63\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.240\nExactly the same as your five pointer,\nso yes, we know we like that one.\n\n64\n00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:12.250\nProviding access for temporary staff\nis not a type of service request.\n\n65\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.415\nOkay, in whose books?\n\n66\n00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:20.620\n[LAUGH] Because it asks the question,\nwhich best reflects ITIL guidance?\n\n67\n00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.870\nAnd ITIL guidance clearly states\nthat it's still a request.\n\n68\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.260\nIt's a request for access,\n\n69\n00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.980\nwhether it's temporary or\npermanent, it makes no difference.\n\n70\n00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.200\nIt's still a request, okay.\n\n71\n00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.107\nAnd then the last bullet point, a business\ncase must be made to justify the cost\n\n72\n00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.808\ninvolved in setting and\nrunning the new process.\n\n73\n00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:39.260\nYeah, we're happy with that one.\n\n74\n00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.710\nBut that second bullet point,\nno, we're not happy with that.\n\n75\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.990\nThat's why that one is your three pointer.\n\n76\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.700\nOkay, so let's look at D.\n\n77\n00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.960\nNew user setups and workstation\nmoves are changes and requests for\n\n78\n00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.230\nchange should be raised.\n\n79\n00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.180\nSo these calls should not be\nhandled as service requests.\n\n80\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.380\nThey are changes.\n\n81\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.298\nBut for the most part,\nthese are standard changes,\n\n82\n00:05:03.298 --> 00:05:07.495\nbecause I would expect the impact to\nthe infrastructure to be understood.\n\n83\n00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:12.300\nAnd therefore standard changes will\nusually be managed by request fulfillment.\n\n84\n00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:16.875\nSo, we really don't want these\nbeing raised as changes and\n\n85\n00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:21.155\nthen going through that change process\nthat we found in service transition,\n\n86\n00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:25.135\nwhere each change has got to be assessed\nby the change advisory board, or\n\n87\n00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:27.785\nevaluated by the change advisory board.\n\n88\n00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:30.405\nSo we really,\nreally don't want to do that at all.\n\n89\n00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.330\nOkay, let's have a look at\nthe second bullet point in D then.\n\n90\n00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.510\nAs these types of requests represent\na large percentage of calls\n\n91\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.590\nto the service desk, a further review\nis required before a decision is made.\n\n92\n00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.280\nWell, we don't need a further review.\n\n93\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.060\nWe really, really don't need\na further review because, and\n\n94\n00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.870\nwe know that we've got a large\nproportion of service request, and\n\n95\n00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.350\nwe have to have some way of\nmanaging those service request.\n\n96\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.640\nAnd some way of identifying that there\nare service request is managing them\n\n97\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.240\nseparately to incident management, okay.\n\n98\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.210\nSo then let's look at the next one then.\n\n99\n00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.860\nA web based self help\ncapability should be considered\n\n100\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.920\nas this may help make some level of\nsupport available outside of normal hours.\n\n101\n00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.610\nYes, we know, we had that in our five\npointers and we quite like that, so\n\n102\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.480\nyeah, we're gonna stick with that one.\n\n103\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.580\nSo we have two bullet\npoints that are wrong and\n\n104\n00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.080\nwe have one bullet point that we like,\nand that's why that's our one pointer.\n\n105\n00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.010\nLet's take a look B.\n\n106\n00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.330\nB is our distractor.\n\n107\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.240\nAn organization needs only to implement a\nseparate request fulfillment process where\n\n108\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.220\nthis is fully justified, as the service\ndesk is well regarded in this case.\n\n109\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.530\nIt appears that no\nimmediate action is needed.\n\n110\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.180\nWell, we know immediate action is needed\nbecause we know that priority one, or\n\n111\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.980\nurgent incidents, are being hindered\nbecause of the volume of service requests.\n\n112\n00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.310\nWe know that that's definitely true.\n\n113\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.650\nThere's no clear proof, only anecdotal\nevidence, that handling service requests\n\n114\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.680\nthrough the instant management\nprocess is causing difficulties.\n\n115\n00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.432\nWhat have I just said?\n\n116\n00:07:07.432 --> 00:07:11.910\nOkay, there is clear proof,\nthese processes are being delayed.\n\n117\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.110\nIncident resolution is being delayed.\n\n118\n00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.120\nThe situation should be monitored and\nthe figures analyzed and\n\n119\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.990\nreviewed again in three months time.\n\n120\n00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.526\nWell, really we're not actually make\na decision if we do that, are we?\n\n121\n00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.510\nWe're just kind of putting it off, and\n\n122\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.320\nwe're still going to get exactly\nthe same decision in three months time.\n\n123\n00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.230\nBut in the meantime,\n\n124\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.830\nwe've got three months worth of\nIncidents that could well be delayed.\n\n125\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.250\nWhere we could have problems\n\n126\n00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.660\nwith those incidents because we're\nnot meeting service level targets.\n\n127\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.130\nSo in this instance,\nC is definitely a five pointer and\n\n128\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.720\nwe can definitely see\nwhy B is our distractor.\n\n129\n00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.981\nLet's look at question number five then.\n\n130\n00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:58.947\nAnd question number five looks at the\nremaining steps, or remember what we've\n\n131\n00:07:58.947 --> 00:08:03.542\nsaid In your exam preparation,\nif it's asking for the remaining steps,\n\n132\n00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:08.340\nthen the last thing we wanna do is\nrepeat what's already happened.\n\n133\n00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.290\nSo, what remaining steps are there in\nthe process that will communicate to\n\n134\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.205\nthe service desk and\nsecond line support staff?\n\n135\n00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:19.700\nWith the service desk manager of\na national travel agency, okay.\n\n136\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.540\nIt doesn't say international,\nit says national.\n\n137\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.140\nThe company has appointed\na problem manager.\n\n138\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.930\nBoth positions were created after a review\nof the IT department revealed that\n\n139\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.720\nincident response times are failing\nto meet agreed targets.\n\n140\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.780\nWhich is because the teams don't\ndistinguished between incidence and\n\n141\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.710\nproblems and\ndo not manage them separately.\n\n142\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.510\nIn some cases, the result of this\nis that a service is not restored\n\n143\n00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.300\nuntil IT have identified\nthe full solution.\n\n144\n00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.001\nNow, we did a section on this when we\nlooked at the service operation class and\n\n145\n00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:56.171\nthen we actually got a separate that\nlooks at incidents and problems.\n\n146\n00:08:56.171 --> 00:08:58.243\nAnd the difference between the two and\n\n147\n00:08:58.243 --> 00:09:02.519\nexactly what the purpose is of incident\nmanagement and problem management and\n\n148\n00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:05.580\nactually why we should be\naddressing them separately.\n\n149\n00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.930\nThe review also identified the following.\n\n150\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.480\nThat 25% of incidents are related to\nthe main holiday booking service and\n\n151\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.070\nis business critical.\n\n152\n00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:20.603\nThis is what we call in ITIL terms a VBF,\na vital business function.\n\n153\n00:09:20.603 --> 00:09:23.339\n10% related to financial management,\n\n154\n00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:28.203\n40% are related to something else,\nof the services and desktop issues,\n\n155\n00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:32.580\nand 25% of incidents are categorized\nas service requests.\n\n156\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.090\nSounds like the last question, doesn't it?\n\n157\n00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.910\nThe desktop incidents are a particular\nissue as they seem to\n\n158\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.390\nbe recurring incidents and all incur\ncall out charges from suppliers, so\n\n159\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.200\nthat's costing us money.\n\n160\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.940\nAnd to address this issue, you and the\nproblem manager are developing incident\n\n161\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.970\nand problem management processes\nbased on ITIL guidance.\n\n162\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.590\nAnd you're working on a program\nof training and awareness for\n\n163\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.600\nservice desk and technical support staff.\n\n164\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.960\nAnd you've agreed so far, so\nthis is what you've done so far.\n\n165\n00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.650\nThe service desk are gonna log a call and\nseek a resolution if available.\n\n166\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.950\nOnce service is restored,\nthen they'll check with the user and\n\n167\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.520\nclose the call if the user is satisfied.\n\n168\n00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.058\nSo the question says, which summarizes\nthe remaining steps in the process?\n\n169\n00:10:19.058 --> 00:10:22.660\nWell, your best-fit\nanswer to this one is C.\n\n170\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.880\nNow we know from both incident and\n\n171\n00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.770\nproblem management that priority\nshould be based on impact and urgency.\n\n172\n00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.600\nWhere the impact codes have been agreed\nin advance by service level management.\n\n173\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.032\nAnd in fact this is the exact wording that\nI use when we went through Incident and\n\n174\n00:10:40.032 --> 00:10:45.897\nproblem management in those modules, and\nwe looked at how we allocate priorities.\n\n175\n00:10:45.897 --> 00:10:48.940\nAnd there should be examples within\nour Service Level Agreements.\n\n176\n00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.500\nIf no resolution can be identified,\n\n177\n00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.480\nthen the incident is escalated\nto the appropriate technical,\n\n178\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.300\nfunctional escalation,\nwho investigate and seek a resolution.\n\n179\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.876\nIf we can't identify it, or\nit's considered necessary\n\n180\n00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:08.683\nto identify the root cause,\nthen we raise a problem record.\n\n181\n00:11:08.683 --> 00:11:15.529\nAnd that's exactly what is highlighted in\nthe ITIL guidance for incident management.\n\n182\n00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:17.920\nWell let's take a look then at our second,\n\n183\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.500\nour third pointer,\nour second best answer which is B.\n\n184\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.450\nAnd we talk about basing\npriority on impact and urgency.\n\n185\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.920\nAnd we've got exactly\nthe same wording on that.\n\n186\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.380\nSo we know that that one is right.\n\n187\n00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.050\nIf the incident is related to\nthe holiday booking service,\n\n188\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.830\nthen it's escalated immediately.\n\n189\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.870\nI don't see how that's efficient.\n\n190\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.240\nBear in mind that we're\nconcentrating on efficiency and\n\n191\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.635\neffectiveness, escalating it to\nsomebody else isn't efficient\n\n192\n00:11:44.635 --> 00:11:48.050\nif the service desk analyst could\nactually resolve that incident, okay.\n\n193\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.420\nSo don't escalate is first, let's see if\nthe service desk analyst can resolve.\n\n194\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.070\nSo that bullet point is not right,\nits certainly not efficient.\n\n195\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.510\nOkay, and the third bullet point there is\nexactly the same as the five pointer, so\n\n196\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.170\nwe know that that one is right.\n\n197\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.088\nLet's take a look then at our one pointer.\n\n198\n00:12:07.088 --> 00:12:12.347\nAt one point A talks about ensuring\nthe service desk can establish impact and\n\n199\n00:12:12.347 --> 00:12:13.096\nurgency.\n\n200\n00:12:13.096 --> 00:12:17.122\nNo, it has to be in agreement\nwith the business, so\n\n201\n00:12:17.122 --> 00:12:21.160\nit has to be agreed in\nthe service level agreement.\n\n202\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.255\nIt's not down to the service desk\nstaff to establish impact and urgency,\n\n203\n00:12:25.255 --> 00:12:27.832\nand established priority\nbecause then you end\n\n204\n00:12:27.832 --> 00:12:32.580\nup in a situation where a user might\nhave one perspective of a priority.\n\n205\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.100\nThey might want it to be a one,\nand the service desk analyst,\n\n206\n00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.060\nwell their guidelines might say that\nthat particular incident is a three.\n\n207\n00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.850\nSo we always need to have that agreed,\nalways.\n\n208\n00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:49.840\nIf no resolution can be identified and\nthe incident is a recurring desktop issue,\n\n209\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.520\nthen a problem record will be raised and\nallocated to the team.\n\n210\n00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.820\nWell, I've got a problem\nwith that straightaway.\n\n211\n00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.320\nOne is we only raise a problem record\nwhen we want to find out the root cause.\n\n212\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.560\nAnd why are we picking\non the desktop issue?\n\n213\n00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.120\nIs it because that we know that\nwe've got desktop incidents?\n\n214\n00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.550\nWell, finding root causes to these\nincidents is actually only going to delay\n\n215\n00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.050\nincident resolution.\n\n216\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.530\nSo that's gonna have exactly\nthe opposite effect to what we want.\n\n217\n00:13:16.702 --> 00:13:18.550\nSo let's look at the last\nbullet point then.\n\n218\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.430\nOnce the problem is resolved,\na known error record will be created, and\n\n219\n00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.140\nif necessary, an RFC will be raised.\n\n220\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.210\nWow, haven't we got the order\nthe wrong way around here, okay?\n\n221\n00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.930\nSo a known error, okay, is a problem for\nwhich the root cause is known and for\n\n222\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.980\nwhich a work around exists.\n\n223\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.290\nThat's a work around that will restore\nservice and close the incident.\n\n224\n00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.667\nSo a work around is utilized when\nwe haven't resolved the problem.\n\n225\n00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:51.580\nWe don't utilize a work around\nafter a problem is being resolved.\n\n226\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.500\nWe do that before we resolve a problem,\nand\n\n227\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.370\nwe'll quite often raise in\nour RFC to resolve a problem.\n\n228\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.370\nSo yeah, we've kinda got the cat\nbefore the holes in that one.\n\n229\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:10.090\nSo let's take a look at our distracter\nthen and our distracter is D, okay?\n\n230\n00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.120\nBase priority on the urgency of the issue.\n\n231\n00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.846\nNo, we know that that's based\non impact and urgency, okay,\n\n232\n00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:20.226\nnot just on the urgency, so\nwe know that that's wrong.\n\n233\n00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:24.487\nAnd then going down, if no resolution\ncan be identified, then we\n\n234\n00:14:24.487 --> 00:14:30.000\nraise a problem record and allocate it\nto the appropriate technical teams.\n\n235\n00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.580\nNo, no.\n\n236\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.970\nWe certainly don't do that.\n\n237\n00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.570\nThey'll seek a cause and a workaround.\n\n238\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.560\nIf no resolution can be identified,\nthen we raise a problem record.\n\n239\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.910\nSo, we don't know how to restore service,\nso we're just gonna try and\n\n240\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.750\nfind out what the root cause is.\n\n241\n00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.890\nWe need to restore service,\nthat's got to be our priority, and\n\n242\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.349\nthen we have to obtain\nthe root cause afterwards.\n\n243\n00:14:49.349 --> 00:14:51.830\nAnd then of course we go\ninto the last bullet point,\n\n244\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:57.090\nwhich is just a duplicate of\nthe bullet point in our one pointer,\n\n245\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:03.200\nand we know that that one's wrong, that\none doesn't make any sense at all, okay.\n\n246\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.120\nSo let's go on then to\nquestion number six, and\n\n247\n00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.041\nhopefully, you're follow\nus in this review.\n\n248\n00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:12.420\nAnd hopefully you've realized\nif you've made any mistakes,\n\n249\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.882\nexactly where those mistakes were, and\nyou've taken a look at the case study, and\n\n250\n00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:19.820\nyou understand exactly what's required.\n\n251\n00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.110\nSo let's take a look at number six then.\n\n252\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.860\nAnd number six asks you which of\nthe following processes will enable you to\n\n253\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.340\nassess the functions, capabilities,\nand level of maturity.\n\n254\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.555\nSo we have a regional utility company with\na five year strategy to grow the business\n\n255\n00:15:36.555 --> 00:15:38.775\nand better serve customers.\n\n256\n00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:42.175\nIn support of that,\nwe've acquired two local companies.\n\n257\n00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:45.532\nWe've acquired a gas provider and\nan electricity supplier.\n\n258\n00:15:45.532 --> 00:15:50.119\nAnd part of the strategy is to quickly\nassess the technical management function\n\n259\n00:15:50.119 --> 00:15:53.961\nin place at each company and\ndetermine how best to integrate them.\n\n260\n00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:59.580\nYou're a consultant, always remember what\nyour role is in all of these questions.\n\n261\n00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.430\nYou've been asked to develop a plan\naimed at evaluating each acquired\n\n262\n00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.420\ncompany's technical management\nfunction and assess its abilities.\n\n263\n00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:12.182\nYour plan is to benchmark each against\nITIL best practices in an effort to\n\n264\n00:16:12.182 --> 00:16:16.178\ndetermine its current capabilities and\nlevel of maturity.\n\n265\n00:16:16.178 --> 00:16:20.641\nOkay, your aim is to ensure the function\nis providing the organization with\n\n266\n00:16:20.641 --> 00:16:25.720\nthe technical knowledge and expertise\nneeded to manage the IT infrastructure.\n\n267\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.162\nOkay, but that is technical management.\n\n268\n00:16:28.162 --> 00:16:33.060\nOkay, that's just something that\ntechnical management would do when we're\n\n269\n00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.710\ntalking about managing the infrastructure.\n\n270\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.048\nAnd then determine whether that function\nis supporting the service life cycle.\n\n271\n00:16:40.048 --> 00:16:44.780\nSo those two bullet points,\nthey are your objectives.\n\n272\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.477\nAnd your first step is to collect and\nreview the documentation being produced\n\n273\n00:16:49.477 --> 00:16:53.896\nto see how effectively technical\nmanagement is performing in its role.\n\n274\n00:16:53.896 --> 00:16:58.409\nOkay, so let's take a look then\nat the answers, and the answer,\n\n275\n00:16:58.409 --> 00:17:00.390\nyour five-pointer, is D.\n\n276\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.840\nAnd D talks about reviewing copies\nof available skills, inventories,\n\n277\n00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.070\ntraining plans, and training records.\n\n278\n00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:13.330\nOkay, so do a training needs analysis,\nas we like to call that in ITIL.\n\n279\n00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:17.160\nReview their processes and\ntheir technology performance metrics so\n\n280\n00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.760\nwe can see what skills they have and\nhow well they're performing.\n\n281\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.380\nLook at their availability and capacity\nplans, along with any project plans so\n\n282\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.690\nwe can see what projects\nare in the pipeline and\n\n283\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.390\nwhat projects are about to be delivered.\n\n284\n00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.310\nReview change and release records and\nrelated deliverables,\n\n285\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.110\nsuch as known error entries.\n\n286\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.280\nOkay, again, so\nwe can see what's in the pipeline and\n\n287\n00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.575\nwe can see exactly what it is\nthey are planning to release.\n\n288\n00:17:47.575 --> 00:17:51.799\nAnd then review and assess the quality\nof documentation, including standard\n\n289\n00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:56.245\noperating procedures, system\nadministration manuals, and user manuals.\n\n290\n00:17:56.245 --> 00:18:00.237\nSo that will tell us what\ntheir level of knowledge is.\n\n291\n00:18:00.237 --> 00:18:02.186\nOkay, so all of those seem relevant to me,\n\n292\n00:18:02.186 --> 00:18:05.035\nthey're definitely\nrelevant to the question.\n\n293\n00:18:05.035 --> 00:18:09.044\nSo let me take a look then at\nmy three-pointer, which is B,\n\n294\n00:18:09.044 --> 00:18:11.650\nmy three-pointer here.\n\n295\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.690\nObtain copies of available skills\ninventories and training plans.\n\n296\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.790\nNow, you'll notice that\nin your five-pointer,\n\n297\n00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.370\nit talks about training records for\neach of the technical teams, and\n\n298\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.810\nincludes a service desk\nin the other groups.\n\n299\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.450\nRemember what I said about don't make\nassumptions, if it's not mentioned in\n\n300\n00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:33.160\nthere, then don't assume that it's meant,\ndon't read between the lines.\n\n301\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.080\nSo B is an incomplete answer\nin that first bullet point.\n\n302\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.365\nComparing technology maintenance schedules\nwith actual maintenance activities,\n\n303\n00:18:42.365 --> 00:18:44.975\nokay, and the mean time between failure.\n\n304\n00:18:44.975 --> 00:18:48.583\nWe'll just see how good they\nare at resolving incidents and\n\n305\n00:18:48.583 --> 00:18:51.840\nhow good they are at\npreventative maintenance.\n\n306\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.256\nIt's not actually looking for\na project, it's not looking for\n\n307\n00:18:56.256 --> 00:18:59.390\na level of maturity there, okay?\n\n308\n00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.550\nReview available project plans to ensure\ntechnical management is engaged early.\n\n309\n00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.850\nIf they were engaged early, we'd also have\navailability and capacity plans, too.\n\n310\n00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.360\nThen review and assess the quality\nof technical documentation,\n\n311\n00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.170\nincluding standing operating procedures,\nyes, we definitely like that one.\n\n312\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.768\nContact the problem manager and\ndetermine whether technical\n\n313\n00:19:21.768 --> 00:19:26.989\nmanagement resources are contributing\nto the known error database.\n\n314\n00:19:26.989 --> 00:19:31.840\nThat's not a bad statement,\nthat's not a bad statement at all.\n\n315\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.466\nDoes it answer any of the questions,\nin terms of maturity and capabilities?\n\n316\n00:19:37.466 --> 00:19:40.318\nWell, it tells us whether\nthey're contributing, so\n\n317\n00:19:40.318 --> 00:19:44.120\nit tells us, I guess,\nwhether there's a relationship in place.\n\n318\n00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:49.370\nSo that's kind of a neutral statement for\nme, it's not great, but it's neutral.\n\n319\n00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:55.940\nLet's take a look then at our\nthird answer, so our one-pointer.\n\n320\n00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.441\nOur one-pointer is C,\nconduct a skills inventory and\n\n321\n00:19:59.441 --> 00:20:04.473\ntraining needs analysis, and then map\nthe results to the service portfolio.\n\n322\n00:20:04.473 --> 00:20:08.767\nOkay, well, if there's no service\nportfolio available, I have to ask why,\n\n323\n00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:11.973\nwhy do we need to map the results\nto the service portfolio?\n\n324\n00:20:11.973 --> 00:20:16.168\nBecause if we're concentrating on the\npipeline, then that's only going to show\n\n325\n00:20:16.168 --> 00:20:19.875\nwhether we're skilled in any new\nservices that we might be bringing in,\n\n326\n00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:20.694\nin the future.\n\n327\n00:20:20.694 --> 00:20:26.150\nWhat about being skilled and our maturity\nof what we're doing right now, okay?\n\n328\n00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.720\nNow, reviewing copies of\nmaintenance schedules and\n\n329\n00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.910\nproject plans aimed at upgrading and\n\n330\n00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:35.360\nmaintaining the infrastructure,\nI'm happy with that, that's okay.\n\n331\n00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.806\nAgain, it's just showing whether we are\ndoing service operation, in other words,\n\n332\n00:20:41.806 --> 00:20:44.965\nwhether we're able to support\nour infrastructure, but\n\n333\n00:20:44.965 --> 00:20:46.639\nit's not a bad statement..\n\n334\n00:20:46.639 --> 00:20:50.593\nOkay, reviewing technology performance\nmetrics, such as availability,\n\n335\n00:20:50.593 --> 00:20:52.369\nutilization, and performance.\n\n336\n00:20:52.369 --> 00:20:57.326\nThat's not telling me how capable and\nhow mature they are, that's telling me\n\n337\n00:20:57.326 --> 00:21:02.380\nwhat service operation is doing, but\nnot what technical management is doing.\n\n338\n00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.600\nReview and assess the quality\nof technical documentation,\n\n339\n00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.980\nincluding SOPs, and\nsystem administration manuals, etc.\n\n340\n00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.890\nWe're happy with that one,\nthat's appeared in all of them so far and\n\n341\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.210\nwe really, really like that.\n\n342\n00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:21.820\nReview incident resolution times to\ndetermine the number of incidents resolved\n\n343\n00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.775\nwithin SLAs.\n\n344\n00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.540\nThat's incident management, and\nthat's on the service desk.\n\n345\n00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.572\nSo what that has to do with the actual\nscenario, I don't know, but\n\n346\n00:21:31.572 --> 00:21:35.720\nit kinda looks like a little\nbit of a distraction to me.\n\n347\n00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.850\nSo speaking of distractions,\nlet's look at A then.\n\n348\n00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.795\nA talks about the skills inventory and\n\n349\n00:21:40.795 --> 00:21:45.080\ndetermining if the staff's technical\ncertifications [LAUGH] are up to date.\n\n350\n00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.270\nWhy do we need them, does it say\nthat they all have to be certified?\n\n351\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.130\nI didn't think so.\n\n352\n00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.780\nReview training plans and\nsurvey the technical staff to\n\n353\n00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.320\ndetermine if they're getting the technical\ntraining they feel that they need.\n\n354\n00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.870\nSo what you're doing is you're asking for\nan opinion, and\n\n355\n00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:07.010\nthere's nothing wrong with asking for\nan opinion for satisfaction.\n\n356\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.820\nBut nevertheless, you're just going\nto be asking for an opinion, and\n\n357\n00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.170\nwe want to actually see results, okay?\n\n358\n00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.960\nReview and assess the quality\nof technical documentation,\n\n359\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.480\nincluding escalation procedures.\n\n360\n00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.200\nThat is not a technical document,\nthat is a standard operating procedure for\n\n361\n00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.190\nthe service desk, so\nthat has no relevance.\n\n362\n00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.860\nReview resolution times to determine\nthe number of incidents that technical\n\n363\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.090\nmanagement teams are resolving\nwithin service level agreements.\n\n364\n00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.510\nI should like to think that the technical\nmanagement teams aren't resolving\n\n365\n00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.160\ntoo many incidents.\n\n366\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.660\nBecause I should like to think that\nthe service desk are doing that\n\n367\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.770\nwithout escalation to\ntechnical management.\n\n368\n00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.800\nIf all incidents are being\nescalated to technical management,\n\n369\n00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.860\nthen we've seriously got\na problem with our processes.\n\n370\n00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.800\nOkay, that one was kind of\na meaty question, wasn't it?\n\n371\n00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.510\nYeah, that was definitely\na meaty question, and in fact,\n\n372\n00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:08.820\nin terms of severity, that one was\nactually labelled as a hard question.\n\n373\n00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.290\nAnd you're going to get at least one or\n\n374\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.690\ntwo hard questions in your sample paper,\nokay?\n\n375\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.780\nThey're not all going to be easy,\n[LAUGH] okay?\n\n376\n00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.350\nSo let's take a look then\nat the next question, and\n\n377\n00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.970\nthe next question is question number 7.\n\n378\n00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.680\nAnd you're an ITSM,\nan IT service management consultant, and\n\n379\n00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.460\nyou've been asked to help write\nfunctional specification for a toolset.\n\n380\n00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.637\nThe primary objective is to identify\nfunctionality needed to satisfy\n\n381\n00:23:35.637 --> 00:23:40.379\nthe requirements for service operations,\nbut also to consider any advantages\n\n382\n00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:43.440\nthat may be gained across\nthe life cycle as a whole.\n\n383\n00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.002\nSo what's the best summary of\nthe high-level requirements for a toolset?\n\n384\n00:23:49.002 --> 00:23:51.503\nHigh level requirements.\n\n385\n00:23:51.503 --> 00:23:54.169\nSo, scenario number seven then.\n\n386\n00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:56.570\nIt's a large insurance company.\n\n387\n00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.356\nI don't know how large large is, okay?\n\n388\n00:23:59.356 --> 00:24:03.690\nAnd they need it,\nthey need to refresh their ITSM technology\n\n389\n00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:08.940\nused to support functions and\nprocesses within service operation.\n\n390\n00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.255\nThat's incident problem request\nfulfillment, with access management and\n\n391\n00:24:13.255 --> 00:24:14.390\nevent management.\n\n392\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.150\nOrganizational units have\npreviously acquired or\n\n393\n00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.310\ndeveloped their own tools to\nmeet specific requirements,\n\n394\n00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:27.080\nmany of which are crucial to\nthe support of the IT services.\n\n395\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:32.330\nBut that's led to an inconsistency in\ndata and duplication of functionality.\n\n396\n00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.120\nInvestigations have revealed\na lack of knowledge and\n\n397\n00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.102\nunderstanding about the hardware and\nsoftware assets.\n\n398\n00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:42.155\nThe server like configuration\nmanagement to me and particular\n\n399\n00:24:42.155 --> 00:24:47.760\nvulnerability is identified with\nrespect to software license compliance.\n\n400\n00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.930\nSo event management and\n\n401\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:54.670\na certain configuration management\nhere are an issue then, clearly.\n\n402\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:56.120\nSo the organization is looking for\n\n403\n00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.660\na tool set that will facilitate\na solution to this problem without having\n\n404\n00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:06.170\nto embark on a full physical audit of\ntheir widely distributed infrastructure.\n\n405\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.495\nThe organization operates when number of\ngeographical locations which is connected\n\n406\n00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:12.930\nvia a reliable network.\n\n407\n00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.630\nOkay.\nIt says that it's a large insurance\n\n408\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.740\ncompany right at the very top.\n\n409\n00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:23.040\nBut it doesn't actually say whether\nthey are a global insurance company or\n\n410\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.830\nwhether they are a national\ninsurance company,\n\n411\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:29.590\njust says they operate from\na number of geographical locations.\n\n412\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.861\nThe organization operates\na well-established process but\n\n413\n00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:38.020\nthey came to explore the benefits\nof adopting a lifecycle approach.\n\n414\n00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:43.000\nNew tools that must support existing\nprocesses and improve communication.\n\n415\n00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.390\nSo, you're the consultant and\n\n416\n00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.220\nyou've been asked to help write the\nfunctional requirement for the tool set.\n\n417\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.665\nWe've already identified that we\nneed configuration management.\n\n418\n00:25:53.665 --> 00:25:58.350\nWe already identified that some form of\nevent management and automated discovery,\n\n419\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:02.590\nin terms of licenses, would be really,\nreally, really beneficial.\n\n420\n00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.660\nAnd we need one of those what we call\nworkflow process engines as we outlined in\n\n421\n00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:12.700\nincident and problem management, to\nmanage those service operation processes.\n\n422\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.150\nAnd of course,\nwe don't want anymore duplication.\n\n423\n00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.760\nSo we need integration with our\ncurrent tool set, so which answer,\n\n424\n00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.790\nthen, answers all of that?\n\n425\n00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.002\nWell look at A.\n\n426\n00:26:23.002 --> 00:26:26.687\nA talks about an integrated\nconfiguration management system,\n\n427\n00:26:26.687 --> 00:26:30.790\nwhich allows assets and\nattributes to be held centrally.\n\n428\n00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.475\nPerfect, including those relationships.\n\n429\n00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:38.630\nThen we want the capability\nto automate remote discovery.\n\n430\n00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.230\nPerfect!\n\n431\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.890\nExactly what I've just said.\n\n432\n00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.710\nGenerate the report on discrepancies\nbetween deployments and licenses.\n\n433\n00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.520\nAnd then a workflow engine to\nimprove the control of processes and\n\n434\n00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.335\nautomatically manage activities.\n\n435\n00:26:52.335 --> 00:26:54.490\nThat's exactly what we want.\n\n436\n00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.650\nAnd then the capability to\ninterface both manually\n\n437\n00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.305\nbecause some of these have\nbeen developed in house, and\n\n438\n00:27:00.305 --> 00:27:05.590\nelectronically with tools in\nother areas of the life cycle.\n\n439\n00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.630\nThat gives me everything that I need.\n\n440\n00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.758\nSo let's look at B and\nsee why that is our three pointer.\n\n441\n00:27:11.758 --> 00:27:16.332\nB talks about an integrated CSS\nwhich allows all assets and\n\n442\n00:27:16.332 --> 00:27:19.796\nrelevant attributes to be held centrally.\n\n443\n00:27:19.796 --> 00:27:25.230\nAnd allows relationships, well that looks\nexactly the same as the previous answer.\n\n444\n00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.630\nSo, yes we know that's right.\n\n445\n00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:31.772\nThe capability to automate\nremote discovery of devices.\n\n446\n00:27:31.772 --> 00:27:35.446\nAgain, now it looks exactly the same and\nso we are happy with that one and\n\n447\n00:27:35.446 --> 00:27:36.680\nwe know that's right.\n\n448\n00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.428\nMany have driven range of self\nhelp facilities to simplify and\n\n449\n00:27:41.428 --> 00:27:43.968\nimprove the handling of service request,\n\n450\n00:27:43.968 --> 00:27:48.218\nI don't remember that being\nspecifically mentioned in the scenario.\n\n451\n00:27:48.218 --> 00:27:52.480\nOkay, there's nothing wrong with that but\nit's not relevant to the scenario.\n\n452\n00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:59.028\nThe ability to generate reports for\nuse of other areas by service management,\n\n453\n00:27:59.028 --> 00:28:04.099\nthat's okay but again, it doesn't\naddress anything in the scenario.\n\n454\n00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:06.782\nIt's not relevant.\n\n455\n00:28:06.782 --> 00:28:09.242\nSo let's take a look at our one pointer.\n\n456\n00:28:09.242 --> 00:28:14.852\nA one pointer talks about an integrated\nCMS that allows assets and\n\n457\n00:28:14.852 --> 00:28:16.899\nattributes to be held.\n\n458\n00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.430\nBut also allows financial\ninformation about assets.\n\n459\n00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.910\nWell, you haven't mentioned relationships,\nand you're in configuration management.\n\n460\n00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.525\nAnd straight away, I wanna run away.\n\n461\n00:28:26.525 --> 00:28:30.740\nBecause you need to talk about\nrelationships in configuration management.\n\n462\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.330\nAnd there is no mention in this scenario\nabout finances being a problem.\n\n463\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.310\nSo then,\nlet's take a look at the next one.\n\n464\n00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.974\nCapability to input findings from\nthe audit to the infrastructure, and\n\n465\n00:28:44.974 --> 00:28:49.700\nto report a number of licenses that\nare found as a result of the order.\n\n466\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.290\nWell, surely an automated\ndiscovery tool will do that.\n\n467\n00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:57.050\nAnd it will do that so much better.\n\n468\n00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.000\nSo what about the next one?\n\n469\n00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.860\nA work flow engine, fine, to improve\nthe control of processes an automatically\n\n470\n00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:06.990\nmanaged activity such as alerting and\ntask escalation.\n\n471\n00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:12.920\nWell, last time might be appropriate in\nsome instances, not appropriate in all.\n\n472\n00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:18.590\nSo again, the automatic escalation\ndoesn't answer anything in this scenario,\n\n473\n00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.420\nit's non-relevant.\n\n474\n00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.360\nAnd then the ability to export data for\n\n475\n00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.810\nuse by other tools used\nin different teams.\n\n476\n00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:27.150\nOkay.\nI don't mind that.\n\n477\n00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.540\nWe want to share data.\n\n478\n00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.400\nSo I'm quite happy with that one.\n\n479\n00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:38.970\nIt does mention in the scenario that we\ndo want to ensure that we are integrated.\n\n480\n00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.048\nSo integration is okay for me.\n\n481\n00:29:43.048 --> 00:29:46.749\nBut one thing I do want to point out,\nit only mentions exporting data, and\n\n482\n00:29:46.749 --> 00:29:48.910\nit doesn't mention bringing any data in.\n\n483\n00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.610\nAnd if we're talking about an integrated\nCMS, then that needs to bring data in,\n\n484\n00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:53.130\ntoo, right?\n\n485\n00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.080\nNow, the next one then, our distractor.\n\n486\n00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.998\nAnd our distractor there looks\n\n487\n00:30:02.998 --> 00:30:07.624\nat an integrated configuration\nmanagement database.\n\n488\n00:30:07.624 --> 00:30:11.919\nWell, a configuration management system\nis made up of many databases, so\n\n489\n00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:13.770\nwe don't just want a database.\n\n490\n00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.120\nWe want the system with a federated\n\n491\n00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.040\nnumber of databases inside because\nwe have got geographical locations.\n\n492\n00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.470\nSo, we want to ensure that we actually\nhave the configuration management system.\n\n493\n00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.850\nLet's look at the second bullet point.\n\n494\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:40.470\nProviding consistency with existing ways\nof working and other tools employed within\n\n495\n00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:45.840\nthe organization in order to minimize the\ntime taken to train existing employees.\n\n496\n00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.480\nThe time taken to train\nexisting employees?\n\n497\n00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.610\nThat's not really an issue.\n\n498\n00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:54.720\nAnd consistency with other tools,\nwe want to integrate.\n\n499\n00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.130\nWe don't just want to be consistent.\n\n500\n00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.820\nWe don't wanna work to a standard.\n\n501\n00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.720\nWe want to integrate.\n\n502\n00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.900\nDesigning the automatic import and\n\n503\n00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:07.270\nexport of existing information from\nother databases to allow continued use,\n\n504\n00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:11.150\nso a minimum disruption to\nexisting working practices.\n\n505\n00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:15.760\nWell, we don't necessarily have to\nhave automated import and export.\n\n506\n00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.380\nThere's nothing relevant\nthere to the scenario.\n\n507\n00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:23.430\nThe ability for service desk analyst\nto take control of this is tested,\n\n508\n00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.730\nagain, is there anything\nrelevant in this scenario?\n\n509\n00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.599\nAbsolutely no, it's not mentioned\nin the scenario at all, so\n\n510\n00:31:30.599 --> 00:31:34.541\nbe very very careful,\ncuz something might sound really nice and\n\n511\n00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:39.443\nit generally does with the distractor,\nbut then we have to consider relevant.\n\n512\n00:31:39.443 --> 00:31:45.129\nSo that leads us into the last\nquestion then for sample paper one.\n\n513\n00:31:45.129 --> 00:31:48.373\nAnd we're looking at the best\nsolution to address concerns.\n\n514\n00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:51.170\nSo there's not really a very\nexplicit question there.\n\n515\n00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.628\nSo let's look at the concerns\nwithin the scenario, okay.\n\n516\n00:31:54.628 --> 00:31:59.600\nThey've implemented ITIL\nprocesses over the past two years,\n\n517\n00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.190\nand so far they've improved incident and\nproblem resolution.\n\n518\n00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:07.550\nThey've reduced fail changes due\nto effective change planning and\n\n519\n00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:11.000\ndeployment, and they've got high\ncustomer satisfaction because they've\n\n520\n00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.980\nnegotiated service level agreements\nover two-thirds of the business unit.\n\n521\n00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:20.089\nSo we've got architecture and planning,\nmanaging key programs since setting\n\n522\n00:32:20.089 --> 00:32:24.013\nstandards, we've got IT control\nresponsible auditing and complies, and\n\n523\n00:32:24.013 --> 00:32:26.050\nservice level management and change.\n\n524\n00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:30.251\nAnd then, we've got a data center\nwhere we have an operations bridge,\n\n525\n00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:34.805\nwe have a service desk, mainframe\nmanagement, we have server management,\n\n526\n00:32:34.805 --> 00:32:38.890\nWAN, and LAN management, and\nthe application support groups too.\n\n527\n00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.800\nThe data center departments focus on\nmanaging their own technology and\n\n528\n00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.970\ncommunicate, as required, when an\nincident, problem, or change is initiated.\n\n529\n00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.570\nEach department is responsible for\nmonitoring and\n\n530\n00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.160\ncontrolling its own technology.\n\n531\n00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.900\nWe much prefer collaboration, don't we?\n\n532\n00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:03.900\nMonitoring reports are circulated to\neach system administrator and a summary\n\n533\n00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.970\nof performance and exceptions is submitted\nto the department heads every month.\n\n534\n00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:12.970\nA monthly report on case system\nperformance from each department\n\n535\n00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.714\nis supplied to IT control and\n\n536\n00:33:14.714 --> 00:33:19.020\nused to compile those slam charts\nthat we looked at in service design.\n\n537\n00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.600\nWe wanna implement capacity and\navailability management.\n\n538\n00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:28.490\nAnd it's being managed by the A&amp;P manager,\nit's understood that the current approach\n\n539\n00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:32.738\nto monitoring and control needs to change\nin order to address the requirements.\n\n540\n00:33:32.738 --> 00:33:37.980\nHowever, there's resistance from\nthe data center to allowing access to\n\n541\n00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:43.950\nthe data or for any interference in\ntheir monitoring activities or tools.\n\n542\n00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.840\nSo which one of these then\nis the best solution?\n\n543\n00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.777\nWell, let's take a look at D.\n\n544\n00:33:49.777 --> 00:33:53.582\nAnd D talks about initiating\nan organizational wide review of\n\n545\n00:33:53.582 --> 00:33:58.118\ncurrent monitoring and control\ncapability ensuring the involvement and\n\n546\n00:33:58.118 --> 00:34:01.400\nsupport of the data center manager,\nexactly.\n\n547\n00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.970\nThe data center manager is concerned.\n\n548\n00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:08.010\nAnd if he's concerned, we've got to\naddress those concerns, otherwise,\n\n549\n00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.360\nwe've already said there's\na resistance to change and\n\n550\n00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:15.620\nhe is going to carry on resisting change,\nunless he's consulted.\n\n551\n00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.310\nAnd again, we talk about involving\nall departments in defining and\n\n552\n00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:24.017\nagreeing and executing processes and\nthose operational control procedures.\n\n553\n00:34:24.017 --> 00:34:29.680\nAnd then ensuring that monitoring and\ncontrol is performed at all levels, from\n\n554\n00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:35.302\ncomponent to service, including customer\nexperience, that's incredibly important.\n\n555\n00:34:35.302 --> 00:34:39.850\nTo support capacity and availability\nmanager, capacity and availability\n\n556\n00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:46.110\nmanagement can not work without\nhaving monitoring at component level.\n\n557\n00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.980\nWhere possible,\nmove the routine monitoring and\n\n558\n00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.880\ncontrol to the operations bridge.\n\n559\n00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.170\nBecause in ITL that's\nwhere we say it belongs,\n\n560\n00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:58.710\nthe operations bridge is where operational\nday-to-day monitoring takes place.\n\n561\n00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.580\nSo we like all of the bullet points in D.\n\n562\n00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.016\nSo what about our third pointer then,\nour three pointer?\n\n563\n00:35:05.016 --> 00:35:11.726\nWell, C is okay, but C looks very much\nat availability and capacity management.\n\n564\n00:35:11.726 --> 00:35:14.374\nSee, what we wanna do\nin C is investigate and\n\n565\n00:35:14.374 --> 00:35:19.120\ncatalogue each department\nmonitoring requirement and tools.\n\n566\n00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.973\nOkay, but I don't see us going\nback into the entire organization.\n\n567\n00:35:22.973 --> 00:35:26.356\nI don't see us involving the data center\nmanager, he's not gonna be happy and\n\n568\n00:35:26.356 --> 00:35:29.136\nhe's certainly not gonna be bought\nin if we don't involve him.\n\n569\n00:35:29.136 --> 00:35:33.246\nDocument both operational and\nnon-operational needs for\n\n570\n00:35:33.246 --> 00:35:35.800\ncapacity and availability, okay.\n\n571\n00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.770\nThat's okay, I'm quite okay with that.\n\n572\n00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:44.098\nEstablish a project team to analyze\nwhere the capacity and availability.\n\n573\n00:35:44.098 --> 00:35:46.179\nAnd we've mentioned capacity and\navailability twice and\n\n574\n00:35:46.179 --> 00:35:47.162\nwe it's only one element.\n\n575\n00:35:47.162 --> 00:35:52.377\nAnd we haven't address the data send to\nmanager, so I'm kind of concerned by that.\n\n576\n00:35:52.377 --> 00:35:56.360\nAnd then we've looked at cost\nsavings in that next bullet point.\n\n577\n00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:02.400\nI don't see cost as being\ntoo much of an issue, but\n\n578\n00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.780\nwe haven't put monitoring where it\nshould be in the operation bridge,\n\n579\n00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:10.100\nwhich is of course,\nexactly where monitoring takes place.\n\n580\n00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.780\nSo I don't like that one as much as D,\ndefinitely not.\n\n581\n00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.010\nNow let's look at A, A is our one pointer.\n\n582\n00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:22.590\nSo A talks about creating a common service\noperation activity of monitoring and\n\n583\n00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.080\ncontrol to support availability and\ncapacity management.\n\n584\n00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:26.896\nWhat about the rest of the processes?\n\n585\n00:36:26.896 --> 00:36:29.102\n[LAUGH] What about them?\n\n586\n00:36:29.102 --> 00:36:32.403\nOkay, we wanna implement capacity and\navailability management, but\n\n587\n00:36:32.403 --> 00:36:34.170\nwhat about the rest of the processes?\n\n588\n00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.485\nWe're gonna just ignore them?\n\n589\n00:36:35.485 --> 00:36:38.791\nRe-deploying technical staff\nto the operations bridge and\n\n590\n00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:42.107\ntrain them to support\nthe additional monitoring workload.\n\n591\n00:36:42.107 --> 00:36:43.808\nWow, this is not going to work,\n\n592\n00:36:43.808 --> 00:36:47.718\nif we haven't brought in the data\ncenter manager, if he's not on board,\n\n593\n00:36:47.718 --> 00:36:51.717\nand we haven't considered him just yet,\nwell, this is never gonna work.\n\n594\n00:36:51.717 --> 00:36:54.420\nOkay, he's not gonna accept\nthe additional workload,\n\n595\n00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.850\nhe's already set his resistance to change.\n\n596\n00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.380\nOnce tools and stuff are centralized,\nthere's an assumption.\n\n597\n00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.270\nImmediately evaluate tools against both\nbusiness and technical requirements.\n\n598\n00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.280\nWe need to do that before\nwe make any move, surely.\n\n599\n00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.400\nSurely, we've put in the cart\nbefore the host there.\n\n600\n00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.400\nThat doesn't really make any sense.\n\n601\n00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:18.885\nAnd it certainly doesn't meet\nthe needs of the scenario.\n\n602\n00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:24.610\nConfigure these tools to me, we're coming\non down this wrong path [LAUGH] aren't we?\n\n603\n00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:28.920\nConfiguring tools and procedures to meet\nthe requirements of availability and\n\n604\n00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.970\ncapacity management in addition\nto the data already collected.\n\n605\n00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.780\nWhat about everything else?\n\n606\n00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:41.270\nIf we want to move everything\nto the operations bridge,\n\n607\n00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:42.770\nwhat about everything else.\n\n608\n00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.760\nWe can't just focus on availability and\ncapacity.\n\n609\n00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:51.407\nOkay, let's take a look then at B,\nwhich is our distractor.\n\n610\n00:37:51.407 --> 00:37:55.690\nMonitoring needs are developed by\neach group for specific purposes.\n\n611\n00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.250\nSo the associated monitoring and\n\n612\n00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:01.590\ncontrol activities should be\nretained within each department.\n\n613\n00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:08.150\nIt always makes more sense to centralize\nand to ensure consistency as well.\n\n614\n00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.720\nAnd of course it helps with training too.\n\n615\n00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.530\nSo that doesn't work.\n\n616\n00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.160\nAvailability and\ncapacity are not operational processes.\n\n617\n00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.130\nYes they are.\n\n618\n00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:23.319\nSure, they belong in service design, and\nwe do availability and capacity planning.\n\n619\n00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.064\nBut, both availability and\ncapacity management are split into two.\n\n620\n00:38:28.064 --> 00:38:31.800\nThey're split into the reactive part,\nwhich is planning, but\n\n621\n00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:37.430\nthey also have the operational side that\nassists with incidents and problems.\n\n622\n00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:40.280\nSo, that's a very much\nan incorrect statement.\n\n623\n00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.550\nJust because they belong in service\ndesign doesn't mean that they have any\n\n624\n00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:44.990\ninvolvement in operations.\n\n625\n00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:48.260\nLook at service level management,\nfor example.\n\n626\n00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.840\nEstablishing a team for availability and\ncapacity management report,\n\n627\n00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.240\ninto the AP manager.\n\n628\n00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.235\nThat's kind of what the project\nteam should be doing, right?\n\n629\n00:38:59.235 --> 00:39:01.350\nThat's not necessarily\naddressing any concerns,\n\n630\n00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:03.330\nit's just what the project\nteam are already doing.\n\n631\n00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.030\nAnd defining data input from\noperational departments, and\n\n632\n00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:12.700\nagree with the data center to have\nreports submitted as required.\n\n633\n00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.270\nYou kind of telling them what to do there,\naren't you?\n\n634\n00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.008\nAnd I don't like that,\nand if I don't like it,\n\n635\n00:39:19.008 --> 00:39:22.860\nI'm pretty sure that the data center\nmanager is not gonna like it.\n\n636\n00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.331\nAnd if you want him on board, this is\nnot the way to get him on board, okay.\n\n637\n00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:32.419\nOkay, so, we've been through in\nthe last two sessions sample\n\n638\n00:39:32.419 --> 00:39:38.310\npaper one from ITIL service operation,\nthe life cycle phase.\n\n639\n00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.710\nAnd it's at this point in time now\nwhere I encourage you to go and\n\n640\n00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.670\nto look at sample paper two.\n\n641\n00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.860\nJust remember that our forum\nis always available for you.\n\n642\n00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:55.890\nYou're always able to reach either myself\nor one of the experts here at ITPro.TV and\n\n643\n00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:59.980\nwe will be able to help you\nwith any issues that you have.\n\n644\n00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.760\nBut for now,\n\n645\n00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:07.600\nplease take the time to review all of the\nnotes from all of the previous sessions.\n\n646\n00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.519\nDon't forget to download your exam\nvoucher and good luck with your test.\n\n647\n00:40:11.519 -->
