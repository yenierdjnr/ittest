          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.873\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:07.709\nHi and welcome to ITPRO.TV,\nmy name is Jo Peacock, and\n\n3\n00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:13.190\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL Intermediate.\n\n4\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.543\nSo let's take a look then at\nour first slide here coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:18.543 --> 00:00:22.418\nAnd we have our introduction\nto our Intermediate class and\n\n6\n00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming Intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.340\nYou will see what we will cover\nis an introduction to the class,\n\n8\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.100\nfollowed by the principles and\nthe processes of the Lifecycle phase.\n\n9\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550\nThen we'll take a look at organizing for\nthat Lifecycle phase.\n\n10\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.500\nAnd also the technology considerations,\n\n11\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270\nespecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n12\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.528\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand the critical success factors and\n\n13\n00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:57.110\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith a particular Lifecycle phase.\n\n14\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.850\nAnd most importantly of course for\nyou, is that preparation for\n\n15\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.980\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class.\n\n16\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.670\nSo let me take a look now then at how\nwe're going to approach this particular\n\n17\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.790\nIntermediate class.\n\n18\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work,\n\n19\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.550\nobviously you're going to be watching us\non screen, both myself and my colleagues.\n\n20\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110\nAnd we're going to be taking you through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n21\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.450\nAnd then there are going to be some\ndiscussions and some exercises that\n\n22\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.140\nare going to be based primarily in our\nchatrooms and also in our forums as well.\n\n23\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.530\nAnd we're also available if you want\nto undertake any of the assessments.\n\n24\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.970\nThen please feel free to come\nback to us via the forums and\n\n25\n00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.270\nwe will be able to help\nyou out in any way we can.\n\n26\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.950\nAlso provided in the course\nmaterial which is available for\n\n27\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.390\nyou to download, are mock tests or\nexams if you prefer to use that word.\n\n28\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.720\nAnd we will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you,\n\n29\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.770\nso where are we then at\nITIL Intermediate level?\n\n30\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.460\nWell, you'll see in using Bloom's\ntaxonomy that we are actually at level\n\n31\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.090\nfour analyzing.\n\n32\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.860\nIn other words, we've done a foundation\nlevel, we've done the remembering and\n\n33\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.470\nthe understanding of those\nconcepts within ITIL.\n\n34\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.160\nAnd we're actually moving through\napplying those concepts to\n\n35\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.020\nanalyzing those concepts.\n\n36\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.240\nAnd being able to apply\nthe ITIL processes and\n\n37\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.080\nalso the concepts at a real world\nlevel in a real world situation, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:43.590\nSo where does ITIL come from then,\nwell let me give you a little\n\n39\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.330\nbit of a background, it's actually\nowned by a company called Axelos.\n\n40\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.361\nAnd it was first published in\nthe mid-1980s by the UK Government,\n\n41\n00:02:54.361 --> 00:03:00.910\nand the Office of Government Commerce\nowned ITIL for a very, very long time.\n\n42\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.346\nAnd we developed ITIL right,\nway back from the 1980s through it's\n\n43\n00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:12.430\nVersion 2 in the mid 1990's to\nVersion 3 which was released in 2007.\n\n44\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.652\nAnd then there was\nan update to Version 3 in\n\n45\n00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:21.598\n2011 which is exactly\nwhere we are right now.\n\n46\n00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:23.410\nIt is copyrighted,\n\n47\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.670\nit is trademark protected,\nit's a framework for managing services.\n\n48\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.160\nAnd as such,\nit is a flexible framework that\n\n49\n00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.000\nwe would expect any organization\nto adapt as a framework, but\n\n50\n00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.680\nthen to adapt it to suit your needs, okay.\n\n51\n00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.773\nITIL was born way back in the 1980s out\nof a desire to be able to demonstrate\n\n52\n00:03:47.773 --> 00:03:54.340\nvalue for money and efficiency for\nthe use of taxpayers money within the UK.\n\n53\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.860\nWay back in the 1980s, these things\nstarted appearing on desks and\n\n54\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.900\nquite frankly.\n\n55\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.368\nWe didn't know how to manage these\nin an unbiased, in an impartial and\n\n56\n00:04:05.368 --> 00:04:10.420\nin an efficient and effective way,\nand thus ITIL was born.\n\n57\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.167\nAnd ITIL was born from a group of\nindustry experts that went out\n\n58\n00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:17.093\ninto the big wide world.\n\n59\n00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:21.785\nAnd analyzed various organizations from\nvarious different industry sectors,\n\n60\n00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:26.690\nnot just government, but we're talking\nfinance, we're talking retail and etc.\n\n61\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.238\nAnd they came back with\na set of best practices\n\n62\n00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:35.188\nthat they observed in the real world for\n\n63\n00:04:35.188 --> 00:04:40.223\nmanaging our IT services,\nand thus we have ITIL.\n\n64\n00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:44.770\nAs I've already said,\nwe've had subsequent revisions, and\n\n65\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.800\nnow we're off to Version 3, 2011.\n\n66\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.240\nSo we work on the understanding that\nwe have to every single service.\n\n67\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.960\nAnd we start off with a concept\nin service strategy and\n\n68\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.600\nthen we take that concept and\nwe design it, and then we develop it.\n\n69\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.360\nAnd we deploy it as a service\ninto a live environment,\n\n70\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.520\nwhich is where we operate and\nwhere we maintain it.\n\n71\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.310\nAnd we continually seek to ensure that we\n\n72\n00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.780\nare aligned with the needs\nof the organization in CSI.\n\n73\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.040\nSo you're attending this class\nbecause you probably want\n\n74\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.040\nto achieve an ITIL Intermediate\nqualification.\n\n75\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.920\nSo you can see that if we were\nto start off right at the very,\n\n76\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.280\nvery top, you'll see where I am.\n\n77\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n78\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.830\nI'm also an accredited examiner and\nproctor or invigilator for these exams.\n\n79\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.020\nAnd work very, very closely with\nthe official ITIL accreditor and\n\n80\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.560\nalso Axelos who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n81\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.080\nNow, in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n82\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.130\nWell, we start off with ITIL Foundation,\nand ITIL Foundation would traditionally be\n\n83\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:20.020\na three-day classroom experience where\nwe learn the foundations of ITIL.\n\n84\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.640\nAnd we learn all the terminology and all\nof the definitions to that terminology,\n\n85\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.900\nthere's roughly round about 75 that we\nlearn within the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n86\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.560\nAnd then, as we move through, we can\n\n87\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.710\neither take an ITIL Practitioner class\nwhich can be taken at any point in time.\n\n88\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.820\nThroughout the progression\nof your career within ITIL\n\n89\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.220\nbecause ITIL practitioner focuses\non the implementation of ITIL.\n\n90\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.210\nWhereas if we take a look at the more\nadvanced intermediate classes,\n\n91\n00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.040\nyou are at this moment\nin a Lifecycle module.\n\n92\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.543\nAnd those Lifecycle modules consist\nof service strategy, service design,\n\n93\n00:06:59.543 --> 00:07:04.208\nservice transition, service operation and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n94\n00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:05.891\nAnd that's where we focus on,\n\n95\n00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:09.076\nthose lifecycles that we've\njust looked at previously.\n\n96\n00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:14.351\nOkay, and on the right-hand side then,\nwe have our Capability modules.\n\n97\n00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:22.283\nAnd these Capability modules really focus\non specific areas within ITIL such as RCV,\n\n98\n00:07:22.283 --> 00:07:27.253\nwhich focuses on release,\ncontrol and validation.\n\n99\n00:07:27.253 --> 00:07:32.063\nAnd these classes, you will notice that\nevery single one of these classes has\n\n100\n00:07:32.063 --> 00:07:34.430\ngot a score right beside each one.\n\n101\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.286\nSo we've got a number 2 for\nHill Foundation and we've got a three for\n\n102\n00:07:39.286 --> 00:07:44.159\nLifecycle modules and we've got a four for\nour Capability modules.\n\n103\n00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:49.364\nNow what we need to do is\nensure that we have achieved\n\n104\n00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:55.055\na minimum of 15 credits at\nboth either the Lifecycle or\n\n105\n00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:57.852\nCapability module level.\n\n106\n00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:03.312\nIn order to be able to qualify to sit\nthe managing cross the Lifecycle class and\n\n107\n00:08:03.312 --> 00:08:08.665\ntherefore subsequently,\nthe test that goes along with that class.\n\n108\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:13.065\nSo we need to take two from the ITIL\nFoundation, that's a prerequisite,\n\n109\n00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:14.905\nwe have to do the foundation.\n\n110\n00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:19.500\nAnd then we need to add in\nanother 15 scores from either,\n\n111\n00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.650\nas I've said, the Lifecycle or\nthe Capability stream.\n\n112\n00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.960\nNow you can interchange, you can mix and\n\n113\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.100\nmatch, you do not have to stick\nto one stream or the other.\n\n114\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.215\nOnce you've got that 17 in total scores\n\n115\n00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:37.165\nthat are needed to be able to sit\nmanaging across the Lifecycle.\n\n116\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:41.345\nYou're perfectly able to sit\nthat Lifecycle class and\n\n117\n00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.845\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n118\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.145\nAnd as soon as you've taken that test\nyou will be awarded those five credits,\n\n119\n00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:52.535\nwhich will mean that you\nhave achieved ITIL expert.\n\n120\n00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:57.240\nNow ITIL expert is allocated\nas soon as you have passed\n\n121\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.510\nthe Managing across the Lifecycle test and\nhave achieved 22 credits.\n\n122\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.770\nBoth of those must happen in order for\nyou to achieve ITIL expert.\n\n123\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.090\nNow, we have the ITIL Master\nqualification,\n\n124\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.630\nand the ITIL Master is\na completely different beast,\n\n125\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.220\nthe ITIL Master is\na two-year qualification.\n\n126\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.750\nAnd during that two years, you will be\nexpected to submit various white papers\n\n127\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.500\non specific topics within\nthe ITIL qualification scheme.\n\n128\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.166\nSo, these could be topics\non activities within ITIL,\n\n129\n00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:38.830\nthese could be topics or\nprocesses within ITIL.\n\n130\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.810\nThese could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n131\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.860\nBut you will be required to sit\na number of white papers or\n\n132\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.410\nsubmit a number of white papers\nover the period of two years.\n\n133\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.520\nAt the end of those two years once\nyou have submitted the prerequisite\n\n134\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers, then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n135\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.220\nAnd during that panel interview you\nwill be assessed not only on your white\n\n136\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.597\npapers but also on your experience\nwithin the IT service management arena.\n\n137\n00:10:11.597 --> 00:10:15.330\nAnd at the end of that panel\ninterview then if successful,\n\n138\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.020\nyou will be awarded\nthe status of IT Master.\n\n139\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.700\nSo the qualification scheme,\n\n140\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.340\nI'm going to take this back\nnow to Bloom's Taxonomy then.\n\n141\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.360\nAnd just very, very quickly look at\nthe fact that in ITIL Foundation, and\n\n142\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.560\nI know that I've already covered\nthis in a previous slide.\n\n143\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.700\nWe just looked at understanding\nthe terminology and\n\n144\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.150\nthe concepts of ITIL Foundation.\n\n145\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.300\nAnd then in that Lifecycle Modules,\n\n146\n00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.750\nwe're looking at implementing those\nprocesses contained within ITIL.\n\n147\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.990\nAnd in Capability, we're looking at\nactually undertaking those processes and\n\n148\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.330\nmanaging those processes,\nwas Managing across the Lifecycle.\n\n149\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:02.090\nThis is for senior management, this is at\nCIO level and at senior management level.\n\n150\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.905\nAnd in MALC,\nas we like to abbreviate it to,\n\n151\n00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:10.475\nyou're concerned with leading\nIT service management.\n\n152\n00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:15.385\nSo I mentioned right at the very beginning\nof all of this that we had a test\n\n153\n00:11:15.385 --> 00:11:20.735\nto go along with every single\nLifecycle phase and there is.\n\n154\n00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:25.429\nAnd we will be conducting a session to\ngo all over this particular test or\n\n155\n00:11:25.429 --> 00:11:27.631\nat least a sample of these tests.\n\n156\n00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:32.960\nJust to give you some preparation for\nthe actual test itself.\n\n157\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.600\nSo, your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually,\n\n158\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:46.390\nit is an eight multiple choice question\ntest, it's complex multiple choice.\n\n159\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.440\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test and\n\n160\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.640\nwith every single question,\nyou will be given a scenario.\n\n161\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.910\nAnd then you will be given four possible\noptions for possible answers for\n\n162\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:04.548\nthe question that is posed\nalong with that scenario.\n\n163\n00:12:04.548 --> 00:12:09.176\nYou get five points for the best fit\nanswer, now it mentions up there, the most\n\n164\n00:12:09.176 --> 00:12:13.910\ncorrect, I always call it the best fit\nbecause every single question asks.\n\n165\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.300\nWhat is the best answer,\ngiven the scenario and given the question?\n\n166\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.350\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct\n\n167\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.380\nbecause the question is asking you for\nthe best fit.\n\n168\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.080\nAnd for that best fit,\nyou're gonna get five points, for\n\n169\n00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.630\nthe next best fit, you're gonna get three.\n\n170\n00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:40.740\nFor the next one, which we've\nconsidered to be the least correct,\n\n171\n00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.070\nyou're gonna get 1, and for\nthe next one, you're gonna get a 0.\n\n172\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.110\nNow it mentions up on that slide there\nthat the next one is 0 marks for\n\n173\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.080\nincorrect.\n\n174\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.802\nIn the industry, us and all,\nwe like to call that the distractor, and\n\n175\n00:12:55.802 --> 00:13:00.600\nwe call it the distractor for\na reason, cuz it distracts.\n\n176\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.727\nAnd quite often, what you will find is,\n\n177\n00:13:02.727 --> 00:13:05.810\n[LAUGH] With your distractor,\na lot of the words in the terminology.\n\n178\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:10.810\nThat are taken straight of the ITIL books,\nstraight out of the publications,\n\n179\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.298\nand are input into that zero pointer\nbecause it's there to distract.\n\n180\n00:13:15.298 --> 00:13:20.797\nAnd it sounds great, but\nmore often than not, that distractor\n\n181\n00:13:20.797 --> 00:13:26.600\nhas absolutely no relevance to\nthe scenario or to the question.\n\n182\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.480\nSo you have to be incredibly careful with\nthat, it's so easy to be distracted.\n\n183\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.370\nYou have to get 28 out of a possible\n40 in order to be able to pass and\n\n184\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.540\nachieve accreditation at\nany lifecycle test, okay.\n\n185\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.640\nIf English is not your first language,\nyou are allowed a paper dictionary.\n\n186\n00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.386\nBut you will be asked to show that\nto the proctor at the time that\n\n187\n00:13:53.386 --> 00:13:55.650\nyou take your test.\n\n188\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:02.579\nAnd as I've already said, you have to\nhave an ITIL Foundation in Version 3 or\n\n189\n00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:09.310\nVersion 3 2011 or an ITIL Version\n2 Foundation Bridge to Version 3.\n\n190\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:15.450\nI will be very, very honest with you,\nthere are not that many people that have\n\n191\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.580\nattained the Version 2\nto Version 3 Bridge.\n\n192\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:25.800\nAnd most people will have the Version\n3 2011 ITIL Foundation certificate.\n\n193\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.572\nYou will be required to\nupload that certificate to\n\n194\n00:14:31.572 --> 00:14:36.378\nthe examining board prior to\nsitting your lifecycle test.\n\n195\n00:14:36.378 --> 00:14:38.847\nSo be prepared with that,\n\n196\n00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:44.134\nyou will need to have it at hand and\nsaved as a PDF as well.\n\n197\n00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:49.635\nSo when we come to the end of\nevery single lifecycle class and\n\n198\n00:14:49.635 --> 00:14:56.410\nthis one's no exception,\nwe'll be going over a sample test for you.\n\n199\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.670\nAnd during that sample test I'll\nbe giving you lots of hints and\n\n200\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.150\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n201\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.090\nAnd also how to ensure that you read\nthe full question, how to relax.\n\n202\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:13.200\nAnd to make sure that you\napproach it with an open mind but\n\n203\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.100\nyou consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n204\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.610\nUltimately, we wanna get you\npass the test just as much as\n\n205\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.760\nyou want to achieve that accreditation.\n\n206\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:31.550\nSo just to sum up, what we will\nbe doing over the next few shows\n\n207\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:37.460\nis encouraging you to take your\nITIL Lifecycle Intermediate classes.\n\n208\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.992\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n",
