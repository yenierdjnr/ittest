          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.873\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:07.709\nHi and welcome to ITPRO.TV,\nmy name is Jo Peacock, and\n\n3\n00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:13.190\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL Intermediate.\n\n4\n00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.543\nSo let's take a look then at\nour first slide here coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:18.543 --> 00:00:22.418\nAnd we have our introduction\nto our Intermediate class and\n\n6\n00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming Intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.340\nYou will see what we will cover\nis an introduction to the class,\n\n8\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.100\nfollowed by the principles and\nthe processes of the Lifecycle phase.\n\n9\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550\nThen we'll take a look at organizing for\nthat Lifecycle phase.\n\n10\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.500\nAnd also the technology considerations,\n\n11\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270\nespecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n12\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.528\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand the critical success factors and\n\n13\n00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:57.110\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith a particular Lifecycle phase.\n\n14\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.850\nAnd most importantly of course for\nyou, is that preparation for\n\n15\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.980\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class.\n\n16\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.670\nSo let me take a look now then at how\nwe're going to approach this particular\n\n17\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.790\nIntermediate class.\n\n18\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work,\n\n19\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.550\nobviously you're going to be watching us\non screen, both myself and my colleagues.\n\n20\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110\nAnd we're going to be taking you through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n21\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.450\nAnd then there are going to be some\ndiscussions and some exercises that\n\n22\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.140\nare going to be based primarily in our\nchatrooms and also in our forums as well.\n\n23\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.530\nAnd we're also available if you want\nto undertake any of the assessments.\n\n24\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.970\nThen please feel free to come\nback to us via the forums and\n\n25\n00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.270\nwe will be able to help\nyou out in any way we can.\n\n26\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.950\nAlso provided in the course\nmaterial which is available for\n\n27\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.390\nyou to download, are mock tests or\nexams if you prefer to use that word.\n\n28\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.720\nAnd we will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you,\n\n29\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.770\nso where are we then at\nITIL Intermediate level?\n\n30\n00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.460\nWell, you'll see in using Bloom's\ntaxonomy that we are actually at level\n\n31\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.090\nfour analyzing.\n\n32\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.860\nIn other words, we've done a foundation\nlevel, we've done the remembering and\n\n33\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.470\nthe understanding of those\nconcepts within ITIL.\n\n34\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.160\nAnd we're actually moving through\napplying those concepts to\n\n35\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.020\nanalyzing those concepts.\n\n36\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.240\nAnd being able to apply\nthe ITIL processes and\n\n37\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.080\nalso the concepts at a real world\nlevel in a real world situation, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:43.590\nSo where does ITIL come from then,\nwell let me give you a little\n\n39\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.330\nbit of a background, it's actually\nowned by a company called Axelos.\n\n40\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.361\nAnd it was first published in\nthe mid-1980s by the UK Government,\n\n41\n00:02:54.361 --> 00:03:00.910\nand the Office of Government Commerce\nowned ITIL for a very, very long time.\n\n42\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.346\nAnd we developed ITIL right,\nway back from the 1980s through it's\n\n43\n00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:12.430\nVersion 2 in the mid 1990's to\nVersion 3 which was released in 2007.\n\n44\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.652\nAnd then there was\nan update to Version 3 in\n\n45\n00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:21.598\n2011 which is exactly\nwhere we are right now.\n\n46\n00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:23.410\nIt is copyrighted,\n\n47\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.670\nit is trademark protected,\nit's a framework for managing services.\n\n48\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.160\nAnd as such,\nit is a flexible framework that\n\n49\n00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.000\nwe would expect any organization\nto adapt as a framework, but\n\n50\n00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.680\nthen to adapt it to suit your needs, okay.\n\n51\n00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.773\nITIL was born way back in the 1980s out\nof a desire to be able to demonstrate\n\n52\n00:03:47.773 --> 00:03:54.340\nvalue for money and efficiency for\nthe use of taxpayers money within the UK.\n\n53\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.860\nWay back in the 1980s, these things\nstarted appearing on desks and\n\n54\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.900\nquite frankly.\n\n55\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.368\nWe didn't know how to manage these\nin an unbiased, in an impartial and\n\n56\n00:04:05.368 --> 00:04:10.420\nin an efficient and effective way,\nand thus ITIL was born.\n\n57\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.167\nAnd ITIL was born from a group of\nindustry experts that went out\n\n58\n00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:17.093\ninto the big wide world.\n\n59\n00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:21.785\nAnd analyzed various organizations from\nvarious different industry sectors,\n\n60\n00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:26.690\nnot just government, but we're talking\nfinance, we're talking retail and etc.\n\n61\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.238\nAnd they came back with\na set of best practices\n\n62\n00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:35.188\nthat they observed in the real world for\n\n63\n00:04:35.188 --> 00:04:40.223\nmanaging our IT services,\nand thus we have ITIL.\n\n64\n00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:44.770\nAs I've already said,\nwe've had subsequent revisions, and\n\n65\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.800\nnow we're off to Version 3, 2011.\n\n66\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.240\nSo we work on the understanding that\nwe have to every single service.\n\n67\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.960\nAnd we start off with a concept\nin service strategy and\n\n68\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.600\nthen we take that concept and\nwe design it, and then we develop it.\n\n69\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.360\nAnd we deploy it as a service\ninto a live environment,\n\n70\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.520\nwhich is where we operate and\nwhere we maintain it.\n\n71\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.310\nAnd we continually seek to ensure that we\n\n72\n00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.780\nare aligned with the needs\nof the organization in CSI.\n\n73\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.040\nSo you're attending this class\nbecause you probably want\n\n74\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.040\nto achieve an ITIL Intermediate\nqualification.\n\n75\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.920\nSo you can see that if we were\nto start off right at the very,\n\n76\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.280\nvery top, you'll see where I am.\n\n77\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n78\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.830\nI'm also an accredited examiner and\nproctor or invigilator for these exams.\n\n79\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.020\nAnd work very, very closely with\nthe official ITIL accreditor and\n\n80\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.560\nalso Axelos who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n81\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.080\nNow, in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n82\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.130\nWell, we start off with ITIL Foundation,\nand ITIL Foundation would traditionally be\n\n83\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:20.020\na three-day classroom experience where\nwe learn the foundations of ITIL.\n\n84\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.640\nAnd we learn all the terminology and all\nof the definitions to that terminology,\n\n85\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.900\nthere's roughly round about 75 that we\nlearn within the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n86\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.560\nAnd then, as we move through, we can\n\n87\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.710\neither take an ITIL Practitioner class\nwhich can be taken at any point in time.\n\n88\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.820\nThroughout the progression\nof your career within ITIL\n\n89\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.220\nbecause ITIL practitioner focuses\non the implementation of ITIL.\n\n90\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.210\nWhereas if we take a look at the more\nadvanced intermediate classes,\n\n91\n00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.040\nyou are at this moment\nin a Lifecycle module.\n\n92\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.543\nAnd those Lifecycle modules consist\nof service strategy, service design,\n\n93\n00:06:59.543 --> 00:07:04.208\nservice transition, service operation and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n94\n00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:05.891\nAnd that's where we focus on,\n\n95\n00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:09.076\nthose lifecycles that we've\njust looked at previously.\n\n96\n00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:14.351\nOkay, and on the right-hand side then,\nwe have our Capability modules.\n\n97\n00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:22.283\nAnd these Capability modules really focus\non specific areas within ITIL such as RCV,\n\n98\n00:07:22.283 --> 00:07:27.253\nwhich focuses on release,\ncontrol and validation.\n\n99\n00:07:27.253 --> 00:07:32.063\nAnd these classes, you will notice that\nevery single one of these classes has\n\n100\n00:07:32.063 --> 00:07:34.430\ngot a score right beside each one.\n\n101\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.286\nSo we've got a number 2 for\nHill Foundation and we've got a three for\n\n102\n00:07:39.286 --> 00:07:44.159\nLifecycle modules and we've got a four for\nour Capability modules.\n\n103\n00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:49.364\nNow what we need to do is\nensure that we have achieved\n\n104\n00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:55.055\na minimum of 15 credits at\nboth either the Lifecycle or\n\n105\n00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:57.852\nCapability module level.\n\n106\n00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:03.312\nIn order to be able to qualify to sit\nthe managing cross the Lifecycle class and\n\n107\n00:08:03.312 --> 00:08:08.665\ntherefore subsequently,\nthe test that goes along with that class.\n\n108\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:13.065\nSo we need to take two from the ITIL\nFoundation, that's a prerequisite,\n\n109\n00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:14.905\nwe have to do the foundation.\n\n110\n00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:19.500\nAnd then we need to add in\nanother 15 scores from either,\n\n111\n00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.650\nas I've said, the Lifecycle or\nthe Capability stream.\n\n112\n00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.960\nNow you can interchange, you can mix and\n\n113\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.100\nmatch, you do not have to stick\nto one stream or the other.\n\n114\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.215\nOnce you've got that 17 in total scores\n\n115\n00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:37.165\nthat are needed to be able to sit\nmanaging across the Lifecycle.\n\n116\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:41.345\nYou're perfectly able to sit\nthat Lifecycle class and\n\n117\n00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.845\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n118\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.145\nAnd as soon as you've taken that test\nyou will be awarded those five credits,\n\n119\n00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:52.535\nwhich will mean that you\nhave achieved ITIL expert.\n\n120\n00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:57.240\nNow ITIL expert is allocated\nas soon as you have passed\n\n121\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.510\nthe Managing across the Lifecycle test and\nhave achieved 22 credits.\n\n122\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.770\nBoth of those must happen in order for\nyou to achieve ITIL expert.\n\n123\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.090\nNow, we have the ITIL Master\nqualification,\n\n124\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.630\nand the ITIL Master is\na completely different beast,\n\n125\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.220\nthe ITIL Master is\na two-year qualification.\n\n126\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.750\nAnd during that two years, you will be\nexpected to submit various white papers\n\n127\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.500\non specific topics within\nthe ITIL qualification scheme.\n\n128\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.166\nSo, these could be topics\non activities within ITIL,\n\n129\n00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:38.830\nthese could be topics or\nprocesses within ITIL.\n\n130\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.810\nThese could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n131\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.860\nBut you will be required to sit\na number of white papers or\n\n132\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.410\nsubmit a number of white papers\nover the period of two years.\n\n133\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.520\nAt the end of those two years once\nyou have submitted the prerequisite\n\n134\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers, then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n135\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.220\nAnd during that panel interview you\nwill be assessed not only on your white\n\n136\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.597\npapers but also on your experience\nwithin the IT service management arena.\n\n137\n00:10:11.597 --> 00:10:15.330\nAnd at the end of that panel\ninterview then if successful,\n\n138\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.020\nyou will be awarded\nthe status of IT Master.\n\n139\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.700\nSo the qualification scheme,\n\n140\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.340\nI'm going to take this back\nnow to Bloom's Taxonomy then.\n\n141\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.360\nAnd just very, very quickly look at\nthe fact that in ITIL Foundation, and\n\n142\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.560\nI know that I've already covered\nthis in a previous slide.\n\n143\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.700\nWe just looked at understanding\nthe terminology and\n\n144\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.150\nthe concepts of ITIL Foundation.\n\n145\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.300\nAnd then in that Lifecycle Modules,\n\n146\n00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.750\nwe're looking at implementing those\nprocesses contained within ITIL.\n\n147\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.990\nAnd in Capability, we're looking at\nactually undertaking those processes and\n\n148\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.330\nmanaging those processes,\nwas Managing across the Lifecycle.\n\n149\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:02.090\nThis is for senior management, this is at\nCIO level and at senior management level.\n\n150\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.905\nAnd in MALC,\nas we like to abbreviate it to,\n\n151\n00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:10.475\nyou're concerned with leading\nIT service management.\n\n152\n00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:15.385\nSo I mentioned right at the very beginning\nof all of this that we had a test\n\n153\n00:11:15.385 --> 00:11:20.735\nto go along with every single\nLifecycle phase and there is.\n\n154\n00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:25.429\nAnd we will be conducting a session to\ngo all over this particular test or\n\n155\n00:11:25.429 --> 00:11:27.631\nat least a sample of these tests.\n\n156\n00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:32.960\nJust to give you some preparation for\nthe actual test itself.\n\n157\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.600\nSo, your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually,\n\n158\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:46.390\nit is an eight multiple choice question\ntest, it's complex multiple choice.\n\n159\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.440\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test and\n\n160\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.640\nwith every single question,\nyou will be given a scenario.\n\n161\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.910\nAnd then you will be given four possible\noptions for possible answers for\n\n162\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:04.548\nthe question that is posed\nalong with that scenario.\n\n163\n00:12:04.548 --> 00:12:09.176\nYou get five points for the best fit\nanswer, now it mentions up there, the most\n\n164\n00:12:09.176 --> 00:12:13.910\ncorrect, I always call it the best fit\nbecause every single question asks.\n\n165\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.300\nWhat is the best answer,\ngiven the scenario and given the question?\n\n166\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.350\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct\n\n167\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.380\nbecause the question is asking you for\nthe best fit.\n\n168\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.080\nAnd for that best fit,\nyou're gonna get five points, for\n\n169\n00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.630\nthe next best fit, you're gonna get three.\n\n170\n00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:40.740\nFor the next one, which we've\nconsidered to be the least correct,\n\n171\n00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.070\nyou're gonna get 1, and for\nthe next one, you're gonna get a 0.\n\n172\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.110\nNow it mentions up on that slide there\nthat the next one is 0 marks for\n\n173\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.080\nincorrect.\n\n174\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.802\nIn the industry, us and all,\nwe like to call that the distractor, and\n\n175\n00:12:55.802 --> 00:13:00.600\nwe call it the distractor for\na reason, cuz it distracts.\n\n176\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.727\nAnd quite often, what you will find is,\n\n177\n00:13:02.727 --> 00:13:05.810\n[LAUGH] With your distractor,\na lot of the words in the terminology.\n\n178\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:10.810\nThat are taken straight of the ITIL books,\nstraight out of the publications,\n\n179\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.298\nand are input into that zero pointer\nbecause it's there to distract.\n\n180\n00:13:15.298 --> 00:13:20.797\nAnd it sounds great, but\nmore often than not, that distractor\n\n181\n00:13:20.797 --> 00:13:26.600\nhas absolutely no relevance to\nthe scenario or to the question.\n\n182\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.480\nSo you have to be incredibly careful with\nthat, it's so easy to be distracted.\n\n183\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.370\nYou have to get 28 out of a possible\n40 in order to be able to pass and\n\n184\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.540\nachieve accreditation at\nany lifecycle test, okay.\n\n185\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.640\nIf English is not your first language,\nyou are allowed a paper dictionary.\n\n186\n00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.386\nBut you will be asked to show that\nto the proctor at the time that\n\n187\n00:13:53.386 --> 00:13:55.650\nyou take your test.\n\n188\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:02.579\nAnd as I've already said, you have to\nhave an ITIL Foundation in Version 3 or\n\n189\n00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:09.310\nVersion 3 2011 or an ITIL Version\n2 Foundation Bridge to Version 3.\n\n190\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:15.450\nI will be very, very honest with you,\nthere are not that many people that have\n\n191\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.580\nattained the Version 2\nto Version 3 Bridge.\n\n192\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:25.800\nAnd most people will have the Version\n3 2011 ITIL Foundation certificate.\n\n193\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.572\nYou will be required to\nupload that certificate to\n\n194\n00:14:31.572 --> 00:14:36.378\nthe examining board prior to\nsitting your lifecycle test.\n\n195\n00:14:36.378 --> 00:14:38.847\nSo be prepared with that,\n\n196\n00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:44.134\nyou will need to have it at hand and\nsaved as a PDF as well.\n\n197\n00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:49.635\nSo when we come to the end of\nevery single lifecycle class and\n\n198\n00:14:49.635 --> 00:14:56.410\nthis one's no exception,\nwe'll be going over a sample test for you.\n\n199\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.670\nAnd during that sample test I'll\nbe giving you lots of hints and\n\n200\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.150\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n201\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.090\nAnd also how to ensure that you read\nthe full question, how to relax.\n\n202\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:13.200\nAnd to make sure that you\napproach it with an open mind but\n\n203\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.100\nyou consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n204\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.610\nUltimately, we wanna get you\npass the test just as much as\n\n205\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.760\nyou want to achieve that accreditation.\n\n206\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:31.550\nSo just to sum up, what we will\nbe doing over the next few shows\n\n207\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:37.460\nis encouraging you to take your\nITIL Lifecycle Intermediate classes.\n\n208\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.992\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n",

00:00:15.902\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:20.760\nYou're watching an ITIL Foundation\nRefresher for your intermediate class.\n\n5\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.900\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n6\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.390\nwe're about to get started here with\nour maestro in ITIL, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n7\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.820\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.520\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie, pleased to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.260\nHow are you?\n\n10\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.190\n&gt;&gt; We are doing great today, Jo.\n\n11\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.030\nAs we begin, we understand that\nfoundations pretty much set the tone for\n\n12\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.570\neverything that we'll be\ntaking a look at here.\n\n13\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.840\nSo, having this refresher at this\npoint in our class that we're doing,\n\n14\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.790\nis gonna be a great opportunity for us to\nmake sure we cement those concepts down.\n\n15\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.740\nSo, where are we gonna begin Jo?\n\n16\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.130\n&gt;&gt; What we're doing today in this\nparticular session is we're going to be\n\n17\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.530\ngoing over what everyone learnt\nduring the ITL foundation class.\n\n18\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.120\nYou see, we cover lots and lots of topics\nin every single intermediate class,\n\n19\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.800\nwhether it be the lifecycle classes,\nwhich the service operation is one.\n\n20\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.690\nOr whether it be the capability classes,\nsuch as release, Control, Validation, etc.\n\n21\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.130\nOr even through to the MALC Class that\nmanaging across the life cycle or\n\n22\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.750\nthe ITIL practitioner class, we need\nto understand that foundation material\n\n23\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.050\nbecause it's foundation and it is the\nfoundation for all of our other material.\n\n24\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.430\nNow, in our foundation class in ITIL\nwe learn all of the terminology that's\n\n25\n00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.610\nassociated with ITIL and over 75 terms and\ndefinitions in the ITIL foundation class.\n\n26\n00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.010\nAnd I'll be honest with you,\n\n27\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.620\nsometimes the ITIL Foundation class\ncan be a little bit daunting.\n\n28\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.580\nCertainly, the feedback\nthat you get from a lot of\n\n29\n00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.370\ndelegates watching ITIL Foundation is that\n\n30\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.770\nthey feel like their brains will fall\nout at the end of the first day.\n\n31\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.090\nSo, what we're going to do really, and we\ndo this at the start start of every single\n\n32\n00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.620\nintermediate class is we will just\ngo over the foundation principles\n\n33\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.850\njust to refresh them in everybody's mind,\nand then to act as a basis for\n\n34\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.520\nwhat we are going to cover\nover the following sessions.\n\n35\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.040\nAnd so, here what we are going to do over\nthe next few sessions is we are going to\n\n36\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.380\ngo over the ideal foundation itself.\n\n37\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.530\nAnd we going to go over\nthe concept of the life cycle etc.\n\n38\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.120\nAnd we going to be going over as\ni say the foundation material.\n\n39\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.830\n&gt;&gt; Alright Joan,\nthis is the best time to get started.\n\n40\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.000\nSo, let's go ahead and\ndo that where we can be getting?\n\n41\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthe first thing that we're going to do and\n\n42\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.190\nyou saw these slide flash out\nvery very quickly on the screen\n\n43\n00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.970\nnow and\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at that\n\n44\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.930\nfirst particular slide there.\n\n45\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.830\nIt says here ITIL is\npresented in 5 core volumes\n\n46\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.740\nthat are referred to as\na service lifecycle.\n\n47\n00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.910\nLet's take a step back.\n\n48\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.460\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I want to do.\n\n49\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.990\nLet's just think about the fact\nthat a service, an IT service,\n\n50\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.600\nand we're gonna come into the definition\nof a service very shortly, but\n\n51\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.210\na service, well it has a beginning and\nit has an end.\n\n52\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.410\nIt starts off as an idea.\n\n53\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.580\nThese things don't just happen,\nyou don't just walk in and\n\n54\n00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.340\nall of a sudden everything is\nthere on your laptop okay?\n\n55\n00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.420\nAny new service,\nwell it has an idea, any service.\n\n56\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.570\nAnd that idea has got to be developed.\n\n57\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.660\nIs gonna be designed first of all then it\ngets developed and then it get tested and\n\n58\n00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.010\nthen it gets deployed and\nthen it's put into the live environment.\n\n59\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.540\nAnd then, we continually checking\nthe service to make sure that it's\n\n60\n00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.490\ndoing what it's suppose to do.\n\n61\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.890\nAnd eventually,\nthat service will be retired, so\n\n62\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.530\nwe refer to that as the life of a service.\n\n63\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.940\nAnd that's the concept of a life cycle,\nis the fact that we understand the concept\n\n64\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.520\nthat not just all of our services,\nbut also IT as a whole.\n\n65\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.360\nWell, any process starts off as an idea,\nand\n\n66\n00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.530\nthen it's designed, and\nthen developed, and then built, and\n\n67\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.130\nthen transitioned, and\nput into a live environment.\n\n68\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.660\nAnd then,\nwe want to continually improve it.\n\n69\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.710\nAnd it's the same with\nany organization and\n\n70\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.620\nwith any IT service provider,\nit starts off as an idea.\n\n71\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.210\nThings have to start off with a concept.\n\n72\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.010\nSo, what do we have is the concept\nof a service life cycle.\n\n73\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.660\nAnd we've split it into five.\n\n74\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.080\nAnd in the first book, and\nwe call them core publications or\n\n75\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.640\nbooks because they is a book for\neach life cycle phase.\n\n76\n00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.490\nAnd we start off with service strategy and\n\n77\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.570\nthen that's where our ideas\ncome from in service strategy.\n\n78\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.210\nThis is where we got back to the business\nand we understand what our business needs,\n\n79\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.880\nhow our business works, and\nhow we can add value to our business.\n\n80\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.900\nAnd then, in service design, we can\ntake that idea that we've come out with\n\n81\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.770\nin service strategy and\nwe Design that idea.\n\n82\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.750\nThis is not where we develop,\nthis is where we design the idea.\n\n83\n00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.230\nAnd then in service transition,\nthis is where we do the development, and\n\n84\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.970\nwe do the build, and the test and\nthe deployment of our new services, and\n\n85\n00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.660\nthen we deploy them into\nthe live service operation.\n\n86\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.520\nAnd then, on a regular basis we\nwant to continue re-improve.\n\n87\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.480\nSo, what I'm looking at this next slide,\nand\n\n88\n00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.670\nit will show you the process\nwithin the next slide.\n\n89\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.850\nI wanna bring a different concept for you,\n\n90\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.140\nI wanna take you just out of the IT for\na moment.\n\n91\n00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.900\nBecause in service strategy I said\nthat we come up with the idea.\n\n92\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.910\nAnd we have processes in service strategy\nsuch as financial management and\n\n93\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.790\nbusiness relationship management and\nstrategy management where\n\n94\n00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.520\nwe come up with those ideas to\nmake sure we got enough money.\n\n95\n00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.670\nAnd then, in service design,\n\n96\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.350\nwe have things like service level\nmanagement that workout our targets for\n\n97\n00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.190\nhow we're going to deliver that service,\nso this is still in design.\n\n98\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.370\nAnd then, design and availability and\ncapacity and continuity, etc.\n\n99\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.010\nAnd we've got supplier\nmanagement in there too.\n\n100\n00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.120\nNow, let's take this out of IT, as I said.\n\n101\n00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.310\nLet's say we were building a house.\n\n102\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.290\nNow, I know I've got grand ideas,\nI can tell you now.\n\n103\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.680\nI know that what I want\nis I want a five bedroom?\n\n104\n00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.520\nYeah, I reckon that'll be enough.\n\n105\n00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.160\nBut I want six bathrooms,\ncuz I need one bathroom just for\n\n106\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.770\nguests that are visiting for the day.\n\n107\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.199\nNot that anybody ever visits me, but\nnevertheless I want six bathrooms, okay?\n\n108\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.460\nAnd I don't think I need a swimming pool,\nbut I wouldn't mind\n\n109\n00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.730\nhaving a dedicated office just for me\nthat was soundproof that I could work in.\n\n110\n00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.970\nThat would be great.\n\n111\n00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.800\nOkay, that's what I want.\n\n112\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.420\nSo, what I do as sort of\nstrategy is I go to the bank and\n\n113\n00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.780\nI say can I have some money, okay.\n\n114\n00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.480\nI've got this idea,\ncan I have some money please?\n\n115\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.080\nAnd here is my idea, and\nthis is what happens in service strategy.\n\n116\n00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.820\nTowards the end of service strategy,\n\n117\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.820\nthe bank says here you go,\nhave fun, $500,000 there we go.\n\n118\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.660\nSo now, what do I do?\n\n119\n00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.780\nWhat do I do with that $500,000 directly?\n\n120\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.340\nYou just take that money, and\n\n121\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.970\nthen you'd either have it\ndesigned to be ready to build.\n\n122\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now I'll go to an architect.\n\n123\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.290\nAnd so, this is what's happening here in\nService Design is I go to an architect and\n\n124\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.940\nI say, okay,\nplease can you design me a house?\n\n125\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.720\nThese are my prerequisites.\n\n126\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.620\nAnd generally, you know what, well,\nI'm a customer I'm not a builder,\n\n127\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.910\nso I don't know anything\nabout materials but\n\n128\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.510\nwhat I do know is that I've got\nsome very specific requirements.\n\n129\n00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.980\nProbably because I'm a little bit strange,\nvery incredibly specific.\n\n130\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.604\nSo, I'm gonna go to him and I'm gonna say\nto him, I want, and five bedrooms, and\n\n131\n00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:54.424\nI want six bathrooms and I want my\nown room with a sound proof office,\n\n132\n00:07:54.424 --> 00:07:56.321\nwhere I still want a window in it.\n\n133\n00:07:56.321 --> 00:08:00.567\nI like daylight but then at the same\ntime I don't want any noise coming in.\n\n134\n00:08:00.567 --> 00:08:05.971\nAnd I want bathrooms and\nI wanna have marble in the bathrooms and.\n\n135\n00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:07.736\nThis is everything that I want.\n\n136\n00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:09.092\nAnd my kitchen.\n\n137\n00:08:09.092 --> 00:08:12.190\nI've gotta have one of those\nrefrigerators with a TV screen in it.\n\n138\n00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.360\nI'm telling you now,\nit's got to have one of those.\n\n139\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.740\nAnd I want a camera in every room,\nand I want at least two,\n\n140\n00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.590\nmaybe three routers in there.\n\n141\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.870\nAnd I want everything to be wireless and\nI want everything hidden in the walls,\n\n142\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.500\nI don't wanna see any of this technology.\n\n143\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.645\nI told you I was picky.\n\n144\n00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:30.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n145\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.120\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go to the architect and\n\n146\n00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.790\nI'm gonna tell him all of this.\n\n147\n00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.200\nAnd he is going to produce a blueprint.\n\n148\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.230\nBut here's something special\nabout that blueprint,\n\n149\n00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:46.800\nand that blueprint is not\njust going to be the plans.\n\n150\n00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.400\nThe two dimensional plans for that house.\n\n151\n00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.470\nWhat that architect is going to deliver me\n\n152\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.680\nis a three dimensional mock up of what\nthat house is going to look like.\n\n153\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.180\nHe is going to include all of\nthe plans for all of the plumbing for\n\n154\n00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:08.150\nall of the electrics, for all of the IT\nwiring that I want, he's going to\n\n155\n00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:13.860\ninclude all of the list of contractors\nthat he's going to use, those suppliers.\n\n156\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.970\nHe's going to tell me exactly what tiles\nare going to be used in the bathroom, he's\n\n157\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:24.720\ngoing to tell me exactly where he's going\nto purchase all of the furniture from.\n\n158\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.660\nYeah, I didn't mention furniture, did I?\n\n159\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.170\nHe's gonna tell me where he's\ngonna purchase everything,\n\n160\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.830\neven the bed sheets and everything from.\n\n161\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.780\nHe's going to even tell me what\ncolor the bed sheets are going to be\n\n162\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.240\nThis is not just any blueprint.\n\n163\n00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.100\nThis is what I call and what we call\nin ITIL a service design package.\n\n164\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.121\nAnd that service design\npackage contains absolutely\n\n165\n00:09:50.121 --> 00:09:54.486\neverything that's needed to build and\nto test,\n\n166\n00:09:54.486 --> 00:09:58.330\nand to deploy, and then to run that house.\n\n167\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.490\nSo that service design package even\nincludes all of the instruction manuals\n\n168\n00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.870\nfor all of the appliances and everything\nelse that I've got in that house.\n\n169\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.460\nThat's what's in that\nservice design package.\n\n170\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.440\nSo we think of it as\nan architect's blueprint,\n\n171\n00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.980\nbut here in we think of it\nas a service design package.\n\n172\n00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.030\nThis is why we've got all of those\nprocesses in service design.\n\n173\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.510\nAnd then what happens\nis we hand that over.\n\n174\n00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:27.440\nTo service transmission, we had it over to\nthe builder, okay, to the contractors and\n\n175\n00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.980\nwe let them come and do their work, and\nthey do the bills and the tests and\n\n176\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.340\ntake a look at all of\nthe processes in there.\n\n177\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.260\nThey understand where that\nservice configuration management\n\n178\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.710\nexactly what the wirings going to look\nlike and how it's going together.\n\n179\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:40.430\nBecause you know,\n\n180\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.830\nthe last thing you need is me trying\nto put a TV up on that wall over there.\n\n181\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.880\nOr me asking for a TV on that wall up\nthere, and you can't, because it's a solid\n\n182\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.090\nbrick wall, because I wanted it in brick,\nright, all the external walls.\n\n183\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.170\nAnd so the TV can't go on there,\nit's got to go on that wall.\n\n184\n00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.540\nSo asset configuration management tells me\nhow everything's going to hang together.\n\n185\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.260\nSo, here in service transition,\nwe do all the build.\n\n186\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.760\nAnd at the end of service transition,\nwhat happens is I'm a customer and\n\n187\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.150\nsomebody hands the keys to me and\nI walk in the house and\n\n188\n00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:21.180\nI open the refrigerator, the one\nthat was designed in service design.\n\n189\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.506\nI get out that bottle of wine that\nwas designed in service design, but\n\n190\n00:11:25.506 --> 00:11:27.902\nit's been nicely chilled right now.\n\n191\n00:11:27.902 --> 00:11:31.781\nAnd I go to the cupboard in the kitchen\nwhere I said I wanted my glasses to be\n\n192\n00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:35.344\nkept, and they've got the right\nglasses in the right cupboard and\n\n193\n00:11:35.344 --> 00:11:37.270\nI take out a glass and I pour my wine.\n\n194\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:42.490\nAnd I walk over to the couch that I\ntold service design that I wanted and\n\n195\n00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:47.350\nsit in front of the TV with my glass\nof wine I pick up the controls,\n\n196\n00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:52.300\nbecause the remote control are next\nto the instruction manual and\n\n197\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.650\nI just sit back and I watch TV,\nbecause all of my services are in place.\n\n198\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.910\nI've got my contracts in place with the TV\ncompany and with the internet, etc.\n\n199\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:09.270\nAnd so now I'm in to what we call Service\nOperation which is just business as usual.\n\n200\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.630\nAnd business as usual is where well\nI just carry on living in my house\n\n201\n00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.580\nwithout any problems.\n\n202\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.450\nOkay, that's not going to happen,\nall right?\n\n203\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.130\nWe know that there were\ngoing to be problems.\n\n204\n00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.770\nAnd so during service operation.\n\n205\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.630\nThen I'm going to have systems that\nare going to monitor Internet usage and\n\n206\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.450\nsystems that are going to monitor.\n\n207\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:34.120\nWhat TV that I watch and\nYou know, asset DVRs, etc..\n\n208\n00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.330\nAnd if anything does go wrong,\nI've got contractors, etc.,\n\n209\n00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.220\nthat I can call if anything\ngoes wrong in the house.\n\n210\n00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.480\nThat's incident and problem management.\n\n211\n00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.940\nI know who to call if I want something\nnew, if I want an upgrade, for instance.\n\n212\n00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.670\nBut then,\nin continual service improvement,\n\n213\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.790\nwe're continually assessing that, you\nknow what, The showers remain watertight,\n\n214\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.940\nthat the refrigerator is at\nthe right level of technology.\n\n215\n00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.000\nBecause I do like my toys.\n\n216\n00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.800\nAnd so\nwe're continually improving that house.\n\n217\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.880\nBecause let's face it, you don't live with\nthe same decor for ten years, do you?\n\n218\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.950\nAnd this is what happens.\n\n219\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.970\nSo from an IT perspective service strategy\nis where we come up with the idea.\n\n220\n00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.720\nAnd where we go to the bank for money, and\n\n221\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.080\nservice design is where\nwe design everything.\n\n222\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.500\nIncluding our testing, our training,\nand design how we're going to operate.\n\n223\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.550\nIn service transition we build it,\nwe test it, we deploy it.\n\n224\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.530\nAnd then in operation, we manage\nthose services on an ongoing basis.\n\n225\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.380\nAnd in continual service improvement,\nwe continue.\n\n226\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.200\nTo ensure that our services are aligned\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n227\n00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:49.020\nIn other words that they're\nexactly what we want to see for\n\n228\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.140\nthe organization at that point in time.\n\n229\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.880\nAnd because things change, needs change.\n\n230\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.470\nThere's quite a lot there just to take in,\njust on one slide.\n\n231\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.170\nSo now we're gonna look\na little bit more in depth.\n\n232\n00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.050\nAnd this is where I'll say,\nsometimes everybody does need\n\n233\n00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.690\na refresher from foundation\nbecause we've got a lot to learn.\n\n234\n00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.460\nSo, let's take a look then.\n\n235\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.210\nI talked about services and\nabout the idea of a service.\n\n236\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.310\nSo what is a service?\n\n237\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.570\nWell, the definition of a service\nis up there in blue, okay.\n\n238\n00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.020\nAnd the ITIL definition of\na service from the publications.\n\n239\n00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:30.380\nA service is a means of delivering value\nto customers by facilitating the outcomes\n\n240\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.370\nthat they want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n241\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.670\nSeems like a mouthful doesn't it?\n\n242\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.030\nLet me break it down there.\n\n243\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.760\nA service is a means of delivering value.\n\n244\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.500\nThat's the first challenge\ncuz value is perceived.\n\n245\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.150\nIf I was to go out and buy a car,\nif I were to go out and\n\n246\n00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.470\nbuy a car, well Ronnie,\nlet me ask you a question.\n\n247\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you were to go out and\n\n248\n00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.160\nbuy a car right now,\n\n249\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.620\nbearing in mind that I'm looking\nat this definition of a service.\n\n250\n00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:09.940\nAnd the service is a means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating outcomes.\n\n251\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.870\nSo the outcome of a car that we wanna\nfacilitate is to get from a to b,\n\n252\n00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.820\nright, that's the outcome.\n\n253\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.300\nSo if you were to go and buy a car,\nwhat would you look for in a car?\n\n254\n00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.520\n&gt;&gt; If it's just to facilitate a to b?\n\n255\n00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n256\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:30.590\n&gt;&gt; It would probably be a very small and\neconomical car that's a manual-driven car.\n\n257\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n258\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.560\nYou see, whereas me, I come from Europe,\n\n259\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.240\nyou know we have roads\nwith speed limit on them.\n\n260\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.060\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n261\n00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so I want something quick.\n\n262\n00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.770\nI want some thing that's going to handle.\n\n263\n00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.206\nI want something that's gonna\nlose me my license probably.\n\n264\n00:15:48.206 --> 00:15:48.823\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS].\n\n265\n00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:52.683\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] But you know,\nI want something that's yeah,\n\n266\n00:15:52.683 --> 00:15:57.196\nI'm with you on the manual, yeah,\nso I can handle around corners.\n\n267\n00:15:57.196 --> 00:15:59.556\nYeah, I'm gonna get myself into trouble.\n\n268\n00:15:59.556 --> 00:16:04.544\n[LAUGH] But ultimately, what I value is\ncompletely different to what you value,\n\n269\n00:16:04.544 --> 00:16:05.070\nright?\n\n270\n00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.350\n&gt;&gt; And given the limitation to what\nyou said just to get from A to B, yes.\n\n271\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.860\nBut if I wanted to take that car and\ndo other things with it,\n\n272\n00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.202\nI might have chosen the same thing.\n\n273\n00:16:13.202 --> 00:16:15.397\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n274\n00:16:15.397 --> 00:16:18.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'd still like.\n\n275\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.787\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n[LAUGH]\n\n276\n00:16:18.787 --> 00:16:19.830\n&gt;&gt; I'd still like to get for\n\n277\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.038\nme to be fast.\n\n278\n00:16:21.038 --> 00:16:23.261\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n\n279\n00:16:23.261 --> 00:16:26.460\n&gt;&gt; You see the thing is, that we know\nthe outcome that we want to facilitate.\n\n280\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.640\nBut we all have a different\nperception of value.\n\n281\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n282\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.650\n&gt;&gt; That's our first challenge,\nstraight away.\n\n283\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.740\nIt is a means of delivering value,\nand you could say, okay then,\n\n284\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.950\nwe'll put this in\nthe business perspective.\n\n285\n00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.830\nThen actually, that's not too bad,\n\n286\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.910\ncuz everybody values\nthe same thing in business.\n\n287\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.889\nThat's not true at all.\n\n288\n00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.090\nWhat desktop picture do you\nhave on your laptop there?\n\n289\n00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.010\nIs it the one that you were given when\nyou were first given that laptop?\n\n290\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.836\n&gt;&gt; Probably, yes.\n\n291\n00:16:54.836 --> 00:16:57.205\n&gt;&gt; It is, right, okay.\n\n292\n00:16:57.205 --> 00:16:58.855\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can tell you that this one isn't.\n\n293\n00:16:58.855 --> 00:17:03.560\n[LAUGH] Because we all change it,\nwe all customize our desktop.\n\n294\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.848\nAnd to say well, that's okay in business,\nwe will value the same thing,\n\n295\n00:17:07.848 --> 00:17:09.242\nwe don't, we don't.\n\n296\n00:17:09.242 --> 00:17:13.201\nI take a look at my keyboard right now,\nand my keyboard even though we\n\n297\n00:17:13.201 --> 00:17:18.160\nhave exactly the same laptop my keyboard\nlooks completely different to yours.\n\n298\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.060\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n299\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Because we both value\nthe different things, okay.\n\n300\n00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.810\nYou like yours exactly how\nit came out of the box.\n\n301\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.280\nWhereas, I like mine completely different.\n\n302\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.640\n[LAUGH] Completely different,\nwe gotta be a little bit colorful here.\n\n303\n00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.520\nSo even in a business perspective,\nwe don't have the same concept of value.\n\n304\n00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.599\nWhat we can do though,\nwe can understand that,\n\n305\n00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:44.938\nwe're delivering value to customers and\n\n306\n00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:49.632\nthat in itself can be a challenge because\na customer is somebody who buys a service.\n\n307\n00:17:51.207 --> 00:17:55.330\nNot a user,\na user is somebody who uses a service.\n\n308\n00:17:56.728 --> 00:18:00.120\nSo, let me ask you a question.\n\n309\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.469\nI'm gonna ask you a lot of questions.\n\n310\n00:18:01.469 --> 00:18:02.110\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n311\n00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:05.290\n&gt;&gt; When was the last time you\nwent into a coffee shop and\n\n312\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.350\nbought a drink for someone?\n\n313\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.250\n&gt;&gt; The last time,\nprobably close to two years ago.\n\n314\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.395\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n315\n00:18:13.395 --> 00:18:13.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n316\n00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.930\nwhen you're going to that coffee shop and\nyou buy somebody a drink,\n\n317\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.660\nthe person behind the counter,\nare they interested in\n\n318\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.410\nwhat you value or are they interested in\nthat person that you bought the drink for?\n\n319\n00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.670\nDo they care whether they\nlike the drink or not?\n\n320\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.520\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that they would care,\n\n321\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.230\nbut maybe they don't,\nmaybe they just wanna sell it.\n\n322\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.363\n&gt;&gt; Right, see there's an assumption.\n\n323\n00:18:38.363 --> 00:18:43.597\nBecause you see, if you think about it\nfrom a user and customer perspective,\n\n324\n00:18:43.597 --> 00:18:48.908\nif I take somebody into a coffee shop, and\nI buy them a drink, I expect that that\n\n325\n00:18:48.908 --> 00:18:54.062\ncoffee shop is probably only gonna care\nabout getting that money out of me and\n\n326\n00:18:54.062 --> 00:18:59.412\nnot care about whether the person I bought\na drink for is going to like it or not.\n\n327\n00:18:59.412 --> 00:19:03.828\nBut the simple fact is, that if the person\nthat I bought the drink for doesn't like\n\n328\n00:19:03.828 --> 00:19:08.380\nit, then they're gonna turn to me and say,\nwell we're not going back there again.\n\n329\n00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.390\nI don't like that place.\n\n330\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:15.582\nSo, users influence customers decisions.\n\n331\n00:19:15.582 --> 00:19:18.599\nSo even though we want to\ndeliver value to customers,\n\n332\n00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:22.970\nthey're actually really concerned with\nthe value perception of users too.\n\n333\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.567\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n334\n00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:29.416\n&gt;&gt; Because, if that person that I\nbought a drink for didn't like it,\n\n335\n00:19:29.416 --> 00:19:33.569\nthen we're not going back there,\nbecause I don't wanna listen to it.\n\n336\n00:19:33.569 --> 00:19:36.600\n[LAUGH] So, yeah,\nwe're not going back there.\n\n337\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.440\nSo we talked then about delivering value\nto customers, not forgetting owners by\n\n338\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.870\nfacilitating the outcomes that they want\nto achieve, facilitating the outcomes.\n\n339\n00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.090\nWe cannot achieve their outcomes for them.\n\n340\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.390\nThey have got to put some input into this.\n\n341\n00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.400\nSo we want to facilitate outcomes.\n\n342\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.250\nSo we're not going to type your emails for\nyou.\n\n343\n00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.670\nWe can't do that.\n\n344\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.450\nOkay, what we can do is, we can give you\nthe ability to send and receiving email,\n\n345\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.050\nbut you've got to type that out yourself\nand you've got to send that email.\n\n346\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.100\nAnd you've got to read\nthe emails that come in.\n\n347\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.170\nSo we're gonna do a lot for you.\n\n348\n00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:18.239\nBut then, we want to facilitate\nthat outcome for you, but\n\n349\n00:20:18.239 --> 00:20:23.107\nwithout transferring to you\nspecific costs and risks.\n\n350\n00:20:23.107 --> 00:20:25.180\nSo this is made up of components.\n\n351\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.674\nAnd out of those components, we consider\nthings like software and hardware and\n\n352\n00:20:30.674 --> 00:20:32.075\nenvironmental aspect.\n\n353\n00:20:32.075 --> 00:20:36.140\nAnd the people that support the service\nand the people that implement the service\n\n354\n00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.290\nand the infrastructure, and\nthe documentation as well.\n\n355\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.059\nThese are all components of a service.\n\n356\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.490\nNow without any single one of those\ncomponents that service would not exist.\n\n357\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:52.060\nBut if you consider that we\nwould have to actually work out\n\n358\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.835\nthe specific cost of each one of those\ncomponents, to each individual customer,\n\n359\n00:20:56.835 --> 00:21:00.235\nfor each individual service,\nthat's a lot of effort.\n\n360\n00:21:00.235 --> 00:21:00.855\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n361\n00:21:00.855 --> 00:21:02.995\nwe're not gonna transfer\nthose specific costs to you.\n\n362\n00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:04.825\nWe might charge you a nominal fee, but\n\n363\n00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:07.457\nwe're not gonna transfer\nthe specific cost to you.\n\n364\n00:21:07.457 --> 00:21:12.197\nAnd so the same reason, we're not\ngonna transfer specific risks to you.\n\n365\n00:21:12.197 --> 00:21:14.085\nIdeally what we want to do is,\n\n366\n00:21:14.085 --> 00:21:18.841\ndeliver our service as going to allow\nyou to improve your performance, and\n\n367\n00:21:18.841 --> 00:21:24.141\nreduce any constraints that you might\nfeel whilst achieving that outcome, okay.\n\n368\n00:21:24.141 --> 00:21:27.323\nAnd that outcome being as it\nsays there the intended or\n\n369\n00:21:27.323 --> 00:21:33.180\nactual result of carrying out an activity,\nover on the right hand side of that slide.\n\n370\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.390\nSo what about service management then?\n\n371\n00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:40.125\nWell, service management, which is ideal\nas a framework for service management.\n\n372\n00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:44.855\nService management is a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities for providing\n\n373\n00:21:44.855 --> 00:21:49.465\nvalue to customers in the form of goods or\nservices, as it says in the ideal books.\n\n374\n00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:55.682\nIt's a couple of words I\nwanna bring out there, and\n\n375\n00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:59.810\nthat is,\nspecialized organizational capability.\n\n376\n00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.270\nAll right, three words, not a couple.\n\n377\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.100\nSo we've gotta have the specialism.\n\n378\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.541\nIn other words, we don't just need broad\nexperience, we need specialist experience.\n\n379\n00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:12.210\nWe also need to be organized.\n\n380\n00:22:13.697 --> 00:22:18.088\nIf we disorganize, if there's absolute\nchaos going on in our IT organization,\n\n381\n00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:20.993\nthen unfortunately,\nit's not an IT organization,\n\n382\n00:22:20.993 --> 00:22:25.590\nit's an IT disorganization and\nwe're never gonna deliver value.\n\n383\n00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.790\nBut we've got to be capable too.\n\n384\n00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.388\nYeah, we've got to have the right\ncapabilities to be able\n\n385\n00:22:31.388 --> 00:22:32.990\nto deliver those services, okay.\n\n386\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.690\nSo we got to take what we consider\nto be our asset, our resources and\n\n387\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.970\nour capabilities and\n\n388\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:47.570\ntransform them into something that\nwill deliver valuable services.\n\n389\n00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:51.971\nOur tangible capabilities, our resources,\nare things that we can touch and feel.\n\n390\n00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:56.561\nSo things like money, something tangible,\na hardware is something is\n\n391\n00:22:56.561 --> 00:23:00.700\nsomething tangible,\na software is something tangible.\n\n392\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.307\nAnd people, in terms of bums on seats,\ntangible as well.\n\n393\n00:23:05.307 --> 00:23:07.770\nThese are things that we can touch and\nfeel.\n\n394\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.658\nDon't go touching and feeling people\ntoo much though, we end up in court,\n\n395\n00:23:11.658 --> 00:23:12.285\nall right?\n\n396\n00:23:12.285 --> 00:23:13.565\nJust warning on that one.\n\n397\n00:23:13.565 --> 00:23:16.320\n[LAUGH] And\nthen we've got out capabilities too,\n\n398\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.110\nbecause we can't just have bums\non seats as we would call it.\n\n399\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.030\nThey gotta have the right skills.\n\n400\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.170\nAnd so our capabilities encompasses\nthings like intangible assets,\n\n401\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.420\nthings that we have to had,\n\n402\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.740\nthat the assets to an organization that\nare very, very difficult to quantify.\n\n403\n00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.544\nSuch as experience,\nsuch as the way that we're organized,\n\n404\n00:23:36.544 --> 00:23:38.416\neven who our management are.\n\n405\n00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:44.331\nIf our management are, how should I say,\nif they're disorganized themselves,\n\n406\n00:23:44.331 --> 00:23:49.475\nor perhaps we're got interpersonal\nconflict in some of our teams, and\n\n407\n00:23:49.475 --> 00:23:54.727\nwe're not going to be able to deliver\nefficient and effective service.\n\n408\n00:23:54.727 --> 00:23:58.186\nSo service management is\nall about implementing and\n\n409\n00:23:58.186 --> 00:24:00.575\nmanaging those quality services.\n\n410\n00:24:00.575 --> 00:24:06.534\nAnd we have to ensure that the customer\nreceives a service that they value.\n\n411\n00:24:06.534 --> 00:24:12.630\nAnd that it performs at a level that they\nexpect and to a cost that they expect too.\n\n412\n00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:21.240\nHere we are then in IT, and we are what\nis considered to be a service provider.\n\n413\n00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.300\nAnd we have three different\ntypes of service provider.\n\n414\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.390\nWe have a service provider that\nis internal to the business unit.\n\n415\n00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.000\nWe have a service provider that\noperates in a shared services unit, so\n\n416\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.990\ninternal to the organization but\nserves many business units.\n\n417\n00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:42.879\nAnd then we have a type III,\nas we call it, which is external provider.\n\n418\n00:24:42.879 --> 00:24:46.739\nAnd that is some body who is\ncompletely external, outsourced,\n\n419\n00:24:46.739 --> 00:24:50.530\nwe'd like to say,\ncompletely external to the organization.\n\n420\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.610\nSo within our service provider\norganization and within our business,\n\n421\n00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.400\nwe have what we call stakeholders.\n\n422\n00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:06.176\nStakeholder is defined\nas any interested party.\n\n423\n00:25:06.176 --> 00:25:11.620\nNot just financial interest, biggest\nmistake that I think that we make here.\n\n424\n00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.371\nAlthough, I have to say that we\nhave had discussions in other\n\n425\n00:25:16.371 --> 00:25:20.106\nsessions about the nuances\nbetween langages.\n\n426\n00:25:20.106 --> 00:25:23.967\nAnd there is an inference that\nstakeholder, in certain cultures,\n\n427\n00:25:23.967 --> 00:25:28.386\nmeans that somebody who has a financial\ninterest, but that's not the case.\n\n428\n00:25:28.386 --> 00:25:33.293\nWe're talking about anybody\nthat's had an interest.\n\n429\n00:25:33.293 --> 00:25:37.678\nI hate to say this, but even my nosy\nneighbor is considered to be a stakeholder\n\n430\n00:25:37.678 --> 00:25:41.799\nin my life, cuz she definitely has\nan interest in everything that we do.\n\n431\n00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.539\nSo we've got stakeholders within\nour internal service provider,\n\n432\n00:25:46.539 --> 00:25:49.019\nsuch as functions,\nthese groups of people, and\n\n433\n00:25:49.019 --> 00:25:52.360\nwe'll talk a little bit more about\nthem and the groups and teams.\n\n434\n00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.997\nAnd we've got people outside of\nservice provider organization,\n\n435\n00:25:56.997 --> 00:26:00.319\nsuch as customers and\nusers and our suppliers.\n\n436\n00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:03.538\nAnd they're all stakeholders too, okay?\n\n437\n00:26:03.538 --> 00:26:06.220\nSo stakeholder is any interested party.\n\n438\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.866\nYou'll notice that what we're doing is\nwe're just going over a lot at the moment.\n\n439\n00:26:10.866 --> 00:26:14.175\nWe're going over a lot of the terms and\n\n440\n00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:18.995\nthe definitions that we\nlearned in foundation class.\n\n441\n00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:23.229\nHere's another term and definition\nthat we learned in foundation class,\n\n442\n00:26:23.229 --> 00:26:26.397\nis the concept of both internal and\nexternal services.\n\n443\n00:26:26.397 --> 00:26:33.982\nAnd an internal service is a service that\nwe provide Internally to our organization.\n\n444\n00:26:33.982 --> 00:26:37.650\nAnd an external service is a service\nthat we provide externally\n\n445\n00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.520\nto external customers.\n\n446\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.146\nSo, an internal service would be\nsomething, and I used examples like SAP or\n\n447\n00:26:44.146 --> 00:26:49.000\nlike our email service,\nis something internal to our organization.\n\n448\n00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.430\nBut then an external service is\nsomething that our customers use,\n\n449\n00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:57.050\nsuch as a website for instance or\nexternal service catalogs\n\n450\n00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:02.280\nif we're in an industry where we are\nselling goods externally to our customers.\n\n451\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.573\nSo you will see here,\nfrom this particular slide,\n\n452\n00:27:05.573 --> 00:27:11.103\nthat over on the left-hand side internal\nservices are delivered to business units.\n\n453\n00:27:11.103 --> 00:27:17.140\nAnd they in turn use those to deliver\na service to external customers.\n\n454\n00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:23.069\nAnd then we have, on the right-hand side,\nwe have services, like our Internet,\n\n455\n00:27:23.069 --> 00:27:28.085\nthat are delivered direct through\nto our external customers, okay?\n\n456\n00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:34.224\nOn the next slide, there's just really a\nlittle bit of an example of core services,\n\n457\n00:27:34.224 --> 00:27:38.203\nenabling services, and\nenhancing services, okay,\n\n458\n00:27:38.203 --> 00:27:43.320\nwhich is just further classification\nof our services, to be honest.\n\n459\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.537\nWe split our services down, believe it or\nnot, into those that are core,\n\n460\n00:27:47.537 --> 00:27:51.905\nthose that are enabling services, and\nthose that are enhancing services.\n\n461\n00:27:51.905 --> 00:27:56.362\nNow we've got pizza delivery example\nup there on the screen in front of you.\n\n462\n00:27:56.362 --> 00:27:59.520\nI wanna give you an IT example,\nfor instance.\n\n463\n00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.780\nSo let's think about our email service.\n\n464\n00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:10.045\nSo the core service in an email service is\nthat ability to send and receive email.\n\n465\n00:28:10.045 --> 00:28:12.708\nThat's our core service.\n\n466\n00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:17.665\nNow the enabling service is a service\nthat's a service in it's own right, but\n\n467\n00:28:17.665 --> 00:28:19.855\nthat underpins the core service.\n\n468\n00:28:19.855 --> 00:28:23.974\nAnd that would be our infrastructure,\nit's a service in its own right,\n\n469\n00:28:23.974 --> 00:28:28.580\nbut without it email's not going\nto be able to be sent or received.\n\n470\n00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.960\nAnd then an enhancing\nservice is an optional extra.\n\n471\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.355\nSomething that we can do that maybe\nsets us apart from our competitors or\n\n472\n00:28:37.355 --> 00:28:41.764\nsomething that we just choose to do,\nit's optional for our business.\n\n473\n00:28:41.764 --> 00:28:45.580\nAnd that would be something like\na shared calendar, for instance, okay?\n\n474\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:50.921\nSo something that is an optional extra\nthat's our email, that's our shared,\n\n475\n00:28:50.921 --> 00:28:55.600\ndirectory, shared calendar is\nthe word I'm looking for, okay?\n\n476\n00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:00.934\nSo these are our core and\nour enabling and our enhancing services.\n\n477\n00:29:00.934 --> 00:29:06.053\nNow, I asked you about\nvalue a little earlier on.\n\n478\n00:29:06.053 --> 00:29:09.460\nAnd about what we perceive as value.\n\n479\n00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:14.088\nSo I'm just gonna wrap up this\nsection by going over a couple of\n\n480\n00:29:14.088 --> 00:29:17.658\nslides that look over\nthe definition of value.\n\n481\n00:29:17.658 --> 00:29:22.381\nNow, you will see that in\nthe bottom of this particular slide\n\n482\n00:29:22.381 --> 00:29:24.418\nright in front of you now,\n\n483\n00:29:24.418 --> 00:29:30.084\nyou will see that the diagram that you\nsaw in your ITIL foundation class.\n\n484\n00:29:30.084 --> 00:29:33.683\nAnd that is that diagram that always\nlooks very, very complicated and\n\n485\n00:29:33.683 --> 00:29:37.045\neverybody always says to me,\nhow am I supposed to remember this?\n\n486\n00:29:37.045 --> 00:29:40.087\nWell, it's really easy\nbecause you just need\n\n487\n00:29:40.087 --> 00:29:43.450\nto remember the concepts of utility and\nwarranty.\n\n488\n00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.899\nSo the concept of utility is very,\nvery simply,\n\n489\n00:29:47.899 --> 00:29:50.457\ndoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n490\n00:29:50.457 --> 00:29:52.580\nAnd that's its fitness for purpose.\n\n491\n00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.360\nDoes that service send and receive email?\n\n492\n00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.110\nYes, it does.\n\n493\n00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.980\nOkay then, it has utility.\n\n494\n00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.170\nAnd you can have a web-based email service\nthat will do exactly that for you.\n\n495\n00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.580\nIt will deliver that email.\n\n496\n00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.864\nBut can I ask you,\nin a business perspective then, Ronnie,\n\n497\n00:30:08.864 --> 00:30:13.263\nwould a web-based email deliver\nyou levels of security that you\n\n498\n00:30:13.263 --> 00:30:16.377\nwould feel comfortable with, do you think?\n\n499\n00:30:16.377 --> 00:30:22.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not necessarily, especially if\nI'm actually using a public provider and\n\n500\n00:30:22.224 --> 00:30:28.360\nnot my own, as far as a portal that allows\nme access just inside of my own network.\n\n501\n00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, so\nwhat you're saying is then,\n\n502\n00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.630\nin effect, is that that service\nprovides utility, which it does.\n\n503\n00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.860\nBut it doesn't provide warranty aspect.\n\n504\n00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.475\nAnd if we look at the warranty aspect,\n\n505\n00:30:42.475 --> 00:30:47.465\nyou will see that those warranty\naspects are availability, capacity,\n\n506\n00:30:47.465 --> 00:30:51.660\nsecurity, which is one that I mentioned,\nand continuity.\n\n507\n00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:57.070\nAnd so both utility and warranty have to\nexist in order for us to perceive value.\n\n508\n00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.530\nSo let's go through\nthose warranty aspects.\n\n509\n00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.945\nIs that service available enough?\n\n510\n00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:08.930\nWell, okay, an Internet, so\nan Internet based web mail service might\n\n511\n00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.932\nbe available enough, but\ndoes it have enough capacity?\n\n512\n00:31:12.932 --> 00:31:15.434\nMm, guarantee when you try and\nsend some files,\n\n513\n00:31:15.434 --> 00:31:18.260\nit'll tell you that they're too big.\n\n514\n00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.587\nDoes it have continuity?\n\n515\n00:31:19.587 --> 00:31:23.410\nWell it might do, but\nwe don't have any assurance of that.\n\n516\n00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:27.490\nAnd that's the key thing about\nwarranty is that we have assurance.\n\n517\n00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.350\nAnd we certainly don't have\nany assurance for security.\n\n518\n00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:36.430\nSo you see, both utility and warranty\nneed to exist for us to perceive value.\n\n519\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:41.412\nIt's not just good enough for us to have a\nservice that does what it says on the can.\n\n520\n00:31:41.412 --> 00:31:43.760\nWe've gotta be able to use it as well.\n\n521\n00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.450\nAnd this next slide,\n\n522\n00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:51.090\nwhich is something that I'm going\nto use to wrap up this session.\n\n523\n00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:56.230\nIf you look, the utility effect\nin that bottom left-hand corner\n\n524\n00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:01.030\nis all about increasing\nthe probability and\n\n525\n00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:05.440\nmaintaining that probability\nof that service working.\n\n526\n00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.530\nIn other words, that service\nwill do what it says on the can,\n\n527\n00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:11.560\nwithout a shadow of a doubt.\n\n528\n00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:19.059\nBut the warranty effect has to actually\ndecrease variances in availability,\n\n529\n00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:24.030\nand in capacity, and\nin continuity, and in security.\n\n530\n00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:29.620\nBecause what we actually want to do is we\nwant to ensure that we have all of those.\n\n531\n00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.680\nSo we want to decrease, and\n\n532\n00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.980\nwe want to decrease the uncertainty\nof providing those aspects.\n\n533\n00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.774\nAs we've said,\nwe have got to have both utility and\n\n534\n00:32:41.774 --> 00:32:45.401\nwarranty in order for\nanyone to perceive value.\n\n535\n00:32:45.401 --> 00:32:49.876\nSo for now, we're going to wrap\nup this particular session,\n\n536\n00:32:49.876 --> 00:32:54.140\nwhich is part one of our\nrecap of our ITIL foundation.\n\n537\n00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.670\nAnd in our next section, we're going\nto look further into our assets and\n\n538\n00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.730\ninto our resources and capabilities, etc.\n\n539\n00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:06.634\nAnd we're also going to look at processes,\nand we're going to look at roles,\n\n540\n00:33:06.634 --> 00:33:11.653\nand we're going to look at all of\nour responsibilities, etc too.\n\n541\n00:33:11.653 --> 00:33:13.636\n&gt;&gt; All right Jill,\nwell thank you again for\n\n542\n00:33:13.636 --> 00:33:15.975\nhelping us out with this\npart of the refresher.\n\n543\n00:33:15.975 --> 00:33:19.908\nThere's a lot more for us to cover, but\nthat means we're gonna go ahead and\n\n544\n00:33:19.908 --> 00:33:21.670\nend this episode then.\n\n545\n00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.715\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n546\n00:33:25.715 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.205\nWelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:03.205 --> 00:00:07.369\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:08.518\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:12.373\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.373 --> 00:00:15.070\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.520\nYou're watching the ITIL Foundation\nRefresher for your intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.560\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\nwe're taking a look at another foundation\n\n8\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.320\nrefresher, a part two to help us to\nround out those skills that we need.\n\n9\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.640\nAnd here to help us of course is going\nto be our ITIL virtuoso, Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.230\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.790\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.890\nHow are you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.659\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, taking look and\n\n14\n00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.191\nremembering all those different terms\nthat I've seen in the foundation and\n\n15\n00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:49.812\nnow getting those things kind of brought\nback up has really starting to help.\n\n16\n00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:52.470\nSo what do we actually have left to do,\nwhere are we gonna begin?\n\n17\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's, this foundation\nmaterial that we're recapping over,\n\n18\n00:00:56.865 --> 00:00:58.610\nthere's so much information-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n19\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.170\n&gt;&gt; To absorb, so much information.\n\n20\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.265\nAnd trust me, you're not the only one.\n\n21\n00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:07.463\nBecause we have delegates that\nleave foundation class and\n\n22\n00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:11.834\nthe feedback that they'll give\nyou sometimes is that whoa,\n\n23\n00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:14.928\nit's just so much information to absorb.\n\n24\n00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:18.877\nAnd it really is, and the unfortunate\nthing is that we have to get through\n\n25\n00:01:18.877 --> 00:01:23.346\nthe foundation, you have to understand all\nof the concepts in the foundation to be\n\n26\n00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:25.910\nable to then delve deeper\ninto the processes.\n\n27\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.640\nAnd until we can understand really what\na process is, or really what a functional\n\n28\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.060\narea is and what a role should do,\nthen it's difficult to apply that concept.\n\n29\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.660\nAnd so\nwhat we're learning here is concepts.\n\n30\n00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.935\nAnd I will admit that\nthere is a lot to learn.\n\n31\n00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, so\n\n32\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.030\njust take us a little bit through\nwhat we reviewed last time and\n\n33\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.750\nthen where we're going to\nbe heading from there.\n\n34\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo in part one,\n\n35\n00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.510\nwe actually looked at\nthe concept of a service.\n\n36\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.220\nAnd the concept of a service is,\n\n37\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.080\na service is a means of delivering value\nby facilitating the outcomes that our\n\n38\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.730\ncustomers want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n39\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.440\nNow, you know value is perceived.\n\n40\n00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.880\nAs I mentioned, we all have\na different perception of value and\n\n41\n00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.460\neven in a business environment our\nperception of value is still different.\n\n42\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.590\nNo matter how much we\nwould like to try and\n\n43\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.250\ndeliver a one size fits all\napproach to our services,\n\n44\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.590\nto our businesses, we can't do\nthat because value is perceived.\n\n45\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.410\nSo we looked at that and we looked\nat the fact that service management,\n\n46\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.890\nwhich ITIL is a framework is a set of\nspecialized organizational capabilities\n\n47\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.410\nfor delivering value to customers\nin the form of goods or services.\n\n48\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.040\nNow I know that I just rattled off two\ndescriptions, two definitions to you.\n\n49\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.440\nAnd now that's made me\nlook like a bit of a nerd.\n\n50\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.270\n[LAUGH] I'm fully aware of that, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.160\nAnd we also looked at the concept of\nvalue being broken down into utility and\n\n52\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.290\nwarranty and\n\n53\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.570\nthe fact that it's not just about us\nbeing able to do what it says on the can.\n\n54\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.970\nWe've gotta be able to send and receive\nemail but we've gotta do it in a way that\n\n55\n00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.610\nwe can assure our customers of\nlevels of utility and warranty and\n\n56\n00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.620\navailability and capacity and\nservice continuity and security.\n\n57\n00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.550\nSo we're gonna need both that utility and\n\n58\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.320\nwarranty to be present in order for\nthem to perceive value.\n\n59\n00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.010\nAnd so in this particular section we're\ngonna start off just by going over\n\n60\n00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.860\nwhat our service assets were.\n\n61\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.820\nI mentioned them very,\nvery briefly in the last section about\n\n62\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.390\ntangible and our intangible assets and\nhow we use those to deliver our services.\n\n63\n00:03:45.572 --> 00:03:48.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go ahead and begin, then.\n\n64\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.440\nSo where are we picking up from there?\n\n65\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.230\n&gt;&gt; So as I said,\nwe begin with our service assets and\n\n66\n00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.680\nour assets are what we use\nwithin our organization to\n\n67\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.098\ndeliver value by way of goods or\nservices, as we say.\n\n68\n00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:07.135\nAnd an asset is described there,\nyou've got some definitions there.\n\n69\n00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:10.540\nAn asset is defined as a resource or\na capability.\n\n70\n00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.540\nAnd a resource is what we\nconsider to be a tangible asset,\n\n71\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.250\nsomething that you touch and feel.\n\n72\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.780\nSuch as, as mentioned there,\nmoney, our infrastructure itself,\n\n73\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.960\nthe software that we have, the actual\ndata that we have, our hardware.\n\n74\n00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.650\nThese are tangible assets.\n\n75\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.750\nYou'll notice that people span\nboth capabilities and resources.\n\n76\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.030\nSo then our tangible assets,\nsomething that you can touch and feel.\n\n77\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.620\nBut I gave you that warning\nin that first section.\n\n78\n00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.310\nDon't you do that too much.\n\n79\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.000\nAnd then [LAUGH] and\npeople are also intangible assets.\n\n80\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.150\nAnd you know what,\nunder the intangible assets,\n\n81\n00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.450\nsoft assets as they mention\nthere our capabilities.\n\n82\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.240\nWe've got things like how we're managed,\nwho manages us?\n\n83\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.900\nWe've got the organization itself,\nhow well organized we are.\n\n84\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.750\nIf there's complete chaos going on then\nwe're never gonna be able to deliver value\n\n85\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.800\nto our customers, are we?\n\n86\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.820\nOur processes have to be efficient and\neffective.\n\n87\n00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.710\nAnd if our processes don't do\nwhat they're supposed to do and\n\n88\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.450\nthey're not efficient and\nthey're not effective, then you know what?\n\n89\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.260\nThey're not going to deliver value\nto our business, to our users and\n\n90\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.735\nthen our knowledge.\n\n91\n00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:24.160\nAnd, that underneath people,\nwe've got experience and skills, too.\n\n92\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.931\nAnd knowledge can be quantified.\n\n93\n00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:30.175\nWe should document our knowledge.\n\n94\n00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:34.105\nAnd then it becomes information that we\ncan put into our knowledge management\n\n95\n00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:39.085\nsystem, so a knowledge though is\nalso our experience and our skills.\n\n96\n00:05:39.085 --> 00:05:41.325\nAnd believe it or not, our attitude and\n\n97\n00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:45.027\nattitude fall under these soft assets,\nthe capabilities.\n\n98\n00:05:45.027 --> 00:05:48.855\nLike morale,\nI expect to see morale in there as well,\n\n99\n00:05:48.855 --> 00:05:53.619\nwhich is why as we've moved through\nthe service operation class,\n\n100\n00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:59.339\nyou'll see that we put a huge emphasis on\npeople and on morale and on attitudes.\n\n101\n00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.307\nAnd on understanding sort of\norganizational change management and\n\n102\n00:06:03.307 --> 00:06:07.832\nthe people aspect because our people\nare what's going to enable us to deliver\n\n103\n00:06:07.832 --> 00:06:12.740\nvalue, but they're also what's going to\nhinder us from delivering value, too.\n\n104\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.480\nLook at our soft skills,\n\n105\n00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.560\nlook at our capabilities there and\nhow well we are organized.\n\n106\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.190\nWell, that is, worst it might be,\nyou might consider it to be\n\n107\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.570\ndriven by management cuz management\nset our organizational structures.\n\n108\n00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.538\nBut it's also driven by people,\n\n109\n00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:33.950\ntoo as to how collaborative they\nare within that organizational.\n\n110\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.620\nAnd think about management.\n\n111\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.240\nI know I asked you.\n\n112\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.680\nI put you on the spot last time,\ndidn't I, Ronnie?\n\n113\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.820\nI said to you do you get on with\nyour managers all the time?\n\n114\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.080\nAnd the simple fact of the matter\nis there are always going\n\n115\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.482\nto be interpersonal conflicts.\n\n116\n00:06:48.482 --> 00:06:54.250\nThere are always going to be interpersonal\nissues and so we've got to accept that.\n\n117\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.900\nThat even if we've got good management,\n\n118\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.570\nthen there may be\ninterpersonal issues there.\n\n119\n00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.860\nAnd certainly, I know that we've\nall worked in environments where\n\n120\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.280\nthere may be a siloed\nmentality between teams.\n\n121\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.230\nAnd it doesn't matter how\ngood our processes are.\n\n122\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.730\nIf our people do not have\nthe right attitude or\n\n123\n00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.440\ndon't have the right experience to\nbe able to follow those processes,\n\n124\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.570\nthen they're never gonna deliver value.\n\n125\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.020\nIt's really as simple as that,\nso people are very,\n\n126\n00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.630\nvery important to this,\nincredibly important.\n\n127\n00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.870\nSo I mentioned processes.\n\n128\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.240\nWell, let's take a look at a process.\n\n129\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.920\nI have mentioned in other sessions\nthat we look at in service operations,\n\n130\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.520\nthat a process is a set\nof structured activities,\n\n131\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.630\ndesigned to accomplish\na specific objective.\n\n132\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.610\nAnd it takes an input and\nturns it into an output.\n\n133\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.042\nAnd I think I remember I've said that, and\n\n134\n00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:50.891\nwe've had that [LAUGH] discussion before,\nokay?\n\n135\n00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:55.245\nSo we are looking to deliver\nvalue to our organization by\n\n136\n00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:57.753\nfacilitating their outcomes.\n\n137\n00:07:57.753 --> 00:08:02.795\nWe can't achieve their outcomes for\nthem, but we can facilitate So, we\n\n138\n00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:08.440\nwant to facilitate this in this processes\nwhich leads to business outcomes.\n\n139\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.920\nAnd we will use our processes in order\nto support the services that we deliver.\n\n140\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.180\nAnd exactly as it says\non the next slide there.\n\n141\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.620\nSupporting business processes.\n\n142\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.140\nSo, we use your IT processes\nto support business processes.\n\n143\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.120\nNow, processes have four characteristics\nand they're written there.\n\n144\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.859\nA process has to be measurable.\n\n145\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.370\nI know that it's something that\nI've mentioned before, but\n\n146\n00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.520\nbecause I think so,\nis not a good enough measurement, okay.\n\n147\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.180\nWe have to have tangible\nmetrics that tell us\n\n148\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.390\nwhether the process is delivering value or\nnot.\n\n149\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.520\nWhether the process is effective or\ninefficient.\n\n150\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.730\nA process has to deliver\na specific result,\n\n151\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.099\nwe have to know what that process is\ndelivering, it has to be defined.\n\n152\n00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.250\nAnd it has to delay to\nthat result to a customer.\n\n153\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.820\nNow, a customer was stakeholder.\n\n154\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.010\nI like to use that one because sometimes,\nit's not always that customers that\n\n155\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:11.460\nare raising particular processes\nall that triggering processes.\n\n156\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.790\nIf I think of incident management, would\nyou see the ability to restore service\n\n157\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.640\noperation It's not always customers\nthat raise incidence who uses, but\n\n158\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.070\nit could be internal IT people as well.\n\n159\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.450\nSo, I like to use the word\nstakeholder in there,\n\n160\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.580\nas well we deliver the specific\nresult to a customer or stakeholder,\n\n161\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.180\nbut more importantly at the bottom\nthere responding to specific event or\n\n162\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.580\nprocess have to store somewhere,\nSome thing's got to start them off, okay.\n\n163\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.500\nSo, we call that a trigger,\na trigger to a process.\n\n164\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.840\nNow, this next diagram that's coming up,\nwe're gonna spend a little bit of time on\n\n165\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:53.220\nthis because I absolutely love\nthis diagram, I really, really do.\n\n166\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.590\nAnd yet everybody tells me when they\nlook at it, they say, my goodness Joy,\n\n167\n00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:01.340\nthat looks so messy and yet it really,\nreally explains what a process is now I've\n\n168\n00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.590\nmentioned that a process\nwill start off with, well,\n\n169\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.080\ntaking an input and\nturning it into a defined output.\n\n170\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.860\nOkay, so what we're going to do\nis we're gonna start off with\n\n171\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.970\nin the top righthand corner here as you\ncan see my arrow the process objectives.\n\n172\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:25.240\nAnd I am going to use incident management\nas an example here and the objective of\n\n173\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.660\nincident management is to restore normal\nservice operation as quickly as possible.\n\n174\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.400\nSo, that means then that\nthe process output then,\n\n175\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.410\nwhat do you think that is Ronnie?\n\n176\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.650\nIf the objective is to restore\nnormal service operation\n\n177\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.760\nwhat do you think the output\nto the process is?\n\n178\n00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.940\nIs that the process gets restored?\n\n179\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat the service gets restored.\n\n180\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThe service gets restored.\n\n181\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.130\n&gt;&gt; So, the output is a fixed surface.\n\n182\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Right. Okay. Sure\n&gt;&gt; It's been repaired.\n\n183\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:53.750\nOkay.\n\n184\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.920\nSo, if the output here and\nprocess output is something fixed.\n\n185\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.260\nAnd what do you think the input is?\n\n186\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Something that is maybe not fixed.\n\n187\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.880\nSomething broken.\n\n188\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.470\n&gt;&gt; Something broken?\n\n189\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.095\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n190\n00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:07.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what we do then,\n\n191\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.790\nif you notice, okay, we've got the first\nthree steps of defining a process.\n\n192\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just worked out there and then.\n\n193\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.470\nSo we started off in this top right-hand\ncorner with our process objectives, and\n\n194\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.880\nthen, we looked at our process output,\n\n195\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.410\nwhich was something broken, and\nthe inputs, something fixed.\n\n196\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:30.140\nAnd here in this middle box we've got\nall of the actual process itself.\n\n197\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.240\nWe've got the activities and\nthe procedures and\n\n198\n00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.230\nthe work instructions that will\nget us from broken to fixed.\n\n199\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.570\nNow, it will get us from here to here.\n\n200\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.770\nWe also have identified here,\nwhat we call process roles.\n\n201\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.740\nThese are what roles and\n\n202\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.420\nwhat skills we need,\nin order to get off from broken to fix.\n\n203\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.790\nWe also have process matrix and\n\n204\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.870\nthat will tell us whether we\nare getting from broken to fix.\n\n205\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:06.100\nNow, we'll have a policy and a here in\nthis process control box at the top\n\n206\n00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.460\nwe've got this policy that\ntells us what our ethics are.\n\n207\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.070\nWhat our way of working is and\nhow we're going to do it.\n\n208\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.440\nBecause I just mention\nincident management but\n\n209\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.400\ndon't forget we do this for\nevery single process.\n\n210\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.450\nAnd we have a defined process\nowner somebody who takes\n\n211\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.020\nownership of that process, and\nwho ensures that process is documented.\n\n212\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.730\nNow, I want to bring you down to here\nwhere it says process improvements.\n\n213\n00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:37.980\nNotice that we have an arrow going\ndirectly from our outputs to feedback.\n\n214\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.520\nAnd that's what we called\nour feedback loop, and\n\n215\n00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.030\na feedback then comes down and\ncomes into processed improvements.\n\n216\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.021\nIn other words, so when we use tool\nservice we're gonna conduct a.\n\n217\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.910\nSurvey hopefully,\n\n218\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.380\nwait our customers to see whether they\nhave actually had their service restored.\n\n219\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.150\nAnd we also conduct a lessons learn,\nwhat work well?\n\n220\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.010\nAnd we'll use that to improve\nour process in the future.\n\n221\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.870\nWe also conduct the lessons learn\nwith what didn't work so well too.\n\n222\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.420\nAnd we use that to improve\nagain in the future.\n\n223\n00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.520\nNow, let's bring you down to this\nblue box at the bottom here, and\n\n224\n00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.180\nyou'll notice you see two\nfamiliar words in here.\n\n225\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.250\nThe words resources and capabilities.\n\n226\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.230\nSo these are the people, and\nthe tools, and the experience, and\n\n227\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.860\nthe hardware, and the PCs,\netc., that they use in\n\n228\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.080\norder to get us from something\nbroken to something fixed.\n\n229\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.801\nNow, there's one thing\nthat I haven't mentioned.\n\n230\n00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:43.460\nAnd that's this.\n\n231\n00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.930\nThe trigger.\n\n232\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.050\nAnd I said to you that every\nprocess has to have a trigger.\n\n233\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.520\nSomething that starts it off.\n\n234\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.320\nIncident management doesn't just happen.\n\n235\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.630\nSo, that trigger could be something like.\n\n236\n00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.860\nAn event that's occurred that's been\nnotified to us through event management.\n\n237\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.470\nAnd they automatically raised a trigger.\n\n238\n00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.410\nAutomatically raised an incident, sorry.\n\n239\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.740\nWell that trigger could be someone called\nin the service desk, or somebody picking\n\n240\n00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:16.180\nup their cell phone and logging a call\nvia the app to raise an incident, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.390\nThat's the trigger.\n\n242\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.480\nAnd all processes have to have a trigger.\n\n243\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.420\nAlthough some those\ntriggers can be automated.\n\n244\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.450\nOkay, so a function or\na functional area as we like to call it.\n\n245\n00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.620\nWell, let's go back to\nthat previous slide, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.640\nAnd that previous slide, we have this\nblue box and that blue box represented\n\n247\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.780\nthe resources and the capabilities that\nwe needed to undertake the process Well,\n\n248\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.840\nwe have what we call teams of people,\ngroups of people, we call them functions.\n\n249\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.750\nAnd we use those functions to\ncarry out those processes.\n\n250\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.920\nIn other words, that blue box represents\nthe role of our functional areas.\n\n251\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:02.630\nAnd we can structure our functions into\ngroups, teams, departments, and divisions.\n\n252\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.880\nWe can do whatever we want in regards to\nthe structure of our IT organization.\n\n253\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.800\nRemember, we've got to deliver\nvalue to our organization, and so\n\n254\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.120\nit really is down to us, how we structure\nourselves to deliver that value.\n\n255\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.260\nIs not a prescription.\n\n256\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.600\nIt's not a one size fits all pill that's\ngoing to resolve any issues that you might\n\n257\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.470\nhave within IT.\n\n258\n00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:29.130\nAnd, it's certainly not gonna tell you\nhow you need to structure yourselves.\n\n259\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.123\nNow, as we move through the other\nservice operation modules,\n\n260\n00:15:33.123 --> 00:15:37.794\nyou'll see that there are various ways\nto structure and if we're going to\n\n261\n00:15:37.794 --> 00:15:42.766\nserve a strategy in looks at the service\nstrategy life cycle, you'll see that\n\n262\n00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:47.813\nthere is an evolution for the structure\nin IT organization, and we certainly go\n\n263\n00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:52.751\ninto a lot more depth of structures in\nthe service strategy life cycle phase.\n\n264\n00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:57.072\nSo a function then is a group of\npeople and the tools that they use,\n\n265\n00:15:57.072 --> 00:15:58.891\nthe skills that they have.\n\n266\n00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:01.792\nI like to refer to them\nmore as functional areas.\n\n267\n00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:10.630\nBecause as I said we do not have\na prescriptive answer to your structure.\n\n268\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.810\nYour structure will be how you\nwant your structure to look.\n\n269\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.680\nSo, within every single process and\nI already mentioned, and\n\n270\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.250\nif I just I'm going to jump back now\nto this particular process model.\n\n271\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.860\nYou'll see that we have\nthat red box at the top and\n\n272\n00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.750\nthat red box is our process control,\nand so\n\n273\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:34.710\nwith every single process we have in\nthe top left corner a process owner.\n\n274\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.740\nNow, if we were to use\nsomething called a RACI matrix,\n\n275\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:45.210\nwhich we cover in great depth\nin service foundation itself.\n\n276\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.560\nWell, you'll see that we have\na role called Accountability, okay?\n\n277\n00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.750\nAnd accountability is where the buck\nstops, if we wanna use that saying, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:53.750 --> 00:17:01.630\nAccountable means somebody who takes\nownership 9f a particular process and\n\n279\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.600\nensures that it's performed according\nto not just the documented processes,\n\n280\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.870\nbut also any service level\ntargets that may exist.\n\n281\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:14.940\nSo when you see the word accountable,\nI want you to use the word ensured\n\n282\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.350\nas part of that sort of Relationships\nthat goes on in your mind, okay?\n\n283\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.140\nSo accountable means ensured.\n\n284\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.800\nSo, the process owner ensures that\nall of those bullet points happen.\n\n285\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.920\nHe takes accountability for ensuring\nthat all of those bullet points happen.\n\n286\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.780\nYou know what?\n\n287\n00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.620\nHe may delegate\nthe responsibility to do that\n\n288\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:42.860\nto the process manager, but the fact\nis that he insures that it happens,\n\n289\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.030\nhe doesn't necessarily\nhave to do it all himself.\n\n290\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:51.070\nNow, the process manager\nis accountable for,\n\n291\n00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.250\nmore basically, whatever the process\nowner tells him, but no,\n\n292\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.960\nthe process manager is accountable for\nthe day-to-day operations of the process.\n\n293\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.220\nSo, if you look at the bullet points here,\nhe's reviewing KPIs,\n\n294\n00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.690\nhe's making sure everybody's\ngot the right skills.\n\n295\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.440\nHe's going to monitor on performance,\n\n296\n00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.240\nhe's going to make sure we've got enough\npeople to be able to perform the process.\n\n297\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.430\nAnd he's also going to be providing\nfeedback to the Process Owner.\n\n298\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.820\nSo, the process owner is a figurehead but\nis also somebody who\n\n299\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.960\nensures that we've got the policies\nthat we've got the right documentation.\n\n300\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.790\nHe takes accountability for\npublishing the process etc.\n\n301\n00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.280\nAnd even improving it.\n\n302\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.070\nBut the process manager manages\nthe process on a day to day basis.\n\n303\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.610\nI want you to think about\nincident management again, and\n\n304\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.420\nI want you to think\nabout the service desk.\n\n305\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.430\nAnd what we may have,\nespecially in the service desk,\n\n306\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:51.720\nwhere we have multiple shifts, we will\nhave a service desk manager who sits\n\n307\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.190\nin an overall accountability for\nthe service desk.\n\n308\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.350\nWe would consider them to be the incident\nmanagement process all in all,\n\n309\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:05.080\ntakes ownership for the entire service\ntest for incident management period.\n\n310\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.130\nOkay.\n\n311\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.940\nAnd then, we got the process manager,\nso think of this as your chief leaders.\n\n312\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.420\nOkay, your team leaders.\n\n313\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.620\nThey are the people that\nmanage the services,\n\n314\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.630\ncan manage incident management\non that middle level.\n\n315\n00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.340\nOn a day to day basis on\na team by team basis.\n\n316\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.300\nAnd then, we have what we call\nthe process practitioners.\n\n317\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.840\nAnd for incidence management now\nwill be service analysts and\n\n318\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.670\nnow the people that carry out one or\n\n319\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.260\nmore of those process activities\nworking with other stakeholders.\n\n320\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.650\nStakeholders remember from a previous\nsession, is any interested party.\n\n321\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.050\nSo, a stakeholder can be a user,\na customer, it can be your colleague,\n\n322\n00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.700\nit can be somebody in a second level or\nthird level.\n\n323\n00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.780\nSporty somebody that you escalate to,\n\n324\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.400\none thing that a process\npractitioner has to do though,\n\n325\n00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.050\na process practitioner has to ensure the\nprocess documentation is kept up to date.\n\n326\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.800\nI have mentioned as we\nare moving to actual\n\n327\n00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:09.130\nprocesses within service operation, I have\nmentioned that in incident management,\n\n328\n00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.330\nall incidents have to be logged.\n\n329\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.110\nAnd you know what,\n\n330\n00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.590\nthat is the responsibility\nof the process practitioner.\n\n331\n00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.930\nTo ensure that all incidents are logged.\n\n332\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.150\nAnd that's not just for\nincident management by the way,\n\n333\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.110\nthat's for every single process to.\n\n334\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.270\nThere has to be relevant documentation\nto ensure that the process is happening.\n\n335\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.820\nOtherwise the process owner has\ngot absolutely nothing to go on.\n\n336\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.360\nAnd then, we're back to that,\nwell, because I think so\n\n337\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.600\nmetric when somebody says is the process\neffective or is it efficient.\n\n338\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.190\nAnd because I think so,\nit's just not good enough.\n\n339\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.880\nSo, let's move on from processes then and\nthen just to wrap this session up,\n\n340\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.640\nlet's take a look at\nthe services themselves, okay.\n\n341\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.980\nEvery single service must\nhave the service owner.\n\n342\n00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.720\nAnd that is a service owner within IT,\n\n343\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.740\nthere's an important\ndifferentiation there, okay?\n\n344\n00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:12.160\nThat service owner takes accountability\nfor the entire IT service.\n\n345\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.830\nAs we move through into service operation,\nand\n\n346\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:21.130\nas we've looked previously at\nthe life cycle phases within ITIL,\n\n347\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:26.220\nyou'll see that there were 20\nodd processes, well that's\n\n348\n00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.210\nservice owner does not take accountability\nfor all of those processes, okay?\n\n349\n00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.620\nAnd that service owner takes\naccountability of the service and\n\n350\n00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.220\nthat diagram in the bottom\nright hand corner there,\n\n351\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:42.420\nyou will see that each process\napplies to each service.\n\n352\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.200\nSo if we looked at process 1 and\nwe said that that was incident management,\n\n353\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.780\nwell incident management applies\nto every single service.\n\n354\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.710\nAnd problem management applies\nto every single service.\n\n355\n00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.980\nThen request fulfillment applies\nto every single service.\n\n356\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.800\nBut you will notice that each\nservice is separate, and\n\n357\n00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.160\nso each service or each silo lies it\nis there will have a service owner and\n\n358\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.230\nwe use that word accountable again and\nwe use the word ensure.\n\n359\n00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:14.390\nOkay, they ensure that value is delivered\n\n360\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:19.350\nto the organization, so\nthey'll liaise with the process owners but\n\n361\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.930\nthey liaise with business\nrelationship management.\n\n362\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.000\nThey will liaise with our organization.\n\n363\n00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.440\nAnd they will be present in\nour service review meetings,\n\n364\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.580\nwhich is where we review performance\nagainst those service level targets,\n\n365\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.370\nin service level management and\nwith our customer as well.\n\n366\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.170\nSo, I expect the service owner\nto be present with that.\n\n367\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.510\nUltimately the service owner takes\naccountability for a service.\n\n368\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.170\nSo, in this particular section here, then,\n\n369\n00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:53.490\nwell in the last two sections we've\ndone a very, very brief overview.\n\n370\n00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:59.199\nOf some of the fundamentals that we\nlearned within our IT foundation class.\n\n371\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.300\nNow, I do understand that\nthere is a lot to learn there,\n\n372\n00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.780\nso please feel free to browse\nfurther the IT foundation\n\n373\n00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:13.300\nmaterial that is available\nhere through ITPRO.TV.\n\n374\n00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.820\nBut, what I would ask you to do know\nis obviously to move in to your service\n\n375\n00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:23.610\noperation material and to take a look\nat our other service operation modules.\n\n376\n00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.550\nAlright, Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us out and reminding us of some of\n\n377\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.090\nthose foundational concepts that we may\nbe a little bit weak on, but now with\n\n378\n00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:37.440\nthis refresher, it means we're ready\nto head on to our ITIL intermedia show.\n\n379\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520\nWell, great place for us to sign off then.\n\n380\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.480\nFor IT pro TV, I'm your host Ronny Wong.\n\n381\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.680\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n382\n00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.382\n&gt;&gt; Stay turned now for\nyour ITIL intermedia introduction.\n\n383\n00:23:48.382 --> 00:23:54.442\n[MUSIC]\n\n384\n00:23:54.442 --> 00:23:57.451\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:12.045\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.626\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:18.590\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n6\n00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.910\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n7\n00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.300\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat service strategy values.\n\n8\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.080\nAnd here to help us get started right is\ngonna be our ITIL master, Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.764\nJo, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:31.840\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.790\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine Jo, and I hope you are\ndoing well as we get started into service\n\n13\n00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.650\nstrategy and\ntalking about the values here.\n\n14\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.870\nSo Jo in terms of talking about value of\nservice strategy, why is it so important.\n\n15\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.630\nWe understand that we need a strategy.\n\n16\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.515\nWhat is the true value and\nnature of what we're talking about?\n\n17\n00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:53.978\n&gt;&gt; Well, server strategy is a first\nlife cycle phase within ITIL, and\n\n18\n00:00:53.978 --> 00:00:57.816\nof course everybody has seen\nthe ITIL foundation shows and\n\n19\n00:00:57.816 --> 00:01:01.435\nhave take the ITIL foundation\ntest in order to be here.\n\n20\n00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:04.490\nAnd so we know that this\nis where the magic starts.\n\n21\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.610\nThis is where we come up with\nour ideas for our new services.\n\n22\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.530\nThis is also where we liaise\nwith our business and\n\n23\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.400\nwhere we get to understand\nexactly how they work.\n\n24\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.938\nThis is where we define our strategies for\nhow we govern within IT.\n\n25\n00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:22.553\nAnd this is also where we ensure that our\nstrategy matches the business strategy, so\n\n26\n00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:25.414\nthat we're both heading in\nthe same direction, and\n\n27\n00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:28.240\nnot in two opposite directions.\n\n28\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.550\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo, when it comes down\nto a value, and we talk about service\n\n29\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.410\nstrategy value here, where are we\ngoing to begin looking at this value?\n\n30\n00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.990\n&gt;&gt; Well let's first look at the purpose.\n\n31\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.550\nLet's look at why we're here.\n\n32\n00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.090\nWhat is the purpose of service strategy?\n\n33\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.390\nAnd we can sum this up in four Ps,\nas we call them.\n\n34\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.550\nNow these are our four Ps of service\nstrategy, not to be confused with the four\n\n35\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.000\nps of service design that you\nlearnt in your foundation class and\n\n36\n00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.330\nthen we'll cover it again in\nthe E-service Design class.\n\n37\n00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.558\nSo the four Ps of service strategy\nare perspective, position, plans, and\n\n38\n00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:03.226\npatterns.\n\n39\n00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:04.870\nAnd what does that actually mean?\n\n40\n00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.850\nIt says here that the purpose\nis to define the four Ps\n\n41\n00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.670\nthat we need a service provider,\nthat's us,\n\n42\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.650\nneeds to be able to execute to meet\nthe organization's business outcomes.\n\n43\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.630\nDon't forget a service.\n\n44\n00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.263\nThe definition of a service is a means of\ndelivering value by facilitating outcomes\n\n45\n00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:28.930\nthat the customer wants to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n46\n00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.290\nSo in other words,\nwe want to facilitate business outcomes,\n\n47\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.281\nwe don't want to deliver those\noutcomes because we can't.\n\n48\n00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.829\nWe're facilitating in outcomes.\n\n49\n00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.810\nAnd a service isn't about an application.\n\n50\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.130\nA service is not Microsoft Outlook,\n\n51\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.190\nthe service is actually the ability\nto send and receive email.\n\n52\n00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.460\nNow we won't receive that email for\nyou, we wont read it for\n\n53\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.240\nyou, we can't type that email for you.\n\n54\n00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.190\nWhat we can do is facilitate that outcome.\n\n55\n00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.060\nBut then yet at the end of the day,\nthe business still has to sit down,\n\n56\n00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.930\ntype that email and press Send.\n\n57\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.910\nWe will just facilitate it.\n\n58\n00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.040\nAnd we will provide absolutely\neverything that's needed\n\n59\n00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.900\nin order to be able to\nfacilitate that outcome.\n\n60\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.890\nSo to help you in the business, sit\ndown and type the email and press send.\n\n61\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.390\nSo, then, if what we want to do is meet\nthose outcomes or facilitate those\n\n62\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.870\noutcomes, then we have to understand what\nthe outcomes are that the business wants,\n\n63\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.720\nand we have to understand what\ndirection the business is going in.\n\n64\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.820\nSo let's take a look\nthen at our perspective.\n\n65\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.179\nWhat perspective is our organization going\nin, and how does that translate to us?\n\n66\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.889\nSo we look at this from\na very high level view point.\n\n67\n00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.934\nI hate to use the word perspective again,\n\n68\n00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:50.620\nbut from a very high level view point\n,what is our organization doing?\n\n69\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.140\nAnd we split this into three.\n\n70\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.821\nSo we split this into,\nwe have acronyms cuz we like acronyms.\n\n71\n00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:57.246\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is ITIL, right?\n\n72\n00:03:57.246 --> 00:04:01.320\nSo we have RTB, GTB, and TTB.\n\n73\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.933\nRTB means simply, run the business.\n\n74\n00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:09.597\nAnd run the business is a strategy for an\norganization that is not looking to grow.\n\n75\n00:04:09.597 --> 00:04:13.341\nSo these are strategies that\nare generally, and I say generally, but\n\n76\n00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:15.790\nit really depends on the organization.\n\n77\n00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.240\nThey're generally used for\nnot-for-profit organizations, for\n\n78\n00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.530\ngovernment organizations,\n\n79\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.780\ngovernment departments as well, where\nthey simply just want to tread water.\n\n80\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.640\nThey want to just maintain the status quo.\n\n81\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.482\nNow, there are other organizations\nthat use that strategy as well or\n\n82\n00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:35.130\nthat have that perspective as we'd say.\n\n83\n00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.955\nBecause some organizations might want\nto take a breather before they want to\n\n84\n00:04:38.955 --> 00:04:39.740\ngrow anymore.\n\n85\n00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.510\nMaybe they want to consolidate.\n\n86\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.901\nMaybe they're grown very rapidly and\nthey just need to sit down, just maintain\n\n87\n00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:50.176\nthe status quo for a year or two before\nthey launch any further growth, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:52.040\nSo that's run the business.\n\n89\n00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.172\nNow that translates to\nus in a way that we have\n\n90\n00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:01.902\nto be able to support that perspective.\n\n91\n00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:05.160\nAnd that perspective is just\nto maintain the status quo.\n\n92\n00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.410\nWell of course,\n\n93\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.570\nyou might think that that means that we\nin IT then don't have to do anything.\n\n94\n00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.020\nWe just have to sit back and\nmaintain a stable enviroment.\n\n95\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.820\nWell, that's not true.\n\n96\n00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.259\nCuz even an organization that just wants\nto maintain the status quo has still gotta\n\n97\n00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:18.782\nchange.\n\n98\n00:05:18.782 --> 00:05:22.270\nWindows 95 is not gonna be\nsupported forever, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.190\nSo we still have to make changes.\n\n100\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.201\nWe're not trying to be innovative\nin that particular environment, but\n\n101\n00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:30.920\nwe still have to make changes.\n\n102\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.308\nAnd then we have the organizational\nperspective of grow the business,\n\n103\n00:05:34.308 --> 00:05:35.780\nwhich is a fairly obvious one.\n\n104\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.550\nThat's where our business wants to grow.\n\n105\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.290\nAnd in that perspective then we in IT\nhave to support that by being innovative.\n\n106\n00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.360\nBy looking for new ways to\nfacilitate business outcomes and\n\n107\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.483\nto facilitate change in business outcomes.\n\n108\n00:05:52.483 --> 00:05:55.530\nAnd then we have the perspective\nof transforming the business,\n\n109\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.430\nwhich is doing something completely\ndifferent outside of our industry sector.\n\n110\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.430\nI think of one particular organization\nthat's very, very good at transforming and\n\n111\n00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.450\nthey do it through acquisitions and\nthrough franchises but\n\n112\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.980\nnevertheless they started\noff with airplanes or\n\n113\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.530\nI think they may have started\noff with transatlantic flights.\n\n114\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.250\nAnyway, they transformed and\nthey produce or\n\n115\n00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.610\nthey perform finances now, and\nso they have credit cards etc.\n\n116\n00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.070\nThey're a very big player\nin fibre optical cables and\n\n117\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.895\nfibre optic provisions, TV provision and\ninternet provision within the UK.\n\n118\n00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:40.635\nThey also perform well,\ncellular services as well.\n\n119\n00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:46.252\nSo provide cellphones, mobile telephones\nand various countries around the world.\n\n120\n00:06:46.252 --> 00:06:51.260\nAnd every time they've grown, and I think\nwe're now in to space exploration as well.\n\n121\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.130\nEvery time they've grown\nthey have transformed.\n\n122\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.941\nThey have stepped outside of their comfort\nzone and outside of their industry sector.\n\n123\n00:06:59.941 --> 00:07:04.430\nNow we'll look further at that as we\nmove through service strategy and\n\n124\n00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.510\nwhat that actually means to IT.\n\n125\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.370\nBut, right now that means that\nwe've got to be really innovative.\n\n126\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.299\nWe've got to not just be\nreactive to the business, but\n\n127\n00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:16.855\nwe've got to be very proactive as well,\nokay?\n\n128\n00:07:16.855 --> 00:07:20.897\nCuz we have to understand that the\nbusiness could change at any moment and\n\n129\n00:07:20.897 --> 00:07:22.230\nwe've got to be there.\n\n130\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.290\nWe've got to drive that transformation.\n\n131\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.750\nSo that's the perspective\nof the organization.\n\n132\n00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.680\nAnd that's how we have to react to it.\n\n133\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.520\nBut then what about the position?\n\n134\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.310\nWell, the position is very simply\nwhere are we in the world against our\n\n135\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.090\ncompetition?\n\n136\n00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:40.855\nNow if we're talking about government\nenvironment, government department,\n\n137\n00:07:40.855 --> 00:07:44.035\nthen obviously where we are in\nthe world against that competition\n\n138\n00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:45.460\nis probably not that important.\n\n139\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.735\nBut if you're talking about\nan organization that is making a profit,\n\n140\n00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:54.597\nthat is looking to grow, then that\nposition actually could be very important.\n\n141\n00:07:54.597 --> 00:07:59.059\nAnd so if our competitors, sorry,\nare at second in the world and\n\n142\n00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:04.114\nwe're at number three then we probably\nwanna get to number one, right?\n\n143\n00:08:04.114 --> 00:08:07.986\nWhich then,\nthese two perspective impositions,\n\n144\n00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:13.820\nwill drive what the plans are for\nthe future, for the organization.\n\n145\n00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.090\nAnd therefore that has to drive our plans.\n\n146\n00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.740\nSo the organization, well that will\ndictate how our four P's look.\n\n147\n00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.750\nSo the perspective and the organization.\n\n148\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.720\nWell, that drives the plans,\nthe plans that they have for the future.\n\n149\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.350\nAnd therefore the perspective and position\nthat we have within our IT service\n\n150\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.870\nprovider that has to drive our plans,\nthey have to be aligned to the business.\n\n151\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.670\nAnd then of course it's our plans\nthat then drive our patterns,\n\n152\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.860\nour patterns of activity.\n\n153\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.780\nAnd we look more into those when we take\nabout patterns of business activity within\n\n154\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.230\ndemand management.\n\n155\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.180\nBut our patterns are actually what we do.\n\n156\n00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:59.750\nAnd it's those patterns and we're going\nto take this arrow, this arrow here from\n\n157\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.870\nour patterns, and we're going to go right\nthe way back to the beginning as well.\n\n158\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:09.340\nBecause you see, it's our plans that drive\nour patterns, the way that we behave.\n\n159\n00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.410\nAnd it's our patterns,\n\n160\n00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.980\nthe way that we behave that will\nactually drive our position.\n\n161\n00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.780\nSo we come right the way\nback the way that we behave,\n\n162\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.360\nour patterns will drive our position\nin the marketplace, and that will drive\n\n163\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.699\nour organization to go from number\nthree right the way up to number one.\n\n164\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.370\nSo these are our four Ps.\n\n165\n00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.320\nAnd it's really important that we\nunderstand the four Ps as the organization\n\n166\n00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.680\nas well as how that translates to us\n\n167\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.230\nwithin our IT service provider and\nenvironment.\n\n168\n00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.170\nSo what do we have to do here in\nservice strategy that is really,\n\n169\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.480\nclearly identifying those four Ps.\n\n170\n00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.240\nAnd clearly identify who our customers\nare, who our organization is.\n\n171\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.030\nWhat services they want.\n\n172\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.710\nRemember, service is a means\nof facilitating an outcome.\n\n173\n00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.900\nIt's not actually about delivery outlook,\n\n174\n00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:08.960\nit's about facilitating the outcome,\nwhich is to send and receive email.\n\n175\n00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.570\nSo here in service strategy, we've got\nto understand what services we have.\n\n176\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:19.620\nWhat new services would fit into that\nenvironment to help us with those four Ps.\n\n177\n00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.220\nWe have to understand what value\nmeans to the organization.\n\n178\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.970\nAnd we have to also understand a very,\n\n179\n00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.950\nvery clear provisioning\nmodel as it says there.\n\n180\n00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.290\nWhat that means is how our services\nhang together and how we provide them.\n\n181\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.640\nWe have shared components to our services.\n\n182\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.580\nAnd we'll look at that in a lot more depth\nlater, but you don't have one network for\n\n183\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.420\nemail, and another network for office,\nand another network for your Internet.\n\n184\n00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.430\nYou have one network.\n\n185\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.067\nSo if we take a look at our\ntriangles as we have them here,\n\n186\n00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:59.890\non the left-hand side we have\nthe organization and the organization,\n\n187\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:04.320\nwell the CEO will tend to\nfeed down into the customers.\n\n188\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.620\nNow a customer is a stakeholder and\n\n189\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.950\na customer is somebody who has influence\nover whether the money is spent.\n\n190\n00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:18.190\nAnd in IT terms,\na customer can be external but\n\n191\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.160\nlet's just look at this from\nan internal perspective right now.\n\n192\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.910\nIt's generally a business unit manager or\na cross center manager,\n\n193\n00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:29.970\nsomebody who can influence\nwhether IT budget is given to us.\n\n194\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.770\nAnd then we have users.\n\n195\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.820\nAnd users are people\nthat use the services.\n\n196\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.920\nNow the CEO,\ntreats everybody exactly the same.\n\n197\n00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.060\nSo in terms of IT,\n\n198\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.660\nwell we're just another business unit,\nif we're an internal service provider.\n\n199\n00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.800\nSo the CEO will not differentiate and\n\n200\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.170\nwill not tell us exactly\nwhat our strategy should be.\n\n201\n00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.550\nIt's up to us within IT\nto understand how our\n\n202\n00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.860\nstrategy fits in and\nhelps us achieve the business strategy.\n\n203\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.770\nSo the CEO is concerned\nwith the customers and\n\n204\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.670\nthe users within\nthe organization as a whole.\n\n205\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.970\nWhere as the CIO,\nthe Chief Information Officer,\n\n206\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:17.470\nwell, he is concerned with IT.,\nwith us as a service provider.\n\n207\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.590\nSo at the tactical level, he has\nthe service managers, the service owners,\n\n208\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.940\nthose people who take responsibility for\nthe services.\n\n209\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.980\nAnd also our process owners\nwill sit at this level as well.\n\n210\n00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.330\nAnd underneath we have our\noperational staff and so\n\n211\n00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.900\nwe've got a service desk\nthere as an example.\n\n212\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.660\nNow the arrow on the left hand side\ntalks about the volume of communication.\n\n213\n00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.240\nWhat that really means is that I\ndon't expect somebody at CEO or\n\n214\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.670\nCIO level, to be talking directly\nto somebody at the end user level,\n\n215\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.700\nor to somebody at the analyst level.\n\n216\n00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.120\nBecause, they're gonna be communicating\nsomething completely different.\n\n217\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.360\nSo we've got to be very careful.\n\n218\n00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.630\nWe'll talk about communication a lot later\non in future episodes in service strategy,\n\n219\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.830\nbut I don't expect that that the CIO and\n\n220\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:15.130\nthe CEO are going to communicate\nat an operational level.\n\n221\n00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:19.230\nSo we have to understand\nwhere our relationships lie,\n\n222\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.640\nand who we have a relationship with.\n\n223\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.160\nAnd our analysts will have\na relationship with the end users, but\n\n224\n00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.800\nour process managers, such as our\nbusiness relationship managers,\n\n225\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.190\nwhile they will have\na relationship with the customers.\n\n226\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.810\nThe people who have the purse strings.\n\n227\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.810\nSo what does service strategy do?\n\n228\n00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.110\nWell, service strategy as I've said,\nthis is where the magic starts.\n\n229\n00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.210\nThis is where we decide on our direction.\n\n230\n00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.660\nOur direction in terms of how\nwe're going to be governed and\n\n231\n00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.440\nwhat services we're going to provide.\n\n232\n00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.460\nAnd whether we're an internal or\nan external service provider,\n\n233\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.180\nand I've already mentioned the word\ninternal, just on the last slide,\n\n234\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.110\nwell of course we covered\nthat during foundation.\n\n235\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.060\nBut doesn't matter what type\nof service provider we are,\n\n236\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.010\nwe still have to know our direction.\n\n237\n00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.550\nWe still have to understand\nwho our customer is and\n\n238\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.560\nshow that we are aligned\nto their direction.\n\n239\n00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:19.380\nAnd so what we also do is well we provide\nguidance for those that are well,\n\n240\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.510\nas it says in profit seeking\nservice provision and for\n\n241\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.010\nthose that aren't in profit seeking.\n\n242\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:31.698\nIn other words what that\nreally means is that we do\n\n243\n00:14:31.698 --> 00:14:36.260\nnot look to make a profit\nourselves within IT.\n\n244\n00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.730\nWhat we do is seek to be\naligned to the organization.\n\n245\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.500\nAnd it doesn't matter whether\nthe organization is what we call\n\n246\n00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.990\na not-for-profit so a government\norganization, or maybe a charity.\n\n247\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:52.110\nOr whether our organization is\na profit generating organization that\n\n248\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.300\nmay be seeking to grow.\n\n249\n00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:00.190\nWell, we will support, we will be aligned\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n250\n00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.940\nSo what about our aspect\nof service strategy?\n\n251\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.484\nWell, I've already covered them, okay?\n\n252\n00:15:04.484 --> 00:15:08.743\nThis is about defining what services\nwe are going to provide to meet\n\n253\n00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:10.880\nthe organizations objectives.\n\n254\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.188\nThat is number one.\n\n255\n00:15:12.188 --> 00:15:17.570\nAnd number two is all about, well,\nhow we're going to deliver those services?\n\n256\n00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.521\nSo how we're gonna govern ourselves?\n\n257\n00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:25.850\nHow we are going to direct and\ncontrol and manage our IT services.\n\n258\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.516\nSo the value to the business then of\nservice strategy should be fairly\n\n259\n00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:36.250\nself-explanatory, given what I've said,\nokay.\n\n260\n00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.050\nWhat we want to do is to ensure\nthat all of our services and\n\n261\n00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:46.180\nall of our activities have a direct\nconnection to the organization.\n\n262\n00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:52.444\nIn other words we understand exactly what\nvalue we're providing to the business.\n\n263\n00:15:52.444 --> 00:15:57.317\nThere's something in the ITIL\npublications, in the ITIL books,\n\n264\n00:15:57.317 --> 00:16:02.625\nthat talks about everybody understanding\nexactly what their role is and\n\n265\n00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:07.759\neveryone within the IT service\nprovider understanding how their role\n\n266\n00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:13.000\ncontributes To the ability of\nthe business to achieve their outcomes.\n\n267\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.750\nNow, that's quite a challenge in one.\n\n268\n00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:21.330\nAnd I'm gonna ask you,\nRonnie, how often do\n\n269\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:26.270\nyou think it is that I could go into an\norganization and I can say to an analyst,\n\n270\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.540\nhey, do you know exactly what you\ndo in relation to the organization?\n\n271\n00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.349\nWhat do you think they say to me?\n\n272\n00:16:33.349 --> 00:16:37.008\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that they would think\nthat they would but they overall, once you\n\n273\n00:16:37.008 --> 00:16:40.502\nactually ask them and they answer,\nthey probably know what their job is but\n\n274\n00:16:40.502 --> 00:16:44.600\nthey don't know what its relationship\nto the entire organization is.\n\n275\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.050\n&gt;&gt; You're right and this is something\nthat we do have to get better at,\n\n276\n00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.360\nwithin IT as a whole.\n\n277\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:58.310\nBecause we do tend to be very\nexplicit in job descriptions and\n\n278\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:04.250\nin roles and responsibilities,\nand we do allow people to\n\n279\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:09.190\ncontribute to their own job descriptions,\nand their own roles and responsibilities.\n\n280\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.169\nBut how often do we actually\nput that in the context\n\n281\n00:17:13.169 --> 00:17:16.211\nof what it means to the organization?\n\n282\n00:17:16.211 --> 00:17:22.268\nI wonder and I sometimes ask, if I'm in\nan organization advising on ISO 2000 and\n\n283\n00:17:22.268 --> 00:17:26.192\nwe're preparing for an audit and\nI will say to people,\n\n284\n00:17:26.192 --> 00:17:29.980\ndo you know what your role\nis in the organization?\n\n285\n00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.685\nIf you weren't here tomorrow,\nwhat impact would it have to the business?\n\n286\n00:17:35.685 --> 00:17:38.320\nNow, what impact would it have\nto the rest of your team,\n\n287\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.350\nwhat impact would it have to the business?\n\n288\n00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.199\nAnd you'd be surprised how many people\nare not able to answer that question.\n\n289\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.340\nAnd one of the things that we say in\nI2 is that we should all be aware\n\n290\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.840\nof how our role contributes\nto the organization and\n\n291\n00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.720\nhow our role contributes to\nfacilitating those outcomes.\n\n292\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.890\nIf we feel valuable,\nwe're going to contribute more.\n\n293\n00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.170\nIf we don't feel valuable,\nthen sometimes it can be difficult for\n\n294\n00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.120\nus to maintain morale.\n\n295\n00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.830\nSo this is why we'll say,\nwe need to understand,\n\n296\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.010\nwe're about delivering\nvalue to the business.\n\n297\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.710\nSo we need to know what\nthe business values, and\n\n298\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.660\nwe need to know that we\nare making a difference.\n\n299\n00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.480\nAnd, exactly as it says in\nthat second bullet point,\n\n300\n00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.710\nit is that understanding within\nus as a service provider,\n\n301\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.030\nof exactly what makes our\norganization successful.\n\n302\n00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.680\nWe have to know our organization.\n\n303\n00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.580\nAnd when we talk about responding quickly\nto their changing needs, wouldn't it be\n\n304\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.490\nabsolutely perfect if actually we knew\nwhat their needs were before they changed?\n\n305\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:47.990\nOr even if we were to drive that change,\nbecause we had prepared for this.\n\n306\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.650\nWe were proactive and\n\n307\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.020\nwe actually understood what\nthey needed before they did.\n\n308\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.928\nThat's really where we'd\nlike to get as an ideal.\n\n309\n00:18:55.928 --> 00:19:00.451\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more about\nproactive versus reactive relationship\n\n310\n00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:01.270\nmanagement.\n\n311\n00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.540\nBut what we want to do is service\nstrategy, and what we have to do in order\n\n312\n00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.790\nto be a aligned to the organization is\nto keep that communication line open.\n\n313\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.500\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo, before we move on, on this\npoint that you were making about ensuring\n\n314\n00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.920\nthat everybody actually understood what\ntheir role was in your experience.\n\n315\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.950\nI know that this is kinda a little\nbit outside of the realm of ITIL.\n\n316\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.870\nBut is there something that you've seen\nin which a company is very easily been\n\n317\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.940\nable to take the person that really didn't\nknow and next time you came back, or\n\n318\n00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.260\njust a few months later, you came back and\nthe person knew exactly what his role was?\n\n319\n00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:44.140\n&gt;&gt; So is there a magical formula to this?\n\n320\n00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.951\nNo.\n\n321\n00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:47.825\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; There's definitely not.\n\n322\n00:19:47.825 --> 00:19:52.170\nThere's a TV program that's out\nin TV around the world actually,\n\n323\n00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:57.230\nit's not just in the US, it's in the UK\nand in other countries, as well.\n\n324\n00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.870\nWhere we see somebody\nfrom a board of directors\n\n325\n00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.210\nwho has pretty much lost touch with\nthe way that the organization works.\n\n326\n00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:10.140\nAnd they go and they spend some\ntime working with employees.\n\n327\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.656\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n328\n00:20:11.656 --> 00:20:15.700\n&gt;&gt; And that's something that is a really,\nreally, really good technique.\n\n329\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.285\nNow, I'm not saying\nthat you go undercover.\n\n330\n00:20:17.285 --> 00:20:21.370\n[LAUGH] I'm not saying that, that should\nhappen but one of the first question that\n\n331\n00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:25.590\nI would ask if I'm doing some sort of\npreparation for an audit, I will ask\n\n332\n00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.490\npeople what do they know what that role\nis, what do they know how it contributes.\n\n333\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.250\nAnd I'll actually ask them whether they've\nspent any time with their end users and\n\n334\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.780\nwith their customers.\n\n335\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:39.640\nAnd it doesn't surprise me at all when I\nhear that, well, no, I've never done that.\n\n336\n00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or it's been quite a while since\n\n337\n00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.540\nI've done that.\n\n338\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.490\nYou only understand how your role\ncontributes if you understand what\n\n339\n00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.350\nthey do.\n\n340\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.630\nAnd we always advocate going and\n\n341\n00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.710\nspending time with your users\nunderstanding how they work.\n\n342\n00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n343\n00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.430\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nthis is not about doing their job for\n\n344\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.998\nthem but it's understanding how\nyou can help them do their job.\n\n345\n00:20:59.998 --> 00:21:01.620\nWe're supposed to deliver value and\n\n346\n00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.320\nwe want to deliver value in a way\nthat can facilitate their outcomes.\n\n347\n00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.270\nBut if you don't know how they achieve\ntheir outcomes then how can you\n\n348\n00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.510\nfacilitate them?\n\n349\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:16.130\nSo whilst there's no magic pill\nthat can fix absolutely everything,\n\n350\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.320\nthe first step I would always\nencourage everybody to do is to\n\n351\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.620\nget off their bums and go and\nsee what's really going on.\n\n352\n00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.335\nNow, that does involve having\nsenior management commitment.\n\n353\n00:21:26.335 --> 00:21:26.865\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n354\n00:21:26.865 --> 00:21:30.355\n&gt;&gt; Because that involves having\npeople out of their seats, and\n\n355\n00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:32.635\ngoing and seeing what's happening.\n\n356\n00:21:32.635 --> 00:21:36.745\nAnd, of course, if you're not around for\na day because you're going to spend\n\n357\n00:21:36.745 --> 00:21:40.910\ntime on a customer site, then someone's\ngonna have to cover your old for that day.\n\n358\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.540\nSo we have to have the senior\nmanagement commitment.\n\n359\n00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.280\nBut with the right commitment,\nit helps us in so many ways.\n\n360\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.650\nAnd it's not just understanding\nhow you contribute but\n\n361\n00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.860\nit's also building up a relationship.\n\n362\n00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going back to that slide there.\n\n363\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.523\nLook at the bottom bullet point there\nabout opening up solid lines of\n\n364\n00:21:58.523 --> 00:21:59.870\ncommunication.\n\n365\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:04.330\nIf you've got an interpersonal\nrelationship with people within IT and\n\n366\n00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:09.080\nthe business, then you'll find\nthat actually it works wonders for\n\n367\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.340\nthe value perception.\n\n368\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.440\nAnd we'll talk a lot more about\nvalue perception a little bit later.\n\n369\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:20.800\nSo let's just move on, if I may, if that's\nokay, with the other life cycle phases.\n\n370\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.590\nNow, everybody's covered the other\nlife cycle phases and foundation.\n\n371\n00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.120\nBut let's just look at what\nservice strategy does for\n\n372\n00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.549\nthe other life cycle phases.\n\n373\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.050\nWe already know that service strategy\nis where we come up with the ideas for\n\n374\n00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:34.240\nnew services.\n\n375\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.990\nWell, it's not where we come up with them,\n\n376\n00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.840\nbecause CSI has some input into that,\nas well.\n\n377\n00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.620\nContinual service improvement,\nas does anybody.\n\n378\n00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.200\nBut service strategy is\nwhere we store these ideas,\n\n379\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.150\nwhere we evaluate these ideas.\n\n380\n00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.770\nBut service strategy also\nprovides the direction for\n\n381\n00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.310\nall there are the life cycle phases.\n\n382\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.120\nSo service strategy to service design,\nwell,\n\n383\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.970\nnot only provides the business context and\nthe business objectives but\n\n384\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:08.590\nalso provides them with the new services,\nwith the approved business cases.\n\n385\n00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.511\nAnd it provides service\ndesign with guidance and\n\n386\n00:23:12.511 --> 00:23:17.206\nwith policies, but\nwithin which we should be operating.\n\n387\n00:23:17.206 --> 00:23:20.100\nWith service transition, again,\nwe're providing those policies.\n\n388\n00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:26.812\nAnd we are providing guidance on how\nto transition from service design,\n\n389\n00:23:26.812 --> 00:23:31.891\nfrom that design stage right away\nthrough into the development,\n\n390\n00:23:31.891 --> 00:23:35.492\nthe build, the test,\nthe implementation and\n\n391\n00:23:35.492 --> 00:23:40.232\nthe eventual early life support\ninto service operation,.\n\n392\n00:23:40.232 --> 00:23:43.153\nAnd then, of course,\nwith service operation, well,\n\n393\n00:23:43.153 --> 00:23:47.130\nservice strategy provides the policies for\nhow are we going to operate, for\n\n394\n00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.760\nhow we're going to manage\nour business as usual.\n\n395\n00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.870\nWe also provide here in service\nstrategy that articulation of value.\n\n396\n00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:59.160\nWhat value really means\nbecause service operation,\n\n397\n00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.910\nwell, they need to be able\nto deliver that value.\n\n398\n00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.254\nAnd then, CSI.\n\n399\n00:24:04.254 --> 00:24:09.870\nWell, CSI is the life cycle phase that has\nits tendrils into absolutely everything.\n\n400\n00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.150\nSo CSI is always looking for\nopportunities for\n\n401\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.400\nimprovement and service strategy\ntells CSI how we work right now.\n\n402\n00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.576\nThis is how we govern right\nat this moment in time.\n\n403\n00:24:20.576 --> 00:24:24.340\nAnd CSI will be continually\nchecking that we are aligned\n\n404\n00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.510\nwith the needs of the business.\n\n405\n00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.030\nAnd we'll be making recommendations\nto service strategy.\n\n406\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:34.160\nA service strategy, in turn,\ntells us where the business is going,\n\n407\n00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.340\nin what direction\nthe business is going in.\n\n408\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.250\nSo that's sort of\na strategy in a nutshell.\n\n409\n00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.830\nThis is why we need service strategy.\n\n410\n00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:47.050\nWithout service strategy having\nthe synergy between IT and\n\n411\n00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.640\nthe business can be very, very difficult.\n\n412\n00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.760\nAnd we have to first and foremost\nunderstand what direction our business\n\n413\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.970\nis going in,\nbecause that directs us within IT.\n\n414\n00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n415\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.350\nWell, thank you again for helping\nus to at least understand the value\n\n416\n00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:09.620\nthat we can find in service strategy to\nhelp us to get started in these different\n\n417\n00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.040\nparts of ITIL that we need for\nour organizations, as well.\n\n418\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.126\nRemember, this is really\nkinda the starting point.\n\n419\n00:25:15.126 --> 00:25:20.323\nIt's what Jo said that, this is really\nkind of the key that begins everything.\n\n420\n00:25:20.323 --> 00:25:24.770\nAll right, this is a great place for\nus to also end this episode.\n\n421\n00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.950\nFor ITProTv, I've been your host,\nRonnie Wong,\n\n422\n00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.120\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

Jo mentions that we must think about the competition against us as part of the strategy we take as well as opposing dynamics.  These opposing dynamics need to be balanced for a strategy to be effective, says Jo.  She also helps us by describing a service in the context of strategy too.",

ITProTv.\n\n4\n00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:15.851\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another bit\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:19.428\n&gt;&gt; You're walking\nthe IT Intermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:21.208\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n7\n00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:25.550\ntoday we're gonna be giving into\nservice strategy principles.\n\n8\n00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.424\nAnd here to help us, of course, is gonna\nbe our ITIL, Zarena herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:31.900\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.496\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhaving me Ronnie how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:37.896\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine Jo, now we really\ntalked about a service strategy principles\n\n12\n00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:41.969\nin a previous episode, not principles\nvalues in a previous episode.\n\n13\n00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.120\nAnd I was like, well,\nwe're not gonna be able to do that.\n\n14\n00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.010\nIn the previous episode so values\nare now moving in roman principle and\n\n15\n00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.980\nthis is same that we really need to at\nleast kind of make sure that we understand\n\n16\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.885\nfully coz there is a lot that we\nhave to actually dive into here, Jo.\n\n17\n00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:00.455\nSo where are we gonna begin?\n\n18\n00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:03.135\n&gt;&gt; You're right, there is a lot\nthat we've gotta dive into here.\n\n19\n00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:07.545\nSo in our last episode we looked\nat why we need a service strategy.\n\n20\n00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:10.915\nAnd now we look at what\nservice strategy really means,\n\n21\n00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:16.405\nand this is where we start to get into\nsome of the meat of service strategy.\n\n22\n00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:21.980\nSo we start off by firstly\nsorta acknowledging that\n\n23\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.750\nWe're not the only people\nin the world to do our job.\n\n24\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n25\n00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.250\n&gt;&gt; And that can be a really\ntough lesson to learn.\n\n26\n00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.187\nAnd in our first slide, and of course,\n\n27\n00:01:32.187 --> 00:01:35.844\nI hope everybody's downloaded\nthe materials to go along with the class.\n\n28\n00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:40.808\nSo that you can take notes and actually\nmake notes, print them out, take notes,\n\n29\n00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:45.830\nor make notes on your PDF,\nof exactly what we're talking about here.\n\n30\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.930\nBecause it will help you in your test but\nit will also help your comprehension,\n\n31\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.910\nhelp you understanding as well.\n\n32\n00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.191\nSo when it says firstly acknowledge\nthat we've got competition,\n\n33\n00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:58.068\nwe don't mean that acknowledge that\nyour organization has got competition.\n\n34\n00:01:58.068 --> 00:02:01.370\nYes, we do, but we did that\nwhen we looked at our four P's.\n\n35\n00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.690\nAnd we're gonna look at them in\na little more depth in a moment.\n\n36\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.690\nBut we also have to a knowledge that\nwe have got competition too and\n\n37\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.750\nit doesn't matter where we work.\n\n38\n00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.250\nWe may think our work is secure,\nwe may think our position within IT\n\n39\n00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.870\nis secure and that don't worry our\norganization will never ever do so.\n\n40\n00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.340\nThere comes point and time in any\norganization's life when they're going to\n\n41\n00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.560\nevaluate whether you are delivering,\nnot just value for\n\n42\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.560\nmoney, but\nwhether you're delivering value, in total.\n\n43\n00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.850\nAnd that means whether you are actually\ndelivering services that they want to see.\n\n44\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.730\nWhether you're facilitating their outcomes\nand whether you're dealing with any\n\n45\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.230\nissues that arrive inefficient and\nineffective way.\n\n46\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.980\nLets face it,\nwe have all selected a provider,\n\n47\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.690\na service provider whether it be for\na phone for the internet or a TV.\n\n48\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.200\nBased on their customer service.\n\n49\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.030\nWe've all done this.\n\n50\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.770\nIf an organization might\nhave great service,\n\n51\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.390\nit might actually give us\neverything that we want.\n\n52\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.480\nBut when you call them up,\nyou get poor customer service.\n\n53\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.690\nThat's going to influence your decision.\n\n54\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.810\nAnd it's exactly the same\nwith our organization.\n\n55\n00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.750\nNow, I have worked with government\ndepartments that have outsourced their IT.\n\n56\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.570\nAnd actually I have.\n\n57\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.920\nHelped with the transition from internal\ngovernment departments, internal\n\n58\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.930\nservice providers to external outsource\nservice providers within government.\n\n59\n00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.470\nSo we can't afford to sit here and\nsay, that will never happen.\n\n60\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.110\nThat's the first thing that we've got to\nacknowledge is that we are in competition.\n\n61\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.790\nAnd there is always somebody knocking\non the door of your CIO offering to do\n\n62\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.460\nyour role for less money and\nto a higher quality, always.\n\n63\n00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.800\nNow whether they can actually deliver or\nnot is another matter.\n\n64\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.740\nBut you have to understand\nwhat your USP is, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.930\nWhat your unique selling\npoint is to your business.\n\n66\n00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.400\nAnd whether that be just your experience,\nmaybe that is your unique selling point.\n\n67\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.750\nMaybe it's the fact that you are\ncompletely aligned to your organization,\n\n68\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.800\nthat you know your\norganization like nobody else.\n\n69\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.700\nWell, if that's the case,\nthen that is a differentiator, and\n\n70\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.760\nwe need to market on that differentiator.\n\n71\n00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.260\nSo we need to demonstrate that we\nunderstand what the organization values.\n\n72\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.260\nLet's take a look at what we call opposing\ndynamics within service strategy.\n\n73\n00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.490\nAnd I'm not just talking\nabout the organization here,\n\n74\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.500\nI'm talking about us within IT.\n\n75\n00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.650\nWe gotta get the balance right\nbetween focusing on the future and\n\n76\n00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.250\nfocusing on the present.\n\n77\n00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.990\nIf we focus on the present, we're\nfocusing on the stability of our IT and\n\n78\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.180\nyou might turn around and say well that's\nokay, that's what our organization wants.\n\n79\n00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.500\nThey want IT stable, they don't want\nany interruption to their service,\n\n80\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.220\nwell that's great.\n\n81\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.630\nLike I said in a previous session, Windows\n95 is not going to be around forever so\n\n82\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.850\nthings have to change.\n\n83\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.993\nBut an organization is to\nfocused on the future.\n\n84\n00:05:12.993 --> 00:05:19.067\nAn IT service provider organization is to\nfocus on playing with the shiny new toys,\n\n85\n00:05:19.067 --> 00:05:24.210\nwell that leads to instability\nbecause that leads to lots of changes.\n\n86\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.729\nBecause we're always looking\nat the new shiny toys.\n\n87\n00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.610\nWe're always bringing something in.\n\n88\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.485\nAnd we're so busy focusing on the future\nthat we forget about the stability,\n\n89\n00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:36.260\nand just the business\nas usual of right now.\n\n90\n00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.170\nSo we've got to get that balance perfect,\nwe've gotta get it right.\n\n91\n00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.920\nIt says in that first bullet\npoint that the pace of change,\n\n92\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.450\nof business change is quickening.\n\n93\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.830\nEven now, we're in the 21st century and\nthings change.\n\n94\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.580\nAnd the thing is that we expect\nthings to change quickly.\n\n95\n00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.550\nThere was a point in time, not all that\nlong ago, and I'm showing my age now,\n\n96\n00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.280\nthat 20 years ago when\nthe idea of a cell phone\n\n97\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.320\nwith something that was very,\nvery innovative.\n\n98\n00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.940\nAnd people had a cell phone,\na mobile phone that wasn't really mobile.\n\n99\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.680\nIt came with a huge big box almost\nlike a brief case like a suit case.\n\n100\n00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.200\nWhich was actually the battery pack.\n\n101\n00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.210\nAnd you wore it on your shoulder.\n\n102\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.210\nIt was that big and cumbersome.\n\n103\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.270\nAnd that came out,\nI think in the 1980s sometime, and\n\n104\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.600\nwhen you think about it,\nthat particular model of cell phone,\n\n105\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.950\nthat particular model of mobile phone that\nwasn't really mobile was around for years.\n\n106\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.190\nAnd yet, now,\nevery single year you're chosen\n\n107\n00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.930\nmobile phone provider,\nyou're chosen piece of hardware.\n\n108\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.540\nWell, they update it at least\nonce a year nowadays an some\n\n109\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.970\nmobile phone providers update their\nhandsets more frequently than once a year.\n\n110\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.300\nThey bring out two or three mobiles every\nyear and each time it has a new feature.\n\n111\n00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.840\nThere used to be a time when you\nwould have a PC on your desk or\n\n112\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.270\nit wasn't a PC,\nit was a main frame terminal.\n\n113\n00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.830\nAnd you had that for three or four years.\n\n114\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.998\nNow, you wanna new laptop or\na new desktop or even a new tablet now.\n\n115\n00:07:14.998 --> 00:07:19.674\nYou want one every few months because\nthere's another one that's come out with\n\n116\n00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:23.810\nmore and more features, change\nhappens quicker now than it ever did.\n\n117\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.764\nAnd so we have to make sure\nthat we can be reactive and\n\n118\n00:07:26.764 --> 00:07:29.160\nyes we've got to look at the future.\n\n119\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.580\nBut we've still got to maintain the status\nquo, we've still gotta maintain stability.\n\n120\n00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.080\nAnd minimize disruption\nto the organization.\n\n121\n00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.360\nAnd then look at this improvement in\neffectiveness versus improvement in\n\n122\n00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.880\nfunctionality.\n\n123\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.027\nIt's pretty much exactly the same thing.\n\n124\n00:07:46.027 --> 00:07:48.239\nWe want to bring in new functionality.\n\n125\n00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:50.662\nWe want to improve our functionality, but\n\n126\n00:07:50.662 --> 00:07:53.297\nwe still got to maintain\nthat effectiveness.\n\n127\n00:07:53.297 --> 00:07:56.228\nWe still got to maintain that stability.\n\n128\n00:07:56.228 --> 00:08:00.564\nSo what we actually want to do is\nmake improvements in the stability,\n\n129\n00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:04.140\nreduce the amount of\ninterruptions to service.\n\n130\n00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.457\nBut we want to do that at the same time\nas we want to improve functionality.\n\n131\n00:08:08.457 --> 00:08:13.432\nWell, it doesn't necessarily follow that\nif you improve functionality then it's\n\n132\n00:08:13.432 --> 00:08:16.795\ngoing to make things more stable or\nmore unstable.\n\n133\n00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:20.815\nAnd that is going to mean an increase in\nthe number of interruptions to service.\n\n134\n00:08:20.815 --> 00:08:25.078\nSo, the number of failures but\nnevertheless what changes you make to\n\n135\n00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:28.689\nthe environment well,\nthe bigger the chance of failure.\n\n136\n00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:31.676\nSo again,\nyou've got to get that balance right.\n\n137\n00:08:31.676 --> 00:08:34.247\nAnd then what about value capture?\n\n138\n00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:38.752\nNow I don't know if we can expand\nthis because that looks very,\n\n139\n00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:40.369\nvery small right now.\n\n140\n00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:45.090\nYou'll see right at the very bottom,\nyou've got this balance between\n\n141\n00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.160\nvalue capture, launch and value capture\nduring an an ongoing operations.\n\n142\n00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.872\nWhat does that really mean?\n\n143\n00:08:52.872 --> 00:08:57.688\nWell, we talk, when we look at change\nmanagement and we look at this\n\n144\n00:08:57.688 --> 00:09:02.851\nfurther if you go into your service\ntransition course, Value Capture.\n\n145\n00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:07.971\nWell at the beginning when we\nfirst launch a new service we\n\n146\n00:09:07.971 --> 00:09:12.985\nperceive a completely different\nvalue on any service,\n\n147\n00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:17.802\nas what we do say in six months\ntwo years down the line.\n\n148\n00:09:17.802 --> 00:09:22.000\nIn six months two years down the line\nit becomes business as usual.\n\n149\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.426\nAnd so, we've got to get over what we\ncall, not just the emotional cycle\n\n150\n00:09:28.426 --> 00:09:33.582\nof change, but we've got to get over\nthe inflated peak of expectations.\n\n151\n00:09:33.582 --> 00:09:38.759\nWhich is about achieving that\nvalue balance, the balance between\n\n152\n00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:43.949\nvalue capture launched and\nvalue capture in ongoing operations.\n\n153\n00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:46.371\nLet me give you an example.\n\n154\n00:09:46.371 --> 00:09:51.146\nSo many years ago now,\nmy preferred cell phone provider\n\n155\n00:09:51.146 --> 00:09:55.320\ndecided to launch a bit\nof wearable technology.\n\n156\n00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.270\nI was desperate, desperate to have this\npiece of wearable technology because\n\n157\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.220\nit was going to change my life.\n\n158\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.994\nAnd so I decided, soon as it was launched,\nthat was it, I was there.\n\n159\n00:10:07.994 --> 00:10:12.029\nNow I wasn't the one that was queuing up,\nor lining up outside the store,\n\n160\n00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:12.820\nnot that day.\n\n161\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.368\nI mean I have done that\nin the past though,\n\n162\n00:10:14.368 --> 00:10:18.580\n[LAUGH] I admit this I was the one that\nwas waiting for it to arrive at home.\n\n163\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.468\nAnd when it arrived you see,\n\n164\n00:10:20.468 --> 00:10:24.409\nI had created what we call\nan inflated peak of expectation.\n\n165\n00:10:24.409 --> 00:10:27.481\nI had decided that this\nwearable piece of technology,\n\n166\n00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:31.218\nbecause I'd read up about it and\nI had decided that this was going to\n\n167\n00:10:31.218 --> 00:10:34.320\ndo everything for\nme It was going to read my text for me.\n\n168\n00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.859\nIt was going to tell me what direction\nto go in when I'm driving in the car.\n\n169\n00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:41.750\nIt was actually going to even make me\na cup of tea when I wake up every morning.\n\n170\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.919\nIt was gonna do everything for me.\n\n171\n00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:49.150\nThat was my inflated peak of expectation.\n\n172\n00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:57.289\nAnd then I got the product and\nI realized that I'm getting old.\n\n173\n00:10:57.289 --> 00:11:00.820\nAnd it didn't matter what this piece\nof wearable technology could do.\n\n174\n00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.825\nThe fact of the matter was,\nI couldn't see it.\n\n175\n00:11:02.825 --> 00:11:07.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it was great.\n\n176\n00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.870\nThe value capture alone\nwhen I got the product wow!\n\n177\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.450\nBoy did that drop!\n\n178\n00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.543\nAnd it wasn't because\nthe functionality was any\n\n179\n00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:18.965\ndifferent to what had been promised.\n\n180\n00:11:18.965 --> 00:11:21.905\nAnd it was down to the fact that,\nactually,\n\n181\n00:11:21.905 --> 00:11:26.911\nI had created what we call an inflated\npeak of expectation, and I had well,\n\n182\n00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:33.130\nI decided it was going to go everything\nincluding make tea for me and it didn't.\n\n183\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.740\nMoreover, [LAUGH] Unfortunately\nit didn't do a lot of the things\n\n184\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.130\nthat I needed it to do or that I wanted it\nto do because I simply couldn't see it.\n\n185\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.732\nSo my value capture at launch\nwas actually deflated.\n\n186\n00:11:45.732 --> 00:11:49.670\nHowever, now I've had this piece of\ntechnology for quite some time now, and\n\n187\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.527\nI've realised that,\nactually I can change settings.\n\n188\n00:11:52.527 --> 00:11:56.399\nAnd the fact that I can't see it\ndoesn't make any difference whatsoever,\n\n189\n00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.348\ncuz I can set it to buzz when\nI'm coming up to a junction and\n\n190\n00:11:59.348 --> 00:12:01.260\nI want it to change direction.\n\n191\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.930\nAnd I can set it so\nthat it opens my front door for\n\n192\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.030\nme when I get within a couple of\nhundred meters of the front door.\n\n193\n00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:12.650\nAnd so I've actually got it set in\na way that now I am after a year.\n\n194\n00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:17.020\nI am actually achieving\nthe true value of that product.\n\n195\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.584\nSo my value capture at launch\nwas actually quite diminished.\n\n196\n00:12:22.584 --> 00:12:26.745\nBut then you have the opposite\nthat sometimes happens as well,\n\n197\n00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:31.140\nin that we get a piece of new technology\nand we get a new software, or\n\n198\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.142\nwe get a new service launched,\nand we use it.\n\n199\n00:12:34.142 --> 00:12:37.546\nWe use, as we would say in England,\nwe use it in anger,\n\n200\n00:12:37.546 --> 00:12:39.770\nwe really use it in earnest, okay.\n\n201\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.724\nAnd we do absolutely everything\non this new piece of software,\n\n202\n00:12:44.724 --> 00:12:46.692\non this new technology.\n\n203\n00:12:46.692 --> 00:12:49.893\nBut then our use starts to\ndwindle off after a while.\n\n204\n00:12:49.893 --> 00:12:53.514\nHave you ever bought yourself a gadget for\nthe kitchen and you use it and it's great,\n\n205\n00:12:53.514 --> 00:12:54.940\nyou know when you first get it.\n\n206\n00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.228\nOne of these blenders or\nsomething like that, and\n\n207\n00:12:58.228 --> 00:13:01.135\nthen all of a sudden it\njust sits on the side.\n\n208\n00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:03.850\nYeah, it just sits on top of\nthe cabinets and never gets used.\n\n209\n00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.742\nThat's the balance that\nwe've got to get right.\n\n210\n00:13:07.742 --> 00:13:11.338\nAnd it's that same question that we\nask ourselves before we log onto\n\n211\n00:13:11.338 --> 00:13:13.118\nthe internet and buy something.\n\n212\n00:13:13.118 --> 00:13:15.570\nAm I really going to use this?\n\n213\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.319\nThis is what we've got\nto look at in strategy.\n\n214\n00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:21.502\nIs the business really going\nto use this going forward, and\n\n215\n00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:24.122\nthat's why we've gotta\nget the balance right.\n\n216\n00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:27.389\nIt's not just about immediate value, and\n\n217\n00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:32.932\nit's not just about well managed in\nthat inflated peak of expectation.\n\n218\n00:13:32.932 --> 00:13:37.775\nIt's actually about the ensuring that\nwe've got a balance of value that's\n\n219\n00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:41.170\nperceived through out\nthe life of a service.\n\n220\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.972\nNot just at the start, and\nnot just after six months either.\n\n221\n00:13:45.972 --> 00:13:49.737\nAll we've got to do is we've got\nto out-perform our competitors.\n\n222\n00:13:49.737 --> 00:13:54.513\nAnd our competitors are not our\norganization's competitors but\n\n223\n00:13:54.513 --> 00:13:55.913\nour competitors.\n\n224\n00:13:55.913 --> 00:14:00.790\nWho is it that's knocking on the door of\nmy CIO, offering to do my job for me?\n\n225\n00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.470\nI've got to outperform them,\nI've got to make sure that I am the best\n\n226\n00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:11.090\nthat I can be and\nthat my team are the best they can be.\n\n227\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.690\nAnd that the services we deliver to\nour organization are much better\n\n228\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:20.302\naligned than anybody else could\never deliver to our organization.\n\n229\n00:14:20.302 --> 00:14:26.600\nBecause if we're not delivering value\nthen there are competitors out there.\n\n230\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.247\nSo I'm gonna go back now\nto our previous episode and\n\n231\n00:14:31.247 --> 00:14:34.500\nI'm going to look at our four P's.\n\n232\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.238\nAnd there's a little icon there that says,\n\n233\n00:14:37.238 --> 00:14:42.275\nlet's talk about an organization that\nyou know that's done the four P's well.\n\n234\n00:14:42.275 --> 00:14:46.712\nI know of at least one organization\nin this big wide world that is\n\n235\n00:14:46.712 --> 00:14:50.829\nabsolutely very,\nvery good at understanding strategy.\n\n236\n00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:56.670\nHe's very good at understanding well,\ntheir customers, and their perspective and\n\n237\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:02.363\ntheir position, well we know that they're\nkind of number one in the world anyway.\n\n238\n00:15:02.363 --> 00:15:06.852\nAnd they're number one in the world\nbecause they understand their customers\n\n239\n00:15:06.852 --> 00:15:10.455\nand because they understand what\nit is their customers want.\n\n240\n00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:15.083\nAnd it's the fact that they want to stay\nat number one that drives their plans, and\n\n241\n00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:19.130\nthen their patterns for the future,\nand then, new product launches.\n\n242\n00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:25.018\nBut then, there are some organizations\nthat don't understand the outside world,\n\n243\n00:15:25.018 --> 00:15:28.035\nand don't understand what\nthe competition can do.\n\n244\n00:15:28.035 --> 00:15:31.010\nAnd they are the organizations,\nand I don't just mean businesses.\n\n245\n00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.015\nI mean IT service providers.\n\n246\n00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:37.320\nThey're the organizations that\nDon't manage their plans.\n\n247\n00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.769\nThey don't come up with the right plans\nfor the future and therefore they don't\n\n248\n00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:47.748\ndrive the right patterns of behaviors\nin order to achieves those plans.\n\n249\n00:15:47.748 --> 00:15:51.238\nBecause they don't have the right\nplans in the first place.\n\n250\n00:15:51.238 --> 00:15:54.706\nThey're not aligned with\nthe needs with the organization,\n\n251\n00:15:54.706 --> 00:15:56.747\nand that's not where we want to be.\n\n252\n00:15:56.747 --> 00:16:01.533\nSo a quick recap over\nour previous episode.\n\n253\n00:16:01.533 --> 00:16:02.782\nOur perspective?\n\n254\n00:16:02.782 --> 00:16:06.550\nWell, we broke that down.\n\n255\n00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:10.361\nIs our organization just running the\nbusiness, are they growing the business,\n\n256\n00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:12.275\nor are they transforming the business?\n\n257\n00:16:12.275 --> 00:16:14.980\nWe have got to support that.\n\n258\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.541\nWe've gotta be aligned to\nthe business strategy.\n\n259\n00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:21.978\nAnd I have seen organizations\nthat are failing because\n\n260\n00:16:21.978 --> 00:16:25.933\nthe organization themselves wants to grow,\nbut\n\n261\n00:16:25.933 --> 00:16:30.466\nIT are simply in the strategy\nof running the business and\n\n262\n00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:34.532\nthey're holding the business\nback physically.\n\n263\n00:16:34.532 --> 00:16:37.504\nIf you're hindering your organization,\nthen yeah,\n\n264\n00:16:37.504 --> 00:16:41.830\nyou've gotta understand that\nthere are competition out there.\n\n265\n00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:46.508\nAnd there are not many\norganizations that will tolerate\n\n266\n00:16:46.508 --> 00:16:49.602\nbeing held back for too long, okay?\n\n267\n00:16:49.602 --> 00:16:52.101\nSo we've gotta be aligned\nto their strategy.\n\n268\n00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:57.333\nThe danger also occurs in the opposite,\nwhen an organization wants to run but\n\n269\n00:16:57.333 --> 00:17:01.036\nthe IT service provider wants to grow and\nis looking for\n\n270\n00:17:01.036 --> 00:17:04.030\ninnovation is looking for new technology.\n\n271\n00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.427\nIf the organization is not ready for\nthat, you've got that misalignment.\n\n272\n00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:12.152\nWe're not meeting the needs\nof the organization.\n\n273\n00:17:12.152 --> 00:17:16.290\nAnd what about our position\nthen as a service provider?\n\n274\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:22.080\nWhat about our position in comparison\nto the organization, okay?\n\n275\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.455\nAre we variety based as a service\nprovider, are we needs based, or\n\n276\n00:17:26.455 --> 00:17:27.873\nare we access based?\n\n277\n00:17:27.873 --> 00:17:33.247\nVariety based means that we want to\nserve a wide group of customers,\n\n278\n00:17:33.247 --> 00:17:35.710\nso we specialize in one thing.\n\n279\n00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:41.425\nWhereas needs based, well we want to\nservice just a narrow group of customers,\n\n280\n00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:46.903\nbut we've got a wide service catalog,\nand we do everything that they need.\n\n281\n00:17:46.903 --> 00:17:51.940\nAn access based, well,\naccess based is really just focused\n\n282\n00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:58.483\non one particular location, okay, or\none particular size of organization.\n\n283\n00:17:58.483 --> 00:18:04.632\nSo are we a service provider that\nfocuses just in one particular location?\n\n284\n00:18:04.632 --> 00:18:08.360\nAnd again, you've gotta think about\nthe pros and cons of each of these.\n\n285\n00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.484\nA variety based service provider, well,\n\n286\n00:18:11.484 --> 00:18:17.052\nwe specialize in one particular thing,\nbut we'll sell that to everybody.\n\n287\n00:18:17.052 --> 00:18:21.773\nWe'll provide that service to everybody,\nwhich means that we're very, very good at\n\n288\n00:18:21.773 --> 00:18:26.184\nwhat we do, but it It does mean that we're\nnot necessarily great at innovation.\n\n289\n00:18:26.184 --> 00:18:30.582\nNow, a wide service catalog and needs\nbased organization means that we're kind\n\n290\n00:18:30.582 --> 00:18:32.983\nof a Jack of all trades or\nJill of all trades.\n\n291\n00:18:32.983 --> 00:18:37.630\nSo we know a bit about everything,\nbut we're providing that to just one\n\n292\n00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:42.124\nparticular organization and\nthat organization might actually find\n\n293\n00:18:42.124 --> 00:18:45.931\nsomebody who's a little bit\nmore specialist than we are.\n\n294\n00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:50.298\nAnd if we're access based, if we focus on\none customer characteristic, for instance,\n\n295\n00:18:50.298 --> 00:18:51.415\nlike their location.\n\n296\n00:18:51.415 --> 00:18:57.132\nAnd we tailor ourselves just to meet the\nneeds of that particular characteristic,\n\n297\n00:18:57.132 --> 00:19:01.473\nsay that location,\nthen are we missing other opportunities?\n\n298\n00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:04.077\nAnd are we limiting our customers and\n\n299\n00:19:04.077 --> 00:19:07.522\nthey're missing other\nopportunities as well?\n\n300\n00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:10.768\nSo what about our plans then within IT?\n\n301\n00:19:10.768 --> 00:19:15.641\nWell, our plan is all about moving\nfrom where we are right now to where\n\n302\n00:19:15.641 --> 00:19:16.901\nwe want to be, and\n\n303\n00:19:16.901 --> 00:19:22.471\nwe have to do that as well in complete\nalignment with our organization, okay?\n\n304\n00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:26.722\nAnd of course, the patterns, well the\npatterns are how we're going to get there.\n\n305\n00:19:26.722 --> 00:19:29.233\nHow are we are going to achieve our plans?\n\n306\n00:19:29.233 --> 00:19:31.952\nAnd our patterns,\nwe call them iterative activities.\n\n307\n00:19:31.952 --> 00:19:35.213\nThis is not just a one [INAUDIBLE]\nexercise, this is for everything.\n\n308\n00:19:35.213 --> 00:19:37.055\nThis is for all of our processes.\n\n309\n00:19:37.055 --> 00:19:38.821\nThis is for all of our services.\n\n310\n00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:46.580\nHow are they all going to\ncontribute to meet those plans?\n\n311\n00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.402\nHow are they all going to\ncontribute to our strategy, okay?\n\n312\n00:19:50.402 --> 00:19:55.147\nAll of these,\nall of these patterns that we compile,\n\n313\n00:19:55.147 --> 00:19:58.417\nthat we devise, that we construct,\n\n314\n00:19:58.417 --> 00:20:03.585\nhave to be designed to meet\nthe needs of the organization,\n\n315\n00:20:03.585 --> 00:20:07.393\nand therefore to meet our needs within IT.\n\n316\n00:20:07.393 --> 00:20:09.213\nSo let's just take a look\nat the service then.\n\n317\n00:20:09.213 --> 00:20:13.882\nAnd I've already said, okay a service is a\nmeans of delivering value to customers by\n\n318\n00:20:13.882 --> 00:20:18.443\nfacilitating their outcomes without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n319\n00:20:18.443 --> 00:20:22.235\nAnd so,\nas I mentioned in the last episode,\n\n320\n00:20:22.235 --> 00:20:25.521\nwe will not type that e-mail for you.\n\n321\n00:20:25.521 --> 00:20:27.574\nWe're not going to do that.\n\n322\n00:20:27.574 --> 00:20:30.389\nWe're not going to read\nthe e-mail that comes in.\n\n323\n00:20:30.389 --> 00:20:32.802\nWe're going to facilitate your outcome.\n\n324\n00:20:32.802 --> 00:20:37.267\nSo we're gonna give you everything\nthat you need in order for you,\n\n325\n00:20:37.267 --> 00:20:40.470\nthe business, to send and\nreceive an e-mail.\n\n326\n00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.553\nSo a service is the ability to send and\nreceive e-mail.\n\n327\n00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:46.194\nYou're still gonna have to sit down and\ntype that e-mail, okay?\n\n328\n00:20:46.194 --> 00:20:49.119\nYou are still going to have to\nread one when it comes in, but\n\n329\n00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:51.173\nwe're gonna facilitate that outcome.\n\n330\n00:20:51.173 --> 00:20:54.771\nWe're gonna give you the ability\nto send and receive e-mail.\n\n331\n00:20:54.771 --> 00:20:57.531\nSo, of course, managing services,\n\n332\n00:20:57.531 --> 00:21:02.030\nwell that's about managing all\nthe components of a service.\n\n333\n00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.343\nSo what do we need then in order\nto send and to receive e-mail?\n\n334\n00:21:06.343 --> 00:21:10.253\nNow I'm going to put Ronnie\ncompletely on the spot now.\n\n335\n00:21:10.253 --> 00:21:11.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n336\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:16.221\nSo Ronnie, what do you think that we need\nin order to send and receive e-mail?\n\n337\n00:21:16.221 --> 00:21:22.027\n&gt;&gt; To send and receive e-mail, we need, of\ncourse, a sender, and we need a receiver,\n\n338\n00:21:22.027 --> 00:21:26.883\nand then we need servers to be able\nto send and receive e-mails as well.\n\n339\n00:21:26.883 --> 00:21:27.831\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n340\n00:21:27.831 --> 00:21:33.822\nSo you've told me about people,\nand you've told me about hardware.\n\n341\n00:21:33.822 --> 00:21:37.260\nOkay, is that it?\n\n342\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.783\n&gt;&gt; Probably not.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\n\n343\n00:21:38.783 --> 00:21:41.522\nI like to put you on the spot here.\n\n344\n00:21:41.522 --> 00:21:42.292\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n345\n00:21:42.292 --> 00:21:43.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but I do this with everybody.\n\n346\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.875\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Because people will automatically think\n\n347\n00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:50.701\nof well, we need some software,\nwe need some hardware.\n\n348\n00:21:50.701 --> 00:21:53.157\nAnd we forget all the rest that we need\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n349\n00:21:53.157 --> 00:21:56.098\nthe first thing that will gotta think\nof is we need the infrastructure.\n\n350\n00:21:56.098 --> 00:21:59.962\nNow you mentioned service, but\nit's not just about the service.\n\n351\n00:21:59.962 --> 00:22:02.550\nIt's also about the infrastructure\nthat we have too.\n\n352\n00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:07.043\nAnd it's not necessarily just about the\nphysical connection or the WiFi as we've\n\n353\n00:22:07.043 --> 00:22:11.422\ngot now, but we have to have contracts\nin place as well with service providers.\n\n354\n00:22:11.422 --> 00:22:15.550\nWe're not sending and receiving an e-mail\nif we don't have a contract with\n\n355\n00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.904\na service provider and\nwe call that sort of documentation, so\n\n356\n00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:22.142\nevery service has got to have\nthe relevant documentation.\n\n357\n00:22:22.142 --> 00:22:25.542\nPeople have to have\nthe relevant training as well.\n\n358\n00:22:25.542 --> 00:22:28.651\nNow, we have to have the software and\nthe hardware, yes?\n\n359\n00:22:28.651 --> 00:22:31.915\nAnd then, we have to have something else,\nwhich is really,\n\n360\n00:22:31.915 --> 00:22:33.520\nreally important actually.\n\n361\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:39.834\nAnd this is the one that everybody\nforgets, and that is the environment.\n\n362\n00:22:39.834 --> 00:22:45.392\nI can only stand out in the car park or\nparking lot for\n\n363\n00:22:45.392 --> 00:22:49.786\nso long without access to electricity,\n\n364\n00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:54.051\nwithout access to somewhere to sit, or\n\n365\n00:22:54.051 --> 00:22:58.846\nwithout access to a desk\nto put my laptop on.\n\n366\n00:22:58.846 --> 00:23:02.079\nI can only do that for so\nlong before I lose the ability to send and\n\n367\n00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:05.129\nreceive e-mail because my battery\nis only gonna last for so\n\n368\n00:23:05.129 --> 00:23:05.873\nlong,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n369\n00:23:05.873 --> 00:23:07.518\n&gt;&gt; And my legs are gonna get tired, okay?\n\n370\n00:23:07.518 --> 00:23:09.304\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting old [LAUGH].\n\n371\n00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:12.512\nSo we forget about\nthe environmental aspect as well.\n\n372\n00:23:12.512 --> 00:23:17.252\nSo when we talk about a service as not\nbeing just an application, it's not.\n\n373\n00:23:17.252 --> 00:23:20.434\nA service is made up of every\nsingle what we call component.\n\n374\n00:23:20.434 --> 00:23:23.712\nWe're gonna go on to call them\nconfiguration items in a little while.\n\n375\n00:23:23.712 --> 00:23:27.250\nBut a service is made up of lots\nof individual components, and\n\n376\n00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:31.751\nwithout any of these components,\nwe simply can't send and receive e-mail.\n\n377\n00:23:31.751 --> 00:23:34.861\nWe can't facilitate that outcome.\n\n378\n00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:40.686\nSo what we have to understand is that\nwhen we are delivering a service and\n\n379\n00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:45.348\nwhen we are looking at providing\nvalue to our customers,\n\n380\n00:23:45.348 --> 00:23:50.397\nwe have to understand what\ncomponents make up that service and\n\n381\n00:23:50.397 --> 00:23:53.921\nhow they affect the value in that service.\n\n382\n00:23:53.921 --> 00:23:58.241\nYou see If I don't have electricity,\nyou might say well that's okay,\n\n383\n00:23:58.241 --> 00:24:01.440\nbecause you've got battery on that laptop.\n\n384\n00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.980\nBut the fact is, that if we don't\nhave electricity in our building,\n\n385\n00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.300\nthen I'm still not sending or\nreceiving email.\n\n386\n00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.670\nWhether I've got a battery or\n\n387\n00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.570\nnot because the network's gonna be\ndown if we've got no electricity.\n\n388\n00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n389\n00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:19.870\n&gt;&gt; So, every single component\nof every service is needed\n\n390\n00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.010\nin order to be able to send and\nreceive email.\n\n391\n00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.870\nAnd if take just one of those\ncomponents away then we can't send and\n\n392\n00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.960\nreceive emails.\n\n393\n00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.660\nSo it's not just about the service,\nit's about the software.\n\n394\n00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.260\nIt's not just about the hardware,\nit's also about the environment,\n\n395\n00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.210\nit's about the people.\n\n396\n00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:38.190\nPeople that are needed to send and\nreceive mail and to type it.\n\n397\n00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.760\nBut also the people that are needed to\nsupport it when something happen and\n\n398\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.320\nthe people that are needed to install it,\ntoo.\n\n399\n00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.460\nIt's about the infrastructure,\nhow everything hangs together.\n\n400\n00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.600\nAnd it's also about the documentation and\nthe contracts that we have in place.\n\n401\n00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.870\nSo, when we say that managing services\nis different from managing products,\n\n402\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.519\nthat's exactly what we mean.\n\n403\n00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:05.136\nSo we're not selling products, we are not\ndelivering products to our business.\n\n404\n00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:08.330\nWe're delivering a service\nin its entirety.\n\n405\n00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:13.100\nAnd what we have to do is\nmanage the entire service and\n\n406\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.990\nnot just manage the products.\n\n407\n00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.000\nSo, for this particular episode,\n\n408\n00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.460\nI'm going to leave it here because we've\nlooked at the concept of a service.\n\n409\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:29.085\nAnd we've also looked at the breakdown,\nokay, the components of a service.\n\n410\n00:25:29.085 --> 00:25:31.005\nThat's something that you're\ngoing to need to remember.\n\n411\n00:25:31.005 --> 00:25:37.385\nAnd it something that I want you to sort\nof review over this particular session.\n\n412\n00:25:37.385 --> 00:25:39.575\nBut also take a look in your notes.\n\n413\n00:25:39.575 --> 00:25:42.675\nAnd just remember, that as we move forward\n\n414\n00:25:42.675 --> 00:25:46.165\nthat we're going to talk about this\ncomponents of a service a lot.\n\n415\n00:25:46.165 --> 00:25:48.845\nSo, as a refresher,\nthe components of the service are.\n\n416\n00:25:48.845 --> 00:25:53.340\nSoftware, we need that, we need hardware,\nthat includes our servers, etc,\n\n417\n00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.070\nas well as our PCs.\n\n418\n00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.105\nWe need environment,\n\n419\n00:25:56.105 --> 00:26:00.530\nenvironmental components,\nlike power and a chair to sit on.\n\n420\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:07.220\nWe need people, we need infrastructure and\nwe need the relevant documentation.\n\n421\n00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.105\nAnd these components are gonna be\nsomething that we talk about in future\n\n422\n00:26:11.105 --> 00:26:13.382\nepisodes, as we move to value creation.\n\n423\n00:26:13.382 --> 00:26:17.673\nBecause we are going to look at what\neach of this components means and\n\n424\n00:26:17.673 --> 00:26:21.450\nalso what value perception really,\nreally means, okay?\n\n425\n00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:25.551\nSo for now, what I'd like you\nto do is just review this last\n\n426\n00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:30.010\nsession that we have had and\nwhen we move in to our next episode.\n\n427\n00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.682\nWe're gonna take a look\nat value creation and\n\n428\n00:26:32.682 --> 00:26:35.158\nwhat value really means to our customer.\n\n429\n00:26:35.158 --> 00:26:39.040\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well,\nthank you again for helping us out here.\n\n430\n00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.170\nAs we take a look at the start here, at\nsome of the different principles that we\n\n431\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.900\nneed to recognize specially\nin service strategy.\n\n432\n00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.080\nHere we've talked about a basic approach\nin what we need as well as some of those\n\n433\n00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.680\nopposing dynamics that we\nshould consider as well.\n\n434\n00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.890\nA brief review of course of\nthe different values, and\n\n435\n00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.310\nlastly, talking about\nthe ideas of service.\n\n436\n00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.530\nThese are all important parts of,\nof course, your service strategy.\n\n437\n00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.500\nWell that's a great place for\nus to end this episode, then.\n\n438\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.100\nSigning off for

          "description": "In this episode, Ronnie and Jo discuss value creation in service strategy.  Jo reminds us that value is perceived and that strategy is helping us to create the value that we want realized.  We do this by understanding that value changes over time, it is measured against our competitors and against the uniqueness that we provide as a service, says Jo.  She also reminds us that it’s not so much that spending helps us to create value as much as it is the customer’s perception on whether we fulfilled the customer’s expectation.",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.137\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:14.107\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:17.512\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:21.450\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n7\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.925\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\nand today we're diving into\n\n8\n00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:28.552\nwell a little bit more on service\nstrategy on value creation.\n\n9\n00:00:28.552 --> 00:00:32.456\nAnd here to help us out with this is\ngoing to be our ITIL duchess herself, Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:33.136\nJo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:34.441\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:36.335\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:40.097\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo we've already been\ntalking about service strategy principals\n\n14\n00:00:40.097 --> 00:00:40.955\nfor a little bit.\n\n15\n00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:44.116\nAnd this is kind of a subset\nof the the idea itself, but\n\n16\n00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:49.670\nwhen we talk about value creation here,\nwhat are we really going to be looking at?\n\n17\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Well we've got to start off with\nthe understanding that here in\n\n18\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.260\nIT service management.\n\n19\n00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.870\nAnd IT service provider,\nwe want to deliver value to our customers.\n\n20\n00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.320\nBut what does value really mean?\n\n21\n00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.940\nSo that's something that we have got to be\nable to articulate, as a service provider,\n\n22\n00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.430\nwe have got to understand what our\nindividual organization values.\n\n23\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.081\nIf we're an external service provider,\nso let's say that we are an outsourcer,\n\n24\n00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:23.862\nthen we might actually provide\nservices to more than one customer.\n\n25\n00:01:23.862 --> 00:01:27.751\nIn which case then we have to understand\nwhat value means to each one of those\n\n26\n00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:30.112\ncustomers because we\nhave to provide value.\n\n27\n00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:34.687\nAnd if we don't provide value as we looked\nat in the previous session then they're\n\n28\n00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:36.290\ngonna look somewhere else.\n\n29\n00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.750\nSo as a service provider we've gotta\nunderstand what our customers really\n\n30\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.490\ntruly value.\n\n31\n00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.480\nNow this is where we get into\nthe realms of perception\n\n32\n00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.580\nbecause you see value is perceived okay.\n\n33\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.070\nValue is actually defined as a mix of\nthe outcomes that have been achieved\n\n34\n00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.969\nas well as preferences and perceptions.\n\n35\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.867\nSo let me ask you some questions\nthen Ronnie okay because we've\n\n36\n00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:10.612\ngotta get to the bottom\nof how we perceive value.\n\n37\n00:02:10.612 --> 00:02:16.471\nSo I said that the value is a mixture of\nthe outcomes that we want to achieve or\n\n38\n00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:17.683\nthe outcomes.\n\n39\n00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:20.747\nAs a service provider we\nwanna facilitate outcomes,\n\n40\n00:02:20.747 --> 00:02:23.002\nremember the definition of a service.\n\n41\n00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:26.781\nFor those of you that don't, if it's been\nawhile since you watched the last episode.\n\n42\n00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:31.307\nA service is a means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating the outcomes that\n\n43\n00:02:31.307 --> 00:02:36.735\ncustomers want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n44\n00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:40.406\nWe're gonna get into the costs and\nrisks bit a little bit later, but\n\n45\n00:02:40.406 --> 00:02:43.581\nI just want you to think about\nfacilitating the outcomes.\n\n46\n00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:46.351\nSo let's look at a car okay?\n\n47\n00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.940\nA car,\nthe outcome that we want to facilitate.\n\n48\n00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.201\nWhen we buy a car,\nwe want to get from a to b.\n\n49\n00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:53.352\nAnd that's what we want, right?\n\n50\n00:02:53.352 --> 00:02:58.064\nWe want to be able to drive it hopefully,\nand we want to get from a to b.\n\n51\n00:02:58.064 --> 00:03:03.840\nSo that's the outcome, so Ronnie,\nlet me ask you a question.\n\n52\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.143\nIf you were to go out and buy a car,\nwhat would your preference be?\n\n53\n00:03:08.143 --> 00:03:13.601\n&gt;&gt; My preference in buying a car would be,\nbuying not a car per se as a sedan.\n\n54\n00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:17.523\nBut more of a truck, more than anything\nelse is probably what I would want.\n\n55\n00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:20.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay so that would be your preference.\n\n56\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.931\nWhy would you decide that\nthat's what you want?\n\n57\n00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.704\n&gt;&gt; Well, I like the idea of not\nonly getting from point a to b.\n\n58\n00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:30.469\nBut the ability to carry stuff in the bed\nof the truck when I need to without having\n\n59\n00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.902\nto actually worry about opening doors.\n\n60\n00:03:32.902 --> 00:03:37.833\n&gt;&gt; Right so we've established that\na truck is going to get you from a to b.\n\n61\n00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:41.039\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna meet your preferences.\n\n62\n00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.985\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n63\n00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:46.062\n&gt;&gt; Okay now if I were to go out and\nbuy a car.\n\n64\n00:03:46.062 --> 00:03:49.522\nNow I would actually want something,\nwell it depends on the police,\n\n65\n00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:53.359\nto be perfectly honest, so I hope there\nis no policemen actually watching.\n\n66\n00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.388\n[LAUGH] But if I was going to go out and\nbuy a car, I'd want something fast.\n\n67\n00:03:57.388 --> 00:03:59.964\nI mean I'm talking about a car,\nnot a motorcycle, but\n\n68\n00:03:59.964 --> 00:04:01.535\nI'd still want something fast.\n\n69\n00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:03.235\nI'd want something that would handle,\n\n70\n00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:05.387\nI'd want something that\ncould go around a corner.\n\n71\n00:04:05.387 --> 00:04:08.540\nAnd I'd want something that could get me\naway from any speeding tickets as well.\n\n72\n00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.433\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n73\n00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:11.911\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'd want, and\nthat would be my preference.\n\n74\n00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:13.671\nI don't have my preference, by the way.\n\n75\n00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:15.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we'll talk about this\n\n76\n00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:16.380\nin a little while.\n\n77\n00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.066\nSo that's my preference,\n\n78\n00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:24.452\nnow how much is a truck going to cost you,\ndo you think?\n\n79\n00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:25.803\n&gt;&gt; How much a truck is going to cost me?\n\n80\n00:04:25.803 --> 00:04:26.401\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:27.914\n&gt;&gt; Or how much I'm willing to spend?\n\n82\n00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:29.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, no, no,\nlet's not go into willing to spend.\n\n83\n00:04:29.677 --> 00:04:33.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How much do you\nthink a truck's gonna cost?\n\n84\n00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.141\n&gt;&gt; If it's a brand new truck, I'm assuming\nit's gonna be probably about $30,000.\n\n85\n00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:42.807\n&gt;&gt; Right okay so\nif then I were to say to you,\n\n86\n00:04:42.807 --> 00:04:50.331\nokay I will give you\n$20,000 to spend on a car.\n\n87\n00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:55.380\nBut I would like you to take this, an SUV.\n\n88\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n89\n00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.670\n&gt;&gt; Which is a 4 by 4 in English terms,\nso I'd like you to take this SUV.\n\n90\n00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.434\nWould you perceive value in that?\n\n91\n00:05:05.434 --> 00:05:06.743\n&gt;&gt; I would.\n\n92\n00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:09.390\n&gt;&gt; Even though it didn't\nmeet your preferences.\n\n93\n00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.682\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because it actually, one it\nactually helps me meet something that I\n\n94\n00:05:13.682 --> 00:05:16.879\ndidn't want to do which\nwas to spend $30,000.\n\n95\n00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right okay and\n\n96\n00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.041\nnow it's funny how easily swayed we\nare by money but were all the same.\n\n97\n00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:23.734\n&gt;&gt; You can believe it.\n[LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:27.549\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right every organization swayed by\n\n99\n00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:29.171\nmoney as well,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n100\n00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:31.792\n&gt;&gt; We make these sort of\ndecisions every day in our lives.\n\n101\n00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:36.263\nEvery time we go to a supermarket\nto buy food, we make decisions.\n\n102\n00:05:36.263 --> 00:05:40.032\nDo we buy the branded goods, or\ndo we buy the unbrand goods.\n\n103\n00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:44.842\nNow the unbrand goods are invariably\ncheaper, but there's an assumption there.\n\n104\n00:05:44.842 --> 00:05:47.874\nAnd whether that's right or wrong,\nI'm not the one to judge on this one.\n\n105\n00:05:47.874 --> 00:05:52.339\nBut there is an assumption now that the\nunbrand goods are going to taste different\n\n106\n00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.242\nand might be of a lower\nquality to the branded goods.\n\n107\n00:05:55.242 --> 00:05:56.523\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n108\n00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.770\n&gt;&gt; That's driven by cost, yeah?\n\n109\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.860\nAnd we make a decision based\non what we value, do we value\n\n110\n00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.430\nwhat's left in our wallet at the end of\nthat shopping trip or do we value taste?\n\n111\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.440\nWe make that decision, I mean sometimes\nit doesn't even come down to that.\n\n112\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.470\nBut nevertheless, we'll make that decision\nevery time we go into a supermarket.\n\n113\n00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.670\nSo we have to think that when\nwe are delivering a service,\n\n114\n00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.560\nwe have to understand not only\nwhat our customers prefer.\n\n115\n00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.128\nBut whether we can influence\nthat preference and\n\n116\n00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:39.584\nwhether we can still encourage them or\n\n117\n00:06:39.584 --> 00:06:44.122\nwhether we can still help\nthem to perceive value.\n\n118\n00:06:44.122 --> 00:06:47.489\nNow in the same way that I motivated\nyou with money [LAUGH] and\n\n119\n00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:51.491\nwe're all motivated with money when\nwe go shopping for food as well.\n\n120\n00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:54.512\nBut in the same way that I\ncan motivate you with money.\n\n121\n00:06:54.512 --> 00:07:02.063\nIf I understand what my business values,\nwhat's important to my business,\n\n122\n00:07:02.063 --> 00:07:07.419\nthen I may be able to deliver\nwhat's valuable to them.\n\n123\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.080\nSome organizations ethics are very,\nvery important.\n\n124\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.810\nSome organizations they might\nwant to be what we call green and\n\n125\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.430\nenvironmentally friendly.\n\n126\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.972\nSome organizations may want\nto be the world leaders and\n\n127\n00:07:20.972 --> 00:07:23.513\nthey may want to be seen as innovators.\n\n128\n00:07:23.513 --> 00:07:28.452\nSome organizations are bothered about\nbottom line and not bothered about money.\n\n129\n00:07:28.452 --> 00:07:33.224\nWe have to understand what drives\nour organization in order for\n\n130\n00:07:33.224 --> 00:07:35.573\nus to be able to deliver value.\n\n131\n00:07:35.573 --> 00:07:39.638\nBecause sometimes we can\noffer value by saying,\n\n132\n00:07:39.638 --> 00:07:43.812\nhey look we've got this software and\nit's free.\n\n133\n00:07:43.812 --> 00:07:48.597\nBut sometimes the value is in maybe\nthe quality of the service that\n\n134\n00:07:48.597 --> 00:07:49.992\nwe're offering.\n\n135\n00:07:49.992 --> 00:07:54.085\nAnd I know of a very,\nvery large organization, a very large,\n\n136\n00:07:54.085 --> 00:07:58.420\ninternational organization that\nwas using an email service, or\n\n137\n00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.678\nan email application\nthat was completely free.\n\n138\n00:08:01.678 --> 00:08:06.529\nAnd given to them completely free without\nAny form of licensing, and that's\n\n139\n00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:11.850\nwhat they use, because they perceived\nvalue in the bottom line, it was free.\n\n140\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.770\nAnd when they have hundreds of thousands,\nliterally around the world,\n\n141\n00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.240\nof employees that they would've had to pay\na license for with another application.\n\n142\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.087\nThen that's what they perceived to be\nvaluable, so why is that important to us?\n\n143\n00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:28.964\nWell, value is defined as the level at\nwhich the service meets the customer\n\n144\n00:08:28.964 --> 00:08:29.835\nexpectations.\n\n145\n00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:33.780\nSo it is about that balance\nbetween achieving the outcome, but\n\n146\n00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.210\nalso what their expectation is.\n\n147\n00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.222\nAnd as we already said,\nwe can bring money into this.\n\n148\n00:08:39.222 --> 00:08:42.550\nIt's quite often defined by\nhow much they want to pay.\n\n149\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.742\nSo value is about\nan affordable mix of features.\n\n150\n00:08:45.742 --> 00:08:51.750\nIt's about how much you're willing to pay,\nbut it still has to meet the objectives.\n\n151\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.583\nAnd when we talked about a car,\nI offered you an SUV,\n\n152\n00:08:55.583 --> 00:09:01.441\nbecause it still met the objectives, and\nthe objectives were to get from A to B.\n\n153\n00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.848\nNow, it wasn't what you wanted,\nit wasn't your preferences, but\n\n154\n00:09:04.848 --> 00:09:06.280\nit still got you from A to B.\n\n155\n00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.240\nNow, something else that\nI want to bring in here,\n\n156\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.715\nis the fact that value\nperception changes over time.\n\n157\n00:09:11.715 --> 00:09:17.048\nLet's stick with the car, I tend to use\nthe cellphone example in this instance,\n\n158\n00:09:17.048 --> 00:09:19.150\nbut let's stick with the car.\n\n159\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.789\nSo I've given you a brand new car,\nand it's great,\n\n160\n00:09:22.789 --> 00:09:25.570\nit's got all the latest toys in it.\n\n161\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.635\nI don't like to be stingy about this,\nso I'll give you all the latest toys.\n\n162\n00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:32.860\nIt didn't cost me a lot, but we won't\ngo there, you don't need to know that.\n\n163\n00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.834\nI've given you all these latest gadgets,\nand you can plug your phone in,\n\n164\n00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:40.566\nit will do everything for you,\napart from making you a cup of coffee.\n\n165\n00:09:40.566 --> 00:09:43.920\nBecause you don't want that\ndistraction when you're driving.\n\n166\n00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.569\nNow, let's go down the road ten years,\nyou have put,\n\n167\n00:09:50.569 --> 00:09:54.956\nI don't know, 300,000 miles on the car.\n\n168\n00:09:54.956 --> 00:09:59.970\nHe drives a lot, you've put 300,000\nmiles on the car, 10 years' time.\n\n169\n00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.062\nIt still does exactly what it's supposed\nto do, it still gets you from A to B.\n\n170\n00:10:06.062 --> 00:10:07.931\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n171\n00:10:07.931 --> 00:10:13.202\n&gt;&gt; Do you perceive as much\nvalue in that car then,\n\n172\n00:10:13.202 --> 00:10:17.750\nas you did when I first gave it to you?\n\n173\n00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.785\n&gt;&gt; You're asking the wrong\nperson about that [LAUGH].\n\n174\n00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.919\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know what\nyou're gonna say now.\n\n175\n00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:25.463\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I probably would,\nand the reason why is,\n\n176\n00:10:25.463 --> 00:10:30.171\nit still functions after ten years,\nand it’s been reliable.\n\n177\n00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.961\n&gt;&gt; And it’s been, I never said\nanything about it being reliable.\n\n178\n00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:35.860\n&gt;&gt; I know, so\nit wasn't reliable after ten years.\n\n179\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:36.387\n[CROSSTALK] Okay, well there you go.\n\n180\n00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:38.411\n&gt;&gt; I didn't say anything\nabout reliability.\n\n181\n00:10:38.411 --> 00:10:40.808\nWe have to assume, okay,\nthat after ten years,\n\n182\n00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:43.039\nthat reliability may\nwell have dropped off.\n\n183\n00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:45.776\nBut 300,000 miles, Ronnie, now, come on.\n\n184\n00:10:45.776 --> 00:10:47.474\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've done it.\n\n185\n00:10:47.474 --> 00:10:50.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I knew I'd\nasked the wrong question,\n\n186\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.017\nI knew this before I'd even gone there.\n\n187\n00:10:53.017 --> 00:10:58.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For the most part, most people-\n&gt;&gt; Would not, there's no doubt.\n\n188\n00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.383\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wouldn't perceive\nthe same amount of value.\n\n189\n00:11:01.383 --> 00:11:03.457\nLet me turn this into cell phones, then.\n\n190\n00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:08.239\nIf I gave you, ten years ago, let's say\nI gave you this brand-new cell phone\n\n191\n00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:11.045\nthat had come out that\nhad touch screen on it.\n\n192\n00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:15.080\nAnd it was all, it had all the latest\ntechnology, and it didn't just allow you\n\n193\n00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.845\nto make and receive a phone call,\nwhich was the outcome that it facilitated.\n\n194\n00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:22.159\nBut it allowed you to send texts and\nemails, etc, and\n\n195\n00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:24.880\nyou perceived value in that ten years ago.\n\n196\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.529\nNow if I gave you that same cell phone\nright now, would you perceive value in it?\n\n197\n00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:30.652\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n198\n00:11:30.652 --> 00:11:31.731\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n199\n00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:34.160\n&gt;&gt; More than likely,\nit's just because it's old technology, and\n\n200\n00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.823\nit probably wouldn't work with\nthe current things that are out there.\n\n201\n00:11:36.823 --> 00:11:39.372\n&gt;&gt; Right, because things have moved on.\n\n202\n00:11:39.372 --> 00:11:40.487\n&gt;&gt; Right, that changed.\n\n203\n00:11:40.487 --> 00:11:44.775\n&gt;&gt; Even though it will still achieve the\noutcome, it will still send or make and\n\n204\n00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:46.890\nreceive a phone call.\n\n205\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.575\nBut you don't perceive\nthe same amount of value.\n\n206\n00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:54.691\nFor the most part, with the exception\nof the car, but we'll ignore that.\n\n207\n00:11:54.691 --> 00:11:56.645\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For the most part,\n\n208\n00:11:56.645 --> 00:12:00.000\nvalue perception diminishes over time.\n\n209\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.180\nAnd that's something that we have\nto contend with in IT as well.\n\n210\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.130\nIn a previous session we looked at the\nbalance between looking to the future, and\n\n211\n00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.972\nmaintaining the status quo and\nstaying where we are.\n\n212\n00:12:10.972 --> 00:12:14.160\nBut that's something that we\nhave to contend with in IT.\n\n213\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.400\nAnd as I've said,\nwe're in the 21st century now, and\n\n214\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.450\nchange happens very rapidly in technology.\n\n215\n00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.700\nSo we have to make sure that not only\ndo we provide value right now, but\n\n216\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.948\nthat we provide value going\ninto the future as well.\n\n217\n00:12:26.948 --> 00:12:30.950\nSo when we're designing services,\nwhen we're coming up for ideas for\n\n218\n00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:35.960\nnew services, we have to do this,\nunderstanding that these are gonna change.\n\n219\n00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.050\nThere's going to be new functionality,\nand when we bring in a new application,\n\n220\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.360\nwe're going to have to\nbring in that application,\n\n221\n00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.930\nknowing that there's going to\nbe updates to the application.\n\n222\n00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:51.784\nSo in terms of value, we have to know\nwhat IT provides to the business,\n\n223\n00:12:51.784 --> 00:12:56.046\nwhat value do we provide, and\nwhat do they expect from us.\n\n224\n00:12:56.046 --> 00:13:01.614\nAnd did we actually achieve that value,\ndid we deliver the value to the business,\n\n225\n00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:06.069\nand then how do we carry on delivering\nthat value into the future?\n\n226\n00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:11.973\nSo as we've said,\nvalue is defined as the business outcomes\n\n227\n00:13:11.973 --> 00:13:18.395\nthat we want to achieve, and\npreferences and perception.\n\n228\n00:13:18.395 --> 00:13:22.595\nIt's a mixture of all the outcomes,\nand in terms of our organization,\n\n229\n00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:26.587\nthat could be financial outcomes,\nit could be market share, etc.\n\n230\n00:13:26.587 --> 00:13:31.489\nThe preferences, as we've already said,\nRonnie wanted a truck [LAUGH].\n\n231\n00:13:31.489 --> 00:13:36.440\nBut I gave him something for\nhalf the price cuz I said I'd pay for it.\n\n232\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.390\nSo, his perception was that\nvalue was still perceived.\n\n233\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.825\nNow, I'm gonna get into what we call\nthe economic value of a service.\n\n234\n00:13:48.976 --> 00:13:53.005\nAnd there's a little talking point on the\nleft hand side here, and I wanna go into\n\n235\n00:13:53.005 --> 00:13:56.460\nthis in a little while, but for now,\nlet's just take a look at this.\n\n236\n00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.540\nI'm gonna split this down, I'm gonna\nmake this into, let's just look at a PC.\n\n237\n00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.560\nBy the way,\nthere are no test questions around that\n\n238\n00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.260\nare going to ask you\nto fill in the blanks.\n\n239\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.460\nThey're not going to give you diagram and\nsay, fill in the blanks here.\n\n240\n00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:19.510\nWhat I want you to understand is exactly\nhow we calculate the value of a service.\n\n241\n00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:25.514\nSo let's take a PC, the reference\nvalue of a PC, this is this here.\n\n242\n00:14:25.514 --> 00:14:27.095\nIt says based on hearsay and\n\n243\n00:14:27.095 --> 00:14:32.041\nexperience, but the reference value is the\nvalue of that PC, how much we paid for it,\n\n244\n00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:36.650\nminus any depreciation, but\nwe'll get into that a little bit later.\n\n245\n00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.913\nSo how much did we pay for it,\nlet's say we paid $500 for that PC.\n\n246\n00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:43.951\nAnd so, because we bought this new PC,\n\n247\n00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:49.105\nthen the gains to the business,\nwell, it was given to a salesman,\n\n248\n00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:55.496\nand they managed to generate $2,000\nworth of sales from that PC over a year.\n\n249\n00:14:55.496 --> 00:15:00.850\nThat's great, however,\nit wasn't particularly reliable,\n\n250\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.970\nit didn't have a very good operating\nsystem on it, and therefore it was\n\n251\n00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:10.550\nunavailable for quite some time\nwhile we worked on incidents.\n\n252\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.530\nWhich means that the negative\ndifference there is $500.\n\n253\n00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:19.214\nSo actually, the net difference\nis the positive, which is 2000,\n\n254\n00:15:19.214 --> 00:15:24.922\nminus the negative, which is 500, and\nthat gives us a net difference of 1500.\n\n255\n00:15:24.922 --> 00:15:29.973\nWe add the reference value,\nthat 500, onto this, and\n\n256\n00:15:29.973 --> 00:15:35.350\nthat gives us the total\neconomic value of the service.\n\n257\n00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.718\nWhich is, as it says here, the customer's\nthe perceived value of the service, but\n\n258\n00:15:39.718 --> 00:15:42.749\nactually, what this really\nmeans is the economic value.\n\n259\n00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:50.093\nIn other words, the money,\nthis is what that particular PC is worth.\n\n260\n00:15:50.093 --> 00:15:55.033\nNow, we just looked at a PC, so now\nthink about this on a larger scale, and\n\n261\n00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:58.328\nthink about this in terms\nof a complete service.\n\n262\n00:15:58.328 --> 00:16:03.286\nAnd then we stop bringing all the factors\nin, and the reference value is not just\n\n263\n00:16:03.286 --> 00:16:08.244\nhow much we've paid for that particular\nservice, remember that the service is\n\n264\n00:16:08.244 --> 00:16:12.545\nmade up of software and of hardware,\nand of environmental aspects.\n\n265\n00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:16.417\nHow do we work out the reference\nvalue of a seat, and\n\n266\n00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:19.130\nhow do we work out the specific car?\n\n267\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.890\nSo, we're gonna get into the definition\nof a service in a minute.\n\n268\n00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:26.288\nHow do we work out the specific costs of\nthe electricity just to do that one PC by\n\n269\n00:16:26.288 --> 00:16:26.839\nthe way?\n\n270\n00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:31.407\nAnd it's also made up of the people\nthat actually provide the service, and\n\n271\n00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:35.540\nthe people that support the service,\nand the infrastructure, and\n\n272\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.550\nthe documentation as well.\n\n273\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.680\nSo, the reference value of that service\nis the value of all of those components\n\n274\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.910\ntogether, however,\n\n275\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.570\ndivided into what portion of those\ncomponents are just used for that service.\n\n276\n00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.410\nYeah.\n\n277\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.115\nSpecific costs, we definitely don't want\nto transfer them because to be honest,\n\n278\n00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:59.675\nit's gonna be difficult to work them out,\nand then we take this and as I said,\n\n279\n00:16:59.675 --> 00:17:01.545\nwe expand it to look at the service.\n\n280\n00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:04.255\nAnd then, we have a positive\ndifference for the service.\n\n281\n00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:08.840\nWe understand that the service is\ngoing to have some downtime, okay?\n\n282\n00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.900\nSo, there is going to be\nnegativity from service,\n\n283\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.050\ngoing to be an impact to the business.\n\n284\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.730\nAnd we take that net difference and\nadd it to the reference value, and\n\n285\n00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.010\nthat gives us the total\neconomic value of that service.\n\n286\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.969\nNow, that total economic\nvalue may diminish over time,\n\n287\n00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.570\nas the reference value diminishes.\n\n288\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.100\nEspecially, when we are talking\nabout hardware the reference value\n\n289\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.410\nwill diminish.\n\n290\n00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.430\nHowever, the positive difference,\n\n291\n00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.900\notherwise the gains from\nusing that service.\n\n292\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.940\nHopefully will increase over time.\n\n293\n00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:49.520\nBut then let's go back to the previous\nslide where we talked about the fact that\n\n294\n00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.940\ndiminishes over time as well.\n\n295\n00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:56.520\nSo there's going to be a gain in positive\ndifference some point in time but\n\n296\n00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.750\nthat's going to move down.\n\n297\n00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.730\nSo, this is how we work out\nthe economic value of a service.\n\n298\n00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.590\nNow, I have mentioned,\nin a number of occasions,\n\n299\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:12.750\nthat we are about providing\nvalue to our customers, and\n\n300\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:18.470\nthat we have to acknowledge that we have\ncompietiers and we have acknowledge this.\n\n301\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.680\nAnd sometimes as we said our USP,\nour unique selling point,\n\n302\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.900\nis very simply,\nit could be our experience.\n\n303\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.650\nIt's what we can bring\nto our organization, but\n\n304\n00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.680\nno other IT service provider can.\n\n305\n00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.770\nWe're not very good at selling\nourselves in IT, though, are we?\n\n306\n00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.580\nWe're not really great sales people.\n\n307\n00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.840\nWe need to adopt more of a marketing\nmindset because you see,\n\n308\n00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.900\nwe need to ensure that our business\nunderstands our true worth.\n\n309\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.120\nWe need to ensure that our business\nunderstands the value that we\n\n310\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.870\nbring to them.\n\n311\n00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:01.340\nBecause we offer a unique\nservice to our business,\n\n312\n00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.110\nsomething that nobody else can.\n\n313\n00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.780\nAnd we have to ensure that our\nbusiness understands that.\n\n314\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.370\nRemember, customers don't buy\njust a particular service.\n\n315\n00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.230\nThey want their needs fulfilled.\n\n316\n00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.120\nThey don't buy the ability to send and\nreceive email,\n\n317\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.540\nthey want us to facilitate that outcome.\n\n318\n00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.490\nThey want us to help,\nif I would just buy in a service,\n\n319\n00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.110\nit would just be a one off purchase and\nthen that would be it.\n\n320\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.780\nWhereas, no, they're just not just paying\nfor the service, they're paying for\n\n321\n00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.840\nsupport.\n\n322\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.990\nThey're paying for help.\n\n323\n00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.240\nThey're paying for advice.\n\n324\n00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.770\nThey're paying for guidance.\n\n325\n00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.689\nThey're paying for us to take ownership\nof the specific costs and risks.\n\n326\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.620\nIn a previous episode,\nI asked the question,\n\n327\n00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:53.710\nwhether you have ever selected a service\nprovider, based on their customer service.\n\n328\n00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.070\nAnd we all have, we know we all have.\n\n329\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.100\nAnd just because they deliver the outcome,\nor they facilitate our outcome,\n\n330\n00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.750\nthey allow us to watch TV for instance.\n\n331\n00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.630\nIf their customer service is poor,\n\n332\n00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:09.200\nthen we may choose not to use them\nbecause of that, so just remember this.\n\n333\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.900\nThat our customers don't\njust buy services.\n\n334\n00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.040\nThey actually buy the entire experience.\n\n335\n00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.430\nThey buy all of the what we\ncall the moments of truth.\n\n336\n00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:27.490\nNow, quite often customers and businesses\nwill see us as being a spender of money.\n\n337\n00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.920\nAnd it's true.\n\n338\n00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.340\nThey give us a budget.\n\n339\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.060\nAnd again, because we're not very\ngood at marketing ourselves, and\n\n340\n00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.400\nwe're not very good at selling us in IT.\n\n341\n00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.634\nAnd explain what we do within IT.\n\n342\n00:20:38.634 --> 00:20:41.650\nThen we're not really\ngood at articulating.\n\n343\n00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.940\nCalculating what we do with that money.\n\n344\n00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.980\nAnd how they realize value from us.\n\n345\n00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:51.019\nSo, let's take a look at this particular\ndiagram down at the bottom, and\n\n346\n00:20:51.019 --> 00:20:52.071\nyou will see that.\n\n347\n00:20:52.071 --> 00:20:57.001\nWhere the money is spent,\nwe spend money on our databases,\n\n348\n00:20:57.001 --> 00:21:02.830\non our applications, and on our servers,\nand on our networks, etc.\n\n349\n00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.970\nAnd I apologize for the diagrams,\n\n350\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.912\nI know that that PC looks as though\nit's about 30 years old there.\n\n351\n00:21:08.912 --> 00:21:11.210\n[LAUGH] That's a very, very old diagram,\n\n352\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.785\nstraight out of the ITIL\npublications there.\n\n353\n00:21:13.785 --> 00:21:15.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is our fault, okay?\n\n354\n00:21:15.505 --> 00:21:21.840\n[LAUGH] We spend money on these\npieces of equipment, as we would say.\n\n355\n00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.600\nBut where we actually add value\n\n356\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.970\nis in the relationships between\nall of these pieces of equipment.\n\n357\n00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.220\nIt's where it all hangs together.\n\n358\n00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.450\nWe can go out and buy a database.\n\n359\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:41.020\nBut that doesn't make, any difference\nwhat so ever to our valued creation.\n\n360\n00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.190\nBecause I can go out and\nbuy a cell phone, but\n\n361\n00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.904\nit I don't know how to use it then it's\nnot going to add any value to my life.\n\n362\n00:21:46.904 --> 00:21:50.180\nAnd this is exactly the same with IT.\n\n363\n00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:55.080\nWe spend money on these particular\npieces of hardware we've got there.\n\n364\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.634\nWe've also got salaries, et cetera.\n\n365\n00:21:57.634 --> 00:22:01.840\nAnd on, operational expenditure too.\n\n366\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:07.810\nBut you see, we're not very good at\narticulating our relationships and\n\n367\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.490\narticulating where value is\ndelivered to the customer,\n\n368\n00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.840\nthen they won't actually perceive value.\n\n369\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.410\nHave you ever asked yourself or\nhave you ever thought to yourself.\n\n370\n00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.020\nWhen you come in on a morning and\nyou open up your laptop.\n\n371\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.190\nAnd you look at it and\nyou go, hey, this is great.\n\n372\n00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:27.952\nEverything's working fine.\n\n373\n00:22:27.952 --> 00:22:29.494\nI'm so grateful for IT.\n\n374\n00:22:29.494 --> 00:22:30.920\nOf course haven't.\n\n375\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.840\n[LAUGH] None of us ever do that.\n\n376\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.480\nWe might open up our laptop and go, great.\n\n377\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.250\nI can't get into my email right now.\n\n378\n00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.550\nThat is more likely how we think.\n\n379\n00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.564\nYou see customers, users,\ndon't realize value.\n\n380\n00:22:44.564 --> 00:22:47.705\nThey realize when something\nhas gone wrong, but\n\n381\n00:22:47.705 --> 00:22:50.320\nthey themselves don't realize value.\n\n382\n00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.769\nSo, we got to get smarter at articulating\nwhere we have delivered value.\n\n383\n00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.900\nAnd we have to adopt more\nof a marketing mindset.\n\n384\n00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.830\nWe can add value at any point and\ntime throughout service delivery.\n\n385\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.640\nBut, we've got to be\nable to articulate that.\n\n386\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.430\nWe've got to be able to, as it says\nhere in the middle of that particular\n\n387\n00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:14.360\nslide on the screen there,\nwe've got to link our activities two,\n\n388\n00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:19.600\nwhere the business sees value,\ngoing back to a previous section,\n\n389\n00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:25.690\nand in a previous section I asked you\nwhether you knew what value your role and\n\n390\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.335\nwhat value you add to your organization.\n\n391\n00:23:29.335 --> 00:23:30.475\nAnd I'll go and\n\n392\n00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:36.375\nask an organization about individual value\nperception on whether individual people\n\n393\n00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:41.880\nwithin the organization understand\ntheir own value to the organization.\n\n394\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.440\nThen that's exactly what we've got here.\n\n395\n00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.814\nIt's that we've got to be able to\ndemonstrate that we are valued everywhere\n\n396\n00:23:47.814 --> 00:23:49.406\nand we've got to articulate that.\n\n397\n00:23:49.406 --> 00:23:54.033\nAnd we've got to adopt more than\nmarketing mindset as it said.\n\n398\n00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:58.048\nOtherwise we're just gonna be\nperceived as a Well it says,\n\n399\n00:23:58.048 --> 00:24:00.148\nmoney spend in organization.\n\n400\n00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:05.210\nBut is IT perceived as a cost center or\nis it perceived as a profit center?\n\n401\n00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.340\nAre we people that just spend money, or\n\n402\n00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.730\ndo we actually bring in\na profit to the organization?\n\n403\n00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:12.670\nAnd there's a question.\n\n404\n00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.370\nWe have to think about\nwho our customers are.\n\n405\n00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.460\nAnd this diagram here is actually\nreally simple diagram but\n\n406\n00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.270\nthis is where we spend our money down\nin this bottom section here in IT.\n\n407\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.988\nAnd we deliver services either\ndirectly to our external customers.\n\n408\n00:24:28.988 --> 00:24:33.500\nThink of our website for instance on\nthe right hand side of that diagram there.\n\n409\n00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.840\nOr we may deliver\nservices to our customers\n\n410\n00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.900\nlike our financial services\nour sales services.\n\n411\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:46.110\nBut our business customers then sale\ndirect to our external customers.\n\n412\n00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:51.770\nWe have to understand who we're\ndelivering our services to and\n\n413\n00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.760\nwhere value is realized.\n\n414\n00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.667\nYou see, value is realized straight\naway by sales made on our website by\n\n415\n00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:01.401\nour external customers.\n\n416\n00:25:01.401 --> 00:25:04.981\nWe can therefore, we can actually denote,\n\n417\n00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:09.252\nwe can articulate,\nthe return on that investment.\n\n418\n00:25:09.252 --> 00:25:13.881\nBut on services that we deliver\ninternally to our internal customer base,\n\n419\n00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:19.790\nour organization it's very difficult for\nus to calculate that return on investment.\n\n420\n00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.810\nBecause we've delivered you the ability\nto make a sale now you've got to go and\n\n421\n00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.360\nmake the sale.\n\n422\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.760\nIt's actually at that point\nwhere our business goes out and\n\n423\n00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.080\nmakes sales to our external customers.\n\n424\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.180\nThat's where the value is realized.\n\n425\n00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.689\nAnd that's more difficult for\n\n426\n00:25:34.689 --> 00:25:37.190\nus to articulate in terms\nof return on investment.\n\n427\n00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.100\nSo sometimes our services\naren't visible directly\n\n428\n00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.310\nto our external customers\nas in this last slide here.\n\n429\n00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.275\nSometimes our services are just\ndeliverable to out internal customers.\n\n430\n00:25:52.275 --> 00:25:56.395\nAnd sometimes those services that we\ndeliver to our internal customers,\n\n431\n00:25:56.395 --> 00:26:01.025\nwell, as I've already said, we don't\nopen up our laptop and think, hey look,\n\n432\n00:26:01.025 --> 00:26:05.285\nthis is a fantastic service,\nit's absolutely great, I love it.\n\n433\n00:26:05.285 --> 00:26:09.225\nWe open up our laptop on a morning and\nwe think, no, it's not working.\n\n434\n00:26:09.225 --> 00:26:13.905\nSo sometimes our business don't realize\nthe value that we actually deliver.\n\n435\n00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.468\nNow, I want to bring in service packages.\n\n436\n00:26:18.468 --> 00:26:22.245\nWe're going to explore service\npackaging a little bit later on.\n\n437\n00:26:22.245 --> 00:26:25.438\nBut a service package is an option for\n\n438\n00:26:25.438 --> 00:26:31.214\na service that we produce in and\nwe deliver in our service catalog.\n\n439\n00:26:31.214 --> 00:26:34.960\nSo right now I just want you to think\nabout when you actually go out and\n\n440\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.880\nyou select a TV service provider.\n\n441\n00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.055\nOr where you select a mobile phone or\n\n442\n00:26:39.055 --> 00:26:42.640\ncellphone service provider\nyou select a package.\n\n443\n00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.610\nAnd the amount that you pay is completely\ndependent on the size of the package\n\n444\n00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.750\nthat you want.\n\n445\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.950\nHow many channels do you want, or\nhow many free minutes do you want?\n\n446\n00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.530\nAnd you'll pay more perhaps to have\na quicker response time on the telephone,\n\n447\n00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:57.930\nfor instance.\n\n448\n00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.190\nThese are what we call\nservice packages and\n\n449\n00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.950\nwe'll be talking more\nabout service packages.\n\n450\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:09.330\nBut you'd see you all see value as\na customer in the package that you choose.\n\n451\n00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.790\nYou actually choose a package\nbased on your value perception.\n\n452\n00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.040\nSometimes you don't\nwanna spend your money,\n\n453\n00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.690\nsometimes you only wanna\nspend a little bit of money.\n\n454\n00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.620\nAnd you'll perceive value in that just as\nmuch as the person that spent all of their\n\n455\n00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.050\nmoney and got the latest, flashiest toy.\n\n456\n00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.060\nSo what we have to make sure is that\nwe are able to differentiate ourselves\n\n457\n00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:39.483\nfrom our competitors and\nthat we are able to articulate value.\n\n458\n00:27:39.483 --> 00:27:44.850\nOver time, not just value when\nwe first launch a service,\n\n459\n00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.990\nbut that we're able to\narticulate value over time.\n\n460\n00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.770\nNow, in this particular session we've\ntalked about value as being a mixture of\n\n461\n00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:58.450\nthe outcomes achieved plus\nthe perceptions and preferences as well.\n\n462\n00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:04.090\nNow, in our next session were going\nto look at what value really means.\n\n463\n00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.190\nAnd were going to look at breakdown\nof utility and warranty and\n\n464\n00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.520\nthe effects of utility and\nwarranty as well.\n\n465\n00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.715\nBut for now, this a perfect time for\n\n466\n00:28:12.715 --> 00:28:16.765\nus to just take a break from\nthis particular episode.\n\n467\n00:28:16.765 --> 00:28:21.775\nAnd I'd like you just to go back and\nreview your notes from your value\n\n468\n00:28:21.775 --> 00:28:26.623\nperception before we move into utility and\nwarranty and add and exception.\n\n469\n00:28:26.623 --> 00:28:31.075\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, thank you for\nhelping us in understanding that the idea\n\n470\n00:28:31.075 --> 00:28:35.170\nof value creation is something that's\nvery important in our service strategy.\n\n471\n00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.960\nWhen organizations don't release how\nvaluable our service is really gonna be\n\n472\n00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.620\nit really doesn't actually add anything\nbecause they perceive it differently.\n\n473\n00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.380\nSo we need to be able\nto create that value,\n\n474\n00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.500\nwe need to make sure that we can do so.\n\n475\n00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.820\nBy looking at some of the simple\nthings such as our competitors and\n\n476\n00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.640\nwhere they are.\n\n477\n00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.570\nAs well as the uniqueness\nthat we've offered and\n\n478\n00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:58.100\neven over time what our particular\nservice provides as well.\n\n479\n00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.810\nSo there are many things for\nus to consider,\n\n480\n00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.630\nand Jo has helped us to understand\nall those different things to.\n\n481\n00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:07.298\nAnd that's a great place for\nus to take a break at this point.\n\n482\n00:29:07.298 --> 00:29:11.295\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n483\n00:29:11.295 -->

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.570\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.270\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n8\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.050\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at utility and warranty.\n\n9\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.330\nAnd here to help us out of course is gonna\nbe our ITIL top dog herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.310\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.710\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo.\n\n13\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.990\nWe're taking a look of course at\ndifferent service strategy principles.\n\n14\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.375\nWe're now come to this part on utility and\nwarranty.\n\n15\n00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:46.730\nJo, they sound the same.\n\n16\n00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.140\nSo, help us out here.\n\n17\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.190\n&gt;&gt; Well we're going to continue\nour theme from our last episode,\n\n18\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.880\nwhere we started looking at warranty.\n\n19\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.510\nAnd we looked at warranty\nas being perceived.\n\n20\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.720\nBut now I want us to actually,\nso we looked at value.\n\n21\n00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.770\n&gt;&gt; Value.\n&gt;&gt; Value as being perceived.\n\n22\n00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.150\nAnd now I want to take value and\nI actually want to break it down and\n\n23\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.390\nlook at what value really means.\n\n24\n00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.040\nNow we know that value is perceived.\n\n25\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.040\nAnd in our last episode we took\na look at different cars and\n\n26\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.520\nwhat type of car we would want\nbased on our preferences.\n\n27\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.060\nAnd yet the fact that we could change\nour perception, in this case based on\n\n28\n00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.980\ncost and actual physical outlay to you.\n\n29\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.010\nBut that still doesn't mean that that car\ncan sacrifice on meeting the outcome.\n\n30\n00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.170\nWe have to be able to meet the outcome.\n\n31\n00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.070\nAnd, of course, the outcome for\nthe car was getting from A to B.\n\n32\n00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.280\nWell, utility and warranty really\ntakes a look at that outcome\n\n33\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.830\nin a little bit more depth as well as\nlooking at the whole concept of value.\n\n34\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.110\nBecause value is split into two,\nit's split into both utility and warranty.\n\n35\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.370\nAnd both must be present in order for\nvalue to be perceived.\n\n36\n00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.700\nSo what does that mean?\n\n37\n00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.800\nAnd I mean, these terms.\n\n38\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.340\nYou might think to yourself, you know,\nwarranties about the guarantee, isn't it?\n\n39\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.610\nIt's something that you get\nwhen you buy a brand new TV.\n\n40\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.000\nWell, no it's not.\n\n41\n00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.280\nThere is no guarantee, all right?\n\n42\n00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.680\nWe're in IT, okay,\nwe can't guarantee anything.\n\n43\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.750\nAnd that's the first thing\nthat we've gotta remember.\n\n44\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.040\nWe like to ensure and we like to assure,\nbut we certainly don't guarantee anything.\n\n45\n00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.740\nAnd the diagram that is shown on the\nbottom of the screen is one that you've\n\n46\n00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.850\nseen before.\n\n47\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.400\nThis is one that you saw in\nyour foundation material.\n\n48\n00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.770\nAnd it really just looks at\nthe fact that both utility and,\n\n49\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.520\nthere's an and here,\nright here utility and\n\n50\n00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.040\nwarranty have to be present in order for\nvalue to be perceived.\n\n51\n00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.530\nSo what do we mean by utility?\n\n52\n00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.440\nWell utility means fit for purpose And\nwarranty means fit for use.\n\n53\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.220\nOkay, is that any clearer to you?\n\n54\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.055\n&gt;&gt; Hm, a little bit more.\n\n55\n00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:00.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n56\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.770\n&gt;&gt; So what we mean by fit for purpose is,\ndoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n57\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.860\nDoes it do what it says on the can?\n\n58\n00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.310\nDoes it do what is says on the team?\n\n59\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.880\nAnd warranty means can I be\nassured of certain levels?\n\n60\n00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.735\nLet's expand this and\nI'm gonna to a comparison.\n\n61\n00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:25.545\nOkay,and if I take, let's say my\noutcome that I want to facilitate\n\n62\n00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:29.485\nis the ability to send and receive email\nand it's an outcome that I'll use as\n\n63\n00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:34.315\nan example throughout service strategy as\nwe go into all of our different episodes.\n\n64\n00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.800\nLet's say I want to send and\nreceive email.\n\n65\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.470\nWell the first thing I need to do is have\nthe ability to send and receive email.\n\n66\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.320\nSo I need to have performance supported\nand I need to have my constraints removed.\n\n67\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.430\nSo I need to be able to access it.\n\n68\n00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.430\nSo let's take a look at Gmail.\n\n69\n00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.980\nGmail, for instance,\nprovides us with the utility.\n\n70\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.730\nIt gives us that performance.\n\n71\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.500\nSo it supports the performance.\n\n72\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.020\nIt allows us to send and receive email.\n\n73\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.640\nAnd it does it in a way where\nmy constraints are removed.\n\n74\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640\nI have my password.\n\n75\n00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.000\nAnd I can log in, and\nmy constraints are removed.\n\n76\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.210\nNow do I perceive value in Gmail?\n\n77\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.792\nWell, you can say well it depends on\nwhat it is you're looking for and that's\n\n78\n00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:19.744\nexactly right, because as my free email\nservice, then yes I perceive value in it.\n\n79\n00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:25.188\nBut that's because I'm not expecting\ncertain levels of availability,\n\n80\n00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:28.701\ncapacity, security and service continuity,\n\n81\n00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:34.160\nwhich of course if you see they are the\nfour levels that we see in warranty.\n\n82\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.340\nSo the four levels that we see in\nwarranty are the availability, capacity,\n\n83\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.890\ncontinuity, and security.\n\n84\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.230\nNow you'll notice, if you remember from\nyour foundation that we have processes\n\n85\n00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.990\nthat look at each of those four elements.\n\n86\n00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.350\nGmail's not going to assure me\nof a level of availability.\n\n87\n00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.520\nSo if Gmail's not available\nwhen I log into my Gmail,\n\n88\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.870\nif the server happens to be unavailable,\nwell,\n\n89\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.760\nthen I don't perceive value in it anymore,\nbecause it's not there when I want it.\n\n90\n00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.550\nIf it doesn't have enough capacity,\nif I have tried to send an attachment and\n\n91\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.090\nthat attachment is too big,\nif it doesn't have enough capacity.\n\n92\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.070\nIf it doesn't allow me to store as many\nemails then am I going to perceive value?\n\n93\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.510\nWhat about continuity and\nwhat about things like security?\n\n94\n00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.750\nCan I be assured of a certain\nlevel of security on Gmail?\n\n95\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.620\nWell let's face it,\nI use my password and that's it.\n\n96\n00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.720\nThat's the level of security\nthat exists on there.\n\n97\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.460\nAnd sure we've got basic sort\nof spam filters etc, but\n\n98\n00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.280\nthat's the level of security that exists.\n\n99\n00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.050\nNow do I perceive value in that?\n\n100\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.080\nWell, from a personal perspective, yes I\n\n101\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.880\ndo because I understand the levels\nof warranty that I'm going to get.\n\n102\n00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.630\nSo even though the levels of warranty\naren't particularly high for\n\n103\n00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.060\ninstance, because then, you see,\n\n104\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.740\ndon't forget we've got this balance\nof outcomes versus perceptions versus\n\n105\n00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.590\nthe perspective here,\nthe perceived and the, my preferences.\n\n106\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.270\nWell, my preferences are in this\ninstance that because it's free I don't\n\n107\n00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.450\nreally need to have those\nincreased levels of warranty.\n\n108\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.570\nThe increased levels of availability and\ncapacity and security and continuity.\n\n109\n00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:33.330\nI understand that anything that I got on\nGmail, I could lose at any moment in time,\n\n110\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.080\nbecause I don't know what\nthat level of continuity is.\n\n111\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.050\nSo then, let's take a look at then\nwhat we do then with an organization\n\n112\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.450\nbecause this is on care on a personal\nlevel but with an organization,\n\n113\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.680\nGmail will still provide with\nthe warranty, but will an organization\n\n114\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.820\nperceive value in a free\nweb mail based service?\n\n115\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.590\nProbably not.\n\n116\n00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.690\nBecause we don't have the assured levels\nof availability, capacity, continuity, and\n\n117\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.380\nsecurity.\n\n118\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.940\nSo with an organization,\nan organization is more likely to look for\n\n119\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.840\nan email service that is either in house\nor is managed as a service in itself.\n\n120\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.130\nAnd so an organization will\nwant to pay for that service.\n\n121\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.850\nAnd they will pay to have\nincreased levels of warranty.\n\n122\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.060\nSo it's not just enough for\na service to do what it says on the team.\n\n123\n00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.510\nIt has to have an assured level\nof availability, continuity,\n\n124\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.650\ncapacity and security in order for\nus to perceive value.\n\n125\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.615\nWe don't perceive value\nwhere there is only utility.\n\n126\n00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:52.525\nAnd we certainly wouldn't perceive value\nif we had assured levels of security, but\n\n127\n00:07:52.525 --> 00:07:57.506\nit wasn't actually very reliable, in other\nwords, they weren't assured levels of\n\n128\n00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:02.277\navailability or if we had an assured level\nof continuity But it didn't actually do\n\n129\n00:08:02.277 --> 00:08:05.941\nwhat it was supposed to do and\nwhen we pressed Send on the email,\n\n130\n00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:09.570\nwe were never completely convinced\nthat it sent all the time.\n\n131\n00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.810\nSo, a service has to be both fit for\npurpose, it has to have utility and\n\n132\n00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.570\nit has to be fit for use,\nin order for us to perceive value.\n\n133\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.840\nSo let's look at this effect\nof improved warranty.\n\n134\n00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:30.000\nAnd really, what we're saying here is\nthat if we look at the green, okay?\n\n135\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.070\nThe green is where we don't have\nany assured levels of warranty.\n\n136\n00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.750\nIf we don't have an assured\nlevel of warranty then,\n\n137\n00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.420\nwell we don't have optimum performance.\n\n138\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.100\nWhat we want to do is we\nwant to reduce deviation.\n\n139\n00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.700\nSo we want to actually get a peek here.\n\n140\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.870\nWe want to have that warranty.\n\n141\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:58.510\nWe want to perform, most of the time,\nwithin the performance threshold.\n\n142\n00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.730\nAnd not outside of these\nperformance thresholds.\n\n143\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.600\nIf we don't have warranty,\nif we just focus purely on utility,\n\n144\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.580\nthen there's a deviation there.\n\n145\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:16.280\nWe cannot assure ourselves that we'll\nalways going to be able to perform.\n\n146\n00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.970\nDon't forget utility is about\nthe ability to send and receive email.\n\n147\n00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.150\nBut if we're not assured that it's\ngonna be available when we need it\n\n148\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:28.240\nthen performance then falls\noutside of the agreed threshold.\n\n149\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.400\nNow, these agreed thresholds are what\nwe find in our service level agreement.\n\n150\n00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.383\nSo, actually, where we want to be is,\nwe want to move from, sort of having\n\n151\n00:09:37.383 --> 00:09:43.070\nunassured levels, so having that\ndeviation we wanna move from that\n\n152\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:48.530\nto always having this peak,\nto always having this warranty effect.\n\n153\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.284\nSo we have to have no just the utility,\nbut\n\n154\n00:09:51.284 --> 00:09:54.053\nwe also have to have the warranty as well.\n\n155\n00:09:55.905 --> 00:09:59.450\nNow, we've gotta be able to communicate\nthis, and this can be a challenge.\n\n156\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.290\nI mean even just talking about\nthe different levels of utility and\n\n157\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.009\nwarranty right now is a challenge.\n\n158\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.250\nAnd quite often, when we first,\nas a service provider,\n\n159\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.870\ngo to a customer, an internal customer or\n\n160\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.630\nan external customer, the first\nthing that concerns them is cost.\n\n161\n00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.750\nThat's the first thing that concerns them.\n\n162\n00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:24.680\nAnd sometimes, and we all make these\ndecisions every day in our lives.\n\n163\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.060\nWe decide whether we don't\nwant to spend money.\n\n164\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.620\nAnd therefore, we're going to sacrifice,\nperhaps, on availability or\n\n165\n00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.190\nwe're going to sacrifice on reliability,\nwhich is all about availability.\n\n166\n00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.220\nSo we have to be able to\narticulate to our customers\n\n167\n00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.080\nexactly what levels of utility and\nwarranty we are able to provide.\n\n168\n00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.610\nBearing in mind, that value is about not\njust being able to deliver the outcome,\n\n169\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.450\nbut also on preferences and perception.\n\n170\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.880\nAnd so we have to be able to articulate\nexactly what levels of utility and\n\n171\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.210\nwarranty we can provide that\nwill meet their preferences.\n\n172\n00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.310\nAnd that may influence their perception.\n\n173\n00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:10.030\nRemember we talked about cost\nearlier on in a previous session?\n\n174\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.270\nWell, costs are really important and\nthere's an assumption there that if we\n\n175\n00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.190\nspend more money, then we can\nincrease the level of warranty.\n\n176\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.150\nWe can increase availability and\n\n177\n00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:24.520\nwe can increase an assured level of\nsecurity, and we can increase capacity.\n\n178\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.500\nBut it's not just about spending money,\nit's also about our technology and\n\n179\n00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.120\nit's about our experience as well.\n\n180\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.860\nNow, our technology and our experience\nwill help us with those warranty aspects.\n\n181\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.960\nThe service itself will\nprovide the utility,\n\n182\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.760\nthat outcome, the ability to send and\nreceive email.\n\n183\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.230\nBut it's our experience,\n\n184\n00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.810\nand it's the tools that we use that will\nhelp us to deliver the warranty elements.\n\n185\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:58.080\nAnd of course, if we look in the service\nprovider articulations on risk mitigation,\n\n186\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.400\nwell, we've got to understand\nwhat the impact is of not\n\n187\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.460\nachieving those warranty elements too.\n\n188\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.470\nAnd that enables us to\nperform risk management and\n\n189\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.770\nrisk mitigation, if necessary.\n\n190\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.935\nIn utility we go back to, and I just\nwanna go back to this particular slide.\n\n191\n00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:22.790\nIn utility it mentions performance\nsupported and constraints removed.\n\n192\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.620\nSo, not only have we gotta provide them\nwith the ability to send and receive\n\n193\n00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.720\nemail, but we've also got to remove any\nconstraints that might get in the way too.\n\n194\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.650\nRemoving those constraints means that\nour firewall must be in a position\n\n195\n00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:41.490\nwhere it allows an email to be sent and\nit it'll house us to receive an email.\n\n196\n00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.270\nWe have to be in a position where our\npasswords are secure, but not too secure.\n\n197\n00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.820\nYou know the old adage.\n\n198\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.670\nYou know, we get so\nsecure that we become insecure.\n\n199\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.810\nWhere we have a password policy that is so\nsecure that\n\n200\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.480\nwhat happens is everybody writes their\npassword down on a sticky note and\n\n201\n00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.520\nthen puts it somewhere on their screen,\ncuz they're not going to remember it.\n\n202\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.640\nSo we have to be able to remove any\nconstraints and deliver service.\n\n203\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.350\nThat's what utility is about.\n\n204\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.950\nSo, let's take a look then at\nthat removing constraints.\n\n205\n00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.370\nBecause, what we want to do is,\n\n206\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.390\non the left-hand side,\nit's about outcomes supported.\n\n207\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.140\nIt's about.\n\n208\n00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.840\nhere's some examples here.\n\n209\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.930\nField staff securely\naccessing applications,\n\n210\n00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.760\nor loan officers determining\nthe credit rating of applicants.\n\n211\n00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.365\nSo we want to offer that ability\nto perform that outcome but\n\n212\n00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:41.395\nwe want to remove constraints,\nwe want to decrease constraints.\n\n213\n00:13:41.395 --> 00:13:46.225\nConstraints that are mentioned here\nsuch as time, just the fact that our\n\n214\n00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:50.535\nnetwork might be slow, for instance,\nwe want to remove that constraint.\n\n215\n00:13:50.535 --> 00:13:52.925\nWe wanna remove\nthe constraint of failures.\n\n216\n00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.710\nSo we wanna deliver performance.\n\n217\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.360\nBut we want to remove constraints.\n\n218\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.250\nAnd of course availability is going\nto help us with that enormously.\n\n219\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.860\nSo our four elements of\nwarranty then are availability,\n\n220\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.830\ncapacity, continuity and security.\n\n221\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.940\nNow reliability is mentioned in there too.\n\n222\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:19.440\nAnd reliability actually forms\npart of availability management.\n\n223\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.430\nSo as we look at service design,\n\n224\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.700\nyou'll see that availability management\nis a process within service design.\n\n225\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.965\nAnd reliability, how often something\nfalls, how often something breaks or\n\n226\n00:14:31.965 --> 00:14:36.015\nfails, well,\nthat's part of availability management.\n\n227\n00:14:36.015 --> 00:14:40.430\nAvailability is about\nensuring that a service is\n\n228\n00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.960\navailable when the customer\nneeds that service.\n\n229\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.689\nYou see, if I go back to my\nfree web mail based service.\n\n230\n00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:56.376\nWhat level of assurance do I have,\nthat if I'm traveling and\n\n231\n00:14:56.376 --> 00:15:02.190\nI want to access my email at,\nsay 2 AM in the morning in India.\n\n232\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:07.550\nWhich is where I am right now,\nthen can I access that service?\n\n233\n00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.690\nWell, I have no assurance.\n\n234\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.890\nI mean I might be able to,\nbut I might not.\n\n235\n00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.380\nAnd what do I do if I can't?\n\n236\n00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.806\nAnd what about capacity?\n\n237\n00:15:18.806 --> 00:15:25.108\nHow much assurance do I have with that\nfree web mail based service on capacity?\n\n238\n00:15:25.108 --> 00:15:29.068\nHow much assurance do I have that\nI can receive all of my emails,\n\n239\n00:15:29.068 --> 00:15:32.120\nbecause my mailbox is big enough?\n\n240\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.040\nOr what about the attachments, how much\nassurance do I have that that attachment\n\n241\n00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.460\nthat I sent with my email\nis actually going to send?\n\n242\n00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.660\nCuz you know, we all do this right?\n\n243\n00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:48.460\nWe all send an email with an attachment\nand then we kind of close our laptops and\n\n244\n00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.290\nthen go on to something else.\n\n245\n00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.929\nAnd it's not until an hour or\n\n246\n00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:56.095\ntwo later when you open up your laptop\nthat you see that email come back and\n\n247\n00:15:56.095 --> 00:15:59.937\nit said, this didn't send because\nthe attachment was too big.\n\n248\n00:15:59.937 --> 00:16:05.456\nSo how much assurance do I have\nthat that's not going to happen?\n\n249\n00:16:05.456 --> 00:16:10.090\nWell, with my free web map based service,\nI don't have that assurance.\n\n250\n00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.680\nI don't have the assurance\non the reliability.\n\n251\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.950\nAnd I certainly don't have\nany assurance on continuity.\n\n252\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.249\nAnd that's because, yes,\nI still perceive value in this,\n\n253\n00:16:20.249 --> 00:16:23.046\nbecause this is the level\nof service that I agreed.\n\n254\n00:16:23.046 --> 00:16:26.137\nBut I need to have in my business email,\n\n255\n00:16:26.137 --> 00:16:29.804\nI need to have an assured\nlevel of continuity.\n\n256\n00:16:29.804 --> 00:16:35.681\nIf there is a disaster that\nmy data is still saved, okay?\n\n257\n00:16:35.681 --> 00:16:40.653\nAnd that I can support the business as\na service provider throughout any major\n\n258\n00:16:40.653 --> 00:16:41.640\nfailure.\n\n259\n00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.450\nThe data's not going to be lost.\n\n260\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.290\nYour business wants that assurance.\n\n261\n00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.650\nNow of course don't forget security.\n\n262\n00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.730\nSecurity, think about CIA, and\n\n263\n00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:58.640\nCIA is confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability of data.\n\n264\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.970\nSo we want our services to remain\nconfidential within the organization,\n\n265\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.670\nwe want to ensure\nthe integrity of the data.\n\n266\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.594\nAnd we also want assurance that that data\nis only gonna be available to those that\n\n267\n00:17:11.594 --> 00:17:14.360\nneed to have access to it and\nnot to anybody else as well.\n\n268\n00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:22.880\nSo again, do I have that assurance\nwith one particular web mail service?\n\n269\n00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.790\nOr do I have to use another service\nin order to get that assurance?\n\n270\n00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:34.104\nThe choice is up to you, and\nit really is down to the organization\n\n271\n00:17:34.104 --> 00:17:37.852\nto decide on what level\nof warranty they want.\n\n272\n00:17:37.852 --> 00:17:40.800\nBut we do need to have\na level of warranty.\n\n273\n00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.070\nRonnie, can I ask you a question?\n\n274\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.700\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So these levels of warranty that we're\n\n275\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.810\ntalking about,\nthey've gotta be agreed with the business.\n\n276\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So where do you think, then,\n\n277\n00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.259\nthat we might actually agree and\narticulate those levels?\n\n278\n00:17:54.259 --> 00:17:56.771\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say the service\nlevel agreement.\n\n279\n00:17:56.771 --> 00:17:58.523\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yep, spot on.\n\n280\n00:17:58.523 --> 00:18:00.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly,\n\n281\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.560\nas we move into service design\nwe're gonna talk more about\n\n282\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.580\nthe service level agreements,\nservice level management process.\n\n283\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.390\nAnd the service level agreement contains\nabsolutely everything that we agree with\n\n284\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.520\nour business.\n\n285\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.850\nAnd of course if we look at these\ncomponents to warranty of availability and\n\n286\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:22.850\ncapacity and security and continuity,\nwe're gonna have targets for all of these.\n\n287\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.140\nAnd these are gonna be contained\nwithin our service level agreement.\n\n288\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:30.970\nSo when I talk about different levels of\nutility and different levels of warranty.\n\n289\n00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.490\nWell, I expect to see those\nwarranty levels agreed in the SLA.\n\n290\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.080\nRight now,\nI perceive value in my free email service.\n\n291\n00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.270\nEven though it doesn't give me\nthe levels of warranty that\n\n292\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.880\nI may get from a paid email service,\nbut that's because it's free.\n\n293\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.961\nSo I still perceive value in it.\n\n294\n00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:55.517\nNow the levels of warranty that your\norganization require are gonna vary from\n\n295\n00:18:55.517 --> 00:18:57.760\norganization to organization.\n\n296\n00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.400\nSo we have to agree them and\nof course that has to be\n\n297\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.590\nin that service level agreement,\nthat's why we have the agreement.\n\n298\n00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:11.990\nSo designing the utility and\nwarranty for any given service\n\n299\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.870\nis something that we start off by\narticulating in service strategy.\n\n300\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.980\nWhen we first come up with the idea for\nthat new service,\n\n301\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.160\nthis is where we, working with\nbusiness relationship management,\n\n302\n00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.550\nunderstand the levels of utility and\nwarranty that are required.\n\n303\n00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.820\nBearing in mind that it's going to cost.\n\n304\n00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.940\nRemember I talked about email services.\n\n305\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.160\nAnd I said yeah, but\nthis is okay cuz it's free, okay?\n\n306\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.385\nIn previous sessions we've looked\nat cost and affordability, and\n\n307\n00:19:41.385 --> 00:19:45.980\nabout how perception changes\nbased on cost and affordability.\n\n308\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.610\nAnd that's exactly right.\n\n309\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.340\nAnd it's something that we accept\nthroughout our day-to-day lives.\n\n310\n00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.790\nAnd it’s something that we have to\nnegotiate with our organization.\n\n311\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.963\nSo the service that meets\nthe needs of the organization,\n\n312\n00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:02.884\nwell it's gonna be something\nthat they can afford.\n\n313\n00:20:02.884 --> 00:20:07.280\nBut we have to have that\nagreed level of utility and\n\n314\n00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.720\nwarranty in order for\nour customers to perceive value.\n\n315\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.740\nBecause overall as we\nsaid value is perceived.\n\n316\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.760\nSo now that we've looked at value and we\nspent two sessions looking at value now,\n\n317\n00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.290\nI want you to go over value perception.\n\n318\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.190\nI want you to take a look\nagain at utility and\n\n319\n00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:34.830\nwarranty and make sure that you've\ngot a complete understanding of both.\n\n320\n00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.698\nBecause in our next session, if I can\nput my teeth in [LAUGH] we're going\n\n321\n00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:43.674\nto look at what actually,\nphysically, creates value.\n\n322\n00:20:43.674 --> 00:20:46.782\nAnd we're going to look\nat our service assets.\n\n323\n00:20:46.782 --> 00:20:48.814\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you again for\n\n324\n00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:53.140\nthis idea of understanding the difference\nbetween utility and warranty.\n\n325\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.379\nAnd how they both combine to help us to\nmake sure that we communicate the value\n\n326\n00:20:57.379 --> 00:21:01.035\nthat we also need for, of course,\nour service strategy as well.\n\n327\n00:21:01.035 --> 00:21:03.970\nWell that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n328\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.780\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n329\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.770\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n330\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:13.309\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more of the\nITIL

For an organization to see IT as a strategic asset to the business, the IT service provider must help the customer remove constraints and increase performance through its outcomes, explains Jo.  Also, she tells us that competitive advantage to our assets is when we can combine our resources with different capabilities.",

00:00:12.501\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:15.779\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.790\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.670\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and today,\n\n7\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.850\nwe're taking a look at well,\nservice assets.\n\n8\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.170\nAnd here to help us, of course is going to\nbe our ITIL sultana herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.357\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:33.480\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for\nhaving me, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.840\n&gt;&gt; Jo, we've already been talking about\nutility and warranty and we've talked\n\n12\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.430\nabout, of course, value creation,\nspent a little bit of time there.\n\n13\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.030\nNow, we're moving into assets.\n\n14\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.300\nAnd you've talked about now actual\ncomponents that we might have\n\n15\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.328\nto actually think about the value to\nthose and what are we taking a look at?\n\n16\n00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:55.203\n&gt;&gt; Well so far in previous sessions, we've\nlooked at sort of the strategy itself and\n\n17\n00:00:55.203 --> 00:00:58.760\nwe've looked at why we want to have or\nwhy we need to have service strategy.\n\n18\n00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.690\nAnd then we've looked at value and\nvalue creation and value perception.\n\n19\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.405\nWell, now in this particular session here\nwe're going to look at what creates value,\n\n20\n00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:08.580\nokay?\n\n21\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.400\nSo we use our assets to create value,\nokay?\n\n22\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.630\nValue doesn't just suddenly happen.\n\n23\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.880\nIt's [LAUGH] not something that\nwe just wave a magic wand and\n\n24\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.620\nall of a sudden we've got services\non our laptops and on our desktops.\n\n25\n00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.910\nWe have to as a service provider\nactually physically create value.\n\n26\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.610\nAnd so\nwe use our service assets to create value.\n\n27\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.870\nSo let’s take a look then at our service\nassets and we've got them split into two.\n\n28\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.260\nAssets, or our service assets\nare either resources or capabilities.\n\n29\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.810\nAnd our resources are what we\ncall a tangible assets, and\n\n30\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.400\nour capabilities are intangible assets.\n\n31\n00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.430\nAnd it says in our capabilities there,\nwell,\n\n32\n00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.430\nthey´re something that we develop all the\ntime and it´s kind of enhanced experience.\n\n33\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.280\nThis is what our capabilities are, but\nour capabilities actually help us to use\n\n34\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.870\nour resources which\nare our tangible assets.\n\n35\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.030\nNow, there's a definition at\nthe bottom of that slide and\n\n36\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.170\nI just wanna expand on that\nbefore we move any further.\n\n37\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.554\nAnd that is that a business unit\nis a unit of the organization\n\n38\n00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:18.510\nthat performs a defined set\nof business activities.\n\n39\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.850\nNow, the head of a business unit\nis what we will term a customer.\n\n40\n00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.073\nAnd a customer is a stakeholder in IT.\n\n41\n00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:33.095\nA customer is somebody who has influence\nover whether the money is spent.\n\n42\n00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:36.965\nSo customer is somebody with a wallet,\nthat's a customer.\n\n43\n00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:41.645\nAnd so the customer will have influence\neither over the executive board or\n\n44\n00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:46.957\nwill have direct influence if we\nare charging then directly and\n\n45\n00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:51.907\nhave direct influence over how\nmuch money is given to IT.\n\n46\n00:02:51.907 --> 00:02:54.337\nSo how big our budget is.\n\n47\n00:02:54.337 --> 00:02:58.270\nSo our business units,\nwell they're our customers.\n\n48\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.430\nNow our customers can also\nbe our users as well,\n\n49\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.225\ncuz a user is defined as\nsomebody who uses a service.\n\n50\n00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:09.846\nWe'll look at the difference\nbetween customers and\n\n51\n00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:12.980\nusers, a little bit\nlater on in our session.\n\n52\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.828\nBut I just want to ask you a quick\nquestion, Ronnie, do you think that when\n\n53\n00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:21.520\nwe talk about customers and users,\nwe're talking about delivering value.\n\n54\n00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.120\nDo you think we want to\ndeliver value to customers or\n\n55\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.810\ndo you think we want to\ndeliver value to users?\n\n56\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.820\n&gt;&gt; I think we want to deliver\nour value to the customers.\n\n57\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.954\nThat's what I would think.\n\n58\n00:03:31.954 --> 00:03:33.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, no.\n\n59\n00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's not strictly true.\n\n60\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.600\nWe're gonna think about the users as well.\n\n61\n00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.970\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n62\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.190\n&gt;&gt; So you go out with your family.\n\n63\n00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.990\nAnd you take them for\na coffee in the coffee shop.\n\n64\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.351\nWho is it that's paying?\n\n65\n00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:48.430\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n66\n00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.560\n&gt;&gt; Probably [LAUGH] you, right?\n\n67\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.160\n[LAUGH] So you're the customer.\n\n68\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n69\n00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.900\ndo you think that coffee shop cares as to\nwhether your family actually like their\n\n70\n00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.460\ndrink or not?\n\n71\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.080\n&gt;&gt; No, they probably just\ncare that they got my money.\n\n72\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.011\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's not strictly\ntrue though because they do.\n\n73\n00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:09.280\nIf they didn't,\nthen the drinks could be awful.\n\n74\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.441\nAnd what would happen if\nIf the drinks were awful,\n\n75\n00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:15.080\nthe next time you decided you wanted to\ngo out for a drink where would you go?\n\n76\n00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.910\n&gt;&gt; Not there.\n\n77\n00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.440\n&gt;&gt; Not there.\n\n78\n00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.130\nRight.\nSomewhere else.\n\n79\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.840\nWhy?\nBecause everybody in the family would\n\n80\n00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.430\nsay to you well, we're not going back\nthere because the drinks were awful.\n\n81\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.220\nSo that coffee shop really needs\nto care whether the users,\n\n82\n00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.700\nthe people that are drinking the drinks,\nwhether they like them or not.\n\n83\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.450\nBecause if they don't care, well,\nthen you're not going to go back there.\n\n84\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.990\nAnd therefore you're not going\nto spend your money there.\n\n85\n00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.180\nSo it works exactly the same for us.\n\n86\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.650\nAs an IT service provider, we're not\njust catering towards our customers,\n\n87\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.350\nwe're also catering to our users as well.\n\n88\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.705\nBecause if our users are not happy with\nthe level of service that we provide and\n\n89\n00:04:55.705 --> 00:04:58.050\nwith the type of service that we provide,\n\n90\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.736\nthen boy are they gonna\nlet the customers know.\n\n91\n00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:04.130\nAnd then the customers aren't gonna\nwanna spend their money with us anymore.\n\n92\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.130\nOkay, so it's important that we keep\nboth customers and users happy.\n\n93\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.390\nSo service management is a set\nof specialized organizational\n\n94\n00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:22.809\ncapabilities for delivering value\nin the form of goods or services.\n\n95\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.120\nWhat that means is that us as a service\nprovider, we manage our services.\n\n96\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.010\nAnd our ability to deliver value\nis all about how organized and\n\n97\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.070\nhow capable we are.\n\n98\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.380\nService management is a set of\nspecialized organizational capabilities.\n\n99\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.280\nYeah, that's really, really important.\n\n100\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.220\nIt's about how capable and how organized\nwe are at delivering our services.\n\n101\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.800\nAnd we have to deliver our\nservices to both our customers and\n\n102\n00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.240\nour users, not just our customers.\n\n103\n00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.906\nSo we're not just concerned with whether\nthe customer is happy or not because\n\n104\n00:06:02.906 --> 00:06:08.520\ncustomers are also users, but customers\nare greatly influenced by our uses.\n\n105\n00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.520\nSo what do we use them to\ncreate those services?\n\n106\n00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.760\nWell, we use our service assets and these\nare our resources and our capabilities.\n\n107\n00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.415\nNow our resources are what we\ncall our tangible assets and\n\n108\n00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:24.820\nthey're down there on the right\nhand side of that diagram.\n\n109\n00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.882\nAnd our resources are the things\nthat we can touch and feel, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:28.882 --> 00:06:30.843\nLike money for instance, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:30.843 --> 00:06:35.593\nOur cabling, our wires,\nour applications that we pay for,\n\n112\n00:06:35.593 --> 00:06:37.960\nand we pay for our licencing.\n\n113\n00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.170\nEven our data,\nsomething that we can touch and feel.\n\n114\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.280\nNow you'll notice people go along both.\n\n115\n00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.890\nThey're both a resource and\nthe capability.\n\n116\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.246\nThat's because,\nin terms of bums on seats, well,\n\n117\n00:06:51.246 --> 00:06:54.390\na person is somebody that\nyou can touch and feel.\n\n118\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.240\nIt's someone who is tangibly there.\n\n119\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.401\nBe careful, you start touching and\nfeeling people too much and\n\n120\n00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:03.143\nwe end up in a whole completely\ndifferent course at that\n\n121\n00:07:03.143 --> 00:07:03.890\npoint in-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n122\n00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.180\n&gt;&gt; Time, right?\n\n123\n00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.330\nBut a person is somebody tangible.\n\n124\n00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.002\nBut people also going to\nthe realm of capabilities, and\n\n125\n00:07:13.002 --> 00:07:17.237\ncapabilities are what we\ncall our intangible assets.\n\n126\n00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:20.230\nIt's something that we can't touch and\nfeel.\n\n127\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.370\nAnd our intangible assets\nare things like our experience.\n\n128\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.110\nThat's an intangible asset.\n\n129\n00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.390\nOur knowledge,\nwhat we've got going on up in our heads.\n\n130\n00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.570\nHow well organized we are.\n\n131\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.260\nRemember service management is a set of\nspecialized organizational capabilities.\n\n132\n00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.990\nSo it's how well organized we are.\n\n133\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.635\nIf we are completely disorganized,\n\n134\n00:07:42.635 --> 00:07:47.170\nthen it is going to be difficult For\nus to deliver value, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.610\nAnd think about our management too.\n\n136\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.110\nOur management is an asset.\n\n137\n00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.060\nHave we ever not got on with a manager,\nokay?\n\n138\n00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.834\nAnd I'm sure that we've all been in a\nposition where at some point in time there\n\n139\n00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:03.530\nhave been interpersonal\nrelationships within teams.\n\n140\n00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.670\nWhether it's an interpersonal\nrelationship,\n\n141\n00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.770\nwell then you're not delivering value\nbecause you're not working 100%\n\n142\n00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.670\nefficiently or\neffectively for that matter.\n\n143\n00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.590\nSo we want to ensure that our management,\nwho our management are,\n\n144\n00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.000\nand how they lead us, well that they're\nan asset to our organization and\n\n145\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.900\nthat they're an asset to\nour service directory.\n\n146\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.683\nAnd of course the processes that we\ndefine, if those processes are well,\n\n147\n00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:36.840\nif they're inefficient, if they are not\ndefined in a way that allows for\n\n148\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.460\nan efficient movement through the process,\nan efficient achievement of the outcome,\n\n149\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.690\nwell then that's not really\nan asset to us, is it?\n\n150\n00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.520\nIt's more of a hindrance, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.333\nSo what our processes\nare is also an asset and\n\n152\n00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:55.740\npeople fall into both because\npeople have experience.\n\n153\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.240\nThe other thing that people have, and\nwe have to mention this, is attitude.\n\n154\n00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.870\nWhether that's reluctance to or\nresistance to change.\n\n155\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.690\nOr whether that is an attitude\nthat embraces change,\n\n156\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.340\nan attitude that looks to innovation or\nwhether it's an attitude that wants\n\n157\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.790\nto remain in the current position and\nmaintain the status quo?\n\n158\n00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:23.200\nHow people behave is\nan asset to our services.\n\n159\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.120\nAnd it helps us to deliver\nvalue to our customers.\n\n160\n00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.150\nSo, people fall into both counts, they're\nboth tangible assets in terms of bums on\n\n161\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.300\nthe seats, but they're also intangible in\nthe terms of the way that they work and\n\n162\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.680\nthe experience that they have.\n\n163\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.460\nWe may have a very, very similar, Ronnie,\n\n164\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.810\nqualification sect, but we both\nwon't work in exactly the same way.\n\n165\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.860\nWe both work differently and, therefore,\nwe both are perceived as being\n\n166\n00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.613\na different type of asset because\nwe both work differently, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:58.613 --> 00:10:03.710\nSo our resources then, as we've said,\nwell they're tangible.\n\n168\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.510\nIt's easy to get hold of them.\n\n169\n00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.180\nSo it's easy to see how they\nhave a direct influence on\n\n170\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.540\nvalue delivery on a service, because we\ncan see them, we can touch and feel them,\n\n171\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.660\nwe can see the cable, and I understand\nif that cable is not attached to my PC,\n\n172\n00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.510\nthen I'm not going to be able to send and\nreceive email.\n\n173\n00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.430\nBut it's very,\nvery difficult to see if that\n\n174\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.550\nperson that I call on the service\ndesk is not able to help me,\n\n175\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.350\nthen I'm not going to be able to send and\nreceive email.\n\n176\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.933\nIt's difficult to see that.\n\n177\n00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:39.409\nIt's difficult difficult to quantify that,\nand so we might have to go into\n\n178\n00:10:39.409 --> 00:10:43.319\nincident management and\nstart looking at individual reports and\n\n179\n00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:48.130\nindividual performance in order to be\nable to get to the bottom of that.\n\n180\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.730\nAnd so our capabilities, well,\nwe call them intangible for\n\n181\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.610\na reason because they are difficult for\nus to quantify.\n\n182\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.227\nSo our capabilities are an ability, okay?\n\n183\n00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:06.212\nAnd of course we can't produce\nany value without a combination\n\n184\n00:11:06.212 --> 00:11:09.610\nof both capabilities and resources.\n\n185\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.420\nIf I give you a piece of software,\n\n186\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.620\nthen unless I give you the ability\nto use that piece of software.\n\n187\n00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.270\nIn other words, I give you the training\nand the experience to use that piece of\n\n188\n00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.510\nsoftware, then it's not gonna\nbe of any value to you.\n\n189\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.470\nAnd it's the same within our IT people.\n\n190\n00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:31.390\nWe can give people at all, but it's\nstill not going to be of any use unless\n\n191\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.820\nwe give people the training\nto be able to use that tool.\n\n192\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.240\nSo we need both.\n\n193\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.430\nWe need both our capabilities and\n\n194\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.820\nour resources in order to\nbe able to deliver value.\n\n195\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.150\nSo, we've already looked\nat a business unit, and\n\n196\n00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:49.460\na business unit is a unit\nof an organization.\n\n197\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.360\nOkay, and that's what a business unit is.\n\n198\n00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.880\nAnd a business unit wants to\nachieve specific business outcomes.\n\n199\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.720\nWhether that business outcome may\nbe by way of increased sales or\n\n200\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.140\nwhether it may be a marketing team and\n\n201\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.800\nwhat they actually want to be able to\ndo is send and receive email, okay?\n\n202\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.930\nA business unit wants to\nachieve a specific outcome.\n\n203\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.560\nAnd what they will do is they will\nuse their assets, we see here,\n\n204\n00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:22.270\ntheir resources, and their capabilities in\norder to achieve that business outcome.\n\n205\n00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.940\nSo they use their assets and\ntheir capabilities,\n\n206\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.280\ncombined with our service in order\nto be able to achieve the outcome.\n\n207\n00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.370\nSo we facilitate the outcome.\n\n208\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.020\nAnd as I've said in previous episodes,\nwe'll give you the ability to send and\n\n209\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.640\nreceive email.\n\n210\n00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.370\nBut you have to sit down and\ntype that email.\n\n211\n00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.330\nYou're the one that has to press Send.\n\n212\n00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.480\nSo what we're going to do is, we're\ngoing to provide you with the service.\n\n213\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.450\nAnd we're also going to try and,\nI've lost my cursor, there it is.\n\n214\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:57.270\nWe're going to try and\nremove these constraints for you as well.\n\n215\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.876\nAny constraint such as speed or\n\n216\n00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:04.797\nperhaps maybe other constraints\nsuch as firewall, etc.\n\n217\n00:13:04.797 --> 00:13:08.350\nAny constraints that may exist,\nwe want to remove these.\n\n218\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.540\nSo I'm gonna build up this\ndiagram now on our next page.\n\n219\n00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.260\nAnd what you see here is this is us.\n\n220\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.601\nUp in the top left hand corner,\nthis is us as an IT service provider.\n\n221\n00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:23.980\nAnd we use our capabilities and\nour resources.\n\n222\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.370\nWe remove constraints.\n\n223\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:31.250\nWe understand that we have constraints too\nand we have to reduce those constraints.\n\n224\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.270\nAnd we provide a service.\n\n225\n00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.640\nWe provide an ability.\n\n226\n00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:40.690\nAnd that service must increase\ntheir performance, their ability\n\n227\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:46.490\nto use their assets, but it must decrease,\nit must remove their constraints.\n\n228\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:50.260\nWe provide that service and\nour customers, our business units,\n\n229\n00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.410\nuse their assets to generate\nthe business outcome.\n\n230\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.170\nOkay, so now that makes sense,\nnow that we've built it up.\n\n231\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:03.640\nSo the service that we provide,\nwe provide an increase in performance,\n\n232\n00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.780\nand we remove constraints that allows\nour users and our customers to use\n\n233\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:14.149\ntheir resources and capabilities to\nactually achieve that business outcome.\n\n234\n00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.340\nNow when we talk about constraints, we\nlook at things like funding or capacity or\n\n235\n00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.620\nmaybe speed.\n\n236\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.000\nWhich I guess part of capacity\nis performance management.\n\n237\n00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.410\nBut we have all the constraints too.\n\n238\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.645\nWe have all the constraints such\nas the way that we're managed.\n\n239\n00:14:30.645 --> 00:14:33.245\nRemember our capabilities,\nwe see them as an asset.\n\n240\n00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:36.405\nOur capabilities could also\nbe a hindrance as well.\n\n241\n00:14:36.405 --> 00:14:39.175\nIf we're disorganized then\nthat's a constraint, and\n\n242\n00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:41.970\nwe have to remove that constraint.\n\n243\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.940\nSo, as I've already said that\nservice management is about the way\n\n244\n00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.450\nthat we are organized.\n\n245\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.370\nService management is a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities for\n\n246\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.020\nproviding value to customers in\nthe form of goods or services.\n\n247\n00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.910\nIn other words, we provide value by\nthe utilization of our resources and\n\n248\n00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.610\ntheir capabilities and\nby how organized we are.\n\n249\n00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.470\nThis particular diagram,\n\n250\n00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:10.460\nhere, actually looks quite complicated,\nbut believe me it is not, okay?\n\n251\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.710\nWhat I want to start off with\nis on the right hand side, and\n\n252\n00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.700\non that right hand us you'll see us.\n\n253\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.820\nThis is us as a service provider.\n\n254\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.380\nAnd we have our service assets,\nthat's our capabilities and our resources.\n\n255\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.900\nAnd we use these capabilities and\nresources to deliver a service.\n\n256\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:34.410\nSee here we go, we increase service\npotential, and we reduce idle capacity.\n\n257\n00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:38.350\nSo we want to remove redundant or\nspare capacity, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.580\nBut it's gonna cost,\nokay, and we accept that.\n\n259\n00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.155\nWe are going to absorb costs.\n\n260\n00:15:44.155 --> 00:15:45.840\nWe gonna spend money, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.670\nSo we create this service, but\nthis service facilitates an outcome.\n\n262\n00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:56.610\nSo we deliver an ability to the customers\nand the customers, well they use their\n\n263\n00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:02.650\ncapabilities and resources to generate\nan outcome, to achieve an outcome.\n\n264\n00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:07.620\nAnd so they will feed back to us demand,\nthey give us demand.\n\n265\n00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.928\nAnd what we´ll do here is, and I really,\nreally wish at this point in time, when\n\n266\n00:16:12.928 --> 00:16:17.047\nthey´d created this diagram, that this\narrow was actually pointed in the other\n\n267\n00:16:17.047 --> 00:16:21.310\ndirection where the positive, because we\nwant to remove risk from the customers.\n\n268\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.670\nSo we take ownership of specific costs and\nrisks.\n\n269\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.000\nSo the risks and\nthe cost both come back to IT.\n\n270\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.540\nWe're not gonna transfer\nspecific costs and risks.\n\n271\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.260\nAnd let's go back to this coffee shop for\ninstance.\n\n272\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.190\nWhen you're in a coffee\nshop with your family,\n\n273\n00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.310\nRonnie, do you care about\ngetting an itemized bill or\n\n274\n00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:45.380\nan itemized receipt when you go to pay to\nsee how much each individual drink costs?\n\n275\n00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.380\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n276\n00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.575\n&gt;&gt; You're not really interested in that.\n\n277\n00:16:47.575 --> 00:16:50.979\nWhat you just wanna do is just pay\nwhatever it is that's on the bill,\n\n278\n00:16:50.979 --> 00:16:52.250\nthe bottom line, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.100\nAnd that's exactly what we should\nbe doing as a service provider.\n\n280\n00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.600\nWe don't need to be\ncharging individual costs,\n\n281\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.640\ncuz, well, sometimes it actually\n[LAUGH] well, costs us more\n\n282\n00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.210\nto work that out than what it does,\nwhat we're going to get back in return.\n\n283\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.970\nEspecially when you consider that\nsometimes you've gotta add tax in,\n\n284\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.180\nyou've gotta add a service charge in,\n\n285\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.447\nyou've gotta add all sorts\nof other fees in there.\n\n286\n00:17:18.447 --> 00:17:22.178\nAre we gonna transfer them to\nthe customer, their not interested, okay?\n\n287\n00:17:22.178 --> 00:17:26.930\nThey're not interested it doesn't matter\nif it's gonna cost us more money to\n\n288\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.280\nwork it out tha n we're actually going to\nrecoup back from the customer then no.\n\n289\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:38.440\nWe might choose to transfer a nominal fee,\na nominal charge to the customer, okay?\n\n290\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.921\nSo we take ownership of specific costs and\nrisks.\n\n291\n00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:47.240\nWe deliver performance, we deliver\nan ability to send and receive email.\n\n292\n00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.700\nBut they have to type the email and\npress Send.\n\n293\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.770\nAnd we remove any constraints.\n\n294\n00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:01.700\nSo us, an IT service provider,\nwe are a strategic asset.\n\n295\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.946\nWe are an asset to the strategy\nof the organization.\n\n296\n00:18:07.946 --> 00:18:12.370\nWe're not just a function,\nwe're not just a hindrance,\n\n297\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.890\n[LAUGH] as some organization\nsee us as well.\n\n298\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:22.730\nWe're not just a pain, we're actually\nthere as an asset to the organization.\n\n299\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.890\nAnd I had mentioned in a previous section\nthat we're not very good at adopting\n\n300\n00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:27.920\na marketing mindset.\n\n301\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.360\nAnd we're not very good\nat selling ourselves.\n\n302\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.320\nAnd so a lot of the perception\nof IT as a service provider\n\n303\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.792\nis actually down to the fact that we're\nnot very good at selling ourselves.\n\n304\n00:18:37.792 --> 00:18:42.520\nWe are an asset to the strategy\nof the organization.\n\n305\n00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.080\nBut we have to get\na little bit smarter and\n\n306\n00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.680\nactually being able to sell\nourselves to the organization for\n\n307\n00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.530\nthem to perceive value in us because\nthat's what we're trying to deliver.\n\n308\n00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.760\nWe want to deliver value\nto our organization and\n\n309\n00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.388\nbe aligned to their strategies.\n\n310\n00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:02.000\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo,\nwell thank you once again for\n\n311\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.650\nhelping us to take a look at this idea\nof our different assets that we have.\n\n312\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:10.840\nRemember that she broke this down into\nresources as well as capabilities.\n\n313\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.000\nShowing us the value of both together for\nour organization and\n\n314\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.560\nof course us as a service too.\n\n315\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.700\nWell this is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n316\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.450\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n317\n00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.480\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n318\n00:19:25.480 -->

00:00:12.454\n&gt;&gt; You are watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:15.747\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:19.820\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.910\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n7\n00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.290\ntoday we're actually going to get\nstarted into service provisioning.\n\n8\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.920\nHere to help us once again is\ngonna be well our ITIL queen.\n\n9\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.670\nI'll call her ITIL queen today.\n\n10\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.440\nJo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.060\nJo, welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.400\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie, I'll take that.\n\n13\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.290\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n14\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.630\nNow, Jo, here we are.\n\n15\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.850\nWe're into the realm of\nservice provisioning.\n\n16\n00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.520\nWe've just talked a little bit\nmore about the idea of utility,\n\n17\n00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.060\nand warranty, and value creation.\n\n18\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.020\nSo now, we're heading in provisioning,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n19\n00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what were gonna look\nright now is the fact that, well,\n\n20\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.170\nwe're a service provider.\n\n21\n00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.850\nWe provide a service to our organization.\n\n22\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.310\nAnd we're gonna look at what\nthat service really means.\n\n23\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.380\nWe talked about what value means in\nprevious episodes we've looked at value\n\n24\n00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.130\nbeing perceived, and we've looked at\nvalue as being made of utility, and\n\n25\n00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.340\nwarranty as you said.\n\n26\n00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.720\nSo, we've looked at what we've provide and\nnow we're going to look at how we actually\n\n27\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.560\nwork out, what we're going to provide\nbecause we are service strategy, and\n\n28\n00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.510\nservice strategy is where we come up\nwith the ideas for our new services, and\n\n29\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.120\nalso where we come up\nwith our policies and\n\n30\n00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.730\nprocedures for government RIT services,\nso how we manage these services.\n\n31\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.200\nSo we have to understand, when we\nare providing a service, we have to\n\n32\n00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.250\nunderstand, what type of service we've\nprovided, what our current capabilities\n\n33\n00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.100\nare, remember they're one of our service\nassets and what our capabilities are,\n\n34\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.650\nwhat do we actually physically capable\nof providing by way of a service.\n\n35\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.880\nBecause let's face it, we can't\nprovide a service to our organization\n\n36\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.110\nif we don't have the necessary skills or\nthe tools to be able to do that, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.050\nSo, that's what we're going to take a look\nat right now, in a little bit more depth,\n\n38\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.990\nis actually how we work out what it\nis that our business needs from us.\n\n39\n00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.470\n&gt;&gt; All right now Jo,\nwhen I start thinking about this,\n\n40\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.590\nto me it sounds relatively\nsimple I have a service.\n\n41\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.910\nI just need to provide it.\n\n42\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.090\nWhat type of strategy do\nI really need here Joe?\n\n43\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, how do you know what\ntype of service that you have?\n\n44\n00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.600\nFor start, you say you have a service.\n\n45\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.910\nYou need to provide it.\n\n46\n00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.410\nWell, who's asked the organization\nwhat type of service they want?\n\n47\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.349\nAnd let's think about\nthe complexity of all of this.\n\n48\n00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.210\nWe're fairly technical people,\nwell, I like to think that-\n\n49\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.990\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n50\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.600\n&gt;&gt; We're fairly technical people.\n\n51\n00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.620\nSo, if you hand us a new piece of kit,\na new piece of equipment there,\n\n52\n00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.870\nwe're probably gonna figure it out for\nourselves, right?\n\n53\n00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You know I'm\n\n54\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.765\nthe last one to read a manual.\n\n55\n00:02:48.765 --> 00:02:49.900\nMm-hm.\n\n56\n00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.590\n&gt;&gt; But not everybody's like us.\n\n57\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n58\n00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.290\n&gt;&gt; And so, we have to understand\nthe capabilities of our organization, and\n\n59\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.760\nunderstand exactly what type\nof service we're providing.\n\n60\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.150\nAre we providing a service where we\nsimply just hand over some hardware, and\n\n61\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.570\nthey're gonna figure it out for\nthemselves?\n\n62\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.070\nWell, we might do that but\n\n63\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.790\nthen what kind of a nightmare does\nthat leave us then to support.\n\n64\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.390\nBecause if everybody configures their own\ndevices, then that means that we have got\n\n65\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.770\na huge big desperate range of\nconfigurations that we need to support.\n\n66\n00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.350\nSo, that makes support\nmore of a challenge.\n\n67\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.700\nBut, what if provide a service that\nis very much just a simply plug and\n\n68\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.420\nplay service, where we'll configure\neverything at the back end, and\n\n69\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.550\nit makes very easy to support.\n\n70\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.430\nBut, what about the flexibility\nthen that it gives the end user?\n\n71\n00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.360\nIt doesn't give the or anything.\n\n72\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.840\nSo, we have to work out what it\nis that a business wants from us.\n\n73\n00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.110\nAnd it's not just a case\nof a nice shining new toy,\n\n74\n00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.250\nit's how that nice shining\nnew toy is going to work.\n\n75\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.580\nCertain environments\nare constricted by say security for\n\n76\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.930\ninstance, constricted by the line of\nbusiness that that organization is in.\n\n77\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.400\nAnd therefore that will influence the type\nof services that we have to provide.\n\n78\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.150\nWe think about security restrictions, and\n\n79\n00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.040\nwe think about requirements of passwords,\nect.\n\n80\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.768\nBut we also have to think about things\nlike the hardware and the software and\n\n81\n00:04:17.768 --> 00:04:22.123\nsecurity of devices themselves,\nwhat about those organizations,\n\n82\n00:04:22.123 --> 00:04:26.855\nfinancial organizations for instance,\ngovernment organizations where\n\n83\n00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:30.486\nhaving a laptop is simply not\nsomething that can happen.\n\n84\n00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:35.227\nAll of the work has to be done on desktops\nbecause everything has to be kept so\n\n85\n00:04:35.227 --> 00:04:40.420\nsecure that you can't take any work\noutside of the environment itself.\n\n86\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.670\nWell, how do we provide a service for\nthat?\n\n87\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.210\nThat's completely different to providing a\nservice where everybody has everything on\n\n88\n00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.910\ntheir laptop.\n\n89\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.140\nAnd they simply just send it in or\nadd it to a shared directory.\n\n90\n00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.910\nSo, there's a lot to be thought of when\nwe think about service provisioning.\n\n91\n00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.980\n&gt;&gt; All Right.\nSo, Jo when we start to take a look at\n\n92\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.690\nthis at the very beginning.\n\n93\n00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.050\nNow, understanding that we have\nto at least figure that out,\n\n94\n00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.420\nhow are we going to assign\nthis work to somebody.\n\n95\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.830\nWhat do we need to actually build,\nwho's gonna do the work?\n\n96\n00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing that we've got\nto do is we've got to take a look at\n\n97\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.850\nthe service provider itself, and\n\n98\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.950\nwhat type of service provider we're going\nto be Now, we have service provider.\n\n99\n00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.730\nWe have Type I, Type II and Type III.\n\n100\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.182\nI know imaginative, right?\n\n101\n00:05:23.182 --> 00:05:24.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n102\n00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.530\nwe have Type I service providers\ninternal to the business unit.\n\n103\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.710\nThat's important.\n\n104\n00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.760\nType II is a shared service unit.\n\n105\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.730\nAnd Type III is external\nto the organization itself.\n\n106\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.020\nNow, we covered these in foundation.\n\n107\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.520\nSo, this is not going to be anything new,\nbut if we take a look at\n\n108\n00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.500\nthe type 1 service provider,\nthat is a service provider, that's us.\n\n109\n00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.890\nAn IT service provider that's\ninternal to the business unit itself.\n\n110\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.570\nSo, they actually sit withing\nthe business unit that they serve.\n\n111\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.630\nVery very specialist.\n\n112\n00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.000\nProviding specialist knowledge to\nthat particular business unit.\n\n113\n00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.660\nNow, there are pros and cons to this.\n\n114\n00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.470\nThey become very very specialist and\nthey are able to help.\n\n115\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.530\nThey have a perfect awareness of\nthat business unit and understanding\n\n116\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.010\nwhat that business unit is looking to\nachieve, and how that business unit works.\n\n117\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.240\nAnd so, their response time and the\nquality of their support, for instance,\n\n118\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.460\nand sometimes the quality of the service,\ncould be enhanced because of that.\n\n119\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.580\nAnd I say could, because there's the cons\nto this as well, in that then we might\n\n120\n00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.750\nnot get the level of integration between\nall of our services that we actually need.\n\n121\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.520\nBearing in mind the components\nto our services are shared, and\n\n122\n00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.160\nthat can be a bit of a challenge\nespecially when it comes to things like\n\n123\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.960\nour infrastructure which is shared\nacross all of our services.\n\n124\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.660\nWe don't have a different\ninfrastructure for each business unit.\n\n125\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.500\nSo, type one service provider sits\nwithin the business unit, and\n\n126\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.810\nthey have very very specialist knowledge.\n\n127\n00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.490\nBut as it says on my last bullet point\nthe growth is limited to the growth of\n\n128\n00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.030\nthe business unit.\n\n129\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.920\nOkay?\nVery very specialist.\n\n130\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.950\nThey can achieve functional excellence and\ncost effective for\n\n131\n00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.260\nthe business unit, but just for that unit.\n\n132\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.570\nOkay?\n\n133\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.240\nNow, you've got a shared services unit,\nand the shared services unit is an IT\n\n134\n00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.780\nservices provider that's actually run\nas a business unit in it's own right,\n\n135\n00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.520\nproviding services to all different\nbusiness units, many business units.\n\n136\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.310\nNow, sometimes then that\nIT unit is combined\n\n137\n00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.360\nwith other shared services,\nlike HR and finance, etcetera.\n\n138\n00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.965\nSo, we've got the overview within\na shared services unit all for\n\n139\n00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:46.695\nthe entire infrastructure.\n\n140\n00:07:46.695 --> 00:07:49.256\nWe understand how\nthe components hang together.\n\n141\n00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:53.888\nWe understand the impact of\nchanges on the infrastructure, and\n\n142\n00:07:53.888 --> 00:07:57.331\nwe can actually say from\na very very high level.\n\n143\n00:07:57.331 --> 00:08:00.247\nExactly what impact any change will have,\n\n144\n00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:04.880\nwhat impact any incident has,\non the entire infrastructure.\n\n145\n00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.530\nIt also allows us to compare\nperformance between business units.\n\n146\n00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.730\nBut, of course,\nwe do that often to the detriment\n\n147\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.760\nof the specialized knowledge that is\nused within individual business units.\n\n148\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.830\nThere is no right or\nwrong to this, by the way.\n\n149\n00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.550\nIt really simply is down to\nwhat the organization requires.\n\n150\n00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.180\nRemember, it's about delivering\nvalue to the organization.\n\n151\n00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.930\nIt's not about what we want to do.\n\n152\n00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.310\nIt's about what the business needs.\n\n153\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.885\nAnd then we've the type\nIII server provider,\n\n154\n00:08:36.885 --> 00:08:39.800\nwhich is external to\nthe organization completely.\n\n155\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.630\nNow, in that middle bullet point there,\n\n156\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.100\nit talks about reducing TCO,\nthat's total cost of ownership.\n\n157\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.140\nThat's not always the case, so be careful.\n\n158\n00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.880\nUltimately, that's what we want to do,\nis reduce the total cost of ownership.\n\n159\n00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.780\nAnd what we're doing is\nwe're paying one flat fee,\n\n160\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.980\nas it were, to get some provision\nfrom this service provider.\n\n161\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.043\nBut it may cost us a little bit more\nbecause somebody still has to manage that\n\n162\n00:09:08.043 --> 00:09:08.820\ncontract.\n\n163\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.778\nSomebody has to manage the security\nimplications that come along with that.\n\n164\n00:09:12.778 --> 00:09:17.849\nWhich may mean that we have to be more\nsecure than we otherwise would have\n\n165\n00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:23.600\nbeen if we had an IT service provider\nwithin the organization, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.854\nIt also means that our capabilities and\nour resources of the service provider\n\n167\n00:09:27.854 --> 00:09:30.808\nare shared with our\ncompetitors potentially, too.\n\n168\n00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:33.141\nBut it's certainly shared\nwith other customers.\n\n169\n00:09:33.141 --> 00:09:38.056\nAt which point in time, the service\nprovider has then got to prioritize and\n\n170\n00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:41.508\nbalance resources amongst\nall of their customers.\n\n171\n00:09:41.508 --> 00:09:45.710\nSo you could see that as\npotentially a hindrance.\n\n172\n00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.800\nThere's not right or wrong,\nas I've already said.\n\n173\n00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.720\nAnd choosing your service provider\ntype is gonna based on, well,\n\n174\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.340\ntransaction costs, whether there\nare specialized skills required.\n\n175\n00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.050\nWhat about stability of services?\n\n176\n00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.580\nI also want to mention security in there,\nas well.\n\n177\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.650\nIf you are in a government organization,\nor you're in a financial organization, or\n\n178\n00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.720\nyou're in an organization like\npharmaceutical, for instance,\n\n179\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.378\nthat's highly competitive, well,\nyou might not want to share your data\n\n180\n00:10:17.378 --> 00:10:21.150\nwith an outsourced service provider.\n\n181\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.630\nA type III service provider, where they're\nproviding services to perhaps your rivals\n\n182\n00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:32.070\nor perhaps to other government\ndepartments or other organizations.\n\n183\n00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.090\nSo you have to think about\nsecurity in this decision, too.\n\n184\n00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.240\nAs I've said, there's no right or\nwrong in this.\n\n185\n00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:46.370\nWhat tends to happen is that as we move\nthrough scale in an organization, as\n\n186\n00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:53.683\nwe grow, there is a tendency to move from\nexternal to internal IT service providers.\n\n187\n00:10:53.683 --> 00:10:57.687\nA small organization is more\nlikely to go outside and\n\n188\n00:10:57.687 --> 00:11:03.603\nuse an external service provider because\nwe don't have to train in-house.\n\n189\n00:11:03.603 --> 00:11:06.069\nAnd we don't have to\nkeep the skills in-house.\n\n190\n00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:11.220\nAnd we don't have to have all of\nthe tools and the technology in-house.\n\n191\n00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.261\nWhereas an organization that grows, well,\n\n192\n00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:19.221\nwe come to a point in time where we have\nto make that decision as to whether we\n\n193\n00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:24.262\nretain service provision outside of IT,\nor outside of the organization,\n\n194\n00:11:24.262 --> 00:11:28.518\nor whether we bring service\nprovision into the organization.\n\n195\n00:11:28.518 --> 00:11:33.086\nAnd that in itself can be a challenge\nbecause if you've grown with\n\n196\n00:11:33.086 --> 00:11:36.409\nan external service provider,\nit can be very,\n\n197\n00:11:36.409 --> 00:11:41.738\nvery difficult to then suddenly create\nan IT team within the organization.\n\n198\n00:11:41.738 --> 00:11:45.994\nAnd I say this quite often, but\nyou can't just wave a magic wand and\n\n199\n00:11:45.994 --> 00:11:47.449\nit suddenly happens.\n\n200\n00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:49.230\nSo these are all considerations.\n\n201\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:54.450\nAnd like I said, there is no right or\nwrong when it comes to service provision.\n\n202\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.200\nSo, now we've looked at the different\nservice provider types.\n\n203\n00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:05.520\nLet's take a look at how we actually\ndefine a service for an organization.\n\n204\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.642\nHere we are in service strategy.\n\n205\n00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:11.612\nThis is where we come up with\nthe ideas for our new service.\n\n206\n00:12:11.612 --> 00:12:14.059\nAnd so\nwe have to understand our business, and\n\n207\n00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:17.160\nwe have to understand\nthe organization's needs.\n\n208\n00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.070\nNow, we've already talked in\nprevious sessions about our four ps\n\n209\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.640\nof service strategy.\n\n210\n00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.300\nUnderstanding their perspective and\n\n211\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.980\ntheir position, do they want to run,\njust maintain the status quo?\n\n212\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.405\nDo they want to grow,\ndo they want to transform?\n\n213\n00:12:30.405 --> 00:12:35.383\nAnd then those plans and patterns,\ntheir position and their perspective,\n\n214\n00:12:35.383 --> 00:12:37.882\nthat drives the plans for the future.\n\n215\n00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:42.850\nAnd those plans drive patterns of\nbehavior within the organization.\n\n216\n00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.930\nAnd we have to support that.\n\n217\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.180\nSo the first thing that we have to do.\n\n218\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.190\nNow, I'm gonna tell you,\nright the way from the word go,\n\n219\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:56.760\nthis has to be a balance between both\nproactive and reactive activity.\n\n220\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.800\nBusiness relationship management\nas a process is gonna help us with\n\n221\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.880\nthis, enormously.\n\n222\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.410\nCuz business relationship management\nwill understand the business,\n\n223\n00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.950\nunderstand the organization.\n\n224\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:14.220\nWe have a responsibility, as an IT\nservice provider, to deliver value.\n\n225\n00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.790\nNow, let me think about this for\njust a moment.\n\n226\n00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.489\nIf I'm an organization, and\nI'm looking for a solution,\n\n227\n00:13:25.489 --> 00:13:27.726\nwhich is exactly what happens.\n\n228\n00:13:27.726 --> 00:13:30.876\nGenerally, an organization, and\nwe'll say, well, do you know what?\n\n229\n00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:34.120\nWe need to have a solution\nto manage our finances.\n\n230\n00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.870\nAm I going to sit and think,\nI need a solution to manage my finances?\n\n231\n00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.389\nOkay, where do I go for this?\n\n232\n00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:44.774\nLet me speak to IT and\nsee if they can help.\n\n233\n00:13:46.523 --> 00:13:48.157\nThat's okay isn't it?\n\n234\n00:13:48.157 --> 00:13:50.751\nYeah, that's all right.\n\n235\n00:13:50.751 --> 00:13:52.406\nBut, you know what, I'd be so\n\n236\n00:13:52.406 --> 00:13:56.805\nmuch more impressed if before I'd even\nthought about that, if you'd come to me,\n\n237\n00:13:56.805 --> 00:14:01.552\nRonnie, and said, hey, look, you seem to\nbe struggling with your finances, there.\n\n238\n00:14:01.552 --> 00:14:03.980\nDo you think I could\nhelp you out with this?\n\n239\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.480\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n240\n00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.040\n&gt;&gt; This is why we say there has to be\na balance between proactive and reactive.\n\n241\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.990\nIn business relationship management, which\nwas the role I just put you in there,\n\n242\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.590\nbusiness relationship management's\nrole is not just to listen when I,\n\n243\n00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.070\nin the business, turn around and say,\n\n244\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.900\nI really need some help\nwith financial management.\n\n245\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.640\nBusiness relationship management's role\nis to actually look at what I'm doing,\n\n246\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.410\nand to say I think you need some\nhelp with financial management.\n\n247\n00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.430\nAnd I can help you.\n\n248\n00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:39.700\nI'm much more impressed by that than I\nam by having to go to IT with a problem.\n\n249\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.864\nNow, okay,\nnot everything can be proactive.\n\n250\n00:14:43.864 --> 00:14:49.894\nYeah, we're not in this utopian ideal, or\nITlLopian, as I like to call it, okay.\n\n251\n00:14:49.894 --> 00:14:52.550\nWe're not in this utopian ideal.\n\n252\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.990\nWe can't be proactive all the time,\nthings change.\n\n253\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.284\nAnd things change in the business.\n\n254\n00:14:56.284 --> 00:15:00.550\nSo IT as a service provider still\nhas to be able to react to changes.\n\n255\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.690\nSo when things change within\nthe organization, I can go to IT and\n\n256\n00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.960\nI can say, look,\nwe've changed our direction.\n\n257\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.060\nI need you to find a solution for this.\n\n258\n00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.100\nI need you to find something that\ncan help me with this, okay.\n\n259\n00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.010\nWe've still got to be able to do that.\n\n260\n00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.070\nBut at the same time,\n\n261\n00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.950\nI'm expecting business relationship\nmanagement to be proactive.\n\n262\n00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:26.880\nSo, business relationship management's\ngonna help us with this a huge amount.\n\n263\n00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:33.580\nAnd step one of service provisioning is\nall about understanding our marketplace.\n\n264\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:38.330\nNow, I don't mean outside in the big, wide\nworld, I mean within the organization.\n\n265\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.875\nAs a service provider,\nI need to understand who my business is.\n\n266\n00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:47.478\nThat's a group of customers,\nthat's my market space,\n\n267\n00:15:47.478 --> 00:15:51.841\nthat are interested or could be\ninterested in a particular service.\n\n268\n00:15:51.841 --> 00:15:57.451\nAnd my marketplace within my business,\nCan be defined by culture for instance,\n\n269\n00:15:57.451 --> 00:16:02.970\nor geographical location, or even\nthe business unit that they belong to.\n\n270\n00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.250\nOr even relationships that we have,\n\n271\n00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.720\nbecause these two business\nunits work together.\n\n272\n00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.750\nSo I have to understand\nwho my customers are.\n\n273\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.900\nWhat are they interested in?\n\n274\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:18.220\nIt's no good me selling an HR database,\nand I use the word,\n\n275\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:23.260\nselling, in apostrophes,\nin quotation marks rather.\n\n276\n00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.480\nIt's no good me selling an HR\ndatabase to the marketing team,\n\n277\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.879\nthey're not gonna be interested.\n\n278\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.913\nSo I need to be aware of who my market is,\nwho my business units are and\n\n279\n00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:40.816\nwhat they want to see in terms of service,\nand\n\n280\n00:16:40.816 --> 00:16:45.053\nthat means understanding\nwho my customers are.\n\n281\n00:16:45.053 --> 00:16:49.411\nAnd what their desired business outcomes\nare, in other words what they do, and\n\n282\n00:16:49.411 --> 00:16:51.240\nwhat their constraints are.\n\n283\n00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.879\nSometimes their constraints are money,\n\n284\n00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:56.825\nsometimes their constraints\nare time bound.\n\n285\n00:16:56.825 --> 00:16:59.020\nThere can be a multitude\nof different constraints.\n\n286\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.700\nBut business relationship management's\ngoing to help me with this, and this is\n\n287\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:09.060\nall about understanding who my customers\nare, what they do within the organization.\n\n288\n00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.470\nWhat outcomes they need us to facilitate.\n\n289\n00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:18.120\nSo I have to understand their\nobjectives and their strategies, and\n\n290\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.650\nthen I have to quantify the outcomes.\n\n291\n00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.092\nAll right, that can be a little\nbit of a challenge here.\n\n292\n00:17:27.092 --> 00:17:32.076\nIt already says, and already said, that\nfor us to understand what services we want\n\n293\n00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:36.649\nto deliver, we have to understand\nthe outcomes that we need to facilitate.\n\n294\n00:17:36.649 --> 00:17:41.400\nWhich means that we have to have what\nwe call outcome based definitions.\n\n295\n00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.794\nTake a look at that definition.\n\n296\n00:17:43.794 --> 00:17:46.690\nOkay, this is a business outcome here, and\n\n297\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.560\nthe business outcome is to reduce\nthe number of failed implementations.\n\n298\n00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.780\nSo we have to facilitate that outcome,\nokay?\n\n299\n00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:04.970\nWe have to reduce the number of failed\nimplementations, that's a service.\n\n300\n00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.830\nSo that's what we have to facilitate,\nand now we have to look for\n\n301\n00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.270\na way of doing that.\n\n302\n00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.790\nSo the first thing that we're doing,\n\n303\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.580\nis we're going to try and\nquantify that outcome.\n\n304\n00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.850\nAnd here we are, okay?\n\n305\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.530\nQuantify what outcomes there are.\n\n306\n00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:24.180\nSo this means looking for\ngaps in the market.\n\n307\n00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:29.710\nSo we go back to one, and step number one\nlooks at identifying your market space,\n\n308\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.800\nand then identifying\nwho your customers are.\n\n309\n00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.690\nWell, now we know what our customers are,\n\n310\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:41.784\nwhat they're doing, and\nwhat market they operate in.\n\n311\n00:18:41.784 --> 00:18:46.740\nIn other words, what business unit,\nor what area they work in?\n\n312\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.610\nNow we can say, okay then,\nthis is what they want to do.\n\n313\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.930\nThis is what they're doing right now.\n\n314\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.220\nIt's kind of like a mini gap analysis,\nright?\n\n315\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.200\nThis is where we say, okay,\nthis is where we can add value.\n\n316\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.880\nIt talks on there about\noutcomes not well supported,\n\n317\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:08.495\nand I'm talking about adding value, and\nthat's what we're looking for in strategy.\n\n318\n00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:12.349\nWe're looking for\nplaces where we can add value.\n\n319\n00:19:12.349 --> 00:19:15.132\nSo we're going to look\nin our service catalog,\n\n320\n00:19:15.132 --> 00:19:17.992\nthese are the services\nthat we already provide.\n\n321\n00:19:17.992 --> 00:19:23.650\nSometimes we can add value by removing\nduplication, by removing services.\n\n322\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.390\nWhen you've got an organization\nthat's growing,\n\n323\n00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.516\nthen sometimes growth occurs by merges and\nacquisitions.\n\n324\n00:19:29.516 --> 00:19:34.661\nAnd merges and acquisitions can sometimes\nmean a lot of duplicate processes and\n\n325\n00:19:34.661 --> 00:19:40.430\nmaybe a lot of redundancy, in terms of\nthe services and in terms of technology.\n\n326\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:45.510\nAnd so delivering value could mean\nreducing some of that complexity,\n\n327\n00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.680\nwithin our service offering.\n\n328\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.409\nOur service catalog tells us what\nwe're already providing right now.\n\n329\n00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:54.810\nOur service pipeline,\nwell, they're our ideas.\n\n330\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.200\nOkay, remember this from\nour foundation material?\n\n331\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.939\nYour service pipeline and\nyour ideas for your new services.\n\n332\n00:20:01.939 --> 00:20:04.637\nAnd your service-level agreements, well,\n\n333\n00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:09.479\nyou should have a portfolio of agreements,\nand your service-level agreements,\n\n334\n00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:12.470\nare what we have agreed to\nprovide to the customer.\n\n335\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.110\nYou could say well that's found in\nthe service catalog, but not quite.\n\n336\n00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:21.470\nThe articulation of what a service looks\nlike, is found in the service catalog, but\n\n337\n00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.530\nthe parameters within which we deliver\nthe services, was found in the SLA.\n\n338\n00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.390\nSo of course, we have to look at\nwhat services we're providing and\n\n339\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.199\nhow we're providing those services.\n\n340\n00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.500\nSo now we've got our,\nwell we know our market space, and\n\n341\n00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.810\nwe know who our customers are, and we\nunderstand what outcome they want to see.\n\n342\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.060\nSo now, we're going to what we\ncall visualize the service.\n\n343\n00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.730\nAnd visualize the service means,\n\n344\n00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.920\nunderstanding what that service\nshould look like, in the long term.\n\n345\n00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.930\nWhat is it that we actually want\nto deliver to our organization?\n\n346\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.304\nAnd we talk here about mapping services,\n\n347\n00:21:04.304 --> 00:21:07.916\ntwo archetypes that can help\nby identifying opportunities.\n\n348\n00:21:07.916 --> 00:21:11.854\nAnd we're going to look at\nthat a little bit later,\n\n349\n00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:17.640\nas we move into our second section,\nwhen we look at service provisioning.\n\n350\n00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:23.460\nNow our archetypes, well,\nthat's all about our capabilities.\n\n351\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.560\nAnd as I say, we're gonna look\nat that a little bit further.\n\n352\n00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.400\nWhen we represent our\nservice in our catalog,\n\n353\n00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.580\nwe represent our service by means of.\n\n354\n00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:39.740\nThen it should be articulated,\nby means of the value that it delivers,\n\n355\n00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:44.870\nin other words, what outcome it\nfacilitates value to the business.\n\n356\n00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.640\nWe don't call something\nan email service or\n\n357\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.330\nan Outlook service,\nwe call it the ability to send and\n\n358\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.560\nreceive email, because that's\nwhat we're delivering to you.\n\n359\n00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.550\nWe're not delivering email,\nwe're delivering an ability to send and\n\n360\n00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.480\nreceive email.\n\n361\n00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.350\nSo take a look at our archetypes, and\n\n362\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:11.870\nour archetypes are kind of our\ncapabilities, what we're capable of okay?\n\n363\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.910\nSo our archetypes could be something\nlike us as a service provider,\n\n364\n00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:22.720\nwe maintain transaction service for\nour customers, or we repair desktops.\n\n365\n00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.690\nThat's another service,\nis the repair of desktops.\n\n366\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:32.700\nOr we store data in databases, again,\nanother service for our customer.\n\n367\n00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.120\nOr we audit business processes,\nbecause we have the tools to do so.\n\n368\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.360\nAll of these are outcomes.\n\n369\n00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:45.580\nThis is what our service provider\ndelivers to our customers.\n\n370\n00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.300\nAnd of course, as we looked at,\nin a previous section,\n\n371\n00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:55.490\nwe looked at assets and our service\nassets made up of our resources.\n\n372\n00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.300\nThere are tangible assets and\nour capabilities, and\n\n373\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.760\nwe use those to create\na service which delivers value.\n\n374\n00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.337\nAnd the customer then uses that service\nin conjunction with their own assets,\n\n375\n00:23:09.337 --> 00:23:13.999\ntheir capabilities and\ntheir resources to realize the outcome.\n\n376\n00:23:13.999 --> 00:23:19.698\nSo we'll give you the ability, and then\nyou're going to use your resources and\n\n377\n00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:22.950\nyour capabilities to realize that outcome.\n\n378\n00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.860\nSo take a look at our customer assets.\n\n379\n00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:30.710\nAnd all of our customer assets, again they\nare either, capabilities or resources,\n\n380\n00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.590\ntangible or intangible.\n\n381\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.339\nAnd you will see,\nthat they're exactly the same,\n\n382\n00:23:37.339 --> 00:23:41.654\nas our assets,\nas well as our service assets.\n\n383\n00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:44.434\nSo what we're going to\ndo on the next slide,\n\n384\n00:23:44.434 --> 00:23:48.732\nas I said, we're going to look\nthen at service archetypes, okay?\n\n385\n00:23:48.732 --> 00:23:53.592\nAnd our service archetypes, over on\nthe left of this particular column here.\n\n386\n00:23:53.592 --> 00:23:57.753\nThese are the things that we do, okay?\n\n387\n00:23:57.753 --> 00:24:01.406\nThese are our skills,\nnow as an example here,\n\n388\n00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:05.915\nwe have different lines of\nservice on the left hand side.\n\n389\n00:24:05.915 --> 00:24:09.560\nAnd so we have different service\ntypes on the left hand side.\n\n390\n00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.057\nBut for the moment I want you to\nconcentrate on what is in under U1\n\n391\n00:24:14.057 --> 00:24:17.152\nthrough to U9, which are the archetypes.\n\n392\n00:24:17.152 --> 00:24:18.264\nIn other words,\n\n393\n00:24:18.264 --> 00:24:24.040\nthese are the skills that we utilize\nin these particular service types.\n\n394\n00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.260\nSo for instance,\nin our rental services, well,\n\n395\n00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.084\nthe skills that we deliver are leasing,\nlicensing, and\n\n396\n00:24:33.084 --> 00:24:37.420\nprovision of, maybe cars,\nfor instance, okay?\n\n397\n00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.023\nAnd we display that in\na service catalog and\n\n398\n00:24:41.023 --> 00:24:46.127\nour service catalog is what is\navailable to our customers and\n\n399\n00:24:46.127 --> 00:24:49.340\nour users for them to buy the service.\n\n400\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.850\nAnd they use what we call their assets,\ntheir capabilities,\n\n401\n00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:00.149\nor their resources to be\nable to achieve the outcome.\n\n402\n00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.495\nAll right,\nthat sounds about as clear as mud, right?\n\n403\n00:25:04.495 --> 00:25:08.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually is, it's really\n\n404\n00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.330\nsimple and it's just an expansion on\nwhat we looked at in a previous section.\n\n405\n00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.140\nLet's look in the middle,\n\n406\n00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.500\nthe service catalog,\nthat big box in the middle there, okay?\n\n407\n00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.020\nThe service catalog is just a,\n\n408\n00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:25.070\nwell, let's look at what we\nhave in the big wide world now.\n\n409\n00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:31.210\nIt's just a web-based form where we\ncan log on and we can buy services.\n\n410\n00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:36.320\nBut in order for me to get the best out of\nthose services, I've got to use my assets.\n\n411\n00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.646\nSo in other words, my service catalog\ntells me that there's email available to\n\n412\n00:25:40.646 --> 00:25:42.913\nme but I still have to send and\nreceive it.\n\n413\n00:25:42.913 --> 00:25:47.532\nSo I still have to use my knowledge and\nI still have to use my hardware and\n\n414\n00:25:47.532 --> 00:25:51.551\nmy software to be able to send and\nreceive that email, okay?\n\n415\n00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:57.812\nThat's fine but on the left hand side,\nunderneath you, we've got the archetypes.\n\n416\n00:25:57.812 --> 00:26:04.263\nAnd in order to be able to deliver email,\nthen IT, that's IT on the left-hand side,\n\n417\n00:26:04.263 --> 00:26:08.990\nwell, they have to have skills\nin database administration.\n\n418\n00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.520\nThey have to have skills\nin Microsoft server,\n\n419\n00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.830\nthey have to have skills in network\nmanagement, for instance, okay?\n\n420\n00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.460\nSo this is what's down\non the left-hand side.\n\n421\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.030\nSo what's on the left-hand side is,\nreally, in our architects,\n\n422\n00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:29.590\nthese are the types of skills,\nif you want, that we use within IT.\n\n423\n00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.177\nAnd we need to have those in\norder to be able to deliver\n\n424\n00:26:33.177 --> 00:26:35.221\nthe services in the catalog.\n\n425\n00:26:35.221 --> 00:26:40.047\nNow, the next two slides,\nthis one looks at services,\n\n426\n00:26:40.047 --> 00:26:44.564\nthat if we look here,\nif we look at u4 for instance,\n\n427\n00:26:44.564 --> 00:26:47.867\nthere's a utility-based service.\n\n428\n00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:53.154\nAnd the utility-based service\nis really just using one\n\n429\n00:26:53.154 --> 00:27:00.027\nparticular skill within IT and\ndelivering it to all of those customers.\n\n430\n00:27:00.027 --> 00:27:05.957\nAnd if we look at the other arrow\nin the asset-based service,\n\n431\n00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:10.973\nwell, what we're doing\nthere is we're using all of\n\n432\n00:27:10.973 --> 00:27:16.350\nour skills to deliver a service\nto one customer, okay?\n\n433\n00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.180\nThat would be really nice, wouldn't it?\n\n434\n00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:23.331\nThat would be lovely if that's what\nIT looked like, but it doesn't.\n\n435\n00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:25.154\nWhat IT generally looks like and\n\n436\n00:27:25.154 --> 00:27:29.105\nwhat our service catalog usually\nlooks like is something like this.\n\n437\n00:27:29.105 --> 00:27:35.143\nWhere, okay, Service B is what\nwe'd call asset-based and\n\n438\n00:27:35.143 --> 00:27:38.075\nwe're using three different\ntypes of skills or\n\n439\n00:27:38.075 --> 00:27:42.940\nthree different, you might think of\nthese as teams within IT, for instance.\n\n440\n00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.128\nSo the three different teams or\n\n441\n00:27:45.128 --> 00:27:48.841\nskills that deliver Service B\nto just one customer.\n\n442\n00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:52.843\nBut Service A, well,\nthat uses three different teams in IT and\n\n443\n00:27:52.843 --> 00:27:56.250\nit delivers a service to\nthree different customers.\n\n444\n00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:02.790\nAnd Service C, well,\nthat's just provided by one particular\n\n445\n00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:08.640\ngroup within IT but\nit's provided to many different customers.\n\n446\n00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.270\nNow, if you look at the internal service\nprovider, the internal service provider\n\n447\n00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:19.280\nactually is that service provider\nthat is that brown arrow under a2.\n\n448\n00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:24.107\nThat's your internal service provider,\na provider that sits firmly\n\n449\n00:28:24.107 --> 00:28:28.278\nwithin the customer environment or\nthat business unit, and\n\n450\n00:28:28.278 --> 00:28:32.712\nit's providing all of the skills\nneeded to that business unit.\n\n451\n00:28:32.712 --> 00:28:38.422\nWhereas a shared services, well, a shared\nservices is a mixture of everything,\n\n452\n00:28:38.422 --> 00:28:42.410\nwe're providing all services\nto all customers, okay?\n\n453\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.020\nWhy do we need to understand that?\n\n454\n00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.340\nWell, because we need to know what skills\nwe need to deliver our services to\n\n455\n00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.660\nour customers.\n\n456\n00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.870\nIt's quite clear that actually\nwhen you think about it,\n\n457\n00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.250\nthis is really what our service\nprovisioning looks like.\n\n458\n00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:02.951\nWe use all of our skills to\ndeliver all of our services and\n\n459\n00:29:02.951 --> 00:29:08.353\nwe need to understand what skills\nthen our customers have to have\n\n460\n00:29:08.353 --> 00:29:14.873\nin order to be able to use those services\nand to have those outcomes realized.\n\n461\n00:29:14.873 --> 00:29:17.939\nSounds a bit complicated, it's not really,\n\n462\n00:29:17.939 --> 00:29:21.100\nit's something that we do all the time,\nokay?\n\n463\n00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.443\nSo in order to understand\nexactly what type of services we\n\n464\n00:29:25.443 --> 00:29:29.423\nare going to deliver to\nwhat business units, well,\n\n465\n00:29:29.423 --> 00:29:34.141\nwe need to understand the outcomes\nthat they're achieving.\n\n466\n00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:36.044\nAnd in this particular diagram here,\n\n467\n00:29:36.044 --> 00:29:38.510\nyou'll see the outcomes that they want,\nokay?\n\n468\n00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.867\nAnd so you'll see that the outcomes\nthat they want are payments processed,\n\n469\n00:29:42.867 --> 00:29:45.811\ntransactions monitored,\npayments are secured.\n\n470\n00:29:45.811 --> 00:29:48.944\nAnd if you look at our our\nskills on the left-hand side and\n\n471\n00:29:48.944 --> 00:29:51.566\nthen you look at the customer\nassets on the top.\n\n472\n00:29:51.566 --> 00:29:55.839\nYou'll see that, well,\nthe security skill that we have or\n\n473\n00:29:55.839 --> 00:30:00.881\nthe security team within IT, well,\nthey're gonna perform all three\n\n474\n00:30:00.881 --> 00:30:05.710\nof those outcomes along the bottom\nto all of this customer assets.\n\n475\n00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.850\nAs I've said,\n\n476\n00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:12.918\nmost services are a mixture of all of our\nskills delivered to all of our customers.\n\n477\n00:30:12.918 --> 00:30:17.169\nIn other words, requiring all\nof our customer assets in order\n\n478\n00:30:17.169 --> 00:30:21.270\nto be able to achieve the business\noutcomes that they want.\n\n479\n00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:27.172\nRight, so that's our first\npart of service provisioning.\n\n480\n00:30:27.172 --> 00:30:31.087\nAnd in our next part of service\nprovisioning, we're going to go further\n\n481\n00:30:31.087 --> 00:30:35.810\nand we're actually going to look for\nopportunities within those market spaces.\n\n482\n00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:41.660\nUnderstanding what skills we have,\nwhat types of roles that we have,\n\n483\n00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:47.660\nwhich is where our archetypes come in,\nand also what assets our customers have.\n\n484\n00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.174\nIn other words, what skills and\nwhat experience they have.\n\n485\n00:30:51.174 --> 00:30:53.656\nSo we understand what\ntheir capabilities are,\n\n486\n00:30:53.656 --> 00:30:56.630\nwe understand what we're\ncapable of delivering.\n\n487\n00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.456\nSo now let's marry the two together and\n\n488\n00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:02.060\nthat's what we're gonna be\nlooking at in our next section.\n\n489\n00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you again, Jo, for\n\n490\n00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.610\nhelping us to take a look at\nservice provisioning here.\n\n491\n00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.080\nReminding us that we actually not only\nneed to take a look at what we want to\n\n492\n00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:16.470\nprovide but also what our customers are\nneeding as well from us, as services too.\n\n493\n00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.760\nThat the intermarrying between\nthem is kind of the key\n\n494\n00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.070\nto actually figuring what we wanna\ndo here in our service provision.\n\n495\n00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.888\nBut there is more to come on service\nprovision but that is for another episode.\n\n496\n00:31:26.888 --> 00:31:30.840\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n497\n00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n498\n00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.492\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more of the\nITIL Intermediate Service Strategy shows.\n\n499\n00:31:36.492 -->

Francisco,\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:08.236\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:11.667\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.640\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nshow right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.230\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.388\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:23.975\nAnd we're going to be taking\na look at service provisioning and\n\n9\n00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:25.880\nthis going to be a part two so far.\n\n10\n00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.372\nAnd here to help us out again is gonna be,\nwell, once again our ITIL,\n\n11\n00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:34.410\nwe'll just call her our ITIL\nmaster once again, Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.530\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.760\n&gt;&gt; I love all the superlatives Ronnie,\nI really.\n\n14\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.240\n&gt;&gt; I have almost run out of my thesaurus.\n\n15\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.390\nMy thesaurus is kinda getting thin there.\n\n16\n00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.790\nBut, Jo, we've taken a look at\nthe beginnings here of provisioning and\n\n17\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.980\nunderstanding a little bit more about it,\nbut there is a lot more to go.\n\n18\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.600\nSo Jo, where are we picking up?\n\n19\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we started off earlier by\nlooking at understanding our business and\n\n20\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.560\nlooking at market places and\nwhat market spaces we had.\n\n21\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.180\nAnd then looking at who\nour customers were.\n\n22\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.950\nAnd then marrying up our own capabilities\nand our own experiences and our own\n\n23\n00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.550\nskills along with our customer\ncapabilities and our customers skills.\n\n24\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.960\nSo we want to be able to provide a service\nthat we can utilize our skills to do so.\n\n25\n00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.820\nAnd they can then use their skills in\norder to achieve the business outcome.\n\n26\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.810\nSo we looked for that, and\nnow what were going to do is just take\n\n27\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.970\na foray into the next step,\nwhich is understanding the market spaces.\n\n28\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.050\nAnd now that we understand\nwhat were capable of, and\n\n29\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.770\nhow we work as an IT service provider.\n\n30\n00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.320\nWe understand what our\nbusiness is capable of, and\n\n31\n00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.050\nhow they currently use our services.\n\n32\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.490\nAnd what outcomes they'd like to achieve.\n\n33\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.060\nWell, now we take a look at market spaces,\nin other words, these opportunities.\n\n34\n00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.570\nSo where are the gaps in the market?\n\n35\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.440\nWe've looked at the service catalog and we\nknow what services we currently provide.\n\n36\n00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.420\nAnd like I said,\nwe know what skills that we have and\n\n37\n00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.110\nwhat capabilities we use\nto provide these services.\n\n38\n00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.530\nAnd we also understand what skills and\ncapabilities our customers have.\n\n39\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.840\nSo we know what we currently provide.\n\n40\n00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.470\nWhat are we not exploiting?\n\n41\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.190\nI don’t like to use the word exploit,\nbut you know what,\n\n42\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.088\nit’s the best word that fits\nin this particular scenario.\n\n43\n00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:32.725\nBecause our guarantee that I can\nlook into any organization and\n\n44\n00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:36.755\nI can take a look at the skills\nthat we have within IT.\n\n45\n00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:40.705\nAnd we can take a look at the skills that\nwe have within our customer base and\n\n46\n00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:42.515\nlook at the outcomes that they require.\n\n47\n00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:47.325\nAnd I will guarantee I will always\nfind an opportunity or a market space,\n\n48\n00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:49.635\nas we call it, that we can exploit.\n\n49\n00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:51.995\nWhere we can add further value.\n\n50\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.410\nIt says on the last bullet point there,\n\n51\n00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.310\ndefined by the business outcomes\nthat are facilitated by a service.\n\n52\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.140\nIn other words, it's an understanding\nthat there are outcomes that we're not\n\n53\n00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.255\nquite facilitating just yet.\n\n54\n00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:08.775\nMaybe we're underfacilitating or\n\n55\n00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:13.325\nmaybe they're just simply missing and\nwe're not facilitating at all.\n\n56\n00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:14.955\nMaybe they're new outcomes.\n\n57\n00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:16.645\nDon't forget, we're in service strategy.\n\n58\n00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:20.815\nSo we're understanding\nthe organization strategy.\n\n59\n00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:25.860\nBut we have to understand what\noutcomes they want facilitated.\n\n60\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.520\nNow, we don't actually type the email for\nthem and send it, no.\n\n61\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.010\nWhat we'll do is we give them the ability\nto send and receive the email.\n\n62\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.970\nBut we need to know that\nthat's what ability they want.\n\n63\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.900\nWe need to know what their end goal is,\nand their end goal is to send and\n\n64\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.638\nreceive an email.\n\n65\n00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:48.740\nNow I'm gonna go back to utility and\nwarranty from a previous session.\n\n66\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.580\nIn utility and warranty we looked at\nthe ability to send and receive email,\n\n67\n00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.040\nwhich was utility.\n\n68\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.270\nAnd the warranty was having\nshort levels of availability and\n\n69\n00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.800\ncapacity and\nservice continuity and security.\n\n70\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.060\nSo we want to be able to\nfacilitate an outcome\n\n71\n00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.190\nin the way that the customer is\nassured of those warranty levels.\n\n72\n00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.360\nSo we have to understand what outcome\nit is they want to facilitate and\n\n73\n00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.460\nat what level they want to\nfacilitate that outcome.\n\n74\n00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.560\nSo we need to know how\nthey use the service.\n\n75\n00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.063\nAnd that's that second bullet\npoint in that slide there,\n\n76\n00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:27.020\nis how do they use the service?\n\n77\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.590\nSo, I want to know how my\ncustomers use their emails.\n\n78\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.480\nDo they use their emails\non their cell phones?\n\n79\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.060\nOr, do they use their emails\njust purely on their laptops?\n\n80\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.440\nDo they use their emails on other\ndevices that they may have?\n\n81\n00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.310\nJust think about, many, many years ago,\nI used to have as a mainframe operator,\n\n82\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:54.070\nmany, many years ago, and now when I\nlook at the way that IT has evolved.\n\n83\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.810\nAnd we've evolved through\nlocal area networks and LANs.\n\n84\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.380\nAnd we've evolved through\nmid-range systems.\n\n85\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.730\nAnd everybody is using PCs and\ntablets now.\n\n86\n00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.981\nAnd yet we have the other type of,\nwell, I was gonna say laptop, but\n\n87\n00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:10.450\nI guess laptop is the wrong word to use.\n\n88\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.726\nBecause it doesn't actually do any process\nand everything is done in the cloud.\n\n89\n00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:19.365\nTo which we've kinda come full circle,\nstraight away back to where we were with\n\n90\n00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:24.005\nthe mainframe, only instead of a mainframe\nterminal being glued to your desk,\n\n91\n00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:27.814\nthis is now fairly portable, and\nyou have what is, a laptop, and\n\n92\n00:05:27.814 --> 00:05:31.309\nyou can access the cloud and\ndo all of your work on the cloud.\n\n93\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.610\nIt goes back to knowing how\ncustomers use services.\n\n94\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.790\nSome people don't need to have the process\nand power available at their fingertips.\n\n95\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.760\nSome people just need to have\naccess to the Internet in order\n\n96\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.360\nto be able to access their email.\n\n97\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.460\nNow others need to download their email\nonto their laptop and to be able to\n\n98\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.070\ncompile and save and attach documents,\netc., on their laptop.\n\n99\n00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.740\nHow will you know what your\ncustomers will benefit from and\n\n100\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.659\nwhat they will value if\nyou don't understand them?\n\n101\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.010\nLet me give you a personal example.\n\n102\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.630\nI was, how do I put this,\nlet's just say that there is somebody that\n\n103\n00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.950\nI know who was having a lot of problems\nwith downloading viruses onto their PC.\n\n104\n00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.722\nAnd on further investigation and\nno it wasn't me by the way.\n\n105\n00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:30.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n106\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.190\n&gt;&gt; On further investigation,\n\n107\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.280\nthe thing that I realized that they were\ndoing, the only thing that they needed\n\n108\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.490\ntheir laptop for\nwas actually to access the Internet.\n\n109\n00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.133\nThat was it, it was just to access\nsocial media, nothing more than that.\n\n110\n00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:49.957\nBut, every time they accessed something on\nsocial media, they ended up with viruses\n\n111\n00:06:49.957 --> 00:06:54.457\nand they ended up clicking on things they\nreally didn't need to be clicking on.\n\n112\n00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:59.392\nAnd so we ended up in situations where\nevery few weeks there were another couple\n\n113\n00:06:59.392 --> 00:07:02.330\nof hundred pieces of virus and\nmalware, etc.\n\n114\n00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.750\nYou know how we resolve that?\n\n115\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.430\nBy understanding the way that they use\nthe technology and said, well, okay then,\n\n116\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.930\nwe don't need the laptop do we?\n\n117\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.757\nWhat we need is one of those cloud books,\nthat's what we need.\n\n118\n00:07:15.757 --> 00:07:18.584\nAll you need is something\nto access the Internet,\n\n119\n00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:21.423\nyou don't need anything\nto do any processing on.\n\n120\n00:07:21.423 --> 00:07:26.680\nAnd it goes back to understanding how\nyour customers use their service.\n\n121\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.330\nIf you don't understand how\nthey use their service,\n\n122\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.510\nthen you're never gonna deliver\nanything of value to them.\n\n123\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.020\nWhat you're going to do is deliver\nsomething that perhaps works, but\n\n124\n00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.650\nstill has its issues.\n\n125\n00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.210\nAnd don't forget,\nwe want to remove constraints, so\n\n126\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.050\nyou have to be able to\ncompletely define value.\n\n127\n00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.170\nSo let's take a look at this, then.\n\n128\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.397\nGetting the most out of service\ndefinitions is to create them in\n\n129\n00:07:52.397 --> 00:07:53.762\nan actionable way.\n\n130\n00:07:53.762 --> 00:07:57.807\nIn other words,\nunderstanding what they want to do.\n\n131\n00:07:57.807 --> 00:08:00.102\nSo let's work this out, okay?\n\n132\n00:08:00.102 --> 00:08:04.072\nMobile workspace services Okay,\nhere we are in Utility.\n\n133\n00:08:04.072 --> 00:08:07.960\nWell they provide value to\nthe customer when, let's say,\n\n134\n00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.040\nbusiness processes continue to operate\nwithout being constrained by time.\n\n135\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.126\nThis is how we define utility,\n\n136\n00:08:17.126 --> 00:08:21.478\nunderstanding exactly\nwhat we need to deliver.\n\n137\n00:08:21.478 --> 00:08:25.378\nYou know the part where I said it\ndoes what it says on the team,\n\n138\n00:08:25.378 --> 00:08:29.380\nwell we need to understand\nexactly what it's supposed to do.\n\n139\n00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.910\nAnd we need to understand exactly\nwhat constraints we have to move.\n\n140\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.120\nLook at the constraints, we can look at\nthem individually, such as location or\n\n141\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.210\ntime or slowing down.\n\n142\n00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.280\nThat's performance, or\ndisruption from failures.\n\n143\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.770\nSo understanding what\nconstraints we need to move, and\n\n144\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.610\nthen we can take a look at warranty.\n\n145\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.430\nBecause the warranty then,\nonce we understand what the utility is,\n\n146\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.630\nwell the warranty there is, well,\nassured levels of availability and\n\n147\n00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:04.080\ncapacity and security and\ncontinuity as well.\n\n148\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:10.060\nSo the value is delivered when\nthe service provider secures a wireless\n\n149\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:16.500\nmessaging system that facilitates\nthe lending process to estimate\n\n150\n00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.550\nlending risks within a specific area or\na specific limit in\n\n151\n00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:27.528\na manner that is reliable,\nreliable being availability management.\n\n152\n00:09:27.528 --> 00:09:34.100\nSo what we've done here is we have tied in\nthat utility and the warranty together.\n\n153\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.740\nNow, and this is where we start\ntying in a lot of our processes.\n\n154\n00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.460\nHere we are in service strategy, and\n\n155\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.140\nwe are now in the middle\nof articulating a service.\n\n156\n00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.030\nThat's what a service\ndefinition looks like.\n\n157\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:55.470\nTo us here as a service provider, this\nis what a service definition looks like.\n\n158\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.140\nAnd so this is done in conjunction\nwith service level management,\n\n159\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.484\nbecause this is where we agree\nin service level management,\n\n160\n00:10:02.484 --> 00:10:05.117\nthose service definitions\nwith our customer.\n\n161\n00:10:05.117 --> 00:10:09.718\nThis is done in conjunction with business\nrelationship management because again,\n\n162\n00:10:09.718 --> 00:10:13.790\nthis is where we agree these service\ndefinitions with our customer.\n\n163\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.790\nAnd this is also done in conjunction\nwith service portfolio management,\n\n164\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:23.260\ncuz the articulation of that service\nneeds to be in our service pipeline.\n\n165\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.790\nSo when we look at our\nservice definitions then,\n\n166\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.920\nwell these are the types of\nquestions that we need to ask.\n\n167\n00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.010\nWho are our customers,\nwe've already looked at this, okay.\n\n168\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.470\nWhat outcomes do we need to support?\n\n169\n00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.420\nWhat assets do they need to use?\n\n170\n00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.560\nAnd what assets do we need to\nuse to provide them as well?\n\n171\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.490\nWhat type of activity\nare we going to undertake\n\n172\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.380\nin order to deliver that outcome?\n\n173\n00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.680\nAnd then, how do we create value?\n\n174\n00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.550\nBecause this is not just about utility,\n\n175\n00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.510\nthis is not just about doing\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n176\n00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.410\nBut it's also about how\nwe deliver it as well.\n\n177\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.998\nOnce we've worked out what\nour service definition is,\n\n178\n00:11:06.998 --> 00:11:09.483\nthen we have to work out what\nwe call our service model.\n\n179\n00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:14.760\nAnd our service model is how\nthe service hangs together.\n\n180\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.770\nIt describes not only the structure of\na service, in other words, how we get to\n\n181\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:24.980\nthat end point, but it also describes what\ncomponents make up that service as well.\n\n182\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.793\nSo it identifies those components and\n\n183\n00:11:28.793 --> 00:11:33.807\nit illustrates exactly\nhow we can achieve value.\n\n184\n00:11:33.807 --> 00:11:39.110\nLet's take a look then at this\nexample here of a service model, okay.\n\n185\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:46.020\nSo, part one then, this is a Web-based\nshopping model, should we say.\n\n186\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.690\nI'm sure that you can think of an example\nthat fits this model perfectly, okay.\n\n187\n00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.780\nSo, part one is the shopping,\nso we log online, don't we?\n\n188\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.650\nStep number one,\nI want you to follow this through,\n\n189\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.870\nstep number one, we log on,\nokay and we search for something.\n\n190\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:08.270\nAnd then, okay, I expect the service\nprovider, the person that's providing that\n\n191\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:13.700\nwebpage to assist me in selecting,\nthat's what a service provider does.\n\n192\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:19.220\nSo here I am as a customer, I've logged\non and I have searched for a particular\n\n193\n00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.569\npiece of, let's say I wanted to buy, I\ndon't know, what do I want to buy Ronnie?\n\n194\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.805\nHow about a camera, okay?\n\n195\n00:12:26.805 --> 00:12:29.784\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like tools, I like gadgets,\n\n196\n00:12:29.784 --> 00:12:30.370\nall right.\n\n197\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.665\nSo I want to buy a new camera.\n\n198\n00:12:31.665 --> 00:12:34.979\nSo first of all, I'm gonna logon to\nthis website and I'm gonna search for\n\n199\n00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:35.980\na new camera.\n\n200\n00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:41.388\nAnd I want a nice digital SLR\ncamera with interchangeable lenses.\n\n201\n00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:43.635\nSo I'm gonna type that into the search and\n\n202\n00:12:43.635 --> 00:12:49.510\nit's going to bring me up a list of\nsearch or a list of potential cameras.\n\n203\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.490\nNow look at part three and\npart four there.\n\n204\n00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.630\nFirst thing that I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna look at the recommendations.\n\n205\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:03.930\nNow that's not part of part two,\nbecause part two is kind of a by-product.\n\n206\n00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.110\nAnd that is the fact that in that top\nright-hand corner of this screen,\n\n207\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.680\nwe've got a shopping cart.\n\n208\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.870\nAnd so, at any point in time,\nI can add something to that shopping cart.\n\n209\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.734\nSo, whilst I'm looking at my\nrecommendations that I have,\n\n210\n00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:21.684\nI might not necessarily like the cameras,\nbut there's an accessory there.\n\n211\n00:13:21.684 --> 00:13:25.987\nThere's that accessory, that's that flash\ngun that I've always really wanted,\n\n212\n00:13:25.987 --> 00:13:29.480\nand it's just popped up, and\nI thought, I'll have that.\n\n213\n00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.860\nSo I've added that to the cart and\nit's gone into the top right-hand corner,\n\n214\n00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.940\ninto the cart.\n\n215\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.890\nAnd I'm maintaining the cart contents.\n\n216\n00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:42.160\nSo, I look at things like maybe\nratings on any particular camera.\n\n217\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.865\nI Iook at recommendations and\nI might even have a question.\n\n218\n00:13:46.865 --> 00:13:50.998\nSo let's come down and\nlook at part five which is the assistance.\n\n219\n00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:53.716\nAnd I might have a question and\nin which case then,\n\n220\n00:13:53.716 --> 00:13:57.757\nI'm going to speak to a sales assistant,\nmaybe via chat, for instance.\n\n221\n00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.917\nAnd then once I've had\nmy question answered,\n\n222\n00:14:01.917 --> 00:14:05.527\nwell there might be some special offers or\na promotional code.\n\n223\n00:14:05.527 --> 00:14:09.007\nNow I don't know about you Ronnie, but\nI can tell you now that whenever I buy\n\n224\n00:14:09.007 --> 00:14:12.177\nanything online, the first thing\nI do is go to a search engine and\n\n225\n00:14:12.177 --> 00:14:14.277\nfind out what codes there are available.\n\n226\n00:14:14.277 --> 00:14:19.601\nOkay, I want discount,\nI never want to pay full price.\n\n227\n00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:24.479\nBut then once I've decided what my\ncoupon is that I'm going to use,\n\n228\n00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:27.060\nthen I look at my shipping options.\n\n229\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.701\nAnd I look at what the options are,\n\n230\n00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:35.680\nhow much tax I'm going to have to pay,\ndepending on where in the world I am.\n\n231\n00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.580\nAnd then I'll get my final confirmation\nof exactly how much it's going to cost.\n\n232\n00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:47.870\nAnd I confirm exactly what\nshipping option I want to take.\n\n233\n00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.390\nAnd at this point in time,\nI then go off to payment processing.\n\n234\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.100\nNow payment processing, in this instance,\n\n235\n00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:03.100\nI'm gonna assume that the service provider\nhas outsourced payment processing\n\n236\n00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:08.310\nto maybe a third party at which point\nin time, the order is complete.\n\n237\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.200\nAnd then once it's been shipped,\n\n238\n00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.330\nthen we initiate a customer\nsatisfaction follow-up, all right.\n\n239\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.380\nEvery single point that we have there,\nevery single point, right the way through\n\n240\n00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:25.360\nfrom 1 through to 15,\nis what we call in IT a moment of truth.\n\n241\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.150\nThat is, a moment of interaction with\nthe customer, with the end user.\n\n242\n00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.573\nAnd so here in IT, we have to,\nas a service provider,\n\n243\n00:15:36.573 --> 00:15:42.320\nwe have to be able to identify\nthe moments of truth,\n\n244\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.560\nidentify the points where\nwe can add value, and\n\n245\n00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.090\nidentify exactly how we facilitate\neach one of those moments of truth.\n\n246\n00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:58.059\nAnd what components are needed in\norder to satisfy each moment of truth.\n\n247\n00:15:58.059 --> 00:16:03.645\nIf we go back through this, you'll see\nthat we start off with number one and\n\n248\n00:16:03.645 --> 00:16:07.114\nwe look at searching for\na particular camera.\n\n249\n00:16:07.114 --> 00:16:10.129\nAnd then we're going to\nlook at recommendations.\n\n250\n00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:14.665\nFor that camera or those recommendations,\nI might need a different component\n\n251\n00:16:14.665 --> 00:16:19.640\nbecause that might in itself, actually\ncall to a different service catalogue.\n\n252\n00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.440\nOr it might be searching in\nthat same service catalogue.\n\n253\n00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.870\nBut my card is probably going to be\nheld somewhere other than in the service\n\n254\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.210\ncatalogue.\n\n255\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:33.960\nIt may even be held by the third party\nthat's doing the payment processing.\n\n256\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.070\nAnd what about shipping?\n\n257\n00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.320\nI'm gonna use a third party\nto do the shipping for me, so\n\n258\n00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.540\nI need and\ninteraction with that third party.\n\n259\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.420\nSo each point in time, each interaction,\n\n260\n00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.900\neach moment of truth I may need\na different set of components,\n\n261\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:58.180\nor I may need different relationships or\ndifferent interactions\n\n262\n00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:03.320\nwith either on the databases internally,\nor maybe even externally.\n\n263\n00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.540\nSo I need to understand my moments\nof truth and I need to understand\n\n264\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.090\nwhere I can deliver value and\nalso, where I have not influence.\n\n265\n00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:16.510\nI don't have any influence necessarily,\n\n266\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.870\nover my third party,\nwho does the shipping for me.\n\n267\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.760\nI don't necessarily have much\ninfluence over the third\n\n268\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.770\nparty that does the payment processing for\nme.\n\n269\n00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.670\nBut we map out our service model.\n\n270\n00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.990\nWe understand how it all hangs together\nbecause that also helps us with risk\n\n271\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:37.220\nmanagement as well because we can\nidentify where we have potential single\n\n272\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:42.880\npoints of failure and where we need to\nadd in redundancy options, for instance.\n\n273\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.680\nSo now I understand what\nmy service is going to do.\n\n274\n00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.150\nWell, now what I want to do then.\n\n275\n00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:55.070\nIs I want to define my service unit and\ndefine my service packages.\n\n276\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:07.066\nMy service unit, well, my service unit\nis a point or a portion of one service.\n\n277\n00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:12.106\nWhereas my service packages\nare actually a portion of\n\n278\n00:18:12.106 --> 00:18:17.823\nmany different types of service\nthat are bundled together.\n\n279\n00:18:17.823 --> 00:18:19.157\nDoes that make sense?\n\n280\n00:18:19.157 --> 00:18:26.186\nWell, one service is let's think about our\nTV services that we have at home then.\n\n281\n00:18:26.186 --> 00:18:27.801\nWe have a choice, don't we?\n\n282\n00:18:27.801 --> 00:18:31.030\nThe first thing we are going to do,\nand we could follow actually.\n\n283\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.030\nWe could follow this particular\ndiagram here because\n\n284\n00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.760\nnowadays we log on to the website, and\nwe see what options are available, and\n\n285\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.240\nthen we select the option,\nand we put it in the cart.\n\n286\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.420\nHowever, at that point in time that\nwe putting it into our cart or\n\n287\n00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:50.805\ninto our trolley, we are actually\nselecting the packages that we want,\n\n288\n00:18:50.805 --> 00:18:55.705\nand those packages are based on\ncertain elements of other services.\n\n289\n00:18:55.705 --> 00:19:00.425\nSo for instance, shipping options,\nfor instance, would be\n\n290\n00:19:00.425 --> 00:19:05.835\na different service unit because\nit's come from a third party,\n\n291\n00:19:05.835 --> 00:19:09.105\nit's come from a different service,\nso it's a different service unit.\n\n292\n00:19:09.105 --> 00:19:15.050\nAnd we bundle these together and\nthat is what makes up our service package.\n\n293\n00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:20.340\nSo when we're going and we're selecting\na TV service provider we go into their\n\n294\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:27.750\nwebsite and we look at the package that we\nwant in terms of viewing, for instance.\n\n295\n00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.600\nAnd then we look at the package\nthat we want in terms of equipment.\n\n296\n00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.650\nDo we need the DVR service,\nthe ability to record or pause live TV?\n\n297\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.840\nDo we need to have that service in\nevery single room in the house?\n\n298\n00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.980\nDo we need to have that\nability to watch our live\n\n299\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.670\nTV from other places in the world for\ninstance?\n\n300\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.760\nAnd each one of those options,\n\n301\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.840\nas you might call them,\nis part of another service unit.\n\n302\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.689\nAnd we bundled them together\nto make a service package.\n\n303\n00:19:58.689 --> 00:20:01.909\nNow we understand found\nthe concept of Core services.\n\n304\n00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:06.942\nCore services are a service that is,\nwell, it's the core.\n\n305\n00:20:06.942 --> 00:20:10.115\nFor instance,\nthe basic needs as you might say.\n\n306\n00:20:10.115 --> 00:20:14.535\nThe ability to send and\nreceive emails would be a Core service.\n\n307\n00:20:15.565 --> 00:20:17.735\nNow we also have a supporting service.\n\n308\n00:20:17.735 --> 00:20:21.920\nAnd a supporting service is\nservice that sits underneath.\n\n309\n00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.720\nThat we have to have in order to be\nable to deliver the core service.\n\n310\n00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.350\nIt's a service in it's own right, like our\ninfrastructure is a supporting service.\n\n311\n00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:38.635\nAnd then on top of that we have service\nthe ability to send and receive email.\n\n312\n00:20:38.635 --> 00:20:41.658\nAnd then on top of that we\nhave an enhancing service.\n\n313\n00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:46.815\nWe call that an excitement factor or\nit may be an optional extra.\n\n314\n00:20:46.815 --> 00:20:50.839\nAnd an optional extra is\nsomething that we choose.\n\n315\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:56.220\nAnd that might be a differentiator, for\ninstance, the ability to have a shared\n\n316\n00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.520\ndirectory or instant messaging,\nfor instance is an optional\n\n317\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.870\nextra on top of the core service,\nthe ability to send and receive email.\n\n318\n00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:09.900\nNow there is KANO model in your\ncourse material, in your handout.\n\n319\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.570\nWhich is all about understanding customer\nneeds so I am gonna ask you at some point\n\n320\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:20.465\nin time when we finish this section to\ngo back and to review that KANO model.\n\n321\n00:21:20.465 --> 00:21:23.365\nSo service packaging is all.\n\n322\n00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:27.465\nAll about developing then\nthe differentiated offerings.\n\n323\n00:21:27.465 --> 00:21:31.905\nit's about bundling together the core\nservices, and the supporting services, and\n\n324\n00:21:31.905 --> 00:21:37.210\nthose enhancing services, and\nall of the bits that we want to include.\n\n325\n00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:43.050\nGiving the customer\na catalog of different,\n\n326\n00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.960\nyou might say, bundles for\ninstance in a service catalog.\n\n327\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.560\nHow does that translate into IT?\n\n328\n00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.480\nWell, into IT we would\ngenerally give a Core service,\n\n329\n00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.620\nthe ability to send and receive email.\n\n330\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:02.260\nAnd once enhancing service might be\nthe ability to have shared calendar.\n\n331\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:06.360\nAnother enhancing service might be\na different package for support.\n\n332\n00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.800\nMaybe a gold, silver and\nbronze level of support, okay?\n\n333\n00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.500\nIt's completely up to you how you\nwant to do this and how complex and\n\n334\n00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.140\nhow simple you want to do this.\n\n335\n00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.450\nSo take a look at this.\n\n336\n00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:23.030\nOur service package here\nin this particular instants\n\n337\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.560\nwell we've got different\nservice packages for\n\n338\n00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.990\nmaybe different customers\nwe understand that if we,\n\n339\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:36.300\nas it says here if we do this, if we look\nat our patterns of business activity and\n\n340\n00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.810\nwe understand our utility then\nwe know who our customers are.\n\n341\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:47.030\nAnd it means that we can actually provide\nservice packages for different customers.\n\n342\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:51.030\nA service level package A might\nhave a four hour response for\n\n343\n00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.200\na priority one incident.\n\n344\n00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.082\nService level package B might\nhave a two hour response.\n\n345\n00:22:56.082 --> 00:23:00.020\nService level package C might\nhave a six hour response.\n\n346\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.730\nYou will have different bundles\navailable for different services.\n\n347\n00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.550\nThis is something that we can all\nunderstand because we can understand\n\n348\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:14.190\nthe concept of this because we\ndo this in our day to day life.\n\n349\n00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:18.126\nWe do this all the time,\nwhen we looking for a new mobile phone or\n\n350\n00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:19.551\ncell phone provider.\n\n351\n00:23:19.551 --> 00:23:21.865\nWhen we're looking for a new TV provider.\n\n352\n00:23:21.865 --> 00:23:25.576\nWhen we're looking for\nan Internet service, we do all of this.\n\n353\n00:23:25.576 --> 00:23:27.827\nTake a look at this example.\n\n354\n00:23:27.827 --> 00:23:30.960\nWe understand the outcomes\non the left hand side.\n\n355\n00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.590\nAnd here in our service catalog\nare all of our options.\n\n356\n00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.370\nAnd if you look at the red\nribbons you'll see here,\n\n357\n00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.610\nthat actually we can\npick either one of those.\n\n358\n00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.210\nSo if we look at our outcomes,\n\n359\n00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:47.920\nour outcomes are well,\nwe want priority sign-up, okay.\n\n360\n00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.680\nSo here are our options.\n\n361\n00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.798\nDo we want that in real time or\na 12-hour service?\n\n362\n00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:55.160\nWell priority sign-up is in real time but\n\n363\n00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.150\nthen do we want to do a 5 point check or\na 12 point check?\n\n364\n00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.732\nAnd do we want to do standard\nencryption or enhanced encryption?\n\n365\n00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:03.861\nAll of these are packages and\n\n366\n00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:09.280\nwhat happens is that we pick which one\nwe want out of the service catalog.\n\n367\n00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.167\nAnd we end up with something\nthat looks like this.\n\n368\n00:24:13.167 --> 00:24:19.060\nIn other words,\nour own particular service just for us.\n\n369\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.010\nAnd this is what we do,\nas a service provider,\n\n370\n00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:30.070\nwhen we offer these service packages,\nas we call them.\n\n371\n00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:35.740\nWe allow our customers then to bundle\ntogether different service level targets.\n\n372\n00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.210\nAnd those different service\nlevel targets then become\n\n373\n00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.110\nthat definition of a service for them.\n\n374\n00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:46.840\nAs I say, it's something that we do\nas part of our every day life and\n\n375\n00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.610\nit's something that we\nunderstand completely.\n\n376\n00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:55.630\n30 years ago we didn't have any choice\non the type of TV packages we had.\n\n377\n00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.930\nWe had one type of TV package and that was\nthe one that came through the aerial or\n\n378\n00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.730\nthe antenna.\n\n379\n00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.650\nAnd that was it, that's all you got.\n\n380\n00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:04.970\nNowadays, we have so much choice.\n\n381\n00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.450\nAnd that's exactly what this is.\n\n382\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:13.380\nSo we identify then when we are performing\nservice definition, we identify\n\n383\n00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:19.100\nwhat services we want to deliver,\nwhat our core service is going to be,\n\n384\n00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.010\nwhat our enhancing services are going to\nbe, in other words, our differentiator.\n\n385\n00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:30.549\nAnd then, carrying on as this, we look at\nhow we're going to deliver some of these.\n\n386\n00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:38.210\nNow, we might deliver by using cloud to\nhelp us for some of our service units.\n\n387\n00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:43.280\nWe might allow some service packages\nto be developed specifically for\n\n388\n00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.780\neach customer segmentation.\n\n389\n00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.390\nBut whatever we do,\nwe have to design each particular package.\n\n390\n00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:55.740\nThere has to be a service level target for\neach bundle,\n\n391\n00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.870\nfor each package, and for each component\nof that bundle that is available, okay.\n\n392\n00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.173\nIt's not enough for\nus just to meet the outcomes,\n\n393\n00:26:06.173 --> 00:26:09.950\nas we've already said,\nthis about delivering value, okay.\n\n394\n00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.590\nWe have to ensure, as a service provider,\n\n395\n00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.030\nthat we know what\nthe customer wants to see.\n\n396\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.040\nThis is not just about the outcomes.\n\n397\n00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.800\nIt's not just about the ability\nto send and receive email.\n\n398\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.490\nThis is about value delivery, and\nvalue perception is based on outcomes,\n\n399\n00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:34.130\nas well as preferences,\nas well as that perception.\n\n400\n00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.510\nIt's an affordable mix of features.\n\n401\n00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.860\nIt's something that they want to see but\nthey perceive they're getting value for\n\n402\n00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.660\nmoney from.\n\n403\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.620\nSo at this point in time what I'd like\nyou to do now is just go back over\n\n404\n00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.470\nyour service provisioning sections.\n\n405\n00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.560\nNow we've covered two episodes\non service provisioning.\n\n406\n00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:59.780\nAnd I'd also like you to review your notes\non the Kano model for customer needs.\n\n407\n00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.530\nAnd we're available on our forum.\n\n408\n00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.694\nIf you do have any questions at\nall about anything that we have\n\n409\n00:27:05.694 --> 00:27:09.492\ncovered in these sections, then please\nfeel free to come back to us now.\n\n410\n00:27:09.492 --> 00:27:12.410\nAnd I'll do my best to answer\nany questions you may have.\n\n411\n00:27:13.486 --> 00:27:15.580\nAll right, Jo, well,\nthank you once again for\n\n412\n00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.900\nhelping us to understand a bit more\nabout the idea of service provisioning,\n\n413\n00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.840\nmaking sure that we get everything in\nline that we need to as we proceed on.\n\n414\n00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.680\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n415\n00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.400\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n416\n00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n417\n00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.496\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right

Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:19.440\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n5\n00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.440\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\nactually diving into service economics.\n\n6\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.180\nAnd here to help us is going to be, well,\nour ITIL Baroness herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n7\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.913\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:31.913 --> 00:00:33.671\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very for having me, Ronnie.\n\n9\n00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:39.012\n&gt;&gt; Jo, as we start to take a look here,\nwe've talked about a lot [LAUGH] of things\n\n10\n00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:45.240\nand the different principles, and now\nwe're moving into the realm of economics.\n\n11\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.160\nAll right, Jo, you are going to go\nway over my head at this point.\n\n12\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.312\nSo, where are we gonna begin?\n\n13\n00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:51.928\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n14\n00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:53.366\nit always boils down to the money, right?\n\n15\n00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, it does.\n\n16\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.440\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis is exactly where we are right now.\n\n17\n00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.750\nIt boils down to the money.\n\n18\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.027\nWe talked about, in previous sessions,\nwe talked about value, and value\n\n19\n00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:09.660\nas being perceived, and value as being\na mixture of outcomes and preferences.\n\n20\n00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.053\nAnd, if you remember in one previous\nsection, I asked you about,\n\n21\n00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:16.141\nif I gave you 20 grand to go and\nbuy a particular type of car,\n\n22\n00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:19.490\nwould you perceive value in it\nover the preferences that you had?\n\n23\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.240\nAnd you said?\n\n24\n00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n25\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.240\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n27\n00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.370\nit always comes down to the money.\n\n28\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.510\nAnd the simple fact is that value is\nabout an affordable mix of features.\n\n29\n00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.150\nWe've got to facilitate\nthe organization in making a profit\n\n30\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.050\nif the organization\nwants to make a profit.\n\n31\n00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.140\nNow, and\nthis is where it gets interesting,\n\n32\n00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.970\nbecause ITIL came from the Office\nof Government Commerce.\n\n33\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.338\nITIL came from the UK government.\n\n34\n00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:52.240\nAnd in fact, that's exactly where I came\nfrom, the Office of Government Commerce.\n\n35\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.252\nAnd so, ITIL was created out of a need\n\n36\n00:01:57.252 --> 00:02:06.004\nto be able to justify our expenditure\nwithin the UK government.\n\n37\n00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:10.960\nBecause we're spending taxpayer's money,\nand of course we had to be\n\n38\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.832\nable to justify what do we spend our\nmoney on, how we spent our money.\n\n39\n00:02:15.832 --> 00:02:19.631\nWe had to ensure that we spend our\nmoney in an impartial way, and\n\n40\n00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:23.933\nwe had to ensure that we were\ndelivering our services, and therefore,\n\n41\n00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:28.400\nusing taxpayer's money in the most\nefficient and effective way, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.660\nSo this is where ITIL came from.\n\n43\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.119\nIt came out of that need to justify\nour expenditure of taxpayer's money.\n\n44\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.190\nAnd so, we talk about making a profit, but\n\n45\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.180\nit's not necessarily\nabout making a profit.\n\n46\n00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.440\nIt's about being efficient and\neffective with our money.\n\n47\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.600\nAnd service economics?\n\n48\n00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.870\nWell, that's what it's about.\n\n49\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.700\nIt's about understanding how much it's\ngoing to cost to deliver a service,\n\n50\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.600\nwhat value that service gives us,\nand what returns,\n\n51\n00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.970\nif any, that service will\nactually give the organization.\n\n52\n00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.378\nNow, those returns don't have\nto be financial returns.\n\n53\n00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:11.683\nThose returns could be value-driven\nreturns such as legislative adherence,\n\n54\n00:03:11.683 --> 00:03:18.570\nor any form of competitive advantage,\nor maybe even just speed to market.\n\n55\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.490\nIt makes a huge difference whether an\ninternal or an external service provider,\n\n56\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.490\nbecause as an external service provider,\n\n57\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.450\nwe ourselves as the service provider\nhave to make a profit on our services.\n\n58\n00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.831\nAs an internal service provider,\n\n59\n00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:37.083\nwe have to facilitate the organization's\nability to either make a profit or\n\n60\n00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:42.350\nto be able to demonstrate efficient use\nof the budget that they have, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.876\nSo we have to understand not only what\nservices we provide, which is in our\n\n62\n00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:52.410\nportfolio, but how much money we've got\nand what return we get on that investment.\n\n63\n00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.020\nAnd what the impact to the business will\nbe if any one of those services fail.\n\n64\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.630\nSo, when we come up with an idea for\nany new service,\n\n65\n00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.310\nthen we have to create a business case.\n\n66\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.990\nAnd we'll talk about\na business case in a second.\n\n67\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.272\nPart of that business case\nwe have to articulate\n\n68\n00:04:12.272 --> 00:04:17.826\nthe return that we expect on that service,\nokay?\n\n69\n00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:20.550\nAnd we all like to think about money,\nand we really, really do.\n\n70\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.667\nAnd so ROI, return on investment,\nis used as a measure\n\n71\n00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:30.110\nto demonstrate whether we\nare actually delivering value or not.\n\n72\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.208\nIf an organization sees a return,\n\n73\n00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:37.600\nthen obviously we're delivering value,\nthat service is delivering value.\n\n74\n00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.030\nBe careful with that assumption, though,\nbecause this only works in organizations\n\n75\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.930\nthat want to grow and\norganizations that want to transform.\n\n76\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.550\nOrganizations that are not for profit,\nfor instance, or organizations that\n\n77\n00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.570\nare government agencies,\nthey're not interested in making a profit.\n\n78\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.290\nWhat they want to do\nis ensure that we have\n\n79\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.700\nefficient use of the money that we have,\nso that we're cost effective, okay?\n\n80\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.810\nNow, sometimes it's very difficult for\nus to get funding for\n\n81\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.530\nimplementing service management,\nfor instance,\n\n82\n00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.040\nbecause they don't necessarily see\nthe return on that investment.\n\n83\n00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.920\nSo that's something in itself.\n\n84\n00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.850\nEven if we're bringing in service\nmanagement, it's an improvement, and\n\n85\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.710\nwe have to make sure that we can\narticulate the benefits there.\n\n86\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.670\nSo, as we've already said,\nwe'll have to compile a business case for\n\n87\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.168\nany new initiative.\n\n88\n00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:33.144\nAnd that business case needs to\ninclude both the pre-program ROI and\n\n89\n00:05:33.144 --> 00:05:37.718\npre-program estimation of any\nvalue on investments as well.\n\n90\n00:05:37.718 --> 00:05:44.120\nNow, the post-program ROI is something\nthat we calculate after we've implemented.\n\n91\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.802\nIn other words, the pre-program ROI,\nthat's how much money do we expect\n\n92\n00:05:48.802 --> 00:05:53.126\nto get back and post-program ROI is,\nor how much did we make, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:53.126 --> 00:05:57.016\nSo the business case\nis a justification for\n\n94\n00:05:57.016 --> 00:06:01.020\na significant item of expenditure, okay?\n\n95\n00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.788\nWhich means that we have\nto have the document.\n\n96\n00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:07.121\nWhen we want to spend any\nsignificant amount of money,\n\n97\n00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:11.687\nwe have to have the document created\nby financial management that outlines\n\n98\n00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:14.960\nthe objectives that we\nare trying to facilitate.\n\n99\n00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.977\nIn other words,\nwhere we want to add value and\n\n100\n00:06:18.977 --> 00:06:23.966\nthe impact of us not\nimplementing that service, okay?\n\n101\n00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:27.264\nSo it's critical, absolutely critical,\n\n102\n00:06:27.264 --> 00:06:32.697\nthat our business case is built on not\nonly the value to the business, but\n\n103\n00:06:32.697 --> 00:06:39.130\nalso the impact of not implementing that\nparticular service to the business, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.463\nSo the business case, and\nthere's a template here for\n\n105\n00:06:42.463 --> 00:06:45.400\nwhat might be included in a business case.\n\n106\n00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.720\nThere is no right or wrong here,\nbut I will tell you that, yes,\n\n107\n00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.300\nwe should have business impacts in there.\n\n108\n00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.156\nWe definitely should mention the risks.\n\n109\n00:06:53.156 --> 00:06:58.371\nAnd also we will definitely have to\nhave recommendations in there as well,\n\n110\n00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:01.120\nwhat we would recommend as a solution.\n\n111\n00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.501\nNow, what I do wanna tell you there's\nno mention of ROI on there within that\n\n112\n00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:08.046\nbusiness case structure.\n\n113\n00:07:08.046 --> 00:07:13.733\nI would expect ROI to be seen onto\nthe business impact section, okay?\n\n114\n00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:16.070\nSo pre-program ROI, then.\n\n115\n00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:22.318\nThat's what we want to see\nwithin our business case, okay?\n\n116\n00:07:22.318 --> 00:07:25.720\nAnd that is a, well, it says pre-program.\n\n117\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.550\nIt's an estimation of exactly what\nreturns we expect to see, okay?\n\n118\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.704\nAnd those returns then will\nallow us to make decisions.\n\n119\n00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:40.249\nAnd we have, as we say in the second\nhalf of this screen here,\n\n120\n00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:43.830\nbudgeting decisions that\nfall into two types.\n\n121\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.112\nWe have two types of decisions.\n\n122\n00:07:45.112 --> 00:07:47.400\nWe have screening decisions.\n\n123\n00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:54.142\nSo that's a decision where we say, okay,\nyes, I quite like this initiative, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:54.142 --> 00:07:56.007\nThat's a screening decision.\n\n125\n00:07:56.007 --> 00:07:57.893\nDoes it meet a certain prerequisite?\n\n126\n00:07:57.893 --> 00:08:01.310\nAnd then we have a what we\ncall preference decisions.\n\n127\n00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.848\nPreference decisions are,\nwell, it's a preference.\n\n128\n00:08:04.848 --> 00:08:08.900\nI prefer this one or\nI prefer this particular type, okay?\n\n129\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.735\nSo we have two different\ntypes of decisions.\n\n130\n00:08:10.735 --> 00:08:16.110\nAs we say, the screening decision is yes,\nI definitely want to go down this road.\n\n131\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.670\nOr as the preference decision is, well,\nI prefer this one or I prefer this one.\n\n132\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.944\nNow, we're gonna get into\nsome financial terms.\n\n133\n00:08:22.944 --> 00:08:25.549\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz I know we always like that.\n\n134\n00:08:25.549 --> 00:08:27.180\n&gt;&gt; Bravo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n135\n00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.890\n[LAUGH] So screening decisions are about,\nwell, Net Present Value.\n\n136\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.807\nAnd we're gonna abbreviate that to NPV.\n\n137\n00:08:33.807 --> 00:08:39.584\nNet Present Value basically takes\nour inflow and looks at our outflow.\n\n138\n00:08:39.584 --> 00:08:42.620\nBut Ian says, did we make a profit?\n\n139\n00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.550\nAnd that's it, simple as that.\n\n140\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.910\nIt sounds complex, but it's really not.\n\n141\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.130\nDid we make a profit, yes or no?\n\n142\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.030\nIf the Net Present Value is negative,\nin other words, we didn't make a profit or\n\n143\n00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.120\nwe're not going to make a profit.\n\n144\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.580\nThen, we have to ask the question,\nwhy are we spending the money?\n\n145\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.150\nWhy do you think we would spend the money\nthen if we're not gonna make a profit?\n\n146\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.980\n&gt;&gt; Well, we may be investing into\na future part of the infrastructure, and\n\n147\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.090\njust taking a loss for now or it could be\nconsidered a loss leader of something?\n\n148\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, I love that, yeah.\n\n149\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.650\nA loss leader gives us\na competitive advantage.\n\n150\n00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.990\nSo an advantage over our customers,\nover our competitors rather.\n\n151\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.120\nNow, a loss leader is something\nthat's not going to make a profit,\n\n152\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.930\nnot in the short term.\n\n153\n00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.622\nBut in the long term, I expect that\nto evolve into new customers, okay,\n\n154\n00:09:29.622 --> 00:09:32.030\nmost definitely soon.\n\n155\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.222\nSo that's a screening decision.\n\n156\n00:09:34.222 --> 00:09:39.661\nAnd a preference decision, well,\nthat is a decision that allows us to,\n\n157\n00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:44.119\nor rather, it's a tool that\nallows us to make a decision for\n\n158\n00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:47.790\none particular service\nprovider over another.\n\n159\n00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.751\nNow, that might be based on profit, but\na preference decision is also based on\n\n160\n00:09:52.751 --> 00:09:57.262\nother factors such as the credibility\nof a supplier, for instance, or\n\n161\n00:09:57.262 --> 00:09:59.464\nthe credibility of a tool, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:06.746\nAnd we've got lots of other tools that\ncan help us in making those decisions.\n\n163\n00:10:06.746 --> 00:10:14.420\nYou see, not all opportunities can pass\nthis particular screening decision.\n\n164\n00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.962\nNot all opportunities will actually\ngive us that Net Present Value.\n\n165\n00:10:17.962 --> 00:10:20.275\nSo therefore, not all opportunities and\n\n166\n00:10:20.275 --> 00:10:24.400\nnot all new services that we see\nactually get to the preference decision.\n\n167\n00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.552\nThe screening decision happens first,\nthat's the yes or no.\n\n168\n00:10:27.552 --> 00:10:29.600\nAre we gonna go with this?\n\n169\n00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.844\nAnd then, the preference\ndecision happens afterwards.\n\n170\n00:10:31.844 --> 00:10:35.911\nAnd the preference decision is,\nwhich one are we going to go with?\n\n171\n00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:40.740\nAnd we might look at suppliers and\ntools that may offer us discount,\n\n172\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.320\nas we say, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.040\nWe might look at other\nfinancial constraints.\n\n174\n00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.540\nWe might look at preferred\nsuppliers as well.\n\n175\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.630\nSo this is what's contained\nin our business case.\n\n176\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.132\nAfter we have implemented a new service,\n\n177\n00:10:58.132 --> 00:11:02.738\nwe need to then work out what\nwe call the Post-Programme ROI.\n\n178\n00:11:02.738 --> 00:11:07.694\nAnd the Post-Programme ROI\nis what return did\n\n179\n00:11:07.694 --> 00:11:12.905\nwe actually realize from that new service.\n\n180\n00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:17.525\nSo what we'll do is we take\nthe program objectives.\n\n181\n00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:21.063\nAnd if we're here on the left-hand side,\n\n182\n00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:26.078\nwe take these program objectives and\nwe'll actually try and\n\n183\n00:11:26.078 --> 00:11:31.525\nidentify, put a quantitative\nterm on those objectives, okay?\n\n184\n00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:35.230\nBut first of all, well,\nwe understand the costs.\n\n185\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.200\nOkay, how much did that new\nservice actually cost us?\n\n186\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.936\nWe want to isolate actually\nthe effects of that new service and\n\n187\n00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:47.868\nthen convert the data into\na monetary conversion.\n\n188\n00:11:47.868 --> 00:11:50.430\nOkay, so, well,\nthat's what convert means, yeah.\n\n189\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.020\n[LAUGH] We convert the data into money.\n\n190\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.220\nSo just how much money did we make?\n\n191\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.370\nThat's the return on the investment.\n\n192\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.590\nAnd then these qualitative benefits,\nwell, we've got to make them quantitative.\n\n193\n00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.880\nDid we actually achieve our objective?\n\n194\n00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.819\nMaybe our objective was to\nmake our organization number\n\n195\n00:12:07.819 --> 00:12:11.184\ntwo in the world instead\nof being number three.\n\n196\n00:12:11.184 --> 00:12:13.580\nSo did we achieve that?\n\n197\n00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.280\nIt's not just about the profit,\nit's the value on investment as well.\n\n198\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.440\nAnd if we achieve the return on\ninvestment, if we achieved our\n\n199\n00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.140\nqualitative benefits, in other words,\nwe moved up in the marketplace.\n\n200\n00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.680\nBut then at that point in time,\nthen we want to communicate those results.\n\n201\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.280\nOf course, we want to tell everybody.\n\n202\n00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.740\nSo let me ask you another question then,\nRonnie.\n\n203\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.380\nDo we communicate where we failed?\n\n204\n00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we should.\n\n205\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we definitely should.\n\n206\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.466\nWe'll tell you right away throughout\nITIL that we have to have an open and\n\n207\n00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:48.602\ncollaborative environment.\n\n208\n00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:53.140\nAnd in fact, governance is about\ncontrol with fairness and transparency.\n\n209\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.999\nSo yes, we communicate our successes, but\n\n210\n00:12:55.999 --> 00:13:00.106\nwe also communicate the areas\nwhere we could do better as well.\n\n211\n00:13:00.106 --> 00:13:06.610\nSo yes, we do communicate when we didn't\nquite do as well as we expected because\n\n212\n00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:12.810\nthat feedback and those results,\nwell, we can use them in the future.\n\n213\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.120\nThose are lessons learnt for\nus to taken into the future and\n\n214\n00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.840\napply to new projects and\nnew initiatives and new services.\n\n215\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.660\nSo just to go back to that particular\nslide then, you'll see here that\n\n216\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.460\nthe calculation of that post-programme\nROI means that we look at the objectives,\n\n217\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:38.130\nwhich may be to move from being third\nto being second in our marketplace.\n\n218\n00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.920\nWe collect data on exactly how many sales\nwe've made as a result of implementing\n\n219\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.470\nthat new service.\n\n220\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.630\nWe isolate the effects of the program.\n\n221\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.810\nIn other words, we say, okay,\n\n222\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.770\nwell, how many of these new sales\nwere just down to this new service?\n\n223\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.230\nAnd then we convert that into money.\n\n224\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.010\nWe determine how much the actual\nnew service cost us to implement,\n\n225\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.810\nthat's our program costs.\n\n226\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:06.220\nAnd then we calculate the ROI, and\nwe then identify any quality as well.\n\n227\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.700\nIn other words, did we get from\nnumber two to number three?\n\n228\n00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.878\nNow, something else that we need to put\ninto our business case is our business\n\n229\n00:14:15.878 --> 00:14:17.448\nimpact analysis, okay?\n\n230\n00:14:17.448 --> 00:14:20.093\nAnd the business impact analysis, well,\n\n231\n00:14:20.093 --> 00:14:23.480\nwe identify our vital business functions,\nokay?\n\n232\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.370\nWhat is it that our\nbusiness has to achieve?\n\n233\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.260\nAnd then, we look at our proposals for\nour new services, and\n\n234\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.540\nwe say, bearing in mind,\nthere are vital business functions,\n\n235\n00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.930\nbearing in mind the outcomes that our\norganization wants to facilitate.\n\n236\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:45.960\nIf we bring this new service in,\nwhat will the impact to the business be?\n\n237\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:52.140\nHow much will it cost us as\na business if that service fails?\n\n238\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.506\nWhat is the cost of the outage?\n\n239\n00:14:55.506 --> 00:15:00.562\nOkay, business impact analysis is about\nidentifying whether a new service\n\n240\n00:15:00.562 --> 00:15:05.382\nwill not only be a benefit to\nthe organization, but whether that service\n\n241\n00:15:05.382 --> 00:15:10.690\nneeds to have additional redundancy,\nreliability measures in place as well.\n\n242\n00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.269\nSo this is about informing everybody\nwho reads the business case.\n\n243\n00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:21.130\nWell, this is what new\nservice I recommend.\n\n244\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.598\nThis is gonna be the positive impact\nto the organization, and otherwise,\n\n245\n00:15:24.598 --> 00:15:25.984\nhere's my value statement.\n\n246\n00:15:25.984 --> 00:15:30.270\nBut then also, this is gonna be the\nnegative impact if something goes wrong.\n\n247\n00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.171\nSo this is really how valuable\nit is to the business.\n\n248\n00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:35.379\nBecause if it's going to have a huge,\n\n249\n00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:39.037\nbig impact to the organization\nonce it's been implemented and\n\n250\n00:15:39.037 --> 00:15:43.591\nif the impact is gonna be negative when\nthere's a failure, then we definitely\n\n251\n00:15:43.591 --> 00:15:47.955\nneed to put some more money in and\nadd in redundancy to that service, okay?\n\n252\n00:15:47.955 --> 00:15:52.011\nSo what type of things are we\ndoing in business impact analysis?\n\n253\n00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:56.305\nWell, Financial management's\ngoing to help us with that.\n\n254\n00:15:56.305 --> 00:15:59.694\nWe've got to do this in\nconjunction with the business and\n\n255\n00:15:59.694 --> 00:16:04.580\nit has to be done in conjunction with\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n256\n00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.350\nSo we have to identify analysis points for\nassessments and again,\n\n257\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.020\nthat's something that we do with\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n258\n00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.760\nAnd we have to then wait to\nthese particular elements,\n\n259\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.580\nthese analysis points, and\n\n260\n00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.740\nscore our vulnerabilities\nagainst those elements.\n\n261\n00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.310\nSo how likely is this to fail?\n\n262\n00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.988\nAnd how important will\nthis be to the business?\n\n263\n00:16:30.988 --> 00:16:35.860\nAnd if this were to fail, then how\nlong do you think it would fail for?\n\n264\n00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.790\nAnd a lot of these what if questions\nbecause let's face it if we're bringing in\n\n265\n00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:45.190\na new service, how on earth do\nwe find the answer to these?\n\n266\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.958\nWell, our suppliers could help,\nespecially with a new service,\n\n267\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:54.070\nwe'll ask our suppliers to tell us what's\nhappened with their current customers.\n\n268\n00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.018\nWe'll ask them for reference sites.\n\n269\n00:16:56.018 --> 00:17:01.223\nWe'll ask them for details of when\nthere was an impact or life service,\n\n270\n00:17:01.223 --> 00:17:07.980\nand maybe when there was an impact during\nthe implementation of a service as well.\n\n271\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.920\nBusiness impact analysis is\nnot something that we want to\n\n272\n00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.760\nconduct when we think of that service\nas being in place in ten years time,\n\n273\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.170\nI'm not interested in\nthe impact in ten years time.\n\n274\n00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.590\nI'm interested in what the impact to the\nbusiness will be in six months time and\n\n275\n00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:24.520\nin a year's time.\n\n276\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:30.140\nIn a previous session, we looked at value\nrealized when we first implement a service\n\n277\n00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.830\nversus value realized once that\nservice has been embedded and\n\n278\n00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.520\nonce it's been used for a while.\n\n279\n00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.340\nI'm looking at impact to the business,\n\n280\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.670\nif this service fails,\nboth when it's implemented and\n\n281\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.430\nin six months time or in two years\ntime as well, so I'm looking for both.\n\n282\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.943\nAnd I need to ensure that I have that\ninformation at hand in my business case\n\n283\n00:17:52.943 --> 00:17:57.894\nbecause if I don't when I present it\nto the group, they're gonna say to me,\n\n284\n00:17:57.894 --> 00:18:00.782\nthere's not enough\ninformation in there John.\n\n285\n00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:06.110\nI'm sorry but we can't approve\nit because we need to understand\n\n286\n00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:12.240\nwhat value the business is going to\nplace on that particular new service.\n\n287\n00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.422\nYou know what it's like yourself.\n\n288\n00:18:16.422 --> 00:18:18.780\nYou go out, you get your new cellphone,\nwe all do it.\n\n289\n00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.573\nYeah we get our new cell phone and\nbefore you know it that cell phone is so\n\n290\n00:18:23.573 --> 00:18:27.570\nmuch a part of you that you\ncan't bear to be parted from it.\n\n291\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.850\nNow I don't know about you Ronnie but\nI know when I leave my cell phone at home,\n\n292\n00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.510\nit feels like there's\na piece of me missing.\n\n293\n00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.400\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n\n294\n00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.900\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH] and so this is\nexactly the same with our services.\n\n295\n00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.621\nWhen we implement a service\ninto our organization and\n\n296\n00:18:44.621 --> 00:18:48.371\ninto the live environment then we want\nthe business to feel as though hey,\n\n297\n00:18:48.371 --> 00:18:51.710\nif that service is not around then\nthere's a piece of me missing.\n\n298\n00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.390\nThe problem is that we've\ngotta prepare for that.\n\n299\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:59.900\nAnd it's really difficult here in\nservice strategy to actually quantify\n\n300\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.300\njust what that impact will be.\n\n301\n00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.620\nSo business impact analysis is\nnot something that's easy to do.\n\n302\n00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.390\nAnd this is why I said, we do get\nour suppliers to help us with this.\n\n303\n00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:15.380\nNow, what I'd like you to do right now\nis I would like you to take a look\n\n304\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.530\nat the materials that you've\ndownloaded along with this course.\n\n305\n00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.130\nAnd there was an exercise in\nthere in actually undertaking\n\n306\n00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.240\na business impact analysis.\n\n307\n00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.480\nSo it goes through just the steps\nthat we've already looked at\n\n308\n00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.650\nthat are on the slide in\nfront of you right now.\n\n309\n00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.950\nAnd I would like you to go\nthrough that exercise for\n\n310\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.490\nyourself based on the case\nstudy that you have.\n\n311\n00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.200\nAs always, I'm available on the forum, so\n\n312\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.340\nif you have any questions to do\nwith that business impact analysis,\n\n313\n00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.070\nthen please come back to me and\nwe will help you as best as we can.\n\n314\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.890\nBut for now, as I said,\nI'd like you to undertake this exercise.\n\n315\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.430\nIt should take you around\nabout 30 to 45 minutes to do.\n\n316\n00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n317\n00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.030\nWell, thank you again for\n\n318\n00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.000\nhelping us to understand more about\nthe idea of these service economics.\n\n319\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.320\nThings that we may not think about because\nwe're really focused in on IT, but\n\n320\n00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.080\nthis helps us to be able\nto justify the need of\n\n321\n00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.360\nthe way that the money is gonna be\nused in our organization as well.\n\n322\n00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.060\nWell that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n323\n00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.860\nSigning off for ITPRO TV,\nI'm your hose Ronnie Wong.\n\n324\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:22.930\n&gt;&gt; And I\"m Jo Peacock.\n\n325\n00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:27.329\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL

00:00:12.405\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:15.160\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.680\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy Show,\n\n6\n00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.344\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:25.690\nToday, we're gonna actually be looking at,\nwell, sourcing strategies as well.\n\n8\n00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.440\nAnd here to help us out is gonna\nbe our ITIL herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.710\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.720\n&gt;&gt; Thanks very much, Ronnie, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.510\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n12\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.015\nNow Jo, when we start to take a look\nhere at sourcing strategies and we're\n\n13\n00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:45.520\nready talking about service strategies,\nyou've got me tongue tied right now.\n\n14\n00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.530\nWhat are we actually gonna\nbe talking about, Jo?\n\n15\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.370\n&gt;&gt; In all of our previous sections,\nwe've looked at value creation,\n\n16\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.740\nwe've looked at the perception of value,\nwe've looked at what makes up value.\n\n17\n00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.593\nAnd then we've looked at what makes up\na service, how we define a service,\n\n18\n00:01:03.593 --> 00:01:06.367\nhow we identify who our customers are, and\n\n19\n00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:10.640\nwhat market spaces we want to fill,\netc., or exploit.\n\n20\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.420\nAnd then, of course, in the last section\nwe looked at we turn on investment and\n\n21\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.180\nhow we actually justify a new service.\n\n22\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.790\nWell, now we're looking at how\nwe source a new service, and\n\n23\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.495\nhow we support a new service as well.\n\n24\n00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:29.640\nThere's an assumptions so far I guess,\nthat as a service provider\n\n25\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.050\nthat we are going to create\nof our services ourselves and\n\n26\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.980\nthen deliver them to the business sales,\nbut you know what, that's not the case.\n\n27\n00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.095\nAnd in fact the conversation that we\nhad earlier on was based on value for\n\n28\n00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:48.637\nmoney, return on investment, and\nsometimes, well the fact that skills may\n\n29\n00:01:48.637 --> 00:01:53.946\nlie outside of our environment, and\noutside of us as a service provider.\n\n30\n00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:57.334\nAnd it might actually be better for\nus and more efficient for\n\n31\n00:01:57.334 --> 00:02:00.030\nus to source these skills elsewhere.\n\n32\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.510\nAnd so that's what we're gonna be looking\nat in this section is really just,\n\n33\n00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.270\nwhen we make these decisions and\n\n34\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.690\nwhat type of sourcing options\nwe've got available to us.\n\n35\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n36\n00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.960\nSo it sounds like a topic that we really\nneed to understand what's gonna be\n\n37\n00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.730\nthe best strategy for our organization.\n\n38\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.180\nSo where are we gonna begin?\n\n39\n00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're just gonna look\nat the different options.\n\n40\n00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.400\nThat's what we're going to do, and\nwe're just gonna go through these options.\n\n41\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.610\nAnd just really outline at a very,\n\n42\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.580\nvery high level what would drive\na decision to move to each option.\n\n43\n00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.110\nWhen we go and we find a, let's say we\nwanted to buy a cell phone, for instance.\n\n44\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.340\nWe would go out and we would, well,\nI don't know if you're anything like me.\n\n45\n00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.240\nBut I'd certainly,\nI'd be researching on the internet, and\n\n46\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.690\nI'd be looking to see what handsets\nwould deliver the best functionality for\n\n47\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.750\nme and then I'd be looking at where\nI could get these handsets from.\n\n48\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.630\nThen, what service provider would\nprovide me with the best service.\n\n49\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.000\nIncluding things like coverage,\ncell phone coverage and\n\n50\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.130\nwhat provider is best in the area that I\nlive in, also the areas that I travel to.\n\n51\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.590\nAs well as things like what\nabout roaming options and\n\n52\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.110\ninternational options cuz obviously you\nand I have both got different accents.\n\n53\n00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.380\nWe're not from the same place,\nand one of us travels,\n\n54\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.540\nso I need to have that ability.\n\n55\n00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.360\nAnd all of those elements to me will\ndefine my sourcing strategy and\n\n56\n00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.490\nthey will define where I buy my handset\nfrom or where I lease my handset\n\n57\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.630\nfrom, or\nwhat service provider I actually use.\n\n58\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.600\nSo, we've gotta get away from\nthe assumption that we need to do\n\n59\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.750\neverything in-house.\n\n60\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.130\nWe don't need to do everything in-house.\n\n61\n00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.630\nAnd certainly, when you look at\na lot of our services that we\n\n62\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.440\nprovide to our organization well,\nnot all of them are specialist.\n\n63\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.270\nAnd quite a lot of them are very generic\nservices, such as an email service,\n\n64\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.810\nfor instance.\n\n65\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.640\nIt's not a specialist service,\nit's not something that we have to\n\n66\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.210\nbuild in-house and\nwe have to deliver to our business.\n\n67\n00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.160\nIn fact, the organization that\nbuilds an email service in house is\n\n68\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.980\nprobably the one that's very, very unique.\n\n69\n00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.640\nAnd pretty much an anomaly.\n\n70\n00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.940\nI don't know of any organization that's\nactually built their own email service.\n\n71\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.870\nNot unless it was an experiment,\nnot unless there was\n\n72\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.170\nan innovative tech company who wants to\ncome up with a new way of doing things.\n\n73\n00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.570\nWe don't generally tend to do that,\nand so outsourcing really means\n\n74\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.730\nlooking at other alternatives\noutside of the organization for\n\n75\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.690\nthe delivery of some of our services,\nit's as simple as that.\n\n76\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.710\nSo when we decide on a sourcing strategy,\nwe have to decide whether we want\n\n77\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.140\nto in-source or whether we want to\noutsource, whether we want to go outside.\n\n78\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.460\nThink about specialty.\n\n79\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.990\nThink about what services we\nprovide to our organization or\n\n80\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.930\nwhat services they want us to provide and\nwhether we actually have the skills and\n\n81\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.640\nwhether it's going to be cost\neffective for us to develop and\n\n82\n00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.840\nthen support that service in-house.\n\n83\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.840\nIn a lot of instances,\nit's not cost effective for\n\n84\n00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.900\nus to do that, especially when\nyou think about the fact that,\n\n85\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.980\nI mentioned in previous sessions,\nwe're in the 21st century.\n\n86\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.240\nAnd technology moves so\n\n87\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.740\nquickly, if we develop something in-house\nwill we be able to keep up with that pace?\n\n88\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.200\nWhat happens when our operating\nsystem needs upgrading?\n\n89\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.210\nIf we have developed\na particular service for\n\n90\n00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.930\nour organization and then we have\nto upgrade our operating system.\n\n91\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.690\nWell, how soon do we get hold of that\noperating system because we then have to\n\n92\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.480\nupdate the actual application\nthat we've developed ourselves.\n\n93\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.080\nSo we need to get hold of\nthe operating system early on so\n\n94\n00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.450\nthat we can develop that new\napplication on a new platform or\n\n95\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.070\nthe existing application\non a new platform.\n\n96\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.102\nAnd what about increased functionality?\n\n97\n00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:57.030\nOur end-users expect to see new\nfunctionality in our services almost on\n\n98\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.170\na monthly basis nowadays.\n\n99\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.670\nWe always expect things to change.\n\n100\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.310\nSo what about our resources and\nour capabilities,\n\n101\n00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.640\nhow much do we have in terms of skills and\nexperience to be able to keep up?\n\n102\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.140\nIt was probably the norm I would say,\n\n103\n00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.230\n20 years ago as we started to move\naway from mainframe services.\n\n104\n00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.470\nWe learned a lot of developer skills.\n\n105\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.030\nAnd it was the norm to develop\na lot of services in house.\n\n106\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.090\nWhereas now the commercial off-the-shelf\nproducts, well, they're widely available.\n\n107\n00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.520\nAnd because a lot of these are so\n\n108\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.420\neasily configurable, then it's no\nlonger the norm to develop in house.\n\n109\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.480\nAnd that's considered to be\nsomething of a specialist skill.\n\n110\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.930\nAnd so\ntherefore not all organizations do that.\n\n111\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.920\nAnd we have to consider all of these\nelements when we're looking to outsource.\n\n112\n00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.570\nSo look at the questions that we ask here.\n\n113\n00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.340\nDo the services, well if we were\nto bring in that service in-house,\n\n114\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.770\nwould it improve our resources and\nour capabilities?\n\n115\n00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.420\nWhat about our competition?\n\n116\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.870\nOur competition building their services\nin-house or do they outsource themselves?\n\n117\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.330\nSo does it provide us as a business\nwith a competitive edge to\n\n118\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.699\nbuild the service in-house?\n\n119\n00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.370\nAnd what about interactions with service\nproviders, other suppliers for instance?\n\n120\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.530\nAs I've mentioned, if we have to\ninteract with the operating system,\n\n121\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.950\nwhich we all do, we've all got\nan operating system on our desktops.\n\n122\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.650\nIf we have to interact with them and\nthat operating system is updated,\n\n123\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.940\nthen, how do we get access to the early\nversion of the operating system, and\n\n124\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.670\nhow do we ensure that our service\nthat we have built in-house\n\n125\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:47.820\nis upwards compatible and compatible with\nnew versions of the operating system.\n\n126\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.936\nWe can't really.\n\n127\n00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:54.847\nIf we take a look at the bottom\npart of the slide, you have to ask\n\n128\n00:07:54.847 --> 00:08:01.370\nyourselves Why wouldn't our customers\ngo to our sourcing provider?\n\n129\n00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.886\nWhy would they use us?\n\n130\n00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:09.010\nWhat value, I guess I was going to say,\nwhat benefit do we add,\n\n131\n00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.806\nbut what value do we add to the process,\nokay?\n\n132\n00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:16.815\nAnd I think about our customers that\nwant to go sometimes directly to\n\n133\n00:08:16.815 --> 00:08:21.330\na vendor instead of those that want to\ncome through us as a service provider.\n\n134\n00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.879\nWell, obviously,\nwe know our infrastructure much,\n\n135\n00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:28.188\nmuch better than our customers do.\n\n136\n00:08:28.188 --> 00:08:33.138\nI'd be very, very wary about a customer\nthat wants to go directly to a vendor,\n\n137\n00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:37.202\nbut I've heard this before, and\nI'm sure that you have, too.\n\n138\n00:08:37.202 --> 00:08:40.677\nThe customer that comes to us,\nand here's an example, and\n\n139\n00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:43.180\nit happens on a daily\nbasis in the IT world,\n\n140\n00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.990\nthe business customer that comes to us and\nsays, I'd like a new laptop, please.\n\n141\n00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.197\nWe say, okay then, well, that laptop's\ngonna cost you a thousand dollars.\n\n142\n00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:56.938\nThey say, well, no, it's not\nbecause I can go down to the store,\n\n143\n00:08:56.938 --> 00:09:01.596\nwhatever the store may be, and\nI can buy exactly the same model for\n\n144\n00:09:01.596 --> 00:09:06.957\n$500, so why are you going to charge\nme in-house a thousand dollars?\n\n145\n00:09:06.957 --> 00:09:10.834\nWell, because we charge you\ntotal cost of ownership.\n\n146\n00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:12.993\nWe will build the laptop for you,\n\n147\n00:09:12.993 --> 00:09:16.397\nwe'll put all of our services\non the laptop for you.\n\n148\n00:09:16.397 --> 00:09:20.560\nWe will support you when something\ngoes wrong on that laptop, and\n\n149\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.340\nwe also provide all of the environmental\nissues, the electricity, etc.\n\n150\n00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.530\nThis is why it costs you a thousand\ndollars to buy it from us.\n\n151\n00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.321\nIt's not the fact that\nwe're more expensive,\n\n152\n00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.264\nit's the fact that we'll do everything for\nyou.\n\n153\n00:09:34.264 --> 00:09:38.506\nOkay, yes, you can go down to the store\nand you can buy a laptop, but\n\n154\n00:09:38.506 --> 00:09:41.130\nyou're gonna have to build it yourself.\n\n155\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.530\nYou're gonna have to support it yourself,\nit's not going to be supported on our\n\n156\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.788\ninfrastructure, so you're going\nto need your own infrastructure.\n\n157\n00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:48.750\nAnd by the way,\n\n158\n00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.636\nyou're gonna have to make sure you charge\nthe battery before you come into work\n\n159\n00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:58.391\nbecause you're not using our environment\nto plug that laptop into as well.\n\n160\n00:09:58.391 --> 00:10:00.853\nThat sounds a bit harsh, I know, but\n\n161\n00:10:00.853 --> 00:10:05.860\nthat's just an example of how we would\ngo to our customers and we would say,\n\n162\n00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:12.500\nwell, this is the reason why you can't go\ndirectly to any particular vendor, okay?\n\n163\n00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:18.900\nJust remember that we also control the\ndisruption, and the disruption is where\n\n164\n00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:25.380\na vendor may actually disrupt an outsource\nthat may disrupt our infrastructure.\n\n165\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.290\nIf a vendor comes to us rather than\ngoes directly through to our customer,\n\n166\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.400\nwe can control that because we'll\nhave the contracts in place and\n\n167\n00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.060\nwe've got the expertise\nto manage our vendors,\n\n168\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.560\nour software suppliers,\nand our service suppliers.\n\n169\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.603\nOur customers don't have that skill and\nthat expertise, nor do they need to.\n\n170\n00:10:44.603 --> 00:10:49.448\nJust be really, really careful when\nwe outsource, okay, really careful.\n\n171\n00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:56.092\nRelying on a vender, on a supplier to\ncreate our, it says our edge there, but\n\n172\n00:10:56.092 --> 00:11:02.038\nto create our distinctiveness and\nto create our USP is really risky.\n\n173\n00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:05.520\nBecause, at some point in time,\nsomebody's going to want to copy you,\n\n174\n00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.061\nat some point in time, a competitor's\ngoing to see what you're doing and\n\n175\n00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:10.950\nis going to want to copy that.\n\n176\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.440\nSo, who owns the intellectual\nproperty right for\n\n177\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.140\nthat particular piece of functionality?\n\n178\n00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.500\nIf it's a supplier that you have had,\nan external outsourced vendor,\n\n179\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.240\nthat you've had to provide that for you,\nthen do they own the property right?\n\n180\n00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.160\nSo, do you own them?\n\n181\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.290\nAnd if you own them, then what's to stop\nthis vendor creating something very,\n\n182\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.480\nvery similar and\nselling that then to your competitor?\n\n183\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.230\nIt can be very, very risky, and that's one\nof the reasons why some organizations like\n\n184\n00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.310\nto keep everything in-house.\n\n185\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.620\nSo, let's take a look there\nat our Sourcing Strategies.\n\n186\n00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.470\nYou've downloaded the materials, so\n\n187\n00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.650\nthese next two slides list\nthe various Sourcing Strategies,\n\n188\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:56.030\nyou've got these in your material, so\nwe're just gonna go through each one.\n\n189\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:00.860\nAnd we're just gonna look at a very,\nvery quick explanation of each one.\n\n190\n00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.329\nYou have to think about, and this is\nsomething that you'll have an exercise\n\n191\n00:12:06.329 --> 00:12:08.203\nabout when we finish these slides.\n\n192\n00:12:08.203 --> 00:12:12.894\nYou have to think about in what\ninstance you would select each type of\n\n193\n00:12:12.894 --> 00:12:14.471\nsourcing structure.\n\n194\n00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:17.685\nOkay, insourcing,\nit's fairly obvious, okay?\n\n195\n00:12:17.685 --> 00:12:21.730\nInsourcing is where we,\nwell, we build it in-house.\n\n196\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:26.210\nThis is where the customer actually\nuses us as a service provider to\n\n197\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.310\nbuild that particular service in-house.\n\n198\n00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:34.890\nOutsourcing, well, that's where we go\noutside to an external organization and\n\n199\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.980\nwe'll get them to build,\nto perhaps support that service for\n\n200\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.370\nus and that's outsourcing.\n\n201\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.356\nThen there is co-sourcing or\nmulti-sourcing, and co-sourcing or\n\n202\n00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:50.220\nmulti-sourcing, well, as it says there\nit's a combination of both insourcing and\n\n203\n00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.840\noutsourcing.\n\n204\n00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.550\nIt's where we might do some development or\nmaybe we'll do the support, but\n\n205\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.600\nthe external vendor might\ndo the development and\n\n206\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.030\nthey work with us to do the support.\n\n207\n00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:07.500\nOr whether it may well be that we actually\nget an external vendor to come in and\n\n208\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.600\nhelp us develop something.\n\n209\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.570\nThat would be considered co-sourcing,\nand then we have partnerships.\n\n210\n00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.480\nPartnerships are where organizations\nwork together to develop and\n\n211\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.240\nthen maintain New services, okay?\n\n212\n00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.340\nSo, this is about strategic partnerships,\nwhere we do something together, and\n\n213\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.930\nit's for\nthe greater good of both organizations.\n\n214\n00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.350\nAgain, you get into the realms of\nintellectual properties, so we have to\n\n215\n00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:40.110\nmake sure that, in this instance,\nthere's no competitiveness involved.\n\n216\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:45.040\nNow this can be used very much in\nthe medical industry, for instance.\n\n217\n00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.480\nNow, obviously, in every single country\naround the world, the medical industry is\n\n218\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.510\ncompletely different, and in the US,\nthe medical industry is very competitive.\n\n219\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.570\nWhereas elsewhere in the world,\nit's not competitive, so\n\n220\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.610\npartnerships between what we call trusts,\n\n221\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:08.130\nhospital trusts, were widely encouraged\nbecause they are incredibly efficient.\n\n222\n00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.120\nUnfortunately, that model doesn't\nwork everywhere in the world and\n\n223\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.380\nas I say in the US, we're very\ncompetitive with health care, and\n\n224\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.760\ntherefore, that's not a model\nthat would work very well.\n\n225\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.120\nThen we have business\nprocessing outsourcing,\n\n226\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.630\nbusiness process outsourcing is pretty\nmuch exactly as it says on the tin, and\n\n227\n00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.930\nit's outsourcing a business process.\n\n228\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.260\nSome of these organizations where we\ndon't actually pay our employees.\n\n229\n00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.390\nWe got somebody else to pay our\nemployees or we'll get somebody else to\n\n230\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.810\nmanage the payroll or maybe we get\nsomebody else to manage invoicing.\n\n231\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:48.620\nLarge organizations such as telecom\nproviders will actually outsource\n\n232\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.450\na process.\n\n233\n00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.840\nIn other words, the printing of invoices,\nthe printing of the bill every month I\n\n234\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.610\noutsourced that to an external third party\nin this application service provision.\n\n235\n00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:04.710\nAnd that is getting somebody who\nwill deliver us with an application.\n\n236\n00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.890\nAn application service provider\nnot an end to end service but\n\n237\n00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:12.360\njust the software portion of that service.\n\n238\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.080\nThat’s an application service provider.\n\n239\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.580\nThen we've got knowledge\nprocess outsource.\n\n240\n00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.270\nAnd the knowledge process\noutsource is where we,\n\n241\n00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:26.600\nwell it tells you there it's a step\nahead of business process outsource.\n\n242\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.600\nBut it's actually where we get\nan industry expert to come in and well,\n\n243\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.830\nimpart knowledge.\n\n244\n00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.540\nIt's where we will Outsource,\n\n245\n00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.900\nis where we outsource certain tasks and\n\n246\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.040\ncertain activities to an industry experts.\n\n247\n00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.465\nWhere we outsource to\na subject matter expert.\n\n248\n00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:53.304\nSo rather than bring that\nexpertise in house then\n\n249\n00:15:53.304 --> 00:15:55.596\nwe'll outsource it to somebody else.\n\n250\n00:15:55.596 --> 00:15:58.678\nSo we won't have Preferred\ncontractor to come in.\n\n251\n00:15:58.678 --> 00:16:03.916\nIs a perfect example where we will have\nan external consultant who will actually\n\n252\n00:16:03.916 --> 00:16:09.388\nbe on contract with us to provide us with\nexpertise in helping implementing service\n\n253\n00:16:09.388 --> 00:16:16.300\nmanagement and improving service\nmanagement or maybe achieving 20,000.\n\n254\n00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.350\nAnd then we've got cloud sourcing.\n\n255\n00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.050\nAnd cloud sourcing well\npretty much as it says.\n\n256\n00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.557\nAnd we're all familiar with cloud now.\n\n257\n00:16:23.557 --> 00:16:28.500\nAnd cloud sourcing is simply\nwhere we use the cloud.\n\n258\n00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.670\nThere are various different\ncompanies that are offering\n\n259\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.920\ncloud services without\nmentioning too many of them.\n\n260\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:41.490\nWe got a lot of technology now that\nhas an in-built cloud service.\n\n261\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:46.550\nAnd then, we also have companies that\nspecialize in cloud sourcing as well.\n\n262\n00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.815\nAnd then, we've got multi-vendor\nsourcing or multi-vendor sourcing,\n\n263\n00:16:50.815 --> 00:16:53.740\n[LAUGH] depending where\nin the world you are.\n\n264\n00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:59.670\nAnd multi-vendor sourcing really is just\ngoing out to lots of different vendors,\n\n265\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.810\nlots of different suppliers and\nthird parties.\n\n266\n00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.180\nAnd sourcing different services\nfrom different vendors.\n\n267\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.100\nSo, think about.\n\n268\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.800\nAnd this next slide here,\nwe expand on this multi-vendor sourcing.\n\n269\n00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.310\nThink about the fact that we'll get\nour infrastructure from one vendor,\n\n270\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.030\nfrom one supplier, and we do.\n\n271\n00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.810\nInvariably we've got somebody that we know\n\n272\n00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:26.190\nthat has expertise in\nthat particular area.\n\n273\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.760\nSo, we source our\ninfrastructure from them.\n\n274\n00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.250\nBut then,\nwe'll source one part of our service,\n\n275\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.990\nlet's say our email service,\nfrom somebody else.\n\n276\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.810\nAnd that sits on top\nof our infrastructure.\n\n277\n00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:41.510\nAnd then, we will source our financial\nservices from somebody else.\n\n278\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.300\nAnd again,\nthat sits on top of our infrastructure.\n\n279\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.760\nSo, think about\nthe technical complexities.\n\n280\n00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.430\nBut, also think about\nthe interdependencies here as well.\n\n281\n00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.500\nThe key thing with multi-vendor\nout outsourcing other roles, and\n\n282\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.130\nresponsibilities.\n\n283\n00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:02.400\nIt's not necessarily the money that's\ninvolved because sometimes [LAUGH] and\n\n284\n00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.750\nI know we like to think that it will but,\njust throwing money at something is not\n\n285\n00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.450\ngoing to solve the problem because if I\nwork for one vendor and Ronnie works for\n\n286\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:15.330\nanother vendor and my customer passes me\nan incident and I'm gonna look at it and\n\n287\n00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.990\nI'm gonna say,\nhey that's not my problem that's Ronnie's.\n\n288\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.310\nAnd I'm gonna pass it to Ronnie.\n\n289\n00:18:20.545 --> 00:18:23.365\nAnd he's gonna look at it and\ngo nope that's not my problem.\n\n290\n00:18:23.365 --> 00:18:24.595\nThat's gotta be Jo's.\n\n291\n00:18:24.595 --> 00:18:26.725\nAnd he's gonna pass it back to me.\n\n292\n00:18:26.725 --> 00:18:30.575\nAnd we could end up in that situation\nwhere both of us are digging our heels in.\n\n293\n00:18:30.575 --> 00:18:32.335\nBecause we're both fairly stubborn people.\n\n294\n00:18:32.335 --> 00:18:33.280\nRight Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n295\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:33.780\nYeah.\n\n296\n00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.140\nWe're going to be digging our heels in and\n\n297\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.330\nwe're going to be saying; \"Well,\nthis is not my problem.\" And so\n\n298\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:44.140\nit's really important that the contracts\nare watertight in this instance.\n\n299\n00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.710\nThat roles and\nresponsibilities are very clearly defined.\n\n300\n00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:53.013\nOtherwise, you could end up with incidents\nand problems falling down a black hole.\n\n301\n00:18:53.013 --> 00:18:53.540\nOkay.\n\n302\n00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.990\nSo, think about how we\nplan the integration, and\n\n303\n00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:02.310\nhow we plan those interdependencies and\nhow we're going to manage it.\n\n304\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:08.150\nThere is a requirement, and it is\nsomething that we can source tools for.\n\n305\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:13.000\nTo help us with that single interface for\nall of our vendors.\n\n306\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.190\nAnd a lot of service management\ntools now will help with that.\n\n307\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.980\nAnd they will interface with\nthe majority of our suppliers.\n\n308\n00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.530\nWhen we're selecting a supplier there's\nsome obvious points at the bottom\n\n309\n00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.010\nthere that we would look at\nthings like past achievements and\n\n310\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:35.110\ndemonstrated competencies and over all\ncapabilities and relationship dynamic.\n\n311\n00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.840\nPlease dont forget about reputation.\n\n312\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.855\nReputation and credibility are very,\nvery important.\n\n313\n00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:41.110\nAs-is.\n\n314\n00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.440\nYou know, the reference site.\n\n315\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.060\nUse a reference site.\n\n316\n00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.950\nAnd I always tell people, don't be\nafraid to ask for a reference site.\n\n317\n00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:53.740\nIf a vendor won't give you a reference,\nthen is that a vendor that you really want\n\n318\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:58.640\nto be putting your trust and\nyour faith in?\n\n319\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.643\nSo think about reference sites, think\nabout the credibility of your name, and\n\n320\n00:20:02.643 --> 00:20:04.265\nthink about the relationship.\n\n321\n00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:06.610\nThe relationship dynamics\nare really important.\n\n322\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.400\nDo you actually get along with the people,\nthe account manager, etc.,\n\n323\n00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.440\nin that supplier organization.\n\n324\n00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.230\nBecause if you don't,\nthen manage in a situation where\n\n325\n00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.430\nI say it's Ronnie's problem and\nRonnie says it's my problem.\n\n326\n00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.420\nThat's gonna be really difficult if you\ndon't get on with either one of us.\n\n327\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.400\nCuz neither one of us,\nbeing kind to help you out perhaps.\n\n328\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo, let me ask a question here and\nI know that once again,\n\n329\n00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.450\nITIL is not prescriptive in what\nwe're talking about here But\n\n330\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:40.070\nin this idea the multi-vendor sourcing,\nand you talk about the reputation.\n\n331\n00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:44.710\nIn our strategy and what we want to do for\nour organization, this is not the time for\n\n332\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.780\nus to experiment in\nterms the multi-vendor.\n\n333\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.020\nIn other words somebody that\njust said hey, I can do this.\n\n334\n00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.720\nI've no rule experience at,\nbut I guarantee I can do this.\n\n335\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.840\nWould that actually ever be a good\nstrategy to think about following?\n\n336\n00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.430\nAnd instead of the person that, or\nthe company I should say, that has a solid\n\n337\n00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:06.340\nreputation that you know that has\nbeen doing it for years and years.\n\n338\n00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.070\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, definitely.\n\n339\n00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.260\nIt depends on the business.\n\n340\n00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.420\nIt depends on our business.\n\n341\n00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.960\nAnd on our organization.\n\n342\n00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.860\nBut think about those organizations\nthat look at it as a strategy.\n\n343\n00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.470\nTo transform the business.\n\n344\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.600\nThey're looking at alternative\nsourcing solutions.\n\n345\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.470\nThey're looking at new technology.\n\n346\n00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.470\nThey're looking at innovation.\n\n347\n00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:31.500\nAnd, Well, let's face it, sometimes\nthese new companies that pop up and\n\n348\n00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:37.030\nsay, hey look, I can do this, well\nactually, sometimes they're the greatest\n\n349\n00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.130\nthing to come along but\nsomebody's gotta give them a chance.\n\n350\n00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:45.250\nNow, okay that's risky because we're\ngiving somebody a chance, but you know.\n\n351\n00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.720\nThey would have built up\na reputation somehow and\n\n352\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.370\nthey would've had previous\ncustomers no matter how small.\n\n353\n00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:57.020\nAnd certainly, any organization\nwho wants to be a supplier to you,\n\n354\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.680\nwell that organization is not only\ngoing to have a reference site,\n\n355\n00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.180\neven though it may be small.\n\n356\n00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:08.500\nBut they will also be able to provide you\nwith demo versions of that software and\n\n357\n00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:15.340\nIf they're a very young company, and\nthey're willing to be a supplier to you.\n\n358\n00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.950\nThen they're going to\ngive you a trial version.\n\n359\n00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.260\nAnd not just a trial but\n\n360\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.510\na trial sort of period of time\nwhere you can test things out.\n\n361\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.500\nThey're going to work\nwith your developers and\n\n362\n00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.340\nthey're going to give you\nopportunity to probably make tweaks,\n\n363\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.050\nand actually customize that piece\nof software to your requirements.\n\n364\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.180\nSo, this is a perfect time to be\nworking with people like that.\n\n365\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.790\nNow, organizations that have a strategy of\njust running the business I would say that\n\n366\n00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:49.620\nI wouldn't advice them to avoid\nthat type of sourcing strategy, but\n\n367\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.150\nI certainly advise them to think twice and\nthink about the viability of that.\n\n368\n00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.520\nBut organizations that want to grow and\n\n369\n00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.590\nwant to transform most definitely\nshould be involve here, so\n\n370\n00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.700\nthey mentioned here, underneath\nwhere it says managed out source and\n\n371\n00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:09.830\nit mentions the requirement for a single\ninterface for all related vendors.\n\n372\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:16.560\nAnd I did mention that most service\nmanagement tools nowadays actually have\n\n373\n00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:23.350\nservice provider interfaces and they will\nintegrate with well, most of the tools.\n\n374\n00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:28.540\nAnd you'll find that a lot of suppliers\nare using the same tools that we are.\n\n375\n00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.240\nWhich makes it very,\nvery easy from one perspective, but\n\n376\n00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.480\nfrom another perspective,\nit makes it very difficult.\n\n377\n00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.420\nAnd we have to think about how\nwe're going to manage this.\n\n378\n00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.750\nBecause the perspective that I'm\nthinking of is the security perspective.\n\n379\n00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.380\nWho owns the data?\n\n380\n00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.720\nIf we're outsourcing.\n\n381\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.840\nLets say we're outsourcing our\nservice desk for instance.\n\n382\n00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.000\nThen who owns the data about our people?\n\n383\n00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:51.637\nIs that their data?\n\n384\n00:23:51.637 --> 00:23:55.622\nCan they then sell that on to\nsomebody else for marketing purposes?\n\n385\n00:23:55.622 --> 00:23:56.846\nOr is it our data?\n\n386\n00:23:56.846 --> 00:24:00.608\nBecause if it's our data it's\nsitting on their server.\n\n387\n00:24:00.608 --> 00:24:05.391\nThink about how we pass calls to and\nfrom that service desk, that service desk\n\n388\n00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:09.750\ntakes a call, it passes it to our\nsecond level of our desktop support.\n\n389\n00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.160\nWhat's that interface going to look like?\n\n390\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.610\nWhat are the integration\npoints going to look like and\n\n391\n00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.804\nwhat about the security implications?\n\n392\n00:24:18.804 --> 00:24:22.390\nYeah, we might all be using\nexactly the same tool and\n\n393\n00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.550\nthat's perfectly feasible nowadays.\n\n394\n00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.080\nWe could all be using the same tool.\n\n395\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.860\nBut, we have to think about how we get\ndata from one to the other because\n\n396\n00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.340\nwe've still got firewalls and\n\n397\n00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:37.160\nwe've still got security implications\nhere that we have to consider.\n\n398\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.180\nAnd like I said,\nwhat about owning the ship of data?\n\n399\n00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.750\nThat's really key.\n\n400\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.760\nWhat are you going to\ndo with my information?\n\n401\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:50.670\nEverywhere around the world, we have\nlost governing data protection about\n\n402\n00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:57.320\nwhat you can do to with my information and\nwhat I can do with your information.\n\n403\n00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.230\nSo if we're using an outsourced\nservice desk who happens to\n\n404\n00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.930\nbe in a different country,\nthen whose laws apply?\n\n405\n00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.190\nIs it their laws that apply,\nor is it my laws that apply?\n\n406\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.540\nNow you might turn around and say, well,\n\n407\n00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.260\nit's my laws that apply because I'm the\ncustomer, but that's not strictly true,\n\n408\n00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.860\nbecause if the data is sitting\n4,000 miles away on a server there,\n\n409\n00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.900\nthen actually it's not our laws that\napply, it's their laws that apply.\n\n410\n00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.920\nSo all of this has to be considered and\n\n411\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.850\nall of this has to be\npart of the contract.\n\n412\n00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.970\nAnd like I said, roles and\nresponsibilities are very important.\n\n413\n00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.760\nIt's got to be water tight\nin that contract, but\n\n414\n00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.220\nwe're not just talking about laws and\nresponsibilities with people.\n\n415\n00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.510\nBut we're talking about\nthe responsibility with our data as well.\n\n416\n00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.250\nAnd that's all part of our\nsourcing governance, our policies.\n\n417\n00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:54.589\nAnd these are the policies not\nby which we're operating but\n\n418\n00:25:54.589 --> 00:25:58.420\nalso the policies by which\nwe manage our suppliers.\n\n419\n00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.655\nGovernance is not the same\nas supplier management.\n\n420\n00:26:00.655 --> 00:26:04.540\nSupplier management is about managing\nthe supplies on a day to day basis,\n\n421\n00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.940\nwhereas governance, well,\nthat's about control.\n\n422\n00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.950\nThat's about setting policies for\nhow long we negotiate\n\n423\n00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.680\nour contract for,\nwho actually manages our contracts.\n\n424\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.672\nIf we're talking about countries, then\nwho will be managing those contracts and\n\n425\n00:26:22.672 --> 00:26:24.057\nwhat policies apply?\n\n426\n00:26:24.057 --> 00:26:28.910\nWhat laws in what country\napply to the data?\n\n427\n00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.730\nWhat laws apply to\nthe transfer of information?\n\n428\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:33.780\nOkay.\n\n429\n00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.450\nIt says here that the governance is the\nweakest link in the sourcing strategy and\n\n430\n00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.840\nit is really is because quite often\nwe forget about having policies.\n\n431\n00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.170\nIt's really easy.\n\n432\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.180\nI come from a government background and\n\n433\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.670\nit's really easy because I can turn\naround and say, well you know I'm used to\n\n434\n00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:57.420\nnegotiating contracts for five years\nat a time and to go out to tender and\n\n435\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.190\nfollow the tender process and\nthat's part of the governance policies.\n\n436\n00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.400\nThose governments policies are there.\n\n437\n00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.030\nThey're cast in stone and they got nothing\nto do with IT, it's everything to do\n\n438\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:13.990\nwith the department and\nthe fact that we're in government, okay.\n\n439\n00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.660\nThat's great.\n\n440\n00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.130\nThat's easy for me.\n\n441\n00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:21.250\nWhat about those organizations where we\ndon't have those policies in place and\n\n442\n00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:22.930\nwe don't have that governance?\n\n443\n00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:27.220\nAnd the contract that you have with Ronnie\nyou've negotiated for one year, but\n\n444\n00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:31.110\nthe contract that you've got with me\nyou've negotiated for five years.\n\n445\n00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.850\nAnd then what happens at the end of\nthat one year or that five years there?\n\n446\n00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.560\nHow do we re-negotiate or\nare you just gonna sign it again?\n\n447\n00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.670\nWe need to have very clear roles and\nresponsibilities and\n\n448\n00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.360\nthere has to be clear governance.\n\n449\n00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:48.740\nIT is about efficiency and effectiveness\nand it's certainly not going to be\n\n450\n00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:54.370\nefficient to have an inconsistent or\nan ad hoc way to manage your suppliers,\n\n451\n00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:59.800\nwhich is why we need governance because\ngovernance gives us that consistency.\n\n452\n00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.610\nBut then we still have to\nhave suppliermanagement.\n\n453\n00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.860\nSupplier management,\nwell, that is the process\n\n454\n00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.550\nthat will manage those suppliers\non a day-to-day basis.\n\n455\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.960\nSo what do we have to\nachieve with sourcing?\n\n456\n00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.348\nWell, we've gotta meet\nthe outcomes of the organization.\n\n457\n00:28:19.348 --> 00:28:24.432\nAnd we've got to ensure that\nwe can deliver our services to\n\n458\n00:28:24.432 --> 00:28:30.910\nthe organization in a way that\ndelivers value that doesn't hinder.\n\n459\n00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.380\nWe have to meet utility and\nwe have to meet warranty.\n\n460\n00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.690\nAnd we have to do it in a way that is\ncost effective to our organization.\n\n461\n00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.930\nWhether that be by outsourcing to\nsomebody as it says there offshore or\n\n462\n00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:49.580\nwhether that be insourcing and\nproviding a service in house.\n\n463\n00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.530\nSo at this point in time, what I'd\nlike you to do now is I'd like you to\n\n464\n00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:58.210\ntake a look at the sourcing strategy\nexercise that you have in your materials.\n\n465\n00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.640\nAnd this should take you\naround about 30 minutes.\n\n466\n00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.760\nSo review, please,\n\n467\n00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.610\nall of the sourcing strategies that we've\njust covered and undertake that exercise.\n\n468\n00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.270\nIf you've got any questions,\nthen please come back to us.\n\n469\n00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.870\nWe're available by the chat, by the forum.\n\n470\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.118\nAnd I'll be more than happy to help you.\n\n471\n00:29:17.118 --> 00:29:21.430\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us to take a look at this idea of\n\n472\n00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:26.230\nsourcing and recognizing that the need\nmay not always be fulfilled by one.\n\n473\n00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.250\nWe may actually find out that we have\nto go outside our organization or\n\n474\n00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:33.900\nwe may choose to stay inside or\neven a blend of both to help us out\n\n475\n00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.840\nto achieve what we really\nwant to in our service here.\n\n476\n00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.570\nWell, that's a great place to also\nsign off for this episode, then.\n\n477\n00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.020\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie

great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.900\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n8\n00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.310\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.240\nAnd today we are going to take a look at\nstrategy management for IT services and\n\n10\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.020\nhere to help us is going to be our\nITIL magnet herself Jo Peacock,\n\n11\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.240\nJo welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.450\n&gt;&gt; Thanks very much for\nhaving me Ronnie, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.620\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine Jo and\n\n14\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.740\nI hope you're doing well too as we get\ninto the realm of strategy management.\n\n15\n00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.300\nNow, Jo, I understand the idea of setting\na strategy, and even coming up with\n\n16\n00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.350\na strategy, but strategy management in\nitself, how do we manage strategies?\n\n17\n00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.550\nThat's a little bit harder.\n\n18\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.840\n&gt;&gt; Well you'd just mentioned the idea\nof coming up with a strategy and\n\n19\n00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.500\nworking towards the strategy and working\nwith the strategy and the policies.\n\n20\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.460\nWell, somebody's got to manage that.\n\n21\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.400\nSomebody's gotta do it.\n\n22\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.310\nSomebody's got to set the strategy,\nsomebody has got to deliver the policies.\n\n23\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.340\nAnd somebody's got to make sure that that\nstrategy is relevant, and that it's valid,\n\n24\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.010\nand that it's, well, that we maintain our\nalignment with the business strategy.\n\n25\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.336\nIn previous episodes we looked at the high\nlevel business strategies of running\n\n26\n00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:29.348\nthe business, or growing the business,\nor transforming the business.\n\n27\n00:01:29.348 --> 00:01:34.639\nWell, here in Strategy Management for\nIT, we look at how we take that business\n\n28\n00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:40.172\nstrategy and then how we create policies\nand strategies that will align ourselves\n\n29\n00:01:40.172 --> 00:01:46.280\nwith the business strategy, but will\nalso allow us to govern going forward.\n\n30\n00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo,\nwhen we start to talk about that,\n\n31\n00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.870\nthat actually sounds like quite a bit to\ntry and get in this single episode here,\n\n32\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.520\nso we might be actually going into,\nI'm assuming, some multiple parts here.\n\n33\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.790\nSo Joe, where are we gonna get started?\n\n34\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're right, this first process\nthat we look at within service strategy,\n\n35\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.620\nwe're probably gonna have\na couple of episodes on this, and\n\n36\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.310\nwe probably are with all of\nour other processes as well.\n\n37\n00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.310\nSo, if that's okay, there's a lot to\ncover in our processes to really,\n\n38\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.930\nreally understand what our\nprocesses are about, and\n\n39\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.880\nto be able to manage and\ndefine our processes.\n\n40\n00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.120\nThen, obviously,\nwe've gotta get into the details.\n\n41\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.710\nSo with strategy management\nthis is where we start.\n\n42\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.690\nThis is about understanding how we,\nin IT as a service provider because\n\n43\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.330\nwe provided a service, are actually going\nto align ourselves with the organization.\n\n44\n00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.750\nHow we are going to help the organization\nachieve their objectives.\n\n45\n00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.730\nNow notice I say help or assist or maybe\nI like to the use of the word facilitate.\n\n46\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.000\nRemember the definition of a service, a\nservice is a means of delivering value by\n\n47\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.750\nfacilitating outcomes that\ncustomers want to achieve.\n\n48\n00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.650\nSo we're not going to achieve\nthese business outcomes for\n\n49\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.550\nour organization, but\nwe're going to facilitate that.\n\n50\n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.410\nYou know, many many years ago,\n20, 30 years ago\n\n51\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.550\nIT was seen as something that\nhappened in the background.\n\n52\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.230\nIt was something that helped us do\nthings like manage our finances etc.\n\n53\n00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.190\nAnd that was okay, 30 years ago.\n\n54\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.780\nBut now, IT is a part of\nabsolutely everything that we do.\n\n55\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.717\nDo you know that I have even got a toaster\nin my home that's Wi-Fi enabled?\n\n56\n00:03:31.717 --> 00:03:33.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A toaster?\n\n57\n00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n58\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.816\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n59\n00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:36.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have seen [LAUGH] so many gadgets.\n\n60\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.300\nKitchen gadgets in the home.\n\n61\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.800\nAnd yeah, that are Wi-Fi enabled now.\n\n62\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.500\nThat you can control with your cellphone.\n\n63\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.410\nLet's face it.\n\n64\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.400\nThe majority of things\nthat we do in the office.\n\n65\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.000\nThe majority of things that\nour organizations does\n\n66\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.080\nare completely controlled by IT.\n\n67\n00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.215\nFrom getting in through the front door.\n\n68\n00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:59.490\nAll the way through of going to\nthe machine, the vending machine and\n\n69\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.570\ngetting a cup of coffee or\ngetting a can of drink.\n\n70\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.368\nEverything we do is controlled by IT.\n\n71\n00:04:07.368 --> 00:04:10.767\nSo of course we've got to align\nourselves with the organization,\n\n72\n00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:13.758\nbecause the organization\ncompletely depends on us.\n\n73\n00:04:13.758 --> 00:04:17.960\nIf IT is not there then nowadays\nthe organization is simply not there.\n\n74\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.450\nThere's absolutely nothing nowadays\nin this 21st century that we can do\n\n75\n00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.340\nwithout IT.\n\n76\n00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.710\nEven our cars,\nyou can't service your cars without IT.\n\n77\n00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.940\nBecause the first thing that\na mechanic will do is plug it\n\n78\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.240\nin when you go to a dealer or\na workshop to get it serviced.\n\n79\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.910\nSo here in IT,\nwe really have to or in strategy,\n\n80\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.760\nwe really have to manage that\nrelationship with the organization.\n\n81\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.670\nAnd we have to I mentioned in\nthe previous session about\n\n82\n00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.570\na having a marketing mindset, and\nwe have to work with the business.\n\n83\n00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.820\nSo that the business understands\nour true involvement and\n\n84\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.660\nthat our business will understands that\nwe will facilitate their strategy.\n\n85\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.120\nBut we can only facilitate their strategy\nif they tell us what their strategies are.\n\n86\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.240\nSo, it's really important for\n\n87\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.900\nus to take those four Ps that we looked at\nin a previous episode, the perspective,\n\n88\n00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.110\nposition, plans and patterns and\nwe take those from the organization and\n\n89\n00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.030\nthen we apply them to our services and\nto the way that we work.\n\n90\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.620\nIt's all about making sure that we\nare aligned to the organization.\n\n91\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.430\nSo we will do analysis of both\nour internal environment,\n\n92\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.650\nhere within IT, and also the external\nenvironment in the business.\n\n93\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.110\nAnd that analysis will include\nanalyzing what we're capable of.\n\n94\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.410\nAnd we looked at that\nin a previous episode,\n\n95\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.710\nlooking at what we're capable of and\nthe sort of skills that we have and\n\n96\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.000\nmarrying them to the skills that\nthe business require us to have.\n\n97\n00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.520\nWell, this is where we do that.\n\n98\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.060\nThose exercises that we looked\nin the previous episodes,\n\n99\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.350\nthis is the process that\nundertakes all of that.\n\n100\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.680\nThis is the process that looks\nat the business strategy and\n\n101\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.450\nsays okay, what skills do we\nneed in order to facilitate\n\n102\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.010\nthe achievement of that strategy and\nthe achievement of those goals?\n\n103\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.510\nAnd we'll take those\nstrategies from the business.\n\n104\n00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.990\nWe'll analyze the skills that are needed\nto deliver that strategy and we will\n\n105\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.210\nproduce our own planning, documentation,\nour own strategy documentation\n\n106\n00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.950\nto enable us to facilitate those outcomes\nthat the business wants to achieve.\n\n107\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.060\nNow a strategy document is\nnot just a one-off thing.\n\n108\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.920\nYou don't just do it and then it's\ncast in stone for the next 20 years.\n\n109\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.970\nLife changes, the business changes.\n\n110\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.010\nIf the business wants to grow, then\nthey're gonna be looking for innovation.\n\n111\n00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.270\nThey're going to be looking for\nmaybe new directions.\n\n112\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.480\nWe may be talking about merges and\nacquisitions.\n\n113\n00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.470\nEvery time the business wants to grow,\nthen their strategy is going to change.\n\n114\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.890\nAnd that means our strategy\nhas got to change as well.\n\n115\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.210\nAt least one a year, annually,\nwe should be reviewing our strategy even\n\n116\n00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.250\nin an organization that just\nwants to run the business.\n\n117\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.750\nWe should be regularly\nat least once a year\n\n118\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.840\nnow regularly means on a regular basis.\n\n119\n00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.261\nAnd you could argue that every ten years\nis regular but nevertheless we will say at\n\n120\n00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:29.520\nleast one this year you should\nbe reviewing your strategy.\n\n121\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.496\nTo make sure that you are still\ncontinually aligned to the needs\n\n122\n00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:37.922\nof the business now calls CSI Continuous\nService Improvement as a life\n\n123\n00:07:37.922 --> 00:07:41.160\ncycle phase will have some\ninput into that as well.\n\n124\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.560\nAnd of course,\nbusiness relationship management,\n\n125\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.250\nanother process that we're going to\nlook at here in service strategy.\n\n126\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.018\nThat's going to have some\ninput into this as well.\n\n127\n00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:56.650\nSo your strategy doesn't remain,\ncast in stone for the next ten years.\n\n128\n00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.074\nWe still have to review it.\n\n129\n00:07:58.074 --> 00:08:02.930\nYou see the business strategy rests\nwith the executives of the organization.\n\n130\n00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.020\nAnd what tends to happen is that they\nhave a strategy, a direction for\n\n131\n00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.510\nthe business, and that then, well,\n\n132\n00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.870\nthat is rolled down into objectives and\ngoals for each individual business unit.\n\n133\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.050\nAnd we are another business unit,\nwe are no exception.\n\n134\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:25.410\nSo, we have goals that feed directly\ninto the organization strategy.\n\n135\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.800\nBut as well as that,\n\n136\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.820\nour main goal is to ensure that\nwe can facilitate their strategy.\n\n137\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.960\nSo, if they had a goal.\n\n138\n00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.520\nAnd that they were going to,\nlet's say, their sales team.\n\n139\n00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.670\nThey wanted to increase sales\nby 50% over the next year, and\n\n140\n00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.660\nthat was one of their goals, and so,\nthat was a goal on the sales team.\n\n141\n00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.270\nNow, you might turn around and say,\nokay, well, that's a strategy for\n\n142\n00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.040\nthe sales team,\nit's got nothing to do with us, yes,\n\n143\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.700\nit does because way other people have\nmanaged the transaction through.\n\n144\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.800\nSo, we're gonna have to deal with\nhigher volumes of transactions.\n\n145\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.130\nWe're going to deal with potentially more\nusers because we might be bringing in\n\n146\n00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.380\nmore people into the sales team.\n\n147\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.000\nWe'll certainly gonna have to deal with\na higher volume of data because if\n\n148\n00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.530\nwe're gonna have more customers,\n\n149\n00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.770\nthen that means more people in\nour CRN database, doesn't it?\n\n150\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.370\nMore entries there.\n\n151\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.480\nSo we're gonna have to support that, so\neven though we could turn around and\n\n152\n00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.760\nsay, well that strategy's\ngot nothing to do with us.\n\n153\n00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.680\nYes, it does,\ncuz we have to facilitate that.\n\n154\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.970\nAnd whether we're an internal service\nprovider inside the organization or\n\n155\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.580\nwhether we're an external\nservice provider,\n\n156\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.135\nwe still need to be a part of\nthe organization strategy.\n\n157\n00:09:38.135 --> 00:09:41.190\nCuz we can't facilitate\nthat if we don't know.\n\n158\n00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.530\nSo, in the same way an internal\nservice provider should be aware of\n\n159\n00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:52.350\nall of the strategies of the organization,\nso should the external service provider.\n\n160\n00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:57.000\nBecause if I'm managing services on\nyour behalf and you are my customer,\n\n161\n00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.530\nmy client, if you don't tell me that you\nare expecting an increase of traffic\n\n162\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.950\non the network.\n\n163\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.510\nThen I know going to ensure\nthat I have got enough\n\n164\n00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.630\nbandwidth to be able to accommodate that.\n\n165\n00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:13.830\nSo, I need to know whether I'm\ninternal server provider or external\n\n166\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:19.340\nservice provider and that can be a\nchallenge for an external service provider\n\n167\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.070\nbecause especially where an organization\ngot competitors the last things they want\n\n168\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:29.820\nto do Is actually tell a supplier what's\nin their pipeline, what they've got coming\n\n169\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.500\nout because then potentially competitors\ncould get ahold of that information, okay?\n\n170\n00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.210\nSo, we've gotta ensure that we have\ngot the trust with the organization\n\n171\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.620\nto be able to deliver that strategy.\n\n172\n00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.997\nNow, note that our\nService Strategy differs from\n\n173\n00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:51.089\nthe Service Management Strategy.\n\n174\n00:10:51.089 --> 00:10:56.104\nService Strategy is what we\nundertake to deliver services so\n\n175\n00:10:56.104 --> 00:11:01.021\nin other words a Service Strategy\nis all about what services\n\n176\n00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:05.450\nwe're going to deliver to the business.\n\n177\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.680\nSo, this management strategy is how\nwe're going to manage those services.\n\n178\n00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.700\nAs it says there, defining,\nimplementing and executing processes.\n\n179\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.940\nSo service management strategy\nis about the processes you\n\n180\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.860\nuse to manage the services\nwhereas the service strategy\n\n181\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.530\nis actually about defining\nthe services itself.\n\n182\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.900\nSo, what about then value to the business.\n\n183\n00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.170\nBecause we've got all of this strategies\nthat were talking about what would we\n\n184\n00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.250\nalready said, haven't we?\n\n185\n00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:41.485\nYou know, IT is a part of the business,\nIT is not isolated, IT is\n\n186\n00:11:41.485 --> 00:11:46.155\nnot just there in the corner and you know,\nwe just use IT if every now and then.\n\n187\n00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:48.725\nWe're an intricate part of the business.\n\n188\n00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:53.315\nSo, we have to make sure that we're\ninvolved in all decisions that\n\n189\n00:11:53.315 --> 00:11:54.155\nthe business make.\n\n190\n00:11:54.155 --> 00:11:59.110\nNow that can be a challenge, because the\nbusiness might want to tell us everything\n\n191\n00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.690\nespecially for\nyour external service provider.\n\n192\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.930\nBut we have to have an influence,\nlook at that example that I gave you,\n\n193\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.460\nis the organization want's\nto increase sales by 50%.\n\n194\n00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.160\nIf they don't tell us they\nare going to run into problems,\n\n195\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.850\nthey're going to run performance\nissues with perhaps the bandwidth.\n\n196\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.870\nThey're going to run into capacity issues\n\n197\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.070\nwith the data storage\nwithin the CRM database.\n\n198\n00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:30.590\nSo we have to be involved, because\nsometimes as well it's not just as easy\n\n199\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.680\nas ringing up a supplier and say, hey,\nlook, can you increase the bandwidth here.\n\n200\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.670\nI'll give you some more money, and\nmaybe that amount of bandwidth is just not\n\n201\n00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.680\npossible and what we need to do is\nactually increase the size of our network\n\n202\n00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.120\nand add in redundancy and add in more\nlines and split the traffic between\n\n203\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.910\nthe two infrastructures, the two networks,\nso we have to be involved.\n\n204\n00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.700\nWe really have to be involved.\n\n205\n00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.470\nAnd that can be a challenge\njustifying this to the organisation.\n\n206\n00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:05.230\nBut then I just justified it\nin a couple of sentences.\n\n207\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.970\nNow, obviously when it comes\nto business cases etc.\n\n208\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.960\nAnd when it comes to their relationship\nwith the business, you are far for\n\n209\n00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.680\nmore eloquent at what's going\non in your organization than\n\n210\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.000\nI can ever be because I don't\nknow your organization.\n\n211\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.540\nBut it I can justify it in a couple\nof sentences, then that's your role.\n\n212\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:28.530\nIn strategy management, that is your role,\nto justify why we need to be involved\n\n213\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:36.010\nbecause everyone needs to help us in\nsetting our direction for strategy.\n\n214\n00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.120\nAnd we need to help the business as well.\n\n215\n00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.679\nWe need to ensure that\nwe got as it says there\n\n216\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.190\noptimal use of resources and\ncapabilities on investments.\n\n217\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.580\nSo, we need to make sure that we\nknow what we've got and we know what\n\n218\n00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.920\nwe're capable of and that we're able\nto meet those needs of the business.\n\n219\n00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:03.040\nFor external service providers,\nwell, this is going to be.\n\n220\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.400\nUnderstanding an external client strategy.\n\n221\n00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.170\nThat's going to be call to\nour contract as it were.\n\n222\n00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:19.080\nIt's call to our sales,\nthat's part of why they chose us as\n\n223\n00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.810\nan external service provider because we\ncould help them deliver their strategy,\n\n224\n00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.010\nbut as I've already said,\nwe've still got to have that relationship.\n\n225\n00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:34.620\nNow sometimes, if you think\nabout the internal organization,\n\n226\n00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.800\nthe internal service provider or\norganization, then sometimes the internal\n\n227\n00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.840\nservice provider organization is kind of\nforgotten about because we don't have- any\n\n228\n00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.560\ncontract in place and so therefore\nthere's no physical money changing hands.\n\n229\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:56.180\nIt could be very easy for\nthe business just to decide on a strategy,\n\n230\n00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:02.410\nand then involve IT at a later date,\nbut again we still\n\n231\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:07.600\nhave to exert the same amount of\ninfluence on our organization.\n\n232\n00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.580\nBecause whether we are an external or\ninternal service provider,\n\n233\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.610\nif we have to increase capacity,\nit's going to cost money.\n\n234\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.170\nThe difference being,\n\n235\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:20.740\nis that if we have to increase capacity\nas an internal service provider,\n\n236\n00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:26.150\nwe are going to need more money from\na specific budget and therefore.\n\n237\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.656\nIt has to be part of the overall\nenterprise strategy within the entire\n\n238\n00:15:30.656 --> 00:15:31.753\norganization.\n\n239\n00:15:31.753 --> 00:15:36.474\nSo, let's take a look then at\nthe activities of the strategy\n\n240\n00:15:36.474 --> 00:15:38.240\nmanagement process.\n\n241\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.672\nYou'll see that we're actually\nsplitting to three, okay?\n\n242\n00:15:42.672 --> 00:15:46.729\nAnd in the first set of activities or\nthe first or\n\n243\n00:15:46.729 --> 00:15:51.814\nthe first group if you will,\nwe do a strategic assessment.\n\n244\n00:15:51.814 --> 00:15:56.184\nAnd a strategic assessment\nis where we will go out and\n\n245\n00:15:56.184 --> 00:15:58.965\nwe will analyze both internal and\n\n246\n00:15:58.965 --> 00:16:03.850\nexternal factors where we will\ndefine our market spaces.\n\n247\n00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.924\nAnd we looked at that\nin a previous section,\n\n248\n00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:10.676\nin a episode, and\nwhere we look at industry factors.\n\n249\n00:16:10.676 --> 00:16:14.796\nThat allows us to establish\nsome objectives for\n\n250\n00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:19.850\nsetting a strategy, so\nwhat about our internal factors?\n\n251\n00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.600\nWell, our internal factors are,\nlook at our skills,\n\n252\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.970\nthe skills of our organization, what\nare they actually physically capable of?\n\n253\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:33.750\nWhat type of functionality did they want,\nhow intuitive do they want their IT?\n\n254\n00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:38.776\nThese are our internal factors,\nhow hungry are they for new technology?\n\n255\n00:16:38.776 --> 00:16:42.618\nAnd the external factors are,\nwhat's happening in the outside world?\n\n256\n00:16:42.618 --> 00:16:45.066\nWhat about our competitors for instance,\n\n257\n00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:48.130\nwhat about technology\nin the outside world?\n\n258\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.080\nYou can't carry on using that cell\nphone from 10 years ago okay, so\n\n259\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.510\nthe external factors are such\nthat the world has moved on.\n\n260\n00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.320\nThe networks, the cell phone network\nwill not tolerate a phone from 10\n\n261\n00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.370\nyears ago any longer and so therefore,\nyes we will have to change.\n\n262\n00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.700\nAs I've already said in previous sessions,\n\n263\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.390\nWindows 95 is not gonna\nbe supported forever.\n\n264\n00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:15.450\nSo that allows us then to define our\nmarket spaces, and we've mentioned\n\n265\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.120\nthat in a previous episode, so\nI won't go over that too much now.\n\n266\n00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.945\nSuffice to say that defining\nmarket spaces means looking for\n\n267\n00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:28.030\nopportunities where we can\nprovide new services perhaps.\n\n268\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.410\nAnd then strategic industry factors,\nwell strategic industry factors are about,\n\n269\n00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.410\nwhat else is happening\nwithin our industry sector?\n\n270\n00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.400\nWhere is our sector moving to,\nhas our sector stagnated,\n\n271\n00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.280\nis it looking for someone?\n\n272\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.710\nAnd I'm talking about our\norganization sector here,\n\n273\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.220\nI'm not talking about our\nindustry sector as in IT.\n\n274\n00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.320\nI'm talking about the organization,\nso has the organization sector,\n\n275\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.580\nwell has it stagnated?\n\n276\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.930\nAre they looking for somebody to\ntake the reins and move forward,\n\n277\n00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:06.430\ndo they need somebody to lead the way or\nis the sector very, very aggressive?\n\n278\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.331\nAnd we've gotta be highly competitive,\nand that allows us then to\n\n279\n00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:15.810\ndefine our objectives and\nour objectives for our strategy.\n\n280\n00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.843\nAnd then we have the strategy generation\nitself then, and strategy generation,\n\n281\n00:18:21.843 --> 00:18:25.991\nwell this is where we come up with\na strategy, look at our four P's, okay.\n\n282\n00:18:25.991 --> 00:18:31.581\nOur 4 P's are our perspective, our\nperspective for not just the organization,\n\n283\n00:18:31.581 --> 00:18:35.930\nbut the perspective that brings\nthe organization into IT.\n\n284\n00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.600\nSo our organization's perspective, well we\nhave to make sure we're relating to that.\n\n285\n00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.473\nIf they're looking to grow the business,\nwe can't be running our IT organization,\n\n286\n00:18:45.473 --> 00:18:47.173\nwe've gotta be growing too.\n\n287\n00:18:47.173 --> 00:18:52.484\nAnd then we have to understand our\nposition, and we craft a plan that will\n\n288\n00:18:52.484 --> 00:18:57.640\nhelp us achieve our perspective,\nand we adopt patterns of behavior.\n\n289\n00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.220\nAnd of course that again,\n\n290\n00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.400\nis something that we do hand\nin hand with the organization.\n\n291\n00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.450\nAnd this is where then once we have this,\nwe document the service strategy,\n\n292\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:14.680\nand the service strategy,\nwe've got processes underneath that.\n\n293\n00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.132\nIt's documented and\ncalculated with all of these\n\n294\n00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:23.797\nprocesses in mind,\nincluding any requirements for\n\n295\n00:19:23.797 --> 00:19:29.321\nany functionality as well,\nthat has to be incorporated too.\n\n296\n00:19:29.321 --> 00:19:33.939\nAnd then, well, once we've got a strategy,\nwe have to execute it, and\n\n297\n00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:38.123\nwe execute the strategy through\na service management strategy.\n\n298\n00:19:38.123 --> 00:19:41.936\nWe also execute through a service\nstrategy, in other words,\n\n299\n00:19:41.936 --> 00:19:44.050\nwhat new services do we need?\n\n300\n00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.148\nBut we have to make sure that we are\naligned with the outcomes of the business\n\n301\n00:19:48.148 --> 00:19:49.268\nwe want to achieve.\n\n302\n00:19:49.268 --> 00:19:53.441\nBut that we're also aligned with\nthe business skills as well,\n\n303\n00:19:53.441 --> 00:19:57.074\nand then the strategy aligns\nourself with our skills.\n\n304\n00:19:57.074 --> 00:20:01.324\nSo if we need to incorporate new skills,\nthen we need to learn them,\n\n305\n00:20:01.324 --> 00:20:03.947\nthat's part of the strategy execution.\n\n306\n00:20:03.947 --> 00:20:07.572\nAnd if we are deploying something\ninto the organization and\n\n307\n00:20:07.572 --> 00:20:11.065\nthey will need to learn new skills or\nnew ways of working.\n\n308\n00:20:11.065 --> 00:20:14.794\nThen again,\nthat's part of the strategy execution,\n\n309\n00:20:14.794 --> 00:20:18.127\nit says optimize our\ncritical success factors.\n\n310\n00:20:18.127 --> 00:20:22.388\nIn other words we achieve those\ncritical success factors for\n\n311\n00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:26.487\nthe strategy, in other words,\nwe achieve our strategy.\n\n312\n00:20:26.487 --> 00:20:30.665\nAnd of course prioritization of\ninvestments, well that's really important\n\n313\n00:20:30.665 --> 00:20:34.154\nbecause we don't have an endless\npot of money, all right [LAUGH].\n\n314\n00:20:34.154 --> 00:20:37.548\nWe've got a very limited\nsum of money generally, and\n\n315\n00:20:37.548 --> 00:20:41.406\nwe have to prioritize,\nwhat are we going to invest in first?\n\n316\n00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:44.498\nNow notice that CSI has some\ninput into this as well,\n\n317\n00:20:44.498 --> 00:20:46.552\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n318\n00:20:46.552 --> 00:20:51.299\nWell that arrow goes back, and it goes\nback into the strategic assessment and\n\n319\n00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:54.672\nthe strategy generation and\nthe strategy execution.\n\n320\n00:20:54.672 --> 00:21:00.677\nBecause CSI is always looking for\nways to improve, it is always looking for\n\n321\n00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:06.796\nways to ensure that we completely aligned\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n322\n00:21:06.796 --> 00:21:11.774\nNow the one thing that I have not\nmentioned out of this are the dotted lines\n\n323\n00:21:11.774 --> 00:21:13.335\nright to the very top.\n\n324\n00:21:13.335 --> 00:21:16.375\nThese are our feedback lines, okay,\n\n325\n00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:21.220\nthese are our lessons learned,\nso from every single stage,\n\n326\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.788\nwe have the ability to feed\nback into the previous stage.\n\n327\n00:21:25.788 --> 00:21:29.866\nSo in strategy generation, we'd feed\nback into the assessment, and we'd say,\n\n328\n00:21:29.866 --> 00:21:31.772\nyour assessment was a little bit off.\n\n329\n00:21:31.772 --> 00:21:34.717\nBecause now I've taken a look\nat our perspective, and\n\n330\n00:21:34.717 --> 00:21:37.352\nwhilst you've analyzed\nthe external factors.\n\n331\n00:21:37.352 --> 00:21:42.225\nAnd the external factors were\nsuch that the industry is fairly\n\n332\n00:21:42.225 --> 00:21:47.110\nstagnated at the moment and\nthey need somebody to drive this.\n\n333\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.030\nThe perspective of completely transforming\nthe business if not really one that's\n\n334\n00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.213\ngoing to work right now.\n\n335\n00:21:52.213 --> 00:21:56.018\nSo we're going to look more at growth\nwithin our sector first of all,\n\n336\n00:21:56.018 --> 00:22:00.487\nbecause we believe there are market\nspaces there that you haven't identified.\n\n337\n00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:05.196\nSo with every single\nstage we are able to feed\n\n338\n00:22:05.196 --> 00:22:09.660\nback into the previous, so as this says.\n\n339\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.335\nThe diagram on the last page that\nwe looked at just shows the process\n\n340\n00:22:14.335 --> 00:22:17.098\nactivities for strategy management.\n\n341\n00:22:17.098 --> 00:22:22.176\nSo this assessment is about our current\nsituation, the generation is about\n\n342\n00:22:22.176 --> 00:22:27.827\ngenerating the strategy and the execution\nis simply about executing the strategy.\n\n343\n00:22:27.827 --> 00:22:31.768\nAnd then of course we\nevaluate as part of CSI,\n\n344\n00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:37.905\nthat our strategy is always aligned\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n345\n00:22:37.905 --> 00:22:42.420\nNow at this point in time, and Ronnie\nmentioned a little while ago that this is\n\n346\n00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.142\nprobably going to be\nsplit into two episodes.\n\n347\n00:22:45.142 --> 00:22:48.505\nAnd you're right it is because\nat this point in time,\n\n348\n00:22:48.505 --> 00:22:51.507\nyou have an exercise as\npart of your materials.\n\n349\n00:22:51.507 --> 00:22:55.783\nAnd you have an exercise on\nstrategy management for IT and\n\n350\n00:22:55.783 --> 00:23:01.944\ngiven a specific case study, you're going\nto be asked to come up with a strategy.\n\n351\n00:23:01.944 --> 00:23:07.370\nAnd that's a strategy for services and\nalso a strategy for service management.\n\n352\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:12.034\nSo a strategy for services is about\nidentifying market spaces and looking for\n\n353\n00:23:12.034 --> 00:23:12.760\nservices.\n\n354\n00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.680\nTo fill those market spaces but\nalso the strategy for\n\n355\n00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.361\nservice management is looking at.\n\n356\n00:23:19.361 --> 00:23:24.739\nWhat processes we need to fulfill\nthose services to deliver\n\n357\n00:23:24.739 --> 00:23:29.373\nthe services that facilitate\nbusiness outcomes.\n\n358\n00:23:29.373 --> 00:23:32.117\nNow as always, I'm available,\n\n359\n00:23:32.117 --> 00:23:37.611\nwe have our forum if you have any queries,\nthen please let us know.\n\n360\n00:23:37.611 --> 00:23:42.531\nAnd I'll be happy to help you with any\nquestions that you may have, but for now,\n\n361\n00:23:42.531 --> 00:23:46.073\nI'd like you to take at least\nan hour to an hour and a half.\n\n362\n00:23:46.073 --> 00:23:50.509\nSo 60 to 90 minutes to take a look\nat that particular case study and\n\n363\n00:23:50.509 --> 00:23:52.046\nthat exercise, okay?\n\n364\n00:23:52.046 --> 00:23:55.734\nAnd I'd really like you to do that\nin-depth just to get to understand\n\n365\n00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:57.012\nstrategy management.\n\n366\n00:23:57.012 --> 00:24:00.697\nAnd when we come back in the next episode,\nthen we'll carry on and\n\n367\n00:24:00.697 --> 00:24:02.774\njust take a further in-depth look.\n\n368\n00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:05.207\nAt exactly what you did\nin your exercise and\n\n369\n00:24:05.207 --> 00:24:07.928\nhow we move forward with\nstrategy management.\n\n370\n00:24:07.928 --> 00:24:12.446\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us to understand a little bit more\n\n371\n00:24:12.446 --> 00:24:16.709\nabout this process of strategy management\nand getting through it as well.\n\n372\n00:24:16.709 --> 00:24:18.799\nRemember what we took a look at here,\nright,\n\n373\n00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:22.432\na little bit at the beginning of taking\na look at the assessment of where we are.\n\n374\n00:24:22.432 --> 00:24:26.821\nAnd then of course, the strategy\ngeneration as well as its execution,\n\n375\n00:24:26.821 --> 00:24:29.248\nbut we don't finish with that as well.\n\n376\n00:24:29.248 --> 00:24:33.183\nWe actually do have to go back and\nadd in some evaluation and some testing,\n\n377\n00:24:33.183 --> 00:24:36.682\nmake sure everything is actually\ndone the way that it needs to be.\n\n378\n00:24:36.682 --> 00:24:40.310\nAlso take a look at that, make sure\nthat all that stuff is in your head and\n\n379\n00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.690\nthat you're ready to move\nforward before moving forward.\n\n380\n00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.670\nThat's a great place for us to end\nthis episode then, signing off for\n\n381\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.870\nITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n382\n00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.130\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n383\n00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.528\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for

00:00:08.384\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:12.196\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT PRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:14.640\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here on ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.683\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy Show,\n\n7\n00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.453\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:27.110\nAnd today we're diving into a part two\non Strategy Management for IT Services.\n\n9\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.570\nAnd here to help us is going to be our,\nlet's say,\n\n10\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.045\nITIL Duchess herself again, Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:35.210\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.708\n&gt;&gt; Thanks very much for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:40.364\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, there's a lot for\nus to actually think about after we\n\n14\n00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:44.655\ntalked a little bit about the process in\ngetting the service strategy started and\n\n15\n00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:46.123\neverything we're doing.\n\n16\n00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:47.472\nSo where are we picking up today?\n\n17\n00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:52.576\n&gt;&gt; In this episode where we left off\nthe last episode I asked everybody to\n\n18\n00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:59.070\ngo away and to look at an exercise based\non the strategy management process itself.\n\n19\n00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.610\nWhich involved as you see on\nthe screen there just as a refresher,\n\n20\n00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.000\nthe strategic assessment, stresses\ngeneration and strategy execution as well.\n\n21\n00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.700\nAnd so now what we're going\nto do is we're going to\n\n22\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.810\npick up here by looking at\ninputs into service strategy.\n\n23\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.650\nSo what actually starts\noff service strategy?\n\n24\n00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.120\nWhat starts off our\nstrategy management itself?\n\n25\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.240\nNow I looked or I mentioned when we talked\nat the beginning of the last session.\n\n26\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.020\nI mentioned the fact that we should\nbe reviewing our strategies at\n\n27\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810\nleast once a year.\n\n28\n00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.600\nAnd we've got up here on our\nscreen an annual planning cycle.\n\n29\n00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.060\nThere's an assumption there that,\nas an organization,\n\n30\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.600\nyou will look and review your\nstrategies at least once a year.\n\n31\n00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.990\nAnd you'll make plans for\nthe future at least once a year.\n\n32\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.940\nNow, just because it says an annual\nplanning cycle doesn't mean it\n\n33\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.940\nhas to happen at every year.\n\n34\n00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.040\nIt could happen every six months.\n\n35\n00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.000\nBut it has to be at least annually,\nat least once a year.\n\n36\n00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.950\nIf it's not at minimum every year,\nthen your organization is going to\n\n37\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.830\nstart to fall back in terms\nof competitive advantage.\n\n38\n00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.760\nSo we will tell you at least once a year\nyou should be reviewing your strategies.\n\n39\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.680\nNow other changes to strategies\ncome along because of\n\n40\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.810\nmaybe new business opportunities,\nsuch as mergers and acquisitions.\n\n41\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.750\nThat's a new business opportunity.\n\n42\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.900\nOr maybe the business has identified\na market space themselves and\n\n43\n00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.480\nthey want to move into that market space.\n\n44\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.120\nIf you're in an organization that\nis continually transforming.\n\n45\n00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.120\nAnd then of course new opportunities\nare coming along on a regular basis.\n\n46\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.020\nSo we have to, in IT, we have to be able\nto adapt to that on a regular basis.\n\n47\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.060\nQuite frequently in some organizations.\n\n48\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.630\nAnd then of course we've got changes\nto internal or external environments.\n\n49\n00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.680\nYou know, let's not belittle,\n\n50\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.880\nlet's not put down the fact that\nsometimes we move buildings.\n\n51\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.610\nSometimes we might expand and\nwe might move or open another location.\n\n52\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.080\nSometimes we might close locations.\n\n53\n00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.670\nInternal and external environments are the\nthings that happen within or outside of\n\n54\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.000\nan organization that are not part of\nnecessarily the business strategy, itself.\n\n55\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.980\nBut are something that we do\nkind of on the side, really.\n\n56\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.230\nSo as I say, things like opening up\na new location, maybe we reorganize cuz\n\n57\n00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.505\nwe're looking to make efficiency savings,\nand we're looking for effectiveness.\n\n58\n00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:36.030\nAnd maybe we want to make better\nuse of our skills elsewhere.\n\n59\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.250\nThese are all internal and\n\n60\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.410\nexternal factors that will\ninfluence our strategies.\n\n61\n00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.920\nSo when we define [INAUDIBLE] strategy for\n\n62\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.250\nboth a new service and for\nmanagement of our services as well, and\n\n63\n00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.920\nstrategy management,\nwhat kind of inputs do we need?\n\n64\n00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.630\nWell, we need to think about our plans,\nboth our existing plans and our new plans.\n\n65\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.400\nWhat about what's happening in the outside\nworld, and these are our research reports.\n\n66\n00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.050\nWhat's happening in the industry sector\nitself and where do we need to be?\n\n67\n00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.700\nAnd that's part of our perspective and\nour position and our plans.\n\n68\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.210\nWhat's happening outside?\n\n69\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.550\nLet's not dismiss our suppliers.\n\n70\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.160\nOur suppliers don't always\ndo what we want them to do.\n\n71\n00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.810\nEspecially the large suppliers.\n\n72\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.670\nAnd I mentioned in previous episodes,\n\n73\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.680\nI said Windows 95 is not going\nto be supported forever.\n\n74\n00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.470\nAnd it's quite possible\nthat at some point in time,\n\n75\n00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.580\na supplier like Microsoft is gonna come\nalong and say hey look, do you know what?\n\n76\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.500\nWe're not supporting that particular\noperating system anymore.\n\n77\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.470\nOr maybe a hardware supplier\nis coming along and saying\n\n78\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.220\nthat model of laptop that you've given to\neverybody, we don't produce that anymore.\n\n79\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.160\nSo vendor strategies, supplier strategies,\n\n80\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.330\nand their product roadmaps\nwill have an influence on us.\n\n81\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.640\nIt's not very often that we\nhave an influence on them.\n\n82\n00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.460\nIt's very, very difficult to turn\naround to a hardware manufacturer and\n\n83\n00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.430\nsay, well you know what,\nI really like that model of laptop, so\n\n84\n00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.720\nI want you to continue making it for\nthe next ten years.\n\n85\n00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.930\nThat's not going to happen.\n\n86\n00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.540\nSo, we've got to be aware\nthat our suppliers will\n\n87\n00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.160\ninfluence our direction too.\n\n88\n00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.980\nWhether we like that or not and\nthen what about customer interviews.\n\n89\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.660\nIn a previous session within service\nstrategy I mentioned the fact\n\n90\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.060\nthat when I'm going in and I'm assessing\nan organization for strategic direction,\n\n91\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.200\nand I want to assess a service\nprovider for strategic direction.\n\n92\n00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.380\nI will go back to all of our individuals\nwithin our service provider.\n\n93\n00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.230\nAnd when was the last time you went and\nsat with the organization?\n\n94\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.410\nWhen was the last time you\nunderstood the organization?\n\n95\n00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.940\nI will also go and I will sit with\nthe executives in an organization and\n\n96\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.770\nask them what their\nstrategic direction is.\n\n97\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.470\nAnd then I'll come back to IT and I'll ask\n\n98\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.830\nthe board within IT the student group\nwithin IT what the executive direction is.\n\n99\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.160\nYou'll be surprised how frequently\n\n100\n00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.580\nwhen I'm doing the strategic\nassessment I get two different answers.\n\n101\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.000\nBecause the executive board and the\norganization are going in one direction\n\n102\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.450\nbut IT think we're going\nin another direction.\n\n103\n00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.870\nAnd so\nwe do what we call customer interviews.\n\n104\n00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.395\nBusiness relationship management will help\nus with this, but interviews not just with\n\n105\n00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:36.380\nthe customers as in a business unit heads\nbut also with the executive board as well.\n\n106\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.460\nWe have to make sure that\nwe're continually aligned and\n\n107\n00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.310\nas well business relationship management\nwe've got continuous service improvement\n\n108\n00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.280\nas well that they will help us with this.\n\n109\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.890\nSo we take the strategic plans\nnot just from the business but\n\n110\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.090\nalso from IT as well.\n\n111\n00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.960\nWhat our existing plans were we\nmight actually need to change them.\n\n112\n00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.410\nBecause those plans that we were\nheading towards six months ago,\n\n113\n00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.740\nthey might not be right anymore.\n\n114\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.860\nThey might not be relevant anymore.\n\n115\n00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.940\nWe'll also take into consideration\nwhat's in our service portfolio.\n\n116\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.570\nOr more importantly,\nwhat's in our pipeline.\n\n117\n00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.650\nSo what's in our pipeline?\n\n118\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.870\nThese are our new ideas for services.\n\n119\n00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.050\nAre they relevant?\n\n120\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.330\nAre they what our customers need?\n\n121\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.720\nAnd also, what's in our catalogue right\nnow, that's part of our portfolio?\n\n122\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.740\nAnd does that need to be retired,\nis it still relevant.\n\n123\n00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.758\nWe have to ask that question.\n\n124\n00:07:30.758 --> 00:07:35.350\nAnd then audit reports, now whether\nyou're auditing against Corbet or\n\n125\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.790\nwhether you're auditing against\nsomething like ISO 20000 or ISO 27002.\n\n126\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.049\nWe'll still take those audit reports and\nwe will take the,\n\n127\n00:07:44.049 --> 00:07:46.265\nI don't like to call them failures, but\n\n128\n00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:50.892\nlet's just say the areas where we're not\nquite meeting the standard and we'll take\n\n129\n00:07:50.892 --> 00:07:55.090\nthose and we'll say, okay, that's got\nto be part of our strategy as well.\n\n130\n00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.272\nIf you want to achieve ISO 20000,\n\n131\n00:07:57.272 --> 00:08:01.782\nthen you can't do that if you've got\na particular area that needs improvement.\n\n132\n00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:06.566\nSo you have to make that improvement So\nwhat comes out of strategy management\n\n133\n00:08:06.566 --> 00:08:10.640\nthen are our plans, our strategic and\nour tactical plans.\n\n134\n00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.131\nAlso what comes out of our schedules,\nhow often we review our strategy.\n\n135\n00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:20.002\nOurs tell you at least once a year but\nmaybe that's not frequent enough.\n\n136\n00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:24.057\nFor an organization that's rapidly\ngrowing, or an organization that's\n\n137\n00:08:24.057 --> 00:08:28.495\ntransforming, I would challenge you that\nonce a year is definitely not enough and\n\n138\n00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:31.730\nthat we should be looking at\nthat at least every six months.\n\n139\n00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.820\nWhat about our vision and\nour mission statements?\n\n140\n00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.040\nThe vision statement where do we want\nto be, and the mission statement,\n\n141\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.980\nhow are we going to get there,\nwhat about those?\n\n142\n00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.369\nIf your mission statement incorporates\nthe words by being open and collaborative,\n\n143\n00:08:47.369 --> 00:08:51.410\nthen we have to make sure that our\nstrategies are open and collaborative too.\n\n144\n00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.890\nAnd we quite often in an organization will\ncombine our vision and mission statements.\n\n145\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.940\nSo they will say something\nalong the lines of,\n\n146\n00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.400\nto become world leaders in our field\nby being open and collaborative,\n\n147\n00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.810\nthat's our vision and our mission,\nhow we're going to get there as well.\n\n148\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.820\nWell, that has to feature in absolutely\nevery element of our strategy too.\n\n149\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.780\nBecause that's not just the vision for\nthe organization, that's a vision for us.\n\n150\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:23.600\nEven as an external provider, then an\nexternal service provider has to align to\n\n151\n00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.420\nthe needs of their customer's organization\nand to their customer's vision.\n\n152\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:33.200\nAnd if an external provider is\nvery focused on security and\n\n153\n00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.510\ndeals in areas of high security, but\nthey have a client whose vision is to be\n\n154\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:44.520\nopen and collaborative,\nthen that external service provider\n\n155\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.900\nwill need to consider how they're going to\nachieve the open and collaborative nature.\n\n156\n00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.130\nGiven that they concentrate\nvery much on security, and\n\n157\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.250\nthey have the data of other clients that\nthey have to be very concerned about.\n\n158\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.040\nSo all of our policies as well,\nhow we're going to govern within IT,\n\n159\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.820\nthat comes out of service strategy.\n\n160\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.880\nAs well as any requirements\nfrom any new services as well.\n\n161\n00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.360\nSo here in this particular slide,\n\n162\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.310\nwe look at the interfaces\nbetween all of our processes.\n\n163\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.730\nNow, there's absolutely no process\nthat is not affected by strategy,\n\n164\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.850\nbecause strategy tells us\nhow we are going to govern.\n\n165\n00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.640\nStrategy also tells us our vision and\nour mission, and\n\n166\n00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.270\nour vision is what our organization,\nand therefore us within IT,\n\n167\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.230\nwant to achieve and\nwhat we will facilitate.\n\n168\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.078\nSo service portfolio management,\n\n169\n00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:45.792\nI've already mentioned\nservice portfolio management.\n\n170\n00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:49.796\nAbout making sure we've got\nthe right ideas in our pipeline,\n\n171\n00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:53.415\nand always evaluating these\nservices in our catalog for\n\n172\n00:10:53.415 --> 00:10:59.010\nrelevance against the business vision,\nand mission, and objectives.\n\n173\n00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.530\nFinancial management will tell us\nhow much money we've got to spend.\n\n174\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.830\nRemember financial management\nis split into a, b, c and\n\n175\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:11.260\nwe'll take a look at financial management\nin another episode in service strategy.\n\n176\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.250\nA, b, c, well, I like to start with b,\njust cuz I'm different.\n\n177\n00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:20.960\nBudgeting is how much money have we got to\nspend, accounting is how have we spent it,\n\n178\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.180\nand then charging, well that's optional,\ndo we cross charge our customers?\n\n179\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.510\nNow financial management\nis going to set our budget,\n\n180\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.970\nit's gonna tell us how much money we've\ngot to spend to realize that strategy.\n\n181\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.680\nAnd then knowledge management,\nwell knowledge management is a,\n\n182\n00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.550\ntake a look in service\ntransition life cycle phase,\n\n183\n00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.510\nwhich is where you'll find\nthe knowledge management process.\n\n184\n00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.250\nKnowledge management will monitor and\n\n185\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.450\nmanage the relationships between\nall of our data sources.\n\n186\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.670\nMaking sure that we have the data,\nand therefore with the relationships,\n\n187\n00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.400\nthe information available so\nthat we can make informed decisions.\n\n188\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.160\nKnowledge management has a huge part to\nplay in strategy because without any of\n\n189\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.110\nthat data, without any of the information\navailable at our fingertips,\n\n190\n00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.610\nhow can we make an informed decision based\n\n191\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:17.710\non what strategy we're going for,\nor what direction we're going in.\n\n192\n00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.660\nSo knowledge management helps us\ngovern and helps us define strategies.\n\n193\n00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.160\nAnd of course our strategies, well,\n\n194\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.560\nthey tell us not only what services\nwe're going to provide in the future for\n\n195\n00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.350\nour organization, but they also\ntell us how we're going to govern.\n\n196\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.880\nHow we're going to manage service design.\n\n197\n00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.272\nWhat the service design\npackage will look like.\n\n198\n00:12:40.272 --> 00:12:44.783\nHow we're going to transition from\nservice design into transition.\n\n199\n00:12:44.783 --> 00:12:48.230\nHow we hand over that\nservice design package.\n\n200\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.575\nAnd then how we manage changes,\nhow we govern releases.\n\n201\n00:12:52.575 --> 00:12:56.565\nAnd also how we release into\nthe live environment and\n\n202\n00:12:56.565 --> 00:12:59.117\nwhat time period early\nlive support should be.\n\n203\n00:12:59.117 --> 00:13:03.720\nAnd at what point in time are our\nservice level agreements signed and\n\n204\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.475\nthen handed over to service operation.\n\n205\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.510\nAnd then how service operation is run.\n\n206\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.981\nOur governance policies\nare set by service strategy,\n\n207\n00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:17.110\nbecause this is where\nwe define our vision.\n\n208\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.240\nAnd of course CSI wants to ensure\nthat we're continually aligned\n\n209\n00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.480\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n210\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.880\nSo that our strategy is always aligned\nto the vision of the organization so\n\n211\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.170\nthat we always have\nthe right strategy here.\n\n212\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.612\nSo what about CSF's then?\n\n213\n00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:37.974\nCSF is critical success factor,\nit's something that we have to achieve.\n\n214\n00:13:37.974 --> 00:13:43.977\nAnd in ITIL we'll tell you that you should\nhave a CSF for absolutely every process,\n\n215\n00:13:43.977 --> 00:13:49.310\nwe should have a set of CSFs,\nwhat this process needs to achieve.\n\n216\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:55.117\nAnd we'll have KPIs, key performance\nindicators underpinning the CSFs.\n\n217\n00:13:55.117 --> 00:14:00.520\nAnd we should have at least\ntwo to three KPIs per CSF.\n\n218\n00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.320\nAnd these CSFs will tell us whether we\nare meeting the needs of that process.\n\n219\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.191\nAnd on the next couple of slides\nyou've got some examples of some CSFs.\n\n220\n00:14:10.191 --> 00:14:12.174\nAnd the KPIs if we achieve them,\n\n221\n00:14:12.174 --> 00:14:17.450\nwell that will tell us whether we're\nmeeting those critical success factors.\n\n222\n00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.650\nSo what we've got here\nare just some examples.\n\n223\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:26.145\nThese are the examples that come out\nof the ITIL publications, but these\n\n224\n00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:32.471\nare just examples of what we might want to\nachieve in service strategy management.\n\n225\n00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:35.990\nNow, you will define your own\ncritical success factors.\n\n226\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:43.810\nBecause only you know what strategy\nmanagement variety will look like for\n\n227\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:49.270\nyou, because only you know what\nyour organization wants to achieve.\n\n228\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.230\nAnd that doesn't matter whether you're\nan internal service provider or\n\n229\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.530\nan external service provider.\n\n230\n00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.372\nSo let's take a look at these CSFs then,\nand these are just examples.\n\n231\n00:14:59.372 --> 00:15:03.881\nAnd in these examples we've got a CSF,\nsomething that we have to achieve about\n\n232\n00:15:03.881 --> 00:15:09.150\naccess to structured information about\nthe environments of the service provider.\n\n233\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.540\nSo KPIs could be that every\nmarket space is supported, or\n\n234\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.110\nthat recommendations and findings\nare based on validated information.\n\n235\n00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.070\nAnd we'll get that from, say,\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n236\n00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.970\nThat external research\nis found to be accurate.\n\n237\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.930\nSometimes that can be\na difficult one to achieve.\n\n238\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:33.526\nBut again, as I've said you will set\nthe KPIs, you will set your CSFs.\n\n239\n00:15:33.526 --> 00:15:37.032\nBut your KPIs are set\ndependent on what your CSF is.\n\n240\n00:15:37.032 --> 00:15:42.680\nSo your KPIs must demonstrate\nthat you are achieving your CSF.\n\n241\n00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.730\nSo your CSF, for instance, might be\nan ability to identify constraints.\n\n242\n00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.370\nThat one can be a difficult\none to measure as well.\n\n243\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.612\nAnd we've got an example of a KPI\nthere about a number of corrective\n\n244\n00:15:54.612 --> 00:15:57.131\nactions taken to remove constraints.\n\n245\n00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:03.209\nYour CSF could be that we've got a clear\nunderstanding of our perspective.\n\n246\n00:16:03.209 --> 00:16:07.790\nWell KPIs could be defined region\nstatements and mission statements,\n\n247\n00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.531\nit could be training needs analysis and\ntraining needs for\n\n248\n00:16:11.531 --> 00:16:14.220\nstaff and it could be defined plans also.\n\n249\n00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.170\nWhat about the CFF where\nthe service provider,\n\n250\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.119\nthat's us,\nunderstands our own competitive position.\n\n251\n00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.700\nWe have to accept and we mentioned\nthis very, very early on in one of\n\n252\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.710\nour first episodes within service\nstrategy, that we have competition.\n\n253\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.520\nAnd it doesn't matter in what industry\nsector we're in, that there's always\n\n254\n00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.880\nsomebody knocking on the door of our\nCEO of an organization offering to do\n\n255\n00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:46.550\nour job for less money and to a higher\nquality and we have to accept that.\n\n256\n00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:52.300\nSo we have to always, part of our\nstrategy, measure ourselves against\n\n257\n00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.440\nour competitors and ensure that we\nare delivering a competitive advantage.\n\n258\n00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.900\nAnd that we demonstrate that we're\ndelivering that competitive advantage that\n\n259\n00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:07.110\nwe have a USP that we can\ngive to our business.\n\n260\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.360\nSo that means that we've gotta\nkeep our eye on the ball.\n\n261\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.629\nWe've got to watch what's\ngoing on outside, and\n\n262\n00:17:14.629 --> 00:17:21.490\nwe've got to make sure that we understand\nwhat our competitors are doing.\n\n263\n00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.050\nSo look at the KPI's that we've got here.\n\n264\n00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.610\nA number of business deals secured.\n\n265\n00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:29.300\nNow you could try and compare that against\nthe number of business deals that your\n\n266\n00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.240\ncompetitors have secured but\nthen that would\n\n267\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.380\nthen would only work if you're\nan external service provider, right?\n\n268\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.630\nIt wouldn't work if you're\nan internal service provider.\n\n269\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:43.670\nBut we want to make sure that all of\nour services deliver or facilitate\n\n270\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:49.290\nthe outcomes that the business want to\nachieve and that they deliver value.\n\n271\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.750\nSo that means measuring customer\nsatisfaction, for instance.\n\n272\n00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.214\nNow, I don't see that\nup there as a KPI but\n\n273\n00:17:56.214 --> 00:18:00.439\nI would certainly put that up there\nbecause if our customers are happy,\n\n274\n00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:04.894\nthen we're meeting their needs and\nthey're less likely to go elsewhere.\n\n275\n00:18:04.894 --> 00:18:09.704\nSo look at our next page, and\nour next page again, more examples of CSFs\n\n276\n00:18:09.704 --> 00:18:14.436\nabout maintaining communication\nstrategy documents and KPIs such as\n\n277\n00:18:14.436 --> 00:18:19.581\nmaking sure stakeholders are aware and\nthat we've got change management.\n\n278\n00:18:19.581 --> 00:18:21.062\nIn other words, version control and\n\n279\n00:18:21.062 --> 00:18:23.320\nknowledge management applied\nto all of our documents.\n\n280\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.005\nWhat about that CSF, and\nthis one could be a challenge to measure,\n\n281\n00:18:28.005 --> 00:18:32.500\ntranslating strategic plans into\ntactical and operational plans.\n\n282\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.070\nSo we've got this nice high\nlevel strategic plan and\n\n283\n00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.450\nnow what we need to do is make sure that\nwe've actually actually got strategic,\n\n284\n00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.990\ntactical and\noperational objectives underneath that.\n\n285\n00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:50.080\nThe best version of this particular\nCSF that I have ever seen\n\n286\n00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.410\nis one where we simply have\na tree where every single CSF\n\n287\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.490\nis outlined and then underneath\nthat we have individual objectives.\n\n288\n00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.490\nAnd then underneath the individual\nobjectives for each team,\n\n289\n00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:08.670\nwe've got individual objectives for\neach process or individual objectives for\n\n290\n00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.480\neach particular member of staff within\nthe team, each particular analyst.\n\n291\n00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.870\nSo that actually when we're talking about\ntranslating the strategic plans into\n\n292\n00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:23.340\nthe operational plans,\nif we have strategic plan one then\n\n293\n00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.260\nthe next objective\nunderneath is objective 1A,\n\n294\n00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.420\nand the objective under that\nis Objective 1A1 for instance.\n\n295\n00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.210\nWe can do that, and\nthat's the best I have seen\n\n296\n00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:39.070\nof a KPI that will allow\nus to demonstrate that.\n\n297\n00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.850\nAnd think about internal and\nexternal environmental changes,\n\n298\n00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:49.670\nnow I've already mentioned those things\nlike changes in offices, changes in,\n\n299\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:54.260\nsay, hierarchies, for instance,\nchanges in organizational charts.\n\n300\n00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.320\nWe've got to make sure that that appears\nin all of our strategy documents.\n\n301\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.540\nSo I'm looking at KPI,\nI'm looking for the number of\n\n302\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:09.880\nchanges that have been recorded that\nare purely to do with external factors,\n\n303\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.450\nfactors that we have no influence in.\n\n304\n00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:19.745\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, I have a question about\nthis as I start to look all these CF.\n\n305\n00:20:19.745 --> 00:20:22.435\nCSF, which I'm not gonna be\nable to pronounce and say.\n\n306\n00:20:22.435 --> 00:20:25.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I started to think about the number\n\n307\n00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.940\nof CSFs that we're looking at\nunder strategy management.\n\n308\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.490\nIs there going to be at some\npoint where we have spent so\n\n309\n00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:41.280\nmuch time trying to determine the CSF's\nthat is kind of overwhelming.\n\n310\n00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.000\nIn other words,\ncan we have too many of them\n\n311\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.190\nthat we never can really\nget all of them done?\n\n312\n00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.530\nDoes that make sense?\n\n313\n00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.310\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n314\n00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:56.200\n&gt;&gt; And as I have said, these are examples\nof CSF's that you could have.\n\n315\n00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.260\nI will always tell you, and one of the\nprinciples of IT is always keep it simple.\n\n316\n00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.230\nStart off simple, start off small,\nand think about scalability.\n\n317\n00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.130\nThe smaller the organization,\nthe less mature and\n\n318\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.600\nthe less well-developed\nstrategy management will be.\n\n319\n00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:17.080\nNow, we want strategy management to become\nvery well-developed for the organization.\n\n320\n00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.090\nBut we have to understand that if it's a\nsmall organization then you probably don't\n\n321\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.230\nneed 30 different CSF's, okay?\n\n322\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.540\nBecause you're gonna become\nvery overwhelmed by this.\n\n323\n00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.880\nSo think about the scalability\nof the organization.\n\n324\n00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.800\nFor a very large organization,\nlet's say an international organization,\n\n325\n00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.790\ninternational pharmaceutical company for\n\n326\n00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:41.800\ninstance, well they'll\nbe spanning the globe.\n\n327\n00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.990\nThey'll have maybe over\na million employees.\n\n328\n00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:49.930\nAnd I would expect them to have not just\none person performing strategy management,\n\n329\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.810\nbut to have a team of strategy managers.\n\n330\n00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:57.120\nIn which case, they will have potentially\nhundreds of critical success factors.\n\n331\n00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.110\nThink about scalability.\n\n332\n00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:05.340\nAnd we really, really, really do advocate\nkeeping it simple and starting off small.\n\n333\n00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:10.260\nWe like to, when we talk about\ncontinual service improvement and\n\n334\n00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.630\nas we look at the ITL\npractitioner qualification,\n\n335\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.420\nthen we actually like to look\nat iterative improvements.\n\n336\n00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.110\nAnd so we start off small and\nwe start off with a small number of\n\n337\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:25.120\ncritical success factors and\nthen we build on that over time.\n\n338\n00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.250\nSo, yes, it can seem overwhelming and\nit shouldn't.\n\n339\n00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.750\nWe should be starting off fairly simply.\n\n340\n00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.690\n&gt;&gt; Jo, I always take it from\nthe stand point of someone like me,\n\n341\n00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:39.140\nwho may just have\nunderstood the foundations.\n\n342\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.720\nBut now we get into this process, we start\nthinking about, we start doing it, and\n\n343\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.770\njust like everything when we're\nfirst beginning overthinking\n\n344\n00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.880\nis pretty much what ends up happening.\n\n345\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.740\nAnd all of a sudden here we are, we're in\nthe middle of trying to do the strategy\n\n346\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:56.030\nand even for\na small relation I now have 45 CSFs.\n\n347\n00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.300\nAnd trying to pare that\ndown to that point, and\n\n348\n00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.810\nI look at everyone of them and\nthink that this is important.\n\n349\n00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.584\nYou know, every single one seems to\nbe a critical success factor that we\n\n350\n00:23:03.584 --> 00:23:04.530\nneed to hit.\n\n351\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:10.440\nBut keeping it simple is kind of the key\nthat we need to keep in mind, right?\n\n352\n00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.760\n&gt;&gt; An over-engineered process\nis not an efficient process.\n\n353\n00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.980\nSo, if it's been over-engineered,\nif it's not to the right scale for\n\n354\n00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.220\nthe organization,\nthen it's not going to be efficient.\n\n355\n00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.320\nIt's gonna be cumbersome.\n\n356\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.140\nIt's gonna be perceived as bureaucratic\nand people are going to try and bypass it.\n\n357\n00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.270\nIf you have got 100 CSFs and\nyou look at them and you think, but\n\n358\n00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.070\nthey all seem relevant.\n\n359\n00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.560\nWell, what's going to happen is because\nyou've got people that are trying to\n\n360\n00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.900\nachieve specific CSFs then they\nactually work harder to achieve\n\n361\n00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.830\nthe KPIs than what they do to\ndeliver value in the work.\n\n362\n00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.770\nAnd so we will tell you that you've\ngotta think about scalability and\n\n363\n00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:51.910\nyou have to think about relevance\nas well and duplication as well.\n\n364\n00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:56.132\nIf you've got 150 CSFs, I guarantee\nthat there's duplication in there.\n\n365\n00:23:56.132 --> 00:24:00.194\nEven for a large organization, you're\ngonna have duplication in those CSFs.\n\n366\n00:24:00.194 --> 00:24:03.862\nSo keep it simple,\nlet's look at combining the CSFs,\n\n367\n00:24:03.862 --> 00:24:07.231\nlet's look At the duplication\nthat's in there.\n\n368\n00:24:07.231 --> 00:24:11.150\nAnd let's look at how\nwe can pair that down.\n\n369\n00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.510\nBecause as I say,\nthe more CSFs and KPIs you have,\n\n370\n00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:19.690\nthe more focused that people are on\ntrying to achieve specific KPIs, and\n\n371\n00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.510\nthe less focused they\nare on delivering value.\n\n372\n00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.587\nAnd as i say, an over-engineered process.\n\n373\n00:24:24.587 --> 00:24:28.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is not an efficient process.\n\n374\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and i'm guessing that, that's\nsomething that is really only learned\n\n375\n00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.470\nthrough experience or through someone\nconsulting and coming in and going,\n\n376\n00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:39.340\nlook, you've really over-engineered this\n&gt;&gt; Strategy management, and\n\n377\n00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.979\njust the implementation of\nservice management, of ITIL, or\n\n378\n00:24:42.979 --> 00:24:47.690\nan ITIL based framework, is one of those\nthings that is really difficult for\n\n379\n00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.820\norganizations to first embark on.\n\n380\n00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.070\nNow, we're not gonna tell you you can't do\nit yourself, because you almost certainly\n\n381\n00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:59.960\ncan, but the way that some organizations\nwill try and implement this\n\n382\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.380\nis by looking at the ITIL publications and\nsaying, okay this looks great.\n\n383\n00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is a one size fits all approach.\n\n384\n00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.710\nAnd this is exactly where it goes\nwrong because it's not a one size fits\n\n385\n00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:11.530\nall approach.\n\n386\n00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.060\nWe're gonna give you a framework.\n\n387\n00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:18.388\nBut it's entirely up to you what your\nservice management processes look like,\n\n388\n00:25:18.388 --> 00:25:22.840\nand this is why I'll tell you right\naway through out this that these\n\n389\n00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.204\nare just examples.\n\n390\n00:25:24.204 --> 00:25:29.188\nEven when we come to looking at processes\nif we look at process flows in service\n\n391\n00:25:29.188 --> 00:25:34.262\ntransition and service operation,\nI will say to you these are just examples.\n\n392\n00:25:34.262 --> 00:25:36.603\nWe'll tell you,\nyou need to have this process but\n\n393\n00:25:36.603 --> 00:25:39.070\nit's entirely up to you\nwhat it looks like.\n\n394\n00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:43.100\nWe'll tell you,\nyou have to have strategy management.\n\n395\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.970\nWell, of course you do.\n\n396\n00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.400\nSomebody's got to tell you what\nthe direction is but you know what?\n\n397\n00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.040\nIf that starts off as a very simple\nword document then we're okay with that\n\n398\n00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.190\nbecause you've got the process in mind and\nyou can build on that process.\n\n399\n00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.260\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, so I've kind of\nmentioned one of the challenges there,\n\n400\n00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.690\nwhere somebody over thinks it.\n\n401\n00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.060\nWhat are some of the other challenges and\n\n402\n00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.100\nrisks that we're trying\nto think about here?\n\n403\n00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.289\n&gt;&gt; Well we've got a list\nof challenges here.\n\n404\n00:26:07.289 --> 00:26:08.315\n&gt;&gt; Nice!\n\n405\n00:26:08.315 --> 00:26:10.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And, yeah, so again,\n\n406\n00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.520\nthat first one which is exactly\nwhat we're talking about,\n\n407\n00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:19.970\nis doing it at the wrong level is over\nengineering the process, start off small.\n\n408\n00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.580\nWhen it talks about lack of appropriate\ntools, if you start it off small,\n\n409\n00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.370\nyou don't need a lot of\nsophisticated tools,\n\n410\n00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.860\nyou need a Word document,\na PDF document, okay.\n\n411\n00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:36.040\nYes, you need document control because\nyou need know which one is the most up\n\n412\n00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.730\nto date and\nwhich one is the valid document.\n\n413\n00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.430\nBut nevertheless keep it simple,\nstart off small.\n\n414\n00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.464\nYou need to have the support\nof the stakeholders.\n\n415\n00:26:45.464 --> 00:26:48.174\nBut I will challenge everybody and\nI always do,\n\n416\n00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:52.442\nI will ask questions like what's your\nstrategy and when I get an answer\n\n417\n00:26:52.442 --> 00:26:57.140\nwell I'm not too sure, I say well okay\nwhat's stopping you from doing this?\n\n418\n00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:01.020\nBecause it will take you maybe\nan hour to devise a document that\n\n419\n00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.980\ncontains your strategy, okay,\nmaybe it might take a little bit longer,\n\n420\n00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.050\nit depends on the size\nof the organization.\n\n421\n00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.910\nBut this is all down to support, and\nthis is all down to visibility and\n\n422\n00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.900\nwe'll tell you to keep it simple and to\nensure that they're visible improvements.\n\n423\n00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.070\nSo make something visible.\n\n424\n00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.830\nIf you don't create a document and\n\n425\n00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.930\nyou don't make the document visible\nthen you're never gonna get buy in.\n\n426\n00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.240\nYou're not gonna get buy in for\nsomething that nobody can see.\n\n427\n00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.870\nAnd this is how get that\nsupport from our stakeholders.\n\n428\n00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:38.390\nAnd sure, when we start off small,\nlack of accurate information can\n\n429\n00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.350\nbe a challenge but you're not gonna get\npeople to help you with the information if\n\n430\n00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.880\nthey don't know that you're looking for\nthat information.\n\n431\n00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.957\nSo start off small,\nget everybody involved.\n\n432\n00:27:49.957 --> 00:27:53.897\nBut then look at what can happen, look at\nwhat can go wrong if we look at the risks\n\n433\n00:27:53.897 --> 00:27:56.380\nonce we've got strategy in place.\n\n434\n00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:01.423\nAgain, it goes back to information, and\nabout not having sufficient information,\n\n435\n00:28:01.423 --> 00:28:05.848\nand then, again, it goes back to,\nyou know, having the wrong strategy.\n\n436\n00:28:05.848 --> 00:28:09.160\nYou know, making sure we're going in\nthe wrong, in the right direction.\n\n437\n00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.240\nIt's a line to the organization.\n\n438\n00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.550\nAnd I said that right the way throughout\nour service strategy sessions.\n\n439\n00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.890\nWe have to make sure we are in the same\ndirection of the organization.\n\n440\n00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:22.870\nNow the risk of flawed governance\n\n441\n00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.890\ngoes back to exactly what\nwe were just talking about.\n\n442\n00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:31.000\nAbout over engineered processes,\nyou know, if we have\n\n443\n00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.880\na governance model that is too\nprescriptive, that is too rigid,\n\n444\n00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:42.480\nthat is almost very almost dictatorial\nthen we don't have that flexibility\n\n445\n00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.530\nto be able to bring in new services and\nto be able to manage with common sense.\n\n446\n00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.716\nWe can't ignore common sense, okay?\n\n447\n00:28:49.716 --> 00:28:52.476\n[LAUGH] We all need common sense, and\n\n448\n00:28:52.476 --> 00:28:57.639\nwe really do apply this in service\nmanagement in ITIL, we have to.\n\n449\n00:28:57.639 --> 00:29:01.870\nIf we don't apply common sense,\nif we over-engineer, then we don't have\n\n450\n00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:06.047\nan efficient process and we're not\ngoing to get the right results either.\n\n451\n00:29:06.047 --> 00:29:10.963\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us to understand a little\n\n452\n00:29:10.963 --> 00:29:16.054\nbit more about this idea of strategy\nmanagement as well for our IT services.\n\n453\n00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:18.723\nAnd we took a look at the idea\nof the triggers that we have\n\n454\n00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:20.012\nto actually think about.\n\n455\n00:29:20.012 --> 00:29:24.192\nAs well as where it influences\nall of the other processes and\n\n456\n00:29:24.192 --> 00:29:25.954\nlife cycles along ITIL.\n\n457\n00:29:25.954 --> 00:29:30.331\nAnd of course even here at the end\nwhen we talked about the CSFs and\n\n458\n00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:33.680\nKPIs to think about and\nchallenges and risks.\n\n459\n00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.960\nThere's a lot of material right here for\nyou to consider as you continue\n\n460\n00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.980\nto move forward with, of course,\nservice and strategy management here.\n\n461\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.900\nWell this is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n462\n00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.660\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n463\n00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n464\n00:29:48.790 -->

00:00:26.425\nAnd today, we're gonna be taking a look\nat Service Portfolio Management.\n\n9\n00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.610\nIt's a lot of words there for us.\n\n10\n00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.058\nAnd here to help us to understand that\nbetter is gonna be our ITIL Chancellor\n\n11\n00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:34.655\nherself, Ms Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:35.860\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.600\n&gt;&gt; Thanks very much.\n\n14\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.964\nThis service strategy episode,\nthey're killing you, aren't they?\n\n15\n00:00:38.964 --> 00:00:40.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They really are.\n\n16\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.337\nThere's a lot of different things\nthat we actually have in place here.\n\n17\n00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:49.810\nSo, let's talk about this idea of the\nService Portfolio Management a little bit.\n\n18\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.381\nI understand the term service,\nI understand the term portfolio, but\n\n19\n00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:58.188\nhow do they fit together,\nwhat are we talking about here?\n\n20\n00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:03.271\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're talking about at\ndatabase at least in its very,\n\n21\n00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:10.230\nvery basic form as spreadsheet of services\nthat we provide to our customers, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.932\nWe all have, we all understand\nthe concept of online shopping.\n\n23\n00:01:14.932 --> 00:01:16.194\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we go to a store,\n\n24\n00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:20.766\nan online store and we have a selection\nof goods that we choose from, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n26\n00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.030\n&gt;&gt; And we click on those goods and it will\ntell us, it will give us a definition,\n\n27\n00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.990\netc., of what it is, and then,\nwe then can choose based on things like\n\n28\n00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.120\nthe cost and the delivery and\nany prerequisites.\n\n29\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.210\nSometimes they'll put in there,\nwell, if you've bought these,\n\n30\n00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.260\nyou probably need these.\n\n31\n00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.810\nBatteries not included,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n32\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.355\nAnd so,\nthat's what we call a service catalogue.\n\n33\n00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:52.520\nWell, a service portfolio is\nincorporates the service catalogue, but\n\n34\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.490\nit's kind of like the service\ncatalogue with a beginning and an end.\n\n35\n00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.269\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n36\n00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:02.025\n&gt;&gt; In the service catalogue, what you've\ngot, and when you go to your online\n\n37\n00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:06.650\nshopping is you've got a list of goods\nthat are available for you to buy.\n\n38\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:15.150\nBut somebody's got to make that\ndecision to sell that particular good.\n\n39\n00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.340\nSo let's say you were looking for cameras,\nfor instance, so you were looking to\n\n40\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.510\npurchase a camera, somebody somewhere,\nat that particular company, has got to\n\n41\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.480\nmake the decision that we are going to\nstop and we're going to sell that camera.\n\n42\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.750\nSo the first thing that happens is that,\nsomebody comes up with an idea for\n\n43\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.246\nthat service, for that camera.\n\n44\n00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:37.930\nAnd they say,\nI quite like the look of this camera.\n\n45\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.011\nSo what they do is,\nthey put that into the database.\n\n46\n00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:44.967\nAnd then,\nthey start to build on that idea.\n\n47\n00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:45.817\nSo they say, okay,\n\n48\n00:02:45.817 --> 00:02:48.721\nI'm gonna find out a little bit\nmore information about that camera.\n\n49\n00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:53.947\nSo that's when they add in things\nlike the dimensions and the size,\n\n50\n00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:58.713\nthe size of the memory,\nthe size of the actual camera itself,\n\n51\n00:02:58.713 --> 00:03:01.870\nhow many mega pixels it will take, etc.\n\n52\n00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.930\nAnd then they build on things like\nwhat accessories you can have.\n\n53\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.967\nAnd then it some point in time,\nsomebody says, you know what,\n\n54\n00:03:08.967 --> 00:03:14.146\nshould we make this live or not, should\nwe make this available to our customers,\n\n55\n00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:16.520\nshould we offer it to our customers?\n\n56\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.950\nAt that point in time,\nthe decision is made, yes.\n\n57\n00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.720\nAnd so simply what we do is in that\ndatabase, we just check or tick a box and\n\n58\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.100\nthen it's live for our customers.\n\n59\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.039\nNow sometimes we don't have any stock of\nit, so we'll turn around and say, okay,\n\n60\n00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:36.038\nthen it's gonna be live for our customers,\nbut it's going to have a release date and\n\n61\n00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:39.849\nit's going to be live from the 1st\nof January 2020, for instance, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.623\nSo the first part,\nis what we call a pipeline, and\n\n63\n00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:50.993\nthe first portion there where\nwe're thinking about offering that\n\n64\n00:03:50.993 --> 00:03:56.353\nparticular camera for sale,\nit's still just an idea.\n\n65\n00:03:56.353 --> 00:03:58.940\nWe haven't evaluated it yet.\n\n66\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.577\nBut it doesn't make any sense to\nkeep that in a separate database.\n\n67\n00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:06.164\nWe might as well keep it all in\none database, and then as we build\n\n68\n00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:10.768\nup the information in that database, then\nall we need to do is just simply check or\n\n69\n00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:12.959\ntick a box to say, yes, make it live.\n\n70\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.110\nAnd then is available for\nour customers to buy.\n\n71\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.840\nSo the first part is what we call our\npipeline, the second part is what we call\n\n72\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.020\nour catalogue, and\nthat whats available for our customers.\n\n73\n00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.087\nAnd then this is third part of this and\ncalled our retired services.\n\n74\n00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:33.430\nAnd these are the services that are no\nlonger available for the customers to buy.\n\n75\n00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.274\nSo at some point in time,\nthat camera's gonna reach its end of life.\n\n76\n00:04:36.274 --> 00:04:39.546\nAnd so,\nwe're going to uncheck that box and\n\n77\n00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:43.000\nwe're going to change\nits status to retired.\n\n78\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.656\nIn other words,\nthat it's still kept in that database.\n\n79\n00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:51.031\nBecause we might still need to refer to\nits information at some point in time,\n\n80\n00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:53.610\nlike why we decided to retire it?\n\n81\n00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.295\nBut it's no longer visible\nto customers to buy.\n\n82\n00:04:56.434 --> 00:04:58.640\nAnd that's the portfolio.\n\n83\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.480\nSo the portfolio is a database\nthat's split into three.\n\n84\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.831\nAnd those three sections are the pipeline,\nthat's where we have the ideas for\n\n85\n00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:07.507\nour services.\n\n86\n00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:11.439\nThe catalogue, which is where\nour services are enlisted for\n\n87\n00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.020\nour customers to be able to see.\n\n88\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:21.360\nAnd then our retired services,\nwhich is where services go to be retired.\n\n89\n00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.580\nI was gonna say, where they go to die,\nbut that sounds mean and cruel.\n\n90\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.690\n[LAUGH] So I won't do that.\n\n91\n00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.570\nBut that's in our retired services part,\nokay?\n\n92\n00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.902\nSo that's what our portfolio is,\nit's very, very simply, and\n\n93\n00:05:32.902 --> 00:05:34.427\nthis part is simplest terms.\n\n94\n00:05:34.427 --> 00:05:38.418\nIt could be a list, it could be\nan Excel spreadsheet, for instance, or\n\n95\n00:05:38.418 --> 00:05:42.940\nit could be and more likely than not, it's\ngoing to be a database where we keep all\n\n96\n00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.420\nthe information about all of our services.\n\n97\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.480\nSo when we look at the purpose of Service\nPortfolio Management, it talks about\n\n98\n00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.050\nallowing the service provider to\noffer the right mix of services.\n\n99\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.400\nThat's what we talk about, we talk about\nmix of services to allow the organization\n\n100\n00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.768\nto achieve the business outcomes.\n\n101\n00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:11.290\nSo, Service Portfolio Management\nis not just about the pipeline,\n\n102\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.304\nit's not just about coming up with\nthe ideas, but it is also about evaluating\n\n103\n00:06:15.304 --> 00:06:18.979\neverything that's in the catalogue and\nsaying at some point in time.\n\n104\n00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.854\nDo you know what,\nwe sold that for 20 years now,\n\n105\n00:06:21.854 --> 00:06:24.125\nwe don't need to sell it anymore.\n\n106\n00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:27.345\nWe never get any orders in for\nthat particular model of catalogue, so\n\n107\n00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.820\nwe're not going to sell that anymore.\n\n108\n00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.330\nThat's what\nService Portfolio Management does.\n\n109\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.615\nSo when it talks about investing\nthroughout the lifecycle of a service,\n\n110\n00:06:36.615 --> 00:06:39.788\nthat means that,\nwe're tracking that investment.\n\n111\n00:06:39.788 --> 00:06:44.668\nSo we're looking right at the very\nstart as to whether it's a good idea,\n\n112\n00:06:44.668 --> 00:06:47.628\nand whether it will be a viable service,\nand\n\n113\n00:06:47.628 --> 00:06:52.800\nthen once it's in the catalogue,\nwe monitoring our popularities.\n\n114\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.510\nFor instance, whether it meets the needs\nof the business, and then in some point in\n\n115\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.600\ntime, we make the decision to\nretire that particular service.\n\n116\n00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.328\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n117\n00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:05.848\nSo I like the definition that you gave,\nand\n\n118\n00:07:05.848 --> 00:07:08.660\nI think I understand two-thirds of it,\nokay.\n\n119\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.297\nSo I understand the idea of the pipeline,\nmaking sure that we got that ready to go.\n\n120\n00:07:12.297 --> 00:07:14.918\nThe idea of the catalogue,\nthe offering that we want, but\n\n121\n00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:18.679\nwhy is it important that I keep the stuff\nthat I'm saying, I'm gonna remove that?\n\n122\n00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:21.590\nWhy is it so\nimportant that I have that there?\n\n123\n00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.270\nIs there something I'm gonna be able to\nuse that's gonna help me out in the future\n\n124\n00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.070\nor what's the point here?\n\n125\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes, most definitely.\n\n126\n00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.758\nNow when we look at certain services,\nfor instance, financial management.\n\n127\n00:07:32.758 --> 00:07:36.817\nNow every single country, it doesn't\nmatter wherever you are in the world,\n\n128\n00:07:36.817 --> 00:07:39.876\nevery single country has got\na law in place that says that,\n\n129\n00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:43.460\nyou have to retain tax information for\na certain period of time.\n\n130\n00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.605\nIt's usually run about ten years or\nsomething like that.\n\n131\n00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:53.170\nNow, who do you know that has retained\na financial package for ten years?\n\n132\n00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:56.209\nNot many organizations.\n\n133\n00:07:56.209 --> 00:08:00.033\nBut if you have to be able to\naccess that data for ten years,\n\n134\n00:08:00.033 --> 00:08:04.720\nit's quite possible that your tax\nauthority could come along and say,\n\n135\n00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.824\nI need access to your tax data from Ten\nyears ago, or nine and a half years ago.\n\n136\n00:08:09.824 --> 00:08:13.925\nNow, if you don't have that service\navailable on your network, you need to\n\n137\n00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:18.330\nknow what it is you need to get hold\nof to be able to retrieve that data.\n\n138\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.850\nSo, that's one reason.\n\n139\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.100\nAnother reason why we keep that is,\nbecause at some point in time\n\n140\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.383\nsomebody within the organization, and I\nwas gonna say, somebody like [INAUDIBLE].\n\n141\n00:08:27.383 --> 00:08:27.892\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:08:27.892 --> 00:08:29.530\n&gt;&gt; Might come along and say, hey,\n\n143\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.660\nlook, you know,\n\n144\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:36.250\nwe had this free web mail based service at\none point in time and we got rid of it.\n\n145\n00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.137\nI'd like to go back to using that web\nmail based service, because it's free.\n\n146\n00:08:40.137 --> 00:08:44.854\nAt which point in time we can look\nback at that and we can say, okay,\n\n147\n00:08:44.854 --> 00:08:49.910\nwe did have this, but these are the\nreasons why we retire that service,\n\n148\n00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.375\nand why we move to something else.\n\n149\n00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:56.993\nAnd if those conditions still exist,\nif those reasons still exist,\n\n150\n00:08:56.993 --> 00:09:01.740\nthey'll know we're not moving\nto that web mail service again.\n\n151\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.930\nSo, that's the reason why,\ndoes that answer your question?\n\n152\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.030\n&gt;&gt; It really does, thank you.\n\n153\n00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.093\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?, good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:07.927\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I mean,\n\n155\n00:09:07.927 --> 00:09:12.431\nI'm sure each organization has got 100\nmore different reasons themselves as to\n\n156\n00:09:12.431 --> 00:09:15.360\nwhy they want to retain\nall of that information.\n\n157\n00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.710\nBut we always say, it's best practice\nto retain information anyway.\n\n158\n00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.130\nYou never really want to delete anything.\n\n159\n00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.670\nWe might want to archive it, and\nthere's nothing wrong with that,\n\n160\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.050\nit's like our ten year old tax data, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.840\nWe probably want to archive that, and\n\n162\n00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.930\nwe don't wanna [LAUGH] keep that in\nour current database for ten years.\n\n163\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.800\nBut nevertheless we still\nneed to have access to it.\n\n164\n00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.610\nSo, the objective really service portfolio\nmanagement that is just to provide a way\n\n165\n00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:46.680\nfor us as a service provider to ensure\nthat we put the right mix of services,\n\n166\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:53.960\nwe've said to allow the business to allow\norganization to fulfill their objectives.\n\n167\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.010\nSo, we've just got to maintain\nthat portfolio of services.\n\n168\n00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:02.610\nNow, one of the things that I will tell\nyou, and we're gonna get into a lot\n\n169\n00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.900\nmore detail in this in both\nservice portfolio management here.\n\n170\n00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.736\nAnd also, in service design when\nwe look at the catalog itself.\n\n171\n00:10:09.736 --> 00:10:14.310\nOne of the things I've got to\ntell you is the fact that we\n\n172\n00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.991\narticulate a service in the catalogue, and\n\n173\n00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:22.780\nin our portfolio,\nin terms of its value to the business.\n\n174\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.940\nIt's not about what it means to\nme as an IT service provider,\n\n175\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.400\nit's about what it means\nto the organization.\n\n176\n00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.270\nSo, when we looked at say, email for\n\n177\n00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.890\ninstance, it's not about\nMicrosoft Outlook.\n\n178\n00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.960\nThat's what it means to\nme as a service provider.\n\n179\n00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.290\nI know, that email means Microsoft Outlook\nand means Exchange Sever, and\n\n180\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.820\nit means this network can it means X,\nY and Z.\n\n181\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.250\nBut it's not about that.\n\n182\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.230\nBecause you see, I don't expect\nthe customer, or user to know that.\n\n183\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:02.030\nSo, we articulate the service in terms of\nthe values that it has to be business.\n\n184\n00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.350\nSo, we don't call it Microsoft Outlook.\n\n185\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.630\nCuz that could mean a multitude of things.\n\n186\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.340\nWhat we call it as an e-mail service.\n\n187\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.130\nThe description of that service is\nvery simply the ability to send and\n\n188\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.030\nreceive e-mail.\n\n189\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:24.050\nIf you went to a web store,\n\n190\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.390\nand you looked at a particular\nitem in a web store.\n\n191\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:33.190\nYou'd want to see that item displayed in,\nwell, what you might call layman's terms.\n\n192\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.890\nIf I was looking for\na camera, I'd be looking for\n\n193\n00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.890\nwords that are familiar to me, not words\nthat are familiar to the manufacturer.\n\n194\n00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.210\nThe fact that it had this mobile\nnumber and this serial number.\n\n195\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.470\nI probably wouldn't care about.\n\n196\n00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.510\nWhat I'd be looking for are features.\n\n197\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.610\nI'd be looking for\nwhat it would do for me.\n\n198\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.980\nSo, I might be looking at\nthe mile of mega pixels it has.\n\n199\n00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.240\nOr I might be looking at\nthe lenses that it has available,\n\n200\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.470\nand what my zoom capacity on those lenses.\n\n201\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.030\nI certainly wouldn't be looking for\nspecific serial number.\n\n202\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:10.010\nI wouldn't necessarily be looking for the\nsize of the battery that it holds, etc.\n\n203\n00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.290\nBecause that doesn't matter to me.\n\n204\n00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.540\nWhat matters to me is what\nit's going to do for me, and\n\n205\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.140\nwhat outcome is going to facilitate for\nme.\n\n206\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.260\nAnd this is why in our service portfolio,\nwell,\n\n207\n00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.850\nwe display all of our services in\nterms of value to the business.\n\n208\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.340\nAnd in terms of what it actually means for\nthem.\n\n209\n00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.690\nAnd as it says,\nin this third bullet point on your slide,\n\n210\n00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:36.670\nit allows the customer to see how\nthe service will assist them.\n\n211\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.640\nThis is not about what it means\nto me as a service provider.\n\n212\n00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.110\nAnd I've already mentioned about\ncontrolling the services and\n\n213\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.190\ntracking them throughout their lifecycle.\n\n214\n00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:51.300\nSo, we do, on a regular basis,\nwe determine which services aren't viable,\n\n215\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.800\nwhich services aren't relevant anymore.\n\n216\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.760\nAnd we will make a decision whether\nwe still want those services.\n\n217\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.380\nThink about merges and acquisitions,\nand if your organization\n\n218\n00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.040\nundertakes a lot of merges and\nacquisitions, well, those merges and\n\n219\n00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.060\nacquisitions, we're going to bring in\na lot duplicate services, should we say.\n\n220\n00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.150\nAnd in which case,\nin that instance then, well,\n\n221\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.830\nwe need to be able to identify what\nour duplicate services are, and\n\n222\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.000\nmake decisions to what we're\ngoing to do about them.\n\n223\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.950\nSo, Service Portfolio Management covers\nall of those that are going to be\n\n224\n00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.280\ndelivered, that's what's in our pipeline.\n\n225\n00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.460\nThe ones that are currently delivered,\nthat's in our catalog, and\n\n226\n00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:36.730\nthose that are currently, that have been\nwithdrawn, or about to be withdrawn.\n\n227\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.640\nI wanna mention something\nat this point in time.\n\n228\n00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.098\nNow, ITIL was written in the UK.\n\n229\n00:13:43.098 --> 00:13:45.083\nIt came out of the UK.\n\n230\n00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:48.708\nAnd if there's anyone of you\naround here right now, and\n\n231\n00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:53.950\nI include myself in this, that looks\nat this and says, that's spelled wrong.\n\n232\n00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.733\nThis is not how we spell catalogue.\n\n233\n00:13:56.733 --> 00:13:57.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n234\n00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.821\nThis is not how I spell catalogue.\n\n235\n00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:02.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm holding my hands up on this one.\n\n236\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.090\nAll right.\n\n237\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.430\nBut this is probably how\nRonnie spells catalogue.\n\n238\n00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.700\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Am I right?\n\n239\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.465\n&gt;&gt; You're correct.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n240\n00:14:07.465 --> 00:14:13.080\nITIL is written in what we\ncall International English.\n\n241\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.020\nAnd that's been done deliberately.\n\n242\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.932\nThis is not a spelling mistake, cuz\nanything go on if you [LAUGH] could look\n\n243\n00:14:17.932 --> 00:14:20.000\nat this and say,\nthis is a spelling mistake.\n\n244\n00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.570\nSo, I wanna point this out to you,\nall right?\n\n245\n00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.050\nAs we move through all the ITIL\npublications you'll see spellings,\n\n246\n00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.000\nand it doesn't matter where in the world\nyou are, you will see spellings that\n\n247\n00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.890\nyou're not familiar with, okay?, [LAUGH]\nit's written in International English.\n\n248\n00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:37.210\nIt's kind of a mixture\nbetween American English, and\n\n249\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.186\nI what I call English English.\n\n250\n00:14:39.186 --> 00:14:40.876\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n251\n00:14:40.876 --> 00:14:42.927\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there has been some uses and\n\n252\n00:14:42.927 --> 00:14:45.842\nsome as taken out, but\nthere's been some left.\n\n253\n00:14:45.842 --> 00:14:50.912\nPut in and there's been some Ss taken out,\nand we've replaced them with Zs,\n\n254\n00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:54.590\nor Zs, depended on how you\nwant to pronounce it, okay?\n\n255\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.805\nSo, please,\ndon't be put off by the spelling.\n\n256\n00:14:58.805 --> 00:15:00.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Its deliberate, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.380\nIt's not that I don't know how to spell.\n\n258\n00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.590\nAnd which actually, right now,\n\n259\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.180\nI don't know how to spell,\nI've given up with spelling.\n\n260\n00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.270\nFrom the minute I moved to the States,\nI gave up completely with spelling.\n\n261\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:16.770\n[LAUGH] So, I'd figured that I would never\nbe able to do it ever again, anymore.\n\n262\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.850\nSo, that's worth noting.\n\n263\n00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:23.770\nThere aren't any mistakes,\nthe deliberates, as we call them, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:31.100\nI mean, that does play a point when\nit comes to your examinations and\n\n265\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:36.060\nwhen it comes to testing,\nis that sometimes we\n\n266\n00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:42.960\nput things that are likely to be\ndistractors in there for a reason.\n\n267\n00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.129\nSo, watch out for that.\n\n268\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.798\nSo, let's get back to the service\nportfolio then [LAUGH], okay?\n\n269\n00:15:48.798 --> 00:15:53.375\nThe service portfolio is\nreally about measuring,\n\n270\n00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:57.642\nwhether we can viably\ndeliver any new service.\n\n271\n00:15:57.642 --> 00:16:00.181\nAnd so, assessed a new service, or\n\n272\n00:16:00.181 --> 00:16:04.173\na new idea before it's\nrelevance to the organization.\n\n273\n00:16:04.173 --> 00:16:08.403\nAnd foreseeability to\nfacilitate an outcome.\n\n274\n00:16:08.403 --> 00:16:10.742\nSo we use Service Portfolio to,\n\n275\n00:16:10.742 --> 00:16:15.254\nas it says link business outcomes\nwith expected investment.\n\n276\n00:16:15.254 --> 00:16:20.426\nIn other words, this is about what we\nwant to deliver to the organization.\n\n277\n00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:23.980\nNow an external service\nprovider will use these as,\n\n278\n00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:29.152\nwell it's kind of an investment tool\nbecause certainly within our pipeline\n\n279\n00:16:29.152 --> 00:16:33.786\nwe look at our new services and\nour new ideas, as I like to call them.\n\n280\n00:16:33.786 --> 00:16:37.527\nAnd they will use the definition\nof those ideas, and as I said,\n\n281\n00:16:37.527 --> 00:16:42.342\n[INAUDIBLE] time we're gonna expand on\nthe information that's in the pipeline.\n\n282\n00:16:42.342 --> 00:16:47.540\nAnd therefore, we're going to\nuse that information to viably\n\n283\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:53.435\nassess whether we can deliver this\nservice to our external customers.\n\n284\n00:16:53.435 --> 00:16:56.131\nSo does it add value to the business?\n\n285\n00:16:56.131 --> 00:16:57.108\nWell, of course, it does.\n\n286\n00:16:57.108 --> 00:17:02.233\nBecause this is where we store our ideas,\nthis is where we keep\n\n287\n00:17:02.233 --> 00:17:07.953\nall of those in our pipeline,\nall of our new ideas for new services and\n\n288\n00:17:07.953 --> 00:17:12.994\nour new ideas for\nhow we can maybe adjust existing services,\n\n289\n00:17:12.994 --> 00:17:16.224\nTo better meet the needs\nof the organization and\n\n290\n00:17:16.224 --> 00:17:21.400\nalso where we can get rid of\nredundancy and duplication as well.\n\n291\n00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.070\nSo, Ronnie let me ask you,\nwhere do you think our ideas come from?\n\n292\n00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.226\n&gt;&gt; Where did they come from?\n\n293\n00:17:29.226 --> 00:17:30.043\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n294\n00:17:30.043 --> 00:17:33.409\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that they would come\n\n295\n00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:35.928\nfrom the business decision makers.\n\n296\n00:17:35.928 --> 00:17:39.184\n&gt;&gt; The business decision makers, hm.\n\n297\n00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.591\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, [LAUGH]\n\n298\n00:17:41.591 --> 00:17:43.033\n&gt;&gt; I'm just thinking because these\n\n299\n00:17:43.033 --> 00:17:43.758\nare just ideas.\n\n300\n00:17:43.758 --> 00:17:44.369\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n301\n00:17:44.369 --> 00:17:48.426\n&gt;&gt; So, generally ideas are presented\nto decision makers for\n\n302\n00:17:48.426 --> 00:17:50.338\nthem to make a decision on.\n\n303\n00:17:50.338 --> 00:17:50.965\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n304\n00:17:50.965 --> 00:17:53.371\n&gt;&gt; It's a kind of a trick question.\n\n305\n00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:54.516\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n306\n00:17:54.516 --> 00:17:56.243\n&gt;&gt; Cuz ideas can come from anywhere.\n\n307\n00:17:56.243 --> 00:17:57.959\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could have an idea,\n\n308\n00:17:57.959 --> 00:17:59.006\nyou could have an idea.\n\n309\n00:17:59.006 --> 00:18:03.577\nOur customers and\nour users they could have ideas.\n\n310\n00:18:03.577 --> 00:18:05.379\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes,\n\n311\n00:18:05.379 --> 00:18:08.899\nour executives get ideas as well.\n\n312\n00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:12.273\nAnd generally,\nour executives get ideas that translate\n\n313\n00:18:12.273 --> 00:18:14.951\ninto I need one of these\nright now [LAUGH] okay?\n\n314\n00:18:14.951 --> 00:18:18.370\nBut these ideas can come from TV\ncommercials, they can come from\n\n315\n00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.423\nthe teenager down the road who's\nwandering around with the latest toy, and\n\n316\n00:18:22.423 --> 00:18:26.822\nwe think that that would be a great idea\nwe could use that within our organization.\n\n317\n00:18:26.822 --> 00:18:30.445\nSo, ideas could come\nfrom absolutely anywhere.\n\n318\n00:18:30.445 --> 00:18:38.031\nSo, what could appear in our pipeline\ncould be a huge number of ideas.\n\n319\n00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:43.529\nBut we use these ideas then to\ncalculate return on investment,\n\n320\n00:18:43.529 --> 00:18:46.652\nor expected return on investment.\n\n321\n00:18:46.652 --> 00:18:51.257\nWe produce business cases on these\nideas and then we make decisions.\n\n322\n00:18:51.257 --> 00:18:55.162\nAnd it's only at that point in time\nwhen the decision has been made\n\n323\n00:18:55.162 --> 00:18:59.777\nfrom the business case, because we know\nthat it's financially a good idea,\n\n324\n00:18:59.777 --> 00:19:01.270\nthat it's investable.\n\n325\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.019\nAnd investable, is that a word?\n\n326\n00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:05.622\nYeah, that works for me anyway.\n\n327\n00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:07.883\n[LAUGH] We'll make up new words,\nwe're okay with that.\n\n328\n00:19:07.883 --> 00:19:13.753\nAnd at that point in time, then we will\nmove that service into the catalog\n\n329\n00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:19.735\nbecause we all have an expected release\ndate, it will become chartered.\n\n330\n00:19:19.735 --> 00:19:20.698\nOkay.\n\n331\n00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.670\nJust think, okay,\nwe need to have a strategy\n\n332\n00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:32.326\nin place before we start evaluating ideas.\n\n333\n00:19:32.326 --> 00:19:36.530\nOtherwise, there is a danger\nthat you can have a thousand and\n\n334\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:40.247\none ideas in your Service Pipeline for\nnew services.\n\n335\n00:19:40.247 --> 00:19:43.905\nBut one of these new services is gonna\nhave the organization going off in this\n\n336\n00:19:43.905 --> 00:19:47.965\ndirection, and another idea is gonna have\nthe organization in this direction, and\n\n337\n00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:50.050\nthe organization goes in this direction.\n\n338\n00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.906\nSo you have to know what\ndirection you're going in.\n\n339\n00:19:52.906 --> 00:19:56.389\nYou have to understand your strategy,\n\n340\n00:19:56.389 --> 00:20:01.251\nbefore you can evaluate any new idea for\na new service.\n\n341\n00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:06.015\nSo our pipeline ensures that,\nnot only do we have ideas and\n\n342\n00:20:06.015 --> 00:20:10.683\nwe have somewhere to put those ideas for\na new services but\n\n343\n00:20:10.683 --> 00:20:17.507\nalso that we have somewhere to evaluate\nthose ideas against our service strategy.\n\n344\n00:20:17.507 --> 00:20:19.362\nWe also have to think about, and\n\n345\n00:20:19.362 --> 00:20:23.497\nour strategy is not just about\ndirection it’s about the way we govern.\n\n346\n00:20:23.497 --> 00:20:26.603\nSo we also have to think about\nour existing infrastructure and\n\n347\n00:20:26.603 --> 00:20:29.359\nwhat is actually technically possible for\nus as well.\n\n348\n00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:33.106\nIt’s no good us coming up with ideas for\nnew services,\n\n349\n00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:36.533\nthat is completely impossible for\nus to achieve.\n\n350\n00:20:36.533 --> 00:20:40.524\nNow I worked with one\nvery large international\n\n351\n00:20:40.524 --> 00:20:45.129\norganization on their\nmigration from a Windows based\n\n352\n00:20:45.129 --> 00:20:49.643\ninfrastructure to an Apple\nbased infrastructure.\n\n353\n00:20:49.643 --> 00:20:54.452\nWhich for an international\norganization was a huge big challenge,\n\n354\n00:20:54.452 --> 00:20:59.766\nbecause quite simply that it had from\nthe business costumers themselves,\n\n355\n00:20:59.766 --> 00:21:03.497\nit had so many requests for\ncertain functionality.\n\n356\n00:21:03.497 --> 00:21:08.775\nThey said, well, we cannot meet both,\nand this is where we do this evaluation.\n\n357\n00:21:08.775 --> 00:21:13.335\nWe can't do the, we cannot meet\nthe needs of this functionality and\n\n358\n00:21:13.335 --> 00:21:18.460\nmeet the needs of this particular\nfunctionality within the organization.\n\n359\n00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:25.291\nWe have to make a strategic decision as to\nwhich way we go because we cannot do both.\n\n360\n00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:31.201\nAnd so, this is where it happens,\nit happens in a Service Portfolio.\n\n361\n00:21:31.201 --> 00:21:35.389\nThis is where we start looking\nat that evaluation, and\n\n362\n00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:38.679\nwe start preparing to make that decision.\n\n363\n00:21:38.679 --> 00:21:41.497\nThat decision was not\na small decision to make,\n\n364\n00:21:41.497 --> 00:21:44.112\nit affected literally millions of people.\n\n365\n00:21:44.112 --> 00:21:49.848\nAnd so, we have to have somewhere\nthat will take the responsibility and\n\n366\n00:21:49.848 --> 00:21:53.589\nthe accountability to\nmake those decisions.\n\n367\n00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:59.408\nSo, I've already mentioned the pipeline,\nand our catalog, and our Retired Services.\n\n368\n00:21:59.408 --> 00:22:02.874\nHaving mentioned our\nConfiguration Management System,\n\n369\n00:22:02.874 --> 00:22:07.683\nnow our configuration management system\nis where we store all of the information\n\n370\n00:22:07.683 --> 00:22:11.657\nabout the components of our services or\nthe configuration items.\n\n371\n00:22:11.657 --> 00:22:17.016\nAnd so the Configuration Management System\nis where we keep all of the nuts and\n\n372\n00:22:17.016 --> 00:22:17.597\nbolts.\n\n373\n00:22:17.597 --> 00:22:22.058\nNow here in the Service Portfolio,\nwe've got that high level description of\n\n374\n00:22:22.058 --> 00:22:26.396\nthe services we've said, articulated\nin terms of value to the customer.\n\n375\n00:22:26.396 --> 00:22:31.040\nIn the Configuration System we see what\nthe components of each service are.\n\n376\n00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.180\nOur Application Portfolio\njust looks specifically at\n\n377\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:40.130\nthe software portion of our\nConfiguration Management System and\n\n378\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:45.350\nwhat applications we need specifically\nto deliver those services.\n\n379\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.560\nNow, we also have our Customer Portfolio,\n\n380\n00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.002\nin other words maybe a CRM database,\nwho are customers are.\n\n381\n00:22:53.002 --> 00:22:57.223\nAnd the agreement portfolio which\nis where we keep our service level\n\n382\n00:22:57.223 --> 00:22:58.715\nagreements with them.\n\n383\n00:22:58.715 --> 00:23:01.461\nOf course we have our project portfolio,\nand\n\n384\n00:23:01.461 --> 00:23:05.593\nour project portfolio is where we\nkeep a list of all of our projects.\n\n385\n00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:10.376\nAnd our service models, we looked at\nthat in a previous episode, is where we\n\n386\n00:23:10.376 --> 00:23:15.329\nunderstand those moments of truth,\nthose contact points for every service.\n\n387\n00:23:15.329 --> 00:23:17.958\nNow, of course, if it's a new service,\n\n388\n00:23:17.958 --> 00:23:22.468\nyou wouldn't have a service model in\nplace, but we can look at existing\n\n389\n00:23:22.468 --> 00:23:27.228\nservice models to see exactly how some\nof our existing services will work.\n\n390\n00:23:27.228 --> 00:23:29.950\nNow we should also have a database or\n\n391\n00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:35.397\nat least a register somewhere where\nwe have our defined market spaces,\n\n392\n00:23:35.397 --> 00:23:39.329\nwhere we understand where\nour opportunities are.\n\n393\n00:23:39.329 --> 00:23:43.315\nAnd, we should have some\nform of database or, again,\n\n394\n00:23:43.315 --> 00:23:48.428\nregister that allows us to see which\none of our service assets are being\n\n395\n00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:54.432\nused to deliver which services, because\nwe may not use all of our service assets.\n\n396\n00:23:54.432 --> 00:23:59.509\nYou remember our capabilities and our\nresources to deliver all of our service,\n\n397\n00:23:59.509 --> 00:24:04.832\nto deliver all of our services, we need to\nensure that we can map them to each other.\n\n398\n00:24:04.832 --> 00:24:05.462\nOkay.\nSo\n\n399\n00:24:05.462 --> 00:24:10.408\nservice portfolio management is about\nmanaging a service and its viability and\n\n400\n00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:15.150\nits relevance to the business across\nthe entire service lifecycle, okay?\n\n401\n00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:21.191\nIt represents all of our resources\nthroughout all of the stages of the life,\n\n402\n00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:25.736\nthrough service strategy,\nthrough design, through transition,\n\n403\n00:24:25.736 --> 00:24:29.437\nand throughout its operation\ninto retirement as well.\n\n404\n00:24:29.437 --> 00:24:33.730\nAnd, of course, any changes are governed\nby change of management policies.\n\n405\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:39.130\nSo, visually then, what I was talking\nabout just a little while ago,\n\n406\n00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.120\nhere is our service portfolio.\n\n407\n00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.090\nIt's a database.\n\n408\n00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.060\nIt's split into three.\n\n409\n00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.169\nOur pipeline is where we have our ideas.\n\n410\n00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.030\nCatalogue is where we\nhave our live services.\n\n411\n00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.716\nAnd our retired services, well, they're\nthose services that have been retired.\n\n412\n00:24:55.716 --> 00:24:59.382\nAnd we get the information from\nthe configuration management\n\n413\n00:24:59.382 --> 00:25:03.694\nsystem which in turn pulls information\nfrom other data sources as well.\n\n414\n00:25:03.694 --> 00:25:06.609\nAnd I think the only one that we\nhaven't looked at is the supply and\n\n415\n00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:09.110\ncontract management information system.\n\n416\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:13.120\nAnd well, very similar to our customer\nagreement portfolio where we keep our\n\n417\n00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.660\nservice level agreements, our supplier and\ncontract management information system\n\n418\n00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.870\nis where we keep our contracts,\nfunnily enough.\n\n419\n00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:26.473\nAnd all of the performance reviews that\nwe conduct on our suppliers as well.\n\n420\n00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:32.740\nSo as it says in the bottom here,\nthe pipeline is fed by the strategy.\n\n421\n00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:38.040\nIt looks at having good service design,\n\n422\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:43.990\nit looks at having continual\nservice improvement as an input,\n\n423\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.260\nin other words we know how our\nservices are being designed, and\n\n424\n00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:51.650\nCSI recommends new opportunities for\n\n425\n00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:56.640\nimprovement, and therefore new\nservices this is potentially, okay?\n\n426\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:03.910\nWe also in our service pipeline\nwill have a, I guess a field,\n\n427\n00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:08.600\nfor want of a better word, I would\nuse the word field, where we document\n\n428\n00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.540\nnot only how much budget we'll need for\nany new service but also the expected,\n\n429\n00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:19.130\nintended ROI, that's what we call the pre\nprogram ROI for any new service, okay.\n\n430\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:23.390\nSo our pipeline is our representative\nof our overall health,\n\n431\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.500\nbecause it displays what new\nideas we're coming up with.\n\n432\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.020\nIf we've got nothing in our pipeline, if\nwe've got no ideas, then that suggests to\n\n433\n00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:39.010\nme that overall we don't really\nknow what our services are about,\n\n434\n00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:44.640\nwhat our service management is doing and\nwe don't really understand our business.\n\n435\n00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.660\nIf we don't have any ideas to\nmeet the needs of our business.\n\n436\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.810\nNow I've had people that have\nturned around to me and said,\n\n437\n00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:52.870\nwell if we've got no\nideas in our pipeline,\n\n438\n00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.510\nthen that means we're all ready\nmeeting the needs of the business.\n\n439\n00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.900\nIf a business wants to grow and\nwe don't have any new ideas to help\n\n440\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.430\nfacilitate that then we're\ncertainly not meeting their needs.\n\n441\n00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.475\nAnd of course I already asked\nRonnie the trick question.\n\n442\n00:27:09.475 --> 00:27:12.230\n[LAUGHTER] How do we\ncome up with our ideas?\n\n443\n00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.340\nAnd I said anybody can\ncome up with an idea.\n\n444\n00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.020\nAbsolutely anybody.\n\n445\n00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.460\nIt can be customary requests,\n\n446\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.850\nit can be under served business outcomes,\nit can be new technology.\n\n447\n00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.840\nAbsolutely anybody can\ncome up with our ideas.\n\n448\n00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:32.270\nSo what I'd like you to do is at\nthe moment we have just taken a look\n\n449\n00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.440\nat the service portfolio and from a very,\n\n450\n00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.740\nvery high level and now we've just\ntaken a look at service pipeline.\n\n451\n00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:46.820\nAnd I would just like you just to\nreview these particular notes and\n\n452\n00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:52.740\ntake a look at the exercises that are in\nthe materials that you have downloaded.\n\n453\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.090\nIn our next episode, we're going to\nbe taking a look, in more detail,\n\n454\n00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:57.620\nat the service catalog,\n\n455\n00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:01.480\nwhich of course we take a look at\nin great detail in service design.\n\n456\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.900\nBut in our next episode, we're gonna\nbe expanding on the service catalog and\n\n457\n00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.500\nalso on the retired services section.\n\n458\n00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.450\nOf our service portfolio.\n\n459\n00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.860\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well, thank you again for\nhelping us out in understanding\n\n460\n00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.770\nwhat the service portfolio really\ngives us that ability to do.\n\n461\n00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.700\nTo be able to have that pipeline,\nas well as our catalog of services and\n\n462\n00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.880\neven the retired items that we\nalso have to think about too.\n\n463\n00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.630\nAll that provides for\nour company of course.\n\n464\n00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.240\nA great deal of information that\nwe want to have available and\n\n465\n00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.980\nthe language that is normally\ngoing to be presented, of course,\n\n466\n00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.870\nis the language of people that\nare going to use those services too.\n\n467\n00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.200\nThere's a lot more that's actually right\nthere, and there's a lot more to come.\n\n468\n00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.450\nThis is a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n469\n00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:50.480\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n470\n00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

00:00:06.627\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.627 --> 00:00:08.168\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.168 --> 00:00:12.293\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.293 --> 00:00:15.770\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.840\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.150\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n9\n00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.140\nand we're taking a look at a part\ntwo on service portfolio management.\n\n10\n00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.446\nAnd here to help us out is going to be,\nwell, our ITL regent herself, Mrs.\n\n11\n00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:31.290\nJo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.262\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.767\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Ronnie, I'm pleased to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo, as we continue on to take\n\n15\n00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.440\na look at this particular part two,\nwe've already reviewed a little bit of\n\n16\n00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.730\nthe concepts in our previous part one\non the server's portfolio management.\n\n17\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.550\nSo where are we picking up today.\n\n18\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so yeah, as you said,\nwe looked at service portfolio as a whole,\n\n19\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.280\nthe fact that it's a database or\nstructured document.\n\n20\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.690\nIf it's spreadsheet in\nits simplest format.\n\n21\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.029\nAnd we looked at the pipeline and\nthe pipeline being our list of ideas for\n\n22\n00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.982\nnew services.\n\n23\n00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:09.050\nAnd now we're going to take\na look at the catalog itself.\n\n24\n00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.620\nNow the service catalog,\n\n25\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.220\nwe're going to cover in a lot more depth\nwhen we look in service design, in\n\n26\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.220\nservice catalog management, but then we're\nalso gonna look at our retired services.\n\n27\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.980\nNow again, we've already covered this from\na very high level so we're just really\n\n28\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.180\ngoing to reiterate everything that\nwe covered in the previous episode.\n\n29\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.440\nAnd then look at some more influences and\nwhere we get some of our information from\n\n30\n00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.960\nthat actually helps us\npopulate our portfolio.\n\n31\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, so let's go ahead and\ndive into that idea again.\n\n32\n00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.814\nSo when we took a look, and\n\n33\n00:01:40.814 --> 00:01:44.504\nwhen you described the idea\nof the portfolio itself,\n\n34\n00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:50.338\nwe had talked about the pipeline, and then\nthe catalog, and the retired services.\n\n35\n00:01:50.338 --> 00:01:52.270\nWhatever we want to call it there.\n\n36\n00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.810\nSo now we're gonna pick\nup at the catalog part.\n\n37\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.320\nSo, Jo, help us out here.\n\n38\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.688\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, I'm just gonna quickly\nshow you just something that we covered\n\n39\n00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:03.676\nvery, very briefly in\nthe last particular episode.\n\n40\n00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:06.038\nBecause this is just to refresh your mind.\n\n41\n00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:10.752\nYou know our portfolio is made up three\nparts, so think of it as a database.\n\n42\n00:02:10.752 --> 00:02:12.450\nIt's the easy way to think of it.\n\n43\n00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.065\nThink of it as your pipeline which\nare your ideas for your new services.\n\n44\n00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:21.011\nThe catalogs, which services are we\ncurrently are either developing,\n\n45\n00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:25.712\nso they have a release date or\nare currently in production right now,\n\n46\n00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.990\nin our live environment.\n\n47\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.600\nAnd our retired services,\nthose services that have retired.\n\n48\n00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.198\nAnd then of course we understand the\ncomponents of each of those services from\n\n49\n00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:41.093\nour configuration management system,\nthat's where we find that information.\n\n50\n00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:45.439\nAnd then we have inputs into our\nconfiguration management system from our\n\n51\n00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:50.080\ncustomer portfolio or application\nportfolio, SCMIS, as we like to call it.\n\n52\n00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.250\nThat's an abbreviation and\nI much prefer the acronym.\n\n53\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.050\nAnd our customer agreement portfolio and\nour project portfolio and\n\n54\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.970\nour databases as well,\nour configuration management databases.\n\n55\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.780\nSo let's take a look then,\nwe looked at the service pipeline in\n\n56\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.710\nour previous episode,\nlet's take a look at the catalog.\n\n57\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.730\nNow, as I've already said, this is\nwhere we display our live services and\n\n58\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.750\nthose that are currently in development,\nokay?\n\n59\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.460\nSo it includes all sorts of information\nabout the actual service itself.\n\n60\n00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.521\nThis is where we articulate the service\n\n61\n00:03:22.521 --> 00:03:26.891\nin terms of value that it\ndelivers to the organization.\n\n62\n00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:29.532\nNow in our pipeline,\nwe came up with the idea and\n\n63\n00:03:29.532 --> 00:03:34.050\nwe articulate the service in terms\nof value to the organization there.\n\n64\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.660\nAnd that's where we go\nto the business case.\n\n65\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.270\nWe go to the board in order to get\napproval for the business case.\n\n66\n00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.041\nAnd once it's been approved,\nit then is a project.\n\n67\n00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:47.722\nWe start it as a project and\nit becomes part of the service catalog.\n\n68\n00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:53.240\nNow at this point in time, we're evolving\nthat description of that service.\n\n69\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.474\nBecause we know what we want you\nto articulate in the pipeline, but\n\n70\n00:03:56.474 --> 00:03:58.052\nthings might change slightly.\n\n71\n00:03:58.052 --> 00:04:03.411\nAnd during design and transition,\nservices quite often get a little tweak or\n\n72\n00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:07.698\ntwo or they quite often maybe\nwill add in some functionality or\n\n73\n00:04:07.698 --> 00:04:11.840\nwe might remove some\nfunctionality based on testing.\n\n74\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.205\nSo we're still evolving that description\nof that service in the catalog.\n\n75\n00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.855\nNow some service providers,\nas it says, have a lot of customers so\n\n76\n00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:25.830\nthere may be more than one service catalog\nthat's actually being projected from\n\n77\n00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.130\nthe service portfolios.\n\n78\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.700\nSo we might have one pipeline but\n\n79\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.190\nwe might have many service catalogs\ncoming off that one pipeline.\n\n80\n00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.220\nSo let's take a look at a diagram here\nthat shows a little bit more about\n\n81\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.520\ninteraction.\n\n82\n00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.970\nNow, the service catalog is\nwhat we have in the middle,\n\n83\n00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.610\nnow we've got a dark green and\na light green.\n\n84\n00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.180\nAnd just something that's noteworthy here,\n\n85\n00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.460\nthe ITIL publications\nare all in a specific color.\n\n86\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.730\nAnd if you look at the ITIL publications,\nyou'll see that service strategy\n\n87\n00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.501\nis green and you'll see that\nservice design is kind of a lilac,\n\n88\n00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:08.210\npinky, purple-type thing.\n\n89\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.970\nAnyway, they all have a distinct color and\n\n90\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.780\nall of the diagrams are in\nthat distinct color.\n\n91\n00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.590\nSo, it's very easy for\nsomebody like me, but also for you now.\n\n92\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.720\nIf you see a diagram that's\nin a specific color,\n\n93\n00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.170\nthat tells you what\npublication it's come from.\n\n94\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.150\nAnd in this instance, this one's come\nright out of the service strategy book.\n\n95\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.970\nThere we go.\n\n96\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.500\nA little piece of trivia there for\nyou, that will actually help you.\n\n97\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.210\nSo the service catalog in the middle then,\nthis is a structured database.\n\n98\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.080\nNow, what I want you to take a look\nat is we've got the pale green and\n\n99\n00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.910\nthe darker green in the service catalog.\n\n100\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.670\nPale green is the customer view of\nthe services, that's what they see.\n\n101\n00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.590\nBut we might see different\nattributes to a service.\n\n102\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.497\nSo what we see then are maybe\nthese supporting services and\n\n103\n00:05:56.497 --> 00:06:00.894\nwe'll also see, if we move further\nover tot he left-hand side.\n\n104\n00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:05.609\nWe'll also see in IT what we call\nthe technical view of the service catalog,\n\n105\n00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:09.145\nwhich are the supporting services and\nthe assets, etc,\n\n106\n00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:12.270\nthat are used to deliver that service.\n\n107\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.580\nNow the customer only sees the pale green.\n\n108\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.241\nA customer doesn't need to\nsee everything underneath.\n\n109\n00:06:19.241 --> 00:06:24.166\nHowever, the ownership for the service\ncatalog, or rather the ownership for\n\n110\n00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:27.822\nthe information on any given\nservice within the catalog,\n\n111\n00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:29.695\nlies with the service owner.\n\n112\n00:06:29.695 --> 00:06:33.784\nBut business relationship\nmanagement takes ownership for\n\n113\n00:06:33.784 --> 00:06:38.290\nthe translation of business\noutcomes into the services.\n\n114\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.990\nIn other words,\nhere we are in our portfolio and\n\n115\n00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.850\nwe're looking to quantify our services.\n\n116\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.270\nWe're looking to identify new\nopportunities, but we're looking to\n\n117\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.540\ndo that and articulate the service in\nterms of what it means to the business.\n\n118\n00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.610\nSo business relationship management help\nus with that, that's what this means.\n\n119\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.350\nBusiness relationship management\nwill quantify the outcomes that\n\n120\n00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.310\nwe need to achieve.\n\n121\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.040\nOkay, now Service Catalog\nhelps us identify\n\n122\n00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.240\nopportunities in the marketplace\nby just simply being there.\n\n123\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.592\nWe can list our services and then we\ncan see which services are missing.\n\n124\n00:07:15.592 --> 00:07:17.080\nAnd of course, demand for\n\n125\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.146\nservices is created every time\na customer wants to achieve an outcome.\n\n126\n00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:26.165\nThen there's a need for a service there,\nand demand management will help us to\n\n127\n00:07:26.165 --> 00:07:32.310\nidentify any services that are missing as\nwell as business relationship management.\n\n128\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.942\nSo this next slide then, well,\nthat expands on the previous slides.\n\n129\n00:07:36.942 --> 00:07:40.702\nSo things are exactly the same\nas on the previous one and\n\n130\n00:07:40.702 --> 00:07:45.608\nthat we got our customer facing services\nin there in the light green here\n\n131\n00:07:45.608 --> 00:07:48.831\nwhere I find my cursor\nhere in the light green.\n\n132\n00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:53.556\nNow, you'll see that we've categorized\nthese in terms of popular services,\n\n133\n00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:58.704\nin terms of viable services, In other\nwords, they're viable, they're relevant,\n\n134\n00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:03.640\nbut they're not necessarily popular and\nthen we have services to retire as well.\n\n135\n00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.538\nServices to retire are those that for\nwhatever reason are no longer either\n\n136\n00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:13.120\nviable or maybe they're just well\ntechnically not very advanced and\n\n137\n00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.321\nthey no longer supported for\nit since they no longer required.\n\n138\n00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:22.660\nYou see that we've also categorised\ndifferent sources of demand here.\n\n139\n00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.680\nSo well serve demand in this instances\nthat we've got popular services and\n\n140\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.920\nwe've got some well served demand there.\n\n141\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.300\nBut then we grow viable services that\nmake going to the underserved demand.\n\n142\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.254\nIn other words they're viable services but\n\n143\n00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:38.902\nthey're not quite meeting\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n144\n00:08:38.902 --> 00:08:43.155\nAnd then we've got retired services\nif they're retired then hopefully\n\n145\n00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:47.640\nthey're not meeting any needs\nbecause they're being retired.\n\n146\n00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.140\nAnd we'll categorize the penny services\nhere as well in exactly the same way.\n\n147\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.310\nWe'll do exactly the same with our assets.\n\n148\n00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.231\nBecause we'll work out, and again, we did\nthis earlier on in a previous episode in\n\n149\n00:09:00.231 --> 00:09:03.888\nservice strategy,\nworking out what assets and what skills,\n\n150\n00:09:03.888 --> 00:09:08.490\ndon't forget our assets,\nour capabilities, as well as resources.\n\n151\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.014\nSo we'll look at what assets we\nneed to be able to deliver those\n\n152\n00:09:13.014 --> 00:09:16.244\nservices that facilitate those outcomes.\n\n153\n00:09:18.513 --> 00:09:23.424\nSo our retired services section then\nfrom our service portfolio, well,\n\n154\n00:09:23.424 --> 00:09:27.280\nand that's those services\nthat are being retired.\n\n155\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.282\nAnd in a previous episode, Ronnie asked\nwhy we would retire a service and\n\n156\n00:09:32.282 --> 00:09:36.059\nwhy we would keep the information\nabout that service.\n\n157\n00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:41.567\nAnd there can be a 101 different reasons\nas to why we would keep that information.\n\n158\n00:09:41.567 --> 00:09:46.114\nBut we definitely keep that information\nbecause maybe those legislative,\n\n159\n00:09:46.114 --> 00:09:47.895\nI still cannot say that word.\n\n160\n00:09:47.895 --> 00:09:50.610\nThere's legislative requirements.\n\n161\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.650\nAnd maybe there's ethical requirements.\n\n162\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.390\nOr maybe it's just a good\nday to retention policy.\n\n163\n00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.397\nNevertheless we will and take a look\nat the previous episode if you want to\n\n164\n00:10:00.397 --> 00:10:02.641\nexplore some of those reasons further.\n\n165\n00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:08.910\nBut we will keep information\nabout our retired service okay.\n\n166\n00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.690\nHowever, we always need to\ncapture what we call the reasons\n\n167\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.380\nwhy we retired something\nin our knowledge base.\n\n168\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.285\nJust in case we need to either\nascertain why we retired it, or\n\n169\n00:10:20.285 --> 00:10:24.048\nmaybe we might look to bring\nsomething back in the future.\n\n170\n00:10:24.048 --> 00:10:28.730\nAnd we want to see whether those\nconditions still exist or not okay.\n\n171\n00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.690\nSo now in these next few slides,\nwe're just going to recap over a previous\n\n172\n00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:38.736\nepisode, where we looked at, and\nI'm just going to move this slide back.\n\n173\n00:10:38.736 --> 00:10:43.327\nAnd we looked at these influences,\nthese inputs,\n\n174\n00:10:43.327 --> 00:10:46.710\ninto the service portfolio itself.\n\n175\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.790\nSo you see we have our\nconfiguration management system,\n\n176\n00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.720\nwe have our customer portfolio,\nwe have application portfolio and\n\n177\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.750\nour supply on contract management\ninformation system, etc, etc.\n\n178\n00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:03.370\nSo we're just gonna expand on each one\nof those and just explain what they are.\n\n179\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.412\nWe've already done this\nin a previous episode, so\n\n180\n00:11:06.412 --> 00:11:10.315\nthis is just a recap of what we\ncovered in our last episode really.\n\n181\n00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:14.697\nSo let's take a look at our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n182\n00:11:14.697 --> 00:11:19.804\nAs I've already said, a configuration\nmanagement system is where we\n\n183\n00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:25.180\nstore all of the configuration items,\nof the components of our service.\n\n184\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.681\nNow, a configuration management system\ncan be made up of many databases,\n\n185\n00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:35.335\nwhat we call relational or\nfederated databases,\n\n186\n00:11:35.335 --> 00:11:40.739\nwhere if we update an entry in one\ndatabase then it will update that entry.\n\n187\n00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:46.608\nAll documents, records relating to\nthat entry in other databases as well.\n\n188\n00:11:46.608 --> 00:11:50.047\nThe key to configuration management\nis the word relationships.\n\n189\n00:11:50.047 --> 00:11:54.648\nThat's that word that's right next to\nwhere you can see me in the Bottom line on\n\n190\n00:11:54.648 --> 00:11:56.264\nthe corner of your screen.\n\n191\n00:11:56.264 --> 00:11:59.800\nAlthough not anymore it's down\nat the bottom of your screen.\n\n192\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.237\nIt's that word relationship\nthat's really important.\n\n193\n00:12:03.237 --> 00:12:07.000\nBecause it's not just about\nindividual sources of data.\n\n194\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.253\nCuz on their own they don't\nreally tell us that much.\n\n195\n00:12:10.253 --> 00:12:15.930\nIt's about how these components\nof these services hang together.\n\n196\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.610\nI want to introduce the concept\nof shared components.\n\n197\n00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:25.330\nBecause you say, if I consider\nmy email service for instance.\n\n198\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.630\nWell, what do I need to be able\nto send and receive an email?\n\n199\n00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.155\nWell I need some software.\n\n200\n00:12:32.155 --> 00:12:35.030\nAnd we automatically think about Outlook.\n\n201\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.450\nWe automatically think, well, I need\nMicrosoft to send and receive email.\n\n202\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.835\nBut I need more than that.\n\n203\n00:12:39.835 --> 00:12:43.305\nI need a lot more than that to be\nable to send and receive email.\n\n204\n00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:46.581\nRonnie, do you have any idea what\nwe need to send and receive email?\n\n205\n00:12:46.581 --> 00:12:49.130\n&gt;&gt; This is a trick question again,\nI can feel it.\n\n206\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know that we need electricity\n\n207\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.072\nthis time.\n\n208\n00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.731\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:57.591\n&gt;&gt; We of course need that we need senders\n\n210\n00:12:57.591 --> 00:13:03.036\nand receivers, we of course need\nthe ability to have a device at the end\n\n211\n00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:08.230\nthere to either send or\nreceive the mail itself to, some servers.\n\n212\n00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.663\nI'm trying to think if\nthere's anything else.\n\n213\n00:13:10.663 --> 00:13:13.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't trick Ronnie into\n\n214\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.553\nthis, honest.\n\n215\n00:13:14.553 --> 00:13:16.153\n&gt;&gt; Okay. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; No,\nthis wasn't a trick,\n\n216\n00:13:16.153 --> 00:13:17.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:18.668\n&gt;&gt; And I didn't prime him either.\n\n218\n00:13:18.668 --> 00:13:21.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we have some components of\n\n219\n00:13:21.246 --> 00:13:24.610\nservice, okay, and\nwe do have a defined list of components.\n\n220\n00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:30.070\nAnd, what we'll say is that without any\none of these components then you can't\n\n221\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.670\ndeliver the value to the business.\n\n222\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.432\nSo we cannot facilitate an outcome.\n\n223\n00:13:34.432 --> 00:13:37.828\nSince the outcome I want to facilitate\njust to send them receive email,\n\n224\n00:13:37.828 --> 00:13:39.690\nthen I need some software.\n\n225\n00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.454\nAnd I need some hardware.\n\n226\n00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:42.614\nAnd I'm not just talking about a PC,\n\n227\n00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:46.975\nI also have probably need maybe\nexchange servers other servers etc.\n\n228\n00:13:46.975 --> 00:13:50.545\nI also need things like routers or\nrouters you know,\n\n229\n00:13:50.545 --> 00:13:54.105\nto be able to manage the network so\nI need an infrastructure as well.\n\n230\n00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:54.905\nI need a network.\n\n231\n00:13:56.015 --> 00:13:57.624\nI also need people.\n\n232\n00:13:57.624 --> 00:14:02.218\nI need people to not only configure and\nsupport the service but\n\n233\n00:14:02.218 --> 00:14:06.295\nalso to configure and\nsupport my desktop or my laptop.\n\n234\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.854\nYes I need electricity, okay?\n\n235\n00:14:09.854 --> 00:14:11.966\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I need to have what we call\n\n236\n00:14:11.966 --> 00:14:14.020\nenvironmental aspects, okay?\n\n237\n00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.002\nWithout electricity I can't send and\nreceive my email.\n\n238\n00:14:19.002 --> 00:14:22.891\nMy battery only is not gonna last for\nso long, but more than that,\n\n239\n00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:24.745\nI need somewhere to sit right?\n\n240\n00:14:24.745 --> 00:14:27.105\nI can't stand all day okay?\n\n241\n00:14:27.105 --> 00:14:30.065\nI need to have a desk to put my laptop on,\nbecause otherwise,\n\n242\n00:14:30.065 --> 00:14:31.625\nmy arms are gonna get pretty tired.\n\n243\n00:14:32.715 --> 00:14:37.366\nI also need documentation and by\ndocumentation I mean contracts suppliers\n\n244\n00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:41.076\nsuch as service providers,\ninternet service providers.\n\n245\n00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:46.905\nAnd I also need contracts and training\ndocumentation as well with other service\n\n246\n00:14:46.905 --> 00:14:52.340\nproviders and also with our suppliers\nthat will come in and train me too.\n\n247\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.320\nNow I expect any training\nto be documented, and\n\n248\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.140\npretty much the same way as you can\ndownload materials here, I expect all of\n\n249\n00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.440\nour training to be documented so\ntherefore, we need documentation as well.\n\n250\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.436\nAnd without any single one of those\ncomponents we can't send or receive email.\n\n251\n00:15:08.436 --> 00:15:13.400\nBut then with the configuration management\nsystem, it actually allows us to tie these\n\n252\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:19.150\ncomponents together because guess what,\nthese components aren't unique to email.\n\n253\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.630\nI don't have one PC for email,\nand then another PC for\n\n254\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:27.550\nthe internet, and then another PC for\noffice no, I have one PC, and\n\n255\n00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.590\nI share that component across\nall of those services.\n\n256\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.217\nI don't have one infrastructure,\none network for email and another one for\n\n257\n00:15:34.217 --> 00:15:37.401\nthe internet and another one for\nmy financial management system.\n\n258\n00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:38.714\nNo, I have one network.\n\n259\n00:15:38.714 --> 00:15:42.250\nSo my components are shared.\n\n260\n00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.530\nAnd configuration management well,\nit allows me.\n\n261\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.231\nIf I take a look back at\nthis particular diagram,\n\n262\n00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:54.213\nit allows me to see what assets\nare used to deliver what services.\n\n263\n00:15:54.213 --> 00:15:56.987\nBearing in mind that\nsome of these are shared.\n\n264\n00:15:56.987 --> 00:16:01.085\nLet's take a look at it, if I can find my\ncursor again Let's take a look at this\n\n265\n00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:05.520\nparticular asset here, which is shared\nacross three supporting services.\n\n266\n00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.230\nAnd then if I take a look at\nthis supporting service, well,\n\n267\n00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.110\nthat one is applicable to there.\n\n268\n00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:16.190\nBut it's also applicable to\nthis particular service here,\n\n269\n00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:21.040\nand this particular service\nuses three supporting services.\n\n270\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.520\nAnd they all use this\nparticular service asset.\n\n271\n00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:30.240\nThis configuration management is going\nto tell me how they hang together.\n\n272\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.640\nThat's what it's going to do.\n\n273\n00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.685\nIt's gonna give me that overall\npicture of my component.\n\n274\n00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:39.365\nNow my service portfolio and my component\nconfiguration management system are part\n\n275\n00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:44.325\nof what we'll call our SKMS, which is\nour service management knowledge system.\n\n276\n00:16:44.325 --> 00:16:46.785\nAnd if we take a look\nat service transition,\n\n277\n00:16:46.785 --> 00:16:50.445\nwe'll see knowledge management has\na process and service transition and\n\n278\n00:16:50.445 --> 00:16:53.559\nyou'll see more about our service\nmanagement acknowledgement system.\n\n279\n00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.990\nSo then we have another input into\nour service portfolio, and that's our\n\n280\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:05.160\napplication portfolio, which is simply\na database of all of our applications.\n\n281\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.925\nNow, our applications, as I've already\nsaid, Microsoft Outlook is not a service.\n\n282\n00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:14.105\nMicrosoft Outlook is an application.\n\n283\n00:17:14.105 --> 00:17:15.075\nSimple as that.\n\n284\n00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:20.065\nSo we will have a portfolio\nof all of our applications.\n\n285\n00:17:20.065 --> 00:17:20.685\nOkay.\nAnd\n\n286\n00:17:20.685 --> 00:17:24.215\nthat includes sort of tracking\nthe investments in our application.\n\n287\n00:17:24.215 --> 00:17:27.785\nVery similar to the portfolio\nitself of services\n\n288\n00:17:27.785 --> 00:17:31.715\nthat will just track an application\nthrough it's life cycle.\n\n289\n00:17:31.715 --> 00:17:35.540\nAnd of course through\nthe configuration management system,\n\n290\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:40.790\nwe can track which services\nuse which applications.\n\n291\n00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.930\nAnd then we have a customer portfolio and\n\n292\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.320\na customer agreement portfolio and\nthe customer portfolio,\n\n293\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.680\nyou might call that a CRM database, your\ncustomer relationship management database.\n\n294\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.876\nIt's a simple list of\nwho are customers are.\n\n295\n00:17:54.876 --> 00:17:58.280\nThey could be internal,\nthey could be external and\n\n296\n00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.290\nwhat agreements we have\nin place with each one.\n\n297\n00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.958\nSo they are service level agreements and\nof course in our service level of\n\n298\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.859\nagreements then we also have\nour service level targets.\n\n299\n00:18:08.859 --> 00:18:13.308\nOkay, so that's what's contained\nin our customer portfolio.\n\n300\n00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:17.700\nNow we will learn more about service level\nagreements in service design when we look\n\n301\n00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.340\nat service level management.\n\n302\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.350\nWe also have project portfolio.\n\n303\n00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:27.010\nAnd a project portfolio is tied very\ntightly to our service pipeline.\n\n304\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:32.910\nAnd the transition from pipeline\ninto the service catalogue\n\n305\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.810\nbecause these are our projects and our\nprojects are obviously our new services.\n\n306\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:43.464\nSo in the pipeline, well in the pipeline\nwe identify what ideas we have and\n\n307\n00:18:43.464 --> 00:18:49.913\nthen a business case is approved, and once\nthat business case has been approved it's\n\n308\n00:18:49.913 --> 00:18:55.736\nat that point in time Is that we raise\nthe projects so the projects starts to and\n\n309\n00:18:55.736 --> 00:18:59.976\ndesign and build and\nI start to implement a new service.\n\n310\n00:18:59.976 --> 00:19:04.866\nOkay so of course the transition\ninto to a project portfolio for\n\n311\n00:19:04.866 --> 00:19:10.690\nany service is, well,\ndependent on what's in the pipeline, okay?\n\n312\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:14.330\nAnd of course the project portfolio\nwill allow us to determine the projects\n\n313\n00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.680\naren't duplicated.\n\n314\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.720\nAnd that we are working\njust on one service that\n\n315\n00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.380\nfacilitates one business outcome.\n\n316\n00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.165\nThis is very very important,\nespecially for large scale organizations.\n\n317\n00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:30.440\n'Cause it's very feasible and\nin fact, I've seen this happen where\n\n318\n00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:36.610\nan international organization has had two\nprojects running at exactly the same time,\n\n319\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:42.420\nboth of them having posing or\nconflicting objectives.\n\n320\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.350\nBut where the project portfolio\ndidn't exist across the globe,\n\n321\n00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.560\nthen unfortunately,\nthere was a duplication of effort and\n\n322\n00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.860\ntherefore a lot of money wasted.\n\n323\n00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.920\nAnd so it's very important that we have\nthe synergy between our pipeline and\n\n324\n00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.200\nour project portfolio.\n\n325\n00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.567\nNow our service models, as I mentioned in\nprevious episodes, where we looked in more\n\n326\n00:20:04.567 --> 00:20:08.467\ndetail at a service model,\nwhere we map out those moments of truth.\n\n327\n00:20:08.467 --> 00:20:13.099\nAnd we also map out the components\nthat are required to deliver each\n\n328\n00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:15.130\nparticular service.\n\n329\n00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.207\nWell, we're going to utilize\nexisting service models,\n\n330\n00:20:18.207 --> 00:20:22.537\ncuz that will help us define moments of\ntruth for our new services, but we're also\n\n331\n00:20:22.537 --> 00:20:26.827\ngoing to map out the moments of truths and\nthe models for our new services as well.\n\n332\n00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:31.638\nAnd this helps us identify any\ngaps as well that we may have in\n\n333\n00:20:31.638 --> 00:20:36.162\nnot just in our strategy but\nalso in our existing project\n\n334\n00:20:36.162 --> 00:20:40.784\nportfolio itself because we\nmight have a requirement for\n\n335\n00:20:40.784 --> 00:20:45.290\na new service say to process payments for\ninstance.\n\n336\n00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.640\nSo we had in a previous episode\nwhere we looked at service models\n\n337\n00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.260\nwe followed the process through of\npurchasing something online and\n\n338\n00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.970\nyou'll notice that we went off to a third\nparty the two process payments and\n\n339\n00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.780\nwe off to another third party\nto handle the shipping.\n\n340\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.505\nNow that might be a gap.\n\n341\n00:21:04.505 --> 00:21:07.975\nWe might ascertain that having\ngone through the model for\n\n342\n00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:10.775\na new service that\nactually we've got a gap.\n\n343\n00:21:10.775 --> 00:21:13.865\nAnd we may look to a third\nparty to fulfill that gap, or\n\n344\n00:21:13.865 --> 00:21:17.725\nwe may actually try and\nfill the gap ourselves.\n\n345\n00:21:17.725 --> 00:21:19.725\nSo actually, modeling out or\n\n346\n00:21:19.725 --> 00:21:23.305\nmapping out a service will really\nhelp us identify any gaps.\n\n347\n00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.300\nNow we mentioned market spaces and\nservice growth here, and\n\n348\n00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.350\nidentifying our market spaces.\n\n349\n00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:38.470\nWe need to be able to identify market\nspaces in order identify services\n\n350\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.080\nto fill them.\n\n351\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:45.338\nBut If we look at our existing catalog,\nour existing catalog will\n\n352\n00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:50.335\nhelp us identify were we have gaps\nwhere we don't have a service.\n\n353\n00:21:50.335 --> 00:21:53.230\nBecause our catalog tells us\nwhat services we already have.\n\n354\n00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:59.462\nBusiness relationship management is\ngoing to help us a huge deal with this.\n\n355\n00:21:59.462 --> 00:22:03.955\nOkay, business relationship management\nis that translation between IT and\n\n356\n00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:04.940\nthe business.\n\n357\n00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.440\nAnd business relationship\nmanagement understands\n\n358\n00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.330\nthe outcomes that the business\nneeds to facilitate.\n\n359\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.730\nAnd they also understand\nthe business strategy.\n\n360\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.390\nSo business relationship management\nwill help us identify market spaces.\n\n361\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.850\nSo, we will look at what services we\ncurrently offer in our service catalog.\n\n362\n00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:31.950\nAnd it's the gap in those services that,\nwell, outlines where we\n\n363\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:37.040\nneed to fill that gap, as it were,\nand what services we need to put in.\n\n364\n00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.700\nSo, in other words, what market spaces and\nwhat opportunities we have.\n\n365\n00:22:42.806 --> 00:22:47.629\nService portfolio management is,\nwell, as it says there,\n\n366\n00:22:47.629 --> 00:22:52.710\ncrucial for\naligning our assets with our outcomes.\n\n367\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.700\nAnd we've looked in previous episodes and\nwe looked at the diagrams in\n\n368\n00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:02.200\nthis particular episode,\nthat really showed, very simply, how we\n\n369\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:08.850\nmap our assets within IT to the outcomes\nthat the business wants to facilitate.\n\n370\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.190\nThat they want us to facilitate.\n\n371\n00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.079\nSo it's real important, really important\nthat we understand our skills.\n\n372\n00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.510\nThat we understand what capabilities and\nwhat resources we have.\n\n373\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:24.130\nAnd, that we understand what\ncapabilities our customers have.\n\n374\n00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:31.090\nAnd, also, how they all map to\nthe outcomes that they need facilitated.\n\n375\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:36.030\nAnd, portfolio management helps us\nto do that very simply by giving us\n\n376\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.980\na structured document and\na list of all of our services.\n\n377\n00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:44.796\nAnd also, all of the outcomes\nthat we are facilitating\n\n378\n00:23:44.796 --> 00:23:49.402\nbecause don't forget,\nevery single service in our\n\n379\n00:23:49.402 --> 00:23:54.760\nportfolio is articulated in\nterms of value to the business.\n\n380\n00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.430\nAnd all of the relationships between all\nof the components of those services, well,\n\n381\n00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.720\nthey'll be found in\na configuration management system.\n\n382\n00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.679\nNow, one of the things that\nI do want to mention and\n\n383\n00:24:06.679 --> 00:24:11.554\nit's part of knowledge management but\nits about efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n384\n00:24:11.554 --> 00:24:15.780\nAnd we want to be efficient and\neffective within ITIL.\n\n385\n00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.940\nAnd it's never efficient and\nit's certainly never gonna be effective\n\n386\n00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.740\nto have duplicate data\nsources with duplicate data.\n\n387\n00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:30.240\nBecause if I have data and Ronnie has\ndata who is it who has the accurate data?\n\n388\n00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.450\nBecause you see I could change one field\nin a database and Ronnie could change\n\n389\n00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:40.540\nanother field in a database and now we've\ngot to join the two together somehow.\n\n390\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:45.100\nSo knowledge management ensures that we\nhave the relationships in place between\n\n391\n00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.140\nall of our data sources so\nthat if I change the field in a database\n\n392\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.450\nit'll automatically change\nthe field in Ronnie's database.\n\n393\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.500\nAnd if Ronnie changes something in his,\n\n394\n00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.830\nit'll automatically change it in mine and\nthat's key to knowledge management.\n\n395\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:04.393\nAnd so when we say that the information\nabout our components is referred to as\n\n396\n00:25:04.393 --> 00:25:09.101\nconfiguration management system we have\ngot a link from our service portfolio\n\n397\n00:25:09.101 --> 00:25:11.832\ninto our configuration management system.\n\n398\n00:25:11.832 --> 00:25:16.970\nAnd so we are fully assured that\nthe information that we have\n\n399\n00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:24.180\ngot is accurate and is up to date because\nwe know that if it happens any changes.\n\n400\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.350\nThen they're reflected\nin all of our databases.\n\n401\n00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:32.150\nSo at this point in time now, you have\nan excercise to do with the service\n\n402\n00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:37.780\nportfolio, and I am going to ask you to go\naway and take a look at that excercise.\n\n403\n00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.669\nIt will take you about 15-30 minutes and\n\n404\n00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:45.914\nwhen we come back into our next episode,\nwe're going to look at the challenges and\n\n405\n00:25:45.914 --> 00:25:49.655\nthe inputs and\noutputs to service portfolio management.\n\n406\n00:25:49.655 --> 00:25:52.870\n&gt;&gt; Well this is a great place for\nus to sign off then.\n\n407\n00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.260\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n408\n00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n409\n00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.990\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:08.262\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:12.176\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:15.451\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.212\nyou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n7\n00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:21.459\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n8\n00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:26.040\nwe're diving into a part 3 on\nservice portfolio management.\n\n9\n00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.650\nAnd here to help us with the rounding out\nof complete knowledge here on our service\n\n10\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.495\nportfolio management is gonna be well\nour ITIL countess herself Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:36.890\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.041\n&gt;&gt; Thanks very much Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:42.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right Jo,\nwe've taken a look at a lot of information\n\n14\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.390\nin the past couple of episodes\non service portfolio management.\n\n15\n00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.820\nThere can't be a lot left, but\n\n16\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.630\njust when I say that Jo,\nyou kind of really surprised me.\n\n17\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.176\nBut let's talk about what is actually\nleft for us to take a look at here.\n\n18\n00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:57.562\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well what we're going to do is,\n\n19\n00:00:57.562 --> 00:00:59.377\nwe're actually gonna look\nat the process itself.\n\n20\n00:00:59.377 --> 00:01:00.057\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's different.\n\n21\n00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:03.078\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, I mean we've talked about\nthe elements of the process, and\n\n22\n00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:06.876\nnow we're gonna look at the process itself\n&gt;&gt; And we're going to look at what starts\n\n23\n00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:10.181\noff the process, the triggers,\nthe critical success factors.\n\n24\n00:01:10.181 --> 00:01:15.009\nAnd also the challenges to strategy to\nsorry service portfolio even I don't know\n\n25\n00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.292\nprocess I'm in now.\n\n26\n00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:18.798\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Service portfolio management I think\n\n27\n00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:21.850\nthat's where we are,\nthat's what I'm gonna talk about anyway.\n\n28\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.460\n&gt;&gt; So all right Jo so\nthe idea of the process here right,\n\n29\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.390\nit's the steps that we need to really\npay attention to to help us out.\n\n30\n00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.152\nWhat is it that triggers\nwhat we need to do here?\n\n31\n00:01:32.152 --> 00:01:36.173\n&gt;&gt; Okay well let's take a look at\nthen our slide that we have here.\n\n32\n00:01:36.173 --> 00:01:41.249\nAnd hopefully you have downloaded\nthe material so that you could\n\n33\n00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:46.707\nsee this in a better resolution to\nwhat we have up on the screen there.\n\n34\n00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:51.860\nWhat I really want you to pay attention\nto is the left side, is the process\n\n35\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.202\ninitiation where we, also down the left,\nwhere we initiate the process.\n\n36\n00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.513\nIn other words this is where\nsomebody comes up with an idea.\n\n37\n00:02:00.513 --> 00:02:04.553\nNow it can come up from strategy or\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n38\n00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:07.723\nOr from CSI or maybe another process or\n\n39\n00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:13.930\nmaybe another source from our customer and\nthen we define that idea.\n\n40\n00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.260\nSo we take the idea and\n\n41\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.180\nthe first thing that we are going to do\nis say while is this an existing service?\n\n42\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.370\nIf it is, does it just mean that we\nneed to enhance an existing service?\n\n43\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.700\nIf it's not,\nthen is this a brand new service?\n\n44\n00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.575\nAnd if that's the case, then we need\nto define exactly what the requirements\n\n45\n00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:34.604\nare for that brand new service.\n\n46\n00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:37.636\nSo let's take a look then at\nthe actual process itself.\n\n47\n00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:41.739\nNow you will have this\nparticular diagram in your\n\n48\n00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.954\nmaterials that you have downloaded.\n\n49\n00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:47.676\nAnd what we're really interested\nin is down the left hand side.\n\n50\n00:02:47.676 --> 00:02:52.399\nYou'll see we have process initiation,\ndefine, analyse, and approve.\n\n51\n00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:56.795\nAnd these are the steps that we take\nas part of service portfolio management\n\n52\n00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:57.435\nprocess.\n\n53\n00:02:57.435 --> 00:03:01.920\nI'm gonna try and blow this up a little\nbit for you, so bear with me a moment and\n\n54\n00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.645\nlet's see if we can see that.\n\n55\n00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:05.691\nOkay so here we have then,\n\n56\n00:03:05.691 --> 00:03:10.446\nright at the very top of this process,\nprocess initiation.\n\n57\n00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:13.659\nWhat that means is our ideas,\nwhere do they come from?\n\n58\n00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.654\nWell they can come from\nstrategy management or\n\n59\n00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:20.813\nbusiness relationship management or\nCSI or any other process.\n\n60\n00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:24.409\nThey can come in as a suggestion or\na request for the business or\n\n61\n00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.881\nmaybe we've seen something\noutside in the big wide world.\n\n62\n00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:34.080\nAnd therefore well, it's an idea for\nus in our organization.\n\n63\n00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.737\nSo now we look at,\nwell we're in definition here now.\n\n64\n00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:40.783\nAnd now what we do is we look at\nwhether this is an existing service.\n\n65\n00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:45.747\nAnd if it is, then what's the impact\ngoing to be on our existing service\n\n66\n00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:49.140\nportfolio and\nalso on our existing services?\n\n67\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.700\nDoes this mean an increase\nin functionality?\n\n68\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.856\nNew functionality or does this\nmean a decrease in functionality?\n\n69\n00:03:55.856 --> 00:03:59.543\nIf it's not an existing service\nhere on the right hand side,\n\n70\n00:03:59.543 --> 00:04:04.410\nwell then we've gotta work out exactly\nwhat outcome it is that it facilitates.\n\n71\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.147\nAnd we've gotta work out who our\ncustomers are that are going to be\n\n72\n00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:11.489\nsatisfied by this new service.\n\n73\n00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.956\nWhich means that we'll have to have\ninteraction with our portfolio,\n\n74\n00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:20.752\nour customer portfolio, and\nour contract portfolio etc.\n\n75\n00:04:20.752 --> 00:04:24.067\nSo all of those inputs that we\nlooked at in our previous episode\n\n76\n00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:26.886\nwell we're gonna have to go and\ntake a look at those.\n\n77\n00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:31.672\nAnd see what applications we currently\nhave and what assets we currently have.\n\n78\n00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:35.482\nAnd what that we can use\nthem to meet that need and\n\n79\n00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:40.829\nthen we map out the service model for\nthat particular new service.\n\n80\n00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:45.427\nAnd then we analyse and we articulate\nwhat we call value proportion.\n\n81\n00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:50.590\nAnd this is where we work out whether\nthis is going to be a viable service,\n\n82\n00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.405\nbased on investments and\npriorities and opportunities, etc.\n\n83\n00:04:55.405 --> 00:05:00.370\nAnd so what we'll do is we'll\ndefine that in the business case.\n\n84\n00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.220\nAnd here in the business case,\nwell this is where we analyze whether\n\n85\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.970\nthat service is feasible or whether\nwe can actually retire that service.\n\n86\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.010\nAnd if necessary then we'll\ncreate the change proposal and\n\n87\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.840\nchange management will take\na look at this as well.\n\n88\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.060\nNow I'm always asked about\nthe change proposal and\n\n89\n00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.780\nwe'll cover this more in, when we look at\nservice transition and change management.\n\n90\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.790\nBut the change proposal is a high\nlevel description of a change,\n\n91\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.010\nit's a high level change record.\n\n92\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.000\nAnd it simply is a change record\nthat says nothing more than,\n\n93\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.120\nwe want to replace our current email\nsystem with a web based email system.\n\n94\n00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.235\nDoesn't say anything more than that and\n\n95\n00:05:44.235 --> 00:05:47.850\nthis happens at the same time as\nthe business case goes for approval.\n\n96\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.810\nWhen you think about this it's\nfairly obvious why we do this.\n\n97\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.770\nBut whenever I ask the question\nwhy do you think we do this,\n\n98\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.400\ngenerally I am met with a blank stare.\n\n99\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.950\nBut it really is fairly obvious,\n\n100\n00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.780\nRonnie let me ask you who approves\nthe business case usually?\n\n101\n00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.770\n&gt;&gt; The decision makers.\n\n102\n00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay and who are the decision makers?\n\n103\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.880\n&gt;&gt; That would be the owners, higher CEOs.\n\n104\n00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.873\n&gt;&gt; Right so somebody really senior yes.\n\n105\n00:06:16.873 --> 00:06:19.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay how technical are these people?\n\n106\n00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.100\n&gt;&gt; Not very technical.\n\n107\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.724\n&gt;&gt; Right okay and you've hit the nail on\nthe head Okay this is why we need the high\n\n108\n00:06:25.724 --> 00:06:27.250\nlevel change proposal.\n\n109\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.402\nIt's perfectly feasible,\nthe high level people,\n\n110\n00:06:32.402 --> 00:06:35.860\nthey're not particularly technical.\n\n111\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.500\nAnd they could see a business\ncase that's given to them and\n\n112\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.090\nthere's a problem presented\nin the business case.\n\n113\n00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.410\nWe don't like email, so\n\n114\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.270\nwe want to replace the email with\nthe latest version of the email.\n\n115\n00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.910\nAnd they're all gonna sit around and talk.\n\n116\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.050\nAnd they say, hey that's a great idea\ncuz we don't like the version of email\n\n117\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.370\nthat we have right now.\n\n118\n00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.727\nAnd they'll sign off the business case.\n\n119\n00:06:57.727 --> 00:07:00.788\nIt's also perfectly feasible\nthat they may In a few\n\n120\n00:07:00.788 --> 00:07:05.628\nmonths time seeing another business case\nsaying, hey we don't like e-mails so\n\n121\n00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:09.845\nwe want to replace our e-mail system\nwith a web based e-mail system.\n\n122\n00:07:09.845 --> 00:07:12.263\nAnd they're going to look at that and\ngoing to say,\n\n123\n00:07:12.263 --> 00:07:15.370\nhey yeah that's a great idea and\nthey're going to sign that off.\n\n124\n00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.864\nWe've got two projects,\ntwo conflicting projects and\n\n125\n00:07:18.864 --> 00:07:21.396\nwhen you've got a large organization.\n\n126\n00:07:21.396 --> 00:07:24.290\nAnd as I have said previously\nthis has happened,\n\n127\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.913\nI have seen this happen\nin an organization.\n\n128\n00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:29.614\nYou got a large international\norganization and\n\n129\n00:07:29.614 --> 00:07:33.543\ntwo different project teams that\ncreated jobs in sides of the world.\n\n130\n00:07:33.543 --> 00:07:37.739\nBoth to do an opposing project and\nmillions and\n\n131\n00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:41.296\nI mean millions of dollars are wasted.\n\n132\n00:07:41.296 --> 00:07:45.210\nBecause it's not until we find out,\nwe get actually into the project and\n\n133\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.721\ninto development that we realize that\nwe've got two opposing projects out there.\n\n134\n00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:51.961\nAnd millions of dollars are wasted.\n\n135\n00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:56.558\nSo now, hand in hand with the business\ncase, we raise this high level\n\n136\n00:07:56.558 --> 00:08:00.701\nchange proposal, and\nwe do this as a technical Sanity check.\n\n137\n00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:05.800\nJust so somebody technical can take\na look and say, is this feasible?\n\n138\n00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.650\nIs this something that we can do, or\n\n139\n00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.820\ndo we have something existing that\nis going to conflict with this?\n\n140\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.250\nThat's why we do it, and\nthen when you think about it,\n\n141\n00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.150\nyou think well that makes perfect sense!\n\n142\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.313\nOf course it does,\n\n143\n00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:22.712\nbecause we don't expect the people signing\nour business cases to be technical people.\n\n144\n00:08:22.712 --> 00:08:28.470\nSo once it's been approved, then\nthe service is what we call here charted.\n\n145\n00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.640\nAnd charted means that essentially\nit's given an end date,\n\n146\n00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.480\nit's given a release date,\nit's got the go ahead.\n\n147\n00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.900\nAnd this is where a project is created and\nit goes into the project portfolio and\n\n148\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:46.402\nthen is designed and built,\ntransitioned into the live environment.\n\n149\n00:08:46.402 --> 00:08:51.840\nAnd that's where it's delivered to\nthe organization, to the business.\n\n150\n00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.985\nAnd all the time, of course,\n\n151\n00:08:52.985 --> 00:08:57.580\nwe're communicating with the stakeholders\ncuz we're keeping that catalog updated.\n\n152\n00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:05.620\nSo, that is our service portfolio process,\nas we see here.\n\n153\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.060\nSo, what starts off our service\nportfolio process then?\n\n154\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.890\nWell, we've already seen,\nwe've looked at the triggers.\n\n155\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:18.730\nThose triggers are the,\nwell if I go back to this previous slide.\n\n156\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.410\nThose triggers are what happens right at\nthe very start in that process initiation.\n\n157\n00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.160\nThat's what starts off our\nprocess we've already said,\n\n158\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.190\nincluding CSI initiatives, including maybe\na request from financial management.\n\n159\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.990\nAnd the inputs that we take then, well,\n\n160\n00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.790\neverything that we have to consider\nincluding financial reports that we'd\n\n161\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.050\nconsider when we\nare evaluating business cases.\n\n162\n00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.030\nIncluding complaints, and\nsuggestions, etc., and\n\n163\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.490\nwhat comes out well,\nis a charted service hopefully.\n\n164\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.320\nBut might not necessarily be charted, it\nmight be a service that is prepared to be\n\n165\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.010\nmade redundant, or retired, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.320\nSo, this is what comes out,\nincluding our change proposals,\n\n167\n00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.610\nwhich go off to change management for\nthat technical sanity check.\n\n168\n00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.250\nIn terms of interfaces,\nwell absolutely any process in the whole\n\n169\n00:10:14.963 --> 00:10:19.965\nwhat can,\nsorry I'm losing my ability to speak.\n\n170\n00:10:19.965 --> 00:10:24.910\n[LAUGH] Absolutely any process\nwithin the whole of can\n\n171\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:30.970\nrecommend a new service, can identify\nan opportunity for improvement.\n\n172\n00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.277\nBut I want to bring out, and\nwe've looked at the business case, so\n\n173\n00:10:34.277 --> 00:10:37.940\nI'm not gonna really expand anything\nmore about financial management,\n\n174\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.975\nbecause we are gonna cover that in a\ndifferent episode within service strategy.\n\n175\n00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.065\nI am gonna look at service\nlevel Management then.\n\n176\n00:10:44.065 --> 00:10:48.445\nBecause I mentioned here\nin the service catalog or\n\n177\n00:10:48.445 --> 00:10:52.845\nin the service portfolio in the pipeline,\nit's the first place where we start to\n\n178\n00:10:52.845 --> 00:10:58.495\narticulate a particular service in terms\nof value delivery to the business.\n\n179\n00:10:58.495 --> 00:11:01.455\nAnd in the catalog we're going\nto evolve that as we build,\n\n180\n00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:04.315\nand we test that particular service.\n\n181\n00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:09.290\nBut service level management\nwill have a input into this\n\n182\n00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.750\nbecause service level management is where\nwe negotiate the service level targets.\n\n183\n00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.195\nIn other words, the parameters within\nwhich we are going to deliver the service\n\n184\n00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:19.466\nto the organization.\n\n185\n00:11:19.466 --> 00:11:22.830\nNow, there's a little bit of\na sanity check here as well.\n\n186\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.027\nBecause if I'm looking to see where\nthe service portfolio management is\n\n187\n00:11:27.027 --> 00:11:31.513\nworking efficiently, I'm gonna check\nall of my service level agreements.\n\n188\n00:11:31.513 --> 00:11:35.249\nBecause every single service that\nhave a service level agreement,\n\n189\n00:11:35.249 --> 00:11:38.338\nwell that service should be\nmentioned in my portfolio.\n\n190\n00:11:38.338 --> 00:11:40.691\nAnd every single service\nthat's in my portfolio,\n\n191\n00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:42.999\nwell I should have an agreement for\nthat service.\n\n192\n00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.020\nSo, it's kind of just that sanity check,\n\n193\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:51.390\njust to allow me to check that both of\nthese processes are working together.\n\n194\n00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:55.000\nThat they're both working efficiently and\neffectively and\n\n195\n00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.290\nthat there is a relationship between them.\n\n196\n00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.270\nThink about security when we're\nbringing in any new service.\n\n197\n00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.890\nOf course we have to do that, and\n\n198\n00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:08.320\nwe may have to consider any security\napplications over new services.\n\n199\n00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.768\nAnd of course new services mean\npotentially an increase or\n\n200\n00:12:12.768 --> 00:12:17.215\na decrease if we are making\na service redundant then we need\n\n201\n00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:20.682\nan increase in capacity or\nin availability.\n\n202\n00:12:20.682 --> 00:12:24.570\nAnd of course, any new service that\nwe bring in has to be part, then,\n\n203\n00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.990\nof our continuity plan.\n\n204\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.250\nSo, let's move on to critical\nsuccess factors, then, the CSF.\n\n205\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:37.330\nNow again, as with every other process\nthat we have within our episodes here and\n\n206\n00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.750\nwithin our life cycle phases,\nthese are just examples.\n\n207\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:46.694\nAnd the critical success factors that\nyou will have for your organization may\n\n208\n00:12:46.694 --> 00:12:50.813\nwell be completely different to\nthe examples that we have here.\n\n209\n00:12:50.813 --> 00:12:56.790\nAnd this we mentioned in a previous\nepisode, it will start off simple, okay?\n\n210\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.770\nThe smaller the organization, the more\nimmature the implementation of service\n\n211\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:05.670\nportfolio management is,\nwell, then the simpler I\n\n212\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:11.430\nexpect your CSF to be and\nthe least number of CSF I expect to see.\n\n213\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.170\nSo, let us take a look at our\ncritical success factors then.\n\n214\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.910\nWell, for example what we have\nhere are formal processes that\n\n215\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.940\nwill decide what services we offer.\n\n216\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.931\nSo that process that you saw that looked\nat the initiation and then define and\n\n217\n00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:31.265\nanalyze and then charter, well,\nthat particular process I expect\n\n218\n00:13:31.265 --> 00:13:37.182\nto see some documentation that outlines\nthat particular process, okay?\n\n219\n00:13:37.182 --> 00:13:41.772\nAnd then we want models to\nanalyze return on investment.\n\n220\n00:13:41.772 --> 00:13:44.268\nSo the KPIs that I'm [INAUDIBLE] that,\n\n221\n00:13:44.268 --> 00:13:48.400\nthe KPIs that will tell us\nwhether we're achieving that.\n\n222\n00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.450\nWell again, they should be\nrelevent to your organization.\n\n223\n00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.930\nWe've got a CSF here about the ability\nto document each service and\n\n224\n00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.448\nthe outcomes that it supports.\n\n225\n00:13:58.448 --> 00:14:02.870\nAnd again, the KPIs that you see under\nhere about documented processes, and\n\n226\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.780\nservices being linked\nto business outcomes.\n\n227\n00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:11.250\nWell yet again,\nI am expecting you to articulate,\n\n228\n00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.010\nby way of the KPIs,\nwhether we have achieved each CSF.\n\n229\n00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.168\nAnd then look at all the CSFs that we've\ngot helping out the organization achieve\n\n230\n00:14:21.168 --> 00:14:23.070\nthe objectives.\n\n231\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:30.110\nEvery single service in our portfolio\nmust be listed in terms of the value\n\n232\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:34.890\nthat it delivers to the organization and\nthe outcomes that it facilitates.\n\n233\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:41.360\nSo both of those CSFs really refer\nto exactly the same thing and\n\n234\n00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.971\nthe KPIs do exactly the same.\n\n235\n00:14:43.971 --> 00:14:48.655\nNow, CSF about the ability to change\nthe service influence by internal and\n\n236\n00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:49.930\nexternal factors.\n\n237\n00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:54.897\nBut that's a CSF based on flexibility and\nbased on our ability\n\n238\n00:14:54.897 --> 00:14:59.630\nto adapt our existing services and\nadopt new services.\n\n239\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.586\nSo again those KPIs should\nshow a demonstration of\n\n240\n00:15:04.586 --> 00:15:07.800\nour achievement of that CSF.\n\n241\n00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.500\nSo even things like customer surveys and\ncustomer satisfaction.\n\n242\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.359\nIf our customers aren't happy with us,\nif they don't think\n\n243\n00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:19.989\nthat we are reactive enough,\nthen we're not going to achieve that CSF.\n\n244\n00:15:19.989 --> 00:15:24.859\nAnd notice, by the way, when we went back\nand we looked at that particular process\n\n245\n00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:27.613\nitself, you'll notice\nthat the triggers and\n\n246\n00:15:27.613 --> 00:15:30.450\nthe inputs came from a lot\nof different places.\n\n247\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.820\nSo, I don't expect all of our ideas for\n\n248\n00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.170\nnew services to come\nfrom the organization.\n\n249\n00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.932\nAnd in fact, I expect us to be more\nproactive at recommending ideas for\n\n250\n00:15:42.932 --> 00:15:46.903\nnew services,\nthen being reactive to the organization.\n\n251\n00:15:46.903 --> 00:15:50.958\nWe have to be reactive,\nwe have to respond to them, but\n\n252\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.701\nwe also should be proactive as well.\n\n253\n00:15:53.701 --> 00:15:57.084\nSo we should have tools that\nallow us to track our investment.\n\n254\n00:15:57.084 --> 00:16:01.860\nAnd again, the KPIs underpinning\nthat will concentrate on finances,\n\n255\n00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.717\nconcentrate on return on investment,\nand concentrate on budgeting and\n\n256\n00:16:06.717 --> 00:16:09.600\naccounting for each service.\n\n257\n00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.855\nAnd then we really do need to have,\nout of all of our CSFs,\n\n258\n00:16:13.855 --> 00:16:18.907\nwe need to have a CSF that's going\nto allow us to assess the ability or\n\n259\n00:16:18.907 --> 00:16:21.319\nthe viability of our services.\n\n260\n00:16:21.319 --> 00:16:25.794\nIn other words, whether our\nservices are still relevant, and\n\n261\n00:16:25.794 --> 00:16:31.540\ncontinual service improvement relies on\nthat CSF in this particular instance,\n\n262\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.750\nfor this particular service.\n\n263\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.460\nSo what is it then that\nwe have to achieve?\n\n264\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:44.252\nWhat do we have to overcome in order to\nimplement service portfolio management?\n\n265\n00:16:44.252 --> 00:16:45.781\nWell, if you notice,\n\n266\n00:16:45.781 --> 00:16:50.530\nwhat we have in these challenges\nare a lack of formal approaches.\n\n267\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.375\nAnd without a formal\napproach to any process,\n\n268\n00:16:53.375 --> 00:16:58.590\nwhether it be change or project\nmanagements or portfolio managements,\n\n269\n00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:03.390\nwithout a formal approach then\nit's going to be difficult for\n\n270\n00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:11.120\nus to assess in a consistent way the\nviability and relevance of new services.\n\n271\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.560\nWe also have a lack of\ncustomer information here.\n\n272\n00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.600\nAnd I will tell you that business\nrelationship management has a lot\n\n273\n00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.000\nto play into this.\n\n274\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.220\nAnd business relationship management\nis going to be key in providing\n\n275\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:28.480\nthat customer information and also the\nbusiness information on the strategy and\n\n276\n00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.040\nwhat the business is trying to achieve.\n\n277\n00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.080\nBecause it's by understanding\nbusiness outcomes that we\n\n278\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.440\nare then able to define services\nto meet those outcomes.\n\n279\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.257\nAnd just be careful, we shouldn't be\nmaking decisions to implement new\n\n280\n00:17:45.257 --> 00:17:49.307\nservices without understanding\nthe complete information.\n\n281\n00:17:49.307 --> 00:17:53.747\nAnd that's not just about what\nthe service is supposed to do, but\n\n282\n00:17:53.747 --> 00:17:57.313\nalso about what outcome\nit's supposed to fulfill.\n\n283\n00:17:57.313 --> 00:18:01.158\nThere's a big difference between\nthe functionality of a service and\n\n284\n00:18:01.158 --> 00:18:03.344\nwhat the service is supposed to do, and\n\n285\n00:18:03.344 --> 00:18:06.141\nthe business outcome that\nwe need to facilitate.\n\n286\n00:18:06.141 --> 00:18:10.217\nBecause you see the business outcome\nthat we need to facilitate might\n\n287\n00:18:10.217 --> 00:18:15.750\nnot actually match what that particular\nservice or particular application does.\n\n288\n00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.800\nSo be very careful,\nwe've got to think about both.\n\n289\n00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.550\nAnd we've also got to think about how\nwe're going to measure each service.\n\n290\n00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:25.002\nWhen we bring a new service\ninto the environment,\n\n291\n00:18:25.002 --> 00:18:30.262\nyou gotta be able to measure whether\nit works and whether it delivers value,\n\n292\n00:18:30.262 --> 00:18:35.110\nand whether it is going to carry on\ndelivering value in an ongoing basis\n\n293\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.913\nthrough however long the life\nof that service will be.\n\n294\n00:18:38.913 --> 00:18:43.908\nAnd one more point I want to mention\nabout bringing in any new service,\n\n295\n00:18:43.908 --> 00:18:48.734\nis that when we bring in any new service\nwe must have an idea of how long\n\n296\n00:18:48.734 --> 00:18:53.180\nthat service is going to be\nin our live environment for.\n\n297\n00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.670\nIn other words,\nthe expected life of that service.\n\n298\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.170\nI'm not expecting us to be\naccurate at that point in time.\n\n299\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.340\nI'm not expecting us to turn around and\nsay, right, we're gonna have this\n\n300\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.680\nservice for five years and then that's it,\nafter five years it's going.\n\n301\n00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.172\nI expect us to have some idea.\n\n302\n00:19:08.172 --> 00:19:10.880\nIs it one that's going to\nbe around indefinitely?\n\n303\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.615\nOr is it a service that's\ngoing to require upgrades and\n\n304\n00:19:14.615 --> 00:19:18.846\nupdates on a frequent basis,\nmaybe every six months, okay?\n\n305\n00:19:18.846 --> 00:19:22.104\nI expect us to know when\nwe bring in a new service,\n\n306\n00:19:22.104 --> 00:19:26.230\nwhat the anticipated life\nspan of that service is.\n\n307\n00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.264\nLet's face it, we all go out and\nwe buy a new phone every year.\n\n308\n00:19:29.264 --> 00:19:32.037\nAnd we now know that we expect\nit to last us a year, and\n\n309\n00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:35.960\nafter a year we wanna trade it in and\nwe wanna get a new one, okay?\n\n310\n00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.710\nWe all have that in mind, we need to\ndo exactly the same with our services.\n\n311\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:42.521\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n312\n00:19:42.521 --> 00:19:47.176\nWell, thank you again for helping us\nhere understand more about, of course,\n\n313\n00:19:47.176 --> 00:19:51.620\nthe service portfolio management when\nwe talked about the triggers that we\n\n314\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.345\nactually need to take a look at here, as\nwell as the critical success factors and\n\n315\n00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:57.590\nthe KPIs, too.\n\n316\n00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.850\nAnd then lastly, the challenges and\nrisks that we have to also face, too.\n\n317\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.100\nWell, that's a great place for\nus

00:00:24.480\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at financial management.\n\n9\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.370\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be, well,\n\n10\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.020\nI'm gonna cal her the ITIL queen\nof cache then, Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.870\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.054\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:35.084\nWow, I've had some names.\n\n14\n00:00:35.084 --> 00:00:36.300\nDon't know what to say.\n\n15\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.339\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Jo,\n\n16\n00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.884\nwe're moving into this realm\nof financial management.\n\n17\n00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:45.100\nIt doesn't really seem to fit very well,\nJo.\n\n18\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.570\nI'm an IT guy.\n\n19\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.920\nI like doing the stuff that I like doing.\n\n20\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.070\nBut finances, I kind of think\nthat belongs to somebody else.\n\n21\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.303\nSo Jo help us out here.\n\n22\n00:00:55.303 --> 00:00:57.050\n&gt;&gt; Well, and that's the problem Ronnie.\n\n23\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.630\nThat's exactly the problem.\n\n24\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.059\nHere we are in IT, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.591\nAnd I don't of anyone in\nIT that likes finances.\n\n26\n00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.705\nNow, I know everybody in IT likes money.\n\n27\n00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:08.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We love it.\n\n28\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.361\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe all like to have it in our accounts and\n\n29\n00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:16.022\neven at work, we all like to have it\nto spend We don't like managing it.\n\n30\n00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:19.270\nAnd we brought in financial management as,\nwell,\n\n31\n00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.292\njust wanna line the fact that\nwe've gotta manage our budgets.\n\n32\n00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:25.439\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We don't have a bottomless\n\n33\n00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.170\npit of money to spend and\nwe've got to manage our budgets somehow.\n\n34\n00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.400\nBut it's not just about\nmanaging our budgets.\n\n35\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.820\nIt's also about that common sense factor\nof being able to justify why we're here.\n\n36\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.380\nMost organizations around the world are\nhere because they want to make a profit.\n\n37\n00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.137\nIf it's a government organization,\nwhich is where ITIL came from.\n\n38\n00:01:46.137 --> 00:01:47.840\nITIL came from the government.\n\n39\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.560\nAnd in a government organization, we want\nto be able to justify that we're making\n\n40\n00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.340\nthe most efficient and\nimpartial use of taxpayer's money.\n\n41\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.170\nAgain, it's back down to money.\n\n42\n00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.520\nSo we have to be able to justify\nthat there is a quantifiable value\n\n43\n00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.820\nin the services that we provide.\n\n44\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.360\nSo whether we like it or not,\nwe can't run away from it.\n\n45\n00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.640\nWe've got to manage our money.\n\n46\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.030\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when we start taking,\nwe got it from a perspective of ITIL then.\n\n47\n00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.410\nOnce again,\nknowing that it's not really prescriptive,\n\n48\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.010\nhow does ITIL really help us out here\nin this financial management then?\n\n49\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad you mentioned that it's\nnot prescriptive, but it's not just that.\n\n50\n00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.473\nYou see, your organization, and\nI mean, every single organization,\n\n51\n00:02:30.473 --> 00:02:35.083\nall the way around the world,\nhas completely different perspectives and\n\n52\n00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:39.116\na completely different view on\nhow they manage their finances.\n\n53\n00:02:39.116 --> 00:02:43.537\nAnd when we looked in previous episodes\nat the perspective of the organization,\n\n54\n00:02:43.537 --> 00:02:48.284\nthe strategy of the organization, is it to\nrun the business like a not-for-profit or\n\n55\n00:02:48.284 --> 00:02:50.230\na government organization?\n\n56\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.360\nOr to grow the business or\neven to transform the business?\n\n57\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.091\nEvery single organization everywhere\naround the world has a completely\n\n58\n00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.174\ndifferent way of managing their money.\n\n59\n00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:04.634\nAnd therefore in IT every single\norganization, every single service\n\n60\n00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:11.520\nprovider has to be able to justify how we\nspend our money in a different way, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.350\nAnd we do this in alignment\nwith the organization.\n\n62\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.228\nThe organization is gonna tell\nus how to account for our money.\n\n63\n00:03:19.228 --> 00:03:22.760\nThe organization is gonna tell us how\nmuch money we've got to spend and\n\n64\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.130\nit really is down to us to just justify\nthe money that we are spending.\n\n65\n00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.680\nAnd there is no right or\nwrong way of doing this.\n\n66\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.910\nI'm gonna give you some principles\nover the next couple of episodes,\n\n67\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.640\nthis episode and the next.\n\n68\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.420\nI'm going to give you some principles.\n\n69\n00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.100\nI'm going to throw some\nterminology at you as well.\n\n70\n00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.000\nAnd I'm really just gonna give\nyou the basics for finance.\n\n71\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.590\nBut I know, okay, you're in good hands\nhere, cuz I know I'm an IT person too.\n\n72\n00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.373\nNobody likes to deal with finance.\n\n73\n00:03:52.373 --> 00:03:53.363\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n74\n00:03:53.363 --> 00:03:56.303\none of the first things that we'll tell\nyou when it comes to financial management,\n\n75\n00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:58.830\nis actually we've gotta find somebody\nwith the right level of skills.\n\n76\n00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.690\nThat's a big challenge.\n\n77\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.280\nYou don't like finances.\n\n78\n00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I don't like finances.\n\n79\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.850\nSo now you try and\nput a set of accounts in front of me, and\n\n80\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.820\nask me how well I'm gonna\ndo on these accounts.\n\n81\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.588\nBut then how many accountants do\nyou know who are really good at IT?\n\n82\n00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.140\n&gt;&gt; I don't know of any.\n\n83\n00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n84\n00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Generally these two,\n\n85\n00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.132\nthey're polar opposites.\n\n86\n00:04:22.132 --> 00:04:24.444\nThese two generally don't mix.\n\n87\n00:04:24.444 --> 00:04:26.633\nAnd what we're really looking for\n\n88\n00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:30.192\nis somebody with the skills\nthat can understand money.\n\n89\n00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:33.364\nAnd is able to understand cost models and\n\n90\n00:04:33.364 --> 00:04:38.320\naccounting models and cost types and\ndepreciation methods.\n\n91\n00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.950\nAnd everything like that.\n\n92\n00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.610\nWe need somebody who can understand that,\nbut who can also understand the difference\n\n93\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.290\nbetween the capital expenditure and an\noperational expenditure expenditure in IT.\n\n94\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.000\nIs a server capital expenditure,\nor is it operational expenditure?\n\n95\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.820\nCuz actually it's a bit of both.\n\n96\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.494\nBecause yes, fair enough,\nwe buy the server outright, but\n\n97\n00:04:58.494 --> 00:05:03.696\nthen we've also got a maintenance contract\nin place with a supplier for that server.\n\n98\n00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:06.768\nAnd we also have to think about\nthe infrastructure that goes in\n\n99\n00:05:06.768 --> 00:05:08.270\nto the server as well.\n\n100\n00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.580\nThere's operational expenditure there.\n\n101\n00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.060\nSo, we need somebody\nthat is not only able to\n\n102\n00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.230\nidentify the difference between capital\nand operational expenditure, but\n\n103\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.070\nsomebody who knows what a server does and\nhow a server works.\n\n104\n00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.240\nSo, we need somebody\nwith both sets of skills.\n\n105\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.610\nSo, financial management is a challenge.\n\n106\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.920\nIt's a challenge for\nmost IT organizations.\n\n107\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.600\nAnd we can turn around and we can\ntell you though, put it quite simply,\n\n108\n00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.590\nwe've got to justify why we're here.\n\n109\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.340\nAnd we've got to justify that\nwe're dealing in value for money.\n\n110\n00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.940\nSo, we can't ignore financial management.\n\n111\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.056\nNow, I'm not gonna be\nprescriptive about this.\n\n112\n00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:45.152\nAnd I'm not gonna tell you\nhow to manage your finances,\n\n113\n00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:47.470\nbut I'm gonna tell you that you've got to.\n\n114\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.670\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n115\n00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.390\nYou have to.\n\n116\n00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.070\nWe have to be able to\njustify why we're here.\n\n117\n00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.620\nSo I wanna start off with taking\na look at our first slide.\n\n118\n00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.710\nAnd it just simply says\nexactly what I've just said.\n\n119\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.490\nThis particular process provides\nthe business, and IT as well,\n\n120\n00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.530\nwith the quantification in\nfinancial terms of the value of IT.\n\n121\n00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.392\nIn other words,\nis the organization getting value for\n\n122\n00:06:17.392 --> 00:06:21.352\nmoney from our IT service provider?\n\n123\n00:06:21.352 --> 00:06:23.010\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n124\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.053\nAnd of course, as I've already mentioned,\n\n125\n00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:30.628\nthe organization has got it's own\nway of accounting for its money.\n\n126\n00:06:30.628 --> 00:06:33.140\nAnd we call that enterprise\nfinancial management.\n\n127\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.630\nSo it's a financial\nmanagement structure that's\n\n128\n00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.390\nused throughout the entire\norganization including here in IT.\n\n129\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.260\nThe organization will tell you\nwhether overtime is considered to be\n\n130\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.540\ncapital expenditure or whether it's\nconsidered to be operational expenditure.\n\n131\n00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.270\nBecause some organizations, salaries are\nconsidered to be capital expenditure and\n\n132\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.420\nthe overtime is considered to be\noperation, because it's variable.\n\n133\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.460\nBut some will consider them to be all\noperational, but we've got operational\n\n134\n00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.960\nas in the salary is fixed and\nthe overtime is variable.\n\n135\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.050\nBut their still nevertheless\noperational expenditure.\n\n136\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.593\nI'm not gonna tell you what's right or\nwrong,\n\n137\n00:07:20.593 --> 00:07:24.408\nbecause it's really down to what is\nset in your enterprise policies and\n\n138\n00:07:24.408 --> 00:07:27.600\nin your enterprise guidelines for\nfinancial management.\n\n139\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.687\nAnd so it really isn't up to us within\nIT to go back to the business and\n\n140\n00:07:31.687 --> 00:07:36.650\ntell them what's right or wrong when\nit comes to something like that.\n\n141\n00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.660\nNow that said,\n\n142\n00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.320\nI've already mentioned that we've gotta\nhave somebody with the right skills.\n\n143\n00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.200\nAnd that's financial management\nskills as well as IT skills.\n\n144\n00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.519\nBecause we have to have somebody, that\nit is able to go back to the business,\n\n145\n00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:52.566\nto go back to the chief finance officer\nand actually say to them, okay,\n\n146\n00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:56.548\nthis particular piece of hardware,\nor this particular software, or\n\n147\n00:07:56.548 --> 00:08:00.545\nthis particular license,\nthis is how we're going to account for it.\n\n148\n00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:02.716\nAnd this is what we mean by depreciation.\n\n149\n00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:06.606\nHow do you workout the depreciation Or\ntheir software license.\n\n150\n00:08:06.606 --> 00:08:09.996\nIs there depreciation\non a software license.\n\n151\n00:08:09.996 --> 00:08:12.740\nBecause software license is an asset.\n\n152\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.530\nIt's something that we have.\n\n153\n00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.820\nSo, how do we work out\nthe depreciation on that?\n\n154\n00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.800\nSo, this is something that,\nas I said, we need somebody\n\n155\n00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.930\nthat has the skills in both IT And\nin finance.\n\n156\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.400\nSo, it's quite a challenge, it really is.\n\n157\n00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.410\nNow, I get asked quite often, whether we\nneed a finance person to come and do this?\n\n158\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:35.830\nDo we need an accountant?\n\n159\n00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.309\nOr should this be an IT person that\nwe've trained to understand finances?\n\n160\n00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.320\nI don't have an answer to that.\n\n161\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.260\nI don't have a right, or wrong.\n\n162\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.400\nSome organizations where I have been\nwell we've had a finance person,\n\n163\n00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.870\nand we've trained them on IT.\n\n164\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.660\nOther organizations then\nwe've had an IT person, and\n\n165\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.390\nwe've trained them in\naccounting principles.\n\n166\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.870\nThere's not right, or\nwrong way of doing it.\n\n167\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.340\nBut that's the challenge that you have\nto face is being able to do this.\n\n168\n00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:13.670\nOtherwise, we are not very effective\nat articulating our value in terms\n\n169\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:19.240\nof financial return on the investment\nthat the organization has given us.\n\n170\n00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.790\nSo, it is a challenge.\n\n171\n00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.880\nAnd there's no two ways about this,\nI'm not gonna pretend it's not, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.940\nYou see the purpose of financial\nmanagement is ensure that we've got\n\n173\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.273\nthe appropriate funding to make sure that\nwe don't commit to anything that we can't\n\n174\n00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:33.837\nprovide.\n\n175\n00:09:33.837 --> 00:09:39.875\nAnd also to provide enough information to\nour business, so that they can decisions\n\n176\n00:09:39.875 --> 00:09:45.660\non whether a new service is a good\ninvestment, or is not a good investment.\n\n177\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.580\nThat means also, providing our\norganization with information\n\n178\n00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.720\non whether our existing services\ncarry on to being good investment, or\n\n179\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.190\nwhether they are no\nlonger good investment.\n\n180\n00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.730\nAnd at that point in time, we may\nconsider it retirement of a service.\n\n181\n00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.220\nSo, we have to have a framework for\ntracking and communicating\n\n182\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.120\nservice provision, and for tracking and\ncommunicating return on investment.\n\n183\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.870\nNow, like I said,\nwe are going to work in accordance with\n\n184\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.640\nthe enterprise guidelines for\nfinancial management.\n\n185\n00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.160\nIn other words what the business\nwant us to work within.\n\n186\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.830\nSo, when it's creating a framework for\ntracking and\n\n187\n00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.980\ncommunicating, we're gonna get the outline\nfor that framework from the business.\n\n188\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.780\nThat is not gonna be something that\nwe are going to create ourselves.\n\n189\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.020\nThe business will tell us how they\nwant us to track our services.\n\n190\n00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.809\nThey will tell us exactly how they\nwant us to balance our income,\n\n191\n00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:47.988\nand our expenditure, and\nhow they want us to report it.\n\n192\n00:10:47.988 --> 00:10:51.580\nAnd how they want us to account for\nit as well.\n\n193\n00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.870\nThey'll also,\ntell us how they want us to forecast.\n\n194\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.422\nForecast is obviously forecasting budget,\nhow much money do I need.\n\n195\n00:10:58.422 --> 00:11:03.650\nAnd they'll tell us and this is\ncompletely down to the organization,\n\n196\n00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.525\nwhether we should be recuperating,\nor recovering our costs from\n\n197\n00:11:08.525 --> 00:11:12.710\nthe organization, or\nmaybe from external customers.\n\n198\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.600\nNow, it says in parentheses, or\n\n199\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.680\nbrackets that I wrote on bullet\npoint that is where appropriate.\n\n200\n00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.880\nSo, Financial Management is\nsplit into three sections, okay,\n\n201\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.350\nand I'm going to flick between this\nparticular slide and the next one.\n\n202\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.210\nBecause we have, and I'll always start off\nwith B, even though we say, it's A, B, C.\n\n203\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.740\nWe start off with B, for budgeting.\n\n204\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.040\nHow much money have I got to spend?\n\n205\n00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.090\nAccounting, how much money have I spent.\n\n206\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.460\nAnd charging, well,\nit says there according to policy.\n\n207\n00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.740\nAnd back on this previous slide,\nit says, where appropriate.\n\n208\n00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.670\nCharging is optional.\n\n209\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.180\nAnd charging is something that again,\n\n210\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.920\nyou are going to work out in\nconjunction with your organization.\n\n211\n00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.810\nWhether you choose to charge\nyour organization, or not.\n\n212\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:11.050\nAnd there are going to be\nvariable levels of charging.\n\n213\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.020\nI wanna go back to\nthe definition of a service.\n\n214\n00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.420\nAnd the service is a means of\ndelivering value to the organization.\n\n215\n00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.930\nBy facilitation the outcomes\nthey want to achieve without\n\n216\n00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.810\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n217\n00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.230\nSo, we gonna deliver you a service we\ngonna deliver you the ability to send and\n\n218\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.350\nreceive email.\n\n219\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.320\nOkay, that's an ability, and\nthat's what we deliver to you.\n\n220\n00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.680\nNow, we know the service is made up\nof components, such as software,\n\n221\n00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.580\nand hardware, and environments, and\ninfrastructure, and documentation,\n\n222\n00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.840\nand people as well,\nthese are the components of a service.\n\n223\n00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.680\nNow, this is where it gets complicated,\nbecause the service description says, or\n\n224\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.850\ndefinition, without the ownership\nof specific costs and risks.\n\n225\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.870\nLet me try and work out specific cost.\n\n226\n00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.692\nSo, if I want t work out the specific\ncost of email to a customer,\n\n227\n00:13:10.692 --> 00:13:14.531\nbecause they are an external customer for\ninstance.\n\n228\n00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:18.662\nSo, an external customer of mine, and\nso, therefore they are going to pay for\n\n229\n00:13:18.662 --> 00:13:22.290\nour service,\ncuz we're an external service provider.\n\n230\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.170\nSo, Ronnie, you're my external\ncustomer for the moment, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.300\nSo, I'm giving you email.\n\n232\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.550\nOkay?\n\n233\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.430\nAnd, I'm gonna make sure that you've got\nthe right hardware, and the software and\n\n234\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.600\neverything in order to be able to send and\nto receive email.\n\n235\n00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.630\nBut I want to charge you\nthe specific costs for that service.\n\n236\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.140\nSo, I'm gonna give you your email.\n\n237\n00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.080\nNow, how many services do you\nhave on your laptop right now?\n\n238\n00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.430\nSo, you have your email.\n\n239\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.140\nYou've probably got an accounting package.\n\n240\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n241\n00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.610\nOkay, so you've got maybe\na word processing package?\n\n242\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.311\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n243\n00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:07.580\nYou've got the ability\nto access the Internet?\n\n244\n00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.740\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n245\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.370\nYou've got a customer database on site?\n\n246\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:11.930\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n247\n00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.401\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nOkay, so you've got five services.\n\n248\n00:14:13.401 --> 00:14:19.320\nSo, that PC probably cost about $2,000,\ndidn't it?\n\n249\n00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n250\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.010\nLet's say that, right, so just on that\nparticular piece of hardware then,\n\n251\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:32.690\nwell, that means, that just for\nemail the cost of that PC was $400.\n\n252\n00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.902\nCuz we're taking that 2,000 and\nwe're dividing it by the 5 services, okay.\n\n253\n00:14:36.902 --> 00:14:37.411\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n254\n00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:40.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, so keep that $400 in mind.\n\n255\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.157\nNow, let's get down to the network.\n\n256\n00:14:43.157 --> 00:14:46.918\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, the cost provided an network to\n\n257\n00:14:46.918 --> 00:14:53.940\nthis particular room here is going\nto be 1,000$ a month for instance.\n\n258\n00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.310\nHow many PCs are in this room right now?\n\n259\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.048\n&gt;&gt; Two right now.\n\n260\n00:14:58.048 --> 00:14:58.697\n&gt;&gt; Two, okay.\n\n261\n00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:04.950\nSo, that's $500 per PC, but then,\nwe've got 5 services on your PC.\n\n262\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:09.327\nSo, we're gonna take that $500\nan then we're gonna divide it by 5 and\n\n263\n00:15:09.327 --> 00:15:10.795\nthat gives us $100.\n\n264\n00:15:10.795 --> 00:15:16.170\nOkay, so so far, the cost of\nproviding your service is that $400,\n\n265\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.930\nplus the $100 for the infrastructure.\n\n266\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.220\nNow, then, okay.\n\n267\n00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.230\nWhat about your license for your email?\n\n268\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.781\nThat's easy, because there's one of you,\nso I can give you,\n\n269\n00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:29.130\nI can transfer that cost directly to you.\n\n270\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.232\nAnd that's $100 a year.\n\n271\n00:15:32.232 --> 00:15:33.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n272\n00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.250\nAnd that makes it a little\nbit more difficult,\n\n273\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:40.450\ncuz now I'm gonna have to divide that\ninto 12 to get a monthly fee, am I not?\n\n274\n00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.300\nBut hang on a minute,\nthe actual PC, I told you, well,\n\n275\n00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.840\nthat was an outright cost and\nthe infrastructure,\n\n276\n00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.530\nthat was a monthly cost, and now,\nI'm giving you an annual cost.\n\n277\n00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:54.540\nAll right, then, okay.\n\n278\n00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.450\nI can work with this.\n\n279\n00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.913\nNow, what about the electricity\nthat you are using?\n\n280\n00:15:57.913 --> 00:16:02.521\nHow much electricity is coming into\nthis room divided by the two PCs\n\n281\n00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:06.564\ndivided by five services that\nyou've got on your laptop?\n\n282\n00:16:06.564 --> 00:16:07.140\n&gt;&gt; Not all.\n\n283\n00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.797\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n284\n00:16:07.797 --> 00:16:11.211\nThis is why we don't\ntransfer specific cost.\n\n285\n00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:12.139\nCuz guess what?\n\n286\n00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.969\nIt's gonna take us more\neffort to work them out\n\n287\n00:16:14.969 --> 00:16:18.461\nthan what we're actually gonna\nbe able to recover back.\n\n288\n00:16:18.461 --> 00:16:24.388\nNow, if we go back to that slide, it says\ncreating a framework for recovering costs.\n\n289\n00:16:24.388 --> 00:16:30.128\nWe understand that this is gonna be\na nightmare trying to work out these\n\n290\n00:16:30.128 --> 00:16:37.220\nspecific costs for a specific service for\none person or one group of people.\n\n291\n00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.080\nThat's gonna be difficult to do.\n\n292\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.580\nSo what we'll do is create a framework for\nrecovering costs.\n\n293\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.430\nAnd while I'll turn around to Ronnie and\nI'll say Ronnie, look, I'm gonna\n\n294\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:51.030\nprovide you with email and you're gonna\npay me $500 a year, is that okay?\n\n295\n00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n296\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.562\n&gt;&gt; There we go, and there's my framework.\n\n297\n00:16:53.562 --> 00:16:58.060\nAll right, that was a very simple one, and\nto be perfectly honest, he was a pushover.\n\n298\n00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.417\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, [LAUGH] right?\n\n299\n00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:04.740\nWe've got our framework there, and\nthat's what financial management does.\n\n300\n00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.345\nWe know that the services is going to cost\nmoney, and we know that we're going to\n\n301\n00:17:09.345 --> 00:17:12.734\nhave to be able to articulate\nhow much money that's cost.\n\n302\n00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:18.398\nYou see, quite often our organization on\nwhere do we fail at financial management,\n\n303\n00:17:18.398 --> 00:17:22.005\nour organization doesn't\nperceive any value in IT.\n\n304\n00:17:22.005 --> 00:17:27.735\nAnd when we say, well, actually the total\ncost of ownership of a PC is $2,000.\n\n305\n00:17:27.735 --> 00:17:32.496\nAnd they turn around and say to us, well,\nI can go down the store and buy one for\n\n306\n00:17:32.496 --> 00:17:33.260\n$500.\n\n307\n00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.903\nIt's because we're not very good at\narticulating what's included in that $200,\n\n308\n00:17:38.903 --> 00:17:40.900\nin that $2,000 rather.\n\n309\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.067\nWe're not very good at saying, well,\nyes, that's $500 for the PC, but\n\n310\n00:17:45.067 --> 00:17:49.954\nthen that's also $500 for the five years'\nworth of support that you're going to get.\n\n311\n00:17:49.954 --> 00:17:51.677\nThat's also $500 for\n\n312\n00:17:51.677 --> 00:17:57.070\nall of the licenses of all of the services\nthat we're putting onto that PC.\n\n313\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.885\nAnd then that's also another 250 for\n\n314\n00:17:59.885 --> 00:18:03.783\nall of the build time that\nwe've taken to build that PC.\n\n315\n00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:06.960\nWe're not very good at articulating that.\n\n316\n00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.790\nThis is why we have to\nhave financial management.\n\n317\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.800\nOtherwise, the perception can be,\nand it is for\n\n318\n00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:19.810\nthe most part, that the organization\nis paying too much for IT.\n\n319\n00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.840\nBut, we're not very good at\narticulating the cost breakdown,\n\n320\n00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.490\nwhich is why we have to have an agreed\nframework if we're going to recover costs.\n\n321\n00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:32.660\nIf we're not going to recover costs, we\nstill have to have an agreed framework for\n\n322\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.020\nwhat we call accounting.\n\n323\n00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.105\nIn other words,\ntracking where the money is spent.\n\n324\n00:18:37.105 --> 00:18:41.341\nBecause we don't transfer\nspecific costs and\n\n325\n00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:46.780\nin some instances,\nwe don't work out the specific costs.\n\n326\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.210\nBecause look how difficult it was and\nthere's only two of us in this room.\n\n327\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.671\nAnd yet look how difficult it was to\nwork out specific costs for one service.\n\n328\n00:18:56.671 --> 00:19:01.510\nAnd yet, there's only two of us with\nfive services and that was difficult.\n\n329\n00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:09.100\nNow, imagine when you've got 20,000 users,\nand you've got 132 services, for example.\n\n330\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.020\nThen it gets difficult,\n\n331\n00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.180\nwhich is why we need somebody with\nthose specialist skills to help us.\n\n332\n00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.860\nNow, underneath charging, you've got we\ncall recovery models or charging models.\n\n333\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.679\nAnd charging is cost, cost +,\nmarket rate, or going rate.\n\n334\n00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:28.764\nAnd what that basically\nmeans is that if we charge,\n\n335\n00:19:28.764 --> 00:19:34.278\nI might choose to charge just a nominal\nfee to Ronnie for the service.\n\n336\n00:19:34.278 --> 00:19:36.704\nI might charge him at cost.\n\n337\n00:19:36.704 --> 00:19:41.941\nI might charge him at cost +, which\nmeans adding a percentage on to cover,\n\n338\n00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:46.860\nsort of the variables,\nthings like the electricity, for instance.\n\n339\n00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.090\nI don't know how much he's going to use\nnext month, so I might charge at cost +.\n\n340\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.830\nAnd I put on a percentage uplift,\nas we call it,\n\n341\n00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.990\nto transfer a cost to Ronnie, so\nthat I can recover that money back.\n\n342\n00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.660\nAnd make sure I cover the fact that he\nmight be using that PC 24 hours a day and\n\n343\n00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.300\nthen using up all the electricity.\n\n344\n00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.510\nWe also might charge at market rate or\na going rate.\n\n345\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.820\nYou can charge at cost- as well.\n\n346\n00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.982\nAnd you can charge just a nominal fee,\nwhich is what I agreed to do.\n\n347\n00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:21.339\nThat was my recovery model\nthat I agreed with Ronnie.\n\n348\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.090\nWhere charging is more appropriate\nis with our external customers.\n\n349\n00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.880\nWith an internal customer,\nnot necessarily appropriate.\n\n350\n00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.750\nAlthough we still have to be able to\narticulate how much money we spent on\n\n351\n00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.240\nour services, we don't always\nnecessarily want to charge.\n\n352\n00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.173\nBut with our external customers, and\nespecially in environments where we've got\n\n353\n00:20:44.173 --> 00:20:47.898\na mixture of both external and internal\ncustomers, then we will be charging.\n\n354\n00:20:47.898 --> 00:20:52.275\nWhich means that the charging\nmodel has to be worked out and\n\n355\n00:20:52.275 --> 00:20:56.250\nagreed for\nexactly how we're going to charge.\n\n356\n00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:01.240\nAnd don't forget there are two types of\ncost, as far as your customer is concerned\n\n357\n00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.170\nit's the cost to them,\nand then the cost to you.\n\n358\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:10.179\nSo I might have paid $500 for this PC, but\n\n359\n00:21:10.179 --> 00:21:13.914\nI'm gonna charge Ronnie $2,000.\n\n360\n00:21:13.914 --> 00:21:19.540\nSo the cost to me is $500 but\nthe cost to him is 2,000,\n\n361\n00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:24.040\nand I have to be able to justify\nwhy there is a difference there.\n\n362\n00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.980\nWhich is why, as it says in the bottom,\n\n363\n00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.960\nabsolutely everything that I've said\nup till now, is the fact that we have\n\n364\n00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.790\nto have somebody with the appropriate\nskills to be able to do this.\n\n365\n00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.646\nSo obviously,\nthe value to the business here, well,\n\n366\n00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:42.033\nit's about being financially responsible.\n\n367\n00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:46.647\nBut it's also about understanding\nhow much money IT costs, and\n\n368\n00:21:46.647 --> 00:21:52.390\nit enables us to make better decisions,\ncertainly within our business cases.\n\n369\n00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.290\nSo enterprise financial management\nis what I've already said,\n\n370\n00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.225\nthis is to do with the organization.\n\n371\n00:22:00.225 --> 00:22:05.350\nAnd we've already mentioned these,\nwhat CIs are considered to be assets?\n\n372\n00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.370\nHow we work out, how we calculate\ndepreciation, for instance.\n\n373\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:14.407\nHow we report on costs and\nhow we charge if we are going to charge.\n\n374\n00:22:14.407 --> 00:22:17.964\nThink about, though, the bottom bullet\npoint about regulatory requirements there.\n\n375\n00:22:17.964 --> 00:22:23.060\nAnd that sometimes, we have regulatory\nrequirements if we work in highly\n\n376\n00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:29.144\ncontrolled industries, such as financial\nindustry or maybe in the medical industry,\n\n377\n00:22:29.144 --> 00:22:34.090\nthen we may have to account for\ncertain costs in a certain way.\n\n378\n00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:39.220\nNow, also think about disposal and\ndisposal of equipment, in a lot of\n\n379\n00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.910\ncountries around the world, now we\nhave laws to do with recycling, etc.\n\n380\n00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.435\nAnd it's not sufficient just to say okay,\n\n381\n00:22:46.435 --> 00:22:50.517\nthat particular piece of hardware\nhas depreciated down to zero now.\n\n382\n00:22:50.517 --> 00:22:54.786\nNow, I'm able to go and\nbuy a new piece of hardware,\n\n383\n00:22:54.786 --> 00:23:00.840\nI still have to then pay to have\nthat old piece of hardware recycled.\n\n384\n00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:06.950\nSo all of those have to be factors\ninto your finance framework,\n\n385\n00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.270\nand that will become part of,\nthe recycling policy, for instance,\n\n386\n00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.230\nwill become part of your\nenterprise financial management.\n\n387\n00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.965\nBecause that applies to fridges,\nand cookers,\n\n388\n00:23:16.965 --> 00:23:22.820\nin exactly the same as it applies to PCs,\nlaptops, and servers as well.\n\n389\n00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.957\nSo think about how we get money\nin then from our organization.\n\n390\n00:23:28.957 --> 00:23:34.379\nAnd sometimes, as I've already mentioned,\nwe'll get our money indirectly\n\n391\n00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:40.260\nfrom our external customer and that's\nwhat we consider to be external funded.\n\n392\n00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.170\nSo that's revenue\ngenerated from selling and\n\n393\n00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:48.650\nthen there's internal funding which is how\na lot of us get our funding to be honest.\n\n394\n00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.600\nThe organization will allocate\nus with a budget, and\n\n395\n00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.050\nthen we may get budget for\nindividual projects.\n\n396\n00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.340\nWe may just get an overall IT budget.\n\n397\n00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.334\nThat's down to your organization and\n\n398\n00:24:01.334 --> 00:24:04.583\ndown to the agreements that you\nhave with your organization.\n\n399\n00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:09.461\nMost organizations adopt a fairly common\npractice of internal funding where\n\n400\n00:24:09.461 --> 00:24:13.287\na budget is given, and\nthen an additional budget is given for\n\n401\n00:24:13.287 --> 00:24:18.239\nnew projects You have to bear in mind that\nwhen an additional budget is given for\n\n402\n00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:24.010\nnew projects, eventually, that new service\nis going to become business as usual.\n\n403\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:27.940\nSo we need to incorporate\nan additional operating budget for\n\n404\n00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:33.060\nthat new service in our future budgets.\n\n405\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:39.080\nThen we've got a rolling plan funding,\nwhich is just basically as one cycle ends,\n\n406\n00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.970\nthen as it says, another begins, so\nwe just get funding on a regular basis.\n\n407\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:49.610\nWe get trigger-based funding, which as\nI've said, is the project type funding,\n\n408\n00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.200\nso as a project starts,\nwe get funding for that project.\n\n409\n00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.871\nBut remember, that then as the project\nmoves into business as usual,\n\n410\n00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:00.967\nwe have to move into\nthe rolling plan funding.\n\n411\n00:25:00.967 --> 00:25:03.475\nAnd then we've got zero based funding.\n\n412\n00:25:03.475 --> 00:25:08.102\nAnd zero based funding is where\nwe give in a budget that is only\n\n413\n00:25:08.102 --> 00:25:12.571\nallocated to cover the costs\nof delivery of the services.\n\n414\n00:25:12.571 --> 00:25:16.832\nAnd we should get down to zero at\nthe end of that funding cycle, and\n\n415\n00:25:16.832 --> 00:25:22.680\nonce we've used up our budget,\nthen we will be allocated another budget.\n\n416\n00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.240\nA lot of organizations will run\non zero based funding, however,\n\n417\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.250\nwhat I tend to see more often than\nnot is a mixture of all of them,\n\n418\n00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:35.440\na mixture of zero based and\ntrigger based and rolling plan as well.\n\n419\n00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.210\nSo I expect your organization to tell you\n\n420\n00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.030\nexactly how they're going\nto work with the budgeting.\n\n421\n00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.250\nBecause that's what this is,\n\n422\n00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.041\nfunding is about budgeting,\nhow much money have I got to spend.\n\n423\n00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.130\nSo let's take a look then,\njust to wrap up this session.\n\n424\n00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.920\nAll right, some basic concepts for\nFinancial Management.\n\n425\n00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.690\nWe've already talked about the fact\nthat we have to be able to\n\n426\n00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.720\njustify our value to the business and,\n\n427\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.440\nin most cases, the business want to see\nthat justification as a bottom-line,\n\n428\n00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.090\nas a pound sign or a dollar sign\nat the bottom of a spreadsheet.\n\n429\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:23.120\nSo we have to ensure, and we work with\nbusiness-relationship management and\n\n430\n00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:29.690\nstrategy management that we are able\nto justify, in a financial term,\n\n431\n00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:34.490\nfor how much money we spent, and how much\nvalue we are delivering to the business.\n\n432\n00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.590\nNow we can, if we so choose,\n\n433\n00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:44.655\nas an IT organization to work towards\ncompliance with standards such as COBIT,\n\n434\n00:26:44.655 --> 00:26:47.765\nfor Financial Management which should,\nit's a strategy.\n\n435\n00:26:49.075 --> 00:26:53.620\nWe can also work to standards\nsuch as ISO 20,000 or sorry,\n\n436\n00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.410\nI'll give it it's full title ISO/IEC20000,\n\n437\n00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:00.790\nwhich is the standard for\nservice management.\n\n438\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:06.116\nAnd then we've also got other standards\nhere and frameworks such as managements\n\n439\n00:27:06.116 --> 00:27:10.906\nof risk which is another OGC,\nthe low standard for risk management too.\n\n440\n00:27:10.906 --> 00:27:15.725\nThere your organisation will tell you\nwhether you need to be compliant to\n\n441\n00:27:15.725 --> 00:27:20.702\nany one of these standards, and\na lot of service management organizations\n\n442\n00:27:20.702 --> 00:27:25.369\nwill actually work towards ISO20000,\nsorry, achievements.\n\n443\n00:27:25.369 --> 00:27:30.264\nSo for the moment, I have thrown a lot\nof financial terms at you, okay,\n\n444\n00:27:30.264 --> 00:27:32.304\na lot of technical terms, and\n\n445\n00:27:32.304 --> 00:27:37.687\nI've given you quite a bit to get your\nhead around so what I'd like you to do is,\n\n446\n00:27:37.687 --> 00:27:42.535\nI would like you to go back over\nthe notes that you've just taken.\n\n447\n00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:45.735\nHopefully, to do with this\nparticular section and\n\n448\n00:27:45.735 --> 00:27:48.710\nI'd like you to review\nwhat we've gone over.\n\n449\n00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:54.260\nAnd in our next episode, we're gonna\nexpand further into Financial Management\n\n450\n00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.640\nand we're going to look at the\nrelationships between other processes and\n\n451\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.250\nthe inputs and\noutputs to Financial Management.\n\n452\n00:28:02.298 --> 00:28:06.960\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well, thank you again for\nhelping us at least to get the terminology\n\n453\n00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.400\nand to get some of the general concepts\ndown what we took a look at here in terms\n\n454\n00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.770\nof Financial Management, where we did\ntalk about the basic purpose as well as,\n\n455\n00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:22.580\nthe idea of justifying to our\norganization the business value of IT.\n\n456\n00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.870\nTook a look at the scope as well and\n\n457\n00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.140\neven covered some of the other\nitems that we needed consider too,\n\n458\n00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.710\nsuch as the objectives, you name it,\nwe've actually started covering them here,\n\n459\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.850\nbut there's actually more to come and\nwe're gonna save that for another episode.\n\n460\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.160\nSo great place for us to sign off.\n\n461\n00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.330\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n462\n00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:44.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n463\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.980\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned here for more of the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy shows\n\n464\n00:28:48.980 -->

00:00:06.635\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:08.175\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:12.070\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.933\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:20.170\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n8\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.552\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n9\n00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:26.340\nwe're taking a look at a part\ntwo on financial management.\n\n10\n00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.575\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be our\nITIL Emperador herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:32.900\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.601\n&gt;&gt; Did you say empanada or\nI've just got food on my mind?\n\n13\n00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.478\n&gt;&gt; Empanada is not exactly what I said.\n\n14\n00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:40.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] All right.\n\n15\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.270\nSo Jo, here we are.\n\n16\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.450\nWe're taking a look at more\nof these financial terms.\n\n17\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.749\nWe talked a lot about it briefly,\nand really kinda great\n\n18\n00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:54.821\nkey that I took away from that\nwas the idea of needing to\n\n19\n00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:59.690\njustify the value of IT\nservice to the business..\n\n20\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.020\nSee, I'm starting to actually change\nthe words around a little bit more.\n\n21\n00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.174\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But Jo,\n\n22\n00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:05.351\nwhat else do we need to do here?\n\n23\n00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:08.556\n&gt;&gt; Well, we looked in the last\nepisode at the concept of accounting,\n\n24\n00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:09.940\nbudgeting, and charging.\n\n25\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.480\nAnd actually,\n\n26\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.380\nwhat we're gonna do is we're just gonna\nexpand on on those a little bit more.\n\n27\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.418\nI talked about charging earlier\non in our last episode, and\n\n28\n00:01:18.418 --> 00:01:21.250\nI looked at charging models, etc.\n\n29\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.820\nBut here,\nif we take a look at our first slide,\n\n30\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.499\nwhat we've done is we've literally\njust split out accounting, budgeting,\n\n31\n00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:33.530\ncharging, and we just put a few more words\nin there, really, and just to explain what\n\n32\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.988\nthese three particular sections of\nfinancial management are about.\n\n33\n00:01:37.988 --> 00:01:43.880\nSo what I'd like to do, and I know that\nit sits in the middle, but I'd like to\n\n34\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.440\nlook at budgeting, first of all, because I\nalways think of budgeting as coming first.\n\n35\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.600\nBudgeting is how much\nmoney we've got to spend,\n\n36\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.280\nwhereas accounting is\nhow much have we spent.\n\n37\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.460\nSo I like to think of budgeting\nas coming before accounting.\n\n38\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.380\nBut I know some people prefer to think of\nit the other way around and that's okay.\n\n39\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.131\nI'm easy with any of those.\n\n40\n00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:07.786\nSo budgeting then,\nthat bit in the middle there,\n\n41\n00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:11.013\nlooks at how much money\nhave we got to spend.\n\n42\n00:02:11.013 --> 00:02:14.401\nAnd what we'll do,\nwhen we're trying to allocate a budget,\n\n43\n00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.500\nis we look at the analysis\nof our previous budget.\n\n44\n00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.750\nAnd that means, actually, and this is\nwhy people like to put accounting first,\n\n45\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.320\nthat means analyzing our\nprevious year's account.\n\n46\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.510\nHow much money did we spend and\nwhere did we spend it?\n\n47\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.370\nAnd then, we need to take a look at\nany changes to our future budget, so\n\n48\n00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.960\nmany plans that are coming in, new\nservices, changes to existing services,\n\n49\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.420\netc., and that allows us then to estimate\nhow much money we need going forward for\n\n50\n00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.910\nthe following year.\n\n51\n00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.040\nNow, I say the following year, but\nit might not necessarily be a year.\n\n52\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.250\nSome people budget every three months,\nsome people budget every six months.\n\n53\n00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.360\nSo let's roll the clock forward then,\nand now, we're at the end of the year.\n\n54\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.940\nAnd again, this might be every three\nmonths, it might be every six months,\n\n55\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.190\nit might be at the end of every year.\n\n56\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.486\nCan I just say that we're in IT, and this\nis kind of just a little bit of a warning\n\n57\n00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:14.218\nreally, we're in IT, and let's face it,\nRonnie, we don't like finances in IT.\n\n58\n00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:14.746\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n59\n00:03:14.746 --> 00:03:17.969\n&gt;&gt; And there's always a great\ntendency to leave our accounting\n\n60\n00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.369\nuntil the end of the year.\n\n61\n00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:20.472\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:03:20.472 --> 00:03:21.082\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:22.100\nWe all do it, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n65\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.720\n&gt;&gt; We all try and\nleave everything till the last minute.\n\n66\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.770\nWe all do our taxes right\nat the end of the year.\n\n67\n00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.670\nWe don't like doing it\nthroughout the year.\n\n68\n00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.100\nYou know, let's be sensible about this.\n\n69\n00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.300\nIf we leave it till the end of the year,\nit's really difficult to try and\n\n70\n00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.623\nremember what happened 11 months ago,\nand wonder whether,\n\n71\n00:03:40.623 --> 00:03:45.260\nwhen you're presented with a model number,\nwondering whether that's a server,\n\n72\n00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.340\nwhether it's a printer,\nwhether it's a cell phone, for instance.\n\n73\n00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.090\nAnd how are we going to account for that?\n\n74\n00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.670\nSo we'll tell you that\nit's best practice to\n\n75\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.410\ncarry on doing your\naccounting every month.\n\n76\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.420\nBut I know that it's not common practice.\n\n77\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.570\nAll right, I'm gonna accept that.\n\n78\n00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.630\nSo let's take a look a little bit\nmore detail then at accounting.\n\n79\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.530\nAnd accounting, we're going to have what\nwe call cost models, and cost types,\n\n80\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.740\nand cost elements and, well,\nwe know about a cost center.\n\n81\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.550\nSo cost models and\ncost types and cost elements.\n\n82\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.420\nOkay.\n\n83\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.715\nA cost model is how we, think of it as\na template for how we justify our costs.\n\n84\n00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:30.775\nWhat are different cost types are,\nand what form part of our cost types.\n\n85\n00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:35.355\nSo, I made mention in our\nlast episode about a server.\n\n86\n00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:36.805\nOkay, it's a server.\n\n87\n00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:38.470\nIs that hardware?\n\n88\n00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.120\nWell, I would think so.\n\n89\n00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.390\nBut what about the firmware\nthat sits on that server?\n\n90\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.090\nWhat about the operating system\nthat sits on that server?\n\n91\n00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.520\nIs that part of the hardware,\nor is that part of software?\n\n92\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.170\nHow exactly do you\nquantify that expenditure?\n\n93\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.040\nOkay?\n\n94\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.060\nSo this is why we have\nto have a cost model.\n\n95\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.160\nAnd a cost model will tell us exactly\nwhat should sit in what cost types,\n\n96\n00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.648\nand what elements sit where.\n\n97\n00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:07.010\nAnd I had looked at overtime, didn't I?\n\n98\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.557\nAnd I mentioned about\novertime in our last episode,\n\n99\n00:05:10.557 --> 00:05:14.921\nis that capital expenditure or\nis it operational expenditure?\n\n100\n00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:19.211\nAnd some people put it down as,\nwell, your salary is operational, but\n\n101\n00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:23.289\nbecause the overtime is variable,\nso your salary's capital, but\n\n102\n00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.640\nbecause the overtime is variable,\nthen that goes in operational.\n\n103\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.123\nBut some people,\nsome organizations put salary and\n\n104\n00:05:31.123 --> 00:05:35.567\novertime in operational, and\none's fixed and one's variable.\n\n105\n00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:38.010\nI can't tell you what's right or\nwrong, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.960\nWhat I can tell you is that\nyou need to have cost models.\n\n107\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.300\nAnd we all know about\nthe concept of a cost center.\n\n108\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.900\nAnd a cost center is how much money each\nparticular unit or cost center has spent.\n\n109\n00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.088\nAnd that gives us, when we add all of\nthis together, that gives us our chart of\n\n110\n00:05:54.088 --> 00:05:57.530\naccounts, and that tells us how much\nmoney we spent over the past year, or\n\n111\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.552\nthe past quarter, or the past six months.\n\n112\n00:05:59.552 --> 00:06:04.071\nAnd of course, we use that then to\ncalculate next year's budget, and\n\n113\n00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:08.360\nit also then gives us any action plans for\nthings like an increase or\n\n114\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.032\ndecrease in next year's budget, or\neven where we may cross charge, and\n\n115\n00:06:13.032 --> 00:06:18.770\nthat comes down to the last section here,\nthat last box that talks about charging.\n\n116\n00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.390\nAnd as I mentioned in\nour previous episode,\n\n117\n00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.450\nwe'll have policies for charging, and\nwe'll decide what we're going to charge,\n\n118\n00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.890\nwe'll decide how much we're going to\ncharge, and whether it's cost plus or\n\n119\n00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.360\ncost minus, or\nwhether it's a going rate or market rate,\n\n120\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.390\netc., we will decide here in\nour charging policies, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.040\nSo what kind of inputs,\nwhat kind of considerations do we have?\n\n122\n00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.070\nWell, right along the top,\nwe've got regulatory requirements,\n\n123\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.280\nwe've got our enterprise financial\nrequirements, which, of course, we know.\n\n124\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.149\nWe are a part of enterprise\nfinancial management.\n\n125\n00:06:55.149 --> 00:07:00.061\nThen we've got our service management\nprocesses, we've got contracts with our\n\n126\n00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:05.258\nsuppliers, and we've got other data from\nour service knowledge management system,\n\n127\n00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:10.690\nwhich will help us ascertain exactly\nwhat assets and what components we have.\n\n128\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.400\nAnd what comes out of\nfinancial management?\n\n129\n00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.220\nHopefully, our cost optimization and\n\n130\n00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.640\nevidence of whether we've been\ncompliant to policies or not.\n\n131\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.460\nBut also, what comes out of financial\nmanagement are our service valuations.\n\n132\n00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.646\nIn other words,\n\n133\n00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:33.234\nare our services delivering\na return on that investment or not?\n\n134\n00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:37.048\nAnd I'm also expecting financial\nmanagement to help with business impact\n\n135\n00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:38.540\nanalysis.\n\n136\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.017\nBecause if we understand the value of the\nservice quantifiable in financial terms,\n\n137\n00:07:44.017 --> 00:07:47.562\nthen we should also then be\nable to work out or calculate\n\n138\n00:07:47.562 --> 00:07:52.444\nwhat the impact to the business would\nbe if that service was not available.\n\n139\n00:07:52.444 --> 00:07:57.879\nAnd that helps us in other processes,\nlike, instead of this continuity\n\n140\n00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:03.314\nmanagement, etc., and in planning\nstrategy for outdated services So\n\n141\n00:08:03.314 --> 00:08:09.260\nthat's really financial management and\na very, very, very high level.\n\n142\n00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.470\nIt's obviously a lot\nmore complex than that.\n\n143\n00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.790\nAnd as Ronnie said in the previous\nepisode, we're in IT and we really,\n\n144\n00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.770\nreally don't like to get ourselves\ntoo involved in financial management.\n\n145\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.003\nSo I will tell you and I'm gonna\nreiterate again from a previous episode.\n\n146\n00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:28.790\nWe have to have somebody with a right\nmixed of skills to be able to do that.\n\n147\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.710\nThis is not something that an IT person,\n\n148\n00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.360\nan IT analyst can just pick\npick up with and run with.\n\n149\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.870\nAnd it's not something that\na financial analyst or\n\n150\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.602\nan accountant can just pick up and\nrun with, because they have to have\n\n151\n00:08:42.602 --> 00:08:46.947\nthat understanding of IT services and\nhardware and software.\n\n152\n00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:49.265\nSo what actually starts\noff financial management?\n\n153\n00:08:49.265 --> 00:08:53.205\nWell, financial management, it's about\nthe accounting and the budgeting,\n\n154\n00:08:53.205 --> 00:08:54.395\nand charging.\n\n155\n00:08:54.395 --> 00:09:00.518\nSo financial management will take inputs\nand take triggers from reporting cycles.\n\n156\n00:09:00.518 --> 00:09:03.085\nSo do we do this every month?\n\n157\n00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:04.108\nDo we do it every three months?\n\n158\n00:09:04.108 --> 00:09:07.000\nDo we do it every six months or\nevery year?\n\n159\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.907\nPlease don't leave your accounting\nuntil once a year to do,\n\n160\n00:09:09.907 --> 00:09:12.703\nbecause then you're gonna spend\na lot of time doing that.\n\n161\n00:09:12.703 --> 00:09:17.410\nWhenever there's a new service,\nwe're going to be asked to assist with\n\n162\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.892\npre-program ROI,\nthat return on that investment.\n\n163\n00:09:20.892 --> 00:09:26.517\nWhenever we want to start introducing\ncharging for instance then at that point\n\n164\n00:09:26.517 --> 00:09:33.370\nin time we are going to bring in financial\nmanagement to help us with that charging.\n\n165\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.790\nWhenever we've got a request for\nchange for new service,\n\n166\n00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.960\nwe'll bring financial\nmanagement in to help us\n\n167\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.879\nquantify whether that new service\nis going to be a viable service.\n\n168\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.777\nSo the inputs that we take for financial\nmanagement or all of our policies, and\n\n169\n00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:51.964\nour standards,\nthey come from the organization.\n\n170\n00:09:51.964 --> 00:09:56.121\nAnd all, well, all data sources where\nwe keep all financial information.\n\n171\n00:09:56.121 --> 00:10:00.865\nAnd in the U.S. we have something\ncalled Generally Accepted Accounting\n\n172\n00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:06.115\npractices as well, or any other\nlocally accepted accounting practices,\n\n173\n00:10:06.115 --> 00:10:09.385\nthey will all be inputting\nfinancial management.\n\n174\n00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:13.305\nWhat should come out to financial\nmanagement, is the return on investment\n\n175\n00:10:13.305 --> 00:10:19.300\nfor new services, it should be\ncost optimization recommendations.\n\n176\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:25.061\nWe obviously need to get out of service\nevaluations sorry from our services,\n\n177\n00:10:25.061 --> 00:10:30.201\nand compliance with any regulations\nthat we may need to comply with,\n\n178\n00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:34.032\nany government or\nany legislative requirements.\n\n179\n00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:38.382\nSo what about our INTERFACES then?\n\n180\n00:10:38.382 --> 00:10:43.246\nWell, Service Asset and Configuration\nManagement are going to tell us what\n\n181\n00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:45.760\ncomponents we have for what services.\n\n182\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.155\nTake a look back at previous episode.\n\n183\n00:10:48.155 --> 00:10:52.085\nAnd you will see, why Ronnie and\nI worked out exactly or\n\n184\n00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:58.245\nleast we attempted to work out, exactly\nhow much a specific service would cost.\n\n185\n00:10:58.245 --> 00:11:00.120\nIt's not as easy as you may think.\n\n186\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.330\nWhich is why we need somebody with\na financial brain on their shoulders too.\n\n187\n00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.866\nBut because it's not as\neasy as you may think,\n\n188\n00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:10.703\nwe're gonna have to get a lot of our\ninformation from service asset and\n\n189\n00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:14.476\nconfiguration management,\ncuz they have all of the information for\n\n190\n00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:18.600\nall of our services and\nwhat components make up our services.\n\n191\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.710\nThe business relationship management and\n\n192\n00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:26.060\nchange management as well, will tell us\nwhat new changes are in the pipeline.\n\n193\n00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.190\nAnd what new strategies\nthe organization are bringing in.\n\n194\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.939\nBusiness relationship\nmanagement also tells us what’s\n\n195\n00:11:33.939 --> 00:11:35.491\nvaluable to the organization.\n\n196\n00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:40.841\nSo that allows us to quantify our services\nin terms of what’s valuable to them.\n\n197\n00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:44.665\nNow I've already mentioned service\ncontinuity management about\n\n198\n00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:47.062\nperforming business imparts analysis.\n\n199\n00:11:47.062 --> 00:11:51.750\nIf we can understand the valuation\nof a service and the return.\n\n200\n00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.730\nThat we get in on a particular service,\n\n201\n00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.730\nwe can understand how valuable\nthat service is to the business.\n\n202\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.450\nAnd of course we can then use that\n\n203\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.930\nto calculate the impact to the business\nfor the service being unavailable.\n\n204\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.130\nAnd that helps us with\ncontinuity management and\n\n205\n00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.670\nalso with capacity management and\ndemand management as well.\n\n206\n00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.404\nAs we move into the future.\n\n207\n00:12:13.404 --> 00:12:18.691\nDemand management will predict how much\ndemand we have for a specific service.\n\n208\n00:12:18.691 --> 00:12:22.503\nDemand management also talks about\ninfluencing customer behavior and\n\n209\n00:12:22.503 --> 00:12:25.878\nwe'll talk a little bit more\nabout that in following episode.\n\n210\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.127\nAnd then of course service\nportfolio management.\n\n211\n00:12:29.127 --> 00:12:32.881\nWell, that's our list of services,\nboth the services that are coming in and\n\n212\n00:12:32.881 --> 00:12:35.270\nthe services that we're\ncurrently providing.\n\n213\n00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:41.190\nAnd so we need to have a service valuation\nfor every single one of those services,\n\n214\n00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.900\nand certainly services\nthat are in our pipeline.\n\n215\n00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.276\nWell, those services we need to\ncompile a business case for, and\n\n216\n00:12:48.276 --> 00:12:53.943\nhere in financial management, well we take\naccountability for the business case.\n\n217\n00:12:53.943 --> 00:12:58.738\nAnd therefore we need to be able to\ncalculate the pre-program ROI for\n\n218\n00:12:58.738 --> 00:13:03.368\nall new services, and\nthen after a service has been implemented,\n\n219\n00:13:03.368 --> 00:13:08.594\nwe also then will calculate\nthe post-program ROI after implementation.\n\n220\n00:13:08.594 --> 00:13:14.530\nJust a little word of warning their\nabout pre-program and post-program ROI.\n\n221\n00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.178\nCertainly with post program ROI you\ndon't wanna calculate the return on\n\n222\n00:13:18.178 --> 00:13:21.358\nthe investment, the minute\na services is being implemented.\n\n223\n00:13:21.358 --> 00:13:23.278\nYou've gotta let it bed in so\n\n224\n00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:27.689\nthat you can really understand\nthis true values to the business.\n\n225\n00:13:27.689 --> 00:13:31.054\nSo now I'm gonna look at\na critical success factors.\n\n226\n00:13:31.054 --> 00:13:36.013\nNow, I just want you to bear in mind\nthat over the next three pages we've got\n\n227\n00:13:36.013 --> 00:13:39.830\nexamples, examples of\ncritical success factors.\n\n228\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.260\nAnd the KPIs that might help us\n\n229\n00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:47.170\ndemonstrate whether we have achieved\nthose critical success factors.\n\n230\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:53.234\nWhen you implement critical success\nfactors for your organization,\n\n231\n00:13:53.234 --> 00:13:57.970\nyou have to think about\nstarting small keep it simple.\n\n232\n00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.786\nAnd keep it to scale and keep it relevant.\n\n233\n00:14:01.786 --> 00:14:05.926\nThe smaller the organization then\nthe fewer critical success factors that\n\n234\n00:14:05.926 --> 00:14:07.170\nyou may need.\n\n235\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.760\nLet's try not to over complicate\neverything, we can build on the number of\n\n236\n00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:18.120\ncritical success factors and KPI's as\nan organization or as a process matures.\n\n237\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.560\nSo let's take a look then at some critical\nsuccess factors that we may have for\n\n238\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.670\nfinancial management.\n\n239\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.570\nSome of these are fairly obvious,\n\n240\n00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.930\nsuch as the framework to\nmanage financial information.\n\n241\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.970\nWe're gonna get that from\nthe organization because of course,\n\n242\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.030\nwe have to adhere to their policies.\n\n243\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.032\nSo we're going to get that, so\nthese KPIs about regular reports and\n\n244\n00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:48.039\naccurate and timely submission of\nfinancial reports that's about\n\n245\n00:14:48.039 --> 00:14:52.714\nadherence to the enterprise\nfinancial management policies.\n\n246\n00:14:52.714 --> 00:14:56.850\nFinancial evaluation is the key\npart of strategy evaluation.\n\n247\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.240\nWell, I expect all strategies\nto include financial analysis,\n\n248\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.642\nbecause we has to have that pre\nprogram ROI in the business case.\n\n249\n00:15:05.642 --> 00:15:09.343\nSo I want to see as a KPI\nunder this particular CSF,\n\n250\n00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:14.732\nI want to see the production of\nthe business case for every near service.\n\n251\n00:15:14.732 --> 00:15:19.440\nAnd what about having adequate funding to\nsupport service provision going forward?\n\n252\n00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.710\nWell I want to see that I've got\nenough budget for new services, and\n\n253\n00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.160\nthat we've got enough budget for\nexisting services as well.\n\n254\n00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.740\nAnd what about asset and\nconfiguration management,\n\n255\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.230\nclosely coupled to financial management.\n\n256\n00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.800\nMy configuration management system and my\nconfiguration management data bases should\n\n257\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.640\ncontain the financial\ninformation about our assets.\n\n258\n00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.681\nIn other words about\nthe components of our services.\n\n259\n00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:48.247\nI need to know how much this PC costs.\n\n260\n00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:53.096\nI can't calculate the value of a service\nif I don't know how much my components\n\n261\n00:15:53.096 --> 00:15:54.133\nare costing me.\n\n262\n00:15:54.133 --> 00:15:56.873\nSo that has to be in there.\n\n263\n00:15:56.873 --> 00:16:01.460\nNow If we're charging and\nwe're charging to a customer,\n\n264\n00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.889\nwhether it's internal or external and\nwe are charging at cost plus,\n\n265\n00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:12.128\nthen we need to not only understand\nwhat the cost is of that PC to us,\n\n266\n00:16:12.128 --> 00:16:16.640\nbut we also need to know what\nthe cost is to the customer.\n\n267\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.790\nIn other words, what are we charging?\n\n268\n00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:23.870\nBecause we may be charging for\ntotal cost of ownership and not just for\n\n269\n00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.080\nthe one-off purchase capital\nexpenditure on that PC.\n\n270\n00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.412\nThat I would expect to see in our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n271\n00:16:32.412 --> 00:16:37.796\nSo I'd expect to be able to get regular\nreports on utilization of assets and\n\n272\n00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:43.443\nregular reports on how much money we've\nspent recently on new acquisitions.\n\n273\n00:16:43.443 --> 00:16:46.980\nNow we need to be able to\nbalance between my income,\n\n274\n00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:53.005\nhow much money I've got coming in and my\nexpenses, how much money I've spent, okay?\n\n275\n00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:57.076\nThat's a difficult one because it just\nsays about achieving appropriate balance\n\n276\n00:16:57.076 --> 00:16:58.610\nbetween income and expenses.\n\n277\n00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.380\nWell, what is appropriate?\n\n278\n00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.379\nWell, the organization will tell\nyou what's appropriate, okay?\n\n279\n00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:06.680\nAnd that is also dependent on\nwhether you're an internal or\n\n280\n00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.810\nan external service provider.\n\n281\n00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.190\nSo I want to see trending on my costs,\ntrending on my expenditure.\n\n282\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:18.010\nHow much have I spent month on month, and\na comparison against maybe how much I\n\n283\n00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.940\nspent month on month in the previous year,\nand maybe a comparison against my\n\n284\n00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:28.210\nbudget and a comparison against how\nmuch I expect to see as an ROI.\n\n285\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.971\nJust remember, we start off simple.\n\n286\n00:17:30.971 --> 00:17:34.949\nAnd if we don't have all of that\ninformation available to us immediately,\n\n287\n00:17:34.949 --> 00:17:37.170\nthen that's okay, we start off simple.\n\n288\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.290\nAnd then we have other CSFs here as well.\n\n289\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.760\nTimeliness of information that\nallows better decision making.\n\n290\n00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.280\nThis goes back to knowledge management.\n\n291\n00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.380\nWe're talking about wisdom.\n\n292\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.050\nWe're talking about\ninformed decision making.\n\n293\n00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.831\nAnd this is about having\nthe right information available at\n\n294\n00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:55.284\nthe right time to enable\ninformed decision making.\n\n295\n00:17:55.284 --> 00:18:00.852\nNow, if we've got financial management\npolicies that come from our organization,\n\n296\n00:18:00.852 --> 00:18:06.110\nand they've given us a financial\nmanagement or an accounting package.\n\n297\n00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.430\nThen as long as we keep up\nto date with the process,\n\n298\n00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.670\nthen we'll have all of this information.\n\n299\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.070\nWe'll have financial reports\navailable at our fingertips.\n\n300\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:20.030\nThis goes back to what I was saying about\ndon't do your accounts once a year.\n\n301\n00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.810\nIf you do your accounts once a year,\nthen this becomes very cumbersome and\n\n302\n00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.330\nachieving these KPIs\nwill be quite difficult.\n\n303\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.730\nSomething else I want to\nbring to your attention here.\n\n304\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.186\nAnd I'm not doing this because I know\nthere's a question in the sample paper\n\n305\n00:18:35.186 --> 00:18:39.340\nabout this, but I do know there's\na question in the sample paper about this.\n\n306\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.490\nBut I want you to be very careful\nabout making assumptions.\n\n307\n00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.262\nDo not assume that if you don't\nadhere to a particular policy that\n\n308\n00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:55.357\nthere are going to be fines or warnings,\nto do with a specific nonadherence.\n\n309\n00:18:55.357 --> 00:19:02.220\nOr anything to do with, maybe you'd be\nstripped of certification or whatever.\n\n310\n00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.150\nWhen it comes to aproaching\nyour tests just please be very,\n\n311\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.190\nvery careful that you don't\nmake any assumptions.\n\n312\n00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.740\nAnd if it doesn't say that you're going\nto get a fine because of a policy,\n\n313\n00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.650\nthen don't assume that you are, okay?\n\n314\n00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.485\nThat's just a little tip for\n\n315\n00:19:18.485 --> 00:19:23.236\nyour examination there that I thought\nI'd throw in at this point in time.\n\n316\n00:19:23.236 --> 00:19:26.908\nAnother CSF is that we can account for\nthe money that we spent.\n\n317\n00:19:26.908 --> 00:19:31.472\nWell, yes, we need to be able to know\nhow much money we have spent, okay?\n\n318\n00:19:31.472 --> 00:19:36.360\nAnd that we can charge if we need to,\nand it says where appropriate.\n\n319\n00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.640\nAnd in terms of appropriateness,\n\n320\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.240\nwell that's down to the agreement\nthat you have with the organization.\n\n321\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.970\nOne of the biggest challenges that we\nhave got to financial management, and\n\n322\n00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.720\nI'm looking at all of these\nchallenges underneath here and\n\n323\n00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.460\nthings like charging might be\ndifficult and balancing the cost.\n\n324\n00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.640\nThe biggest challenge that we have got to\nfinancial management is actually finding\n\n325\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.750\nsomebody with the right skills.\n\n326\n00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.170\nThat's the biggest challenge.\n\n327\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:11.030\nFinancial management is going to be very,\nvery difficult if we don't have someone\n\n328\n00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.230\nthat understands both finances and\nIT as well.\n\n329\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.560\nWe can't just bring in an accountant and\nexpect them to know, nor\n\n330\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.630\ncan we give this role to an IT person and\nexpect them to know accounting policies.\n\n331\n00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.400\nWe do have to have somebody\nwith the right mix of skills.\n\n332\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.206\nAs it says it's difficult\nto control financial data.\n\n333\n00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:33.830\nIt's difficult to know where to\nfind some financial data, okay?\n\n334\n00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.850\nSo we've got to be very, very careful.\n\n335\n00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:40.020\nAnd we've got to ensure that we've got\nsomebody with the right skills to be able\n\n336\n00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.540\nto do this.\n\n337\n00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.936\nAnd once we've implemented\nfinancial management, well,\n\n338\n00:20:45.936 --> 00:20:51.612\nwe need to make sure that we keep that\ndedicated financial management person,\n\n339\n00:20:51.612 --> 00:20:54.975\nokay, that we keep it\nas a dedicated process.\n\n340\n00:20:54.975 --> 00:20:59.020\nAnd even though it's already managed\nat enterprise level as it says there,\n\n341\n00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.510\nit's still managed separately within IT.\n\n342\n00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:06.031\nBecause our expenditure is completely\ndifferent to the expenditure in\n\n343\n00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:07.999\nthe rest of the organization.\n\n344\n00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:08.607\nYou see,\n\n345\n00:21:08.607 --> 00:21:13.720\nit says there that a lack of financial\nmanagement may lead to penalties.\n\n346\n00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.270\nMay, just remember that may, okay?\n\n347\n00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.800\nBut ultimately, as I've said,\nwe've still got to maintain\n\n348\n00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.830\nthe skills within IT to be able\nto manage our own IT finances.\n\n349\n00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:34.860\nNow, I know that all of that [LAUGH] has\nbeen quite a lot of information for you.\n\n350\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:40.532\nCertainly, there are a lot of definitions\nthere, such as cost models and\n\n351\n00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:45.670\ncharging models and\ncost types and depreciation, etc.\n\n352\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.690\nWell, I want to ensure that\nyou have a good grasp of this.\n\n353\n00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.170\nAnd so there is an exercise in\nyour materials that I would\n\n354\n00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:58.190\nlike you to undertake right\nnow to help you understand\n\n355\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:03.590\nthis financial management and\nthe last two episodes that we've covered.\n\n356\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:07.590\nSo please take the time to go away and\nlook at this exercise.\n\n357\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.744\nIt'll take you probably around\nabout 30 to 45 minutes.\n\n358\n00:22:11.795 --> 00:22:14.595\nWe are available in the forum,\nin the chat.\n\n359\n00:22:14.595 --> 00:22:20.255\nSo if you do have any issues, if you do\nhave any questions, then please come back.\n\n360\n00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:24.525\nAnd I'll be more than happy to help\nyou with anything that you may have.\n\n361\n00:22:24.525 --> 00:22:26.225\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, thank you again for\n\n362\n00:22:26.225 --> 00:22:30.590\nhelping us out here as we take a look at\nthis part two of the financial management.\n\n363\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.300\nWe did talk about the budgeting,\naccounting, and\n\n364\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.180\ncharging in those activities\nthat we need to undertake.\n\n365\n00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.210\nAs well as the triggers that help us and\nwhat we're expecting on\n\n366\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:46.000\nthe inputs into the triggers, as well as\nthe outputs for the financial management.\n\n367\n00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.920\nThe interfaces, the critical success\nfactors, as well as the KPIs that we have.\n\n368\n00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.433\nAnd even the challenges and\n\n369\n00:22:52.433 --> 00:22:57.080\nrisks that we all must undertake as we\nactually face financial management.\n\n370\n00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.060\nBut this is a great place for\nus to also end this episode.\n\n371\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.870\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n372\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:04.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

00:00:12.180\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.565\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:19.420\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy Show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.960\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n7\n00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.940\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at demand management.\n\n8\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.940\nAnd here to help us out\nof course is gonna be,\n\n9\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.150\nwell, our ITIL royalty herself,\nJo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.560\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.550\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n12\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.430\nI'm loving the sort of role\nconnotations that come with\n\n13\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.650\nservice strategy by the way.\n\n14\n00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.564\nI'm just saying this.\n\n15\n00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:40.910\n&gt;&gt; I will try even more.\n\n16\n00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.684\nSo there's plenty of landed titles out\nthere I believe that we can just abscond\n\n17\n00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:45.720\nwith anyway.\n\n18\n00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.690\nSo nobody's really gonna know\ntoo much about this right here.\n\n19\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.710\nBut as we start to move into\nin the service strategy and\n\n20\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.520\nnow demand management, Jo,\nthis is not as simple as it sounds.\n\n21\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.160\nI just tell you what I want and\nthat's all that it takes, right?\n\n22\n00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.898\nDemands?\n\n23\n00:01:01.898 --> 00:01:06.590\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not [LAUGH], and in fact,\nthis is everybody's misconception about\n\n24\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.228\ndemand management\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n25\n00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:10.430\n&gt;&gt; It's all about supply and\ndemand isn't it?\n\n26\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.720\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Not quite, actually demand management\n\n27\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.390\nis, well, we use it in conjunction\nwith capacity management.\n\n28\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.820\nAnd yes, it is all about\nunderstanding demand from people, but\n\n29\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.470\nit's also about influencing\ntheir behavior.\n\n30\n00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.050\nSo yes, we understand their demand, but\n\n31\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.280\nwe also want to influence their\nbehavior in order to meet their demand.\n\n32\n00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.682\nWell, that sounds a little bit strange,\ndoesn't it?\n\n33\n00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:38.340\nI'm gonna give you an example and\nwe're gonna start off with an example.\n\n34\n00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.740\nPut it into perspective.\n\n35\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.730\nAnd then once we've done that, then it's\nfairly obvious what demand management is.\n\n36\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.190\nSo let's imagine just for a moment\nthat it's the week before Christmas.\n\n37\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.200\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n38\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.230\n&gt;&gt; And you are trying to\nbook a flight to go home and\n\n39\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.499\nsee your family on Christmas Eve.\n\n40\n00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:59.470\nHow much you gonna pay for that flight?\n\n41\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.360\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna pay a lot for that flight.\n\n42\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.548\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\ndo you get any special service?\n\n43\n00:02:05.548 --> 00:02:06.440\n&gt;&gt; You'll get a seat.\n\n44\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.701\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You'll get a seat.\n\n45\n00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:12.205\nWhere it will be leather clad seat,\na very comfortable seat in first\n\n46\n00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:16.200\nclass that reclines right the way back so\nyou can lay down?\n\n47\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.640\n&gt;&gt; You won't even get a pillow.\n\n48\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.390\n&gt;&gt; You won't even get a pillow.\n\n49\n00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.390\nWhat about then champagne\nwhen you first get on board?\n\n50\n00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.625\n&gt;&gt; Only if you bring it with you.\n\n51\n00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't think you're\nallowed to do that any more, are you?\n\n52\n00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:27.480\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so either.\n\n53\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.833\n&gt;&gt; No, you're going to get the same\nbag of peanuts [INAUDIBLE].\n\n54\n00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:30.668\n&gt;&gt; That's true, right.\n\n55\n00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:34.052\n&gt;&gt; Probably just a little bit\nfaster cuz it's Christmas Eve and\n\n56\n00:02:34.052 --> 00:02:36.890\neverybody wants to get home, right?\n\n57\n00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.800\nBut yet, if you were to travel the week\nbefore, what difference would there be?\n\n58\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.590\n&gt;&gt; The price difference would be\nmuch lower is what I would see.\n\n59\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, why do you think that is?\n\n60\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.921\n&gt;&gt; Not as many people would be traveling\nthat week as the week of Christmas.\n\n61\n00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:58.530\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's something that we\ncall differential challenging.\n\n62\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.140\nAnd it's a technique that we use in demand\nmanagement to influence people's behavior.\n\n63\n00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.500\nLet me elaborate on this\na little bit further.\n\n64\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.287\nSo you travel the week before Christmas.\n\n65\n00:03:09.287 --> 00:03:12.660\nNow we know, sorry, the day before\nChristmas, on Christmas Eve.\n\n66\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.240\nAnd we know that there is going\nto an increased demand for\n\n67\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.960\nseats on a plane the day before Christmas.\n\n68\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.950\nBecause everybody wants to get home and\nspend Christmas with their family.\n\n69\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.537\nSo airlines will charge\nan additional fee for that.\n\n70\n00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:32.620\nAnd it's something, it's a technique\nwe call differential charging.\n\n71\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.250\nBecause we know that the week beforehand\nthat the airlines will charge a lower\n\n72\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.110\nfee for exactly the same seat\non exactly the same plane.\n\n73\n00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:46.660\nThey know that they're gonna have an\nincreased amount the day before Christmas.\n\n74\n00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.740\nAnd they've got two choices.\n\n75\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.280\nThey can either increase capacity,\n\n76\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.390\nthat's one choice, which is why I say\nthis is tied in with capacity management.\n\n77\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.780\nWe can increase capacity and\nwe can buy in more planes,\n\n78\n00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.460\nwhich means that we bring in more pilots.\n\n79\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.210\nWhich means we bring in more cabin crew.\n\n80\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.790\nWhich means we've got\nto find somewhere for\n\n81\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.660\nthose planes to sit when they're not\nbeing used for the rest of the year.\n\n82\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.570\nAnd we've got to find something for those\npilots to do when they're not flying for\n\n83\n00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.500\nthe rest of the year.\n\n84\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.340\nAnd both the planes and\n\n85\n00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.900\nthe pilots have got to do a minimum\nnumber of air miles per year.\n\n86\n00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.440\nAnd we've also got to find something\nto do with our cabin crew for\n\n87\n00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.520\nthe rest of the year as well.\n\n88\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.040\nSo that means that we have a lot\nof spare capacity if we do that.\n\n89\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.130\nThe other option is this\ndifferential charging.\n\n90\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.330\nIn that we increase the price of\nthe seat the day before Christmas.\n\n91\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.380\nBecause what we want to do is try and\nencourage people\n\n92\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.290\nto fly the week before when we\ndo have some spare capacity.\n\n93\n00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.950\nThis is, as I've said, a technique\nthat we call differential charging.\n\n94\n00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.754\nCharging a different amount for\n\n95\n00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:57.903\nexactly the same service\nbased on certain parameters.\n\n96\n00:04:57.903 --> 00:05:00.780\nIn this case, the time of the year.\n\n97\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.220\nThis is all about identifying peaks and\ntroughs.\n\n98\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.870\nKnowing that there is an increased\ndemand the day before Christmas.\n\n99\n00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.930\nAnd what we want to try and\n\n100\n00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.950\ndo is we want to try and\neven out those peaks and troughs.\n\n101\n00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.440\nSo instead of being like this,\nit's more like this.\n\n102\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.950\nWhich allows us then to purchase\ncapacity at a set rate.\n\n103\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.870\nIf we were to purchase capacity at\nthis rate, then when we have a trough,\n\n104\n00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.050\nwe've got a huge amount\nof spare capacity there.\n\n105\n00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.580\nAnd that's expensive.\n\n106\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.510\nIt's a waste of money.\n\n107\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.630\nSo we do what we call analyze PBAs,\nor patterns of business activity.\n\n108\n00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.170\nIt's analyzing peaks and troughs.\n\n109\n00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.890\nAnd we do that so that we can then\ninfluence customer and user behavior.\n\n110\n00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.645\nIn other words, we can try and\nencourage people, in this instance,\n\n111\n00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.411\nto travel the week beforehand.\n\n112\n00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.020\nNow this is a technique that we\nuse in IT as well, by the way.\n\n113\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.270\nIf we know that we have Monday morning.\n\n114\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.850\nEverybody comes in and\neverybody wants to download their emails.\n\n115\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.450\nAnd we know that there's an increased\nbandwidth usage on Monday morning,\n\n116\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.272\nbecause everybody's\ndownloading their emails.\n\n117\n00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:18.500\nProblem being, of course, that,\nwell, it slows the network down.\n\n118\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.300\nBut we've got a sales team that\nwe know need to get out and\n\n119\n00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.990\nabout and\nget out on the road at 8 AM one morning.\n\n120\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.270\nWell, in that case then, what we might\nchoose to do is to use user profiles, use\n\n121\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:37.130\ntheir profile to give them priority on the\nnetwork before 8 AM on a Monday morning.\n\n122\n00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.820\nAnd so we slow everyone else's access.\n\n123\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.230\nAgain, using user profiles,\n\n124\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.360\nwe slow everybody else's access down until\nafter the sales team have left the office.\n\n125\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.891\nAnd again, that's a technique we use,\nworkload balancing,\n\n126\n00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.734\na technique we use in demand management.\n\n127\n00:06:54.734 --> 00:06:57.640\nYou see, the other option is\nthat we increase the bandwidth.\n\n128\n00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.415\nBut then again, by 10 AM on Monday, well,\n\n129\n00:07:01.415 --> 00:07:06.260\nwe've freed up a lot of bandwidth\nbecause that need is no longer there.\n\n130\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.600\nSo we would have spare capacity on our\nbandwidth for the rest of the week.\n\n131\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.010\nSo we don't want to buy in more bandwidth.\n\n132\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.125\nAnd we use this technique not just for\nbandwidth and it's not just for\n\n133\n00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:21.410\nairlines but we also use it for storage\nbasics, etc., as well, and for memory too.\n\n134\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.920\nSo the objective of demand\nmanagement is actually to, well,\n\n135\n00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.210\nas it says on our slides here,\nidentify patterns of business activity.\n\n136\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.200\nSo as to understand and\nanticipate customer demand.\n\n137\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.210\nBut then influence customer\ndemand using user profiling or\n\n138\n00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.560\nsomething like differential charging,\nfor instance.\n\n139\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.713\nSo we work with capacity management\nto prevent and manage demands, okay.\n\n140\n00:07:49.713 --> 00:07:53.966\nWhat we want to do is ensure\nthat we have enough demand but\n\n141\n00:07:53.966 --> 00:07:57.140\nwe don't want to have too much capacity.\n\n142\n00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.830\nSo we have enough capacity to\nmeet the demand but not too much.\n\n143\n00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.950\nOkay, so we want to influence behavior\nin order to fulfill a capacity need.\n\n144\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.610\nAnd so when we agree an implement\nmeasures to influence demand,\n\n145\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.300\nwe do that in conjunction\nwith our customers.\n\n146\n00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.150\nWe do this in our service level agreement,\nit is agreed.\n\n147\n00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.390\nWe're focusing on the business side.\n\n148\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.790\nWe're focusing on the user aspects.\n\n149\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.392\nSo what we don't want to do is have\na detrimental effect to our users.\n\n150\n00:08:27.392 --> 00:08:31.705\nBut at the same time, we also think\nabout the fact that we have just,\n\n151\n00:08:31.705 --> 00:08:36.190\nin a previous episode,\nwe just looked at financial management.\n\n152\n00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.390\nAnd we have to be able to justify\na return on an investment.\n\n153\n00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.370\nAnd having spare capacity sitting\naround is a waste of space and\n\n154\n00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.660\nit's also a waste of money.\n\n155\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.187\nSo we will go back to our customers.\n\n156\n00:08:49.187 --> 00:08:54.019\nAnd we will say to our business customers,\nhey, look, if we have all of this spare\n\n157\n00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:58.140\ncapacity around, it's a waste of money,\nso this what we want to do.\n\n158\n00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.970\nWe want to do some workload balancing.\n\n159\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.907\nIs this okay with you?\n\n160\n00:09:02.907 --> 00:09:04.118\nFor the most part,\n\n161\n00:09:04.118 --> 00:09:08.812\nI would say that when we influence\nbehavior in a way that I've described,\n\n162\n00:09:08.812 --> 00:09:14.070\non a Monday morning, we give the sales\nteam a priority over our network.\n\n163\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.510\nFor the most part,\nit's pretty unnoticeable, but yet,\n\n164\n00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.070\nit's something that saves\nus a huge amount of money.\n\n165\n00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.510\nSo here, we look at this particular slide.\n\n166\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.350\nHere, we look at both demand and\ncapacity management.\n\n167\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.890\nCapacity management will look\nto meet capacity requirements.\n\n168\n00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:32.769\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n169\n00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:34.939\nWe're doing it cost effectively, but\n\n170\n00:09:34.939 --> 00:09:37.842\nwe wanna make sure that\nwe've got enough capacity.\n\n171\n00:09:37.842 --> 00:09:42.412\nSo we look at current and future\nrequirements and we produce a capacity\n\n172\n00:09:42.412 --> 00:09:46.759\nplan that ensures we've got\nthe appropriate levels of capacity.\n\n173\n00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:51.275\nWhereas demand management is\nunderstanding the demand,\n\n174\n00:09:51.275 --> 00:09:56.434\nunderstanding peaks and troughs,\nanticipating as it says here,\n\n175\n00:09:56.434 --> 00:10:02.975\nby identifying patterns of business\nbehavior, but then influencing activities,\n\n176\n00:10:02.975 --> 00:10:08.120\ninfluencing user behavior in\norder to meet the demand.\n\n177\n00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.030\nSo this is about anticipating increases\nand decreases, anticipating our peaks and\n\n178\n00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.540\ntroughs, and then influencing behavior.\n\n179\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.700\nSo capacity management looks\nat increasing capacity.\n\n180\n00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.810\nDemand management looks at alternative\nmethods to meet the capacity requirements.\n\n181\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.363\nIt's about achieving this\nbalance between the cost and\n\n182\n00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:33.545\nthe value of the service that it supports,\nokay?\n\n183\n00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:39.215\nSo it enables us to look at the real\ninvestment of our services because\n\n184\n00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:44.320\nwe can identify areas where we\nhaven't quite met the demand.\n\n185\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.036\nAnd maybe we've lost on capacity, and\n\n186\n00:10:47.036 --> 00:10:50.995\nwe've had a failure because\nwe've run out of capacity.\n\n187\n00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:56.320\nBut then we also have huge big instances\nwhere we have too much capacity.\n\n188\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.730\nWe don't want to have spare\ncapacity lying around,\n\n189\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.290\nespecially when it comes to technology.\n\n190\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.180\nYou know, we've mentioned earlier,\n\n191\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.050\nin earlier episodes in service strategy,\nvalue diminishes over time.\n\n192\n00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.832\nAnd the problem is that our technology\nalso gets out of date really,\n\n193\n00:11:12.832 --> 00:11:13.830\nreally quickly.\n\n194\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.610\nSo if I brought in more\ncapacity this week,\n\n195\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:22.820\nthat technology might be redundant\ntechnology next week or next months.\n\n196\n00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.160\nIt might be technology that we\nsimply just can't use anymore.\n\n197\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.760\nSo we don't want to invest in more\ncapacity unless we absolutely have to.\n\n198\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.190\nIt's about understanding that our\ncustomers don't wanna pay for\n\n199\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.320\nspare capacity, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.840\nWe wanna have that balance\nbetween risk and cost.\n\n201\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.580\nWe don't wanna run out of capacity, but\nthen, we don't wanna spend a huge amount\n\n202\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.520\nof money and then have a lot of\nidle capacity sitting around.\n\n203\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.909\nBecause we're just spending money for\nabsolutely nothing.\n\n204\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.700\nSo here, on this particular slide,\nwhat we're looking at, and\n\n205\n00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.400\nI want you to start off here on\nthe left-hand side under our business\n\n206\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.810\nprocesses, and\nwe call this our demand belt, okay?\n\n207\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.056\nAnd starting off from the left-hand side,\n\n208\n00:12:07.056 --> 00:12:09.220\nyou'll see the Patterns\nof Business Activity.\n\n209\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.180\nAnd then, let me find my cursor for you,\nPatterns of Business Activity here,\n\n210\n00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.960\nwell, they generate demand.\n\n211\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.300\nAnd note that demand is generated and\nit comes into IT here.\n\n212\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.180\nAnd IT,\nwe use our processes to deliver a service.\n\n213\n00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.696\nHere, we are delivering a service.\n\n214\n00:12:28.696 --> 00:12:31.933\nAnd the more functionality\nthat we deliver and\n\n215\n00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:36.505\nthe more value we deliver,\nthen the more demand that generates.\n\n216\n00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:42.507\nAnd so the more demand that generates,\nthen the more we use our processes,\n\n217\n00:12:42.507 --> 00:12:48.613\nand the, well, the better the service\nthat we can deliver to our business.\n\n218\n00:12:48.613 --> 00:12:52.160\nNow, this isn't uniform,\nand this is the problem.\n\n219\n00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.720\nSometimes, it gets fast,\nsometimes, it gets slow.\n\n220\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.660\nAnd what we're doing here is we're\nutilizing demand management to\n\n221\n00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.730\nput a brake on that wheel,\nput a brake on that belt essentially, and\n\n222\n00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:08.060\nslow it down so that it is all one speed.\n\n223\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.430\nSo all of this, it just goes at one speed.\n\n224\n00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.980\nIt doesn't go quickly one minute and\nthen very slowly the next.\n\n225\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.762\nIt just goes at one,\nsteady, constant speed.\n\n226\n00:13:20.762 --> 00:13:23.220\nAnd that's what demand\nmanagement is trying to do.\n\n227\n00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.238\nSo here, we have in the top of our screen\nhere, we have our business processes.\n\n228\n00:13:30.238 --> 00:13:33.838\nNow, our businesses processes\nare what we are facilitating, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:33.838 --> 00:13:36.868\nAnd of course,\nit's our business plan that drive those.\n\n230\n00:13:36.868 --> 00:13:41.694\nAnd demand is dictated or\nis driven by the number of people and\n\n231\n00:13:41.694 --> 00:13:46.236\nhow often they're using these\nbusiness processes, and\n\n232\n00:13:46.236 --> 00:13:50.840\nthat obviously then\ncreates business activity.\n\n233\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.800\nAnd that business activity then,\nwell, that's translated to\n\n234\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.890\nus in terms of service requests and\nalso service incident.\n\n235\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:04.040\nSo in other words, using our services and\nhaving issues with our services too.\n\n236\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.495\nAnd that creates additional demand on,\nsay, our service desk.\n\n237\n00:14:07.495 --> 00:14:10.365\nAnd if we've got additional\ndemand on our service desk,\n\n238\n00:14:10.365 --> 00:14:15.475\nthen we've got additional demand\non our capacity plans as well.\n\n239\n00:14:15.475 --> 00:14:20.970\nSo what we want to do is instead of\nalways having demand increasing,\n\n240\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.040\nwe want to influence behavior.\n\n241\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.490\nAnd in this particular example here,\n\n242\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.280\nlooking at activity-based\ndemand management.\n\n243\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.857\nThen what we will do is\nat this point in time,\n\n244\n00:14:32.857 --> 00:14:38.078\nif we look at business activity,\nwe might want to, right here,\n\n245\n00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:42.525\nput in a lot of frequently\nasked questions, etc., so\n\n246\n00:14:42.525 --> 00:14:47.554\nthat we add in a step into this\nparticular process to hopefully\n\n247\n00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:53.481\nease the demand on the service desk\nat this particular instance, okay?\n\n248\n00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:55.174\nCuz what we don't want to do, and\n\n249\n00:14:55.174 --> 00:14:59.380\nit's exactly the same with capacity\nplanning for absolutely everything.\n\n250\n00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.050\nWhat we don't wanna do is have too many\nservice desk analysts sitting around,\n\n251\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.980\ndoing nothing.\n\n252\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.980\nJust anticipating a call\ncoming in on a Monday morning.\n\n253\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.830\nBecause we might have more people call\nin on Monday morning than we do for\n\n254\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:13.840\nthe rest of the week.\n\n255\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.140\nAnd then, we've got a lot of people\nthat are going to be sitting around for\n\n256\n00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.120\nthe rest of the week.\n\n257\n00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:25.310\nSo demand management, it's a way of\nfulfilling capacity requirements\n\n258\n00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.690\nby influencing user behavior.\n\n259\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.163\nAnd that's what demand\nmanagement is doing.\n\n260\n00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:35.060\nIt's influencing user behavior.\n\n261\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.810\nSo let's take a look at the inputs\nthen into demand management.\n\n262\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.156\nWell, the inputs here\nare any new services,\n\n263\n00:15:41.156 --> 00:15:45.217\nany changes to any existing services,\nfor instance.\n\n264\n00:15:45.217 --> 00:15:48.717\nChanges to our customer service portfolio,\ncharging models,\n\n265\n00:15:48.717 --> 00:15:53.124\nbecause don't forget about differential\ncharging, as we've mentioned, and\n\n266\n00:15:53.124 --> 00:15:55.212\nany opportunities for improvement.\n\n267\n00:15:55.212 --> 00:16:01.092\nAnd those opportunities for improvement,\nby the way, could be opportunities\n\n268\n00:16:01.092 --> 00:16:06.093\nto improve The way we utilize our\nservices to influence behavior and\n\n269\n00:16:06.093 --> 00:16:10.590\nto have minimal use of our capacity or\noptimal should we say.\n\n270\n00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.420\nWhat about outputs then?\n\n271\n00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.740\nWell, what comes out of demand\nmanagement are user profiles and\n\n272\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.360\ndefined patterns of business activity and\npolicies for actually managing demand.\n\n273\n00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.826\nWhat starts it off unfortunately?\n\n274\n00:16:27.826 --> 00:16:32.741\n[LAUGH] what unusually starts off demand\nmanagement is that bullet point that's\n\n275\n00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:36.370\nthe second one up in the middle\narea of triggers there.\n\n276\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.520\nThe potential breach on an SLA,\n\n277\n00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.340\nwhat usually starts off\nthe demand management process?\n\n278\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.663\nWell, it's because we've had\neither a potential breach or\n\n279\n00:16:44.663 --> 00:16:46.236\nwe have breached capacity.\n\n280\n00:16:46.236 --> 00:16:49.648\nAnd we're looking for\nalternative ways to meet\n\n281\n00:16:49.648 --> 00:16:54.840\ncapacity requirements without\nbringing in additional capacity.\n\n282\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.580\nNow, it could be a breach that we expected\nand that we should have anticipated.\n\n283\n00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.420\nOr it could be a breach that we didn't\nexpect and we had an, what we call,\n\n284\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.130\nunexpected peak.\n\n285\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.490\nWhich would be that last\nbullet point under triggers,\n\n286\n00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.100\nan exception has occurred to forecast\npatents a business activity.\n\n287\n00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.410\nIt's an unexpected peak.\n\n288\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.090\nBut what else starts demand\nmanagement office a new service?\n\n289\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:19.340\nAnd in a new service,\nif we're bringing in a new service,\n\n290\n00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:24.370\nthen we're increasing the use of our\nnetwork and we're increasing the use of\n\n291\n00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.000\nour bandwidth because we're gonna\nput more traffic onto our network.\n\n292\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.042\nSo that could actually generate\nthen the implementation\n\n293\n00:17:32.042 --> 00:17:36.173\nof demand management within\nour infrastructure, okay?\n\n294\n00:17:36.173 --> 00:17:44.020\nSo think about our differing relationships\nhere with all of our processes.\n\n295\n00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.590\nWe've already looked at\ncapacity management.\n\n296\n00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.000\nBut let's think about what about\nservice portfolio management?\n\n297\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.210\nWell you might want to, and I'm just gonna\nstart here on the left hand side, and\n\n298\n00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.525\nthen just go around anti clockwise\njust to be awkward, I guess.\n\n299\n00:17:58.525 --> 00:18:01.870\n[LAUGH] And we'll look at\nservice portfolio management.\n\n300\n00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:05.847\nWell, our portfolio is our list\nof various existing services, and\n\n301\n00:18:05.847 --> 00:18:09.359\nalso our list of our new services\ncoming in in our pipeline.\n\n302\n00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:13.204\nAnd so with service portfolio and\nmanagement, I want to make sure that\n\n303\n00:18:13.204 --> 00:18:17.650\nwe've got enough capacity to be able to\nmeet the demand of all of those services.\n\n304\n00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.045\nThe financial financial management.\n\n305\n00:18:20.045 --> 00:18:23.645\nWell, that's the good one cuz that tells\nus how much money we've got to spend, and\n\n306\n00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:28.355\ninvariably tells us how much money\nwe've got to buy additional capacity.\n\n307\n00:18:28.355 --> 00:18:31.315\nAnd of course, we don't want a lot\nof spare capacity around anyway.\n\n308\n00:18:32.395 --> 00:18:35.675\nOne of the big dangers with financial\nmanagement is that they give us way too\n\n309\n00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:39.285\nmuch money, and we go out and\nwe spend on additional capacity.\n\n310\n00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.495\nAnd we end up with a lot of spare capacity\nsitting around that we don't need.\n\n311\n00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.048\nBusiness relationship management, well,\nthey give us the plans for the future.\n\n312\n00:18:47.048 --> 00:18:50.570\nSo they're gonna tell us what\nnew services are coming our way.\n\n313\n00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:55.501\nAnd the service level management, if we\nutilize in demand management techniques\n\n314\n00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:59.719\nsuch as workload balance,\ndifferential charging or to better appear\n\n315\n00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:03.738\nin that service level agreement,\nand it better be signed as well.\n\n316\n00:19:03.738 --> 00:19:07.880\nNow, we've looked at capacity\nmanagement and the interaction there.\n\n317\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.170\nWhat about event management?\n\n318\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.177\nWell, event management,\n\n319\n00:19:12.177 --> 00:19:16.527\nthat's telling us exactly what's\nhappening on our network right now.\n\n320\n00:19:16.527 --> 00:19:21.378\nAn event management, of course, will tell\nus where we've nearly had breaches and\n\n321\n00:19:21.378 --> 00:19:24.650\nwhere we have actually had\nbreaches in capacity usage.\n\n322\n00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:31.620\nValidation and testing, before we\nimplement any demand management technique.\n\n323\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.765\nWe really had better test it.\n\n324\n00:19:34.765 --> 00:19:37.750\n[LAUGH] We wanna make sure that it worked.\n\n325\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:42.280\nBecause if we implement a technique for\ninfluencing user behavior and\n\n326\n00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.740\nit doesn't work, then we're gonna have a\nbreach in capacity at some point in time.\n\n327\n00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.590\nAsset and configuration management.\n\n328\n00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.770\nWell of course they tell us\nexactly what services we have,\n\n329\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:58.230\nwhat shared components we have and exactly\nwhat these components are made up of.\n\n330\n00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:03.314\nSo asset and configuration management will\ntell us how much storage space we have.\n\n331\n00:20:03.314 --> 00:20:08.960\nIt will tell us how much memory we\nhave and how big our bandwidth is.\n\n332\n00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.510\nChange management well,\n\n333\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.740\nany change to any component could\nresult in the capacity related breach.\n\n334\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.000\nSo we may need to bring\nin demand management.\n\n335\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:26.720\nAnd of course service continuity\nmanagement, well, we have to ensure that\n\n336\n00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.150\nwhatever process and whatever activities,\nand whatever restrictions\n\n337\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:37.170\nwe place on any service, that they are\nreflected in our service continuity plan.\n\n338\n00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.140\nAnd we also have to ask the question,\nif we have vital business functions, and\n\n339\n00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.910\nthis ties in both availability management,\nand service continuity management.\n\n340\n00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.650\nIf we have vital business functions,\n\n341\n00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:55.160\nin other words those services that\nare vital to the organization,\n\n342\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.220\nthat the organization cannot live without,\ndo we really want to\n\n343\n00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:06.490\nimpose demand management on\nthose vital business functions?\n\n344\n00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.790\nDo we really want to do that?\n\n345\n00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.790\nOr do we want to increase\ncapacity in that instance?\n\n346\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.070\nThat's a question that only we can answer.\n\n347\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.860\nSo what about then, CSS and KPIs?\n\n348\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.520\nWell, I want to see just as key\nperformance indicators are on their own.\n\n349\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.140\nAnd in fact,\n\n350\n00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:30.920\nwe'll see these linked into the critical\nsuccess factors in the next slide.\n\n351\n00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.080\nI want to see that user\nprofiles are documented and\n\n352\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.620\nthat PBAs are documented,\npatents of business activity.\n\n353\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.820\nPeaks and troughs are documented for\neach service and\n\n354\n00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:46.660\nthat our capacity management plans,\nwell, they incorporate any\n\n355\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.915\nparticular demand management techniques\nthat we may be using for that service.\n\n356\n00:21:51.915 --> 00:21:55.775\nSo let's take those KPIs and\nthen let's tie them in to the CSS.\n\n357\n00:21:56.905 --> 00:22:02.283\nSo, in our CSS we wanna make sure that we,\nthat's us, that's the service provider,\n\n358\n00:22:02.283 --> 00:22:06.506\nhave identified patterns of business\nactivity for every service.\n\n359\n00:22:06.506 --> 00:22:12.186\nAnd that we that can, when needed,\nuse that in workload balancing and\n\n360\n00:22:12.186 --> 00:22:15.490\nthat we have defined user profiles.\n\n361\n00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:20.400\nNow access management as a process\nwithin service operation and\n\n362\n00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.650\nalso information security management\nas a process within service design.\n\n363\n00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.330\nThey are going to help\nus with user profiles.\n\n364\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:33.160\nThey help us by defining who should have\nwhat profile, who should have what access,\n\n365\n00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.250\nand that then is something that\nwe use then to manage demand.\n\n366\n00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.120\nSo what about services design\nto meet the PBAs, okay?\n\n367\n00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.621\nSo if we know that we're using\ndifferential charging and\n\n368\n00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:50.398\nI'm gonna go back to that airline for\na moment.\n\n369\n00:22:50.398 --> 00:22:54.237\nIf we know that we're using\ndifferential charging,\n\n370\n00:22:54.237 --> 00:22:58.161\nthen we know what schedules we have for\nour aircraft and\n\n371\n00:22:58.161 --> 00:23:03.477\nwe know exactly how many seats we have and\nwe know when we get to that point.\n\n372\n00:23:03.477 --> 00:23:08.119\nWell, we're starting to take people in a\nstandby list that perhaps we will be able\n\n373\n00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:11.700\nto recommend that they actually\nfly a little bit earlier.\n\n374\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.140\nBecause there is no guarantee\nthey're going to get a seat.\n\n375\n00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.440\nAnd even though the seat\nis really expensive,\n\n376\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.860\nperhaps they need to rethink\ntheir traveling plans, okay?\n\n377\n00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.990\nWe've gotta have a strong interface with\ncapacity management of course because\n\n378\n00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:32.130\npatterns of business activity we defined\nthese to analyze our usage of capacity.\n\n379\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.140\nAnd then that we will\ndecide that we want to\n\n380\n00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:41.290\nImplement demand management techniques\nto meet our capacity requirements.\n\n381\n00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:42.626\nWell, we might not want to.\n\n382\n00:23:42.626 --> 00:23:45.065\nWe might just want to increase capacity.\n\n383\n00:23:45.065 --> 00:23:48.950\nWe've got to work hand in hand\nwith capacity management and\n\n384\n00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.752\nwe have to make these decisions together.\n\n385\n00:23:51.752 --> 00:23:57.022\nSo capacity management will be continually\nmonitoring utilization rates And\n\n386\n00:23:57.022 --> 00:24:01.729\nat some point in time we'll be sitting\ndown with demand management and\n\n387\n00:24:01.729 --> 00:24:04.870\nsaying okay,\nwe're near a breach right now.\n\n388\n00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.860\nAnd, if it carries on and our capacity\nusage and our capacity forecasts\n\n389\n00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.850\ncarry in the way that they are,\nwe're going to be subject to a breach.\n\n390\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:21.020\nSo therefore we've got to look at\nanother way to meet those requirements,\n\n391\n00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.230\nwe've got to.\n\n392\n00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.780\nNow bottom CSF about the ability\nto deal with service demand,\n\n393\n00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:31.770\nwe've got to be able to deliver all\nof the demands of our service but\n\n394\n00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.810\nwe don't wanna spend too much\nmoney in doing it, okay?\n\n395\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.230\nWe don't want to have too much capacity.\n\n396\n00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.809\nWe can't do this without\ninformation from the business.\n\n397\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:46.600\nBusiness relationship management is going\nto help us a huge amount with this, and\n\n398\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.500\nwe can't do it without\ninformation from them.\n\n399\n00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:55.180\nAnd we can't do it without understanding\nwhat services we not only have right now,\n\n400\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.230\nbut what services we're going\nto bring in the future.\n\n401\n00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.630\nAnd it's exactly the same going forward.\n\n402\n00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:06.720\nYou know, the risk to demand management\nworking as an ongoing basis is\n\n403\n00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.560\nnot having that right information and\nalso not having the commitment from\n\n404\n00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.630\nthe business that they're willing\nto accept demand management.\n\n405\n00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.800\nIn which case,\nthen we have to increase capacity and\n\n406\n00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.600\nwe run the risk of having\nspare capacity around.\n\n407\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:29.410\nNow demand management seemed like a fairly\nshort process and we cover a lot of demand\n\n408\n00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:33.810\nmanagement also when we look at capacity\nmanagement in service design, too.\n\n409\n00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.630\nSo what I'd like you to do now is\nI'd like you just to take some time.\n\n410\n00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.770\nTake sort of 30 minutes or so\njust to review the notes that you've made\n\n411\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.440\nabout the demand management process, and\nif you feel that you have any questions or\n\n412\n00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.180\nany concerns at all about this, then\nplease feel free to come back to us via\n\n413\n00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.660\nthe forum and\nI'll be happy to help out where I can.\n\n414\n00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, thank you again for\n\n415\n00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.780\nhelping us to understand this\nidea of demand management.\n\n416\n00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.100\nI appreciated the very fact where you\ntalked about the whole goal behind this is\n\n417\n00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.320\nto be able influence what\nthe user actually is doing and\n\n418\n00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.800\nanticipate what's going on so\nthat we can help meet that demand as well.\n\n419\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.500\nThere's a lot of great information\nhere as you settle down and\n\n420\n00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.270\nthink more about demand management.\n\n421\n00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.670\nMake sure you take advantage of what\nJoe said, review these concepts This is\n\n422\n00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:25.680\nthe one that is easily misunderstood,\nso take some time to review that.\n\n423\n00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.480\nAll right.\n\n424\n00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.780\nThis is a great place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n425\n00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.951\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n426\n00:26:31.951 --> 00:26:33.132\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n427\n00:26:33.132 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:14.704\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:19.580\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Intermediate Strategy Show.\n\n5\n00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.018\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:24.470\nAnd today, we're diving into\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n7\n00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.984\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be,\n\n8\n00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:32.721\nwell our IT lady herself,\ndame, Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Jo, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:37.320\n&gt;&gt; Now, why do I always\nassociate the title dame with\n\n11\n00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.698\nsomebody who's an octogenarian or?\n\n12\n00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:41.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n13\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.693\nthat was not the intention there.\n\n14\n00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:46.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, [LAUGH] so moving on,\n\n15\n00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:50.629\n[LAUGH] here as we start to talk\nabout here the business relationship\n\n16\n00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.960\nmanagement in service strategy.\n\n17\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.686\nThis seems like a very\nappropriate topic for\n\n18\n00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:59.672\nthe idea of getting strategies set\nup in the way that you need to.\n\n19\n00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:04.433\nAnd really an important topic, because\nit really is, it seemed like joining\n\n20\n00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:09.180\nthat idea of the business,\nas what we're talking about with service.\n\n21\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.167\nAnd I think it's something that maybe some\nof us in IT kinda missed the boat on.\n\n22\n00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:16.531\n&gt;&gt; What we tend to do in IT,\nand what's happened, and\n\n23\n00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:21.011\nI suppose in one respect, it's easy for\nme to see the value in this.\n\n24\n00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:26.157\nBecause I come from this background,\nand I've been working with ITIL for\n\n25\n00:01:26.157 --> 00:01:31.723\na number of years now, which does actually\nmake me an octogenarian [INAUDIBLE].\n\n26\n00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:35.920\n[LAUGH] But,\nthere's a huge amount value to this.\n\n27\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.210\nWe can't just take business\nrequirements and try and translate them\n\n28\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.790\ninto something that we think the business\nwill win, and then deliver that.\n\n29\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.670\nThat's one of the biggest\nmistakes that we make in IT,\n\n30\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.130\nis really just not understand\nin our organization enough.\n\n31\n00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.443\nBusiness relationship management\nis really pretty much exactly\n\n32\n00:01:54.443 --> 00:01:55.894\nas it says on the can really.\n\n33\n00:01:55.894 --> 00:01:58.946\nIt's about managing\nthe relationship with our business.\n\n34\n00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:03.360\nNow, one of the biggest misconceptions\nabout business relationship management is\n\n35\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.700\nthat, it's a one off exercise that you\ndo maybe every two to three months.\n\n36\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.550\nAnd we'll tell you that absolutely not.\n\n37\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.194\nAnd in fact,\nyour business relationship manager,\n\n38\n00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:15.936\nwhilst they're part of IT, they should\nbe sat in with the organization.\n\n39\n00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:20.743\nYou see, business relationship\nmanagement is a role that\n\n40\n00:02:20.743 --> 00:02:26.430\nshould be partly proactive and\nshould be partly reactive.\n\n41\n00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.730\nYes, we should be listening\nto the organization.\n\n42\n00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.480\nWe should be listening when they say,\nI'd really like a technique that, or\n\n43\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.160\nI'd really like a tool that\ncould help me to do this.\n\n44\n00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.330\nI'm not very good at taking payments for\ninstance over the telephone.\n\n45\n00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.780\nI'm not very good at being able to talk\nat the same time and hold my phone and\n\n46\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.090\ntype at the same time.\n\n47\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.070\nI'd really like something\nthat could help me out.\n\n48\n00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.400\nWe shouldn't be the ones\nlistening when somebody says that.\n\n49\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.999\nWhat we should be doing is that,\n\n50\n00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.212\na business relationship manager should be\nstraight away looking at you and saying,\n\n51\n00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:05.363\nhang on a minute, you're trying to balance\na telephone, you're trying to type,\n\n52\n00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:08.186\nit doesn't look very comfortable,\ncan I help you out?\n\n53\n00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.950\nAnd that's where business relationship\nmanagement really comes into what it's\n\n54\n00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.170\nfor, and that's what business\nrelationship management should be doing.\n\n55\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.920\nWe should be proactively recommending\nimprovements to our organization.\n\n56\n00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.390\nWe should be proactively looking for\n\n57\n00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.750\nways that we can deliver\nvalue to the organization.\n\n58\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.570\nWe should be proactively looking for\n\n59\n00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.340\nways that we can facilitate\nthe organization's outcomes.\n\n60\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.370\nSure, we should be\nresponding to their request,\n\n61\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.880\nbecause we know we're gonna\nget request from them.\n\n62\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.350\nLet's face it, the business never consults\nus when they're making any changes.\n\n63\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.950\nThey never ask our permission\nbefore they go and\n\n64\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.270\nmerge with another organization or\nmake acquisitions.\n\n65\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.798\nBut you see, if we wait, if we sit\nin our own little bubble here in IT,\n\n66\n00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:04.720\nin our own little room, in our own\nlittle team, and we don't interact with\n\n67\n00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.211\nthe business then we can only be reactive,\nwe can't be proactive.\n\n68\n00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:14.062\nAnd there's so much more value to be\nin proactive than just the perception\n\n69\n00:04:14.062 --> 00:04:18.834\nbecause you, I saw the look on your\nface and when I say to you, well look,\n\n70\n00:04:18.834 --> 00:04:20.810\nhow about I'm watching you.\n\n71\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.140\nAnd I say, here, let me do this for\nyou, you're quite impressed, okay.\n\n72\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.915\nBut it's not just about that, because\nyou see, if I've seen you struggle,\n\n73\n00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:33.982\nas a business relationship manager, I have\nseen you struggle with something, and\n\n74\n00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:37.556\nI've looked it this and I saw,\nI'm sure it can do something for Ronnie.\n\n75\n00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:41.851\nI go back to IT, and\nI say to IT, here's my customer,\n\n76\n00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:46.820\nthis is the problem that he's having,\ncan we help him out?\n\n77\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.140\nAnd guess what?\n\n78\n00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.650\nEveryone in the service\nprovider is prepared.\n\n79\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.530\nSo I go to you and I say to you,\nhey, I can help you with this.\n\n80\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.490\nAnd you're impressed because\nI'm being proactive but\n\n81\n00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.450\neven more so,\nbecause IT you're already prepared for\n\n82\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.670\nthis, because they already have\na solution in mind for you.\n\n83\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.970\nSo it doesn't take us so\nlong to implement that solution,\n\n84\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.470\nbecause it's something that\nwe've already been prepared for.\n\n85\n00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.748\nWhereas if I sat back, and I sat in IT and\nI waited for you to come to me, well,\n\n86\n00:05:19.748 --> 00:05:25.030\nyou're gonna carry on with the discomfort\nof trying to work your phone,\n\n87\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.030\nand do all of this.\n\n88\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.310\nAnd you're probably gonna carry on for\na few months doing that before you finally\n\n89\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.410\ncome to me and say, hey,\ndo you reckon, you can help me?\n\n90\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.360\nYou might even not come to me, you might\neven might sort of get on to the Internet\n\n91\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.150\nand take a look to see what there is\navailable, and maybe you might try and\n\n92\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.750\nbuy something yourself that\nmight be able to help you.\n\n93\n00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.720\nWell look at what I have just done,\njust by sitting next to you and\n\n94\n00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.768\nby being proactive,\nI've really increased the value that, I,\n\n95\n00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:55.764\nas a representative of IT,\nare delivering to you the business.\n\n96\n00:05:55.764 --> 00:06:00.630\nI can't understand the business\nif I'm not in with the business.\n\n97\n00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.450\nAnd I can't understand\nthe challenges you face and\n\n98\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.800\nthe outcomes that you want to achieve,\nunless I'm there with you.\n\n99\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.310\nAnd you know what,\nsome of the most important conversations\n\n100\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.198\nare the ones that are held\nby the water cooler.\n\n101\n00:06:13.198 --> 00:06:18.098\nAnd they're the ones where we hear\neverything about what's happening with IT.\n\n102\n00:06:18.098 --> 00:06:22.895\nAnd we also hear the rumors about what's\nhappening with the future strategy of\n\n103\n00:06:22.895 --> 00:06:24.065\nthe business too.\n\n104\n00:06:24.065 --> 00:06:27.500\nAnd not gives us a heads off.\n\n105\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.660\nOkay, some of these rumors are not\nnecessarily the truth, and\n\n106\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.210\nwe cannot sort of divides the whole\nservice strategy based on the rumor.\n\n107\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.960\nYes, okay, we know all that, but\nnevertheless, it does give us a heads up.\n\n108\n00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.500\nAnd I wonder how many times there's\nbeen a conversation by the water cooler\n\n109\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.470\nthat actually is happened after\na conversation with the service desk.\n\n110\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.250\nYou know the ones, where the service\ndesk team so we're user and\n\n111\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.090\nsaid, is everything okay?\n\n112\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.930\nAre you happy?\n\n113\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.260\nAnd the users says, yeah.\n\n114\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.120\nYeah, I'm fine, thank you very much.\n\n115\n00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.099\nAnd they put the phone down and then they\nstood by the water cooler talking to\n\n116\n00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.832\na colleague, and actually,\nthey're not happy.\n\n117\n00:07:04.832 --> 00:07:06.630\nAnd that's when you hear the truth,\n\n118\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.800\nthat's when you hear about the fact that\nI've just spoken to the service desk.\n\n119\n00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.290\nIt took me way too long to get\nan answer on the telephone.\n\n120\n00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.270\nAnd although the person was nice and\n\n121\n00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.280\npolite, and they will resolve my issue\nonce I've managed to speak to them.\n\n122\n00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.485\nBut that queue is way too long.\n\n123\n00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:26.254\nWell, we don't hear that unless\nwe're there by the water cooler.\n\n124\n00:07:26.254 --> 00:07:30.371\nSo the key to business relationship\nmanagement is building up that\n\n125\n00:07:30.371 --> 00:07:33.670\nrelationship, it's building up that trust.\n\n126\n00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.399\nLook at the first bullet point here,\nlook at the purpose.\n\n127\n00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:39.448\nIt's establishing and\nmaintaining a relationship, and\n\n128\n00:07:39.448 --> 00:07:44.620\nidentifying business needs, and\nmanaging customer expectations.\n\n129\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.506\nYou are much more likely to pay for\nsomething if you see value in it.\n\n130\n00:07:47.506 --> 00:07:51.399\nIf I've been proactive in\nrecommending it to you,\n\n131\n00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:57.745\nthen if you're having to wait and for me\nto react to requests that you've given me.\n\n132\n00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:01.914\nThis is about understanding the customer\nperspective, and keeping our customers\n\n133\n00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:05.022\nhappy, and maintaining all of\nthat positive relationship.\n\n134\n00:08:05.022 --> 00:08:08.090\nIt's about liaising with our customers.\n\n135\n00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.050\nNow I wanna bring\nsomething else in as well.\n\n136\n00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.280\nI want to bring in that sort of,\nlast two bullet points, really.\n\n137\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.440\nWhich are about formal complaints and\nescalation procedures, but\n\n138\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.550\nalso about conflicts for\nresolving conflicts, conflict resolution.\n\n139\n00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.890\nI will mention, and I will talk at length\nabout this in service design as well.\n\n140\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.593\nBut I will mention, when we talk about\nservice metrics and service measurements\n\n141\n00:08:36.593 --> 00:08:40.881\nand we talk about the SLAM charts that\nexist in Service Level Management,\n\n142\n00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:45.257\nthese are our inputs into our service\nreview meetings with our customers.\n\n143\n00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:48.681\nAnd of course, we covered this in\nour foundation material as well, but\n\n144\n00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:51.460\nwe'll go into more depth\nin service design.\n\n145\n00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.130\nWell, when I talk about these SLAM charts,\n\n146\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.850\nI always ask one question,\nwhat color I wanna see in a slam chart.\n\n147\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.390\nCuz they're displayed in red,\namber, green, they're RAG charts.\n\n148\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.770\nI never, ever want to see green.\n\n149\n00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.717\nBecause you see, green might tell me that\nI am meeting my service level targets.\n\n150\n00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:14.235\nBut I'll guarantee, as an external person,\nthat if your SLAM charts are all green,\n\n151\n00:09:14.235 --> 00:09:18.313\nI'll go to any one of your customers and\nask them if they're truly happy, and\n\n152\n00:09:18.313 --> 00:09:21.560\nthey won't be completely\n100% happy with the service.\n\n153\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.057\nSo, seeing a green SLAM chart to me\njust tells me that we're not measuring\n\n154\n00:09:27.057 --> 00:09:28.136\nthe right targets.\n\n155\n00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:34.207\nAnd the service review meter, where the\nService Level Manager and the customer sit\n\n156\n00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:39.625\ndown and they talk about the achievement\nof those service level targets.\n\n157\n00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:41.208\nWell, that shouldn't be a fight.\n\n158\n00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:44.818\nAnd yet, time after time I'm told that\nit is, and I've witnessed this so\n\n159\n00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:46.462\nmany times where this is a fight.\n\n160\n00:09:46.462 --> 00:09:50.227\nWhere the Service Level Manager\nsits there and says, hey look,\n\n161\n00:09:50.227 --> 00:09:52.530\nwe've achieved all our targets.\n\n162\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.030\nAnd the customer turned around and\n\n163\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:59.520\nsaid, so what about that hours ourage\nthat we had just a week ago, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.820\nThis is why we have the Business\nRelationship Manager, to build trust and\n\n165\n00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.730\nto build confidence with the user.\n\n166\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.922\nSo that the customer feels as though\nthey have somebody on their side\n\n167\n00:10:11.922 --> 00:10:18.500\nwho is working with them and is working on\ntheir behalf, but who also understands IT.\n\n168\n00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.829\nAnd that's why we talk about mediating\nconflicts, and conflict resolution,\n\n169\n00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:28.310\nand dealing with complaints,\nand escalation point as well.\n\n170\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.370\nIf a customer's got or a user has got\nan outstanding incident and they don't\n\n171\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.960\nknow who to escalate to, that's why we\nhave the Business Relationship Manager.\n\n172\n00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.600\nIt's about relationship,\nand the BRM works for\n\n173\n00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.700\nboth internal and\nalso external service providers, too.\n\n174\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.704\nWe're concerned with meeting\ncustomer requirements.\n\n175\n00:10:48.704 --> 00:10:51.876\nBut then take a look at the table at\nthe bottom, and I just want to bring\n\n176\n00:10:51.876 --> 00:10:54.893\nin the difference between\nBusiness Relationship Management and\n\n177\n00:10:54.893 --> 00:10:56.229\nService Level Management.\n\n178\n00:10:56.229 --> 00:10:59.360\nCuz I've just mentioned\nthe service review meetings.\n\n179\n00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.691\nBusiness Relationship Management\nis about a relationship, and\n\n180\n00:11:02.691 --> 00:11:05.788\nit's about satisfaction, and\nit's at a strategic level.\n\n181\n00:11:05.788 --> 00:11:10.123\nWe're identifying new services,\nwe're identifying opportunities for\n\n182\n00:11:10.123 --> 00:11:14.330\nimprovement, and we're also performing\nthat mediation of conflict.\n\n183\n00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.540\nWith service level management,\nthat's at an operational level.\n\n184\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:25.130\nWe're managing our services and\ndelivering them to agreed targets.\n\n185\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.570\nSo Service Level Management are going\nto be looking at the instances where\n\n186\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.020\ntargets have been breached.\n\n187\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.520\nWe're going to negotiate these targets,\nand\n\n188\n00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.580\nwe're looking at the operational\nperspective of a service.\n\n189\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.960\nBusiness Relationship Management is not\njust looking at an individual service, but\n\n190\n00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.660\nit's looking at the relationship as\na whole between the business unit and\n\n191\n00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.170\nthe IT service provider.\n\n192\n00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.390\nNow, it talks about ensuring that\nthe customer gets what they need.\n\n193\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.732\nIt's about building up a level of trust,\nbecause sometimes we can't deliver\n\n194\n00:11:57.732 --> 00:12:02.073\neverything that the customer wants, but\nwe want to ensure that the customer is\n\n195\n00:12:02.073 --> 00:12:04.600\nsatisfied and\nthat we are delivering value.\n\n196\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.056\nVery, very early on,\nin our episodes where we looked\n\n197\n00:12:09.056 --> 00:12:13.230\nat service strategy, I talked about value.\n\n198\n00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.316\nAnd I talked about value as\nbeing a mixture of outcomes and\n\n199\n00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:19.622\npreferences and perceptions.\n\n200\n00:12:19.622 --> 00:12:24.134\nAnd in fact, I'm sure you've watched\nthe episode where we looked at value\n\n201\n00:12:24.134 --> 00:12:28.160\nproposition, and where I actually\nmade a proposition to Ronnie.\n\n202\n00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.354\nI offered him some money, [LAUGH] and\nI asked him if he would change his\n\n203\n00:12:33.354 --> 00:12:38.740\npreferences on the basis of me\ngiving him a particular subsidy.\n\n204\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.050\nAnd he did.\n\n205\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:45.490\nAnd in that particular role in\nthat particular moment in time,\n\n206\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.810\nI was undertaking the role of\nthe Business Relationship Manager.\n\n207\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:54.330\nI was understanding Ronnie's\nrequirements and his preferences, but\n\n208\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.845\nI was offering a solution\nthat still kept him happy but\n\n209\n00:12:57.845 --> 00:13:01.930\nthat allowed us as a service provider\nto be able to meet his needs.\n\n210\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.470\nYou see, Business Relationship Manager,\nI like to think of it as a translator but\n\n211\n00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.160\na lot more than that.\n\n212\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.726\nIt's not just about articulating\nthe needs of the customer.\n\n213\n00:13:11.726 --> 00:13:17.160\nIt's understanding the customer so\nwell that you are able to,\n\n214\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.465\nnot just influence their behavior,\nbut you are,\n\n215\n00:13:21.465 --> 00:13:26.180\nin terms of demand management,\nbut you are also able to\n\n216\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.800\nunderstand their requirements and\nsuggest alternatives.\n\n217\n00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.362\nIf we cannot give them\neverything that they want,\n\n218\n00:13:34.362 --> 00:13:36.501\nperhaps we can give them an alternative.\n\n219\n00:13:36.501 --> 00:13:39.945\nIf we have that trust built\nup with that customer,\n\n220\n00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:44.090\nthen they are willing to\naccept that alternative.\n\n221\n00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:48.090\nThen they're willing to look at\nalternatives because they know that we\n\n222\n00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.750\nare acting on their best interests.\n\n223\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.170\nWe're not just acting\non our best interests.\n\n224\n00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.010\nAnd this is why Business Relationship\nManagement is a key role,\n\n225\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.580\nbecause we're building up\na relationship with the business.\n\n226\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.990\nWe want to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\n227\n00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.660\nBusiness Relationship Management is\nnot just a one-off exercise that\n\n228\n00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.330\nhappens in strategy.\n\n229\n00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.840\nAs we've already said,\nyes we're looking for\n\n230\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.450\nnew opportunities in service strategy\nto add value to the organization.\n\n231\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.900\nBut we're also acting as a liaison\npoint with service design and\n\n232\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:30.590\nhelping with scoping out new services and\nthe actual specifications of new services.\n\n233\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.798\nDuring transition,\nwe're involving our customers in testing,\n\n234\n00:14:35.798 --> 00:14:41.285\nand during service operation,\nwe are acting as an escalation point.\n\n235\n00:14:41.285 --> 00:14:45.448\nAnd also in, sorry,\ncontinual [LAUGH] service improvement,\n\n236\n00:14:45.448 --> 00:14:50.331\nwe wanna make sure that the customer\nperspective is always considered in\n\n237\n00:14:50.331 --> 00:14:54.670\nopportunities for improvement and\nimprovement initiatives.\n\n238\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:02.972\nSo let's take a look here on, well, what\nkeeps our customers and our users happy.\n\n239\n00:15:02.972 --> 00:15:08.040\nWell, remember that customers, well,\nthese are the people that are,\n\n240\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.129\nwell, they hold the purse strings, okay?\n\n241\n00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:14.014\nThese are the people that had\nthe accountability for the money.\n\n242\n00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:18.820\nWhereas users are concerned with,\nwell, the warranty aspects.\n\n243\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:24.802\nThey're concern of the usability\nof any process on any service.\n\n244\n00:15:24.802 --> 00:15:29.720\nSo Business Relationship Management is\ngoing to understand the alternate views,\n\n245\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.860\nas we have here just an example,\nof customers and users.\n\n246\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.436\nAnd Business Relationship Management\nhelps to mediate between the two.\n\n247\n00:15:38.436 --> 00:15:42.216\nNow, you could turn around and say that,\n\n248\n00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:47.940\nsurely that's something to do\nwith our organization itself.\n\n249\n00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.075\nSurely that's something to do\nwith the business, is it not?\n\n250\n00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.957\nI mean, a customer were there\nin the business, and a user,\n\n251\n00:15:52.957 --> 00:15:54.119\nthere in the business.\n\n252\n00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:57.144\nSo why are BRM getting involved in this?\n\n253\n00:15:57.144 --> 00:16:01.200\nBecause I am talking about delivering\nvalue through service provision.\n\n254\n00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.770\nI am talking about delivering\nvalue through our services.\n\n255\n00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:11.130\nAnd what that actually means is,\nwe have to deliver value to everybody.\n\n256\n00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:16.950\nEarlier on in our episodes,\nwhen we first looked at value perception\n\n257\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:23.070\nthrough service strategy, I asked\nRonnie what he perceived as valuable.\n\n258\n00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:27.040\nBut I also, gave Ronnie\nthe example of the coffee shop.\n\n259\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.860\nDo you remember, Ronnie?\n\n260\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.180\nYou took your family into a coffee shop,\ndidn't you?\n\n261\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.260\nYou did.\n\n262\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.520\nAnd I asked you whether the coffee\nshop is interested in what\n\n263\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.430\nyou considered of the service, whether\nyou were impressed by the service, or\n\n264\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.460\nwhether your family were impressed\nby the way their coffee tasted.\n\n265\n00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.540\nAnd of course we worked out that\nactually they're interested in both.\n\n266\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n267\n00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.470\n&gt;&gt; Because, quite simply,\n&gt;&gt; If\n\n268\n00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.660\nyour family aren't interested in\nthe coffee, they don't like the coffee,\n\n269\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.800\nthen you're not gonna go back there for\nanother one.\n\n270\n00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.010\nAnd it's exactly the same in IT.\n\n271\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:04.390\nAnd you could say that, well,\nwe should be interested in\n\n272\n00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:08.490\njust the customers because the customers\nare paying for the services.\n\n273\n00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.820\nBut we're not.\n\n274\n00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.160\nWe're interested in the users as well,\n\n275\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.010\nbecause the users will\ninfluence our customers.\n\n276\n00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.840\nSo look down our left-hand column and\n\n277\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.940\nyou'll see what our\ncustomers are interested in.\n\n278\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.440\nWell, it's to do with pricing,\nit's to do with profitability,\n\n279\n00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.280\nit's to do with impact to the services.\n\n280\n00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.721\nWhereas our users are interested in ease\nof use, they're interested in quality and\n\n281\n00:17:31.721 --> 00:17:32.995\nperformance.\n\n282\n00:17:32.995 --> 00:17:35.440\nAnd of course there's\na conflict between them and\n\n283\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.520\nit's really up to us to\nmediate between the two.\n\n284\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.600\nIt's not up to them to try and mediate\nbetween the two because let's face it,\n\n285\n00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:50.240\nthey don't understand the services, and\nthey're certainly not technical people.\n\n286\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.040\nSo it really is up to us as business\nrelationship managers to mediate\n\n287\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.960\nbetween customers and users and their\ndifferent requirements, if they have any.\n\n288\n00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.840\nSo as we see here,\nbusiness relationship management,\n\n289\n00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.980\nwill help to articulate the value\nof a service throughout it's life.\n\n290\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.540\nThrough service design,\nthrough service transition and\n\n291\n00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.190\nthrough service operation as well.\n\n292\n00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.340\nOkay.\n\n293\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.390\nNow I really like the next bullet point.\n\n294\n00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.300\nIf we look at the second\nhalf of the slide here okay.\n\n295\n00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.310\nYou know what?\n\n296\n00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:31.430\nCustomers will quite often come to us and\nthey will tell us exactly what they want.\n\n297\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.010\nIn other words, you'll always get\na customer that comes to us and\n\n298\n00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.340\nsays, I want a tablet.\n\n299\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:44.010\nWhat they are really saying to us is what\nI need is something that's portable and\n\n300\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.450\nsomething that's light weight.\n\n301\n00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.510\nBut what they do is they come to us with\nthat solution or with a specification and\n\n302\n00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.120\nsay I want this.\n\n303\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.182\nWhat they really need to be doing is\ncoming to us with their needs, but\n\n304\n00:18:58.182 --> 00:19:02.808\nnot an ambiguous description but a very\nprecise description of their needs and\n\n305\n00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:05.912\nthe benefits that they want\nto see from these needs.\n\n306\n00:19:05.912 --> 00:19:09.451\nSo you see,\nthose bottom four numbers there,\n\n307\n00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:12.640\nwe need to find the balance between them.\n\n308\n00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.770\nAnd the problem is,\nthe customer doesn't generally know.\n\n309\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.502\nAnd that's the challenge that we have and\n\n310\n00:19:19.502 --> 00:19:21.840\nthis is why we have business\nrelationship management.\n\n311\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.495\nBecause right back at\nthe start of this session,\n\n312\n00:19:25.495 --> 00:19:28.266\nI identified that Ronnie had a need.\n\n313\n00:19:28.266 --> 00:19:33.070\nNow in that particular instance,\nRonnie came to me with the need and\n\n314\n00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.780\nhe didn't know how to fill that need.\n\n315\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.470\nHe didn't know how to resolve\nthe challenge that he had.\n\n316\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.580\nAnd quite often, as I've already said,\na customer will come to us with\n\n317\n00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.690\na very definite answer because\nthey've seen a commercial on TV.\n\n318\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.160\nOr because they've seen a colleague\nwith something similar and\n\n319\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.420\nthey've decided that they need that\nparticular piece of equipment or\n\n320\n00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.580\nthey need that particular service or\nthat piece of software.\n\n321\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.040\nSo you see, business relationship\nmanagement is really about negotiation.\n\n322\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.260\nIt's about that relationship.\n\n323\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.340\nIt's about me being able to\nsit down with Rodney and say,\n\n324\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.930\nokay, I understand the technicalities,\nyou can articulate what you want and\n\n325\n00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.800\nwe're gonna work this out together.\n\n326\n00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.530\nThat's what business relationship\nmanagement is about.\n\n327\n00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.520\nIt's a strategic partnership.\n\n328\n00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.170\nYou know what?\n\n329\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.740\nWe wanna be a service provider that\nis critical to the organization.\n\n330\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.280\nWe want to be a service provider that\nis recognized as being a major part of\n\n331\n00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.610\nthe organization, that's recognized as\nbeing somebody we can't live without.\n\n332\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.940\nThat's what we want to be.\n\n333\n00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.370\nBearing in mind, that as it says\nin the bottom bullet point,\n\n334\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:51.490\nlegal confidentiality issues\nneed to be considered.\n\n335\n00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.290\nEspecially if we're dealing with\nexternal service providers.\n\n336\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.817\nWe need to consider that there are going\nto be points in time when as a business\n\n337\n00:20:59.817 --> 00:21:01.305\nrelationship manager,\n\n338\n00:21:01.305 --> 00:21:05.437\nthey maybe called an account manager\nif it's an external provider.\n\n339\n00:21:05.437 --> 00:21:09.731\nThen we may have access to information\nthat actually could be of some use to\n\n340\n00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:12.220\nthe organization's competitors.\n\n341\n00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.012\nIn which case, then we have to ensure that\nthe appropriate non-disclosure agreements\n\n342\n00:21:17.012 --> 00:21:21.364\nare in place but it's very, very difficult\nto build up trust in that instance.\n\n343\n00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:25.510\nSo we gotta make sure that we do\nactually have that level of trust.\n\n344\n00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:32.282\nSo on our next slide, we actually take\na look at the interactions between\n\n345\n00:21:32.282 --> 00:21:34.866\nbusiness relationship management and\n\n346\n00:21:34.866 --> 00:21:39.421\nall of the other life cycle phases and\nthe other processes, as well.\n\n347\n00:21:39.421 --> 00:21:43.967\nNow what I would like you to do at this\npoint in time before we move further into\n\n348\n00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:47.395\nour next episode on business\nrelationship management.\n\n349\n00:21:47.395 --> 00:21:52.730\nI would like you to go to your notes,\nthe materials that you have downloaded.\n\n350\n00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:57.119\nAnd you will see that you have an exercise\nthat is geared towards helping\n\n351\n00:21:57.119 --> 00:21:59.472\nyou understand these interactions.\n\n352\n00:21:59.472 --> 00:22:03.010\nSo I would like you to\nundertake this exercise.\n\n353\n00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.814\nI would also like you to review the notes\nfrom the previous slide, where we looked\n\n354\n00:22:07.814 --> 00:22:12.210\nat the conflicts between customer\nrequirements and user requirements.\n\n355\n00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.341\nAt this point in time,\nwhen you've completed the exercise or\n\n356\n00:22:16.341 --> 00:22:20.001\nwhilst you're undertaking the exercise,\nthen we're available on our forum.\n\n357\n00:22:20.001 --> 00:22:24.740\nSo if you do have any questions, then\nplease come back to me and let me know and\n\n358\n00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.350\nI will be happy to help\nout in any way I can.\n\n359\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.690\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us, once again,\n\n360\n00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.900\nunderstand this idea here of\nthe business relationship management.\n\n361\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.730\nWhen we start to take a look at the idea\nof the customer's expectation and\n\n362\n00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.730\nget to know what the customer's needs\nare so well that we can identify those.\n\n363\n00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:50.300\nWell, that actually gives us that\nadvantage that we have as well, okay,\n\n364\n00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.900\nto be able to deliver what we actually\nwant to to the customer's satisfaction,\n\n365\n00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.900\nas well as provide everything\nthat we need to the users too.\n\n366\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.650\nTake advantage of what Jo told you as\nwell, to take a little bit of time,\n\n367\n00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.975\nget all these concepts amended\nin by doing that activity.\n\n368\n00:23:05.975 --> 00:23:08.234\nThat's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n369\n00:23:08.234 --> 00:23:12.120\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n370\n00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.081\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Joy

00:00:06.540\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.303\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:11.818\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:15.301\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:19.280\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.630\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.740\nAnd we're diving into a part two on\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n10\n00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.380\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be\nthe ITIL queen herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.710\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.310\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, as we start to take\na look, we already talked about business\n\n14\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.164\nrelationship management\nbriefly in part one, and\n\n15\n00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:38.935\nactually gone over a lot of material.\n\n16\n00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:40.167\nI shouldn't say briefly.\n\n17\n00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:42.780\nWhere are we picking up today?\n\n18\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, now we're going to look at\nthe triggers really and the inputs and\n\n19\n00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.060\noutputs to business\nrelationship management.\n\n20\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.370\nIn our last episode we looked at the value\nthat business relationship management has.\n\n21\n00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.970\nAnd we actually left you with\nan exercise to look at the inputs and\n\n22\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.130\noutputs from all of\nthe service lifecycle phases.\n\n23\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.272\nSo now what we're gonna do is we're just\ngoing to look at that exercise that you've\n\n24\n00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:13.539\ndone, and we're really just going\nto recap over that exercise.\n\n25\n00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.820\nSo I'm gonna start off by looking\nat this particular diagram.\n\n26\n00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.680\nNow I know that the diagram is not very\nbig on the screen in front of you, but\n\n27\n00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.190\nit is large in your materials.\n\n28\n00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.130\nAnd you'll see down, right in the middle\nthere, in the dark green it says,\n\n29\n00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.370\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n30\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.858\nAnd we look at business relationship\nmanagement's involvement in\n\n31\n00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:39.186\nservice strategy, in service design,\nin service transition,\n\n32\n00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:44.244\nin service operation, and also in\ncontinual service improvement as well.\n\n33\n00:01:44.244 --> 00:01:48.024\nAnd I want to draw your attention\nto certain things and as I've said,\n\n34\n00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:52.198\nyou will have a copy of this in your\nnotes that you've already gone through,\n\n35\n00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:55.290\nthings like complaint handling, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.240\nBecause we know that there\nare going to be complaints.\n\n37\n00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.946\nIt's no good trying to bury your head\nin the sands and pretend the conflict's\n\n38\n00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:06.119\nnot going to happen and then there aren't\ngoing to be complaints, because there are.\n\n39\n00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.695\nOkay, the customers will have complaints\nsince a business relationship management\n\n40\n00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:13.998\nwill deal with complaints and\nwe'll deal with escalation and\n\n41\n00:02:13.998 --> 00:02:15.905\nwe'll mediate conflict as well.\n\n42\n00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.345\nNow the example that I gave you\n\n43\n00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:23.005\nin our previous episode was the example\nof the service level agreement and\n\n44\n00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:27.345\nthe service level management\nprocess of service reviews.\n\n45\n00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:31.665\nAnd of course, service reviews\nare the meetings that are held between IT,\n\n46\n00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:34.820\nthe service level manager and\nthe customer.\n\n47\n00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.270\nAnd those meetings, well,\n\n48\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.750\nthat's where we discussed performance\nagainst our service level targets.\n\n49\n00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.220\nAnd when we look at our SLAM charts.\n\n50\n00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.130\nNow I can guarantee to you\nthat we have a SLAM chart,\n\n51\n00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.600\na RAG chart that looks all green.\n\n52\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.250\nAnd our customer is going to turn around\nand say well, yes, we might have met all\n\n53\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.200\nthe targets but what about that outage\nthat we had last week for 30 minutes?\n\n54\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.520\nSo we know that we've got complaints and\n\n55\n00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.820\nwe know that we're going to have some\ntypes of conflict within our service\n\n56\n00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.760\nreview meetings and maybe at other times\nas well throughout our service delivery.\n\n57\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.320\nSo business relationship management has\na role for mediating conflict as well.\n\n58\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.250\nSo what starts off business\nrelationship management?\n\n59\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.200\nThis is quite amusing actually\ncuz I don't like to think\n\n60\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.170\nthat business relationship management\nis actually started by anything.\n\n61\n00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.005\nEven though it's a process and\na process has to have a trigger, and\n\n62\n00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:32.896\na process has to have input and\nhas to have output.\n\n63\n00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:37.628\nI like to think of business relationship\nmanagement as being always there and\n\n64\n00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:39.170\nbeing always prepared.\n\n65\n00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.920\nA bit like a Boy Scout,\nto be honest, always prepared.\n\n66\n00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.390\nBecause, as a business\nrelationship manager,\n\n67\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.880\nI should be set in with the organization\nand set in with the business.\n\n68\n00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.950\nAnd I should be identifying well,\nwhat we call opportunities for\n\n69\n00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.180\nimprovement, but\nthey're just new opportunities.\n\n70\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.360\nIn the last episode,\nRonnie didn't find it very easy\n\n71\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.420\nto juggle his phone on his\nshoulder whilst he was typing,\n\n72\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.020\nand whilst he was trying to take\npayment details from a customer.\n\n73\n00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.910\nWell, I shouldn't be waiting for\nRonnie to come to me and\n\n74\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.800\nsay, hey Jo, I've got this challenge.\n\n75\n00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.866\nCan you help?\n\n76\n00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:21.570\nAs a business relationship manager,\nI should be always there.\n\n77\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.530\nI should be always prepared.\n\n78\n00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.690\nI should have noticed this.\n\n79\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.306\nI should have gone back to IT.\n\n80\n00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:29.870\nAnd I should have said to IT, hey, look.\n\n81\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.270\nI've noticed that some of our\ncustomers are having this challenge.\n\n82\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.070\nWhat can we do to alleviate this further?\n\n83\n00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.050\nAnd then I go back to Ronnie and\nI say hey, Ronnie, we've got this idea.\n\n84\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.910\nWould this help you?\n\n85\n00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.580\nSo whilst, yes, we start off business\nrelationship management with a new\n\n86\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.590\nopportunity or with a new service or by\nidentifying a new upgrade, for instance.\n\n87\n00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.200\nBut business relationship management\nshould be there all the time.\n\n88\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.588\nSo business relationship management gets\ninvolved whenever there are customer\n\n89\n00:05:03.588 --> 00:05:07.782\ncomplaints, whenever there are requests,\nwhenever we have any particular\n\n90\n00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:12.232\ncustomer meetings, or whenever we\nhave any service review meetings.\n\n91\n00:05:12.232 --> 00:05:15.790\nAnd business relationship management\nshould take an active view\n\n92\n00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.510\non satisfaction surveys as well.\n\n93\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.220\nNow, of course, satisfaction surveys,\nthey're owned by service level management.\n\n94\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.690\nIt's part of the service level targets\nwithin our SLAs, I should hope.\n\n95\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.087\nBut they're also conducted by the service\ndesk, because we conduct satisfaction\n\n96\n00:05:32.087 --> 00:05:36.940\nsurveys after we've raised an incident or\nafter we've closed an incident perhaps.\n\n97\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.020\nOr maybe there are one-off satisfaction\nsurveys that we give out to everybody,\n\n98\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.580\nperhaps once a year or\nperhaps once every six months.\n\n99\n00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.780\nBut I like to think of business\nrelationship management as being\n\n100\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.890\nalways there, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.670\nBusiness relationship management\nis not just a one-off exercise,\n\n102\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.530\nit's something that should be\nthere 24 hours a day almost.\n\n103\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.380\nSo we should have a business relationship\nmanager in place in every business unit.\n\n104\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.340\nSo what does business relationship\nmanagement take into consideration then?\n\n105\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.702\nWell, look at this customer requirements,\nbut also customer complaints and\n\n106\n00:06:12.702 --> 00:06:14.730\nescalations as well.\n\n107\n00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.020\nAnd what about our strategy?\n\n108\n00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.160\nWhat about our direction?\n\n109\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.350\nAs well as our service portfolio,\nwhat do we currently provide\n\n110\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.202\nto the organization and what new\nservices do we have in our pipeline?\n\n111\n00:06:28.202 --> 00:06:31.210\nBecause business relationship\nmanagement will be adding new services\n\n112\n00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.930\ninto our pipeline.\n\n113\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.460\nNow because we take part in\nthe service review meeting,\n\n114\n00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.770\nfrom a strategic perspective,\n\n115\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.820\nthat's that meeting between service\nlevel management and our customers.\n\n116\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.990\nWell, we also have an active\nrole in looking and analyzing\n\n117\n00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.280\nthose service level agreement monitoring\ncharts, those RAG charts, as we see.\n\n118\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.070\nWe also take an active role in negotiating\nservice level targets within those\n\n119\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.370\nservice level agreements.\n\n120\n00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.558\nAnd we will evaluate requests for\nchange on behalf of the business,\n\n121\n00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:09.324\nunderstanding that the organization\ndoesn't have a technical head on their\n\n122\n00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:14.402\nshoulders and we don't expect them to be\nable to evaluate anything technically.\n\n123\n00:07:14.402 --> 00:07:19.660\nNow as well on behalf of demand\nmanagement and capacity management and\n\n124\n00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.910\nsecurity management, we're going to\nidentify what user profiles need to exist.\n\n125\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.600\nIn other words,\nwho should have access to what and\n\n126\n00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.620\nalso what patterns of business activity\nexist out within the organization as well.\n\n127\n00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.020\nThat's just some of\nthe things that we consider\n\n128\n00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.220\nwithin business relationship management.\n\n129\n00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.350\nBut what about what business\nrelationship management produces?\n\n130\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.880\nWhat are the outputs?\n\n131\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.829\nWell, let's go back to the inputs really,\nbecause that first one,\n\n132\n00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:53.723\nthe stakeholder definitions,\nthat's down to our user profiles.\n\n133\n00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:57.550\nThat's down to who our customers are and\nwhat should they have access to.\n\n134\n00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.680\nWe also are able to articulate\ndefined business outcomes and\n\n135\n00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.170\nthat's an input into all\nof our new services.\n\n136\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:11.370\nWe should also obtain full financial\nmanagement, the agreement to fund.\n\n137\n00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.150\nIn other words,\nthe approval for the budget.\n\n138\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.820\nAnd so that will come as an output, too,\nfrom the business case, I should hope.\n\n139\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:24.050\nSo business relationship management\nhas an input into the business case.\n\n140\n00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:29.210\nAnd a customer portfolio, well, that\nis a list of who our customers are and\n\n141\n00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.940\nwhat agreements we have in\nplace with those customers.\n\n142\n00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.070\nAnd I expect that business\nrelationship management\n\n143\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.990\nhas an input into keeping that up to date.\n\n144\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.900\nI also expect business relationship\nmanagement to get involved in training\n\n145\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:49.000\nschedules, because business relationship\nmanagement understands who our customers\n\n146\n00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.120\nare, what their skill levels are, and\ntherefore what training they need.\n\n147\n00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.560\nAnd of course,\n\n148\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.140\nbusiness relationship management takes\nownership of customer satisfaction, and\n\n149\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.420\ntherefore they are responsible for\ncustomer perception reports.\n\n150\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.359\nSo with all of those inputs and\noutputs in mind,\n\n151\n00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:11.165\nit should be fairly easy then to\nconsider the interfaces that we have\n\n152\n00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:15.242\nbecause we talked about financial\nmanagement and demand management and\n\n153\n00:09:15.242 --> 00:09:18.674\nservice level management and\nservice catalog management.\n\n154\n00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:24.265\nAnd of course, capacity and\navailability management rely completely\n\n155\n00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:30.044\non business relationship management\nto identify changes in strategy and\n\n156\n00:09:30.044 --> 00:09:33.787\nto identify any new plans and\nany new services.\n\n157\n00:09:33.787 --> 00:09:39.031\nAnd service portfolio management, well,\nas we've said, service portfolio,\n\n158\n00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:43.450\nthat's our pipeline where we put\nthe new ideas and our new services.\n\n159\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.490\nSo what does business relationship\nmanagement have to achieve?\n\n160\n00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.700\nWhat about our CSFs?\n\n161\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.000\nBusiness relationship management is\nabout maintaining a relationship with\n\n162\n00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.360\nthe business.\n\n163\n00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.270\nSo how on earth do you quantify that?\n\n164\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.370\nSurely that's gonna be very difficult.\n\n165\n00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.754\nIt's like asking, it's like me turning\naround to Ronnie and saying, Ronnie,\n\n166\n00:10:05.754 --> 00:10:07.850\ndo we have a really good relationship?\n\n167\n00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:08.640\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n168\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.560\n&gt;&gt; There we go then.\n\n169\n00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.910\nOkay, there's your answer.\n\n170\n00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.330\nSo how do we quantify that?\n\n171\n00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.018\n&gt;&gt; The amount of money you give me.\n\n172\n00:10:16.018 --> 00:10:17.187\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n&gt;&gt; I'm joking, I'm joking.\n\n173\n00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:18.022\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n174\n00:10:18.022 --> 00:10:19.632\nit's the amount of money I give you.\n\n175\n00:10:19.632 --> 00:10:20.299\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:21.345\n&gt;&gt; My, okay.\n\n177\n00:10:21.345 --> 00:10:26.243\n[LAUGH] It's a joke, we can quantify\nthat in several ways, right?\n\n178\n00:10:26.243 --> 00:10:27.839\nThe time that we spend together,\n\n179\n00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:28.943\nwhich is a lot-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n180\n00:10:28.943 --> 00:10:30.010\n&gt;&gt; Right now.\n\n181\n00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Is how we would do that.\n\n182\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.430\nAnd then, sharing of information,\nsharing of personal information.\n\n183\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's down to trust-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, trust.\n\n184\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.550\n&gt;&gt; And I mentioned as well\nin our previous episode,\n\n185\n00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.742\nthe business relationship\nmanagement is about building trust.\n\n186\n00:10:45.742 --> 00:10:49.530\nIt's about, I trust you and you trust me.\n\n187\n00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.360\nAnd if I am a business relationship\nmanager and you've got an issue and\n\n188\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.960\nthen you trust that you can bring me that\nissue, that dilemma that you have about\n\n189\n00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.950\nbalance in your phone, and\nI'm gonna try and help you solve that.\n\n190\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n191\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.420\n&gt;&gt; Now maybe I might give you something\nthat you're not fairly familiar with,\n\n192\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.490\nand I might say to you, here,\ntry this little device.\n\n193\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.790\nBut again, there's that trust that okay,\nJo's recommended it to me, so\n\n194\n00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.920\ntherefore I'm gonna give it a try.\n\n195\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.190\nSo it's trust, and it's a two-way thing.\n\n196\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.710\nI trust that you are going to tell me\n\n197\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.060\nwhen you have any issues that\nyou think I can help with.\n\n198\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.730\nAnd you trust that I'm going to try and\nhelp you out.\n\n199\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.238\nSo here in business\nrelationship management,\n\n200\n00:11:29.238 --> 00:11:33.121\nwhat I've gotta make sure that I do as\na VRM as we call them is I've gotta make\n\n201\n00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:36.962\nsure that I document all of our\nrequirements, all of your requirements.\n\n202\n00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:39.690\nEverything that I know about\nyou I'm going to document.\n\n203\n00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.960\nAnd I'm going to measure\nthat you're happy.\n\n204\n00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.120\nI want to know that you're happy\nwith our relationship, but\n\n205\n00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.690\nalso with the services\nthat I provide as well.\n\n206\n00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.700\nI need to identify any\nchanges to your environment.\n\n207\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.110\nI need to identify them quick.\n\n208\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.130\nSo I need to, again,\nI'm measured by customer satisfaction, but\n\n209\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.660\nI need to be proactive.\n\n210\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.350\nI need to see that something has changed,\nand I need to be able to identify that.\n\n211\n00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:11.600\nAnd I also need to identify any trends\nthat could affect your service.\n\n212\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.330\nNow there may be good technology trends\nlike the something you come out on\n\n213\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.710\nthe marketplace or it maybe something\nthat's not so good like the fact that\n\n214\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:24.630\nactually Ronnie, Windows 95 is not going\nto be supported any more as of next month.\n\n215\n00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.820\nSo we need to do something about that.\n\n216\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.540\nBut because you trust me, you know that\nI've got it in hand and you know that I'm\n\n217\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.240\ngoing to do something about it that's not\ngoing to be detrimental to your services.\n\n218\n00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.060\nWhat else do I have to be able to do?\n\n219\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.505\nWell, I have to be able to\narticulate the business requirement.\n\n220\n00:12:42.505 --> 00:12:44.680\nI have to translate.\n\n221\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.448\nI have to take your requirements and\nthen document them in a way\n\n222\n00:12:49.448 --> 00:12:53.580\nthat IT can understand,\nthat IT can take it forward.\n\n223\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:58.456\nAnd even not just IT, but even,\nas we mentioned, the business case and\n\n224\n00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:02.460\nthe steering group, and\nmaybe senior executives, too.\n\n225\n00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.680\nI also have to be able to measure\nif I'm meeting your needs.\n\n226\n00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.780\nNow again,\ncustomer satisfaction is part of that.\n\n227\n00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.838\nSo customer satisfaction is key.\n\n228\n00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:17.378\nI mean, it really is about you being happy\nwith me and being happy with my ability,\n\n229\n00:13:17.378 --> 00:13:21.700\neven to manage complaints and\nescalations as well.\n\n230\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.400\nThis is about a relationship.\n\n231\n00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.990\nAnd it's very difficult to\nquantify a relationship.\n\n232\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.080\nAnd I look at all of those KPIs for\n\n233\n00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:36.210\nall of these CSFs on this page and\nthe previous page as well.\n\n234\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.280\nIt's very,\nvery difficult to quantify that.\n\n235\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.560\nAnd you'll see that customer satisfaction,\nwell, it features in everything.\n\n236\n00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.360\nBecause ultimately, I'm delivering\nvalue to you as a customer, and\n\n237\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.320\nso I have to make sure that\nyou're satisfied with me, and\n\n238\n00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.730\nthat you're happy with\nthe service that I'm giving you.\n\n239\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.755\nNow and here's where our\nchallenges come into this.\n\n240\n00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:04.710\nYou see,\nI'm interested in customer satisfaction.\n\n241\n00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.550\nBut I need to be your contact for\nabsolutely everything.\n\n242\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.270\nI need to understand you.\n\n243\n00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:17.970\nAnd that first bullet point there,\nthat has two meanings really.\n\n244\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.100\nAnd one is that I shouldn't be used\njust to measure customer satisfaction.\n\n245\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.980\nI should be recognized within IT\nas being a credible source for\n\n246\n00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.200\nimprovement opportunities,\nas being a credible source for\n\n247\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.280\nnew ideas to meet\nthe needs of the business.\n\n248\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.460\nBut I'm not the only person that should be\ninvolved with customer satisfaction, too,\n\n249\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.950\nbecause everyone within IT,\n\n250\n00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:44.340\nwithin the service provider, should\nhave a focus on customer satisfaction.\n\n251\n00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.740\nNow sometimes what will happen\nis we'll bring a BRM in, or\n\n252\n00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:54.320\nwe'll bring the BRM role in as\na solution because we've had\n\n253\n00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.260\npretty bad credibility\nwithin the organization.\n\n254\n00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.610\nAnd so we bring BRM in to try and\nsmooth over that relationship.\n\n255\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.520\nWell, we're starting off on\nthe back foot as we would say.\n\n256\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.744\nWe're starting off in a negative position,\nso\n\n257\n00:15:09.744 --> 00:15:12.576\nthat's gonna be a challenge for any BRM.\n\n258\n00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:16.189\nAnd just to ensure that there's\na difference and that you understand\n\n259\n00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:20.990\nthe difference between the BRM role, in\nother words, the person and the process.\n\n260\n00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:25.904\nThe process that I undertake does\nnot define me, I'm still me.\n\n261\n00:15:25.904 --> 00:15:30.949\nThe BRM role is about the relationship,\nwhereas the process involves me\n\n262\n00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:36.150\ntaking ideas for new services,\nit involves me managing complaints.\n\n263\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:41.279\nHowever, the role is a role where I am\nvisible to you and I'm available to you.\n\n264\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.410\nBe careful because I am very closely\nrelated to all other processes,\n\n265\n00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.440\nbecause I have to act\nas an escalation point.\n\n266\n00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.590\nSo therefore I have to be involved\nwith all other processes.\n\n267\n00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.970\nAnd so I have to be integrated\nwith other processes, and\n\n268\n00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:02.870\nwith the service managers as well as with\nthe process managers and process owners.\n\n269\n00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:09.930\nBut at the same time, I still have to be\nthe person that the customer can trust.\n\n270\n00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.730\nSo it is a very,\nvery fine balancing act with BRM.\n\n271\n00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.610\nSo now that we've looked at\nbusiness relationship management,\n\n272\n00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:23.190\nall of our last two episodes,\nwhat I'd like you to do now is,\n\n273\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.830\nI'd like you to undertake the exercise\nthat you have in your course materials for\n\n274\n00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.980\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n275\n00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.190\nNow that will take you\naround about an hour to do,\n\n276\n00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:37.470\nand what I'd like you to do is really\nto do that exercise right now.\n\n277\n00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.930\nIf you have any questions at all,\nthen please feel free to reach out\n\n278\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:47.250\nvia the forum and I will be here for you\nto answer any queries that you may have.\n\n279\n00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, thank you for\n\n280\n00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.840\nhelping us out here in the business\nrelationship management.\n\n281\n00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.730\nWe've talked, of course,\n\n282\n00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.070\nabout the idea of the triggers\nas well as inputs and outputs.\n\n283\n00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.328\nWe took a look briefly at\nthe interfaces as well as\n\n284\n00:16:59.328 --> 00:17:04.600\nthe CSF, Critical Success Factors.\n\n285\n00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.220\nI don't know why it's a tongue twister for\nme but it is.\n\n286\n00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.850\nAnd then of course at the challenges and\nrisks.\n\n287\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:14.180\nRemember, take advantage of the activity\nthat Jo has actually just assigned you.\n\n288\n00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.600\nIt is worth it because it all comes down\nto you really getting this cemented into\n\n289\n00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.740\nyour brain as you prepare for\nwhatever is coming next in ITIL.\n\n290\n00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.390\nSo that's a great place for\nus to sign off as well.\n\n291\n00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.080\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n292\n00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n293\n00:17:29.160 -->

show.\n\n10\n00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:32.236\n&gt;&gt; Just call me Dr. Who.\n\n11\n00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:33.495\n&gt;&gt; All right, Dr. Who.\n\n12\n00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:37.518\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, we've always said\nthe next Dr. Who should be a woman.\n\n13\n00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:40.290\n&gt;&gt; There you go, and\nwe have her right here.\n\n14\n00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.530\nSo Jo, here we are.\n\n15\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.290\nWe're taking a look now at\nthe idea of governance.\n\n16\n00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.640\nWhenever I think about governance,\nI'm not normally thinking about rules and\n\n17\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.390\nregulations a lot of times.\n\n18\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.740\nBut is that what we're really talking\nabout here, are rules and regulations?\n\n19\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.700\n&gt;&gt; I hate to use the word rules, because-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.250\n&gt;&gt; We're not particularly prescriptive\n\n21\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.000\nin ITIL.\n\n22\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.600\nNow, that's not to say that you shouldn't\nhave any rules, yes you should,\n\n23\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.770\nbut you should have policies\nwithin which you work.\n\n24\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.800\nSo governance is really\nabout setting policies.\n\n25\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.070\nGovernance is about setting direction for\n\n26\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.840\nthe way that we're going to go with ITIL\nand also with our service management.\n\n27\n00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.708\nNow, as I've said I'm not\nreally into the word rules,\n\n28\n00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:22.905\nI don't like to be too prescriptive.\n\n29\n00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:26.780\nITIL is is not going to be descriptive,\nwe're gonna give you a framework.\n\n30\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.080\nAnd really what we are going to\ntalk about in this section is just\n\n31\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.340\nhow we set policies and\nhow we come up with all of our policies.\n\n32\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.660\nWe base them on our\norganization of course.\n\n33\n00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.180\nOur organization will give us policies for\nthe way that we manage,\n\n34\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.960\nsuppliers, and for the way that we\nmanage our finances for instance.\n\n35\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.070\nAnd also our organization will give us\na vision and a direction and a strategy.\n\n36\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.570\nWhether they want to grow whether they\nwant to maintain the status quo or\n\n37\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.859\nwhether they want to transform.\n\n38\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.110\nSo governance really what we're\ndoing is here we're taking what\n\n39\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.366\nthe organization setting as a direction\nand we are translating that into IT.\n\n40\n00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:14.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jo where are we going\nto begin when you start talking about\n\n41\n00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.205\nthis idea of governance them?\n\n42\n00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:21.140\n&gt;&gt; But, as I have already said,\nwe take what the organization, or\n\n43\n00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.590\nsetting as governance policies themselves,\nand\n\n44\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.260\nwhat they're setting as their\ndirection and their strategy.\n\n45\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.730\nAnd we translate that into something that\nhere, we in IT can actually work with.\n\n46\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.050\nAnd so that will help us set our\ndirections and set our strategies.\n\n47\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.050\nIt tells us on this first slide,\nright at the very bottom there,\n\n48\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.070\nthat many of our service management\ninitiatives fail because\n\n49\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.420\nwe're not aligned with the organization.\n\n50\n00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.750\nBecause we don't understand\nthe governance of the organization.\n\n51\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.550\nAnd so we try to do what we think is best.\n\n52\n00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.550\nAnd best practice will tell us that\nit's not about what we want to do,\n\n53\n00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.480\nit should be about what the organization\nis telling us that we need to do.\n\n54\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.240\nBecause we need to be aligned with their\nstrategies and with their direction.\n\n55\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.390\nSo our strategy sets direction.\n\n56\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.422\nAnd our policies well, it's got that rules\nword in there, Ronnie, that I don't like.\n\n57\n00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:15.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is a direction on boundaries and\n\n58\n00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.190\nhow decisions are made.\n\n59\n00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.990\nAnd the plans are what we actually do.\n\n60\n00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.650\nNow there are three main activities\nwithin governance, as we like to call it.\n\n61\n00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.170\nAnd those activities, we'll start off and\nwe're gonna go through them over the next\n\n62\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.190\nfew slides where we evaluate\nwhere we are right now.\n\n63\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.330\nWe direct, in other words we set\nour strategies and our policies and\n\n64\n00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.708\nsay, okay, we're going in this direction\nand this is how we're doing it.\n\n65\n00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:44.189\nAnd we monitor how we're performing.\n\n66\n00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.440\nWe do this at a high level.\n\n67\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.153\nThis is at a governance level.\n\n68\n00:03:48.153 --> 00:03:49.811\nWe monitor how we're performing,\n\n69\n00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:53.578\nwe evaluate if we're going in the right\ndirection, how we're doing right now.\n\n70\n00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:57.230\nAnd then we direct, and then we monitor.\n\n71\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.900\nAnd this is iterative.\n\n72\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.510\nIt's an iterative process.\n\n73\n00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.550\nAnd it's just really a case of making\n\n74\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.790\nsure that we are aligned to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n75\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.010\nSo business relationship,\n\n76\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.540\nmanagement process, that's gonna help us\nwith this, as well as strategy management.\n\n77\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.200\nThey're going to be performing\na lot of this for us.\n\n78\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.239\nSo let's look a little bit more\nin-depth at what evaluate means.\n\n79\n00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.760\nAnd evaluate just simply means\nlooking at where we are right now.\n\n80\n00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.410\nNow, we talked about assessments\nin previous episodes.\n\n81\n00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.750\nWe looked at assessment of our processes,\nfor instance.\n\n82\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.980\nAnd if we look at continual service\nimprovement as a lifecycle phase,\n\n83\n00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.160\nyou'll see a lot more in\nterms of assessments.\n\n84\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.920\nAnd how we actually undertake assessments\nand looking at tools like CMMI, for\n\n85\n00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.950\ninstance, for assessing against maturity.\n\n86\n00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.950\nAnd an evaluation is just\nunderstanding where we are in terms of\n\n87\n00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.590\nour processes within IT.\n\n88\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.830\nIn terms of our alignment with\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n89\n00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.930\nAnd also in terms of where\nwe are in alignment and\n\n90\n00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.900\nin comparison with maybe industry trends\nfor instance in our industry sector.\n\n91\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.570\nAnd regulations that there may be for\nus in our particular industry sector.\n\n92\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.900\nSo we're going to evaluate\nwhere we are within IT.\n\n93\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.590\nRemember I said right at the very start in\nan earlier episode in service strategy,\n\n94\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.460\nthat we've got to assume\nthat we've got competition.\n\n95\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.650\nWe can't assume that we are the only\nperson that can do our role for\n\n96\n00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.945\nour organization.\n\n97\n00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:35.078\nSo we have to understand the direction\nthat our organization is going in and\n\n98\n00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:36.332\nwhat their vision is.\n\n99\n00:05:36.332 --> 00:05:41.390\nAnd that means that we have to\nenable them to meet their vision.\n\n100\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.100\nNow if we don't there's always somebody\nknocking on the door of the CEO offering\n\n101\n00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.240\nto do our role for\nless money and higher quality.\n\n102\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.130\nSo we need to evaluate where we\nare as a IT service provider, but\n\n103\n00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.560\nalso where our organization is too.\n\n104\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.700\nBecause you see as an IT service\nprovider given that IT is so\n\n105\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.070\nentwined with the organization, well,\nwe could be holding the organization back.\n\n106\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.120\nOr we could be trying to\nforce the organization to run\n\n107\n00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.780\nbefore it could walk for instance.\n\n108\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.070\nSo we'll evaluate on aspects\nsuch as financial performance,\n\n109\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.510\nlooking at these projects that we\nhave in our pipeline right now.\n\n110\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.090\nWhere we are right now, things like CMMI,\nlooking at our processes, etc.\n\n111\n00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.540\nLook at our opportunities, we could do\nSWAT analysis, strengths, weaknesses,\n\n112\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.210\nopportunities and threats.\n\n113\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.730\nAnd again if you want to know more\nabout that type of assessment,\n\n114\n00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.060\nthen please go to the continuous service\nimprovement life cycle phase, and\n\n115\n00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.150\nyou will see a lot more on assessments and\nhow we do this.\n\n116\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.000\nWe'll also evaluate things like proposals\nfrom our managers and our shareholders.\n\n117\n00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.620\nNow that's very much\nan organizational type of evaluation.\n\n118\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.310\nBut we want to know what direction\nthe organization wants to go in because we\n\n119\n00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.280\nhave to support that.\n\n120\n00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.170\nAnd so, of course we take into\nconsideration feedback and\n\n121\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.120\nalso our existing contracts\nwith our suppliers, too.\n\n122\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.810\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo, I have a question here\nabout this idea of evaluation.\n\n123\n00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.570\nIt's easy for a company internally\nto take a look at this and say,\n\n124\n00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.100\nhey, we need to evaluate where we are.\n\n125\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.770\nBut we also understand that it's also\neasy for me if I'm doing that to just\n\n126\n00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.700\ncenter in, pigeon hole in, on some of\nthose areas that I want to emphasize.\n\n127\n00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.740\nAnd not so much from the areas we need to.\n\n128\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.520\nSo is this a better process and\nevaluation if we think about bringing in\n\n129\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.750\na third party or\nan outside to help us to do that better?\n\n130\n00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.823\nOr is this something that we can try and\njust figure out how to balance it better?\n\n131\n00:07:44.823 --> 00:07:48.433\n&gt;&gt; Well this goes back to a topic\nthat actually we continue our service\n\n132\n00:07:48.433 --> 00:07:52.495\nimprovement, is looking the difference\nbetween internal assessment and\n\n133\n00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:54.195\nexternal assessment.\n\n134\n00:07:54.195 --> 00:07:58.568\nNow, an internal assessment when\nit's completed internally- Well,\n\n135\n00:07:58.568 --> 00:08:01.877\nyou know your organization\nbetter than anybody else.\n\n136\n00:08:01.877 --> 00:08:09.290\nSo you're able to give an assessment based\non your understanding of our direction.\n\n137\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.565\nHowever, your assessment could be biased,\n\n138\n00:08:12.565 --> 00:08:16.495\nyour assessment could be made\nwith a certain aim in mind.\n\n139\n00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:19.155\nMaybe you want to show that\nwe're not doing so well, or\n\n140\n00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:21.625\nmaybe you want to show\nthat we are doing so well.\n\n141\n00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:25.445\nSo you're going to be looking for\nopportunities to demonstrate or\n\n142\n00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:28.595\nto prove your direction.\n\n143\n00:08:28.595 --> 00:08:34.320\nSo we can't be assured of an impartiality\nof an internal assessment,\n\n144\n00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.440\nbut we do have the skills of our\nenvironment, we have that experience.\n\n145\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.400\nNow an external assessment, yeah,\nwe can guarantee impartiality.\n\n146\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.650\nAnd the other thing with\nan external assessment is,\n\n147\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.920\nthat an external assessor\nwill have the details and\n\n148\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.830\nthe information to allow us to\ncompare against other organization.\n\n149\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.290\nHowever, an external assessment\nwill not have that knowledge\n\n150\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.170\nof the organization itself.\n\n151\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.900\nSo we have to compare the two and\n\n152\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:10.540\nwork out which one would be most suitable\ngiven the situation that we're in.\n\n153\n00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.580\nNow, I would always advise that we start\noff with an internal assessment and\n\n154\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.200\nthen we go to an external assessment,\nthat would always be my advice.\n\n155\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.660\nHowever, we have to do that only\nunderstanding that internal assessment is\n\n156\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.830\nnever going to be impartial, and\nit doesn't matter what good faith we enter\n\n157\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:32.460\ninto an internal assessment with, there's\nalways an element of, I want to show this.\n\n158\n00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.410\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n159\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.260\n&gt;&gt; And it's just natural,\nand it's not wrong.\n\n160\n00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.770\nAnd I don't like to see organizations\nwhere they beat themselves up about\n\n161\n00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.740\ninternal efforts etc.,\non things like these.\n\n162\n00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.080\nThere's nothing wrong with that, we just\nhave to accept that this is the way that\n\n163\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.600\nit is and It won't necessarily be\nas impartial as we would like.\n\n164\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.020\nSo start off with an internal assessment,\nit'll totally give you a starting point.\n\n165\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.750\nBut an internal assessment, or\nan evaluation, as we call it here,\n\n166\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.740\nis not going to give us the full breadth\nof knowledge of the outside world.\n\n167\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Jo,\nwhere are we heading next?\n\n168\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we'll do now is\nafter we've done the assessment,\n\n169\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.870\nthen we make decisions as to where we're\ngoing, which is what we call direct.\n\n170\n00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.590\nSo we come up with the strategies and\nour governance policies and\n\n171\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.050\nthen we communicate.\n\n172\n00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.170\nAnd that includes as we said here,\n\n173\n00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.450\ndelegation of authority coz you\ncan't do everything yourself,\n\n174\n00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.480\nour steering committees, and our vision\nstatements, and our mission statements.\n\n175\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.200\nNow this has to be done top down and\n\n176\n00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.706\nthis is why governance is set\nhere at service strategy.\n\n177\n00:10:38.706 --> 00:10:46.640\nIt is no good just communicating\nour strategies at a lower level.\n\n178\n00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.080\nThe communication of strategy has\nto have senior management buy-in.\n\n179\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.060\nIt has to have support from our\nmanagement, from our steering groups,\n\n180\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:00.540\netc., and it has to come down\nthrough our management hierarchies,\n\n181\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.039\nbecause you see everybody wants\nto know what's in it for them.\n\n182\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.520\nAnd so, the CIO will be able to\ncommunicate to the steering group\n\n183\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.518\nexactly what it means to them.\n\n184\n00:11:11.518 --> 00:11:12.440\nOn the steering group,\n\n185\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.410\nwill be able to communicate to the process\nmanagers exactly what's in it for them.\n\n186\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.550\nOn the process managers,\n\n187\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:23.766\nwill be able to communicate to their own\nanalyst exactly what's in it for them.\n\n188\n00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:28.870\nAnd we have to have ongoing\nvisible commitment and\n\n189\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.720\nsupport from management as well.\n\n190\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.160\nThis is not just a one off exercise,\nyou've already seen in a previous slide\n\n191\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.510\nthat this is iterative, this is not just\nsomething that happens in a one off basis.\n\n192\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.880\nSo, we have to have, as I said, visible\nongoing commitment from senior management.\n\n193\n00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.720\nAnd then once we have a strategy\nthat's been communicated,\n\n194\n00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.820\nwe have our governance policies,\nthen we monitor.\n\n195\n00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.110\nAnd we monitor to see whether\nwe are complying with or\n\n196\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.175\nwhether we're adhering to and\nwhatever words you want to use.\n\n197\n00:11:59.175 --> 00:12:04.620\nAre we actually going along with the\nstrategy, or are we deviating somewhere\n\n198\n00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:10.100\nalong the way, are we adhering to our\npolicies, or are we ignoring our policies?\n\n199\n00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.880\nIf we're ignoring our policies,\n\n200\n00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.710\nthen please don't think that this\nis a terrible thing and we need to\n\n201\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.109\nimplement some sort of disciplinary\naction in order to adhere to this.\n\n202\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.220\nIf we are not adhering to our policies,\n\n203\n00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.150\nthere's one of two things\nthat's gone wrong.\n\n204\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.140\nThe first is one is that we didn't\nconvince everybody of the need to change,\n\n205\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.280\nand in which case, then it wasn't\ncommunicated effectively, and\n\n206\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.830\nwe didn't get everybody on board.\n\n207\n00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.470\nAnd again, I would refer everybody back\nto continuous service improvement and\n\n208\n00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.520\nlook at Kotter's 8 steps for\n\n209\n00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.850\norganizational change, transformational\nchange, we need to get everybody on board.\n\n210\n00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.860\nBut again, if we didn't, if we're\nnot getting adherence to policies,\n\n211\n00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.900\nwell, it's not to do with\norganizational change,\n\n212\n00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.790\nthen it's got to be something to do with\nthe fact that the policies aren't right.\n\n213\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:04.140\nWe don't wanna use a baseball bat to\ntry and enforce policy adherence.\n\n214\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.510\nWhat we want to do is encourage policy\nadherence, so we're going to get that\n\n215\n00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:15.040\nnaturally, if the policies\nare appropriate and if the policies work.\n\n216\n00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.410\nGovernance is not just\nabout the baseball bat, and\n\n217\n00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:22.140\nthis is why I don't like the word rules,\nbecause this is not the approach we want.\n\n218\n00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.760\nIf the governance is relevant and\nthe governance has been\n\n219\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.860\ncreated in a way where we have\nconsulted all of our stakeholders, and\n\n220\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:36.170\nwhere everybody sees the need,\nthen it's not a rules-based policy at all.\n\n221\n00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.030\nIt's actually a policy that\neverybody adheres to naturally,\n\n222\n00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.310\nbecause it's the common sense thing to do.\n\n223\n00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:49.190\nBut we will assess whether we are adhering\nto the policies, of course we will.\n\n224\n00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.240\nSo we'll do things like monitor our KPIs,\n\n225\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.080\nand we may do risk assessments or\ncompliance ordinance, even,\n\n226\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.910\nto see whether people are complying, and\nwe'll do capability analysis as well.\n\n227\n00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:07.130\nNow capability analysis is just really\nassessing whether we are capable,\n\n228\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:11.120\nwhether we have the right skills,\nto be able to adhere to the policies.\n\n229\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.580\nBecause again, and I'll go back to\nKotter's 8 steps about creating the need\n\n230\n00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:20.670\nfor change, and ensuring that everybody\nhas the right skills to be able to\n\n231\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.320\ndeliver that change, or\nto adhere to that policy.\n\n232\n00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.480\nSo this is why we would do\nthe capability analysis.\n\n233\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.520\nYou see we have to have what we\ncall a governance framework and\n\n234\n00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.420\na governance framework is just really\na structure to the way that we work.\n\n235\n00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.010\nIt's a structure to our policies,\n\n236\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.270\nit's a structure to our strategies,\nit's a structure to the way that we work.\n\n237\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.720\nNow there is an international standard,\n\n238\n00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.730\nISO/IEC 38500-6 which actually\n\n239\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.820\nlooks at the principles of corporate\ngovernance, and we can apply that to us.\n\n240\n00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.960\nNow, I'm not telling everybody\nthat you got to go out and\n\n241\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.000\nyou got to adhere to\nan international standard.\n\n242\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.425\nWhat I am saying is that there\nare frameworks out there\n\n243\n00:15:06.425 --> 00:15:08.427\nthat can help us with this.\n\n244\n00:15:08.427 --> 00:15:12.805\nl hate to say this, and\nis a big like financial management,\n\n245\n00:15:12.805 --> 00:15:17.545\nwhen you strategy is the particular\nlife cycle phase that a lot of IT people\n\n246\n00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:21.385\nlike to run away from,\nbecause it's all about corporate.\n\n247\n00:15:21.385 --> 00:15:24.035\nIt's all about the vision,\nit's all about strategies,\n\n248\n00:15:24.035 --> 00:15:29.030\na very much to have seen their\nmanagement level, at CIO level.\n\n249\n00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.680\nBut we got a lot of tools that can help\nus so we shouldn't run away from it,\n\n250\n00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.950\nwe shouldn't be scared of it, we should\nembrace the tools that we have, and so\n\n251\n00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.620\nthere's an international\nstandard out there.\n\n252\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.610\nI'm not telling you, you have to go and\ncomplete an international standard audit.\n\n253\n00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.410\nBut what you can do is look\nat the elements within\n\n254\n00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:50.100\nthat international standard and say,\nokay, we can apply some of these.\n\n255\n00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.958\nI mean, look how sensible they are.\n\n256\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:56.776\nEstablishing responsibilities, meet\nthe organization's objectives, acquire,\n\n257\n00:15:56.776 --> 00:16:01.060\nin other words, when you purchase\nanything, do it for a reason.\n\n258\n00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.817\nDon't do just because you feel like it.\n\n259\n00:16:02.817 --> 00:16:07.129\nIn short, performance and\nconformance with the rules and\n\n260\n00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:10.910\nrespect human factors, respect resistance.\n\n261\n00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.505\nThe resistance is going to be there so\nyou have to acknowledge it,\n\n262\n00:16:14.505 --> 00:16:18.985\nyou have to respect it and\nthen look for ways to manage it.\n\n263\n00:16:18.985 --> 00:16:22.615\nRather than just pretend it's going to\ngo away if you get the baseball bat out,\n\n264\n00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:25.005\nbecause that's not going to work.\n\n265\n00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:30.235\nSo don't run away from governance,\nembrace it and\n\n266\n00:16:30.235 --> 00:16:36.015\nuse the tools that are available to us, to\nbe able to formulate a governance policy.\n\n267\n00:16:37.048 --> 00:16:38.990\nWe start off with governors,\n\n268\n00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.240\nright at the very very top\nlevel within our organization.\n\n269\n00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.260\nAnd the governors are people that are\nresponsible for the corporate governance.\n\n270\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.720\nThis aren't our executive board.\n\n271\n00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.250\nThese are people like the company's\nsecretary, or the chairperson,\n\n272\n00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.170\nor corporate offices.\n\n273\n00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.560\nAnd then underneath that we'll\nhave the executive board,\n\n274\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.430\nwhich are our CEO and\nour CFO and our CIO as well.\n\n275\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:07.090\nAnd then underneath that, we have within\nIT we have our IT steering group.\n\n276\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.240\nAnd our IT steering group\ntakes the strategy and\n\n277\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.290\nthe governance that's been set by\nthe executive and the governors.\n\n278\n00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:21.935\nAnd we will apply that to our IT\norganizations, to our IT service provider.\n\n279\n00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:25.450\nStrategy for the organization,\nis strategy for the organization.\n\n280\n00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.120\nBut guess what, that includes us,\nwe are part of the organization.\n\n281\n00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.010\nAnd whether we are an internal or\nan external service provider.\n\n282\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:41.340\nWe have to meet the needs of the\norganization and we have to work in a way\n\n283\n00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:47.340\nthat is ethically adhered to the strategy\nand the direction of the organization.\n\n284\n00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.920\nEven as an external service provider, so\n\n285\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.680\nwe have a responsibility to ensure\nthat we work in the same way.\n\n286\n00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.740\nThat our service portfolio has the right\n\n287\n00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.350\nmix of services to enable the organization\nto achieve their strategy.\n\n288\n00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.880\nThat we're managing our finances\nin exactly the same way as\n\n289\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.620\nthe organization does.\n\n290\n00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.060\nSure, there are gonna be anomalies.\n\n291\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.230\nAnd we looked at that in a previous\nsection when we looked at financial\n\n292\n00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:16.390\nmanagement because financial management\nwas all about cost models and\n\n293\n00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.120\ncost types, etc.\n\n294\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.750\nAnd we've got different cost types\nto the organization because we've\n\n295\n00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.430\ngot computer equipment.\n\n296\n00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:28.810\nBut we still have the same policies and\nwe still have the same guidelines.\n\n297\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:33.290\nAnd you know demand management looks\nat the demand that's coming from\n\n298\n00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:38.995\nthe organization, but ultimately,\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n299\n00:18:38.995 --> 00:18:43.505\nThe key to helping us define our\nstrategy because it's business\n\n300\n00:18:43.505 --> 00:18:44.975\nrelationship management.\n\n301\n00:18:44.975 --> 00:18:50.230\nAs we looked at in a couple of episodes\npreviously within service strategy\n\n302\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.680\nwell they are the people that\nsit within the organization and\n\n303\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.870\nthese are the people that actually\ntranslate the business requirements and\n\n304\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:04.090\nthe business strategy and the business\nvision into something that we can\n\n305\n00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:10.300\nactually work with and that enables\nus to facilitate their requirements.\n\n306\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.030\nSo governance is not something\nthat we should ran away from.\n\n307\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:18.182\nGovernance is something that we\nshould embrace because it enables\n\n308\n00:19:18.182 --> 00:19:23.611\nus to set a direction and it enables\nus to work with the organization and\n\n309\n00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:27.121\nbe completely aligned to the organization.\n\n310\n00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:30.596\nAnd without governance, well we just\ncarry on doing what we want to do.\n\n311\n00:19:30.596 --> 00:19:34.596\nAnd you know what happens to the IT\norganization that just carries on doing\n\n312\n00:19:34.596 --> 00:19:36.200\nwhat they want to do.\n\n313\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.230\nWell eventually,\n\n314\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.010\nthe business will find somebody who's\ngoing to help them achieve their goals.\n\n315\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.000\nCuz it's not about our goals.\n\n316\n00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.540\nOur goal should always be to\ndeliver value to the business.\n\n317\n00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.510\n&gt;&gt; Alright Jo.\n\n318\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:53.710\nOnce again, thank you for helping us to\nunderstand this idea of governance better.\n\n319\n00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.630\nIn this episode, remember we talked\nabout a few different things here that\n\n320\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.810\ngovernance is not necessarily about rules.\n\n321\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:02.910\nOr is not the prescription of what we have\nto do, but really setting that framework\n\n322\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.050\nfor the things that we talk about in terms\nof how to set those policies as well.\n\n323\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:12.670\nAlso Jo described the activities here to\nevaluate, to direct and monitor of course,\n\n324\n00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.540\nto make sure everything is actually\nworking the way that we want them to.\n\n325\n00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:21.610\nAnd then of course she also helped us\nby looking into the other services and\n\n326\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.090\nlife cycles.\n\n327\n00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.350\nActually I think that's\njust processes aren't they?\n\n328\n00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.980\nThe management side of things,\n\n329\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.190\nto make sure that we understood where\nit also took a role in that as well.\n\n330\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.610\nThat's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n331\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.550\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n332\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n333\n00:20:40.540 -->

00:00:04.967\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:08.113\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:10.929\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.929\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.470\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.060\nI'm your hot Ronnie Wong and\n\n9\n00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.250\ntoday we are going to be taking a look\nat organizing for service strategy.\n\n10\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.705\nAnd here to help us out is going to be our\nintergalactic empress herself in ITIL,\n\n11\n00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:30.835\nJo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:31.884\nJo, welcome to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:33.244\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I wish that I had the costume\nto go with that actually.\n\n14\n00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:35.217\n&gt;&gt; It'd be neat.\n\n15\n00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:35.930\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it would.\n\n16\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.900\n&gt;&gt; That would be neat here.\n\n17\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.580\nAll right, so Jo, as we take a look\nat this idea of organizing for\n\n18\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.120\nservice strategy, organizing and\nstrategy, they sound the same, Jo.\n\n19\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.795\nHelp us out here.\n\n20\n00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:52.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well a strategy\nis about a direction.\n\n21\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.560\nAnd our organization is really, you know,\nwhat we look like, how we are organized.\n\n22\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.390\nSo, the strategy is\nsomething that we do and\n\n23\n00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.130\nthe organization is really what\nfacilitates us and what gets us there.\n\n24\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n25\n00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.362\n&gt;&gt; So what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to end this section here.\n\n26\n00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:14.990\nWe're gonna look at the organizational\ndevelopment of an IT service provider.\n\n27\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.462\nAnd then a little bit later on\nonce we've looked at them and\n\n28\n00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:21.290\nwe've looked at the evolution\nof an IT service provider.\n\n29\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.204\nThen we'll take a look at the roles\nthat we have discussed so far in\n\n30\n00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:31.420\nservice strategy, and\nalso how they play a part in the rest\n\n31\n00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.710\nof the service lifecycle, in other words\nthe rest of IT as the service provider.\n\n32\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.060\nSo let's take a look, first of all,\nat organizational development, then.\n\n33\n00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.500\nNow it says up here on\nthe first bullet point.\n\n34\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.695\nAnd this is why I pause.\n\n35\n00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:51.500\nIt says adoption of service management\napproach to service delivery equates a new\n\n36\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.319\nvision for the organization.\n\n37\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.380\nQuite often, we're in a position where,\nas an organization,\n\n38\n00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.460\nwe are looking to implement\nservice management.\n\n39\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.880\nMaybe we've already got some\nof this in place, though.\n\n40\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.970\nAnd this is the challenge\nthat we always have.\n\n41\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.690\nWe don't actually start off\nwith a blank piece of paper.\n\n42\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.390\nAnd, in fact I will ask you\nthis with any new service.\n\n43\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.060\nWhen we look at service design,\nI quite often ask that question.\n\n44\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.880\nWhen was the last time we\nstarted off designing a service\n\n45\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.670\nwith a blank piece of paper?\n\n46\n00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.050\nBack in the 1980s probably.\n\n47\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.720\nWe've already got\nan infrastructure in place.\n\n48\n00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.260\nNow we've already got a network\ninfrastructure in place.\n\n49\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.280\nAnd we've already got existing\nnetwork topology diagrams, but\n\n50\n00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.170\nwe've already got an organizational\ninfrastructure in place.\n\n51\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.010\nSo we never start off with\na blank piece of paper.\n\n52\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.150\nSo whilst is says it's a new vision.\n\n53\n00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.900\nIt's a change in the way that we think.\n\n54\n00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.330\nThat's what we're looking at we're looking\nat a change in the way that we do things.\n\n55\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.692\nWe're probably already doing something\nlike incident and problem resolution.\n\n56\n00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:02.799\nBut it may well be that we're\ntrying to combine the two and\n\n57\n00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.060\nthen wondering why it doesn't\nreally seem to fit the bill.\n\n58\n00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:10.320\nAnd why it doesn't really\nseem to keep people happy.\n\n59\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.470\nAnd it's because we're trying to combine\nincident and problem management, and\n\n60\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.710\nwe realize that actually we're\ntrying to do two different things.\n\n61\n00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.867\nSo this is what we mean by a new\nvision for the organization,\n\n62\n00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.152\nwe've got to change the way that we think.\n\n63\n00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:25.510\nAnd yes, we are gonna change\nthe way that we do things.\n\n64\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.420\nBut what I want to look at in\nthis particular section here\n\n65\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.710\nis the evolution of a service\nprovider organization.\n\n66\n00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:36.810\nIt'll tell at the bottom there that,\n\n67\n00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.830\nthe following slides depict\nseveral organisational structures.\n\n68\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.020\nI'm gonna talk to you about the evolution.\n\n69\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.420\nBecause when we start off\nas a service provider,\n\n70\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.960\nwe start off in one particular\ntype of organizational chart and\n\n71\n00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.580\nthen we evolve through the various\nstructures that there are.\n\n72\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.300\nAnd funnily enough, we don't often\nnotice that we're doing this, but\n\n73\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.235\nthis is quite a natural progression,\nit's quite a natural evolution.\n\n74\n00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:09.230\nHigh-performance organizations it says\ntend to drift towards decentralized\n\n75\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.010\nmanagement, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.990\nWell that's not strictly 100% true\nbecause we do need some centralization,\n\n77\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.330\nwe need standard processes,\nwe need standard ways of working, but\n\n78\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.910\nwe still need specialized skills.\n\n79\n00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.800\nWe'll come on to that in a minute.\n\n80\n00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.000\nSo the first thing that I want us to do\nis I want us to take a look at a very,\n\n81\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.830\nvery immature organization.\n\n82\n00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.050\nAnd if I can find my cursor,\nI will get us there.\n\n83\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.140\nAnd I can't find my cursor.\n\n84\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.830\nThere it is.\n\n85\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.450\nRight, it's on the screen right now.\n\n86\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.530\nIt's not where I need it to be,\nokay Right, let's start here.\n\n87\n00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.314\nThat's the easiest way of doing it, right?\n\n88\n00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:50.440\n[LAUGH] These things happen, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.078\nThese things happen.\n\n90\n00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:57.180\nAnd a bad workman always blames his tools\nand I was blaming this, okay, completely.\n\n91\n00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.470\nLet's start off here then,\nlet's start off, it's called STAGE 1.\n\n92\n00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.990\nOkay, this is what we call a very,\nwell, we'll call this a flat structure.\n\n93\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.987\nAnd a flat organizational structure,\nif you will notice here,\n\n94\n00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:11.552\nthere is no hierarchy involved.\n\n95\n00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:16.710\nIt'll tell you that it's very hard\nto integrate activities, etc.\n\n96\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.623\nWell, the problem is that\nwe've got no hierarchy, and\n\n97\n00:05:20.623 --> 00:05:25.544\nwe've got no clear point of management and\nno clear point of control.\n\n98\n00:05:25.544 --> 00:05:29.904\nAnd we call this a network structure.\n\n99\n00:05:29.904 --> 00:05:32.590\nAnd the network structure's\na very flat structure.\n\n100\n00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.460\nNow this happens in very\nsmall organizations,\n\n101\n00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.970\nor very immature service\nprovider organizations,\n\n102\n00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.880\nwhere we have a very flat structure,\nwhere there is no hierarchy.\n\n103\n00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.870\nSo everybody has their own responsibility\nbut there isn't any hierarchy within that.\n\n104\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.080\nSo Ronnie may have a responsibility for\nservers,\n\n105\n00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.830\nand I might have a responsibility for\ne-mail, for instance.\n\n106\n00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.640\nSo everybody has a very\nclear responsibility, but\n\n107\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.570\nnobody reports to anyone else.\n\n108\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.700\nThis presents problems with\ndecision-making, for a start.\n\n109\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.379\nWe don't have any high bureaucracy, okay,\n\n110\n00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:14.826\nbecause everybody's just taking\nresponsibility for their own actions.\n\n111\n00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:17.638\nBut it presents problems when\nit comes to decision-making,\n\n112\n00:06:17.638 --> 00:06:20.260\nit presents problems when\none person's not around.\n\n113\n00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.721\nBecause if we've got a very clear\ndefinition of responsibilities,\n\n114\n00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.990\nthan what about when Ronnie's not around?\n\n115\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.670\nWhat happens then?\n\n116\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.910\nSo the natural evolution is\nthat as an organization grows,\n\n117\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.430\nand I'm not just talking\nabout a service provider,\n\n118\n00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.240\nthis actually happens naturally\nwithin any company to be fair.\n\n119\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.620\nAs an organization grows we move\ntowards a directive type of approach,\n\n120\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.810\nwhich is, as you can see, is hierarchical.\n\n121\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.596\nSo we've now got formal communication and\nwe've actually now\n\n122\n00:06:52.596 --> 00:06:57.568\ngot a structure where we have\nsomebody that will make a decision.\n\n123\n00:06:57.568 --> 00:06:59.880\nIt tells you that it\nlimits decision-making.\n\n124\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.470\nIt does.\n\n125\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.320\nIt doesn't often limit innovation.\n\n126\n00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.880\nThere can be innovation, but it really\ndepends on the people that are here,\n\n127\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.010\nthe people that are at\nthis particular level.\n\n128\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:19.960\nBecause, you see, if they are quite\ndictatorial in their approach,\n\n129\n00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.879\nthen it can be very, very challenging.\n\n130\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.140\nSo then sometimes as we move,\nthen, we want to move, and\n\n131\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.480\nsometimes this particular phase is very,\nvery short.\n\n132\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.345\nAnd if I take a look at this\nparticular phase in conjunction\n\n133\n00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:37.538\nwith the previous phase.\n\n134\n00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:42.407\nCan you imagine, if you've evolved from\nhere and we're now here that means\n\n135\n00:07:42.407 --> 00:07:47.068\nthat either you're in charge of some\npeople that you were an equal with.\n\n136\n00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:52.017\nOr you are now underneath somebody\nwho was once an equal to you.\n\n137\n00:07:52.017 --> 00:07:56.958\nThis is why it talks about motivation\nbeing low, because motivation and\n\n138\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:01.494\nmorale can be incredibly low as we\nevolve from this particular flat\n\n139\n00:08:01.494 --> 00:08:04.493\nstructure through to This flat structure.\n\n140\n00:08:04.493 --> 00:08:09.972\nAnd now let's take a look at our next\nevolution and our next evolution,\n\n141\n00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:13.836\nwell that looks at services\nthrough delegation.\n\n142\n00:08:13.836 --> 00:08:18.020\nWhich means that you can see that\nwhilst we still have the hierarchy,\n\n143\n00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:23.800\nwhat we have our teams working on tasks\ninstead of individuals working on a task,\n\n144\n00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.430\nwe have a team that's working on a task.\n\n145\n00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.623\nSo something is given to the team.\n\n146\n00:08:28.623 --> 00:08:33.950\nAnd it's down to the team to organize\nhow they perform individual tasks, etc.\n\n147\n00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.230\nSo, it says they're linked\nto a reward structure so\n\n148\n00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.100\nwe're rewarding individual teams\nrather than the individual themselves.\n\n149\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:48.200\nAnd then we're moving to a what we call\ncoordination structure and a coordination\n\n150\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.840\nstructure well you say here that we've got\nan additional sort of level of management.\n\n151\n00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.561\nMiddle management there\nall not left term side and\n\n152\n00:08:56.561 --> 00:09:00.333\nnot additional level of management,\nis what we call a task manager.\n\n153\n00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:02.670\nSo he might be a project manager.\n\n154\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.610\nSo here I am and I'm sitting and\nif I can find my cursor I'm seating here.\n\n155\n00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.670\nAnd I actually report into this\nperson here as a line manager.\n\n156\n00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.060\nBut I'm actually performing work for\nthis guy here.\n\n157\n00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.991\nBecause he's my project manager.\n\n158\n00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:23.002\nAnd then eventually, so we call this\na coordination hierarchical approach.\n\n159\n00:09:23.002 --> 00:09:26.328\nA coordination organization.\n\n160\n00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:31.161\nAnd so, as we move then,\nwe move then through to here.\n\n161\n00:09:31.161 --> 00:09:34.593\nAnd this is the pinnacle,\nthis is exactly where we want to be.\n\n162\n00:09:34.593 --> 00:09:39.617\nThis is through collaboration and\nthe more mature an organization gets,\n\n163\n00:09:39.617 --> 00:09:44.650\nthe more able we are to move\ntowards a collaborative approach.\n\n164\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:50.880\nWhile yes, you still have a manager who is\na line manager to you, but then you also\n\n165\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.310\nhave an individual task manager as well,\nand they both have an equal sway.\n\n166\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:02.530\nThey both have a role to\nplay in your development,\n\n167\n00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.660\nand they also have a role to\nplay in the organization.\n\n168\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:12.122\nBut what you do have with that flat\nstructure, is that you have a sense of,\n\n169\n00:10:12.122 --> 00:10:17.663\nwell, empowerment,\nbecause everybody is at the same level.\n\n170\n00:10:17.663 --> 00:10:20.402\nWe don't have to much of hierarchy and\n\n171\n00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:26.224\neveryone here within the structure itself,\nwell we're all at the same level and\n\n172\n00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:30.952\nwe all talk to each other, and\nwe all work in a collaborative way.\n\n173\n00:10:30.952 --> 00:10:35.062\nSo, this is what we call\norganizational developement.\n\n174\n00:10:35.062 --> 00:10:38.222\nAnd you'll see here, with the way\nthat we're going to use this is,\n\n175\n00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:41.810\nwe're going to look at functional\nareas and then we look at processes.\n\n176\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.880\nSo, let's say that the person at\nthe top is functional manager.\n\n177\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.022\nSo maybe a service desk manager, but\n\n178\n00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:51.142\non the left are our different\nprocess streams there.\n\n179\n00:10:51.142 --> 00:10:55.708\nAnd so our service desk,\nwell they perform incident management,\n\n180\n00:10:55.708 --> 00:11:00.520\nthey perform problem management,\nthey perform change management,\n\n181\n00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.385\nthey perform, what else they perform?\n\n182\n00:11:03.385 --> 00:11:04.835\nRequest fulfillment.\n\n183\n00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:07.215\nService desk do absolutely everything,\ndon't they Ronnie?\n\n184\n00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:09.185\nThe service desk are stars.\n\n185\n00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:12.118\nWe absolutely love the service desk, okay?\n\n186\n00:11:12.118 --> 00:11:15.318\nSo, now, I want to go back and\nI'm looking as though here,\n\n187\n00:11:15.318 --> 00:11:18.655\nmy cursor is just not working\nin the way that it should.\n\n188\n00:11:18.655 --> 00:11:23.170\nSo, now,\nI want to go back a few slides to here.\n\n189\n00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.620\nAnd you'll notice that as\nI've already mentioned,\n\n190\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:32.540\nwe develop,\nwe evolve through those structures.\n\n191\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.328\nAnd as we call them on the left hand side,\n\n192\n00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:40.514\nthe stages of organizational development\nand an immature organization.\n\n193\n00:11:40.514 --> 00:11:45.415\nAn immature organization within\nservice management or even an immature\n\n194\n00:11:45.415 --> 00:11:50.011\norganization in itself will start\noff as a flat network structure.\n\n195\n00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:54.421\nAnd then we evolve through\na directive network structure to\n\n196\n00:11:54.421 --> 00:11:56.898\ndelegative network structure.\n\n197\n00:11:56.898 --> 00:12:00.290\nAnd then into a coordination\ntype network structure.\n\n198\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.128\nAnd then eventually,\nwe move through to the collaboration, but\n\n199\n00:12:04.128 --> 00:12:07.003\nlook at the challenges\non the right-hand side.\n\n200\n00:12:07.003 --> 00:12:10.321\nYou see,\nwhen you have that flat network structure,\n\n201\n00:12:10.321 --> 00:12:13.730\nas I've already said,\nyou have that structure.\n\n202\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.266\nAnd then all of a sudden,\none person becomes a manager, and\n\n203\n00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:19.693\nyou have that challenge of leadership.\n\n204\n00:12:19.693 --> 00:12:24.554\nAnd then as we move towards\nthe next structure which is\n\n205\n00:12:24.554 --> 00:12:30.173\nthe delegation structure,\nwell now we have task managers and\n\n206\n00:12:30.173 --> 00:12:35.263\nwe have, individual teams\nworking on specific tasks.\n\n207\n00:12:35.263 --> 00:12:38.510\nThen you have that challenge\nof autonomy there.\n\n208\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.887\nYou have the challenge where a team\nmight want to do something one way, and\n\n209\n00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:47.771\nthe manager might not necessarily agree\nwith them, and so how do we resolve that?\n\n210\n00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:51.438\nAnd then as we move towards the project\nmanagement approach where we\n\n211\n00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:55.363\nhad the project manager sitting off\nfrom the side, well then you've got\n\n212\n00:12:55.363 --> 00:12:58.862\nthat challenge of control because\nwho has control over my time?\n\n213\n00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:02.613\nIs it my line manager, or\nis it my project manager?\n\n214\n00:13:02.613 --> 00:13:05.830\nAnd of course where you have\nthis collaborative approach.\n\n215\n00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.243\nWith a collaborative structure,\n\n216\n00:13:08.243 --> 00:13:13.319\nwe have the challenge of bureaucracy\nbecause then my process manager and\n\n217\n00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:18.241\nmy functional manager, well they\nboth have an equal say over my time.\n\n218\n00:13:18.241 --> 00:13:23.511\nAnd therefore I work for both of them,\nI don't work for just one person.\n\n219\n00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:29.351\nNow each structure, there's a lot more\nto it than just these few slides.\n\n220\n00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.650\nAnd each structure will evolve.\n\n221\n00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.411\nAnd it will evolve over time.\n\n222\n00:13:33.411 --> 00:13:39.642\nAnd it will evolve over the maturity\nof our service management organization.\n\n223\n00:13:39.642 --> 00:13:42.750\nAnd also the maturity of\nour organization as whole.\n\n224\n00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:49.300\nI don't expect any one of us to when\nwe implement service management,\n\n225\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.640\nwhen we implement ITIL to start off\nwith that flat network structure.\n\n226\n00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.294\nLike I said, we do not start off with\na blank piece of paper we never do.\n\n227\n00:13:58.294 --> 00:14:02.576\nWe've already got an organizational chart\nand implementing ITIL does not mean,\n\n228\n00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:05.492\nthat we stroll out\nthe organizational chart Chart, and\n\n229\n00:14:05.492 --> 00:14:07.730\nwe start with a blank piece of paper.\n\n230\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:12.706\nAnd that's quite often a misconception,\nwhich is why the comments about we have\n\n231\n00:14:12.706 --> 00:14:17.056\na new vision, and we have a new direction,\nand we have a new way of working,\n\n232\n00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:20.603\nthat's why that can quite often\nbe a little bit misleading.\n\n233\n00:14:20.603 --> 00:14:24.298\nBecause the one thing that we don't\nwant to do is tell you to all of your\n\n234\n00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:28.350\norganizational structure away, and\nthen start again from scratch.\n\n235\n00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.465\nBecause we are not telling you to do that,\n\n236\n00:14:30.465 --> 00:14:34.464\nwhat we're doing is we're just looking\nat the evolution of an organization.\n\n237\n00:14:34.464 --> 00:14:38.596\nYou need to find where you are, and\nfind where you are on that chart and\n\n238\n00:14:38.596 --> 00:14:42.313\nat that point in time say okay,\nhow can we be more mature?'.\n\n239\n00:14:42.313 --> 00:14:44.997\nBecause what we want to do\nis be more efficient and\n\n240\n00:14:44.997 --> 00:14:47.160\nmore effective in the way that we work.\n\n241\n00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.291\nSo let's take a look at\nour next slide then.\n\n242\n00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:53.476\nIt says here when a department\nreaches a certain size,\n\n243\n00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:57.903\nit's going to be necessary to create\nsubgroups, based on maybe function or\n\n244\n00:14:57.903 --> 00:15:00.340\nmarket space or geography, or process.\n\n245\n00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.083\nIt mentioned right at\nthat very first slide,\n\n246\n00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:13.181\nthat a high-producing organization,\nwell they're more decentralized.\n\n247\n00:15:13.181 --> 00:15:15.963\nThis comes back to this\ndepartmentalization,\n\n248\n00:15:15.963 --> 00:15:20.630\nin that we will still have process owners\nand we will still have service owners.\n\n249\n00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.126\nSo we will still have a consistency.\n\n250\n00:15:23.126 --> 00:15:27.120\nNow, I might have one team perform\nan incident management in London,\n\n251\n00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.641\nanother team perform an incident\nmanagement in Florida, and\n\n252\n00:15:30.641 --> 00:15:35.020\nanother team performing an incident\nmanagement in Hong Kong.\n\n253\n00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.140\nBut I'm still going to have\none incident process owner.\n\n254\n00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.570\nAnd that one process owner is\nthe person that decides what\n\n255\n00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.793\nthe process will look like.\n\n256\n00:15:45.793 --> 00:15:52.713\nAnd all three of those geographical\nareas will follow the same process.\n\n257\n00:15:52.713 --> 00:15:54.630\nSure we'll have process models.\n\n258\n00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.577\nAnd we'll talk about those in\ngreat depth in service design and\n\n259\n00:15:57.577 --> 00:15:58.696\nin service operation.\n\n260\n00:15:58.696 --> 00:16:01.512\nAnd yes, we'll have models but\nnevertheless,\n\n261\n00:16:01.512 --> 00:16:04.060\nwe'll still have one consistent process.\n\n262\n00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:10.700\nSo our organizational design has got\nto come from, well our strategy.\n\n263\n00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.980\nAnd our strategy sets our\norganizational structure.\n\n264\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.010\nAnd our strategy or\n\n265\n00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.760\nour organizational structure then\nsets what processes we need.\n\n266\n00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:27.150\nAnd in turn that sets our hierarchies\nwhich sets who are people are,\n\n267\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.800\nwhich determines what roles and\nresponsibilities we need.\n\n268\n00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.410\nAnd then what performance measures\nwe're going to use to measure\n\n269\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.120\nwhether those roles and\nresponsibilities are being fulfilled.\n\n270\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.920\nAnd those performance measures, well\nthat will tell us what skills we need.\n\n271\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.520\nAnd if we have the right skills, then we\nshould achieve our performance measures.\n\n272\n00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.792\nIf we're achieving our performance\nmeasures, then we fulfill in our roles.\n\n273\n00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:52.292\nAnd if we fulfill in our roles,\n\n274\n00:16:52.292 --> 00:16:56.020\nthen that means that we've got\nthe right people in the right place.\n\n275\n00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:00.493\nTo be able to achieve the optimum\norganizational structure,\n\n276\n00:17:00.493 --> 00:17:03.425\nI nearly spilled the drink there [LAUGH].\n\n277\n00:17:03.425 --> 00:17:09.030\nAnd then also to be able to be effective\nand efficient in our key processes.\n\n278\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:12.480\nSo we define this from the top down.\n\n279\n00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.670\nWe start off with a strategy and\nwe work downwards.\n\n280\n00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:22.343\nBecause our structure has to be\ncompletely aligned with the strategy and\n\n281\n00:17:22.343 --> 00:17:27.027\nwith the way that we organized within\na service provider organization.\n\n282\n00:17:27.027 --> 00:17:32.790\nSo let's take a look at what roles\nwe actually need there, okay.\n\n283\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:37.485\nWell, we already mentioned in our\nfoundation class that every service\n\n284\n00:17:37.485 --> 00:17:39.294\nmust have a service owner.\n\n285\n00:17:39.294 --> 00:17:44.732\nAnd as we've already seen from foundation\nthat a service owners is responsible for\n\n286\n00:17:44.732 --> 00:17:46.208\na specific service and\n\n287\n00:17:46.208 --> 00:17:51.280\nthey ensure that that service is\nmeeting the needs of the organization.\n\n288\n00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.830\nAnd their work with service\nlevel management and business\n\n289\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:58.120\nrelationship management to ensure that\nour customers are happy with the service.\n\n290\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.800\nNow right at the very\nbottom of this slide,\n\n291\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.450\nthere it actually tells you that there\nis a handout about generic roles okay?\n\n292\n00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.740\nAnd I would like you, when we finish this\nsession, I'm going to advise you to go and\n\n293\n00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.310\nread your handout about generic roles.\n\n294\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:16.750\nIt is just a recap from foundation\nfrom your foundation class.\n\n295\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:21.040\nBut it's something that you\nwill need as a preparation for\n\n296\n00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.350\nsitting at your service strategy test.\n\n297\n00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.046\nSo we're going to look at some\nindividual process owners now.\n\n298\n00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:31.734\nAnd again these are just recaps\nover the sessions where we\n\n299\n00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:36.880\nlooked at individual processes\nwithin service strategy.\n\n300\n00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.550\nSo business relationship management,\nwell they take accountability for\n\n301\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.560\nthe relationship with the organization.\n\n302\n00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.210\nSo they'll conduct ordinance with\nthe organization to ensure that\n\n303\n00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.060\nwe are actually meeting their needs.\n\n304\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.484\nAnd they look for\nopportunities for new services.\n\n305\n00:18:54.484 --> 00:18:59.332\nAnd we expect our expect our business\nrelationship manager remember to\n\n306\n00:18:59.332 --> 00:19:01.220\nbe proactive.\n\n307\n00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.949\nNow, the person who is carrying it\nout business relationship manager,\n\n308\n00:19:05.949 --> 00:19:10.524\nmay often carry out other process\nactivities too, such as conducting\n\n309\n00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:15.118\ncustomer surveys to service level\nmanagement, defining strategy.\n\n310\n00:19:15.118 --> 00:19:18.343\nOr advising on strategy for\nstrategy management.\n\n311\n00:19:18.343 --> 00:19:22.975\nSo business relationship\nmanagement really,\n\n312\n00:19:22.975 --> 00:19:28.230\nthey are our main and\nkey link with the business.\n\n313\n00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:33.380\nAnd they are the person that well, as we\nsaid in business relationship management\n\n314\n00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.690\nepisode, they're the person that builds\nthe trust with the organization.\n\n315\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:43.990\nAnd we've got our strategy\nmanagement process owner and\n\n316\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.020\nagain, they're gonna work with all of\nthe other process owners because they\n\n317\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.760\nare responsible for\nsetting the direction for IT.\n\n318\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.930\nAnd we've got a process manager there\nwho is actually the person that\n\n319\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.770\ncompiles all of the strategies,\nthat compiles our policies,\n\n320\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.340\nthat educates our customers,\neducates our users.\n\n321\n00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.900\nAnd also will monitor\nwhether we are actually\n\n322\n00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.260\nadhering to our policies and\nour strategies.\n\n323\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.710\nThen we've got our\nportfolio process owner and\n\n324\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.450\nour portfolio process owner,\nwhat they take accountability.\n\n325\n00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.460\nAnd that's the word we always look for\nwith a process owner.\n\n326\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.480\nThey take accountability to make sure\nthat portfolio management happening.\n\n327\n00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.550\nAnd the process manager, well the process\nmanager is the person that will\n\n328\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:35.920\nwork with business relationship management\nto identify new opportunities and\n\n329\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.260\nnew services.\n\n330\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.130\nThey will work with continuous\nservice improvement to identifying\n\n331\n00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.060\nnew opportunities.\n\n332\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.620\nAnd they will also work with our\n\n333\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.080\norganization to make\nsure that we are actually\n\n334\n00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.080\ndelivering the right mix of services\nto meet the needs of the organization.\n\n335\n00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.220\nSo of course, the process manager for\nthe portfolio is responsible for\n\n336\n00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.330\nevaluating all of the services\nin our portfolio.\n\n337\n00:21:03.445 --> 00:21:08.175\nNow financial management process\nare not again takes accountability for\n\n338\n00:21:08.175 --> 00:21:10.045\nfinancial management.\n\n339\n00:21:10.045 --> 00:21:16.245\nSo they will work with the organization\nto set the direction and to translate\n\n340\n00:21:16.245 --> 00:21:21.105\nthose directional policies from\nthe organization into policies for IT.\n\n341\n00:21:22.555 --> 00:21:26.940\nWhereas the process manager,\nthey're the people that manages the other\n\n342\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.360\nperson rather than manages financial\nmanagement on a day to day basis.\n\n343\n00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.980\nSo they produce the budgets.\n\n344\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.990\nThey produce the accounting records.\n\n345\n00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.470\nThey're the person that will\nmanage any charging for instance.\n\n346\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.906\nProduces all of the reports.\n\n347\n00:21:40.906 --> 00:21:45.063\nAnd then we have the demand\nmanagement process owner.\n\n348\n00:21:45.063 --> 00:21:49.210\nAnd again, we're talking about\naccountability for demand management.\n\n349\n00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:55.025\nEnsuring that we understand\nthe demand of the organization.\n\n350\n00:21:55.025 --> 00:22:00.495\nWhereas the process manager, they're\nresponsible for defining the patterns\n\n351\n00:22:00.495 --> 00:22:04.785\nof business activity, liaising with\ncapacity management to look for\n\n352\n00:22:04.785 --> 00:22:09.195\ninnovative ways to meet\ncapacity requirements.\n\n353\n00:22:09.195 --> 00:22:13.545\nRemember with demand management, it's\nnot just about putting in more capacity.\n\n354\n00:22:13.545 --> 00:22:15.885\nIt's not just about buying more planes.\n\n355\n00:22:15.885 --> 00:22:20.260\nIt's actually about trying\nto even out the peaks and\n\n356\n00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.380\ntroughs so that we don't need\nto buy more planes, okay?\n\n357\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.690\nSo it's working very,\nvery closely with capacity management.\n\n358\n00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.097\nNow one thing I want to tell\nyou about the process owner and\n\n359\n00:22:30.097 --> 00:22:32.519\nthe process manager role is\nto think about scalability.\n\n360\n00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:34.920\nWith a large scale organization,\n\n361\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:40.980\nyou probably gonna have one process\nowner and multiple process managers.\n\n362\n00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:45.610\nWith a small organization, then it's quite\npossible that the process owner role and\n\n363\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.780\nthe process manager role will be combined.\n\n364\n00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.070\nAlways think about scalability.\n\n365\n00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.690\nThere is no right or wrong way to do this.\n\n366\n00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.410\nThis is not prescriptive.\n\n367\n00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:01.800\nWe are just telling you the processes\nthat we need to have in place.\n\n368\n00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.740\nBut who performs these processes, and\n\n369\n00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.720\nwhat your organizational chart looks like,\nwell that's completely up to you.\n\n370\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.220\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you again for\nhelping us out and\n\n371\n00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.340\ntaking a look at this idea of organizing\nfor our service strategy here.\n\n372\n00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.980\nWe do wanna make sure that we\nunderstand those different stages.\n\n373\n00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.780\nMake sure you go back through.\n\n374\n00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:26.550\nAnd also, the homework that Jo actually\nassigned you important to integrate and\n\n375\n00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:29.950\nto understand all of those\ndifferent elements combined.\n\n376\n00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.320\nWell, this is a great place for\nus to go ahead and end this episode then.\n\n377\n00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.670\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n378\n00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.090\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n379\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n380\n00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.872\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more of the\nITIL Intermediate Service

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:05.411\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:07.923\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:12.205\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:15.597\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.597 --> 00:00:19.300\nYou're watching the ITIL\nIntermediate Service Strategy show.\n\n8\n00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.790\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.940\nAnd today we're gonna be taking a look at\nimplementing service strategy in ITIL.\n\n10\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.390\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be,\n\n11\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.070\nof course, well,\nour ITIL empress herself, Jo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.350\nJo, welcome to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.540\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n14\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.550\nYet again I need the robe.\n\n15\n00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.730\nWell, once again, here you are.\n\n16\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.800\nBut you're now back with\nus on planet Earth.\n\n17\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.180\n&gt;&gt; I'm not time-traveling anymore.\n\n18\n00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.050\n&gt;&gt; No longer time-traveling,\nno longer intergalactic.\n\n19\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.480\nYou are right here at the center\nof the universe of course.\n\n20\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.800\nAnd that means it's time for\n\n21\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.030\nus to talk about the Implementation\nhere of service strategy.\n\n22\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.130\nSo Jo, where do we begin?\n\n23\n00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.849\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n24\n00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; First thing we've gotta do is work out\n\n25\n00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:02.090\nwhere we begin.\n\n26\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.820\nAnd that's a key one\nwith service strategy.\n\n27\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.900\nQuite often you think,\nit's service strategy, and therefore,\n\n28\n00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.405\nit can't be that difficult.\n\n29\n00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:14.100\nBut actually, service strategy is what\nsets the direction for the rest of IT.\n\n30\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.590\nSo we're starting at the very beginning,\n\n31\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.825\nbecause apparently I've heard that\nthat's a very good place to start.\n\n32\n00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:22.153\n&gt;&gt; At least with the number one.\n\n33\n00:01:22.153 --> 00:01:23.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, so\n\n34\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.220\nwe start off by looking right in the very\nstart in our service directory class.\n\n35\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.310\nWe looked at our four Ps,\nour four Ps of service strategy.\n\n36\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.310\nAnd we're gonna start off by\nlooking at those four Ps here.\n\n37\n00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.460\nAnd this is where we will\nstart with service strategies.\n\n38\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.230\nUnderstanding our organization.\n\n39\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.091\nSo the first thing we are going to do is\nwe are going to allocate somebody with\n\n40\n00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:50.374\nthe responsibility for service strategy.\n\n41\n00:01:50.374 --> 00:01:54.680\nAnd what they're going to do,\nis they're going to analyze the business.\n\n42\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.010\nThey're going to look at the perspective,\nand the positions, and the plans, and\n\n43\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.960\nthe patterns.\n\n44\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.960\nNow for anybody that missed the session\nwhere we looked at our four Ps,\n\n45\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.880\nwell that was probably quite\nsome time ago now, okay.\n\n46\n00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.120\nWell our four Ps are very simply this.\n\n47\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.990\nOur perspective for our organization\nis what is our organization doing,\n\n48\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.290\nwhat is their vision?\n\n49\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.480\nWhat is their perspective?\n\n50\n00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.750\nAre they going to just run the business?\n\n51\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.970\nIs that what they want to do?\n\n52\n00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.646\nTreading water,\nmaintaining the status quo.\n\n53\n00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:27.890\nOr do they want to grow their business?\n\n54\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.092\nOr do they want to transform\ntheir business, and\n\n55\n00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:35.940\ntransform means growing outside of\ntheir particular industry sector.\n\n56\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.960\nNow, don't assume that running the\nbusiness is a bad thing, because it's not.\n\n57\n00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.596\nRunning the business actually means\nthat they simply want to maintain their\n\n58\n00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:45.745\nstatus quo for a while.\n\n59\n00:02:45.745 --> 00:02:48.873\nNow, organizations such as\ngovernment departments,\n\n60\n00:02:48.873 --> 00:02:53.430\nthey will maintain a strategy or\na perspective of running the business.\n\n61\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.215\nOrganizations such as not for\n\n62\n00:02:55.215 --> 00:03:00.060\nprofits may maintain a strategy\nof just running the business.\n\n63\n00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.640\nAnd some organizations who've had a rapid\nperiod of growth, well they may also\n\n64\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.580\nmaintain a strategy of just running\nthe business for a period of time.\n\n65\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.630\nSo we have then within our organization\nwhat we call a strategic perspective.\n\n66\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.570\nAnd we have to translate that into\na strategic perspective for us.\n\n67\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.210\nBecause what we need to do is be aligned\nwith the needs of the organization and\n\n68\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.080\nfacilitate their strategy.\n\n69\n00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.310\nSo that top box in the middle\nthere on this diagram,\n\n70\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.550\nit says it depends on type one,\ntwo or three, and it does.\n\n71\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.650\nAn internal service provider, which is\na type one, well if it's internal to\n\n72\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.870\nthe business unit we want to be completely\naligned with the business unit.\n\n73\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.558\nNow a type two service provider\nis a shared service provider.\n\n74\n00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:52.650\nNow different business units\nmay have different strategies.\n\n75\n00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.540\nAnd then a type three service provider,\nnow there's your challenge.\n\n76\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.060\nBecause a type three service provider,\nyou are external to the organization, and\n\n77\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.490\nyou may have other customers.\n\n78\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.100\nWhich means that when you are meeting\nthe needs of this particular organisation,\n\n79\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.740\nyour strategy must reflect\nthis organization.\n\n80\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.240\nBut, you may have the added challenge\nof when you are meeting the needs of\n\n81\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.375\nanother organization, then your strategy\nmay have to reflect that organization.\n\n82\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.330\nNow as an external service provider,\nyou might find yourself in the position\n\n83\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.200\nwhere you are simply running one\nbusiness but growing another business,\n\n84\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.490\nand perhaps even transforming\nanother business.\n\n85\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.370\nNow when we looked at\nthat particular section,\n\n86\n00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.830\nwhen we looked at the episode\nwhere we analyzed our four Ps,\n\n87\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.560\nwe saw what those four Ps meant for\nthe service provider.\n\n88\n00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.120\nAnd here in service strategy when\nwe're talking about implementation,\n\n89\n00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.130\nthis is where we've got to start.\n\n90\n00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.530\nUnderstanding the four Ps for the\norganization, and what that means to us.\n\n91\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.154\nWhat is our strategic position?\n\n92\n00:04:59.154 --> 00:05:05.030\nNow based on our understanding of\nthe perspective, where are we right now?\n\n93\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.570\nWhat customers do we serve, and\nwhat market spaces can we serve?\n\n94\n00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.470\nSo what is our position?\n\n95\n00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.410\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n96\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.960\nWhat are we going to grow into?\n\n97\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.470\nAnd that should then\nlead into specific plans,\n\n98\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.867\nand then patterns of behavior,\nor patterns of execution.\n\n99\n00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:28.610\nSo the key is to start off with\nour strategic perspective.\n\n100\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.100\nUnderstand who our organization is.\n\n101\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.120\nWhat it is they want to achieve.\n\n102\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.000\nAnd then translate that into something\nthat is meaningful for us, okay.\n\n103\n00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.043\nThe third bullet point down is\na really important one, and\n\n104\n00:05:42.043 --> 00:05:44.145\nit's sometimes somewhere\nwhere we all get stuck.\n\n105\n00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:47.682\nAnd it says there that the traditional\nservice providers will allow their\n\n106\n00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:49.520\ntechnology to influence the market.\n\n107\n00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.750\nIn other words, what we do right now will,\nand what we have in front of us\n\n108\n00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.590\ninfluences our market and\ninfluences the directions that we go in.\n\n109\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.660\nI just had an online conversation,\nas it were,\n\n110\n00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:10.020\nwith somebody not too long ago where I\nactually did exactly the same thing.\n\n111\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.241\nAnd I said, I simply made the statement,\nwell, I couldn't come and\n\n112\n00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.110\nwork for an organization like that,\n\n113\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.710\nbecause the technology is\ndifferent to that which I prefer.\n\n114\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.284\nNow, there's a statement that a lot of\nservice providers will actually make.\n\n115\n00:06:27.284 --> 00:06:32.040\nWell, I can't go into that market\nspace because this is not within my\n\n116\n00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.607\nrealm of experience.\n\n117\n00:06:33.607 --> 00:06:38.426\nI cannot make this offering to our\ncustomer because this is not In\n\n118\n00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:42.170\nline with the technology that we support.\n\n119\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.840\nOr we want to innovate\nin this direction and\n\n120\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.150\nthe customer wants to\ngo in that direction.\n\n121\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.599\nWe are here to provide\nvalue to our organization.\n\n122\n00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.010\nI have said previously,\nand I will say it again,\n\n123\n00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.606\nthat there's always somebody knocking on\nthe door of your CEO offering to do your\n\n124\n00:07:01.606 --> 00:07:04.939\njob to a higher quality, and\npotentially for less money.\n\n125\n00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:09.670\nAnd so we have to acknowledge that\nwe in IT have competition out there.\n\n126\n00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.550\nWhether we're an internal\nservice provider or\n\n127\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.930\nwhether we're an external service\nprovider, we have competition.\n\n128\n00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.210\nAnd it's our role to align ourselves\nwith the needs of the organization.\n\n129\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.048\nSo where do we start when we're\nimplementing service strategy?\n\n130\n00:07:23.048 --> 00:07:26.744\nWell, we go and\nsee what the organization are doing, and\n\n131\n00:07:26.744 --> 00:07:29.985\nwe understand how we can\nalign ourselves to them.\n\n132\n00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:33.253\nSo we'll do a current state assessment and\n\n133\n00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:38.900\nwe will do a target state assessment for\nthe implementation, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.950\nWhere are we right now, and where do\nwe want to be, and what are the gaps?\n\n135\n00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.680\nAnd then we create a project.\n\n136\n00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.084\nWe estimate how long that project is going\nto take to implement service strategy.\n\n137\n00:07:50.084 --> 00:07:53.780\nAnd then we will consolidate that project.\n\n138\n00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.833\nIn other words,\nwhat we will do is we will create tasks.\n\n139\n00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:59.879\nAnd we will create activity streams and\n\n140\n00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:05.320\nthen we will consolidate each\nof those activity streams.\n\n141\n00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.220\nNow, we've all seen a project Gantt\nchart and we need to do something very,\n\n142\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.600\nvery similar when we're implementing\nservice strategy, it is a project.\n\n143\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.630\nAs we implement service management,\nit's a project.\n\n144\n00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:22.050\nIt's not something that you can just wave\nmagic wand over and it will just happen.\n\n145\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.290\nWe have to have a consistent,\n\n146\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.200\nwe have to have a documented,\nformalized approach.\n\n147\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.610\nThis is not something\nthat we can do ad hoc.\n\n148\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.810\nSo the first thing that we need to do is,\nwell, we need to design it.\n\n149\n00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.050\nWe need to design what our processes\nare going to look like and\n\n150\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:46.630\nwe need to design all of our\nmeasurements for our processes as well.\n\n151\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.390\nWhat tools do we need for our processes?\n\n152\n00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.820\nWho is actually going to\nperform our processes?\n\n153\n00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.390\nAnd what skills do we need for\nthose processes as well?\n\n154\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.220\nWhat about the actual services themselves?\n\n155\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.250\nWe're defining a service strategy\nthat will bring in new services.\n\n156\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.870\nSo what type of services do we want?\n\n157\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.770\nWhat type of services are we looking for?\n\n158\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.200\nWhere are out market spaces?\n\n159\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.270\nWho are our customers?\n\n160\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.638\nAll of this is part of our\nservice strategy design,\n\n161\n00:09:17.638 --> 00:09:22.923\ndesigning how we're going to\nimplement service strategy and\n\n162\n00:09:22.923 --> 00:09:27.405\nhow we're going to run service strategy,\nas well.\n\n163\n00:09:27.405 --> 00:09:32.052\nNow, the bottom there, it tell us\nthe service portfolio management process\n\n164\n00:09:32.052 --> 00:09:36.781\nshould be designed before we look to\ndesign any services, and that's right.\n\n165\n00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:41.781\nBecause service portfolio management,\nI will put my teeth in today, service\n\n166\n00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:47.025\nportfolio management will tell us what\ntype of services that we're looking for.\n\n167\n00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:51.678\nService portfolio management ensures that\nwe've got the right mix of services.\n\n168\n00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:56.439\nSo portfolio management will take\nthat control over those services and\n\n169\n00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:58.921\nover that decision making process.\n\n170\n00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:03.280\nIf we don't have somebody to control\nthe decision making process,\n\n171\n00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.780\nthen we could decide on anything.\n\n172\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.020\nIn a previous episode, I mentioned\nan organization where I consulted\n\n173\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.190\nwith where they had lost quite a few\nmillions of dollars, unfortunately,\n\n174\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:21.270\nbecause project or service portfolio\nmanagement was not in place, and\n\n175\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.950\nthe change proposal\nmechanism was not in place.\n\n176\n00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.180\nBecause business cases were raised.\n\n177\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.610\nTwo opposing business cases, both at\nopposite sides of the world as well.\n\n178\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.020\nTwo opposing business cases were raised,\nsubmitted and approved.\n\n179\n00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.070\nBecause we don't expect our\nboard of directors, well,\n\n180\n00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.890\nwe don't expect them to\nbe technical people.\n\n181\n00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.740\nThey just see a challenge.\n\n182\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.430\nAnd it's quite possible as in this case.\n\n183\n00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.540\nThe one business case was approved to\nupgrade the current version of email and\n\n184\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.610\nanother business case was\napproved to replace email.\n\n185\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.370\nAnd both of these were, well,\nthey were both approved and\n\n186\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.500\nthen projects were started, and millions\nof dollars were lost because of this.\n\n187\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.060\nThis is why it's important that we have\nservice portfolio management in place.\n\n188\n00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.140\nBecause we don't want\nto make that mistake.\n\n189\n00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.610\nSo then we have to build\nall of our processes.\n\n190\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.120\nWe have to sit down and\nactually define our processes.\n\n191\n00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.680\nAnd define the tools,\nand the measurements,\n\n192\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.340\nhow we're going to measure these\nprocesses once they're in place.\n\n193\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.820\nAnd we have to make sure that\nwe test all of these tools, and\n\n194\n00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.820\nwe test that the processes work.\n\n195\n00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.620\nAnd that means giving people\nthe right amount of training.\n\n196\n00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.910\nAnd then once we've\nimplemented any process,\n\n197\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.950\nthen we look back to see whether\nit is efficient and effective.\n\n198\n00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.520\nBecause, let's face it,\nthat's what we're designing it to be.\n\n199\n00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.000\nAnd then as we operate all of our\nprocesses in an ongoing basis,\n\n200\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.840\nthink about CMMI,\n\n201\n00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.750\nthink about the level of maturity\nthat we want our processes to be at.\n\n202\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.950\nAnd if you're not sure about CMMI\ntechniques, then I would please ask you to\n\n203\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:07.500\ngo away and take a look at the continual\nservice improvement section.\n\n204\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.950\nThe continual,\nCSI class as we like to call it.\n\n205\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.180\nTake a look there and\nyou'll see on the tools and techniques,\n\n206\n00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:19.079\nthe CMMI approach for\nmaturity of processes.\n\n207\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.440\nNow we're not telling you that you\nneed to be a level five with all of\n\n208\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.200\nyour processes.\n\n209\n00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.990\nWhen you first implement a process\nyou're not going to be at level five.\n\n210\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.640\nBut you don't need to be at level zero or\na level one either,\n\n211\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.560\nwhich is an ad hoc process.\n\n212\n00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.250\nWe've already talked about designing\na process, and transitioning a process,\n\n213\n00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.650\nimplementing it and testing that it works.\n\n214\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.150\nSo make sure that we need\nto be at least at level\n\n215\n00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.860\nthree to four when we implement a process.\n\n216\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.046\nAnd if we've tested it correctly for\nefficiency and defectiveness and\n\n217\n00:12:52.046 --> 00:12:54.278\nit's consistent and it's managed,\n\n218\n00:12:54.278 --> 00:12:58.268\nthen we'll achieve that without\nany problems whatsoever, okay.\n\n219\n00:12:58.268 --> 00:13:00.267\nSo here in service operations, and\n\n220\n00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:03.205\nthis is where we monitor\nthat these processes work.\n\n221\n00:13:03.205 --> 00:13:07.891\nThen we make sure that service portfolio\nmanagement is coming up with ideas for\n\n222\n00:13:07.891 --> 00:13:08.816\nnew services.\n\n223\n00:13:08.816 --> 00:13:12.702\nThe business cases are being approved and\nthey are being compiled,\n\n224\n00:13:12.702 --> 00:13:15.850\nsome business cases are rejected,\nand that's okay.\n\n225\n00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.730\nAnd that the right level of services\ncan be found in the service catalog.\n\n226\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.940\nThat we don't have too much\nduplication in our services, and\n\n227\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.190\nthe services are being\nretired when they need to be.\n\n228\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.590\nAnd then, of course, CSI plays\na really big part in service strategy,\n\n229\n00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.249\nbecause CSI recommends improvements.\n\n230\n00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.640\nCSI is that life cycle phase\nthat will come along and\n\n231\n00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.590\nwill measure whether our\nprocesses are working.\n\n232\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:50.170\nIt will also measure whether our\ntools are functioning correctly and\n\n233\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:57.240\nwhether we are actually measuring\nthe right parts of our processes as well.\n\n234\n00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.850\nThey will evaluate if our strategy,\nas a whole,\n\n235\n00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.850\nis meeting the objectives and\nmeeting the needs of the organization.\n\n236\n00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.300\nSo what does strategy do then?\n\n237\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.230\nWe know that strategy\ndefines the strategy for\n\n238\n00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.240\nthe whole of the IT service\nprovider organization.\n\n239\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.270\nWhich means the strategy sets\nour policies in service design.\n\n240\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:27.640\nIt sets the policies for what is\nconsidered to be customer satisfaction.\n\n241\n00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.927\nIt actually defines how we're going\nto achieve customer satisfaction and\n\n242\n00:14:31.927 --> 00:14:34.275\nit sets design boundaries, as well.\n\n243\n00:14:34.275 --> 00:14:37.635\nSo strategy tells us what we can buy and\nwhat we can't buy.\n\n244\n00:14:37.635 --> 00:14:41.435\nStrategy will tell us what is beyond\nthe realms of possibility and\n\n245\n00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:43.835\nwhat's perfectly feasible.\n\n246\n00:14:43.835 --> 00:14:47.475\nIn another of your episode, I told you\nabout the organization that I worked with,\n\n247\n00:14:47.475 --> 00:14:55.040\nthat actually moved from a Windows\nenvironment to an Apple-based environment.\n\n248\n00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.980\nNow, service strategy, well,\nthey get involved because they set that\n\n249\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.971\ndirection and they will tell us\nwhether that's possible or not.\n\n250\n00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:06.810\nIs it something that we want to achieve or\nis it something that actually\n\n251\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.180\ndoes not align ourselves with\nthe vision of the organization and\n\n252\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.070\ntherefore it's not\nsomething that we can do.\n\n253\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.810\nAnd even if we had the request\nin to use those products,\n\n254\n00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.860\nthen maybe it's not something\nthat aligns with the vision.\n\n255\n00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.790\nStrategy also tells us how we transition.\n\n256\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.970\nNow, strategy, we talk policies a lot\nin service transition cuz we talk about\n\n257\n00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.450\nrelease and deployment policies and\nwe talk about change policies.\n\n258\n00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.650\nThese policies are directed\nby service strategy.\n\n259\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.260\nThey are not defined for service strategy.\n\n260\n00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.330\nPolicies for change and the policies for\n\n261\n00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.848\nreleasing deployment manager\nare defined by the process owners.\n\n262\n00:15:47.848 --> 00:15:51.685\nBut nevertheless,\nservice strategy sets the direction.\n\n263\n00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:56.767\nSo service strategy will tell us what's\nacceptable and what's not acceptable.\n\n264\n00:15:56.767 --> 00:16:01.835\nAnd service strategy gives us\nthe boundaries within which to work.\n\n265\n00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:06.690\nAnd service strategy also gives\nus the boundaries within which\n\n266\n00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.543\nwe can sign off on services that\nhave been deployed into the live\n\n267\n00:16:11.543 --> 00:16:15.130\nenvironment at the end\nof early life support.\n\n268\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.850\nNow, service operation?\n\n269\n00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:23.780\nWell, service strategy again gives us\npolicies within which we will work.\n\n270\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.120\nLet's think about service\nlevel management for instance.\n\n271\n00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.640\nService level management, we define\nthat in service design, okay, and\n\n272\n00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.420\nwe define for any new service.\n\n273\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.792\nWe come up with the SLR, that original\nservice level requirements document, and\n\n274\n00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:42.770\nover time throughout design and transition\nwe evolve the targets in that SLR.\n\n275\n00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.910\nUntil at the end of early\nlife support it's signed and\n\n276\n00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:51.550\nbecomes a signed service level\nagreement within service operation.\n\n277\n00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:56.400\nNow after that, on an ongoing basis,\nwe'll conduct a service review meeting\n\n278\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.910\nbetween us and service level management\nand the organization and our customers.\n\n279\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.300\nHow often do we have these meetings?\n\n280\n00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.340\nService strategy can help us with that.\n\n281\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:11.880\nService strategy defines how often we\nshould have service review meetings.\n\n282\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.910\nService strategy may even define\nsomething that says, well,\n\n283\n00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.570\nwe start off with a meeting every month.\n\n284\n00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:21.880\nAnd then as that service becomes\nembedded into the live environment and\n\n285\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.990\nour customers become happy and\n\n286\n00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:29.197\nthe service settles down, then we\nwill conduct service review meetings.\n\n287\n00:17:29.197 --> 00:17:34.100\nMaybe every two months, and\nafter a year, maybe every three months.\n\n288\n00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:39.470\nThose policies are directed\nby service strategy.\n\n289\n00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.740\nNow, I'm not saying that service strategy\nactually define the exact policies for\n\n290\n00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.650\nevery service, no they don't, but\nthey will give us a direction.\n\n291\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.120\nThat's what strategy's all about, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.070\nIt gives us a direction.\n\n293\n00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:58.800\nAnd of course, strategy, well,\nin terms of CSI, strategy tells\n\n294\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:04.230\nCSI exactly what we're doing right now,\nwhat direction we're heading in.\n\n295\n00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.410\nAnd CSI has a responsibility to\nensure that everything that we do\n\n296\n00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.050\naligns us with that vision and\naligns us with that direction.\n\n297\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:18.580\nAnd so strategy and CSI work very,\nvery closely together.\n\n298\n00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.929\nAs it says there, CSI is often\na trigger for service strategy.\n\n299\n00:18:21.929 --> 00:18:29.537\nBut strategy is actually what tells\ncontinual service improvement even,\n\n300\n00:18:29.537 --> 00:18:35.224\n[LAUGH] exactly what we need\nto be aligning ourselves to.\n\n301\n00:18:35.224 --> 00:18:40.414\nSo CSI takes direction from strategy, but\n\n302\n00:18:40.414 --> 00:18:47.340\nstrategy is actually\na result of CSI activities.\n\n303\n00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.810\nSo the two are very, very close.\n\n304\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.490\nAnd they work hand in hand all the time.\n\n305\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.422\nSo, that was a very long winded way\nof answering your question, Ronnie.\n\n306\n00:18:58.422 --> 00:19:00.553\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where do you start?\n\n307\n00:19:00.553 --> 00:19:01.618\nWell, at the beginning, right?\n\n308\n00:19:01.618 --> 00:19:02.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n309\n00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.363\n&gt;&gt; We start with\nunderstanding our full piece.\n\n310\n00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:08.150\nAnd that's the full piece for our\norganization, and that's the full piece\n\n311\n00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:16.000\nthen for\nour IT service provider organization.\n\n312\n00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.440\nAnd by understanding those full piece,\n\n313\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.800\nwe can then start to implement\nservice strategy processes.\n\n314\n00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.610\nUltimately what we want is a very clear\ndirection for our IT service provider\n\n315\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:34.790\norganization that is completely aligned to\nthe direction of our organization itself.\n\n316\n00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:39.940\nAnd so what we want from service\nstrategy are very clear policies,\n\n317\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:46.440\nare very clear processes, that will allow\nus to manage our services going forward.\n\n318\n00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.720\nAnd we also want services and\nnew ideas for\n\n319\n00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.810\nservices that actually\nare aligned to the business.\n\n320\n00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:57.348\nAnd so service strategy tells us what\nthat alignment should look like.\n\n321\n00:19:57.348 --> 00:19:59.639\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, well thank you again for\n\n322\n00:19:59.639 --> 00:20:03.010\nhelping us out here as we\ntake a look at this idea.\n\n323\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.950\nIt is a lot of information,\n\n324\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.590\nbut we do see how service strategy\nhas its hand in everything as well as\n\n325\n00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.260\nalso gets us input from some of\nthe other lifecycle processes too.\n\n326\n00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.350\nWell this is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n327\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:21.130\nSigning off for\nIT pro TV I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n328\n00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:22.200\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

00:00:08.231\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:12.317\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:17.823\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode\nright here on

at\nautomation, challenges CFS and risks.\n\n8\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.930\nAnd her to help us in that\ntoung twisting show title\n\n9\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.810\nIt is going to be our iTel\nmonarch herself, Miss.\n\n10\n00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.330\nJo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.620\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.390\n&gt;&gt; That one gets you\nevery time doesn't it?\n\n13\n00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does, I don't know why,\nthose letters just twist me around.\n\n14\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.040\nAll right, so Jo, there is a plethora of\n\n15\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.950\ndifferent topics it looks like that\nwe're taking a look at here today.\n\n16\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.240\nSo, Joe help us out\nwhere we're gonna begin.\n\n17\n00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay where we're gonna begin\nis with service automation,\n\n18\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.490\nwe're just going to look for\n\n19\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.100\nvery very briefly what can ultimate\nwithin service strategy and then just to\n\n20\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.880\nround off our final session here Covering\ncourse content the service strategy,\n\n21\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.620\nwe're going to look at the challenges and\nthe critical success factors and\n\n22\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.410\nthe risks associated with implementing and\nthen running with service strategy.\n\n23\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.410\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n24\n00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.480\n&gt;&gt; So, we'll start off with\ntaking a look at automation.\n\n25\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.370\nI've got two words to say.\n\n26\n00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.540\nWhen it comes to automation, and it's the\nsame for every single lifecycle phase and\n\n27\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.710\nevery single process,\nthose two words are where appropriate.\n\n28\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.210\nIt tells us that automation\nexists to enhance performance.\n\n29\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.620\nBut if automation is\nconfigured incorrectly,\n\n30\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.730\nthen it's not going to enhance anything.\n\n31\n00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.960\nAnd if we don't have a process that\nhas been designed for efficiency and\n\n32\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.550\neffectiveness, well, it's just going\nto get us to that bad result quicker.\n\n33\n00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.780\nSo, we always say,\nwhere appropriate with automation.\n\n34\n00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.170\nAnd you see benefits, there are only\nsome examples of some benefits.\n\n35\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.260\nThey are listed on the lower\nhalf of the slide.\n\n36\n00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.330\nAnd you can see what we can\nachieve with automation.\n\n37\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.160\nBut as I've all ready\nsaid with automation,\n\n38\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.330\nif it's configured badly, then we're not\ngoing to achieve any of these benefits,\n\n39\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.990\nand in fact what we're actually going\nto do is make life worse for us.\n\n40\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.119\nNow, let's look at where we do\nuse automation as a standard.\n\n41\n00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.970\nWe'd use automation in a process\ncalled event management,\n\n42\n00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.640\nwhich we find in service operation.\n\n43\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.090\nNow, event management is\ngoing to help us enormously,\n\n44\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.750\nbecause it helps us by measuring and\nmonitoring all of our processes,\n\n45\n00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.810\nand all of our services, and\nour service components as well.\n\n46\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.690\nSo, we talk about\noptimizing our resources.\n\n47\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.530\nWell again, this is another area\nwhere automation will help us,\n\n48\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.700\ndata capture, data sharing,\nthat will, automation will help\n\n49\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.760\nus in that particular area, but go back to\nknowledge management again as a process.\n\n50\n00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.800\nYou'll find knowledge management\nis service transition, and\n\n51\n00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.150\nknowledge management will tell\nus that we only capture data\n\n52\n00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.660\nif it's going to tell us something.\n\n53\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.290\nIn order words, if it's going to allow\nus to make an informed decision.\n\n54\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.890\nSo again, if we're capturing data that\nwe don't need, then we're automating for\n\n55\n00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.080\nthe sake of automating, and\nnot automating for a purpose in mind.\n\n56\n00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.640\nAnd automation should\nbe where appropriate.\n\n57\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.100\nSo yes, look for\nopportunities to automate.\n\n58\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.310\nBut understand that the first thing\nthat we've got to do is we've got to\n\n59\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.050\ndefine the procedures.\n\n60\n00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.800\nWe've got to define the processes.\n\n61\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.060\nAnd we've got to understand\nthe relationships between our processes\n\n62\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.850\nbefore we can automate.\n\n63\n00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.460\nThere's an example up there\nabout self service situations.\n\n64\n00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.795\nSee your not the only one\nthat's struggling today Ronnie.\n\n65\n00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:54.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's an example about self service\n\n66\n00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.180\nsituations and quite often we will\nautomate in self service situations.\n\n67\n00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.170\nBut I don't know about you, but\n\n68\n00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.500\nI get really really frustrated with\nsome of these self service tolls,\n\n69\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.750\nbecause where we've automated and\nwe cannot bypass those tolls.\n\n70\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.640\nWell I've got a very strange accent,\nI'll admit that.\n\n71\n00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.110\nNow, I've got a strange accent for\nsome people and for other people,\n\n72\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.800\nit's a perfectly normal accent, but I can\nguarantee, for the self-service tools,\n\n73\n00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.820\nwhen it comes to any sort of\nvoice recognition system,\n\n74\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.490\nIt doesn't like me [LAUGH].\n\n75\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.090\nIt really hates me and I struggle.\n\n76\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.186\nAnd sometimes there's not an option there\nto actually speak to a real person.\n\n77\n00:04:37.186 --> 00:04:39.600\nSo in self-service situations for\n\n78\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.245\nme personally, I find the automation\nto be a complete hinderance.\n\n79\n00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:45.615\nAnd for me as a customer,\n\n80\n00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:50.175\nwell it would turn me off a particular\nservice if I find that all\n\n81\n00:04:50.175 --> 00:04:54.245\nI can do is talk to an answering machine\nthat simply doesn't understand my accent.\n\n82\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.520\nNow, we have to think about this\nbecause we're providing a service and\n\n83\n00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.910\nwe're providing value to our organization\nand so, as I've already said, automation,\n\n84\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.810\nwhere appropriate and just think about\nthe appropriateness of that automation,\n\n85\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.110\nyou might find that you've got a customer\nor an end user who's similar to me, and\n\n86\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.630\nwho's simply because of geographical\ncircumstances or whatever\n\n87\n00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.650\ncannot get on without automation, in which\ncase it's actually being a hindrance and\n\n88\n00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.460\nit's causing customer dissatisfaction,\nnot satisfaction.\n\n89\n00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.230\nWe will use automation within IT, and\nwe'll use automation to do things like\n\n90\n00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:38.010\nmodelling for us, the what if scenarios\nthat happens in capacity management.\n\n91\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.880\nBe careful with automating the service\ncatalog, now I would like to see\n\n92\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.300\nan automation of relationships\nbetween configuration management and\n\n93\n00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.300\nthe service catalogue, so\nwhen something is updated,\n\n94\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.810\na component is updated in\nthe configuration management system,\n\n95\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.495\nthen that is automatically\nreflected in our service catalogue.\n\n96\n00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:04.260\nBut as I say, just be careful,\nbefore you automate any relationship\n\n97\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.510\nunderstand what it is you're automating\nand the reason why you're automating it.\n\n98\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.950\nWe've already talked about detection and\nmonitoring.\n\n99\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.074\nWe may automate things like\nprioritization of requests et cetera.\n\n100\n00:06:17.074 --> 00:06:20.260\nAgain that has to be agreed in\nthe service level agreement.\n\n101\n00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.700\nSo, you have to understand\nwhat you're automated.\n\n102\n00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.610\nAnd we automate that in our\nservice management tool.\n\n103\n00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.830\nYou might ask yourself,\nwhy does that feature in service strategy,\n\n104\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.100\nbecause request fulfillment and\nincident management etcetera were\n\n105\n00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.380\nthe service operation processes or because\nwe have to have a strategy for automation.\n\n106\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.610\nAnd so that's the reason why\nit's featured here because\n\n107\n00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.390\nwe have to have a strategy for it.\n\n108\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:53.140\nSo- Service Automation is not a bad thing,\nbut it has to be an appropriate thing.\n\n109\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.160\nAnd as you see in the blue box at\nthe bottom of this screen there.\n\n110\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.680\nThe process in brackets or in parenthesis,\n\n111\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.490\nthese are examples of processes that\ncan be connected through automation.\n\n112\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.660\nIn other words I've already mentioned\nhow we can connect prioritization,\n\n113\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.060\netc and how we can make configuration\nmanagement to service catalog management.\n\n114\n00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.010\nWell, we can connect\nconfiguration management to\n\n115\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.380\nlots of other processes as well, okay?\n\n116\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.830\nBut we will take a further look at these\nparticular connections when we look at\n\n117\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.870\nthe MALC, the managing across\nthe life cycle qualification, and\n\n118\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:35.560\nwe take a look in that class at\nthe dependencies between these processes.\n\n119\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:42.850\nAnd in fact, the success of\nthe MALC Certification is really dependent\n\n120\n00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.820\non you understanding the relationships\nbetween all of these processes.\n\n121\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.662\nSo, we'll explore that further\nin that particular class.\n\n122\n00:07:52.662 --> 00:07:55.042\nSo now, I wanna get on to challenges.\n\n123\n00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:59.993\nAnd what is it that's going to prevent\nus from implementing service strategy?\n\n124\n00:07:59.993 --> 00:08:04.100\nWell, quite often the complexity\nof our organization, and\n\n125\n00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.092\nthe complexity of our IT service\norganization can give us a challenge when\n\n126\n00:08:09.092 --> 00:08:12.170\nit comes to implementing service strategy.\n\n127\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.870\nIn a previous session,\nwe looked at organizational structures, if\n\n128\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:24.040\nwe have the wrong organizational structure\nfor the maturity of our organization.\n\n129\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.588\nThen, that can hinder us in\nterms of service strategy.\n\n130\n00:08:27.588 --> 00:08:30.158\nIf I going back to a previous\nsession where we looked at\n\n131\n00:08:30.158 --> 00:08:31.592\norganizational structure.\n\n132\n00:08:31.592 --> 00:08:35.380\nAnd we have these hierarchical\norganizational structures and\n\n133\n00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.025\nwe want to work towards collaboration or\nin collaboration,\n\n134\n00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:42.920\nwe could have two or\nthree potential buying managers.\n\n135\n00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.710\nWell, can you imagine,\nthat we've got one line of manager for\n\n136\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.810\nwhere we sit, and they want us to do\none thing, and then we've got two or\n\n137\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.660\nthree process or task managers that\nare asking us to do something else.\n\n138\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.185\nWho is it that decides\nwhat we actually do?\n\n139\n00:08:59.185 --> 00:09:03.709\nWith service strategy can help\nbecause service strategy can gives us\n\n140\n00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:07.750\npolicies to deal with those\nparticular situations.\n\n141\n00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.860\nBut where we got the complex\nstructure within our organization,\n\n142\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.260\nthen that makes strategy complex as well,\nokay?\n\n143\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.790\nSo we have to translate the business\nstrategy in the business\n\n144\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.860\ndirection into a strategy\nin a direction for IT.\n\n145\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.330\nAgain, that's a challenge.\n\n146\n00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.510\nIf you don't understand\nthe organization And\n\n147\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.460\nbusiness relationship management\nneeds to help us with this.\n\n148\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.720\nIf you don't understand the organization\nand you don't understand how to\n\n149\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.120\ntranslate a strategy into policies and\nthat's going to be very very difficult.\n\n150\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.690\nNow we're talking about governance, so\n\n151\n00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.880\nwe're talking about the management\nin the direction of IT.\n\n152\n00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.810\nSo this is not a technical task.\n\n153\n00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.240\nThis is not a technical role or activity.\n\n154\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.020\nAnd this is where we quite\noften fall short in IT.\n\n155\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.390\nIs that we like to concentrate\non the technical side of things.\n\n156\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.580\nWe don't particularly like to\nspend too much time thinking about\n\n157\n00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.930\nthe management side of things,\nand this is where ITIL comes in.\n\n158\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:12.630\nThis is where IT service management\nreally delivers its value because\n\n159\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.690\nwhat we're doing is we're concentrating\non the management of our IT services.\n\n160\n00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.940\nWe know that we need technical skills, but\nwe also have to acknowledge that we need\n\n161\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.370\nskills that will help us\ndrive our direction as well.\n\n162\n00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.410\nNow under preserving value,\nthat first fact there is really important.\n\n163\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.790\nWe shouldn't lose sight of\nthe fact that value is perception.\n\n164\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.230\nValue is a mixture of outcomes achieved or\nfacilitated,\n\n165\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:46.750\nit's a mixture of preferences and\nit's a mixture of customer perception.\n\n166\n00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:52.340\nAnd our organization will perceive\nwhether we have delivered value or not.\n\n167\n00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.890\nNow value perception\nalso changes over time.\n\n168\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.810\nSo it doesn't really remain static.\n\n169\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.830\nAnd what I value today I probably am\nnot gonna value in two years time,\n\n170\n00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.470\nbecause hey technology moves on.\n\n171\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:12.300\nSo we've got to be incredibly careful that\nwhen we articulate value perception, here\n\n172\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.340\nin service strategy, that we do that with\nan understanding that's going to change.\n\n173\n00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.310\nSo our strategy has to look forward.\n\n174\n00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.570\nIt can't just concentrate\non where we are right now.\n\n175\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.240\nStrategy is all about\nimplementing a consistency and\n\n176\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.770\nimplementing policies\nthat allow us to manage\n\n177\n00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:38.110\nour IT services with consistency,\nbut in a structured manner.\n\n178\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:43.010\nIf we're consistent and we are efficient\nin what we do than look at\n\n179\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:48.560\nthe maintaining operational effectiveness\nand efficiency in reducing hidden cost.\n\n180\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.728\nWe do that, because that happens,\nbecause we're being efficient and\n\n181\n00:11:52.728 --> 00:11:54.542\nwere being effective as well.\n\n182\n00:11:54.542 --> 00:11:59.294\nNow the second from last bullet point\nhere on this particular slide talks about\n\n183\n00:11:59.294 --> 00:12:04.478\npublicizing hidden benefits, and I'm not\ngonna spend too long talking about this,\n\n184\n00:12:04.478 --> 00:12:08.220\nbecause we talked about this\nin the previous episode.\n\n185\n00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.638\nBut it's suffice to say that in IT, we're\nnot very good at marketing ourselves,\n\n186\n00:12:12.638 --> 00:12:16.427\nand we need to get smarter at really\nselling the benefits of what we do.\n\n187\n00:12:16.427 --> 00:12:20.713\nI've said previously,\nnobody opens their laptop on a morning and\n\n188\n00:12:20.713 --> 00:12:26.220\nsays I'm so thankful that everything's\nup and running, this is great.\n\n189\n00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:31.170\nI'm so thankful to IT that I have\nabsolutely everything at my fingertips.\n\n190\n00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.050\nThe only time that you say anything when\nyou open up your laptop on a morning,\n\n191\n00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.800\nit's when something is not working.\n\n192\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.600\nSo, we're not very good at selling\nourselves and our customers will\n\n193\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.740\nquite often have a negative perception\nof IT, purely because of that.\n\n194\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.110\nAnd it's not that we're\nnot delivering value,\n\n195\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.320\nit's just that they only\nnotice when we don't.\n\n196\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.060\nWe've just got to get a little bit better\nat it and that's one of our challenges.\n\n197\n00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.620\nSo here we've got some well,\nmeasurement principles as we call it,\n\n198\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.900\nto help us measure our service strategy.\n\n199\n00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.830\nAnd I just want to quickly look at these\nprinciples on the left hand side here.\n\n200\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.390\nBegin on the outside, not on\nthe inside of the service organization.\n\n201\n00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.290\nThis is about that outward focus.\n\n202\n00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.370\nThis is about the fact that we're\ndelivering value to the organization.\n\n203\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:28.820\nWe're not delivering value for us,\nwe're delivering value for them.\n\n204\n00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:34.019\nSo we have to start with what they\nvalue and what their strategy is.\n\n205\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.610\nAnd that leads into the next principle,\n\n206\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.910\nwhich is responsiveness to customers,\nbeats all other measurement goals.\n\n207\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.370\nI have told you this in service design,\nwhen we've looked at service level\n\n208\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.000\nmanagement and I've told you this, earlier\nin episodes in service strategy and\n\n209\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.540\nI'll tell you this in service\noperation and in CSI, as well.\n\n210\n00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:58.620\nWhen I look at a slam chart, if it's all\ngreen, then you're measuring the wrong\n\n211\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.940\nthing because I will guarantee that\nI'll go and speak to a customer and\n\n212\n00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.490\nthey will turn around and\ntell me that they are not happy.\n\n213\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.610\nThis is not about achieving targets.\n\n214\n00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.790\nThis is about delivering satisfaction and\nvalue to our customers.\n\n215\n00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.410\nAnd a service review meeting should\nnever ever be an argument where we say,\n\n216\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.100\nwell look everything is all green.\n\n217\n00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.270\nWe've met all about targets and\nthe customer turns around and says,\n\n218\n00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:29.240\nbut what about that outage\nthat we had last week, right?\n\n219\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.090\nSo another principle that we have here,\nI'm thinking about processes and\n\n220\n00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.240\nour services as equals.\n\n221\n00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.780\nIt's really easy to concentrate on\nthe services and think, hey look,\n\n222\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:46.180\nwe gotta provide email, we gotta provide\nthe ability to send and receive email.\n\n223\n00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:52.400\nYes, we do but if incident management's\nnot working, then when e-mail falls over,\n\n224\n00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.390\nwhen e-mail dies, has interruption to\nservice, and it's not going to get fixed.\n\n225\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:03.690\nTo process is as just as important\nas the services that they support.\n\n226\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.359\nBecause without the processes,\nwe don't have a service.\n\n227\n00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.500\nNow numbers matter, be really,\nreally careful with this,\n\n228\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.550\nbecause numbers do matter.\n\n229\n00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:22.510\nBut if we concentrate purely on\nthe numbers, then what we try and\n\n230\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.130\ndo is we try and perform just\nto make the numbers look good.\n\n231\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.300\nIn other words,\nwe forget about satisfaction and\n\n232\n00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.760\nwe think just about the targets.\n\n233\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.820\nAnd all we want to do is see\nthose green targets, and\n\n234\n00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.980\nwe forget about the satisfaction\nside of things.\n\n235\n00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.779\nI will tell you that it would be best\npractice to incorporate in your service\n\n236\n00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:46.437\nlevel agreements, a service level\ntarget for customer satisfaction.\n\n237\n00:15:46.437 --> 00:15:51.796\nBecause that way that gives you not\njust the view of how you're components\n\n238\n00:15:51.796 --> 00:15:56.896\nare performing, but it also gives you\na view on how your customers feel\n\n239\n00:15:56.896 --> 00:16:01.965\nabout your components performing And\n\n240\n00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:06.700\ndon't forget, we all work together, and\nwhere it says compete as an organization,\n\n241\n00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.380\nwe're a service provider,\nokay, and we provide services.\n\n242\n00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.280\nAnd we're all on part of the same team,\nokay, we've all got different roles and\n\n243\n00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.780\nresponsibilities, but\nwe all work together.\n\n244\n00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.990\nAnd without that teamwork, well,\nwe're not going to deliver a service.\n\n245\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.570\nThis is not a case of the email service\n\n246\n00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.610\ncompeting against the incident\nmanagement process.\n\n247\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:33.070\nThis is a case of us all working together\nto be able to deliver a service.\n\n248\n00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.830\nAnd I know that it sounds as\nthough we're in some sort of\n\n249\n00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.700\nmotivational exercise right now,\nand we're not.\n\n250\n00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.740\nBut we need to deliver\nvalue to the customer.\n\n251\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:49.690\nAnd if there's absolute chaos going on in\nIT, then we're not going to deliver value.\n\n252\n00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.170\nRemember the definition\nof service management.\n\n253\n00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.880\nService management is a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities for\n\n254\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.480\ndelivering value to customers in\nthe form of goods or services.\n\n255\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.930\nIn other words,\nit's about specialist skills, but\n\n256\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.540\nit's about us being capable and\nabout us being organized.\n\n257\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.030\nIf there is absolute chaos and\n\n258\n00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.900\nrivalry going on in the background,\nthen we are not going to deliver value.\n\n259\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.510\nSo what about risks then?\n\n260\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.406\nIf we've got service strategy in place,\n\n261\n00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:24.217\nwhat could cause service strategy\nto fail or to falter or to stumble?\n\n262\n00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:27.420\nWell, knowledge management\nplays a part in this.\n\n263\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.530\nAnd it's about having the right\ninformation, relevant information,\n\n264\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.853\navailable at the right time to enable\nus to make informed decisions, okay?\n\n265\n00:17:35.853 --> 00:17:40.816\nDecisions are based on, decisions\nthat are things like a business case,\n\n266\n00:17:40.816 --> 00:17:45.430\nwhether to approve or not,\nthey're based on information.\n\n267\n00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.600\nSo our information has to be accurate, and\n\n268\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.240\nknowledge management is\ngoing to help us with that.\n\n269\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.460\nBe careful of this next one,\nwhich is the risk of taking or\n\n270\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.390\nfailing to take opportunities.\n\n271\n00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.970\nRemember we are aligned to\nthe organization's strategy.\n\n272\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:09.100\nAnd if the organization's strategy\nis to run the business, yes,\n\n273\n00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.450\nwe're gonna have to have change.\n\n274\n00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.750\nBut no, we don't need to\nbe innovative all the time.\n\n275\n00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:23.760\nWe are here to support their strategy,\nthat's what we're here to do.\n\n276\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.570\nWe're not here to hinder their strategy.\n\n277\n00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.840\nSo if their strategy is to grow the\nbusiness, then we should support that and\n\n278\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.250\nwe should facilitate that.\n\n279\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.630\nBut if their strategy\nis to run the business,\n\n280\n00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.750\nthen we should not be trying to grow.\n\n281\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.350\nBe careful about design and\noperating risks.\n\n282\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:45.390\nAnd design risks, operating risks,\njust make sure that we deliver in value.\n\n283\n00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.860\nThat we're not designing\nwhat we want to design, and\n\n284\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.930\nwe are not operating how\nwe think we should operate.\n\n285\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.780\nThis is about understanding\nwhat the organization wants and\n\n286\n00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.610\nbeing aligned to the organization.\n\n287\n00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:06.946\nRemember, and I've said this in previous\nsessions, your organization has a choice.\n\n288\n00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:11.355\nThey have a choice whether to use you or\nwhether to use an external or\n\n289\n00:19:11.355 --> 00:19:13.580\nan alternate service provider.\n\n290\n00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:20.290\nWhat you have to do is ensure that\nyour strategy aligns with their needs.\n\n291\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:25.730\nSo that you have that unique selling\npoint to your organization that\n\n292\n00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:33.550\nthey are able to identify that you meet\ntheir needs better than anybody else.\n\n293\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.760\nWe have to have the right\npeople with the right amount of\n\n294\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.230\nskills within service\nstrategy to be able to align\n\n295\n00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.650\nour strategic direction with\nthe organization's strategic direction.\n\n296\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.430\nAnd we have to have the right amount\nof support from senior management\n\n297\n00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.940\nto allow us to undertake strategy tasks.\n\n298\n00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.790\nSuch as coming up with the new ideas for\nnew services.\n\n299\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.640\nUndertaking business\nrelationship management,\n\n300\n00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.800\nvaluing that relationship\nwith the business.\n\n301\n00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.980\nAnd making sure that we are continually\naligned to the needs of the business.\n\n302\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:17.560\nAnd we keep our tools up to date,\nsuch as our service catalog.\n\n303\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.440\nI don't know about you, but when I log\nonto a catalog and I'm looking for\n\n304\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.003\nsomething online, because we do\neverything online nowadays, and\n\n305\n00:20:27.003 --> 00:20:29.501\nI'm looking for something online.\n\n306\n00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:33.590\nIf the provider's website that\nI log onto isn't working,\n\n307\n00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.110\nI'm gonna go somewhere else,\nI'm not gonna give it another go.\n\n308\n00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.830\nIf I log onto a particular website and I\nget an error message, or that page is slow\n\n309\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.240\nin loading, I'm not gonna give it\nanother go, I'm an impatient person.\n\n310\n00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.670\nI'm gonna go somewhere else,\nand I'm gonna try and\n\n311\n00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.830\nfind the same thing somewhere else.\n\n312\n00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.220\nYour customers have that\nsame level of expectation.\n\n313\n00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.010\nAnd I wonder how many times\nI've heard end users and\n\n314\n00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.760\ncustomers within a business sit\ndown in front of their screens and\n\n315\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.310\nsay, well I can do a lot more\nat home than I can do here.\n\n316\n00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.449\nYou know what that tells me?\n\n317\n00:21:11.449 --> 00:21:15.560\nThat our strategy's not aligned\nwith the needs of the business.\n\n318\n00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.690\nBecause quite simply, we aren't providing\nthe technology we want to provide, and\n\n319\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.755\nwhen we're not providing\nthe technology that they need to see.\n\n320\n00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.896\nAnd if you're hearing that, and\n\n321\n00:21:25.896 --> 00:21:29.120\nthe person that listens to that is\nbusiness relationship management, and if\n\n322\n00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.290\nyou're hearing that in your organization,\nthen it's time to rethink your strategy.\n\n323\n00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.170\nBecause your organization is probably\n\n324\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.310\nalready rethinking the value\nthat you provide to them.\n\n325\n00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.710\nWe might think of strategy as\nbeing an afterthought, and\n\n326\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.180\nI'm sure that we sometimes do.\n\n327\n00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.930\nBut to be perfectly honest,\nwithout service strategy,\n\n328\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.630\nthen IT ends up doing what IT wants to do.\n\n329\n00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:58.770\nAnd that's when we lose sight\nof the organization, and\n\n330\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.430\nthat's when we lose that synergy\nthat we have with our organization.\n\n331\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.240\nAnd we don't want to do that,\n\n332\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.840\nultimately what we want to do is to\ndeliver value to the organization.\n\n333\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.640\nSo right now, you have some\nexercises that you need to do.\n\n334\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.810\nYou've probably got about an hour's\nworth of exercises to do, that looks at\n\n335\n00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:24.025\nthe structures and organizational\nstructures of service management.\n\n336\n00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:28.415\nThat looks at automation, and\nit looks at the challenges and\n\n337\n00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:31.805\ncritical success factors\nof service strategy.\n\n338\n00:22:31.805 --> 00:22:35.785\nSo I'd like you to go away and\ndo those exercises.\n\n339\n00:22:35.785 --> 00:22:39.285\nThey will take you probably about\nan hour to an hour and a half.\n\n340\n00:22:39.285 --> 00:22:45.020\nAnd feel free, if you have any questions\nor any queries, to join us in the forum,\n\n341\n00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.150\nand we'll be happy to help with\nany questions that you may have.\n\n342\n00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.840\nOnce you've completed that exercise,\nthen what I would like you to do\n\n343\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.970\nis take a look at our\nsession on exam preparation.\n\n344\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:03.450\nAnd I would like you to undertake sample\npaper one, which is in your materials.\n\n345\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.470\nAnd then come back and join me for\n\n346\n00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:10.440\nour review session as we go over\nthe sample paper one test paper.\n\n347\n00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.090\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, thank you again for\nhelping us out here and\n\n348\n00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.620\ntalking about the ideas of automation and\nthe challenges that are there.\n\n349\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.610\nAs well as the critical\nsuccess factors and\n\n350\n00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.875\neven the risks that we need to understand\nas we continue to move forward.\n\n351\n00:23:24.875 --> 00:23:28.065\nRemember that if you're watching this\nin the sequence of the entire show\n\n352\n00:23:28.065 --> 00:23:31.255\nthat you've been watching, this is also\nthe point for you to go through and\n\n353\n00:23:31.255 --> 00:23:33.325\nmake sure you do that sample

00:00:48.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, now again,\nwhat I said is true, right?\n\n14\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.560\nThe very fact is that\nthey've gotten to this point,\n\n15\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.630\nthey now need to really\nfocus in on the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.720\nLearning the material of course is\nforemost and key but getting ready for\n\n17\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.860\nthe exam is a big part of this as well.\n\n18\n00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.430\nSo where are we gonna begin?\n\n19\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.060\n&gt;&gt; So, yes, you're right,\nwe've completed a class.\n\n20\n00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:10.000\nCongratulations everybody, you've put\nin the prerequisite 21 hours worth of\n\n21\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000\ncontact time as we say in the course\nsyllabus with both me and\n\n22\n00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.970\na predated instructor and also by going to\n\n23\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.790\nthe materials that you have been given and\nprovided with your course materials.\n\n24\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.910\nSo now it's time for the exam.\n\n25\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.180\nAnd I know, Ronnie, that's a dreaded\nword for some people, right?\n\n26\n00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But don't worry.\n\n27\n00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.090\nI'm here to guide you through it.\n\n28\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.870\nI can't promise that I'm gonna give you\na pass on this, but I'll tell you what.\n\n29\n00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.250\nIf you listen to everything that I say,\nand if you follow all the instructions and\n\n30\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.950\nmake sure that you read the question,\nthen you should find it really,\n\n31\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.020\nreally straight forward.\n\n32\n00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.460\nSo please don't worry,\nnow's the time that actually to relax,\n\n33\n00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.230\nbecause you've done all your learning,\nokay.\n\n34\n00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.900\nSo the first thing that\nI want you to do is,\n\n35\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.250\nI want you to go away and\nto ensure that you have downloaded\n\n36\n00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.930\nthe sample papers that were given to\nyou as part of the course materials.\n\n37\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.830\nNow, if you didn't receive them as\npart of the course materials or\n\n38\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.210\nyou feel that you might want to\ncheck out the AXELOS website,\n\n39\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.025\nwhich obviously Axelos\nare the people that own ITIL now.\n\n40\n00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:23.825\nThen please feel free to go to\ntheir website at www.axelos.org.\n\n41\n00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:27.825\nAnd if you type in the search\nthere ITIL Intermediate.\n\n42\n00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:31.719\nAnd you can download a sample\npaper from that website.\n\n43\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.710\nSo what are going to do over the next\nfew moments is I'm gonna take you to\n\n44\n00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.680\nsome exam technique.\n\n45\n00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.390\nAnd then I'going to ask you to go way and\nattempt sample paper one.\n\n46\n00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.935\nOnce you've completed sample paper one.\n\n47\n00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:47.440\nI'm gonna go over it with you.\n\n48\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.700\nAnd I'm gonna make sure that you have\npicked out all the salient points and all\n\n49\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.880\nof the relevant point and everything that\nyou need in order to get the right answer.\n\n50\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.250\nYeah, talking about the right answer,\ntake a look at this slide, okay.\n\n51\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.820\nThere is no right answer,\nthere is no wrong answer,\n\n52\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.260\nwhat you've got is a best fit answer.\n\n53\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.030\nNow I know that way, way back at\nthe introduction to our class, I very,\n\n54\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.535\nvery briefly mentioned\nthe exam at the end of this.\n\n55\n00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:18.550\nOkay.\nAnd\n\n56\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.120\nI said to you that it was complex\nmultiple choice exam, and they looked at,\n\n57\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.370\nI think the word that we used at the very\nstart of the class is most correct?\n\n58\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.465\nAnd I used the words best fit,\nand that's what I like to use.\n\n59\n00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:34.880\nOkay.\nThe best fit answer is five points.\n\n60\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.090\nYour second best answer is three points.\n\n61\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.560\nAnd your first, your third best\nanswer will give you one point.\n\n62\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.560\nAnd then we've got this\ndistractor that I mentioned.\n\n63\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.960\nAnd boy, is that there to distract.\n\n64\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.400\nThe distractor will quite often\nuse some nice, pretty words,\n\n65\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.450\nthe words that you find in\nyour ITIL publications.\n\n66\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.320\nAnd you think gee, no, that sounds great.\n\n67\n00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.930\nCuz it's mentioned all of these processes\nand it's mentioned all of these functions\n\n68\n00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.370\nand its mentioned all of these activities,\nthat's got to be the right answer, right?\n\n69\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.800\nNo, because the right answer,\nthe best fit answer is got to be\n\n70\n00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.120\ncompletely relevant to the scenario,\ncompletely relevant.\n\n71\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.180\nSo sometimes the best fit\nanswer doesn't actually\n\n72\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.560\nuse any of the ITIL wording at all so\nbe careful.\n\n73\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.710\nThat distractor is called\nthe distractor for a reason, right?\n\n74\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.560\nSo the exam.\n\n75\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.620\nLet me you a little bit about it then.\n\n76\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.300\nYou get 90 minutes.\n\n77\n00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.830\nThat's an hour and\na half you get to complete this exam, and\n\n78\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.320\nyou will be given eight\nmultiple choice questions.\n\n79\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.970\nSo you get two booklets.\n\n80\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.410\nOkay, you get a scenario booklet and\nyou get a question booklet.\n\n81\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.490\nNow, be very, very careful, okay.\n\n82\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.290\nThe Scenario Booklet as it says there,\nsets the scene and\n\n83\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.510\nthe Question Booklet asks the question,\nokay.\n\n84\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.610\nFairly straightforward, not really.\n\n85\n00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:58.905\nFirst thing that I want you to check\nwhen you see your question booklet.\n\n86\n00:04:58.905 --> 00:05:01.825\nIs it the top of every single question.\n\n87\n00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:03.445\nAnd boy, is this important.\n\n88\n00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:04.955\nDon't forget this.\n\n89\n00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:11.035\nAt the top of every single question\nit says, refer to scenario X.\n\n90\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.590\nSometimes, not all the time, not in\nevery paper, and in fact it's a rarity\n\n91\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.760\nI'll admit, but sometimes you've\ngot one scenario for two questions.\n\n92\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.670\nIn other words two questions\nrefer to just that one scenario.\n\n93\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.910\nBest way to ascertain whether that's\nthe case in your particular exam\n\n94\n00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.370\nis scroll through to the end\nof the scenario booklet.\n\n95\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.740\nLook at the end of the scenario booklet.\n\n96\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.670\nSee how many you've got.\n\n97\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.740\nIf you're running on seven,\nthen that means that somewhere\n\n98\n00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.800\nin your question booklet,\nyou've got two questions for one scenario.\n\n99\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.300\nThis is not the norm,\nit's not in every single paper, but\n\n100\n00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.160\nit's one definitely\nworth watching out for.\n\n101\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.810\nOkay, so always look at them.\n\n102\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.480\nRight at the very, very top, take a look,\nsee what scenario it refers to.\n\n103\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.930\nYou've gotta get a total of 28 points out\n\n104\n00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.750\nof 40 in order to pass the ITIL\nIntermediate, the lifecycle phase.\n\n105\n00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.280\nOkay?\n\n106\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.960\nSo think about this, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.020\nYou can't get all threes,\nall right, that's not going to work.\n\n108\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.840\nYou have to get some five pointers, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.610\nObviously what I'd like you to do is\nto get all five pointers, okay, and\n\n110\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.750\n40 out of 40 by the way is not impossible.\n\n111\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.660\nIt really, really isn't impossible and\n\n112\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.930\nI have quite a few the delegates [LAUGH]\nthat do actually achieve that, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.160\nSo, what am I gonna ask you to do\nthen when it comes to this test?\n\n114\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.125\nWell, I've got an acronym for\nyou and it's not one, I guess,\n\n115\n00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.765\nI'm supposed to give you but\nI'm gonna give you anyway.\n\n116\n00:06:45.765 --> 00:06:49.476\nRTFQ.\n\n117\n00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:50.869\nRTFQ.\n\n118\n00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.076\nRonnie, do you have any\nidea what that means?\n\n119\n00:06:53.076 --> 00:06:53.764\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't.\n\n120\n00:06:53.764 --> 00:06:54.884\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n121\n00:06:54.884 --> 00:06:57.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm pleased [LAUGH].\n\n122\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:05.440\nIt means, read the full question,\n&gt;&gt; Read the full question.\n\n123\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.890\nReally, really, really important.\n\n124\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.360\nThere is not one word in that\nquestion that is not relevant.\n\n125\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.940\nEvery single word is completely relevant.\n\n126\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.640\nIf you try and skim read, bear it in\nmind that this test is not a race, okay.\n\n127\n00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.740\nYou're not gonna get any points for\nfinishing in 20 minutes, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.140\nYou're not gonna get any prices for\nthat and nobody is gonna recognize you for\n\n129\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.560\nbeing the fastest person\never to finish an ITIL test.\n\n130\n00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.960\nSo please don't try it, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.880\nIt's not gonna get you anything\nadditional over your school.\n\n132\n00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.130\nRead the full question, take the time to\nread the full question, read every single\n\n133\n00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.110\nword, and that applies to the scenario\nas well, read the scenario.\n\n134\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.890\nYou're looking for keywords, but you're\nalso looking for small words as well,\n\n135\n00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.289\nwords like, all and words like,\nmight and could, and should, and must.\n\n136\n00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.040\nPlease, please,\n\n137\n00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.060\nplease pick out those words cuz they\nare incredibly important, okay?\n\n138\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.980\nFirst thing that I want you\nto do is read the question.\n\n139\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.700\nThe question can generally be very,\nvery small and\n\n140\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.940\nsometimes that question can simply turn\naround and say, so given the scenario what\n\n141\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.840\ndo you think is the best answer to resolve\nthe issues mentioned in the scenario?\n\n142\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.170\nWhat our question tells\nyou absolutely nothing.\n\n143\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.784\nSo you have to go then back\nto the scenario, okay.\n\n144\n00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:33.035\nAnd the example that you've given\non there is you've been asked\n\n145\n00:08:33.035 --> 00:08:38.450\nby the CIO to identify the next steps\nto address the identified issues.\n\n146\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.919\nWell, guess what?\n\n147\n00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.151\nIf you've been asked for\nthe next steps and\n\n148\n00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:45.623\nthis is why I say read the full\nquestion cuz if you've been asked for\n\n149\n00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:49.840\nthe next steps, don't you dare select\nthe answer that goes over everything that\n\n150\n00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.420\nyou've already covered cuz they\nare asking you for the next steps.\n\n151\n00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.176\nAnd also I mention that's been highlight\ntoday again about addressing the issues\n\n152\n00:08:57.176 --> 00:08:59.526\nmentioned either in the question or\nthe scenario.\n\n153\n00:08:59.526 --> 00:09:03.440\nIf you answer those and\naddress the issue, i.e., relevance.\n\n154\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.910\nIf it's not relevant then again, you're\nnot gonna be on to that five point answer.\n\n155\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.390\nSo read the full question.\n\n156\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.390\nBe very, very careful, okay?\n\n157\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.080\nIt says that if you read the scenario,\nhighlight, underline or\n\n158\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.710\nwrite down the specific issues.\n\n159\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.790\nWell, you can only do that if you've\ngot a paper exam in front of you.\n\n160\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.320\nYou cannot do that when you are online and\ndoing a virtual test.\n\n161\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.430\nYou will be allowed in your virtual test\nto have a piece of blank paper with you.\n\n162\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.000\nWhat I would recommend, and\nI was just thinking if I had one here.\n\n163\n00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.440\nAnd I don't unfortunately,\nwhat I would recommend for\n\n164\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:50.770\nyou is to actually take one piece of\nblank paper and fold it into quarters,\n\n165\n00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.560\nby doing that you've divided up\nthe front page into four sections and\n\n166\n00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.590\nyou've divided up the back\npage into four sections too.\n\n167\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.329\nYou'll be allowed to have that piece\nof paper and a pencil with you.\n\n168\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:08.540\nIn every single quarter I would write down\nthe notes for each particular question.\n\n169\n00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.690\nWhat that allows you to do is actually\nkeep your questions separate,\n\n170\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.500\nwhich is a huge start.\n\n171\n00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.610\nIf you just start writing down random\nwords on a piece of paper you'll not\n\n172\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.180\nreally know what question it refers to.\n\n173\n00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.730\nAnd if you have to go back to a question\nthen you will really be in trouble, okay.\n\n174\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.480\nSo take that piece of paper and literally\njust fold it into four and then as you\n\n175\n00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.780\nunfold it you have now got dividers, four\non each side and use one quarter for each\n\n176\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.190\nquestion and then write down the specific\nwords you want to highlight, okay.\n\n177\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.410\nSo the third bullet point up there\ntalks about sticking to the facts, and\n\n178\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:49.390\nwhat I will say to you is, don't assume,\nplease don't assume, stick to what's\n\n179\n00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.200\nin front of you, read the full question,\nand don't read in between the lines.\n\n180\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.590\nThere is nothing written there, so don't\nread in between the lines, don't assume\n\n181\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:04.570\nanything, if it's not down in black and\nwhite, then it simply doesn't exist.\n\n182\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.370\nNow you've completed your class.\n\n183\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.690\nNow's the time when you follow this\nlink and you download your exam voucher.\n\n184\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.444\nWhat will happen is you'll\nbe given this voucher and\n\n185\n00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:23.462\nyou will also be given an instruction\nbooklet or an instruction email rather,\n\n186\n00:11:23.462 --> 00:11:27.491\nand you will be asked to go to\nthe website at peoplecert.org and\n\n187\n00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:31.773\nyou will be asked to register as\na kind if haven't already done so.\n\n188\n00:11:31.773 --> 00:11:35.903\nYou may already have a candidate login and\n\n189\n00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:43.000\nthen you select the option to register for\nan exam using a exam voucher.\n\n190\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.930\nLet me repeat that again, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:51.690\nYou'll be asked to register for an exam\nusing an examination voucher, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.566\nAnd then the voucher number that you've\nbeen given in your email from PassionIT\n\n193\n00:11:56.566 --> 00:12:00.020\nis the voucher number that you will use.\n\n194\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.290\nOnce you've input that it's gonna\nask you for an appropriate date and\n\n195\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.480\ntime to sit your test.\n\n196\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.060\nYou can do whatever time you like, and so\n\n197\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.540\npick something that's appropriate for\nyou, okay?\n\n198\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.000\nSomething that you can work with.\n\n199\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.540\nThere are a few things that I wanna\ntell you about this online exam as well.\n\n200\n00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.170\nOkay?\n\n201\n00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.780\nAnd the first thing is,\nplease make sure you can't be interrupted.\n\n202\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.570\nYou need to be in a room\nwhere it's only you and\n\n203\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.680\npreferably where the door is closed.\n\n204\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.790\nYou will need to be using a laptop or\na tablet with a camera.\n\n205\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.280\nIf your laptop, or your tablet, or\nyour desktop does not have a camera,\n\n206\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.860\nthen you won't be able to sit your test.\n\n207\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.210\nBecause you will be watched, by a proctor,\nthroughout your entire test.\n\n208\n00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.813\nYou can't use more than one screen,\nyou can only use one screen, okay, and\n\n209\n00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:57.040\nyou cannot at any point in time, have\nany other devices on your desk either.\n\n210\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.155\nSo nothing that can connect\nto the internet, okay.\n\n211\n00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.980\nYou will be ask,\nwhen you register for your test for\n\n212\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:11.430\nabout an hour before you're test is due to\ndownload some exam guard software, okay.\n\n213\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.100\nAnd what that does is that allows\nthe proctor to remotely watch what\n\n214\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.640\nyou are doing on your laptop or\non your PC or on your device and\n\n215\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.280\nit make sure that you're not on\nthe internet googling the answer, okay?\n\n216\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.320\nSo we started our exam,\nwe've downloaded all the software.\n\n217\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.250\nAnd by the way, when I mentioned that,\nif you're using a work PC you better make\n\n218\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.770\nsure you have the permissions in order\nto be able to download that software.\n\n219\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.755\nIf the software's not on your PC then\nyou won't be able to sit the test.\n\n220\n00:13:37.755 --> 00:13:39.190\nOkay?\n\n221\n00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:44.120\nSo then the proctor will come online and\nthey will ask you if you're all ready and\n\n222\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.190\nthey'll tell you that you can have\na piece of paper and a pen and\n\n223\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.960\nthen they will ask to\nsee around your room.\n\n224\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.540\nSo you must be in a position where you\ncan physically pick up your laptop and\n\n225\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.700\nturn it around so\nthat the proctor can view the room.\n\n226\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.980\nThat's to make sure that you don't\nhave any ITIL books with you.\n\n227\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.902\nThat you don't have anybody like me hiding\nin a corner or hiding under your desk\n\n228\n00:14:07.902 --> 00:14:12.750\nhelping you out, and it's also to make\nsure that you are completely alone and\n\n229\n00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.124\ncan't be interrupted during\nthat particular test.\n\n230\n00:14:16.124 --> 00:14:22.160\nAt that point in time the examiner\nwill ask you to start your test.\n\n231\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.940\nYou'll get 90 minutes.\n\n232\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.520\nAnd to be perfectly on this 90 minutes.\n\n233\n00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.704\nSo when I was on the office pretty\ncomfortable at the end of your test\n\n234\n00:14:31.158 --> 00:14:34.160\nOne thing I will tell you,\nplease don't change your answers.\n\n235\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.780\nGo with your gut instinct\nthat's generally right.\n\n236\n00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.160\nAnd to be perfectly honest\nin about 75% of cases\n\n237\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.930\nthe person that changes their answer\nchanges it to the wrong one, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.390\nYou wanna aim for\nabout 10 minutes per question.\n\n239\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.780\nThe average is 11 minutes per question,\nbut aim for 10 and\n\n240\n00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.160\nthen you'll feel completely\ncomfortable with the timings.\n\n241\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.460\nAt the end of your test,\nyou will be asked to submit.\n\n242\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.890\nAnd when you're finished,\nthen you click Submit.\n\n243\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.790\nAt that point in time your\nscreen will disappear.\n\n244\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.290\nYou will be given an intermediate, I don't\n\n245\n00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.510\nlike to use that word actually when\nwe're talking about ITIL Intermediate.\n\n246\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.010\nYou'll be given an interim\nresult there and then.\n\n247\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.918\nThat interim result will tell you very\nsimply whether you've passed or failed.\n\n248\n00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.740\nYou're not gonna be able to get anything\nmore than that out of it, okay.\n\n249\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.210\nThat's all you're going to\nget is just a pass or fail.\n\n250\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:29.420\nBecause it has to be independently audited\nbefore they can release the result to you.\n\n251\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.180\nSo you'll get your interim\nresult immediately.\n\n252\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.040\nAnd then you'll get your real result\nwith your score within a week.\n\n253\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.480\nOkay.\n\n254\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.450\nI wanna just draw your attention\nto that bottom bullet point there\n\n255\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.620\njust before we move on.\n\n256\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.260\nIf you're struggling with a question,\nmove on, come back to it.\n\n257\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.140\nAnd just remember, that if you don't\nanswer a question because you think it's\n\n258\n00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.110\ntoo difficult,\nthen you're gonna get zero points.\n\n259\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.519\nYou've got a 25% chance of\ngetting a five pointer and\n\n260\n00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:59.968\nyou've got a 50% chance of\neither getting five or three.\n\n261\n00:15:59.968 --> 00:16:04.860\nSo please answer it, okay, don't just\nleave it blank, always answer a question.\n\n262\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:11.370\nRight, I think I've probably given\nyou enough exam tips for now.\n\n263\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.205\nNow it's your turn.\n\n264\n00:16:12.205 --> 00:16:13.290\nOkay.\n\n265\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.040\nWhat I want you to do now\nis I want you to go and\n\n266\n00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.440\nI want you to download Sample Paper 1.\n\n267\n00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.670\nAnd then I want you to do Sample Paper 1,\n\n268\n00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.620\nincluding the scenario booklet,\nand the question booklet.\n\n269\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.600\nI want you to do that now.\n\n270\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.620\nAnd then we're gonna come back and we're\ngonna go through that question booklet.\n\n271\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.790\nNow, you noticed that with this\nparticular booklet with sample paper 1,\n\n272\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.650\nyou've got answers and\nyou've got rationale.\n\n273\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.250\nIn other words, that's the reason\nwhy that's the five pointer,\n\n274\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.720\nthe reason why this one\nis the three pointer.\n\n275\n00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.330\nOkay.\n\n276\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:51.650\nBut, for the monument what I want us to\ndo is I want us to come back when you\n\n277\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:57.600\nfinish that exam, I want us to come back\nand I want us to go through that test.\n\n278\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.790\nAnd then you see how you did.\n\n279\n00:17:00.790 -->

paper.\n\n283\n00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.750\nRemember, read the full question,\nread the full scenario.\n\n284\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:25.300\nEvery word counts, check for\nrelevance and don't make assumptions.\n\n285\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.809\nAnd I'll see you when\nyou finish your test.\n\n286\n00:17:28.858 --> 00:17:29.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo,\n\n287\n00:17:29.480 -->

strategy.\n\n3\n00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.711\nAnd in this particular\nepisode we are going to\n\n4\n00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:16.582\ngo over the first part\nof the sample paper.\n\n5\n00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:19.603\nAnd then in our next episode,\nwe'll go over part two,\n\n6\n00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:22.110\nthe next four questions\nto the sample paper.\n\n7\n00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.446\nAs you already know, we have and\n\n8\n00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:29.651\nhopefully you've read the exam\npreparation before you did your test.\n\n9\n00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:34.618\nAnd we have a five pointer for\nour best fit answer, a three pointer for\n\n10\n00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:39.330\nour second best answer, a one pointer for\nthe next best answer and\n\n11\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.730\nzero for your destructor\nwhich is there to distract.\n\n12\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.570\nNow be very careful because the answer or\nthe question rather is always looking for\n\n13\n00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.770\nthe best fit answer.\n\n14\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.960\nIt's not looking for\nthe 100% correct answer, necessarily.\n\n15\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.540\nIt's looking for\nthe best fit given the scenario.\n\n16\n00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.170\nSo you're looking how\nbest to fit in the ideal\n\n17\n00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.430\npractices that we've learned for\nthis given scenario.\n\n18\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.670\nSo always think about\nrelevance to the scenario.\n\n19\n00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.670\nSo let's take a look then\nat question number 1.\n\n20\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.520\nAnd question number 1,\nvery simple question.\n\n21\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.530\nWhat's the best answer for the training\nprovided to take in this scenario?\n\n22\n00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.868\nOkay, we'll,\nlets take a look at the scenario then.\n\n23\n00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:26.800\nSo we've got a large training provider and\nthey've got a training center with 20\n\n24\n00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.390\nclassrooms with PCs and servers for\ndelivering technical training courses.\n\n25\n00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.140\nWe've also got an admin office and\nwe've got a wireless network serving\n\n26\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.410\nthe admin office which is\nabout two years old now.\n\n27\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.910\nThe wireless network can be\naccessed from the training area and\n\n28\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.200\nthey decided to allow students\nto access this as a value add.\n\n29\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.620\nAnd students appreciate this.\n\n30\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.890\nThink about at this point in time,\nI want you to think about value.\n\n31\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.540\nValue is perceived.\n\n32\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.344\nBut value is a mixture of outcomes, and\n\n33\n00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:04.289\naffordable outcomes,\nas well as preferences and perceptions.\n\n34\n00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.690\nOvertime, the usage of the network\nby both admin staff and\n\n35\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.880\nthe students has increased, which is\naffecting availability and performance and\n\n36\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.500\nit's necessary to restrict and\nprevent student access.\n\n37\n00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.240\nThe availability and performance issues\ncontinue to increase and now trainers and\n\n38\n00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.925\nthe staff are overwhelmed with complaints\nfrom students when the network's not\n\n39\n00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:26.870\navailable.\n\n40\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.774\nSo course evaluation forms,\n\n41\n00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:32.972\nwell, hey're showing dissatisfaction\nnow with the students.\n\n42\n00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:36.437\nAnd now they're gonna withdraw\nthe wireless network access from students\n\n43\n00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:38.645\ncompletely until they've\ndecided what to do.\n\n44\n00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:40.841\nAnd notice have been posted and\n\n45\n00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:46.280\nthey now must consider what further\naction should be taken, right.\n\n46\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.560\nOkay, so we've added value to\nthe students and to the courses and\n\n47\n00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.020\nnow we have to consider,\nwhat do we do next?\n\n48\n00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.919\nSo, let's take a look then at D which\nis our five pointer in the green.\n\n49\n00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.424\nAnd it says here, allowing students\nwireless access will increase\n\n50\n00:03:04.424 --> 00:03:08.620\nthe performance potential of this customer\nasset and add value to the students.\n\n51\n00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.797\nYou see, we've already given it to them so\nif we take it away or\n\n52\n00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:18.678\nif we have issues with the actual\nwireless access itself,\n\n53\n00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:21.681\nwell, the students are used to it.\n\n54\n00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:25.953\nAnd so you see, anything that\nwe do to take that away is now\n\n55\n00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:29.790\nconsidered to be\ndetrimental to the service.\n\n56\n00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.110\nSo we now have to ensure\nthat we maintain value.\n\n57\n00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.729\nAnd value is considered to be\nan affordable mix of features\n\n58\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.780\ncombined with preferences and perceptions.\n\n59\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.190\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngoing to look at the market spaces.\n\n60\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.900\nAnd we're going to look at here in\nstrategy, what types of customer we have.\n\n61\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.660\nAnd we've got two different\ntypes of customer and\n\n62\n00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.310\nthey both have different requirements.\n\n63\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.030\nSo what we really need to do is assess\n\n64\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.950\nwhich customer requires\nwhich level of service.\n\n65\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.070\nAnd that's exactly what we've got\nhere in our five pointer in D.\n\n66\n00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.560\nAnd assessments should be conducted\nto consider what capacity,\n\n67\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.640\nsecurity and availability resources\nare necessary to give student access.\n\n68\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.610\nAnd then we should submit proposals\nto implement the access and\n\n69\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.420\nthen relaunch this as\na formalized service.\n\n70\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.460\nThis is not just a nice to have,\nthis is a formalized service.\n\n71\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.170\nAnd then we market and we give training to\n\n72\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.830\npublicize the availability of this so\nthat we can set student expectations.\n\n73\n00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.200\nIt's always really important to set\nexpectations because this is where we set\n\n74\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.180\nour value perception\nbecause value is perceived.\n\n75\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.750\nIf you don't tell me that I'm going to\nget something and I get it, then I think,\n\n76\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.350\nthat's great.\n\n77\n00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.870\nIt's mine, that's perfect.\n\n78\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.650\nI've got access now and\nI begin to expect that.\n\n79\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.670\nAnd because nobody's told me anything\nelse, Well, now I expect it as the norm.\n\n80\n00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.707\nAnd then the minute that's\ntaken away from me, well,\n\n81\n00:05:02.707 --> 00:05:05.360\nI don't perceive I get as much value for\nmoney.\n\n82\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.973\nSo that's why this is my five pointer, cuz\nmy five pointer acknowledges the fact that\n\n83\n00:05:11.973 --> 00:05:17.009\nI have two different types of customer and\nthat this is an expected service now.\n\n84\n00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.709\nThis is not just a nice to have,\nthis is an expected service.\n\n85\n00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:22.750\nSo let's take a look at\nmy three pointer then.\n\n86\n00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.600\nThree pointer says that internet\naccess is clearly important.\n\n87\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.750\nYes, it is.\n\n88\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.800\nIf planned and implemented appropriately,\n\n89\n00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.520\nit could increase customer\nsatisfaction and retention.\n\n90\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.770\nNow, we've got to the point\nwhere it was already there.\n\n91\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.590\nSo, we've already had customer\nsatisfaction at a specific level.\n\n92\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.590\nSo if planned and\n\n93\n00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.320\nimplemented appropriately,\nit would increase customer satisfaction.\n\n94\n00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.276\nYes, that's very true had we\ndone that from the start.\n\n95\n00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:54.112\nBut we didn't,\nwe just allowed students to access it.\n\n96\n00:05:54.112 --> 00:05:58.970\nSo we already have customer\nsatisfaction at a specific level.\n\n97\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.000\nThe decision to terminate\nthis service was misguided.\n\n98\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.200\nThat's right.\n\n99\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.460\nAlthough it may have been best\nin that particular situation.\n\n100\n00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.160\nSo we can't say that it was necessarily\nmisguided but certainly it wasn't planned.\n\n101\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.070\nIt doesn't look as though\nany of this was planned.\n\n102\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.160\nAnd this is the problem that we have.\n\n103\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.220\nInternet access should be restored as\nsoon as possible but if we do that,\n\n104\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.470\nwe restore exactly the same problem.\n\n105\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.190\nTo manage demand and increase security,\n\n106\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.930\nan Internet cafe approach should should be\nadopted whereby students can use a small\n\n107\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.500\nnumber of dedicated desktop\nPC's in public areas.\n\n108\n00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.630\nThis is a degradation of the level of\nservice that they were increasing.\n\n109\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.037\nAnd whilst it gives them a service,\nit's less than what they had.\n\n110\n00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:50.697\nSo it's never going to restore customer\nsatisfaction to it's previous levels.\n\n111\n00:06:50.697 --> 00:06:53.540\nThis should restore satisfaction,\nit's not,\n\n112\n00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.798\nwe've already established that,\nat an acceptable and\n\n113\n00:06:56.798 --> 00:07:02.060\nquantifiable cost while allowing the\ncompany to focus on its core competency.\n\n114\n00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.660\nYeah, the problem that we've got there,\nis quite simply you and\n\n115\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.740\nI all know that we will choose\na specific service provider for\n\n116\n00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.990\nwhatever the service is based\non their ability to satisfy us.\n\n117\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.780\nAnd it doesn't matter what level of\nservice they have in their core service.\n\n118\n00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.300\nIf their customer service or\nif the added bonus or\n\n119\n00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.159\nthe added value is not there,\nthen we may choose somebody else.\n\n120\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.585\nNow, we pick our cell phone providers\nbased on not just their ability\n\n121\n00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:39.188\nto be able to provide us with\nthe regular service, but\n\n122\n00:07:39.188 --> 00:07:43.053\nalso on their ability to\nprovide us with added features.\n\n123\n00:07:43.053 --> 00:07:47.676\nWe've already given an added feature,\nif we take it away and then we say hey,\n\n124\n00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:52.514\nlook, this is an added feature and we're\nonly going to give you 50% of what you\n\n125\n00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.950\nhad before,\nthey're not gonna perceive value in that.\n\n126\n00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.873\nAnd then we turn around and say, but it's\nokay cuz we can still give you training.\n\n127\n00:07:59.873 --> 00:08:02.031\nNot a great solution.\n\n128\n00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:05.230\nLet's look at my one pointer then.\n\n129\n00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.310\nThe wireless network is a service asset.\n\n130\n00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.140\nNo.\n\n131\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.920\nWe use our service assets to create\na service which delivers value.\n\n132\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.870\nSo the wireless network\nis not a service asset.\n\n133\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.770\nWe use our assets to create\nthe wireless network and\n\n134\n00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.570\nto deliver the wireless network.\n\n135\n00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.910\nBecause our assets are not\njust our resources, but\n\n136\n00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.780\nthey're also our capabilities, too.\n\n137\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.530\nIt does allow the administrative team to\naccess internal services which should,\n\n138\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.920\nwell, should not have been made\navailable to the students.\n\n139\n00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.370\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n140\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.180\nIt already is available to the students.\n\n141\n00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.700\nThe services we require to deliver\ntraining, and it's outside of the core\n\n142\n00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.730\nbusiness of the training company, but\nagain, we've already delivered it.\n\n143\n00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.368\nThat may be a true statement but\nwe've already delivered the service.\n\n144\n00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:59.540\nMaking corporative IT services\navailable to students dilutes\n\n145\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.860\nthe strength of the company offering.\n\n146\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.770\nThat is the assumptions.\n\n147\n00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.768\nNothing in that scenario that says that.\n\n148\n00:09:06.768 --> 00:09:11.112\nSure it's having a detrimental\nimpact on the admin offices.\n\n149\n00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:16.083\nBut there's nothing in that scenario\nthat states that that is having\n\n150\n00:09:16.083 --> 00:09:20.890\na detrimental effect to the strength\nof the company's offering.\n\n151\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.970\nDoes it represent\na significant security risk?\n\n152\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.830\nPerhaps, but again there's nothing\nin the scenario that says that, so\n\n153\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.945\nthat is an assumption.\n\n154\n00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:35.530\nNotices should be published within\nthe classrooms to explain why it's not\n\n155\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.170\navailable in order to reduce the pressure\non training reception staff.\n\n156\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.103\nAnd set students'\nexpectations appropriately.\n\n157\n00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:46.399\nOkay, notices will do that.\n\n158\n00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.445\nBut it's not gonna make them happy, so\n\n159\n00:09:48.445 --> 00:09:51.670\nwe're not going to be\nperceived as delivering value.\n\n160\n00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.870\nSo that answer there, well,\nit's got a lot of assumptions in there and\n\n161\n00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:00.939\nit still doesn't get us back to the point\nof restoring value to the customers.\n\n162\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:08.600\nNow let's look at our one distractor,\nsorry, our zero pointer.\n\n163\n00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.720\nWhich is A) which is the wireless network\nshould be seen as a customer asset.\n\n164\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.820\nNo of course it's not a customer asset,\nit's ours, it's our service.\n\n165\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.740\nWhich is used to provide\nconnectivity to two market spaces,\n\n166\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.875\nthe admin team and the students.\n\n167\n00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:30.250\nOkay I'm happy with that, but\nI don't know what relevance it has.\n\n168\n00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.600\nDenying service to the students will\nimprove the service to the admin team.\n\n169\n00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.090\nIt will hopefully, but not necessarily so,\nbecause they've already denied.\n\n170\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.910\nIt says in the scenario that they\nhave already withdrawn the wireless\n\n171\n00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.849\nnetwork access from the students.\n\n172\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.350\nBut then do we know whether that's had\na detrimental affect to the admin team?\n\n173\n00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.480\nHm, well, let's carry on.\n\n174\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.930\nIt will have an impact on level\nof customer service faction with\n\n175\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.470\nthe training courses possibly\nresulting in lost revenue.\n\n176\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.360\nNow it's true to say it's gonna\nhave an impact on the level\n\n177\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.590\nof customer satisfaction.\n\n178\n00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:13.050\nIt already has, and that's in the scenario\npossibly resulting in lost revenue.\n\n179\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.720\nThat's an assumption, be careful.\n\n180\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.870\nThe minimum level of service\nshould be defined according to\n\n181\n00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.710\nthe external customer.\n\n182\n00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.240\nNo, it has to be agreed.\n\n183\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.680\nRemember our service level agreement.\n\n184\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.830\nIt has to be agreed with both.\n\n185\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.230\nThe network capacity should be\nupgraded immediately to allow for\n\n186\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.020\nuse by both students and staff.\n\n187\n00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.110\nTo what?\n\n188\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.930\nWe don't know what.\n\n189\n00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.760\nWe haven't done any assessment\non what's required.\n\n190\n00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.530\nSo we're just arbitrarily\ngoing to increase bandwidth?\n\n191\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.620\nAre we, to what?\n\n192\n00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.590\nWe need the assessment first of all.\n\n193\n00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.210\nThis will create time to plan for\n\n194\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.570\na more satisfactory solution\nin the next financial year.\n\n195\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:52.910\nOnly if it works.\n\n196\n00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.140\nWe don't know what we're\nincreasing the bandwidth to,\n\n197\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.630\nso we certainly don't know if it works or\nnot.\n\n198\n00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.680\nLet's take a look,\nlet's move on then to question number two.\n\n199\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:10.210\nAnd question number two,\nhere you are an ITSM consultant.\n\n200\n00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.900\nAnd I will always tell you to look\nat who you are in the scenario or\n\n201\n00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.970\nin the question.\n\n202\n00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.960\nYou're going to be told your role.\n\n203\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.259\nYou're going to be asked that advice and\n\n204\n00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:24.090\nyou are going to be given\na specific challenge to overcome.\n\n205\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.590\nSo you're a consultant and\n\n206\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.095\nyou've been brought in by the CIO to\nadvise what the next step should be.\n\n207\n00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:34.235\nSo it's a medium sized\ntransportation company.\n\n208\n00:12:34.235 --> 00:12:37.015\nThey've been implementing\nservice management processes for\n\n209\n00:12:37.015 --> 00:12:42.065\na few years, we don't know how\nlong that is, just a few years.\n\n210\n00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:45.075\nWe focus more on operational\nprocesses such as event and\n\n211\n00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:48.300\nincident request fulfillment and\naccess management.\n\n212\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.110\nManaging a problem there,\nof course you have to remember that we\n\n213\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.310\nhave five processes\nwithin service operation.\n\n214\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.540\nThey're documented and\nimplemented to some degree but\n\n215\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.020\nwe still struggle with managing and\nimproving.\n\n216\n00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.080\nSo, it's felt that the main reason for\n\n217\n00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.320\nthis is that the performance\nmeasurements are lacking.\n\n218\n00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.630\nSo, we are probably within a three or\na four on the CMMI scale.\n\n219\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.290\nThe implementation of the first\nprocesses was to undertake,\n\n220\n00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.580\nas a result of quality issues.\n\n221\n00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.160\nBut, no strategic considerations\nwere taken into account, and\n\n222\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.110\nthe CIO believes that\nthe implementation of these processes\n\n223\n00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.310\nhas not been consistent with\nthe business environments needs.\n\n224\n00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.320\nBut he's not been able to make\nthe case with specific evidence.\n\n225\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.440\nThe IT Unit now sees\nthe need to formalize and\n\n226\n00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.644\nimprove other processes such as portfolio\nand catalog and service level management.\n\n227\n00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:46.605\nBut the CIO is unsure if it's a good\nidea to start this before basic\n\n228\n00:13:46.605 --> 00:13:48.565\nperformance measurements are in place.\n\n229\n00:13:48.565 --> 00:13:51.455\nSince the business expects\nto understand the value and\n\n230\n00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:53.365\nhow it will support their needs.\n\n231\n00:13:54.525 --> 00:13:56.405\nWell, okay.\n\n232\n00:13:56.405 --> 00:13:57.395\nSo what do we do then?\n\n233\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.630\nLet's take a look at our options here.\n\n234\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.440\nLet's take a look at our five pointer.\n\n235\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.260\nSo our five pointer in\nthis case then is c, and\n\n236\n00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:11.720\nc tells us that every single\nmeasurement that we take is useful.\n\n237\n00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.290\nAnd it's relevant to the context\nin which value is created.\n\n238\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.800\nSo we've got that word value in there, and\nvalue obviously as we know is perceived.\n\n239\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.300\nAnd so we want to consider\nall of our measurements.\n\n240\n00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:30.260\nWe need to understand though how our\nservices effect business performance and\n\n241\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.220\nhow our services effect\nvalue to the organization.\n\n242\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.680\nAnd then we define what\nwe're going to measure.\n\n243\n00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.520\nAnd as it says there strong independence\nrelated to the needs of the customers and\n\n244\n00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.090\nthe users.\n\n245\n00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.870\nBecause value is perceived and\n\n246\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.270\nit's our job to align ourselves\nwith the needs of the organization.\n\n247\n00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:57.600\nIt's important to relate assets to\nservices and to the business processes.\n\n248\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.410\nIn other words what outcomes\nwe are facilitated to ensure,\n\n249\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.790\nwell, better control for our IT managers.\n\n250\n00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.070\nAnd there's our five pointer and\n\n251\n00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.490\nthat makes perfect sense because it\ntells us that everything's useful.\n\n252\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.260\nLet's look at D.\n\n253\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.330\nD talks about end to end measurements.\n\n254\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.050\nEnd to end measurements\nshould be established.\n\n255\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.870\nNow I quite like this and\nas you read through this answer.\n\n256\n00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.220\nAnd I'm not going to read it all,\n\n257\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.270\nI quite like the idea of\nthe end to end measurements.\n\n258\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:26.840\nThat's great.\n\n259\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.020\nAnd it goes on to say that end to end\nmeasurements provide a top level picture\n\n260\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.590\nof services and processes.\n\n261\n00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.640\nDon't forget out end to end metrics.\n\n262\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.610\nNow we came across them in foundation\nokay, in our CSI section of foundation.\n\n263\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.240\nWe measure three types of metrics.\n\n264\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.420\nWe have technical metrics and\nprocess metrics and\n\n265\n00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:52.706\ntechnical and process together\nboth make up service metrics.\n\n266\n00:15:52.706 --> 00:15:56.086\nSo it's not just how often\nsomething fails, but\n\n267\n00:15:56.086 --> 00:16:00.551\nalso how quickly we can restore it,\ni.e incident management.\n\n268\n00:16:00.551 --> 00:16:03.664\nAnd Both of those,\nthe component metric and\n\n269\n00:16:03.664 --> 00:16:08.640\nthe incident metric together,\nmake up the end to end service metric.\n\n270\n00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.490\nProblem with D, the big problem\nwith D is at no point in time\n\n271\n00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.060\ndo we go back to the business and\nask what they want us to measure.\n\n272\n00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.350\nWe should always go back to the business.\n\n273\n00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:29.740\nOur aim is to be aligned to\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n274\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.020\nAnd if we don't know what those needs are,\n\n275\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.780\nthen you're always going to be\nheading down the wrong path.\n\n276\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.440\nOur aim is to add value\nto the organization.\n\n277\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.770\nSo we need to know what\nthe organization require.\n\n278\n00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.200\nLet's take a look at our one-pointer then.\n\n279\n00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:53.393\nMeasurements of the basis of both\nservice and process improvements.\n\n280\n00:16:53.393 --> 00:16:55.690\nOkay, yes, that's very, very true.\n\n281\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.880\nThere's nothing that's untrue about that.\n\n282\n00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:03.860\nI'm struggling to see about the relevance,\nbut anyway, it's a true statement, okay.\n\n283\n00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.070\nTo ensure that our processes are effective\nin serving the needs of the business,\n\n284\n00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.490\neffective measurements\nshould be established.\n\n285\n00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.842\nOkay, based on what?\n\n286\n00:17:14.842 --> 00:17:20.262\nTo ensure that the IT staff understands\nthe measures and takes them seriously.\n\n287\n00:17:20.262 --> 00:17:25.050\nIs there anywhere in that scenario\nthat suggests that they're not, okay.\n\n288\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.680\nThey should be operationally oriented.\n\n289\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:34.280\nNo, we should be measuring what's\nimportant to the organization.\n\n290\n00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.450\nSo setting up monitoring and\nmeasurement of components and\n\n291\n00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.120\nthe processes such as incident and\nrequest.\n\n292\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.076\nWell, we have to understand what\nit is the business wants and\n\n293\n00:17:48.076 --> 00:17:52.073\nwhat the business wants\nto see in terms of value.\n\n294\n00:17:52.073 --> 00:17:56.818\nAnd we define measurements based on\nwhat we're delivering to the business,\n\n295\n00:17:56.818 --> 00:17:59.160\nin other words, the value.\n\n296\n00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.380\nAnd I see no measurement of value then til\nright at the very end where it says ie,\n\n297\n00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.340\nprocesses that are directly\nrelated to customer satisfaction.\n\n298\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.400\nBut what about the components?\n\n299\n00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.880\nThe components do have to deliver\na service to the organization,\n\n300\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.790\nand that service needs\nto facilitate outcomes.\n\n301\n00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.870\nSo we have to measure\nthe components as well, but\n\n302\n00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.190\nin a way that measures whether\nthey're facilitating those outcomes.\n\n303\n00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:32.607\nWe cannot take any metric\nwithout understanding the value\n\n304\n00:18:32.607 --> 00:18:34.489\nto the organization.\n\n305\n00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:37.830\nSo let's take a look at A then,\nand A is our distractor.\n\n306\n00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.130\nAnd A talks about moving\nforward with the design and\n\n307\n00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.060\nimplementation of the new\nprocesses as planned.\n\n308\n00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.640\nOkay, so we'll just forget about\nthe metrics then, shall we?\n\n309\n00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.960\nAll right, then, portfolio management\nshould be considered first.\n\n310\n00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.780\nAs it's the basis for\nservice catalog management and\n\n311\n00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.330\nservice level management, okay.\n\n312\n00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.910\nWell yeah,\ncuz you need to know what services you\n\n313\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.780\nare assigning service level agreements to,\nall right.\n\n314\n00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.720\nMeasurements are an important\nelement in service level management.\n\n315\n00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.700\nThe measurements for the existing\nprocess and service should not\n\n316\n00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.540\nbe established before service level\nmanagement has been implemented.\n\n317\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:19.970\nNo, because when we design any service,\nwe design the metrics for any service.\n\n318\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:25.738\nIt's part of the design of the service and\nthe design of any process too.\n\n319\n00:19:25.738 --> 00:19:28.580\nSo that should have been done\nwhen we designed the process.\n\n320\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.010\nAnd if we don't measure a process right\nnow, well we don't leave it until we put\n\n321\n00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:37.540\nservice level management in place,\nit's part of CSI for that process.\n\n322\n00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.032\nSo we should be designing metrics\nat this point in time and\n\n323\n00:19:41.032 --> 00:19:44.234\nsaying okay then,\nwell let's take some metrics and\n\n324\n00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:49.280\nwork out whether our processes are meeting\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n325\n00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.089\nAt no point in time does this\ngo back to the organization.\n\n326\n00:19:52.089 --> 00:19:56.600\nThis one here, particularly, well it\nignores the organization completely.\n\n327\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.470\nSo this is why C is our five pointer,\nC goes back to the business.\n\n328\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.120\nSo let's take a look then\nat our next question.\n\n329\n00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.130\nAnd our next question\nbeing question number 3.\n\n330\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.991\nSo we have a law firm here, and\n\n331\n00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:17.798\nthey provide legal services\nto large companies,\n\n332\n00:20:17.798 --> 00:20:21.688\nand this law firm's got a head office and\n\n333\n00:20:21.688 --> 00:20:25.936\nregional offices in six locations, okay.\n\n334\n00:20:25.936 --> 00:20:28.403\nThe IT group's based at head office and\n\n335\n00:20:28.403 --> 00:20:33.192\nsupports the main business application,\nwhich was developed in-house,\n\n336\n00:20:33.192 --> 00:20:38.240\nwhich supports case logging and\ntracking, CRM, and customer accounts.\n\n337\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.595\nIt's a strategic service,\nyou might think of it as a VBF,\n\n338\n00:20:41.595 --> 00:20:46.525\na vital business function, and\nit's a source of differentiation for\n\n339\n00:20:46.525 --> 00:20:50.125\nthe business, and the data,\nof course, is highly confidential.\n\n340\n00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:52.275\nSo it runs on servers at head office,\n\n341\n00:20:52.275 --> 00:20:55.326\nas well as being linked to\nthe service at other locations.\n\n342\n00:20:57.135 --> 00:21:02.035\nThe IT group, based at head office again,\nprovides desktop service support\n\n343\n00:21:02.035 --> 00:21:07.210\nusing technicians located at each site\nwho deal with incidents as they arise,\n\n344\n00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.590\nthis is what we call\nlocal service desk then.\n\n345\n00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.923\nThey deal with incidents as they arise,\nusing their local site knowledge and\n\n346\n00:21:13.923 --> 00:21:15.265\ntheir relationships.\n\n347\n00:21:15.265 --> 00:21:18.538\nAnd we offer training courses\nfrom basic word processing\n\n348\n00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:22.023\nto more specialized training\nin the business application.\n\n349\n00:21:22.023 --> 00:21:27.235\nBut there's no support processes in place,\nno service management processes in place.\n\n350\n00:21:27.235 --> 00:21:33.160\nSo the IT director has instigated\na strategic review and\n\n351\n00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.200\nhas arranged for a service catalog,\nwhich if was consulting, I would say okay,\n\n352\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.260\nthat's the first thing we need to do is\nunderstand how many services we've got and\n\n353\n00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.100\nwhat services we will provide,\nso I'm okay with that.\n\n354\n00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.584\nThe review revealed that the services\nare mostly basic and generic,\n\n355\n00:21:50.584 --> 00:21:53.917\napart from the specialized support and\ntraining.\n\n356\n00:21:53.917 --> 00:21:58.748\nAnd an external company has made an\ninformal approach offering desktop support\n\n357\n00:21:58.748 --> 00:22:00.590\nand server hosting.\n\n358\n00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.890\nThe strategic review also revealed that\nmany of the services offered by the IT\n\n359\n00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:10.520\ngroup, fall into a market space\nwell served by other IT providers.\n\n360\n00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.680\nAnd I know that when we've gone\nthrough the class itself, I have said\n\n361\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.580\nto you at many occasion that there's\nalways somebody knocking on the door of\n\n362\n00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:24.760\nyour CEO offering to do your role for\nless money, and to a higher quality.\n\n363\n00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.220\nSo we have to be better\nat marketing ourselves,\n\n364\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.560\nwe have to be better at demonstrating\nthe value that we provide to the business.\n\n365\n00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.690\nSo the question is,\nwell we wanna advise on sourcing services.\n\n366\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.401\nAnd the IT director wants to know whether\nwe should continue providing these\n\n367\n00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:45.229\nservices or whether we should\nfocus on the unique services and\n\n368\n00:22:45.229 --> 00:22:47.153\noutsource generic services.\n\n369\n00:22:47.153 --> 00:22:50.590\nSo what's the next stage\nthen in this decision?\n\n370\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.630\nWell, the first thing that we've got to\ndo is we've gotta undertake a strategic\n\n371\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.690\nreview, we have to.\n\n372\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:04.180\nSo I'm looking straight away at which\nanswers mention a strategic review.\n\n373\n00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.260\nWell A, B, and\nC mention a strategic review.\n\n374\n00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.512\nSo let's take a look at A then,\ncause A, we know, is our five pointer.\n\n375\n00:23:12.512 --> 00:23:15.702\nAnd, well, we want to continue this,\n\n376\n00:23:15.702 --> 00:23:19.764\nbecause the consultants\nalready started this and\n\n377\n00:23:19.764 --> 00:23:25.190\nwe need to quantify the value and\nthe cost of IT service provision.\n\n378\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.770\nThe viability of continuing to provide\nthese services internally can be\n\n379\n00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:34.880\nevaluated together with the potential to\nimprove the management of the services.\n\n380\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:41.207\nThis is all about cost and value, and we\nunderstand that value to the organization\n\n381\n00:23:41.207 --> 00:23:46.394\nis a mixture of supporting the outcomes,\nbut it's an affordable mix of feature.\n\n382\n00:23:46.394 --> 00:23:52.868\nAnd we have to support the outcomes in\na way that our organization prefers,\n\n383\n00:23:52.868 --> 00:23:56.072\nbut also where they perceive value.\n\n384\n00:23:56.072 --> 00:24:00.632\nSo here we're looking at that\nstrategic review, and we're looking at\n\n385\n00:24:00.632 --> 00:24:04.830\nthe viability of continuing to\nsupport these services in house.\n\n386\n00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:08.320\nOkay, I'm happy with that,\nas my five pointer that looks good.\n\n387\n00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.530\nWell let me take a look then\nat my three pointer B, okay.\n\n388\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.260\nSo the strategic review should continue\nin order to better understand the costs.\n\n389\n00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:22.970\nIf the cost of providing desktop PC\nsupport is greater than the price,\n\n390\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.595\nthen these services should be outsource.\n\n391\n00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:32.730\nI want to scream and I want to run away\nbecause where is my value to the business.\n\n392\n00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.520\nRemember what I said about we're not\nvery good at marketing ourselves and\n\n393\n00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.620\nwe cannot make decisions\nbased purely on cost.\n\n394\n00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.590\nSomebody else may be able to provide\na cheaper service than we do, but\n\n395\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.780\nwe have all the experience.\n\n396\n00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.650\nWe have all the expertise, so\n\n397\n00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:58.000\nwe understand our organization so\nwhat about value to the business.\n\n398\n00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.540\nWhat about value to the organization?\n\n399\n00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.620\nI see nothing mentioned there.\n\n400\n00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.180\nRight, well let's take a look at C,\nwhich is our one pointer.\n\n401\n00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:14.093\nA strategic review should continue in\norder to fully understand the cost\n\n402\n00:25:14.093 --> 00:25:17.730\nof providing the services\nin the service portfolio.\n\n403\n00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:23.146\nCost again,\n\n404\n00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:28.146\nonce these greater understandings have\nbeen achieved then the focus should\n\n405\n00:25:28.146 --> 00:25:33.160\nbe to consider outsourcing those services\nthat are most costly to provide.\n\n406\n00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.690\nWell for start, we don't have\na portfolio we have a catalogue.\n\n407\n00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.190\nRemember that third bullet\npoint in that scenario there or\n\n408\n00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:47.560\nsorry the surge paragraphs\nsorry in this scenario.\n\n409\n00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.750\nActing on advice they've arranged for\ndevelopment of a catalogue.\n\n410\n00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.240\nI don't see any mention\nof a portfolio there.\n\n411\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.140\nWe don't need a portfolio right now.\n\n412\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.010\nWe need to see what services\nwe currently provide.\n\n413\n00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:04.330\nSo actually understand in the cost of\nproviding services in the portfolio.\n\n414\n00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:10.290\nWe don't have one of those, and we\nfocusing on cost again I don't like that.\n\n415\n00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.570\nIt makes me want to cry.\n\n416\n00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.195\nSo let's take a look at D then,\nD is our destructor.\n\n417\n00:26:14.195 --> 00:26:16.068\nService catalogue.\n\n418\n00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:18.560\nOkay, well we know we got one of them.\n\n419\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.407\nShould be enhanced to become a portfolio,\nokay.\n\n420\n00:26:21.407 --> 00:26:25.750\nPortfolio is our pipeline and\nthese are our ideas.\n\n421\n00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.640\nAnd our retired services.\n\n422\n00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.170\nDo we really need to go there yet when\nwe've got no other processes in place?\n\n423\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:36.750\nI don't think so okay, to provide\nbetter understanding of the service\n\n424\n00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.640\npositions within the full\nservice life cycle,\n\n425\n00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.410\nwe're considering whether\nwe should outsource or not.\n\n426\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.100\nSo I don't think so.\n\n427\n00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.930\nThe costs can then be fully identified and\nunderstood and\n\n428\n00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.740\nthe strategy should focus\non ways of reducing costs.\n\n429\n00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.770\nCost, cost, cost, cost, cost.\n\n430\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.170\nThat's all I see in these answers.\n\n431\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:00.888\nThe only answer that focuses on value,\nthat even mentions value,\n\n432\n00:27:00.888 --> 00:27:02.414\nis the five pointer.\n\n433\n00:27:02.414 --> 00:27:10.200\nThat has to be the right answer because\nit's the only one that mentions value.\n\n434\n00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.844\nWe have to be aligned to the needs of the\norganization and we have to deliver value.\n\n435\n00:27:15.844 --> 00:27:20.265\nSo let's take a look at a question number\nfour then, and let's take a read of this\n\n436\n00:27:20.265 --> 00:27:23.974\nscenario, there's been a series\nof emergence in acquisitions and\n\n437\n00:27:23.974 --> 00:27:28.650\na managed service company needs to\nrationalize financial management.\n\n438\n00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:34.040\nWe've got duplicated and conflicting\nfinancial management processes.\n\n439\n00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.620\nRemember from our financial\nmanagement course,\n\n440\n00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.330\nour financial management episode,\nfinancial management had to be done\n\n441\n00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.930\ninline with the governance that\nis laid out by the organization.\n\n442\n00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:51.000\nSo where we have mergers and acquisitions\nthat can be a challenge cuz we will have\n\n443\n00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.460\ndifferent enterprise strategies for\nmanaging financial management.\n\n444\n00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.650\nCustomers build using disparate\nsystems and internally,\n\n445\n00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:05.030\naccount in for cost is becoming\nincreasingly difficult because of course,\n\n446\n00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:09.290\nwe've got that problem\nwith disparate systems.\n\n447\n00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.520\nCustomers are beginning to\ncomplain about inaccurate billing,\n\n448\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.770\nwhich has affected perception of quality.\n\n449\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.790\nAnd the CFO has been looking for\nframeworks and\n\n450\n00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.420\nhas decided that ITIL is\ngonna serve the needs well.\n\n451\n00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.292\nOkay, I'm happy with that.\n\n452\n00:28:24.292 --> 00:28:29.780\nBut ITIL, well that will help with\nfinancial management within an IT.\n\n453\n00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.010\nBut it's an IT manage services company so\nwe're okay with that.\n\n454\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:40.075\nCFO has mandated it's scary in\n[LAUGH] two months that we must have\n\n455\n00:28:40.075 --> 00:28:45.040\nplans in place for implement in IT or\nfinancial [LAUGH] management.\n\n456\n00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.940\nAnd for IT services, okay.\n\n457\n00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:53.170\nAnd so he expects recommendations\nregarding the best method of charging,\n\n458\n00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.970\nin a consistent manner,\nto all the customers and\n\n459\n00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.030\nyou've been hired as a consultant\nexpert to organize this.\n\n460\n00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.014\nSo you've agreed,\nlet's go to the question,\n\n461\n00:29:05.014 --> 00:29:08.922\nthat establishing [LAUGH] financial\nmanagement must be focused first on\n\n462\n00:29:08.922 --> 00:29:13.920\ndriving a process that will accurately\naccount for the cost of the services.\n\n463\n00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.700\nAfter this is completed,\nthen the next step will be to examine\n\n464\n00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.240\nwhich cost models will\nfit the company's needs.\n\n465\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.630\nSo which most accurately\ndescribes the correct approach for\n\n466\n00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:30.600\nthe initial task of accurately\naccounting for the cost of services.\n\n467\n00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.660\nSo that's the initial task, and\n\n468\n00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:37.200\nwe have got to describe the correct\napproach for the initial task.\n\n469\n00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.970\nWell, we know that each organization has\n\n470\n00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.847\nhad some financial management in place,\nokay.\n\n471\n00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:50.495\nSo let's take a look then at our\nfive pointer which happens to be D..\n\n472\n00:29:50.495 --> 00:29:54.870\nOkay, and as it says, former organization.\n\n473\n00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.520\nWell, they've had their own\nfinancial management in place.\n\n474\n00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.610\nSo we're going to renew these sources and\nagree on the combined chart of accounts\n\n475\n00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:09.110\nand a plan for migrating that\ninformation into a new standard, okay?\n\n476\n00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:13.500\nAt the same time, we're going to\ncreate a new set of processes and\n\n477\n00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.380\nbest practices using the best\npractices that could\n\n478\n00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:23.760\nbe gained from each of\nthe disparate organizations.\n\n479\n00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.510\nWe also need to review our service assets\nto ensure that these costs are included,\n\n480\n00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.640\nso that we have got an accurate cost.\n\n481\n00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.250\nThat's okay.\n\n482\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.780\nI don't see anything wrong with\nthat at all, that sounds good.\n\n483\n00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.020\nI'm not saying that it sounds easy but\nit's sounds good.\n\n484\n00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:42.770\nSo what we do is, we consolidate all\nof the accounts that we have right now.\n\n485\n00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.742\nNothing wrong with that.\n\n486\n00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:47.532\nSo the C, the current situation and\n\n487\n00:30:47.532 --> 00:30:53.820\nthis is our three pointer is complicated\nby numerous financial practices.\n\n488\n00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.400\nIt's not complicated,\nit's just the way it is, okay?\n\n489\n00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:05.100\nSo, coming into this with a negative\nattitude as this appears to, it's\n\n490\n00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:10.050\na little bit worrying from my perspective\nbecause we know we've gotta do this, okay.\n\n491\n00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:16.060\nSo then we view what practices should be\ntaken to determine if the organization\n\n492\n00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.922\nshould adopt or adapt some of them\ninto the overall organization.\n\n493\n00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:24.090\nI wanna start off with\nwhere I am right now.\n\n494\n00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.140\nRemember my CSI approach?\n\n495\n00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.610\nFrom CSI, we covered this in foundation.\n\n496\n00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.579\nWe start off with\nunderstanding the vision.\n\n497\n00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:36.920\nAnd division, well,\nit's quite clearly set out here that\n\n498\n00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.790\nthe initial task is to accurately\naccount for the cost of services.\n\n499\n00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.350\nSo start off with your vision,\nthat's your vision.\n\n500\n00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:49.006\nNow where I'm I right now is my\nnext step for my CSI approach.\n\n501\n00:31:49.006 --> 00:31:55.159\nD, looks at that in\nthe combining the accounts.\n\n502\n00:31:55.159 --> 00:31:57.954\nLooking at these combined\nchart of accounts.\n\n503\n00:31:57.954 --> 00:31:59.284\nWhere am I right now?\n\n504\n00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:02.750\nBefore I go to the right,\nwhere do I want to be?\n\n505\n00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:06.500\nC just jumps straight into\nthe where do I want to be?\n\n506\n00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.960\nAnd then, how do I get there,\n\n507\n00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.500\nwhich is that next step is\nto examine the major inputs.\n\n508\n00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.440\nIt's not asking you for the next step.\n\n509\n00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.330\nFirst thing that you\nneed to remember there,\n\n510\n00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:25.990\nits only asking you to describe the\ninitial task of accounting for services.\n\n511\n00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:28.040\nIt's not asking you for the next step.\n\n512\n00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.320\nBut you haven't taken the baseline\nof where you are right now so\n\n513\n00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.430\nyou can't decide where you\nwant to be until you decided,\n\n514\n00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.349\nuntil you know where you are right now.\n\n515\n00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.880\nSo let's take a look at our one-pointer.\n\n516\n00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.900\nAnd straight away,\nwe're straight into an assumption.\n\n517\n00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.380\nThat we're gonna lose customers\nbecause of perception.\n\n518\n00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.410\nSo the first action is to implement\nservice-level management.\n\n519\n00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.240\nThat's not what it says in the question.\n\n520\n00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:02.730\nIt asks you how to implement accurate\naccounting for the cost of services.\n\n521\n00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:06.400\nIt's not asking you to implement\nservice level management.\n\n522\n00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.890\nA service level management will\nnot stabilize service quality.\n\n523\n00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.900\nIt will show you what we have right\nnow and it will set targets for\n\n524\n00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.909\nthe future but\nit's not gonna stabilize anything.\n\n525\n00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.570\nAnd then, followed by proper\nfinancial management implementation,\n\n526\n00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.920\nincluding setting up chart of accounts.\n\n527\n00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.402\nIt's asking you how to set\nup the chart of account?\n\n528\n00:33:28.402 --> 00:33:33.022\nIf you don't answer the question,\nyou'll not gonna get five points,\n\n529\n00:33:33.022 --> 00:33:35.520\nyou have to answer the question.\n\n530\n00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.461\nDon't answer what you think you've read,\nanswer what you've read.\n\n531\n00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:45.673\nLet's go on to A,\nwhich is now a distractor.\n\n532\n00:33:45.673 --> 00:33:50.590\nThe biggest issue is these for practices.\n\n533\n00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:54.884\nAnd in order to unify this, we must first\nimplement service portfolio management.\n\n534\n00:33:54.884 --> 00:33:56.188\nWhy?\n\n535\n00:33:56.188 --> 00:34:00.127\n[LAUGH] I'm not sure what service\nportfolio management has got to do\n\n536\n00:34:00.127 --> 00:34:01.250\nwith this.\n\n537\n00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:05.020\nService portfolio management is where\nwe have a list of our services in\n\n538\n00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.700\nthe catalog, and\nour ideas in the pipeline and\n\n539\n00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:14.085\nour retired services in the retired\nservices portion, so I'm not sure why.\n\n540\n00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:17.545\nIn order to actualize service assets and\nconnect them to customer face and\n\n541\n00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:21.115\nservices, and account for\nthe capital and non-capital cost.\n\n542\n00:34:21.115 --> 00:34:24.483\nWe haven't worked out what we're\ngoing to categorize as capital and\n\n543\n00:34:24.483 --> 00:34:27.470\nnon-capital expenditure yet.\n\n544\n00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:30.580\nBecause we haven't got a consistent\nway of looking at this,\n\n545\n00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:34.000\nwe've just got disparate ways of\ndoing this, so we can't do that.\n\n546\n00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.460\nAnd that's used then for establishing\na chart of accounts, budget line items and\n\n547\n00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.330\ncosting accounts.\n\n548\n00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:47.430\nNo, this wont provide\nthe sought-after financial feature.\n\n549\n00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:50.770\nWhat this will do is just\nconfuse matters most.\n\n550\n00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.590\nWe don't need portfolio management.\n\n551\n00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:57.150\nWhat we need to do is we need to look at\nthe accounts that we have right now, and\n\n552\n00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:01.180\nsee how we can combine\nthem into a consistent,\n\n553\n00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:07.190\na standard chart that we can understand\nthe information that we have.\n\n554\n00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.510\nSo to me, this particular question is\nfairly obvious that the five pointer here\n\n555\n00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:19.540\nis D, because D is the only one that\nactually goes, well, follows the right\n\n556\n00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:24.410\nroute down the CSI approach but it's the\nonly one that really answers the question.\n\n557\n00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.160\nPay very, very careful attention\nto what the question is,\n\n558\n00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.510\nthat you are being answered.\n\n559\n00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.770\nAnd please remember to answer\nthe question you're being asked,\n\n560\n00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.440\nrather than the one you\nthink you're being asked.\n\n561\n00:35:37.755 --> 00:35:42.765\nSo that's it for part one for\nour first half of our exam review.\n\n562\n00:35:42.765 --> 00:35:47.757\nSo please join us again in next\nepisode where we will take a look\n\n563\n00:35:47.757 --> 00:35:52.661\nat part two of our sample paper review for\nservice strategy.\n\n564\n00:35:52.661 --> 00:35:58.340\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.090\n[SOUND] So\nwelcome back to Part 2 of our sample\n\n2\n00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.324\npaper review for service strategy.\n\n3\n00:00:09.324 --> 00:00:14.750\nSo let's get straight on and\ntake a look at question number 5 then.\n\n4\n00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.690\nAnd question number 5,\nwell, you are a consultant\n\n5\n00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.130\nengaged by the CIO to provide advice.\n\n6\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.370\nWell, on what strategy?\n\n7\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.110\nWe've got four factories in Europe.\n\n8\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.820\nNow first thing that I want you to\nthink about is the fact then we've got\n\n9\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.440\ndifferent languages, and\nwe've got different cultures.\n\n10\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.680\nThe head office is based in a large\ncity close to one of the factories.\n\n11\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.875\nIt doesn't say where.\n\n12\n00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.800\nAll four factories have got\nadministration offices,\n\n13\n00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.120\nsupporting purchasing,\nsales, distribution.\n\n14\n00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.190\nAnd shared services\nare based at head office.\n\n15\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.979\nThe customers are either large car\nmanufacturers, who have ongoing\n\n16\n00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.040\nrequirements for standard parts that\nare planned a long time in advance.\n\n17\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.450\nIt's fairly secure,\nbrings in steady, low margin income.\n\n18\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.290\nWe've got car repairers, who have\na mixture of those steady requirements and\n\n19\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.115\nsome ad hoc ones.\n\n20\n00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:08.970\nAnd they require their parts\non relatively short notice.\n\n21\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.120\nSo it's based on medium and\nshort term contracts.\n\n22\n00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.440\nAnd this strong competition and\n\n23\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.280\nthe level of service responsiveness\nis a differentiator.\n\n24\n00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.863\nAnd then we've got car manufacturers and\nspecialists,\n\n25\n00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:23.919\nwho've got specific one off requirements.\n\n26\n00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:27.981\nAnd they're willing to pay a lot of money,\nand they're willing to wait for delivery.\n\n27\n00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:31.742\nAnd they can lead to lucrative\nlong term contracts.\n\n28\n00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:34.390\nAll customers are supplied\nby their local factory,\n\n29\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.270\nbut large customers can be\nsupplied by more than one.\n\n30\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.237\nAs most of the services and\n\n31\n00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:44.441\nmanagement head office by a central IT\nunit with smaller, local unit serve\n\n32\n00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:48.328\neach of the factories with\ninfrastructure management and support.\n\n33\n00:01:48.328 --> 00:01:51.165\nAnd the services for the factories and\n\n34\n00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:56.842\nthe sales run on distributed IT\ninfrastructure and are supported locally.\n\n35\n00:01:56.842 --> 00:02:01.192\nThe CIO's been asked by the CEO\nto reduce the cost of IT, and\n\n36\n00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:07.123\nhe's decided to investigate a strategy\nof consolidation and centralization.\n\n37\n00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:10.700\nOkay, so the question, again,\nthen, you are the consultant.\n\n38\n00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.600\nWhat's the best advice on the strategy?\n\n39\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.878\nNow he wants to look at consolidation and\ncentralization.\n\n40\n00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:21.621\nSo let's take a look\nthen at our five pointer.\n\n41\n00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.774\nAnd our five pointer actually says, well,\n\n42\n00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:27.870\nit's difficult to determine where\nconsolidation would be most effective.\n\n43\n00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.857\nAnd that's a fair statement to make,\nbecause based on the information I have\n\n44\n00:02:31.857 --> 00:02:35.801\nin that scenario, I would say well,\nI don't really know enough right now.\n\n45\n00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:42.080\nIt's likely that some would be cost\neffective through sharing resources, etc.\n\n46\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.210\nBut it would be more appropriate to\nconsider the dependencies between\n\n47\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.540\nthe services,\nhow the services is deployed, and\n\n48\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.640\nevaluate user costs and IT costs.\n\n49\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.230\nAnd then determine whether consolidation\nof any aspects of the service would be\n\n50\n00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.120\ncost effective.\n\n51\n00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.000\nOkay, so in other words,\n\n52\n00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.540\nwhat they say it is, we need to think\nabout how the services hang together.\n\n53\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.860\nThat's the best thing to do right now,\nis look at how they hang together.\n\n54\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.320\nNow I have mentioned to you in previous\nsession that we want to focus on value,\n\n55\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.370\nas well as cost.\n\n56\n00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.313\nHowever, in this particular scenario,\n\n57\n00:03:18.313 --> 00:03:22.441\nwe are told that this is part\nof a cost-cutting exercise.\n\n58\n00:03:22.441 --> 00:03:29.820\nSo we have to demonstrate a willingness\nand an approach that will cut costs.\n\n59\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.030\nThat's the answer,\nthat's what we have to look for.\n\n60\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.088\nSo D says, well,\nit's gonna be difficult right now.\n\n61\n00:03:36.088 --> 00:03:41.490\nOkay, C, well, it says here in C,\nwhich is your three pointer,\n\n62\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.800\nit's possible that there\nare aspects of all services\n\n63\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.290\nsupporting all end customer types that\nwould be capable of consolidation.\n\n64\n00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.930\nIt kind of makes an assumption, but the\nfact that it says that it's possible then\n\n65\n00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.100\nsuggests ambiguity and\ndoesn't commit to anything.\n\n66\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.580\nSo I'm kind of all right with that, but\nI don't really like the wording of it.\n\n67\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.100\nIt would be appropriate to investigate\nfurther a service model for\n\n68\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.060\neach of the IT service types with at least\nmatching existing levels of utility and\n\n69\n00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.730\nwarranty at a lower cost.\n\n70\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.110\nNow there's an assumption that I don't\nlike, that the assumption there is that\n\n71\n00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.090\nyou can match existing levels of\nutility and warranty at a lower cost.\n\n72\n00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.790\nYou might not be able to, and you've\nmissed out the fact that we've probably\n\n73\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.530\ngot a lot of shared\ncomponents of these services.\n\n74\n00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.540\nThat we could put some\nefficiencies in place there,\n\n75\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.330\nwhich is why D is your five pointer,\nand it looks at the relationships.\n\n76\n00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.490\nBecause that looks at\nthe shared components,\n\n77\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.090\nand it looks at adding in efficiencies\nin those shared components.\n\n78\n00:04:44.412 --> 00:04:48.130\nWhereas C just looks\nimmediately at each service,\n\n79\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.660\ntrying to keep it in a silo, and that's\nnot going to help us with efficiency.\n\n80\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.160\nActually looking at consolidation will\nhelp us better with efficiencies.\n\n81\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160\nSo let's look at B, B is your one pointer.\n\n82\n00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.944\nWell, the IT services support the ad\nhoc cost requirement provide important\n\n83\n00:05:05.944 --> 00:05:08.360\nbusiness differentiation.\n\n84\n00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.010\nSo, it's important that\nthese are serviced locally.\n\n85\n00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.150\nIs it?\n\n86\n00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.390\nIs it really?\n\n87\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.070\nIf I go back to my scenario, it says,\n\n88\n00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.470\nin number three there, well, they've\ngot specific one off requirements, for\n\n89\n00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.060\nwhich they're willing to pay a high\npremium and wait for delivery.\n\n90\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.630\nWell, if they wait for delivery, then\nit doesn't have to be serviced locally.\n\n91\n00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.020\nThey could be serviced centrally.\n\n92\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.030\nAnd these should not be consolidated and\ncentralized?\n\n93\n00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.760\nActually, these are the ones\nthat could be consolidated and\n\n94\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.770\ncentralized, out of all of them.\n\n95\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.713\nInstead, the services that are similar\nacross multiple different situations\n\n96\n00:05:48.713 --> 00:05:51.241\nshould be considered for centralization.\n\n97\n00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:54.649\nNow I've got nothing wrong with\nsaying we should consider those for\n\n98\n00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:58.475\ncentralization as well, but to dismiss\nthe ones that are fairly obvious for\n\n99\n00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:00.590\ncentralization would be a huge mistake.\n\n100\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.622\nAnd don't forget we're talking\nabout IT services as well.\n\n101\n00:06:04.622 --> 00:06:09.481\nWe're not necessarily\ntalking about the customers.\n\n102\n00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:14.650\nWe're not necessarily talking\nabout the car parts themselves.\n\n103\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.549\nBut if our services are on site,\nwhere those car parts are produced, and\n\n104\n00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:23.160\nthe car parts are, well,\nas it says in the scenario,\n\n105\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.910\nthe car parts are one off requirements.\n\n106\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.502\nAnd they're willing to wait for\ndelivery, then the IT services,\n\n107\n00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:34.450\nit's not so urgent that the IT\nservices be on site there.\n\n108\n00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.596\nSo B seems take us down the wrong path,\nand that's always a little bit worrying,\n\n109\n00:06:41.596 --> 00:06:43.940\nbut then that's why it's the one pointer.\n\n110\n00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.190\nAnd then let's look at our 0.2,\nor our distractor.\n\n111\n00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.830\nThe services that support contracts with\nmanufacturers are a good candidate for\n\n112\n00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.490\nconsolidation and centralization,\n\n113\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.640\nwhich will bring cost savings through\nsharing resources and infrastructure.\n\n114\n00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.620\nAnd they're the ones that have been\nplanned a long time in advance.\n\n115\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.420\nAnd it's a long term contract.\n\n116\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.860\nOkay, there's an assumption there.\n\n117\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.510\nIt doesn't say that they are willing\nto wait for delivery on this.\n\n118\n00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.860\nit doesn't say that there are any\ntime constraints on here or\n\n119\n00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.270\nthat there aren't any\ntime constraints on this.\n\n120\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.290\nJust that they planned\na long time in advance.\n\n121\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.520\nSince the business services that\nthey support are low value and\n\n122\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.468\nhigh volume, it would make good\nbusiness sense to consolidate them and\n\n123\n00:07:40.468 --> 00:07:45.270\nprovide them centrally.\n\n124\n00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:50.280\nJust because they have low value and\nthey're high volume doesn't\n\n125\n00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.847\nnecessarily mean that we don't\nget a lot of money from them.\n\n126\n00:07:54.847 --> 00:08:00.415\nBecause if they form the bulk of\nour work and the bulk of our sales,\n\n127\n00:08:00.415 --> 00:08:05.071\nthen actually,\njust because they have In all, well,\n\n128\n00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:08.916\nlow value,\nwell there could be a lot of them,\n\n129\n00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:13.799\nit says high volume,\nthat could make up all of our sales.\n\n130\n00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:16.010\nSo be careful about making assumption.\n\n131\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.460\nThis answer here is almost\none huge big assumption.\n\n132\n00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.140\nSo be incredibly carefull\nabout making that assumption.\n\n133\n00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.760\nWe don't want to\nconsolidate something that\n\n134\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.000\nis actually bringing in steady income.\n\n135\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.270\nIf it's bringing in steady income and\n\n136\n00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:39.950\nit's bringing in high volume income\nthen do we really want to disrupt that?\n\n137\n00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:45.530\nBecause we don't want to have\nany negative effect on value.\n\n138\n00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.190\nAnd the ideal candidate in this\ninstance is actually number three.\n\n139\n00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.200\nThey are the ideal candidate for\nconsolidation.\n\n140\n00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.920\nWhich of the car manufacturers and\nspecialists with one off requirements\n\n141\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.218\nthat are willing to pay a high premium and\nwait for delivery.\n\n142\n00:09:01.218 --> 00:09:07.860\nThat's your perfect candidate for\nconsolidation.\n\n143\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.990\nHowever, at this stage, it's really,\nreally difficult to make any assumptions.\n\n144\n00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.370\nAnd I don't like making any without\n\n145\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.670\nlooking at the dependencies\nbetween the services.\n\n146\n00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.470\nSo we going for the answer here.\n\n147\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.500\nAnd we have to go for\n\n148\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.290\nthe best fit answer here that says,\nyou need to investigate further.\n\n149\n00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.550\nBecause this is going to have\na huge impact on the organization.\n\n150\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.000\nAnd therefore,\n\n151\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.040\nwe need to make sure that the decision\nthat we make is going to be the right one.\n\n152\n00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.030\nSo we need to ensure that we've\ngot all of the information to hand\n\n153\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.050\nbefore we make any decisions.\n\n154\n00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.440\nAnd we don't do it with any assumptions.\n\n155\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.410\nAnd that's why D is your five-pointer.\n\n156\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.960\nSo let's take a look at number six then.\n\n157\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.990\nAnd we've got a rather large\nscenario here with number six.\n\n158\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.307\nAnd we're looking at\ngovernance here in number six.\n\n159\n00:09:57.307 --> 00:10:02.137\nWhich was a section that\nwe cover towards the end of\n\n160\n00:10:02.137 --> 00:10:05.712\nour episode with service strategy.\n\n161\n00:10:05.712 --> 00:10:11.330\nSo which one of these proposed ways is\nthe best to address governance issues?\n\n162\n00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.060\nSo we've got a global\nmanufacturing company.\n\n163\n00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.220\nWe've been opening new locations and\nacquiring competitors.\n\n164\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.810\nEven though they're having\nissues with the acquisitions,\n\n165\n00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.320\nwith integrating business services\nunder the single IT department.\n\n166\n00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.490\nSo we've not achieved benefits\nquickly with the integration,\n\n167\n00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:35.010\nwell as quickly as we want,\nand we've had hidden costs.\n\n168\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.330\nWe're struggling to meet demand using the\nsame resources that are now spread across\n\n169\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.220\nmore locations.\n\n170\n00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.720\nAnd the acquired company's IT\nresources are not aligning culturally\n\n171\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.760\nas anticipated.\n\n172\n00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.500\nAnd that looks to me like we need\nto consider organizational change\n\n173\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.840\nmanagement here.\n\n174\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.140\nSo they need further effort\nto adopt corporate ways\n\n175\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.380\nwhile still remaining productive.\n\n176\n00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.350\nService level targets and\ncustomer satisfaction is declining.\n\n177\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.980\nAnd the CEO wants something done.\n\n178\n00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.330\nCIO's asked for more money to\nimplement better governance and\n\n179\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.878\na better acquisition strategy.\n\n180\n00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:18.343\nAnd the CIOs realize that\nincreased attention, well,\n\n181\n00:11:18.343 --> 00:11:22.335\nwould allowed the company to\nposition the integration better.\n\n182\n00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:25.990\nAnd some choices might have\nbeen made differently.\n\n183\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.470\nThe CEO however, felt that we\nalready got corporal governance.\n\n184\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.190\nAnd IT governance is really\njust a reporting structure.\n\n185\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.690\nAnd so, it doesn't need any more money and\nhasn't given us any more money.\n\n186\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.935\nNow, we've convinced the CEO\nof the governances needed.\n\n187\n00:11:39.935 --> 00:11:46.485\nAnd we're going to address the declining\nsocial issues by creating policies and\n\n188\n00:11:46.485 --> 00:11:50.360\nmandate that support\nstaffing to use a ratios.\n\n189\n00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.780\nIt's gonna address the demand\non IT resources and\n\n190\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.380\nassist with faster cultural adoption.\n\n191\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.510\nOkay, the result should be stronger\ncustomer centric focused and\n\n192\n00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.910\nmore collegial attitudes towards,\namongst there.\n\n193\n00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.960\nSo we'll give them more money and\nthey're gonna be nicer to each other,\n\n194\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.240\nthis is what we're saying.\n\n195\n00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.950\nAnd a general sense of guided direction so\nthey've given us some money.\n\n196\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:18.528\nAnd guess what?\n\n197\n00:12:18.528 --> 00:12:20.550\nYou're the one that's gonna sort this out.\n\n198\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:25.950\nSo which one is the best option\nto address governance issues for\n\n199\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.390\nthis particular company?\n\n200\n00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:34.149\nWell, I think personally that the CEO\nis fairly right in IT governance is not\n\n201\n00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:36.740\nseparate from corporate governance.\n\n202\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.100\nAnd they should both be the same.\n\n203\n00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.650\nAnd IT's role is to align our\ngovernment strategies with\n\n204\n00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.405\nthe strategies of the organization.\n\n205\n00:12:46.405 --> 00:12:47.235\nSo let me have a look.\n\n206\n00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:50.005\nLet's see what we've got\nhere as our five-pointer.\n\n207\n00:12:50.005 --> 00:12:55.355\nWell of course, D tells us exactly that\nthere is no need to establish separate.\n\n208\n00:12:55.355 --> 00:13:00.405\nCIO should be part of the company's\noverall corporate governance team.\n\n209\n00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:05.395\nAnd having a corporate focus on IT\ngovernance will help initiate policies for\n\n210\n00:13:05.395 --> 00:13:07.110\ncultural awareness.\n\n211\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.739\nGrowth is the strategic direction\nof the company, not just of IT.\n\n212\n00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:15.970\nAnd so the company's governance should\nensure that the CIOs got input.\n\n213\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.447\nAnd has got decision-making\nauthority regarding strategies and\n\n214\n00:13:19.447 --> 00:13:22.805\npolicies that are designed to\nmeet the company's objectives.\n\n215\n00:13:22.805 --> 00:13:28.024\nSo D is our five-pointer,\naligns IT governance\n\n216\n00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:33.000\nwith the corporate governance,\nI like that.\n\n217\n00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.383\nSo let's take a look at B then, and\nB says, which is our three-pointer.\n\n218\n00:13:39.383 --> 00:13:42.519\nSince the company has got\ncorporate governance in place,\n\n219\n00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:44.314\nthe best place is to review this.\n\n220\n00:13:44.314 --> 00:13:48.960\nAnd decide how we can support\nthe overall corporate objectives.\n\n221\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.840\nWe should be part of that.\n\n222\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.460\nWe're not just supporting\ncorporate objectives,\n\n223\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.600\nwe should be part of corporate objectives.\n\n224\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.410\nSo whilst this is not a terrible answer,\nit's not 100% right,\n\n225\n00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.990\nit's not all-inclusive.\n\n226\n00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.380\nAn IT government's committee should\nbe established to review corporal\n\n227\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.540\ngovernment's policies.\n\n228\n00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.040\nAnd then recommend changes to\nhelp incorporate IT needs.\n\n229\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.410\nUnless the CIO is actually\npart of the executive board.\n\n230\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.640\nAnd we looked at that when we\nlooked at that governance episode.\n\n231\n00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.250\nUnless the CIO is part\nof the executive board.\n\n232\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:33.580\nThen we're not going to get any\ninfluence into corporate governance.\n\n233\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:39.410\nAnd so having an IT steering\ngroup tell the organization,\n\n234\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.390\nyour corporate governance is wrong,\nthat's not gonna go down too well.\n\n235\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.270\nA set of guided IT policies\nshould be developed,\n\n236\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:51.160\nwhich address the IT department\nstructure culture management objectives.\n\n237\n00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.980\nAnd they should define performance\ntargets that tie manager bonuses.\n\n238\n00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.940\nI don't see where they're mentioned,\nby the way, in this scenario,\n\n239\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.710\nto customer's staff satisfaction.\n\n240\n00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.682\nCulture is something that we look at\nthroughout an entire organization.\n\n241\n00:15:06.682 --> 00:15:10.280\nIt's not just something that\nwe have to address within IT.\n\n242\n00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.500\nSo just trying to address it within IT and\nisolation is gonna be very,\n\n243\n00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.740\nvery difficult.\n\n244\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.279\nAnd this is why we're kind of,\nI get the feeling when\n\n245\n00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:21.340\nwe read through that three-pointer that\nwe're kinda blaming the organization.\n\n246\n00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.510\nAnd we're kinda saying hey look, okay,\nthis is a little bit your fault.\n\n247\n00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.360\nYou need to think about us, and\nwe're gonna take some of your policies and\n\n248\n00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.770\nwe're gonna try and apply them.\n\n249\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.600\nIt's kind of dictatorial in that sense.\n\n250\n00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.884\nSo let's take a look at our one pointer\nthen and our one pointer here is C.\n\n251\n00:15:42.884 --> 00:15:47.562\nAnd our short term objectives\nare to restore customer confidence,\n\n252\n00:15:47.562 --> 00:15:49.540\nstabilize service levels.\n\n253\n00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.740\nI don't see that it says that anywhere,\ndoes it?\n\n254\n00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.960\nAre these actual term objectives?\n\n255\n00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.988\nWe're talking about integration here.\n\n256\n00:15:58.988 --> 00:16:04.792\nAnd I don't see these as actual term\nobjectives in this particular scenario.\n\n257\n00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:11.210\nSo, reading on about it requires priority\nfocus on optimizing staff levels.\n\n258\n00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.859\nThat's the number of staff.\n\n259\n00:16:12.859 --> 00:16:15.931\nBut there's nothing in the scenario\nthat says we've got a problem with\n\n260\n00:16:15.931 --> 00:16:16.860\nthe number of staff.\n\n261\n00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.400\nOkay, we've got customer dissatisfaction,\nwe know that.\n\n262\n00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.220\nAnd that should be addressed.\n\n263\n00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.670\nBut not prior to governance initiatives.\n\n264\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.855\nGovernance issued, dear, my teeth.\n\n265\n00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:32.780\n[LAUGH] Governance initiatives should\n\n266\n00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.979\nactually address the issue\nof customer dissatisfaction.\n\n267\n00:16:38.368 --> 00:16:41.650\nThe reputation or\nfuture of the IT department relies on\n\n268\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.940\nhow well the CIO can demonstrate IT\nresponsiveness to immediate concerns.\n\n269\n00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:52.095\nNo, the IT reputation and\nthe future of IT relies on how well we can\n\n270\n00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:58.415\nintegrate our services together, and\nhow well we can integrate our staff.\n\n271\n00:16:58.415 --> 00:17:02.805\nIt's not just about immediate concerns,\nit's about IT going forward.\n\n272\n00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:04.795\nAnd it's about all of IT.\n\n273\n00:17:04.795 --> 00:17:06.885\nNot just about addressing\nwhat's happening now,\n\n274\n00:17:06.885 --> 00:17:10.575\nbut aligning ourselves with the current\nand the future needs of the business.\n\n275\n00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.310\nLet's look at A.\n\n276\n00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.210\nA's our distractor.\n\n277\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:18.750\nAnd A talks about addressing\ncultural staff issues.\n\n278\n00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.960\nAnd then we move on to created\na new comprehensive IT\n\n279\n00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.020\ngovernance framework which\neveryone will respect.\n\n280\n00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.271\nOkay, so does that mean, what?\n\n281\n00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:28.730\nThere's somebody standing in\nthe corner with a baseball bat?\n\n282\n00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.330\nThey're forcing us to respect it.\n\n283\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.180\nHmm, okay.\n\n284\n00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.780\nI've always worried about words like that.\n\n285\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.460\nEveryone will respect it.\n\n286\n00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.790\nThat it such an assumption.\n\n287\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.310\nCorporate senior managers\nshould issue a directive.\n\n288\n00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.655\nThey do have a baseball bat.\n\n289\n00:17:45.655 --> 00:17:50.670\nRequiring adherence to policy and\ninstructing IT directors to create\n\n290\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:56.870\na policy for a cultural awareness\ndirective within the IT department.\n\n291\n00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.530\nWow, they're giving out\nbaseball bats to everybody.\n\n292\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.430\nThis should be linked to\nthe new IT governance draft.\n\n293\n00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.270\nIt will stabilize service levels.\n\n294\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.025\nNo, it will have people leaving.\n\n295\n00:18:07.025 --> 00:18:10.420\n[LAUGH] And return customer\nsatisfaction to prior levels.\n\n296\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.850\nAs I've said, no,\nit will have people leaving.\n\n297\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.994\nAfter service levels are stabilized,\nthis is such an assumption, and\n\n298\n00:18:17.994 --> 00:18:19.512\nit's a wrong one as well,\n\n299\n00:18:19.512 --> 00:18:24.228\nthen departmental management can move\non with a broader governance framework.\n\n300\n00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:29.426\nAnd, well supplementing\nthe corporate governance framework,\n\n301\n00:18:29.426 --> 00:18:34.632\nand like I said, the baseball bat\napproach does not work, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:34.632 --> 00:18:38.563\nAnd it doesn't matter how many baseball\nbats you buy in this instance,\n\n303\n00:18:38.563 --> 00:18:40.541\nit's certainly not going to work.\n\n304\n00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:44.630\nDirectives, that's not going to work.\n\n305\n00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:49.140\nEveryone will respect the framework,\nokay, yes, yeah,\n\n306\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.810\ncuz you give me a document all the time\nand I'm bound to respect it and follow it.\n\n307\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.990\nUnless you can convince\nme that it's a good idea,\n\n308\n00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.858\nthen I'm going to be\nreluctant to follow it.\n\n309\n00:18:57.858 --> 00:19:01.436\nSo D there is our five pointer then, and\n\n310\n00:19:01.436 --> 00:19:07.300\nit looks at IT being part of\nthe governance of the organization.\n\n311\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:13.720\nLet's take a look at number seven then,\nwhich is the primary process ownership for\n\n312\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.400\neach of these activities?\n\n313\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.520\nNow in this particular answer, the best\nway to get to the five pointer is simply\n\n314\n00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.350\njust to marry up what you know\nabout process activities and\n\n315\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.850\nroles and\nresponsibilities with the scenario, okay?\n\n316\n00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.950\nSo in this particular scenario,\nwe've got an IT service provider,\n\n317\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:39.730\nthey've been implementing ITIL processes,\nokay?\n\n318\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.430\nAnd we've enjoyed solid and\nsteady customer growth.\n\n319\n00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:49.450\nA new marketing campaign is under\nway that will focus on new roles.\n\n320\n00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:53.618\nAnd these are BRM, Portfolio Manager,\nService Level Manager,\n\n321\n00:19:53.618 --> 00:19:56.509\na Design Coordinator, and Demand Manager.\n\n322\n00:19:56.509 --> 00:20:01.611\nNow, if you don't know the roles\nthat you have in front of you in\n\n323\n00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:08.310\nthis particular scenario, you need to\ngo back to your foundation material.\n\n324\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.480\nAnd this is why the foundation\nis a prerequisite for\n\n325\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.950\nsitting any intermediate class.\n\n326\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.660\nAnd there is an, well an assumption and\n\n327\n00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:24.910\nan understanding there that because you've\npassed your ITIL Foundation Material,\n\n328\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:29.230\nthen you understand what\neach of these roles do.\n\n329\n00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.010\nSo, it's very important before you sit\n\n330\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.920\nany ITIL intermediate exam that you\nreview your foundation material.\n\n331\n00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.140\nBecause you could be\ntested on that as well.\n\n332\n00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.331\nSo the marketing manager has planned a\ncampaign around some of these activities,\n\n333\n00:20:47.331 --> 00:20:49.026\nand how they're gonna add value.\n\n334\n00:20:49.026 --> 00:20:51.580\nAnd the activities that\nwill be the focus are,\n\n335\n00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.168\ndeveloping customer requirements,\nbuilding cases, building business cases,\n\n336\n00:20:56.168 --> 00:20:58.922\nconfirming detailed\nfunctional requirements,\n\n337\n00:20:58.922 --> 00:21:03.920\nconfirming service warranty requirements,\ndetailing patterns of business activity.\n\n338\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.700\nEvaluating the business case, and\nreporting on service performance, okay?\n\n339\n00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:16.160\nSo now we gonna clarify how each role\nis involved in the activities, okay?\n\n340\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:22.940\nSo we need to sort out who\nhas got responsibility for\n\n341\n00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.650\neach of these activities and\nthe business case.\n\n342\n00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.550\nLet's take a look at the answers here.\n\n343\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.590\nDeveloping high level\ncustomer requirements,\n\n344\n00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.510\nthat's definitely business\nrelationship management.\n\n345\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.470\nBuilding a business case, yeah that's\nbusiness relationship management and\n\n346\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.580\nfinancial management, but\nas financial management is not there,\n\n347\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.000\nthen we're talking about\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n348\n00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.602\nConfirming detailed functionality?\n\n349\n00:21:48.602 --> 00:21:51.260\nYes, that happens in design coordination.\n\n350\n00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:57.283\nDesign coordination produces\nthe service design package.\n\n351\n00:21:57.283 --> 00:22:01.720\nThat information you will find\nin your foundation material.\n\n352\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.770\nConfirming customer requirement for\navailability.\n\n353\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:09.000\nThat's an availability target and should\nappear in your service level agreement.\n\n354\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.955\nSo that is the responsibility\nof service level management.\n\n355\n00:22:13.955 --> 00:22:18.565\nPatents of business activity,\nwe know that that is demand management.\n\n356\n00:22:18.565 --> 00:22:24.765\nEvaluating the business case, well that's\npart of the viability of a new service.\n\n357\n00:22:24.765 --> 00:22:28.564\nSo that would lie with\nservice portfolio management.\n\n358\n00:22:28.564 --> 00:22:32.515\nA reporting service performance\nagainst the service level targets.\n\n359\n00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:34.575\nWell we do that in our slam charts and\n\n360\n00:22:34.575 --> 00:22:38.135\nour rag charts which are presented\nat our service review meeting.\n\n361\n00:22:38.135 --> 00:22:41.601\nAnd that's part of\nservice level management.\n\n362\n00:22:41.601 --> 00:22:44.826\nNow, I'm not gonna go over\nany of the other answers\n\n363\n00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:48.280\nbecause you'll see that your\nthree pointer here is B.\n\n364\n00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:54.080\nAnd C is your one pointer, and\nD is your distractor, your zero pointer.\n\n365\n00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.160\nBecause to be perfectly honest,\nthey're either right or wrong.\n\n366\n00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.570\nAnd we've already gone over\nthe ones that are wrong.\n\n367\n00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.164\nNow back in the scenario,\n\n368\n00:23:01.164 --> 00:23:06.244\nit mentioned that they were confused about\nresponsibility for the business case.\n\n369\n00:23:06.244 --> 00:23:10.660\nNow financial management will\ngenerally own the business case.\n\n370\n00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:16.807\nHowever, business relationship management\nhave a responsibility for the business\n\n371\n00:23:16.807 --> 00:23:21.924\ncase, and they have a responsibility\nto not only contribute to it, but\n\n372\n00:23:21.924 --> 00:23:27.499\nthey have a responsibility to advise on\nwhether it should be approved or not.\n\n373\n00:23:27.499 --> 00:23:31.050\nBecause obviously they understand\nvalue to the business.\n\n374\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:35.396\nSo in this case then,\nthe responsibility for the business case,\n\n375\n00:23:35.396 --> 00:23:39.899\nbuilding the business case as\nfinancial management isn't there,\n\n376\n00:23:39.899 --> 00:23:44.022\nthen business relationship\nmanagement will take that role.\n\n377\n00:23:44.022 --> 00:23:46.160\nSo how are we doing so far then?\n\n378\n00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.877\nWell let's take a look then at our\nlast question in the sample paper.\n\n379\n00:23:49.877 --> 00:23:53.760\nAnd when we're looking at market\nspaces then by the looks of things.\n\n380\n00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.884\nSo we have a transport company,\nwe've got three divisions.\n\n381\n00:23:57.884 --> 00:24:02.918\nWe've got passenger shuttles with 35\nvehicles that shuttle passengers to and\n\n382\n00:24:02.918 --> 00:24:05.020\nfrom the airport.\n\n383\n00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.209\nAnd they also provide transport\nto hotels and residences as well.\n\n384\n00:24:08.209 --> 00:24:13.577\nWe've got freight transport of 75 small\ncargo vans, that provide clearing and\n\n385\n00:24:13.577 --> 00:24:18.868\nforwarding services from an airport, and\nare also contracted by Global Courier\n\n386\n00:24:18.868 --> 00:24:23.900\ncompany, and they distribute\nnewspapers to hotels and news stands.\n\n387\n00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.930\nAnd then we've got taxis, and\n\n388\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.370\nthey maintain at least 200\nvehicles to taxi drivers.\n\n389\n00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.830\nEvery vehicle has a GPS.\n\n390\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.091\nThey have satellite tracking systems,\n\n391\n00:24:34.091 --> 00:24:36.822\nto enable dispatchers to\ntrack their location.\n\n392\n00:24:36.822 --> 00:24:40.670\nThey have two-way radio communication.\n\n393\n00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.532\nThey have a device to accept\ncredit card payments.\n\n394\n00:24:44.532 --> 00:24:49.917\nAnd the technology department supports all\nof this technology, as well as the driver\n\n395\n00:24:49.917 --> 00:24:55.305\ndispatch software, financial systems,\ndriver compensation, that's payment,\n\n396\n00:24:55.305 --> 00:25:00.200\nsupply on contract management and\nvehicle lease and maintenance tracking.\n\n397\n00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.830\nSo driver's and the division managers,\nhave been complaining about the quality\n\n398\n00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:09.250\nof the service from the technology\ndepartment, and it appears that they\n\n399\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.830\nbelieve, that the services are used in\nthe same way by all of the divisions,\n\n400\n00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.480\nwhich has resulted in incorrect\nguidance on how to use the services.\n\n401\n00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.990\nAnd business disruptions because we're\nprioritizing incidences incorrectly.\n\n402\n00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:27.130\nThe technology director has initiated\na project to clearly define each service.\n\n403\n00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.350\nSo this lies with service\nportfolio management and\n\n404\n00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.920\nalso understanding our market spaces too.\n\n405\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.390\nSo understanding who our customers are and\nour market spaces.\n\n406\n00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:43.390\nSo let's take a look then at Our\nfive-pointer, which here happens to be A.\n\n407\n00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:51.020\nMarket spaces define opportunities for\nservices to deliver value, okay.\n\n408\n00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.420\nThat's true, it's a true statement.\n\n409\n00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.800\nSo number one, define the outcomes that\neach business needs to achieve, okay?\n\n410\n00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.722\nThen, identify customer assets you\nused to achieve these outcomes.\n\n411\n00:26:02.722 --> 00:26:07.990\nThen, identify the technology service\narchetypes or service modules.\n\n412\n00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:14.113\nMap customer assets and the service\narchetypes, to create market spaces,\n\n413\n00:26:14.113 --> 00:26:18.620\nand that will show how each\ndivision uses each service.\n\n414\n00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.291\nAnd then update the catalogue and\ndifferentiate between services,\n\n415\n00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:26.610\nwhich you use similarly by all divisions,\nand those that are used differently.\n\n416\n00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:33.320\nNow we call this particular topic\nin our service strategy principles.\n\n417\n00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.000\nSo, if this is something that you\nare not completely familiar with, or\n\n418\n00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.850\nsomething that you may feel that\nyou feel a little bit rusty on,\n\n419\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:46.982\nthen review the sessions that we\nhad on service strategy principles.\n\n420\n00:26:46.982 --> 00:26:52.440\nI know that may have been\nquite some time ago for you.\n\n421\n00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.150\nSo that's where you're going\nto find that information,\n\n422\n00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:59.670\nbecause that's a very clear, in my\nmind here are five-points, is a very,\n\n423\n00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.800\nvery clear definition,\nof exactly where we need to go.\n\n424\n00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.708\nBut let's take a look at\nour three-pointer then.\n\n425\n00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:08.870\nSo a three-pointer is D, and\n\n426\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:14.450\nmarket spaces are defined by mapping\nservice archetypes to customer asset.\n\n427\n00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:19.620\nNo, market spaces are a space\nwhere we can deliver value.\n\n428\n00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:26.080\nSo we don't define market spaces by\nmapping our skills, to customer assets.\n\n429\n00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.180\nThat doesn't define, a market space.\n\n430\n00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.140\nThe best starting point,\n\n431\n00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.990\nis to identify the service archetypes and\ncustomer assets.\n\n432\n00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.160\nNo, we always start off with\nunderstanding the value to the business.\n\n433\n00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.230\nAlways, we should always\nstart off with that.\n\n434\n00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.500\nThen, determine the desired\nbusiness outcomes.\n\n435\n00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.530\nNo, they're the wrong way round.\n\n436\n00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.300\nThey're the wrong way around.\n\n437\n00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.040\nSwitch those two around.\n\n438\n00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.090\nThen, we map the service archetypes,\nthe customer aspects and\n\n439\n00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:55.040\nthe business outcomes,\nwhich define the market spaces.\n\n440\n00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:01.170\nOkay, all right,\nthen that's not completely 100% correct.\n\n441\n00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.600\nCompare that against number 4 in answer A,\nand\n\n442\n00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.070\nyou'll see that it's\nnot completely correct.\n\n443\n00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.090\nBut then, document this in a portfolio.\n\n444\n00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.722\nWhich becomes the basis for\ndefining services,\n\n445\n00:28:13.722 --> 00:28:18.600\nensuring that when we're able to deliver\nexactly what each division requires.\n\n446\n00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.960\nWell, the problem with the portfolio is,\nthe portfolio is made up of our pipeline.\n\n447\n00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.980\nThese are our ideas, and catalog which\nour services that are in development,\n\n448\n00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.230\nor that are live, and\nour retired services.\n\n449\n00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.460\nWell, we're talking about\nexisting services, so\n\n450\n00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.900\nwe really only need our catalog.\n\n451\n00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.210\nWe don't need our portfolio, because we're\ntalking about our existing services.\n\n452\n00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.900\nSo let's look at our one-pointer then,\nand our one-pointer here is C.\n\n453\n00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.800\nMarket spaces represent\npoints of opportunity.\n\n454\n00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.230\nOkay, between a service provider and\nits customer, okay.\n\n455\n00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.330\nYou know, that's not necessarily right,\n\n456\n00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.950\nmarket space gives us an opportunity for\nus to deliver value, but\n\n457\n00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:04.030\nactually it sounds better than\nthat first [LAUGH] statement in D.\n\n458\n00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.260\nSo whilst it's not right,\nit does sound better than D.\n\n459\n00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.420\nAnd then, okay, let's take a read on then.\n\n460\n00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.890\nServices are already well defined.\n\n461\n00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.860\nOkay, but\nwe don't understand the services,\n\n462\n00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.840\nin terms of the value that\nit delivers to the business.\n\n463\n00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.890\nSo first document the service archetypes.\n\n464\n00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:28.860\nIn other words, how it hangs\ntogether in the IT side of things.\n\n465\n00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.040\nWell, what about looking at\nthe customer perspective?\n\n466\n00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.620\nIdentify our customer assets.\n\n467\n00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.849\nMap our service archetypes and\nour customer assets, to create a baseline.\n\n468\n00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.200\nNo, okay.\n\n469\n00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.800\nThis doesn't create a baseline.\n\n470\n00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.459\nMapping our service architects and\nour customer assets,\n\n471\n00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:50.220\nwill show how we can deliver an outcome,\nbut\n\n472\n00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.860\nit doesn't create a baseline,\nit's just a snapshot of where we are now.\n\n473\n00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.840\nSo be careful of the wording\nthat's being used.\n\n474\n00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.170\nDocument the business outcomes for\neach division and\n\n475\n00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.520\nvalidate that the market\nspaces can support these.\n\n476\n00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.130\nDocumenting the business outcome for\neach division, I love,\n\n477\n00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.680\nthat needs to be up the top.\n\n478\n00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.810\nIt's gonna be the first thing that we do.\n\n479\n00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.068\nAnd then, validated the market\nspaces can support these.\n\n480\n00:30:14.068 --> 00:30:20.410\nWell, the market spaces, well, that's\nan opportunity for us to deliver value.\n\n481\n00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.910\nSo a market space comes first, and\n\n482\n00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:28.640\nthen we determine what outcomes we can\nfacilitate within those market spaces.\n\n483\n00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.700\nSo that's kind of a bit of\na mixed up statement, and anyway,\n\n484\n00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.110\nit needs to be right at the top.\n\n485\n00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.970\nCatalog the services for\neach market space, so\n\n486\n00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:42.390\nthat we clearly understand what\nis delivered to each division.\n\n487\n00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.110\nOkay, that's okay, however,\n\n488\n00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:52.580\nI prefer the wording from A,\nlook at number 5 in A, okay?\n\n489\n00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:58.270\nSo that allows us to understand\nwhere the Synergy lies, and\n\n490\n00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:03.070\nwhere there are overlaps in functionality,\ncuz right now, it says in that scenario,\n\n491\n00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:06.780\nthat we're treating all of them the same,\nand they're clearly not.\n\n492\n00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.910\nBut then, here in my one-pointer,\n\n493\n00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:13.840\nhere in C, now I'm trying to treat them\nmore separately and they're clearly not.\n\n494\n00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.940\nThere's some overlap,\nso don't ignore that.\n\n495\n00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:23.160\nSo let's look then at B,\nwhich is our zero, our distractor.\n\n496\n00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.180\nEach business division represents\na distinct market space.\n\n497\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:29.430\nNot necessarily.\n\n498\n00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.820\nWe have to go and\ndefine our opportunities, and\n\n499\n00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:38.460\nsome opportunities might actually sit\nacross more than one business division.\n\n500\n00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.990\nDefine the activities, outcomes and\ncustomer assets of each market space.\n\n501\n00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:45.483\nI'm okay with defining activities and\n\n502\n00:31:45.483 --> 00:31:48.883\ndefining outcomes in value\nat this point in time, but\n\n503\n00:31:48.883 --> 00:31:53.730\nnot necessarily the activities, and\ndefinitely not the customer assets.\n\n504\n00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:58.342\nIdentify service archetypes\nin the technology department.\n\n505\n00:31:58.342 --> 00:32:03.080\nA service archetype is this sort of,\nyou know, what makes up a service.\n\n506\n00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.840\nNot necessarily in\nthe technology department.\n\n507\n00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.437\nOkay.\nLink each service archetype to each market\n\n508\n00:32:09.437 --> 00:32:10.190\nspace.\n\n509\n00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:15.470\nNo, we link our service archetypes to\nthe assets that the customers need\n\n510\n00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:20.800\nto be able to facilitate their outcome.\n\n511\n00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.420\nOkay.\n\n512\n00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.890\nDetermine how each market space\nuses each service archetype.\n\n513\n00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:25.530\nWell they don't.\n\n514\n00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.776\nOkay, we use a lot of terminology\nin our distractor, indeed,\n\n515\n00:32:29.776 --> 00:32:31.896\nwe've thrown lots of terminology in there.\n\n516\n00:32:31.896 --> 00:32:34.312\nAnd actually none of it means anything,\n\n517\n00:32:34.312 --> 00:32:37.947\nbecause the market space doesn't\nuse a service archetype.\n\n518\n00:32:37.947 --> 00:32:43.289\nService archetypes, which are used\nsimilarly by different market spaces,\n\n519\n00:32:43.289 --> 00:32:47.562\nshould be catalogued as a core\nservice package, dear, and\n\n520\n00:32:47.562 --> 00:32:52.495\nnow we're just getting more and\nmore definitions that we're throwing\n\n521\n00:32:52.495 --> 00:32:56.961\nin here as well, should be\ncatalogued as core service package.\n\n522\n00:32:56.961 --> 00:32:57.990\nWhy?\nWhy?\n\n523\n00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.990\nThis is down to service\nportfolio management and\n\n524\n00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.240\nthis is down to service level management.\n\n525\n00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.270\nAnd we're not even looking at\ncore service packages right now.\n\n526\n00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:11.580\nWhat we're looking at is where\nwe can find synergy between\n\n527\n00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:16.220\nour services and\nthe customers that use our services.\n\n528\n00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.330\nService archetypes dedicated to a single\nmarket space should be listed as\n\n529\n00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:21.950\na service level package.\n\n530\n00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.140\nNo, cuz the service level package\nif you remember rightly, packaging,\n\n531\n00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:34.630\nif we look back at principles of service\nstrategy, packaging is where we would\n\n532\n00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:40.180\nlook at a particular group of offerings\nand select which one we want to take.\n\n533\n00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:44.110\nWhen we go and buy a cell phone and we\nsay, okay, well, I want this handset, and\n\n534\n00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:48.070\nI want this many minutes, and I want this\nmany texts, and I want this much data.\n\n535\n00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:50.610\nThat's my package.\n\n536\n00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.185\nOkay, and\nthat's exactly the same in IT as well.\n\n537\n00:33:55.185 --> 00:33:56.745\nThis is our package.\n\n538\n00:33:56.745 --> 00:34:00.830\nWell I want this level of service,\nand I would like to have\n\n539\n00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:05.450\nthis level of incident response, and\nthis is how much I'm willing to pay.\n\n540\n00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.722\nSo that is very,\nvery clearly an distractor.\n\n541\n00:34:08.722 --> 00:34:11.154\nOne thing I do want to mention\nabout distractors, and\n\n542\n00:34:11.154 --> 00:34:13.420\nit applies to all of them and\nnot just here.\n\n543\n00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:18.226\nQuite often distractors will take\na lot of the ITIL phrases, and\n\n544\n00:34:18.226 --> 00:34:21.360\nthe ITIL words and will use them.\n\n545\n00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.890\nAnd that's why they're called distractors,\nbecause they're there to distract.\n\n546\n00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:29.350\nAnd they've got lots of nice little words\nthat make you feel warm and safe, and\n\n547\n00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.800\nfuzzy, and you think, that sounds good,\nbecause I remember reading this in\n\n548\n00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:39.150\nthe ITIL publications, or I remember\nJoe talking about this in the class.\n\n549\n00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:42.560\nMake sure that it's relevant to\nthe question that you've been asked and\n\n550\n00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.000\nthat it's relevant to\nthe scenario as well.\n\n551\n00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:51.930\nOkay, so by now,\nyou have finished your sample paper one,\n\n552\n00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:56.306\nand what I would like you to do this point\nin time, is if you feel as though you\n\n553\n00:34:56.306 --> 00:35:01.740\nare ready, is to register to take\nyour test and sit your test.\n\n554\n00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:06.552\nSo log on to the website and\ntake your Service Strategy Test.\n\n555\n00:35:06.552 --> 00:35:09.330\nI will wish you good luck with your test.\n\n556\n00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:10.810\nBut I know you don't need it, right.\n\n557\n00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.700\nI know you've got the right\nskills to do that.\n\n558\n00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:17.220\nBut I would tell you now, is that our\nforum and our chat is always available.\n\n559\n00:35:17.220
