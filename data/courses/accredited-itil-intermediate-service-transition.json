          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.224\n[SOUND] Hi and welcome to ITPRO.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:08.174\nMy name is Jo Peacock, and\n\n3\n00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:14.127\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL Intermediate.\n\n4\n00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:18.291\nSo let's take a look then at our\nfirst slide here, coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:22.360\nAnd we have our introduction\nto our intermediate class, and\n\n6\n00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.340\nYou will see, what we will cover\nis an introduction to the class,\n\n8\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.100\nfollowed by the principles and\nthe processes of the life cycle phase.\n\n9\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550\nThen we'll take a look organizing for\nthat life cycle phase,\n\n10\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.500\nand also the technology considerations,\n\n11\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270\nespecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n12\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.880\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand the critical success factors, and\n\n13\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.140\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith that particular life cycle phase.\n\n14\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.603\nAnd most importantly of course for\nyou, is that preparation for\n\n15\n00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:04.980\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class, okay?\n\n16\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.670\nSo let me take a look now then at how\nwe're going to approach this particular\n\n17\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.790\nintermediate class.\n\n18\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work.\n\n19\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.550\nObviously, you're going to be watching us\non screen, both myself and my colleague.\n\n20\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110\nAnd we're going to be taking through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n21\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.910\nAnd then,\nthere are going to be some discussions and\n\n22\n00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.530\nsome exercises that are going to be\nbased primarily in our chat rooms,\n\n23\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.140\nand also in our forums as well.\n\n24\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.530\nAnd we're also available, if you want\nto undertake any of the assessments.\n\n25\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.168\nThen please feel free to come\nback to us via the forums, and\n\n26\n00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:49.080\nwe will be able to help\nyou out in any way we can.\n\n27\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.808\nAlso provided in the course material,\nwhich is available for\n\n28\n00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:57.120\nyou to download are mock tests or\nexams, if you prefer to use that word.\n\n29\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.720\nAnd we will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you.\n\n30\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.621\nSo where are we then at\nITIL intermediate level?\n\n31\n00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:11.873\nWell, you'll see in\nusing Bloom's Taxonomy,\n\n32\n00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:14.820\nthat we are actually at level 4 analyzing.\n\n33\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.100\nIn other words,\nwe've done at foundation level.\n\n34\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.081\nWe've done the remembering and\n\n35\n00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:23.243\nthe understanding of those\nconcepts within ITIL.\n\n36\n00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:27.686\nAnd we're actually moving through\napplying those concepts to\n\n37\n00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:33.090\nanalyzing those concepts, and\nbeing able to apply the ITIL processes.\n\n38\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.248\nAnd also the concepts at a real-world\nlevel in a real-world situation.\n\n39\n00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:42.590\nSo where does ITIL comes from then?\n\n40\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.849\nWell, let me give you\na little bit of a background.\n\n41\n00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.857\nIt's actually owned by\na company called Axelos.\n\n42\n00:02:47.857 --> 00:02:54.110\nAnd it was first published in\nthe mid 1980s by the UK government.\n\n43\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.748\nAnd the Office of Government Commerce\nowned ITIL for a very, very long time.\n\n44\n00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:05.196\nAnd we developed ITIL right\nthe way back from the 1980s\n\n45\n00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:08.828\nthrough it's version two in the 1990's,\n\n46\n00:03:08.828 --> 00:03:14.115\nmid 1990's to version three,\nwhich was released in 2007.\n\n47\n00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:18.848\nAnd then there was an update\nto version three in 2011,\n\n48\n00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:22.140\nwhich is exactly where we are right now.\n\n49\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.010\nIt is copyrighted.\n\n50\n00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.110\nIt is trademark protected.\n\n51\n00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.960\nIt's a framework for managing services,\nand as such it is a flexible framework.\n\n52\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.730\nA framework that we would expect any\norganization to adopt as a framework,\n\n53\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.948\nbut then to adopt it to suit your needs,\nokay?\n\n54\n00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:44.209\nITIL was born right\nthe way back in the 1980s,\n\n55\n00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.180\nout of a desire to be able to\ndemonstrate value for money and\n\n56\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.070\nefficiency for\nthe use of taxpayers money within the UK.\n\n57\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.175\nWay back in the 1980s,\nthese things started appearing on desk.\n\n58\n00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:03.800\nAnd quite frankly, we didn't know\nhow to manage these in an unbiased,\n\n59\n00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.129\nin an impartial, and\nan efficient and effective way.\n\n60\n00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.420\nAnd thus ITIL was born.\n\n61\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.521\nAnd ITIL was born from a group of industry\nexperts that went out into the big wide\n\n62\n00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:21.397\nworld, and analyzed various organizations\nfrom a various different industry sectors,\n\n63\n00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:27.062\nnot just government, but we're talking\nfinance, we're talking retail, and etc.\n\n64\n00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:31.230\nAnd they came back with\na set of best practices.\n\n65\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:38.109\nBest practices that they observed in the\nreal world for managing our IT services.\n\n66\n00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:39.950\nAnd thus, we have ITIL.\n\n67\n00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.520\nAnd as I've already said,\nwe've had subsequent revisions.\n\n68\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.063\nAnd now, we're up to version three 2011.\n\n69\n00:04:46.063 --> 00:04:51.071\nSo we work on the understanding that,\n\n70\n00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:56.240\nwe have a life to every single service.\n\n71\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.960\nAnd we start off with a concept and\nservice strategy, and\n\n72\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.080\nthen we take that concept and\nwe design it.\n\n73\n00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.731\nAnd then we develop it, and\nwe deploy it as a service into a live\n\n74\n00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:14.573\nenvironment which is where we operate and\nwhere we maintain it.\n\n75\n00:05:14.573 --> 00:05:19.003\nAnd we continually seek to\nensure that we are aligned with\n\n76\n00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:21.969\nthe needs of the organization in CSI.\n\n77\n00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:27.130\nSo you're attending this class,\n\n78\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.027\nbecause you probably want to achieve\nan ITIL intermediate qualification, okay?\n\n79\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.920\nSo you can see that if we were\nto start off right at the very,\n\n80\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.292\nvery top, you'll see where I am.\n\n81\n00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n82\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.610\nI'm also an accredited examiner and\nproctor or invigilator for\n\n83\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.020\nthese exams,and work very, very closely\nwith the official ITIL accreditor and\n\n84\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.560\nalso Axelos who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n85\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.080\nNow in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n86\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.859\nWell, we start off with ITIL foundation.\n\n87\n00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:13.908\nAnd ITIL foundation is a,\nwould traditionally be a three day\n\n88\n00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:19.750\nclassroom experience where we learn\nthe foundations of ITIL, okay?\n\n89\n00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.692\nAnd we learned all the terminology and all\nof the definitions to that terminology.\n\n90\n00:06:23.692 --> 00:06:28.900\nThere's roughly around about 75 that we\nlearn within the ITIL foundation class.\n\n91\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.440\nAnd then as we move through, we can either\ntake an ITIL practitioner class, which can\n\n92\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.976\nbe taken at any point in time throughout\nthe progression of your career within\n\n93\n00:06:39.976 --> 00:06:46.220\nITIL, because ITIL practitioner focuses\non the implementation of ITIL, okay?\n\n94\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.210\nWhereas, if we take a look at the more\nadvanced intermediate classes,\n\n95\n00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.040\nyou are at this moment\nin a life cycle module.\n\n96\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.720\nAnd those life cycle modules consist\nof service strategies, service design,\n\n97\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.470\nservice transition, service operation,\nand continual service improvement.\n\n98\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.680\nAnd that’s where we focus on those\nlife cycles that we've just looked at\n\n99\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.330\npreviously.\n\n100\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.268\nOkay, and on the right-hand side\nthen we have our capability modules.\n\n101\n00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:22.461\nAnd these capability modules really focus\non specific areas within ITIL such as RCV,\n\n102\n00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:27.372\nwhich focuses on release control and\nvalidation.\n\n103\n00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:30.897\nAnd these classes,\nyou will notice that every single one\n\n104\n00:07:30.897 --> 00:07:34.430\nof this classes has got\na score right beside each one.\n\n105\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.080\nSo we've got a number two for\nITIL foundation and we've got a three for\n\n106\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.660\nlife cycle modules, and we've got\na four for our capability modules.\n\n107\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:50.700\nNow what we need to do is ensure\nthat we have achieved a minimum\n\n108\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:57.935\nof 15 credits at both either life cycle or\ncapability module level.\n\n109\n00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:03.855\nIn order to be able to qualify to see\nthe managing across the life cycle class,\n\n110\n00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:08.665\nand the full subsequently,\nthe test that goes among with that class.\n\n111\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:11.995\nSo we need to take two\nfrom the ITIL foundation.\n\n112\n00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:15.065\nThat's a prerequisite,\nwe have to do the foundation and\n\n113\n00:08:15.065 --> 00:08:19.500\nthen we need to add in another\n15 scores from either,\n\n114\n00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.090\nas I've said, the life cycle or capability\nstream, now you can interchange.\n\n115\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:29.100\nYou can mix and match, you do not have\nto stick to one stream or the other.\n\n116\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.215\nOnce you've gotten that 17 in total scores\n\n117\n00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:37.165\nthat are needed to be able to sit\nmanaging across the life cycle.\n\n118\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:41.345\nYour perfectly able to sit\nthat life cycle class and\n\n119\n00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.845\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n120\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.341\nAnd as soon as you've taken that test,\nyou will be awarded those five\n\n121\n00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:52.307\ncredits which will mean that\nyou have achieved ITIL expert.\n\n122\n00:08:52.307 --> 00:08:57.442\nNow ITIL expert is allocated as soon\nas you have pass the management\n\n123\n00:08:57.442 --> 00:09:02.510\nacross the lifecycle test,\nand have achieved 22 credits.\n\n124\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:07.272\nBoth of those must happen in order for\nyou to achieve Itil expert.\n\n125\n00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:10.657\nNow we have the ITIL master qualification,\nand\n\n126\n00:09:10.657 --> 00:09:14.630\nthe ITIL master is\na completely different beast.\n\n127\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.220\nThe ITIL master is a two\nyear qualification.\n\n128\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.839\nAnd during that two years,\nyou will be expected to submit various\n\n129\n00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:31.191\nwhite papers on specific topics within\nthe ITIL qualifications scheme.\n\n130\n00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:35.598\nSo this could be topics on,\nactivities within ITIL.\n\n131\n00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:38.830\nThis could be talked with\nsome processes within ITIL.\n\n132\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.581\nThis could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n133\n00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:47.082\nBut you will be require to sit\na number of white papers or\n\n134\n00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:51.410\nsubmit a number of white papers\nover the period of two years.\n\n135\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.520\nAt the end of those two years,\nonce you have submitted the prerequisite\n\n136\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers, then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n137\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.630\nAnd during that panel interview\nyou will be assessed.\n\n138\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.760\nNot only on your white papers,\n\n139\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.880\nbut also on your experience within\nthe IT service management arena.\n\n140\n00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.890\nAnd at the end of that paneling to view,\n\n141\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.630\nthen if successful, you will be\nawarded the status of ITIL Master.\n\n142\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.700\nSo the qualification scheme,\n\n143\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.340\nI'm going to take this back\nnow to Bloom's taxonomy then.\n\n144\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.360\nAnd just very, very quickly, look at\nthe fact that an ITIL foundation, and\n\n145\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.450\nI know that I've already covered\nthis in a previous slide.\n\n146\n00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.700\nWe just looked at understanding\nthe terminology and\n\n147\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.150\nthe concepts of ITIL foundation.\n\n148\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.273\nAnd then in the lifecycle modules,\n\n149\n00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:45.679\nwe're looking at implementing those\nprocesses contained within ITIL.\n\n150\n00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:50.937\nAnd in capability, we're looking at\nactually undertaking those processes and\n\n151\n00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:52.802\nmanaging those processes.\n\n152\n00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:55.330\nWho is managing across the life cycle?\n\n153\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.890\nThis is for senior management.\n\n154\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.190\nThis is at CIO level and\nat senior management level, and\n\n155\n00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.905\nin as we like to abbreviate it to.\n\n156\n00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:10.165\nYour concern with leading\nIT service management.\n\n157\n00:11:10.165 --> 00:11:14.818\nSo I mentioned, right,\nat the very beginning of all of this,\n\n158\n00:11:14.818 --> 00:11:20.466\nthat we had a test to go along with every\nsingle lifecycle face and there is.\n\n159\n00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:25.573\nAnd we will conducting this session\nto go all over this particular test,\n\n160\n00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:30.345\nor at least a sample of this test\njust to give you some preparation for\n\n161\n00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:32.960\nthe actual test itself.\n\n162\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.600\nSo your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually.\n\n163\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.120\nIt is an eight multiple\nchoice question test, okay?\n\n164\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.390\nIt's complex multiple choice.\n\n165\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.440\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test, and\n\n166\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.840\nwith every single question,\nyou will be given a scenario and\n\n167\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.270\nthen you will be given\nfour possible options,\n\n168\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.660\nfour possible answers for the question\nthat is posed along with that scenario.\n\n169\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.920\nYou get five points for\nthe best fit answer.\n\n170\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.730\nNow mentions out there are the most.\n\n171\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.667\nI always call it the best fit,\nbecause every single question asks what\n\n172\n00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:19.030\nis the best answer given the scenario and\ngiven the question?\n\n173\n00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:25.168\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct,\n\n174\n00:12:25.168 --> 00:12:29.152\nbecause the question is asking you for\nthe best fit.\n\n175\n00:12:29.152 --> 00:12:32.990\nAnd for that best fit,\nyou're gonna get five points.\n\n176\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.732\nFor the next best fit,\nyou're gonna get three.\n\n177\n00:12:35.732 --> 00:12:40.204\nFor the next one, which we've\nconsidered to be the least correct,\n\n178\n00:12:40.204 --> 00:12:41.783\nyou're gonna get one.\n\n179\n00:12:41.783 --> 00:12:45.050\nAnd for the next one,\nyou're gonna get a zero.\n\n180\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:50.110\nNow it mentions up on that slide there\nthat the next one is zero marks for\n\n181\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.020\nincorrect.\n\n182\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:56.490\nWe like to call that in the industry us\nin the know we call that the distractor.\n\n183\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.600\nAnd we call it the distractor for\na reason, cuz it distracts.\n\n184\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.215\nAnd quite often what you will find is with\nyour distractor a lot of the words and\n\n185\n00:13:05.215 --> 00:13:08.907\nthe terminology that are taken\nstraight out of the ITIL book,\n\n186\n00:13:08.907 --> 00:13:13.309\nstraight out of the publications, and\nour input into that zero pointed.\n\n187\n00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:17.122\nBecause it's there to distract,\nand it sounds great.\n\n188\n00:13:17.122 --> 00:13:21.825\nBut more often than not,\nthat distractor has no\n\n189\n00:13:21.825 --> 00:13:26.600\nrelevance to the scenario or\nto the question.\n\n190\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.390\nSo you have to be incredibly\ncareful with that.\n\n191\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.480\nIt's so easy to be distracted.\n\n192\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.270\nYou have to get 28 out of a possible\n40 in order to be able to pass,\n\n193\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.660\nand achieve accreditation at\nany lifecycle test, okay?\n\n194\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.960\nIf English is not your first language, you\nare allowed a paper dictionary, but you\n\n195\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.650\nwill be ask to show that to the proctor\nat that time that you take the test.\n\n196\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:02.410\nAnd as I've already said, you have to\nhave an ITIL foundation in version 3 or\n\n197\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:09.459\nversion 3 2011, or an ITIL version\n2 foundation bridge to version 3.\n\n198\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.940\nI will be very, very honest with you.\n\n199\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.500\nThere are not that many people that\nhave attained the version 2 to\n\n200\n00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.520\nversion 3 bridge, and\nmost people will have the version 3 or\n\n201\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.800\n2011, ITIL foundation certificate.\n\n202\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.730\nYou will be required to\nupload that certificate to\n\n203\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.510\nthe examining board prior to\nCT in your lifecycle test.\n\n204\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.430\nSo be prepared with that.\n\n205\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.590\nYou will need to have it to hand and\nsave as a PDF as well.\n\n206\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:50.160\nSo when we come to the end of\nevery single life cycle class,\n\n207\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.420\nwe will be going over, and\nthis one's no exception.\n\n208\n00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.410\nWe'll be going over a sample test for you.\n\n209\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.670\nAnd during that sample test,\nI'll be giving you lots of hints and\n\n210\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.150\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n211\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.300\nAnd also, how to ensure that you read\nthe full question, how to relax and\n\n212\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.740\nto make sure that you approach\nit with an open mind.\n\n213\n00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.100\nBut you consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n214\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.321\nUltimately, we wanna get you past\nthe test just as much as you want\n\n215\n00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:24.738\nto achieve that accreditation.\n\n216\n00:15:24.738 --> 00:15:30.473\nSo just to sum up what we will be\ndoing over the next few shows,\n\n217\n00:15:30.473 --> 00:15:37.231\nis encouraging you to take your ITIL\nlifecycle intermediate classes.\n\n218\n00:15:37.231 --> 00:15:41.685\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n219\n00:15:41.685 --> 00:15:45.954\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:07.999\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:12.263\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:15.783\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:20.760\nYou're watching an ITIL Foundation\nRefresher for your intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.770\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.390\nAnd we're about to get started here with\nour maestro in ITIL, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.820\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.260\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie,\nI'm pleased to be here, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.190\n&gt;&gt; We are doing great today, Jo.\n\n12\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.030\nAs we begin, we understand that\nfoundations pretty much set the tone for\n\n13\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.570\neverything that we'll be\ntaking a look at here.\n\n14\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.840\nSo having this refresher at this\npoint in our class that we're doing\n\n15\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.790\nis gonna be a great opportunity for us to\nmake sure we submit those concepts down.\n\n16\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.790\nSo where are we gonna begin, Jo?\n\n17\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so what we're doing today in this\nparticular session is we're going to\n\n18\n00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.530\nbe going over what everyone learned\nduring the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n19\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.120\nYou see, we cover lots and lots of topics\nin every single intermediate class.\n\n20\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.800\nWhether it be the Lifecycle classes,\nwhich the service operation is one.\n\n21\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.690\nOr whether it be the Capability classes,\nsuch as Release Control Validation, etc.\n\n22\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.130\nOr even through to the MALC class,\nthe Managing across the Lifecycle, or\n\n23\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.430\nthe ITIL Practitioner class.\n\n24\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.584\nWe need to understand that foundation\nmaterial because it's foundation [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:27.584 --> 00:01:30.438\nand it is the foundation for\nall of our other material.\n\n26\n00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:32.895\nNow, in our foundation class in ITIL,\n\n27\n00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:37.290\nwe learn all of the terminology\nthat's associated with ITIL.\n\n28\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.610\nThere are over 75 terms and\ndefinitions in the ITIL Foundation class.\n\n29\n00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.723\nAnd I'll be honest with you, sometimes,\n\n30\n00:01:44.723 --> 00:01:47.470\nthe ITIL Foundation class can\nbe a little bit daunting.\n\n31\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.175\nCertainly, the feedback that you get\nfrom a lot of delegates [LAUGH] watching\n\n32\n00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:56.219\nITIL Foundation is that they feel\nlike their brains are full [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.770\nafter the end of the first day.\n\n34\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.140\nSo what we're going to do, really, and\n\n35\n00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.040\nwe do this at the start of every\nsingle intermediate class.\n\n36\n00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.620\nIs we will just go over\nthe foundation principles\n\n37\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.080\njust to refresh them in everybody's mind.\n\n38\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.828\nAnd then to act as a basis for\n\n39\n00:02:11.828 --> 00:02:15.482\nwhat we're going to cover\nover the following sessions.\n\n40\n00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:20.026\nAnd so here, what we're going to do\nover the next few sessions is we\n\n41\n00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:23.380\nare going to go over\nthe ITIL Foundation itself.\n\n42\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.520\nAnd we're going to go over\nthe concept of the lifecycle, etc.\n\n43\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.436\nAnd we're going to be going over,\nas I say, the foundation material.\n\n44\n00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:34.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, and\nthis is the best time to get started.\n\n45\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.564\nSo let's go ahead and do that,\nwhere are we beginning?\n\n46\n00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:40.229\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the first thing\nthat we are going to do, and\n\n47\n00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.692\nyou saw the slide flash out very,\nvery quickly on the screen there.\n\n48\n00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:48.930\nAnd let's take a look at that\nfirst particular slide there.\n\n49\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.830\nIt says here,\nITIL is presented in five CORE volumes\n\n50\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.740\nthat are referred to as\nthe Service Lifecycle.\n\n51\n00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.910\nLet's take a step back.\n\n52\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.420\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n53\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.460\n&gt;&gt; That's what I want to do.\n\n54\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.990\nLet's just think about the fact\nthat a service, an IT service,\n\n55\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.450\nand we're gonna come into the definition\nof a service very shortly.\n\n56\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.210\nBut a service, well,\nit has a beginning and it has an end.\n\n57\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.410\nIt starts off as an idea,\nthese things don't just happen.\n\n58\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.075\nYou don't just walk in and\nall of a sudden,\n\n59\n00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:20.030\neverything is there [LAUGH]\non your laptop, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.127\nAny new service, well,\nit has an idea or any service.\n\n61\n00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:26.570\nAnd then that idea has\ngot to be developed.\n\n62\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.330\nIt's gotta be designed, first of all,\nthen it gets developed.\n\n63\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.690\nAnd then it gets tested,\nand then it gets deployed.\n\n64\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.010\nAnd then it's put into\nthe live environment.\n\n65\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.790\nAnd then we're continually checking that\nservice to make sure that it's doing what\n\n66\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.080\nit's supposed to do.\n\n67\n00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.510\nAnd eventually,\nthat service will be retired.\n\n68\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.530\nSo we refer to that as\nthe life of the service.\n\n69\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.360\nAnd that's the concept of the lifecycle,\nis the fact that we understand\n\n70\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.520\nthe concept, that not just all about\nservices, but also IT as a whole.\n\n71\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.679\nWell, any process starts off as an idea.\n\n72\n00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:04.424\n[LAUGH] And then it's designed,\nand then developed,\n\n73\n00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:07.010\nand then built, and then transitioned.\n\n74\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.660\nAnd put into a live environment, and then\nwe wanna continually improve it, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.558\nAnd it's the same with\nany organization and\n\n76\n00:04:15.558 --> 00:04:19.717\nwith any IT service provider,\nit starts off as an idea, yeah?\n\n77\n00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:22.210\nThings have to start off with a concept,\nokay?\n\n78\n00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.032\nSo what we have is the concept\nof a service lifecycle, and\n\n79\n00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:29.350\nwe've split it into five.\n\n80\n00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.850\nAnd in the first book, and\nwe call them core publications or\n\n81\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.217\nbooks because there's a book for\neach lifecycle phase.\n\n82\n00:04:36.217 --> 00:04:38.870\nAnd we start off with service strategy.\n\n83\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.570\nAnd then that's where our ideas come from,\nin service strategy.\n\n84\n00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.210\nThis is where we go back to the business\nand we understand what our business needs,\n\n85\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.880\nhow our business works, and\nhow we can add value to our business.\n\n86\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.969\nAnd then, in service design,\nwe then take that idea that we've\n\n87\n00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.606\ncome out within service strategy and\nwe design that idea.\n\n88\n00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:07.750\nThis is not where we develop,\nthis is where we design the idea.\n\n89\n00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.230\nAnd then, in service transition,\nthis is where we do the development and\n\n90\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.850\nwe do build and the test and\nthe deployment of our new services.\n\n91\n00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.660\nAnd then we deploy them into\nthe live service operation.\n\n92\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.520\nAnd then on a regular basis,\nwe want to continually improve.\n\n93\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.860\nSo while I'm looking at this next slide,\nand it'll show you the processes\n\n94\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.850\nwithin the next slide, I wanna bring\nin a different concept for you.\n\n95\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.140\nI wanna take you just out of IT for\na moment.\n\n96\n00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.880\nBecause in service strategy,\nI said, we come up with the idea.\n\n97\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.005\nAnd we have processes in service strategy\nsuch as financial management, and\n\n98\n00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:46.449\nbusiness relationship management, and\nstrategy management where we come up with\n\n99\n00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.185\nthose ideas and\nmake sure we've got enough money.\n\n100\n00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:54.022\nAnd then in service design, we have things\nlike service level management that work\n\n101\n00:05:54.022 --> 00:05:57.630\nout our targets for\nhow we're going to deliver that service.\n\n102\n00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.310\nSo this is still in design, and\nthen design and availability and\n\n103\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.745\ncapacity and continuity, etc.\n\n104\n00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:07.546\nAnd we've got supplier\nmanagement in there too.\n\n105\n00:06:07.546 --> 00:06:11.757\nNow, let's take this out of IT, as I said.\n\n106\n00:06:11.757 --> 00:06:13.310\nLet's say, we were building a house.\n\n107\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.949\nNow, I know I've got grand ideas,\nI can tell you know.\n\n108\n00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.920\nI know that what I want is I\nwant a five bedroom, yeah,\n\n109\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.520\nI reckon that'll be enough.\n\n110\n00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.925\nBut I want six bathrooms cuz\nI need one bathroom just for\n\n111\n00:06:27.925 --> 00:06:29.602\nguests that are visiting for the day.\n\n112\n00:06:29.602 --> 00:06:34.666\n&gt;&gt; Not that anybody ever visits me, but\nnevertheless, I want six bathrooms, okay.\n\n113\n00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:39.574\nAnd I don't think I need a swimming pool,\nbut I wouldn't mind having a dedicated\n\n114\n00:06:39.574 --> 00:06:44.665\noffice just for me that was soundproof,\nthat I could work in, that would be great.\n\n115\n00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:46.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's what I want.\n\n116\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.630\nSo what I did in service strategy\nis I go to the bank and I say,\n\n117\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.560\ncan I have some money?\n\n118\n00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.480\nOkay, I've got this idea,\ncan I have some money please?\n\n119\n00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.210\nAnd here's my idea, and\nthis is what happens in service strategy.\n\n120\n00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.318\nAt the end of service strategy,\nthe bank says, yeah, here you go, have,\n\n121\n00:07:03.318 --> 00:07:06.070\nI don't know, $500,000, there we go.\n\n122\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.471\nSo now, what do I do?\n\n123\n00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:09.770\nWhat do I do with that $500,000,\ndo you reckon?\n\n124\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.425\n&gt;&gt; You'd take that money and\n\n125\n00:07:14.425 --> 00:07:18.905\nthen you would either have it\ndesigned to be ready to build.\n\n126\n00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.895\n&gt;&gt; Right, so now, I go to an architect.\n\n127\n00:07:20.895 --> 00:07:25.698\nAnd so this is what's happening here in\nservice design is I go to an architect and\n\n128\n00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:28.727\nI say, okay, please,\ncan you design me a house.\n\n129\n00:07:28.727 --> 00:07:30.720\nThere are my prerequisites.\n\n130\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.072\nAnd generally, you know what?\n\n131\n00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:36.620\nWell, I'm a customer, I'm not a builder.\n\n132\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.790\nSo I don't know anything about materials.\n\n133\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.470\nBut what I do know is [LAUGH] that I've\ngot some very specific requirements.\n\n134\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.880\nAnd probably, because I'm a little bit\nstrange, they're incredibly specific.\n\n135\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.778\nSo I'm gonna go to him and I'm gonna\nsay to him, I want five bedrooms, and\n\n136\n00:07:50.778 --> 00:07:52.280\nI want six bathrooms.\n\n137\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.600\nAnd I want my own sort of soundproofed\noffice where I still want a window in it.\n\n138\n00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.496\nI like daylight, but then at the same\ntime, I don't want any noise coming in.\n\n139\n00:07:59.496 --> 00:08:04.288\nAnd I want bathrooms and\nI wanna have marble in the bathrooms,\n\n140\n00:08:04.288 --> 00:08:08.313\nand This is everything\nthat I want in my kitchen.\n\n141\n00:08:08.313 --> 00:08:11.701\nI've got to have one of those\nrefrigerators with the TV screen in it.\n\n142\n00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:14.310\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you now it's got to have\n\n143\n00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.360\none of those.\n\n144\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.130\nAnd I want a camera in every room.\n\n145\n00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.500\nAnd I want at least 2,\nmaybe 3, routers in there.\n\n146\n00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.020\nAnd I want everything to be wireless.\n\n147\n00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.870\nAnd I want everything hidden in the walls.\n\n148\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.278\nI don't wanna see any of this technology.\n\n149\n00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:29.570\nI told you I was picky.\n\n150\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.239\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go to the architect and\n\n151\n00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:34.764\nI'm gonna tell him all of this.\n\n152\n00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.225\nAnd he is going to produce a blueprint.\n\n153\n00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:41.943\nBut here's something special\nabout that blueprint, and\n\n154\n00:08:41.943 --> 00:08:45.898\nthat blueprint is not just\ngoing to be the plans.\n\n155\n00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:50.400\nThe two dimensional plans for that house.\n\n156\n00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.470\nWhat that architect is going to deliver me\n\n157\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.780\nis a three dimensional mock up of what\nthat house is going to look like.\n\n158\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.030\nHe's going to include all of the plans for\nall of the plumbing.\n\n159\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.430\nFor all of the electric, for\nall of the IT wiring that I want,\n\n160\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:12.320\nhe's going to include all of the lists\nof contractors that his going to use.\n\n161\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.860\nYou know, those suppliers.\n\n162\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.039\nHe's going to tell me exactly what tiles\nare going to be used in the bathroom.\n\n163\n00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:21.835\nHe's going to tell me exactly where\nhe's going to purchase almost\n\n164\n00:09:21.835 --> 00:09:26.670\nthe furniture from,\nI didn't mention furniture, did I?\n\n165\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.070\nHe's gonna tell me where he's gonna\n\n166\n00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.830\npurchase everything like even\nthe bed sheets and everything from,\n\n167\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.780\nhe's going to even tell me what color\nthe bed sheets are going to be.\n\n168\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.196\nThis is not just any blueprint,\nthis is what I call and\n\n169\n00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:44.526\nwhat we call in ITIL\na service design package.\n\n170\n00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:48.817\nAnd that service design package contains\n\n171\n00:09:48.817 --> 00:09:54.091\nabsolutely everything\nthat's needed to build and\n\n172\n00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:59.030\nto test and to deploy and\nthen to run that house.\n\n173\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.500\nThat service design package even includes\nall of the instruction manuals for\n\n174\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.870\nfor all of the appliances and everything\nelse that I've got in that house.\n\n175\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.460\nThat's what's in that\nservice design package.\n\n176\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.351\nSo we think of it as\na architect's blueprint but\n\n177\n00:10:11.351 --> 00:10:13.635\nhere in ITIL we think of it as\nthe service design package.\n\n178\n00:10:13.635 --> 00:10:19.030\nAnd this is why we've got all of\nthose processes in service design.\n\n179\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.840\nAnd then what happens is we hand\nthat over to service transition.\n\n180\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.070\nWe hand it over to the builder okay?\n\n181\n00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.890\nTo the contractors and\nwe let them come and do their work.\n\n182\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.536\nAnd they do the build, and the test, and\n\n183\n00:10:30.536 --> 00:10:32.435\ntake a look at all of\nthose processes in there.\n\n184\n00:10:32.435 --> 00:10:35.922\nThey understand with that certain\nconfiguration management,\n\n185\n00:10:35.922 --> 00:10:40.249\nexactly what the wiring is going to look\nlike and how it's going to hang together\n\n186\n00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:44.336\ncuz the last thing you need is me trying\nto put a TV up on that wall over there.\n\n187\n00:10:44.336 --> 00:10:49.170\nMe asking for TV on that wall up there,\nand you can't because it's a solid brick\n\n188\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.085\nwall, because I wanted it in brick red,\nor the external walls.\n\n189\n00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:55.591\nAnd so the TV can't go on there,\nit's gotta go on that wall.\n\n190\n00:10:55.591 --> 00:10:59.305\nSo I said configuration management\ntells me how everything's going to hang\n\n191\n00:10:59.305 --> 00:11:00.540\ntogether.\n\n192\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.260\nSo here in service transition\nwe do all the build.\n\n193\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.903\nAnd at the end of service transition\nwhat happens is I'm the customer and\n\n194\n00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:14.451\nsomebody hands over the keys to me and\nI walk in that house.\n\n195\n00:11:14.451 --> 00:11:20.283\nAnd I open up the refrigerator, the one\nthat was designed in service design,\n\n196\n00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:25.218\nI get out that bottle of wine that\nwas designed in service design,\n\n197\n00:11:25.218 --> 00:11:28.380\nbut it's been nicely chilled right now.\n\n198\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.357\nAnd I go to the cupboard in the kitchen\nwhere I said I wanted my glasses\n\n199\n00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:31.889\nto be kept.\n\n200\n00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:35.879\nAnd they put the right glasses in the\nright cupboard and I take out a glass and\n\n201\n00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:36.714\nI pour my wine.\n\n202\n00:11:36.714 --> 00:11:42.070\nAnd I walk over to the couch,\nthat I told service design that I wanted.\n\n203\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.980\nAnd sit in front of the TV with my\nglass of wine I pick up the controls\n\n204\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.750\nbecause they're in the remote control\nare next to the instruction manual and\n\n205\n00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:57.650\nI just sit back and I watch TV because\nall of my services are in place.\n\n206\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.680\nI've got my contracts in place with\nthe TV company and with the Internet,\n\n207\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.810\netc, and so now I'm into what\nwe call service operation,\n\n208\n00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.270\nwhich is just business as usual.\n\n209\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.880\nAnd business as usual is where,\n\n210\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.580\nwell, I just carry on living in\nmy house without any problems.\n\n211\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.420\nOkay, that's not going to happen, right?\n\n212\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.740\nWe know that there\nare going to be problems.\n\n213\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.285\nAnd so during service operation,\n\n214\n00:12:21.285 --> 00:12:26.726\nthen I'm going to have systems that\nare going to monitor Internet usage,\n\n215\n00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:31.065\nand systems that are going to\nmonitor what TV that I watch.\n\n216\n00:12:31.065 --> 00:12:36.180\nAnd I set DVRs, etc, and\nthen if anything does go wrong,\n\n217\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.220\nI've got contractor, etc, that I can call\nif anything goes wrong in the house.\n\n218\n00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.120\nThat's Incident and Problem Management I\nknow who to call if I want something new.\n\n219\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.643\nIf I want an upgrade for instance.\n\n220\n00:12:46.643 --> 00:12:52.359\nBut then, in continual service improvement\nwe're continually assessing that,\n\n221\n00:12:52.359 --> 00:12:55.790\nyou what, the showers remain water tight.\n\n222\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.579\nThat the refrigerator is at\nthe right level of technology,\n\n223\n00:12:58.579 --> 00:12:59.821\nbecause I do like my toys.\n\n224\n00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:04.800\n[LAUGH] And so\nwe're continually improving that house.\n\n225\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.703\nBecause lets face it, you don't live with\nthe same decor for ten years, do you?\n\n226\n00:13:08.703 --> 00:13:11.560\nAnd this is what happens.\n\n227\n00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.650\nSo from an IT perspective,\n\n228\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.740\nservice strategy is where\nwe come up with the idea.\n\n229\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.720\nAnd where are we going to the bank for\nmoney and\n\n230\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.320\nservice design is where we design\neverything including our testing,\n\n231\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.500\nour training and\ndesign how we're going to operate.\n\n232\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.830\nAnd service transition we build it and\nwe test it,\n\n233\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:35.530\nwe deploy it in an operation, we manage\nthose service on an ongoing basis.\n\n234\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.460\nAnd in continue with service\nimprovement we continue\n\n235\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.509\nto ensure that our services are aligned\nto the needs of the organization.\n\n236\n00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:48.503\nIn other words, that they're\nexactly what we want to see for\n\n237\n00:13:48.503 --> 00:13:53.140\nthe organization at that point in time.\n\n238\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.790\nYeah, because things change, needs change.\n\n239\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.460\nSo that's quite a lot there,\njust to take in, just on one slide.\n\n240\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.970\nSo now we're gonna look a little\na little bit more in depth.\n\n241\n00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.709\nAnd this is where I say,\nyou know sometimes everybody doesn't need\n\n242\n00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:10.362\na refresher from foundation because\nwe've gotta a lot to learn.\n\n243\n00:14:10.362 --> 00:14:13.195\nSo, let's a take a look then.\n\n244\n00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:16.210\nI talked about services and\nabout the idea of a service.\n\n245\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.250\nSo what is a service?\n\n246\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.580\nWell, the definition of a service\nis up there in blue, okay?\n\n247\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.880\nAnd the ITIL definition of a service from\nthe publications, the service is a means\n\n248\n00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.700\nof delivering value to the customers\nby facilitating the outcomes that\n\n249\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.370\nthey want to achieve without the ownership\nof specific costs and risks.\n\n250\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.723\nSeems like a mouthful, doesn't it?\n\n251\n00:14:36.723 --> 00:14:39.707\nLet me break it down then okay.\n\n252\n00:14:39.707 --> 00:14:43.309\nA service is a means of\ndelivering value and\n\n253\n00:14:43.309 --> 00:14:48.022\nthat's the first challenge,\ncuz value is perceived.\n\n254\n00:14:48.022 --> 00:14:50.794\nIf I was to go out and buy a car,\nif I were to go out and\n\n255\n00:14:50.794 --> 00:14:54.765\nbuy a car, Well, Ronnie,\nlet me ask you a question.\n\n256\n00:14:54.765 --> 00:14:55.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n257\n00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.160\n&gt;&gt; If you were to go out and\nbuy a car right now,\n\n258\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.650\nbearing in mind that I'm looking at\nthis definition of a service, and\n\n259\n00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:09.940\na service is a means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating outcomes.\n\n260\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.230\nSo the outcome of a car that we wanna\nfacilitate is to get from A to B, right?\n\n261\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.153\nThat's the outcome.\n\n262\n00:15:15.153 --> 00:15:20.380\nSo if you were to go and buy a car,\nwhat would you look for in a car?\n\n263\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.156\n&gt;&gt; If it's just to facilitate A to B?\n\n264\n00:15:23.156 --> 00:15:23.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n265\n00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:30.590\n&gt;&gt; It would probably be a small and\neconomical car that's a manual driven car.\n\n266\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n267\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.643\nYou see where as me,\nI come from Europe you know,\n\n268\n00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:39.250\nwe have roads with no speed limit on them.\n\n269\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.060\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n270\n00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.122\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I want something quick,\nI want something that's going to handle,\n\n271\n00:15:44.122 --> 00:15:47.637\nI want something that's going\nto lose me my licence, probably.\n\n272\n00:15:47.637 --> 00:15:50.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I want something that's\n\n273\n00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:56.791\nyeah, I'm with you on the manual, yeah,\nso I can handle it around corners.\n\n274\n00:15:56.791 --> 00:15:59.286\nYeah, I'm gonna get myself into trouble.\n\n275\n00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:01.089\n[LAUGH] But ultimately,\n\n276\n00:16:01.089 --> 00:16:05.967\nwhat I value is completely\ndifferent to what you value, right?\n\n277\n00:16:05.967 --> 00:16:09.350\n&gt;&gt; And given the limitation of what you\nsaid, just to get from A to B, yes.\n\n278\n00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.930\nBut if I wanted to take that car and\n\n279\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.308\ndo other things with it,\nI might have chosen the same thing.\n\n280\n00:16:13.308 --> 00:16:15.627\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n281\n00:16:15.627 --> 00:16:17.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n282\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.426\nI still like-\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n283\n00:16:18.426 --> 00:16:20.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I still like to get from A to B fast,\n\n284\n00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.411\nyou know?\n\n285\n00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:23.265\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n\n286\n00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:26.580\n&gt;&gt; You see the thing is that we know the\noutcome that we want to facilitate, but\n\n287\n00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.640\nwe all have a different\nperception of value.\n\n288\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n289\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.620\n&gt;&gt; That's our first challenge straight\naway, is a means of delivering value.\n\n290\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.090\nAnd you can say, okay then well put\nthis in the business perspective.\n\n291\n00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.590\nAnd actually that's not\ntoo bad cuz everybody\n\n292\n00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.910\nvalues the same thing in business.\n\n293\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.900\nThat's not true at all.\n\n294\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.080\nWhat desktop picture do you\nhave on your laptop, Travis?\n\n295\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.000\nIs it the one that you were given when\nyou were first given that laptop?\n\n296\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.090\n&gt;&gt; Probably yes.\n\n297\n00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.450\n&gt;&gt; It is, right, okay,\n\n298\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.260\nI can tell you that this one isn't,\nbecause we are all changing.\n\n299\n00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.860\nWe all customize our desktop, and so\n\n300\n00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.000\nto say all that's okay in business\nwe'll value the same thing, we don't.\n\n301\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:09.575\nWe don't.\n\n302\n00:17:09.575 --> 00:17:12.020\nI take a look at my keyboard right now.\n\n303\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.190\nAnd my keyboard, even though we\nhave exactly the same laptop,\n\n304\n00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.160\nmy keyboard looks completely\ndifferent to yours.\n\n305\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.060\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n306\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Because we both value\nthe different things.\n\n307\n00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.790\nYou like yours exactly how\nit came out of the box,\n\n308\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.235\nwhere as I like mine completely different.\n\n309\n00:17:28.235 --> 00:17:32.650\n[LAUGH] Completely different,\nwe got to be a little bit colorful here.\n\n310\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:38.510\nSo even in a business perspective,\nwe don't have the same concept of value.\n\n311\n00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.890\nWhat we can do though, we can understand\nthat we're delivering value to customers.\n\n312\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.090\nAnd that in itself can\nbe a challenge okay,\n\n313\n00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.550\nbecause a customer is\nsomebody who buys a service.\n\n314\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:55.330\nNot a user,\na user is somebody who uses a service.\n\n315\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.266\nSo let me ask you a question,\ncuz I wanna ask you a lot of questions.\n\n316\n00:18:01.266 --> 00:18:02.110\n&gt;&gt; That's fine.\n\n317\n00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:05.290\n&gt;&gt; When was the last time you\nwent into a coffee shop and\n\n318\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.350\nbought a drink for someone?\n\n319\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.445\n&gt;&gt; The last time?\n\n320\n00:18:10.445 --> 00:18:12.143\nIt was probably close to two years ago.\n\n321\n00:18:12.143 --> 00:18:12.964\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n322\n00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:13.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n323\n00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.930\nwhen you're going to that coffee shop and\nyou buy somebody a drink.\n\n324\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.650\nThe person behind the counter,\nare they interested in\n\n325\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.410\nwhat you value or rather interested in\nthat person that you bought the drink for?\n\n326\n00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.670\nDo they care whether they\nlike the drink or not?\n\n327\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.455\n&gt;&gt; I would assume that they would care,\nbut maybe they don't,\n\n328\n00:18:33.455 --> 00:18:35.130\nmaybe they just wanna sell it.\n\n329\n00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Right, see, there's an assumption.\n\n330\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.818\nBecause if you see,\nif you think about it from a user and\n\n331\n00:18:41.818 --> 00:18:43.780\ncustomer perspective, okay.\n\n332\n00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.956\nIf I take somebody into a coffee shop and\nI buy them a drink, I expect that\n\n333\n00:18:48.956 --> 00:18:54.760\nthat coffee shop is probably only gonna\ncare about getting that money out of me.\n\n334\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.301\nAnd not care about whether\nthe person I bought a drink for\n\n335\n00:18:58.301 --> 00:18:59.965\nis going to like it or not.\n\n336\n00:18:59.965 --> 00:19:03.115\nBut the simple fact is that if\nthe person that I bought the drink for\n\n337\n00:19:03.115 --> 00:19:05.976\ndoesn't like it,\nthen they're gonna turn around to me and\n\n338\n00:19:05.976 --> 00:19:08.380\nsay, well,\nwe're not going back there again.\n\n339\n00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.390\nI don't like that place.\n\n340\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:15.934\nSo users influence customer's decisions.\n\n341\n00:19:15.934 --> 00:19:18.861\nSo even though we want to\ndeliver value to customers,\n\n342\n00:19:18.861 --> 00:19:22.970\nwe're actually really concerned with\nvalue perception of the users too.\n\n343\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.700\nRight.\n\n344\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.615\n&gt;&gt; Because if that person\nthat I bought a drink for\n\n345\n00:19:28.615 --> 00:19:33.792\ndidn't like it then we're not going back\nthere, cuz I don't wanna listen to it.\n\n346\n00:19:33.792 --> 00:19:36.600\n[LAUGH] So\nyeah we're not going back there.\n\n347\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.710\nSo we talked then about\ndelivering value to customers.\n\n348\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:45.540\nNot forgetting owners by facilitating\nthe outcomes that they want to achieve,\n\n349\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.870\nfacilitating the outcomes.\n\n350\n00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.390\nWe cannot achieve that outcomes for them,\nthey have got put some input into this.\n\n351\n00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.400\nSo we want to facilitate outcomes.\n\n352\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.872\nSo we're not going to type your emails for\nyou, we can't do that, okay?\n\n353\n00:20:00.872 --> 00:20:04.370\nWhat we can do is we can give you\nthe ability to send and receive email.\n\n354\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.681\nBut you could type out that yourself and\nyou've got to send that email and\n\n355\n00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:10.218\nyou've got to read\nthe emails that come in.\n\n356\n00:20:10.218 --> 00:20:13.170\nSo we're gonna do all of that for you.\n\n357\n00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:17.240\nBut then we want to facilitate\nthat outcome for you.\n\n358\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:23.330\nBut without transferring to\nyou specific costs and risks.\n\n359\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.180\nA service is made up of components.\n\n360\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.880\nAnd out of those components, we consider\nthings like software and hardware,\n\n361\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.190\nand environmental aspects, and\nthe people that support the service.\n\n362\n00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.720\nAnd the people that implement the service,\nand the infrastructure, and\n\n363\n00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.270\nthe documentation as well.\n\n364\n00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.059\nThese are all components of a service.\n\n365\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.480\nNow without any single one of those\ncomponents, that service would not exist.\n\n366\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:52.060\nBut if you consider that we\nwould have to actually work out\n\n367\n00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.835\nthe specific cost of each one of those\ncomponents to each individual customer,\n\n368\n00:20:56.835 --> 00:20:59.165\nfor each individual service.\n\n369\n00:20:59.165 --> 00:21:00.235\nThat's a lot of effort.\n\n370\n00:21:00.235 --> 00:21:00.855\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n371\n00:21:00.855 --> 00:21:03.945\nwhen I'm gonna transfer those specific\ncosts to you, we might charge you\n\n372\n00:21:03.945 --> 00:21:07.455\na nominal fee, but we're not gonna\ntransfer the specific cost to you.\n\n373\n00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:12.182\nAnd so, the same reason we're not\ngonna transfer specific risks to you.\n\n374\n00:21:12.182 --> 00:21:16.002\nIdeally what we want to do is deliver\na service that's going to allow you to\n\n375\n00:21:16.002 --> 00:21:17.842\nimprove your performance.\n\n376\n00:21:17.842 --> 00:21:24.125\nAnd reduce any constraints that you might\nfeel whilst achieving that outcome.\n\n377\n00:21:24.125 --> 00:21:27.450\nAnd that outcome being as it says there,\nthe intended or\n\n378\n00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:33.180\nactual result of carrying out an activity\nover on the right hand side of that slide.\n\n379\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.221\nSo what about service management then?\n\n380\n00:21:35.221 --> 00:21:40.135\nWell, service management, which is ideal\nas a framework for service management.\n\n381\n00:21:40.135 --> 00:21:44.855\nService management is a set of specialized\norganizational capabilities for providing\n\n382\n00:21:44.855 --> 00:21:49.465\nvalue to customers in the form of goods or\nservices, as it says in the ideal books.\n\n383\n00:21:52.065 --> 00:21:53.910\nThere's a couple of words\nI wanna bring out there.\n\n384\n00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.800\nAnd that is specialized,\norganizational, capability.\n\n385\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.850\nAll right, three words.\n\n386\n00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.430\nNot a couple.\n\n387\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.090\nSo we've gotta have the specialism.\n\n388\n00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.970\nIn other words,\nwe don't just need broad experience.\n\n389\n00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:09.610\nWe need specialist experience.\n\n390\n00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.200\nWe also need to be organized.\n\n391\n00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.910\nYet if we're disorganized,\n\n392\n00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.025\nif there is absolute chaos going\non in our IT organization,\n\n393\n00:22:18.025 --> 00:22:22.880\nthen unfortunately it's not an IT\norganization, it's an IT disorganization.\n\n394\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.590\nAnd we're never gonna deliver value.\n\n395\n00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.820\nBut we've got to be capable too.\n\n396\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:32.410\nYet we've got to have the right\ncapabilities to be able to deliver those\n\n397\n00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:32.990\nservices.\n\n398\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.700\nSo we've got to take what we\nconsider to be our asset.\n\n399\n00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.990\nOur resources and our capabilities and\n\n400\n00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:47.560\ntransform them Into something that\nwill deliver valuable services.\n\n401\n00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.220\nOur tangible capabilities, our resources\nare things that we can touch and feel.\n\n402\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.320\nSo things like money, something tangible.\n\n403\n00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.450\nA hardware is something tangible.\n\n404\n00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.660\nA software is something tangible.\n\n405\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.570\nAnd people in terms of bums on\nseats are tangible as well.\n\n406\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.770\nThese are things that we can touch and\nfeel.\n\n407\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.940\nDon't go touching and feeling people too\nmuch though or you'll end up in court,\n\n408\n00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.622\nall right?\n\n409\n00:23:11.622 --> 00:23:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, true.\n&gt;&gt; Just a warning on that one.\n\n410\n00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.320\n[LAUGH] And\nthen we've got our capabilities too,\n\n411\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.110\nbecause we can't just have bums on seats,\nas we would call it.\n\n412\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.030\nThey've gotta have the right skills.\n\n413\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.170\nAnd so our capabilities encompass\nthings like intangible assets,\n\n414\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.450\nthings that we have to have that\nare an asset to the organization.\n\n415\n00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.322\nBut they're not very, very difficult\nto quantify such as experience,\n\n416\n00:23:34.322 --> 00:23:38.010\nsuch as the way that we're organized,\neven who our management are.\n\n417\n00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:43.542\nIf our management are, how should I say,\nif they're disorganized themselves or\n\n418\n00:23:43.542 --> 00:23:47.968\nperhaps we've got interpersonal\nconflict in some of our teams.\n\n419\n00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:53.940\nThen we're not going to be able to\ndeliver efficient and effective services.\n\n420\n00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.865\nSo service management is\nall about implementing and\n\n421\n00:23:57.865 --> 00:24:01.030\nmanaging those quality services.\n\n422\n00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:06.970\nOkay, we have to ensure that the customer\nreceives a service that they value, and\n\n423\n00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:12.605\nthat it performs at a level that they\nexpect, and to a cost that they expect to.\n\n424\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:21.180\nSo here we are then, in IT and we are what\nis considered to be a service provider.\n\n425\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.270\nAnd we have three different\ntypes of service provider.\n\n426\n00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:29.340\nWe have a service provider that\nis internal to the business unit.\n\n427\n00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:33.850\nWe have a service provider that\noperates in a shared services unit.\n\n428\n00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:37.990\nSo internal to the organization but\nserves many business units.\n\n429\n00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:42.980\nAnd then we have a Type III as we call it\nwhich is an external service provider.\n\n430\n00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:48.180\nAnd that is somebody who is completely\nexternal, outsourced we like to say okay?\n\n431\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.530\nCompletely external to the organization.\n\n432\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.610\nSo within our service provider\norganization and within our business,\n\n433\n00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.380\nwe have what we call stakeholders.\n\n434\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:04.940\nA stakeholder is defined\nas any interested party.\n\n435\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.620\nNot just financial interest, biggest\nmistake that I think that we make here.\n\n436\n00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.330\nAlthough, I have to say that\nwe have had discussions in\n\n437\n00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.460\nother sessions about\nthe nuances between languages.\n\n438\n00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.400\nAnd there is an inference stakeholder\nin certain cultures it means somebody\n\n439\n00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.500\nhas financial interest but\nthat's not the case.\n\n440\n00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.060\nWe're talking about anybody\nthat had an interest.\n\n441\n00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.550\nI hate to say this but\n\n442\n00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.400\neven my noisy neighbor is considered\nto be a stakeholder in my life.\n\n443\n00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.775\nCuz she definitely has an interest\nin everything that we do.\n\n444\n00:25:41.775 --> 00:25:46.490\n[LAUGH] So on, we've got stakeholders\nwithin our internal service provider,\n\n445\n00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.920\nsuch as functions, these groups of people.\n\n446\n00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.470\nAnd we'll talk little bit more about\nthem and the groups and teams.\n\n447\n00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.740\nAnd we've got people outside of our\n\n448\n00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.480\nservice provider organizations such as\ncustomers, and users, and our suppliers.\n\n449\n00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.450\nAnd they're all stakeholders too, okay?\n\n450\n00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.220\nSo a stakeholder is any interested party.\n\n451\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.860\nYou'll notice that what we're doing is,\nwe're just going over a lot at the moment.\n\n452\n00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.080\nWe're going over a lot of the terms and\n\n453\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.890\nthe definitions that we learned\nin foundation class, okay?\n\n454\n00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.190\nHere's another term and\ndefinition we learned in foundation class\n\n455\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.755\nis the concept of both internal and\nexternal services.\n\n456\n00:26:25.755 --> 00:26:34.180\nAnd an internal service is a service that\nwe provide internally to our organization.\n\n457\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:39.520\nAn external service is a service that we\nprovide externally to external customers.\n\n458\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.450\nSo an internal service would be\nsomething and I use examples like SAP,\n\n459\n00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:49.020\nor like our email services is something\ninternal to our organization.\n\n460\n00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.420\nBut then an external service is\nsomething that our customers use,\n\n461\n00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:57.050\nsuch as the website for instance or\nexternal service catalog,\n\n462\n00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:02.280\nif we're in an industry where we are\nselling goods externally to our customers.\n\n463\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.080\nSo you'll see here from this\nparticular slide that over on the left\n\n464\n00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.430\nhand side Internal services\nare delivered to business units, and\n\n465\n00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.990\nthey in turn use those to deliver\na service to external customers.\n\n466\n00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:21.150\nAnd then we have on the right hand side,\nwe have services,\n\n467\n00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:26.430\nlike our Internet that are delivered\ndirect through to our external customers.\n\n468\n00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:33.180\nOn the next slide there's just really\na little bit of an example over core\n\n469\n00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:40.110\nservices, enabling services,\nand enhancing services, okay?\n\n470\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.320\nWhich is just further classification\nof our services, to be honest.\n\n471\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.480\nWe split our services down, believe it or\nnot, into those that are core,\n\n472\n00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.660\nthose that are enabling services, and\nthose that are enhancing services.\n\n473\n00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.370\nNow, we've got pizza delivery example\nup there on the screen in front of you.\n\n474\n00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.520\nI wanna give you an IT example for\ninstance.\n\n475\n00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.770\nSo let's think about our email service.\n\n476\n00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.850\nSo the core service in an email\nservice is that ability to send and\n\n477\n00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.540\nreceive email, okay?\n\n478\n00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.430\nThat's our core service.\n\n479\n00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.570\nNow the enabling service Is a service,\nthat's a service in its own right but\n\n480\n00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.620\nthat underpins the core service.\n\n481\n00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.290\nAnd that would be our infrastructure,\nit's a service in its own right.\n\n482\n00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.489\nBut without it, email is not going\nto able to be sent or received.\n\n483\n00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.950\nAnd then an enhancing\nservice is an optional extra.\n\n484\n00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:37.320\nSomething that we can do that maybe\nsets us apart from our competitors, or\n\n485\n00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.440\nsomething that we just choose to do.\n\n486\n00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.950\nIt's optional for our business.\n\n487\n00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.590\nAnd that would be something like\na shared calendar, for instance, okay?\n\n488\n00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.300\nSo something that is an optional extra,\nthat's our\n\n489\n00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.600\ndirectory shared calendar is\nthe word I'm looking for, okay?\n\n490\n00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.927\nSo these are our core, and our enabling,\nand our enhancing services.\n\n491\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.830\nNow I asked you about\nvalue a little earlier on,\n\n492\n00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.460\nand about what we perceive as value.\n\n493\n00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:14.410\nSo I'm just gonna wrap up this section\nby going over a couple of slides that\n\n494\n00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:17.250\nlook over the definition of value.\n\n495\n00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:22.310\nNow you will see that in the bottom\nof this particular slide,\n\n496\n00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:28.740\nright in front of you now, you will see\nthat the diagram that you saw in your ITIL\n\n497\n00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.350\nfoundation class, and that is that diagram\nthat always looks very, very complicated.\n\n498\n00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.250\nAnd everybody always says to me,\nhow am I supposed to remember this?\n\n499\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.710\nWell, it's really easy, because you\njust need to remember the concepts\n\n500\n00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.427\nof the utility and warranty, okay?\n\n501\n00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.970\nSo the concept of utility is very,\n\n502\n00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.230\nvery simply,\ndoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n503\n00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.580\nNow it's fitness for purpose.\n\n504\n00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.360\nDoes that service send and receive email?\n\n505\n00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.980\nYes it does, okay, and it had utility.\n\n506\n00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.950\nAnd you can have a web based email service\nthat will do exactly that for you.\n\n507\n00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.900\nIt will deliver that email,\nbut can I ask you,\n\n508\n00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:11.271\nin a business perspective then Ronnie,\nwould a web based email\n\n509\n00:30:11.271 --> 00:30:18.493\ndeliver you levels of security that you\nwould feel comfortable with, do you think?\n\n510\n00:30:18.493 --> 00:30:23.154\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily, especially if I'm\nactually using a public provider, and\n\n511\n00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:28.360\nnot my own as far as a portal that allows\nme access just inside of my own network.\n\n512\n00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n513\n00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:35.630\nSo what you're saying is then in effect,\nthat service provides utility,\n\n514\n00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:39.860\nwhich it does, but\nit doesn't provide warranty aspects.\n\n515\n00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:45.290\nAnd if we look at the warranty aspect,\nyou will see that those warranty aspects\n\n516\n00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:51.850\nare availability, capacity, security which\nis one that I mentioned, and continuity.\n\n517\n00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.460\nAnd so both utility and\nwarranty have to exist in order for\n\n518\n00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.058\nus to perceive value, okay?\n\n519\n00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.520\nSo let's go through those\nwarranty aspects, okay?\n\n520\n00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.130\nIs their service available enough?\n\n521\n00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:09.860\nWell, okay, an Internet based web mail\nservice might be available enough.\n\n522\n00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.600\nBut does it have enough capacity?\n\n523\n00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:18.300\nGuarantee when you try and send some files\nit'll tell you that they're too big.\n\n524\n00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.670\nDoes it have continuity?\n\n525\n00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:23.410\nWell it might do, but\nwe don't have any assurance of that.\n\n526\n00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:27.490\nAnd that's the key thing about\nwarranty is that we have assurance.\n\n527\n00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.340\nAnd we certainly don't have\nany assurance for security.\n\n528\n00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.430\nSo you see both utility and warranty\nneed to exist for us to perceive value.\n\n529\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.430\nIt's not just good enough for us to have\n\n530\n00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:43.615\na service that does what it says on the\ncan we got to be able to use it as well.\n\n531\n00:31:45.075 --> 00:31:46.435\nOn this next slide,\n\n532\n00:31:46.435 --> 00:31:51.095\nwhich is something that I'm going\nto use to wrap up this session.\n\n533\n00:31:51.095 --> 00:31:56.235\nIf you look the utility effect\nin that bottom left hand corner\n\n534\n00:31:56.235 --> 00:32:01.035\nis all about increasing\nthe probability and\n\n535\n00:32:01.035 --> 00:32:04.640\nmaintaining that probability\nof that service.\n\n536\n00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.680\nWorking, in other words not service\n\n537\n00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.560\nwill do what it says on the can\nwithout a shadow of a doubt.\n\n538\n00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:18.060\nBut the warranty effect has to\nactually decrease variances and\n\n539\n00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:24.030\navailability and incapacity and\nin continuity and in security.\n\n540\n00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:29.610\nBecause what we actually want to do is we\nwant to ensure that we have all of those,\n\n541\n00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:37.980\nso we want to decrease the uncertainty\nof providing those aspects.\n\n542\n00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.520\nAs we've said,\nwe have got to have those utility and\n\n543\n00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.519\nwarranty in order for\nanyone to perceive value.\n\n544\n00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:49.130\nSo for now we are going to wrap\nup this particular session,\n\n545\n00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:54.150\nwhich is part of our recap\nof our ITIL foundation.\n\n546\n00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:58.136\nAnd in our next session, we are going\nto look further into our assets and\n\n547\n00:32:58.136 --> 00:33:00.730\ninto resources and capabilities etc.\n\n548\n00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.570\nAnd we're also going to look into\nprocesses and we are going to look at\n\n549\n00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:11.780\nroles, and we're going to look at all\nof our responsibilities, etc., too.\n\n550\n00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\n\n551\n00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.000\nhelping us out with this\npart of the refresher.\n\n552\n00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.890\nThere's a lot more for us to cover but\nthat means we're gonna go ahead and\n\n553\n00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.670\nend this episode then.\n\n554\n00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.960\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n555\n00:33:25.960 -->

00:00:08.329\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:12.314\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:15.770\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.520\nYou're watching the ITIL foundation\nrefresher for your intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.760\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.121\nAnd we're taking a look at another\nfoundation refresher a part two,\n\n9\n00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:29.217\nto help us to round out\nthose skills that we need.\n\n10\n00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:34.611\nAnd here to help us of course is going\nto be our ITIL virtuoso, Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:36.004\nJo, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.674\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back Ronnie,\nhow are you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:38.674 --> 00:00:40.009\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.859\nTaking a look and\n\n15\n00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.872\nremembering all those different terms\nthat I've seen in the foundation, and\n\n16\n00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:49.160\nnow getting those things kind of brought\nback up is really starting to help.\n\n17\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.211\nSo what do we actually have left to do?\n\n18\n00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:52.470\nWhere are we gonna begin?\n\n19\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's, this foundation\nmaterial that we're recapping over this so\n\n20\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.170\nmuch information to absorb,\nso much information.\n\n21\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.088\nAnd trust me, you're not the only one,\nbecause we have delegates that leave\n\n22\n00:01:06.088 --> 00:01:11.083\nfoundation class, and the feedback that\nthey'll give you sometimes is it's\n\n23\n00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:14.580\nthat whoa, it's just so\nmuch information to absorb.\n\n24\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.600\nAnd it really is.\n\n25\n00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.252\nAnd the unfortunate thing is that we\nhave to get through the foundation.\n\n26\n00:01:20.252 --> 00:01:23.940\nYou have to understand all of the concepts\nin the foundation to be able to\n\n27\n00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.910\nthen dive deeper into the processes.\n\n28\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.640\nAnd until we can understand really what\na process is, or really what a functional\n\n29\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.060\narea is, and what a role should do,\nthen it's difficult to apply that concept.\n\n30\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.706\nAnd so\nwhat we're learning here is concepts, and\n\n31\n00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:41.855\nI will admit that there is a lot to learn.\n\n32\n00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:43.765\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right Joe so,\n\n33\n00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:47.865\njust take us a little bit through\nwhat we reviewed last time and then,\n\n34\n00:01:47.865 --> 00:01:50.563\nwhere we're going to\nbe heading from there.\n\n35\n00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:54.423\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in part one, we actually\nlooked at the concept of a service is.\n\n36\n00:01:54.423 --> 00:01:56.303\nAnd the concept of a service is,\n\n37\n00:01:56.303 --> 00:02:00.834\na service is a means of delivering value\nby facilitating the outcomes that our\n\n38\n00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:05.313\ncustomers want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific custom risks.\n\n39\n00:02:05.313 --> 00:02:10.805\nNow values perceived as I mentioned, we\nall have a different perception of value\n\n40\n00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:16.558\nand even in the business environment, our\nperception of value is still different.\n\n41\n00:02:16.558 --> 00:02:22.173\nNo matter how much we'd like to try in and\ndeliver a one size fits all approach\n\n42\n00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:28.595\nto our services to our business, we can't\ndo that because value is perceived.\n\n43\n00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:32.410\nSo we looked at that, and we looked\nat the fact that Service Management,\n\n44\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.890\nwhich ITIL is a framework, is a set of\nspecialized organizational capabilities.\n\n45\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.091\nFor delivering value to costumer\nin the form of goods or services.\n\n46\n00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:47.040\nNow I know I just rattled off two\ndescriptions, two definitions to you.\n\n47\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.007\nAnd now that's made me\nlook like a bit of a nerd.\n\n48\n00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:52.036\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm fully aware of that, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:56.398\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we also looked at the concept of\n\n50\n00:02:56.398 --> 00:03:01.130\nvalue, being broken down into utility and\nwarranty.\n\n51\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.285\nAnd the fact that it's not just about us\nbeing able to do what it says on the card.\n\n52\n00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.660\nAnd we've got to be able to send and\nreceive email, but\n\n53\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.460\nwe've got to do it in a way that we can\nassure our customers level of utility, and\n\n54\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.620\nwarranty, and availability, and capacity,\nand service continuity, and security.\n\n55\n00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.550\nSo we've gotta need both that utility and\n\n56\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.320\nwarranty too before us in order for\nthem to perceive value.\n\n57\n00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.300\nAnd so in this particular section,\n\n58\n00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.820\nwe're gonna start off just by going\nover what our service assets were.\n\n59\n00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.820\nI mentioned them very,\nvery briefly in the last section about\n\n60\n00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.390\ntangible in our intangible assets and\nhow we use those to deliver our services.\n\n61\n00:03:45.572 --> 00:03:48.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go ahead and begin then.\n\n62\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.440\nSo where are we picking up from there?\n\n63\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.422\n&gt;&gt; So as I said we begin\nwith our service assets.\n\n64\n00:03:54.422 --> 00:03:59.486\nAnd our assets are what we use\nwithin our organization to\n\n65\n00:03:59.486 --> 00:04:04.346\ndeliver value by way of goods or\nservices, as we say.\n\n66\n00:04:04.346 --> 00:04:05.810\nAnd an asset is described there.\n\n67\n00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.110\nYou've got some definitions there.\n\n68\n00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.418\nAn asset is described as a resource or\na capability.\n\n69\n00:04:10.418 --> 00:04:13.906\nAnd a resource is what we\nconsider to be a tangible asset,\n\n70\n00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:16.099\nsomething you that touch and feel.\n\n71\n00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.130\nSo chairs as mentioned there, money.\n\n72\n00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.640\nOur infrastructure itself\nthe software that we have,\n\n73\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.650\nthe actual data that we have,\nour hardware, these are tangible assets\n\n74\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.762\nyou'll notice that people' span\nboth capabilities and resources.\n\n75\n00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:36.010\nSo they're a tangible asset,\nsomething that you can touch and feel.\n\n76\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.666\nBut I gave you that warning in that first\nsection, don't you do that too much.\n\n77\n00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:44.775\n[LAUGH] And\nthen people are also intangible assets.\n\n78\n00:04:44.775 --> 00:04:48.611\nAnd you know what, under\nthe intangible assets are soft assets,\n\n79\n00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:51.450\nas they mention there, are capabilities.\n\n80\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.040\nWe've got things like, how we're managed.\n\n81\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.235\nWho manages us?\n\n82\n00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:58.900\nWe've got the organization itself,\nhow well organized we are.\n\n83\n00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.930\nIf there's complete chaos going on then\nwe're never gonna be able to deliver value\n\n84\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.261\nto our customers, are we?\n\n85\n00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:07.529\nOur processes is have to be efficient and\neffective.\n\n86\n00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:11.376\nAnd if our processes don't do what they're\nsupposed to do, and they're not efficient,\n\n87\n00:05:11.376 --> 00:05:12.670\nand they not effective.\n\n88\n00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.367\nThen you know what, they're not going\nto deliver value to our business to our\n\n89\n00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.401\nusers, and then our knowledge.\n\n90\n00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:23.745\nAnd underneath people,\nwe've got experience and skills, too.\n\n91\n00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:30.053\nAnd knowledge can be quantified,\nwe should document our knowledge.\n\n92\n00:05:30.053 --> 00:05:34.154\nAnd then it becomes information that\nwe can put in our knowledge management\n\n93\n00:05:34.154 --> 00:05:34.748\nsystems.\n\n94\n00:05:34.748 --> 00:05:38.897\nSo our knowledge though is also\nour experience and our skills, and\n\n95\n00:05:38.897 --> 00:05:41.055\nbelieve it or not, our attitude.\n\n96\n00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:46.107\nAnd our attitudes fall under\nthe soft assets, the capabilities.\n\n97\n00:05:46.107 --> 00:05:49.470\nThings have morale,\nI expect to see morale in there as well.\n\n98\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.920\nWhich is why as we've moved through\nthe service operation class,\n\n99\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.460\nyou'll see that we put a huge emphasis on\npeople and on morale and on attitudes.\n\n100\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.210\nAnd on understanding sort of\norganizational change management and\n\n101\n00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.630\nthe people aspect, because our people\nare what's going to enable us to deliver\n\n102\n00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.750\nvalue, but they're also what's going\nto hinder us from delivering value too.\n\n103\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.570\nLook at our soft skills and\n\n104\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.926\nlook at our capabilities there,\nand how well we're organized.\n\n105\n00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:24.227\nWell, that is, worst it might be you might\nconsider it to be driven by management,\n\n106\n00:06:24.227 --> 00:06:27.880\ncuz management set our\norganizational structures.\n\n107\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.166\nBut it's also driven by people, too,\n\n108\n00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:33.712\nas to how collaborative they\nare within that organization.\n\n109\n00:06:33.712 --> 00:06:38.240\nAnd think about our management\nI know I asked you.\n\n110\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.570\nI put you on the spot last time,\ndidn't I Ronnie?\n\n111\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.627\nAnd I said to you, do you get on\nwith your managers all the time?\n\n112\n00:06:43.627 --> 00:06:47.750\nAnd the simple fact of the matter is that\nthere are always going to be interpersonal\n\n113\n00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.418\nconflicts.\n\n114\n00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:51.552\nThere are always going to\nbe interpersonal issues.\n\n115\n00:06:51.552 --> 00:06:54.250\nAnd so we've got to accept that.\n\n116\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.900\nThat even if we've got good management,\n\n117\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.570\nthen there may be\ninterpersonal issues there.\n\n118\n00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.279\nAnd certainly I know that we've\nall worked in environments\n\n119\n00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:08.527\nwhere there may be a siloed\nmentality between teams.\n\n120\n00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:11.395\nAnd it doesn't matter how\ngood our processes are,\n\n121\n00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:14.062\nif our people do not have\nthe right attitude, or\n\n122\n00:07:14.062 --> 00:07:18.080\ndon't have the right experience to\nbe able to follow those processes.\n\n123\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.339\nAnd they're never gonna deliver value.\n\n124\n00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.843\nIt's really as simple as that.\n\n125\n00:07:21.843 --> 00:07:26.415\nSo people are very, very important\nto this, incredibly important.\n\n126\n00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:28.657\nSo I mentioned processes.\n\n127\n00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:31.015\nWell, let's take a look at a process.\n\n128\n00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:35.698\nI have mentioned in other sessions\nthat we look at in service operation,\n\n129\n00:07:35.698 --> 00:07:40.306\nthat a process is a set of structured\nactivities designed to accomplish\n\n130\n00:07:40.306 --> 00:07:42.630\na specific objective.\n\n131\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.940\nAnd it takes an input and\nturns it into an output, I think.\n\n132\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.272\nI remember I've said that and\nwe've had that discussion before, okay.\n\n133\n00:07:50.272 --> 00:07:54.913\nSo we are looking to deliver\nvalue to our organization by\n\n134\n00:07:54.913 --> 00:07:57.590\nfacilitating their outcomes.\n\n135\n00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.711\nWe can't achieve their outcomes for\nthem, but we can facilitate them.\n\n136\n00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:08.440\nSo we want to facilitate business\nprocesses which lead to business outcomes.\n\n137\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.920\nAnd we will use our processes in order\nto support the services that we deliver.\n\n138\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.620\nAnd exactly as it says on the next slide\nthere, supporting business processes.\n\n139\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.140\nSo we use our IT processes to\nsupport business processes.\n\n140\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.620\nNow, processes have four\ncharacteristics as written there.\n\n141\n00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.859\nA process has to be measurable.\n\n142\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.060\nI know that it's something\nthat I've mentioned before.\n\n143\n00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.520\nBut because I think so\nis not a good enough measurement, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.180\nWe have to have tangible\nmetrics to tell us\n\n145\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.390\nwhether the process is delivering value or\nnot.\n\n146\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.520\nWhether the process is effective and\nefficient.\n\n147\n00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.730\nA process has to deliver\na specific result.\n\n148\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.790\nWe have to know what\nthe process is delivering.\n\n149\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.099\nIt has to be defined.\n\n150\n00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.253\nAnd it has to deliver that\nresult to a customer.\n\n151\n00:08:59.253 --> 00:09:04.180\nNow, a customer was a stakeholder, I'd\nlike to use that word because sometimes,\n\n152\n00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.060\nit's another ways our customers that\nare raising particular processes,\n\n153\n00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.460\nsort of a triggering processes.\n\n154\n00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.690\nIf I think of incident management which is\nthe ability to restore service operation,\n\n155\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.640\nit's not always customers that\nraise incidents or users, but\n\n156\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.070\nit could be internal IT people as well.\n\n157\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.840\nSo I like to use the word\nstakeholder in there as well.\n\n158\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.580\nWe deliver the specific results\nto a customer or a stakeholder.\n\n159\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.040\nBut more importantly, at the bottom there,\nwe spawned into specific events.\n\n160\n00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.250\nAll processes have to start somewhere.\n\n161\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.580\nSomething's got to start them off, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.500\nSo we call that a trigger,\na trigger to a process.\n\n163\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.245\nNow, this next diagram that's coming up,\nwe're gonna spend a little bit of\n\n164\n00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:51.535\ntime on this because I\nabsolutely love this diagram.\n\n165\n00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:55.088\nI really, really do, and yet\neverybody tells me when they look at it,\n\n166\n00:09:55.088 --> 00:09:57.750\nthey say, my goodness Joe,\nthat looks so messy.\n\n167\n00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.990\nThen yet, it really,\nreally explains what a process is.\n\n168\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.350\nNow I've mentioned that\na process will start off with,\n\n169\n00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.912\nwell taking in input and\nturning it into a defined output.\n\n170\n00:10:09.912 --> 00:10:14.264\nOkay, so what we're going to do\nis we're going to start off with,\n\n171\n00:10:14.264 --> 00:10:19.732\nin the top right hand corner here, as you\ncan see my arrow, the process objective.\n\n172\n00:10:19.732 --> 00:10:24.390\nAnd I am going to use\nIncident Management as an example here.\n\n173\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.460\nAnd the objective of\nIncident Management is to restore\n\n174\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.660\nnormal service operation\nas quickly as possible.\n\n175\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.410\nSo that means then that the process output\nthen, what do you think that is Ronnie?\n\n176\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.650\nIf the objective is to restore\nnormal service operation,\n\n177\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.760\nwhat do you think the output\nto the process is?\n\n178\n00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.771\n&gt;&gt; Is that the process gets restored?\n\n179\n00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:47.858\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that the service gets restored.\n\n180\n00:10:47.858 --> 00:10:48.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the service gets restored.\n\n181\n00:10:48.525 --> 00:10:51.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the output is a fixed service,\nit's been repaired.\n\n182\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.248\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, sure.\n\n183\n00:10:53.248 --> 00:10:58.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if the output here, and\nprocess output is something fixed, and\n\n184\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.260\nwhat do you think the input is?\n\n185\n00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Something that is maybe not fixed.\n\n186\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.880\n&gt;&gt; Something broken?\n\n187\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.470\n&gt;&gt; Something broken.\n\n188\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.082\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n189\n00:11:05.082 --> 00:11:05.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.230\n&gt;&gt; So what we do then,\n\n191\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.790\nif you notice, okay, we've got the first\nthree steps of defining a process.\n\n192\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.519\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just worked out there and then.\n\n193\n00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:18.004\nSo we started off in this top right-hand\ncorner with our process objectives.\n\n194\n00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:22.960\nAnd then we looked at our process outputs,\nwhich was something broken, and\n\n195\n00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.410\nthe inputs, something fixed.\n\n196\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:30.140\nAnd here in this middle box, we've\ngot all of the actual process itself.\n\n197\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.240\nWe've got the activities,\nand the procedures, and\n\n198\n00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.240\nthe work instructions that will\nget us from broken to fixed.\n\n199\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.560\nYeah, it will get us from here to here,\nokay.\n\n200\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.770\nWe also have identified here\nwhat we call process roles.\n\n201\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.740\nThese are what roles and\n\n202\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.420\nwhat skills we need in order to\nget us from broken to fixed.\n\n203\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.700\nWe also have process metrics.\n\n204\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.870\nAnd that will tell us whether we\nare getting from broken to fixed.\n\n205\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:06.100\nNow, we'll have a policy and here in\nthis process control box at the top,\n\n206\n00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.460\nwe've got this policy that\ntells us what our ethics are,\n\n207\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.070\nwhat our way of working is and\nhow we're going to do it?\n\n208\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.440\nBecause I've just mentioned\nIncident Management, but\n\n209\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.400\ndon't forget we do this for\nevery single process.\n\n210\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.450\nAnd we have a defined process owner,\nsomebody who takes\n\n211\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.020\nownership of that process, and\nwho ensures that process is documented.\n\n212\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.650\nNow, I wanna bring you down to here\nwhere it says process improvements.\n\n213\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:37.778\nAnd notice that we have an arrow going\ndirectly from our outputs to feedback.\n\n214\n00:12:37.778 --> 00:12:40.141\nAnd that's what we call a feedback loop.\n\n215\n00:12:40.141 --> 00:12:46.030\nAnd our feedback then comes down and\ncomes into process improvements.\n\n216\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.150\nIn other words, so\nwhen we install a service,\n\n217\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.910\nwe're going to conduct a survey,\nhopefully,\n\n218\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.370\nwith our customers to see whether they\nhave actually had their service restored.\n\n219\n00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.550\nAnd we'll also conduct our lessons\nlearned, what worked well?\n\n220\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:06.010\nAnd we'll use that to improve\nour process in the future.\n\n221\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.870\nWe also conduct a lessons learned\nwith what didn't work so well too,\n\n222\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.420\nand we used that to improve\nagain in the future.\n\n223\n00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.400\nNow, let's bring you down to\nthis blue box at the boom here.\n\n224\n00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.800\nAnd you'll notice you see two familiar\nwords in here, the words resources and\n\n225\n00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.250\ncapabilities.\n\n226\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.230\nSo these are the people, and\nthe tools, and the experience, and\n\n227\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.860\nthe hardware, and the PCs,\netc, that they use in\n\n228\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.080\norder to get us from something\nbroken to something fixed.\n\n229\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:42.220\nNow, this one thing that I haven't\nmentioned, and that's this, the trigger.\n\n230\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.880\nAnd I said to you that, here we go,\nthere's my arrowhead [LAUGH].\n\n231\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.050\nI said to you that every\nprocess has to have a trigger,\n\n232\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.520\nsomething that starts it off.\n\n233\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.320\nIncident Management doesn't just happen,\nokay?\n\n234\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.350\nSo that trigger could be something\nlike an event that's occurred\n\n235\n00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.060\nthat's been notified to us\nthrough event management, and\n\n236\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.500\nthey've automatically raised a trigger, or\nautomatically raised an incident, sorry.\n\n237\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.840\nOr that trigger could be somebody calling\nthe service desk, or somebody picking up\n\n238\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.180\ntheir cell phone and logging a call via\nthe app to raise an incident, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.390\nThat's the trigger.\n\n240\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.866\nAnd all processes have to have a trigger,\n\n241\n00:14:19.866 --> 00:14:22.921\nalthough some of those\ntriggers can be automated.\n\n242\n00:14:22.921 --> 00:14:27.522\nOkay, so a function, or a functional\narea as we like to call it, well,\n\n243\n00:14:27.522 --> 00:14:30.076\nlet's go back to that previous slide.\n\n244\n00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:34.304\nOn that previous slide, we had this\nblue box, and that blue box represented\n\n245\n00:14:34.304 --> 00:14:38.620\nthe resources and the capabilities that\nwe needed to undertake the process.\n\n246\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.960\nWell, we have what we call teams\nof people, groups of people,\n\n247\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:50.750\nwe call them functions, and we use those\nfunctions to carry out those processes.\n\n248\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.920\nIn other words, that blue box represents\nthe role of our functional areas.\n\n249\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.570\nAnd we can structure our functions\ninto groups, and teams, and\n\n250\n00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.630\ndepartments, and divisions.\n\n251\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.880\nWe can do whatever we want in regards to\nthe structure of our IT organization.\n\n252\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.800\nRemember, we've got to deliver\nvalue to our organization, and so\n\n253\n00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.120\nit really is down to us how we structure\nourselves to deliver that value.\n\n254\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.260\nITO is not a prescription.\n\n255\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.800\nIt's not a one-size-fits-all pill that's\ngoing to resolve any issues that you might\n\n256\n00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.657\nhave within IT.\n\n257\n00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:28.908\nAnd it's certainly not gonna tell you\nhow you need to structure yourselves.\n\n258\n00:15:28.908 --> 00:15:32.830\nNow, as we move through the other\nservice operation modules,\n\n259\n00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.236\nyou'll see that there\nare various ways to structure.\n\n260\n00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:38.375\nAnd if we go into service strategy and\n\n261\n00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:41.136\nlook through the service\nstrategy lifecycle,\n\n262\n00:15:41.136 --> 00:15:45.774\nyou'll see that there is an evolution for\nthe structure of an IT organization.\n\n263\n00:15:45.774 --> 00:15:49.453\nAnd we certainly go into a lot\nmore depth of structures\n\n264\n00:15:49.453 --> 00:15:52.930\nin the service strategy lifecycle phase,\nokay?\n\n265\n00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:57.134\nSo a function then is a group of\npeople and the tools that they use,\n\n266\n00:15:57.134 --> 00:15:58.901\nthe skills that they have.\n\n267\n00:15:58.901 --> 00:16:05.061\nI like to refer to them more as\nfunctional areas Because as I said,\n\n268\n00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:10.446\nwe don't have a prescriptive\nanswer to your structure.\n\n269\n00:16:10.446 --> 00:16:14.810\nYour structure will be how you,\nwant your structure to look.\n\n270\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.130\nSo within every single process,\nand I already mentioned and\n\n271\n00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:24.250\nI'm gonna just jump back now to\nthis particular process model.\n\n272\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.118\nYou'll see that we have that\nred box at the top, and\n\n273\n00:16:27.118 --> 00:16:29.198\nthat red box is our process control.\n\n274\n00:16:29.198 --> 00:16:32.333\nAnd so with every single process we have,\n\n275\n00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:35.836\nin the top left hand corner,\na process owner.\n\n276\n00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:39.866\nNow if we were to use something\ncalled a racy matrix,\n\n277\n00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:45.210\nwhich we cover in great depths\nin service foundation itself.\n\n278\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.702\nWell, you'll see that we have\na role called accountability.\n\n279\n00:16:48.702 --> 00:16:53.750\nAnd accountability is where the bug\nstops if we wanna use that saying.\n\n280\n00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:59.250\nAccountable means somebody\nwho takes ownership of\n\n281\n00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:04.860\na particular process, and\nensures that it's performed according to,\n\n282\n00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.870\nnot just the documented process, but also\nany service level targets that may exist.\n\n283\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:14.940\nSo when you see the accountable,\nI want you to use the word, ensured,\n\n284\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.350\nas part of that sort of relationship\nthat goes on in your mind, okay?\n\n285\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.140\nSo accountable means ensured.\n\n286\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.800\nSo the process owner ensures that\nall of those bullet points happens.\n\n287\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.920\nHe takes accountability for ensuring\nthat all of those bullet points happen.\n\n288\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.780\nYou know what?\n\n289\n00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:39.500\nHe may delegate the responsibility\nto do that to the process manager.\n\n290\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.860\nBut the fact is that he\nensures that it happens.\n\n291\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.324\nHe doesn't necessarily have\nto do it all himself, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:47.324 --> 00:17:50.335\nNow, the process manager\nis accountable for, well,\n\n293\n00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:53.445\n[LAUGH] basically whatever\nthe process owner tells him.\n\n294\n00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:56.200\n[LAUGH] But no,\nthe process manager is accountable for\n\n295\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.960\nthe day-to-day operations of the process.\n\n296\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.010\nSo if you look at the bullet points here,\nhe's reviewing KPIs.\n\n297\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.474\nHe's making sure everybody's\ngot the right skills.\n\n298\n00:18:05.474 --> 00:18:07.250\nHe's going to monitor on performance.\n\n299\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:12.240\nHe's going to make sure we've got enough\npeople to be able to perform the process.\n\n300\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.430\nAnd he's also going to be providing\nfeedback to the process owner.\n\n301\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.467\nSo the process owner is a figure head,\nbut is also somebody who ensures that\n\n302\n00:18:23.467 --> 00:18:27.750\nwe've got the policies,\nthat we've got the right documentation.\n\n303\n00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:33.280\nHe takes accountability for publishing\nthe process, etc, and even improving it.\n\n304\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.070\nBut the process manager manages\nthe process on a day-to-day basis.\n\n305\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.026\nI want you to think about\nincident management again, and\n\n306\n00:18:41.026 --> 00:18:43.250\nI want you to think\nabout the service desk.\n\n307\n00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.640\nAnd what we may have,\n\n308\n00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.974\nespecially in a service desk where we have\nmultiple shifts, we will have a service\n\n309\n00:18:49.974 --> 00:18:55.190\ndesk manager who sits in an overall\naccountability for the service desk.\n\n310\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.350\nWe would consider them to be\nthe incident management process owner.\n\n311\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.790\nTakes ownership for\nthe entire service desk, and\n\n312\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.130\ntherefore for\nincident management period, okay?\n\n313\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.980\nAnd then we've got the process manager.\n\n314\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.140\nSo think of these as your shift leaders,\nokay?\n\n315\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.420\nYour team leaders.\n\n316\n00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.290\nThey're the people that manage the service\ndesk, and manage incident management on\n\n317\n00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:21.340\nthat middle level, on a day-to-day basis,\non a team-by-team basis.\n\n318\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.300\nAnd then we have what we call\nthe process practitioners.\n\n319\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.340\nAnd, for instance, in management,\nthat would be the service desk analyst.\n\n320\n00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.246\nAnd they are the people\nthat carry out one or\n\n321\n00:19:30.246 --> 00:19:35.260\nmore of those process activities,\nworking with other stakeholders.\n\n322\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.650\nStakeholders, remember from a previous\nsession, is any interested party.\n\n323\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.640\nSo a stakeholder can be a user,\na customer.\n\n324\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.050\nIt can be your colleague.\n\n325\n00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.430\nIt could be somebody in a second level or\nthird level support team,\n\n326\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.780\nsomebody that you escalate to.\n\n327\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.400\nOne thing that a process\npractitioner has to do though,\n\n328\n00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.080\na process practitioner has to ensure the\nprocess documentation is kept up to date.\n\n329\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:06.400\nI've mentioned, as we move into the actual\nprocesses within the service operation,\n\n330\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.158\nI've mentioned that in\nincident management,\n\n331\n00:20:09.158 --> 00:20:11.210\nall incidents have to be logged.\n\n332\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.899\nAnd, you know what?\n\n333\n00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:16.830\nThat is the responsibility of the process\npractitioner to ensure that all\n\n334\n00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.930\nincidents are logged.\n\n335\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.150\nAnd that's not just for\nincident management, by the way,\n\n336\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.110\nthat's for every single process, too.\n\n337\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.270\nThere has to be relevant documentation\nto ensure that the process is happening,\n\n338\n00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.820\notherwise, the process owner has\ngot absolutely nothing to go on.\n\n339\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.360\nAnd then we're back to that,\nwell, because I think so\n\n340\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.600\nmetric when somebody says, is the process\neffective or is it efficient?\n\n341\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.190\nAnd because I think so,\nit's just not good enough.\n\n342\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.580\nSo let's move on from processes then.\n\n343\n00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.880\nAnd then just to wrap this session up,\n\n344\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.380\nlet's take a look at\nthe services themselves.\n\n345\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:59.950\nEvery single service must\nhave a service owner.\n\n346\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.720\nThat is a service owner within IT,\n\n347\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.630\nthere is an important\ndifferentiation there, okay?\n\n348\n00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.160\nAnd that service owner takes\naccountability for the entire IT service.\n\n349\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:18.400\nAs we move through into service operation,\nand as we've looked previously at the life\n\n350\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:25.300\ncycle phases within IT, you'll see\nthat there were 20 odd processes.\n\n351\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.755\nWell, that service owner does not take\naccountability for all of those processes,\n\n352\n00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:33.400\nand that service owner takes\naccountability for the service.\n\n353\n00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.220\nAnd that diagram in the bottom\nright-hand corner there,\n\n354\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:42.420\nyou will see that each process\napplies to each service.\n\n355\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.696\nSo if we looked at Process 1 and we said\nthat, that was incident management, well,\n\n356\n00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:49.545\nincident management applies\nto every single service.\n\n357\n00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:52.526\nAnd problem management applies\nto every single service.\n\n358\n00:21:52.526 --> 00:21:57.055\nAnd request fulfillment applies\nto every single service, but\n\n359\n00:21:57.055 --> 00:22:00.483\nyou will notice that\neach service is separate.\n\n360\n00:22:00.483 --> 00:22:06.042\nAnd so each service or each silo as it\nis there will have a service owner,\n\n361\n00:22:06.042 --> 00:22:11.360\nand we use that with accountable again,\nand we use the word ensure.\n\n362\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.060\nThey ensure that value is delivered\nto the organization, okay?\n\n363\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:21.392\nSo they liaise with the process owners,\nbut they liaise with business relationship\n\n364\n00:22:21.392 --> 00:22:26.000\nmanagement as they will\nliaise with our organization.\n\n365\n00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.440\nAnd they will be present in\nour service review meetings,\n\n366\n00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.580\nwhich is where we review performance\nagainst those service level targets,\n\n367\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.370\nin service level management and\nwith our customer as well.\n\n368\n00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.170\nSo expect the service owner\nto be present for that.\n\n369\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.510\nUltimately, the service owner takes\naccountability for a service.\n\n370\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.361\nSo in this particular section here then,\nwell,\n\n371\n00:22:50.361 --> 00:22:55.321\nin the last two sections, we've done\na very, very brief overview of some\n\n372\n00:22:55.321 --> 00:23:00.139\nof the fundamentals that we learned\nwithin our ITIL foundation class.\n\n373\n00:23:00.139 --> 00:23:04.801\nNow, I do understand that there\nis a lot to learn there, so\n\n374\n00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:09.181\nplease feel free to browse\nfurther the ITIL foundation\n\n375\n00:23:09.181 --> 00:23:13.300\nmaterial that is available\nhere through ITProTV.\n\n376\n00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.290\nBut what I would ask you\nto do now is obviously\n\n377\n00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.750\nto move into your service\noperation material, and\n\n378\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.600\nto take a look at all of our\nother service operation modules.\n\n379\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.984\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well, thank you again\nfor helping us out, and reminding us of\n\n380\n00:23:27.984 --> 00:23:31.580\nthose foundational concepts that\nwe may be a little bit weak on.\n\n381\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.197\nBut now with this refresher,\n\n382\n00:23:33.197 --> 00:23:37.440\nit means that we're ready to head\non to our ITIL intermediate show.\n\n383\n00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520\nWell, great place for us to sign off then.\n\n384\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.480\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n385\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.680\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n386\n00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.223\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right now for\nyour ITIL intermediate introduction.\n\n387\n00:23:48.924 --> 00:23:54.318\n[MUSIC]\n\n388\n00:23:54.318 --> 00:23:57.854\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.197\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.197 --> 00:00:14.935\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:16.945\n&gt;&gt; I'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:19.389\nThis is actually a part two,\na continuation,\n\n7\n00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:22.279\nwhere we will look at service\nvalidation and testing.\n\n8\n00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.180\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.249\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.505\n&gt;&gt; I'm fine, thank you,\nCherokee, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:30.755\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\nI'm glad that you're back in studios.\n\n12\n00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:34.497\nDidn't leave us hanging here with a part\ntwo, because we really weren't finished\n\n13\n00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:37.128\ntalking about service validation and\ntesting, were we?\n\n14\n00:00:37.128 --> 00:00:41.257\n&gt;&gt; We weren't, but from now on really,\nwhat we're going to be looking at is very,\n\n15\n00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:42.750\nvery, subjective.\n\n16\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.290\nBecause service validation and\ntesting really is\n\n17\n00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.052\ncompletely dependent on what service it\nis that you are validating and testing.\n\n18\n00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:58.110\nAnd so, once we have a very,\nsort of, high level\n\n19\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.890\nrecommendation for a framework, there is\nno generic framework that we can give you.\n\n20\n00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.060\nLike with everything in ITIL,\nit’s not a one size fits all the approach.\n\n21\n00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.644\nIt can't be a one size fits all approach.\n\n22\n00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:10.980\nAnd so we're gonna say to you, well you\nneed to go away and do some testing.\n\n23\n00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.216\nAnd you need to plan for\n\n24\n00:01:12.216 --> 00:01:17.090\nyour testing, but this would come as\npart of your project management team for\n\n25\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.510\nyour large implementations because\nthey will plan for the testing.\n\n26\n00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.123\nI mean, let's take a look at\nthis first slide here and\n\n27\n00:01:24.123 --> 00:01:26.680\nyou see the process activities.\n\n28\n00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.955\nLook at this, plan and design the test,\nverify the test design,\n\n29\n00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:35.881\nprepare the test environment,\nperform the tests, whatever they may be.\n\n30\n00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:40.061\nAnd then evaluate what the result of\nthe tests were, and then clean up,\n\n31\n00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:43.220\nlet's clean up the test environment.\n\n32\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.410\nAnd then this gets fed in, the results\nget fed back in to change evaluation,\n\n33\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.370\nas you see.\n\n34\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.460\nSo, what we're saying is, well,\nwe're going to plan, and then we're gonna\n\n35\n00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.270\nverify, and then we're gonna prepare the\ntests and then we're gonna perform them.\n\n36\n00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.890\nAnd that's exactly what we're going to do.\n\n37\n00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.840\nAnd we can't really\nexpand too much more on\n\n38\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.580\nthese particular activities purely because\nthey're going to be incredibly subjective\n\n39\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.650\nto whatever it is that\nyou are actually testing.\n\n40\n00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.420\nSo let's take a look at what\nstarts off validation and\n\n41\n00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.060\ntesting, well, an RFC,\na request for change.\n\n42\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.950\nWhich is the request for\na new service, and of course,\n\n43\n00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.760\nthat's come through service design.\n\n44\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.160\nSo this is going to be a project\nplan that's going to come to us.\n\n45\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.840\nThat's going to require us to\nperform validation and testing.\n\n46\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.110\nAnd of course,\nthat project plan is Included in what we\n\n47\n00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.160\ncalled the service design package.\n\n48\n00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.250\nNow, if you want to see more\nabout the service design package,\n\n49\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.390\nthen please take a look at\nour service design show.\n\n50\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.150\nAnd there's an episode in there\nwhere we will take a look\n\n51\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.610\nat the contents of\nthe service design package.\n\n52\n00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.520\nAnd if we look in the design\ncoordination process,\n\n53\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.719\nthen you'll find that a lot more\nabout that service design package.\n\n54\n00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.800\nBut it includes things like\nthe service charter and\n\n55\n00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.810\nalso the service level agreements.\n\n56\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.860\nSo at least the SLRs, the draft service\nlevel agreements, and release and\n\n57\n00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.980\ndeployment plans.\n\n58\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.030\nWell, release and deployment plans, I'm\nhoping, would contain some form of testing\n\n59\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.250\nguidance as well,\nincluding test conditions too.\n\n60\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.230\nSo, what comes out of testing?\n\n61\n00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.190\nWell, the results of testing,\n\n62\n00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.310\nthat's what comes out of\nservice validation and testing.\n\n63\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.330\nAnd it's delivered to change evaluation,\nso that they may evaluate that change.\n\n64\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.930\nAnd evaluate whether the change will\ndeliver what it's supposed to deliver.\n\n65\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.166\nAnd have the tests proved that it's going\nto actually facilitate those outcomes,\n\n66\n00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:47.271\nwhich is what we want to achieve.\n\n67\n00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:49.440\nSo, what else comes out of there?\n\n68\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.705\nWell, updated information for, it mentions\nour service knowledge management system,\n\n69\n00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:57.755\nbut I wanna think about\nconfiguration management system too.\n\n70\n00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:01.345\nBecause don't forget, our configuration\nmanagement system contains that accurate\n\n71\n00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:06.715\nand reliable information about all of\nour components of our services and\n\n72\n00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:09.490\nthose configuration items.\n\n73\n00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.756\nAnd so, updates and potential updates to\nbe for deployment to our configuration\n\n74\n00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:19.720\nmanagement system, that comes out of\nservice validation and testing too.\n\n75\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.862\nNow, it mentions improvement ideas for\nCSI.\n\n76\n00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:27.928\nWell, as I already referred to in\na previous episode, as we're going through\n\n77\n00:04:27.928 --> 00:04:33.070\nconducting every single test, not only\nare we getting the results of the test,\n\n78\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.755\nbut we're also working out\nwhat test mechanisms work and\n\n79\n00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:40.765\nwhat test mechanisms didn't work quite so\nwell for us.\n\n80\n00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:44.705\nSo, they are improvement initiatives for\nCSI.\n\n81\n00:04:44.705 --> 00:04:50.735\nSo, that next time we perform testing,\nwell, we've got a streamlined way to test.\n\n82\n00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:53.815\nWe know what works and we know what\ndoesn't work in our environment.\n\n83\n00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:59.205\nAnother output is\nthird-party relationships.\n\n84\n00:04:59.205 --> 00:05:01.275\nThat's what's mentioned in there.\n\n85\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.570\nI'd like to think that we can perform\ntesting hand in hand with our supplies.\n\n86\n00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.136\nQuite often, when we had a third-party\nsupplier that's brought a piece of\n\n87\n00:05:14.136 --> 00:05:16.989\nsoftware for us,\nwhether it's off the shelf or\n\n88\n00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:22.213\nwhether it's something that they developed\nin bespoke or tailor made fashion for us.\n\n89\n00:05:22.213 --> 00:05:26.023\nWell, I'd like to think that we had a very\ngood working relationship with that\n\n90\n00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:27.430\nsupplier.\n\n91\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.150\nBut I also have to add a caveat into that,\nin that, a supplier, no matter who\n\n92\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.190\nthey are, are only ever going to\ngive you their best testing results.\n\n93\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.650\nAnd even if you were to ask them for\n\n94\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.350\nthe worst case scenario, they'll still\ngive you the best worst case scenario.\n\n95\n00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.510\nSo we have to be very,\nvery careful with that.\n\n96\n00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.780\nNow, I'm not saying that you should take\nthat with a pinch of salt or anything, but\n\n97\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.040\nwhat I am saying is be very,\nvery objective about the way that\n\n98\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.375\nyou view information that\ncomes from third-parties.\n\n99\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.580\nUnless it's information that you have gone\nat internally within the organization\n\n100\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.490\nthen obviously that's going to\nbe subjective information, and\n\n101\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.030\ntherefore, you have to\nbe objective about that.\n\n102\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.260\nSo, what does service design give us?\n\n103\n00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.740\nWell, service design, well,\nthat's going to give us testing\n\n104\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.450\ncriteria because I expect that to\nbe in the service design package.\n\n105\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.900\nAnd what we feed back to service\ndesign are improvement initiatives for\n\n106\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.700\ntesting criteria.\n\n107\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.728\nSo, this is what we tested last time,\nand this is what worked really well.\n\n108\n00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:37.630\nAnd so therefore,\nthis is what we should test in the future.\n\n109\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.330\nAnd this is where we missed,\nthis is what we didn't test and\n\n110\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.660\nwhat we should have tested.\n\n111\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.020\nBecause we had an incident\nafter we deployed this service\n\n112\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.670\nbecause we didn't test that particular\nfunctionality or that particular module.\n\n113\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.725\nAnd again, CSI is gonna have\nsome involvement in that.\n\n114\n00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:56.680\nNow, into other life cycle phases,\n\n115\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.490\nI've gotta put something in here,\nin operation, that's not mentioned.\n\n116\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.800\nAnd that is the simple fact that\nif you get your testing wrong,\n\n117\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.310\nyou're gonna get an incident when\nit goes to service operation.\n\n118\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.690\nWhen you deploy, if you don't test it\ncorrectly there's going to be a failure.\n\n119\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.220\nWe can't ignore that, so it’s our\nresponsibility to get testing right.\n\n120\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.610\nAnd an output to service operation\ncould be a failure if we get it wrong.\n\n121\n00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.663\nAnd then service strategy, well,\n\n122\n00:07:26.663 --> 00:07:29.520\nservice strategy tells us how\nmuch money we've got to spend.\n\n123\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.798\nAnd sometimes, I have seen\ntesting that has been reduced or\n\n124\n00:07:34.798 --> 00:07:41.530\nthat has been, how should we say,\ncut short because of lack of money.\n\n125\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.475\nWhere organizations have said, we don't\nhave the money to test any further, so\n\n126\n00:07:46.475 --> 00:07:48.500\nwe're just going to release it as it is.\n\n127\n00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.144\nI can't tell you whether that's right or\nwrong, because, like I've said before,\n\n128\n00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:57.474\nITIL doesn't have the magic solution for\nabsolutely everything.\n\n129\n00:07:57.474 --> 00:08:01.739\nWe can tell you what best practice is, and\nof course, best practice is to fully test.\n\n130\n00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:04.970\nBut then Obviously you\nknow your environment and\n\n131\n00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.526\nmuch better than I could\never know your environment.\n\n132\n00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:14.660\nSo you make those decisions whether\nyou want to test up to a point or not.\n\n133\n00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.555\nThat's completely up to you, obviously.\n\n134\n00:08:17.555 --> 00:08:22.845\nAnd what I will say though is that\nthere is an element of risk management\n\n135\n00:08:22.845 --> 00:08:28.061\ninvolved in this, in that if you\ndecide not to test, there is a risk.\n\n136\n00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:31.233\nAnd maybe you feel that,\nthat decision's been taken away from you,\n\n137\n00:08:31.233 --> 00:08:33.376\nbecause of say,\nlack of funding, et cetera.\n\n138\n00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:36.262\nBut the simple fact is that\nif you decide not to test,\n\n139\n00:08:36.262 --> 00:08:38.170\nyou make the decision not to test.\n\n140\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.848\nAnd if you do, there is a risk.\n\n141\n00:08:39.848 --> 00:08:44.534\nNow with any risk management technique,\nit doesn't matter which one you're using,\n\n142\n00:08:44.534 --> 00:08:47.760\nyou will evaluate whether that\nrisk is worth taking or not.\n\n143\n00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.321\nAnd if that risk is worth taking,\nthen maybe you stop testing.\n\n144\n00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:56.455\nIf the risk is not worth taking, then\nmaybe you carry on with the testing and\n\n145\n00:08:56.455 --> 00:08:59.265\ntry and save some money somewhere else.\n\n146\n00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:03.801\n&gt;&gt; Jo, you bring up a really good point\nbecause, I mean, in a perfect world,\n\n147\n00:09:03.801 --> 00:09:06.473\nwe would want to follow\nthese rules to the T.\n\n148\n00:09:06.473 --> 00:09:08.875\nBut sometimes when it comes down to it,\nlike you said,\n\n149\n00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:11.030\nsometimes that decision\nis taken away from you.\n\n150\n00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.778\nIf it comes down to the application\nthat you've been developing for\n\n151\n00:09:14.778 --> 00:09:18.722\nthe past six months and your direct\ncompetitor has caught wind of it, or\n\n152\n00:09:18.722 --> 00:09:21.748\nthey're about to release\na very similar version, and\n\n153\n00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:25.232\nit really comes down to which\ncompany's gonna make it or fail,\n\n154\n00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:28.359\nthen that's where these\ndecisions can come into play.\n\n155\n00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:33.757\nBut perfect world or best case scenario\nis to follow the guidelines, of course.\n\n156\n00:09:33.757 --> 00:09:36.530\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe see this every day in our real life.\n\n157\n00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.851\nAnd I'd just mentioned money and,\nbut timing is another issue.\n\n158\n00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:45.091\nAnd timing is something that\nwill force reduced testing and\n\n159\n00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:47.479\nreduced stringency of testing.\n\n160\n00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:48.720\nBut we see this every day.\n\n161\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.990\nLet's take a look at our cell phones,\nfor instance.\n\n162\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.733\nWe've all got a cell phone.\n\n163\n00:09:52.733 --> 00:09:57.091\nAnd we know for a fact that there are cell\nphones that are released or maybe\n\n164\n00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:02.640\noperating systems of cell phones that are\nreleased right at the very last minute.\n\n165\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.604\nAnd you really, really think to\nyourself that this particular model or\n\n166\n00:10:06.604 --> 00:10:11.163\nthis particular operating system would\nhave benefited from maybe another week in\n\n167\n00:10:11.163 --> 00:10:12.038\ndevelopment.\n\n168\n00:10:12.038 --> 00:10:16.024\nBut because a particular provider\nneeded to get to market first,\n\n169\n00:10:16.024 --> 00:10:18.090\nthey released early.\n\n170\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.342\nAnd we see this all the time.\n\n171\n00:10:20.342 --> 00:10:21.980\nBut again it's about risk management.\n\n172\n00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.902\nAnd there has to be an element of risk\nmanagement that evaluates whether it's\n\n173\n00:10:26.902 --> 00:10:30.130\nworth releasing at that point in time or\nnot.\n\n174\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:36.030\nAnd sometimes organizations will\ndetermine that it's better for\n\n175\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.880\nthem to release early with\npotential errors than it\n\n176\n00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.000\nis to release later than the competition\nbut at least have it error free,\n\n177\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.570\nbecause you don't know what\nthe competition is going to be like.\n\n178\n00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:56.160\nSo what does then our service validation\nand testing process have to achieve?\n\n179\n00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:03.450\nWell, we've gotta be able to measure a\nservice's ability to perform as expected.\n\n180\n00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:11.499\nAnd if we can't measure that, then even\nthough we can test absolutely everything,\n\n181\n00:11:11.499 --> 00:11:16.327\nif we can't measure whether it works or\nnot, then we have no\n\n182\n00:11:16.327 --> 00:11:22.337\ndemonstration as to whether a service\nis going to perform when required.\n\n183\n00:11:22.337 --> 00:11:25.444\nSo in terms of critical success factors,\n\n184\n00:11:25.444 --> 00:11:31.136\nwe've got to ensure that we take into\nperspective all of our stakeholders.\n\n185\n00:11:31.136 --> 00:11:34.695\nThat we take into account\neverything that they want to see.\n\n186\n00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:39.015\nRemember the discussion that we had\nat the beginning of our last episode,\n\n187\n00:11:39.015 --> 00:11:42.788\nwhere we looked at the difference\nbetween a customer and a user.\n\n188\n00:11:42.788 --> 00:11:46.280\nThey have two very,\nvery completely different perspectives.\n\n189\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.198\nBut then another stakeholder,\nor our support team and\n\n190\n00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:53.090\nour service desk,\nthey have a different perspective too.\n\n191\n00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.890\nSo we have to ensure that we take into\nconsideration all of their perspectives.\n\n192\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:03.160\nAnd in terms of KPIs, look at the KPIs\nthat we have listed with that CSF.\n\n193\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.540\nSo increasing in services where we\nunderstand all roles and responsibilities.\n\n194\n00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.490\nWhere roles are documented and\n\n195\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.909\nwhere customers, stakeholders,\nusers, support people are happy.\n\n196\n00:12:16.955 --> 00:12:23.284\nEncouraging a risk management culture,\nthat's an interesting CSF even.\n\n197\n00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.240\n[LAUGH] Isn't it?\n\n198\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.020\nI mean, encouraging risk management?\n\n199\n00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.028\nRisk management, by the way,\ndoesn't mean that we take risks.\n\n200\n00:12:32.028 --> 00:12:34.840\nIt means that we manage risks.\n\n201\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.320\nIt means that we evaluate risks and\nwe make a decision.\n\n202\n00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.449\nIt's completely different\nfrom taking risks.\n\n203\n00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:44.370\n&gt;&gt; And here I thought I was\njust living on the edge, Jo.\n\n204\n00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.976\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no,\n\n205\n00:12:45.976 --> 00:12:49.270\nyou've evaluated your risks and then\nyou've decided what you're going to do.\n\n206\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.773\nThis is not about living on the edge.\n\n207\n00:12:50.773 --> 00:12:52.336\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n208\n00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:56.367\nlook at the KPIs as far as\nrisk management is concerned.\n\n209\n00:12:56.367 --> 00:13:00.708\nWe want people that feel\nable to identify risks.\n\n210\n00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:03.630\nAnd we want to be able\nto document those risks.\n\n211\n00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.521\nAnd we actually wanna see more\nrisks in the risk register.\n\n212\n00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:11.297\nThat's a bit of frightening, all three\nof those are actually quite frightening\n\n213\n00:13:11.297 --> 00:13:15.058\nKPIs because a lot of people feel\ntoo scared to identify risks.\n\n214\n00:13:15.058 --> 00:13:18.860\nThey don't wanna be the one that sort\nof raises their hand tentatively and\n\n215\n00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.330\nsays, I see a potential problem here.\n\n216\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.670\nAnd a lot of times, depending on\nthe culture of the organization,\n\n217\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.399\nthat has a huge part to do with this,\nthat culture could actually prevent\n\n218\n00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:37.232\npeople from raising their hands and\nsaying, I foresee a potential risk.\n\n219\n00:13:37.232 --> 00:13:38.353\nAnd you know what?\n\n220\n00:13:38.353 --> 00:13:43.236\nThat last KPI where I say that we probably\nneed to increase the number of risks\n\n221\n00:13:43.236 --> 00:13:45.110\non the risk register.\n\n222\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.869\nAgain another scary KPI.\n\n223\n00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:50.564\nBecause most people will look at that and\nsay, no,\n\n224\n00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:53.140\nwe wanna have a reduction\nin the number of risks.\n\n225\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.381\nBut we don't.\n\n226\n00:13:54.381 --> 00:13:58.500\nCuz if I don't see any risks on the risk\nregister, I will turn around and\n\n227\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.553\ntell you very, very simply that you\nsimply haven't identified any or\n\n228\n00:14:02.553 --> 00:14:05.750\nthat you're trying to\navoid identifying risks.\n\n229\n00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.111\nAnd that's definitely\nwhat we don't want to do.\n\n230\n00:14:10.111 --> 00:14:11.868\nSo what about all the CSS that we've got?\n\n231\n00:14:11.868 --> 00:14:15.860\nReusable test models,\nabsolutely fantastic.\n\n232\n00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.540\nWe definitely need to be testing\nin a consistent way, but\n\n233\n00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.280\nwe do that in the understanding that\nall of our services are different.\n\n234\n00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.660\nSo we have test models.\n\n235\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.780\nBut that doesn't mean that we\nsee everything exactly the same,\n\n236\n00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.910\nit just means that we have\na standard approach to testing.\n\n237\n00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.924\nGo back to part one of service\nvalidation and testing,\n\n238\n00:14:37.924 --> 00:14:43.156\nwhere we actually looked at planning\nour tests and having test scripts.\n\n239\n00:14:43.156 --> 00:14:45.449\nThese are part of our\nreusable test models.\n\n240\n00:14:45.449 --> 00:14:48.575\nAnd these should be stored in a database.\n\n241\n00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:52.560\nThese should be stored within our\nknowledge management repository,\n\n242\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.010\nmost definitely.\n\n243\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.418\nSo I wanna see an increase in the number\nof times that tests have been reused.\n\n244\n00:14:58.418 --> 00:15:02.670\nAnd what about that balance between\ncosting of testing and effectiveness?\n\n245\n00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.948\nWell, we just talked about earlier on,\n\n246\n00:15:04.948 --> 00:15:09.236\nabout quite often we'll get some form\nof directive that says, that's it,\n\n247\n00:15:09.236 --> 00:15:14.300\nI don't wanna do any more testing, because\nwe've spent enough money in testing.\n\n248\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.571\nOr even to the point where we want\nto release early because we've got\n\n249\n00:15:19.571 --> 00:15:24.668\ntime constraints on us dictated\nby our competitors, et cetera.\n\n250\n00:15:24.668 --> 00:15:27.515\nWe acknowledge that this\nsort of thing happens.\n\n251\n00:15:27.515 --> 00:15:31.648\nBut we want to try and\nensure that if we are as efficient and\n\n252\n00:15:31.648 --> 00:15:36.042\nas effective as we possibly can\nbe within our environment and\n\n253\n00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:41.385\nwithin our testing processes,\nthen actually we never get to that point,\n\n254\n00:15:41.385 --> 00:15:45.121\nbecause we're as efficient\nas we possibly can be.\n\n255\n00:15:45.121 --> 00:15:49.507\nSo take a look at those KPI's there,\nincluding reduced cost in fixing errors,\n\n256\n00:15:49.507 --> 00:15:53.369\nbecause we're detecting them earlier and\nreduced business impact,\n\n257\n00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:56.062\nbecause we're not actually\ndelaying testing.\n\n258\n00:15:56.062 --> 00:15:57.238\nWe're getting on with testing.\n\n259\n00:15:57.238 --> 00:16:00.908\nAgain, think about efficiency.\n\n260\n00:16:00.908 --> 00:16:05.295\nAnd understanding risks, you know that CSF\ngoes back to that previous CSF where I\n\n261\n00:16:05.295 --> 00:16:07.180\ntalked about identifying risks.\n\n262\n00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.490\nI want everyone to ensure that they\nfeel confident in identifying risk and\n\n263\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.050\nthat they don't feel any pressure\nto not identify or to hide risks.\n\n264\n00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.740\nUltimately, what we have got to overcome\n\n265\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.910\nin order to be able to be effective\nin Service Validation and Testing,\n\n266\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.580\nas we have got to overcome our\nchallenges that we have listed here.\n\n267\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.750\nIn another words, we have got\nto have a test environment, and\n\n268\n00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.840\nwe've got to have people\nwith the right skills.\n\n269\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.330\nAnd look at that next one there.\n\n270\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.240\nYou know, Cherokee, that's exactly\nwhat you mentioned about time scales,\n\n271\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.070\nbeing tightened because we want to\nget out to market very quickly.\n\n272\n00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:56.700\nIf we don't set clear expectations for\ntesting, this is when we run\n\n273\n00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.070\ninto those types of challenges to do with\ntime scales and to do with budget as well.\n\n274\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.620\nBecause if we don't tell everybody\nexactly what's expected within\n\n275\n00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.610\nthe testing environment and\nwithin the testing of any service,\n\n276\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.660\npeople will assume that you can just\ntest just like that, really quickly.\n\n277\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.560\nWell, if only that were the case.\n\n278\n00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.270\nWe're talking about large\nscale implementation here, so\n\n279\n00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:24.820\ntherefore testing is not gonna be\nsomething that you can do overnight.\n\n280\n00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.970\nLook at that risk there about the lack\nof appreciation that risk comes from\n\n281\n00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.506\npoorly targeted testing.\n\n282\n00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:35.870\nWe've got to plan our testing and\nit's gonna be comprehensive as well.\n\n283\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.840\nWe have to ensure that we\ntest absolutely everything.\n\n284\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.700\nSo who do we have in terms of roles and\n\n285\n00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.830\nresponsibilities then within\nservice validation and testing?\n\n286\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.140\nWell, think back to ITL foundation,\n\n287\n00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:55.060\nrecap on our roles and responsibilities\nand we have a process owner.\n\n288\n00:17:55.060 --> 00:18:00.070\nProcess owner who is accountable for\nan overall testing strategy.\n\n289\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:06.330\nAnd then we'll have a Service and\nValidation Testing Process Manager\n\n290\n00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.560\nreports to the Service Transition Manager.\n\n291\n00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.150\nInterestingly enough,\n\n292\n00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.340\nwhat it does say there is that those\ntwo roles should not be combined.\n\n293\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.770\nSo testing is not combined with\nrelease and deployment management.\n\n294\n00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.720\nWhy do you think we shouldn't\ncombine testing with release and\n\n295\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.790\ndeployment management?\n\n296\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.640\n&gt;&gt; Well, this kind of goes to the whole\nconcept of I really want my network\n\n297\n00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.960\nengineers performing my penetration tests\nbecause there may be some underlying bias.\n\n298\n00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.500\nAnd you're really only getting\nthat initial perspective\n\n299\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.780\nthat an application or software or\ndesign was created with.\n\n300\n00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.920\nSo you're not getting an additional\nperspective, or a different\n\n301\n00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.580\nset of eyes because they might not see\nthe issues that someone else could see, or\n\n302\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.800\nthey might not be hiding\nthe fact that hey,\n\n303\n00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.475\nI'm perfect, there could be\nnothing wrong with the system.\n\n304\n00:18:59.475 --> 00:19:02.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's exactly it.\n\n305\n00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.450\nI'm so glad you mentioned that.\n\n306\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.338\nI don't know about whether they wander\naround saying hey look, I'm perfect.\n\n307\n00:19:07.338 --> 00:19:11.514\nAlthough mind you,\nI met some network engineers.\n\n308\n00:19:11.514 --> 00:19:16.270\n[LAUGH] But what I am saying is that\nthere's a conflict of interest there.\n\n309\n00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.900\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n310\n00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.850\n&gt;&gt; Testing, we want to test it and\nwe want to break it.\n\n311\n00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.326\nThat's what to do in testing.\n\n312\n00:19:22.326 --> 00:19:24.290\nBut we're listening to\ndeployment management.\n\n313\n00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.290\nWe've got perhaps our developers\nmaybe performing release and\n\n314\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.430\ndeployment management.\n\n315\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.630\nBut irrespective of whether\nit's our developers or\n\n316\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.920\nwhether we've got a separate team, the\nsimple fact is that they have a deadline.\n\n317\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.380\nAnd it could be our project\nmanagement team that are performing\n\n318\n00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.180\nthe release the deployment.\n\n319\n00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.230\nThey've got a deadline.\n\n320\n00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.476\nThey have got a date that\nthey want to meet and\n\n321\n00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.363\nthey have got to get the service out.\n\n322\n00:19:46.363 --> 00:19:49.080\nAnd the problem is that\nthe testing manager,\n\n323\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.950\nthe people doing the testing on\nthat team are trying to break it.\n\n324\n00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.930\nWell, of course, our release guys will\nsay no, no there's nothing wrong there,\n\n325\n00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.410\nI just want to get it out.\n\n326\n00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.060\nAnd the testing guys are saying\nhang on a minute, hang on, hang on,\n\n327\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.410\nI haven't tested this.\n\n328\n00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.855\nI want to get this tested cuz I swear I\nsaw an error in the script somewhere.\n\n329\n00:20:08.855 --> 00:20:11.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, you've got two conflicting\n\n330\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:17.106\nobjectives, which is why we say that\nthose two roles shouldn't be combined.\n\n331\n00:20:17.106 --> 00:20:20.623\nCuz the service validation and\ntesting manager, well,\n\n332\n00:20:20.623 --> 00:20:23.040\nthey need to perform all of the tests and\n\n333\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.530\nthey need to be satisfied that everything\nhas been tested before release.\n\n334\n00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.393\nOr as the release and deployment manager,\n\n335\n00:20:30.393 --> 00:20:33.149\nwell, their objective is to get\nit out as quickly as possible.\n\n336\n00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:36.430\nNow you'd like to think that there was\nsome sort of synergy between the two.\n\n337\n00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.190\nAnd I am sure most organizations\nwe can be growing up about it and\n\n338\n00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.499\nwe can be adult about this and\nwe working together as a team.\n\n339\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.879\nBut nevertheless, we want to keep\nthe two activities separate.\n\n340\n00:20:48.879 --> 00:20:52.800\nAnd I'm not saying that people\ndon't work together as a team, but\n\n341\n00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.794\nbecause that conflict of interest and\nthe conflict of objectives,\n\n342\n00:20:56.794 --> 00:21:00.660\nit doesn't make sense to give those\ntwo roles to the same person.\n\n343\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.080\nAnd then, we've got people that\nactually perform the testing.\n\n344\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.770\nAnd we call these our practitioners,\n\n345\n00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:11.760\nbecause as we go back to our foundation\nmaterial, our process practitioners\n\n346\n00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.280\nare the people that actually perform\nindividual activities with the processors.\n\n347\n00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.260\nSo look at what they're doing,\nthey're conducting the tests,\n\n348\n00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.210\nthey're recording the findings\nof their testing as well.\n\n349\n00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.040\nAnd they're the people that\nare contributing towards the evaluation\n\n350\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.960\nreports and the testing reports too\nto go back to change evaluation.\n\n351\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.070\nSo I'd expect these people to\nbe technical people as well.\n\n352\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.540\nSo that's pretty much it.\n\n353\n00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.134\nThat kinda wraps it up for\nservice validation and testing.\n\n354\n00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:44.040\nNow, you do have exercises.\n\n355\n00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.440\nAnd I know that I didn't highlight any\nexercises at the end of our last episode,\n\n356\n00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.750\nbut in our last episode I asked you\nto look at our service v model.\n\n357\n00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.310\nWell now,\nin your downloadable material, you will\n\n358\n00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.961\n&gt;&gt; You have 20 jumping jacks, 15 push ups.\n\n359\n00:21:56.961 --> 00:22:00.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right [LAUGH] yeah,\nthose sorts of exercise.\n\n360\n00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.545\n&gt;&gt; Jo's like, Cherokee just hold on.\n\n361\n00:22:02.545 --> 00:22:04.467\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n362\n00:22:04.467 --> 00:22:09.340\nI'm not too sure what it is today\nI can't help her, I'm sorry.\n\n363\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.230\nBut you do have some exercises to do,\nokay?\n\n364\n00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.622\nIf you wanna do jumping jacks,\n\n365\n00:22:13.622 --> 00:22:17.270\nwhile you're performing the exercises\nthen go knock yourself out, all right?\n\n366\n00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.515\nDon't let me stop you.\n\n367\n00:22:18.515 --> 00:22:22.610\n[LAUGH] Please, please,\nplease go ahead and\n\n368\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:27.570\nlook at the activities that you've been\ngiven in your downloadable material.\n\n369\n00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:32.785\nAnd as always, I would like you to know\nthat we're available on our forum.\n\n370\n00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:34.428\nIf you do have any queries and\n\n371\n00:22:34.428 --> 00:22:38.059\nif you do have any questions at\nall about service validation and\n\n372\n00:22:38.059 --> 00:22:42.890\ntesting, then please feel free to ask,\nand we'll be happy out where we can.\n\n373\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, thanks Jo, and\nthank you guys for joining us today.\n\n374\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.940\nBut we are out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n375\n00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.550\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n376\n00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.480\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n377\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.330\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n378\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.689\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n379\n00:22:55.689 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.532\nWelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:06.357\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:08.266\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.946\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:14.235\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nITIL Intermediate series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:16.255\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:19.275\nIn this episode we'll be taking\na look at Knowledge Management.\n\n8\n00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:22.485\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:23.617\nHow's it going, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:23.617 --> 00:00:24.642\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm fine, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:26.683\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I know I realized, I was like,\n\n12\n00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:27.492\nI did it again.\n\n13\n00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:29.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey lady, how's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:30.447\n&gt;&gt; That's better.\n\n15\n00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:31.107\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n16\n00:00:31.107 --> 00:00:32.902\nI can cope with that one, thank you.\n\n17\n00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:35.247\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, the name of this topic here,\n\n18\n00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:38.977\nwith the Knowledge Management,\nit almost sounds like philosophical, Jo.\n\n19\n00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:42.419\nHow are we gonna be tackling\nsomething this grandiose?\n\n20\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.240\n&gt;&gt; Well, Knowledge Management is all\nabout learning by experiences as you have\n\n21\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.065\nquite eloquently demonstrated, see.\n\n22\n00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:53.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Knowledge Management is actually really\n\n23\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.980\nabout ensuring that we have got the right\ninformation available at the right time to\n\n24\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.240\nmake an informed decision.\n\n25\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.065\nThat's what Knowledge Management is about.\n\n26\n00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:05.259\nAnd so it's not actually grandiose.\n\n27\n00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.420\n[LAUGH] It's not scary-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.790\n&gt;&gt; Either which is not what some\n\n29\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.030\npeople think.\n\n30\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.660\nIt really is just about making sure\nthat we've got all of our information.\n\n31\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.690\nAnd it's not really even about having\nall of our information in one place.\n\n32\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.770\nIt's about having information, so that we\ncan get access to that information and\n\n33\n00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.990\nto allow us to make informed decisions.\n\n34\n00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.070\nIf we don't have anything recorded, and we\ndon't have anything written down anywhere,\n\n35\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.130\nthen all of our decisions are going\nto be based on I think so.\n\n36\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.790\nI think that's not good enough.\n\n37\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.830\nWe have to make decisions\nbased on evidence.\n\n38\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.620\nAnd so,\nthat's what Knowledge Management does.\n\n39\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.270\nIt ensures that we have not just\nonly got the evidence in place,\n\n40\n00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.065\nbut that we have access to that evidence,\nas well.\n\n41\n00:01:49.065 --> 00:01:51.348\nLet's take a look at the purpose\nof Knowledge Management.\n\n42\n00:01:51.348 --> 00:01:55.363\nAnd you'll see that it's there to share\nperspectives, and ideas, and experience,\n\n43\n00:01:55.363 --> 00:01:56.700\nand information.\n\n44\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.080\nTo ensure that they're available to\nthe right person at the right time to\n\n45\n00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.330\nenable informed decision making.\n\n46\n00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.260\nWhenever I see the word wisdom,\n\n47\n00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.190\nI automatically think of\nKnowledge Management.\n\n48\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.750\nAnd whenever I see the word decision\nmaking, I think of Knowledge Management.\n\n49\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.700\nIt's really about enabling us, as in the\nservice provider, to be more efficient.\n\n50\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.050\nAnd to be able to make decisions\nthat are actually effective\n\n51\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.300\nby having that right\ninformation available to us.\n\n52\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.830\nSo it means that we have the right\ninformation available to us.\n\n53\n00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.701\nThat our customers and our users also have\nthe right information available to them to\n\n54\n00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.766\nenable their decision making too.\n\n55\n00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:40.460\nIn other words enabling\ntheir use of our services.\n\n56\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.450\nDon't forget,\n\n57\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.170\nwhen I keep saying this at the start\nof every single episode that a service\n\n58\n00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.540\nis a means of delivering value which is\nperceived by facilitating an outcome.\n\n59\n00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.310\nAnd sometime just having FAQ's available\n\n60\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.610\nto our users helps them\nto facilitate an outcome.\n\n61\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.880\nBecause if they can log on to an FAQ area\nto gain information about maybe how to add\n\n62\n00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.360\ntwo cells together in Excel, for instance,\nthen that delivers value to them.\n\n63\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.780\nSo this is about enabling\ninformed decision making.\n\n64\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.965\nIt's about delivering value but\n\n65\n00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:19.113\nby having the right information\navailable at our fingertips.\n\n66\n00:03:19.113 --> 00:03:23.985\nSo we have what we call a service\nknowledge management system which\n\n67\n00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:26.508\ngives us access to all of our data.\n\n68\n00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:30.232\nNow I do not want you to\nthink of a service knowledge\n\n69\n00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:33.880\nmanagement system as\nbeing a physical concept.\n\n70\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.500\nIt's not, a service knowledge management\nsystem is actually a logical concept.\n\n71\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.630\nAnd it's a logical concept that looks\nat the relationships between all of\n\n72\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.440\nour data sources.\n\n73\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.940\nSo think about all of our databases.\n\n74\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.200\nThink about our configuration\nmanagement database and\n\n75\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.390\nour configuration management system.\n\n76\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.171\nAnd when we looked at service asset and\nconfiguration management,\n\n77\n00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.810\nI said that we need to have\na federated database system.\n\n78\n00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.280\nIn other words, we need to ensure that\nif we update information in one place,\n\n79\n00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.489\nthen we update information in all of\nthe other databases automatically.\n\n80\n00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.090\nAnd then I went on a little bit further\nbecause then I started talking about\n\n81\n00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.010\nthat interaction between configuration\nmanagement and incident management.\n\n82\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.570\nAnd I mentioned that you know when\nyou call the service desk and\n\n83\n00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.020\nthey verify your user ID with you,\nthen you verify the information.\n\n84\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.060\nAnd if a service desk analyst says,\n\n85\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.400\nwell I've got you down as\nbeing on the third floor.\n\n86\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.160\nAnd you say,\nno I'm not I'm on the first floor now,\n\n87\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.420\nthen they update the information that\nthey have in the call logging tool.\n\n88\n00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.750\nAnd that automatically updates\nthe information in the configuration\n\n89\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.930\nmanagement system.\n\n90\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.880\nSo now I've just inferred just by saying\nthough that there’s a relationship\n\n91\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.690\nthat exists between incident management\nand configuration management.\n\n92\n00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.930\nAnd that’s right, there is.\n\n93\n00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.110\nSo now we're gonna have\nthose same relationships and\n\n94\n00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.500\nwe're gonna put that into place with\nall of our other databases too.\n\n95\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.400\nSuch as our availability\nmanagement information system or\n\n96\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.320\nour capacity management information system\nor our customer agreement database.\n\n97\n00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.708\nOr our service portfolio with our pipeline\nand our catalog and our retired services.\n\n98\n00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:18.180\nAnd our change management system and\nour request fulfillment system and\n\n99\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.868\nour known error database.\n\n100\n00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:22.700\nAnd all of these other databases,\nour supplier and\n\n101\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.860\ncontract management information system.\n\n102\n00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.360\nWe've got all of the databases that\nwe have within IT are listed here\n\n103\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.250\nin our material that you can download.\n\n104\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.630\nBut just think of the other\ndatabases that we have within IT.\n\n105\n00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.350\nWe have got so many different databases.\n\n106\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.480\nA database is a storage system for data.\n\n107\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.010\nIf we update data in one particular place,\n\n108\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.710\nwe shouldn't be updating\nit somewhere else.\n\n109\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:02.830\nIf we do that, if we have to duplicate our\neffort, then not only is it not efficient,\n\n110\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.649\nbut also it leaves me questioning\nwhich data is accurate?\n\n111\n00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:10.039\nWhere is our accuracy?\n\n112\n00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.981\nSo service knowledge management system,\n\n113\n00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:18.900\nas we've referred to in that slide,\nthat SKMS, is not a physical concept.\n\n114\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.666\nIt's a logical concept that refers to\nthe relationships between all of our\n\n115\n00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:24.140\ndatabases.\n\n116\n00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.310\nAnd so it allows me to\ninterrogate all of our data\n\n117\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.660\ncontained in our databases in one go.\n\n118\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.920\nThat's what knowledge management is about.\n\n119\n00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.220\nNow I've referred to data a lot, but\n\n120\n00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.340\nthese are data sources where all of our\nindividual databases are data sources.\n\n121\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.860\nAnd on their own,\nthey have very limited use.\n\n122\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.460\nIf I just think about incident management\nas a core login system on its own,\n\n123\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.640\nit has very limited use.\n\n124\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.040\nBut I add in relationships\nto other services or\n\n125\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.560\nto other tools and adding in relationships\nto my configuration management system.\n\n126\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.480\nI add in relationships to\nmy network discovery tools.\n\n127\n00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.910\nI add in relationships to a tool that\nwill allow remote desktop support for\n\n128\n00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:18.024\ninstance, then all of a sudden, I have\ninformation available at my fingertips.\n\n129\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.150\nI mentioned those words previously\nwhen I started talking about\n\n130\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.870\nconfiguration management,\nwhen we looked at service asset and\n\n131\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.330\nconfiguration management, or SACM.\n\n132\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.680\nAnd I said, watch out for these words\ncuz they're gonna be very important.\n\n133\n00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.970\nAnd now I'm using them again, and here\nthey are in the slide in front of you, but\n\n134\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.720\nthere are other words in there.\n\n135\n00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.640\nThe word knowledge and the word wisdom.\n\n136\n00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.310\nYou see, we have what we call\nthe data to wisdom tree or DIKW,\n\n137\n00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.783\nas we like to call it data,\ninformation, knowledge and wisdom.\n\n138\n00:07:51.783 --> 00:07:53.584\nAnd it simply works like this,\n\n139\n00:07:53.584 --> 00:07:57.131\non their own individual data\nsources have very limited use.\n\n140\n00:07:57.131 --> 00:08:00.112\nSo what I do is I add in relationships.\n\n141\n00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:02.225\nAnd that gives me information.\n\n142\n00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:08.564\nI analyze those relationships and that\ngives me knowledge, tells me something.\n\n143\n00:08:08.564 --> 00:08:12.904\nAnd I use that knowledge, normally this\nknowledge is presented by way of a nice\n\n144\n00:08:12.904 --> 00:08:15.158\npretty picture or a graph or something.\n\n145\n00:08:15.158 --> 00:08:21.190\nI use that knowledge to make an informed\ndecision, thereby giving me wisdom.\n\n146\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.863\nNow, let's think about this\nin a little bit more depth.\n\n147\n00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:27.190\nYou see, we can automate a lot of this.\n\n148\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.900\nWe can automate data collection.\n\n149\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.140\nWe can use discovery tools, etc.\n\n150\n00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.890\nAnd we can even automate\nour use of relationships.\n\n151\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.616\nRemember that automation of the service\ndesk analyst updated a field in\n\n152\n00:08:38.616 --> 00:08:43.658\nthe core login system and that\nautomatically updates, via relationship,\n\n153\n00:08:43.658 --> 00:08:48.280\nthe updates the data in our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n154\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.582\nSo we can automate information and\nthereby we can automate knowledge,\n\n155\n00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:56.610\nthat production of those reports but\nyou can't automate wisdom.\n\n156\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.740\n[LAUGH] You still don't.\n\n157\n00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.630\nJust because we produce\na nice pretty picture,\n\n158\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.569\ndoesn't mean that somebody's gonna\nmake the right decision from them.\n\n159\n00:09:02.569 --> 00:09:03.611\n&gt;&gt; And use it in the right way, right.\n\n160\n00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:05.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n161\n00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.820\nBut by that same token,\n\n162\n00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.100\nI've talked about making a decision\nfrom a nice pretty picture from a graph.\n\n163\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.859\nWe will tell you that it's never\ngoing to be efficient to have 10,000\n\n164\n00:09:15.859 --> 00:09:19.719\ngraphs produced when no one's\nmaking a decision from them.\n\n165\n00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:23.584\nAnd so we will tell you that, quite\nsimply, if you can't make a decision from\n\n166\n00:09:23.584 --> 00:09:26.738\nthat report, or nobody is making\ndecisions from that report,\n\n167\n00:09:26.738 --> 00:09:29.700\nthen really you shouldn't\nbe producing that report.\n\n168\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.060\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point,\nJo, because I mean,\n\n169\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.310\neven in different types of software that\nI've worked with and you get these reports\n\n170\n00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.150\ngenerated, sometimes you can get\nalmost like a book of information.\n\n171\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.390\nAnd especially if it's really tedious or\njust technical information and\n\n172\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.780\nyou're sitting down at the meeting and\nyou're passing this information, or\n\n173\n00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.650\nhowever your method of delivery there.\n\n174\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.340\nBut it's like you don't even wanna look\nat it, so why would anyone else want to?\n\n175\n00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.830\nSo understanding who will be looking and\nusing this information is really huge.\n\n176\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:02.415\n&gt;&gt; People get something by advertising and\nby media marketing sometimes.\n\n177\n00:10:02.415 --> 00:10:06.739\nAnd I'll tell people all the time when\nthey are going out to evaluate say,\n\n178\n00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:10.576\nany particular tool and no matter\nwhat that tool is just because it\n\n179\n00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:15.280\nsays on the box that it produces 500\nreports means absolutely nothing.\n\n180\n00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.643\nWhen none of those reports\nare relevant for you.\n\n181\n00:10:18.643 --> 00:10:20.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You gotta be able\n\n182\n00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:20.754\nto use,\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n183\n00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:21.669\n&gt;&gt; Those reports.\n\n184\n00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:25.275\nAnd so,\nI don't care if it produces 500 reports.\n\n185\n00:10:25.275 --> 00:10:29.232\nIf I don't need those reports,\nif they're not telling me anything,\n\n186\n00:10:29.232 --> 00:10:33.995\nthey're not allowing me to improve and\nthey're not allowing me to make decisions,\n\n187\n00:10:33.995 --> 00:10:36.086\nthen those reports are irrelevant.\n\n188\n00:10:36.086 --> 00:10:41.123\nAnd as you said, years ago and nowadays\nmost things are done electronically,\n\n189\n00:10:41.123 --> 00:10:44.403\nbut years ago,\nI used to sit at my desk sometimes and\n\n190\n00:10:44.403 --> 00:10:48.625\nI'd get a book this thick of reports\ndelivered to me every month.\n\n191\n00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:52.145\nAnd I would look at them and say,\nI don't need half of these reports.\n\n192\n00:10:52.145 --> 00:10:54.680\nI don't need to look at these reports.\n\n193\n00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.710\nIf I want them and I want that\ninformation, I know that it's there.\n\n194\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.380\nBut I don't need these reports and\n\n195\n00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.010\nthis is exactly what knowledge\nmanagement will tell you.\n\n196\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:08.432\nIs that, if you can't make a decision from\nit or you're now going to make a decision\n\n197\n00:11:08.432 --> 00:11:13.171\nfrom it, then it is not efficient for\nyou to be producing those reports.\n\n198\n00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:15.906\nIt's just reporting for\nthe sake of reporting.\n\n199\n00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:18.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well that sounds like fun.\n\n200\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.820\nLet's just go and\ngenerate some more reports, Jo.\n\n201\n00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.342\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well exactly, I could wallpaper my\n\n202\n00:11:23.342 --> 00:11:27.310\nwhole entire houses for the amount\nof irrelevant reports I've seen.\n\n203\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.250\nTrust me.\n\n204\n00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.273\nI mean, they look pretty.\n\n205\n00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:30.821\nThey have nice, pretty colors on them.\n\n206\n00:11:30.821 --> 00:11:32.277\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:11:32.277 --> 00:11:35.264\n&gt;&gt; So, knowledge really is all about\n\n208\n00:11:35.264 --> 00:11:39.899\nhaving the available information\nat the right time to\n\n209\n00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:43.350\nenable those informed decisions.\n\n210\n00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:48.710\nBut we have to, as we've already said,\nwe have to be able to make a decision from\n\n211\n00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.940\nany knowledge that we have\npresented in front of us.\n\n212\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:57.680\nAnd knowledge includes things like\nwhen solve utilization of the service.\n\n213\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.320\nIt includes things like risk awareness\nas well and risk management.\n\n214\n00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.250\nKnowledge is really\nthe analysis of the information\n\n215\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.510\nthat we have at our fingertips,\nthat's all knowledge is.\n\n216\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.750\nAnd that's to say, normally this is\nproduced by way of a nice pretty picture.\n\n217\n00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:17.320\nSo when I talk about not producing reports\njust for the sake of producing reports,\n\n218\n00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.530\nwe should always have policies for\nwhat reports are produced,\n\n219\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:26.580\nwhy we need each report, and\nwhen are we going to review each report?\n\n220\n00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.840\nAnd this is not just about reports, this\nis about all of our documentation as well.\n\n221\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.650\nAll of our policies, all of our plans and\n\n222\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.720\nall of our documentation should\nbe reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n223\n00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.893\nI see data sources and\nI see document repository systems,\n\n224\n00:12:41.893 --> 00:12:44.085\nEDRMSs we like to call them.\n\n225\n00:12:44.085 --> 00:12:47.391\nSharePoint is one example, where we\njust keep building and building and\n\n226\n00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:48.539\nbuilding and building.\n\n227\n00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.965\nAnd while we'll tell you you should never\noverwrite any document at that same time,\n\n228\n00:12:54.965 --> 00:12:59.017\nthere should be relevant version\ncontrol in place so we should-\n\n229\n00:12:59.017 --> 00:13:00.810\n&gt;&gt; Some kind of archival method?\n\n230\n00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:06.644\n&gt;&gt; Right, we should always be checking\nthe relevance of any document.\n\n231\n00:13:06.644 --> 00:13:09.369\nAnd some documents just simply\naren't relevant anymore.\n\n232\n00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:13.580\nAnd we should always be updating\nour processes and our procedures.\n\n233\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.460\nAnd if all else fails,\nwe should be checking them every year and\n\n234\n00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.470\nwe should be endorsing\nthem at least every year.\n\n235\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.520\nJust to say yes this is still relevant.\n\n236\n00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.110\nSome things don't change but a lot does.\n\n237\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.220\n&gt;&gt; Right and some, and\nI hate to keep coming back to this,\n\n238\n00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.920\nbut some industries have those\nregulations that, hey I do have to.\n\n239\n00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.512\nAnd data retention, I mean,\n\n240\n00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:35.835\nwe're in a day in age where\nthere's data coming out our ears.\n\n241\n00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:36.900\nThere's so much data.\n\n242\n00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.380\nAnd so how are we gonna be managing this,\n\n243\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.350\nmaking sure that we do have the proper\nlifecycle to, I don't know however they\n\n244\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:48.160\nwant to get rid of that data to\nexpire it or destroy it or whatever.\n\n245\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.802\n&gt;&gt; Well, and you have to bring in\nregulations as far as that's concerned and\n\n246\n00:13:51.802 --> 00:13:54.410\nthink about legislative requirements too.\n\n247\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.359\nBecause think about our tax information.\n\n248\n00:13:56.359 --> 00:14:00.028\nNow, different countries around the world\nhave got different regulations and\n\n249\n00:14:00.028 --> 00:14:03.390\nlegislation on tax information and\nall accounting information.\n\n250\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.359\nFor the most part, the standard seems\nto be across the globe ten years.\n\n251\n00:14:06.359 --> 00:14:10.260\nWe need to retain ten years worth\nof accounting information within\n\n252\n00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.381\nan organization.\n\n253\n00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:15.860\nWell who retains an operating system for\nten years?\n\n254\n00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:21.190\nWho retains the same version\nof software for ten years?\n\n255\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.650\nSo if somebody came to me and said,\n\n256\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.400\ncan I have access to your\naccounts from ten years ago?\n\n257\n00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.320\nI would think, well you can.\n\n258\n00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.350\nI've archived the files.\n\n259\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.850\nYou can have access but\n\n260\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:36.000\nby the way, you can't retrieve the files\nbecause you can't put them back on this\n\n261\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.110\noperating system because this\noperating system doesn't exist.\n\n262\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.960\nOr this particular version of the software\nthat we're using doesn't exist anymore.\n\n263\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.419\nSo you have to think about now, that's\nall part of your data retention policy.\n\n264\n00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:51.920\nAnd this goes back to service portfolio\nmanagement way back in service strategy.\n\n265\n00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.760\nWhen we're retiring a service,\nyou see, we never ever\n\n266\n00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.530\ncompletely get rid of all of the\ninformation about a particular service.\n\n267\n00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.430\nBecause when it comes to getting access\nto some of our information from,\n\n268\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.820\nsay ten years ago,\nthen we need to know how to do it.\n\n269\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.170\nNow some government legislation,\n\n270\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.950\nsome government departments are okay with\nus just being able to have access to it.\n\n271\n00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.480\nAnd they'll say, that's okay, we've got\nways of accessing it if we need to.\n\n272\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.207\nBut some governments around the world\nactually require you to be able to\n\n273\n00:15:25.207 --> 00:15:26.641\naccess it yourself.\n\n274\n00:15:26.641 --> 00:15:31.250\nIn which case, we're talking ten years,\nthat could be a very long time.\n\n275\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.275\nAnd it is a very long time in terms of IT.\n\n276\n00:15:33.275 --> 00:15:37.000\nSo, we have to think about\nlegislative requirements.\n\n277\n00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.370\nThink about the industry\nsector that we're in also.\n\n278\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.801\nDepending on that industry sector,\nwe may also have additional\n\n279\n00:15:43.801 --> 00:15:48.734\nrequirements such as the banking sector or\nsuch as the medical sector.\n\n280\n00:15:48.734 --> 00:15:52.160\nWe may have additional requirements.\n\n281\n00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.322\nI mean, can you imagine if your hospital\nsuddenly decided, or your local doctor,\n\n282\n00:15:56.322 --> 00:16:00.364\nsuddenly decided that they were going to\nget rid of all of your medical history and\n\n283\n00:16:00.364 --> 00:16:02.462\nanything that was older than five years.\n\n284\n00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:05.803\nBecause their data retention policy said\nthey didn't have to keep hold of that.\n\n285\n00:16:05.803 --> 00:16:07.856\n&gt;&gt; And I can barely even\nremember what I wore yesterday.\n\n286\n00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:09.539\nSo how would I even know my birth data?\n\n287\n00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:12.465\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey look, I've got a daughter\n\n288\n00:16:12.465 --> 00:16:15.162\nwho doesn't even remember her\nown birthday, and she's only 20.\n\n289\n00:16:15.162 --> 00:16:19.670\n[LAUGH] So this is something that\nactually we have to think about,\n\n290\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.772\nbecause we don't keep things\non pieces of paper anymore.\n\n291\n00:16:23.772 --> 00:16:27.244\nBut when I was born, all my medical\nhistory was on a piece of paper,\n\n292\n00:16:27.244 --> 00:16:31.310\nbut it's not anymore, and\nthat doesn't get transferred around.\n\n293\n00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.060\nThat has to be accessed and\nthat's very, very important,\n\n294\n00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.242\nand it could even be life or death.\n\n295\n00:16:37.242 --> 00:16:41.556\nI know in previous episodes,\nwe've mentioned that is a possibility, but\n\n296\n00:16:41.556 --> 00:16:43.891\nit is a very rare possibility nowadays.\n\n297\n00:16:43.891 --> 00:16:48.394\nSo knowledge management is incredibly\nimportant in terms of defining\n\n298\n00:16:48.394 --> 00:16:49.844\nretention policies,\n\n299\n00:16:49.844 --> 00:16:54.589\nand defining policies for what data we\nhave access to and what data we see.\n\n300\n00:16:54.589 --> 00:16:56.340\nNow when I mentioned at the beginning,\n\n301\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.049\nthat knowledge management was\nabout ensuring that the right\n\n302\n00:16:59.049 --> 00:17:02.740\nperson has access to the right\ninformation to enable informed decisions.\n\n303\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:07.493\nI wanna go back to that, and\nI wanna just say the right person.\n\n304\n00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:09.340\nI don't wanna say everybody.\n\n305\n00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.569\nIt's not about everybody having\naccess to all of our data.\n\n306\n00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.300\nIt's making sure that,\nagain our data is access controlled.\n\n307\n00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.470\nSo we're going to use user\nprofiling to do that.\n\n308\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.197\nWe're gonna use tools like\nMicrosoft Active Directory\n\n309\n00:17:22.197 --> 00:17:26.647\nto control access to our data,\nto control who has access towards.\n\n310\n00:17:26.647 --> 00:17:30.905\nWe have to ensure the integrity of\nour data, think CIA confidentiality,\n\n311\n00:17:30.905 --> 00:17:32.701\nintegrity and availability.\n\n312\n00:17:32.701 --> 00:17:35.626\nThat is only available to those\nthat should have access to it.\n\n313\n00:17:35.626 --> 00:17:40.194\nSo what else do we want to, go back to\nservice strategies, think governance, and\n\n314\n00:17:40.194 --> 00:17:41.268\nwe want to be open.\n\n315\n00:17:41.268 --> 00:17:46.060\nAnd we want to be transparent,\nat the same time we're talking about data.\n\n316\n00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.630\nAnd we are talking about the fact that\n\n317\n00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.550\npeople should only have access to the data\nthat they need to have access to.\n\n318\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.630\nSo don't disregard security,\njust because we're talking about open and\n\n319\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.395\ntransparent governance, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:04.288\nSo again, let's go back to our DIKW,\nthen that we started with.\n\n321\n00:18:04.288 --> 00:18:09.649\nAnd we've got our data, and our data\nsources should be highly structured.\n\n322\n00:18:09.649 --> 00:18:12.408\nAnd our data is just those pieces of,\nwell,\n\n323\n00:18:12.408 --> 00:18:16.226\nI don't know what other word\nto use other than information.\n\n324\n00:18:16.226 --> 00:18:18.386\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that said, so\n\n325\n00:18:18.386 --> 00:18:20.709\ndata is just pieces of data, okay?\n\n326\n00:18:20.709 --> 00:18:26.380\nAnd information, well, we add in those\nrelationships to give us that information.\n\n327\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.820\nAnd we analyze that information\nto give us the knowledge.\n\n328\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.890\nAnd we present that by way of a nice\npretty picture that allows us to\n\n329\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.330\nmake decisions, thereby giving us wisdom.\n\n330\n00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.460\nI love the fact that it mentions\ncommon sense judgments, and\n\n331\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:47.910\nI talk about common sense a lot in ITIL,\nbecause we can't remove common sense.\n\n332\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.880\nITIL fails where somebody has tried\nto take ITIL out of the box, or\n\n333\n00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.010\nout of the book and try to implement\nit in a one size fits all approach.\n\n334\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.440\nThat's not the case.\n\n335\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.952\nAnd wisdom is in the context\nto your organization as well.\n\n336\n00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:06.758\nBecause I might make a certain decision by\nlooking at the graph, and you might make\n\n337\n00:19:06.758 --> 00:19:11.300\na completely different decision\nunderstanding your organization, okay?\n\n338\n00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.110\nSo here we've put that in way\nof a nice pretty picture.\n\n339\n00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:19.044\nJust so that, well,\njust really helps you to understand that.\n\n340\n00:19:19.044 --> 00:19:22.017\nSo as we move through data,\ninformation, knowledge, and\n\n341\n00:19:22.017 --> 00:19:26.620\nwisdom where I did more context and\nwhere I did no greater understanding.\n\n342\n00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.950\nNow I mentioned configuration\nmanagement system, and\n\n343\n00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.560\nI mentioned all of these data sources,\nand look at them.\n\n344\n00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.394\n[LAUGH] And right there in the bottom\nright-hand corner it says, and many more.\n\n345\n00:19:36.394 --> 00:19:42.031\nOkay, service knowledge management\nsystem is a logical concept that\n\n346\n00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:47.198\nrefers to the relationships\nbetween all of those data sources.\n\n347\n00:19:47.198 --> 00:19:51.581\nHowever, what I do want to point out is,\nand if I can find my cursor here.\n\n348\n00:19:51.581 --> 00:19:54.764\nWe have our configuration\nmanagement databases,\n\n349\n00:19:54.764 --> 00:19:59.285\nwhich we know are federated into our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n350\n00:19:59.285 --> 00:20:04.273\nAnd so, everything comes through our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n351\n00:20:04.273 --> 00:20:07.419\nWhy do you think that is Cherokee,\ncan you remember?\n\n352\n00:20:07.419 --> 00:20:08.322\n&gt;&gt; What was the question?\n\n353\n00:20:08.322 --> 00:20:10.663\n&gt;&gt; Everything comes through-\n&gt;&gt; I wanna make sure I answer right,\n\n354\n00:20:10.663 --> 00:20:12.088\ncuz I'm slowly failing here.\n\n355\n00:20:12.088 --> 00:20:13.743\n&gt;&gt; I know I'm not gonna\nslip her the answer.\n\n356\n00:20:13.743 --> 00:20:14.798\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n357\n00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:19.166\nwhy do you think everything comes through\nour configuration management system?\n\n358\n00:20:19.166 --> 00:20:21.838\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n359\n00:20:21.838 --> 00:20:24.770\nOkay, [LAUGH] nothing like pressure Jo.\n\n360\n00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:29.606\nOkay, everything comes through\nthe configuration management system, so\n\n361\n00:20:29.606 --> 00:20:31.730\nthat we can have one single copy.\n\n362\n00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.340\nBecause if we have\nmultiple discrepancies or\n\n363\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.980\nrepositories with conflicting information,\n\n364\n00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:44.760\nthen that's gonna cause problems for\nour, well, for everyone involved.\n\n365\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.719\n&gt;&gt; Let me sum that up for you then.\n\n366\n00:20:45.719 --> 00:20:46.964\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n367\n00:20:46.964 --> 00:20:48.600\n&gt;&gt; It's because our configuration\n\n368\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.522\nmanagement system is our single source\nof accurate and reliable information.\n\n369\n00:20:52.522 --> 00:20:53.547\n&gt;&gt; Boom.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n370\n00:20:53.547 --> 00:20:54.505\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n371\n00:20:54.505 --> 00:20:55.400\n&gt;&gt; Right? [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n372\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.430\nyou've got exactly the right answer,\nyou see.\n\n373\n00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.476\nShe has been paying attention in our\nprevious episodes, I'm impressed.\n\n374\n00:21:02.476 --> 00:21:03.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:04.545\n&gt;&gt; It is our single source of\n\n376\n00:21:04.545 --> 00:21:08.170\nconsistent and accurate and\nreliable information.\n\n377\n00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.947\nAnd therefore, consider this to\nbe our master copy of data about\n\n378\n00:21:12.947 --> 00:21:15.871\nall of our components of our services.\n\n379\n00:21:15.871 --> 00:21:20.312\nAnd therefore, that's why all of our\nrelationships go through configuration\n\n380\n00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:22.895\nmanagement, because we\nwant to ensure that,\n\n381\n00:21:22.895 --> 00:21:26.754\nthat information is kept in\nconfiguration management is up to date.\n\n382\n00:21:26.754 --> 00:21:30.390\nOkay, so\nwhen does Knowledge Management happen?\n\n383\n00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.091\nAnd what starts\nthe Knowledge Management process?\n\n384\n00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.715\nWell, any time we want to store data,\n\n385\n00:21:35.715 --> 00:21:39.420\nthat's when we will utilize\nKnowledge Management.\n\n386\n00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.280\nAnd the most of the time,\nwe don't even know we're doing it.\n\n387\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.640\nAnd that's okay by me, because Knowledge\nManagement, it's a common sense approach.\n\n388\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.649\nAnd Knowledge Management is something\nthat everybody should be aware of,\n\n389\n00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:53.439\nbut not necessarily be aware of.\n\n390\n00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:56.279\nIn other words,\nwe have all these data retention policies.\n\n391\n00:21:56.279 --> 00:22:00.702\nAnd we have policies for updating all\nof our information, but you know what,\n\n392\n00:22:00.702 --> 00:22:04.855\nit should be so natural that we don't\neven realize that we're doing it,\n\n393\n00:22:04.855 --> 00:22:09.790\nbecause it should be the natural part of\nhow we manage all of our information.\n\n394\n00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.430\nAnd so, of course,\n\n395\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:15.510\nall of our input, that's all of\nthe data that we are inputting.\n\n396\n00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.030\nAnd the outputs are just those decisions,\nthe decision that we're making.\n\n397\n00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:24.230\nAnd Knowledge Management doesn't have\nnecessarily interfaces with all of our\n\n398\n00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:29.430\nother processes, because Knowledge\nManagement takes ownership of that data,\n\n399\n00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.720\nthat all of our other processes utilize.\n\n400\n00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.100\nSo all of those databases, Knowledge\nManagement ensures that we've got\n\n401\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.040\nthe right policies in\nplace to manage that data.\n\n402\n00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.220\nSo who uses our data?\n\n403\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.010\nWell, and how do they use it?\n\n404\n00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:48.940\nWell, of course our operations staff use\nour data, because they are people that\n\n405\n00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.219\nare operating our services on\na live day-to-day environments, and\n\n406\n00:22:53.219 --> 00:22:54.689\nour transition staff.\n\n407\n00:22:54.689 --> 00:22:58.194\nWell, obviously they're building services,\nand so\n\n408\n00:22:58.194 --> 00:23:01.628\ntherefore they're using\nall of their experiences.\n\n409\n00:23:01.628 --> 00:23:05.933\nThey're using all of their service\nlevel agreements and our OLAs, and\n\n410\n00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:08.550\nour underpinning contracts as well.\n\n411\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:14.400\nAll of the data that we have, they're\nusing to build, and test, and deploy.\n\n412\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.520\nAll of our live services,\n\n413\n00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.960\nand of course, service transition\nwhich is where we are right now.\n\n414\n00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.261\nAll of the results from all our testing as\nwell, that also needs to be documented and\n\n415\n00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:24.312\nneeds to be stored.\n\n416\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.065\nSo what do we have to achieve\nthen in Knowledge Management?\n\n417\n00:23:28.065 --> 00:23:31.454\nWell, it's about having the right\ninformation available at the right time to\n\n418\n00:23:31.454 --> 00:23:32.905\nenable inform decision making.\n\n419\n00:23:34.065 --> 00:23:39.199\nWhat we want to have is increase access to\nthat service Knowledge Management system,\n\n420\n00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:40.782\nand it says in the top KPI.\n\n421\n00:23:40.782 --> 00:23:47.154\nBut we want to have access\nto quality information.\n\n422\n00:23:47.154 --> 00:23:51.440\nI do not want, and\none thing I absolutely hate, and\n\n423\n00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.724\nthis is my personal pet passion,\nis when I log onto somebody's\n\n424\n00:23:56.724 --> 00:24:01.631\nSharePoint or somebody's EDRMS system,\nand I just see.\n\n425\n00:24:01.631 --> 00:24:06.100\nMillions of folders there\nthat really haven't been\n\n426\n00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.050\norganized in any particular way.\n\n427\n00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:13.070\nAnd when you're looking for something,\nthere aren't any hyperlinks between\n\n428\n00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:18.030\nvarious documents and between various\nfolders, and it's just a mess.\n\n429\n00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.692\nAnd this is where knowledge\nmanagement comes in to it and\n\n430\n00:24:20.692 --> 00:24:22.061\nwill sort of organize this.\n\n431\n00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:26.770\nAnd will try and make it as fairly\nas intuitive as it possibly can be.\n\n432\n00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.116\nBut as l said this is what\none of my biggest bugbears,\n\n433\n00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:34.680\nthat as we start to build up our\ndatabase within knowledge management,\n\n434\n00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.799\nthen we end up with kind of confusion and\na bit of a mess, and we don't want that.\n\n435\n00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:40.489\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n436\n00:24:40.489 --> 00:24:45.525\n&gt;&gt; When it says here we want reduced time\nand effort to support services that means\n\n437\n00:24:45.525 --> 00:24:50.440\nreduced time and effort to access the data\nthat we need to support services.\n\n438\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.750\nThink about our service desk.\n\n439\n00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.370\nOur service desk will access\nour known area database and\n\n440\n00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.140\nmaybe they access FAQ areas.\n\n441\n00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:02.050\nService desks may also use scripts and\nother tools that are documented and\n\n442\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.480\nare kept within a database, and therefore\nis controlled by knowledge management.\n\n443\n00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.290\nAnd you know what?\n\n444\n00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:11.650\nWe want swift access to that because\nthat makes us more efficient.\n\n445\n00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:17.100\nIf I have to wade through 10,000 different\nfiles before I can get to the right one,\n\n446\n00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:22.120\nthen that actually increases the time\nit takes me to resolve an incident.\n\n447\n00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.970\nSo look at that KPI about a higher\nresolution rate at lower support levels.\n\n448\n00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:35.520\nIf I, as a service desk analyst, can get\naccess to my script and to my frequently\n\n449\n00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:41.030\nasked questions quicker, then that means\nI'm resolving an incident quicker.\n\n450\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:45.250\nWhich means that actually,\nwe're increasing customer satisfaction.\n\n451\n00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.470\nSo, that's what we want to get to.\n\n452\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.127\nI mean, the one above that talks about\nincreased percentage solved by relation to\n\n453\n00:25:53.127 --> 00:25:54.300\nthe known area database.\n\n454\n00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.730\nThat's what we want to get to.\n\n455\n00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.600\nWe want to have efficient access to\nour knowledge management systems,\n\n456\n00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.460\nso that we can resolve incidents quicker.\n\n457\n00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.520\nAnd we also want access to standards and\npolicies, etc.\n\n458\n00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.255\nAs an outsider coming into your\norganization If I say to you,\n\n459\n00:26:12.255 --> 00:26:15.626\nshow me the template for\nyour service level agreement,\n\n460\n00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:19.733\nI wanna be able to see the template\nto your service level agreement.\n\n461\n00:26:19.733 --> 00:26:25.019\nI don't want you to have to\nspend 15 minutes, 20 minutes,\n\n462\n00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:30.545\ncall 5 different people in order\nto get access to that template.\n\n463\n00:26:30.545 --> 00:26:32.635\nThis is what knowledge\nmanagement is here for.\n\n464\n00:26:32.635 --> 00:26:37.385\nAnd if you have to spend 15,\n20 minutes and call 5 different people in\n\n465\n00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:41.885\norder to get me a template for your\nservice level agreements, then that alone\n\n466\n00:26:41.885 --> 00:26:45.435\ntells me that your knowledge management is\nnot working efficiently or effectively.\n\n467\n00:26:46.672 --> 00:26:49.300\nSo straightaway just by\nasking that one question,\n\n468\n00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.930\nI've got insight into the two processes\nalready with in your organization.\n\n469\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:59.250\nSo knowledge management actually does have\ntheir tendrils into every other process.\n\n470\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:06.660\nAnd knowledge is important to us and\nthe data that we have is important and\n\n471\n00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.800\nwe should be able to access\nit in an efficient way.\n\n472\n00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.260\nWe're not trying to create\na single repository.\n\n473\n00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:20.190\nWe're trying to create cohesion,\nand we're trying to introduce\n\n474\n00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:26.200\nthe relationships between\nall of our repositories.\n\n475\n00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.130\nAnd so we want to break down\nthe barriers that people put up,\n\n476\n00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.820\nand people do put up barriers,\nunfortunately.\n\n477\n00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.800\nThat's my information and\nI want to keep it.\n\n478\n00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.583\nYou don't need to know that.\n\n479\n00:27:36.583 --> 00:27:41.330\nAnd this is not about having\na sort of a need to know policy.\n\n480\n00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:46.410\nThis is simply about having\nvery swift access to that data\n\n481\n00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.860\nto enable informed decision making.\n\n482\n00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.910\nThis is not about focusing\non the tools themselves but\n\n483\n00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.490\nfocusing on the relationships\nbetween the tools.\n\n484\n00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.750\nSo on an ongoing basis, we have to\nhave an investment in our resources.\n\n485\n00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.650\nWe have to have an investment\nin our tools, but\n\n486\n00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:08.060\nwe also have to have that investment,\nthat personal investment in\n\n487\n00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:13.880\nwanting to capture knowledge and actually\nwanting to share knowledge as well.\n\n488\n00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.950\nAnd of course, we've gotta make sure\nthat our knowledge is, well, in date.\n\n489\n00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.320\nIt's up to date, that it's relevant still.\n\n490\n00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.524\nSo, let's go back to our foundation recap.\n\n491\n00:28:24.524 --> 00:28:27.766\nAnd then let's take a look at some of\nthe roles that we have within knowledge\n\n492\n00:28:27.766 --> 00:28:28.398\nmanagement.\n\n493\n00:28:28.398 --> 00:28:34.475\nAnd as per usual we have a process\nowner that takes ownership of knowledge\n\n494\n00:28:34.475 --> 00:28:38.095\nmanagement, and so they take that\naccountability for knowledge management.\n\n495\n00:28:38.095 --> 00:28:41.475\nThey make sure that knowledge\nmanagement happens.\n\n496\n00:28:41.475 --> 00:28:45.755\nSo they are the people that they're\nyour owner for knowledge management.\n\n497\n00:28:45.755 --> 00:28:49.825\nIt's the person that ensures compliance\nwith our organizational policies for\n\n498\n00:28:49.825 --> 00:28:51.075\ndata retention.\n\n499\n00:28:51.075 --> 00:28:54.525\nAs well as any other external polices,\n\n500\n00:28:54.525 --> 00:28:58.829\nsuch as legislative requirements,\netc., as we've already looked at.\n\n501\n00:28:59.925 --> 00:29:03.210\nYour process owner is\nthe person that maintains\n\n502\n00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.390\nour service knowledge management system,\n\n503\n00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:10.580\nin other words, that has accountability\nfor all of those relationships.\n\n504\n00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.790\nWorking with the business,\nour business relationship management and\n\n505\n00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:18.390\nour strategy to determine\nwhat our policy should be.\n\n506\n00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.092\nAnd then we have our process owner.\n\n507\n00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:24.432\nAnd our process owner, well,\nthey take responsibility for\n\n508\n00:29:24.432 --> 00:29:29.100\nknowledge management and they take\nresponsibility for those relationships.\n\n509\n00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.655\nWorking with all of\nthe other process owners and\n\n510\n00:29:34.655 --> 00:29:40.255\nprocess managers to ensure that all of\nthe other process data is captured.\n\n511\n00:29:40.255 --> 00:29:42.005\nAnd then of course we have practitioners.\n\n512\n00:29:42.005 --> 00:29:46.166\nAnd practitioners are the people that you\nmight consider them to be librarians, for\n\n513\n00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:47.697\ninstance, data librarians.\n\n514\n00:29:47.697 --> 00:29:53.280\nThey're the people that\nactually you know will impose.\n\n515\n00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.473\nI don’t like the word impose, but they\nwill, I don’t even like the word enforce.\n\n516\n00:29:56.473 --> 00:29:59.533\n[LAUGH] But they're the people that\nwill carry out our policies, and\n\n517\n00:29:59.533 --> 00:30:02.875\nmake sure that everybody else is\ncarrying out their retention policies.\n\n518\n00:30:02.875 --> 00:30:05.940\nAnd they're carrying out their\nupdate policies as well.\n\n519\n00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.070\nAnd of course, we've got authors.\n\n520\n00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.326\nKnowledge authors, or\ncreators if you want, and\n\n521\n00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:11.757\nthese are the people that\nactually write documents.\n\n522\n00:30:11.757 --> 00:30:14.322\nWe all have heard of the role\nof technical author, and\n\n523\n00:30:14.322 --> 00:30:16.380\nthat's what a technical author is.\n\n524\n00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.829\nIt's somebody who actually\ncreates knowledge.\n\n525\n00:30:19.829 --> 00:30:22.696\nSo, now we've reached the end\nof knowledge management.\n\n526\n00:30:22.696 --> 00:30:30.540\nAnd in fact, this was actually our last\nepisode in service transition processes.\n\n527\n00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.380\nAnd now in our future episodes, we're\ngoing to look a little bit more in-depth\n\n528\n00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.890\nat sort of technology considerations and\n\n529\n00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:43.165\ncritical success factors and also, sort of\nrelationships with service transitions.\n\n530\n00:30:43.165 --> 00:30:46.950\nSo at this particular minute in time,\nI would like you to go away and\n\n531\n00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:50.680\njust review your downloadable notes for\nknowledge management.\n\n532\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.450\nAnd if you do have any questions or\n\n533\n00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.290\nany concerns at all, then please feel free\nto come back to us via the forum, and\n\n534\n00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.335\nwe will try our best to\nhelp you as best as we can.\n\n535\n00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:02.810\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Jo, it's been a great

ensure\n\n36\n00:01:57.904 --> 00:02:02.824\nthat you have downloaded the sample\npapers that were given to you as part\n\n37\n00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:04.638\nof the course materials.\n\n38\n00:02:04.638 --> 00:02:08.972\nNow if you didn't receive them as\npart of the course materials or\n\n39\n00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:13.065\nyou feel that you might want to\ncheck out the AXELOS website,\n\n40\n00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:16.932\nwhich obviously AXELOS\nare the people that own ITIL now.\n\n41\n00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:23.825\nThen please feel free to go to\ntheir website at www.axelos.org.\n\n42\n00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:27.985\nAnd if you type in the search\nthe ITIL Intermediate, and\n\n43\n00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:31.719\nyou can download a sample\npaper from that website.\n\n44\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.260\nSo what we're going to do over the next\n\n45\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.790\nfew moments is I'm going to take you\nthrough some exam technique, and\n\n46\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.700\nthen I'm going to ask you to go away and\nattempt sample paper one.\n\n47\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.490\nOnce you've completed sample paper one,\nthen I'm gonna go over it with you, I'm\n\n48\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.760\ngoing to make sure that you have picked\nout all of the salient points and all of\n\n49\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.880\nthe relevant points and everything that\nyou need in order to get the right answer.\n\n50\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.250\nYeah, talking about the right answer,\ntake a look at this slide, okay?\n\n51\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.820\nThere is no right answer,\nthere is no wrong answer.\n\n52\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.069\nWhat you've got is a best fit answer.\n\n53\n00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.866\nNow I know that way, way back at\nthe introduction to our class I very,\n\n54\n00:03:13.866 --> 00:03:17.980\nvery briefly mentioned\nthe exam at the end of these.\n\n55\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.330\nAnd I said to you that it was complex\nmultiple choice exam and they\n\n56\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.370\nlooked at, I think the word we used in the\nvery start of the class was most correct.\n\n57\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.260\nAnd I used the word best fit and\nthat's what I like to use, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.880\nThe best fit answer is five points.\n\n59\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.212\nYour second best answer is three and your\nthird best answer will give you one point,\n\n60\n00:03:40.212 --> 00:03:43.422\nand we've got this\ndistractor that I mentioned.\n\n61\n00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:45.960\nAnd, boy, is that there to distract.\n\n62\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.400\nThe distractor will quite often\nuse some nice pretty words.\n\n63\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.820\nThe words that you find in your\nideal publications and, you say,\n\n64\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.355\nyou know that sounds great.\n\n65\n00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:59.040\nCuz it mentioned all these processes and\nit's mentioned all these functions and\n\n66\n00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.370\nit's methodologies activities,\nthat's gotta be the right answer, right?\n\n67\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.800\nNo, because the right answer,\nthe best fit answer has got to be\n\n68\n00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.120\ncompletely relevant to\nthe scenario completely relevant.\n\n69\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.777\nSo sometimes the best fit answer doesn't\nactually use any of the ITL wording\n\n70\n00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:18.295\nat all.\n\n71\n00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:23.573\nSo be careful, our distractor is\ncalled a distractor for a reason.\n\n72\n00:04:23.573 --> 00:04:26.206\nFor the exam let me tell you\na little bit about it then.\n\n73\n00:04:26.206 --> 00:04:30.391\nYou get 90 minutes, that's an hour and\na half to complete this exam.\n\n74\n00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:34.320\nAnd you will be given eight\nmultiple choice questions.\n\n75\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.808\nSo you get two booklets.\n\n76\n00:04:36.808 --> 00:04:42.431\nYou get a scenario booklet and\nyou get a question booklet.\n\n77\n00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:45.431\nNow be very, very careful.\n\n78\n00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:48.504\nThe scenario booklet that as\nit says sets the scene and\n\n79\n00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:50.904\nthe question booklet asks the question.\n\n80\n00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:54.316\nOkay, fairy straight forward not really.\n\n81\n00:04:54.316 --> 00:04:59.030\nFirst thing that I want you to check\nwhen you see your question booklet is\n\n82\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.633\nthat the top of every single question.\n\n83\n00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:04.706\nAnd boy is this important,\ndon't forget this.\n\n84\n00:05:04.706 --> 00:05:11.035\nAt the top of every single question\nit says refer to scenario X.\n\n85\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.360\nSometimes, not all the time,\nnot in every paper, and\n\n86\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.480\nin fact it's a rarity I'll admit.\n\n87\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.562\nBut sometimes you've got one scenario for\ntwo questions.\n\n88\n00:05:22.562 --> 00:05:26.670\nIn other words, two questions\nrefer to just that one scenario.\n\n89\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.290\nBest way to ascertain\nwhether that's the case,\n\n90\n00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.370\nin your particular exam, is scroll through\nto the end of the scenario booklet.\n\n91\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.200\nLook at the end of the scenario booklet,\nsee how many you've got.\n\n92\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.740\nIf you're running off seven,\nthen that means that somewhere\n\n93\n00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.800\nin your question booklet,\nyou've got two questions for one scenario.\n\n94\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.760\nThis is not the norm.\n\n95\n00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.660\nIt's not in every single paper, but it's\none definitely watching out for, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.050\nSo always look for them,\nright at the very, very top take a look,\n\n97\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.886\nsee what scenario it refers to okay.\n\n98\n00:06:00.886 --> 00:06:05.833\nYou've gotta get a total of 28\npoints out of 40 in order to\n\n99\n00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:10.106\npass the ITIL intermediate,\nthe life cycle phase.\n\n100\n00:06:10.106 --> 00:06:12.769\nSo think about this.\n\n101\n00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:14.470\nYou can't get all threes.\n\n102\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.020\nThat's not going to work.\n\n103\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.860\nYou have to get some five pointers.\n\n104\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.450\nObviously, what I'd like you to do is to\nget all five pointers, and 40 out of 40,\n\n105\n00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.750\nby the way, is not impossible.\n\n106\n00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.256\nIt really, really isn't impossible.\n\n107\n00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:34.930\nAnd I have quite a few delegates\nwho do actually achieve that okay.\n\n108\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.160\nSo, what am I gonna ask you to do\nthen when it comes to this test?\n\n109\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.320\nWell I've got an acronym for you and it's\nnot one, I guess I'm supposed to give you.\n\n110\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.964\nBut I'm gonna give you anyway.\n\n111\n00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:53.150\nRTFQ, Ronnie do you have\nany idea what that means?\n\n112\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.721\n&gt;&gt; No I don't.\n\n113\n00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:55.126\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n114\n00:06:55.126 --> 00:06:56.241\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm pleased.\n\n115\n00:06:56.241 --> 00:07:01.424\n[LAUGH] It means read the full question.\n\n116\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.117\n&gt;&gt; Read the full question.\n\n117\n00:07:05.117 --> 00:07:09.429\nReally, really,\nreally important there is not one\n\n118\n00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.062\nword in that question\nthat is not relevant.\n\n119\n00:07:13.062 --> 00:07:16.940\nEvery single word is completely relevant.\n\n120\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.166\nIf you try and skim read, bear it in\nmind that this test is not already okay,\n\n121\n00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:25.698\nyou're not gonna get any points for\nfinishing in 20 minutes.\n\n122\n00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:30.954\nYou're not gonna get any prizes for that,\nand nobody's gonna recognize you for\n\n123\n00:07:30.954 --> 00:07:34.442\nbeing the fastest person\never to finish an ITIL test.\n\n124\n00:07:34.442 --> 00:07:36.581\nSo, please don't try it okay,\n\n125\n00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:40.713\nit's not gonna get you anything\nadditional over your score.\n\n126\n00:07:40.713 --> 00:07:44.274\nRead the full question take\nthe time to read the full question.\n\n127\n00:07:44.274 --> 00:07:50.366\nRead every single word, and that applies\nto the scenario as well read the scenario.\n\n128\n00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:52.138\nYou're looking for keywords.\n\n129\n00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.890\nBut you're also looking for\nsmall words as well.\n\n130\n00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.289\nWords like all and words like might and\ncould, and should, and must.\n\n131\n00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.320\nPlease, please, please,\npick out those words,\n\n132\n00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.060\ncuz they are incredibly important okay.\n\n133\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.980\nFirst thing that I want you\nto do is read the question.\n\n134\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.950\nThe question can generally be very, very\nsmall, and sometimes that question can\n\n135\n00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.920\nsimply turn around and say, so, given the\nscenario, what do you think is the best\n\n136\n00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.840\nanswer to resolve the issues\nmentioned in the scenario?\n\n137\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.991\nWell that question tell\nyou absolutely nothing.\n\n138\n00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:29.169\nSo, you have to go then back the scenario,\nokay?\n\n139\n00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:33.820\nAnd the example you've given on there\nis you've been asked by the CIO to\n\n140\n00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.450\nidentify the next steps to\naddress the identified issue.\n\n141\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.029\nWell, guess what?\n\n142\n00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:43.842\nIf you've been asked for the next steps,\nand this why I say read the full question,\n\n143\n00:08:43.842 --> 00:08:46.948\ncuz if you've been asked for\nthe next steps, don't you dare select\n\n144\n00:08:46.948 --> 00:08:50.850\nthe answer that goes over everything\nthat you've already covered.\n\n145\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.249\nCuz they're asking you for the next steps.\n\n146\n00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:57.202\nAnd also I mentioned and it's been\nhighlighted there again about addressing\n\n147\n00:08:57.202 --> 00:09:00.181\nthe issues mentioned either in question or\nthe scenario,\n\n148\n00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:03.440\nif your answer doesn't address\nthe issues i.e, relevance.\n\n149\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.910\nIf it's not relevant, then again you're\nnot gonna be on to that five point answer.\n\n150\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.161\nSo read the full question.\n\n151\n00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:15.399\nBe very, very careful, okay?\n\n152\n00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:18.950\nIt says there, as you read\nthe scenario highlight, underline, or\n\n153\n00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.710\nwrite down the specific issues.\n\n154\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.716\nWell, you can only do that if you've\ngot a paper exam in front of you.\n\n155\n00:09:24.716 --> 00:09:29.320\nYou cannot do that When you are online and\ndoing a virtual test.\n\n156\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.430\nYou will be allowed in your virtual test\nto have a piece of blank paper with you.\n\n157\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.917\nWhat I would recommend, and\nI was just thinking if I had one here,\n\n158\n00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:42.751\nand I don't unfortunately.\n\n159\n00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:44.599\nWhat I would recommend for\n\n160\n00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:50.770\nyou is to actually take one piece of\nblack paper and fold it into quarters.\n\n161\n00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.780\nBy doing that you've divided up\nthe front page into four sections and\n\n162\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.590\nthe back page into four sections too.\n\n163\n00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.128\nYou'll be allowed to have that piece\nof paper and a pencil with you.\n\n164\n00:10:02.128 --> 00:10:06.598\nIn every single quarter,\nI would write down the notes for\n\n165\n00:10:06.598 --> 00:10:09.610\neach particular question, okay?\n\n166\n00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.217\nWhat that allows you to do is actually\nkeep your questions separate,\n\n167\n00:10:13.217 --> 00:10:14.404\nwhich is a huge start.\n\n168\n00:10:14.404 --> 00:10:17.478\nIf you just start writing down\nrandom words on a piece of paper,\n\n169\n00:10:17.478 --> 00:10:20.210\nyou'll not really know what\nquestion it refers to.\n\n170\n00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.730\nAnd if you have to go back to a question,\nthen you'll really be in trouble, okay?\n\n171\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.743\nSo take that piece of paper and\nliterally just fold it into four.\n\n172\n00:10:28.743 --> 00:10:32.970\nAnd as you unfold it, you've now\ngot dividers, four on each side.\n\n173\n00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.886\nAnd use one quarter for each question and\n\n174\n00:10:35.886 --> 00:10:40.104\nthen write down the specific\nwords you want to highlight.\n\n175\n00:10:40.104 --> 00:10:43.122\nSo the third bullet point up there\ntalks about sticking to the facts.\n\n176\n00:10:43.122 --> 00:10:48.440\nAnd what I will say to you is\ndon't assume please don't assume.\n\n177\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.132\nStick to what's in front of you.\n\n178\n00:10:50.132 --> 00:10:51.556\nRead the full question.\n\n179\n00:10:51.556 --> 00:10:54.200\nAnd don't read in between the lines.\n\n180\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.885\nThere is nothing written there.\n\n181\n00:10:55.885 --> 00:11:00.459\nSo don't read in between\nthe lines don't assume anything,\n\n182\n00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:05.586\nif it's not down in black and\nwhite then it simply doesn't exists.\n\n183\n00:11:05.586 --> 00:11:08.167\nNow you've completed your class.\n\n184\n00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:13.690\nNow's the time when you follow this\nlink and you download your exam voucher.\n\n185\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.082\nWhat will happen is you'll\nbe given this voucher and\n\n186\n00:11:18.082 --> 00:11:20.869\nyou will also be given\nan instructions booklet.\n\n187\n00:11:20.869 --> 00:11:23.329\nOr an instructional email rather, and\n\n188\n00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:27.055\nyou will be asked to go to\nthe website at peoplecert.org and\n\n189\n00:11:27.055 --> 00:11:31.690\nyou'll be asked to register as a client\nif you haven't already done so.\n\n190\n00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:36.700\nYou may already have a candidate login,\nand then you select the option to\n\n191\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:43.000\nregister for\nan exam using an exam voucher.\n\n192\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.930\nLet me repeat that again, okay.\n\n193\n00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:51.823\nYou'll be asked to register for an exam\nusing an examination voucher, okay.\n\n194\n00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:56.656\nAnd then the voucher number that you've\nbeen given in your email from Passion IT,\n\n195\n00:11:56.656 --> 00:12:00.020\nis the voucher number that you will use.\n\n196\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.005\nOnce you've imput that it's going to\nask you for an appropriate date and\n\n197\n00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:05.255\ntime to sit your test.\n\n198\n00:12:05.255 --> 00:12:10.896\nYou can do whatever time you like, so\npick something that's appropriate for\n\n199\n00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.866\nyou, something that you can work with.\n\n200\n00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:19.061\nThere're a few things that I wanna tell\nyou about this online exam as well okay.\n\n201\n00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:22.599\nAnd the first thing is,\nplease make sure you can't be interrupted.\n\n202\n00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:25.893\nYou need to be in a room\nwhere it's only you and\n\n203\n00:12:25.893 --> 00:12:28.680\npreferably where the door is closed.\n\n204\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.790\nYou will need to be using a laptop or\na tablet with a camera.\n\n205\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.450\nIf your laptop or your tablet or\n\n206\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.860\nyour desktop does not have a camera\nthen you won't be able to sit your test.\n\n207\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.098\nBecause you will be watched by\na prompter throughout your entire test.\n\n208\n00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:48.820\nYou can't use more than one screen.\n\n209\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.773\nYou can only use one screen, okay.\n\n210\n00:12:51.773 --> 00:12:56.957\nAnd you cannot at any point in time have\nany other devices on your desk either.\n\n211\n00:12:56.957 --> 00:13:01.386\nSo nothing that can connect\nto the internet, okay.\n\n212\n00:13:01.386 --> 00:13:05.167\nYou will be asked when you register for\nyour test, for\n\n213\n00:13:05.167 --> 00:13:11.430\nabout an hour before your test is due,\nto download some exam guard software okay.\n\n214\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.100\nAnd what that does is that allows\nthe proctor to remotely watch what\n\n215\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.530\nyou are doing on your laptop or\non your PC or on your device,\n\n216\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.280\nand make sure that you're not on\nthe Internet googling the answer okay?\n\n217\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.130\nSo we started our exam.\n\n218\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.183\nWe've downloaded all the software.\n\n219\n00:13:27.183 --> 00:13:30.880\nAnd by the way when I mentioned that if\nyou're using a work PC you'd better make\n\n220\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.770\nsure you have the permissions in order\nto be able to download that software.\n\n221\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.059\nIf the software's not on your PC then\nyou won't be able to sit the test okay?\n\n222\n00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:43.513\nSo then the proctor will come online and\nthey will ask you if you're all ready and\n\n223\n00:13:43.513 --> 00:13:46.923\nthey'll tell you that you can\nhave a piece of paper and a pen.\n\n224\n00:13:46.923 --> 00:13:49.960\nAnd then they will ask\nto see around your room.\n\n225\n00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.523\nSo you must be in a position where you\ncan physically pick up your laptop and\n\n226\n00:13:55.523 --> 00:13:59.487\nturn it around so\nthat the proctor can view the room.\n\n227\n00:13:59.487 --> 00:14:02.980\nThat's to make sure that you don't\nhave any ITIL books with you.\n\n228\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.929\nThat you don't have anybody\nlike me hiding in a corner or\n\n229\n00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:08.082\nhiding under your desk helping you out.\n\n230\n00:14:08.082 --> 00:14:11.930\nAnd it's also to make sure that\nyou are completely alone, and\n\n231\n00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.260\ncan't be interrupted during\nthat particular test.\n\n232\n00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:22.160\nAt that point in time, the examiner\nwill ask you to start your test.\n\n233\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.775\nYou'll get 90 minutes and to be perfectly\nhonest 90 minutes or an hour and\n\n234\n00:14:26.775 --> 00:14:28.629\na half is pretty comfortable.\n\n235\n00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:31.288\nAt the end of your test.\n\n236\n00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:34.160\nOne thing I will tell you,\nplease don't change your answers.\n\n237\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.780\nGo with your gut instinct\nit's generally right.\n\n238\n00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.160\nAnd to be perfectly honest\nabout in 75% of cases,\n\n239\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.930\nthe person that changes their answers\nchanges it to the wrong one okay.\n\n240\n00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.390\nYou wanna aim about ten\nminutes per question.\n\n241\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.628\nThe average is 11 minutes per question but\naim for 10 and\n\n242\n00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:53.009\nthen you'll feel completely\ncomfortable with the timings.\n\n243\n00:14:53.009 --> 00:14:57.460\nAt the end of your test you\nwill be asked to submit.\n\n244\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.890\nAnd when you've finished\nthen you click Submit.\n\n245\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.790\nAt that point in time your\nscreen will disappear.\n\n246\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.086\nYou will be given an intermediate.\n\n247\n00:15:09.086 --> 00:15:11.683\nI don't like to use that word actually\nwhen we're talking about ITIL\n\n248\n00:15:11.683 --> 00:15:12.510\nintermediates.\n\n249\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.010\nYou'll be given an interim result there\nand that interim result will tell you.\n\n250\n00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.884\nVery simply whether you've passed or\nfailed.\n\n251\n00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:21.740\nYou're not gonna be able to get\nanything more than out of it, okay?\n\n252\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.210\nThat's all you're going to get,\nit's just the pass or fail.\n\n253\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.566\nBecause it has to be independently ordered\nbefore they can release the result to\n\n254\n00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:29.286\nyou, okay?\n\n255\n00:15:29.286 --> 00:15:32.180\nSo you'll get your interim\nresult immediately.\n\n256\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.300\nAnd then you'll get your real result\nwith your score within a week, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:38.492 --> 00:15:41.450\nI wanna just draw your attention\nto that bottom bullet point there\n\n258\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.620\njust before we move on.\n\n259\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.105\nIf you're struggling with a question,\nmove on come back to it.\n\n260\n00:15:46.105 --> 00:15:50.460\nAnd just remember that if you don't answer\na question because you think it's too\n\n261\n00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.162\ndifficult then you're\ngoing to get zero points.\n\n262\n00:15:53.162 --> 00:15:56.749\nYou've got a 25% chance of\ngetting a 5 pointer, and\n\n263\n00:15:56.749 --> 00:16:01.880\nyou've a 50% chance of either getting 5 or\n3, so please answer it, okay?\n\n264\n00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.860\nDon't just leave it blank,\nalways answer a question.\n\n265\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.864\nRight, I think I've probably\ngiven you enough exam tips for\n\n266\n00:16:10.864 --> 00:16:13.073\nnow, now is your turn okay.\n\n267\n00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:17.849\nWhat I want you to do now is I want\nyou to go and I want you to download\n\n268\n00:16:17.849 --> 00:16:22.981\nsample paper one, and then I want\nyou to do sample paper one including\n\n269\n00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:28.499\nthe scenario booklet and the question\nbooklet, I want you to do that now.\n\n270\n00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:32.620\nAnd then we're gonna come back and we're\ngonna go through that question booklet.\n\n271\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.790\nNow you'll notice that with this\nparticular booklet with sample paper one,\n\n272\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.650\nyou've got answers and\nyou've got rationale.\n\n273\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.190\nIn other words, that's the reason why,\n\n274\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.330\nthat's the five pointer, the reason why\nthis one is the three pointer okay.\n\n275\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:51.110\nBut, for the moment, what I want us to do,\nis I want us to come back.\n\n276\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.780\nWhen you finish that exam\nI want us to come back and\n\n277\n00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.600\nI want us to go through that test.\n\n278\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.790\nAnd then you'll see how you did.\n\n279\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.628\nAnd don't forget,\nwe've got the forum available to us and\n\n280\n00:17:03.628 --> 00:17:07.112\nnow more than anything else is when\nyou really wanna be using that forum.\n\n281\n00:17:07.112 --> 00:17:10.998\nJust to answer questions,\netc as we run through that test.\n\n282\n00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:16.240\nSo, good luck have fun\nwith your sample paper.\n\n283\n00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.431\nRemember, read the full question.\n\n284\n00:17:18.431 --> 00:17:22.090\nRead the full scenario, every word counts.\n\n285\n00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.091\nCheck for relevance, and\ndon't make assumptions.\n\n286\n00:17:25.091 --> 00:17:26.604\nAnd I'll see you when\nyou finish your test.\n\n287\n00:17:28.653 --> 00:17:30.887\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, well thank you again for\n\n288\n00:17:30.887 --> 00:17:33.680\nhelping us out in those\ndifferent exam tips.\n\n289\n00:17:33.680

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:09.371\nHi, I am Jo Peacock with ITPro.TV and I'm\nglad that you have made it this far and\n\n2\n00:00:09.371 --> 00:00:16.210\nwe're now in part two of our exam review\nfor our ITIL service transition paper.\n\n3\n00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.920\nAnd so in part one, we looked over\nquestions one through four, and\n\n4\n00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.260\nnow we're going to look over\nquestions five to eight.\n\n5\n00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.940\nSo, let's jump straight into this then and\nlet's take a look, straightaway,\n\n6\n00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.930\nat question five.\n\n7\n00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.550\nSo don't forget, here we are,\nwe're in service transition.\n\n8\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.960\nAnd as the transition manager,\nyou're in charge of service transition.\n\n9\n00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.760\nSo which of the following sets\nof activities is the best\n\n10\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.260\nchoice to present to the business?\n\n11\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.530\nWell, let's see what the business\nhave as a challenge then, shall we?\n\n12\n00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.250\nRight, they've been using ITIL for\ntwo years.\n\n13\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.300\nIt's a global company.\n\n14\n00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.720\nThat's always worth considering,\nthe scale of the organization.\n\n15\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.180\nAnd the focus has been\non incident management.\n\n16\n00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.150\nThe organization would like to,\nand in fact actually I think that,\n\n17\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.160\nthat is a little bit incomplete.\n\n18\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.980\nActually, the materials that you have, it\nsays that their focus has been on incident\n\n19\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.900\nmanagement, problem management,\nas well as the service desk.\n\n20\n00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.630\nThat little bit might have got lost.\n\n21\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.140\nSo we're looking very basically\nat service operation here.\n\n22\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.640\nThey want to move to a service\nlife cycle approach.\n\n23\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.290\nSo they wanna move just\nout of service operation.\n\n24\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.720\nAnd they want to, in bringing, embrace\nthe rest of the actual service life cycle.\n\n25\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.935\nThey want to start with\nservice transition.\n\n26\n00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:35.524\nAnd the key to success is ensuring\nthat the transition can support\n\n27\n00:01:35.524 --> 00:01:40.480\nthe organization's aggressive\nmove to cloud-based services.\n\n28\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.399\nOkay, aggressive,\nthat means very, very quickly.\n\n29\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.500\nAggressive in terms of,\ncertainly in terms of English.\n\n30\n00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.060\nThe way we use UK English.\n\n31\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.448\nAggressive would mean very, very quickly.\n\n32\n00:01:52.448 --> 00:01:55.117\nWe really want to get into this, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:59.745\nService transition has got to focus on\ndelivering what the business requires as\n\n34\n00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:03.730\na priority within the financial and\nresource constraints.\n\n35\n00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.700\nAnd you are the newly designated\nservice transition manager.\n\n36\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.240\nLucky you, right?\n\n37\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.770\nYou've once worked in one of\nthe company's largest business units.\n\n38\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.820\nSo you understand the organization and\n\n39\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.560\nyou understand the competitive\nnature of the industry itself.\n\n40\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.100\nAnd you understand the need to rapidly\ndeploy new and innovative services.\n\n41\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.907\nBut you know also that IT doesn't always\nrespond as quickly as it's needed and so\n\n42\n00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:31.736\nsome business units have bypassed the IT.\n\n43\n00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:33.590\nI've heard that before too.\n\n44\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.080\nI'm gonna go and do this on my\nown because you can't help me.\n\n45\n00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.570\nAnd they've deployed cloud-based services\nfrom elsewhere, externally hosted.\n\n46\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.740\nAnd those business units are now\nstruggling to support a managery services.\n\n47\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.710\nSo they wanna work with IT to bring\nsome of the services back in house\n\n48\n00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.820\nto integrate with other services, and\n\n49\n00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.390\nto eliminate some obsolete services\nthat have failed to deliver value.\n\n50\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.590\nYou want to show an ongoing\ncommitment to service transition.\n\n51\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.160\nBut you need to convince business and\n\n52\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.780\nIT that transition can\naddress these challenges.\n\n53\n00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.850\nSo let's go back to the question.\n\n54\n00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.760\nWhich one of the following sets of\ntransition activities is the best\n\n55\n00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.800\nchoice for you to present to the business?\n\n56\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.090\nWell, what are the options\nthat we have here?\n\n57\n00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.080\nWell, let's look at D.\n\n58\n00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.860\nD is our five pointer.\n\n59\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.290\nAnd let's look at this particular answer.\n\n60\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.490\nProduced planning templates and\na structured approach, we like that.\n\n61\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.770\nStructure means consistency.\n\n62\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.760\nEnabling IT to deliver what the business\nconsiders a priority within financial and\n\n63\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.330\nother resource constraints.\n\n64\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.490\nSo your implementing service\ntransition within the constraints of\n\n65\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.440\nthe organization, excellent.\n\n66\n00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.240\nWe've always got to think\nabout those constraints.\n\n67\n00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.260\nEnsure the tools, and the activities,\nand the authorities, and\n\n68\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.430\nthe roles of responsibilities are designed\nto work seamlessly across physical and\n\n69\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.400\nvirtual environments.\n\n70\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.490\nSo we've got recognition that we are\nmoving to cloud-based services, excellent.\n\n71\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.681\nAnd show that our transition plans are\naligned with the business and with IT and\n\n72\n00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.428\nservice management strategies and\nplans, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:16.024\nAgain, we're addressing everything\nthat's mentioned in the scenario.\n\n74\n00:04:16.024 --> 00:04:21.062\nAnd ensure that the service asset and\nconfiguration management process, and\n\n75\n00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:26.940\nconfiguration information can support the\ndynamic nature of a cloud architecture.\n\n76\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.850\nNow, when we go back to service asset and\nconfiguration management,\n\n77\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.940\nI mentioned to you, when we looked at that\nparticular process that even where you\n\n78\n00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.870\noutsource your IT services,\nwe still need to have that information\n\n79\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.060\ncontained within our\nconfiguration management system.\n\n80\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.740\nBecause we have to know what\nwe've actually outsourced and\n\n81\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.910\nhow they're managing that.\n\n82\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.610\nWe have to know what we're paying for,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.440\nOkay, so that looks like a great answer.\n\n84\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.857\nSo let's now look at our three-pointer.\n\n85\n00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:58.850\nAnd our three-pointer is actually C.\n\n86\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.610\nSo let's take a look at C.\n\n87\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.062\nEnsure the customer and stakeholder\norganizations have a clear understanding\n\n88\n00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:08.393\nof the service transition practice and\nits capabilities.\n\n89\n00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.510\nWhy do they need to know?\n\n90\n00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.760\nWhy do our customers and\nour stakeholders need to know?\n\n91\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.490\nSure, our IT department need to\nknow we're implementing this.\n\n92\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.822\nBut we want to actually ensure that\ntransition will meet the needs of\n\n93\n00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:27.118\nthe organization.\n\n94\n00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:31.480\nThey don't necessarily need a clear\nunderstanding of the practice.\n\n95\n00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.660\nWhat they need to know is what\nthe benefits are for service transition.\n\n96\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.830\nCreating CI types.\n\n97\n00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.004\nThen release models,\nand change models, and\n\n98\n00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:45.630\nstandard changes that\nsupport a cloud architecture.\n\n99\n00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.159\nAnd that's great,\nwe're talking about standard policies,\n\n100\n00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.387\nstandard definitions, etc.\n\n101\n00:05:52.387 --> 00:05:57.239\nAnd I'm all for that, the only problem\nthat I have with that is the fact that\n\n102\n00:05:57.239 --> 00:06:00.200\nit just looks at the cloud architecture.\n\n103\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.010\nAnd we don't just want to look\nat the cloud architecture,\n\n104\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.148\nwe want to look at everything.\n\n105\n00:06:04.148 --> 00:06:09.843\nAnd ensure the transition processes\nare robust enough to function effectively\n\n106\n00:06:09.843 --> 00:06:15.205\nin the highly automated environment\nthat a cloud architecture requires.\n\n107\n00:06:15.205 --> 00:06:18.581\nAgain, we've got that emphasis\non the cloud architecture.\n\n108\n00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:22.156\nAnd the thing that I'm really worried\nabout there is that it says it's highly\n\n109\n00:06:22.156 --> 00:06:22.770\nautomated.\n\n110\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.610\nAnd that's kind of an assumption.\n\n111\n00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.820\nBut again, we're too restrictive,\nwe're just looking at the cloud.\n\n112\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.260\nAnd what about the last one then?\n\n113\n00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.400\nEnsure the effective use of resources.\n\n114\n00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.725\nIf I wanna see the word effective,\nI want to see the word efficient as well.\n\n115\n00:06:37.725 --> 00:06:41.520\nBy managing changes to existing services,\nincluding the transfer and\n\n116\n00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.390\nretirement of services.\n\n117\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.430\nOkay, that in itself,\nI don't have a problem with at all.\n\n118\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.190\nIt kind of goes back to this scenario.\n\n119\n00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.330\nIt does relate back to the scenario,\nand I don't have a problem with it.\n\n120\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.210\nBut the rest of the answer\nis not really holistic.\n\n121\n00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.980\nIt doesn't answer everything\nin this scenario,\n\n122\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.390\nwhich is why it's not the complete answer.\n\n123\n00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.850\nIt's not the most well-rounded answer.\n\n124\n00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.740\nSo let's take a look at our one pointer\nthen, and our one pointer is B.\n\n125\n00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.940\nAnd B looks at ensuring the percentage of\nthe service life cycle budget allocated\n\n126\n00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.338\nto transition activities is appropriate,\ngiven the financial constraints.\n\n127\n00:07:17.338 --> 00:07:23.005\nJust making sure that somebody\nhas the right budget allocated\n\n128\n00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:26.645\ndoes not mean that they're going to be\nable to manage that budget appropriately.\n\n129\n00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:29.995\nSo there's kind of an assumption in there\n\n130\n00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:32.125\nthat we're going to be able\nto manage that budget too.\n\n131\n00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:33.864\nOkay, what about the next one?\n\n132\n00:07:33.864 --> 00:07:40.665\nEnsuring strategic and tactical projects,\nadopt service transition practices.\n\n133\n00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:42.650\nHave we compiled any?\n\n134\n00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.490\nI didn't see any.\n\n135\n00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.221\nWe didn't compile any in\nthe first bullet point in B, so\n\n136\n00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:50.186\nwhile there's an assumption there that\nwe just suddenly compiled some, okay.\n\n137\n00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:54.091\nConsider the impact of cloud computing\non the design implementation and\n\n138\n00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:56.020\noperation of service transition.\n\n139\n00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.701\nAll right,\nI'm okay with that bullet point.\n\n140\n00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:03.208\nBut again, I mean,\nwe've got no specifics in there and\n\n141\n00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:07.550\nit just says, consider the impact\nof cloud computing on the design.\n\n142\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:13.060\nYeah, I mean, that's what we need to\ndo but I'm looking more for specifics.\n\n143\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.197\nAnd I haven't seen anything\nthat talks about templates and\n\n144\n00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:17.770\ntalks about strategies etc.\n\n145\n00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:25.400\nThe last one establishing a quality rating\nsystem that ensures service transition and\n\n146\n00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.370\nrelease plans are complete based\non templates what templates\n\n147\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.800\nunderlined with IT strategies\nwhat IT strategies?\n\n148\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.170\nWe have iTil implemented in\nterms of service operations.\n\n149\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:41.050\nSo where are these IT\nstrategies coming from?\n\n150\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.490\nAnd also, what about these templates?\n\n151\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.710\nWe haven't actually\nproduced any templates.\n\n152\n00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.680\nWe haven't compiled any templates.\n\n153\n00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.490\nAnd now, we're basing these on\ntemplates that we haven't yet compiled.\n\n154\n00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.480\nSlightly worrying, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.840\nWe need to start at the beginning and\n\n156\n00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.760\nwe haven't started at\nthe beginning in B at all.\n\n157\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.920\nWe really, really haven't.\n\n158\n00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.930\nWhat about being aligned to\nthe needs of the organization?\n\n159\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.420\nWe're aligned to IT strategy there but\nnot to the needs of the organization.\n\n160\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:14.260\nAnd all we want to do is to\ndeliver value to our organization.\n\n161\n00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.711\nAnd that's what ITIL and IT is about.\n\n162\n00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:20.390\nLet's take a look at A,\nA is our distractor.\n\n163\n00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.320\nDocumenting end to end supply chains and\nensure contracts are in\n\n164\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.630\nplace with supplies of externally\nhosted cloud based services.\n\n165\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.450\nOkay, contracts, that's service design.\n\n166\n00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.390\nThat's supplier management.\n\n167\n00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.731\nThat's not service transition.\n\n168\n00:09:39.731 --> 00:09:44.576\nWhilst I don't have a problem with this\nultimately it's still not part of service\n\n169\n00:09:44.576 --> 00:09:46.621\ntransition be careful with that.\n\n170\n00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:50.617\nReduce the percentage of incidences that\nare caused by changes to cloud based\n\n171\n00:09:50.617 --> 00:09:51.820\nservices.\n\n172\n00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.600\nI'm not too sure that we've had any\nincidence It's mentioned that we're\n\n173\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.360\nstruggling to support but it doesn't say\nthat we've had a huge number of incidence.\n\n174\n00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.870\nJust that we're struggling to support it.\n\n175\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.719\nSo that's not even\nmentioned in the scenario.\n\n176\n00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:12.255\nIncreasing the number of csi initiatives\nimplemented within service transition.\n\n177\n00:10:12.255 --> 00:10:13.835\nIf we haven't got service transition,\n\n178\n00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:17.165\nthen we need to implement that as\nthe first csi initiative surely.\n\n179\n00:10:17.165 --> 00:10:22.372\nSo, increase the number of csi\ninitiatives, we don't have csi.\n\n180\n00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:25.752\nAutomated activities where possible,\nI'm all for\n\n181\n00:10:25.752 --> 00:10:30.974\nautomation where appropriate, but I\nalways will tell you that especially, and\n\n182\n00:10:30.974 --> 00:10:35.996\nwe mentioned this earlier in our episodes,\nthat if you automate something.\n\n183\n00:10:35.996 --> 00:10:39.874\nIf you don't have the correct\nprocess defined in the first place,\n\n184\n00:10:39.874 --> 00:10:44.720\nthen all you're going to do is you're\ngoing to automate a bad process.\n\n185\n00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.470\nSo you can't automate unless\nyou define your process first.\n\n186\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.030\nSo we've gotta define our process\nfirst before we can automate anything.\n\n187\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:56.984\nWe're not going to achieve value\nfrom automation if we don't have\n\n188\n00:10:56.984 --> 00:11:00.173\nthe right processes in place to automate.\n\n189\n00:11:00.173 --> 00:11:03.416\nAnd that's why A is your distractor.\n\n190\n00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:07.480\nOkay so your five pointer\nthere is most definitely D.\n\n191\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.890\nThat is the best fit answer\nin this particular answer.\n\n192\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.758\nSo let's take a look,\nthen, at question number 6.\n\n193\n00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:16.960\nAnd what are we looking at here?\n\n194\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.180\nThe best initial scope approach for\nservice asset and\n\n195\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.240\nconfiguration management to meet\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n196\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.450\nSo they've got mature service desk,\n\n197\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.130\nrequest fulfillment, incident problem,\nand change management.\n\n198\n00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.277\nThe current focus of change management\nis on service assets that are business\n\n199\n00:11:35.277 --> 00:11:37.849\ncritical, all subject\nto regulated control.\n\n200\n00:11:37.849 --> 00:11:40.823\nAnd the organization wants\nto implement sakum but\n\n201\n00:11:40.823 --> 00:11:44.857\nthere is a disagreement about how\nto maintain or how to structure and\n\n202\n00:11:44.857 --> 00:11:49.220\nmaintain the CI information and\nconfiguration management system.\n\n203\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.544\nSo, remember we need to first of all\ndecide what our CI types are and\n\n204\n00:11:53.544 --> 00:11:55.408\nremember how we implement.\n\n205\n00:11:55.408 --> 00:12:00.509\nWe plan, we manage and plan and\nthen we identify then we look for\n\n206\n00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:03.592\nhow we're going to control our CIs and\n\n207\n00:12:03.592 --> 00:12:09.340\nthen we perform status accounting and\nverification and audit.\n\n208\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.910\nSo I'm looking for\nthese steps probably in my answer.\n\n209\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:17.675\nThe technical managers want CMS to\ncapture information about hardware.\n\n210\n00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:21.525\nPlus all of the 50 attributes they\ncurrently maintain in the spreadsheet.\n\n211\n00:12:21.525 --> 00:12:25.615\nAnd the application managers\nwant detailed, very detailed,\n\n212\n00:12:25.615 --> 00:12:27.415\napplication information.\n\n213\n00:12:27.415 --> 00:12:28.952\nAnd they want their own CMS.\n\n214\n00:12:28.952 --> 00:12:33.105\nThe service desk wants to see CI\ninformation related to incidents and\n\n215\n00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:35.976\nproblems but\nnot all of the technical details.\n\n216\n00:12:35.976 --> 00:12:39.798\nOkay, well that's okay because\nwe can control access and\n\n217\n00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:42.294\nwhat they can see via user profiles but\n\n218\n00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:47.521\nthey need CI's link to services to\neffectively determine priorities, okay.\n\n219\n00:12:47.521 --> 00:12:50.481\nThat's okay,\nwe want to determine the scope here.\n\n220\n00:12:50.481 --> 00:12:53.151\nChange management wants to\nsee relationships, so again,\n\n221\n00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:55.511\nthey can determine the scope.\n\n222\n00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:59.091\nAnd they believe that a single\nconfiguration management database should\n\n223\n00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:00.121\nhold information.\n\n224\n00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:02.191\nDon't forget,\nwe can have multiple databases,\n\n225\n00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:07.110\nbut one federated CMS,\none Configuration Management System.\n\n226\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.020\nYou're welcome as an consultant, and\nyou've been asked to give advice on how to\n\n227\n00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.280\ndetermine a realistic scope for Service\nAsset and Configuration Management, and\n\n228\n00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.860\nmeet key stakeholder needs.\n\n229\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.290\nRight, okay, wow, so\nhow would I go about this then?\n\n230\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.060\nWell, first of all,\nI need to decide what I'm going to do.\n\n231\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.640\nSo I'm going to create a policy\nthat defines my scope,\n\n232\n00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.540\nI need to decide what I'm gonna do.\n\n233\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.620\nWork with stakeholders, I'm looking at\nA here, all of my stakeholders, and\n\n234\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.930\nagree on the configuration items\nthat were going to be controlled.\n\n235\n00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.710\nAnd how many attributes that we're\ngoing to not just control and\n\n236\n00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.330\nkeep but\nalso how many we're going to share.\n\n237\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.810\nWe want to [INAUDIBLE] that\nrelies on that federated debt.\n\n238\n00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.316\nThere we go,\nthat was the word I just mentioned.\n\n239\n00:13:55.316 --> 00:13:59.774\nIt will allow relationships to be\nmaintained as well as having that\n\n240\n00:13:59.774 --> 00:14:02.801\nflexibility that in individual databases,\n\n241\n00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:06.640\neach particular area can\nmaintain their own databases.\n\n242\n00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.630\nSo if we go back to the scenario,\ntechnical managers can have their\n\n243\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.600\ndatabase, application managers can\nhave their database, change management\n\n244\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.540\ncan have their database but\nit will all be part of a federated CMS.\n\n245\n00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.760\nPerfect that's a at excellent.\n\n246\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.200\nLet's take a look at c cuz\nc is my three pointer.\n\n247\n00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.515\nSo C creates a policy but\nthis focuses initially on my [INAUDIBLE]\n\n248\n00:14:34.515 --> 00:14:38.035\ninto a common architecture\nbased on a single database.\n\n249\n00:14:38.035 --> 00:14:40.165\nThat's exactly what I don't want.\n\n250\n00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:42.205\nBecause different organizations or\n\n251\n00:14:42.205 --> 00:14:44.955\ndifferent departments will\nwant to see different things.\n\n252\n00:14:44.955 --> 00:14:49.967\nSo I either want to have\ndifferent databases within the cms\n\n253\n00:14:49.967 --> 00:14:54.670\nthat are federated, or\nI want to have one database, or\n\n254\n00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.168\none system where I have access control.\n\n255\n00:14:58.168 --> 00:15:03.993\nAnd they're talking about a common\narchitecture based on a single database.\n\n256\n00:15:03.993 --> 00:15:07.176\nNo, we'd be better off with\ndifferent databases, but\n\n257\n00:15:07.176 --> 00:15:10.780\nwith that relationship in place\nbetween all of the databases.\n\n258\n00:15:11.788 --> 00:15:15.510\nWorking with the stakeholders to agree\non the level of detail to be captured in\n\n259\n00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.660\nconfiguration records, taking in to\naccount both their requirements and\n\n260\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.920\nthe requirements of other\nservice management processes.\n\n261\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.220\nRight, but\nthey've all got different requirements.\n\n262\n00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.270\nAnd that's why we need to\nhave different databases.\n\n263\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.200\nBecause every single one of\nthese processes is going to tell\n\n264\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.370\nyou that theirs are more important.\n\n265\n00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.339\nReduce costs out of the resources\nrequired to maintain it by eliminating\n\n266\n00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:44.170\nmultiple existing databases and\nthe redundant work that they create.\n\n267\n00:15:46.573 --> 00:15:51.178\nWell, what we want to do is we\nwant to combine everything.\n\n268\n00:15:51.178 --> 00:15:54.336\nRather than eliminate them,\nwe want to combine.\n\n269\n00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:58.207\nAnd this shouldn't be redundant\nwork if we've got that If we've got\n\n270\n00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:03.210\nthe relationships in place then there\nshouldn't be any redundant work.\n\n271\n00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.720\nWith those relationships in place,\nif we update in one database then it\n\n272\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.560\nupdates that information\nin all of our databases.\n\n273\n00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.200\nSo that shouldn't happen.\n\n274\n00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.950\nSo that last particular comment in C\ndefinitely is the wrong answer to that.\n\n275\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.680\nAnd that's why that is your three\npointer and not your five pointer.\n\n276\n00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.680\nBecause your five pointer looks at having\nthe relationships between your databases.\n\n277\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.200\nWhat about D then?\n\n278\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.768\nD is a one pointer.\n\n279\n00:16:28.768 --> 00:16:31.595\nAnd D creates a policy\nthat defines the scope for\n\n280\n00:16:31.595 --> 00:16:34.070\nSACM to be the same as change management.\n\n281\n00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.044\nOkay, there's an assumption.\n\n282\n00:16:35.044 --> 00:16:39.545\nWho says that change management should\nhave everything that they want, when all\n\n283\n00:16:39.545 --> 00:16:43.861\nof the other functional areas shouldn't\nget anything that they want at all?\n\n284\n00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:47.320\nThat straightaway tells\nme that that's wrong.\n\n285\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.770\nBecause I'm not considering\nall of my stakeholders.\n\n286\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:53.480\nI've just considered change\nmanagement right at the beginning.\n\n287\n00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.240\nThus all services, systems, physical\ncomponents that are under the control of\n\n288\n00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.870\nchange management will also be under the\ncontrol of asset configuration management\n\n289\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.260\nand changes will be captured\nin a single repository.\n\n290\n00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.550\nThat's fine, but\nwhat about everybody else?\n\n291\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:12.810\nThe SACM process owner will work with key\nstakeholders to determine what attributes\n\n292\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:18.210\nwill be maintained for the COs, driven by\nthe required degree of change control.\n\n293\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:23.020\nYou have not considered anybody else in\nthis answer other than just a cursory\n\n294\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:28.000\nglance that says, work with these\nstakeholders but we're gonna control this.\n\n295\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.160\nAbsolutely not.\n\n296\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.960\nReally, really don't like that.\n\n297\n00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.884\nSo if I don't like that, I'm\ndefinitely not gonna like B then, am I?\n\n298\n00:17:33.884 --> 00:17:36.070\n[LAUGH] Let's have a look and\nsee what's wrong with B.\n\n299\n00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:41.270\nCuz B is my distractor and B says, create\na policy that defines the scope, okay.\n\n300\n00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.310\nI'm all right.\n\n301\n00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:46.250\nThe scope should meet each manager's\nneed to have different levels of detail.\n\n302\n00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.600\nAll right, well I mean, that's the same\nas working with key stakeholders.\n\n303\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.100\nOkay.\n\n304\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.520\nStakeholders will be allowed\nto track their own attributes\n\n305\n00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.630\nin their spreadsheets or databases.\n\n306\n00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.470\nWell how is that different than\nwhat we're doing right now?\n\n307\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:07.840\nTo facilitate a quickly implemented and\nwidely accepted SACM process.\n\n308\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.200\nSo we've got no mention of tools.\n\n309\n00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.715\nWe're just going to implement\na process that involves\n\n310\n00:18:12.715 --> 00:18:15.348\neverybody just doing everything\nthat they were before.\n\n311\n00:18:15.348 --> 00:18:17.520\nOkay, yeah, that makes sense.\n\n312\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.110\nI don't think.\n\n313\n00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.510\nSecurity controls will provide\naccess on a need to know basis.\n\n314\n00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.305\nThey've already got that.\n\n315\n00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:26.550\nThey've already got their own services.\n\n316\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.182\nThey've already got\ntheir own spreadsheets.\n\n317\n00:18:28.182 --> 00:18:29.231\nThey've already got this.\n\n318\n00:18:29.231 --> 00:18:30.980\nHow is this a change?\n\n319\n00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.070\nSuch an approach will offer rapid and\nachievable benefits.\n\n320\n00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.645\nNot really.\n\n321\n00:18:36.645 --> 00:18:40.580\nIt's not gonna offer any benefits\nbecause you're not changing anything.\n\n322\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.669\nWhile avoiding a costly long term project.\n\n323\n00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:44.890\nWell, it's certainly gonna do that.\n\n324\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.660\nCuz you're absolutely\ndoing nothing at all.\n\n325\n00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.650\nThat delivers full technical details.\n\n326\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.185\nYeah, everybody gets exactly what\nthey want, but you know what?\n\n327\n00:18:52.185 --> 00:18:53.662\nThere's no control over it, and\n\n328\n00:18:53.662 --> 00:18:56.793\ncertainly there's not a change\nmanagement control over this at all.\n\n329\n00:18:56.793 --> 00:19:00.140\nSo B basically says leave it as it is.\n\n330\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.860\nCreate a process, maybe, but\njust leave everything else as it is.\n\n331\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.030\nThat will work, won't it?\n\n332\n00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.410\nNo. [LAUGH]. It won't, okay?\n\n333\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.630\nDefinitely not.\n\n334\n00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.571\nSo A,\ndefinitely your five-pointer in that one.\n\n335\n00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:17.210\nSo let's take a look at number seven,\nthen, question number seven.\n\n336\n00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.660\nWhich of these is the most\nappropriate approach for\n\n337\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.740\nalways staying with service asset and\nconfiguration management, but\n\n338\n00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.880\nwe're looking now at roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n339\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.840\nWe've got a very small company and\n\n340\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.890\nwe've implemented process\nimprovement across the whole of IT.\n\n341\n00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.950\nInitial efforts were focused\non incident and change and\n\n342\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:39.150\nnow there's interest in maturing\ncapabilities around SACM.\n\n343\n00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.840\nThe goal is to define and implement\nthe process over a nine month period.\n\n344\n00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.568\nAnd then begin work on releasing\ndeployment management.\n\n345\n00:19:47.568 --> 00:19:51.836\nWe've already got several roles for\nchange, including the process owner and\n\n346\n00:19:51.836 --> 00:19:54.615\nprocess manager as well as\na cab structure, and yet\n\n347\n00:19:54.615 --> 00:19:57.280\nthis is an IT department\nof a very small company.\n\n348\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.830\nThis sounds like a lot of people already.\n\n349\n00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.610\nYes, the small size of the company.\n\n350\n00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.530\nWe've got low complexibility.\n\n351\n00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:08.760\nSo the change manager is able to handle\nall of the performance risk evaluations\n\n352\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.530\nand the incident manager maintains\nthe integrated tool suite,\n\n353\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.310\nthe service management tool suite,\nall process areas.\n\n354\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.460\nAnd, of course, they're responsible for\nincident management.\n\n355\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.380\nHe's concerned about the additional\neffort to maintain a CMS system, and\n\n356\n00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:31.240\nsuggests that creating a dedicated\nCMS in tools and an administrative\n\n357\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.148\nrole should be considered to\nhandle the housekeeping of this.\n\n358\n00:20:35.148 --> 00:20:37.730\nBut it was just a small company.\n\n359\n00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:43.410\nThat means bringing somebody else in that\nmay not be fully utilized all the time.\n\n360\n00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.802\nThere's disagreement amongst\nthe newly appointed process and\n\n361\n00:20:47.802 --> 00:20:52.740\nall the process managers, as to what the\nappropriate role should initially be for\n\n362\n00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.570\nthe SACM process and\nin which order they should be introduced.\n\n363\n00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:02.810\nOkay, yeah, I can understand that because\nwe've got a very small organization here.\n\n364\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.728\nSo let's take a look then at our answers.\n\n365\n00:21:04.728 --> 00:21:06.100\nWhat answers have we got?\n\n366\n00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.750\nI just want to say one thing before\nwe do take a look at our answer.\n\n367\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:16.498\nI've already mentioned to you that this is\na very small organization and there was\n\n368\n00:21:16.498 --> 00:21:22.162\none thing here in this particular scenario\nthat I wanted to point it out, and that\n\n369\n00:21:22.162 --> 00:21:27.848\nis if we go down to that third paragraph\nthere within the actual scenario itself.\n\n370\n00:21:27.848 --> 00:21:32.825\nThey're looking at the additional\neffort required to maintain a CMS, and\n\n371\n00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:38.530\nhe suggests that creating a dedicated CMS\nsystem and an adminstrational role, etc.\n\n372\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.055\nNow, what I was gonna say at this point\nin time is with a small organization,\n\n373\n00:21:43.055 --> 00:21:47.936\nit is perfectly feasible that these roles\nare combined and its perfectly feasible\n\n374\n00:21:47.936 --> 00:21:52.629\nthat the role of change manager and the\nrole of SACM manager would be combined.\n\n375\n00:21:52.629 --> 00:21:56.435\nIt's perfectly feasible that\nthe role of incident manager and\n\n376\n00:21:56.435 --> 00:22:00.940\nrequest fulfillment manager,\netc., would be combined.\n\n377\n00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:08.260\nSo don't think about having a separate\nprocess manager for each process.\n\n378\n00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.720\nIf it's a small environment\nit's perfectly feasible for\n\n379\n00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.660\none person to perform many roles.\n\n380\n00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:21.220\nNow, the larger the environment then\nthe more spread out that's going to be.\n\n381\n00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:26.057\nAnd with a global organization,\nit's perfectly feasible to have five,\n\n382\n00:22:26.057 --> 00:22:27.937\nsix, ten change managers.\n\n383\n00:22:27.937 --> 00:22:29.647\nBut with a small organization,\n\n384\n00:22:29.647 --> 00:22:32.751\nwe might have one person\nperforming change management and\n\n385\n00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:37.820\nservice asset configuration management,\nand releasing deployment management too.\n\n386\n00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.740\nSo always think about scalability.\n\n387\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.640\nIt should always be,\nit's that business context,\n\n388\n00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.210\nshould always be the first thing that\nyou pick out within your scenario.\n\n389\n00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.520\nAnd look at my answers.\n\n390\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.040\nThere we go.\n\n391\n00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.880\nMy five-pointer is C.\n\n392\n00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.750\nPriority should be a complying change,\nconfiguration management, and\n\n393\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.140\nrelease manager role.\n\n394\n00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.450\nYes, cuz we've got a small organization.\n\n395\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.880\nMost likely filled by\nthe existing change manager,\n\n396\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.350\nwould work with the process\nowner to define the scope.\n\n397\n00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.766\nAnd depending on the requirements,\nthen separate roles for an analyst,\n\n398\n00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:15.260\nthe librarian and an administrator,\n\n399\n00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:20.370\nand R&amp;D practitioner should\nbe evaluated at a later\n\n400\n00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:25.410\ndate when we know exactly\nwhat is required.\n\n401\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.770\nWe start small, keep it simple.\n\n402\n00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.910\nIts the basis,\nits one of our CSI guiding principles.\n\n403\n00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.088\nWe keep it simple.\n\n404\n00:23:35.088 --> 00:23:36.591\nWe start small.\n\n405\n00:23:36.591 --> 00:23:40.480\nWe do not try and\ndo everything all at the same time.\n\n406\n00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.509\nThink about organizational\nchange management.\n\n407\n00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:50.023\nWhen we looked at that particular process,\nlooking through there, we started small.\n\n408\n00:23:50.023 --> 00:23:52.183\nSmall visible improvement.\n\n409\n00:23:52.183 --> 00:23:55.784\nDon't try and do absolutely everything.\n\n410\n00:23:55.784 --> 00:24:00.315\nOr as Cherokee said don't try and\neat all of the elephant.\n\n411\n00:24:00.315 --> 00:24:05.080\nI think it was something along those\nlines during that episode, who knows?\n\n412\n00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.050\nLet's look at our three pointer then and\nthe three pointer is D and\n\n413\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.660\nthat says that the SACM\nprocess manager and\n\n414\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.590\nthe configuration analyst roles\nshould be defined and staffed first.\n\n415\n00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.730\nI don't like that, cuz there's\nan assumption that we need a configuration\n\n416\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.620\nanalyst role and\nwe need a process manager.\n\n417\n00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.705\nHowever, it's just talking about\ndefining initially, when then staffing?\n\n418\n00:24:29.705 --> 00:24:32.030\nHm, that's implying that\nwe need two people.\n\n419\n00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.740\nThe process manager will be needed to plan\nand coordinate process activities and\n\n420\n00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.922\nbegin an awareness campaign to\nwin support for the process.\n\n421\n00:24:39.922 --> 00:24:43.050\nAnd I'm really really happy with that, but\n\n422\n00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.820\nthat could still be done\nby the change manager.\n\n423\n00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:52.650\nThe configuration analyst well can focus\non scope process and procedures, okay.\n\n424\n00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:59.500\nBut a configuration analyst while the\nmanager should be focusing on scope, okay.\n\n425\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.090\nIn time the organization can evaluate\nthe need for additional roles.\n\n426\n00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.170\nAnd I agree with that, but\n\n427\n00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.670\nI still think we're starting\noff with too many new roles.\n\n428\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.280\nThis is just a very small organization.\n\n429\n00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.350\nAnd so\nthere's no reason why our existing roles,\n\n430\n00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.450\nour existing people cannot undertake this.\n\n431\n00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.360\nRemember, think scalability.\n\n432\n00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.410\nScalability is going to get\nyou a five pointer on this.\n\n433\n00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.730\nIf you don't think scale,\nyou will be tempted to go for\n\n434\n00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.450\none of the other answers.\n\n435\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.640\nLook at our one pointer, which is A.\n\n436\n00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.180\nGiven the very different responsibilities,\n\n437\n00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.770\nthree separate staff roles should\nbe established and staffed first.\n\n438\n00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:39.450\nNamely the process manager or\nconfiguration analyst and configuration\n\n439\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.290\nlibrarian which provides the appropriate\nchecks and balances between roles.\n\n440\n00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:49.080\nAnd once the process has been implemented\nthen we get a dedicated CMS and\n\n441\n00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.880\ntools administrator role.\n\n442\n00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.910\nWow as well as a release and\ndeployment management role.\n\n443\n00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.836\nWe're just throwing\npeople at this company.\n\n444\n00:25:57.836 --> 00:26:01.383\nWhat I've noticed is that with\nevery single answer that we have,\n\n445\n00:26:01.383 --> 00:26:05.510\nas we've gone from the five pointer to\nthe three pointer to the one pointer,\n\n446\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.430\nwe've just gone up and up and\nup and up and up in scale.\n\n447\n00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.510\nAnd we're in a very small company.\n\n448\n00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.870\nYeah, we've got to start small.\n\n449\n00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.580\nLet's take a look a B then,\nB's our distractor.\n\n450\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:25.000\nThe CMS and the tools administrator\nrole should be defined first.\n\n451\n00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.930\nNo, no,\n\n452\n00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:31.110\nno, no, that's kind of what I would say\nis putting the cart before the horse.\n\n453\n00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:35.140\nWe define the process first and\nthen we go and\n\n454\n00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.680\nsource the tools that will\nfacilitate the process.\n\n455\n00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.700\nIt's a basic principle.\n\n456\n00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:46.190\nDecide what you're going to do first and\nthen you go and source the tool.\n\n457\n00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.430\nYou don't do it the other way around.\n\n458\n00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.140\nB's doing it the wrong way around, okay?\n\n459\n00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.010\nWe're gonna go and find the tool first.\n\n460\n00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:57.320\nAnd then we're going to assess\nthe service management tools.\n\n461\n00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:03.140\nAnd we're going to look for\nour configuration management capabilities.\n\n462\n00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.925\nGiven the significant upfront\nwork typically needed for\n\n463\n00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:11.145\nplanning this,\nthe role would ensure that the tools will\n\n464\n00:27:11.145 --> 00:27:15.075\nbe ready to manage the processes\ndesigned by the process owner.\n\n465\n00:27:16.091 --> 00:27:21.399\nNo, no, no, no, no, we define the process\nfirst and then we go and select the tool.\n\n466\n00:27:21.399 --> 00:27:23.988\nA release and deployment,\n\n467\n00:27:23.988 --> 00:27:29.630\nprocess owner should be identified to\nbegin planning efforts for that process.\n\n468\n00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.555\nThat's down to the process manager,\nnot the process owner.\n\n469\n00:27:33.555 --> 00:27:37.670\nYeah, we've done things completely\nthe wrong way around in B.\n\n470\n00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:42.530\nSo not only has B gone for bringing in\nadditional people that we don't need.\n\n471\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:47.500\nBut B has done things the wrong way around\nin that we decided that we're gonna go and\n\n472\n00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.260\nsort out our tool first, and\nthen we'll work on our process.\n\n473\n00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.720\nDefinitely the wrong way around.\n\n474\n00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.890\nWork on our process and\nthen we go and find our tool.\n\n475\n00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.510\nSo let's take a look, then, at number 8.\n\n476\n00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.250\nThis is the our last\nquestion in this test paper.\n\n477\n00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:07.875\nWe've looked at now, the CSFs full\nservice transition at a whole.\n\n478\n00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:11.365\nWe've got a company with mature and\nincident problem and\n\n479\n00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:12.975\nchange management processes.\n\n480\n00:28:12.975 --> 00:28:15.465\nThis is what they all seem to start,\nright.\n\n481\n00:28:15.465 --> 00:28:18.295\nAnd they make good service asset and\n\n482\n00:28:18.295 --> 00:28:20.870\nconfiguration management data and\nspreadsheets.\n\n483\n00:28:22.055 --> 00:28:27.305\nEach process is successful in terms of\nits own execution, however the CIO is\n\n484\n00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:33.120\nnoticing some trends that are not common\namong mature service organizations,\n\n485\n00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.860\nsuch as inconsistent documentation and\nexecution.\n\n486\n00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.330\nStaff are frequently solving similar\nissues on newer change services\n\n487\n00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:47.570\nduring release and\nunexpected service outages due to changes.\n\n488\n00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:53.060\nAnd the CIO feels that what's needed is to\nformally implement service transitions.\n\n489\n00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.220\nFunding for it is available.\n\n490\n00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.440\nAnd in order to obtain it, the CIO just\nhas to articulate what service transition\n\n491\n00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.030\nrequires in order to be successful.\n\n492\n00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.940\nSo what does service transition require?\n\n493\n00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.140\nWell, we need to integrate\nwith everything else,\n\n494\n00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.760\nall of our other processes that\nwe currently have in place.\n\n495\n00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.260\nAnd we need to develop good quality\nprocesses and systems and tools and\n\n496\n00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.230\nprocedures.\n\n497\n00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:24.460\nAnd we've got to understand service and\ntechnical configurations and\n\n498\n00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.900\nall of their relationships and\nall of their dependencies.\n\n499\n00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.350\nOkay, that sounds great to me.\n\n500\n00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:33.970\nAnd let's take a look then at\nYD which is our three pointer,\n\n501\n00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:36.100\nis actually our three pointer.\n\n502\n00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.570\nBecause we talk about defining clear\naccountabilities and roles and\n\n503\n00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.660\nresponsibilities.\n\n504\n00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.840\nI would want to think about\nwhere we are right now.\n\n505\n00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.980\nWe've already started\ninto the planning and\n\n506\n00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.400\nwe've not looked at what processes\nwe have in place right now.\n\n507\n00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.950\nBut integration, we're looking for\ncritical success factors here.\n\n508\n00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.550\nClaim accountabilities, roles, and\n\n509\n00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:02.230\nresponsibilities is not a critical\nsuccess factor for this.\n\n510\n00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.840\nCreating and maintaining knowledge,\n\n511\n00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.280\nokay I like this,\nin a form that people can find and use.\n\n512\n00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:15.230\nThat will help us address the error of\n\n513\n00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:19.490\nthe fact that it's taken us too\nlong to resolve things, okay.\n\n514\n00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:23.799\nUltimately, processes to eliminate\nerrors and improve efficiency.\n\n515\n00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.260\nThat's all very well and good.\n\n516\n00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.480\nBut then let's take a look\nback at our scenario.\n\n517\n00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.360\nAnd our scenario talked about\ninconsistent process documentation and\n\n518\n00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.360\nexecution across of those processes.\n\n519\n00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.040\nSo there is nothing in that\nparticular answer in D that\n\n520\n00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.010\nlooks at that integration.\n\n521\n00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.960\nThere is in A but there's nothing in D and\n\n522\n00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.280\nthen let's look at staff\nare frequently solving similar issues.\n\n523\n00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.880\nOkay, so\nwe've looked at knowledge management and\n\n524\n00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.620\nwe've got unexpected service\noutages due to changes,\n\n525\n00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.270\nis automating things,\nis that gonna help with that?\n\n526\n00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.920\nI don't think so.\n\n527\n00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.880\nWhat about B?\n\n528\n00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.938\nClearly defined relationships,\nI like, with program and\n\n529\n00:31:05.938 --> 00:31:11.005\nproject management,\nof which there is no mention in here.\n\n530\n00:31:11.005 --> 00:31:12.914\nNo mention at all.\n\n531\n00:31:12.914 --> 00:31:17.510\nThere's mention of change management, but\nnot program and what have we got here?\n\n532\n00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:21.820\nProgram and project management,\ndo they have formal program and\n\n533\n00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:26.420\nproject management, is the organization\nlarge enough, does it say?\n\n534\n00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.510\nIt just says it's a company.\n\n535\n00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.470\nYou've made an assumption, be careful.\n\n536\n00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.040\nEstablishing a culture that\nenables knowledge to be shared.\n\n537\n00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.010\nEstablishing a culture is fine but\n\n538\n00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:41.210\nyou've gotta give them a vehicle to share\nthe knowledge and I don't see that.\n\n539\n00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.370\nDemonstrating improved cycle\ntime to deliver changes and\n\n540\n00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:50.390\nless variation in cost quality and\ntime, is that an issue?\n\n541\n00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:56.060\nI don't see any issue in time I see\nan issue with unexpected outages and\n\n542\n00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:00.840\nI see an issue with frequently\nsolving similar issues.\n\n543\n00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.898\nAnd I see an issue with inconsistency\nin the relationships but\n\n544\n00:32:04.898 --> 00:32:07.945\nI don't see any issues with time or\nwith cost.\n\n545\n00:32:09.737 --> 00:32:13.600\nWe just assume and we've got to\nthink relevance to the scenario.\n\n546\n00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.870\nSo let's take a look and see then.\n\n547\n00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:21.000\nMaintaining a stable production\nenvironment, if that had\n\n548\n00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.520\nsaid something about a stable operational\nenvironment when implementing changes.\n\n549\n00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.620\nI can be happy with that, but it doesn't.\n\n550\n00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.125\nDeveloping a workforce with\nthe necessary knowledge and skills.\n\n551\n00:32:34.125 --> 00:32:38.425\nI guess that's trying to combat\nthat second bullet point there of\n\n552\n00:32:38.425 --> 00:32:42.225\nfrequently solving similar issues but\nknowledge management would do that.\n\n553\n00:32:42.225 --> 00:32:45.025\nDeveloping a workforce with\nthe necessary knowledge,\n\n554\n00:32:45.025 --> 00:32:47.185\nthat's not part of service transition.\n\n555\n00:32:48.505 --> 00:32:52.235\nAnd demonstrating that the benefits\nof improving transition processes\n\n556\n00:32:52.235 --> 00:32:53.495\noutweigh the costs.\n\n557\n00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.900\nIt doesn't have to be any\nany costs involved in\n\n558\n00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.050\nimplementing service transition processes.\n\n559\n00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.630\nNobody says there has to be any costs.\n\n560\n00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:08.060\nSo that's kind of there as a nice little\ndistractor but you look at it and\n\n561\n00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.770\nyou think that makes sense.\n\n562\n00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.210\nBut as they say, that's there just\ncompletely as a distractor and\n\n563\n00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:17.090\nthere's nothing there that\nmentions cost at all.\n\n564\n00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.620\nFunding is available.\n\n565\n00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.260\nIt actually says that we've got funding.\n\n566\n00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.970\nAll we've got to do is\narticulate what we require.\n\n567\n00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.320\nFunding is available.\n\n568\n00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:29.930\nBe careful about making assumptions.\n\n569\n00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.600\nAssumptions will lead you\ninto the wrong answer.\n\n570\n00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.800\nBut that's why A.\n\n571\n00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.070\nA answers those three bullet points.\n\n572\n00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.590\nAnd it's the only one that does, even\nremotely answer those three bullet points.\n\n573\n00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:43.880\nSo that is it.\n\n574\n00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.690\nThat is a sample paper for\nservice transition.\n\n575\n00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:52.390\nIf you have any queries about\nthe service transition exam,\n\n576\n00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.210\nthen please contact us on the forum.\n\n577\n00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:58.470\nAnd I will be more than happy to\nanswer any queries that you may have.\n\n578\n00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:03.240\nBut, for now,\nI am Jo Peacock with ITProTV.\n\n579\n00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.386\nAnd it's been a pleasure\nhaving you with us.\n\n580\n00:34:05.386 --> 00:34:09.023\n[MUSIC]\n\n581\n00:34:09.023 --> 00:34:11.460\n[SOUND]\n\n",
