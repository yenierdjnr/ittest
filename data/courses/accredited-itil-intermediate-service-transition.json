          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.224\n[SOUND] Hi and welcome to ITPRO.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:08.174\nMy name is Jo Peacock, and\n\n3\n00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:14.127\nI'm going to be taking you through\nan introduction to your ITIL Intermediate.\n\n4\n00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:18.291\nSo let's take a look then at our\nfirst slide here, coming up.\n\n5\n00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:22.360\nAnd we have our introduction\nto our intermediate class, and\n\n6\n00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.730\nexactly what content is going to be found\nin this upcoming intermediate class.\n\n7\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.340\nYou will see, what we will cover\nis an introduction to the class,\n\n8\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.100\nfollowed by the principles and\nthe processes of the life cycle phase.\n\n9\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550\nThen we'll take a look organizing for\nthat life cycle phase,\n\n10\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.500\nand also the technology considerations,\n\n11\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270\nespecially those that we need when\nwe're implementing the phase itself.\n\n12\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.880\nThen we'll take a look at the challenges\nand the critical success factors, and\n\n13\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.140\nall of the risks that are associated\nwith that particular life cycle phase.\n\n14\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.603\nAnd most importantly of course for\nyou, is that preparation for\n\n15\n00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:04.980\nthe exam that's going to be coming up\nwhen you have completed your class, okay?\n\n16\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.670\nSo let me take a look now then at how\nwe're going to approach this particular\n\n17\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.790\nintermediate class.\n\n18\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe're going to be doing\nsome presentation work.\n\n19\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.550\nObviously, you're going to be watching us\non screen, both myself and my colleague.\n\n20\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110\nAnd we're going to be taking through\nthe course materials for the class.\n\n21\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.910\nAnd then,\nthere are going to be some discussions and\n\n22\n00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.530\nsome exercises that are going to be\nbased primarily in our chat rooms,\n\n23\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.140\nand also in our forums as well.\n\n24\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.530\nAnd we're also available, if you want\nto undertake any of the assessments.\n\n25\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.168\nThen please feel free to come\nback to us via the forums, and\n\n26\n00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:49.080\nwe will be able to help\nyou out in any way we can.\n\n27\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.808\nAlso provided in the course material,\nwhich is available for\n\n28\n00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:57.120\nyou to download are mock tests or\nexams, if you prefer to use that word.\n\n29\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.720\nAnd we will be conducting a run\nthrough of that mock exam for you.\n\n30\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.621\nSo where are we then at\nITIL intermediate level?\n\n31\n00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:11.873\nWell, you'll see in\nusing Bloom's Taxonomy,\n\n32\n00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:14.820\nthat we are actually at level 4 analyzing.\n\n33\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.100\nIn other words,\nwe've done at foundation level.\n\n34\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.081\nWe've done the remembering and\n\n35\n00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:23.243\nthe understanding of those\nconcepts within ITIL.\n\n36\n00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:27.686\nAnd we're actually moving through\napplying those concepts to\n\n37\n00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:33.090\nanalyzing those concepts, and\nbeing able to apply the ITIL processes.\n\n38\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.248\nAnd also the concepts at a real-world\nlevel in a real-world situation.\n\n39\n00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:42.590\nSo where does ITIL comes from then?\n\n40\n00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.849\nWell, let me give you\na little bit of a background.\n\n41\n00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.857\nIt's actually owned by\na company called Axelos.\n\n42\n00:02:47.857 --> 00:02:54.110\nAnd it was first published in\nthe mid 1980s by the UK government.\n\n43\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.748\nAnd the Office of Government Commerce\nowned ITIL for a very, very long time.\n\n44\n00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:05.196\nAnd we developed ITIL right\nthe way back from the 1980s\n\n45\n00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:08.828\nthrough it's version two in the 1990's,\n\n46\n00:03:08.828 --> 00:03:14.115\nmid 1990's to version three,\nwhich was released in 2007.\n\n47\n00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:18.848\nAnd then there was an update\nto version three in 2011,\n\n48\n00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:22.140\nwhich is exactly where we are right now.\n\n49\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.010\nIt is copyrighted.\n\n50\n00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.110\nIt is trademark protected.\n\n51\n00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.960\nIt's a framework for managing services,\nand as such it is a flexible framework.\n\n52\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.730\nA framework that we would expect any\norganization to adopt as a framework,\n\n53\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.948\nbut then to adopt it to suit your needs,\nokay?\n\n54\n00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:44.209\nITIL was born right\nthe way back in the 1980s,\n\n55\n00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.180\nout of a desire to be able to\ndemonstrate value for money and\n\n56\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.070\nefficiency for\nthe use of taxpayers money within the UK.\n\n57\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.175\nWay back in the 1980s,\nthese things started appearing on desk.\n\n58\n00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:03.800\nAnd quite frankly, we didn't know\nhow to manage these in an unbiased,\n\n59\n00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.129\nin an impartial, and\nan efficient and effective way.\n\n60\n00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.420\nAnd thus ITIL was born.\n\n61\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.521\nAnd ITIL was born from a group of industry\nexperts that went out into the big wide\n\n62\n00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:21.397\nworld, and analyzed various organizations\nfrom a various different industry sectors,\n\n63\n00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:27.062\nnot just government, but we're talking\nfinance, we're talking retail, and etc.\n\n64\n00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:31.230\nAnd they came back with\na set of best practices.\n\n65\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:38.109\nBest practices that they observed in the\nreal world for managing our IT services.\n\n66\n00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:39.950\nAnd thus, we have ITIL.\n\n67\n00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.520\nAnd as I've already said,\nwe've had subsequent revisions.\n\n68\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.063\nAnd now, we're up to version three 2011.\n\n69\n00:04:46.063 --> 00:04:51.071\nSo we work on the understanding that,\n\n70\n00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:56.240\nwe have a life to every single service.\n\n71\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.960\nAnd we start off with a concept and\nservice strategy, and\n\n72\n00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.080\nthen we take that concept and\nwe design it.\n\n73\n00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.731\nAnd then we develop it, and\nwe deploy it as a service into a live\n\n74\n00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:14.573\nenvironment which is where we operate and\nwhere we maintain it.\n\n75\n00:05:14.573 --> 00:05:19.003\nAnd we continually seek to\nensure that we are aligned with\n\n76\n00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:21.969\nthe needs of the organization in CSI.\n\n77\n00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:27.130\nSo you're attending this class,\n\n78\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.027\nbecause you probably want to achieve\nan ITIL intermediate qualification, okay?\n\n79\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.920\nSo you can see that if we were\nto start off right at the very,\n\n80\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.292\nvery top, you'll see where I am.\n\n81\n00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:46.560\nI am an accredited ITIL trainer working\nwith an accredited training organization.\n\n82\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.610\nI'm also an accredited examiner and\nproctor or invigilator for\n\n83\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.020\nthese exams,and work very, very closely\nwith the official ITIL accreditor and\n\n84\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.560\nalso Axelos who owns the ITIL copyright.\n\n85\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.080\nNow in terms of ITIL, where can you\ngo with your qualification level?\n\n86\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.859\nWell, we start off with ITIL foundation.\n\n87\n00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:13.908\nAnd ITIL foundation is a,\nwould traditionally be a three day\n\n88\n00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:19.750\nclassroom experience where we learn\nthe foundations of ITIL, okay?\n\n89\n00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.692\nAnd we learned all the terminology and all\nof the definitions to that terminology.\n\n90\n00:06:23.692 --> 00:06:28.900\nThere's roughly around about 75 that we\nlearn within the ITIL foundation class.\n\n91\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.440\nAnd then as we move through, we can either\ntake an ITIL practitioner class, which can\n\n92\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.976\nbe taken at any point in time throughout\nthe progression of your career within\n\n93\n00:06:39.976 --> 00:06:46.220\nITIL, because ITIL practitioner focuses\non the implementation of ITIL, okay?\n\n94\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.210\nWhereas, if we take a look at the more\nadvanced intermediate classes,\n\n95\n00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.040\nyou are at this moment\nin a life cycle module.\n\n96\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.720\nAnd those life cycle modules consist\nof service strategies, service design,\n\n97\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.470\nservice transition, service operation,\nand continual service improvement.\n\n98\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.680\nAnd that’s where we focus on those\nlife cycles that we've just looked at\n\n99\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.330\npreviously.\n\n100\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.268\nOkay, and on the right-hand side\nthen we have our capability modules.\n\n101\n00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:22.461\nAnd these capability modules really focus\non specific areas within ITIL such as RCV,\n\n102\n00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:27.372\nwhich focuses on release control and\nvalidation.\n\n103\n00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:30.897\nAnd these classes,\nyou will notice that every single one\n\n104\n00:07:30.897 --> 00:07:34.430\nof this classes has got\na score right beside each one.\n\n105\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.080\nSo we've got a number two for\nITIL foundation and we've got a three for\n\n106\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.660\nlife cycle modules, and we've got\na four for our capability modules.\n\n107\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:50.700\nNow what we need to do is ensure\nthat we have achieved a minimum\n\n108\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:57.935\nof 15 credits at both either life cycle or\ncapability module level.\n\n109\n00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:03.855\nIn order to be able to qualify to see\nthe managing across the life cycle class,\n\n110\n00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:08.665\nand the full subsequently,\nthe test that goes among with that class.\n\n111\n00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:11.995\nSo we need to take two\nfrom the ITIL foundation.\n\n112\n00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:15.065\nThat's a prerequisite,\nwe have to do the foundation and\n\n113\n00:08:15.065 --> 00:08:19.500\nthen we need to add in another\n15 scores from either,\n\n114\n00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.090\nas I've said, the life cycle or capability\nstream, now you can interchange.\n\n115\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:29.100\nYou can mix and match, you do not have\nto stick to one stream or the other.\n\n116\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.215\nOnce you've gotten that 17 in total scores\n\n117\n00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:37.165\nthat are needed to be able to sit\nmanaging across the life cycle.\n\n118\n00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:41.345\nYour perfectly able to sit\nthat life cycle class and\n\n119\n00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:43.845\nto be able to take that test afterwards.\n\n120\n00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:48.341\nAnd as soon as you've taken that test,\nyou will be awarded those five\n\n121\n00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:52.307\ncredits which will mean that\nyou have achieved ITIL expert.\n\n122\n00:08:52.307 --> 00:08:57.442\nNow ITIL expert is allocated as soon\nas you have pass the management\n\n123\n00:08:57.442 --> 00:09:02.510\nacross the lifecycle test,\nand have achieved 22 credits.\n\n124\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:07.272\nBoth of those must happen in order for\nyou to achieve Itil expert.\n\n125\n00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:10.657\nNow we have the ITIL master qualification,\nand\n\n126\n00:09:10.657 --> 00:09:14.630\nthe ITIL master is\na completely different beast.\n\n127\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.220\nThe ITIL master is a two\nyear qualification.\n\n128\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.839\nAnd during that two years,\nyou will be expected to submit various\n\n129\n00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:31.191\nwhite papers on specific topics within\nthe ITIL qualifications scheme.\n\n130\n00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:35.598\nSo this could be topics on,\nactivities within ITIL.\n\n131\n00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:38.830\nThis could be talked with\nsome processes within ITIL.\n\n132\n00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.581\nThis could be topics on implementation\nof various aspects of ITIL.\n\n133\n00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:47.082\nBut you will be require to sit\na number of white papers or\n\n134\n00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:51.410\nsubmit a number of white papers\nover the period of two years.\n\n135\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.520\nAt the end of those two years,\nonce you have submitted the prerequisite\n\n136\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.260\nwhite papers, then you will be\nasked to attend a panel interview.\n\n137\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.630\nAnd during that panel interview\nyou will be assessed.\n\n138\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.760\nNot only on your white papers,\n\n139\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.880\nbut also on your experience within\nthe IT service management arena.\n\n140\n00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.890\nAnd at the end of that paneling to view,\n\n141\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.630\nthen if successful, you will be\nawarded the status of ITIL Master.\n\n142\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.700\nSo the qualification scheme,\n\n143\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.340\nI'm going to take this back\nnow to Bloom's taxonomy then.\n\n144\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.360\nAnd just very, very quickly, look at\nthe fact that an ITIL foundation, and\n\n145\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.450\nI know that I've already covered\nthis in a previous slide.\n\n146\n00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.700\nWe just looked at understanding\nthe terminology and\n\n147\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.150\nthe concepts of ITIL foundation.\n\n148\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.273\nAnd then in the lifecycle modules,\n\n149\n00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:45.679\nwe're looking at implementing those\nprocesses contained within ITIL.\n\n150\n00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:50.937\nAnd in capability, we're looking at\nactually undertaking those processes and\n\n151\n00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:52.802\nmanaging those processes.\n\n152\n00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:55.330\nWho is managing across the life cycle?\n\n153\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.890\nThis is for senior management.\n\n154\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.190\nThis is at CIO level and\nat senior management level, and\n\n155\n00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.905\nin as we like to abbreviate it to.\n\n156\n00:11:05.905 --> 00:11:10.165\nYour concern with leading\nIT service management.\n\n157\n00:11:10.165 --> 00:11:14.818\nSo I mentioned, right,\nat the very beginning of all of this,\n\n158\n00:11:14.818 --> 00:11:20.466\nthat we had a test to go along with every\nsingle lifecycle face and there is.\n\n159\n00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:25.573\nAnd we will conducting this session\nto go all over this particular test,\n\n160\n00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:30.345\nor at least a sample of this test\njust to give you some preparation for\n\n161\n00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:32.960\nthe actual test itself.\n\n162\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.600\nSo your test is conducted online,\nit's conducted virtually.\n\n163\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.120\nIt is an eight multiple\nchoice question test, okay?\n\n164\n00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.390\nIt's complex multiple choice.\n\n165\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.440\nYou get an hour and a half for\nthis particular test, and\n\n166\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.840\nwith every single question,\nyou will be given a scenario and\n\n167\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.270\nthen you will be given\nfour possible options,\n\n168\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.660\nfour possible answers for the question\nthat is posed along with that scenario.\n\n169\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.920\nYou get five points for\nthe best fit answer.\n\n170\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.730\nNow mentions out there are the most.\n\n171\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.667\nI always call it the best fit,\nbecause every single question asks what\n\n172\n00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:19.030\nis the best answer given the scenario and\ngiven the question?\n\n173\n00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:25.168\nDon't be alarmed if you don't see\nan answer that you think is 100% correct,\n\n174\n00:12:25.168 --> 00:12:29.152\nbecause the question is asking you for\nthe best fit.\n\n175\n00:12:29.152 --> 00:12:32.990\nAnd for that best fit,\nyou're gonna get five points.\n\n176\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.732\nFor the next best fit,\nyou're gonna get three.\n\n177\n00:12:35.732 --> 00:12:40.204\nFor the next one, which we've\nconsidered to be the least correct,\n\n178\n00:12:40.204 --> 00:12:41.783\nyou're gonna get one.\n\n179\n00:12:41.783 --> 00:12:45.050\nAnd for the next one,\nyou're gonna get a zero.\n\n180\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:50.110\nNow it mentions up on that slide there\nthat the next one is zero marks for\n\n181\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.020\nincorrect.\n\n182\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:56.490\nWe like to call that in the industry us\nin the know we call that the distractor.\n\n183\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.600\nAnd we call it the distractor for\na reason, cuz it distracts.\n\n184\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.215\nAnd quite often what you will find is with\nyour distractor a lot of the words and\n\n185\n00:13:05.215 --> 00:13:08.907\nthe terminology that are taken\nstraight out of the ITIL book,\n\n186\n00:13:08.907 --> 00:13:13.309\nstraight out of the publications, and\nour input into that zero pointed.\n\n187\n00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:17.122\nBecause it's there to distract,\nand it sounds great.\n\n188\n00:13:17.122 --> 00:13:21.825\nBut more often than not,\nthat distractor has no\n\n189\n00:13:21.825 --> 00:13:26.600\nrelevance to the scenario or\nto the question.\n\n190\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.390\nSo you have to be incredibly\ncareful with that.\n\n191\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.480\nIt's so easy to be distracted.\n\n192\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.270\nYou have to get 28 out of a possible\n40 in order to be able to pass,\n\n193\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.660\nand achieve accreditation at\nany lifecycle test, okay?\n\n194\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.960\nIf English is not your first language, you\nare allowed a paper dictionary, but you\n\n195\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.650\nwill be ask to show that to the proctor\nat that time that you take the test.\n\n196\n00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:02.410\nAnd as I've already said, you have to\nhave an ITIL foundation in version 3 or\n\n197\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:09.459\nversion 3 2011, or an ITIL version\n2 foundation bridge to version 3.\n\n198\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.940\nI will be very, very honest with you.\n\n199\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.500\nThere are not that many people that\nhave attained the version 2 to\n\n200\n00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.520\nversion 3 bridge, and\nmost people will have the version 3 or\n\n201\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.800\n2011, ITIL foundation certificate.\n\n202\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.730\nYou will be required to\nupload that certificate to\n\n203\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.510\nthe examining board prior to\nCT in your lifecycle test.\n\n204\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.430\nSo be prepared with that.\n\n205\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.590\nYou will need to have it to hand and\nsave as a PDF as well.\n\n206\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:50.160\nSo when we come to the end of\nevery single life cycle class,\n\n207\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.420\nwe will be going over, and\nthis one's no exception.\n\n208\n00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.410\nWe'll be going over a sample test for you.\n\n209\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.670\nAnd during that sample test,\nI'll be giving you lots of hints and\n\n210\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.150\ntips on how to select that\nbest fit possible answer.\n\n211\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.300\nAnd also, how to ensure that you read\nthe full question, how to relax and\n\n212\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.740\nto make sure that you approach\nit with an open mind.\n\n213\n00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.100\nBut you consider relevance\nin every single answer.\n\n214\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.321\nUltimately, we wanna get you past\nthe test just as much as you want\n\n215\n00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:24.738\nto achieve that accreditation.\n\n216\n00:15:24.738 --> 00:15:30.473\nSo just to sum up what we will be\ndoing over the next few shows,\n\n217\n00:15:30.473 --> 00:15:37.231\nis encouraging you to take your ITIL\nlifecycle intermediate classes.\n\n218\n00:15:37.231 --> 00:15:41.685\nAnd feel free to join us in the forums for\nany questions that you may have.\n\n219\n00:15:41.685 --> 00:15:45.954\n[SOUND]\n\n",
