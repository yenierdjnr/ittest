Glad to be here Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.940\n&gt;&gt; So what are we gonna be looking\nat when we talk about ITIL SOA.\n\n12\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.030\n&gt;&gt; Well service offers and agreements\nborrows from a couple of the ITIL books,\n\n13\n00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.960\nservice strategy and service design.\n\n14\n00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.140\nThere's many topics as you can\nsee here on the PowerPoint here.\n\n15\n00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.290\nMany topics to cover.\n\n16\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.740\nSome of these came from\na service strategy book,\n\n17\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.580\nsome of them came from\na service design book, right.\n\n18\n00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.030\nPortfolio management, you came recall,\nservice level management, service catalog,\n\n19\n00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.890\ndemand management, etc.\n\n20\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.640\nThese are processes within\nThe ITIL framework, and\n\n21\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.590\nwe're gonna talk about these.\n\n22\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.410\nWe'll also talk about roles and\nresponsibilities, and considerations for\n\n23\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.460\ntechnology, and\nthe implementation of these processes.\n\n24\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.850\nTo do so, we'll also kinda set the stage\nof what is service strategy trying to get\n\n25\n00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.630\ndone, what is service design\ntrying to get done, and then,\n\n26\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.040\nthese processes come together\nto satisfy those goals.\n\n27\n00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.070\nOf course we're also preparing for\nan exam.\n\n28\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.930\nIt's not just enough to get ready for\nwork,\n\n29\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.210\nthis course is also designed\nto get you ready for an exam.\n\n30\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.560\nIf it's your first intermediate\nyou're gonna find that\n\n31\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.610\nthis course work is a quite\na bit different than foundation.\n\n32\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.660\nFoundation is rote memorization,\nmemorizing things and understanding it.\n\n33\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.290\nAt this level of learning\nwe're gonna be applying and\n\n34\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.550\nanalyzing with particular\nfocus on analysis.\n\n35\n00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.140\nSo the way this exam plays out, is you're\ngoing to be reading a scenario and\n\n36\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.620\nthen using your knowledge of ITL,\nthings you've already remembered and\n\n37\n00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.970\nunderstand, using that knowledge,\nyou're going to analyze the scenario and\n\n38\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.897\nthen try to pick the best\nanswer out of four choices.\n\n39\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.040\n&gt;&gt; So Terry, I don't have any\nbackground information with ITIL.\n\n40\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.140\nI haven't sat through\nthat foundations course.\n\n41\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.670\nWould you recommend doing so\nat this time if I haven't,\n\n42\n00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.440\nto, you know, to others out there.\n\n43\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.940\n&gt;&gt; I recommend it for\na couple of reasons, one is requirement.\n\n44\n00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.150\nIt's an official prerequisite to have the\nfoundation exam before you get credit for\n\n45\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.630\nthe service strategy exam or for any,\nthe intermediate exams, I should say.\n\n46\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.350\nSo it is a requirement.\n\n47\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.580\nIt's also recommended.\n\n48\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.920\nThese exams are going to assume\nyou have that knowledge.\n\n49\n00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.040\nAnd without that knowledge,\n\n50\n00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.610\nyou'd be swimming around in the dark\nquite a bit on the intermediate levels.\n\n51\n00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, at least we have you\nhere to help us guide the way.\n\n52\n00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.513\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, shine some light.\n\n53\n00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:50.795\nI shall do that.\n\n54\n00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:54.065\nGreat, so,\nas we look at how we're gonna learn this,\n\n55\n00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:56.400\nof course I'm gonna be presenting.\n\n56\n00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.450\nI'm gonna be using theory and lecture\napproach and giving real world examples.\n\n57\n00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.204\nI have over 12 year of experience\nin IT service management with\n\n58\n00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:09.405\nITIL as the framework for that experience.\n\n59\n00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:12.850\nAnd bringing those real world examples\nhopefully will shine light and\n\n60\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.250\ngive you some real world\napplication back at the office.\n\n61\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.820\nAs you prepare for the exam,\n\n62\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.174\nyou're going to get some\ndiscussions to the ITProTV forum.\n\n63\n00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:28.205\nExercises and mock tests, practice exams,\nare available for download.\n\n64\n00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:31.845\nThe importance of these practice\nexams can't be overstated.\n\n65\n00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:35.615\nThey really do get you into\nthe mindset of the test maker and\n\n66\n00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.125\ngives you an idea of their techniques for\n\n67\n00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:41.750\ntesting the objectives of these\nintermediate level topics.\n\n68\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.610\nAnd they do so in a way that's fair and\nvery constructive.\n\n69\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.580\nYou can learn a lot just by\ntaking the practice exams.\n\n70\n00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.390\nEven if you fail the practice\nexams you can learn a lot\n\n71\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.890\njust by leading the rationale.\n\n72\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.040\n&gt;&gt; So Terry,\nwhere can we get these practice exams?\n\n73\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.540\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n74\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.980\nAll these exercises and practice exams and\n\n75\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.520\nother resources,\nvaluable resources are available for\n\n76\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.450\ndownload in the upper right hand corner\njust above me here, called show files.\n\n77\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.550\nPlease go there, there's a zip file there,\ndownload that zip, unzip the files, and\n\n78\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.530\nyou're gonna find a treasure trove of\nthings that are gonna help you prepare.\n\n79\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.950\nAnd be prepared to prepare.\n\n80\n00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.860\nJust sitting to these lectures\ncould be enough but I doubt it.\n\n81\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.650\nYou're certainly gonna have\nto practice the exam and\n\n82\n00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.480\nwork through some exercises\nto get ready for the exam.\n\n83\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.068\nSo, anticipate some homework on your own,\nright?\n\n84\n00:04:31.068 --> 00:04:32.450\nOkay.\n\n85\n00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.960\nA little background of ITIL.\n\n86\n00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.150\nIt's owned by a cabinet Office of\nGovernment Commerce in the United Kingdom.\n\n87\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.990\nIt first began in the mid 80s and\nit's kinda similar to our US Chamber\n\n88\n00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.110\nof Commerce where they would try to\nprovide best practice to support business.\n\n89\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.590\nWell, they came up with this\nidea that we need to describe\n\n90\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.590\nwhat this IT service management look like,\n\n91\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.760\nwhat does success look like in this\nidea of delivering IT services.\n\n92\n00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.860\nAnd since the 80s, it has evolved, it's\ngone through version upgrades, updates.\n\n93\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.270\nIt continues to be improved.\n\n94\n00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.140\nAs you can see,\nthe latest official upgrade was in 2011.\n\n95\n00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.560\nBut just last year, last spring of 2016,\n\n96\n00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.730\nthey published a new course\ncalled Practitioner.\n\n97\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.920\nWhich helps you answer the question,\nhow do I start adopting ITIL?\n\n98\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.260\nWhere should I begin?.\n\n99\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.390\nSo they continue to look out, they\ncontinue to look at the industry trends\n\n100\n00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.140\nand make adjustments to\nthe curriculum as necessary.\n\n101\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Terry does this certification has\nan expiration date or how does that work?\n\n102\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.900\n&gt;&gt; No longer it does,\nit no longer has an expiration date.\n\n103\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.825\nBetween version two and version three,\nthe accrediting agencies along with\n\n104\n00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:45.567\nthe blessing of the cabinet office\ndecided everyone need to upgrade their\n\n105\n00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:49.600\ncertifications so they deprecated\nthe old ones, says you have re-certify.\n\n106\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.670\nA lot of people got upset about that.\n\n107\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.650\nSo between version three in 2011.\n\n108\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.850\nNotice they didn't actually up version it,\nthey just gave it a date.\n\n109\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.660\nSo the 2011 update did not\ninclude a version upgrade,\n\n110\n00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.670\nthey didn't require people\nto reset the exams.\n\n111\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.080\nSo some of the things in fact\nplay out on a foundation exam.\n\n112\n00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.670\nIf you were to take\na version three 2007 exam,\n\n113\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.180\nyou would find the similar topics\nif you took one after 2011 as well.\n\n114\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, good to know.\n\n115\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.470\n&gt;&gt; Yep, all right, so you'll recall that\n\n116\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.695\nthe ITIL library consists of\nfive core publications, right?\n\n117\n00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:32.720\nService strategy, service design,\nservice transition, service operation and\n\n118\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.590\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n119\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.550\nThose five core publications\nhappen to correspond\n\n120\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.210\nwith ITIL's definition of the five\nstages in the lifecycle of a service\n\n121\n00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.530\nwith service strategy being\nthe earliest lifecycle stage.\n\n122\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.640\nSo our course material in\nservice offerings agreement is\n\n123\n00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.220\ngoing to be focusing on service\nstrategy and service design topics.\n\n124\n00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.270\nSo early in the lifecycle of a service\n\n125\n00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.505\nis what we are going to be focusing our\nattention on through out this course.\n\n126\n00:06:59.505 --> 00:07:04.680\nOkay, that doesn't mean that you should be\ntotally ignorant of service transitions,\n\n127\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.565\nservice operations and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n128\n00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:11.270\nAwareness of those\nare the stages is also important\n\n129\n00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.265\nto your success on the exam if\nonly at the superficial level,\n\n130\n00:07:14.265 --> 00:07:18.115\nyou'll still need to understand\nthose topics as well.\n\n131\n00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:22.960\nThat's why foundation is a prerequisite\nbecause any of the topics are fair game in\n\n132\n00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.600\nterms of how would you go about coming\nup with a successful strategy design so\n\n133\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.928\nthat it can be transitioned,\noperated and continually improved, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:31.928 --> 00:07:37.310\nAll right, so\nwhat's the qualification scheme look like?\n\n135\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.680\nFirst of all, accreditation.\n\n136\n00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.430\nThe official copyright owner of the\ncabinet office, they own the copyright.\n\n137\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:51.050\nThey allow Axelose to be\nthe ITIL accreditor which then\n\n138\n00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:57.430\nlicenses exam institutes to be\non the ground making exams.\n\n139\n00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:04.410\nManaging the logistics of exam\nadministration, exam creation, etc.\n\n140\n00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.880\nAnd then accredited training organization,\nsuch as PassionIT Group,\n\n141\n00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.710\nthey go through the rigors of being\naudited by the exam institution,\n\n142\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.060\nto make sure their course materials\nare aligned with the syllabus.\n\n143\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.870\nAnd accredited trainers,\nsuch as me, we have to go through\n\n144\n00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.520\nthe accreditation through those\naccredited training organizations.\n\n145\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.360\nSo, everyone is aligned\ntoward the same goals.\n\n146\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.960\n&gt;&gt; Now, looks like a pretty well\nrespected and industry wide standard for\n\n147\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.650\nthis particular certification?\n\n148\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:32.990\n&gt;&gt; It is, very well respected.\n\n149\n00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.730\nAnd ITIL itself has become the de facto\nbest practice around the world for\n\n150\n00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.710\nIT service management.\n\n151\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:45.625\nIt is well respected all over the world,\nokay.\n\n152\n00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:49.930\nNow here is somewhat of an example of\nthe course work that you could take at any\n\n153\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:50.705\ngiven time.\n\n154\n00:08:50.705 --> 00:08:55.222\nOf course we'd recommend that you\ntake the courses from ITProTV.\n\n155\n00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:57.730\nThey're all gonna be available\nat some point in time.\n\n156\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.010\nWe've focused a lot on foundation and\n\n157\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:06.160\nwe also have in the ITProTV library\nalready release control and validation.\n\n158\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.080\nWe're working now on this episode here\nof service offers and agreements.\n\n159\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.810\nWe have planning, protection, and\n\n160\n00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.840\noptimization already\nunder the hood as well.\n\n161\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.788\nPPO, OSA to follow.\n\n162\n00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:23.220\nSo of course as you can take here\nthey are without the abbreviations.\n\n163\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.309\nA little bit easier to see here.\n\n164\n00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.340\nIf you wanted to achieve\na certification as an ITIL expert\n\n165\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.980\nthat is one of the credentials they hold,\nthat they offer.\n\n166\n00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.050\nYou need to amass credits and\n\n167\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.680\nyou can take this credits by taking\nthese various courses, right.\n\n168\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.460\nFoundation is requirement,\nyou gotta have foundation.\n\n169\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.970\nEveryone has to have that one.\n\n170\n00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.380\nAnd then at the end you also have to\nhave Management Across the Lifecycle.\n\n171\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.130\nOtherwise known as MALC.\n\n172\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.670\nThat's the capstone course,\nthe one that says you have mastered\n\n173\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.660\nthis information well enough to apply\nit across all stages of the lifecycle.\n\n174\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.390\nIn between you can take\ncourses anyway you want.\n\n175\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.640\nYou can take Server Strategy And you\ncould take Service Offerings Agreements.\n\n176\n00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.070\nYou could mix and match the capability and\nlifecycle courses as you wish.\n\n177\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.540\nOnce you have 17 credits,\nyou get two for foundation.\n\n178\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.810\nA mass 15 credits among these courses for\na total of at least 17,\n\n179\n00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.940\nyou're then eligible to take\nThe Managing Across the Lifecycle exam.\n\n180\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.670\nPassing that one gives you five\nmore credits, for a total of 22,\n\n181\n00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.570\n22 credits gives you\nthe ITIL expert credential.\n\n182\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.240\n&gt;&gt; How many exams are we looking at,\nfor the whole shebang here?\n\n183\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.662\n&gt;&gt; The shortest path, exam-wise,\nwould be foundation one and\n\n184\n00:10:40.662 --> 00:10:43.950\nthen four capabilities plus MALC, five.\n\n185\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Five separate exams would be the total.\n\n186\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.670\nOf course you can mix and match.\n\n187\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.340\nYou can take more exams with shorter\ncourses, do it different bits.\n\n188\n00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.570\nDifferent ways to do that.\n\n189\n00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:00.390\nComing soon to ITProTV will be a path\nto managing across the life or\n\n190\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.290\na path to the experts is what we're\nfocusing on in our production\n\n191\n00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.290\nschedule is to give you\na path through capabilities.\n\n192\n00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:12.215\nThese four plus MALC and\nof course foundation.\n\n193\n00:11:12.215 --> 00:11:12.715\nOkay?\n\n194\n00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:17.670\nSo the exam is different.\n\n195\n00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.170\nIf you've had an intermediate\nexam then you get this already.\n\n196\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.990\nBut the exam is certainly\ndifferent in foundation.\n\n197\n00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:30.590\nYou called it a foundation exam was\n40 questions, one right answer right?\n\n198\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.420\nAnd you had to get at least\n26 of rank of 65%, right?\n\n199\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.820\nAnd that was just rote memorization,\nso the bar is not real, real high.\n\n200\n00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.223\nI'm not saying is not a challenging exam.\n\n201\n00:11:40.223 --> 00:11:44.444\nBut it's still rote memorization and\nunderstanding of the principles and\n\n202\n00:11:44.444 --> 00:11:47.220\nfoundational elements of ITIL.\n\n203\n00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.220\nThe reading level exams as we\nnoted before require you to\n\n204\n00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.090\nprovide some analysis of this\ninformation you've learned.\n\n205\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.900\nAnd there's not just one right answer.\n\n206\n00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.890\nThere's a best answer,\nwhich we'll give you five points.\n\n207\n00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.780\nThere's a next best answer which\nwill give you three points.\n\n208\n00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.800\nAnd then,as you go down the grade you\ncould also get a zero answer as well.\n\n209\n00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.570\nSo there's eight questions with the\npossibility of five points per question.\n\n210\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.030\nSo there's a possible total number of 40.\n\n211\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.150\nA perfect score would be 40\non intermediate level exams.\n\n212\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.030\nTo pass, you have to get 28.\n\n213\n00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.280\nYou get 90 minutes to take it, which is 30\nminutes more than you get on foundation.\n\n214\n00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.730\nThey are challenging in that,\nyou have to manage your time well.\n\n215\n00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.810\nThere's, lengthy scenarios at times.\n\n216\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.180\nThere might be a page long scenario.\n\n217\n00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.840\nThe questions themselves might span one or\ntwo pages, or one and a half pages.\n\n218\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.560\nSo, a bit more reading and analysis.\n\n219\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.880\nBut that's the nature of the beast, right?\n\n220\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.540\nIf you do the math on this,\nyou gotta get 28 out of 40.\n\n221\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.950\nSo if you were to get six three\npoint answers, that's 18,\n\n222\n00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:59.740\nplus two five point answers,\nthat would give you your 28, right?\n\n223\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.230\nSo perfection obviously\nis not mandatory here.\n\n224\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.170\nBut of course, if you were to pick\none zero answer, then of course\n\n225\n00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.420\nyou've raised the bar for having more\nperfect answers you have to find.\n\n226\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.770\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, are we allowed to mark\nanswers and then go back for review or\n\n227\n00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.600\nis it kind of a one and done situation?\n\n228\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.910\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely can go back and mark.\n\n229\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.260\nWhether you, as you take the exam online,\n\n230\n00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.299\nyou can start at question\neight instead of question one.\n\n231\n00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:25.590\nYou can go back to question one.\n\n232\n00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.095\nYou're not done until you click\nthat last little I'm finished.\n\n233\n00:13:28.095 --> 00:13:29.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds good.\n\n234\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.460\nIt's good to know because sometimes we're\ntalking about time management in the exam.\n\n235\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.920\nI'm setting some and\nit's always good to know ahead of time.\n\n236\n00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.865\n&gt;&gt; One of the things that is a bit\nchallenging for the online exam is if you\n\n237\n00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:43.554\nwere to take the exam on paper,\nyou can mark on the paper itself.\n\n238\n00:13:43.554 --> 00:13:47.220\nSo you gonna have to get creative\non the exam session because\n\n239\n00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.490\nis on the screen electronically of\nhow you are eliminating answers.\n\n240\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.499\nAre taking notes and\neliminating which you can.\n\n241\n00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.574\nYou can take notes on paper\nwhile you're taking exam but\n\n242\n00:13:56.574 --> 00:14:00.750\nyou won't have that facility of\nmarking on the exam paper itself.\n\n243\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.762\nThat's the only difference, all right?\n\n244\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:08.578\nSpeaking of the exam,\nthe full instructions for\n\n245\n00:14:08.578 --> 00:14:13.710\nhow to get the exam scheduled\nare available in the download, right?\n\n246\n00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.340\nYou're gonna get this exam\nfrom PassionIT Group.\n\n247\n00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.550\nThey can broker the sale of that exam and\nyou will take online, right?\n\n248\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.950\nProbably is the best way to approach that,\nyou can get your proctor one, but\n\n249\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:30.550\nthose cost more etc, okay.\n\n250\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.520\nSo, don't forget comes\nexam time reach out,\n\n251\n00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.930\nif you have questions reach out\nto me at deckerheads@yahoo.com,\n\n252\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:44.883\nthrough the forum at ITProTV, or\ncheck out the website PassionITGroup.com.\n\n253\n00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:48.450\nAll right, that's a wrap for\nthe basic logistics of this.\n\n254\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:53.645\nUp next is going to be a review\nof some foundational principles.\n\n255\n00:14:53.645 --> 00:14:55.070\n&gt;&gt; Terry, thank you for\ncoming in today and\n\n256\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.040\ngiving us at least a good foundation\nof where we should begin here.\n\n257\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.410\nBut ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n258\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.850\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n259\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.900\nRemember I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n260\n00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:06.730\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.092 --> 00:00:15.850\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL Service Offerings\nand Agreements series.\n\n4\n00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.010\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.060\nIn this episode, we'll really\nbe going back in looking at that\n\n6\n00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.990\nfoundation certification, and\nkind of just give a refresher.\n\n7\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.610\nAnd with us today back in studios we have\nMr. Terry Decker to help us with that.\n\n8\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.908\nThanks for joining us Terry.\n\n9\n00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:33.120\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here Cherokee as always.\n\n10\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.368\nAs she mentioned, we gotta knock the rust\noff some of those foundation information.\n\n11\n00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:41.360\nWe gotta get back into the habit of using\nITIL language, the words are important.\n\n12\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.080\nThese words are gonna be used on the exam.\n\n13\n00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.160\nSo you need to recognize\nthem in the ITIL sense,\n\n14\n00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.510\nnot necessarily in the everyday sense\nthat you might be accustomed to.\n\n15\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.680\nSo we're gonna knock that rust off.\n\n16\n00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.260\nAnd one of these words or very important\nconcepts is the idea of a lifecycle,\n\n17\n00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.860\nparticularly the service lifecycle.\n\n18\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.830\nSo, what does lifecycle mean to you?\n\n19\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.550\n&gt;&gt; Terry, if I had to really define it,\n\n20\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.046\nI guess I would say something with\na definite beginning and end.\n\n21\n00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:10.140\n&gt;&gt; Make sense, project lifecycle.\n\n22\n00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's where I'm pulling from.\n\n23\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.770\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, a project has a lifecycle,\nbeginning and an end.\n\n24\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.320\nA car has a lifecycle, from concept\nstage through design, maybe a prototype.\n\n25\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.549\nEventually in a manufacturing it's sold,\nit's operated.\n\n26\n00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.280\nSo, you can imagine almost anything.\n\n27\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.680\nAn employee has a lifecycle,\nemployment lifecycle, from hire to retire,\n\n28\n00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.520\nor perhaps from hire to fire.\n\n29\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.840\nMaybe somewhere in the, and\nall the points in between.\n\n30\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.149\nSo that's really what a cycle is,\nwhen something starts, and\n\n31\n00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.030\neventually gets ended or retired.\n\n32\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.913\nSo, ITIL certainly is focused on\nthe lifecycle of a service an IT service.\n\n33\n00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:58.430\nThe ITIL librarians have\ngone through the trouble\n\n34\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.880\nof dividing this life\ncycle into five stages.\n\n35\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.890\nAnd those stages as you can see here, and\n\n36\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.550\nremember from your foundation course,\nservice strategy, service design,\n\n37\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.330\nservice transition, service operations and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n38\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.030\nThese five stages form the life\ncycle with service strategy and\n\n39\n00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.450\nservice design being earlier than\ntransition operation against CSI.\n\n40\n00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.850\nSo in chronological order,\nservice strategy happens before design.\n\n41\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.592\nI think we need to remember that this\ncourse is focused on strategy and\n\n42\n00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:36.555\ndesign topics.\n\n43\n00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:37.375\nSo therefore,\n\n44\n00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:41.885\nwe're gonna be focusing on the early\nstages on the lifecycle of a service.\n\n45\n00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:46.615\nWhich might be foreign to a lot of\nstudents that deal more with operational\n\n46\n00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:49.695\nissues or\ntransitional issues on a day-to-day basis.\n\n47\n00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:51.745\nSo, get ready for that kind of learning.\n\n48\n00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:56.380\nWe're gonna be focused on the early\nstages in a lifecycle of a service.\n\n49\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.150\nAnd the early process definitions\nin the lifecycle of a service.\n\n50\n00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:09.600\nYou'll see here the processes across\nthe various lifecycle stages.\n\n51\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.270\nThese were almost entirely,\n\n52\n00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.410\nthere was four processes that were\nnot in scope of foundation course.\n\n53\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.690\nBut there's 26 processes defined by ITIL.\n\n54\n00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.700\nThey're all listed here as a broken\ndown by each of the stages.\n\n55\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.410\nThe ones that are different color,\nthe ones in blue and\n\n56\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.780\nbold, are the ones we're gonna\nbe talking about in this show.\n\n57\n00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.970\nService portfolio management,\ndemand management.\n\n58\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.810\nYou'll see financial management,\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n59\n00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.210\nThey actually come from\nthe service strategy book.\n\n60\n00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.781\nWe're gonna talk about catalog management,\nservice level management,\n\n61\n00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:45.540\nand supplier management, which those\nthree come from the service design book.\n\n62\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.380\nThey put them together because they're\nintricately related to each other\n\n63\n00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.470\nin this topic called Service Offerings and\nAgreements.\n\n64\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.490\nSo service offerings is particularly\nin the remit of service strategy,\n\n65\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.900\nthe agreement side of the business is\nparticularly in the design aspects of it.\n\n66\n00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.980\nSo that's what we're gonna be focusing\non primarily throughout this course.\n\n67\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.180\nWe're also gonna have a necessary\nlook at strategy manage for\n\n68\n00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.890\nIT services and design coordination.\n\n69\n00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.926\nAs you'll see at the bottom of Service\nDesign there's Design Coordination, and\n\n70\n00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:17.513\nat the top of Service Strategy.\n\n71\n00:04:17.513 --> 00:04:21.528\nWe're gonna have a brief look at those\nas well because in describing those\n\n72\n00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:25.221\nprocesses, we'll also gonna describe\nthe overall chain value and\n\n73\n00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:29.063\noutput from these two stages,\nservice strategy and service design.\n\n74\n00:04:34.514 --> 00:04:35.920\nSo what is a service?\n\n75\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.660\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps a service is\nsome kind of management\n\n76\n00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.250\nthat an IT department would offer.\n\n77\n00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.280\nWhere as we spoke about life cycle,\nthat may be something that has that\n\n78\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.400\nbeginning and end and that I'm complete,\na service could be ongoing.\n\n79\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.650\nAnd again that's just my project\nmanagement background, coming in here.\n\n80\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.200\n&gt;&gt; I like it, it's pretty good.\n\n81\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.880\nOne way to distinguish Windows driver\nservice is to distinguish what it's not or\n\n82\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.590\nwhat it goes beyond.\n\n83\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.530\nA service is certainly\ndifferent than a solution.\n\n84\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.740\nPerhaps you've been involved in\nrelationships where the solution was\n\n85\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.360\ndelivered, and it was up to you to figure\nout how to use it, a box was dropped.\n\n86\n00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.170\n&gt;&gt; If we had hired an external consultant.\n\n87\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, maybe an expert consultant.\n\n88\n00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.970\nThey come in, they make a bunch of noise,\nand fly away, right?\n\n89\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.700\nSeagull management,\nI believe that's called.\n\n90\n00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.745\nMake a bunch of noise,\nleave a big mess, and then fly away.\n\n91\n00:05:30.745 --> 00:05:36.100\n[LAUGH] A service is much\nmore than a solution.\n\n92\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.300\nIt's not just dropping a box and\nsaying here figure it out.\n\n93\n00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.880\nOr, here's a training manual,\nhave a nice day, and then walking away.\n\n94\n00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.779\nA service is a lot more\nholistic in delivery.\n\n95\n00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:52.070\nIt needs to consider lots of interfaces\nwith humans as well as with technology.\n\n96\n00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.945\nIt needs to consider processes,\nit needs to consider measurements.\n\n97\n00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:58.030\nWe'll remind you of those details.\n\n98\n00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.726\nYou certainly learned this\nin the foundation course\n\n99\n00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:05.763\nthat a service is a lot more\ncomplicated than a solution.\n\n100\n00:06:05.763 --> 00:06:11.780\nAnd ITIL is focused on service delivery\nand the lifecycle of a service.\n\n101\n00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.270\nThe rote memorization here,\nwhat is a service?\n\n102\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.100\nA means of delivering value\nto customers by facilitating\n\n103\n00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.310\noutcomes that they want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific cost and risk.\n\n104\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.490\nThe IT service provider is\nproviding value to customers.\n\n105\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.180\nI remember,\nas I teach the foundation course,\n\n106\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.750\nI remind students of the nine-tenths rule,\nvalue, customers and service.\n\n107\n00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.780\nThose three words can serve you\nwell on the exam, in any exam.\n\n108\n00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.150\nCertainly, on the foundation\nthat are even plays through on\n\n109\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.050\nthe intermediate level exam as well.\n\n110\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.940\nWhat I mean by that, the nine-tenths rule,\nis that if you have four choices of\n\n111\n00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.800\nquestions, and\none of them has a focus on value,\n\n112\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.280\nexplicitly, and the other three don't,\nchances are the one that explicitly\n\n113\n00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.910\nexpresses value in the answer is gonna\nbe more correct than the other three.\n\n114\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.820\nChances are, nine times out of ten.\n\n115\n00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.820\nThe same thing with the word customers.\n\n116\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:18.010\nIf you have an answer that clearly\nincludes the customer's considerations,\n\n117\n00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.660\neither directly or\nexplicitly or even indirectly.\n\n118\n00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.140\nYou've gotten the requirements or\nyou've gotten their feedback or approvals.\n\n119\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.458\nIf the customer is a item of focus in one\nof the answers, and is not an item focus\n\n120\n00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:35.100\nof the other ones, chances are it's\ngonna be the more correct answer.\n\n121\n00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.300\nAnd of course service is\nalso one of those key words.\n\n122\n00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.900\nAn IT provider needs to provide service\nnot just solutions, not just technology.\n\n123\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.880\nThey need to kind of wrap\nit all with governance,\n\n124\n00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.287\npolicies, and effective processes.\n\n125\n00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:54.258\nSo delivering the right value to the right\ncustomers is really what this ITIL whole\n\n126\n00:07:54.258 --> 00:07:55.277\nthing is about.\n\n127\n00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:55.931\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n128\n00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:57.167\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n129\n00:07:57.167 --> 00:08:00.328\nAll right, so what is service management?\n\n130\n00:08:00.328 --> 00:08:02.200\nAgain, a rote memorization thing.\n\n131\n00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.760\nService management is effectively\nthe capability to deliver value\n\n132\n00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.190\nthrough services, right?\n\n133\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.110\nYou have appropriate praxis in place.\n\n134\n00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.820\nYou have knowledge in place,\nthe right skills.\n\n135\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.290\nAnd you're transforming this idea\nof well we just provide Internet,\n\n136\n00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.840\nthat's what we do.\n\n137\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.340\nWe provide services along with Internet.\n\n138\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.690\nWe make sure it's available on time,\non budget, etc.\n\n139\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.144\n&gt;&gt; We're seeing a lot of that\nwith our Cloud types of services,\n\n140\n00:08:29.144 --> 00:08:31.865\nsoftware as a service,\nplatform as a service.\n\n141\n00:08:31.865 --> 00:08:32.442\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n142\n00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:34.017\n&gt;&gt; So pretty popular nowadays.\n\n143\n00:08:34.017 --> 00:08:41.700\n&gt;&gt; You can even see trends,\nI mean IBM was once a box dropper.\n\n144\n00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.635\nThey provided equipment and\nthey dropped it.\n\n145\n00:08:44.635 --> 00:08:47.855\nAnd they did help with\nimplementation services, right,\n\n146\n00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:51.890\nmain frames back in the day,\nstill mid-range computers.\n\n147\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.985\nDesktop computers, they're primarily\nnow a service organization.\n\n148\n00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:59.375\nThey've completely transformed their\nbusiness model to be a service\n\n149\n00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:00.183\norganization.\n\n150\n00:09:00.183 --> 00:09:02.334\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, it's like we've had to\nevolve over the years in order to\n\n151\n00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:02.950\nmeet that demand.\n\n152\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.660\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n153\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.540\nOrganizations need IT.\n\n154\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.910\nThey need boxes dropped.\n\n155\n00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.590\nThey certainly do, but\nthey also need IT services.\n\n156\n00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.130\nThey need help to make\nsure this all works and\n\n157\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:18.180\nworks well on time and allows them\nto achieve their business outcomes.\n\n158\n00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.510\nAgain, the example of\nbeing a geophysicist.\n\n159\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.250\nIf you're a geophysicist working for\n\n160\n00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.540\nan oil company you don't\nneed to be an IT expert.\n\n161\n00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.720\nTo work in the IT department of that\nsame oil company you don't need to be\n\n162\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.460\na geophysicist, right?\n\n163\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.240\nBringing these two together, so\nthat IT can provide the right services\n\n164\n00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.870\nto a geophysicist is where\nIT brings service and\n\n165\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.241\nbrings value to those types of customers,\nas an example, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:52.020\nAll right, so making sure that you have\ngood relationships between the service\n\n167\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.110\nprovider and the customer is what service\nmanagement is trying to accomplish.\n\n168\n00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.530\nNow we'll talk a little bit later\nabout a specific process called\n\n169\n00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.550\nBusiness Relationship Management, you're\nintroduced to it in the foundation course\n\n170\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.450\nbut BRM, Business Relationship Management\nis the process\n\n171\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.680\nthat oversees this relationship ongoing.\n\n172\n00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.040\nService management, holistically,\nis the capability to do this well and\n\n173\n00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.590\nmake sure you're living the right services\nat the acceptable level at the right cost.\n\n174\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.090\nAnd you can't know that unless you have\na good relationship with the customers.\n\n175\n00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.450\n&gt;&gt; And your customer can be\ndefined in several different ways,\n\n176\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.590\ndepending on how you're\nreally defining it.\n\n177\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.000\nYour customer being your employees,\nyour co-workers, a contractor,\n\n178\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.130\nyour client whomever?\n\n179\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.266\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n180\n00:10:35.266 --> 00:10:40.680\nhaving a customer focused mentality is\ndifferent than a box dropping mentality.\n\n181\n00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.640\nIt just really is.\n\n182\n00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.310\n&gt;&gt; Being there to support them.\n\n183\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.420\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nthat's a very good segue, Cherokee,\n\n184\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.350\nto what we're talking about,\ndifferent types of service providers.\n\n185\n00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.310\nYou can kind of flip the script,\n\n186\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.620\nyou're talking about different\ntypes of customers, or\n\n187\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.260\ndifferent types of service providers.\n\n188\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.200\nInternal service provider is a service\nprovider that's embedded within\n\n189\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.490\na business unit.\n\n190\n00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:05.260\nThey are really right their understanding\ndepth to fit their business units needs.\n\n191\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.940\nNow a shared services unit is in contrast,\n\n192\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.050\nis also within the same organization but\nprovides centralized services.\n\n193\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.030\nSo I'll give you an example of scale here.\n\n194\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.060\nI used to work for\nan organization that had an R and\n\n195\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.460\nD department, a manufacturing department,\na sales department.\n\n196\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.990\nThese were each business units.\n\n197\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.870\nThere were IT functions under\neach one of those business units.\n\n198\n00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:32.200\nSo there was an R and D IT,\na manufacturing IT, a sales IT.\n\n199\n00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.380\nThey understood the particular needs,\nthose IT service providers,\n\n200\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.820\nunderstood the particular needs of\nthose particular business units.\n\n201\n00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.750\nI worked in centralized shared services.\n\n202\n00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.830\nI provided email.\n\n203\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.450\nAll of them used it.\n\n204\n00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.750\nInternet portal, enterprise search,\nlearning management,\n\n205\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:53.020\ndocument management, things that\nwe consume by every business unit.\n\n206\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.390\nAlso, within the same company.\n\n207\n00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.860\nSo internal and\nshared are within the same organization.\n\n208\n00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:04.000\nAn external service provider is\noutside right, you're providing\n\n209\n00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.070\nIT services to someone that doesn't\nwork for the same company as you do.\n\n210\n00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let me just kind\nof get this straight here Terry.\n\n211\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So for example would it be correct if I\n\n212\n00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.800\nsaid type 1, might be maybe I'm\na hardware technician and I'm servicing\n\n213\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.710\nan entire site for my organization\n&gt;&gt; Could be.\n\n214\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.870\n&gt;&gt; If they had multiple locations and\nI was just focused on one site.\n\n215\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely it could be,\nthat's a good example.\n\n216\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.110\nAgain, organizational structure's\ngonna try to drive this actually.\n\n217\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.520\nSo what type of provider you are is\nreally gonna be driven by your\n\n218\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.900\norganizational structure.\n\n219\n00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.810\nAnd geography could be one of the ways\nto divide and conquer that structure.\n\n220\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:38.560\nSo absolutely.\n\n221\n00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.670\n&gt;&gt; And then maybe if type III that\nwould be if I was siting as a help desk\n\n222\n00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.552\ntechnician servicing external customers\nlike our clients calling in for help.\n\n223\n00:12:46.552 --> 00:12:47.335\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n224\n00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:47.970\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n225\n00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.580\n&gt;&gt; If you look at ITPro TV,\nyou are an external service provider.\n\n226\n00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.660\nPredominantly, right?\n\n227\n00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You provide services to folks like\n\n228\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.770\nDavid and others that use your\nservices externally, right?\n\n229\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.500\nYou do so for profit, right?\n\n230\n00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.290\nYou could also be a nonprofit and\ndo extra, be an external service provider.\n\n231\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:15.690\nAny given IT organization,\neven ITProTV has internal IT functions.\n\n232\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.931\n&gt;&gt; We sure do, [LAUGH].\n\n233\n00:13:16.931 --> 00:13:17.499\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n234\n00:13:17.499 --> 00:13:21.490\nany given organization could have all\nthree things going on the same way.\n\n235\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.090\nConsider a bank as an example.\n\n236\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.270\nA bank can certainly have\nthe consumer loan department with\n\n237\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:32.260\nvery specific IT services that\nsupport consumer loans versus-\n\n238\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.030\n&gt;&gt; And surrounding that particular realm.\n\n239\n00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Exactly as oppsed to teller machine and\nteller services, right?\n\n240\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Then they also provide media ability as\n\n241\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.140\nan external customer to take\na picture of my check and deposit it.\n\n242\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could have no clue how to fix\nan ATM, but the other technician may.\n\n243\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so you get the idea.\n\n244\n00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:57.700\nThis is an important point to make, while\nITIL has distinguished type I, type II,\n\n245\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:03.610\nand type III, it's actually a distinction\nwithout a difference, in a way.\n\n246\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:09.860\nThe principles of ITIL and the techniques\nand the tricks and the processes and\n\n247\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.740\nall the things we're talking about\napply to all three types of providers.\n\n248\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.040\nSo it's an important distinction.\n\n249\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.850\nI agree with that, but it's also just\nas important to realize that these\n\n250\n00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.960\nprinciples apply equally\nto all three types, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.320\nAll right, now, who are stakeholders\nin service management?\n\n252\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.830\nThe IT provider, of course they are.\n\n253\n00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.720\nThe service provider\nthemselves are stakeholders.\n\n254\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.370\nYou may have heard the phrase,\n\n255\n00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:40.080\nthe cobbler's kids have no shoes,\nthe shoemaker's kids have no shoes.\n\n256\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.760\nThey're so busy serving other people\nthat don't take care of themselves.\n\n257\n00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.060\nWell, ITIL certainly recognizes\nthat as a stakeholder,\n\n258\n00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.160\nthe IT certifier themselves\nneed to be tended to, right?\n\n259\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.070\nSo as you consider the processes and\nas we continue our exploration of these\n\n260\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.105\nprinciples, keep in mind that you're\ntrying to serve certainly customers,\n\n261\n00:14:59.105 --> 00:15:01.600\nthey're the big ones you\nneed to take care of.\n\n262\n00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.520\nBut you gotta take care of\nyourself too along the way.\n\n263\n00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.920\nThe prior stakeholders are functions,\ngroups, and teams.\n\n264\n00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.250\nThose are the internal\ngroups that you have.\n\n265\n00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:17.890\nCustomers, of course, can be internal or\nexternal, as Cherokee pointed out earlier.\n\n266\n00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.280\nThat's just kinda flipping the script.\n\n267\n00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.480\nYou got a internal service provider,\nan external service provider.\n\n268\n00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.140\nWe'll just turn it around from\nthe customer perspective.\n\n269\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.010\nYou can have internal customers or\nexternal customers, right?\n\n270\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.345\nAnd of course,\nsuppliers is another stakeholder.\n\n271\n00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:35.970\nIt's hard for me to imagine an IT service\nprovider that doesn't somehow rely\n\n272\n00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:41.440\non a supplier, whether it be for\nhardware, software or for services.\n\n273\n00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.990\nCertainly, ITProTV is relying\non an Internet service provider.\n\n274\n00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.170\n&gt;&gt; Sure, it's hard to think of\nan organization that doesn't use\n\n275\n00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.010\nthe Internet today.\n\n276\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.786\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n277\n00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:52.693\nSo whether we're getting services or\nhardware or\n\n278\n00:15:52.693 --> 00:15:56.994\nsoftware from an external source,\nthat supplier is also a stakeholder.\n\n279\n00:15:56.994 --> 00:16:00.950\nIt's also important to remember the\ndifference between a customer and a user.\n\n280\n00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.310\nThey're not necessarily the same.\n\n281\n00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.440\nAs an example, from my own background,\nwe provided a learning management service.\n\n282\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.350\nAnd a learning management system along\nwith services surrounding that system.\n\n283\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.870\nThe HR division was the customer.\n\n284\n00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.240\nThey were the sponsor,\nthey're the ones that got the budget\n\n285\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.950\nthat determined how we're supposed\nto build it to what specifications.\n\n286\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.010\nAnd they of course they managed their\nstakeholders in all the different\n\n287\n00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.620\ndepartments right?\n\n288\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.640\nBut our primary customer\nwere business stakeholders.\n\n289\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:36.290\nRight?\n\n290\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.390\nThey had budget, they had power, right?\n\n291\n00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.390\nAnd they determined ultimately,\nhow much money was gonna be spent\n\n292\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.060\ndeveloping this learning\nmanagement service.\n\n293\n00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.160\nThe users was everyone in the company,\neveryone, that weren't there at the table\n\n294\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.370\nwhen we were designing this or\ndesigning that necessarily.\n\n295\n00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:56.452\nObviously, if you leave users out of your\nconsideration as a stakeholder You could\n\n296\n00:16:56.452 --> 00:16:58.038\nlose on the value proposition.\n\n297\n00:16:58.038 --> 00:17:02.007\nYou might not deliver the right thing,\nright, so customers are a stakeholder\n\n298\n00:17:02.007 --> 00:17:06.336\nthat's providing the money, users are the\nstakeholders that are gonna be using it,\n\n299\n00:17:06.336 --> 00:17:08.910\nthey are not necessarily the same group.\n\n300\n00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.640\nSo as an IT service provider,\nyou must be aware of that difference and\n\n301\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.820\nmanage those stakeholders appropriately.\n\n302\n00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.680\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting.\n\n303\n00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.460\nAnd I know this isn't a project\nmanagement certification,\n\n304\n00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.580\nbut getting those different perspectives.\n\n305\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.200\nLike you think of terms VOC,\nvoice to customer.\n\n306\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.740\nAnd kind of understanding\nthe needs of those individuals\n\n307\n00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.760\ndepending on if they're the users or\nthe suppliers or the customer.\n\n308\n00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.920\nAnd just kind of getting\ndifferent perspective.\n\n309\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.850\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and\n\n310\n00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.750\ndoesn't that play in, that same analogy\nplay in when you consider risk assessment?\n\n311\n00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.580\nBecause they all have different\nperspectives on what is risk.\n\n312\n00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.310\nWhat's gonna be satisfying,\nwhat's gonna be not.\n\n313\n00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.830\nSo, if you fail to satisfy a customer,\nyou're in trouble, clearly, right?\n\n314\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.800\nIf you fail to satisfy a user,\nyou could be in trouble as well.\n\n315\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.390\nSo, you gotta consider both.\n\n316\n00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:56.460\nAnd if you don't bring suppliers\nalong on this journey effectively\n\n317\n00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.490\nyou could also lose.\n\n318\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.910\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry so what you're saying\nis we have to keep everyone happy.\n\n319\n00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:01.875\n&gt;&gt; Yes, of course.\n\n320\n00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:03.970\n[LAUGH] That's what I-\n&gt;&gt; What an easy job that is.\n\n321\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.940\n&gt;&gt; Exactly that's all\nyou have to do [LAUGH].\n\n322\n00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.980\nI will remind you though test\ntakers that is, test takers.\n\n323\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.810\nThat all these stakeholders\nneed to be in play.\n\n324\n00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:17.290\nSo understanding and\nremembering the four stakeholders is good.\n\n325\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.470\nSo if you get a question\nthat is talking about\n\n326\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.300\nwho you should invite to the meeting.\n\n327\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.960\nAnd you see that users aren't really\nmeaningfully well represented,\n\n328\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.810\nthen that's gonna be your best answer,\nright?\n\n329\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.470\nYou need to make sure that the user\nperspective is also considered or\n\n330\n00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.460\nif any of the stakeholder\ngroups is missing.\n\n331\n00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.110\nGet the right people and be inclusive.\n\n332\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.860\nThat's right, okay.\n\n333\n00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.860\nOkay, so what about these internal and\nexternal services, right?\n\n334\n00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:48.000\nAnother way to break them down, you'll\nsee support services, internal services,\n\n335\n00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.090\nexternal services,\nit's just who the customers are, right?\n\n336\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.050\nSupport services are kinda\nbehind the scenes.\n\n337\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:00.780\nWe'll look a little bit later,\nat a graph that shows core enabling and\n\n338\n00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.020\nenhancing services,\nthat gives us a better graphic of that.\n\n339\n00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.690\nBut support services tend\nto be in the back end.\n\n340\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.990\nThey're not directly consumed by\nthe business or by the customers.\n\n341\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.450\nAs an example email.\n\n342\n00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.520\nUsers and\n\n343\n00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.520\ncustomers use email, they'll get perhaps\nthey'll get to their Outlook client.\n\n344\n00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.970\nThey'll send email.\n\n345\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.770\nThey think email when they think service.\n\n346\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:28.150\nThey don't think server, database,\nnetwork, identity management.\n\n347\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.600\nThey don't think about those things,\nthey think about email.\n\n348\n00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:37.940\nCustomer facing services are part of that\nsupporting services in the back, right?\n\n349\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.770\nExternal services obviously providing to\nexternal customers whether they are paying\n\n350\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.670\ncustomers or non-paying customers.\n\n351\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.840\n&gt;&gt; Maybe like web server.\n\n352\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:52.140\nIf you have like a retail site and you\nhave a catalog that needs to be perused.\n\n353\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n354\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.170\nGood example.\n\n355\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.070\nThose various things in a web service.\n\n356\n00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.680\nIf you go to Amazon.com think about\nall the services in the back end\n\n357\n00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.354\nconnecting to the shipping services.\n\n358\n00:20:03.354 --> 00:20:04.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Connecting to the payment\n\n359\n00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:05.750\nservices, right?\n\n360\n00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.240\nAnd as you mentioned\nCherokee the catalog itself.\n\n361\n00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.500\nWhat can I buy?\n\n362\n00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.580\nRight, very good.\n\n363\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.680\nSo here is as I promised.\n\n364\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.230\nThis core enabling an enhancing services.\n\n365\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.030\nIf you look at emails in\nexample as an IT service.\n\n366\n00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.950\nYou got unique mailboxes.\n\n367\n00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.390\nThe core services.\n\n368\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.340\nEveryone gets their own mailbox.\n\n369\n00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.470\nI don't share a mailbox with Cherokee.\n\n370\n00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.240\nI get my own email.\n\n371\n00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.240\nI can send and receive email and\n\n372\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.930\nI also have the nice trick to be\nable to integrate with my calendar.\n\n373\n00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.410\nI can send Cherokee an invitation and\nshe could accept it.\n\n374\n00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.160\nIt shows up on my calendar.\n\n375\n00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.180\nCute, I like it.\n\n376\n00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.710\nNow, enabling service are those\nthings in the backend.\n\n377\n00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.330\nA server is helping that work.\n\n378\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.540\nA network is making that happen.\n\n379\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.390\nIdentity management.\n\n380\n00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.600\nSo I log in, they know it's me.\n\n381\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.140\nI get my mailbox, Cherokee gets hers.\n\n382\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.420\nSo those things happening in\nthe backend are important services.\n\n383\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.420\nAll right.\n\n384\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.000\nCore services are there\neveryone getting him and\n\n385\n00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.260\nconsuming them enabling services\nare being consumed but in from the back.\n\n386\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.295\nAll right, and enhancing services\nare those things that not everyone gets.\n\n387\n00:21:11.295 --> 00:21:17.930\nRight, may be in this example you get\na searchable email archive right?\n\n388\n00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:23.280\nSo that email is appropriately archived,\nfor auditing purposes, to satisfy\n\n389\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.670\nfederal regulations for finance or\nFDA or whatever it might be, right?\n\n390\n00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.060\nOr maybe mobile message.\n\n391\n00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.130\nI remember when we first Years ago,\n\n392\n00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.720\nwent from Lotus Notes to\nan Exchange environment.\n\n393\n00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.430\nWe weren't going to just open\nthe gates for mobile messaging.\n\n394\n00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.400\nNot everyone was gonna be able\nto get email to their phones.\n\n395\n00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.060\nWe weren't sure about security model,\nback then.\n\n396\n00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.660\nSo we had a limited test of it,\namong the sales group.\n\n397\n00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.800\nThey all had BlackBerrys.\n\n398\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.530\nWe could control the security piece.\n\n399\n00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.920\nAnd as we figured out all those\nparameters, that enhancing service of\n\n400\n00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.210\nmobile messaging became something\nwe offered as a core service.\n\n401\n00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.440\nEveryone else could get it, right,\nat some point, but not at first, right?\n\n402\n00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.080\nIntegration with web meetings, various\nthings could be enhancing services,\n\n403\n00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.250\nthat witness server be part\nof everyday offerings.\n\n404\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.320\n&gt;&gt; So it sounds like once you go ahead and\ndefine these components it's not a one and\n\n405\n00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.850\ndone situation they may\nevolve into something else?\n\n406\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.550\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and it's a common\nthing that, it's pretty common.\n\n407\n00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.330\nIt's never static, and\n\n408\n00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.190\nI think that's probably true about all the\nlife cycle IT service it's always moving,\n\n409\n00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:29.020\nthe business is moving, the services\nare moving, the technology is moving.\n\n410\n00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.660\nSo I mean years ago,\nwe weren't thinking about cloud computing,\n\n411\n00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.910\nwe weren't thinking about\nsoftware as a service, right.\n\n412\n00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.460\nServer visualization is\na relatively new thing, right?\n\n413\n00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.650\nWe can go on back even further.\n\n414\n00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.600\nMain frame to client server\nwas a transformational thing.\n\n415\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.400\nRight, so again it's never static.\n\n416\n00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.230\nSo understanding your service methodology.\n\n417\n00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.880\nAnd I again, I appreciate ITIL\ndistinguishing core enabling and\n\n418\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.240\nan enhancing services.\n\n419\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.880\nIt's an important distinction.\n\n420\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:03.720\nAnd just it is was with internal shared\nand external, an important distinction\n\n421\n00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.660\nof what type of service providers you\nhave, these are important distinctions for\n\n422\n00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.830\nthe types of services you have,\ncore, enabling, enhancing.\n\n423\n00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.660\nBut again, these are distinctions\nwithout a difference\n\n424\n00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.855\nwhen it comes to the principles of ITIL.\n\n425\n00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:21.790\nIf you're maintaining or you're operating\nan enhancing service, sure you have\n\n426\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.050\na little bit different nuance, but\nyou still have to provide values.\n\n427\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.750\nYou still have to have governance.\n\n428\n00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.590\nYou still have to have the appropriate\nstrategies in place for\n\n429\n00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.970\nwhen it's going to become a core or\nwhen it's not.\n\n430\n00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.414\nSo, this are distinction\nwithout a difference, okay.\n\n431\n00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:36.540\nAll right.\n\n432\n00:23:39.703 --> 00:23:41.918\nAgain the vocabulary is important,\n\n433\n00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:45.925\nlooking at from the customer\nperspective what is value look like.\n\n434\n00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:50.696\nYou recall this graphic almost identical\ngraphic from the foundation of\n\n435\n00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:53.443\ncourse perhaps, utility and warranty.\n\n436\n00:23:53.443 --> 00:23:58.045\nTo be able to provide value, you must\nbe able to provide both, utility and\n\n437\n00:23:58.045 --> 00:23:58.800\nwarranty.\n\n438\n00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.100\nUtility means it has\nthe right functionality.\n\n439\n00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.270\nWarranty means it's there when\nit's supposed to be there,\n\n440\n00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.360\nperforming like it's supposed to.\n\n441\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:15.310\nYou have to provide both, and you'll see\nthe AND gate down the lower right there.\n\n442\n00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:20.320\nBoth utility and warranty need to be\nprovided to be able to provide the value.\n\n443\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.210\nSo, let's consider this.\n\n444\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:28.010\nIs it possible to have, let's say an\napplication that is got all the bells and\n\n445\n00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:33.007\nwhistles, it's intuitive to use,\nit's got the nice work flow,\n\n446\n00:24:33.007 --> 00:24:36.470\nit's easy, but it falls down every day?\n\n447\n00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:40.745\nIt doesn't stay up,\nit clunky, it crashes, right?\n\n448\n00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:43.240\nSo you can see the utility's there,\nbut the warranty's not.\n\n449\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:49.124\nIs it possible to have a highly available\npiece of software that's just kinda,\n\n450\n00:24:49.124 --> 00:24:50.430\neh, icky?\n\n451\n00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.370\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Does it really execute or\ndo what you want it to do [LAUGH]?\n\n452\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.001\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, counter-intuitive.\n\n453\n00:24:54.001 --> 00:24:54.970\n&gt;&gt; But it's always there, Terry.\n\n454\n00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.130\n&gt;&gt; But it's always there, right.\n\n455\n00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.740\nProbably because no one's using it, right?\n\n456\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.000\nBut, you see.\n\n457\n00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.620\nSo, I mean, that's really a humorous\nway to describe why both are important.\n\n458\n00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:09.270\nAs an IT service provider, you need\nto provide both utility and warranty.\n\n459\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.160\nNow, again, vocabulary is important.\n\n460\n00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.930\nSo they're just gonna use these words,\nperhaps.\n\n461\n00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:17.440\nThey may say, the customer is quite happy\nwith the warranty of the service, but\n\n462\n00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.509\nis not pleased with utility.\n\n463\n00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.166\nSo who do you invite to that meeting?\n\n464\n00:25:21.166 --> 00:25:25.786\nSo knowing the difference between utility\nand warranty is going to be important for\n\n465\n00:25:25.786 --> 00:25:26.711\nyou to analyze.\n\n466\n00:25:26.711 --> 00:25:31.797\nRemember, that's what we're trying to\ndo on this exam is provide analysis,\n\n467\n00:25:31.797 --> 00:25:35.186\nto analyze what we should do,\nwho should we invite,\n\n468\n00:25:35.186 --> 00:25:40.090\nwho should be there at the meeting\nto help us with that, or vice versa.\n\n469\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.070\nUtility is really good.\n\n470\n00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.800\nThey love it, but the warranty's bad.\n\n471\n00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.430\nOr they may use words like,\nfit for purpose, or fit for use.\n\n472\n00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.760\nFit for use is associated with warranty.\n\n473\n00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.170\nFitness for\npurpose is associated with utility.\n\n474\n00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.730\nGetting those rights is important.\n\n475\n00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.618\nNotice that, we see on another\ngraphic here coming up soon,\n\n476\n00:25:58.618 --> 00:26:03.260\nutility and warranty,\nwhat they're trying to do is,\n\n477\n00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.950\nutility increases the ability for\npositive outcomes.\n\n478\n00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:12.990\nWarranty reduces variations\nin performance, right?\n\n479\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.370\nSo imagine that geophysicist\nat the oil company.\n\n480\n00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:23.390\nHe was used to going out and using some\nhardware to drill down into the earth,\n\n481\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:28.820\nbringing up those samples of earth, going\nback to his lab and doing some magical\n\n482\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.770\nwork, right, to determine,\nis this a good place to drill, right?\n\n483\n00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:34.650\nNow, I understand.\n\n484\n00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.882\nAgain, I'm no geophysicist.\n\n485\n00:26:35.882 --> 00:26:38.980\nNow I understand they can do\nthat with MRI imaging, right?\n\n486\n00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.458\nThey don't have to go drill down.\n\n487\n00:26:40.458 --> 00:26:44.255\nThey can use MRI imaging, and\nhe doesn't have to go to the field.\n\n488\n00:26:44.255 --> 00:26:48.160\nHe can stay back in his lab, and\ndata can be transferred to that.\n\n489\n00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.800\nSo look at what utility is\nbeing given at geophysicists.\n\n490\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.060\nHe's no longer in the field, right?\n\n491\n00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.430\nHe's using data that's transported to him,\nright?\n\n492\n00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.810\nNow it better be good data.\n\n493\n00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.520\nIt better be reliable.\n\n494\n00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.195\nIt better be there and on time.\n\n495\n00:27:03.195 --> 00:27:06.950\nSo the warranty has to be there, but\nyou certainly provide the utility.\n\n496\n00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.730\nLet's use one maybe a bit more realistic.\n\n497\n00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:16.750\nCherokee, I suspect you're probably young\nenough not to remember days before email.\n\n498\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I can remember days before email.\n\n499\n00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, good, okay.\nThere was a time before there was\n\n500\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:20.860\nemail, right?\n\n501\n00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.950\nIn an office environment,\nthere was days when there was not email.\n\n502\n00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.390\nWhen email came about it, obviously\nprovided the utility to be able to more\n\n503\n00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:32.490\nquickly communicate with more people and\nget read receipts and what not, right?\n\n504\n00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:37.500\nSo as you consider the value proposition\non the utility side, email allowed for\n\n505\n00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.900\nfaster, asynchronous communication, right?\n\n506\n00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:48.750\nNow, that was supporting performance,\nright, of communication.\n\n507\n00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.280\nYou could also remove the constraint,\n\n508\n00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.480\nbecause I remember when\nemail first came about.\n\n509\n00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.952\nI could have email with my office mates,\nbut I couldn't talk email.\n\n510\n00:27:56.952 --> 00:27:58.910\n&gt;&gt; Externally?\n&gt;&gt; Externally, right?\n\n511\n00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.170\nSo that constraint was removed,\nprimarily through the Internet, right?\n\n512\n00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:07.330\nI also remember the constraint,\nI had to be on a company desktop or\n\n513\n00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.275\nlaptop at the company office.\n\n514\n00:28:09.275 --> 00:28:12.850\nSo a virtual network helped with that.\n\n515\n00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.860\nI could do it from home\nwith my company laptop, and\n\n516\n00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.360\nconnect to my network at work,\nand then get access to my email.\n\n517\n00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.250\nAnd then it removed that constraint.\n\n518\n00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:21.950\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n519\n00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.025\n&gt;&gt; I've got my phone now, right?\n\n520\n00:28:23.025 --> 00:28:26.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH We have all sorts of\ncollaboration tools available in\n\n521\n00:28:26.421 --> 00:28:27.080\nreal time.\n\n522\n00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.100\nWe don't even have to wait for\na few seconds delay with email anymore.\n\n523\n00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.040\nIt's crazy.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it is absolutely amazing.\n\n524\n00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.710\nSo, again, the same basic service,\nthe same basic utility in terms of,\n\n525\n00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.430\nI can still email people, but\n\n526\n00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.940\nI removed the constraint of being\non a desktop or at home, right?\n\n527\n00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.450\nI could be just about anywhere now.\n\n528\n00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:45.720\nSo that's on the utilities side.\n\n529\n00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.430\nOf course, it has to be available and\nready to perform as expected.\n\n530\n00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.490\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Terry,\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but\n\n531\n00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.120\nit looks like we are out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n532\n00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.230\nSo thank you for joining us today,\nand thank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n533\n00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.430\njoining us as well.\n\n534\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.973\nBut, for this show, I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign out as your host.\n\n535\n00:29:00.973 --> 00:29:02.558\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n536\n00:29:02.558 --> 00:29:03.449\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n537\n00:29:03.449 --> 00:29:06.853\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n538\n00:29:06.853 -->

00:00:08.297\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:10.491\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:15.082\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL Service Offerings\nand Agreement Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.677\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:18.529\nIn the previous episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.750\nwe are really just looking at\nthe foundations refresher if you will.\n\n9\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.039\nAnd this show is actually a part\ntwo of that previous episode.\n\n10\n00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.892\nSo with us today in studios, we have Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:30.241\nTerry Decker to contribute\nto this conversation.\n\n12\n00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:31.836\nThank you for joining as Terry.\n\n13\n00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:33.516\n&gt;&gt; As always happy to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:37.307\nAnd as Cherokee said we got a little bit\nmore to finish up on this review of some\n\n15\n00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:39.156\nof the principles and foundations.\n\n16\n00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:41.138\nAnd actually getting our head and\n\n17\n00:00:41.138 --> 00:00:45.118\ntongue around the language of ITIL\ncuz the language is important.\n\n18\n00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:46.172\nWe gotta keep up, and\n\n19\n00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:49.910\nthis is one of the best examples of\nhow important the language can be.\n\n20\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.949\nJust look at the slide here, this word\nasset has a very specific meaning in ITIL.\n\n21\n00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.690\nIt's commonly used in so many different\ncontexts that we could certainly\n\n22\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.770\nhave in our own mind what it might mean.\n\n23\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.163\nBut you'll see here, an asset in\nthe ITIL language is any resource or\n\n24\n00:01:07.163 --> 00:01:08.617\ncapability, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.617 --> 00:01:11.060\nWhat's a resource?\n\n26\n00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.380\nIt could be a server, an application,\na person, it could be a process, right?\n\n27\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.460\nA capability of course,\nis a little less tangible,\n\n28\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.434\nsomething you have to measure through\nskills or abilities or performance, right?\n\n29\n00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:31.182\nSo capabilities is an organizational\nability to build to get something done.\n\n30\n00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:35.157\nSo again an asset is either a resource or\na capability.\n\n31\n00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.399\nIt's not necessarily something\nyou slip up an asset tag on and\n\n32\n00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.466\nhave a depreciation schedule for\nfinancial management.\n\n33\n00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:44.103\n&gt;&gt; So Terry, you mean it doesn't\nalways have to be tangible.\n\n34\n00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:44.968\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n35\n00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:49.620\nAn asset can be a resource or\na capability, a skill set, right?\n\n36\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.731\nAnd another thing to remember,\n\n37\n00:01:51.731 --> 00:01:55.570\nis that these assets exists in\ntwo domains or two classes.\n\n38\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.600\nCherokee, you got an idea what\nthose two classes might be?\n\n39\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.620\n&gt;&gt; I see, what do we have\nhere in our little columns?\n\n40\n00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.639\nResources in the orange and\nwhat does that say in the blue?\n\n41\n00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:06.229\nThe capabilities.\n\n42\n00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.792\n&gt;&gt; The capabilities.\n\n43\n00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.337\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nis that really where we're heading?\n\n44\n00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:12.080\n&gt;&gt; Well that's the types if you will,\nthat's the types of assets.\n\n45\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.539\nBut these assets exist in two domains.\n\n46\n00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.600\nCustomer assets and service assets.\n\n47\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.598\nSo IT has their resources and capabilities\nand customers have their resources and\n\n48\n00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:22.618\ncapabilities.\n\n49\n00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:26.700\nYou recall the question,\nthe rhetorical question I asked.\n\n50\n00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.377\nDo you have to be a geophysicist to work\nin the IT department of a oil company?\n\n51\n00:02:32.377 --> 00:02:34.330\nNo, right?\n\n52\n00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.930\nYou have your assets and\nresources and capabilities in IT, and\n\n53\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.370\nyou add those assets to customer assets,\n\n54\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.340\nlike the scientist,\nthe engineers in that oil company.\n\n55\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.990\nAnd together, you create some sort of\nbusiness outcome, like finding oil,\n\n56\n00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.240\nand extracting it and distributing it.\n\n57\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.540\nSo it's not IT's job to do the extraction,\nthe location and distributing.\n\n58\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.460\nBut it's IT's job to bring their assets,\nso that the company's assets can be used\n\n59\n00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.600\nto get those business outcomes achieved,\nright?\n\n60\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.530\nSo that's another important\nasset of the word assets.\n\n61\n00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.040\nThere's two types, resources and\n\n62\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.930\ncapabilities, and\nthey exist in two domains.\n\n63\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.190\nAs you consider service strategy and\nservice design and\n\n64\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.060\nservice offerings and agreements.\n\n65\n00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.481\nYou're necessarily going to have to\nbe concerned about customer assets,\n\n66\n00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:23.680\nas well as your own.\n\n67\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.080\nTo ignore customer assets would\nbe doing so at your own peril.\n\n68\n00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.591\nBecause you might introduce a great\nsolution in the eyes of an IT person that\n\n69\n00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:38.940\nis not really usable by a person in\nthe business, as an example, right?\n\n70\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.665\nSo that's why here's a reminder, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:46.750\nAgain, words, what is a process?\n\n72\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.797\nA structured set of activities, designed\nto accomplish a specific objective.\n\n73\n00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:53.397\n&gt;&gt; Now those,\ndo they have to go in sequential order?\n\n74\n00:03:53.397 --> 00:03:57.210\nI've read in several books that that's\nusually from the IT perspective, but\n\n75\n00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.183\nis that here also with ITIL definition?\n\n76\n00:03:59.183 --> 00:04:02.940\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, a process,\nit follows a flow.\n\n77\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.397\nAnd while ITIL defines 26\nprocesses that should be\n\n78\n00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:12.066\nexecuted to be a successful\nIT service organization.\n\n79\n00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:14.222\nThey don't tell you how to\ndefine that process, so\n\n80\n00:04:14.222 --> 00:04:15.685\nyou should have these processes.\n\n81\n00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:16.964\n&gt;&gt; The knowledge.\n\n82\n00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:19.762\n&gt;&gt; The knowledge, and\nI mean you should write them down.\n\n83\n00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:23.955\nThey just don't prescribe the specific\nway you should do it in the process.\n\n84\n00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:28.765\nThat has to be adopted to the reality\nof what business you're in, right?\n\n85\n00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:33.400\nAnd keep in mind that there's business\nprocesses and business outcomes, and\n\n86\n00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.040\nthere's IT processes and IT outcomes.\n\n87\n00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.045\nAnd again,\nas we've talked about resources,\n\n88\n00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:39.007\nwhat you're trying to\ndo is harmonize those.\n\n89\n00:04:39.007 --> 00:04:44.143\nSo that what IT is doing on behalf of\nthe business process wise, is in effect\n\n90\n00:04:44.143 --> 00:04:49.300\nmoving the needle in the right\ndirection for the business themselves.\n\n91\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.484\n&gt;&gt; And Terry, there's also I\nknow from my experience in IT,\n\n92\n00:04:51.484 --> 00:04:54.533\nthere are a lot of different white papers\nout there and different publications.\n\n93\n00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:58.343\nOrganizations that offer guidelines for\nspecific IT processes for\n\n94\n00:04:58.343 --> 00:05:03.100\nlike you've mentioned, depending on\nwhatever field or industry that you're in?\n\n95\n00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.240\n&gt;&gt; Right, well so what ITIL does\nis a good example, Cherokee.\n\n96\n00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.607\nWhat ITIL does,\nis they describe this framework,\n\n97\n00:05:09.607 --> 00:05:11.988\nthese processes need to\ninteract with each other.\n\n98\n00:05:11.988 --> 00:05:16.367\nAnd you can find various templates and\nvarious downloadable services,\n\n99\n00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:20.327\nyou can hire consultants,\nyou could look at your own practices.\n\n100\n00:05:20.327 --> 00:05:23.456\nThere are some things that are reusable\nfrom one place to another.\n\n101\n00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.987\nBut ITIL presents its findings and\n\n102\n00:05:25.987 --> 00:05:32.390\nits best practise at a higher level before\ndefining what you should do or must do.\n\n103\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.240\nThey describe here's the framework\nadapted to your reality.\n\n104\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I got you, thank you.\n&gt;&gt; You better.\n\n105\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.780\nAll right, so moving forward, looking\nat the characteristics of a process.\n\n106\n00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.129\nThey are measurable,\nthey provide some sort of output for\n\n107\n00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.460\nspecific results to\na specific stake holders.\n\n108\n00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.430\nYou see the term customer focus?\n\n109\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.530\nAbsolutely, you're trying to do this\non behalf of your customers, right?\n\n110\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.700\nAnd response to specific events or\ntriggers.\n\n111\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.450\nSo something gets them started, they\n\n112\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.410\nspit out something of use to\na particular stake holder, right?\n\n113\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.450\nAnd this process,\nall these processes should be measurable.\n\n114\n00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.366\nThe implication is there,\nyou actually measure them.\n\n115\n00:06:19.366 --> 00:06:23.243\nSo again, ITIL describes 26 processes.\n\n116\n00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:27.325\nThey are high on the idea\n\n117\n00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:29.755\nthat you should also measure\nthese processes you implement.\n\n118\n00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:32.095\nSo what does measurement mean?\n\n119\n00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:33.283\nWhen you consider for\n\n120\n00:06:33.283 --> 00:06:37.375\ninstance the success of incident\nmanagement which is when a user calls and\n\n121\n00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:41.810\nsays, I'm having an issue with this\napplication or an issue with the service.\n\n122\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.110\n&gt;&gt; So our metrics may be of response time.\n\n123\n00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.173\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, how quickly did it take\nyou to respond to that call, or\n\n124\n00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:50.535\nhow quickly did it take you to fix it-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n125\n00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.515\n&gt;&gt; If there's something broken, right?\n\n126\n00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:53.588\nSo we're talking about measuring, right?\n\n127\n00:06:53.588 --> 00:06:57.090\nSo that's just an example\nof measuring a process.\n\n128\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.050\nAs it relates to strategy and design,\n\n129\n00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.215\nwhat you want to measure is\nthe ultimate success of the process.\n\n130\n00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.925\nIs it fit for purpose?\n\n131\n00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:09.025\nDoes it actually satisfy customer needs?\n\n132\n00:07:09.025 --> 00:07:13.285\nAnd does it allow the customer to be more\nsuccessful, really what it comes down to.\n\n133\n00:07:13.285 --> 00:07:19.205\nSo measuring your processes is a\nfundamental feature of process ownership.\n\n134\n00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.215\nAnd as it relates to design,\n\n135\n00:07:20.215 --> 00:07:26.050\nwhich we're gonna be talking about In\ndepth as we go through this course\n\n136\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.220\nis that measurement is something you\nneed to define as a designed element.\n\n137\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.690\nYou dont wait until operations to figure\nout how we're going to measure this thing.\n\n138\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.980\nYou build into the design of the service.\n\n139\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.460\nWe will be reinforcing this idea\nmany times as we go through, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.070\nSo process model effectively\nwhat a process model is,\n\n141\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.430\nis understanding what the process\nis trying to get done.\n\n142\n00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.020\nYou'll see in the red text there\nprocess definition, right?\n\n143\n00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.630\nUnderstanding what it's trying to do.\n\n144\n00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.700\nUnderstanding a process owner,\n\n145\n00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.880\nwhat objectives are actually trying\nto be achieved by the process.\n\n146\n00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.239\nSo a process has a genesis,\nwhy do we even do this?\n\n147\n00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:10.193\nWhy do we have an incident\nmanagement process?\n\n148\n00:08:10.193 --> 00:08:13.010\nWhy do we have a change\nmanagement process?\n\n149\n00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.715\nMore relevant to our course, why would we\nhave a business relationship process or\n\n150\n00:08:17.715 --> 00:08:21.585\na financial management process,\nwhy do we have them?\n\n151\n00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:25.532\nA process model is defining the whose and\nthe whys of any given process, and\n\n152\n00:08:25.532 --> 00:08:28.869\nit's backed by governance,\nit's backed by policy, right?\n\n153\n00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:31.370\nSo it's one thing to have a process.\n\n154\n00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.240\nIt's another thing to make sure it's\nfollowed, and that it's done well.\n\n155\n00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.665\nSo that's when you get involved in\nthe measurement of the process, and\n\n156\n00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:40.502\nthe policies backing up the process.\n\n157\n00:08:40.502 --> 00:08:46.020\nAnd the audit, going around and seeing,\nare you following the process or not?\n\n158\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.140\nSo that's also part of the process\nmodel and of course, you need something\n\n159\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.110\nthat enables the process, that's\nthe people that actually get it done.\n\n160\n00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.917\nYou have wise people trained in\nthe process, understand how to use it, and\n\n161\n00:08:56.917 --> 00:08:59.300\ndo so consistently and well, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.060\nAgain, reviewing these topics, question.\n\n163\n00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.580\nWhat is a process model?\n\n164\n00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.050\nYou just need to consider that\nprocesses need to be backed by\n\n165\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.470\na model of governance,\nauditing, and measurement.\n\n166\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.470\nAgain going through these definitions,\nwords you're gonna encounter on the exam.\n\n167\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.520\nNot as a question, but\njust as part of the language, a function.\n\n168\n00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.470\nA function is a group of\npeople with special skills or\n\n169\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.890\ntools that's short hand for it.\n\n170\n00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.780\nWhere as a process,\nit's a structure set of activities.\n\n171\n00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.958\nA function is a group of people\nthat get things done, right?\n\n172\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.800\nThey have special skills and\ntools to get those things done.\n\n173\n00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.770\nSo I tell this,\n\n174\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.600\nagain the really good at kind of devolving\nthings down at the digestible bits.\n\n175\n00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.169\nAnd they define four functions,\nin fact an only four.\n\n176\n00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:49.770\nAn applications management, those people\nthat know every thing about application.\n\n177\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.475\nTechnology management, those people know\neverything who knows about infrastructure.\n\n178\n00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:59.839\nBackend, servers, data bases, networks,\ncloud computing, web services etc.\n\n179\n00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:04.564\nAnd then you have day to day operations,\nthe things that have to happen everyday.\n\n180\n00:10:04.564 --> 00:10:08.995\nNot necessarily experts, but people\nthat just do the day to day grind of IT.\n\n181\n00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:13.562\nAnd then you have a other\nfunction called service desk,\n\n182\n00:10:13.562 --> 00:10:19.790\nthat interface between the service\nprovider and the end users, all right?\n\n183\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.878\nGood deal.\n\n184\n00:10:20.878 --> 00:10:22.850\nNow what about roles?\n\n185\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.825\nRoles are specific people with specific\n\n186\n00:10:29.825 --> 00:10:33.195\npoints of accountability and\nhere's one called the process owner.\n\n187\n00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:36.987\nNice generically described, the process\nowner is accountable to ensure that\n\n188\n00:10:36.987 --> 00:10:40.384\nthe process is performed according\nto agreed in documented process.\n\n189\n00:10:40.384 --> 00:10:45.340\nAnd it meets the goals,\nit's fit for purpose, right?\n\n190\n00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.481\nSo a process owner doesn't necessarily\nget involved in the day to day grind of\n\n191\n00:10:49.481 --> 00:10:51.023\nthe execution of a process.\n\n192\n00:10:51.023 --> 00:10:56.015\nBut has defined it, has trained it,\nhas enabled its measurement, has ensured\n\n193\n00:10:56.015 --> 00:11:01.460\nthat it's followed and auditable and\nultimately that it's fit for purpose.\n\n194\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.100\nSo a process owner is someone\nthat's accountable for\n\n195\n00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.040\nthe quality of a process\nthroughout its life cycle, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.050\nNow again, this is generic role.\n\n197\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.620\nLater on, we'll be talking about service\nportfolio management as a process.\n\n198\n00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.360\nTo make service portfolio\nmanagement happen,\n\n199\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.280\nif you want to get that done\nas an IT service provider.\n\n200\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.310\nThe one of the first things\nyou do is name someone,\n\n201\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.280\nthe owner of the service\nportfolio management process.\n\n202\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.000\nThey become the owner of that process.\n\n203\n00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.487\n&gt;&gt; So Terry, you had mentioned in\nthe previous slide about the importance of\n\n204\n00:11:33.487 --> 00:11:36.029\nprocess governance and\njust really enforcing that.\n\n205\n00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.587\nNow I've worked in a capacity for\nprocess improvement and\n\n206\n00:11:39.587 --> 00:11:42.570\nI saw that there wasn't\nany kind of governance.\n\n207\n00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:47.071\nAnd people were just kind of taking it\nupon themselves to modify that process in\n\n208\n00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:49.380\na way that might help themselves.\n\n209\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.345\nSo if a process owner sees that happening\nwith they could have pull in some one to\n\n210\n00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:56.668\nperhaps initiate a process improvement or\nsomething like that?\n\n211\n00:11:56.668 --> 00:12:01.097\n&gt;&gt; Interesting how you ask that question\ncuz I think it's a common symptom of\n\n212\n00:12:01.097 --> 00:12:05.111\ndysfunction, to have a process\nwithout the process being owned.\n\n213\n00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:09.331\nSo ITIL would consider a predictive step,\n\n214\n00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:14.372\na predicate step,\na first step in the definition of\n\n215\n00:12:14.372 --> 00:12:20.133\na process is to name an owner,\nit organically developed.\n\n216\n00:12:20.133 --> 00:12:21.124\n&gt;&gt; Wait until the problem occurs.\n\n217\n00:12:21.124 --> 00:12:23.101\n&gt;&gt; Right, be in front of it, and\n\n218\n00:12:23.101 --> 00:12:27.270\ngive someone the authority\nthrough process ownership.\n\n219\n00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.180\nThey are empowered to be\nowner of this process, and\n\n220\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.400\nthey make sure that it works and\nfits the purpose.\n\n221\n00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.368\nSo as it relates to continuous\nimprovement, the example you cited.\n\n222\n00:12:35.368 --> 00:12:40.138\nITIL would say if you want\nto have a CSI approach and\n\n223\n00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:47.550\nyou want to make it methodical,\nyou should determine improvement process.\n\n224\n00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.127\nAssign an owner to it and let them beat\nthe drum and crack the whip as necessary.\n\n225\n00:12:51.127 --> 00:12:52.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n226\n00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:53.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good question.\n\n227\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.119\nNow a process manager is\ntheir accountable for\n\n228\n00:12:57.119 --> 00:12:59.358\nthe operational management of the process.\n\n229\n00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:02.079\nSo while the owner owns the process.\n\n230\n00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:08.130\nThe process manager manages\nit on a day to day basis.\n\n231\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.781\nNow could any one person be both\na process owner and a process manager?\n\n232\n00:13:11.781 --> 00:13:13.487\n&gt;&gt; I don't seem so.\n\n233\n00:13:13.487 --> 00:13:15.358\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Specially considering some budgets.\n\n234\n00:13:15.358 --> 00:13:18.037\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthe size of the organization, right?\n\n235\n00:13:18.037 --> 00:13:19.551\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\n\n236\n00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:22.688\ndon't think of these as\nan organizational chart.\n\n237\n00:13:22.688 --> 00:13:23.956\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n238\n00:13:23.956 --> 00:13:25.946\nthese are roles that should be played,\n\n239\n00:13:25.946 --> 00:13:29.940\nif you put both of these roles in the mind\nof one person, that's totally fine.\n\n240\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.185\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's totally fine.\n\n241\n00:13:32.185 --> 00:13:33.852\nIn fact, it's not even hierarchical,\n\n242\n00:13:33.852 --> 00:13:36.066\neven if you separate the roles\nin a different people.\n\n243\n00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:41.298\nIt could be that a process owner is\nactually outranked by a process manager.\n\n244\n00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:44.944\nSo this is not describing an hierarchical\norganizational relationship either.\n\n245\n00:13:44.944 --> 00:13:45.516\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n246\n00:13:45.516 --> 00:13:49.288\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen you have process practitioners,\n\n247\n00:13:49.288 --> 00:13:54.370\npeople carrying out one or\nmore process activities.\n\n248\n00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.890\nNow again, could any given person be\na process owner, a process manager and\n\n249\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.220\na practitioner?\n\n250\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.381\nSure, could it be that the hierarchy\nis not relevant here either?\n\n251\n00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:08.357\nAbsolutely, a process practitioner\ncould outrank a process manager or\n\n252\n00:14:08.357 --> 00:14:10.960\na process owner for that matter.\n\n253\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.796\nA good example, change management.\n\n254\n00:14:12.796 --> 00:14:14.722\nChange management process,\n\n255\n00:14:14.722 --> 00:14:19.815\nthere might be a step within the process\nthat requires senior level approval.\n\n256\n00:14:19.815 --> 00:14:20.352\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n257\n00:14:20.352 --> 00:14:21.067\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n258\n00:14:21.067 --> 00:14:25.329\nSo in that case that senior level person\nis actually a practitioner with a role\n\n259\n00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:26.523\nwithin the process.\n\n260\n00:14:26.523 --> 00:14:31.323\n&gt;&gt; They might have that background\nexpertise to see if that change request\n\n261\n00:14:31.323 --> 00:14:36.355\nactually warrants the need,\nlike if it's applicable to that project.\n\n262\n00:14:36.355 --> 00:14:38.425\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it could be for\ntechnical acumen,\n\n263\n00:14:38.425 --> 00:14:42.865\nit could be for finance,\nit could be for business needs.\n\n264\n00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:47.485\nWhy you would have someone else involved\nin the practical approval of a change?\n\n265\n00:14:47.485 --> 00:14:49.327\nThey could outrank everyone else\nin the process for that matter.\n\n266\n00:14:49.327 --> 00:14:49.902\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n267\n00:14:49.902 --> 00:14:54.260\n&gt;&gt; So it's not hierarchical, not intended\nto be, it's not organizational structure.\n\n268\n00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.550\nQuite generically speaking then, we've\ngot process owner, process manager and\n\n269\n00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.200\nprocess practitioners.\n\n270\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.540\nAs this plays out on your exams,\nyou might be\n\n271\n00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:10.780\na consultant asks to advice\nthe CIO on what roles\n\n272\n00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.330\nshould be brought to bare on a given\nissue, this played out in a scenario.\n\n273\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.080\nSo you would need to\nname the roles by name.\n\n274\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.806\nWe need a service portfolio\nmanagement process owner,\n\n275\n00:15:20.806 --> 00:15:24.354\nwe need a business relationship\nmanager owner, those types of things.\n\n276\n00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:28.516\nSo that's what these generic\nroles turn into very specific\n\n277\n00:15:28.516 --> 00:15:30.355\nactions as we go through.\n\n278\n00:15:30.355 --> 00:15:34.215\nSo as we talk about each of\nthe processes later on in the show,\n\n279\n00:15:34.215 --> 00:15:38.851\nyou'll also have the opportunity to\nlook at these generic roles again.\n\n280\n00:15:38.851 --> 00:15:42.989\nAnd then see how it might apply to a\nspecific process instead of a generic one\n\n281\n00:15:42.989 --> 00:15:43.655\nlike this.\n\n282\n00:15:43.655 --> 00:15:48.570\nAll right, and the service owner.\n\n283\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.639\nThe service owner is accountable for\n\n284\n00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:55.997\nthe quality of their service,\nthat's short hand.\n\n285\n00:15:55.997 --> 00:16:00.514\nThey are the ones who make sure that the\nservice they own is delivering the value\n\n286\n00:16:00.514 --> 00:16:03.400\nthat it's intended to be delivered.\n\n287\n00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.718\nNow this word accountable\nis a loaded word.\n\n288\n00:16:04.718 --> 00:16:09.786\nYou may recall the RACI model in\nfoundation where we have responsible,\n\n289\n00:16:09.786 --> 00:16:14.780\nthe R, A is accountable,\nC is consulted, and I is Informed.\n\n290\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.190\nWell accountable means,\nyou make sure it gets done.\n\n291\n00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.590\nYou don't actually do anything\nspecifically, you make sure it gets done.\n\n292\n00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.146\nSo notice the service owner is accountable\nfor the delivery of an IT service,\n\n293\n00:16:26.146 --> 00:16:29.062\nto make sure it's satisfying\nthe customer's needs, right?\n\n294\n00:16:29.062 --> 00:16:32.758\nThey have lots of people that's\ngonna help them do that, right?\n\n295\n00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:36.340\nQuite generic in its description,\nservice owner.\n\n296\n00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.201\nDepending on what service is\nin play at any given time.\n\n297\n00:16:39.201 --> 00:16:40.676\nAs this plays out on an exam,\n\n298\n00:16:40.676 --> 00:16:44.868\nyou might be looking at a situation where\nthe service owners been doing reviews.\n\n299\n00:16:44.868 --> 00:16:47.828\nAnd getting complaints\nfrom the costumers that\n\n300\n00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:51.162\ntheir services not's a able\nto deliver as promised.\n\n301\n00:16:51.162 --> 00:16:55.260\nThe service owner needed to go to service\nstrategist to come up with an idea\n\n302\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.320\nprobably going to fix that, right?\n\n303\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.993\nSo [INAUDIBLE], we'll be talking about the\nrole of business relationship management\n\n304\n00:17:00.993 --> 00:17:02.480\na little bit later on as a process.\n\n305\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.660\nAnd here's a service owner with\naccountability for satisfied customers.\n\n306\n00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.940\nYou could see that the service owner\nis probably gonna be a practitioner\n\n307\n00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.380\nof the business relationship\nmanagement process.\n\n308\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.260\nSo try to connect the dots\nas we go along here.\n\n309\n00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.550\nThat'll all be playing out later\non when we talk about BRM,\n\n310\n00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.837\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n311\n00:17:21.837 --> 00:17:26.622\nAll right, very good, so that is it for\n\n312\n00:17:26.622 --> 00:17:32.580\nthe review of the foundational principles.\n\n313\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.079\nWhat's up next is gonna be start looking\nat that the big picture of service\n\n314\n00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:38.975\nstrategy and service design.\n\n315\n00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:39.919\n&gt;&gt; Management and design.\n\n316\n00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:40.702\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n317\n00:17:40.702 --> 00:17:42.914\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you heard it yourselves.\n\n318\n00:17:42.914 --> 00:17:45.678\nLadies and gentlemen stayed tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n319\n00:17:45.678 --> 00:17:47.610\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n320\n00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.880\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n321\n00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.701\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n322\n00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:52.530\n&gt;&gt; See you next time,

00:00:10.688\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:15.468\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen, to your\nService Offerings and Agreements series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:17.373\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:20.729\nIn this episode, we're really gonna be\ntaking a look at the big picture here.\n\n7\n00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:22.974\nAnd with us today back\nin studios we have Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:22.974 --> 00:00:25.780\nTerry Decker to help us\ndefine these concepts.\n\n9\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.260\nThank you for joining us Terry.\n\n10\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.130\n&gt;&gt; Happy to be here as always Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.270\nAnd as Cherokee said we're gonna\nbe looking at the big picture.\n\n12\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.309\nBefore we dive in to the details\nof each of the processes,\n\n13\n00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.995\nwe need to understand that the process\nwe're discussing are really\n\n14\n00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:41.165\nthe intersection of service strategy and\nservice design.\n\n15\n00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:43.815\nAll the processes come\nfrom those two stages.\n\n16\n00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:47.052\nAnd by understanding the big picture,\nwe'll be able to have a better\n\n17\n00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:51.252\nunderstanding of how that intersection\nshould be playing out in actuality.\n\n18\n00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:54.512\nAnd of course, to help you out on\nthe exam as well, we'll be looking at how\n\n19\n00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:58.342\nthese processes interact with each other\nand these stages interact as we go along.\n\n20\n00:00:58.342 --> 00:00:59.822\nSo as you look at the slide here.\n\n21\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.120\nIn a nutshell, and we'll get into some\ndetails for each of these, service\n\n22\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.748\nstrategy is the stage just determining\nwhat services are to be offered.\n\n23\n00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:12.670\nTo whom, when, why, you know what business\n\n24\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.830\noutcomes are being supported by\nthese services and at what cost.\n\n25\n00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.590\nSo making sure the right people\nare getting the right services for\n\n26\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.490\nthe right money is basically\nwhat strategy is about.\n\n27\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.390\nService design is trying to\nrealize that strategy and\n\n28\n00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.190\ncoming up with the best way forward and to\nalso broker the appropriate agreements so\n\n29\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.670\nthat everyone's on the same page\nabout what is going to be delivered.\n\n30\n00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.000\nAnd part of this agreement is going\nto be what's going to be measured.\n\n31\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.080\nWhat's does success look like?\n\n32\n00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.360\nDoes success look like more oil is\ndiscovered or, more widgets are sold?\n\n33\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.270\nWhat does success look like?\n\n34\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.310\nWell service design is gonna be\nthere to answer that question so\n\n35\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.950\nthat, by the time it gets to transition,\nit's built appropriately and\n\n36\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.310\nby the time it gets in service operations,\nit's actually delivering as promised.\n\n37\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.280\nSo strategy is the offering side of SOA\nand design is the agreement side of SOA.\n\n38\n00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.780\nAnd of course,\n\n39\n00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.390\nthey interact along the the way,\nnone of these things happen in a vacuum.\n\n40\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.420\nFor instance, it would be silly for\nstrategists to determine what services\n\n41\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.500\nshould be offered at what cost\nwithout employing and getting\n\n42\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.090\nsome good information from design people,\ntransition people, operations people and\n\n43\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.390\neven CSI to understand just what\nit's gonna take to make this happen.\n\n44\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.440\nSo that's it, a big picture,\n\n45\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.691\nlet's look a little bit more at just\nhow strategy and design play out.\n\n46\n00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.960\nOkay, as you can see here\none of the processes within\n\n47\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.970\nservice strategy is called strategy\nmanagement for IT services.\n\n48\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.600\nIt's kinda like the top\nof that particular stage.\n\n49\n00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.730\nLater on we'll talk about design\ncoordination as the top of service\n\n50\n00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.920\ndesign stage.\n\n51\n00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.770\nSo you have processes are in\nplay at a very high level.\n\n52\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.750\nOverseeing everything else\nthat's going on in that stage.\n\n53\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.560\nStrategy management for\nIT services, what it's doing for\n\n54\n00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.240\nstrategy is at a very high level.\n\n55\n00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.490\nMaking sure that the organization,\nthe IT service organization\n\n56\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.060\nis rightly motivated and rightly fit for\nthe challenges faced by the business.\n\n57\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.910\nYou will see this is alliteration here,\nperspective, position, plans and patterns,\n\n58\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.754\nthe four Ps of service strategy.\n\n59\n00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:24.940\nService design has four\nPs as well [LAUGH],\n\n60\n00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.030\njust keep up with that all\nthese alliteration pieces.\n\n61\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.169\nBut really what we're getting at,\nwhen we talk about perceptive of the IT\n\n62\n00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.220\norganization, you're really\ndoing your self-analysis.\n\n63\n00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.050\nWhat kind of IT organization are we?\n\n64\n00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.850\nAre we an IT organization that's highly\nresponsive, very reactionary and\n\n65\n00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.890\nfull on high quality in\nterms of speed of response?\n\n66\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.800\nOr are we more steady in our approach?\n\n67\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.440\nKeeping things under control.\n\n68\n00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.160\nNow what would be the likely governing\nfactor determining that perspective?\n\n69\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.280\n&gt;&gt; Time, budget perhaps.\n\n70\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Resources, really?\n\n71\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.100\n&gt;&gt; And resources, absolutely,\nyou have to know who you are.\n\n72\n00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.320\nWhat do you have,\nwhat skill sets do you have?\n\n73\n00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.180\nSo that's when you look at\nare you capable of doing this?\n\n74\n00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.380\nDo you have the right people to do\nthis type of IT work, basically.\n\n75\n00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.710\nAlso customers are gonna be driving this.\n\n76\n00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.580\nI mean, imagine the perspective\nof let's say Borders books or\n\n77\n00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.600\nBarnes and Noble,\nthey're still in business anyway.\n\n78\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.557\nBarnes and Noble, imagine the perspective\nof that IT department before Amazon.com.\n\n79\n00:04:29.557 --> 00:04:32.450\nAnd after Amazon.com, right?\n\n80\n00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.030\nThat perspective had to change.\n\n81\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.800\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Right so\n\n82\n00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.700\nthat IT department had to change,\ntheir IT service provision had\n\n83\n00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.350\nto change quite a bit in response\nto the business need that was\n\n84\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.610\nbrought to them because of\nthe competition of Amazon.com, right?\n\n85\n00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.970\nYou can say the same thing for\nWalmart's IT department perhaps too.\n\n86\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.360\nBecause Amazon is involved in everything\nnot just selling books but back in the day\n\n87\n00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.530\nit was just brick and mortar was\nbeing offset by some online sales,\n\n88\n00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.150\nand Barnes &amp; Noble had\na little bit of online sales.\n\n89\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.972\nOf course, you know kinda the rest of\nthe story, in terms of books, right?\n\n90\n00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:06.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n91\n00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.530\n&gt;&gt; Lots of things went on.\n\n92\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.810\nSo if you're in the IT department,\nyour perspective had to change, right?\n\n93\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.450\n&gt;&gt; And we see this even,\nI guess the maturity level of\n\n94\n00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.130\nan organization can really play in here,\nbecause I recently had an experience.\n\n95\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.160\nITProTV is kind of\na smaller startup company.\n\n96\n00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.330\nAnd they're able to be more agile and\nflexible,\n\n97\n00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.380\nbecause we have less,\nI guess, bureaucracy.\n\n98\n00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Would be the correct\n\n99\n00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.030\nterm in this situation, but.\n\n100\n00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.530\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n101\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.140\nAnd finding that balance of\nresponsiveness and flexibility\n\n102\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.300\nalong with stability and scalability, is\na difficult thing for any IT organization.\n\n103\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.070\nSo this idea of perspective\nis trying to understand that.\n\n104\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.990\nSo as an IT service provider you should\nbe looking at your perspectives to ensure\n\n105\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.270\nyou know where you are.\n\n106\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.740\nNow position is also introspective,\n\n107\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.930\nyou're looking at where you are in\nrelationships to the customer.\n\n108\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.670\nDo you have competition, right?\n\n109\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.877\nCertainly ITProTV has competition in\nthe marketplace of providing online\n\n110\n00:06:05.877 --> 00:06:07.360\nlearning, right?\n\n111\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.842\nAnd there's different\ntypes of competition so\n\n112\n00:06:09.842 --> 00:06:13.190\nwhere are you in relate to\nthat competition, right?\n\n113\n00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.510\nWhat do your customers think of\nyou at position in that regard?\n\n114\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.350\nAre you low cost, high quality, a little\nbit of both, trying to get both done?\n\n115\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.070\nThat's the nature of position.\n\n116\n00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.850\nWhere are you?\n\n117\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.250\nAre you a cost differentiator or are you\na quality differentiator is what position.\n\n118\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.600\nAs an internal service provider,\nyou also face competition.\n\n119\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.540\nYou could be outsourced, for instance.\n\n120\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.036\nBut even if you're fairly secure in\nyour competitive environment towards,\n\n121\n00:06:39.036 --> 00:06:42.478\nyou're not going to be outsourced and\nyou're providing unique services,\n\n122\n00:06:42.478 --> 00:06:44.377\neven technology provides competition.\n\n123\n00:06:44.377 --> 00:06:49.763\nIf you are on a mainframe with dummy\nterminal environments, circa 1981,\n\n124\n00:06:49.763 --> 00:06:55.738\nby 1985, 1990, you're thinking about\ndifferent ways of doing computing.\n\n125\n00:06:55.738 --> 00:06:58.014\nOr you're being left behind, right?\n\n126\n00:06:58.014 --> 00:07:00.714\nYou're not a dummy terminal\nlooking in a client's server, and\n\n127\n00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:02.290\ndifferent ways of doing it.\n\n128\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:07.010\nIf you're in a client server environment\ncirca 2000 you probably considered,\n\n129\n00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.450\nwell, we should probably be on the web.\n\n130\n00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.820\nHave web applications instead of-\n&gt;&gt; Cloud services, exactly.\n\n131\n00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.250\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen now I'm going to cloud services.\n\n132\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.745\nSo even if you are secure in your\norganization as an internal provider,\n\n133\n00:07:17.745 --> 00:07:20.175\nas the service provider of choice.\n\n134\n00:07:20.175 --> 00:07:23.715\nYou're still faced with this challenge\nof competitive technology or\n\n135\n00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:27.872\nchanging technology keeping your\nposition always kinda mushy-\n\n136\n00:07:27.872 --> 00:07:28.792\n&gt;&gt; Staying relevant.\n\n137\n00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:31.242\n&gt;&gt; Staying relevant, absolutely, right?\n\n138\n00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:34.752\nAnd then based on your perspective and\npositions you come up with plans.\n\n139\n00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:38.342\nSo you have these skill sets,\nyou have this mindset and\n\n140\n00:07:38.342 --> 00:07:39.951\nyou have this position in perspective.\n\n141\n00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:43.401\nNow you need to come up with plans for\n\n142\n00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:48.631\nhow you want to make value achievable for\nyour customers, right?\n\n143\n00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:50.335\nSo you come up with plans.\n\n144\n00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:54.860\nAnd then this idea of patterns,\nif you look at the full screen there,\n\n145\n00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.619\nthis idea of patterns is really\nthat you get good at this.\n\n146\n00:07:58.619 --> 00:08:01.660\nYou're not reinventing yourself every day.\n\n147\n00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.041\nYou don't have to understand every day,\n\n148\n00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:08.476\nyou don't have to reask the same\nquestions, you have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n149\n00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:13.666\nSo patterns comes up with or you're\ndeveloping a capability to repeat and\n\n150\n00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:16.428\nbe good at responding to the business,\n\n151\n00:08:16.428 --> 00:08:21.046\nresponding to the competition or\nresponding to the technology.\n\n152\n00:08:21.046 --> 00:08:23.877\nYou get good at it, because you\ncome up with repeatable process.\n\n153\n00:08:23.877 --> 00:08:28.502\n&gt;&gt; So for example here at ITPro.TV,\nwe got understand our value, what kind of\n\n154\n00:08:28.502 --> 00:08:33.072\nniche programmes what we're good in,\nwhat we can create good content in.\n\n155\n00:08:33.072 --> 00:08:37.848\nI wouldn't try to just randomly create\na show on, I don't know horse training or\n\n156\n00:08:37.848 --> 00:08:40.811\nsomething that I had\nabsolutely no expertise in.\n\n157\n00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:46.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, you provide training primarily\nin the IT services space absolutely.\n\n158\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.738\nSo yeah, understanding who you are,\nwhat you are and\n\n159\n00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:53.648\ncoming up with appropriate plans, and\ncoming up with repeatable models.\n\n160\n00:08:53.648 --> 00:08:55.503\nSo as you gonna do this well over and\nover,\n\n161\n00:08:55.503 --> 00:08:57.574\nthat doesn't mean you\ndon't have to change.\n\n162\n00:08:57.574 --> 00:08:59.885\nBy repeatable, we don't mean static.\n\n163\n00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:06.100\nWe just mean you have a methodology for\nmaking your changes in a natural way.\n\n164\n00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.131\nOkay, good deal.\n\n165\n00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:12.587\nSo strategy management for IT services is\nreally what we are trying to get done in.\n\n166\n00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:17.161\nIf you look at the full graphic here is to\nintegrate across the organizations from\n\n167\n00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.526\nthe IT organizations you se on the right.\n\n168\n00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:23.036\nThe CIO with their service\nmanagement capability and\n\n169\n00:09:23.036 --> 00:09:26.862\non the ground service desk\ninterface with the customers.\n\n170\n00:09:26.862 --> 00:09:31.102\nAnd on the left, you have the business,\nthe CEO at the top, and\n\n171\n00:09:31.102 --> 00:09:35.430\nthe customers and who sponsor,\nand who pays for this services.\n\n172\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.602\nAnd of course the end users that\nactually utilize those services.\n\n173\n00:09:39.602 --> 00:09:45.360\nSo the communication, these arrows\ncould be going left and right.\n\n174\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.746\nThe CEO talks to the CIO, right?\n\n175\n00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:51.115\nCustomers talk with service managers and\nend users talk with service desks.\n\n176\n00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:55.787\nThat's where you can see a kind of\nthe horizontal communication lines going,\n\n177\n00:09:55.787 --> 00:09:56.295\nright?\n\n178\n00:09:56.295 --> 00:10:02.960\nFor those of you that might be familiar\nwith the OSI model, IT OSI model where\n\n179\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:09.330\ndifferent layers in a given\napplication are talking to each other.\n\n180\n00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.403\nBut holistically, they provide the full\nview and full end to end capability for\n\n181\n00:10:14.403 --> 00:10:17.746\nvalue or for\ncommunication between two computers.\n\n182\n00:10:17.746 --> 00:10:20.459\nWell this is really what's going on here,\nsomewhere to the OSI model.\n\n183\n00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:24.574\nThe CEO has conversations with the CIO and\nof course they talk downstream,\n\n184\n00:10:24.574 --> 00:10:26.280\neach of them talk downstream.\n\n185\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.260\nThe arrow should also be bidirectional,\nright?\n\n186\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.523\nBecause the CEO needs to make\ninformed decisions based on what\n\n187\n00:10:34.523 --> 00:10:37.483\nthe business needs,\nthat's where the customers are.\n\n188\n00:10:37.483 --> 00:10:42.203\nAnd what in customers need to make\ndecisions based on what in users need\n\n189\n00:10:42.203 --> 00:10:42.846\nas well.\n\n190\n00:10:42.846 --> 00:10:47.014\nSo strategy management services\nis at this upper level of CEO and\n\n191\n00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:52.280\nCIO with some customer interface and\nservice management interface playing in.\n\n192\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.061\nAll stakes must be held here though\nbecause we got to take care of ourselves\n\n193\n00:10:57.061 --> 00:11:00.525\nin the service desk, and\ntake care of the end users as well, right?\n\n194\n00:11:04.558 --> 00:11:08.655\nFocus here on this particular slide,\non the last couple bullets there.\n\n195\n00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:11.970\nNot that the first ones aren't important,\nbut really what is driving this,\n\n196\n00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.830\nis there's two aspects\nof service strategy.\n\n197\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:19.816\nOne is what services you should\nbe offering to customers, right?\n\n198\n00:11:19.816 --> 00:11:23.822\nSo determining what services should be\noffered that's the planning part or\n\n199\n00:11:23.822 --> 00:11:24.454\nstrategy.\n\n200\n00:11:24.454 --> 00:11:27.252\nBut then you also have\nto have a strategy for\n\n201\n00:11:27.252 --> 00:11:31.010\nhow you're gonna operate\nthese services in the future.\n\n202\n00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.174\nI know myself and perhaps you have\nstories as well Cherokee perhaps.\n\n203\n00:11:34.174 --> 00:11:38.416\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where you've seen applications or\n\n204\n00:11:38.416 --> 00:11:43.060\nsolutions delivered on time and on budget,\n\n205\n00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.711\nbut not quite ready for prime time, right?\n\n206\n00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:51.860\nNot fully baked, and the response\nthen is you got to put out a fires.\n\n207\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.016\nYou got to shore up this particular\nfailing or that particular failing.\n\n208\n00:11:55.016 --> 00:11:56.432\nThat's gonna happen, right?\n\n209\n00:11:56.432 --> 00:11:59.519\n&gt;&gt; Sure, sometimes,\nwe call that beta, right?\n\n210\n00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.464\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n211\n00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:01.650\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes we call that beta or pilot.\n\n212\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.252\nExactly, good point, right?\n\n213\n00:12:03.252 --> 00:12:04.266\nGood point, so\n\n214\n00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:09.490\nservice delivery as opposed to solutions\ndelivery has similar elements.\n\n215\n00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.910\nYou can deliver services not\nquite ready for prime time.\n\n216\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.160\nWhat service strategists are trying to do,\n\n217\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.380\nis determine the appropriate\nlevel of investment.\n\n218\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.522\nAnd funding a project that\nhas a set beginning and\n\n219\n00:12:22.522 --> 00:12:27.381\na known end over a particular\namount of time is one thing.\n\n220\n00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:31.988\nPlanning for the sustainable\noperations of a given service is\n\n221\n00:12:31.988 --> 00:12:37.420\na more difficult question to answer,\nbut very important to fund.\n\n222\n00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.950\nYou have to have the right fundings,\nso how do you handle upgrades?\n\n223\n00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:45.630\nHow do you afford\nthe licensing over time and\n\n224\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.930\nthe support contracts,\nthose sorts of things?\n\n225\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.213\nSo asking appropriate questions at\nthe strategic level about what it's\n\n226\n00:12:51.213 --> 00:12:54.838\ngonna take to operate this service, not\njust get it to life, but to operate it-\n\n227\n00:12:54.838 --> 00:12:56.590\n&gt;&gt; Total cost of ownership, so to speak.\n\n228\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.398\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nit's gonna be a very important aspect of\n\n229\n00:12:58.398 --> 00:12:59.309\nservice strategy with us.\n\n230\n00:12:59.309 --> 00:13:01.891\nBecause they're gonna make\nthe decision at the strategic level,\n\n231\n00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:04.370\nhow much money is gonna be available for\nthis?\n\n232\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.030\nIt's one thing to fund the project, it's\nquite another to then fund the ongoing-\n\n233\n00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.094\n&gt;&gt; Any kind of maintenance.\n\n234\n00:13:09.094 --> 00:13:11.466\n&gt;&gt; Maintenance [INAUDIBLE],\nso having had a list view.\n\n235\n00:13:11.466 --> 00:13:13.603\nSo there's two aspects\nof service strategy.\n\n236\n00:13:13.603 --> 00:13:15.328\nAgain, not done in a vacuum,\n\n237\n00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:19.747\nservice strategy can't possibly answer\nall of these questions by itself.\n\n238\n00:13:19.747 --> 00:13:24.797\nIt's gonna rely on people and design,\nrely on people in transitions,\n\n239\n00:13:24.797 --> 00:13:30.959\noperations that even in CSI on how to best\nfund any given strategic initiative, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:36.110\nAll right, so if you get good at this,\nwhat value does it bring?\n\n241\n00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.409\nIf you get good at managing\nat a strategic level,\n\n242\n00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:44.732\nyou are going to be better linking your\nservice outcomes to services, right?\n\n243\n00:13:44.732 --> 00:13:50.150\nWhat the service provider is working on,\nis what the costumer needs.\n\n244\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.241\nWhich also means that you are not\nwasting your time working things\n\n245\n00:13:53.241 --> 00:13:54.938\nthat country's do not care about.\n\n246\n00:13:54.938 --> 00:14:00.162\nSo therefore more focused\ndelivery of value, right?\n\n247\n00:14:00.162 --> 00:14:03.664\nYou're going to get better\nunderstanding between the customers and\n\n248\n00:14:03.664 --> 00:14:06.880\nthe service provider is actually\nwhat's gonna be delivered.\n\n249\n00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.850\nWhat does success look like?\n\n250\n00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.220\nAgain, going back to the oil company,\nthey basically wanna do three things.\n\n251\n00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.691\nThey wanna find it, they wanna extract it,\nand they wanna distribute it,\n\n252\n00:14:14.691 --> 00:14:16.820\nthat's what the business wants.\n\n253\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.620\nIf IT can help them do those three things,\nthen IT's good.\n\n254\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.710\nIf IT gets in the way of doing that or\ncosts too much, then IT is not so good.\n\n255\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.790\nWhat service strategy's trying to do is\nbuild an understanding of what IT can do,\n\n256\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.520\nwhat it can't do, and managing the delta.\n\n257\n00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.840\n&gt;&gt; So here at ITPro.TV,\n\n258\n00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.230\nI guess our metric would be we have\nkind of these stars on the shows.\n\n259\n00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.191\nAnd we also have forums,\nwe have support, a support email.\n\n260\n00:14:43.191 --> 00:14:45.246\nSo we even send out surveys from time,\n\n261\n00:14:45.246 --> 00:14:47.751\njust to kind of keep in\ntouch with our members,\n\n262\n00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:51.630\nto make sure that we are delivering\nin fact what they want us to deliver.\n\n263\n00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.284\nSo that would be an example, as far\nas our strategy management goes here.\n\n264\n00:14:55.284 --> 00:14:59.997\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and you also have wise\npractitioners within your organization,\n\n265\n00:14:59.997 --> 00:15:00.500\nright?\n\n266\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.097\nSo you can validate your ideas as well.\n\n267\n00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:07.703\nSo you mentioned some curriculum\nyou were working on recently,\n\n268\n00:15:07.703 --> 00:15:10.614\nI hadn't heard of before, what was it?\n\n269\n00:15:10.614 --> 00:15:11.542\n&gt;&gt; Was it the NumPy?\n\n270\n00:15:11.542 --> 00:15:12.301\n&gt;&gt; NumPy.\n\n271\n00:15:12.301 --> 00:15:13.645\n&gt;&gt; I didn't create it,\nbut yes, I was hosting.\n\n272\n00:15:13.645 --> 00:15:15.038\n&gt;&gt; No, you didn't create it,\nyou were hosting it.\n\n273\n00:15:15.038 --> 00:15:15.646\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n274\n00:15:15.646 --> 00:15:18.994\n&gt;&gt; I've never heard of NumPy and\nI'm probably not gonna be looking for\n\n275\n00:15:18.994 --> 00:15:21.360\nthat subscription anytime soon either.\n\n276\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.980\nBut someone had the idea that\nNumPy would be a good idea.\n\n277\n00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.696\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That it come from your membership,\n\n278\n00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:29.850\nthat it come in house, either way you\nneed to validate that idea, right?\n\n279\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.707\nSo do you validate it in front\nof customers before you produce,\n\n280\n00:15:34.707 --> 00:15:38.545\ndo you produce it and then get it\nvalidated or do a little bit of both?\n\n281\n00:15:38.545 --> 00:15:41.155\n&gt;&gt; A little bit of both here.\n&gt;&gt; Right, [CROSSTALK] yeah.\n\n282\n00:15:41.155 --> 00:15:43.444\n&gt;&gt; So viewers are able to submit requests.\n\n283\n00:15:43.444 --> 00:15:47.220\nAnd then we also might have other motives\nthat we have business partners that\n\n284\n00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.817\nare requesting this and not-\n&gt;&gt; And the stakeholder.\n\n285\n00:15:49.817 --> 00:15:50.688\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n286\n00:15:50.688 --> 00:15:53.132\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's it, that's it in a nutshell.\n\n287\n00:15:53.132 --> 00:15:56.298\nIf you have a stakeholders that say,\nI think it would be a good idea,\n\n288\n00:15:56.298 --> 00:15:59.262\nyou have your ears open and\nyou're listening and you respond.\n\n289\n00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:01.108\nThat's what service strategy does.\n\n290\n00:16:01.108 --> 00:16:05.776\nThey enable this interface\nbetween costumers and\n\n291\n00:16:05.776 --> 00:16:10.332\nthe provider to accentuate value creation,\nand\n\n292\n00:16:10.332 --> 00:16:16.569\ntherefore provide the right\nservices to the right people, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:16.569 --> 00:16:18.365\nGood, good concepts.\n\n294\n00:16:18.365 --> 00:16:21.080\nNow moving on to the Design Coordination.\n\n295\n00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.770\nI mentioned strategy management for\n\n296\n00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.100\nIT services is kinda the boss\nof service strategy.\n\n297\n00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.665\nWell, the boss of service design is\na process called Design Coordination.\n\n298\n00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:35.720\nIn other courses, I will often refer to\nDesign Coordination as the mother hen,\n\n299\n00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.608\nor the boss hog, depending on which\nfarm animal you wanna choose, I guess.\n\n300\n00:16:39.608 --> 00:16:42.352\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But mother hen's kind of good,\n\n301\n00:16:42.352 --> 00:16:44.750\nbecause it keeps all the chicks in a row.\n\n302\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.940\nI mean everyone kind of follows a long in\nthe right order and does things right.\n\n303\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:55.210\nIf you're a project manager for\na organization that is mature\n\n304\n00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:59.770\nin IT service management,\nITIL in particular, as a project manager\n\n305\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.790\nyou're gonna be well informed about the\ndesign coordination process, because it's\n\n306\n00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:08.110\nalso the process that coordinates all\nthe activities and service design, right?\n\n307\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.031\nAnd make sure the right resources\nare provided for those, right?\n\n308\n00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:13.942\nSo coordination, planning,\nrisk assessment,\n\n309\n00:17:13.942 --> 00:17:17.558\nsounds a lot like project management,\ndoesn't it, right?\n\n310\n00:17:17.558 --> 00:17:20.506\nAnd to make every other process and\n\n311\n00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:25.090\nservices is done on time,\non budget, and done well.\n\n312\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.370\nSo Design Coordination,\nthat thing is on a nutshell.\n\n313\n00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.260\nBut what is Design Coordination\ntrying to do\n\n314\n00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.750\nspecifically it relates to\nservice offerings and agreements.\n\n315\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.270\nAt a big level it's making sure that\nthe service strategy is actually\n\n316\n00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.740\nrealized, right?\n\n317\n00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.750\nAnd it does so by making sure that\nservices are gonna meet current and\n\n318\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.650\nfuture business requirements, right?\n\n319\n00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.063\nYou don't build it just for\nthese number of users,\n\n320\n00:17:50.063 --> 00:17:54.001\nyou build it in such a way that it could\nhave more users, or more customers, right?\n\n321\n00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:57.923\nYou make sure that what you're developing,\nin terms of solutions and\n\n322\n00:17:57.923 --> 00:18:02.121\ntechnology, is actually gonna satisfy\nbusiness requirements, right?\n\n323\n00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:05.616\nAnd you have a very specific delivery,\nit's a huge deliverable.\n\n324\n00:18:05.616 --> 00:18:08.210\nWe'll talk about Service Design Package\nin just a little bit.\n\n325\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.550\nBut it's a big thing,\nit's a big deliverable and\n\n326\n00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:16.000\ndesign coordination owns and operates the\ndelivery of the Service Design Package.\n\n327\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.160\nWhich answers all the questions\nnecessary to be answered\n\n328\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.960\nbefore you start building your service,\nright?\n\n329\n00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:29.518\nDesign is driven by what requirements\nyou have both functional and\n\n330\n00:18:29.518 --> 00:18:31.750\nbusiness requirements.\n\n331\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.596\nAnd of course it's also constrained.\n\n332\n00:18:34.596 --> 00:18:40.140\nYou've got some experience in project\nmanagement, sounds like Cherokee?\n\n333\n00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.694\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n334\n00:18:40.694 --> 00:18:41.476\n&gt;&gt; What are constraints?\n\n335\n00:18:41.476 --> 00:18:45.010\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou've got three out of constraints.\n\n336\n00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.818\nBudgets, timelines, and resources.\n\n337\n00:18:48.818 --> 00:18:49.830\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n338\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:50.750\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n339\n00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.100\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much it.\n\n340\n00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.140\nIn nutshell, so budget, timeline and\nresources are some constraints.\n\n341\n00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.177\nYou could have technological constraints.\n\n342\n00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.568\nYou could have skill set, right?\n\n343\n00:18:58.568 --> 00:19:00.265\nWe're talking about resources, so\n\n344\n00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:03.550\nget a little bit deeper you might not\nhave the right number of people with\n\n345\n00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.850\nthe right skills set to be able to\nexecute, you got to manage that.\n\n346\n00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.852\nSo does that mean you gotta find some\nsuppliers to help you out in the meantime.\n\n347\n00:19:10.852 --> 00:19:16.130\nMaybe you're not really good at making\nweb development of your strategy,\n\n348\n00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.540\nyou don't have that kind of skills set,\nso you're gonna\n\n349\n00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.810\nhire a third party supplier to show\nup that part of the solution, right?\n\n350\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:28.288\nAgain, imagine that IT Department\nthat burns before amazon.com and\n\n351\n00:19:28.288 --> 00:19:29.790\nafter amazon.com.\n\n352\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:34.230\nWhat kind of adjustments do they have to\nmake in the design of their IT services?\n\n353\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.460\nThey had to come up with new services.\n\n354\n00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.250\nThey had to come up with new ways of\nsupporting those services both supporting\n\n355\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.640\nservices and third party services.\n\n356\n00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.210\nThey had to do a lot to make that happen I\nguess that's what they call there, right?\n\n357\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.190\nThey got the Kendle for Amazon,\nyou got the Nook for Barnes &amp; Noble.\n\n358\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.160\n&gt;&gt; I almost forgot about that.\n\n359\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.940\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, I mean, so they had\nto come up with lots of different things\n\n360\n00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.320\nto change the way they were providing\nservices for the business, right?\n\n361\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.280\nSo the constraints were, probably,\nat that time we don't have the skill sets.\n\n362\n00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.898\nWe gotta find these skill sets,\nwe're gonna hire them,\n\n363\n00:20:05.898 --> 00:20:08.580\nwe're gonna contract them,\nwe're gonna do something.\n\n364\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.335\nBut we don't have them now,\nso let's go get them.\n\n365\n00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:14.051\n&gt;&gt; Which is something that's pretty\nvaluable for an organization\n\n366\n00:20:14.051 --> 00:20:17.332\nis having people that can recognize\nthat need instead of saying, I got this.\n\n367\n00:20:17.332 --> 00:20:18.447\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n368\n00:20:18.447 --> 00:20:19.241\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where you\n\n369\n00:20:19.241 --> 00:20:19.786\nsee a lot of failure, right?\n\n370\n00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:23.344\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and a great point, we\ncould do this, yeah, we got this covered.\n\n371\n00:20:23.344 --> 00:20:26.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good point, you wanna be confident, but\n\n372\n00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:31.635\nnot cocky, and IT, I mean,\nITIL itself is hoping\n\n373\n00:20:31.635 --> 00:20:35.705\nto give you the right kind of tool sets,\nso you at least ask these questions and\n\n374\n00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:38.065\ntransparently answer them is\nwhat we're trying to get done.\n\n375\n00:20:38.065 --> 00:20:42.625\nAnd service design happens to be the stage\nwhere many, many questions are asked and\n\n376\n00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:45.442\nhopefully transparently answered,\nso everyone can see, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:47.702 --> 00:20:49.292\nSo why do design coordination?\n\n378\n00:20:49.292 --> 00:20:50.382\nWhat does it mean to the business?\n\n379\n00:20:51.692 --> 00:20:55.772\nReally the one that I like best on this\nparticular list, is the second one.\n\n380\n00:20:55.772 --> 00:20:57.209\nAnd it kinda points to\nall the rest of them.\n\n381\n00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.370\nMinimize rework and unplanned labor costs.\n\n382\n00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.458\nMinimize the need for rework and\n\n383\n00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:09.320\nunplanned labor costs throughout\nthe life cycle of a service.\n\n384\n00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.490\nAs I asked before,\nhave you ever delivered something, or\n\n385\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.540\nhas something ever been\ndelivered into operations?\n\n386\n00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.530\nShe said you called it beta, right?\n\n387\n00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.980\nWhere it wasn't quite ready for primetime.\n\n388\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:21.775\nWell, Service Design is doing its best\nto make sure it is ready for primetime,\n\n389\n00:21:21.775 --> 00:21:26.644\nthat there's not rework or unplanned\nlabor costs associated with having to put\n\n390\n00:21:26.644 --> 00:21:29.205\nout fires and fix things at the other end.\n\n391\n00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:33.655\n&gt;&gt; Which maybe, and just my thinking here,\nit might be considered waste.\n\n392\n00:21:33.655 --> 00:21:38.079\nBecause rework would be a waste of\ntime and then a waste of monetary\n\n393\n00:21:38.079 --> 00:21:42.110\nresources if I have to pay someone,\nwhat was the term here.\n\n394\n00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.340\nMaybe a overtime,\nthat wasn't really planned accordingly.\n\n395\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, unplanned.\n\n396\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.398\nExactly, all the above.\n\n397\n00:21:47.398 --> 00:21:52.750\nSo design coordination is trying\nto answer all the questions so\n\n398\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.990\nfully that you minimize the need for\nthat type of rework.\n\n399\n00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.026\nThere are many studies out there\nof Gartner group and others,\n\n400\n00:22:02.026 --> 00:22:04.886\nthat point to the reality\nthat it costs more to\n\n401\n00:22:04.886 --> 00:22:09.047\nput out the fires than it does to\nprevent them from ever starting.\n\n402\n00:22:09.047 --> 00:22:11.979\nSo if you design it\nappropriately it's actually,\n\n403\n00:22:11.979 --> 00:22:16.971\neven though you're gonna spend more money\nto get it designed appropriately, right?\n\n404\n00:22:16.971 --> 00:22:22.067\nInvest more, then as you get to\noperations and there's no fires,\n\n405\n00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:26.460\nyou'll get the payback for\nthat unplanned labor, etc.\n\n406\n00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.406\nFrom my own experience,\n\n407\n00:22:27.406 --> 00:22:29.844\njust an anecdotal story from my\nown experience related to this.\n\n408\n00:22:29.844 --> 00:22:35.160\nWe took a service design package\nto our project management office,\n\n409\n00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.712\nwhich was very mature\nat this organization.\n\n410\n00:22:38.712 --> 00:22:40.840\nAnd the project, and we suggested,\n\n411\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.520\nhere's the things you should consider in\nyour project scope for every project.\n\n412\n00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.860\nAnd they look at it and\nhave like 185 items on it.\n\n413\n00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.200\nSome of them are already incorporated.\n\n414\n00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.000\nI see a Turkish kind of grin a little bit,\nbecause what would the PMO would do,\n\n415\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.100\nthat's what they did to us that day, is\nthere was a guy in the back of the room.\n\n416\n00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.480\nI thought he was just ignoring us,\nbut he was busy on a spreadsheet.\n\n417\n00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.100\nAnd it came to a pause, and he said,\ndo you realize that by adding these items\n\n418\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.470\nto every one of our projects you\nwill cost us $2.3 million this year.\n\n419\n00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.860\nAnd we had not realized that,\nwe never did that math.\n\n420\n00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.460\nWe weren't ready for that conversation, to\ntell you the truth, we weren't ready for\n\n421\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.130\nthat conversation.\n\n422\n00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.580\nNow, we didn't think we were wrong,\n\n423\n00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.670\nwe thought these things were still\ngood questions to ask, right?\n\n424\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:29.190\nAnswer them now, not later,\nbecause we know it's expensive later, too.\n\n425\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.450\nWe weren't ready for that conversation.\n\n426\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.520\nSo we went back, we did our homework, and\n\n427\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.880\nwe really found out what it costs\nus to put out fires, basically.\n\n428\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.090\nA new service came to us,\nthere's fires everywhere.\n\n429\n00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:44.470\nAnd how many people involved in\nthat triage in troubleshooting.\n\n430\n00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.410\nWhat about our, even in accounting loss\nproductivity on the customer side.\n\n431\n00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.530\nThe loss of reputation.\n\n432\n00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.030\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n433\n00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.362\n&gt;&gt; We took a hit there too, right?\n\n434\n00:23:52.362 --> 00:23:56.458\nNot counting that kinda cost, just\nputting out of fire just kind of cost.\n\n435\n00:23:56.458 --> 00:24:00.949\nAnd we came back to another list that\nactually grew instead of 180 items,\n\n436\n00:24:00.949 --> 00:24:03.344\nthere are 230 items on it and we said.\n\n437\n00:24:03.344 --> 00:24:04.619\n&gt;&gt; What's going on here?\n\n438\n00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:06.386\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and we said so yeah,\n\n439\n00:24:06.386 --> 00:24:11.910\nnot only did it cost more than $2.3\nmillion to put our these fires.\n\n440\n00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:16.230\nIt should not take you, your factor for\nhow much this would cost us way off.\n\n441\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.970\nYou say we added 12 weeks to\nevery one of your projects.\n\n442\n00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.210\nIt should take you 12 weeks to\ncreate these deliverables and\n\n443\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.230\nwe can help you do that because\nwe're gonna standardize.\n\n444\n00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.909\nWe're gonna use standardized templates,\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n445\n00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:30.823\nSo we came up with a work plan and\nwhat happened was that PMO was joined with\n\n446\n00:24:30.823 --> 00:24:34.370\na brand new organization called\nthe Service Management Office.\n\n447\n00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:38.320\nSo the Project Management Office and the\nService Management Office became joined\n\n448\n00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.440\nat the hip for answering this question.\n\n449\n00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.180\nHow can we better design services, so\n\n450\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.700\nwe don't have to put out so\nmany fires, right?\n\n451\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.470\nSo, this is not just something that's\ntheoretical or I mean I've seen it work.\n\n452\n00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.070\nAnd I've seen it work in very\ntransformational ways, right?\n\n453\n00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:58.450\nIt changes the way you operate if\nyou can have well designed services,\n\n454\n00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.300\nnot just solutions but\nfully baked, fully ready to go.\n\n455\n00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.990\nAnd reinforces that's not just about\nthe technology, it's about everything that\n\n456\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.870\nwraps around this technology,\nwhich we'll take up very soon, okay.\n\n457\n00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.390\nAgain, services versus solutions.\n\n458\n00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.340\nHow do we create value through services,\nright?\n\n459\n00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.330\nIt's whatever the customer says is value.\n\n460\n00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.600\nFor the oil company, it's finding\noil faster, it's extracting it and\n\n461\n00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.243\nit's distributing it.\n\n462\n00:25:27.243 --> 00:25:34.540\nIt's also satisfying regulatory\nrequirements, safety requirements, right.\n\n463\n00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.070\nAnd to make sure that is\ndone cost effectively.\n\n464\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.800\nSo not just do it at any cause, but\n\n465\n00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.630\ndo it effectively for\ncost effectively for risks, right.\n\n466\n00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:46.605\nSo, value is often rendered than dollars.\n\n467\n00:25:46.605 --> 00:25:50.805\nBut it's also as often rendered\nin non-monetary terms.\n\n468\n00:25:50.805 --> 00:25:52.285\nBut who defines it?\n\n469\n00:25:52.285 --> 00:25:53.525\nThe customer.\n\n470\n00:25:53.525 --> 00:25:58.695\nThe customer's perception or opinion about\nvalue is the only one that really matters.\n\n471\n00:26:00.355 --> 00:26:03.285\nThat's not just ITIL speaking,\nit's just practical terms.\n\n472\n00:26:03.285 --> 00:26:08.630\nIf they think it's slow, it's slow, right?\n\n473\n00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.690\nOr they think it's too much or\ncost too much or it's not effective,\n\n474\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.280\nit's counter intuitive,\nthen their opinion matters.\n\n475\n00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.355\nIt's not that the customers are always\nright, this is their opinion so\n\n476\n00:26:19.355 --> 00:26:21.670\nwhen it matters when it comes to value.\n\n477\n00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:25.090\nOkay, so\nthey look at value through three lenses.\n\n478\n00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.980\nBusiness outcomes,\nperceptions, and preferences.\n\n479\n00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.900\nSo to close up this [INAUDIBLE] segment,\nwe'll look at this in the next segment\n\n480\n00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.980\nas relates to what is a business outcome,\nwhat is perceptions and preferences.\n\n481\n00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.370\nAnd wouldn't it be nice if we could\njust focus on business outcomes?\n\n482\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.570\nCome back for the next one and\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n483\n00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, thank you so\nmuch for joining us.\n\n484\n00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.331\nBut as you heard it yourselves,\nstay tuned,\n\n485\n00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:50.140\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n486\n00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.270\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n487\n00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.040\nRemember I'm your host, Chekoree Boose.\n\n488\n00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.079\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n&gt;&gt; See

specifically be defining\nour strategy management and\n\n8\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.940\ndesign coordination.\n\n9\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.670\nAnd back in studios,\nwe have Mr Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.810\nThank you for joining us Terry.\n\n11\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.240\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here as always.\n\n12\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.120\nAnd as we're talking about this big\npicture, we've been looking at how service\n\n13\n00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.230\nstrategy is trying to make sure that\nthe right services are being offered.\n\n14\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.110\nAnd the service design Is making\nsure the strategy is realized and\n\n15\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.790\nthat the agreements for what success looks\nlike are clear and transparent to all.\n\n16\n00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.324\nOkay, so as it relates to value,\n\n17\n00:00:51.324 --> 00:00:56.670\nthat's what the certifier has to deliver,\nvalue to the customer.\n\n18\n00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.330\nSo what's the customers' idea of value?\n\n19\n00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.780\nRight.\nSo we have to look at this slide here,\n\n20\n00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.530\nyou'll see that the customer\nconsiders value through three lenses.\n\n21\n00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.810\nBusiness outcomes,\nperception, and preferences.\n\n22\n00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.260\nIt would be nice if IT could just focus\non business outcomes right, and not have\n\n23\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.530\nto worry about these rather subjective\nideas of perception and preferences.\n\n24\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.500\nBut you can't,\nyou have to focus on perception and\n\n25\n00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.180\npreferences as well as business outcomes.\n\n26\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.780\nI'll use a non-IT example\nto kind of reinforce this.\n\n27\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.220\nImagine if the business outcome,\nyou've talked with the customers, and\n\n28\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.640\nthe business outcome is your\ncustomers want the ability\n\n29\n00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.710\nto lower the window of the car.\n\n30\n00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.330\nYou won't have the ability to\nlower the window of the car.\n\n31\n00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.470\nSo you look at your IT budget.\n\n32\n00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.800\nYou look at the regulatory risk.\n\n33\n00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.930\nYou look at the skill set you have in IT.\n\n34\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.790\nAnd you come up with the absolute\nbest solution based on those things.\n\n35\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.280\nYou know the business wants to be\nable to lower the window on the car.\n\n36\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.660\nIt needs to be cost effective,\nit needs to be risk averse and it needs to\n\n37\n00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.260\ngo ahead and match, obviously, the skills\nand capabilities of your organization.\n\n38\n00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.210\nSo you come up with the perfect\nsolution based on business outcomes,\n\n39\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.920\ncost considerations, safety,\nand regulatory risks.\n\n40\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.310\nAnd you deliver them a crank handle.\n\n41\n00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.835\nWell, they can just crank it down.\n\n42\n00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:19.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Appreciate the laughter,\n\n43\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.780\ncuz most people don't perceive as a car\nwindow being lowered as a crank handle\n\n44\n00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.070\nanymore, because expectations,\nperceptions, and\n\n45\n00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.660\npreferences have certainly moved\nthe marker on the quality of the service.\n\n46\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some kids might not even\nknow what you're talking about.\n\n47\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.020\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, good point, right.\n\n48\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.459\nSo again, kind of a silly example but\n\n49\n00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.060\nit kinda points to you satisfied\nthe business outcome, clearly.\n\n50\n00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.670\nThe window can be lowered.\n\n51\n00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.140\nIt can be lowered if you've drive\ninto a lake and lose power.\n\n52\n00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It can still be lowered, right,\n\n53\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.460\nit's easy to replace.\n\n54\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.530\nIt's easy to manufacture, right.\n\n55\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.740\nThe regulatory, the Feds aren't on our\nbutt for safety regulations, right.\n\n56\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.490\nWe have limited our regulatory risk.\n\n57\n00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.210\nBusiness, what more could you possibly,\nask for?\n\n58\n00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.150\nThis is what you need.\n\n59\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.600\nStop talking to us.\n\n60\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.570\nRight, that would be inappropriate for\nIT to do.\n\n61\n00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.120\nAgain, I've worked at IT organizations\nthat maybe weren't that bad.\n\n62\n00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.960\nBut they did have a predisposition.\n\n63\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.000\nWe know what's best.\n\n64\n00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.130\nWe know the technology.\n\n65\n00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.640\nWe know our skill set.\n\n66\n00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.090\nWe know what we can and can't do.\n\n67\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.210\nWe know what cost parameters are in play,\nrisk parameters in play.\n\n68\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.380\nUnfortunately, you can't\nget away with that.\n\n69\n00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.030\nThey may have the reception or\n\n70\n00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.230\nthe preference that it is electric window,\ncleared.\n\n71\n00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.940\nThey may even have the extra perception\nthat you don't even have to hold\n\n72\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.710\nthe button down, you just have to click it\nonce, right, and it goes down by itself.\n\n73\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.120\nAnd that also, that feature also\nserves the passenger windows, right?\n\n74\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.370\nTo heck with the people in the back seats,\n\n75\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.460\nthey didn't even have to\nwear their safety belts.\n\n76\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.670\nWe don't care about them apparently.\n\n77\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.270\nI don't know what it is about that but\nat any rate, I digress.\n\n78\n00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.700\nThe idea of this perception and\npreferences related to\n\n79\n00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.210\nthe window being lowered, what I'm\ngetting at is there is nuance in it.\n\n80\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.520\nRight?\nWhat do they want?\n\n81\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.090\nDo they want a single button push,\nor is it okay if it just holds down?\n\n82\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.860\nWhat about the upward motion?\n\n83\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.520\nDoes that need to be automatic?\n\n84\n00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.820\nIf that's also automatic,\nwhat about the pinch factor?\n\n85\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.530\nDo we have to have the automatic\ndetection and rollback?\n\n86\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.440\nI mean,\nyou see how complicated it can get, right?\n\n87\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.600\nSo knowing your customer, knowing\nwhat they might perceive or prefer,\n\n88\n00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.210\nIs as important as knowing what the actual\noutcome is that we're trying to achieve.\n\n89\n00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.320\nAs an IT server, by the way,\nyou gotta consider all the three things.\n\n90\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.970\nIs this kind of thing placed out on exam,\n\n91\n00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.480\nit really is more in the idea of\nrecognition of what the customer wants.\n\n92\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.960\nThey're not going to probably get\ninvolved in a nuanced discussion of\n\n93\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.800\nwhat's best perception or\npreference wise, right?\n\n94\n00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.030\nYou're gonna be focused on\nbusiness outcomes, surely you are.\n\n95\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.990\nBut if the scenario is playing out in such\na way where it's explicitly saying, and\n\n96\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.000\nthe customer is willing to pay for,\nblah, blah, blah and\n\n97\n00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.510\nprefers that then why would you\nignore that in your solution?\n\n98\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.410\nWould be the way that kinda plays out,\na little bit.\n\n99\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.960\nThey're willing to pay for it,\nthere is some risk involved.\n\n100\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.960\nThey're willing to pay for it, hey, go.\n\n101\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.400\nNow if on the other side of the coin,\nthey're very cost-averse,\n\n102\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.030\nkeep it as cheap as possible.\n\n103\n00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.750\nThen you also need to manage\nyour customers, in this regard.\n\n104\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.700\nSo maybe you do give them\na window that's a crank handle.\n\n105\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.986\nBut you do manage your preferences and\nyou manage your perceptions so\n\n106\n00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.907\nthey're not aghast or agog when you\nactually deliver that particular solution.\n\n107\n00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:28.350\n&gt;&gt; You might even market it as the value,\nflagship or whatever it may be.\n\n108\n00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.900\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthat's a good call Cherokee.\n\n109\n00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.240\nYou might even market it as here's what\nwe're providing you, as delivered.\n\n110\n00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.080\nWe're saving you money.\n\n111\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.040\nWe're doing this.\n\n112\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.660\nSafety regulations,\nthe Feds are off our back.\n\n113\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.880\nBlah, blah, blah, you get the idea.\n\n114\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.480\nAll right, very good.\n\n115\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.400\nNow this is a interesting graphic\nas you go to the full screen here.\n\n116\n00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:56.130\nYou'll see that value added is not really\nanything until value is realized, right.\n\n117\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.940\nAll this really means is in the service\nchain is you're trying to deliver what\n\n118\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.270\nwe're delivering today.\n\n119\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.670\nWe're trying to deliver ITIL learning\nthrough a web interface with video content\n\n120\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.770\nand experts and a hostess making\nsure everything is working well.\n\n121\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.810\nAll right, I'm adding value,\nthe technology's adding value.\n\n122\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.180\nCherokee is adding value.\n\n123\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.990\nThe lights are adding value.\n\n124\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.450\nOur editors are adding value, right?\n\n125\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.300\nWe have value added all along this\nstream of delivering this to you.\n\n126\n00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.380\nBut when does it really matter?\n\n127\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.000\nWhen you can use it.\n\n128\n00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.240\nThat's when value is actually realized.\n\n129\n00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.940\nAll these other things have to be added.\n\n130\n00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.610\nI mean we have to do these things.\n\n131\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.220\nI couldn't do it without\nthe technology being here.\n\n132\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.600\nI couldn't do it without\nCherokee being here.\n\n133\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.405\n&gt;&gt; I surely couldn't\nhost the show on my own.\n\n134\n00:06:43.405 --> 00:06:44.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, there you go.\n\n135\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.900\nSo we're all adding this value and\nthat's important.\n\n136\n00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.120\nThe technology is adding value,\npeople are adding value.\n\n137\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.320\nWe need to bring this value and\nwe're adding it.\n\n138\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.770\nWe certainly are but\n\n139\n00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.430\nvalue is not realized until the customer\ncan realize the value themselves, right?\n\n140\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.210\nSo you're gonna get subscribers.\n\n141\n00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.120\nYou're gonna get members.\n\n142\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.330\nYou're going to get people viewing, right?\n\n143\n00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.920\nThat's gonna be your measurement of,\nare they finding value in this?\n\n144\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.200\nPerhaps they provide feedback.\n\n145\n00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.510\nPerhaps they pass the exam and\nsay hey thanks a lot,\n\n146\n00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.090\nI couldn't have done that without you,\nthose kinds of things, right?\n\n147\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.770\nThat's what we're trying to get done here\nas value being realized on behalf of\n\n148\n00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.730\ncustomers.\n\n149\n00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.910\nWe're not doing this for\nany other reason, right?\n\n150\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.170\nValue to customers is the focus, right?\n\n151\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.840\nAnd of course, we get to make some money\nalong the way, you get to pass exams along\n\n152\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.728\nthe way and that's why we're trying\nto generate the value being realized.\n\n153\n00:07:32.728 --> 00:07:36.490\nOkay, all right.\n\n154\n00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.670\nAgain nothing magical about that\nconcept just pretty straightforward.\n\n155\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.037\nRealizing that value realized is not\nthe same thing as value being added.\n\n156\n00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.491\nMy goodness,\nwhat does service design have in scope?\n\n157\n00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:54.162\nI mentioned earlier in quite\ngeneric terms, answering all\n\n158\n00:07:54.162 --> 00:07:59.777\nthe questions that need to be answered\nbefore it gets into transition.\n\n159\n00:07:59.777 --> 00:08:01.765\nBefore you even start\nbuilding the service,\n\n160\n00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:04.720\nyou answer all the questions\nthat need to be answered.\n\n161\n00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's kind of interesting\nlooking at different disciplines and\n\n162\n00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.930\nbodies of knowledge.\n\n163\n00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.400\nAnd when we talk about project management,\nthey might have their own approach to it.\n\n164\n00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.550\nYou'll see that first phase, or section,\nor however they want to word it, but that\n\n165\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.550\nplanning is always going to be where most\nof the work is happening, right Terry?\n\n166\n00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.380\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n167\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.340\nGetting that right is also so\npredictive of the success.\n\n168\n00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.660\nGetting that wrong,\nyou're less successful.\n\n169\n00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.510\nIf you plan inappropriately,\nyou'll put out fires later, basically,\n\n170\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.900\nis what it points to.\n\n171\n00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.720\nSo, that means, there's a lot in scope.\n\n172\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.820\nWhat is the scope of service design?\n\n173\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.970\nEvery question that needs to be asked and\n\n174\n00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.890\nanswered before you even go to the next\nstage which I took all service transition.\n\n175\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.990\nWhich is a stage yet\nbefore service operations.\n\n176\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.490\nQuite early in the process.\n\n177\n00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.510\nAnd also keep in mind that these\ndon't operate in a vacuum.\n\n178\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.280\nService design is gonna be operating\nunder constraints of time and money and\n\n179\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.560\nresources, right?\n\n180\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.770\nJust as any project might, right?\n\n181\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.940\nSo operating within those constraints\nto answer all the questions\n\n182\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:14.110\nas fully as possible before moving forward\nis the goal and scope of service design.\n\n183\n00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.840\nAnd design coordination, that would be\nthe process that makes that happen.\n\n184\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:25.230\nNow the output, as defined by ITIL,\nis called a service design package, right?\n\n185\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.800\nThe service design package is the package.\n\n186\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.860\nIt's a good name for it.\n\n187\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.890\nIt is what is required before service\ntransition can actually get started\n\n188\n00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.510\nand moving on their work, right?\n\n189\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.462\nNow some of these things\ncan happy in parallel.\n\n190\n00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:41.779\nIt's not like when this is complete,\nservice transition has to wait for\n\n191\n00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:43.080\neverything.\n\n192\n00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.230\nBut the service design package is\ngoing to be the culmination of\n\n193\n00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.270\nall the artifacts required,\nall the questions being answered.\n\n194\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.810\nSo I'll give you an example.\n\n195\n00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.660\nIf you're involved perhaps in\nthe software development life cycle,\n\n196\n00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.240\nsome of this might be familiar to you.\n\n197\n00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.510\nYou come up with business requirements,\n\n198\n00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.400\nyou come up with functional\nrequirements for the solution.\n\n199\n00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.120\nMaybe that leads to system requirements,\n\n200\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.860\nwhich leads to a technical specification\nor a design specification.\n\n201\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.835\nAll those things I just mentioned,\nbusiness requirements, functional system,\n\n202\n00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:18.820\ndesign spec,\nall those things end up being artifacts,\n\n203\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.450\ndocuments, something that's written\ndown and understood and agreed.\n\n204\n00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.170\nMaybe come up with\na solution architecture,\n\n205\n00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.790\nwhich shows the big picture of client\nservers and how they talk to each other.\n\n206\n00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.351\nOr maybe it's an application diagram.\n\n207\n00:10:33.351 --> 00:10:35.265\nPerhaps there's a test strategy,\n\n208\n00:10:35.265 --> 00:10:38.800\nhow you're gonna effectively\ntest this solution.\n\n209\n00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.290\nWhat's the test plan, right?\n\n210\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.750\nSo software development and\nservice design have a lot in common.\n\n211\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:49.270\nIn fact, service design Is going to\nhave within scope the solution, right.\n\n212\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.970\nSo solution development,\n\n213\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.850\nsoftware development could definitely\nbe a factor of service design, right.\n\n214\n00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:03.780\nBut all these artifacts, these documents\nare answers to important questions\n\n215\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.830\nand these are all formulated into\nwhat's called a service design package.\n\n216\n00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.277\nNow I'm not, ITIL is not saying this,\n\n217\n00:11:11.277 --> 00:11:15.210\nthis anecdotal information on the way\nthat I've seen this executed.\n\n218\n00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.920\nWe executed in a form of a checklist.\n\n219\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.130\nImagine an Excel spreadsheet with all\nthe deliverables, business requirement,\n\n220\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.960\nsystem requirement, design spec,\npackage configuration,\n\n221\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.330\nwhatever the deliverables were,\ntest strategy, test plan, right?\n\n222\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:34.050\nTest results and again it ended\nup being about 230 items long.\n\n223\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.700\nAll of the things that\nshould be delivered for\n\n224\n00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.740\nfull understanding of a service,\nwhat processes need to be fined?\n\n225\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.170\nHow are we going to measure it?\n\n226\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.330\nWhat does success look like?\n\n227\n00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.650\nHow are we going to\ncapture the measurement?\n\n228\n00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.182\nWhat's the availability management plan?\n\n229\n00:11:47.182 --> 00:11:49.920\nWhats the capacity management plan?\n\n230\n00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.370\nAgain, a lot of things, right?\n\n231\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.670\nSo, all those things in one little\nspreadsheet were just checklist items but\n\n232\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.320\nif it was delivered,\nif the business requirements.\n\n233\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.630\nThe question was,\nhave business requirements been agreed?\n\n234\n00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:08.290\nYes, and the last column was a link\nto the business requirements.\n\n235\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.590\nSo if anyone ever want the reference\nthe business requirements,\n\n236\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.350\nthere they were, right?\n\n237\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:18.320\nSo again, imagine a list of 230 items and\nthings that should be considered for\n\n238\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.310\nevery service design and then you could\nhave a link to every one of those\n\n239\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.720\nartifacts, or\ndocuments if you will ready for it.\n\n240\n00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.610\nAgain, that's not being\nprescripted in any way.\n\n241\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.600\nI'm just giving you an idea of the scope\nof the service design package,\n\n242\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.340\nIt's not a trivial matter.\n\n243\n00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.810\nSo design coordination,\nsince this is not a trivial matter.\n\n244\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.460\nAnd remember the scenario I gave you\nearlier, where we went to the PMO and\n\n245\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.330\ngave them this list?\n\n246\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.280\nAnd they laughed us out of the room,\nright?\n\n247\n00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.310\nWe needed to get good at this.\n\n248\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:52.360\nSo design coordination is not just trying\nto get this done on a one-off measure.\n\n249\n00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.970\nThey're trying to get this done in\na repeatable, predictable measure so\n\n250\n00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.840\nthey can plan their work appropriately,\nbudget appropriately and\n\n251\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.330\ntherefore deliver services on time, on\nbudget and with the appropriate quality.\n\n252\n00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.770\nAll right.\n\n253\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.540\nSo here this is in graphical form.\n\n254\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.840\n&gt;&gt; This looks interesting.\n\n255\n00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's what I just talked about,\nin graphical form.\n\n256\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n257\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.340\n&gt;&gt; So it is.\n\n258\n00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.890\nIt's interesting and\nit kinda small font here, too.\n\n259\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.970\nThere's really nothing new on this slide.\n\n260\n00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.980\nIt's just a great place to come and\nsee it all one place.\n\n261\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.230\nIf you look at the top in the upper\nleft just high level just high\n\n262\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.190\nlevel here in the top shaded\narea is what the business wants.\n\n263\n00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.703\nWhat are they trying to do?\n\n264\n00:13:31.703 --> 00:13:36.379\nWe need to satisfy the business\nrequirements through a business\n\n265\n00:13:36.379 --> 00:13:40.370\nservice A or business service B or\nbusiness service C.\n\n266\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.600\nWe're talking about what\nthe business is trying to get done.\n\n267\n00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.400\nI'll equate that to your company.\n\n268\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.700\nBusiness service A, find the oil.\n\n269\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.120\nBusiness server B, extract it.\n\n270\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.560\nBusiness server C, distribute it, right?\n\n271\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.320\nBig picture was the business we\nare trying to do and then what services,\n\n272\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.510\nwhat IT services as what you see in\nthe middle between the two shaded areas.\n\n273\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.399\nWhat IT services support that activity?\n\n274\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.640\nRight, managing that,\ngetting that mapped out.\n\n275\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.320\nThat's what strategy's doing,\ngetting that mapped out, and\n\n276\n00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.690\nthen passing down to service design,\nmake this real.\n\n277\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.150\nDesign services that can do that for us.\n\n278\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.990\nOkay, that's it in a graphical form.\n\n279\n00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.040\nNo need to skirt the details there.\n\n280\n00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.160\nSo at a high level then that's\nwhat service strategy and\n\n281\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.120\nservice design are trying to\ndo through two boss hog or\n\n282\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.350\nmother hen processes, strategy manage for\nIT services and design coordination.\n\n283\n00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:42.070\nStrategy is trying to ensure that\nthe right services are being offered to\n\n284\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.829\nthe right customers at the right\ntime at the right cost.\n\n285\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.990\nService design is trying to\nrealize that strategic initiative\n\n286\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.370\nof right services at the right time.\n\n287\n00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.850\nTogether then, service strategy and\n\n288\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.960\nservice design are ensuring that\nthe right services are delivered on time,\n\n289\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.930\non budget, and with the level of quality\nthat they were designed to deliver.\n\n290\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.770\nOkay, so\nto recap these things we just talked about\n\n291\n00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:12.780\nrelated to service design\nare these five major aspects.\n\n292\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:18.060\nYou may recall from a foundation\nthat was called Stamp,\n\n293\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:23.270\nwhere we talked about service\nsolutions being one of the aspects.\n\n294\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.200\nWe are certainly talking about technology.\n\n295\n00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.750\nAll right, services solutions,\nnew or changed services.\n\n296\n00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.340\nBeing in scope, and\n\n297\n00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:35.240\nthe sort of solutions form the bases of\nmany services because it's the technology.\n\n298\n00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.970\nI mean, we're in IT so\nwe do provide technology solutions, right?\n\n299\n00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.750\nThe next part, the T is for tools,\nmanagement information system and tools.\n\n300\n00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:50.680\nThis is for IT, so while service\nsolutions are focused on costumer needs,\n\n301\n00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.320\ntools are focused on IT needs.\n\n302\n00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.447\nIT needs tools, they need systems\nto help themselves right?\n\n303\n00:15:56.447 --> 00:16:00.428\nYou need development platform,\nyou need servers,\n\n304\n00:16:00.428 --> 00:16:04.236\nyou need the ability to Batch processes,\nright?\n\n305\n00:16:04.236 --> 00:16:06.649\nYou might need accelerators,\nweb accelerators,\n\n306\n00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:08.170\nthose types of things, right?\n\n307\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:13.880\nYou need the ability to manage\nthe information in these systems as well.\n\n308\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.760\nSo while the first one, service solutions,\nis focused on customer technology,\n\n309\n00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.870\nto tools is focused on IT\ntechnology consumed by IT, right.\n\n310\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.610\nNow as you go to number three,\ntechnology and\n\n311\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:30.110\nmanagement architectures\nthe stamp the a part of it.\n\n312\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.900\nNotice that architectures\nincludes technology but\n\n313\n00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.110\nalso includes management architectures.\n\n314\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.180\nMeaning you have the right interfaces\nwithin and between your organizations.\n\n315\n00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.050\nManagement architectures.\n\n316\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.230\nSo you have the right way to\norganize your technology, but\n\n317\n00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.210\nyou also have the right way\nto organize the people.\n\n318\n00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.590\nAnd this includes the people within\nthe service organization and\n\n319\n00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.670\namong them, as well as the people\nbetween the service organization and\n\n320\n00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.140\nThe customer organization,\nif you will, right.\n\n321\n00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.710\nSo the ability to enable CEOs and\n\n322\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.810\nCIOs to speak IT steering committees,\nfor instance.\n\n323\n00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:11.390\nAnd the ability for\nusers to also talk with the service desk.\n\n324\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.630\nRemember at that one layer so.\n\n325\n00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.740\nSo organizational architectures\nare also in play.\n\n326\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.860\nService design needs to consider\nhow that's going to work.\n\n327\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.610\nOf course you also have processes in play.\n\n328\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.030\nAll right,\nwhich processes make it effective?\n\n329\n00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.330\nIn a previous life I was responsible for\nchange configuration and\n\n330\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.310\nmanagement processes, those three.\n\n331\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.500\nAnd they're big, in and of themselves\nespecially in a large organization.\n\n332\n00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.240\nAnd I was taking on a new service, it was\nan existing service, and we were going to\n\n333\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.850\nmanage it, and this particular service\nrequired a hundred changes a day.\n\n334\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:55.450\nI never operated a service required so\nmuch change so often right, no way.\n\n335\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.010\nSo the process that I had in placed for\nchange configuration.\n\n336\n00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.940\nAnd release management were not\neffective for that new service.\n\n337\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.860\nSo as a design element,\nI needed to recognize that and say,\n\n338\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.730\nokay, timeout, we're not going to\nbring this service on fully live\n\n339\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.860\nuntil we can figure the process is\ngonna serve this particular monster.\n\n340\n00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n341\n00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.030\n&gt;&gt; So that's, again,\na process consideration.\n\n342\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.930\nLet's bring it down perhaps\nto a more generic approach.\n\n343\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:26.770\nConsider the processes for\nenabling mailboxes.\n\n344\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.550\nIt's one thing to have an email service,\nit's another thing to make sure that email\n\n345\n00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.890\nis available for that employee\non the first day of work right?\n\n346\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.600\nSo how are you going to interface?\n\n347\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.510\nRemembering talking about architectures,\norganizational architectures.\n\n348\n00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.420\nHow is HR gonna organizationally\ninterface with IT to make\n\n349\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:48.510\nsure a new hire has an e-mail inbox\non their first day of employment.\n\n350\n00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully they figured that\nout before the first day that employee\n\n351\n00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.690\nshowed up to work.\n\n352\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:54.945\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully they did.\n\n353\n00:18:54.945 --> 00:18:56.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Understood that that's not\n\n354\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.870\njust this happened though.\n\n355\n00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You have to design it.\n\n356\n00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.350\nYou have to figure out\nhow is that gonna happen.\n\n357\n00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.360\nWhat is the interface between\nthe HR department and IT.\n\n358\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.350\nWe know how to create an inbox.\n\n359\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.330\nWe have the technology.\n\n360\n00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.760\nWe can go into Exchange and\ncreate an inbox easily, right.\n\n361\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.080\nBut we need identity management,\n\n362\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.382\nwe need a user id\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n363\n00:19:13.382 --> 00:19:14.650\nI mean IT department,\n\n364\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.930\nit's not my place to say, Terry,\nwhat you should be allowed access to.\n\n365\n00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:18.990\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n366\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.140\nSo, you get the idea that these\ninterfaces need to built and therefore,\n\n367\n00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.050\nthe processes it supports.\n\n368\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.690\nThese interfaces need to be built, right?\n\n369\n00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.050\nSo service design is a lot more than\njust standing up exchanging, saying hey,\n\n370\n00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.650\nwe got an email service.\n\n371\n00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.120\nYou gotta build these other things out,\nright?\n\n372\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:40.330\nAnd then measurement methods and metrics,\nbeing able to measure success, right?\n\n373\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:41.610\nIf you look at the full screen here,\n\n374\n00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.450\nyou'll see that it's\nnot just measuring IT.\n\n375\n00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.260\nBut are you moving the needle on\nbehalf of the business, right,\n\n376\n00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.460\nis also a great metric to capture.\n\n377\n00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.840\nSo staying with this email example,\n\n378\n00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.240\nwhat does success look like for\ninbox provisioning?\n\n379\n00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.810\nMaybe you do a metric for\n\n380\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.230\npercentage of new hires that have\nan inbox, the first day of employment.\n\n381\n00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.140\nMaybe you keep score like that, right?\n\n382\n00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.920\nOr how long it takes Right, to get one,\n\n383\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.390\nan inbox for a new employee,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n384\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.970\nSo maybe they don't have\nit on the first day because\n\n385\n00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.390\nyou couldn't work at that process.\n\n386\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.170\nHR and\nIT couldn't ever get it that well with us.\n\n387\n00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Maybe they don't have a work station or\na laptop issued to them.\n\n388\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.730\nSo why would an email account be required?\n\n389\n00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:22.270\n&gt;&gt; Cheers.\n\n390\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.360\nAll of the above, right?\n\n391\n00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.100\nAll those things could be playing in.\n\n392\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.060\nSo what are you gonna measure, right?\n\n393\n00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.330\nWhat does success look like and\nin this case you're looking for\n\n394\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.910\nthose measurements, it makes sense for\nIT and for business.\n\n395\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.400\nAgain this is what service design\nis considering before you ever go\n\n396\n00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.250\nlive, right?\n\n397\n00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.880\nYou're considering before you\neven bring this into transition\n\n398\n00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.660\nbecause what you want to do in transition\nis have these questions answered.\n\n399\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.990\nSo you can build the appropriate systems.\n\n400\n00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.200\nService Solutions.\n\n401\n00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.640\nYou can have the right system and\ntools in place for IT.\n\n402\n00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.760\nYou can have the right organizational\narchitectures in place.\n\n403\n00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.740\nYou can have the right processes in place.\n\n404\n00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.700\nAnd you'll be able to measure\nwhat success looks like.\n\n405\n00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.390\nDo this before you go into transitions\nis what Itl is suggesting.\n\n406\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.910\nSo test takers, you're going to be\nlooking at dysfunction basically.\n\n407\n00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.540\nYou're gonna be looking\nat scenario questions\n\n408\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.280\nthat somehow point to problems\nin this regime, right?\n\n409\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.800\nMaybe you're weak at business\nrelationship management.\n\n410\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.170\nMaybe you're weak at service\nportfolio management.\n\n411\n00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.620\nYou're gonna see the scenario\ndescribe the weaknesses.\n\n412\n00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.800\nYou're going to have to apply\nthe appropriate approaches,\n\n413\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.160\nto shore up those weaknesses.\n\n414\n00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.460\nSo understanding the design as\na big holistic environment and\n\n415\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.648\nthat strategy is trying to deliver the\nright service at the right time is key.\n\n416\n00:21:39.648 --> 00:21:44.308\nAll right, good.\n\n417\n00:21:44.308 --> 00:21:48.020\nSo, again, it kind of starts with\nwhat are the service requirements.\n\n418\n00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.470\nWhat does the business\nneed to be successful?\n\n419\n00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.950\nRemember the window crank, right?\n\n420\n00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.250\nThat's certainly going to be part of that,\nwhat is it gonna look like?\n\n421\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.750\nHow scalable is the solution?\n\n422\n00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.510\nHow many users are gonna be using it,\nright?\n\n423\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.450\nWhat processes are in play,\nwhat functionality needs to be there?\n\n424\n00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.750\nWhat utility and warranty,\nyou see those in parenthesis there, right?\n\n425\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.590\nWhat utility and warranty.\n\n426\n00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:16.410\nWarranty is a good target for\nactual targeted metrics right?\n\n427\n00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:21.960\nSo warranty is kind of the sweet spot for\nmeasuring because\n\n428\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.790\nthese are things that are measurable and\nnot subject to so much opinion right?\n\n429\n00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.120\nYou can measure satisfaction.\n\n430\n00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.020\nYou can say how do you like the workflow?\n\n431\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.160\nIs it intuitive?\n\n432\n00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.560\nAnd you can do surveys\nof people's opinion.\n\n433\n00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.530\nAnd turn those into metrics,\nand you should, right?\n\n434\n00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.790\nBut warranty is,\nis the service up or is it down?\n\n435\n00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.720\nHow long was it down?\n\n436\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.960\nHow long did it take us to get it back up,\nright?\n\n437\n00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.570\nThose are things that are measurable.\n\n438\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:52.210\nIf a user calls and says,\nit was slow today, define what slow is.\n\n439\n00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:52.860\nYou can define time.\n\n440\n00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.360\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n441\n00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.330\n&gt;&gt; You could say if fifteen seconds slow,\nwell for that user it is everyday.\n\n442\n00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.470\nEveryone else is happy\nwith fifteen seconds but\n\n443\n00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.720\nthis one user thinks it's slow.\n\n444\n00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.810\nWell, what's the SLA?\n\n445\n00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.340\nWhat's the service level agreement say?\n\n446\n00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.670\nThe service agreement says slow\nis twenty seconds or longer.\n\n447\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.380\nBut we've agreed to this now.\n\n448\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.230\nStop complaining about the 15 seconds.\n\n449\n00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:17.030\nSorry sir, sorry maam but\nwe are in an SLA type of thing.\n\n450\n00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:21.800\nSo warranty lends itself\nto measurement right?\n\n451\n00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.970\nBut you need to determine what\nthese measurements are and\n\n452\n00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.910\nMake sure everyone agrees to what\nthe metrics are trying to tell us and\n\n453\n00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.150\nthat they do actually spell success.\n\n454\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.200\nIt's possible to go into a service\nreview meeting with all green metrics.\n\n455\n00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.630\nEverything looks good.\n\n456\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:40.960\nYou're satisfying all requirements,\nfrom a measurement side.\n\n457\n00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.920\nBut you could still have a dissatisfied\ncustomer because the utility is bad.\n\n458\n00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.200\nOr the SLA's measuring the wrong things,\netc, right?\n\n459\n00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.890\n&gt;&gt; Going back to what you'd mentioned.\n\n460\n00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.669\nIt really just boils\ndown to that customer.\n\n461\n00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:57.387\nSo if you're within that SLA time of the\n20 seconds, but then they go back and say,\n\n462\n00:23:57.387 --> 00:24:02.107\nwell, new research finds that people like\nto have this particular service handed to\n\n463\n00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:03.644\nthem within 10 seconds.\n\n464\n00:24:03.644 --> 00:24:05.153\nSo then you're kind of like, wait, what?\n\n465\n00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:06.319\nAnd then revisit.\n\n466\n00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:07.359\n&gt;&gt; Right, good call.\n\n467\n00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:09.512\nAnd what if your competition's\ndelivering in five seconds.\n\n468\n00:24:09.512 --> 00:24:11.109\nRight, that could be\na competitive factor too.\n\n469\n00:24:11.109 --> 00:24:13.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, or it could be a cost metric.\n\n470\n00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.710\nI know I used to hear this\none in desktop provisioning.\n\n471\n00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:22.140\nWe came up with a model where,\nused to the way we provisioned\n\n472\n00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.150\nlaptops was you got a laptop and\nyou kept it for three years.\n\n473\n00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.720\nIt got off its depreciation schedule,\nat the end of that one, there was a date\n\n474\n00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.870\nright there on the asset tag, after\nthat when you could request a new one.\n\n475\n00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.830\n&gt;&gt; That's how we do it here, three years.\n\n476\n00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.680\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense because it goes along\nwith your financial management regime just\n\n477\n00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.060\nfine, right?\n\n478\n00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.310\nUsers don't really care about that so\nmuch.\n\n479\n00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.065\nOkay, I'll just live with it,\nall right, I'll live with it.\n\n480\n00:24:45.065 --> 00:24:50.609\nBut they changed that model, say if\na business unit is willing to pay for it.\n\n481\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.580\n&gt;&gt; Before that three\nyears expiration period\n\n482\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.504\n&gt;&gt; Then we'll cross charge the business\n\n483\n00:24:55.504 --> 00:24:58.637\nunit and they can have a laptop\nwhen ever they want it, right?\n\n484\n00:24:58.637 --> 00:25:02.311\nSo they want a new new laptop before their\nthree year expiration, they can get one,\n\n485\n00:25:02.311 --> 00:25:03.696\nbut we're gonna charge them.\n\n486\n00:25:03.696 --> 00:25:08.850\nThat's a new model right and\nthen we show them what it would cost.\n\n487\n00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:09.840\nAnd the business said what?\n\n488\n00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.463\nYou're charging me $1,800 for a laptop?\n\n489\n00:25:12.463 --> 00:25:14.841\nFor $1,800 I can go to Best Buy and\n\n490\n00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:18.760\nget a laptop that will kick\nthat laptop's butt right?\n\n491\n00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.850\nThis is silly.\n\n492\n00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:20.930\nWhy would I pay $1,800 for\n\n493\n00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.950\nthe laptop you want to sell me when I\ncan go to Best Buy and get another one?\n\n494\n00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.850\nAnd then of course,\nIT has to have an answer for that.\n\n495\n00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:35.450\nSo, the answer from IT would be well, what\nyou get for $1800 is full 24/7 support.\n\n496\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.698\nWe'll replace the battery at no charge,\nright?\n\n497\n00:25:37.698 --> 00:25:40.891\nYou can come to this kiosk and\nwe'll swap out the battery.\n\n498\n00:25:40.891 --> 00:25:44.091\nA mouse just malfunctions,\nwe'll give you a mouse.\n\n499\n00:25:44.091 --> 00:25:44.601\nWe got lots of things.\n\n500\n00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:48.634\n&gt;&gt; Versus how much does our on\nsite staff get paid per hour?\n\n501\n00:25:48.634 --> 00:25:50.500\nDo the calculations, there's your answer.\n\n502\n00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nthere's your math, exactly.\n\n503\n00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.590\nSo you get the idea.\n\n504\n00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:57.280\nSo what I'm getting at there is\nthat whatever your perceptions are,\n\n505\n00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.220\nyou're gonna have to manage them, right?\n\n506\n00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.590\nSo you do have competition out there.\n\n507\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:02.550\nAll right, moving forward here.\n\n508\n00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.890\nSo, what are we trying to do,\nas you look at the full site here.\n\n509\n00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.110\nYou gotta have good information.\n\n510\n00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.310\nWhat is the business trying to do?\n\n511\n00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.950\nNow, in parentheses here is that\nthere is a process that actually\n\n512\n00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.430\ndoes these things by definition,\nService Portfolio Management.\n\n513\n00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.750\nSo the details of this we're gonna\nget into later and soon, right?\n\n514\n00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:31.670\nBut effectively what service strategists\nneed to understand is what currently\n\n515\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:32.900\nare your services?\n\n516\n00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.120\nWhat services are you offering, right?\n\n517\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.988\nWhat services should you be offering?\n\n518\n00:26:37.988 --> 00:26:41.180\nAnd are there services that\nno longer providing value\n\n519\n00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.525\nthat should be retired, right?\n\n520\n00:26:43.525 --> 00:26:46.318\nService strategy,\nthis is a cyclical thing.\n\n521\n00:26:46.318 --> 00:26:48.378\nThis is ongoing,\nlike it's not even cyclical.\n\n522\n00:26:48.378 --> 00:26:51.905\nIt's always, right,\nthis should be happening all the time.\n\n523\n00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:55.530\nA service provider should be discerning,\n\n524\n00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:00.300\nin a methodical way,\nwhat services should we offer,\n\n525\n00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.610\nwhat servers are we offering, or\nwhat services should be retired, right?\n\n526\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.640\nAnd perhaps, if I look at ITPro.TV\nas an example, perhaps you\n\n527\n00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.610\nbase this on not just the service, but\nthe content as part of your service.\n\n528\n00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.870\nShould we have a different content area?\n\n529\n00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.946\nShould we enhance our forum\ndiscussion differently?\n\n530\n00:27:19.946 --> 00:27:24.538\nShould we focus on deliverable\ndownloads or discernible downloads?\n\n531\n00:27:24.538 --> 00:27:27.699\nI mean there could be different ways that\nyou could enhance perhaps the utility of\n\n532\n00:27:27.699 --> 00:27:29.009\nyour service that you consider.\n\n533\n00:27:29.009 --> 00:27:33.192\nNot necessarily totally revamping\nyour service, it's just changing it\n\n534\n00:27:33.192 --> 00:27:37.800\npotentially, not just new services or\nexisting or retired services.\n\n535\n00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.368\nSo at a strategic level, you're trying\nto get this done in a regular, again,\n\n536\n00:27:42.368 --> 00:27:44.640\nI couldn't even call it cyclical.\n\n537\n00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.580\nIt's always going on, okay?\n\n538\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.390\nSo to get that done,\nwhat value are you providing?\n\n539\n00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.840\nYou need to have specific information\nabout what the customer needs.\n\n540\n00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.390\nI keep going back to the oil company.\n\n541\n00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.510\nCuz it's pretty succinct,\nthe three things they wanna do.\n\n542\n00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.150\nThey wanna find it, they wanna extract it,\nthey wanna distribute it.\n\n543\n00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.300\nThat's what they're trying to get done.\n\n544\n00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.570\nThe subsets of that,\nthat you do it safely,\n\n545\n00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:10.040\nthat you do it transparently\nto satisfy regulators, right?\n\n546\n00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.230\nAnd they need to do it quickly, so\nspeed is also part of it, right?\n\n547\n00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.780\nSo it's one thing to have utility side,\nyou need to have the warranty side too.\n\n548\n00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.500\nBut it's broken down into\nfairly reasonable bits of\n\n549\n00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.990\nwhat you're trying to get done.\n\n550\n00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.739\nRight, what's a hospital trying to do?\n\n551\n00:28:26.156 --> 00:28:27.270\n&gt;&gt; Cure patients.\n\n552\n00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.481\n&gt;&gt; Take care of patients,\nmanage their records, distribute drugs.\n\n553\n00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:33.160\nI mean,\nyou get into some of those subprocesses.\n\n554\n00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.630\nDistribute the drugs,\n\n555\n00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.840\nmake sure they're the right drugs\nto the right patients, right?\n\n556\n00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.290\nDon't kill anybody, right?\n\n557\n00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a plus.\n\n558\n00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.420\n&gt;&gt; It's a plus, right?\n\n559\n00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.260\nSo you get the ideas of what\nthe objectives are, and\n\n560\n00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.770\nIT needs to support those objectives.\n\n561\n00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:50.310\nFor a pharmaceutical company\nlike I used to work for,\n\n562\n00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.580\nit was discover the drugs, right?\n\n563\n00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.040\nDiscover what a good drug might be,\nmaybe get a patent on it,\n\n564\n00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.940\nand have exclusive sales for a while.\n\n565\n00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:01.837\nDiscover a drug, distribute it,\nmanufacture it, etc, all right,\n\n566\n00:29:01.837 --> 00:29:03.418\nand of course sell it.\n\n567\n00:29:05.478 --> 00:29:09.909\nSo to get this done for any new service,\nyou have to come up with a business case,\n\n568\n00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:11.160\nall right?\n\n569\n00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.000\nA business case,\nnothing magical about the definition here.\n\n570\n00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.560\nJust wanna remind you, it's a way\nto support your decisions, right?\n\n571\n00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:20.820\nWhat's it gonna cost?\n\n572\n00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.670\nWhy do we wanna do it?\n\n573\n00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:22.770\nWhat value we wanna get out of it?\n\n574\n00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.266\nIs there gonna be a return\non investment for this?\n\n575\n00:29:25.266 --> 00:29:27.690\nAre we trying to mitigate a risk?\n\n576\n00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.000\nAre we trying to save money?\n\n577\n00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.280\nAre we trying to sell more widgets?\n\n578\n00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.530\nDiscover more oil?\n\n579\n00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:32.802\nWhat's the business trying to do?\n\n580\n00:29:32.802 --> 00:29:37.490\nWhy do we wanna invest this amount of\nmoney in that particular service, etc?\n\n581\n00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:39.930\nNow not all things can\nbe rendered in numbers.\n\n582\n00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.280\nOr I should say dollars.\n\n583\n00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.088\nWhat's the monetary value of email?\n\n584\n00:29:48.239 --> 00:29:49.140\n&gt;&gt; You know.\n&gt;&gt; How do we even do that?\n\n585\n00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.830\n&gt;&gt; I wondered this.\n\n586\n00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.191\nI guess the particular analysts,\nthey really, I've seen.\n\n587\n00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:57.690\nWhen you look at PII, for example,\npersonally identifiable information, and\n\n588\n00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.469\nyou talk about what is\nthe cost per user identity as\n\n589\n00:30:00.469 --> 00:30:04.180\nfar as any kind of identity theft and\nthings like that?\n\n590\n00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.030\nThey actually do come up\nwith monetary values.\n\n591\n00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.090\nAnd I feel like that would be kind of\na difficult job to kind of assess that and\n\n592\n00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:14.690\nreally just analyze,\nto attach that monetary value to,\n\n593\n00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.880\nbasically, qualitative information.\n\n594\n00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.260\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's tough.\n\n595\n00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.050\nAnd sometimes it's absolutely\nnecessary to get to that dollar value.\n\n596\n00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:24.990\nYou need to know the cost of these\nthings and protecting information.\n\n597\n00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.810\nHIPPA regulations,\n\n598\n00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:31.520\nwhat's the cost of coming up with ways to\nmaintain the privacy of medical records.\n\n599\n00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.550\nWhat's it cost us to do that?\n\n600\n00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.330\nIt's gonna cost you.\n\n601\n00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.800\nWell you gotta do it cuz the feds say\nyou gotta do it, so you gotta do it.\n\n602\n00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.443\nBut what's the risk if you don't?\n\n603\n00:30:39.443 --> 00:30:40.100\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n604\n00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:46.170\nReputation, lose patients,\nget fined perhaps.\n\n605\n00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:50.630\nSo sometimes it's perhaps an easier\nway to get to that dollar figure.\n\n606\n00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.330\nPerhaps it's a harder journey\nto get to that dollar figure.\n\n607\n00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:57.980\nEither way the customer perceives or\ndetermines what this value is.\n\n608\n00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.250\nAnd if it's rendered in\ndollars then find the dollars.\n\n609\n00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.390\nIf it's rendered in risk mitigation,\nthen find out here.\n\n610\n00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:07.230\nIf it's rendered in speed,\nwe need to be faster at this.\n\n611\n00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:12.130\nIf it's rendered in warranty, the heart\nmonitor never goes down in the ICU unit.\n\n612\n00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.690\nOkay, that's good, it never goes down.\n\n613\n00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:15.940\nWe're talking about life and death here.\n\n614\n00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.450\nThe value is people don't die.\n\n615\n00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:18.955\nOkay, we get that value.\n\n616\n00:31:18.955 --> 00:31:23.316\nYou just make sure it's there.\n\n617\n00:31:23.316 --> 00:31:28.444\nThis idea of pre-programme ROI,\nnothing magical about this definition,\n\n618\n00:31:28.444 --> 00:31:31.340\nas we kind of end this\ndiscussion on money.\n\n619\n00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.890\nMoney is certainly a driver, right.\n\n620\n00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:38.210\nBut coming up with a pre-programme\nreturn on investment\n\n621\n00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.510\nbasically is your predictive piece.\n\n622\n00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.356\nWhat do we expect to get out of this?\n\n623\n00:31:42.356 --> 00:31:47.175\nSomething that is gonna be embedded\ninto your business case is what can we\n\n624\n00:31:47.175 --> 00:31:49.790\nexpect to get out of this right?\n\n625\n00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.464\nNow the technique's for\nfunding capital budgeting is used here.\n\n626\n00:31:53.464 --> 00:31:56.902\nWe're gonna talk about financial\nmanagement a little bit later on but\n\n627\n00:31:56.902 --> 00:32:00.689\nwe're not gonna get to this level of\nnuance about capital versus operational\n\n628\n00:32:00.689 --> 00:32:01.340\nbudgeting.\n\n629\n00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.909\nProjects are often funded with capital\ninvestment Pieces of infrastructure often\n\n630\n00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:07.801\nsupport of a capital investment,\n\n631\n00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:12.060\nbecause you have a tangible thing you\ncan depreciate over years, right?\n\n632\n00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.330\nBut we're also talking about\noperating services as well.\n\n633\n00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.670\nSo operational expenses also come in.\n\n634\n00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.130\nSo as this things merge,\n\n635\n00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:24.950\nthis data sets merge, your pre-program\nROI is what are we gonna spend?\n\n636\n00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:28.310\nAnd how long is it gonna take\nbefore we either get more money, or\n\n637\n00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.050\nwe recoup our savings?\n\n638\n00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.339\nBasically, is what it's about.\n\n639\n00:32:31.339 --> 00:32:36.040\n&gt;&gt; And Terry, I know from IT security\nperspective, it could also be,\n\n640\n00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.699\nwhat are we not losing?\n\n641\n00:32:37.699 --> 00:32:38.359\nAnd I don't know of a better\nway to reword that.\n\n642\n00:32:38.359 --> 00:32:39.751\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good call, yeah.\n\n643\n00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:41.488\n&gt;&gt; But sometimes it's not so obvious.\n\n644\n00:32:41.488 --> 00:32:46.188\nAnd that's where you kinda have to push\na little bit harder to obtain that new\n\n645\n00:32:46.188 --> 00:32:52.500\nhardware security module or something that\ndoesn't have necessarily a visible ROI.\n\n646\n00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.920\n&gt;&gt; Agree, and\nit couldn't be stated more clearly.\n\n647\n00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.700\nIt's a great example.\n\n648\n00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.526\nHow do you invest in\nrisk mitigation factors?\n\n649\n00:32:59.526 --> 00:33:02.410\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And how do you get value out of that?\n\n650\n00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.669\nAgain, sometimes hard to get\nthat dollar amount on there.\n\n651\n00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.210\nIf you have regulatory requirements\nthat are mandating it, then, well,\n\n652\n00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:09.890\nyou have to do it.\n\n653\n00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.550\nYou have to obey the law.\n\n654\n00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.760\nBut, what about just\nthe reputational pieces?\n\n655\n00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.376\nI mean, if Amazon.com accidentally\nlost my credit card information,\n\n656\n00:33:18.376 --> 00:33:21.320\nI'm gonna be upset at Amazon.com, right?\n\n657\n00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.490\nThey have an interest in keeping me\nas a customer by making sure they\n\n658\n00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:28.820\nknow my transactions are safe, right,\nand secure, that type of thing.\n\n659\n00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.270\nIf they could put a monetary value on\nthat, losing Terry as a customer, or\n\n660\n00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.460\nas a regulatory value on that,\nthey'll get fined by the feds.\n\n661\n00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.020\nWhatever they're doing, it's kind of a no\nbrainer, we have to keep this secure.\n\n662\n00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.174\nOur business model means we're\ngoing to invest in security.\n\n663\n00:33:42.174 --> 00:33:44.070\nSimple as that.\n\n664\n00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.480\nSo that's the nature of this beast.\n\n665\n00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.653\nIs that as you considering service\nstrategy and service design,\n\n666\n00:33:48.653 --> 00:33:52.229\nyou're going to be operating within\nthe constraints of time and money and\n\n667\n00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:54.460\nresources, that's for sure.\n\n668\n00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:01.140\nIf you targeted through a, say if\nthe academics on a exam are focused,\n\n669\n00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.760\non let's save some money, then be clear,\ngo save money in your answer, right?\n\n670\n00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:11.100\nThe scenario will point to\nthe explicit nature of return on\n\n671\n00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.500\ninvestment being rendered in dollars.\n\n672\n00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.490\nAnd if it's so explicit,\n\n673\n00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:18.670\nthen you need to find answers that are\nexplicitly addressing saving money, right?\n\n674\n00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.120\nFind the connection there.\n\n675\n00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.875\nIf it's more value on investment,\nVOI, then obviously,\n\n676\n00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:30.380\nthe range are a bit looser,\nin terms of definition, okay?\n\n677\n00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.960\nSo again, at a very high level that's\nthe big picture of strategy and\n\n678\n00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.560\ndesign, thinking about how to deliver\nthe right services at the right time,\n\n679\n00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.130\nto the right customers.\n\n680\n00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:43.461\nAnd to make sure that all the agreements\nof what success looks like are fully\n\n681\n00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:46.499\nunderstood and articulated for\nall stakeholders.\n\n682\n00:34:48.372 --> 00:34:53.585\nOkay, so as I mentioned in the setup here,\nthere's opportunities for you to go and\n\n683\n00:34:53.585 --> 00:34:58.368\nlearn on your own, and that's going\nto be good motivation to self-study.\n\n684\n00:34:58.368 --> 00:35:02.422\nAnd there's a specific exercise related to\nsome of these topics we've talked about.\n\n685\n00:35:02.422 --> 00:35:04.945\nThat exercise is called\nGeneric Role activities.\n\n686\n00:35:04.945 --> 00:35:09.106\nSo it's one of the downloads of that\ntitle, Generic Role activities.\n\n687\n00:35:09.106 --> 00:35:11.656\nThe suggested timing's about 20 minutes.\n\n688\n00:35:11.656 --> 00:35:12.888\nAnd again, what's it gonna focus one?\n\n689\n00:35:12.888 --> 00:35:15.822\nIt's gonna focus on the process owner,\nprocess manager, and\n\n690\n00:35:15.822 --> 00:35:19.265\nprocess practitioner roles,\nas well as the service owner.\n\n691\n00:35:19.265 --> 00:35:22.605\nSo it gets your juices\nflowing in your self-study.\n\n692\n00:35:22.605 --> 00:35:24.165\nIt's a pretty easy one to do.\n\n693\n00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:24.965\nAnd again,\n\n694\n00:35:24.965 --> 00:35:29.022\nit's just getting you into discipline\nof following up with self-study.\n\n695\n00:35:29.022 --> 00:35:33.540\nRemember, self-study is also\ngonna include some exam practice.\n\n696\n00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.350\nWe'll get to that a little bit later.\n\n697\n00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.507\nWe're not quite ready to go and\npractice any of the exams just yet.\n\n698\n00:35:38.507 --> 00:35:39.940\nBut that is where we're at.\n\n699\n00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.957\nThat concludes the part about\nthe big picture strategy and design,\n\n700\n00:35:43.957 --> 00:35:48.269\nforming the basis of all of our learning\nthroughout the rest of the show.\n\n701\n00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:52.482\nAnd next up, we're gonna start diving\ninto the processes themselves,\n\n702\n00:35:52.482 --> 00:35:56.990\nthe set of processes we're talking about,\nthe real meat of the course.\n\n703\n00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.840\nAnd the first one of those processes\nis Service Portfolio Management.\n\n704\n00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.063\nSo enjoy yourself, study,\nremember those downloads,\n\n705\n00:36:03.063 --> 00:36:07.450\nthey're in the upper righthand\ncorner there from Show Files.\n\n706\n00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:10.210\nAnd enjoy that, and let us know if you\nhave any questions through the forum.\n\n707\n00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry.\n\n708\n00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.280\nLadies and gentlemen,\nyou heard it yourself right from the man.\n\n709\n00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.350\nWe've got some homework to do.\n\n710\n00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.200\nBut that's all right,\ngreat information there.\n\n711\n00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.810\nSo thank you, and thank you,\nladies and gentlemen, for joining us.\n\n712\n00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.420\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n713\n00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.990\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n714\n00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.930\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n715\n00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:26.700\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n716\n00:36:26.700 -->

00:00:11.795\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:14.970\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL Service Offerings\nand Agreements series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.074\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:20.830\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look\nat service portfolio management.\n\n7\n00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.340\nAnd with us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr.Terry Decker.\n\n8\n00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.558\nThank you for joining us today, Terry.\n\n9\n00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.350\n&gt;&gt; As always, Cherokee, happy to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.950\nWhat's up in this particular episode\nis an examination of the process called\n\n11\n00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.610\nservice portfolio management.\n\n12\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.080\nIn fact, the next several episodes\nyou're gonna be dealing with processes.\n\n13\n00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.110\nThe seven processes that are in scope for\nthis particular course.\n\n14\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.870\nSOA, service offerings and agreements.\n\n15\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.860\nSo, as we look at the slides here,\nservice portfolio management.\n\n16\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.660\nI want you to look at it as a tool,\nthe service portfolio.\n\n17\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.375\nIt's the deliverable, if you will,\n\n18\n00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:56.910\nof service portfolio management;\nit's gonna be the dataset.\n\n19\n00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.620\nBut I also want you to consider and\n\n20\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.250\naccentuate your learning\nregarding the process.\n\n21\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.233\nThink more about the process of service\nportfolio management as opposed to\n\n22\n00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.393\nthe actual deliverable, the tool set.\n\n23\n00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:10.554\nBecause, honestly,\nin any given environment,\n\n24\n00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:13.080\nthe tool set's gonna manifest\nitself in different ways.\n\n25\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.150\nThere's no one way to define what\nthis deliverable needs to look like.\n\n26\n00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.380\nWe'll give some general parameters of\nwhat kind of data should be included\n\n27\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.934\nin this portfolio, we certainly will.\n\n28\n00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:26.804\nBut academically speaking, and\neven operationally speaking,\n\n29\n00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:31.096\nit's going to be necessary to understand\nthe management process before\n\n30\n00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:32.874\nyou understand the tool set.\n\n31\n00:01:32.874 --> 00:01:36.208\nThe tool set is gonna\nfollow the process anyway.\n\n32\n00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:39.048\nAcademically speaking,\nthat's also important,\n\n33\n00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:42.667\nbecause you're not gonna be asked\nto design an IT tool on the exam.\n\n34\n00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:46.762\nYou're not gonna be asked to design\nin detail a service portfolio.\n\n35\n00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:49.390\nYou need to understand what\nit is in a big picture.\n\n36\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.020\nAnd you need to understand what\ndata points it needs to have, but\n\n37\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.810\nnot design the full thing.\n\n38\n00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.870\nSo, as we learn about\nthe portfolio management process,\n\n39\n00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.610\nI want you to focus more on the process.\n\n40\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.660\nAnd not the derivable called\nthe service portfolio, itself.\n\n41\n00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.570\nNow, we can't extract them completely,\nwe're gonna be talking about them both.\n\n42\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.660\nThe reason why I find\nit's very important is,\n\n43\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.650\nlater on we're gonna be talking about a\nprocess called service catalog management.\n\n44\n00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.055\nAnd as you'll remind yourself\nfrom your foundation course,\n\n45\n00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.136\nthe service catalog is\na portion of service portfolio.\n\n46\n00:02:19.136 --> 00:02:24.726\nSo another point of potential confusion\nis where does the portfolio tool end and\n\n47\n00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:26.150\nthe catalog begin?\n\n48\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.400\nThat's kind of a non-starter,\nthey're integrated,\n\n49\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.960\nthey're part of the same\ndeliverable if you will.\n\n50\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.370\nSo, if you think about the processes,\nhowever,\n\n51\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.100\nthere is a clear different mandate for\neach of the different processes.\n\n52\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.010\nThey have different scope,\ndifferent process flows, etc.\n\n53\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.080\nSo think about the process\nmore than the tool.\n\n54\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.750\nI invite you to do that to kind of save\nyourself some sanity as you try to\n\n55\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.670\npiece this thing together.\n\n56\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.750\nAll right, so\nwhat is the portfolio itself, right?\n\n57\n00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.960\nWhat you're trying to do with\na portfolio is describe what services\n\n58\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.120\nare meeting what business outcomes.\n\n59\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.790\nSo it's a way that you can\nmap up what you have and\n\n60\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.600\nwhat you don't have as relates to\nwhat's the business trying to get done.\n\n61\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.427\nSo as you look at the full screen\nof this particular PowerPoint.\n\n62\n00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:19.872\nYou'll see that your trying to answer\nquestions as why should a customer buy\n\n63\n00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:21.550\nthis service?\n\n64\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.690\nWhy they should buy it from you.\n\n65\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.725\nWhat's the pricing and\ncharge back options?\n\n66\n00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:28.714\nWhere are your strengths and\nwhere are your weaknesses?\n\n67\n00:03:28.714 --> 00:03:30.108\nWhat's in the pipeline for later?\n\n68\n00:03:30.108 --> 00:03:33.180\nMaybe you already have\nan improvement plan in place, right?\n\n69\n00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.190\nSo you can see that you're being\ntransparent with what services\n\n70\n00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.960\nyou're offering.\n\n71\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.120\nBut in a way you're also being transparent\nabout what you could be offering, right?\n\n72\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.754\nSo this is getting engaged with your\ncustomers at a meaningful level.\n\n73\n00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:47.530\nNow, a lot of the process\nis behind the scenes.\n\n74\n00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.540\nIT is not gonna necessarily, expose\nthe whole portfolio to their customers.\n\n75\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.850\nThey'll certainly expose one part of it.\n\n76\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.210\nThe catalog, those operational services,\nbut not necessarily all of them.\n\n77\n00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.571\nSo again, think about the process more so\nthan the tool set.\n\n78\n00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:06.550\nAnd I think you're gonna find\nthe academics a little bit more easier to\n\n79\n00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.320\nswallow, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.530\nSo as we go through then, what is\nthe purpose of the process at large?\n\n81\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.270\nBasically to allow the provider to\nmake sure that the right services\n\n82\n00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.010\nare being offered.\n\n83\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.280\nThe right balance of services in\nterms of funding risk mitigation.\n\n84\n00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.510\nWhat business outcomes are being served.\n\n85\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.010\nAgain, if you imagine that Barnes and\n\n86\n00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.580\nNoble IT organization before Amazon.com\nand the services they were offering.\n\n87\n00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.108\nThey offered IT services and\nan online presence.\n\n88\n00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:40.050\nYou could order a book online and go pick\nit up at the brick and mortar store.\n\n89\n00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.080\nOr pay a bit more for shipping.\n\n90\n00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.470\nBack in the day it was just you wanted to\ngo and have a nice cup of coffee anyway.\n\n91\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.638\nSo you went and had a cup of coffee,\n\n92\n00:04:46.638 --> 00:04:50.670\nsit in a cushy chair, and you got\nyour book there from the front desk.\n\n93\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.205\nNot a bad business model,\nthey had kiosks in the store.\n\n94\n00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:59.000\nSo if I walked in as the customer I could\ngo to the kiosk or I could ask a clerk,\n\n95\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.310\nwhere is this book?\n\n96\n00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.880\nFirst time I did it,\nthe clerk showed me how the kiosk works.\n\n97\n00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.740\nVery clever, I came back to subsequent\nvisits, I used the kiosk itself.\n\n98\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.950\nPretty cool, I liked Barnes and\nNoble, I liked their IT solutions.\n\n99\n00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.510\nBut Amazon.com changed their\nbusiness model quite a bit, right?\n\n100\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.868\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't really see things like\nthe dewy decimal system being really\n\n101\n00:05:20.868 --> 00:05:22.550\nutilized that often.\n\n102\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.497\n&gt;&gt; No, exactly, right,\ndifferent ways of managing these things.\n\n103\n00:05:25.497 --> 00:05:28.030\nThey're gonna show you a rack number,\nand you're gonna get there.\n\n104\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.645\nSo you go to libraries, of course,\nit's even changed by this, right?\n\n105\n00:05:31.645 --> 00:05:35.196\nSo, again, you're changing where\nyou are as a portfolio manager,\n\n106\n00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:38.300\nyou need to look at what\nthe business is trying to get done.\n\n107\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.200\nWhat are the outcomes that\nare being desired and\n\n108\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.140\nare your services supporting\nthose outcomes, right?\n\n109\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.060\nSo you're gonna be looking\nat the right costs,\n\n110\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.420\nare you tracking\nthe investment appropriately?\n\n111\n00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.930\nWe'll look later at the details\nof tracking investment through\n\n112\n00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.170\nfinancial management.\n\n113\n00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.698\nBut portfolio has a stake in what\nthese services cost as a process.\n\n114\n00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:02.800\nAnd also, make sure you're\nworking with other processes.\n\n115\n00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.290\nHave you got the balance right?\n\n116\n00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.420\nYou're gonna be working with designers.\n\n117\n00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.060\nYou're gonna be working\nwith transition and\n\n118\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.570\noperations folks to make sure that\nwhat you're offering is sufficient.\n\n119\n00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.230\nOr are there new technologies\nthat can be put into play?\n\n120\n00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.910\nAgain, consider back in the day\nmainframe dummy terminals\n\n121\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.970\nwould client server with desktop\napplications be more effective, right?\n\n122\n00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.180\nThat sort of thing, right?\n\n123\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.900\nAnd then full circle\nback to cloud services,\n\n124\n00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.122\nwhich seems like just a web\ndevice that can connect and\n\n125\n00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:34.070\nuse application services that\nare being hosted, right.\n\n126\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.990\nSo, again, technology shifts,\ncustomers need shifts.\n\n127\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.360\nPortfolio management's here to\nunderstand as those things shift,\n\n128\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.925\nare we continuing to offer the right\nvalue through our services, right?\n\n129\n00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:47.880\nFocused on business outcomes.\n\n130\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.480\nSo the objectives of service portfolio\nmanagement is to make sure that you can\n\n131\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.460\nfollow these potential services\nthroughout their lifecycle.\n\n132\n00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.172\nSo that you can capture\nthe appropriate value statements.\n\n133\n00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:06.530\nSo that you can approve the right services\nand therefore design the right services.\n\n134\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.758\nAnd ultimately you're\nalso trying to determine,\n\n135\n00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:11.878\nare the services that we currently have,\nare they still adding value?\n\n136\n00:07:11.878 --> 00:07:15.510\nOr is it time to retire them,\nor to replace them, right?\n\n137\n00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.350\nSo which ones are still viable,\nwhich ones still aren't?\n\n138\n00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.680\nWhich ones should we be offering,\nthat we're currently not?\n\n139\n00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.363\nAre there additional customers we could\nprovide our existing services to?\n\n140\n00:07:25.363 --> 00:07:27.170\nThat type of thing, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.000\nSo the scope of service\nportfolio management.\n\n142\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.820\nAll services that are planned to be\ndelivered, that's called the pipeline.\n\n143\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.500\nYou might recall from your foundation\nclass, that there's three portions of\n\n144\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.700\nthe portfolio, the pipeline,\nthe catalog, and retired services.\n\n145\n00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.489\nThe pipeline's that portion of\nthe portfolio that describes services\n\n146\n00:07:48.489 --> 00:07:50.731\nthat could be approved, right?\n\n147\n00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:52.614\nThey're under consideration, right?\n\n148\n00:07:52.614 --> 00:07:55.207\nServices that are currently\nbeing delivered or\n\n149\n00:07:55.207 --> 00:07:58.975\nhave already been approved for\ndelivery are in the catalog portion.\n\n150\n00:07:58.975 --> 00:08:01.554\nAnd then, of course,\nthose services that have been.\n\n151\n00:08:01.554 --> 00:08:05.780\nDetermined they're gonna be no\nlonger funded, or already did, or\n\n152\n00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.500\nin the retired services portion\nof the portfolio, right?\n\n153\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.710\nSo again, that's the tool set, pipeline,\ncatalog, and retired services.\n\n154\n00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.220\nYou also need a process to evaluate\nthe movement into the pipeline,\n\n155\n00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.970\nfrom pipeline into catalog, and\nfrom catalog into retired services.\n\n156\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.070\nSo it's one thing to have\nthe data set in a tool.\n\n157\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.720\nIt's another thing to have a methodical\nprocess that does the ongoing evaluation\n\n158\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.240\nof your services, so\nthat you're moving them into and\n\n159\n00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.130\nout of each of these different\nportions of the portfolio, right?\n\n160\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.482\nThat's what service\nportfolio management is, and\n\n161\n00:08:40.482 --> 00:08:44.100\nagain why I encourage you to consider\nthe process as your primary motivation for\n\n162\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.280\nlearning now and not how are you going\nto design this data model that keeps up\n\n163\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.520\nwith the pipeline,\ncatalog, retired services?\n\n164\n00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.095\nThat's really kind of\na nonstarter academically.\n\n165\n00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:57.020\nAnd it's even a nonstarter operationally,\nyou gotta get the process right first\n\n166\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.372\nbefore you can understand what your\ndata sets gonna look like, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:04.650\nAll right, so why do this?\n\n168\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.740\nWhy have portfolio management, right?\n\n169\n00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.740\nIs there operating question?\n\n170\n00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.030\nWhat value does it add to the business?\n\n171\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.220\nWell if it's purpose is to make sure\nyou're offering the right services,\n\n172\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.790\nthat one of the values it adds\nis offering the right services.\n\n173\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.960\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I mean, if we were sitting\nhere explaining study material for\n\n174\n00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.760\nan exam that didn't even exist anymore.\n\n175\n00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.813\nMaybe if it had got revamped and\nthere was a new series,\n\n176\n00:09:27.813 --> 00:09:29.565\nthen it probably would be pointless,\nright?\n\n177\n00:09:29.565 --> 00:09:32.671\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, are we delivering\nthe right things at the right time for\n\n178\n00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:36.417\nthe right customers is what's portfolio\nmanagement's trying to get done, right?\n\n179\n00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:39.932\nSo if you're doing that well then\nthe output is you're delivering\n\n180\n00:09:39.932 --> 00:09:42.860\nthe right services at the right time,\nright?\n\n181\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.150\nIt gives you a basis for\ncost and risk control, right?\n\n182\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.062\nIt allows you to more effectively\nunderstand the cost and\n\n183\n00:09:49.062 --> 00:09:52.786\nrisk of your existing services or\npotential services, or even the cost of\n\n184\n00:09:52.786 --> 00:09:56.528\nexisting services that are no longer\nproviding the right value, right?\n\n185\n00:09:56.528 --> 00:10:01.216\nTo pay for an expensive service\nthat has very little value,\n\n186\n00:10:01.216 --> 00:10:06.089\nit could be an item on the chopping block,\nor for redesign, or\n\n187\n00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:08.274\na drastic change, right?\n\n188\n00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:13.800\nAll right, so,\ninteresting here the term industrialized.\n\n189\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.790\nFrequently organizations rush to\nindustrialize service outcomes\n\n190\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.220\nwithout having a strategy in place.\n\n191\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm gonna need some explanation there too.\n\n192\n00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:21.685\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, interesting term.\n\n193\n00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:26.960\nReally, what this simply means is you get\ninto the, yes, we can do that, right?\n\n194\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.180\nOrganizations do this at large.\n\n195\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.688\nIT organizations also can do this,\nwhere you rush to,\n\n196\n00:10:32.688 --> 00:10:38.869\nthis would be great, let's go do it,\nright, and then you start doing it.\n\n197\n00:10:38.869 --> 00:10:41.134\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like what our\nsales team does to us?\n\n198\n00:10:41.134 --> 00:10:42.439\n&gt;&gt; Sales teams are classic at this.\n\n199\n00:10:42.439 --> 00:10:44.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n200\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.822\n&gt;&gt; I understand,\n\n201\n00:10:44.822 --> 00:10:46.980\nI'm not sure how it's playing out for\nITProTV.\n\n202\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n203\n00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.243\nI've certainly been involved where sales\npeople over promise, wouldn't it be great?\n\n204\n00:10:51.243 --> 00:10:52.489\nAnd they go ahead and make the promise.\n\n205\n00:10:52.489 --> 00:10:53.910\n&gt;&gt; Look, we've got to do this.\n\n206\n00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.970\n&gt;&gt; Now we got to do this, exactly.\n\n207\n00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.600\nI get that dynamic.\n\n208\n00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.980\nSo yeah, effectively your saying,\nyes we can do that.\n\n209\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.020\nWe wanna please, we wanna please,\nand you go, right?\n\n210\n00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.360\nTaking a step back to say wait a minute,\ntime out.\n\n211\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.880\nWhat value are we gonna get out of this?\n\n212\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.340\nWhat's the cost, and do that measurement?\n\n213\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.660\nAnd also do the risk.\n\n214\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.120\nHow much risk's involved in this,\nand mitigate that or evaluate that?\n\n215\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.980\nSo cost, risk, benefit analysis needs\nto be some necessary first steps.\n\n216\n00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.934\nAnd that's what\nService Portfolio Management does.\n\n217\n00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:28.300\nI've seen this done poorly,\nwe rush to a decision.\n\n218\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.750\nI give you a brief example where we were\ngoing to build a business intelligence\n\n219\n00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:38.040\nsolution for one of our divisions,\nand we did it to specification.\n\n220\n00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.956\nWe did it well, on time, on budget.\n\n221\n00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:46.770\nAnd we spent 1.5 million pounds,\nI think it was, over the course of about\n\n222\n00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.450\neight months, developing this centralized\nservice for business intelligence.\n\n223\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.730\nEffectively what we were doing was,\nwe were intending to tear down\n\n224\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.560\nlocal BI solutions that were\nin each of the markets, and\n\n225\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.950\nconsolidate into a single BI solution.\n\n226\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.910\nAnd you could see that the no\nbrainer business case would be\n\n227\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.220\ninstead of having eight\ndifferent separate solutions,\n\n228\n00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.820\nmaintained by eight different separate\nteams, we'll have a single solution\n\n229\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.570\nscalable with fewer people running it and\nsatisfying all the folks all around.\n\n230\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.140\nIn the meantime what the strategist\ndid at the business level\n\n231\n00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.590\nis they decided also change the metrics\nthat we're gonna be recorded\n\n232\n00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.040\nin this business intelligence solution.\n\n233\n00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.210\nThey were changing the reporting\nparameters at the same time.\n\n234\n00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.311\nSomething that business\nhave been wanting to do.\n\n235\n00:12:31.311 --> 00:12:35.312\nSo the business wanted to consolidate\nall of these different markets,\n\n236\n00:12:35.312 --> 00:12:36.988\nso on a common set of metrics.\n\n237\n00:12:36.988 --> 00:12:38.670\nThey each had their separate metrics.\n\n238\n00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.260\nGood idea, make sense.\n\n239\n00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.850\nOff we went, a month and\na half pounds later,\n\n240\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:50.300\nand eight months of project time,\nwe put out the system.\n\n241\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:56.495\nFor the next 18 months, the number of\nusers totalled to about 12, right?\n\n242\n00:12:56.495 --> 00:13:00.995\nWhen an organizations got in this\nparticular part of the division had\n\n243\n00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:05.108\n3,000 sales people,\nminimal 3,000 sales people,\n\n244\n00:13:05.108 --> 00:13:09.080\nanother 500 sales managers on\ntop of those sales people.\n\n245\n00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:09.610\n&gt;&gt; So what happened?\n\n246\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:16.390\n&gt;&gt; No one changed the compensation\nprogram for the sales people,\n\n247\n00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.240\nso they wanted to look at metrics that\nrelated to what their bonus potential was.\n\n248\n00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.480\nSo they continue to go to\ntheir local BI solutions,\n\n249\n00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.530\nbecause that is the needle\nthey cared about.\n\n250\n00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.503\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; They went there, no one actually\n\n251\n00:13:29.503 --> 00:13:35.743\nchanged the methods to motivate sales\nteams to even go look at this business.\n\n252\n00:13:35.743 --> 00:13:38.130\n&gt;&gt; Restructure that bonus plan.\n\n253\n00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, so again,\nwe can point fingers whose fault was this?\n\n254\n00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.070\nBut effectively what happens was, this\nwas in collaboration with the business,\n\n255\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.910\nthis wasn't just IT going off\non a wild goose chase saying,\n\n256\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.140\nmaybe we can sell this to them.\n\n257\n00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.910\nNo, it was a collaborative effort\nbetween business leaders and\n\n258\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:58.100\nIT leaders to deliver a solution that,\non paper had really good ideas.\n\n259\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.510\nGet it approved, go, right?\n\n260\n00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:05.070\nAnd what end up happening was, the\nbusiness processes around this business\n\n261\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.460\nintelligence was changed in\na significant way that would cause\n\n262\n00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.200\npeople to actually want to use this\nbusiness intelligence meaningfully, right?\n\n263\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.440\nSo until that happened it was\nkind of a non-starter service.\n\n264\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.300\nIt just kind of hung out there\non the vine a little bit.\n\n265\n00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.620\nTwelve people used it to\nbasically as a prototype.\n\n266\n00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.030\nNow it wasn't a complete loss.\n\n267\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.200\nWe develop some centralized\ncapabilities that we didn't have before\n\n268\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.930\nin business intelligence and\nin this particular sales organization.\n\n269\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:37.950\nThat was marketable to other business\nunits within the same organization.\n\n270\n00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.800\nSo we gained some capabilities,\nwe developed a service methodology, and\n\n271\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.020\nwe begin to find opportunities\nto provide that same service\n\n272\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.160\nto other parts of the business.\n\n273\n00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.947\nWhether those are sells organization,\nmanufacturing organization.\n\n274\n00:14:50.947 --> 00:14:53.840\nSo we kind of made lemonade with\nthe lemons that we brought, but\n\n275\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.497\nthe nature of the bees was, we kind of\nwent out there, hey that's a great idea,\n\n276\n00:14:57.497 --> 00:14:59.868\nlet's go and\nwe didn't answer all the questions.\n\n277\n00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:04.278\nIt said, what it made this better is you\nforgot our business processes aligned with\n\n278\n00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:05.727\nthis particular change and\n\n279\n00:15:05.727 --> 00:15:10.162\nmanage that change in parallel with the\ntechnology changes we are bringing about.\n\n280\n00:15:10.162 --> 00:15:12.840\nJust as an example, right?\n\n281\n00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.583\nSo Portfolio Management as a process\nis going to be making sure you\n\n282\n00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.492\nare asking the question.\n\n283\n00:15:19.492 --> 00:15:22.199\nWhat is the value to the business and\n\n284\n00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:26.541\nhow is that business value\ngoing to be realized, right?\n\n285\n00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:29.725\nAnd if you do so\nat the portfolio management level,\n\n286\n00:15:29.725 --> 00:15:33.946\nyou're gonna be less likely to come\nup a man and half pounds later and\n\n287\n00:15:33.946 --> 00:15:39.390\n26 months later scratching your head,\nwhy are only 12 people using this, right?\n\n288\n00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.940\nSo again, just as an example, right?\n\n289\n00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.669\nSo if you answer these questions more\neffectively early, as in the earliest\n\n290\n00:15:45.669 --> 00:15:49.355\nstage called service strategy,\nthrough service portfolio management.\n\n291\n00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:53.957\nYou're gonna have a better idea of\nmaximizing return on investment,\n\n292\n00:15:53.957 --> 00:15:56.460\ninstead of throwing out some limits.\n\n293\n00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.896\nOkay, all right.\n\n294\n00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:04.248\nSo how does service portfolio, it can't\ndo this is in a vacuum, by the way,\n\n295\n00:16:04.248 --> 00:16:08.872\nthe portfolio consist of these three\nlocations, the portfolio at large consist\n\n296\n00:16:08.872 --> 00:16:12.750\nof the catalog and the pipeline and\nretired services, right?\n\n297\n00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.480\nIt also can link up with\nother management system\n\n298\n00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.810\nsuch as your configuration management\nsystem and your application portfolio.\n\n299\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.800\nOn the next server slides we're gonna be\nlooking at the portfolio is a set of data\n\n300\n00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.370\nfor a particular process called\nService Portfolio Management.\n\n301\n00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:31.710\nBut we're gonna see how it's necessarily\ngonna interact with other processes, and\n\n302\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.060\npotentially other data systems, okay?\n\n303\n00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:42.868\nAll right, and the list goes on, customer\nportfolio, customer agreement portfolio,\n\n304\n00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:47.910\nproject portfolio, service models,\nmarket spaces, etc.\n\n305\n00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:52.010\nSo each of these is going to be discussed\nin some details we go down through.\n\n306\n00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.830\nNow, what this is saying is\nService Portfolio Management has a lots of\n\n307\n00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.460\nscope, right?\n\n308\n00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.800\nIn terms of what are the impacts,\n\n309\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.850\nService Portfolio Management has\na limited scope in what actually it does.\n\n310\n00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.720\nBut it interfaces with other ones.\n\n311\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.590\nThe Customer Portfolio, as an example.\n\n312\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:12.710\nThe Customer Portfolio is\na listing of all your customers.\n\n313\n00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:16.119\nThis is a deliverable of a process\ncalled business relationship management.\n\n314\n00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.880\nThe Customer Agreement Portfolio is\nalso a list of all your agreements.\n\n315\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.590\nThis is under the remit of\nservice level management, right?\n\n316\n00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:29.650\nSo again, Service Portfolio Management\nis not responsible for\n\n317\n00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.490\nthe customer portfolio.\n\n318\n00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.165\nService Portfolio Management\nis not responsible for\n\n319\n00:17:34.165 --> 00:17:36.012\nthe customer agreement portfolio.\n\n320\n00:17:36.012 --> 00:17:39.658\nBut doesn't it kind of make sense\nthat if you're trying to match\n\n321\n00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:42.899\nup your services to the value\nthey provide to customers,\n\n322\n00:17:42.899 --> 00:17:45.950\nthat it would be good to know\nwhat your customers are?\n\n323\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.959\nWould it be good to know what\nagreements you already have in place\n\n324\n00:17:47.959 --> 00:17:48.600\nwith them, right?\n\n325\n00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.700\nAnd on and on, the project portfolio,\nthe same thing.\n\n326\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.720\nService Portfolio Management is not\na project management discipline.\n\n327\n00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.820\nBut knowing what projects are already in\nplay, and whether or not they're gonna be\n\n328\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.610\ndelivering a service and when they're\ngonna be delivering that service.\n\n329\n00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.660\nObviously, there's gonna be some\ninterface between project management and\n\n330\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.720\nService Portfolio Management\nas time goes on.\n\n331\n00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.598\nThose are just examples of how\nService Portfolio Management, not only\n\n332\n00:18:12.598 --> 00:18:16.795\nat a data level could be interacting with\nother data sources such as this, but\n\n333\n00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:19.076\nalso interacting with other processes.\n\n334\n00:18:19.076 --> 00:18:20.662\nOkay, all right.\n\n335\n00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:25.460\nSo what is a portfolio about?\n\n336\n00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.190\nIt really is about, are we spending\nthe right money on the right things?\n\n337\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.780\nAnd you can't really do\nthat unless you know what\n\n338\n00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.407\nbusiness value you're trying to deliver,\nright?\n\n339\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.330\nSo managing investment is part\nof financial management, but\n\n340\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.290\nunderstanding the value is part\nof Service Portfolio Management.\n\n341\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.239\nRight, understanding what value\nis being delivered, right?\n\n342\n00:18:47.313 --> 00:18:51.573\nSo if you wanna change this portfolio, if\nyou want to add something to the pipeline,\n\n343\n00:18:51.573 --> 00:18:54.813\nif you wanna move something from\nthe pipeline into the catalog,\n\n344\n00:18:54.813 --> 00:18:57.400\nin other words make a service live.\n\n345\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.420\nIf you wanna take a service\nthat is currently live and\n\n346\n00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.070\nretire it, that's not a trivial matter,\nnone of those things are trivial.\n\n347\n00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.987\nWhat gets into the pipeline,\nwhat gets into the catalog, what gets into\n\n348\n00:19:06.987 --> 00:19:11.674\nretired services, and the movement between\nthose things is something that obviously\n\n349\n00:19:11.674 --> 00:19:15.741\nneeds to be governed through methodical\nprocesses and policies, right?\n\n350\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.277\nAll right,\nHere's a graphical representation of\n\n351\n00:19:21.277 --> 00:19:24.140\nwhat we we're talking about\na little bit earlier.\n\n352\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.750\nThe service portfolio there at the top\nconsists of those three components,\n\n353\n00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.250\nthe pipeline, the catalog and\nretired services.\n\n354\n00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.890\nIn this particular\ngraphical representation,\n\n355\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:36.170\nyou can see that it's linked to underlying\nconfiguration management system.\n\n356\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.800\nI'll give you a brief example of that.\n\n357\n00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.787\nLet's say your CMS, your configuration\nmanagement system, has a list of\n\n358\n00:19:43.787 --> 00:19:48.394\nall the servers, all the databases\nthat are used by a given service.\n\n359\n00:19:48.394 --> 00:19:52.500\nAgain, service portfolio management\nis not responsible for the CMS.\n\n360\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.096\nBut wouldn't it be powerful\nif you could link your list\n\n361\n00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:58.910\nof services which is there on the catalog,\n\n362\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:03.150\nto the underlying complexity of\nthe components underneath it?\n\n363\n00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.670\nThe CMS could also include information\nabout how many incidents a given services\n\n364\n00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:13.620\nhad, or how many changes\na particular device has had, right?\n\n365\n00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.685\nSo you can get an idea of how complex or\nhow busy the service is underneath it.\n\n366\n00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:21.335\nUltimately, you could couple\nthat type of data and\n\n367\n00:20:21.335 --> 00:20:25.120\ninformation with financial\nmanagement data and information.\n\n368\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.795\nLink it up to service catalog and kinda\nunderstand the real cost of the service.\n\n369\n00:20:30.795 --> 00:20:33.765\nSo now you have ability\nat the portfolio level to\n\n370\n00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:37.657\ndo a comparison of cost of service\nversus value of service, right?\n\n371\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.600\nAnd try to drive down the cost or\nincrease the value as you grow.\n\n372\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.230\nSo underneath the CMS,\nyou can see these various portfolios or\n\n373\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.000\nsources of information.\n\n374\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.541\nYou got contract management, supplier and\ncontract management information,\n\n375\n00:20:53.541 --> 00:20:58.430\napplication portfolio,\ncustomer portfolio, customer agreement,\n\n376\n00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:03.280\nproject portfolios,\nconfiguration management databases.\n\n377\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.800\nAll of these data, if you can\nlink it together would be great.\n\n378\n00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.230\nNow, test takers keep in mind,\nyou're not gonna have to design this.\n\n379\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.280\nIn any kind of way,\nyou're not gonna have to design it.\n\n380\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.410\nThis is aspirational, service portfolio\nitself should be able to link up\n\n381\n00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.700\nwith your underlying datasets,\nsuch as this.\n\n382\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.971\nIt is aspirational, very powerful,\nif you can integrate this.\n\n383\n00:21:26.971 --> 00:21:31.100\nYou're not gonna be asked on an exam,\nhow do I do this?\n\n384\n00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.804\nWhen do I do this?\n\n385\n00:21:31.804 --> 00:21:34.655\n&gt;&gt; But\njust understanding the concept, well,\n\n386\n00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:38.400\nconceptually here\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and if you're asked,\n\n387\n00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.710\nif your task on an exam question,\nwhat is the right aspiration and\n\n388\n00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:47.330\npick which vendor is promising a tool set,\nyou're gonna look at one that\n\n389\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.710\nhas the most, that perhaps the broadest\nintegration points, right?\n\n390\n00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:51.890\nAnd the least amount of risk.\n\n391\n00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.480\nEspecially when the work comes\nout academically speaking.\n\n392\n00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.150\nBut to design one of these\nis not in the remit.\n\n393\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.066\nAnd it's not a trivial matter either,\nit's not simple.\n\n394\n00:22:01.066 --> 00:22:05.284\nAnd again, how could I, to be a generic\nbest practice for any kind of\n\n395\n00:22:05.284 --> 00:22:10.551\norganization, when each organization\nwould attack this challenge differently?\n\n396\n00:22:10.551 --> 00:22:14.377\nI mean, I did a service catalog for\nan organization,\n\n397\n00:22:14.377 --> 00:22:19.400\nthey had 15 people that work on IT,\nthey have 28 servers, right?\n\n398\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:27.912\nAnd yet also work for an organization\nthat had 120 IT people and 3,000 servers.\n\n399\n00:22:27.912 --> 00:22:29.464\n&gt;&gt; So definitely not a one\nsize fits all [CROSSTALK].\n\n400\n00:22:29.464 --> 00:22:33.322\n&gt;&gt; It's not a one size fits all and\nI too as a best practice intended to\n\n401\n00:22:33.322 --> 00:22:37.130\nserve many different types of\norganisations of size and scope.\n\n402\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.160\nSo they're never gonna be so\nprescriptive to say, here, go do this.\n\n403\n00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.630\nKnock yourself out and\nwe'll ask you a test question later on.\n\n404\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:44.466\nNot gonna be part of the scope.\n\n405\n00:22:44.466 --> 00:22:45.917\nAlright.\n\n406\n00:22:48.852 --> 00:22:50.680\n&gt;&gt; Pipeline Management.\n\n407\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the one portion the portfolio.\n\n408\n00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:58.400\nRemember the pipeline is the portion\nthe portfolio that defines\n\n409\n00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.580\nwhat services you might want\nto consider offering, right?\n\n410\n00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.530\nIt doesn't mean it been approve yet.\n\n411\n00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:05.970\nIt's just thing around the consideration.\n\n412\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.295\nThey're under development\nas a business case.\n\n413\n00:23:09.295 --> 00:23:12.685\n&gt;&gt; Maybe like different iterations of\na prototype that I'm working on or\n\n414\n00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:13.445\nsomething like that?\n\n415\n00:23:13.445 --> 00:23:14.775\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?\n\n416\n00:23:16.245 --> 00:23:20.395\nIn terms of solutions, it also could be in\nterms of services such as a major change\n\n417\n00:23:20.395 --> 00:23:28.267\nlike if you want to move from\na Lotus Notes to Outlook and SharePoint.\n\n418\n00:23:28.267 --> 00:23:32.017\nThat's a significant\nparadigm shift in terms of,\n\n419\n00:23:32.017 --> 00:23:34.826\nit's not just your change in the message\nin service and collaboration service,\n\n420\n00:23:34.826 --> 00:23:38.310\nyou're changing vendors in a big way,\ndifferent changes here and there.\n\n421\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.220\nSome of it's kind of commoditized\non the email side, but\n\n422\n00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.540\nvery, very different on\nthe collaboration side.\n\n423\n00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.909\nSo how do you want to approach that?\n\n424\n00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:47.587\nThat might actually go through\nthe pipeline for consideration.\n\n425\n00:23:47.587 --> 00:23:48.119\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n426\n00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:50.819\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're modifying a service,\nbut it's such a major change,\n\n427\n00:23:50.819 --> 00:23:51.607\nyou won't take it.\n\n428\n00:23:51.607 --> 00:23:57.196\nI remember a pipeline discussion\nabout serving the public university\n\n429\n00:23:57.196 --> 00:24:02.499\nsystem in North Carolina,\nas they were considering how to improve\n\n430\n00:24:02.499 --> 00:24:08.658\ntheir email service that was homegrown\nsince the 80s to something newer and\n\n431\n00:24:08.658 --> 00:24:12.430\nbetter and\nthey end up going to Gmail, right?\n\n432\n00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.850\nUsing a Gmail solution for\nfaculty and staff.\n\n433\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.760\nBut that as a major consideration and\na major change.\n\n434\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.948\nSo major changes, it also go through\nthis pipeline consideration or\n\n435\n00:24:23.948 --> 00:24:26.230\nfor business cases, right?\n\n436\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.060\nAs we look at these different components\nand how they might link up with all\n\n437\n00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:34.100\nthe data sets, we'll necessarily get\ninvolved in some process discussions.\n\n438\n00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.560\nThat's gonna be good for\npicking up with our next episode for this.\n\n439\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.140\nSo see you soon on that regard.\n\n440\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry,\nthank you for joining us.\n\n441\n00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.750\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for joining us as well.\n\n442\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.950\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap it up for this particular show.\n\n443\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.028\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n444\n00:24:51.028 --> 00:24:51.864\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n445\n00:24:51.864 --> 00:24:54.942\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here

00:00:08.285\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:09.298\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:11.813\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\n\n6\n00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:16.750\ngentlemen to your ITIL Service Offerings\nand Agreements series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.150\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.460\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat service portfolio management.\n\n9\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.303\nThis is a part two.\n\n10\n00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:26.780\nAnd with us today back in studio\nwe have Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.140\nThank you for joining us today Terry.\n\n12\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.250\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.790\nYou recalled in our last episode that we\nwere talking about service portfolio.\n\n14\n00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.800\nThis is a part two of\nthat particular lesson.\n\n15\n00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.610\nAnd if you look at the slides here you'll\nsee that the portfolio was reminder is\n\n16\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.100\ncomposed of the service pipeline,\na service catalogue and retired services.\n\n17\n00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.060\nThis graphic also shows how the portfolio\nmight be linked to additional information\n\n18\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.660\nin the configuration management system,\nwhich we'll also discuss momentarily.\n\n19\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.520\nSo we're gonna take a look at each one of\nthese pieces of the portfolio in order.\n\n20\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.000\nFrom pipeline, to catalogue,\nand then to retired services.\n\n21\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000\nSo first of all, this pipeline.\n\n22\n00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.260\nIt does give you a sense of the overall\nhealth of the service provider.\n\n23\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.600\nIf the pipeline is active, and\nthere's lots of considerations for\n\n24\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.780\nnew services in that pipeline.\n\n25\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.150\nThen it does show a general\ngood health and that well,\n\n26\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.760\nyou got things to work on, right.\n\n27\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.470\nIf it's kinda stagnant, dusty,\nthere's cobweb all over it so\n\n28\n00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.520\nto speak, then it's kinda of\na stagnant service provider.\n\n29\n00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.370\nIt does not too many things in\nthe pipeline, nothing new coming.\n\n30\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.610\nSo it is a general representation of\nthe health of a service provider, right?\n\n31\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.490\nWhat it shows,\n\n32\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.200\nthe pipeline shows is those services\nthat are under consideration, right?\n\n33\n00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.850\nSo how are we gonna grow?\n\n34\n00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.240\nHow are going to better\nserve our customers?\n\n35\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.600\nIt's in that portion of the portfolio\nthat you make these discussions real and\n\n36\n00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.820\nthe pipeline is that set\nof data information.\n\n37\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.738\nThat let you have meaningful, well\ninformed discussions about new services.\n\n38\n00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:07.940\nSo how does a service get in the pipeline.\n\n39\n00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.040\nCherokee, you're offering\nthings now maybe-\n\n40\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know.\n\n41\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.230\nMaybe some kind of market research\nutilizing surveys and analytics.\n\n42\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.210\nMaybe hire a couple data scientist to help\nyou sort through all sorts of information\n\n43\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.730\nto help you determine what you need,\nand what direction to get for.\n\n44\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.980\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it could be market research\nin other words, you being pro active\n\n45\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.690\nas service provider trying to find out\nwhat does the market place need, right?\n\n46\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.300\nIt could be cost versus something\nif you want to show us that hey,\n\n47\n00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.610\ncould you do this?\n\n48\n00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.075\nOr maybe some things bubbled up through\nyour own internal organization, so\n\n49\n00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.330\nyour continue service and\nprove it initiatives, right?\n\n50\n00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.520\nYou just recognize that there's\nbusiness outcomes that aren't being\n\n51\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.020\nserved very well.\n\n52\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.690\nYou have a water cooler conversation\nwith someone in the business, and\n\n53\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.820\nthey say, what it would be\ngreat if IT could do this.\n\n54\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.200\nI said, that's a good idea.\n\n55\n00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.790\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy how some conversations just\nkind of happen at the most unusual times.\n\n56\n00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.081\nIf they can really be relevant.\n\n57\n00:02:59.081 --> 00:03:00.534\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nSo however formal or\n\n58\n00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:04.540\ninformal the discovery\nof opportunities are.\n\n59\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.830\nService portfolio management is going to\nformalize this discussion by putting such\n\n60\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.740\ngood opportunities or perhaps even bad\nopportunities into the pipeline, so\n\n61\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.230\nthat they can be fully embedded.\n\n62\n00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.660\nActually what the portfolio\nmanagement process is trying to do,\n\n63\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.330\nget them into the pipeline and\n\n64\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.170\nlet's fully bet these things to see if\nthey're worth the investment, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.870\nSo then moving on to the catalogue, right?\n\n66\n00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.350\nSo the pipeline those things\nunder considerations.\n\n67\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.850\nServices that might be brought to life.\n\n68\n00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.130\nIt will be approved.\n\n69\n00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.110\nThe catalogue on the other hand is a\ndatabase that has your active services or\n\n70\n00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.520\nthose services that have\nall ready been approved.\n\n71\n00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.570\nIn other words they've gone through\nthe pipeline consideration and says yep,\n\n72\n00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.910\nthey're gonna do this one.\n\n73\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.692\nSo it moves over to the catalogue.\n\n74\n00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:48.590\nRight, so\nnot only is it a list of services.\n\n75\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.160\nIt's certainly that, it shows what\nservices are currently being offered.\n\n76\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.700\nBut it also has a lot of detail,\nsuch as the who, what, when, where,\n\n77\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.350\nhow do you get this service?\n\n78\n00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.370\nWhat are the price points?\n\n79\n00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.160\nWho do we contact for this?\n\n80\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.990\nHow do we request that?\n\n81\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.400\nMaybe an IT service\nrequires special equipment.\n\n82\n00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.860\nHow do you order that equipment?\n\n83\n00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.300\nThose types of things.\n\n84\n00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.790\nWhat are the service hours?\n\n85\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.960\nMaybe it's not available after\nmidnight and those sorts of things.\n\n86\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.480\nSo some details about\nthese active services,\n\n87\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.600\nthe details about the active services are\nalso gonna be stored in this catalogue.\n\n88\n00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.839\nAnd because the catalogue could be\nexposed to different types of customers,\n\n89\n00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.758\nyou probably have to also manage\na different views of this data you don't\n\n90\n00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:36.840\nwanna say necessarily expose all services\nto all different costumers right?\n\n91\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.110\nAs a cable TV subscriber that doesn't used\n\n92\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.870\nperhaps a premium channel like HBO or\nShowtime or those types of services.\n\n93\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.390\nI don't need to see a listing of those\nofferings, so get that out of my way,\n\n94\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.350\nit's just noise, right,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n95\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.000\nSo the service catalogue is one part\ndetails, it's another part making sure\n\n96\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.820\nthe right details are available to the\nright audiences at the right time, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.150\nSo as a process,\n\n98\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.880\nservice portfolio managements gonna\nmake sure to get in to the catalog.\n\n99\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.240\nWe're gonna talk a little bit later about\nas very specific called service catalog\n\n100\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.490\nmanagement, right?\n\n101\n00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.980\nA process that's focus just on that\none piece of the portfolio, okay.\n\n102\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.550\nYou recall from yesterday that I was\n\n103\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.130\nencouraging you to think about\nthe processes, more so than the tool set?\n\n104\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.660\nAnd I want to remind you of that,\nis that the tool set is important.\n\n105\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.847\nYou're gonna have to get\nto that at some point.\n\n106\n00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:39.491\nBut as you approach this academically for\nthe exam that is and even as you approach\n\n107\n00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:45.360\nthis operationally back at the office,\nyou need to consider the process first.\n\n108\n00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.380\nAnd then the data model for\nhow to keep all this information straight\n\n109\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.630\nwill sort itself out based\non those processes, okay.\n\n110\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.070\nSo, here's a good example of what the\nprocess versus the tool might look like.\n\n111\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.170\nYou get the service portfolio management\nprocess identifying opportunities,\n\n112\n00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.890\ntrying to come up with\na value proposition.\n\n113\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.420\nWhat business outcome is served, right?\n\n114\n00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.420\nThat's in the darker shade here.\n\n115\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.030\nSo, the portfolio process is making sure\nthat you have a methodical way to assess\n\n116\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.830\nthe value,\nan ongoing offerings of a service.\n\n117\n00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and knowing that processes\nare really important because you can\n\n118\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.258\nutilize it, it's very flexible.\n\n119\n00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:29.140\nI mean, I've just been thinking about\npulling from different project management\n\n120\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.630\ntools and once you have an idea, kinda\nlike help where to start, where to began.\n\n121\n00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.120\nIt's just kind of plug and\nchug after that and\n\n122\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.090\nit gives you I guess a little bit of\nrelief, a little bit of guidance.\n\n123\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.940\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nit's repeatable, it's predictable.\n\n124\n00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.760\nThose are all very good points.\n\n125\n00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.380\nComing up with a methodical\nprocess is better that reinventing\n\n126\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.020\nthe wheel every time.\n\n127\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.824\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So I like the way you describe it.\n\n128\n00:06:50.824 --> 00:06:53.437\nIt's like turn the crank,\nyou don't have to reinvent it every time,\n\n129\n00:06:53.437 --> 00:06:55.830\njust come, okay, let's do this again.\n\n130\n00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.890\nSo, the portfolio management\nprocess trying to do\n\n131\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.820\nthis analysis of value\nproposition of the service.\n\n132\n00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.040\nAnd the catalogue is trying to make sure\nthat this information actually expose is\n\n133\n00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.300\nmeaningful way.\n\n134\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.610\nSo service catalogue management as\na process is trying to make sure\n\n135\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.520\nof the right views and\nusability of the information.\n\n136\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.720\nService portfolio is a process trying to\nmake sure that the services themselves\n\n137\n00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.200\nare viable providing value\nin a meaningful way, right.\n\n138\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.522\nSo there's a good compare and\ncontrast between the processes.\n\n139\n00:07:26.522 --> 00:07:30.770\nNow again they kinda come together\ndon't they at the data set.\n\n140\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.410\nThat's why I wanna try to encourage\nyou to mind the process more so\n\n141\n00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.710\nthan the data set or the data model.\n\n142\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.330\nThat will sort itself out.\n\n143\n00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.480\nAnd as you get to the academics of this,\n\n144\n00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.570\nagain on the tests, you're not gonna\nbe asked to design a service catalogue.\n\n145\n00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.510\nYou don't need to know\nwhat's in the catalogue.\n\n146\n00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.703\nYou'll need to know what kind\nof details are stored there, and\n\n147\n00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:54.509\nwhat the purpose of the process is and\npurpose of the service catalogue is.\n\n148\n00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:59.869\nBut design elements for\ndata modeling is not gonna be in scope.\n\n149\n00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:03.364\nAll right, so what about retired services?\n\n150\n00:08:03.364 --> 00:08:07.371\nI know myself there's been\ntimes when I've simply said,\n\n151\n00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:09.918\nI wanna find if anyone is using this.\n\n152\n00:08:09.918 --> 00:08:14.396\nWell, let's just turn it off and see if\nanyone really cares, if anyone screams.\n\n153\n00:08:14.396 --> 00:08:19.157\nOf course, that might be the only\nchoice in some cases, but\n\n154\n00:08:19.157 --> 00:08:23.072\nhopefully you are more aware of usage and\nvalue.\n\n155\n00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:27.079\nOf course, what fellow management is\ntrying to encourage you investigation\n\n156\n00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:28.690\nvalue as an ongoing activity.\n\n157\n00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.150\nAt some point as an ongoing activity,\n\n158\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.020\nyou may realize that services not\nreally serving much value anymore.\n\n159\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.220\nMaybe it has been replaced by two or\nthree other services,\n\n160\n00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.520\nor maybe the business is moved\non to do something else.\n\n161\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:50.040\nWhile service portfolio management is\na strategic process, it certainly is.\n\n162\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.388\nIt's in a stage called service strategy,\nthe early stage of a lifecycle on\n\n163\n00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:57.989\nthe service is arrived\nthroughout the other phases.\n\n164\n00:08:57.989 --> 00:09:01.167\nOther stages,\ncertainly service portfolio management,\n\n165\n00:09:01.167 --> 00:09:04.607\nneeds to be evaluating services\nthat are already operational.\n\n166\n00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:07.166\nIf they have been determined\nthat they no longer require or\n\n167\n00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:10.820\nthey're no longer required,\nthen it's probably time to retire them.\n\n168\n00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.830\nSo come with a methodical way to\nhandle that by passing it over to\n\n169\n00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:20.130\nthe service transition folks To take\nthese servers down, reuse the capacity,\n\n170\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.680\nreuse or perhaps take care of the data and\narchiving and\n\n171\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.040\nthose sort of things,\ndo it in a methodical way.\n\n172\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.290\nDon't just turn it off and\nsee if anyone screams.\n\n173\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Good advice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.920\nI mean, I've been there, I've done that so\nthat's kind of smile about it.\n\n175\n00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.360\nBecause we're not really sure okay, let's\njust see Yeah, they kind of have a joke\n\n176\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.830\nin IT, when things are going great,\nyou really don't hear about it,\n\n177\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.370\nbut as soon as something is wrong,\nthat's when you're gonna hear about it.\n\n178\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, that's for sure,\nand unfortunately, it's not a joke,\n\n179\n00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.485\nthat's reality.\n\n180\n00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:49.994\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n181\n00:09:49.994 --> 00:09:52.520\n&gt;&gt; It really is life in IT, that's right.\n\n182\n00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.460\nSo good, and now we're gonna\nlook at how this portfolio,\n\n183\n00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.850\nwhich has its own three parts, right,\n\n184\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.470\nit's got the pipeline, it's got\nthe catalog And has got retired services.\n\n185\n00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.770\nHow does portfolio interfaces\nwith other data sources?\n\n186\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.240\nAnd again you're not gonna be\nasked to do this academically, but\n\n187\n00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.950\nthere's much value if\nyou could pull this off.\n\n188\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.180\nIf you can link your underline- CMS data.\n\n189\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.210\nConfiguration Management data up\nthrough the portfolio or vice versa.\n\n190\n00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.610\nIf you can link the portfolio\nto the underline data\n\n191\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.730\nin your configuration management\nit could be very very variable.\n\n192\n00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.420\nSo remember that a configuration\nmanagement system consists of one or\n\n193\n00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.850\nmore configuration management databases.\n\n194\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.490\nThat's where the details\nOf the services and\n\n195\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.420\nthat is a very minuet level,\nthe component level are stored.\n\n196\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.740\nSo if a service has five\nservers underneath it and\n\n197\n00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.530\nfour databases and six applications.\n\n198\n00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.060\nRight.\n\n199\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.830\nA service could be, though,\nthat's bit more complex and\n\n200\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.570\nperhaps a One server, one application\nservice, so even that high-level view\n\n201\n00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.440\nof the complexity of the service\ncould be valuable to you, right?\n\n202\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.890\nBut you can get even more details\nout of your CMDBs and out of CMS.\n\n203\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:12.730\nHow many incidents did this service have\nthis past quarter or this past month?\n\n204\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.990\nHow many problems did it have?\n\n205\n00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.680\nHow many changes were necessary?\n\n206\n00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.240\nHow many emergency changes were necessary?\n\n207\n00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.570\nWhat was the down time for this thing?\n\n208\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.710\nSo you can get lots of data underneath\nthe service, underneath the surface.\n\n209\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.460\nSo while the portfolio is very high level,\n\n210\n00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.540\ndown in the in the CMDBs could be very\npotentially, valuable information.\n\n211\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.700\nLinking these two together\n\n212\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.490\ncould help you a lot in management\nof your IT services, right?\n\n213\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.590\nAnd then there is other repositories.\n\n214\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.060\nWe had a brief look at this on a single\npage earlier, application portfolio\n\n215\n00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.960\nas the name suggests is a portfolio\nof all your applications Right.\n\n216\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.550\nMaintained by other people than\nthe service portfolio management folks,\n\n217\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.740\nI mean this is not the responsibility\nof service portfolio management.\n\n218\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.560\nBut, again a good link up,\n\n219\n00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.770\nif you can link your services to\nunderlying applications through the CMS,\n\n220\n00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.450\nyou gonna find a more holistic view\nof how services are constructed.\n\n221\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.600\nOkay.\n\n222\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.570\nThe application development project\n\n223\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.170\nportfolio is also that can be\nput in there as well, right?\n\n224\n00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.970\nSo understanding what services\nare in the pipeline and\n\n225\n00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.950\nwhat applications are currently under\ndevelop and connecting the dots between\n\n226\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:28.820\nthem could be again a source of variable\ninformation as you consider your portfolio\n\n227\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.560\nOkay, a customer portfolio,\na list of all your customers.\n\n228\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.470\nAgain knowing what services\nyou have is one thing,\n\n229\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.260\nknowing what customs you have is another,\nright?\n\n230\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.910\nTrying to put those two together through\nsome sort of data model also can be\n\n231\n00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.740\nvery valuable, right.\n\n232\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.410\nSo it's business relationship management\nresponsibility to take care of\n\n233\n00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.520\nThis customer portfolio.\n\n234\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.030\nThe customer agreement portfolio is\nunder the agreement of a process called\n\n235\n00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.840\nservice level management.\n\n236\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.740\nWe'll talk about both of those\nprocesses in this course.\n\n237\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.570\nSOA, service offerings and agreements\nincludes relationships with the business.\n\n238\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.790\nIt also includes the agreements that\nare brokered by service level management\n\n239\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.980\nManagement, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.110\nA missing project portfolio is\nrelated to application development.\n\n241\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.970\nProjects can also be non-technical,\n\n242\n00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:23.595\nyou can have a project to adopt ITIL\nRight, that could be all process driven.\n\n243\n00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:26.505\nNot actually introducing new\ntechnology to your customers.\n\n244\n00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:29.205\nBut you're introducing new\ninterfaces with your customers.\n\n245\n00:13:29.205 --> 00:13:33.765\nMaybe they're going to be participants in\nyour change management process in a formal\n\n246\n00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:34.555\nway, instead of informal.\n\n247\n00:13:34.555 --> 00:13:37.285\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps we need to schedule\nsome kind of training method.\n\n248\n00:13:37.285 --> 00:13:38.365\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, good point.\n\n249\n00:13:38.365 --> 00:13:39.535\nThere's going to be training.\n\n250\n00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:42.345\nThere's going to be knowledge\ntransfer of all types.\n\n251\n00:13:42.345 --> 00:13:47.180\nProcess, technology Procedural things,\nright.\n\n252\n00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.155\nSo, project portfolio,\nwell it could be a technical project,\n\n253\n00:13:51.155 --> 00:13:52.920\n[INAUDIBLE] it had to\nbe a technical project.\n\n254\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:58.230\nBut understanding that the portfolio,\nthe pipeline, moving to the catalogue,\n\n255\n00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.090\nmoving to retired service could\ndefinitely be driven through a project.\n\n256\n00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.350\nSo, connecting the dots\nbetween your project work and\n\n257\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:09.600\nyour portfolio work would be\na nice trick to pull off.\n\n258\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.820\nAgain, focus on the processes and\nwhat the processes do.\n\n259\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.550\nYou're not gonna be asked to create this\n\n260\n00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.370\nwonderful data model that links\nall this information together.\n\n261\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.360\nBut looking for integration, and looking\nfor the opportunities to integrate,\n\n262\n00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.950\nis gonna serve you on the exam,\nas well as serve you in operational.\n\n263\n00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.750\nLook for those opportunities and\nexploit them as deeply as possible.\n\n264\n00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:34.270\nAll right, this idea of a service model.\n\n265\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.560\nA service model is to\nunderstand Your big picture,\n\n266\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.490\nyour listed picture of what\nservices are doing, right?\n\n267\n00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:48.760\nSo, again imagine that\nbudge in pre-amazon.com.\n\n268\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.660\nThe model of their services before\namazon.com were very limited.\n\n269\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.230\nThey have that they store,\nyou could order a book and\n\n270\n00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.660\ngo pick it up at the breaking\nmodel store type a thing.\n\n271\n00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.970\nOf course that service\nmodel change quite a bit.\n\n272\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.250\nWith the advent of Amazon and\nthat competitive analysis.\n\n273\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.200\nThey still want to break in motor stores.\n\n274\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.320\nThey still want those KFs, right.\n\n275\n00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.290\nBut now they needed to have a way to more\n\n276\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.580\nfully fulfill the customer's needs for\nservice providing.\n\n277\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.660\n&gt;&gt; Sure, they have to expand in that\ninfrastructure there on their web\n\n278\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.320\nserver back end and\njust think about that high availability.\n\n279\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.640\nWith the influx of all that traffic.\n\n280\n00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI wondered just what it look like.\n\n281\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.460\nI'm speaking, I really don't\nknow just using this example but\n\n282\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.720\nwhat was their foot traffic?\n\n283\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; To the the stores versus foot traffic,\n\n284\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.250\nfinger traffic if you will to the website.\n\n285\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.680\nAnd the how are they changing that?\n\n286\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.400\nHow are they measuring that?\n\n287\n00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:39.980\nMap.\n\n288\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.180\nSo all of this things we talked\nabout in services are hiding about\n\n289\n00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:48.070\nhow you measure success look\nlike how list the process is.\n\n290\n00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.625\nThere's a lot big into service models.\n\n291\n00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:53.362\n&gt;&gt; Well just to show how\nimportant like matrix and\n\n292\n00:15:53.362 --> 00:15:56.873\nmodeling really is because\nwithout that With those tools,\n\n293\n00:15:56.873 --> 00:16:01.820\nlike a network monitoring utility,\nI'm sure they were able to see the trend.\n\n294\n00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.814\nSo it wasn't-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n295\n00:16:02.814 --> 00:16:04.383\n&gt;&gt; Just like, surprise.\n\n296\n00:16:04.383 --> 00:16:07.297\nIt just does show how important\nthose tools really can be.\n\n297\n00:16:07.297 --> 00:16:10.750\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm sure there\nwas probably a pause there.\n\n298\n00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.000\nWhat is this Amazon phenomenon, early on?\n\n299\n00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.040\nDo we have to respond to it, right?\n\n300\n00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.660\nAnd then how do you get the metrics to\nknow when it's time to respond, right?\n\n301\n00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.370\nSo they're doing market research and\nvarious things like that.\n\n302\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.050\nClearly, the model of servicing, or\n\n303\n00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:28.170\nthe way they modeled their services\nbefore www.Amazon.com, Barnes and\n\n304\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.120\nNoble had to come up with different\nways of modeling their services.\n\n305\n00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.790\nHow are we going to make sure that we are\nthe book seller that people wanna come to?\n\n306\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.250\nRight, we can't just be brick and\nmortar with occasional IT interface,\n\n307\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.515\nwe need to reorganise the way\nwe're approaching this, right?\n\n308\n00:16:42.515 --> 00:16:43.570\nThat's what service modelling is.\n\n309\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.600\nLet's take another example of\nservice modelling, if you consider\n\n310\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:55.490\nthe service model of email or messaging,\nmust it be integrated with your calendar?\n\n311\n00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.930\nMost customers would say yeah that's\npretty much a non starter now.\n\n312\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.530\nThat's what we expect.\n\n313\n00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:07.020\nYahoo does it, Gmail does it, I've been\ndoing it on these other platforms forever.\n\n314\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.338\nThe reason I mentioned that one is cuz the\npublic university in North Carolina was\n\n315\n00:17:11.338 --> 00:17:14.480\nfacing this very question not so\nlong ago actually.\n\n316\n00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.210\nThey had a home grown email\nsystem that worked fairly well.\n\n317\n00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:22.490\nIt had been homegrown, it's maintained\nby their homegrown staff, and it works.\n\n318\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.160\nBut it wasn't keeping up with the utility,\n\n319\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.410\nthe functionality that was expected\nof most email users, right?\n\n320\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.220\nWhat about linking up\nwith instant messaging or\n\n321\n00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.620\nbeing able to have a collaborate\nteam meet together somewhere?\n\n322\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.090\nRight, such as Google circles and\nthose types of things.\n\n323\n00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:43.200\nAgain the functionality train\nhad left the station and\n\n324\n00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.670\nthe university system had missed it,\nright?\n\n325\n00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.750\nSo they needed to catch up.\n\n326\n00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:52.438\nWhat service models did they need to\nremould for this service called email?\n\n327\n00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:55.275\nThey remodeled lots of things\nto integrate with calendar,\n\n328\n00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:59.248\nto integrate with instant messaging,\nto integrate with collaborative groups and\n\n329\n00:17:59.248 --> 00:18:00.855\nteams and those sorts of things.\n\n330\n00:18:00.855 --> 00:18:04.590\n&gt;&gt; And our service model should also\nprobably stick with the trend with that\n\n331\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.160\nrevolving or I guess just that\nrotating door kind of concept.\n\n332\n00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.578\nBecause even with your example\nwith the www.Amazon.com,\n\n333\n00:18:12.578 --> 00:18:16.269\nlooking at the use of their drones for\ndelivery options, right?\n\n334\n00:18:16.269 --> 00:18:17.238\nIt's continuing.\n\n335\n00:18:17.238 --> 00:18:18.292\n&gt;&gt; It never-\n&gt;&gt; To evolve.\n\n336\n00:18:18.292 --> 00:18:19.268\n&gt;&gt; Stops, exactly right.\n\n337\n00:18:19.268 --> 00:18:20.042\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n338\n00:18:20.042 --> 00:18:23.970\nthat's a great segue to this\noverall theme of service portfolio.\n\n339\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.160\nIt's alive, it's a live thing,\nit's not a static thing.\n\n340\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.600\nIt's not just turn the crank.\n\n341\n00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.590\nIt needs to be open for\nbusiness all the time.\n\n342\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.160\nThis idea of modeling your services\nappropriately is what service portfolio\n\n343\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.390\nmanagement, as a process, is about,\nare we offering the right mix of services?\n\n344\n00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.046\nNot one at a time but we have the right\nmix to make sure we're doing that.\n\n345\n00:18:42.046 --> 00:18:46.390\nAnd as Cherokee just said,\neven if the business doesn't move,\n\n346\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:50.340\neven if you're fairly safe with your\nrelationship with your customers.\n\n347\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.050\nTechnology changes all the time and\n\n348\n00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.370\nopportunities are introduced by\nthose technological changes.\n\n349\n00:18:55.370 --> 00:19:02.400\nOkay, so\nmaking sure that what you're working on\n\n350\n00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.170\nis what the business needs, is really what\nservice portfolio management is about,\n\n351\n00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.760\nare you working on the right services,\ndelivering the right services?\n\n352\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.735\nTo satisfy the appropriate outcomes?\n\n353\n00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:16.688\nI've often mentioned the example of\nthe oil company there's three things they\n\n354\n00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:20.360\nwanna do they wanna find it,\nextract it, and distribute it.\n\n355\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.710\nRight.\nIt is a big picture that's what it is.\n\n356\n00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.910\nAnd just under that big picture\nthere's they wanna do it safely.\n\n357\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.610\nAnd just under that they wanna\ndo it within regulatory limits.\n\n358\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.400\nRegulatory constraints.\n\n359\n00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.110\nRight?\n\n360\n00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.130\nAnd they wanna do it fast.\n\n361\n00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.133\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Cost effective?\n\n362\n00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.774\n&gt;&gt; Cost, risk and speed basically-\n&gt;&gt; There we go\n\n363\n00:19:37.774 --> 00:19:39.985\n&gt;&gt; Right, so three big things, find it,\n\n364\n00:19:39.985 --> 00:19:43.268\nextract it, distribute it,\nand they wanna do it safely,\n\n365\n00:19:43.268 --> 00:19:46.830\nwith regulatory compliance they\nwanna do it quickly, right?\n\n366\n00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.370\nSo among those things,\nthat's what they're trying to get done.\n\n367\n00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.670\nAre our services aligned\nto those business goals.\n\n368\n00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.140\nIs what Service Portfolio Management\nis about, right?\n\n369\n00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.816\nSometimes that's real easy,\nsometimes that's not so easy to make\n\n370\n00:20:01.816 --> 00:20:07.150\nthe direct connection between what this\nservice does and the business outcome.\n\n371\n00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.890\nGetting those connections well\nunderstood is an important\n\n372\n00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.250\naspect of Service Portfolio Management.\n\n373\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:13.550\nOkay?\n\n374\n00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.360\n&gt;&gt; Now, how does portfolio management\ninteract with these other stages?\n\n375\n00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.940\nService design, transition,\noperations and CSI.\n\n376\n00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.870\nI'll start at the bottom here first,\nit could be that CSI,\n\n377\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.790\nContinuous Service Improvement,\nhas developed the opportunity.\n\n378\n00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.391\nThey've been, they've seen that\na particular service is failing\n\n379\n00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:37.791\nbecause it's missing some components,\nright?\n\n380\n00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:40.507\nPeople are-\n&gt;&gt; Then tasked with kind of revamping, or\n\n381\n00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:42.208\nmodifying, that service?\n\n382\n00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:44.989\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nCSI could bubble up the idea that hey,\n\n383\n00:20:44.989 --> 00:20:47.500\nthis service is under performing.\n\n384\n00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.950\nHere's how it could better\nperform to satisfy business.\n\n385\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.386\nSo CSI bubbles up the idea,\n\n386\n00:20:51.386 --> 00:20:55.450\na course can send that idea to\nthe service portfolio management folks.\n\n387\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.832\nIt enters the pipeline,\nthey start doing a business case and\n\n388\n00:20:58.832 --> 00:21:00.830\nworking those things out, right?\n\n389\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.062\nA course service operations\ncannot only feed CSI but\n\n390\n00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:08.768\nservice operations is where service\nvalue is actually generated, right?\n\n391\n00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:12.640\nIt's not until you operate the service\nthat the customers get the value from\n\n392\n00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.374\nthe service.\n\n393\n00:21:13.374 --> 00:21:17.506\nSo if that value is missing or\nif that value is short changing,\n\n394\n00:21:17.506 --> 00:21:21.477\nit's not quite the full value,\nor it's too expensive, or\n\n395\n00:21:21.477 --> 00:21:25.926\ntoo time consuming, or\na little bit of both or counter intuitive,\n\n396\n00:21:25.926 --> 00:21:30.455\ndissatisfied customers,\nservice operations are gonna be here and\n\n397\n00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:35.565\nthat's where the squeaky wheels will\nbe heard, is in service operations.\n\n398\n00:21:35.565 --> 00:21:38.902\nAgain, Service Transition and\nService Design,\n\n399\n00:21:38.902 --> 00:21:42.717\nthey're kind of downstream\nfrom Service Strategy, but\n\n400\n00:21:42.717 --> 00:21:47.643\nit would be really silly for Service\nPortfolio folks to decide to fund a new\n\n401\n00:21:47.643 --> 00:21:53.640\nservice without understanding the cost and\nrisks of design and transition.\n\n402\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.060\nImagine a car company in the mid 80s\n\n403\n00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.020\ndeciding that we should probably have\nsomething, we'll call it a SUV, right?\n\n404\n00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.430\nLet's just go build an SUV and\nsee if it works, right?\n\n405\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.190\nOne company probably did that.\n\n406\n00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.840\nI think American Motors did it with\na Jeep, right, the Jeep Cherokee.\n\n407\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.270\nSo they got a brand-new vehicle, the SUV.\n\n408\n00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.720\nSales went up.\n\n409\n00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.610\nSo that was American Motors,\nChrysler looked at that and\n\n410\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.670\nsaid maybe we should buy them.\n\n411\n00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.450\nSo that's what they did.\n\n412\n00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.766\nThey bought American Motors.\n\n413\n00:22:19.766 --> 00:22:22.856\nGeneral motors said what are we\ngonna do about this SUV phenomenon?\n\n414\n00:22:22.856 --> 00:22:24.200\nWe need an SUV.\n\n415\n00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.540\nRight so that's a new service.\n\n416\n00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.585\nSo to speak, a new offering, or\nat least it's analogy to a new service.\n\n417\n00:22:30.585 --> 00:22:32.517\nWe need to bring a new thing to market.\n\n418\n00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:35.095\nWell it'd be silly for\nthem to say, well let's just do it\n\n419\n00:22:35.095 --> 00:22:38.053\nwithout understanding what's it\ngonna cost to get it designed,\n\n420\n00:22:38.053 --> 00:22:40.602\nwhat's it gonna cost to get\nit built in manufacturing.\n\n421\n00:22:40.602 --> 00:22:42.435\n&gt;&gt; So we use our current\nmanufacturing facilities-\n\n422\n00:22:42.435 --> 00:22:43.123\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n423\n00:22:43.123 --> 00:22:43.803\n&gt;&gt; Do we need new products?\n\n424\n00:22:43.803 --> 00:22:46.157\n&gt;&gt; Yeah do we have to retool, right?\n\n425\n00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:49.242\nAll that sort a thing, so\nwithout getting the experts in design and\n\n426\n00:22:49.242 --> 00:22:53.044\ntransition involved in your portfolio\ndecisions, you could obviously make some\n\n427\n00:22:53.044 --> 00:22:55.543\npretty wrong headed decisions\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n428\n00:22:55.543 --> 00:22:58.670\n&gt;&gt; So, there's gonna definitely gonna\nbe interaction between these two.\n\n429\n00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.340\nNow as it flows downstream, right?\n\n430\n00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.863\nSo that's getting\ninformation from design and\n\n431\n00:23:03.863 --> 00:23:06.827\ntransition to make a wise\ndecision at portfolio level,\n\n432\n00:23:06.827 --> 00:23:10.865\nas it flows downstream obviously\na service portfolio management Is telling\n\n433\n00:23:10.865 --> 00:23:15.299\ndesign we've agreed this is what we're\ngonna be doing now go design this service.\n\n434\n00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:18.653\nDesign in turn passes it\ndownstream to transition and\n\n435\n00:23:18.653 --> 00:23:20.898\noperations of course operates it.\n\n436\n00:23:20.898 --> 00:23:25.220\nGoing back to the touch point though,\nwhy are we even doing this,\n\n437\n00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.615\nis the remit of service portfolio.\n\n438\n00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:31.510\nThey're telling us what business\noutcome should be achieved.\n\n439\n00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.930\nBy this service.\n\n440\n00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.200\nSo service operation has\ntheir eye on that ball.\n\n441\n00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.530\nService transition has\ntheir eye on that ball.\n\n442\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.147\nService design has its eye on that ball.\n\n443\n00:23:40.147 --> 00:23:41.866\nService portfolio management\nis defining the ball.\n\n444\n00:23:41.866 --> 00:23:43.469\nOkay.\n\n445\n00:23:43.469 --> 00:23:46.323\nAlright.\n\n446\n00:23:46.323 --> 00:23:50.950\nSo what we're gonna get to next is this\nworkflow through the service portfolio\n\n447\n00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.802\nmanagement.\n\n448\n00:23:51.802 --> 00:23:56.599\nYou'll see that there's these\nfour activities here, Define,\n\n449\n00:23:56.599 --> 00:23:59.050\nAnalyze, Approve and Charter.\n\n450\n00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.730\nWorth memorizing.\n\n451\n00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.970\nWhile the test is not rote memorization,\n\n452\n00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:10.570\nyou could be successful on exam question\njust by knowing the right order here.\n\n453\n00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:11.920\nSo give this some good thought.\n\n454\n00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.970\nPortfolio management is defining what\nservices should be offered potentially,\n\n455\n00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.000\nanalyzing whether that\nservice will be offered.\n\n456\n00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.940\nAnd if so, approving it.\n\n457\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.390\nThere's a difference between approval and\nchartering,\n\n458\n00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:33.330\nis the approval is the official stamp\nof saying yes, we're going to fund it.\n\n459\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:36.380\nThe chartering is\nthe communication of that approval.\n\n460\n00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.670\nIt's letting everyone know and\nputting a stake in the ground.\n\n461\n00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:44.050\nSo you got the treaty in the background\nsaying yes we're gonna do this, and\n\n462\n00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.330\nnow the charter is,\nwell here's how we're gonna do it.\n\n463\n00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:50.580\nWe've named a project manager,\nhere's the project timeline, etc.\n\n464\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.730\nSo define, analyze, approve, and\ncharter are these four big steps,\n\n465\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:59.780\nand we'll pick these up in a part 3\nrelated to service portfolio management\n\n466\n00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.890\ncoming up soon and\nlook at each one of these steps in detail.\n\n467\n00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry.\nSounds like a plan.\n\n468\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.930\nThank you so much for joining us, and\nthank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n469\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.510\nbeing with us today as well.\n\n470\n00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.400\nBut like you said,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n471\n00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.715\nSo stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n472\n00:25:15.715 --> 00:25:17.160\nWe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n473\n00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.960\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n474\n00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.597\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n475\n00:25:19.597 --> 00:25:22.768\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

and\n\n6\n00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:16.060\nAgreements series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.030\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.930\nWe've actually made it to a part three\nwhere we're gonna continue to look at\n\n9\n00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.510\nservice management with our portfolios.\n\n10\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.170\nWith us back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.650\nThank you for joining us Terry.\n\n12\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.610\n&gt;&gt; As always, happy to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.890\nService portfolio management\nat this point in our\n\n14\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.790\nlearning is gonna be having a good look\nat the details underneath the hood.\n\n15\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.670\nWhat is the process actually going\nthrough in a step by step process.\n\n16\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.840\nSo if you look here at the PowerPoint,\nyou'll see that something gets it started.\n\n17\n00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.250\nWe talked about how\nwould something even be\n\n18\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.080\noffered to service portfolio management.\n\n19\n00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.160\nWe talked about a water\ncooler conversation, perhaps.\n\n20\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.500\nMaybe a formal request procedure for\nnew services.\n\n21\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.810\nYou've done some market research,\nmaybe an operation you've\n\n22\n00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.690\nchurned up some pain and understand that\nthe customers could be better served, so\n\n23\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.880\nyou create a continuous service\nimprovement opportunity, right?\n\n24\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.610\nSo, how it get started\ncould be in many ways.\n\n25\n00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.890\nBut it does get started.\n\n26\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.700\nAnd then once it gets started, the service\nportfolio management process is gonna be\n\n27\n00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.300\nbroken down into these four\nbig picture ideas here.\n\n28\n00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.580\nDefining, analyzing,\napproving, and chartering.\n\n29\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.770\nAnd, as I mentioned earlier, kind of worth\nmemorizing this very distinct order.\n\n30\n00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.130\nAnd notice it's cyclical, right.\n\n31\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.450\nIt comes back to defining.\n\n32\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.690\nAre we doing it right?\n\n33\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.600\nDid we get what we're supposed to\nget out of this value wise, etc.?\n\n34\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.550\nRight?\n\n35\n00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.310\nSo as we look at these in term,\nwe'll look at what the definition stage or\n\n36\n00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.570\nphase of this process is doing,\nwhat the analysis phase is doing,\n\n37\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.900\nwhat the approval stage and\nchartering phases are doing.\n\n38\n00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.620\nSo we're gonna look at these\nindividually as we go through here.\n\n39\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.483\nOkay, first of all,\nthe process initiation,\n\n40\n00:01:53.483 --> 00:01:56.713\nwe talked about strategy management,\nBRM, right?\n\n41\n00:01:56.713 --> 00:02:00.420\nBusiness Relationship Management could be\nthe process that gets it cranking out.\n\n42\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.330\nCSI could be doing it.\n\n43\n00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.770\nOther service management processes\nsuch as change management.\n\n44\n00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.500\nAny of these could get it started, right?\n\n45\n00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.570\nIt could be something big, right,\n\n46\n00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.130\nwhere you've discovered this at a steering\ngroup, at a high strategic level.\n\n47\n00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.880\nAgain, imagine that bonds\na noble IT department and\n\n48\n00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.560\nthe business back in the day\nwhen they we're saying,\n\n49\n00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.080\nwhat are we gonna do about\nthis Amazon.com phenomenon?\n\n50\n00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.512\nThat was a big decision,\nhow are we going to compete here, right?\n\n51\n00:02:28.512 --> 00:02:29.810\nWhat are we gonna invest?\n\n52\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.640\nHow are we gonna invest?\n\n53\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.440\nWhat's our priorities for investment?\n\n54\n00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.390\nRight, are we gonna maintain our brick and\nmortar?\n\n55\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.950\nAre we gonna distinguish\nourselves that way?\n\n56\n00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.590\nAre we gonna sell things besides music and\nbooks?\n\n57\n00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.249\nWhat are we gonna do, right.\n\n58\n00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.682\nSo, they had lots of things to\nconsider business-wise, and\n\n59\n00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:49.237\nIT necessarily had to be at that table,\nbecause IT services will gonna help Barnes\n\n60\n00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:52.840\n&amp; Noble stay viable in that market place,\nright?\n\n61\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.060\nSo again, it could be big picture things,\nbig, big investments.\n\n62\n00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.500\nIt also could be a lot smaller investments\nas you consider the portfolio management\n\n63\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.500\npiece, okay.\n\n64\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.136\nSo again, anything can get these started.\n\n65\n00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:13.470\nStrategic management business relationship\nCSI, or other management processes, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.307\nNow, if we look at,\nThe definition piece, activities,\n\n67\n00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:21.713\nmethods, and techniques as we get down,\nonce you get these inputs,\n\n68\n00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:24.670\nyou're gonna start coming\ninto the define stage, right?\n\n69\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.340\nSo here it is, process initiation and\n\n70\n00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.600\nthen moving into the definition\nphase of the process.\n\n71\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.480\nAnd looking at the details here what\nyou're doing at the definition stage,\n\n72\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.850\nare we actually meeting a strategy?\n\n73\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.940\nWhat are we trying to accomplish here?\n\n74\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.330\nAgain, imagine the Barnes and\nNoble's scenario.\n\n75\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.060\nWe're trying to stay viable, we are brick\nand mortar, cellar of books and\n\n76\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.440\nmusic, right?\n\n77\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.950\nWe have plush chairs,\nbeautiful wooden cabinets.\n\n78\n00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.360\nWe got a coffee shop in the corner, right?\n\n79\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.450\nThat's our current business model.\n\n80\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.530\nAre we gonna maintain that?\n\n81\n00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.960\nWhat is our strategy, right?\n\n82\n00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.580\nOr again, does it come from business,\netc., right?\n\n83\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.940\nSo, the definition is really trying\nto describe and answer the question,\n\n84\n00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.450\nwhat strategy would be served\nby our service offerings?\n\n85\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.830\nWhat strategies will be served, what\nbusiness strategies will be served, right?\n\n86\n00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.660\nSo you're defining what IT should be\nworking on, to satisfy business needs.\n\n87\n00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.300\nBack to the old company.\n\n88\n00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.870\nHow are our services\nhelping this business,\n\n89\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.900\nfind it, extract it, and distribute it?\n\n90\n00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.210\nWhat are we doing to make that happen,\nokay?\n\n91\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.710\nKeeping it based on those business\noutcomes is what it's really about, right?\n\n92\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.750\nSo, as you're trying to define these,\n\n93\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.970\nyou're gonna define them in terms\nof business outputs, right?\n\n94\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.150\nBusiness outcomes.\n\n95\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.010\nWe're going to find oil faster.\n\n96\n00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.680\nWe're going to find it more safely.\n\n97\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.670\nWe're going to find it in compliance.\n\n98\n00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.330\nBetter compliance with federal\nregulations, etc., right?\n\n99\n00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.240\nWe're gonna find it in ways that\nmake it more cost-effective,\n\n100\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.190\nwhatever it might be, right.\n\n101\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.620\nSo, the definition of these is going\nto come from various locations.\n\n102\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.950\nAnd as these triggers define your\nstrategy, where you're gonna move.\n\n103\n00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.934\nAgain, what was the trigger for Barnes and\nNoble to reinvent themselves competitive,\n\n104\n00:05:19.934 --> 00:05:22.610\ncompetition pressures, right?\n\n105\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.280\nWhat makes oil companies wanna find it\nfaster, competitive pressures, right?\n\n106\n00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.640\nCost pressure, etc, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.800\nSo again, the definition of this things\ncan come from lots of different places.\n\n108\n00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.700\nDo we have an existing service that\nneeds to be change considerably?\n\n109\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.090\nSuch as the public university\nsystem I referred to earlier.\n\n110\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.485\nWe have email, what's wrong with it now?\n\n111\n00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:47.120\nIt's just fine, why do we need to change?\n\n112\n00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.590\nWell, it doesn't integrate with calendar,\nit doesn't interface\n\n113\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.480\nwith our collaborative teams,\nit doesn't work with instant messaging.\n\n114\n00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.315\nWe can do better than this, right.\n\n115\n00:05:56.315 --> 00:05:58.910\nIt's costing us a lot,\nwhat about our existing services?\n\n116\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.550\nIs there a cheaper way to do it?\n\n117\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.080\nRight.\n\n118\n00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.214\nConsider Cloud computing versus\ninternally hosted computing,\n\n119\n00:06:06.214 --> 00:06:08.741\nright, those sorts of things.\n\n120\n00:06:08.741 --> 00:06:11.984\nSo portfolio management is\nnot necessarily involved\n\n121\n00:06:11.984 --> 00:06:14.450\nin the definition of new services.\n\n122\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.210\nIt could be involved in\nthe redefinition of existing services,\n\n123\n00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.079\nto make sure you're satisfying\nthe overall needs of the business.\n\n124\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.740\nWe talked about service models before so\n\n125\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.660\nwe certainly gonna bring those\nback in to the definition piece.\n\n126\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.553\nWhat model,\n\n127\n00:06:29.553 --> 00:06:35.329\nwhat collection of services do we have to\nsatisfy these business outcomes, right.\n\n128\n00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:38.849\nThe service model is your collection\nof services and how they work,\n\n129\n00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.310\nputting these services together in\nways that create those outcomes.\n\n130\n00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.120\nRight.\n\n131\n00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.790\nAnd then, of course, you're also defining,\nis this a new service?\n\n132\n00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.990\nHow's it gonna affect\nthe portfolio at large?\n\n133\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.090\nDo we need to retire other services\nto make this one viable, right?\n\n134\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.250\nAre we combining several different\nthings to make it viable, right?\n\n135\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.770\nSo understanding at\nthe definition level how\n\n136\n00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.070\nthis service might impact your portfolio\nat large, and your service model at large,\n\n137\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.570\nis a big part of the definitions name too,\nokay.\n\n138\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.290\nOkay, so now what about analysis?\n\n139\n00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.950\nHere it is in the context\nof the work flow down.\n\n140\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.220\nThe definition, the big picture of\nthis is a viable consideration,\n\n141\n00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.050\nwe need to make sure we now\nlook at it more deeply.\n\n142\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:32.080\nWe want to become a web store, we want to\nhave a web presence and an eBook reader.\n\n143\n00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.050\nAnd we wanna to do that by the end\nof next year that sort of thing.\n\n144\n00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.170\nSo, you're putting stakes in the sand.\n\n145\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.280\nOkay, how are we gonna get there?\n\n146\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.650\nWhat are we gonna invest in first,\netc., so then you're doing an analysis.\n\n147\n00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.260\nAnd as the name suggests,\nyou're analyzing your strategy.\n\n148\n00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.017\nIs this going to be a viable strategy?\n\n149\n00:07:53.017 --> 00:07:56.937\nIf we introduce this, we should be\nable to maintain market share or\n\n150\n00:07:56.937 --> 00:07:59.255\nwe should be able to grow market share.\n\n151\n00:07:59.255 --> 00:07:59.907\nRight?\n\n152\n00:07:59.907 --> 00:08:04.810\nWe will remain viable if we do,\nthose sorts of basic analysis questions.\n\n153\n00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.710\nSo this is where the business\ncase is brought to bear, right?\n\n154\n00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:14.301\nSomewhere between analysis and approval\nis gonna be straddling the business case.\n\n155\n00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:16.841\nThe business case is gonna\nstraddle those two components,\n\n156\n00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:19.550\nyou're gonna do a lot of analysis,\ncorrelate that analysis.\n\n157\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.513\nAnd eventually provide a business\ncase to say, you know what?\n\n158\n00:08:22.513 --> 00:08:27.742\nIf we do this, if we invest this amount\nof money and we do this and do that.\n\n159\n00:08:27.742 --> 00:08:30.326\nAnd introduce this new service,\n\n160\n00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:36.590\nwe will be able to get a return on our\ninvestment by a certain amount of time.\n\n161\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.730\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, I can't help but\nkind of just state the obvious here.\n\n162\n00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.630\nIt seems like this model is really\nin line with a lot of other\n\n163\n00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.942\nbodies like the PMBOK guide and\nlooking at even with Six SIGMA.\n\n164\n00:08:49.942 --> 00:08:51.566\nI'm looking at things\nwith the domain process.\n\n165\n00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:52.382\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n166\n00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:56.741\n&gt;&gt; It seems like a lot of tools that can\nbe used from other disciplines can be\n\n167\n00:08:56.741 --> 00:08:58.270\nhelpful here as well.\n\n168\n00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:58.988\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.\n\n169\n00:08:58.988 --> 00:09:04.326\nAbsolutely Cherokee, ITIL is\na framework for service management.\n\n170\n00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:06.537\nIf you have a framework for\ncontinuing improvement,\n\n171\n00:09:06.537 --> 00:09:08.216\nyou mentioned in domain cycle, right?\n\n172\n00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:11.070\nBeing able to continually\nimprove something, right?\n\n173\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.340\nBringing those good too, having a process\nor a project management discipline, right?\n\n174\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.360\nLooking at the risk analysis, having a\nrisk management discipline as well, right?\n\n175\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.355\nSo improvement, project, risk management,\nhaving those disciplines\n\n176\n00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:27.880\nwell-honed is going to help you\nin service management for sure.\n\n177\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.780\nITIL doesn't focus on those\nbecause those all ready exist.\n\n178\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.102\nSo they focus on the service\nmanagement piece.\n\n179\n00:09:33.102 --> 00:09:34.095\n&gt;&gt; Though I can see how it\nintegrates really well.\n\n180\n00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:38.310\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it's supposed to integrate,\nso very good point, right?\n\n181\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.990\nSo in this case, what you're doing you're\nbasically looking before you leap, right?\n\n182\n00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.235\nThe plan, do, check,\nact, the Deming Cycle.\n\n183\n00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:46.613\nSo says you plan to do something,\nyou do it and\n\n184\n00:09:46.613 --> 00:09:50.948\nthen you check to see if what you've done\nhas actually made a difference, right?\n\n185\n00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:54.050\nOr right now the service management,\nwe are kind of that planning stage,\n\n186\n00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.109\nwe're not doing it yet.\n\n187\n00:09:55.109 --> 00:09:59.598\nBut we're analysing and we had an idea\nthat we can move the needle in a positive\n\n188\n00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.542\ndirection if we do this, right?\n\n189\n00:10:01.542 --> 00:10:04.290\nThat's what the analysis\nstage is trying to discern.\n\n190\n00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.030\nNow, honestly the analysis\nstage could determine that wow,\n\n191\n00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.850\nthis is way too complex for us.\n\n192\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.828\nWe cannot do it, we don't have the money.\n\n193\n00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:16.960\nAnd the business outcome is not so\nimportant that we need to do this now.\n\n194\n00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.509\nLet's focus on this other one, right?\n\n195\n00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:21.503\nCuz remember, they're not only\ndealing with one idea at a time.\n\n196\n00:10:21.503 --> 00:10:25.913\nAnd you're probably gonna have to make\nsome prioritization decision as well along\n\n197\n00:10:25.913 --> 00:10:26.950\nthe way.\n\n198\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.819\nSo what an analysis stage or\n\n199\n00:10:28.819 --> 00:10:33.869\nphase is doing here in portfolio\nmanagement is just giving the data sets.\n\n200\n00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:37.721\nAnd the real life data, and\nperhaps some guessing data,\n\n201\n00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:43.110\nsome projections about why you might\nwant to consider approving this, right?\n\n202\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.856\nSo again, the analysis piece,\nthere's the risk factor.\n\n203\n00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:52.516\nYou're try to bring down risk, and\nare you trying to run the business,\n\n204\n00:10:52.516 --> 00:10:55.240\njust keeping the lights on?\n\n205\n00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.130\nIs it that type of investment?\n\n206\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.804\nAre you trying to grow the business or\n\n207\n00:10:59.804 --> 00:11:03.519\nare you trying to transform the business,\nright?\n\n208\n00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:05.400\nThat could affect your\nfunding levels again.\n\n209\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.987\nThink about that Barnes and\nNoble situation where,\n\n210\n00:11:07.987 --> 00:11:09.939\nmy gosh we are a brick and mortar store.\n\n211\n00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:14.030\nAnd Amazon is stealing our market share,\nright?\n\n212\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.640\nDo we wanna abandon brick and mortar,\ndo we wanna retain brick and mortar?\n\n213\n00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.169\nAnd also compete with them as\na book seller in that space.\n\n214\n00:11:21.169 --> 00:11:23.907\n&gt;&gt; And Terry,\nparticular situation comes to mind,\n\n215\n00:11:23.907 --> 00:11:26.720\nsomething that I had been\nreading about recently.\n\n216\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.194\nOne of these health supplement\ncompanies had been brought to\n\n217\n00:11:31.194 --> 00:11:34.799\nthe attention of\nthe Federal Trade Commission.\n\n218\n00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:38.705\nAnd they were required to pay out,\nit was something like $200 million.\n\n219\n00:11:38.705 --> 00:11:41.548\nI don't know, if I should say it or\nnot, the name of this company.\n\n220\n00:11:41.548 --> 00:11:45.690\nBut basically, FTC says look,\nthis really looks like a MLM,\n\n221\n00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.045\na pyramid scheme not\na legit business operation.\n\n222\n00:11:49.045 --> 00:11:52.621\nAnd the organization said no,\nlook, we're legitimate, and\n\n223\n00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:55.055\nas a matter of fact, we'll restructure.\n\n224\n00:11:55.055 --> 00:12:00.911\nWe'll pay our fine, we restructure our\norganization to adopt different models.\n\n225\n00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:04.080\nSo we can continue like you\nsaid to maintain our business.\n\n226\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.919\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n227\n00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:06.520\n&gt;&gt; Instead of just closing the doors.\n\n228\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.110\nSo sometimes there kinda\nforce to evaluate this.\n\n229\n00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.566\n&gt;&gt; Interesting example,\ninteresting example.\n\n230\n00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:14.151\nAlso points to the challenges a service\nprovider might have aren't always related\n\n231\n00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:15.074\nto technology.\n\n232\n00:12:15.074 --> 00:12:16.971\nIt could be regulatory issues-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n233\n00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:17.914\n&gt;&gt; That are involved, right?\n\n234\n00:12:17.914 --> 00:12:20.986\nAnd it could have been in good faith,\nthey're operating this business,\n\n235\n00:12:20.986 --> 00:12:22.334\nnot intending to break the law.\n\n236\n00:12:22.334 --> 00:12:25.023\nNow how are we gonna redefine ourselves,\netc., right?\n\n237\n00:12:25.023 --> 00:12:27.206\nThat could be transform, right?\n\n238\n00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:31.226\nSo the way this plays out on an exam,\nfirst of all, it's helpful to know\n\n239\n00:12:31.226 --> 00:12:35.980\nthe levels of investment or the levels\nof scope you might be dealing with.\n\n240\n00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:42.000\nRun the business means, if we don't invest\nhere, then we could fall over, right?\n\n241\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.530\nWe got to do this,\nwe gotta keep the lights on, so to speak.\n\n242\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:50.427\nWe're still going to be a hardware,\nhard cover book, seller, right?\n\n243\n00:12:50.427 --> 00:12:54.252\nSo we gotta think about how are we\ngoing to satisfy those markets for\n\n244\n00:12:54.252 --> 00:12:56.789\npeople that want a hard cover book, right?\n\n245\n00:12:56.789 --> 00:12:58.699\nAgain, using the Barnes and\nNobles scenario,\n\n246\n00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:00.460\nare we trying to grow the business?\n\n247\n00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.260\nMost commercial businesses are looking for\ngrowth.\n\n248\n00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.067\nEspecially if there are other\npublic trading company.\n\n249\n00:13:05.067 --> 00:13:08.138\nA public trading company is almost\ndriven exclusively by birth.\n\n250\n00:13:08.138 --> 00:13:10.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the investors are expecting\nsome kind of return, right?\n\n251\n00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:15.122\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so if those are the driving\nfactors then obviously you're gonna\n\n252\n00:13:15.122 --> 00:13:16.700\nhave to manage the risk.\n\n253\n00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.450\nAnd you see that the risk is\nbigger further up the pyramid you\n\n254\n00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.640\ngo is what this diagram is trying to say.\n\n255\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.128\nThe risk profile is wider,\n\n256\n00:13:25.128 --> 00:13:29.527\nif you really gonna try to transform the\nbusiness as opposed to just simply grow,\n\n257\n00:13:29.527 --> 00:13:33.168\nnot simply grow but grow the business or\nsimply keep the lights on.\n\n258\n00:13:33.168 --> 00:13:37.416\nSo your analysis phase is trying to\nascertain where are we on this risk\n\n259\n00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:41.004\nprofile, are we trying to transform or\ntrying to grow, or\n\n260\n00:13:41.004 --> 00:13:42.850\njust keep the lights on?\n\n261\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.280\nWhat kind of initiative is this, right?\n\n262\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.391\nThat's gonna try to inform the decision,\nokay?\n\n263\n00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:52.852\nAnd then as you're analyzing, you're gonna\nclearly look at your existing services,\n\n264\n00:13:52.852 --> 00:13:57.540\nlook at the investment you're gonna try to\ncome up with the best idea and priorities.\n\n265\n00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.160\nWhat should we do next?\n\n266\n00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.883\nAnd ultimately probably make\na recommendation through a business case.\n\n267\n00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:06.170\nAnd this business case is going\nto straddle the approval piece.\n\n268\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.954\nThis Option Space Tool in interesting and\nsomewhat convoluted.\n\n269\n00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:16.351\nThere's lot of information on here, but\n\n270\n00:14:16.351 --> 00:14:19.030\nif you look at the three\nshaded areas in green.\n\n271\n00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:24.348\nIs really trying to discern\nthe value to cost ratio, right?\n\n272\n00:14:24.348 --> 00:14:28.812\nAlong the left, we have whether\nit's an existing market space or\n\n273\n00:14:28.812 --> 00:14:30.860\na new market space?\n\n274\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.760\nSo what's a market space really?\n\n275\n00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.600\nA market space, it's an opportunity.\n\n276\n00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.550\nIt's either an opportunity to provide\nnew customers your existing services.\n\n277\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.410\nSo you already got services you're\njust looking for new customers.\n\n278\n00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.980\nThat's one type of market space or\n\n279\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.420\nis it finding new services for\nexisting service, customers I should say.\n\n280\n00:14:54.420 --> 00:15:00.860\nNew services for existing customers or\nnew customers for existing services.\n\n281\n00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.490\nThose are opportunities,\nthat's market space.\n\n282\n00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:04.708\nIs it an existing market space?\n\n283\n00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:06.207\nIn other words,\ndo we already have these customers?\n\n284\n00:15:06.207 --> 00:15:09.478\nIs it something we already do or\nis it a new market space?\n\n285\n00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:13.556\nWe're trying to break into something,\nright?\n\n286\n00:15:13.556 --> 00:15:18.682\nSo that's one side here, over the top is\nnow you're doing your market analysis.\n\n287\n00:15:18.682 --> 00:15:20.369\nIs it an over-served market?\n\n288\n00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.170\nDo they have plenty of options?\n\n289\n00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.630\nThe customers need here, right?\n\n290\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.530\nOr is it a under-served market.\n\n291\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.735\nAnd then of course on the right,\nis it new customers or existing customers?\n\n292\n00:15:32.735 --> 00:15:39.330\nSo new or existing services, new or\nexisting customers, where are you?\n\n293\n00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.994\n&gt;&gt; So by using this tool,\nyou can graphically decide, okay,\n\n294\n00:15:42.994 --> 00:15:46.677\nmaybe if I am in a market that\nis completely over saturated.\n\n295\n00:15:46.677 --> 00:15:50.127\nWhat can we do depending on where\nyou fall within this matrix?\n\n296\n00:15:50.127 --> 00:15:54.306\nYou can say, what can really set\nus apart here, define our company?\n\n297\n00:15:54.306 --> 00:15:56.340\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nHow do we differentiate ourselves in this\n\n298\n00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.119\nbusy market place?\n\n299\n00:15:57.119 --> 00:15:59.069\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Are we the highest quality?\n\n300\n00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:01.478\nAre we the fastest?\n\n301\n00:16:01.478 --> 00:16:03.820\nAre we the most flexible?\n\n302\n00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.150\nAre we all the above?\n\n303\n00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.190\nThose sort of things.\n\n304\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.410\nAnd again,\nnot to get too lost in these details.\n\n305\n00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.280\nYou need to analyze the market space to\nsee, is it overserved or underserved?\n\n306\n00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.309\nAnd determine whether or not it's a new\nservice for you or new customers for you.\n\n307\n00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:21.336\nAnd manage the delta among those.\n\n308\n00:16:21.336 --> 00:16:25.870\nSo, looking at this tool,\ndon't worry about the detail so much.\n\n309\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.590\nThink about the big picture here.\n\n310\n00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.390\nYou're either offering new\nservices to existing customers.\n\n311\n00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.910\nThat's one way to consider it.\n\n312\n00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.270\nOr you're offering your existing\ncustomers new services.\n\n313\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:40.280\nIn either scenario, you need to be\nanalyzing what does the customer need.\n\n314\n00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.840\nDo they already have other options?\n\n315\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.560\nIf they do,\nhow do we distinguish ourselves, right?\n\n316\n00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.660\nOr are they completely underserved?\n\n317\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.319\nAnd we could sell these things\nall day no matter what we do.\n\n318\n00:16:49.319 --> 00:16:50.947\nIt could be the case, right?\n\n319\n00:16:50.947 --> 00:16:56.318\nSo, imagine again the demand for\ncloud services\n\n320\n00:16:56.318 --> 00:17:02.750\nten years ago versus hosted\ncloud services now, right?\n\n321\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.410\nThe demand was driven by the technology.\n\n322\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.891\nKept getting better and better and\nbetter, more people came and\n\n323\n00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:11.313\nit does play out that way.\n\n324\n00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:15.941\nSo, if it is underserved,\nyou'll see on the right side here.\n\n325\n00:17:15.941 --> 00:17:20.713\nUnderserved is probably gonna be a good\nidea to find a way to serve that\n\n326\n00:17:20.713 --> 00:17:23.030\nmarket and invest in it, right?\n\n327\n00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.590\nAll right, good deal.\n\n328\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.980\nNow, looking toward the approval stage.\n\n329\n00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.080\nHere it is in context.\n\n330\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.030\nWe've got the definition,\nmoved to analysis, now to the approval.\n\n331\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.180\nAnd what's going to straddle this\nis that good old business case.\n\n332\n00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.839\nYou can see it in this graphic really\nnicely here near the top of the screen.\n\n333\n00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:45.170\nLet me get my laser pointer going here.\n\n334\n00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.700\nAnd you can see the business\ncase right there.\n\n335\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.370\nIt's straddling the analysis phase and\nthe approval stage, as it should, right?\n\n336\n00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.880\nAnd notice this got this\nlittle curly thing.\n\n337\n00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.810\nIt's actually a document, right?\n\n338\n00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.080\nIt is something produced.\n\n339\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.510\nIt's a deliverable.\n\n340\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.050\nAnd it is at the nexus of analysis and\napproval.\n\n341\n00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.460\nSo, you've done all your good analysis,\nnow you wanna make a case for approval.\n\n342\n00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.040\nWell, the case is called a business case,\nexcept for the justification.\n\n343\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.930\nWe wanna spend $1.5 million this year, and\nhere's what we expect to get out of it.\n\n344\n00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.460\nAnd why we expect to get it,\nand why we should, right?\n\n345\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.812\nWhy we should go this way.\n\n346\n00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.813\nAnd again, I'd consider it one at a time.\n\n347\n00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:29.570\nRemember, Service Portfolio Management\ncould have lots of things in the air to\n\n348\n00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.730\nconsider.\n\n349\n00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.900\nAnd these steering groups at\nthe top of the strategy discussions\n\n350\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.270\nare gonna need to be analyzed and\nprepped several different business cases.\n\n351\n00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.530\nWhich one of these are we gonna choose and\nwhen, right?\n\n352\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.850\nSo, as you can see here, the business case\nis coming through for the approval stage.\n\n353\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:50.210\nAnd at the approval phase,\nyou're looking at, is it feasible?\n\n354\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.420\nIs it somewhat should be doing?\n\n355\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.870\nIt's pretty down straight forward.\n\n356\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.453\nSo, let's have a look at this, right?\n\n357\n00:18:57.657 --> 00:18:59.467\nShould we keep the service?\n\n358\n00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:01.499\nShould we bring in a new service?\n\n359\n00:19:01.499 --> 00:19:04.172\nShould we change a service, etc?\n\n360\n00:19:04.172 --> 00:19:09.695\nSo, you see the ideas of retaining,\nreplacing, rationalizing.\n\n361\n00:19:09.695 --> 00:19:13.967\nMaybe what rationalize, in simple terms,\nit just means simplify it and\n\n362\n00:19:13.967 --> 00:19:16.220\nmake it more cost effective, right?\n\n363\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.882\nAs an example, the business intelligence\nservice, if you want to call it that,\n\n364\n00:19:22.882 --> 00:19:27.606\nwas never really centralized in a way or\nnever was looked as a service.\n\n365\n00:19:27.606 --> 00:19:30.017\nThis group came up with\ntheir own BI solutions,\n\n366\n00:19:30.017 --> 00:19:33.060\nthis other group came up\nwith their own BI solution.\n\n367\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.760\nAll of a sudden, we had 38\ndifferent BI solutions spread out\n\n368\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.870\nacross our service portfolio, right?\n\n369\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:46.918\nRationalizing these, do we need 38 of\nthese or could we do this with five or\n\n370\n00:19:46.918 --> 00:19:50.658\ncould we bring them all\ntogether under one, right?\n\n371\n00:19:50.658 --> 00:19:52.454\nThose sorts of things.\n\n372\n00:19:52.454 --> 00:19:53.857\nAnd refactoring.\n\n373\n00:19:53.857 --> 00:19:59.684\nRefactoring is taking your services and\nreapplying them to other things,\n\n374\n00:19:59.684 --> 00:20:05.580\nlike using an existing service and\nserving other customers with it.\n\n375\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:12.900\nCould be that or even downsizing the\nservice and doing a charge back mechanism.\n\n376\n00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.080\nIf you want that level of service,\nyou got to pay for it next time, right?\n\n377\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.750\nAnd then you got the ideas\nof renewing which is simple.\n\n378\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.904\nTurn the crank yeah,\nwe'll keep the service going.\n\n379\n00:20:21.904 --> 00:20:30.070\nRefund it as in refund, but\nreapply funding for it.\n\n380\n00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.240\nAnd then, of course,\nretire could be the decision as well.\n\n381\n00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.932\nYou know it's time to get\nrid of this thing, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:36.456 --> 00:20:41.496\nSo, ultimately, what approval is going\nto do is saying yes, we're going\n\n383\n00:20:41.496 --> 00:20:47.660\nto let this idea of a service move from\nthe pipeline into the catalog, right?\n\n384\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.210\nMaybe you gotta go get\nsome more information, so\n\n385\n00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.210\nyou send a change proposal downstream\nto your change management people.\n\n386\n00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.720\nAnd say hey,\nwhat's it gonna take to get this done?\n\n387\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:01.650\nGive us an estimate of time,\neffort and expense, right?\n\n388\n00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.280\nSo then if change management says here's\nwhat we can do, yep, we're ready to go\n\n389\n00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.730\nthrough with this, we can handle this\nin our portfolio of change management.\n\n390\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.810\nOur project portfolio might have\nto be brought into play and\n\n391\n00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.300\nproject management team says\nyes we have the bandwidth.\n\n392\n00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.880\nHere's what we going to do there.\n\n393\n00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.190\nThe change proposal gonna include\nthat type of activity in analysis.\n\n394\n00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.140\nAnd then ultimately,\nyou can lead toward chartering a service.\n\n395\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.300\nSo, approval is yep, we're gonna do it.\n\n396\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.000\nChartering is the actual,\n\n397\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.390\ngetting the right people, named, knowing\nwho the stakeholder's are gonna be.\n\n398\n00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.627\n&gt;&gt; Choosing your champions, your sponsors,\n&gt;&gt; And your good pal.\n\n399\n00:21:36.627 --> 00:21:38.206\n&gt;&gt; Your project managers,\n&gt;&gt; All of those.\n\n400\n00:21:38.206 --> 00:21:39.646\n&gt;&gt; Project teams, yes.\n\n401\n00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:41.060\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n402\n00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.604\nYour influencer,\nthe people who do the influencing,\n\n403\n00:21:44.604 --> 00:21:48.400\nyour trainers,\nyour overall scope exactly, all right?\n\n404\n00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.600\nSo, as you move from\napproval towards charter,\n\n405\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.380\nyou see a lot of words charter here.\n\n406\n00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.480\nThis is the decisions of what\nthe charter's gonna look like.\n\n407\n00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.840\nYou're doing that in approval stage.\n\n408\n00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.930\nWho needs to be on point?\n\n409\n00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.560\nName your champions,\nname your stakeholders, etc.\n\n410\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:08.000\nAnd ultimately, determine\nthe updates to the portfolio itself.\n\n411\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.780\nYes, we're going to approve this.\n\n412\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.560\nLet's add it to the catalog.\n\n413\n00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.070\nWe'll get on to the chartering here next.\n\n414\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:19.010\nSo, from the approval stage over to\nthe charter stage is what's happening now.\n\n415\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.050\nSo, if you've made\nthe decision at the approval,\n\n416\n00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.070\nwhat approval is we've made a decision.\n\n417\n00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.530\nWe're going to retire this.\n\n418\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.620\nWe're going to make this\navailable in the portfolio,\n\n419\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.100\nfrom the portfolio to the catalog etc.\n\n420\n00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.900\nIt's going to now be\nthe communication piece.\n\n421\n00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.680\nSo, all the approval is\nthe steps of saying yes,\n\n422\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.270\nchartering is the communication of that,\nyes.\n\n423\n00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.980\nAnd it's letting everyone know\nhere's what we're gonna do.\n\n424\n00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.270\nSo, it's formal announcements,\nit's a stake in the ground.\n\n425\n00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:53.012\nProject will commence, that sort of thing.\n\n426\n00:22:53.012 --> 00:22:55.200\nThat's what chartering is.\n\n427\n00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.190\n&gt;&gt; You're usually offering it as\na physical, like a deliverable,\n\n428\n00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.200\nlike that tangible project to charter.\n\n429\n00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.829\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nit is a deliverable, that's right.\n\n430\n00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.640\nHere are the players, here's\nthe document that describes the players,\n\n431\n00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.880\nhere's the project manager,\nhere's the timelines.\n\n432\n00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.452\nHere is the expected\nreturn on the investment.\n\n433\n00:23:09.452 --> 00:23:11.030\nHere is why we're doing it.\n\n434\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.103\nGetting people excited about it too,\n\n435\n00:23:13.103 --> 00:23:17.132\nit becomes the first marketing piece\nif you will of your service, right?\n\n436\n00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.150\nSo, what gets this thing started?\n\n437\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:22.920\nSomething triggers it.\n\n438\n00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.780\nWe've talked about these before,\nso brief review here.\n\n439\n00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.240\nWe got triggers that can\ncome from the business.\n\n440\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.420\nThey can come from CSI.\n\n441\n00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.470\nThey can come from financial\nmanagement for IT services.\n\n442\n00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.093\nHey, this is costing way too much or\n\n443\n00:23:35.093 --> 00:23:40.434\nit could come with it's costing this but\nI don't see the value, right?\n\n444\n00:23:40.434 --> 00:23:43.264\nSo, there could be lots of triggers for\nSPM, right?\n\n445\n00:23:43.264 --> 00:23:44.948\nWe've talked about those before.\n\n446\n00:23:44.948 --> 00:23:47.630\nIn similar ways, we've talked about these.\n\n447\n00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.859\nThe inputs to Service Portfolio Management\ncome from different locations.\n\n448\n00:23:50.859 --> 00:23:55.120\nImprovement plans, strategy plans,\nproject updates, requests,\n\n449\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.009\nwater cooler conversations.\n\n450\n00:23:57.009 --> 00:23:58.680\nWe talked about those earlier.\n\n451\n00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.227\nRight, and of course the output, the\nPortfolio itself is one of the outputs as\n\n452\n00:24:02.227 --> 00:24:06.049\nService Portfolio Management, the Service\nCharters as Cherokee just mentioned,\n\n453\n00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:08.060\nis actually a deliverable, is a document.\n\n454\n00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:13.340\nThe Service Charter,\nStrategy plans are also part of this.\n\n455\n00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:19.560\nReports on RIOI, there's a miss-type\nthere, Reports of Return On Investment.\n\n456\n00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.330\nNot RIO, right?\n\n457\n00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:22.940\nAnd then of course any change proposals,\n\n458\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.350\nformal document that says this\nis what we propose to do, right?\n\n459\n00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.760\nSome of the outputs there.\n\n460\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.740\nWe've also talked about these interfaces,\ninterfaces with other processes.\n\n461\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.610\nIt's fairly intuitive when\nwe talked about this,\n\n462\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.660\nit's going to interface with other Design,\nelements as well as,\n\n463\n00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.480\nstrategic elements, financial management\netc., nothing really new here, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.530\nAnd of course we talk about Information\nManagement, I actually invited you not to\n\n465\n00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:58.826\nget too lost in the details of the data\nmodel and I want to to still-.\n\n466\n00:24:58.826 --> 00:25:03.050\nWhat do we mean by loss is, you got to\nget the process right first, anyway.\n\n467\n00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.690\nIt's gonna be a necessary evil that\nyou figure out how all this data\n\n468\n00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.430\nworks together.\n\n469\n00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:10.090\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like training wheels before\nyou just head on out into a dirt bike.\n\n470\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:10.970\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n471\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.370\nSo it would not necessarily be good for\nme to design the data model for\n\n472\n00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.710\nyou in any way in this class for\nsure, not gonna get it done.\n\n473\n00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.970\nNo two organizations\nare gonna be the same.\n\n474\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.970\nI've worked in some organizations small\nenough that they manage report portfolio\n\n475\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.510\nin a spreadsheet with perfect tables,\nright?\n\n476\n00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.120\nThat wouldn't work for large organization.\n\n477\n00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.670\nWith, you know, 220 services and 100,000\npeople and that many different customers.\n\n478\n00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.850\nSo it was more of a relational database\nwith of different databases feeding up\n\n479\n00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.590\nto a common data model.\n\n480\n00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.860\nCertainly, you're going to have\nan information management challenge.\n\n481\n00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.793\nWhat you're looking for, exam takers,\nand what you're looking for\n\n482\n00:25:50.793 --> 00:25:52.820\nas operational practitioners\nof Service Portfolio.\n\n483\n00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.530\nYou're going to be looking for\na way to integrate these data sources\n\n484\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.920\nas much a possible,\nas much as is practical at any given time.\n\n485\n00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.110\nKeep in mind that it's probably going to\nbe more of a journey than a destination.\n\n486\n00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:09.140\nYou'll never have the model 100% right,\nbecause you'll always need to be tweaking\n\n487\n00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.040\nthis and tweaking that to\nget the appropriate reports.\n\n488\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.060\nAnd things you might need, okay?\n\n489\n00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.590\nThat's service portfolio management.\n\n490\n00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry.\n\n491\n00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.090\nSo we are short on time for this episode.\n\n492\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.000\nDo you have any final thoughts or\ntips that could be useful for us?\n\n493\n00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks Cherokee.\n\n494\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:27.270\nActually, just another reminder\nthat my lecture is not enough.\n\n495\n00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.560\nYou're going to need some\nself studies as well.\n\n496\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.570\nAnd there's a good exercise related\nto service portfolio management and\n\n497\n00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.530\nit's aptly named.\n\n498\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.440\nService Portfolio Management one,\nyou'll see there.\n\n499\n00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.900\nThe suggested time is\njust about 60 minutes.\n\n500\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:45.430\nIt's available for download, it's in\nthe zip file above here for share files.\n\n501\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:51.450\nAnd you get this one, download it,\ngo through it, find some value in it and\n\n502\n00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.730\nreinforce this many many top\npurchasers are for school management.\n\n503\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.080\nDon't forget the self study.\n\n504\n00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan.\n\n505\n00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:57.826\nThank you Terry.\n\n506\n00:26:57.826 --> 00:26:59.530\n&gt;&gt; You bet.\n&gt;&gt; And thank you ladies and gentleman for\n\n507\n00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.230\njoining us today.\n\n508\n00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.400\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n509\n00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.500\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n510\n00:27:04.500

00:00:12.165\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:15.243\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen to\nyour ITIL Service Offerings and\n\n5\n00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:16.690\nAgreements series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.600\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.452\nIn this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:24.560\nwe will be looking at defining our\nservice catalog management processes.\n\n9\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.290\nAnd with us today back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.780\nThank you for joining us Terry.\n\n11\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.700\n&gt;&gt; As always Cherokee,\n\n12\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.570\nhappy to be here and\nplenty to discuss here on service catalog.\n\n13\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.900\nThe good news is,\nthe catalog is part of the portfolio, so\n\n14\n00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.630\nwe've kinda done some of\nthe heavy lifting already, right?\n\n15\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.300\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, I know we had three episodes\nlooking at our portfolio management but\n\n16\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.040\nwhen we're talking about our catalog\nmanagement, how do those two relate?\n\n17\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good question.\n\n18\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.710\nThe catalog is certainly part of\nthe portfolio and you may recall from\n\n19\n00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.770\nprevious episodes that I encouraged you\nto think about the processes more so\n\n20\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.820\nthan the data set, the data model.\n\n21\n00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.420\nThat's certainly true as it relates\nto service portfolio management and\n\n22\n00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.750\nservice catalog management and\nthe differentiation they have.\n\n23\n00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.570\nService portfolio management as a process\nis focused on the strategic decision.\n\n24\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.580\nWhat services should we have?\n\n25\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.880\nAre we offering them?\n\n26\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.820\nAnd if we have services that\nare not providing value,\n\n27\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.220\nis it time time to get rid of them?\n\n28\n00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.270\nSo that's when we talk about the pipeline,\nthe catalog,\n\n29\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.570\nthe portion of the portfolio that has\nthe services that we've agreed to offer,\n\n30\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.880\nright, and then of course,\nretired services.\n\n31\n00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.120\nNow as a process,\n\n32\n00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.630\nservice catalog management is maintaining\nthe details of that one portion.\n\n33\n00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.610\nSo if you think of it process-wise,\nthey have different focuses.\n\n34\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.740\nStrategic decisions are made\nthrough service portfolio.\n\n35\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.210\nTactical decisions of\nupdating the catalog,\n\n36\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.340\nkeeping it current, making sure that\nthe right views are available to the right\n\n37\n00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.430\naudiences is what the service\ncatalog management process is about.\n\n38\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.730\nSo, I think it's easy to distinguish the\ndifference between portfolio management\n\n39\n00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.750\nand catalog management when\nyou consider the processes.\n\n40\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.186\nWhere it's get kinda confusing is\nwhen you consider that they're\n\n41\n00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:06.588\nusing a data-set that's uncommon, right?\n\n42\n00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:09.140\nThe catalog is part of the portfolio.\n\n43\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.179\nSo again, to distinguish these,\n\n44\n00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:15.331\nthe process of Service Portfolio\nManagement is a strategic process,\n\n45\n00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:19.926\ntrying to discern what services should\nwe offer for what business outcomes.\n\n46\n00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:24.773\nAnd if they're not providing any value,\nto get rid of them, the pipeline,\n\n47\n00:02:24.773 --> 00:02:27.215\nthe catalog, and retired services.\n\n48\n00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:31.142\nCatalog management is focused just on\nthat one part of the portfolio and\n\n49\n00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:34.023\nit's more of a tactical\nnature in making sure that it\n\n50\n00:02:34.023 --> 00:02:36.574\nhas the right information\nat the right time and\n\n51\n00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:41.108\nthat that information is exposed to the\nright customers in the right way, right.\n\n52\n00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:43.640\nSo a lot different on the process side.\n\n53\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.300\nAll right, so again,\nwe kind of know the heavy lifting.\n\n54\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.600\nWhat is the catalog, right?\n\n55\n00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.680\nIf you look at the slide here,\n\n56\n00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.190\nyou'll see that the catalog covers all\nservices that are already in transition.\n\n57\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.810\nThey've already gone through and have been\nbrought into live environment, right, or\n\n58\n00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.180\nthey've been approved for the same, right?\n\n59\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.730\nSo again, if you think about portfolio,\n\n60\n00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.900\nportfolio is making decision about\na service and a pipeline saying,\n\n61\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.640\nyeah, we want this service to happen,\nwe've approved it, we've chartered it.\n\n62\n00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.560\nWell, portfolio's done its business.\n\n63\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.130\nIt's now supposed to move to the catalog.\n\n64\n00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.430\nWell, that's when service catalog\nmanagement takes over, right, and\n\n65\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.780\nthey'll make sure that the appropriate\ndetails are put in there and\n\n66\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.560\nthat those details are exposed to\nthe right people at the right time.\n\n67\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.180\nSo that's why it says here it's services\nthat are already live and those that\n\n68\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.460\nhave been approved to become live, is\nwhat service management scope is, right?\n\n69\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.820\nSo the purpose is to make sure\nthe details of all services are stored\n\n70\n00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.750\nappropriately and\nmade view-able to the right people, right?\n\n71\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.638\nSimple as that.\n\n72\n00:03:45.638 --> 00:03:47.786\nAs its listed here, to provide and\n\n73\n00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:52.976\nmaintain a single source of consistent\ninformation on all operational services,\n\n74\n00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:56.235\nand those that have been\nprepared to be run, right,\n\n75\n00:03:56.235 --> 00:04:00.850\nas well as ensuring it is widely\navailable to those authorized to view it.\n\n76\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.860\nNow if you consider, remember we talked\nabout core services and enabling services?\n\n77\n00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.510\nIn other words, a core service as an\nexample, we have email as a core service.\n\n78\n00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.290\nEveryone gets to use it, but underneath\nthe code, you have these enabling or\n\n79\n00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.270\nsupporting services like servers and\ndatabases and network.\n\n80\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.756\nWell underneath the hood, customers aren't\nnecessarily concerned about all of those\n\n81\n00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:26.780\nservices in the background.\n\n82\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.403\nThey're concerned about email,\nhow do I get email?\n\n83\n00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:34.036\nAnd the catalog, you need to expose those\ndetails to those types of viewers, right.\n\n84\n00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:39.550\nBut an IT practitioner might need to see\nwhat services are underneath the hood.\n\n85\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.260\nSo this catalog needs to expose those\nkind of services to an IT audience.\n\n86\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.833\nSo you kind of see that service\ncatalog management is really\n\n87\n00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:52.497\na tactical exercise making sure\nthe right information about\n\n88\n00:04:52.497 --> 00:04:57.540\nservices is exposed to the right\npeople in the right ways, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.409\nSo the scope, again, all of the services\nthat have already been defined, right.\n\n90\n00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.351\nAnd those services that are about to\nbe brought into our operations, right,\n\n91\n00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:10.620\nall those service package\ndescriptions meaning,\n\n92\n00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.118\nlike if you subscribe to email\nas one of your services,\n\n93\n00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:19.080\ndo you also get instant messaging\nas part of the package or not?\n\n94\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.400\nThe service catalog would describe\nthose additional services.\n\n95\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.580\nYou might consider that\nlike a cable TV provider.\n\n96\n00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.180\nThe different packages you can get from\nthem, you get level one, level two.\n\n97\n00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.980\n&gt;&gt; Like our triple play.\n\n98\n00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.620\nWe've got our voice.\n\n99\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.180\nWhat is it our data?\n\n100\n00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah good point.\n\n101\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.980\n&gt;&gt; What's the other?\n\n102\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.390\nCable, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cable, that's right.\n\n103\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.950\n&gt;&gt; TV.\n\n104\n00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.410\nYeah, how they package.\n\n105\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.048\nYou get internet, cable and\nphone, and then under the cable,\n\n106\n00:05:41.048 --> 00:05:45.340\nTV subscriptions,\ndo you get premium channels or not.\n\n107\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.820\nDo you get HD or not, DVR included or\nnot, those types of things.\n\n108\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.170\nSo the catalog is going to\nexpose those offerings,\n\n109\n00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.310\nthose packages in meaningful ways\nto customers as well, right.\n\n110\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.540\nSo again, the scope is how does a customer\nget access to these services, who do they\n\n111\n00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.090\ncontact if they have issues, what are the\noperating hours, those types of things.\n\n112\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.645\nThat's the information\nstored in the catalog and\n\n113\n00:06:11.645 --> 00:06:16.430\nas a service catalog management process is\nplaying out, it's making sure the right\n\n114\n00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.490\ndata is presented to the right\ncustomers in meaningful ways.\n\n115\n00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.940\nAll right, it is a single source.\n\n116\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.940\nThe business knows where to go to look for\nwhat services are being offered.\n\n117\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.540\nIt does need to have\na customer facing view.\n\n118\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.045\nAnother reason why it gets special\nattention as its own process is that this\n\n119\n00:06:39.045 --> 00:06:44.320\nis exposed to a company if you will,\nit's exposed to guests, customers, right?\n\n120\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.630\nWhereas the pipeline and\n\n121\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.540\nretired services, those two portions\nof the portfolio are probably for\n\n122\n00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.105\nIT use only, right, they're not\nnecessarily exposed to customers.\n\n123\n00:06:54.105 --> 00:06:57.025\nBut the catalogue is intended\nto be exposed to customers,\n\n124\n00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:58.485\nas well as some other groups.\n\n125\n00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:02.661\n&gt;&gt; In my mind Terry, I'm thinking,\nperfect example here at ITPRO TV,\n\n126\n00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:06.921\nwe could go ahead and classify our\ncourse library as our catalog here.\n\n127\n00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:10.517\nSo for instance, any kind of order\nvideos like those other phases that you\n\n128\n00:07:10.517 --> 00:07:13.185\nare talking about,\nwe could go ahead and retire them or\n\n129\n00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:16.375\neven if they were unlike beta phase,\nduring that analyse phase,\n\n130\n00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:20.940\ndifferent components like that, but here\nwe're talking about the outward phasing.\n\n131\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.870\nYou guys are logging on to IT PRO.TV,\nyou couldn't see the different layout,\n\n132\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.380\nthe different descriptions and\nthen go ahead and view those videos.\n\n133\n00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.920\n&gt;&gt; That's very good.\n\n134\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.310\nAnd I think another way to create example,\n\n135\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.810\nanother example related to IT PRO.TV is\npart of your service obviously is this,\n\n136\n00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.820\nthe content being delivered to\ndesktops through streaming video.\n\n137\n00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.490\nBut you also offer services that allow for\nfile downloads.\n\n138\n00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.660\nYou also add services that are available\nfor forums and discussion groups.\n\n139\n00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.854\nSo that's also part of\nyour packaging as well.\n\n140\n00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:54.088\nThat was a good example of the content,\nbut\n\n141\n00:07:54.088 --> 00:07:57.140\npart of your service model is\nnot just streaming content.\n\n142\n00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.579\nYou have other things wrapped around it.\n\n143\n00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:01.369\nThis chat Your Facebook interface.\n\n144\n00:08:01.369 --> 00:08:04.597\nThis is also part of your service that\nyou're developing and making available,\n\n145\n00:08:04.597 --> 00:08:07.160\nI should say developing,\nmaking it available to folks.\n\n146\n00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.390\nSo, as folks use your service,\nthey should have the ability to understand\n\n147\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.730\nthese other service offerings,\nother parts.\n\n148\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.680\nWhere do I get the downloads,\nhow do I join the form, right?\n\n149\n00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.508\nSo your catalog If it's something\nexposed through you're Web interface,\n\n150\n00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:24.036\nwhich is an appropriate place to do it,\nyou're effectively managing\n\n151\n00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:28.307\nyour catalog or services by exposing those\nand orient people to the right location.\n\n152\n00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.789\nGood examples, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:30.789 --> 00:08:34.550\nAll right,\nthe value of the business again,\n\n154\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:38.500\nif you can't expose what services you're\noffering and those serves remember\n\n155\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.480\nportfolio is also going to ensure that\nthe business outcomes are also supported.\n\n156\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.430\nThen you're having a more realistic\nconversation with your customers.\n\n157\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.460\nAnd what I mean by realistic is it's clear\nyou're not just a mysterious call center.\n\n158\n00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.116\nWe're not sure what you do IT,\nbut you should cost a lot, right?\n\n159\n00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:57.806\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not too unusual from\n\n160\n00:08:57.806 --> 00:09:01.580\nsome customer perspective, internal\ncustomers or external customers or both.\n\n161\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.288\nWe're not sure what you do, but you should\ncost a lot, is not a great place to be.\n\n162\n00:09:04.288 --> 00:09:06.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n&gt;&gt; Is not a great place to be.\n\n163\n00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:09.947\nBut I think there are some\nrelationships out there like that for\n\n164\n00:09:09.947 --> 00:09:13.850\ninternal service providers where\nthey're not sure what you do.\n\n165\n00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.690\nDefining yourself as a service\nprovider is step one.\n\n166\n00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think it'd be a good\nconversation that starts off with,\n\n167\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.376\nremind me again why I pay you?\n\n168\n00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:24.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.358\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right, but\n\n170\n00:09:25.358 --> 00:09:29.022\nthe service portfolio is in a very\nexplicit way to say, here's what we do for\n\n171\n00:09:29.022 --> 00:09:31.332\nyou and\nhow much serves your business outcome?\n\n172\n00:09:31.332 --> 00:09:33.706\nWe're helping you find oil,\nwe're helping you extract it,\n\n173\n00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.082\nwe're helping you distribute it.\n\n174\n00:09:35.082 --> 00:09:37.165\nHere's the services that do those things.\n\n175\n00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:38.658\nWe're helping you communicate.\n\n176\n00:09:38.658 --> 00:09:41.820\nWe're helping you file your\nregulatory compliance documents.\n\n177\n00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.410\nWe're helping you store\nyour information securely.\n\n178\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.960\nWe have security services.\n\n179\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.370\nWe're making sure that when the CEO sends\nan e-mail, only the CEO is sending it and\n\n180\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.560\nnot some imposter,\nthose types of things, right?\n\n181\n00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.250\nSo we're managing those things\non behalf of you business and\n\n182\n00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.200\nthese are the services\nthat allow that to happen.\n\n183\n00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.857\nIf you have those in a portfolio\nwhich the catalog is part of,\n\n184\n00:10:03.857 --> 00:10:08.016\nyou have a very nice place to say,\nhere is what we're doing for you and\n\n185\n00:10:08.016 --> 00:10:10.476\nwhat business outcomes are supported.\n\n186\n00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:12.432\nRight, it changes the conversation,\n\n187\n00:10:12.432 --> 00:10:15.060\nyou are no longer a mysterious\ncall center, right.\n\n188\n00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.610\nYou are someone who's providing service\nand that's a different place to be.\n\n189\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's okay to remind them of\nwhat you are providing that's why we need\n\n190\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.379\nto do, right.\n\n191\n00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:22.971\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n192\n00:10:22.971 --> 00:10:26.390\nit's also a point of conversation\non what can we be doing different.\n\n193\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.940\nHere is what we are currently offering.\n\n194\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.870\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Are we missing something, right?\n\n195\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.243\nIt becomes a way to have a very meaningful\nconversation with your business\n\n196\n00:10:34.243 --> 00:10:35.451\ncustomers, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:41.390\nSo the processes, activities,\nmethods, and techniques.\n\n198\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.040\nYou're gonna be documenting these things.\n\n199\n00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.670\nYou're gonna have service definitions and\ndescriptions.\n\n200\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.760\nWho is the service owner?\n\n201\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.823\nHow do I reach that service owner?\n\n202\n00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:52.310\nWhat are the hours of operation, etc.\n\n203\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.240\nSo as a process,\n\n204\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.780\nservice catalog management is a lot\nmore tactical than portfolio.\n\n205\n00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.590\nEven though they're\nusing a common dataset,\n\n206\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:06.347\nservice catalog management is managing\none of those at a very tactical level,\n\n207\n00:11:06.347 --> 00:11:11.174\nmaking sure it's up-to-date, always\ncurrent and that is available again to\n\n208\n00:11:11.174 --> 00:11:15.087\nthe right people at the right\nlocation at the right time, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:15.087 --> 00:11:19.571\nSo, why guess the catalog movement, well,\nyou might guess portfolio management\n\n210\n00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:23.020\nitself motivates movement\ninto the catalog, right?\n\n211\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.320\nChanges to business requirements and\n\n212\n00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.320\nservices are going to get service\nportfolio management engaged.\n\n213\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.150\nRequest for changes, change proposals.\n\n214\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:35.463\nVarious things could require\na distal changes in the catalog.\n\n215\n00:11:35.463 --> 00:11:37.520\nThe service owners change.\n\n216\n00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.110\nThe service owners moved on.\n\n217\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.822\nThe service now has new customers and\nserving new businesses, right?\n\n218\n00:11:42.822 --> 00:11:46.460\nAll sorts of things\ncould cause a trigger to\n\n219\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.630\nthe catalog portion of the portfolio,\nokay?\n\n220\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.615\nAs we've talked about the same kind\nof things that motivate changes in\n\n221\n00:11:53.615 --> 00:11:56.714\nthe portfolio could be motivating\nchanges here in the catalog, right?\n\n222\n00:11:56.714 --> 00:12:00.020\nA little bit of acronym\ncheck in this graphic here.\n\n223\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.480\nYou got BIA,\nthat's Business Impact Analysis.\n\n224\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.290\nIt could be that your services currently\nbeing offered at one point had one level\n\n225\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.210\nof business impact which is a positive\nthing by the way not so negative thing.\n\n226\n00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:17.457\nOne level of impact and then as time\nwent on it has a distant level impact.\n\n227\n00:12:17.457 --> 00:12:22.388\nGive you and example that when we move\nfrom a instructor led training type of\n\n228\n00:12:22.388 --> 00:12:27.007\nenvironment in this organization I\nworked in to a structured learning\n\n229\n00:12:27.007 --> 00:12:32.018\nmanagement service which provided\ne-learning such as streaming video and\n\n230\n00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:35.488\ncomputer based training and\nthose types of things.\n\n231\n00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:40.262\nWhen we moved to that type of service\nprovision for learning management,\n\n232\n00:12:40.262 --> 00:12:43.583\nwe did so\nin a way that changed the business impact.\n\n233\n00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:46.915\nThey we're used to going to classes,\nright?\n\n234\n00:12:46.915 --> 00:12:49.770\nInstead, they were going to a computer,\nright?\n\n235\n00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.600\nSo we definitely impacted the business\nin a positive way in that we're\n\n236\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.820\nsaving some money.\n\n237\n00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.550\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\nAnd like you'd mentioned it could be,\n\n238\n00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.690\nin that particular example you just gave,\nthere was an opportunity.\n\n239\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.860\nThe people already had their computer.\n\n240\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.050\nYou said they were going\nto their computer.\n\n241\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.934\nYou say look, I see an opportunity and\nthese triggers can in fact be positive or\n\n242\n00:13:06.934 --> 00:13:08.193\ncould be negative.\n\n243\n00:13:08.193 --> 00:13:12.952\nYou could have realized the fact that hey\nmay be we've got some really bad feedback,\n\n244\n00:13:12.952 --> 00:13:15.835\npeople don't like driving\nacross the countries,\n\n245\n00:13:15.835 --> 00:13:18.936\nspending their expense to\nattend training in person.\n\n246\n00:13:18.936 --> 00:13:23.627\nSo just kind of looking at it from\ndifferent perspectives there keeping\n\n247\n00:13:23.627 --> 00:13:24.570\nan open mind.\n\n248\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.310\n&gt;&gt; Great points and\n\n249\n00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:30.600\nto further that conversation, the positive\nimpact was saving money, travel.\n\n250\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.370\nSaving money in instructor fees.\n\n251\n00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.060\nAll sorts of things.\n\n252\n00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.681\nThere was some positive impact.\n\n253\n00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:37.937\nBut there was also an unintended impact,\n\n254\n00:13:37.937 --> 00:13:41.378\nwas all of a sudden there\nwas a high demand for\n\n255\n00:13:41.378 --> 00:13:47.164\nconverting PowerPoint presentation for\ninstance, into e-learning.\n\n256\n00:13:47.164 --> 00:13:50.459\nSo, if we had anticipated that more fully,\nwe could have change the impact state\n\n257\n00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:53.426\na little bit differently and\nmanaged the impact somewhat differently.\n\n258\n00:13:53.426 --> 00:13:58.614\nSo this can to sum that\nup we end up adapting or\n\n259\n00:13:58.614 --> 00:14:01.570\nexpanding our service.\n\n260\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.060\nWe didn't have a learning\nmanagement service,\n\n261\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.800\nthat says hey you can do this, and\nthe business said we're not gonna do that,\n\n262\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.280\nwe're not gonna convert our\nPowerPoints to e-learning.\n\n263\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.120\nCan you do that for us?\n\n264\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.220\nYes.\n\n265\n00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.988\nSo we expanded our service offerings to\nagain under the same rubric of learning\n\n266\n00:14:16.988 --> 00:14:22.118\nmanagement services, we expanded our\nofferings to include helping the business,\n\n267\n00:14:22.118 --> 00:14:24.230\nmanage that conversion, right?\n\n268\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.200\nSo understanding this import,\nthe business impact can change and it did,\n\n269\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.043\nthe demand went up we needed\nto respond to it, right?\n\n270\n00:14:31.043 --> 00:14:35.280\nSo business requirement, business impact\nlinking up your CMS and request for\n\n271\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.660\nchange as we saw earlier\nare also parts of those inputs.\n\n272\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.590\nAnd of course the outputs, what we've\ntalked about the catalog containing.\n\n273\n00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.640\nThe definition of the services\n,they update to that.\n\n274\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.120\nAnd making sure that the catalog\nis up to date and ready to go.\n\n275\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.510\n&gt;&gt; And Terry bring up another good point\nthere being able to adapt to those\n\n276\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:57.550\nparticular changes sometimes can be\nwhat really defines a business and\n\n277\n00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.590\neither makes or breaks a business.\n\n278\n00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.210\n&gt;&gt; Completely, absolutely.\n\n279\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:07.553\nAnd portfolio's gonna be a part\nof that strategic understanding.\n\n280\n00:15:07.553 --> 00:15:10.521\nThe catalog management's gonna do the\ntactics of making sure the data's correct\n\n281\n00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:11.220\nall along the way.\n\n282\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.100\nWe've talked about this too,\ninterfaces with other processes.\n\n283\n00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.740\nService asset configuration management,\nservice level management.\n\n284\n00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.990\nWe talked about this in various ways\nto be more explicit service asset and\n\n285\n00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.890\nconfiguration management is\nthe process that generate\n\n286\n00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.740\nthe CMS the configuration\nmanagement system.\n\n287\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.580\nService level management is the process\nthat's gonna come up with the agreements\n\n288\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:38.520\nfor what the service looks like, what the\nsuccess look like, operating hours etc?.\n\n289\n00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.897\nDemand management is going to anticipate\nhow much the service is intended to be\n\n290\n00:15:42.897 --> 00:15:45.763\nutilized through patterns\nof business activity?\n\n291\n00:15:45.763 --> 00:15:48.680\nA process we'll talk about in\ndetail a little bit later on.\n\n292\n00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.689\nBusiness relationship management\nobviously related to the business, right?\n\n293\n00:15:52.689 --> 00:15:57.013\nAnd of course, interactions with\nservice portfolio management is a self\n\n294\n00:15:57.013 --> 00:16:00.512\nfulfilling process and\nwe've talked about that earlier.\n\n295\n00:16:00.512 --> 00:16:05.220\nOkay, of course this is\nan information management challenge.\n\n296\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.770\nYou're going to have\nto design a data model\n\n297\n00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.080\nto make sure this is managed effectively.\n\n298\n00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.160\nAnd coming up with ways to manage\nthe catalog in a structured way\n\n299\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.580\nthrough change management is\ndefinitely a recommendation, right?\n\n300\n00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.040\nHow are you going to fit this solution?\n\n301\n00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.440\nI've seen some organizations use\na spreadsheet with pivot tables.\n\n302\n00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.571\nI've seen some organizations blow it up\ninto relational database with lots of\n\n303\n00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:31.454\ndifferent connections and trigger some\nways to query the information and\n\n304\n00:16:31.454 --> 00:16:33.788\nget good information as you need to, okay?\n\n305\n00:16:35.024 --> 00:16:38.780\nCritical success factors and KPIs.\n\n306\n00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.047\nIn the absence of a catalog,\nyou need to have a catalog, right?\n\n307\n00:16:42.047 --> 00:16:45.279\nIf you see the top list there,\nwhat is the critical success factor for\n\n308\n00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:47.560\nservice catalog management?\n\n309\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.768\nHaving a catalog and\nmaking sure it's accurate.\n\n310\n00:16:49.768 --> 00:16:51.272\nDo some measurements.\n\n311\n00:16:51.272 --> 00:16:54.014\nHow accurate is your service catalog?\n\n312\n00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:59.830\nHow many services are listed as a\npercentage of how many services you offer?\n\n313\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:00.437\nThat could be something, right?\n\n314\n00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:03.830\nBusiness awareness of\nservice is being provided.\n\n315\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.440\nIs the catalog used?\n\n316\n00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.050\nWho uses it?\n\n317\n00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.160\nHow many views does the catalog get a day?\n\n318\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.560\nThose types of things could be\nsome of the KPIs for that, right?\n\n319\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.640\nAnd it's IT aware of the supporting\nservices, those things on the catalog that\n\n320\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.040\nkind of invisible to the customers but\nare vital to the delivery of the service.\n\n321\n00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.370\nLike your server services,\nyour identity management services, etc.\n\n322\n00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.930\nSo, getting this data available to\nthe right people at the right time\n\n323\n00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.030\nis the critical success factor for\nthis process.\n\n324\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.129\nComing with ways to measure\nthe effectiveness of that data is what\n\n325\n00:17:35.129 --> 00:17:36.986\nthe KPIs are all about, okay?\n\n326\n00:17:36.986 --> 00:17:42.630\nAll right, of course there's challenges\nand risk associated with any process.\n\n327\n00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.720\nYou gotta have right information.\n\n328\n00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.950\nCan you get people to agree\nwhat is a service, right?\n\n329\n00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.600\nConnecting your data to\nunderlying CMS data or\n\n330\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.120\nService Knowledge Management System data.\n\n331\n00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:00.170\nOf course, if you have inaccurate data,\ntrash in, trash out is gonna be\n\n332\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.495\nthe operating words of the day and\nthat's not a good place to be.\n\n333\n00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:07.825\nIf it's bad data, people can't trust it,\nthey'll stop using it, and\n\n334\n00:18:07.825 --> 00:18:09.055\nit just becomes a waste.\n\n335\n00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:09.755\n&gt;&gt; Invalid, yep.\n\n336\n00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:10.325\n&gt;&gt; Invalid.\n\n337\n00:18:10.325 --> 00:18:10.985\nIt's not worth the trouble.\n\n338\n00:18:10.985 --> 00:18:13.915\nAll right, so maintaining its\naccuracy is a big part of it.\n\n339\n00:18:15.465 --> 00:18:16.235\nOf course there are responsibilities.\n\n340\n00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:17.916\nYou have a process owner,\n\n341\n00:18:17.916 --> 00:18:22.870\nyou have a process manager making sure\nthat this is managed appropriately.\n\n342\n00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.825\nITL is very big on accountability.\n\n343\n00:18:26.825 --> 00:18:29.635\nSo, if you're taking a test and\n\n344\n00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:34.839\nyou're seeing that the scenario\nis playing out in such a way\n\n345\n00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:39.749\nthat says you currently don't\nhave a service catalog.\n\n346\n00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.320\nOne of the first things you\nneed to do is own a process for\n\n347\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.850\ndeveloping this catalog and\nto manage it on going, right?\n\n348\n00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:54.100\nA process owner is one of the first\nsteps in the maturity levels,\n\n349\n00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.770\nmaking sure you have someone own it,\nright?\n\n350\n00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:57.947\nSo again, exam takers.\n\n351\n00:18:57.947 --> 00:19:02.946\nIf the scenario place out in such a way\nwhere you need to improve service catalog\n\n352\n00:19:02.946 --> 00:19:06.595\nmanagement, the CIO is\nrecognized that it's missing.\n\n353\n00:19:06.595 --> 00:19:07.715\nWe gotta have it,\n\n354\n00:19:07.715 --> 00:19:12.586\nthen one of the first steps you have is\nthe identification of a process owner.\n\n355\n00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:16.682\nAnd of course process managers\nare managing the day-to-day execution of\n\n356\n00:19:16.682 --> 00:19:17.468\nthe process.\n\n357\n00:19:17.468 --> 00:19:24.731\nIn this case, let's just focus\non catalog management, okay?\n\n358\n00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:27.130\nAll right, that's it for\ncatalog management.\n\n359\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.680\nAs we've mentioned before,\nthere's good self study.\n\n360\n00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.129\nI encourage your self study here.\n\n361\n00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:32.690\nThere's exercises for you.\n\n362\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.871\nService catalog management is\nthe name of the module available for\n\n363\n00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:39.349\ndownload in the upper right\nhere called show files.\n\n364\n00:19:39.349 --> 00:19:40.335\nWith that learning,\n\n365\n00:19:40.335 --> 00:19:44.240\nyou can reinforce what we've learning\nabout service catalog management.\n\n366\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.580\nAnd of course,\nthat same zip file has information\n\n367\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.110\nabout the other modules\nwe've talked about as well.\n\n368\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.819\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Terry.\n\n369\n00:19:50.819 --> 00:19:53.670\nAnd we're not completely\nout of the woods yet.\n\n370\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.120\nWe do have additional management\ntechniques to look at.\n\n371\n00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.900\nI think what's up next?\nService Level Management.\n\n372\n00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.370\nSo, ladies and gentleman,\nstay tuned for that.\n\n373\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.480\nFor this show,\nwe will go ahead and sign out.\n\n374\n00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.190\nRemember I'm your host, Cherki Boos.\n\n375\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.170\n&gt;&gt; And I am Terry Decker.\n\n376\n00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.379\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n377\n00:20:06.379 --> 00:20:14.263\n[MUSIC]\n\n378\n00:20:14.263 --> 00:20:19.880\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:07.352\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:08.901\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:15.480\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL Service Offering\nand Agreement series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.630\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.680\nIn this episode, we'll really be\ntaking a look at our different\n\n8\n00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.860\nService Level Management techniques.\n\n9\n00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.710\nAnd with us today,\nback in studios we have Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.200\nThank you for joining us, Terry.\n\n11\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.480\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.010\nAs Cherokee said, we're moving on to a new\nprocess called Service Level Management.\n\n13\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.000\nWe've talked about service\nportfolio management,\n\n14\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.060\nwe talked about service\ncatalog management.\n\n15\n00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.010\nAnd now onto a topic very\nimportant to service offerings and\n\n16\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.330\nagreements, because Service Level\nManagement is on point for agreements.\n\n17\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.490\nAlong with a sister process\ncalled Supplier Management\n\n18\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.680\nwhich we'll take up a little bit later on.\n\n19\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.290\nSo Service Level Management,\nif you look here at the slide,\n\n20\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.590\nit says it's got a lot of\nverbs associated with it.\n\n21\n00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.210\nYou see negotiates, agrees, and documents.\n\n22\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.226\nAnd then later on in this definition\nyou see monitors and reports, or\n\n23\n00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:04.036\nreproduces reports, right?\n\n24\n00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:05.231\n&gt;&gt; So Terry,\nI was gonna ask you about that.\n\n25\n00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:09.439\nBecause from my background, when we\ntalk about Service Level Agreement,\n\n26\n00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.990\nit's a type of a contract.\n\n27\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.860\nAnd there are several\ndifferent types of contracts,\n\n28\n00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.940\ninformal, formal, legal,\na lot of different components there.\n\n29\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.060\nIs that what we're really\ngonna be seeing here?\n\n30\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I'm glad you mentioned\nthe word contracts in particular.\n\n31\n00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.140\nService Level Management and Service\nLevel Agreements are generic terms.\n\n32\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.288\nThe ITIL has specified, they've gotten\nvery specific in their definition\n\n33\n00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:36.961\nof process as well as\ndefinition of agreements.\n\n34\n00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:42.143\nIn fact, the word agreement is something\nassociated with something internal,\n\n35\n00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:47.630\nand contracts is something associated with\nparties that are external to each other,\n\n36\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.180\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Good to know.\n\n38\n00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.210\n&gt;&gt; So in the ITIL framework,\nthe language is important.\n\n39\n00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.390\nA contract is something external,\nan agreement is something internal,\n\n40\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.230\nvery important language.\n\n41\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.909\nWe picked that up in foundation.\nAnd\n\n42\n00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.449\nI think it's important that ITIL took the\ntrouble to be very specific in narrowing\n\n43\n00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:08.780\nthe definition of things because they\nwanna talk about it in meaningful ways.\n\n44\n00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.620\nI know in the industry, we talk about\nthese things in very open ways.\n\n45\n00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.890\nJust as an example, if you use the term\nSLA, someone could tell you what it means,\n\n46\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.180\nService Level Agreement.\n\n47\n00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.770\nBut that's what it means.\n\n48\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.650\nThat's fair.\n\n49\n00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.730\nBut I think we also use it in loose terms,\nsuch as we might ask the question,\n\n50\n00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.490\nwhat's the SLA for\nincident resolution time, right?\n\n51\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.400\nAnd the answer might be it's two hours.\n\n52\n00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.060\nSo you've communicated effectively,\ngenerally speaking.\n\n53\n00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.510\nYou've determined that incidents should\nbe resolved within two hours according\n\n54\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.690\nto an agreement somewhere, right?\n\n55\n00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.020\nThat's nice, but it's also loose\nbecause the way ITIL would use these\n\n56\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.270\nterms we'll just say, what is the service\nlevel target for incident resolution time?\n\n57\n00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.900\nThe answer would be two days, right?\n\n58\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.610\nThe agreement is the document\nthat it contains all the targets.\n\n59\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.340\n&gt;&gt; And consequences?\n\n60\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.037\n&gt;&gt; Potentially consequences.\n\n61\n00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:08.661\nCertainly if you're talking about,\nand then again,\n\n62\n00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:12.620\nthat's this pointing to another\nloose use of the term SLA.\n\n63\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.385\nSLA is an agreement between a service\nprovider and their customer.\n\n64\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.570\nIf the customer is external, there's\ngoing to be a contract in place, right?\n\n65\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.880\nThe targets for performance\nwould be part of that contract.\n\n66\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.280\nAn SLA is an agreement between\na service provider and\n\n67\n00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.260\ntheir internal customer,\nan agreement here.\n\n68\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.736\nAnd yet we have a contract\nwith an external customer, and\n\n69\n00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:42.240\ninside that would be the targets.\n\n70\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.115\nSo the language, the semantics,\nthey could get a little confusing.\n\n71\n00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:50.310\nI want you to keep a tight\nconstruction of these words, though.\n\n72\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.510\nThat's gonna serve you better on the exam,\nright?\n\n73\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.830\nSo as again, you look at these,\nSLM as a process is\n\n74\n00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.360\ninvolved early in the negotiation and\nagreement and documentation of things.\n\n75\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.591\nThey're also involved after\nthe service's life to ensure\n\n76\n00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:11.986\nthat the actual targets are being met,\nright?\n\n77\n00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:16.577\nSo if you get this right, if you go to\nfull screen here, if you get this right,\n\n78\n00:04:16.577 --> 00:04:17.860\nthen that's great.\n\n79\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.260\nYou'll know that your services\nare delivered to business requirements.\n\n80\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.708\nOf course, if you get it wrong,\nthen, oops, we're not, right,\n\n81\n00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:28.430\nwe're not meeting those requirements.\n\n82\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.600\nI want you to know that these\nare measurable targets, right?\n\n83\n00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.490\nIt's not we will be fast.\n\n84\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.770\nIt defines what fast is.\n\n85\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.490\nWe will resolve within two hours or\nwe will respond within two minutes, right?\n\n86\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.950\nIt's not enough to say we will be fast.\n\n87\n00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.420\n&gt;&gt; Something general or generic.\n\n88\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's very specific and\nmeasurable.\n\n89\n00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.510\nIt's what Service Level Management\nis about.\n\n90\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.240\nIf you say you're gonna be available,\nwhat does availability mean, right?\n\n91\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.662\nAre you available 99% of the time,\n98% of the time, etc.?\n\n92\n00:04:58.662 --> 00:05:00.679\n&gt;&gt; Five Nines, like in IT?\n\n93\n00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:03.190\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's what we're talking about.\n\n94\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.880\nSo you're going to look for specific\nmeasurable targets, right, to get agreed.\n\n95\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.700\nSo it's not subjective anymore.\n\n96\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.110\nIf the user says,\n\n97\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.550\nthat application is really slow, you've\nalready defined what slow is, right?\n\n98\n00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.080\nAnd you're trying to avoid that.\n\n99\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.530\nYou're not going to be responding\nto subjective opinions,\n\n100\n00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.560\nyou're gonna be looking\nat objective targets.\n\n101\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.840\nThat's the goal of\nService Level Management.\n\n102\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.080\nIt's clear, it's transparent,\nit's agreed and negotiated both sides.\n\n103\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.620\nThe customer and the service provider\nknow what they're marching toward.\n\n104\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.920\nThat's the goal of\nService Level Management, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.720\nSo as you can see, the purpose,\nto ensure that all current and\n\n106\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.770\nplanned IT services are delivered\nto achievable targets\n\n107\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.690\nthrough a constant cycle of\nmeasurement and communications.\n\n108\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.470\nSo not only you're measuring and\nyou're keeping score, but\n\n109\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.230\nyou're communicating how you're doing.\n\n110\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.562\nSo if you've had 800\nincidents this month and\n\n111\n00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:07.106\nyou've resolved 790 of\nthem within two hours,\n\n112\n00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:10.817\nthen you're doing pretty good, right?\n\n113\n00:06:10.817 --> 00:06:13.310\nYou're definitely clipping at a good rate.\n\n114\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.960\nHowever, if you have 800 incidents and\nonly 400 have been\n\n115\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.400\nresolved within the target of two hours,\nyou're not doing so well.\n\n116\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.580\nSo being transparent about\nyour measurements and\n\n117\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.900\npresenting those measurements through\nmeaningful reports to your customers\n\n118\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.700\non a constant review cycle is going\nto help you get better, right?\n\n119\n00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.790\nSo the way you reach those goals of\nconstant cycle of measurement and\n\n120\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.000\ncommunications and to make sure all\nservices are delivered according to agreed\n\n121\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.670\ntargets is you're going to make sure\nyou've worked with the business through\n\n122\n00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.720\nBusiness Relationship Management to make\nsure you have communication lines open.\n\n123\n00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.650\nYou know what slow looks like,\nyou know and defined it, right?\n\n124\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.200\nSo you got communication channels open.\n\n125\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.225\nBRM can help there.\n\n126\n00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:58.080\nYou've worked with the service owner, so\n\n127\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.160\nyou understand the qualitative\nnature of the services as well.\n\n128\n00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.320\nAnd you've done the dirty work.\n\n129\n00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.820\nYou've gone through the definitions.\n\n130\n00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.580\nYou've got them documented.\n\n131\n00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.430\nYou have them agreed, right?\n\n132\n00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.103\nSo you've agreed to these things, right?\n\n133\n00:07:11.103 --> 00:07:13.975\nSo everyone knows what success looks like.\n\n134\n00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:17.730\nYou're not just guessing later on, right?\n\n135\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.952\nIn the absence of measurable targets,\nin the absence of defining targets,\n\n136\n00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:25.730\nyou'r edealing with subjective opinion and\nhearsay.\n\n137\n00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.650\nIt's like rumors.\n\n138\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.390\nPutting a disparaging spin on that,\nwithout metrics,\n\n139\n00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.530\nthe customer is just whining, right?\n\n140\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.320\nThat's kinda blaming the customer for\nbeing dissatisfied,\n\n141\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.589\nwhich is not a good ITIL principle at all.\n\n142\n00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:41.325\n[LAUGH] Don't blame the customer for\nbeing dissatisfied.\n\n143\n00:07:41.325 --> 00:07:42.931\n[LAUGH] You didn't hear that from me.\n\n144\n00:07:42.931 --> 00:07:47.347\nAll right, so what is SLM doing?\n\n145\n00:07:47.347 --> 00:07:50.942\nIt's providing a contact point\nbetween the business and IT, right?\n\n146\n00:07:50.942 --> 00:07:53.288\nBRM, Business Relationship Management, and\n\n147\n00:07:53.288 --> 00:07:55.700\nService Level Management\nare closely related.\n\n148\n00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.978\nThey're not necessarily the same.\n\n149\n00:07:56.978 --> 00:07:58.280\nThey're different processes, for one.\n\n150\n00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.536\nNow you might put them in the same person,\nbut not necessarily,\n\n151\n00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:03.839\nthey could definitely be different people.\n\n152\n00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:07.046\nBut BRM, Business Relationship Management,\n\n153\n00:08:07.046 --> 00:08:10.280\nis gonna be out there\ndoing the glad-handing.\n\n154\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.110\nThey're kinda marketing sales,\nalmost, type of interface and\n\n155\n00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.780\nSLM is just the facts, ma'am, right.\n\n156\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.040\nHere are the enforceable agreements\nthat we can deal with, right?\n\n157\n00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.755\nSo BRM subjective nature of the service.\n\n158\n00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.981\nSLM objective nature of the service,\nright?\n\n159\n00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:36.555\nSo, SLM is also good winner facing\nwith the potential for improvements.\n\n160\n00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:41.315\nCertainly, SLM is gonna be there to\nsee that only 50% of our ticket were\n\n161\n00:08:41.315 --> 00:08:46.705\nbeing resolved within SLA targets within\nthe targeted a great time frames.\n\n162\n00:08:46.705 --> 00:08:48.478\nOur services is not available 99.9.\n\n163\n00:08:48.478 --> 00:08:53.183\nIt's only available 98% at the time or\nmissing our availability targets.\n\n164\n00:08:53.183 --> 00:08:56.000\nWe're missing our response time targets,\n\n165\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.100\nwe have an idea,\nwe need to improve, right?\n\n166\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.494\nSo the interaction between service-level\nmanagement and CSI is fairly liquid,\n\n167\n00:09:03.494 --> 00:09:07.985\nright, because you're going to identify in\nmeasured ways where you should improve,\n\n168\n00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:09.410\nright?\n\n169\n00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:14.256\nSo what SLM does not do, you'll see\nin the lower portions of this slide,\n\n170\n00:09:14.256 --> 00:09:18.547\nwhat service-level management\ndoes not do is worry about those\n\n171\n00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:21.656\nsubjective nature of service value, right?\n\n172\n00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:24.810\nIt's not intuitive.\n\n173\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.030\nWe don't like the color, right?\n\n174\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.140\nIt doesn't suit our purposes for\nutility, right?\n\n175\n00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.060\nSo business relationship management is\ngonna be more involved on the utility side\n\n176\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.590\nof things,\nnot on the warranty side of things.\n\n177\n00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.045\nRemember those two words,\nwarranty and utility?\n\n178\n00:09:41.045 --> 00:09:45.020\nService-level management is gonna be\ninvolved a lot more on the warranty side,\n\n179\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.810\nBRM's gonna be involved a lot\nmore on the utility side.\n\n180\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.060\nIt's kind of a difference\nbetween subjectivity and\n\n181\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.600\nobjectivity, really where that counts,\nright?\n\n182\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.770\nAlso out of scope for SLM, you see the\nlast bullet there, is supplier agreements,\n\n183\n00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.430\nthese external agreements\nwith different suppliers.\n\n184\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.100\nSupplier management is the process that\ntakes that on and meaningfully so,\n\n185\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.060\nsupplier management is gonna be\nmanaging contracts in a nice way.\n\n186\n00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.050\nNow, it would be silly for\nservice level managers and\n\n187\n00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.060\nsupplier managers not\nto be on the same page.\n\n188\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.010\nWhy is that?\n\n189\n00:10:18.258 --> 00:10:22.530\nYou got service-level agreements\nwith your internal customer and\n\n190\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.490\nyour supplier manager is going off and\nnegotiating contracts with other folks.\n\n191\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.500\n&gt;&gt; They're probably\nversed in a lot the same,\n\n192\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.110\nthey have a lot of that same background a\nlot of, they might even have some of that\n\n193\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.070\nlegal knowledge to help them\nin knowing those boundaries,\n\n194\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.160\nbeing familiar with those documents,\nthat would be my guess.\n\n195\n00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.270\n&gt;&gt; Good call.\n\n196\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.792\nThere's gonna be legal procedure you're\nfollowing through your contract, so\n\n197\n00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:45.063\nsuppliers is one reason why suppliers\nmanagement is separate, right?\n\n198\n00:10:45.063 --> 00:10:49.550\nThere could be a procurement process,\nthat's different within your own\n\n199\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:54.610\norganization and also, you're managing\ncompetitive legal arrangements too.\n\n200\n00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.650\nYou're gonna keep the suppliers and\ncompetitive tension almost.\n\n201\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.380\nSo you can keep the prices down.\n\n202\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.830\nYou're gonna try to negotiate value for\nmoney all the time, right?\n\n203\n00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:07.615\nAnother key reason why they're\ndifferent is that suppliers\n\n204\n00:11:07.615 --> 00:11:13.170\nare necessarily a legal arrangement,\nas Cherokee pointed out.\n\n205\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:18.010\nAnd to get them to perform,\nyou have to write it down very explicitly.\n\n206\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.350\nInternally, that's not quite as necessary.\n\n207\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:25.340\nYou have the right to fire and hire,\nand motivate for common goals, and\n\n208\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.660\nincentives for bonuses.\n\n209\n00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.300\nI mean there's all kinds of ways\nthat you motivate internal people\n\n210\n00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.110\nthat's different than motivating\na third-part supplier.\n\n211\n00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.270\nBut they need to also be in\ncoordination with each other.\n\n212\n00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.870\nIt would be silly for instance for\nservice-level management\n\n213\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.720\nto agree that all tickets will be\nresolved within 2 hours and then,\n\n214\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.750\nhave a supplier contract\nthat accepts 4 hours.\n\n215\n00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.670\nYour supplier that's helping you deliver\nthis service could be underperforming\n\n216\n00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.350\nall the time, because they're\noperating at a different clock.\n\n217\n00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.626\nSo, they can't operate in a vacuum,\nbut they are separate processes.\n\n218\n00:11:58.946 --> 00:12:01.300\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n219\n00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.540\nSo, what does it do?\n\n220\n00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:08.180\nHow does it help drive value\nin business terms, right?\n\n221\n00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.940\nIt comes up with a consistent\ninterface for all services, right?\n\n222\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:17.200\nIt is a way to communicate performance,\na feedback channel,\n\n223\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.675\nand it's also a way to\nbuild relationships.\n\n224\n00:12:20.675 --> 00:12:24.830\nService-level management can be a key\ncomponent a business relationship\n\n225\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.070\nmanagement because it forms a relationship\nwhere the rubber meets the road.\n\n226\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.850\nHow are we performing, right?\n\n227\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.021\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; I can see there would be a direct\n\n228\n00:12:33.021 --> 00:12:37.085\ncorrelation with maybe perhaps the morale\nof the employees with the way that\n\n229\n00:12:37.085 --> 00:12:39.285\nthis information is presented to them.\n\n230\n00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:40.990\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n231\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.890\nYou can motivate people,\nyou can validate good behavior, right?\n\n232\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.210\nSo, if you are meeting the SLA terms,\n\n233\n00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.850\nif you are meeting all the targets,\nyou have all green metrics as light,\n\n234\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.518\nbright and shiny, hey this service is\nsinging along, we are doing great.\n\n235\n00:12:53.518 --> 00:12:57.760\nIt's also a way to communicate with\ncustomers, hey we're doing great, right?\n\n236\n00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.830\nSo it's opportunity to celebrate and\nvalidate that you're doing good work.\n\n237\n00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.740\nIt's also an opportunity to celebrate and\n\n238\n00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.580\nvalidate that you want to be\ntransparent as a service provider.\n\n239\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.220\nYou are willing to be transparent\nabout when you are not quite meeting\n\n240\n00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.520\nexpectations and\nyou're here to improve, right?\n\n241\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.940\nSo it's definitely a way to say we're\nnot afraid to look at the data.\n\n242\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.780\nWe're not afraid to measure ourselves and\nbe held accountable to a given target and\n\n243\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.878\nin fact, we will report\nregularly how we are dealing.\n\n244\n00:13:23.878 --> 00:13:28.420\nVery important, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:34.056\nSo the basic concepts an SLA is service\nlevel agreement is an agreement\n\n246\n00:13:34.056 --> 00:13:39.129\nbetween the service provider and\ntheir IT customers, right?\n\n247\n00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:42.290\nAnd again, it defines the key targets.\n\n248\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.770\nSo again, tightening up the language here.\n\n249\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:50.950\nSo let's say I am the email service\nprovider, or service owner, I should say.\n\n250\n00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.240\nI'm the owner of a service called email.\n\n251\n00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.710\nI come up with an SLA with\nthe customers of email that says,\n\n252\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.439\nwe'll be available 24/7 with the exception\nof maintenance between 3:00 and\n\n253\n00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:04.370\n5:00 AM every Sunday, right?\n\n254\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.370\nWe will respond to any\nincidents within 5 minutes and\n\n255\n00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.090\nwe will resolve any\nincidents within 24 hours.\n\n256\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.030\nWe make an agreement with the customer.\n\n257\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.460\nHere's how we're going to perform.\n\n258\n00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.690\nI am the email service owner, I got an\narrangement, an agreement, I should say,\n\n259\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:25.590\nwith my customers to perform at this\nlevel,with very measurable targets.\n\n260\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.030\nI didn't turn to the people that\nhelped me deliver this service,\n\n261\n00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.910\nthe server team,\nthe identity management team.\n\n262\n00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.345\nI'll make sure that they,\nI have agreements with them,\n\n263\n00:14:36.345 --> 00:14:40.100\nan operational level agreement\nwith my sisters or my cousins\n\n264\n00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.620\nwithin the same IT organizations\nthat helped me deliver the service\n\n265\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.720\nto make sure that my agreements with them\nsupport my agreement with the customer.\n\n266\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.056\nSo if I have an agreement with the\ncustomer that I will not have any outages\n\n267\n00:14:54.421 --> 00:15:00.650\nOther than between 3:00 and\n5:00 AM on Sunday, every Sunday.\n\n268\n00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.697\nThen, I can have the server team patching\nit at 8:00 o'clock in the morning, right?\n\n269\n00:15:04.697 --> 00:15:08.254\nSo I have time with agreement with them to\nmake sure they're operating in a way that\n\n270\n00:15:08.254 --> 00:15:10.170\nallows me to support my customers.\n\n271\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:14.913\nNow, clearly these need to be done\nin a coordinated effort, right?\n\n272\n00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:18.362\nYou need to know what you're capable\nof getting from the server team,\n\n273\n00:15:18.362 --> 00:15:22.513\nthe database team, the network services\nteam, before you can make your agreements\n\n274\n00:15:22.513 --> 00:15:26.090\nwith the customers, so\nthey need to be coordinated, right?\n\n275\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.900\nBoth SLAs and OLAs are internal\nagreements, if you have a contract,\n\n276\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.390\nwe're talking something external, right?\n\n277\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:37.650\nAnd underpinning contracts or supporting\ncontracts are sometimes called or\n\n278\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.510\nsupplier contracts or\nthird party contracts.\n\n279\n00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.740\nWhat's always the case in\nITIL parlance language,\n\n280\n00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.700\nis contract is the word used for\nthese external arrangements.\n\n281\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.620\nThey still have targets inside them,\nservice level targets, right?\n\n282\n00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.308\nThey need to support the overarching\nOLAs and SLAs above them, right?\n\n283\n00:15:56.308 --> 00:15:59.873\nThey still need to be coordinated,\nIt's this SLM as a process\n\n284\n00:15:59.873 --> 00:16:05.190\nis not responsible for these are depending\ncontracts supplier management is.\n\n285\n00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.560\n&gt;&gt; So, are we gonna see any\nspecific terms such as MOUs and\n\n286\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.690\nSOWs within this particular exam?\n\n287\n00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:11.370\n&gt;&gt; No, we're not.\n\n288\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.050\nThank you for that.\n\n289\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.760\nAnd, I'm gonna have to ask\nyou what's the MOU and SOW?\n\n290\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.441\n&gt;&gt; Memorandum of understanding,\nthe Statement of Work.\n\n291\n00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:20.480\n&gt;&gt; SOW, yep, have heard of those.\n\n292\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.120\nNo, not in scope of ITIL, right.\n\n293\n00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.706\nCertainly those are legal levers in,\n\n294\n00:16:27.706 --> 00:16:33.140\na documents that set the landscape\nof when we're expecting what.\n\n295\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.040\nBut no, those aren't in play at all,\nfor ITIL.\n\n296\n00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.019\n&gt;&gt; Good to know.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, good call, good question.\n\n297\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.953\n&gt;&gt; Memorandum of Understanding,\nokay, they do.\n\n298\n00:16:41.953 --> 00:16:42.580\n&gt;&gt; MOU.\n\n299\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.192\n&gt;&gt; MOU, okay.\n\n300\n00:16:44.192 --> 00:16:49.114\nPolicies, as with any process,\nhaving the backing of\n\n301\n00:16:49.114 --> 00:16:54.120\npolicies as part of your\ngovernance is important.\n\n302\n00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.460\nSo, it's one thing to have a process\ncalled service level management,\n\n303\n00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.190\nit's quite another to have a policy,\n\n304\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:04.970\nno service will be launched without\na corresponding SLA and OLA, right?\n\n305\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.760\nThat's a little bit different,\n\n306\n00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.410\nyou have a policy that backs up\nthe execution of this process.\n\n307\n00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.070\nCollectively, that's simply\ncalled governance, right?\n\n308\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:17.470\nYou have appropriate behaviors\ndriven by policies and\n\n309\n00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.230\nprocess, show you what it is, right?\n\n310\n00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:25.242\nSo, your policies can describe, yes,\nthere would be these, SLA's and OLA's,\n\n311\n00:17:25.242 --> 00:17:29.695\nthey will have this minimum set of\nrequirements defined in them, right?\n\n312\n00:17:29.695 --> 00:17:33.334\nAnd there would be ample coordination\nbetween supplier management and\n\n313\n00:17:33.334 --> 00:17:38.700\nservice level management to make sure that\neverything is coordinated appropriately.\n\n314\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.128\nPolicies can drive those kinda behaviors,\nokay?\n\n315\n00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:45.500\nAgain, we've talked about contracts and\nagreements,\n\n316\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.777\nthose are separate supplier\nmanagement deals with those.\n\n317\n00:17:47.777 --> 00:17:49.525\nContracts are external,\n\n318\n00:17:49.525 --> 00:17:53.820\nagreements are internal as we've\ntalked about before, okay.\n\n319\n00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.643\nAnd in any case, service level targets\ncan be included in any kind of agreement.\n\n320\n00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:59.432\nThat's the language of ITIL.\n\n321\n00:17:59.432 --> 00:18:04.950\nI think we throw the term SLA around\nto mean all these things, all the time.\n\n322\n00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.890\nITIL tightens up the language\nto distinguish between an SLA,\n\n323\n00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.710\nservice level agreement, an operational\nlevel agreement, and a contract.\n\n324\n00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.040\nWhat can be thrown around, or\n\n325\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.830\nthrown into each of those three,\nare things called service level targets.\n\n326\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.736\nThat's the language that's\ntightened up by ITIL.\n\n327\n00:18:19.736 --> 00:18:23.800\nSo, be on look out for\nthat as you read your test questions.\n\n328\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.960\nAs you get back to the office and\n\n329\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.182\nyou are considering using this terms,\nyou can easily talk passed each other.\n\n330\n00:18:29.182 --> 00:18:32.990\nIf you're in mind thinking ITIL\nservice level agreement, and\n\n331\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.190\nyour counterpart is in contract land,\nthen you could be talking past each other.\n\n332\n00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:42.970\nSo, just be aware that this language can\nbe loosely used as well as tightly used.\n\n333\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.512\nCertainly, ITIL exam takers,\nexpect the tightness.\n\n334\n00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:50.420\nAll right, now [LAUGH] I get a laugh.\n\n335\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.380\n&gt;&gt; What is this, Terry?\n\n336\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.186\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, what is this?\n\n337\n00:18:53.186 --> 00:18:56.355\nMemorize this take the exam,\nI'll see you next week\n\n338\n00:18:56.355 --> 00:18:57.711\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n339\n00:18:57.711 --> 00:19:02.742\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Its a first of all,\nit is really good maybe its\n\n340\n00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:07.970\na wall chart exploded up\nto be a size of a you know?\n\n341\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:08.640\n&gt;&gt; A big poster there.\n\n342\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.380\n&gt;&gt; A big poster, so it's not really, so\ndon't worry about the details of this,\n\n343\n00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.240\nI'm not gonna be deliver this at all,\nI just wanna explain what it is.\n\n344\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.950\nFor those of you that perhaps\npurchased the course packing and\n\n345\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.130\nhave a good look, or\nif you have the ITIL books themselves,\n\n346\n00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.060\nthis graphic is in there\nin a legible format.\n\n347\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.270\nBut basically, it's a graphical review\nof everything we just talked about,\n\n348\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:32.870\nthe points of inputs from the business,\nhow they become service level targets?\n\n349\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.580\nHow those targets are put into SLAs?\n\n350\n00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.810\nHow SLAs interact with OLAs?\n\n351\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.955\nHow they interact with supplier contracts?\n\n352\n00:19:38.955 --> 00:19:39.997\nIt's a busy place, right?\n\n353\n00:19:39.997 --> 00:19:41.860\nAnd that truly what this is talking about.\n\n354\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.930\nThe cross negotiation, the reporting\nagainst them, it's interfaces with CSI,\n\n355\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.350\netc., all right.\n\n356\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.170\nSo, what is a trigger for\nservice level management?\n\n357\n00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.581\nIf you have a new service,\nthen you need to define some targets for\n\n358\n00:19:58.581 --> 00:19:59.513\nthe new service.\n\n359\n00:19:59.513 --> 00:20:01.369\nIf you have an existing service,\n\n360\n00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:04.900\nyou have a reason to engage\nservice level management.\n\n361\n00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.990\nIf, you need to adjust your targets or\ncome up with different targets.\n\n362\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:15.331\nIs it possible to go into a service\nreview meeting and have all your metrics,\n\n363\n00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:20.102\nyour targets all being met and\nstill have a dissatisfied customer?\n\n364\n00:20:20.102 --> 00:20:21.125\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n365\n00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:25.290\n&gt;&gt; And because that is so possible, then\nyou also need to be constantly reviewing.\n\n366\n00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.090\nAre we measuring the right things?\n\n367\n00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.730\nIf you have a lot of green metrics,\nall your metrics are nice and\n\n368\n00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.190\nshiny, and coming through wonderfully.\n\n369\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.680\nAnd you also regularly have\ndissatisfied customers,\n\n370\n00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.000\nthen maybe you're not\nmeasuring the right things.\n\n371\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.830\nRight, so working with business\nrelationship management,\n\n372\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.060\nworking with the service owner to discern,\n\n373\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.970\nwhat does success really look like\nin the eyes of this customer?\n\n374\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:52.069\nShould we be measuring that, I mean, if we\nhave a service, it's 99.999% available,\n\n375\n00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:55.898\nbut they hate it,\nthen we're missing something, right?\n\n376\n00:20:55.898 --> 00:21:00.904\nSo if you're going into those meetings\nregularly with red faces and green\n\n377\n00:21:00.904 --> 00:21:07.000\nmetrics, you probably need to adjust your\nmeasurement framework a little bit, right?\n\n378\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.290\nSo certainly, what could trigger service\nlevel management interaction would be\n\n379\n00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.470\nthe reports on those metrics, how good\nyou're doing, or how badly you're doing?\n\n380\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:20.644\nAlso, a change or\nan introduction of a new service, okay?\n\n381\n00:21:23.525 --> 00:21:25.100\nWhere do the inputs come from?\n\n382\n00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.039\nSome are to triggers, policies and\nstrategies, request for change,\n\n383\n00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.369\nCSI initiatives.\n\n384\n00:21:31.369 --> 00:21:34.478\nAny sorts of information from\nall kinds of processes because,\n\n385\n00:21:34.478 --> 00:21:38.067\nservice level management could\neffectively be measuring any process.\n\n386\n00:21:38.067 --> 00:21:42.512\nThen any process could be providing\nmeasurements to service level\n\n387\n00:21:42.512 --> 00:21:45.696\nmanagement that would be meaningful,\nright?\n\n388\n00:21:45.696 --> 00:21:50.062\nSo, it's not an exhaustive list there on\nthe left, just keep in mind that service\n\n389\n00:21:50.062 --> 00:21:53.758\nlevel management could get inputs\nfrom just about anywhere, okay?\n\n390\n00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.654\nOf course, the outputs of service level\nmanagement are the actual service reports,\n\n391\n00:21:59.654 --> 00:22:00.350\nright?\n\n392\n00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.964\nHow are we doing?\n\n393\n00:22:00.964 --> 00:22:03.230\nThe service improvement plans.\n\n394\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.120\nIf we're not doing so\n\n395\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.398\nwell, then follow that service report\nwith an idea for improvement, right?\n\n396\n00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.649\nService quality plans are another\nway to introduce quality controls.\n\n397\n00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.176\nComing up with documents for\nyour SLAs, OLAs, the outputs for\n\n398\n00:22:17.176 --> 00:22:20.650\nservice level management\nare the documents themselves, right?\n\n399\n00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.230\nReports on your OLAs and\nunderpinning contracts,\n\n400\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.180\nas well as any review\nminutes that you might have.\n\n401\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.888\nSo service level management\nis born in strategy but\n\n402\n00:22:32.888 --> 00:22:36.970\nit actually lives in an operations\non a day to day basis, right?\n\n403\n00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.320\nWe talked about these as well,\n\n404\n00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.810\ninterfaces with BRM, certainly working\nwith business relationship management.\n\n405\n00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:43.470\nMore importantly,\n\n406\n00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.360\nworking with the business to\nunderstand what's success look like.\n\n407\n00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.640\nSully Sullivan is gonna be there for that.\n\n408\n00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.865\nUpdating and\nhelp maintain the service catalog.\n\n409\n00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.770\nAny process could be involved.\n\n410\n00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.440\nIncident management, supplier management,\nthe warranty processes.\n\n411\n00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.730\nThere's a couple mentioned here.\n\n412\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.340\nCapacity and availability.\n\n413\n00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.790\nOf course, if you're also trying\nto meet financial targets,\n\n414\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.330\nthen interfacing with\nfinancial management for\n\n415\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:10.710\nIT services would be a key point of\ninterface for service level management.\n\n416\n00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.772\nIf you're projected 400\nincidents a month and\n\n417\n00:23:14.772 --> 00:23:17.100\nyou're ringing at it\n1,600 incidents a month,\n\n418\n00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.790\nyou're financial management's gonna say,\nhey, you're costing a lot over there.\n\n419\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.126\nWe hired five more service desk staff just\nto keep up with this one service because\n\n420\n00:23:26.126 --> 00:23:29.208\nit's running off the rails,\nthat sort of thing, okay?\n\n421\n00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:35.687\nOf course, coming up with more appropriate\nways to manage the information for\n\n422\n00:23:35.687 --> 00:23:40.450\nservice level management, where are you\ngonna store your service level agreement?\n\n423\n00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.257\nAre you gonna have a agreement portfolio?\n\n424\n00:23:42.257 --> 00:23:45.550\nWe talked about that earlier,\ncustomer agreement portfolio.\n\n425\n00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.732\nService level management needs\nto keep up with this agreements,\n\n426\n00:23:47.732 --> 00:23:48.571\nwhere are they doing it?\n\n427\n00:23:48.571 --> 00:23:49.721\nHow are they doing it?\n\n428\n00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:52.697\nThat's one of the challenges of\ninformation management, right,\n\n429\n00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:54.585\nmaking sure they are there and reporting.\n\n430\n00:23:54.585 --> 00:23:58.585\nRight, so you got the agreement side of\nSLM, you also got the reporting side,\n\n431\n00:23:58.585 --> 00:24:00.600\nthe performance reporting.\n\n432\n00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.450\nHow are you doing that?\n\n433\n00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:05.054\nAre you doing that through automated\ndashboards that people gonna just go and\n\n434\n00:24:05.054 --> 00:24:06.114\nconsume as they wish?\n\n435\n00:24:06.114 --> 00:24:08.450\nAre you doing it manually in the back-end,\n\n436\n00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.547\ndeveloping some pretty\nspreadsheets with nice charts and\n\n437\n00:24:11.547 --> 00:24:15.190\nthen presenting them manually to\ncustomers on a monthly basis etc.\n\n438\n00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:20.510\nSo the challenge of information\nmanagement is not really the scope of\n\n439\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.850\nthis course, how to do this.\n\n440\n00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.870\nBut understanding the challenge is, right?\n\n441\n00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.820\nSo know that you need to have\nappropriate reporting, appropriate\n\n442\n00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.960\nlisting of your agreements is a key\naspect of information management, okay?\n\n443\n00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.010\nWhat are your current success factors and\nKPIs?\n\n444\n00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.360\nBasically what you're trying to do\nis make sure services have quality.\n\n445\n00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.320\nYour critical success factor for\n\n446\n00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.240\nservice level management is,\nare our services delivering as agreed?\n\n447\n00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.570\nSo, measurement's a big part of that.\n\n448\n00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:57.840\nYou'll see here, KPIs, a reduction\nin SLA targets being threatened,\n\n449\n00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.140\nan increase in customer satisfaction.\n\n450\n00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.680\nYou have fewer breaches of those targets.\n\n451\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.440\nThere's a cost factor here.\n\n452\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.660\nSo you've got quality, you've got cost.\n\n453\n00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.830\nAre we lowering the cost\nof delivering services?\n\n454\n00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.685\nAre we doing things faster or\nmore efficiently?\n\n455\n00:25:14.685 --> 00:25:17.250\nSo coming up with\nthe appropriate KPIs there.\n\n456\n00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:23.468\nAnd then do you have appropriate interface\nwith your customers through SLAs and\n\n457\n00:25:23.468 --> 00:25:28.020\nthrough reporting,\nanother aspect of CSFs and KPIs.\n\n458\n00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.910\nCritical success factors and\nkey performance indicators, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.060\nThese, by the way, form a great basis for\nreview of any given service.\n\n460\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:41.180\nCritical to the exam, not so much.\n\n461\n00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.020\nCritical to your on-going operations,\nabsolutely.\n\n462\n00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.055\nMeasurement is key.\n\n463\n00:25:49.246 --> 00:25:52.440\nOf course, there's challenges and\nrisks involved in any process.\n\n464\n00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.070\nHaving an appropriate customer interface,\nchances are you're gonna use\n\n465\n00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:02.550\nthe service owner as a broker of\nthe relationship with the business,\n\n466\n00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:06.790\nunder the rubric of business\nrelationship management, right?\n\n467\n00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.370\nSo understanding who\nrepresents the business\n\n468\n00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.880\nis going to be one of\nthe challenges you face.\n\n469\n00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.110\nDo you get direct interface\nwith the business?\n\n470\n00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.710\nDo you trust the service owner?\n\n471\n00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.920\nHowever that is, you need to make\nsure you have a representation\n\n472\n00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.310\nof the business needs, right?\n\n473\n00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.780\nAnd you're avoiding this\nhead office mentality.\n\n474\n00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:29.960\nWhat that means is, you're not dictating\nto the customer what success looks like.\n\n475\n00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.470\nYou flip that script and\nyou say, customer,\n\n476\n00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.070\nwhat does successful looks like to you,\nright?\n\n477\n00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.760\nInstead the head office says,\nhere's what you're going to get.\n\n478\n00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.410\nWe're gonna give you availability,\ninstant resolution time.\n\n479\n00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.760\nThat's what we're doing, right?\n\n480\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.700\nChances are you're gonna back yourself\ninto a corner if the customers don't\n\n481\n00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.460\nreally care about that.\n\n482\n00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.800\nIf they care about others indicators, you\nneed to be looking at those indicators.\n\n483\n00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.430\nOf course the risk will also include\nyou don't have the right tool sets.\n\n484\n00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.620\nYou don't have the right governance.\n\n485\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.810\nYou don't have enough authority to\nsay we're going to implement this\n\n486\n00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.360\nimprovement or agreed to this target.\n\n487\n00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.332\n&gt;&gt; Is that the head office mentality?\n\n488\n00:27:07.332 --> 00:27:08.113\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n489\n00:27:08.113 --> 00:27:10.429\n&gt;&gt; I am not sure,\nI haven't heard that term before.\n\n490\n00:27:10.429 --> 00:27:12.687\n&gt;&gt; Head office just means top-down.\n\n491\n00:27:12.687 --> 00:27:15.880\nIT telling the customers what they need or\nwhat they want.\n\n492\n00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.071\nWe've decided here's what you get.\n\n493\n00:27:18.071 --> 00:27:19.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's really what it means.\n\n494\n00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.982\nIt is more of a British term\nthan it is an American term.\n\n495\n00:27:21.982 --> 00:27:23.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty that what it is.\n\n496\n00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.880\nBasically, it means you're\nnot just dictating.\n\n497\n00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.920\nYou're not telling the users or customers,\n\n498\n00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.470\nhere's what you should have\nas performance indicators.\n\n499\n00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:36.020\nYou're asking the customers\nwhat they need, right?\n\n500\n00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.710\nWhat does this look like to you customer?\n\n501\n00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.590\nNow, you can lead them to the water,\nthey should drink.\n\n502\n00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.020\nI mean availability is\nan important metric.\n\n503\n00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.810\nResponse time at the service\ndesk is an important metric.\n\n504\n00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.140\nAnd whatever that metric might be,\n\n505\n00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.880\nyou have to have the ability\nto actually capture that data.\n\n506\n00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.970\nSo there's gonna be some\nconstraints on what's possible.\n\n507\n00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:54.940\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n[LAUGH]\n\n508\n00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.530\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n509\n00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.587\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But the constraints shouldn't be driven\n\n510\n00:27:58.587 --> 00:27:59.191\nby you.\n\n511\n00:27:59.191 --> 00:28:02.491\nIt should be more driven by the customer,\nright?\n\n512\n00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:07.121\nThat's really what that's getting to,\nall right.\n\n513\n00:28:07.121 --> 00:28:11.574\nBy bypassing,\nby not having service management in place,\n\n514\n00:28:11.574 --> 00:28:13.800\nthat's one of the risks.\n\n515\n00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.720\nYou just avoid.\n\n516\n00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.100\nThere's a direct customer\ninteraction with IT and\n\n517\n00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.950\nyou don't consider measurement,\nthen everything becomes opinion.\n\n518\n00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.480\nEverything becomes a crisis.\n\n519\n00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:28.288\nIf a high ranking business user says it's\nslow, you start putting out that fire\n\n520\n00:28:28.288 --> 00:28:31.876\nwhen really if you actually measured it,\nyou'd find out,\n\n521\n00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:36.950\nthe reason why it was slow is because he\nwas using his phone from a Starbucks.\n\n522\n00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:40.110\nIt had nothing to do with\nthe normal performance of ours.\n\n523\n00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.090\nLet's consider the mobility piece of it,\nright?\n\n524\n00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.480\nAnd if we follow the SLM process,\nwe could have dug that out a little bit\n\n525\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.130\nmore deeply instead of\nresponding to a complaint.\n\n526\n00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.450\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes we even see that.\n\n527\n00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:56.570\nFor example, with an Internet Service\nProvider, maybe they've capped or\n\n528\n00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.470\nthrottled a particular bandwidth and\nsomeone may be calling\n\n529\n00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:03.010\nto let them know hey, it's slow,\nbut it may be intentional at times.\n\n530\n00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n531\n00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.640\nSo that's the kind of things you get.\n\n532\n00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.690\nAs we talked about in other processes,\ncoming up with a process owner for\n\n533\n00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:14.120\nservice level management and coming up\nwith a process manager for service level\n\n534\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.850\nmanagement are kinda foundational\nfundamental steps you take, right?\n\n535\n00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:23.080\nSo if you want to implement\nservice level management formally,\n\n536\n00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.560\nyour first steps are to name a service\nlevel management process owner.\n\n537\n00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.260\nGives someone accountability for and\n\n538\n00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.060\nempower them to define and\nmove these processes to maturity.\n\n539\n00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.870\n&gt;&gt; So\nby empowerment you also mean authority,\n\n540\n00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.430\nin a way that they can actually enforce\nwhat it is they're set out to do?\n\n541\n00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.760\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that service level management\nprocess owner is probably one of\n\n542\n00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.560\nthe first things they're gonna do,\nis saying, what authority do I have?\n\n543\n00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.890\nCan I have a policy that backs it up?\n\n544\n00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.084\nRemember, the governance fabric that\nwe talked about a little bit earlier.\n\n545\n00:29:49.084 --> 00:29:50.030\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n546\n00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.656\n&gt;&gt; So certainly first steps early on in\nthe definition of process is the name\n\n547\n00:29:53.656 --> 00:29:55.340\nan owner, accountable.\n\n548\n00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.460\nAnd of course you need someone\nto manage on a day to day basis,\n\n549\n00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.455\nso having a process manager is also key,\nright?\n\n550\n00:30:02.455 --> 00:30:05.395\nAnd that's it for\nservice level management.\n\n551\n00:30:05.395 --> 00:30:07.035\nAs with the other topics,\n\n552\n00:30:07.035 --> 00:30:10.175\nthere are opportunities to\nlearn in Directed Self Study.\n\n553\n00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:13.215\nWe have two, one called a SLM 1,\nanother called a SLM 2.\n\n554\n00:30:13.215 --> 00:30:18.045\nYou see the time frames for those,\nsome pretty lengthy task there.\n\n555\n00:30:18.045 --> 00:30:20.015\nThese are available for download.\n\n556\n00:30:20.015 --> 00:30:22.585\nPlease, I encourage you\nto check these out for\n\n557\n00:30:22.585 --> 00:30:24.920\nreinforcing this learning on\nservice level management.\n\n558\n00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.590\nThey're available up in the upper\nright here under Shell files.\n\n559\n00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.610\n&gt;&gt; All right,

management.\n\n8\n00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:25.480\nAnd with us today we have Mr. Terry Decker\nin house, thank you for joining us Terry.\n\n9\n00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.547\n&gt;&gt; Happy to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:30.034\nWe'll continue our exploration of\nthe processes associated with service\n\n11\n00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:31.580\nofferings and agreements.\n\n12\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.413\nWe've gone through portfolio managements,\n\n13\n00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:35.672\nservice catalog management\nservice level management.\n\n14\n00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:39.135\nAnd now we'll have a look\nat demand management.\n\n15\n00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:41.925\nThe objectives of demand\nmanagement are pretty clear.\n\n16\n00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:43.345\nAs the word demand suggests,\n\n17\n00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:47.475\nyou're trying to understand what\nthe demand of a service is going to be.\n\n18\n00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:50.637\nSo you're trying to be\npredictive of potential demand.\n\n19\n00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:55.715\nAnd you're also trying to respond after\na service is live to the actual demand.\n\n20\n00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:58.955\nAnd that could clue you in to\nperhaps you need more capacity or\n\n21\n00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.970\nmore capability to serve more customers,\netc.\n\n22\n00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.730\nSo demand management is\nborn in service strategy,\n\n23\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.310\ntrying to be predictive\nof what demand might be.\n\n24\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.410\nBut it's alive and well in operations\nas well to make sure that demand\n\n25\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.700\nis being sufficiently met, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.450\nSo as you might guess, it has a tight\ncorrelation with capacity planning.\n\n27\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.870\nUnderstanding demand is going to be\na feeder into capacity management.\n\n28\n00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.563\nSo the objectives of demand\nmanagement are to understand not just\n\n29\n00:01:29.563 --> 00:01:32.733\nthe demand from a holistic view, big view.\n\n30\n00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:36.276\n3,000 users or 5,000 users or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n31\n00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:40.496\nIt's also to understand their\npatterns of business activity.\n\n32\n00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:45.251\nPatterns of business activity\nrelates to when things are used.\n\n33\n00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:50.561\nFor instance, Amazon.com might get\nvery busy between November and\n\n34\n00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:54.200\nDecember dealing with Christmas holidays.\n\n35\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.644\nDepending on what service\nyou're providing,\n\n36\n00:01:56.644 --> 00:02:00.620\nmaybe there's patterns you can try to\nanticipate or try to discern, right?\n\n37\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.583\nMonth end reporting, financial reporting.\n\n38\n00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:05.053\n&gt;&gt; Just even on a daily level.\n\n39\n00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:09.412\nI mean if we think about users getting to\nwork, logging in, checking their email,\n\n40\n00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:13.103\nand having that lull around noon,\nlunchtime, whatever that may be?\n\n41\n00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:17.392\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nequating it here to ITPro.TV.\n\n42\n00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:20.978\nThe demand when all five studios\nare going with heavy lab involvement and\n\n43\n00:02:20.978 --> 00:02:21.989\nthat sort of thing.\n\n44\n00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.260\nMaybe certainly have to anticipate\nall five being up at one time.\n\n45\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.400\nWhat's that look like?\n\n46\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.520\nWhat's your ISP gonna be doing to\nhelp you with that flexible demand.\n\n47\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.660\nGive you kind of a crazy example\nof patterns of business activity.\n\n48\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.580\nI worked with the Commonwealth\nof Virginia, and\n\n49\n00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.043\nthey had a centralized IT function\nthat served elections, right?\n\n50\n00:02:43.043 --> 00:02:45.778\nSo if you could imagine\nelections as registrations.\n\n51\n00:02:45.778 --> 00:02:49.303\nGetting voter registrations load and\nstuff, but in elect Tuesday of\n\n52\n00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:53.390\nNovember every couple of years has\na particular pattern of business activity.\n\n53\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.354\nWhere lots of people coming and\nusing these electronic election systems.\n\n54\n00:02:57.354 --> 00:02:58.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n55\n00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.680\n&gt;&gt; So again patterns vision.\n\n56\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.390\nWhen are things happening not\njust numbers of users but\n\n57\n00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.298\nwhen and how are they utilizing it, right?\n\n58\n00:03:06.298 --> 00:03:10.320\nAnother tell tale example from my learning\nmanagement experience back in the day.\n\n59\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.240\nWe discovered that, I'll describe\na weakness in demand management.\n\n60\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.664\nBasically where we weren't quite fully\nfunctional in understanding these patterns\n\n61\n00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.190\nof business activity.\n\n62\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.010\nThe service was already live and as we\nlaunched service, everything was fine.\n\n63\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.130\nWe understood the numbers of users\nwe have when Malaysia comes online.\n\n64\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.570\nWhat's that look like for our network?\n\n65\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.750\nWhat happens when by the time it gets\nto Poland and the United Kingdom,\n\n66\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.240\nwhat's it look like in terms\nof network utilization?\n\n67\n00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.460\nWe kinda have a sense for that,\nwe did predictive measures etc.\n\n68\n00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.423\nAnd we had sense for\nhow to plan capacity for\n\n69\n00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:48.207\ngeography through our demand management,\nbut we found surprises.\n\n70\n00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:51.535\nAgain, we know now that it was\na demand management issue, but\n\n71\n00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:55.300\nwe were troubleshooting\nan issue every other Friday.\n\n72\n00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.270\nEvery other Friday,\nour performance just kept is falling over.\n\n73\n00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.100\nWe weren't sure why.\n\n74\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.408\nWe couldn't figure out,\nand so we did a few steps,\n\n75\n00:04:03.408 --> 00:04:08.245\na few alliterations of analysis and\neventually we found what was going on.\n\n76\n00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:11.218\n&gt;&gt; It was pay day and\neveryone was taking the afternoon off.\n\n77\n00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:11.767\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n78\n00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:14.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For our learning management system,\n\n79\n00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:16.110\nwhat was happening is every other Friday,\n\n80\n00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.760\nthe sales team would\ncome in from the field.\n\n81\n00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.980\nAnd when they cam in from the field,\n\n82\n00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.000\nthey were heavy users of\nlearning management system.\n\n83\n00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.820\nThey were either updating their training\nrecords because they've been out on\n\n84\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.370\nthe training junket.\n\n85\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.251\nOr they had to take training before they\nwent back out to the field because that\n\n86\n00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:32.650\nwas also a very dynamic\ntraining environment.\n\n87\n00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.030\nSo the sales folks were regularly engaged,\nbut every two weeks.\n\n88\n00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.880\nThat corresponded to the weekly\nreporting that a manufacturing\n\n89\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.440\ntraining managers were doing.\n\n90\n00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.830\nThey were doing audit readiness reports.\n\n91\n00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.158\nWhich meant, they had to analyze\neveryone's training through reports\n\n92\n00:04:49.158 --> 00:04:51.184\nagainst our learning management service.\n\n93\n00:04:51.184 --> 00:04:53.985\nThey were doing these reports,\nvery intensive reports.\n\n94\n00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:56.250\nAnd they were doing it all over the globe,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.826\nSome 300 practitioner using heavy\nqueries against our system,\n\n96\n00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:05.157\nevery Friday, add that to every to weeks,\nevery other Friday,\n\n97\n00:05:05.157 --> 00:05:08.148\nthe sales team coming and\na hitting it hard.\n\n98\n00:05:08.148 --> 00:05:11.339\nNow again, we know the answer know but\nwe went moths must after month,\n\n99\n00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.250\nafter month trying to feel\nwhat going on on this Fridays?\n\n100\n00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.353\nIn fact, it took's us months to realize\nits was every other friday, right?\n\n101\n00:05:17.353 --> 00:05:21.290\nIt wasn't obvious that that's when it\nwas happening, then it dawned on us.\n\n102\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.410\nSo if we had an effective\ndemand management\n\n103\n00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.240\nprocess that methodically ask questions\nthat could discern from the business,\n\n104\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.440\nwhat are your patterns\nof business activity?\n\n105\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.150\nWe might have anticipated that particular\nheavy hitting day, every other Friday, and\n\n106\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.860\nperhaps change behaviors, right?\n\n107\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.227\nLet's have the manufacturing team do\nthe reporting on Monday instead of Friday,\n\n108\n00:05:42.227 --> 00:05:44.896\nthat would fix it,\nthat's what we did actually.\n\n109\n00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:45.840\nOr we could have built\n\n110\n00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.564\nthe appropriate capacity-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n111\n00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:49.683\n&gt;&gt; To handle that\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we see cloud computing.\n\n112\n00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:53.722\nI know we've mentioned it several times\nTerry, throughout this series, but\n\n113\n00:05:53.722 --> 00:05:55.610\nit's such a great example of that.\n\n114\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.449\nBecause you can use\nelastic provisioning on\n\n115\n00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:58.085\nan-\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n116\n00:05:58.085 --> 00:05:59.797\n&gt;&gt; As needed basis.\n\n117\n00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:02.099\n&gt;&gt; And of course it all comes\ndown to cost-benefit analysis.\n\n118\n00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.169\nHow good are you at\npredicting your demand?\n\n119\n00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.107\nAnd certainly, by the way,\n\n120\n00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:07.990\nthat's what the Commonwealth of Virginia\ndid with their election things.\n\n121\n00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.660\nThey had that elastic provisioning,\nthey didn't need to buy and\n\n122\n00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.190\nmaintain the infrastructure.\n\n123\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.110\nJust for election days, right?\n\n124\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.650\nThey could expand as they needed to.\n\n125\n00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.007\nSo this idea of patterns\nof business activity and\n\n126\n00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:23.232\nunderstanding user profiles is\nwhat demand management is about.\n\n127\n00:06:23.232 --> 00:06:26.774\nAnd by user profile is who is using it,\nwhat and how heavily, right?\n\n128\n00:06:26.774 --> 00:06:29.949\nWho's using what and how heavily are they\nusing it and when are they using it?\n\n129\n00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.000\nSo understanding the demand through\npatterns of business activity and\n\n130\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.250\nthrough user profiling, gives you a basis\nfor planning appropriate capacity, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.280\nThat's what demand management is about,\nintended to be predictive, right?\n\n132\n00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.430\nDemand management is also about\nascertaining, is there gonna be demand for\n\n133\n00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.100\nthis service,\nis it worth offering this service, right?\n\n134\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.729\nWe kinda miss the demand management\npiece a couple of times on our business\n\n135\n00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:58.613\nintelligence solution at one point.\n\n136\n00:06:58.613 --> 00:07:03.876\nAgain, just as an example where\nwe anticipated 3,000 users,\n\n137\n00:07:03.876 --> 00:07:05.456\nwe end up with 12.\n\n138\n00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:09.811\nSomething was broken at analysis, we\ndidn't quite get that done right, right?\n\n139\n00:07:09.811 --> 00:07:11.917\nSo we overbuilt, right?\n\n140\n00:07:11.917 --> 00:07:15.220\nWe spent more money that we needed to\nbased on the number of users we ended up\n\n141\n00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.040\nhaving, that's what demand\nmanagement was trying to do.\n\n142\n00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.823\nIs there gonna be sufficient demand\nto warrant this investment and if so,\n\n143\n00:07:22.823 --> 00:07:25.922\ndo we have sufficient capacity built for\nthis?\n\n144\n00:07:25.922 --> 00:07:30.841\nAnd then that's predictive, there's\nalso this operational element or demand\n\n145\n00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:36.160\nmanagement to ensure that the services\nare continuing to be rightly sized, right?\n\n146\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.998\nMaybe you can regain capacity because\ndemand is going down, etc, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:47.316\nSo the scope again, as result of the\nobjective the scope is gonna be related to\n\n148\n00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:50.648\nthese PBAs pattern business activity and\nusual profiles.\n\n149\n00:07:50.648 --> 00:07:53.560\nThat's what's in scope,\nbeing predictive and\n\n150\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.901\nbeing analytical to the actions once\nthe service becomes live, right?\n\n151\n00:08:00.073 --> 00:08:01.874\nAll right.\n\n152\n00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:06.180\nSo, how does it interrelate\nwith capacity management?\n\n153\n00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.862\nIt's somewhat a no-brainer,\n\n154\n00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:11.533\nunderstanding what demand is going to\nbe is going to give you a basis for\n\n155\n00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:14.368\nplanning the appropriate capacity-\n&gt;&gt; How could I fulfill that demand?\n\n156\n00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:16.245\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, how to fulfill it, right.\n\n157\n00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:20.535\nSo capacity management happens to be\na warranty process that's described in\n\n158\n00:08:20.535 --> 00:08:22.230\nservice design, right?\n\n159\n00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.150\nSo ITIL recognizes capacity\nmanagement as an important process.\n\n160\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.100\nWhat they have done though is they've\nadded this domain management process,\n\n161\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.290\nactually kinda later in the development\nof ITIL to say you know it stands alone.\n\n162\n00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:36.740\nIt's complicated enough,\nit has this predictive nature,\n\n163\n00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.110\nnot just the actual thing.\n\n164\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.548\nSo we need to get demand management\nit's own process, right?\n\n165\n00:08:40.548 --> 00:08:43.531\nSo demand management is about\nthe predictive nature and\n\n166\n00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:45.500\nunderstand what's anticipated and\n\n167\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.578\ncapacity management is about building\nit to those specifications, okay?\n\n168\n00:08:49.578 --> 00:08:52.965\nThey work hand in hand.\n\n169\n00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:56.220\nI've already kind of\ndescribed the business value.\n\n170\n00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.560\nI mentioned overbuilding,\nright, right-sizing.\n\n171\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.624\nGetting the right amount of cost and\ninvestment to meet that demand, right?\n\n172\n00:09:05.624 --> 00:09:10.332\nBeing able to predict demand\ngives you a basis in effectively\n\n173\n00:09:10.332 --> 00:09:13.170\ndoing a capacity management.\n\n174\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.040\nWithout the prediction,\nyou might overbuild or unfortunately,\n\n175\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.050\nalso you might underbuild, right?\n\n176\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.361\nSo you end up building services that\naren't fit for a purpose, or fit for\n\n177\n00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:26.193\nuse because they've lacked\nthe appropriate warranty, okay?\n\n178\n00:09:26.193 --> 00:09:28.554\nAll right.\n\n179\n00:09:28.554 --> 00:09:32.210\nSo, the basic concept here is\nthat you need this balance.\n\n180\n00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.420\nWhat is the right thing to spend on?\n\n181\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:39.000\nIf you have underserved demand,\nit's a risk, right?\n\n182\n00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.530\nIf you have too much capacity, you're\ngenerating cost without no real value.\n\n183\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.650\nFinding that magic balance,\ndeveloping a discipline or\n\n184\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.700\ndemand management that's closely linked\nwith capacity planning can help you\n\n185\n00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:56.810\nforestall the issues on both ends of this\nscale to find that right balance, okay?\n\n186\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.660\nSo it's all about Demand Modeling,\nunderstanding supply,\n\n187\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.410\nunderstanding demand.\n\n188\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.580\nYou can see from the graphic here that\nyou're trying to find that sweet spot of\n\n189\n00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.130\nthe price is going up,\nversus how much you are getting, right?\n\n190\n00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.590\nHow much demand you're gonna get.\n\n191\n00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.683\nFinding that sweet spot\nof balances would be.\n\n192\n00:10:15.683 --> 00:10:18.937\nThis is a nice pretty picture,\nit's a lot harder to design and\n\n193\n00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:20.385\nget this picture,right.\n\n194\n00:10:20.385 --> 00:10:25.580\nHonestly, it really is, but what is it\ngonna cost to get this rightly built.\n\n195\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.220\nI know a lot of times you just\ntake a really good guess.\n\n196\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.150\nI know IT organizations do that\na lot because it's hard to get in\n\n197\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.700\nfront of the business long enough to\nreally understand their total usage or\n\n198\n00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.130\nwhen they're gonna use it.\n\n199\n00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.210\nThat example earlier when I mentioned\nthe learning management service was\n\n200\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.150\nheavily utilized every other Friday.\n\n201\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.550\nGetting that data point would\nhave been like pulling teeth.\n\n202\n00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.640\nWe were trying to build the service.\n\n203\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.600\nWe were in front of\nthe customers asking them so\n\n204\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.300\nmany questions about utility and\nwe honestly, we were in front of them so\n\n205\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.130\nmuch they said go away,\nI got work to do here.\n\n206\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.360\nYou're having me build a service for\nyou, they kind of pushed us away.\n\n207\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.190\nA big challenge in understanding demand\nis getting the right kind of data.\n\n208\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.100\nCertainly patterns of\nbusiness activity and\n\n209\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.540\nuser profiles are wonderful to grab, but\n\n210\n00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.778\nI understand you're gonna face a challenge\nbeing in front of the business that long.\n\n211\n00:11:15.778 --> 00:11:17.916\nSo there's gonna be some good guesses and\n\n212\n00:11:17.916 --> 00:11:21.704\ncoming up with demand modeling is a way\nto kind of funnel these good guesses\n\n213\n00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:25.632\ninto an intelligent model is really\nwhat you're trying to get done, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:25.632 --> 00:11:28.009\nAll right.\n\n215\n00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:32.285\nThis little engine here is kind of funny.\n\n216\n00:11:32.285 --> 00:11:37.650\nIt sound like a self-fulfilling prophecy\nin a way, but I wanna add to this.\n\n217\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.920\nAs usage increases, demand increases.\n\n218\n00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.902\nThat's like saying the more you use\nthe red crayon, the redder it gets, right?\n\n219\n00:11:45.902 --> 00:11:47.014\nSo to speak.\n\n220\n00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:47.908\n&gt;&gt; You're not gonna be satisfied.\n\n221\n00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:51.150\nRight, but\nit's actually more of an engine.\n\n222\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n223\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.020\n&gt;&gt; It actually, exponential growth is\nwhat it is we're trying to talk about.\n\n224\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.480\nI'll give you an example,\nI'll use Amazon.com,\n\n225\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.620\nas me as a consumer of that service,\nI once looked at them as a book seller.\n\n226\n00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.740\nAnd that's what I did,\n\n227\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.420\nI bought a book because I want it\ndelivered at my door step, I didn't wanna\n\n228\n00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:13.358\ndrive into town or out to the suburbs\nto get a Barnes &amp; Noble book, right?\n\n229\n00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:16.210\nJust deliver it to my doorstep,\nAmazon's made it easy, click,\n\n230\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.020\nclick, click, it arrives, I like that.\n\n231\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.340\nBut again,\nI thought about it as a book seller and\n\n232\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.890\nthat was in the back of my mind,\nI need a book?\n\n233\n00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.660\nI'm gonna head to amazon.com,\nof course what is amazon.com right now?\n\n234\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.210\n&gt;&gt; It could be anything,\nit could be your grocer.\n\n235\n00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.490\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, they're amazing,\n\n236\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.030\nwhat they've ended up providing as\na potential products for me to consume.\n\n237\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.740\nThey're providing a place for\nme to get that done.\n\n238\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.720\nSo I'm now an Amazon Prime member\nbecause I used them enough to justify me\n\n239\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.390\npaying $99 a year for\nfree shipping, etc., like that.\n\n240\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.770\nSo I'm building up that\nloyalty thing that [CROSSTALK]\n\n241\n00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.299\n&gt;&gt; I knew I liked you, Terry.\n\n242\n00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:50.965\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n243\n00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:52.113\nOkay [LAUGH].\n\n244\n00:12:52.113 --> 00:12:55.630\nSo It's really an engine.\n\n245\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.810\nAs I used Amazon.com,\nI end up using it more.\n\n246\n00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.490\nThat's what I'm talking about this engine.\n\n247\n00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.300\nSo as use increase, demand increase.\n\n248\n00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.830\nAgain, it sounds like\na self-fulfilling prophecy, but\n\n249\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.330\nit really is more of\nan exponential type thing.\n\n250\n00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:15.112\nSo the dynamic of demand can be quite\ninteresting in that it expansively grows,\n\n251\n00:13:15.112 --> 00:13:15.727\nright?\n\n252\n00:13:15.727 --> 00:13:17.163\nAs you use the system.\n\n253\n00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:20.003\nI'll give you another example,\nnot so big as Amazon,\n\n254\n00:13:20.003 --> 00:13:22.830\nagain using learning management system.\n\n255\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:29.340\nWhen we first launched the service,\nit primarily was a system.\n\n256\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.780\nPeople logged in, they could find\ntraining, they could sign up for\n\n257\n00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.640\nthe training.\n\n258\n00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.740\nWe could do some cross billing if\nthere was charges associated with\n\n259\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.820\nany given learning they were taking.\n\n260\n00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.170\nWe allowed the facility for\n\n261\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.860\nyou if you took a training outside\nof learning management service.\n\n262\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.590\nYou could then add that training\nevent to your training records, so\n\n263\n00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.080\nyou had a place to keep\nyour training records.\n\n264\n00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.040\nSo it was finding training,\nit was training records.\n\n265\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.250\nIt was a lot, but\nit mostly focused on this system.\n\n266\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.970\nNow, as we launch this service,\nthe system was used.\n\n267\n00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.240\nAnd as people use the services said,\nI can do this.\n\n268\n00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.660\nI can convert a PowerPoint\npresentation to eLearning and\n\n269\n00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.570\nI can make that a learning event.\n\n270\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.330\nYes, you can.\n\n271\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.450\nSo, as they use the service,\nthey found additional uses for\n\n272\n00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.200\nthe service and it grew and grew and grew.\n\n273\n00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.960\nSo, it grew so quick, again, we could have\nbeen better at the demand side of this,\n\n274\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.140\nit grew so\nquickly that we have to stand up a team\n\n275\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.817\nof consultants to manage\nthe conversion of eLearning, right?\n\n276\n00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.285\nSo that's where a service,\n\n277\n00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:34.465\nusage increased demand because they saw\nthe ability, I say the customers saw\n\n278\n00:14:34.465 --> 00:14:38.025\nthe ability to now use this service\nin ways they had not anticipated.\n\n279\n00:14:38.025 --> 00:14:41.536\nThey thought that would just be a record\nrepository in a way to find training,\n\n280\n00:14:41.536 --> 00:14:44.736\nthey didn't know it was a way that\nthey could host their own training.\n\n281\n00:14:44.736 --> 00:14:49.271\nAnd they start using that service even\nmore, So understanding the dynamic of\n\n282\n00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:54.103\ndemand management as engine of expansive\ngrowth is an important feature, okay?\n\n283\n00:14:54.103 --> 00:14:57.090\nIt's important value capture as well.\n\n284\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:03.760\nAnticipate it, use it, and use it to your\nbenefit as you relate to your customers.\n\n285\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.991\nHere's what we can do for you, right?\n\n286\n00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:08.310\nAll right, here it is again.\n\n287\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.600\nMatching up this demand and capacity,\nyou need to understand what they're doing.\n\n288\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.380\nWe talked about these patterns\nof business activity.\n\n289\n00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.090\nWhat are they gonna do?\n\n290\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.630\nWe honestly didn't anticipate in that\nlearning management service scenario.\n\n291\n00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.470\nWe didn't anticipate just how\nmany people would say, hey,\n\n292\n00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.250\ncan you convert my PowerPoint for\nme, right.\n\n293\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.540\nWe didn't anticipate that demand.\n\n294\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.950\nWe had a system,\n\n295\n00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.560\nwe didn't think about this full pledge\nservice that they're gonna be knocking on\n\n296\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.000\nthe doors all day about doing those\nkind of conversion things for them.\n\n297\n00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.811\nPredicting that is a lot\nbetter than reacting to it and\n\n298\n00:15:37.811 --> 00:15:40.168\nthat's what demand\nmanagement is about okay?\n\n299\n00:15:43.335 --> 00:15:45.562\nSo that you could appropriately\ngear your service assets.\n\n300\n00:15:45.562 --> 00:15:48.860\nGearing, not really fancy here.\n\n301\n00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.807\nWe saw the engine earlier, right?\n\n302\n00:15:50.807 --> 00:15:53.294\nSo imagine that these have-\n&gt;&gt; Seeking with that mechanical theme.\n\n303\n00:15:53.294 --> 00:15:54.146\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n304\n00:15:54.146 --> 00:15:56.084\nGearing it appropriately.\n\n305\n00:15:56.084 --> 00:15:56.636\nRight?\n\n306\n00:15:56.636 --> 00:16:00.890\nMaking sure, again, had we done this\nproactively a demand management?\n\n307\n00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.503\nWe might have anticipated\nthe flood gates opening for\n\n308\n00:16:03.503 --> 00:16:06.560\nPowerPoint conversions that\nyou're learning, right?\n\n309\n00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.200\nHad we done the good research\nof demand management?\n\n310\n00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.710\nWe could have that team available,\nready to go.\n\n311\n00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.230\nInstead, we became reactive.\n\n312\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.390\nAt first, we actually pushed off.\n\n313\n00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.810\nNo, that's not what we do,\nwe don't do that.\n\n314\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.092\nIt's up to you to figure it out,\n\n315\n00:16:19.092 --> 00:16:21.590\nwhich is kind of the wrong\nanswer to a customer base.\n\n316\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.690\nYou figure it out is not\nreally a great answer.\n\n317\n00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.930\nA better answer would be,\nthat's a great idea,\n\n318\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.085\nlet's figure out how we can do that for\nyou.\n\n319\n00:16:29.085 --> 00:16:33.720\nBecause it doesn't make sense for\nthe manufacturing unit, the sales unit,\n\n320\n00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.710\nthe RND unit, to go figure out those\nthings on their own when you could do so\n\n321\n00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.180\nscalably and\ncentrally through a centralized service.\n\n322\n00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.910\nSo, we missed the value proposition\nbecause we didn't ask the right questions\n\n323\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.260\nabout demand effectively, right?\n\n324\n00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:53.070\nAs an example, of course demand\nmanagement is born in service strategy.\n\n325\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:58.253\nTrying to be predictive of what services\ncould be served at what levels of demand,\n\n326\n00:16:58.253 --> 00:16:58.788\nright?\n\n327\n00:16:58.788 --> 00:17:02.773\nIt's certainly going to be feeding\nservice design information, so\n\n328\n00:17:02.773 --> 00:17:05.247\nyou can build the appropriate capacity and\n\n329\n00:17:05.247 --> 00:17:09.865\nthat the performance will be built into\nthe service as it becomes live, right?\n\n330\n00:17:09.865 --> 00:17:13.912\nAs it relates to service transition,\ntesting and validating that these\n\n331\n00:17:13.912 --> 00:17:18.640\nservices are actually fit for use that\nthey do have the appropriate capacity.\n\n332\n00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.190\nSo, if you promised that\n3,000 users could log in,\n\n333\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.705\nand the logins would not\ntake anymore than seconds.\n\n334\n00:17:24.705 --> 00:17:29.490\nThen have some sort of performance test\nready in service transition to validate\n\n335\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.180\nthat capacity is actually being met.\n\n336\n00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.980\nAnd of course the service operations,\nthe ongoing monitoring.\n\n337\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.767\nDemand management needs to be involved\nin service operations to ensure that\n\n338\n00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.671\nthe current levels are appropriate.\n\n339\n00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:47.970\nAnd that if there is unmet demand\nthat you respond accordingly, right?\n\n340\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.720\nAnd of course, CSI can always be\ninvolved in any of these processes,\n\n341\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.430\nin any of these stages to make sure\nthat you're moving toward continual and\n\n342\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.340\ngradual improvement of all your services.\n\n343\n00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:06.410\nOkay, so, how could you get sources for\ndemand forecasting?\n\n344\n00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.360\nHow could you go about forecasting demand?\n\n345\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.360\nWell, we sort of talked about PBAs,\npatterns of business activity but\n\n346\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.490\nwhat is the business up to?\n\n347\n00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:20.590\nAre they going to convert 300\nPowerPoint presentations to e-learning.\n\n348\n00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.400\nI know when we first it's kinda funny way.\n\n349\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.200\nWe reacted in.\n\n350\n00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.100\nWe didn't plan well.\n\n351\n00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.660\nI admit,\nwe did not have formal demand management.\n\n352\n00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.160\nWe did not ask the right questions.\n\n353\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.380\nBut when we saw the potential for\na centralized service to do PowerPoint\n\n354\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.040\nconversions to e-learning, we didn't\nask what was our cost model gonna be?\n\n355\n00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.730\nAnd we said, you know what, we'll just\ndo it for you as part of the service.\n\n356\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.750\nSo, without any cost basis, the customer\nsaid okay, here's my 300 PowerPoints.\n\n357\n00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.845\nHere's my 350 PowerPoints.\n\n358\n00:18:46.845 --> 00:18:48.142\nHere's my 250 PowerPoints.\n\n359\n00:18:48.142 --> 00:18:51.020\nThey just flooded us with PowerPoints.\n\n360\n00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.240\nMy gosh, now we have a thousand\nPowerPoint presentations and\n\n361\n00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.021\nthey had to do no analysis of\nwhat was valid or invalid.\n\n362\n00:18:57.021 --> 00:18:59.870\n&gt;&gt; While you brought this opportunity and\n\n363\n00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:04.190\nif it was aligning with your business\nplan, then you just ran with it.\n\n364\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.350\n&gt;&gt; We did, we just ran.\n\n365\n00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.195\nAnd that's just organically\nhow it happened.\n\n366\n00:19:07.195 --> 00:19:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But honestly, it didn't work.\n\n367\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.270\nIn fact, what they did without any skin in\nthe game, without any cost in the game,\n\n368\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.080\nthey just sent us all 350\nPowerPoints that they found.\n\n369\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.604\nIf we put a cost, $100 per conversion and\n\n370\n00:19:20.604 --> 00:19:24.930\nthey send us 350,\nthey got skin in the game.\n\n371\n00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.487\nDoing the Math there,\nI think that's $25,000, right?\n\n372\n00:19:27.487 --> 00:19:32.345\nSo, that became real to the business and\nthey looked us okay, you're right.\n\n373\n00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:35.790\nIt's not 350 because we're never gonna\ntrain this again, this one's okay.\n\n374\n00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.469\nSo, they have some skin on the game,\n\n375\n00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:40.841\nthey looked at their pattern to\nbusiness activity, the real demands is.\n\n376\n00:19:40.841 --> 00:19:42.310\nYou know what, we're gonna send you 80.\n\n377\n00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:46.190\nAnd this other group said we only have\nlike 30 that are actually balance.\n\n378\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.760\nSo, instead of setting it as a thousand,\nwe end up with a workable amount, right?\n\n379\n00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.730\nAnd then of course,\nthat demand tapers off.\n\n380\n00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.652\nThat was a one-time good deal.\n\n381\n00:19:55.652 --> 00:20:01.050\nLet's get all of these PowerPoints\nconverted because we need this now.\n\n382\n00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:04.910\nThese are active and\nthen after that, it became piecework.\n\n383\n00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.580\nA new course was,\n&gt;&gt; As those courses were\n\n384\n00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.490\ncoming to fruition.\n\n385\n00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:08.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n386\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040\nAs those courses were coming.\n\n387\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.659\nSo, it started off with high volume.\n\n388\n00:20:10.659 --> 00:20:12.730\nIt ended up becoming piecework.\n\n389\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.140\nSo, again, that's the nature of this.\n\n390\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.020\nYou see how you have to be involved\nwith the business in this?\n\n391\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.660\nThat's not an easy thing\nto do necessarily, right?\n\n392\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.190\nUnderstanding your forecast, understanding\nthat business, those business needs,\n\n393\n00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.890\nthis is what it's about.\n\n394\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.430\nWhat they're up to, right?\n\n395\n00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.090\nSo again, one of the business\nunits we serve was sales.\n\n396\n00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.790\nSo, understanding the marketing plans and\nforecasts for the sales team's progress.\n\n397\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.967\nProduction plans,\nwe talked to the manufacturing group.\n\n398\n00:20:37.967 --> 00:20:43.070\nWhen do you go through\nhigh volume of training?\n\n399\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.560\nThose sorts of things.\n\n400\n00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.660\nThis gives you a basis for getting\nthe right sources of forecasting in play.\n\n401\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.160\n&gt;&gt; Now, Terry, just from my experience and\n\n402\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.860\nsome work in projects that I've\nbeen put on and in charge of.\n\n403\n00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.960\nReally I guess kind of just\nhitting the pavement and\n\n404\n00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.421\nhaving those discussions with people.\n\n405\n00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:04.482\nPeople who are not necessarily\nsitting in the boardroom,\n\n406\n00:21:04.482 --> 00:21:07.165\nbut the people who are getting\ntheir hands dirty and\n\n407\n00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:11.880\ninvolved in a day-to-day operations, can\nreally provide valuable insights as well.\n\n408\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.360\nBecause it might be something\nthat your researchers,\n\n409\n00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.598\nyour marketing team has overlooked.\n\n410\n00:21:16.598 --> 00:21:21.470\nBut just to your average Joe is\nable to provide you issues or\n\n411\n00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.210\nsome kind of insight that it was\njust from a different perspective.\n\n412\n00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:28.290\n&gt;&gt; I totally understand that, and\nhave to reinforce that a little bit.\n\n413\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:33.360\nIt's necessary to have a macro\nlevel view of where we're going,\n\n414\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.370\nthe big picture view.\n\n415\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.980\nThe sales people saying we're\ngoing to really change the world\n\n416\n00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.700\nwith this new service.\n\n417\n00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.180\nYou must have that big picture\nview at a strategic level.\n\n418\n00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.110\nBut the devil really is in the details.\n\n419\n00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.580\nSo, having the micro view of what's really\nhappening when you introduce this service\n\n420\n00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.870\nor anticipating what's gonna happen when\nyou introduce the service is critical.\n\n421\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.440\nAnd demand management is\na structured approach to trying to\n\n422\n00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.220\nanswer those key detailed questions,\nright?\n\n423\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.970\nAll right, again,\nwe've talked about customer assets.\n\n424\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.930\nHow are the customer's gonna\nbe using this service?\n\n425\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.060\nWhat people are involved?\n\n426\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.780\nWhat processes?\n\n427\n00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.970\nWhat business processes?\n\n428\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.925\nAre there ups and\ndowns in the generation of this, etc?\n\n429\n00:22:12.925 --> 00:22:18.684\nIt depends on the service obviously where\nthese ups and downs might happen per user\n\n430\n00:22:18.684 --> 00:22:25.270\nprofile which we'll talk about shortly\nwhen talking about these user profiles.\n\n431\n00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.570\nThere is one thing to\nunderstand financial analysis.\n\n432\n00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.888\nThe financial analysts\nare doing it every day.\n\n433\n00:22:30.888 --> 00:22:34.282\nThey are analyzing accounts payable and\naccounts receivable and\n\n434\n00:22:34.282 --> 00:22:37.125\nthey're keeping score on\nhow those things are going.\n\n435\n00:22:37.125 --> 00:22:40.603\nThe add-even flow of accounts\nreceivable and accounts payable or\n\n436\n00:22:40.603 --> 00:22:44.150\nsomething the finance\ndepartment is doing every day.\n\n437\n00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.100\nBut then there's also this big\nthing at the end of every month for\n\n438\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.646\npublic trading company.\n\n439\n00:22:49.646 --> 00:22:52.220\nSaid you had to have monthly reports.\n\n440\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.680\nYou have to formulate monthly accounting\nof these things in meaningful\n\n441\n00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.730\nregulated reports.\n\n442\n00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.210\nSo, that's a different\ntype of business activity\n\n443\n00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.630\nall on this rubric of\nfinancial management.\n\n444\n00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.690\nNow, you may have the exact same systems\nunderneath these different activities or\n\n445\n00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.590\nthe same services underneath\nthese activities.\n\n446\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:14.040\nSo, it's probably gonna be useful for\nyou to understand your user profiles.\n\n447\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.900\nYou got the financial analysts\nof the daily type and\n\n448\n00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:22.470\nyou got the financial analysis\nof the monthly type, right?\n\n449\n00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:27.520\nOr how about CEOs versus rank\nusers of that same information?\n\n450\n00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:33.460\nRank and file users using that information\nfor budgeting, making small adjustments\n\n451\n00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:39.850\naccountable, and account for, and\nvalidating expenses and expenditures.\n\n452\n00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.140\nWhereas the CIO or\nthe CFO is looking at the big picture.\n\n453\n00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.520\nAnd they're doing different\nkinds of analysis and\n\n454\n00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.295\nreporting at different times of day.\n\n455\n00:23:48.295 --> 00:23:49.905\nSo again, same service,\n\n456\n00:23:49.905 --> 00:23:54.533\nfinancial management service is being\nused by different types of people.\n\n457\n00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:59.186\nFor different reasons at different time of\nday, at different levels of complexity and\n\n458\n00:23:59.186 --> 00:24:02.230\nat different levels of intensity,\nall right.\n\n459\n00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:07.720\nSo understanding user profiles is close\nrelated to patterns of business activity.\n\n460\n00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.840\nWhen is it used by home?\n\n461\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.776\nOkay, again we can get\ninto the details of this.\n\n462\n00:24:13.776 --> 00:24:18.730\nIn this particular case, if you look at\nthis example, we have a senior executive,\n\n463\n00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.640\nwe've given him a user profile number.\n\n464\n00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.940\nUser profile number one,\njust an index through realities.\n\n465\n00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.020\nAnd this is not prescriptive.\n\n466\n00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:31.830\nThis is just an example of how you might\nconsider mapping PBAs and user profiles\n\n467\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:37.060\ntogether to generate some methodical\napproach to answering demand questions.\n\n468\n00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.630\nSo again,\njust following the first line across.\n\n469\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.820\nWe have senior executive,\nuser profile number one.\n\n470\n00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:48.780\nHe's extensive travel, and\nhe's high technical assistance needed.\n\n471\n00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.760\nHe needs a lot of help.\n\n472\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.520\nSo he's not going to be the super user.\n\n473\n00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.990\nHe's going to be in high\nlevel technical assistance.\n\n474\n00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.600\nThat could mean, that when he goes and\nuses this particular travel\n\n475\n00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.520\napplication or service,\nthe service desk or\n\n476\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.140\nexecutive support team needs to be\nthere holding his hand through it.\n\n477\n00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.660\nThat's a different kind of demand.\n\n478\n00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.200\nYeah, yeah brings me to this point\n\n479\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.350\ndemand management is not just\ndemand on technical resources.\n\n480\n00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.730\nIt's also demand against\nservices resources like people.\n\n481\n00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:20.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n482\n00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.970\n&gt;&gt; So, makes that's your as an example\nearlier when we talked about the learning\n\n483\n00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:29.860\nmanagement converting PowerPoint to\neLearning was a people capacity issue,\n\n484\n00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.290\nnot a system capacity issue.\n\n485\n00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:37.310\nWe had to have people in place\nto make that happen, okay?\n\n486\n00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.480\nSo in this case,\n\n487\n00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.940\nwe have the identification of\nthe pattern of business activity code,\n\n488\n00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.530\n9D, we're relating to that high technical\nassistance, is what that means, right.\n\n489\n00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:53.840\nSo we're just relating a code to a level\nof intensity, is really all it is.\n\n490\n00:25:55.305 --> 00:26:01.040\nUnderstanding that a user profile is\na unique way to describe specific\n\n491\n00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:06.840\nusages by specific types of people, roles\nand relating those to the complexity,\n\n492\n00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:12.990\nintensity or frequency of their engagement\nis what this exercise is about.\n\n493\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.940\n&gt;&gt; I found this kind of interesting who\nis responsible for determining this\n\n494\n00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:22.870\nparticular role codes or\nis it based on ticket requests?\n\n495\n00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.820\nMaybe the helpdesk gets kind of\nintegrated into that in all desk tool.\n\n496\n00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.590\nWhat if I just\n\n497\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.000\ndon't like someone and [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n498\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.320\n&gt;&gt; How do they come up with that?\n\n499\n00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.650\nI think that's\nan interesting concept here.\n\n500\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, first of all,\nthis only examples not prescriptive so\n\n501\n00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:40.020\nit really is how they come up with it\nThey stuck their finger in the wind and\n\n502\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.970\nsays arbitrarily,\nwe're gonna call this 14E and this one 9D.\n\n503\n00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.340\nThey're coming up with some codes for\nthese things.\n\n504\n00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.270\n&gt;&gt; Who would typically\nbe responsible a type-\n\n505\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.350\n&gt;&gt; In this case it would probably be\n\n506\n00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.400\nsomeone who owns the demand\nmanagement process.\n\n507\n00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.520\nSo the process owner of demand\nmanagement will describe parameters for\n\n508\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.150\nhow demand is going to be managed.\n\n509\n00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.718\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; How use a profile so\n\n510\n00:26:57.718 --> 00:26:59.410\nit would be diving into this.\n\n511\n00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:03.030\nNow honestly, I, personally,\njust a disclaimer,\n\n512\n00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.350\nhave not seen demand\nmanagement done this formally.\n\n513\n00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n514\n00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.900\n&gt;&gt; I have not personally seen that.\n\n515\n00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.620\nSo, there's a disclaimer\non my expertise in this.\n\n516\n00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.610\nI do understand what I chose getting that\nis, come up with a methodical approach.\n\n517\n00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:17.430\n&gt;&gt; Sure,\nhow about a surgical approach to it.\n\n518\n00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.898\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so you're not just\nsticking your finger in the wind.\n\n519\n00:27:19.898 --> 00:27:22.330\nAnd saying, this smells like this.\n\n520\n00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.380\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee doesn't like this person,\n\n521\n00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.460\nshe's only gonna have one\nassistant on this particular day.\n\n522\n00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.040\nNo, it needs to have some kind of bearing.\n\n523\n00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.650\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, some sort of bearing, and\nthat's really what the theme of this is.\n\n524\n00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.970\nSo test takers and\noperationally minded folks,\n\n525\n00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.380\nas you consider this idea of demand\nmanagement formalizing your approach,\n\n526\n00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.270\nhow formal you go is going to be\na point of discretion for you.\n\n527\n00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.410\nHonestly it's going to be that.\n\n528\n00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.640\nAs relates to the scope\nof demand management,\n\n529\n00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.430\nplease keep in mind that\nit goes beyond technical.\n\n530\n00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.280\nIt can include people capacity as well.\n\n531\n00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.640\nHow many people do we\nneed at the service desk?\n\n532\n00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.290\nHow many people do we need that can\nconvert PowerPoint to eLearning because\n\n533\n00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:03.810\nthat's also the part of our service\noffering called the remaining service.\n\n534\n00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:07.590\nSo again please keep in mind\nthat demand management is not\n\n535\n00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:11.670\njust about technical capacity it's\nalso a human capacity as well.\n\n536\n00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:15.090\nAnd understanding actually what\nare the customers assets are.\n\n537\n00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.850\nDo they have the capacity\nto do this themselves?\n\n538\n00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.380\nCan they convert PowerPoint?\n\n539\n00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.060\nWould it be nice if we can just\ngive them a slice little tool,\n\n540\n00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.780\nthey stick the PowerPoint in and\nthat the other side becomes eLearning?\n\n541\n00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.470\nCould we automate it, right?\n\n542\n00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.597\nYou see how,\n&gt;&gt; Spoken like a real tech there.\n\n543\n00:28:28.597 --> 00:28:29.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n544\n00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.160\nSo yes, stick it in one in and\nstick it it comes out of the other.\n\n545\n00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.810\nI mean there's all kinds of\napproaches to these things.\n\n546\n00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.990\nIs simply saying, make it methodical.\n\n547\n00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.220\nDon't just stick your finger\nin the wind each time.\n\n548\n00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.680\nCome up with a methodical way.\n\n549\n00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.810\nThe methodical ways and\n\n550\n00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:47.840\nthe language used determine your patterns\nof business activity per user profile.\n\n551\n00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:49.950\nThat gives you the basis.\n\n552\n00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.820\nWhether you come up with codes and\nmap these codes to capacity planning\n\n553\n00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.270\nis a level of complexity you don't\nnecessarily have to go down.\n\n554\n00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.510\nBut is certainly methodical and\nrepeatable.\n\n555\n00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.000\nThat's the theme.\n\n556\n00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.440\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Great question Cherokee.\n\n557\n00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.085\nAlright.\nThis is a good place to in this particular\n\n558\n00:29:08.085 --> 00:29:11.220\nportion, we got a few more topics\nto take up on demand management.\n\n559\n00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.430\nWe'll pick them up in our future episode.\n\n560\n00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.460\nComing soon.\n\n561\n00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.280\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\nThank you Terry for joining us today.\n\n562\n00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.070\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen as well.\n\n563\n00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.770\nBut we are out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n564\n00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:21.900\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n565\n00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.970\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n566\n00:29:23.970 -->

00:00:04.107\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:07.705\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:12.275\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:15.252\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen to\nyour ITIL Service Offerings and\n\n7\n00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:16.252\nAgreements Series.\n\n8\n00:00:16.252 --> 00:00:18.890\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.680\nIn this episode, we will be\nfocusing on Supplier Management.\n\n10\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.030\nAnd with us to cover this topic,\nwe have Mr. Terry Decker in the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.650\nThank you for joining us, Terry.\n\n12\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.050\n&gt;&gt; As always, very happy to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.235\nAnd we're talking about\nSupplier Management.\n\n14\n00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:33.136\nWe've talked quite a few\nprocesses in previous episodes.\n\n15\n00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:37.700\nOne of which tightly related to Supplier\nManagement was Service Level Management.\n\n16\n00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.699\nWe're talking about agreements on\nthe side of the agreements of SOA.\n\n17\n00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.589\nAnd Supplier Management is\ncertainly gonna be concerned\n\n18\n00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.650\nwith the agreements with\nthird party organizations.\n\n19\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.032\nThe ITIL likes to simply use the word\ncontracts to describe those types of\n\n20\n00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:52.705\nagreements.\n\n21\n00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:57.920\nThey are agreements being internal,\ncontracts being external.\n\n22\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.731\nAnd for this particular episode,\n\n23\n00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:03.359\nwe're gonna be digging in to\nthe management of external contracts.\n\n24\n00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.471\n&gt;&gt; It really is kind of a different\nparadigm shift here because a lot of\n\n25\n00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:09.150\nthese management techniques\nthat we spoke about so far.\n\n26\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.160\nThese services have been internal and\n\n27\n00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.800\nwe've been able to control or\nat least have some kind of hold on this.\n\n28\n00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.472\nBut when we're talking about external\nentities and maybe business partners and\n\n29\n00:01:19.472 --> 00:01:23.428\ndifferent vendors, that's really what\nwe're gonna be talking about here, right?\n\n30\n00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:26.815\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, and\nit is a different kind of challenge.\n\n31\n00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:30.495\nMotivating internal folks,\npeople that work for the same companies.\n\n32\n00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:32.412\nThey perhaps have the same\nfinancial incentives.\n\n33\n00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:36.036\nThey even have the social\npressure of peer pressure and\n\n34\n00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:38.435\npeer performance issues, right?\n\n35\n00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:40.828\nYou are invested in pleasing your boss.\n\n36\n00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:43.810\nYou're investing in progressing\nthe goals of the organization.\n\n37\n00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.428\nSo motivation for good performance\nwithin an organization is not this type,\n\n38\n00:01:48.428 --> 00:01:51.310\nthe same motivation for external.\n\n39\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.813\nIn fact, they are driven by money, right?\n\n40\n00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:57.350\nAnd making sure that they have\nan ongoing successful relationship.\n\n41\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.160\nI mean there are the human aspects.\n\n42\n00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.610\nIt's not all just based on I want to get\npaid, you wanna have a good reputation.\n\n43\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.050\nAs a supplier, you wanna be able\nto continue the relationship.\n\n44\n00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.340\nYou want to perform well,\nbut at the end of the day,\n\n45\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.960\nyou're talking about obtaining value for\nmoney.\n\n46\n00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.245\nSupplier Management is\nfocused on that very thing.\n\n47\n00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:16.440\nAas we look at the PowerPoints here then,\n\n48\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.461\nSupplier Management in fact\nhas it's primary purpose.\n\n49\n00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:23.982\nAnd objective is, get value for money,\nwe're paying for something, right?\n\n50\n00:02:23.982 --> 00:02:27.846\nYou want to build in,\nin your relationships and\n\n51\n00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:32.879\nin your contracts,\na way that you can measure value, right?\n\n52\n00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.590\nAre they performing at the right level?\n\n53\n00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.040\nAre they delivering the right number\nof widgets at the right amount of time?\n\n54\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.340\nWhatever it might be,\nare they developing software for you?\n\n55\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.820\nAnd the software is actually\ngot the utility you counted on,\n\n56\n00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.960\nthose types of things.\n\n57\n00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.960\nSo measurement is still part of it,\n\n58\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.460\ncoming up with some objective measurable\ntargets is still part of it, right?\n\n59\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.693\nSo the same kinda principles that apply to\nan internal provider assessing their own\n\n60\n00:02:57.693 --> 00:03:01.270\nperformance as it relates to\ntheir end user customers.\n\n61\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.780\nA supplier also needs to be measured and\nyou understand those throughout.\n\n62\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.240\nAnother aspect of Supplier Management\nis the ongoing relationship and\n\n63\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.130\nthe maintenance of this contract, right?\n\n64\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.790\nContracts have expiration dates,\nthey have end games, right?\n\n65\n00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.640\nSometimes it's for limited scope of works.\n\n66\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.750\nSometimes it's an ongoing,\nperhaps for renewals, right?\n\n67\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.920\nSo there's different things in play here,\nand another thing that Supplier Management\n\n68\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.360\nneeds to do is keep up with the volumes\nof information related to this activity.\n\n69\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.209\nSo coming up with a Supplier Contract\nManagement Information System as you see\n\n70\n00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.307\nit on the last bullet there, is also one\nof the objectives of supplier management.\n\n71\n00:03:38.307 --> 00:03:43.042\nBasically provide in a usable\ntransparent way information\n\n72\n00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:46.840\nrelated to this effort\nof managing suppliers.\n\n73\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.270\nSo as we look at it,\nthe scope is all suppliers and contracts.\n\n74\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.686\nSupplier Management as a process\nis looking at all suppliers and\n\n75\n00:03:56.686 --> 00:03:59.149\ncontracts related to IT services.\n\n76\n00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:01.860\nIt's intended to be adaptable.\n\n77\n00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.260\nIt's not one size fits all, but\n\n78\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.470\nit needs to also to have some\nstructure around it, right?\n\n79\n00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.626\nEnforceable by policy, right?\n\n80\n00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:14.033\nThere we see the SCMIS again,\nin the middle there.\n\n81\n00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:18.540\nMaintain the Supplier and\nContract Management Information System.\n\n82\n00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.640\nCategorizing and\nmanaging risks of your suppliers.\n\n83\n00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.840\nEvaluating and selecting suppliers,\ndeveloping and\n\n84\n00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.510\nnegotiating those contracts.\n\n85\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.437\nMaintaining those contracts,\nmanaging the performance,\n\n86\n00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.394\nincluding of subcontractors, right?\n\n87\n00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:37.050\nAnd handling any disputes\nthat might come up, right?\n\n88\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.607\nSo Supplier Management is a really\nlarge scope as relates to\n\n89\n00:04:40.607 --> 00:04:43.530\nthe management of their\nthird party contracts.\n\n90\n00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.177\nSo why bother?\n\n91\n00:04:46.177 --> 00:04:49.497\nWell certainly you want to\nmaximize the value and honestly,\n\n92\n00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:53.747\nminimize the money you're spending,\nthose kind of go hand in hand, right?\n\n93\n00:04:53.747 --> 00:04:58.235\nYou wanna make sure that your supplier\ncontracts are in line with your internal\n\n94\n00:04:58.235 --> 00:04:59.527\nagreements, right?\n\n95\n00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:01.027\nYour service level requirements,\n\n96\n00:05:01.027 --> 00:05:03.884\nand the targets that are in your\nservice level agreements, right?\n\n97\n00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:08.459\nAnd hopefully standardize this in such\na way that you get better continuity and\n\n98\n00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:10.270\nbetter security throughout.\n\n99\n00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.540\nSo integration among your other\nprocesses is also important.\n\n100\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.133\nAnd there's different\nscopes here involved.\n\n101\n00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:21.785\nI mean some organizations have\na high degree of outsourcing.\n\n102\n00:05:21.785 --> 00:05:27.217\nWe are a drug manufacturer,\nwe're not an IT organization.\n\n103\n00:05:27.217 --> 00:05:31.310\nSo we're gonna outsource this,\nor we're not HR disciplinarians.\n\n104\n00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.798\nLet's outsource all of HR.\n\n105\n00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:36.602\nI mean there's different levels of\ncommitment to external suppliers\n\n106\n00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:37.442\nproviding it.\n\n107\n00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:41.930\nSupplier Management need to be\nthere regardless of the level.\n\n108\n00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.980\nThe importance of this\ncan't be overstated.\n\n109\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.690\nRather busy slide here, but\nreally what is trying to point out is\n\n110\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.040\nwhat's the service provider trying to do,\nwhat is it going to outsource?\n\n111\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.789\nAnd you see in this particular example,\nyou have a contracts manager.\n\n112\n00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.494\nLet me get my laser pointer going here.\n\n113\n00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:04.490\nYou see the contracts manager here,\nwith different supplier managers.\n\n114\n00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.065\nSo you kinda got an upper some sort\nof hierarchical relationship between\n\n115\n00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:10.419\noverall contracts.\n\n116\n00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.780\nAnd then on the ground management\nof these specific contracts.\n\n117\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.740\nSo you might have a particular\nsupplier manager handling\n\n118\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.960\nthe particular services\nrelated to networking.\n\n119\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.870\nA different supplier manager handling\ndatabases potentially, right?\n\n120\n00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.320\nThere's no prescriptive way that\nITIL is going to invent cuz that\n\n121\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.460\nis saying this is how you must do it.\n\n122\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.700\nIt's just an example of how you can\ncertainly divide and conquer the effort.\n\n123\n00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.335\nIt's not necessary a monolithic\nsingle Supplier Management in\n\n124\n00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:44.977\nthe sky type of thing.\n\n125\n00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:46.270\nIt could definitely be decentralised.\n\n126\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.812\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n127\n00:06:46.812 --> 00:06:49.109\n&gt;&gt; Coming up with a methodical process\n&gt;&gt; As long as you have an idea exactly.\n\n128\n00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:49.809\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n129\n00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:53.996\n&gt;&gt; I mean you could probably even have\nsomething like those bottom rectangles\n\n130\n00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:55.998\nthere something like project one.\n\n131\n00:06:55.998 --> 00:07:00.407\nAnd have that particular project\nsupplier manager focus on all those\n\n132\n00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:05.060\nsupplies needed for that particular\nproject or whatever it may be.\n\n133\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.000\n&gt;&gt; Good call, you have some steady state\nthings that are going on all the time.\n\n134\n00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.643\nYou could have project related\ncontracts or just one offs.\n\n135\n00:07:11.643 --> 00:07:12.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n136\n00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.880\n&gt;&gt; They could be big,\nthey could be small, right?\n\n137\n00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.400\nSo understanding that is what\nthis is really trying to,\n\n138\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.020\nget your hand around all\nthose different nuances.\n\n139\n00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.663\nAnd notice also, you look over here,\nyou've got the finance and purchasing and\n\n140\n00:07:24.663 --> 00:07:26.239\nlegal interfaces as well.\n\n141\n00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:31.122\nSo what Supplier Management's trying to do\nis make sure you have an overarching set\n\n142\n00:07:31.122 --> 00:07:34.888\nof guidelines, processes, and\npolicies, the governance for\n\n143\n00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:37.400\nhow we're gonna manage contracts.\n\n144\n00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.120\nAnd we're doing that in concert with\nadvice from our financial partners and\n\n145\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.670\nour legal departments\nwithin our organization.\n\n146\n00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.447\nSo your procurement policies,\nyour legal policies,\n\n147\n00:07:47.447 --> 00:07:51.152\nmaking sure that that's all\nlined up as well, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:51.152 --> 00:07:54.934\nAgain no magical elixir here,\nit's just necessary evil as you take on\n\n149\n00:07:54.934 --> 00:07:58.346\nSupplier Management to get all\nthose dots connected, right?\n\n150\n00:07:58.346 --> 00:08:04.206\nAs with other processes having policies\nthat back this up Policies could\n\n151\n00:08:04.206 --> 00:08:11.043\ndeal with lots of things like where you\ncould have preferred vendor policy, right?\n\n152\n00:08:11.043 --> 00:08:15.362\nNo, if you're trying to do this type of\nactivity here is the four vendors you can\n\n153\n00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:16.140\nchoose from.\n\n154\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.430\nAnd by policy,\nyou must choose one of these vendors.\n\n155\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.990\nUnless you follow some exception\nprocess that lets you pick a vendor for\n\n156\n00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.360\nspecial reasons, right?\n\n157\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.080\nSo policies back up\nthe supplier management process\n\n158\n00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.230\nby governing the behaviors through\nenforceable policies, right?\n\n159\n00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.857\nSo how do we get this and\n\n160\n00:08:37.857 --> 00:08:43.262\nhow are sees the rules regarding\naccepting gifts from suppliers?\n\n161\n00:08:43.262 --> 00:08:44.549\nCan they take you out-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n162\n00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:46.035\n&gt;&gt; To dinner, right?\n\n163\n00:08:46.035 --> 00:08:48.813\nCan they plan that trip to Malaysia for\nyou, and\n\n164\n00:08:48.813 --> 00:08:53.132\nsend all your technicians there for\nsome cocktails, that sort of thing.\n\n165\n00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:55.544\nSo understanding what can be acceptable or\n\n166\n00:08:55.544 --> 00:08:59.100\nnot acceptable is driven more\nby policy than process, right?\n\n167\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.740\nWhat are the rules of engagement here?\n\n168\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.272\nUnderpinning and agreements,\nunderpinning contracts and agreements,\n\n169\n00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:08.565\nis the missing word there.\n\n170\n00:09:08.565 --> 00:09:14.596\nUnderpinning and agreements,\nwhat have you agreed to?\n\n171\n00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:18.174\nPre-agreement risk assessment is vital.\n\n172\n00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:22.042\nBefore you actually get to signing\nthe paper, just where are we?\n\n173\n00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:25.220\nIs it gonna be a good relationshi, right?\n\n174\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:30.420\nSo making sure you have these things\nin place with analysis ahead of time,\n\n175\n00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.840\nmonitoring it in process and\nmonitoring post process.\n\n176\n00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.895\n&gt;&gt; So here, we're be talking\nabout those discussions or\n\n177\n00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:43.901\nagreements that may have been had prior\nto coming up with those vendor policies.\n\n178\n00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:50.250\nSo we can say look, we'll give you a 15%\ndiscount if you use us 30 times this year.\n\n179\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.000\nAnd so\nyou talk to four different companies and\n\n180\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.380\nyou have this four selections and\nthat's kind of where we're going here.\n\n181\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.212\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, exactly.\n\n182\n00:09:57.212 --> 00:10:00.367\nUnderstanding how you get on\nthis prefered vendor list-\n\n183\n00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:01.032\n&gt;&gt; Sure\n\n184\n00:10:01.032 --> 00:10:01.596\n&gt;&gt; Could be based\n\n185\n00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:04.760\non those kind of factors,\nby driven by policy potentially, right?\n\n186\n00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.650\nThere must be price incentives,\nthere must be performance incentives, etc.\n\n187\n00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:14.120\nI know a policy we introduced in my own\nexperience, it was very, very helpful,\n\n188\n00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.070\nis that contracts must build in\nimprovement at no additional cost.\n\n189\n00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.310\nWe expect ourselves for instance,\n\n190\n00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.900\nwhen you launch a new service, there's\ngonna be some growing pains, right?\n\n191\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.650\nSo you expect a high\nvolume of incidents or\n\n192\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.360\nyou expect a high cost\nof putting out fires.\n\n193\n00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.071\nSo you kinda anticipate some of that,\nbut as the service matures,\n\n194\n00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:38.338\nyou expect that to mature, and go away.\n\n195\n00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:42.791\nSo you should have to pay for\nbetter service as the service matures.\n\n196\n00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:49.260\nTake that to a supplier arrangement, so\nlet's say I outsourced my service desk.\n\n197\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.270\nI expect them to be able to deliver\nincident reduction or I expect them,\n\n198\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.920\nsorry, to be able to deliver instant\nresolution time within 23 hours and\n\n199\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.550\nthe volume is a thousand a week.\n\n200\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.400\nI expect them to execute\nincident management\n\n201\n00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.610\nat a rate of 80% of our tickets,\nare resolved within 24 hours.\n\n202\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.720\nSo that would mean 800 tickets\na week are resolved within that.\n\n203\n00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.150\nNext year, the contract is either\n\n204\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.351\nraise the number of-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n205\n00:11:21.351 --> 00:11:25.910\n&gt;&gt; Incidents or increase\nthe performance at no additional cost.\n\n206\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.240\nSo we expect some growing pains,\nyou're gonna get better at it.\n\n207\n00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.900\nWe expect you to get better,\nbut not cost us any more money.\n\n208\n00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.460\nBuilding and improvement incentives for\n\n209\n00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.980\nno additional cost is an absolute\nthing that perhaps policy could dry.\n\n210\n00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.650\nAll contracts must have improvements\nincentives at no additional cost.\n\n211\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.403\nThat was a policy [INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like an insurance policy with\n\n212\n00:11:46.403 --> 00:11:48.397\nthe improved driver experience or\nsomething.\n\n213\n00:11:48.397 --> 00:11:50.175\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good point, yeah.\n\n214\n00:11:50.175 --> 00:11:51.549\nNo accidents in three years, right?\n\n215\n00:11:51.549 --> 00:11:52.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n&gt;&gt; No accidents, good point, yep.\n\n216\n00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:57.354\nGood point, so you get the idea\nhere that policies can drive\n\n217\n00:11:57.354 --> 00:12:02.081\na lot of what underpins\nthe management supplier, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:04.514\nGood points.\n\n219\n00:12:04.514 --> 00:12:06.885\nOf course, you're gonna have a legal and\ncommercial topics.\n\n220\n00:12:06.885 --> 00:12:08.710\nYou gonna have to deal with\nthe commercial site of business.\n\n221\n00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.490\nWhat's gonna caused?\nWhat's the price structured?\n\n222\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.570\nWhat's the payment structured?\n\n223\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.234\nHow often do we get paid?\n\n224\n00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:18.570\nHow do we penalize you, and\nhow do we manage the penalties, right?\n\n225\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.985\nIs it less money is sent your way, right?\n\n226\n00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:23.340\nDo you have to give us more things back,\nright?\n\n227\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.010\nSo if we find 60\n\n228\n00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:32.310\ndefects every time you deliver software\nto us, do we get the next one for free?\n\n229\n00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.959\nWho knows, those types of things\nneed to be build it, right?\n\n230\n00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:42.184\nAnd again supplier management is\nthe process that governs it, right?\n\n231\n00:12:42.184 --> 00:12:46.590\nBecause it's legal, right?\n\n232\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.890\nBecause we end up being legal,\nwe necessarily go through legal processes.\n\n233\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.519\nSo while agreements are internal, right?\n\n234\n00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:56.310\nThey're usually within, right?\n\n235\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.610\nUnderpinning agreements are agreements\nthat underpin SLAs between the IT service\n\n236\n00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.750\nprovider and their customer.\n\n237\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.552\nSo you have a contract that says\nyou're gonna provide these services.\n\n238\n00:13:04.552 --> 00:13:08.210\nAnd then we have these targets underneath\nit, inside these agreements, right?\n\n239\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.320\nUnderpinning agreements, all right.\n\n240\n00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.170\nSo this idea of having here\ninformation in one sack.\n\n241\n00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.431\nSupplier and\ncontract management information system.\n\n242\n00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:24.940\nIn a nutshell,\nit suggest that it's probably a database.\n\n243\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.610\nIt could be a spreadsheet,\nit could be a SharePoint list.\n\n244\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.106\nWe're not dictating how it looks or\nhow it's built.\n\n245\n00:13:30.106 --> 00:13:32.290\n&gt;&gt; Just a culmination of that information.\n\n246\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.891\n&gt;&gt; This things, what suppliers do you\nhave and are they supplying, right?\n\n247\n00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:38.500\nWhen is the contract due?\n\n248\n00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.652\nWhen is it up for renewal?\n\n249\n00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.320\nThose types of things, right?\n\n250\n00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.840\nSo keeping up with this information in a\nmeaningful place, transparent, and easy to\n\n251\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.550\nuse would be the goal of the supplier and\ncontract management information system.\n\n252\n00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.349\nAnd it's gonna be up to the owner\nof the supplier management process\n\n253\n00:13:53.349 --> 00:13:56.095\nto make sure that the system is enabled,\nright?\n\n254\n00:13:56.095 --> 00:13:57.927\nThat it's effective and working.\n\n255\n00:13:57.927 --> 00:14:02.319\nIt's gonna be the supplier manager\nthat's going to be updating this and\n\n256\n00:14:02.319 --> 00:14:05.010\nkeeping it current, right?\n\n257\n00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.473\nSo again, it needs to be in place.\n\n258\n00:14:06.473 --> 00:14:10.110\nYou can also include easy link to\none of the terms in conditions.\n\n259\n00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.940\nHow do we escalate, for instance?\n\n260\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.589\nIf you look at the full screen there,\n\n261\n00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:20.058\nyou can see that this information can\nalso be, to show preferential rates,\n\n262\n00:14:20.058 --> 00:14:24.683\nto show distinguishing\ncharacteristics between one another.\n\n263\n00:14:24.683 --> 00:14:29.618\nSo if I look at the Supplier Contract\nManagement Information System and I see\n\n264\n00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:35.440\nfour different organizations or suppliers\nthat can do eLearning conversions from me.\n\n265\n00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.040\nPowerPoint to eLearning,\nI see four different ones involved and\n\n266\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.360\none of them is internal and\ncost $50 per PowerPoint.\n\n267\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.930\nAnd the other ones are external and\ncost $80 per PowerPoint.\n\n268\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.646\nI might want to distinguish what\nam I getting for the extra $80, or\n\n269\n00:14:48.646 --> 00:14:51.910\nam I actually pointing people\nto the internal service.\n\n270\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.660\nYou get the idea there.\n\n271\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.865\n&gt;&gt; Maybe even assigning\nthem a vendor preference?\n\n272\n00:14:54.865 --> 00:14:55.609\nIs there something like that?\n\n273\n00:14:55.609 --> 00:14:56.313\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n274\n00:14:56.313 --> 00:14:59.763\nPriorities are preferences, yep,\nput them in there those types of things.\n\n275\n00:14:59.763 --> 00:15:04.824\nGood point, or\ndesignating them as a prefered\n\n276\n00:15:04.824 --> 00:15:10.295\nvendor would be a part of\nthe SCMIS as well, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:10.295 --> 00:15:14.960\nSo again reminding you if you look at\nthe full screen here, this relationship\n\n278\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.110\nbetween the big overarching service\nknowledge management system,\n\n279\n00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.690\nthat is a huge thing.\n\n280\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:26.000\nThe CMS is part of the configuration\nmanagement system.\n\n281\n00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.541\nAnd the SCMIS is just a part of\nthe bigger picture, the SKMS.\n\n282\n00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:34.274\nThis is showing a relationship\nfrom one to the other, right?\n\n283\n00:15:34.274 --> 00:15:36.895\nIt really isn't magical here.\n\n284\n00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:41.383\nIt just shows that a Supplier Contract\nManagement Information System is yet\n\n285\n00:15:41.383 --> 00:15:45.953\nanother repository for value information\nrelated to supplier management.\n\n286\n00:15:45.953 --> 00:15:49.964\nOkay, all right, so\nthe things that a supplier\n\n287\n00:15:49.964 --> 00:15:54.190\nmanagement process need to do,\nthe activities.\n\n288\n00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.710\nAs you can see here,\nyour coming up with supplier strategy and\n\n289\n00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.817\npolicies kinda is a feeder, right?\n\n290\n00:15:59.817 --> 00:16:01.540\nThat gets this thing going.\n\n291\n00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.512\nWhat is your strategy for\nsupplier management?\n\n292\n00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:06.740\nDo you want to have A strategy\nthat prefer vendors.\n\n293\n00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.552\nYou don't wanna manage just,\neveryone goes find their own supplier and\n\n294\n00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.010\nwe'll add them to the list.\n\n295\n00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:16.090\nOr do you want to, somehow put suppliers\nin competition with each other,\n\n296\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.130\nin a way that sounds so manageable, right?\n\n297\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:24.815\nAgain, considering this example of\nlearning management where we didn't\n\n298\n00:16:24.815 --> 00:16:30.638\nanticipate the flood gates opening for\nconverting PowerPoints to eLearning.\n\n299\n00:16:30.638 --> 00:16:33.410\nWhat did business did was,\nthey went and found vendors.\n\n300\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.750\nThey just went and found them.\n\n301\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.900\nAnd then of course, different vendors\nprovide different kinds of quality.\n\n302\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.650\nIt was all over the map.\n\n303\n00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.340\nAnd we basically had to do\na supplier management time out.\n\n304\n00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.880\nWe do not need 50\ndifferent vendors in play.\n\n305\n00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.050\nWe're just, we're spending as\nmany time managing contracts\n\n306\n00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.930\nas we are converting learning.\n\n307\n00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.720\nIt's too busy of a place, so, time out.\n\n308\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.168\nWe're gonna come up with the best vendor.\n\n309\n00:16:54.168 --> 00:16:58.560\nAnd we're gonna teach them the best\npractices as we would like them to use for\n\n310\n00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.160\nthe conversion of this.\n\n311\n00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.660\nRight?\n\n312\n00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.042\nSo we're gonna build in some controls.\n\n313\n00:17:03.042 --> 00:17:06.040\nWe're gonna come up with some preferred\nvendors, they're gonna know us and\n\n314\n00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.160\nknow as well.\n\n315\n00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.840\nAnd we have multiples so we keep them in\ncompetition but we're not gonna have 1000\n\n316\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.690\nof them or 50 of them, we're gonna have a\nsmaller group of these to ensure quality,\n\n317\n00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:21.910\nto ensure relationship while keeping\nthat competitive level in play, okay.\n\n318\n00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.690\nSo then you'll see that once you\nget the general policies in place,\n\n319\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:32.020\nwe're looking at defining new\nsupplier management requirements,\n\n320\n00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.510\nwhat are the requirements for these.\n\n321\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.650\nNotice that cyclical,\nit comes around here.\n\n322\n00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:42.587\nSo defining the new suppliers,\nevaluating them, establishing supplier,\n\n323\n00:17:42.587 --> 00:17:47.812\nmanaging them ongoing, renewal or\ntermination, back to the top.\n\n324\n00:17:47.812 --> 00:17:49.128\nCyclical, right?\n\n325\n00:17:49.128 --> 00:17:51.746\nSo we're gonna look at each one of\nthese as we go through here, okay?\n\n326\n00:17:51.746 --> 00:17:57.310\nBasically, defining requirements\nis what do we need to do?\n\n327\n00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:01.870\nAgain, consider that example of\nconverting Powerpoint to eLearning.\n\n328\n00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:05.380\nThat became a requirement\nof significant demand.\n\n329\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.220\nOkay, let's go find some suppliers.\n\n330\n00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.690\nAgain, if you have a supplier management\nprocess in place you know where to turn,\n\n331\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.310\nand you say hey,\ncan you help us with this?\n\n332\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.480\nWe need to find them.\n\n333\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.696\nI got a list of one, I got a list of ones\nat my work, will you vet these for us?\n\n334\n00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:18.730\nWill you find the,\n\n335\n00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:23.340\nget the commercial figure out, the cost,\nbenefit analysis of these suppliers?\n\n336\n00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.190\nCan you work them through our procurement\nprocess and our legal process?\n\n337\n00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.660\nWe need help here, right.\n\n338\n00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.830\nSo going through a supplier management\nregime is where you get that kinda help.\n\n339\n00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.190\nAnd come up with the actual\nstatements of requirements.\n\n340\n00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:40.840\nWe have a thousand PowerPoints to convert\nto eLearning by the end of this quarter.\n\n341\n00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.350\nHow can we do that?\n\n342\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.550\nSo you get the Statement of Requirements.\n\n343\n00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.700\nAnd with the Statement of Requirements,\nyou can start shopping it around, right.\n\n344\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.360\nPerhaps you do a request for a proposal,\nor a request for information, right.\n\n345\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.460\nYou put it out on the streets and\nsee if you can't figure this out, right.\n\n346\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.800\nAnd when you have those requirements\nin place and you get your responses,\n\n347\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.540\nthen you're gonna talk about\nevaluation and procurement, right.\n\n348\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.020\n&gt;&gt; When those bids start rolling in.\n\n349\n00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well you got the bids,\n\n350\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.340\nnow you're going to evaluate and\nprocure the new contracts and suppliers.\n\n351\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.980\nSo you've defined the needs,\nyou've done some betting, and\n\n352\n00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.160\nnow you're looking for\na criteria for selection.\n\n353\n00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.049\nIs it cost-based?\n\n354\n00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:16.210\nIs it quality-based?\n\n355\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.220\nIs it reputation-based?\n\n356\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.760\n&gt;&gt; Insurance-based or-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, good points, right.\n\n357\n00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.700\nDo we have conflicts already existing\nwith a supplier that aren't yet resolved?\n\n358\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.830\nAre they good?\n\n359\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.180\nHave we already done business with them?\n\n360\n00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:34.630\nThey already been approved for other\nmaster services agreements, etc., okay.\n\n361\n00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.460\nSo, criteria for\nselection come up with those and\n\n362\n00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.955\nfollow those in a routine way, right.\n\n363\n00:19:39.955 --> 00:19:44.091\nDo you wanna go single supplier,\nmulti-source or\n\n364\n00:19:44.091 --> 00:19:49.070\npreferred, right, where we have a small\nlist of preferred supplier status.\n\n365\n00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.730\nDo they have that preferred\nsupplier status, right?\n\n366\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.420\nAgain, this is our part\nof evaluation piece.\n\n367\n00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.780\nDo they have a capability,\ndo you wanna go with one?\n\n368\n00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.990\nDo you wanna multi-source it?\n\n369\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.224\nWhat you gain from multi-sourcing\nobviously is ability to leverage\n\n370\n00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:09.896\ncompetitive factors, keep factoring\neach other if you don't support me,\n\n371\n00:20:09.896 --> 00:20:13.120\nwell, I'll just go with this other vendor.\n\n372\n00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.670\nSo, they'll be more motivated,\netc., or again,\n\n373\n00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.800\ngoing with the preferred supplier\nstatus that we've talked about earlier.\n\n374\n00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.610\nAgain staying with this\nprocuring new contracts and\n\n375\n00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:28.780\nsuppliers, strategic alignment,\nintegration.\n\n376\n00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.010\nHow are we going to manage the flow\nbetween our two organizations?\n\n377\n00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.910\nDo you like us, do we like you?\n\n378\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.000\nI mean honestly, human factors come in\nhere, can we trust each other, right?\n\n379\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.080\nHow open are you to changes?\n\n380\n00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.410\nHow open are you to improvements?\n\n381\n00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.040\nDo we share this risk?\n\n382\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.600\nAre you on this journey\nas a one time deal?\n\n383\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.860\nAre you here for a long term relationship?\n\n384\n00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:49.360\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n385\n00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.098\n&gt;&gt; I mean, even just within IT,\n\n386\n00:20:51.098 --> 00:20:54.787\nwhat sale is contracting out\nsome employees or something, and\n\n387\n00:20:54.787 --> 00:20:58.685\nI am aware that certifications have\nthe tendency to expire over for\n\n388\n00:20:58.685 --> 00:20:59.720\nyears here.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n389\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.581\n&gt;&gt; Are you gonna keep your\n\n390\n00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:02.817\nemployees up to date?\nAre you gonna provide that continued\n\n391\n00:21:02.817 --> 00:21:05.030\neducation-type deal?\n&gt;&gt; Good call, good call.\n\n392\n00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.530\nAbsolutely.\n\n393\n00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.210\nAnd again,\nare they going to improve with you, right?\n\n394\n00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:09.710\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n395\n00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.860\n&gt;&gt; Again, you're gonna probably have\nto vet this through various things.\n\n396\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.440\nYour procurement processes and your\nlegal processes are rant to be engaged.\n\n397\n00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.000\nDoes it support your service\nlevel management regime.\n\n398\n00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.460\nHave you talked with service\nlevel management to understand\n\n399\n00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.660\nwhat needs to be delivered?\n\n400\n00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.460\nDo you have the appropriate OLA's and\nSLA's in place, etc., right?\n\n401\n00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.360\nAs you gonna cost right?\n\n402\n00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.980\nI mean you got financial people involved,\nright.\n\n403\n00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.210\nSo, again,\nthat's why it's a special discipline.\n\n404\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.760\nYou're dealing with legal things, you're\ndealing with procurement activities,\n\n405\n00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:42.210\nyou're dealing with ongoing maintenance\nof agreements and disputes potentially.\n\n406\n00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.080\nAnd, of course, it's costing money,\nso are we gonna pay them on time?\n\n407\n00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:46.840\nRight?\nCan we provide\n\n408\n00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.878\nthem the assurances that they're\ngoing to be paid on time?\n\n409\n00:21:48.878 --> 00:21:53.540\nAre they gonna deliver on time, etc.\n\n410\n00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.600\nNow, this idea of supplier categorization.\n\n411\n00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.400\nAnother activity.\n\n412\n00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.470\nYou can see on this chart that\nin the lower left hand corner,\n\n413\n00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:06.185\nyou got what they're calling commodity\nsuppliers or operational suppliers,\n\n414\n00:22:06.185 --> 00:22:07.730\nkinda at the lower tier.\n\n415\n00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:13.920\nThese are suppliers that provide\nthings that you do everyday, right?\n\n416\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.850\nOr it's easy replaceable.\n\n417\n00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:20.430\nIt's not that they're not valuable, it's\njust you can find another one that just\n\n418\n00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.070\nlooks like them tomorrow, if you had to.\n\n419\n00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.710\nCommodity is certainly in that category,\n\n420\n00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:28.638\nlike, if you're a supplier of toner\ncartridges for your printers, and\n\n421\n00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:31.870\nI don't wanna do business with you\nanymore, what do you want to do?\n\n422\n00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.810\nYou go to Staples for a week and\nfigure that out until you find another\n\n423\n00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.870\nsupplier and then you'll figure\nthat one out pretty quick.\n\n424\n00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.370\nSo, that's not so impactful,\nso you see the impact or\n\n425\n00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:47.030\nvalue is kinda low and their risk and\nimpact is kinda low, right?\n\n426\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:51.250\nIf you go to the other extreme,\nyour strategic suppliers, honestly,\n\n427\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.830\nwhat would ITProTV do without their ISP,\nas an example.\n\n428\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.520\nPretty critical for\nthem that the ISP is resilient-\n\n429\n00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.084\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n430\n00:22:59.084 --> 00:23:00.643\n&gt;&gt; Responsive, right,\n\n431\n00:23:00.643 --> 00:23:05.570\nunderstanding your needs as a service\nprovider is important, right.\n\n432\n00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.660\nSo they're a bit more\nstrategically linked,\n\n433\n00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:17.160\nif you consider those kind in\nthe middle your tactical suppliers.\n\n434\n00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.420\nThere's other once that we could use but\n\n435\n00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.260\nthat is kinda hard chains that move\nto shift towards the supplier.\n\n436\n00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.190\nThat's were the tactical.\n\n437\n00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:29.470\nIt's a little bit more difficult to change\ncourse if you move that supplier around or\n\n438\n00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.600\nhave to get to a different supplier,\nright?\n\n439\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.520\nSo, understanding these categories gives\nyou your risk assessment effectively.\n\n440\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.740\nFirst you categorize your suppliers and\nthen based on those categorizations you\n\n441\n00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.930\nhave a good understanding of your risk and\nimpact of losing your particular supplier.\n\n442\n00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.580\nThat's why supplier categorization\nis all about risk mitigation.\n\n443\n00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.090\nUnderstanding the risk and\nbeing able to mitigate it if possible,\n\n444\n00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.890\nokay, also a key activity\nsupplier management.\n\n445\n00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.430\nSo, as this plays out on exam,\nyou'll be looking at potentially\n\n446\n00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:05.050\nquestions that tease out your\ncategorization weakness.\n\n447\n00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:10.420\nFor instance, the scenario might say\nsomething like, you've only just began\n\n448\n00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:15.450\nsupplier management and have no way\nto categorize your suppliers, right?\n\n449\n00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.806\nYou don't have an SCMIS yet, right?\n\n450\n00:24:17.806 --> 00:24:20.000\nSo they're showing you the weaknesses,\nright?\n\n451\n00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.530\nYou do have policy,\nyou got management by hand,\n\n452\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.050\nthat we need to have supplier management.\n\n453\n00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.480\nSo where you're gonna begin?\n\n454\n00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.600\nAgain a good place to begin is\nget your suppliers categorize so\n\n455\n00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.650\nyou understand your risk, right?\n\n456\n00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:36.610\nThen you might supplement policy or\nget policy built so\n\n457\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.530\nthat it can give you the tools you need or\n\n458\n00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:44.592\nthe backing you need to create\npreferred vendors, etc., okay.\n\n459\n00:24:44.592 --> 00:24:46.940\nAll right.\n\n460\n00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.600\nAs we mentioned, I talked to these\npoints as that graphic was showing,\n\n461\n00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.770\nstrategic, tactical,\noperational, commodity.\n\n462\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.040\nThis is just here in textible form,\n\n463\n00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.930\nkinda spoke to that as I dealt\nwith the graphical here, okay.\n\n464\n00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.924\nSo no new information there, all right.\n\n465\n00:25:04.983 --> 00:25:09.231\nAgain, having this service,\nI mean supplier contractor management\n\n466\n00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:13.920\ninformation system, having your supplier\ncategorization as part of that.\n\n467\n00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.975\nIn other words, if you had a spreadsheet\nthat showed you all your suppliers,\n\n468\n00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:22.940\nand one of the fields was their\ncategorization, strategic, operational,\n\n469\n00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.520\ntactical, commodity,\nobviously you can did filter that list and\n\n470\n00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.420\nunderstand where you are to\nbe it more effectively.\n\n471\n00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.490\nSo they kinda go together,\nthese data points, right?\n\n472\n00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:35.090\nUnderstanding the cost exposure,\nunderstanding the risk exposure\n\n473\n00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.388\nis what your STMIS going to help with,\nand conversation helps there.\n\n474\n00:25:38.388 --> 00:25:39.425\nAll right.\n\n475\n00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:47.633\nAnd then again maintaining these\ninformation through understanding\n\n476\n00:25:47.633 --> 00:25:49.620\nhow the supply chain works.\n\n477\n00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:54.120\nWhat do they give you, what do you have\nto give them so they can get that to you?\n\n478\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.310\nSo having swim lanes that describes\nhow information's given to them,\n\n479\n00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.250\nhow they feed back solutions and\n\n480\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.250\nvice versa is probably a great way to\nconsider your supply chain analysis,\n\n481\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:10.700\nas you go through your supplier\nmanagement regime, okay.\n\n482\n00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.480\nThat's a pretty good place to stop for\nthis amount of time.\n\n483\n00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.110\nWe got a few more things to cover\noff on supplier management.\n\n484\n00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.710\nWe'll pick those up in\na subsequent episode.\n\n485\n00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, it sounds good, we'll\nhave a part two headed your way but for\n\n486\n00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.700\nthis show, we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n487\n00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.590\nSo I'm gonna sign out as your

and\n\n6\n00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:16.091\nagreements series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:18.126\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:21.770\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at supplier management.\n\n9\n00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.110\nAnd yes, this is a part two.\n\n10\n00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.610\nA continuation of that\nprevious conversation.\n\n11\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.422\nAnd back with us in studios today,\nwe have Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n12\n00:00:28.422 --> 00:00:30.024\nThank you for joining us today, Terry.\n\n13\n00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:31.649\n&gt;&gt; As always, happy to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.120\nAnd supplier management is\na good important topic.\n\n15\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.020\nAnd worthy of the good discussion here,\nin that it's gonna make sure that our\n\n16\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.542\nsuppliers are able to perform as needed,\nright?\n\n17\n00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.122\nAnd on time, on budget, etc.\n\n18\n00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:47.525\nSo as we look at the graphics here,\nat the PowerPoints here,\n\n19\n00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:52.150\nwe're moving past this identification\nof requirements and selection.\n\n20\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.380\nAnd now we're actually going to establish,\nwhat's necessary\n\n21\n00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.850\nwhen actually getting these new suppliers\nand contracts in the house, right?\n\n22\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.290\nWe know who we want to be there,\nand we're bringing them in,\n\n23\n00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.030\nand they're gonna start\nproviding services for us.\n\n24\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.130\nSo we've already gone through that.\n\n25\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.165\nThe establishment of new suppliers should\nprobably be handled through change\n\n26\n00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:09.640\nmanagement.\n\n27\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.810\nChange management is sometimes understated\nI think, in service management traditions.\n\n28\n00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.118\nChange management is often\nseen as what you do,\n\n29\n00:01:19.118 --> 00:01:21.608\nwhen you have to do a technical\nchange to a service.\n\n30\n00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:26.275\nJust to remind you, ITIL looks at\nchange management a lot more broadly,\n\n31\n00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:30.943\nto cover any kind of thing, any kind\nof activity that's a new activity,\n\n32\n00:01:30.943 --> 00:01:34.000\nthat can impact the delivery of services.\n\n33\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.070\nSo I think it is pretty\nstraightforward then,\n\n34\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.010\nthat you could consider the adoption of a\nnew supplier, or establish a new supplier,\n\n35\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.600\nas significant enough to manage through\nan ongoing change management process.\n\n36\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.160\nWhich effectively is going to\nmanage the risk for you, right?\n\n37\n00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.860\nChange management and\nrisk management go hand-in-hand.\n\n38\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.520\nSo understanding your operational\nrisk of a new supplier coming in.\n\n39\n00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.770\nAnd quantifying that risk, identifying it\nand analysing is gonna be pretty critical.\n\n40\n00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.450\nAnd understanding the business impact\nanalysis of this particular contract, or\n\n41\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.590\nthis particular supplier is big too.\n\n42\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.150\nJust where do they fit in\nthe overall scheme of things?\n\n43\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.600\nNow, these next few bullets.\n\n44\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.420\nThe blame game.\n\n45\n00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.430\nRelationship threats.\n\n46\n00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.360\nRelationship ownership and reviews.\n\n47\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.110\nThresholds and break points.\n\n48\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.190\nThis is really about,\none part good contracts.\n\n49\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.930\nEstablishing good fences and\ngood neighbors, right?\n\n50\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.650\nThat's one part of it.\n\n51\n00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.750\nBut it's also just about the human\nelement of supplier management.\n\n52\n00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.540\nIs it possible to overwork a supplier?\n\n53\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.350\nMake them mad, they don't wanna\nbe your supplier any more, right?\n\n54\n00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.860\nIs it possible to overly blame them,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.000\nLet them be the scapegoat.\n\n56\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.878\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n57\n00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:45.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\nSo this is a two-part piece.\n\n58\n00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.740\nI mean, you have to be a supplier manager,\nhonest and open with your suppliers.\n\n59\n00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.300\nThey need to be honest and open with you.\n\n60\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.830\nSo coming up with these good\nrelationships is important, right?\n\n61\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.735\nAnd blame game is not really part of that,\nright?\n\n62\n00:02:56.735 --> 00:03:01.552\nGetting in a culture of blame is\nmore about covering your basis,\n\n63\n00:03:01.552 --> 00:03:05.455\nand not stepping up to plate for\nimprovement.\n\n64\n00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:07.290\nWhichever side of the fence you're on,\n\n65\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.200\nblaming is not gonna be\na good course of action.\n\n66\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.694\nIn fact,\nblaming is part of relationship threats.\n\n67\n00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:16.620\nIf the supplier is willing to throw you\nunder the bus as a supplier manager, and\n\n68\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.370\nvice versa,\nthen you're going down the wrong path.\n\n69\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.990\nIt's a slippery slope,\nit leads to bad outcomes.\n\n70\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.480\n&gt;&gt; Nobody likes that person.\n\n71\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.410\nWe probably all know that one person-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.550\n&gt;&gt; And they just can't take accountability\n\n73\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.480\nfor anything, whether it had been\nin your past or current endeavors.\n\n74\n00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.048\nNobody likes them.\n\n75\n00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:35.652\n&gt;&gt; No, exactly.\n\n76\n00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:37.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I mean it cost so\n\n77\n00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:41.290\nmuch in relationships and\ntrust, it also cost time, right?\n\n78\n00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.290\nIf you're not willing to step up and\nsay my bad, sorry about that.\n\n79\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.800\nAnd then move on to improvement, right?\n\n80\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.790\nIs what it should be.\n\n81\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.880\nSo just as you deal with human\nrelationships inside your organization,\n\n82\n00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.970\nblame game is not a great place to go.\n\n83\n00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.580\nIt also applies to your suppliers.\n\n84\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.655\nAnd again trying to teach in\nsome esoteric things here.\n\n85\n00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:02.145\nBut what you're gonna see,\nas this may play out on the exam,\n\n86\n00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:06.190\nis you might see a scenario that\ntalks about finger pointing, right?\n\n87\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.762\nYou need to correct that, through\nan appropriate measurement-based approach.\n\n88\n00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:15.153\nSo if you do need to remediate.\n\n89\n00:04:15.153 --> 00:04:20.010\nIf you do need to make corrective\naction of a supplier, do so\n\n90\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.010\nin good faith with good movement\ntoward achievable targets.\n\n91\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.310\nJust as you would if they\nwere your best friend.\n\n92\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.550\nSay how are we gonna do this?\n\n93\n00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.208\nI forgive you, but, right?\n\n94\n00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:31.615\nAnd then follow through\nwith some good things.\n\n95\n00:04:31.615 --> 00:04:35.990\nSo understanding when you've crossed\nthose thresholds of acceptability,\n\n96\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.260\nof acceptable behavior,\nof acceptable performance.\n\n97\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.170\nUnderstand whether those\nthreshold have been breached.\n\n98\n00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.580\nAnd understanding when,\nyou know what we can't do this anymore.\n\n99\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.180\nWhat are the break points?\n\n100\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.730\nUnderstanding those as well, okay.\n\n101\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.536\nI've certainly had\nthe fire suppliers before.\n\n102\n00:04:50.536 --> 00:04:53.340\nIt's not easy, one from a human level,\n\n103\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.810\nit's also not necessarily\neasy contractually.\n\n104\n00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.773\nSo having understood thresholds and\nbreak points,\n\n105\n00:04:58.773 --> 00:05:01.677\nis really what part of\nthe aspect is there, right.\n\n106\n00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:04.270\nSo what about performance then?\n\n107\n00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.900\nThat's gonna be where\nthe rubber meets the road.\n\n108\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.060\nHow are they performing, right?\n\n109\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.440\nHow do they do with, just what they're\nsupposed to do, operationally speaking?\n\n110\n00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.670\nIs it clear how we interface\nwith those organizations,\n\n111\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.400\nthose external organizations?\n\n112\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.304\nAnd if that is clear, then you focus\non the actual operations of incidents,\n\n113\n00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:24.486\nproblems, change and\nconfiguration as necessary, right?\n\n114\n00:05:24.486 --> 00:05:27.810\nHow do you go about\nreviewing your suppliers?\n\n115\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.860\nHow formal is that, right?\n\n116\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.060\nAnd how often does it happen?\n\n117\n00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.513\nAnd again, building in improvement\nwithout additional cost, should\n\n118\n00:05:36.513 --> 00:05:41.700\nbe a trick you try to pull out of your\nhat, as you define the contract, right?\n\n119\n00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.320\nSo they should improve ongoing,\nwithout additional cost.\n\n120\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.280\nIt's a great way to consider\nyour contract scope, right?\n\n121\n00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.743\nAs you consider the financial benefits.\n\n122\n00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:54.840\nThere gonna be considering\nthe financial benefits.\n\n123\n00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.830\nDo they get more pay,\nif they perform higher?\n\n124\n00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.540\nSure, you could build that\ninto your contracts as well.\n\n125\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.540\nAnd of course,\nthe converse is true as well.\n\n126\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.030\nIf they're not performing,\ndo they get penalized?\n\n127\n00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.145\nThat also could be built in.\n\n128\n00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:10.663\nSo good fences, good neighbors,\ngood understanding, transparency and\n\n129\n00:06:10.663 --> 00:06:13.541\nalso trust,\nneeds to be built in here, right?\n\n130\n00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:19.600\nAs you consider renewal time or\nend of term.\n\n131\n00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.390\nAppreciate what's put\nhere in the red texture.\n\n132\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.350\nNatural tendency is to want\nto avoid making changes,\n\n133\n00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.600\nand wait until it needs fixed, right?\n\n134\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.660\nActually you should build in the end\ngame within the contract itself.\n\n135\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.890\nIn other words, understand the end,\n\n136\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.060\nwhat the end looks like,\nbefore you gonna gauge at the contract.\n\n137\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.690\nHow do we get out of this?\n\n138\n00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.573\nThere could be a time limit for sure,\nbut what about these performance things?\n\n139\n00:06:42.573 --> 00:06:45.475\nIs there 30-day notice period?\n\n140\n00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:49.300\nYou have to give them 30 days notice,\nbefore you end the contract, etc.\n\n141\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.390\nThose types of things.\n\n142\n00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.250\nAnd what is the criteria for\nending, before the end of the term?\n\n143\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.490\n&gt;&gt; Sure Terry.\nI could see if there was any kind of\n\n144\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.120\npremature termination there, there might\neven be a little bit of high tension.\n\n145\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.400\nSo that's not really the time to be\nnegotiating any kind of exit strategy.\n\n146\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.630\n&gt;&gt; Very good, very good point, agreed.\n\n147\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.750\nAnd again, do it when the relationship\nis young, fresh and optimistic.\n\n148\n00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.236\nAnd then you don't have to worry,\nthrough those emotions later on.\n\n149\n00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:17.780\nGood point, very good.\n\n150\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.590\nSo again, the time to think about\nthe end of relationship is at the start.\n\n151\n00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.948\nAll right, and it's a good dating advice-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n152\n00:07:24.948 --> 00:07:25.837\nI was gonna say-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n153\n00:07:25.837 --> 00:07:27.346\n&gt;&gt; Don't use this in your personal life.\n\n154\n00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:29.541\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't see it going over too well.\n\n155\n00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:30.679\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:31.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n158\n00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:33.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty funny.\n\n159\n00:07:33.546 --> 00:07:35.200\nBut yeah, you get the idea there.\n\n160\n00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.260\nDefinitely some levity and necessary.\n\n161\n00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.650\nBut it is, as it relates to your\ncontracts, your contractual relationships,\n\n162\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.850\nso your legal relationships,\n\n163\n00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:47.260\nit's best to think about how it\nends as you begin, for sure there.\n\n164\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.360\nSo understand what's the criteria for\npremature termination.\n\n165\n00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.100\nWhat is the criteria for\nrewards, punishment, etc.\n\n166\n00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.730\nOkay, so straightforward there,\npretty much straight.\n\n167\n00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.750\nAgain, information management system,\nwe talked about the supplier contract,\n\n168\n00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.050\nmanagement information system.\n\n169\n00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.310\nThis does not have to be big,\nrobust, complicated.\n\n170\n00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.730\nCertainly to get started, it can just\nsimply be a list of all your suppliers and\n\n171\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.450\nwhat they do for you, right?\n\n172\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.540\nAnd how much they cost?\n\n173\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.030\nWhat's their price point?\n\n174\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.260\nAre they a preferred vendor or not, etc.\n\n175\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.668\nAgain you can start off simple,\nit can also end up being pretty robust.\n\n176\n00:08:25.668 --> 00:08:29.970\nIt could you have triggers built into it,\nto remind you as a supplier manager,\n\n177\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.950\nwhen the contract is coming up for review.\n\n178\n00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:36.800\nIt could have performance data built\ninto it, linked to dashboards.\n\n179\n00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.420\nThere's all kinds of ways to\nmake this very, very robust.\n\n180\n00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.570\nBut a simple one,\nis a great place to start.\n\n181\n00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.490\nJust to get your head\naround your suppliers.\n\n182\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.110\nAnd to get your head around\nwhat category they are.\n\n183\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.910\nAre they strategic?\n\n184\n00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.980\nAre they commodity?\n\n185\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.550\nWhat risk do they provide, etc.\n\n186\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:59.420\nAll right, supplier management built\non KPIs and critical success factors.\n\n187\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.170\nAre you protecting the business,\n\n188\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.430\nto make sure you're not going to leave the\nbusiness hanging, if the supplier fails.\n\n189\n00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.220\nJust an anecdotal story.\n\n190\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:14.050\nIt happens to be from an exam agency,\nthat supports the ITIL certifications.\n\n191\n00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.638\nThey happen to go down\non a Friday afternoon.\n\n192\n00:09:16.638 --> 00:09:21.160\nAnd that's a prominent test time, right?\n\n193\n00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.830\nAs an exam administrator,\nI was not informed of the down time,\n\n194\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.160\nI just noticed it wasn't available.\n\n195\n00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.544\nI wasn't sure when it's gonna come back.\n\n196\n00:09:27.544 --> 00:09:29.483\n&gt;&gt; Was this planned maintenance or\nit was just-\n\n197\n00:09:29.483 --> 00:09:31.679\n&gt;&gt; It was unplanned.\n\n198\n00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:32.412\nIt was unplanned.\n\n199\n00:09:32.412 --> 00:09:33.920\nAnd I know, stuff happens.\n\n200\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.250\nI'm not mad at them.\n\n201\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.330\nBecause things happen.\n\n202\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.060\nBut I was in the dark,\nall through the weekend.\n\n203\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.800\nAnd I got exam takers asking me, right?\n\n204\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.230\nI have customers asking me,\nso when can I take the exam?\n\n205\n00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.220\nI was all ready to take it,\nand I can't take it.\n\n206\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.460\nWhat am I gonna be doing?\n\n207\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.690\nPlease advise.\n\n208\n00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.360\nAnd all I could say is,\nI'm sorry, I don't know, right?\n\n209\n00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.600\nThe lesson learned turned out to be,\n\n210\n00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.810\nis that there was just\na lack of communication.\n\n211\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.330\nThey did have an outage.\n\n212\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.650\nThey simple had an outage.\n\n213\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.700\nProbably they could have been better\nat communicating that, right?\n\n214\n00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.430\nSo they affected my\nbusiness to some extent.\n\n215\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.000\nThey certainly affected\nthe reputation a little bit.\n\n216\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.700\nI blame them, they blame their supplier,\nblame, blame, blame.\n\n217\n00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.350\nThat's not solving the problems.\n\n218\n00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:22.340\nSo as you consider your supplier landscape\nand the numbers of suppliers you have,\n\n219\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.865\nthink about what would happen\nif a supplier under-performs?\n\n220\n00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.790\nYou as a service provider,\nare on-point for providing the service.\n\n221\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.210\nYou can't go to your customer and\njust throw the supplier under the bus.\n\n222\n00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.380\nThat really is unacceptable\nto the customer.\n\n223\n00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.370\nYou are the one providing the service.\n\n224\n00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.810\nYou're relying on suppliers.\n\n225\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.440\nSo what is the protection of the business?\n\n226\n00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.998\nWhat measures you put in place,\n\n227\n00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:45.835\nto make sure the business\ncontinuity is in place, right?\n\n228\n00:10:45.835 --> 00:10:48.380\nOf course, you need to be aligned.\n\n229\n00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.660\nMaking sure that you have alignment,\n\n230\n00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.190\nthat will align with the appropriate\ntargets, measurable targets.\n\n231\n00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.830\nAnd then do we have breaches of service?\n\n232\n00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.150\nWhat do those look like?\n\n233\n00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.210\nDo they regularly fail?\n\n234\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.913\nIs it it only every now and then?\n\n235\n00:11:01.913 --> 00:11:05.080\nEtc.\nAnd of course ownership and awareness.\n\n236\n00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.240\nWho owns this contract?\n\n237\n00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.240\nWho owns the supplier, all right?\n\n238\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.430\nWho's accountable for\nwhen they perform well?\n\n239\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.560\nWho's accountable for\nwhen they perform poorly?\n\n240\n00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.610\nEtc.\n\n241\n00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.050\nSo making sure your supplier\nmanagement process covers these bases.\n\n242\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.580\nYou got the business covered.\n\n243\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.490\nYou got the measurable targets covered.\n\n244\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.940\nYou understand how breeches are managed.\n\n245\n00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.650\nAnd you understand who's on point for\naddressing performance issues,\n\n246\n00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.120\nwhether good or bad, okay?\n\n247\n00:11:32.105 --> 00:11:35.510\nAnd remember a challenge is a risk\nthat has a 100% chance of happening.\n\n248\n00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.910\nYou see the house of cards here.\n\n249\n00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.770\nUnderstanding that you need to change.\n\n250\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.340\nYou have the supplier contract today,\nit's been serving you well.\n\n251\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.190\nBut the business is moving, right?\n\n252\n00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.680\nAgain using that example of learning\nmanagement conversion of Power points,\n\n253\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.330\nto e-learning.\n\n254\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.550\nThe demand was huge.\n\n255\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:01.540\nWe had a huge contract with a third-party\nsupplier to manage that conversion for us.\n\n256\n00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.580\nAnd they were expecting honestly,\nto have lots of demand, right?\n\n257\n00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.270\nAnd they did for a year.\n\n258\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.980\nThey did for a year and a half.\n\n259\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.330\nThey were expecting high volume, so\nthe margins of profit were lower.\n\n260\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.587\nWell when we started to feeding\nthem one at a time, piece work,\n\n261\n00:12:16.587 --> 00:12:19.210\nit wasn't really viable for them anymore.\n\n262\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.760\nSo they stopped paying attention to us,\nright.\n\n263\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.530\nTo get $50 for this one thing this week,\nbecame a non-starter for them.\n\n264\n00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.050\nWhen they were bringing in $5,000,\na week they liked it, right?\n\n265\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.842\nSo the suppliers attitude changed,\nbecause our volume changed.\n\n266\n00:12:33.842 --> 00:12:35.570\nIt would have been a great relationship.\n\n267\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:40.510\nSo continuity of supplier relationship's\ngonna be pretty important,\n\n268\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.556\nas you consider these things.\n\n269\n00:12:41.556 --> 00:12:44.805\nI mean, they were still on the hook to\ndeliver, they just didn't care as much.\n\n270\n00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.915\nAnd if they lost the contract,\nthey didn't care as much.\n\n271\n00:12:46.915 --> 00:12:49.335\nBecause the volume wasn't there, right?\n\n272\n00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:52.135\nSo again, different ways and\ndifferent dynamics in play.\n\n273\n00:12:52.135 --> 00:12:54.325\nBut it's a moving target, right?\n\n274\n00:12:54.325 --> 00:12:57.395\nIt's not static in many cases, right?\n\n275\n00:12:58.425 --> 00:13:03.165\nSo understanding the challenges of\ncontinuity, legalities, the personality,\n\n276\n00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:06.530\nthe trust issues,\nis all a big part of this, right?\n\n277\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.360\nSo the way to minimize\nthe effect of these challenges.\n\n278\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.890\nA very good contract.\n\n279\n00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.665\nClear roles and responsibilities.\n\n280\n00:13:13.665 --> 00:13:17.610\nWell-supporting processes,\nthey have good processes,\n\n281\n00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.278\nyou have good processes and\nthey interact well, right?\n\n282\n00:13:21.278 --> 00:13:25.750\nAnd then perhaps,\nhave some selection criteria in place that\n\n283\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.290\nhelps you get the wheat from the chaff,\na bit more effectively.\n\n284\n00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.640\nAre they certified?\n\n285\n00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.495\nDo they follow these\nparticular guidelines?\n\n286\n00:13:31.495 --> 00:13:36.740\nAnd you see some standards,\nISO 9000 or ISO 20000.\n\n287\n00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:42.050\nSure you could look at ISO standards as\none method of improvement, your selection.\n\n288\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.060\nYou could look at any numbers of criteria.\n\n289\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.443\nIf you say, we're gonna select\nsuppliers that can do x or can do y,\n\n290\n00:13:48.443 --> 00:13:50.573\nand have a track record, okay?\n\n291\n00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:55.920\nAll right, the risks,\nyou don't have good policy to back you up.\n\n292\n00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.380\nYou don't have management behind you.\n\n293\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.116\nAnd policy is a great way to\nshow that backing, right?\n\n294\n00:14:01.116 --> 00:14:03.195\nYou have poorly-written contracts.\n\n295\n00:14:03.195 --> 00:14:05.830\nYou have too many suppliers, right?\n\n296\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.400\nYou have a mismatch in culture,\nwhere that supplier is kind of rogue,\n\n297\n00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.580\ndoes things on the fly.\n\n298\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.060\nYou're very structured,\nand very predictable.\n\n299\n00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.230\nThey prefer more cowboy organization,\nor vice versa.\n\n300\n00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.730\nYou're a cowboy kind of organization,\nexpects real responsiveness and\n\n301\n00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.310\nthey're slow and methodical,\nexpecting great quality, right?\n\n302\n00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.050\nMismatch in culture could play\nout on that as well, right?\n\n303\n00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.940\nYou don't have good processes inside.\n\n304\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.980\nYour corporate financial\nprocesses pay them late, right.\n\n305\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.580\nOr pay them the wrong amount.\n\n306\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.440\nBecause you don't have\nyour ducks in a row.\n\n307\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.440\nI've been on the bad side of\nthat kind of relationship\n\n308\n00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.060\na couple times in managing suppliers,\nwhere I'm demanding more performance and\n\n309\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.514\nthey say, well how about paying us?\n\n310\n00:14:47.514 --> 00:14:49.030\nRight, [LAUGH] that sort of thing.\n\n311\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.229\nNot a great place to be, right?\n\n312\n00:14:51.229 --> 00:14:54.673\nSo you are trying to manage these\nrisks in supplier management,\n\n313\n00:14:54.673 --> 00:14:56.320\nyou're gonna face these things.\n\n314\n00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.733\nHopefully they're easily mitigated.\n\n315\n00:14:57.733 --> 00:15:05.100\nHopefully they don't manifest\nthemselves in daily pain, all right?\n\n316\n00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.730\nAs we've talked about before,\neach process, you'd have an owner.\n\n317\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.450\nSupplier management is no different.\n\n318\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.840\nOne of the first steps, in determining\nwhat your supplier management\n\n319\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.560\nprocess is gonna be,\nis defining a process owner.\n\n320\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.870\nAnd of course, having a day-to-day\nmanagement of the process,\n\n321\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.469\nis gonna be done and\nexecuted through a role called,\n\n322\n00:15:23.469 --> 00:15:26.260\nthe supplier management process manager,\nall right?\n\n323\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.337\nPretty straightforward, all right.\n\n324\n00:15:29.337 --> 00:15:34.620\nSo that's supplier management,\na good dose of information there.\n\n325\n00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.945\nThere is some self studies,\nsome good exercises for you.\n\n326\n00:15:36.945 --> 00:15:40.230\nIt's a brief one there, it takes about 20\nminutes, related to supplier management.\n\n327\n00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.420\nAgain it's available for download,\nup here in the upper right hand corner,\n\n328\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.796\nit's called show files.\n\n329\n00:15:44.796 --> 00:15:46.674\nPlease dig in to that self study, and\n\n330\n00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:49.712\nreach out into the form if you\nhave any questions or issues.\n\n331\n00:15:49.712 --> 00:15:51.410\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Terry for joining us.\n\n332\n00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.334\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for being here as well.\n\n333\n00:15:53.334 --> 00:15:56.596\nBut stay tuned, we're not quite\nfinished here with our ITIL shows.\n\n334\n00:15:56.596 --> 00:15:58.210\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n335\n00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.125\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n336\n00:16:00.125 -->

and\n\n6\n00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.390\nAgreement series\n&gt;&gt; I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.600\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look at\nFinancial Management for our IT Services.\n\n8\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.371\nAnd with us today back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.260\nThank you for joining us today Terry.\n\n10\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.350\n&gt;&gt; Happy to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.270\nAnd some good news about\nthis particular topic.\n\n12\n00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.760\nWe don't scratch the surface much deeper\n\n13\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.210\nthan we've scratch in\nthe foundation course.\n\n14\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.640\nFinancial Management for IT Services\nis a necessary evil, obviously.\n\n15\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.630\n&gt;&gt; You gotta manage the money, but\nITIL does not position itself as a best\n\n16\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.450\npractice for financial management, so\nthey don't go that deeply into this topic.\n\n17\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.250\nSo we're going to scratch the surface a\nlittle deeper, but not so much deeper and\n\n18\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.830\nI think you'll find that it's fairly easy\nto pick up on some basic principles of\n\n19\n00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.040\nfinancial management as relates to\nthe provisioning of IT services.\n\n20\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.450\nIt's a course relevant to this\nthing called service offerings and\n\n21\n00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.360\nagreements because what you're trying to\ndo when you are offering services is offer\n\n22\n00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.160\nthem at the right price.\n\n23\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.790\nSo financial management is helping you\non that cost provisioning piece, and\n\n24\n00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.290\nit allows you to compare to cost of the\nservice to the value they're describing.\n\n25\n00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.910\nSo let's have a look here\nat some of the slides.\n\n26\n00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.450\nFirst of all, Financial Management\nis a couple of different things.\n\n27\n00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.060\nIt's the enterprise financial\nmanagement piece at the high level.\n\n28\n00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.850\nAnd it's also at the lower level on\nhow it applies to particular services.\n\n29\n00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.250\nSo it operates at the macro\nlevel as well as the micro level\n\n30\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.344\nas it relates to IT services\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll have a look at this\n\n31\n00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:45.093\nas we go through, but\nit kind of sets the stage for these.\n\n32\n00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:49.788\nEffectively, what financial management\nservices is trying to do is to make sure\n\n33\n00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:52.557\nthe appropriate level\nof funding is obtained.\n\n34\n00:01:52.557 --> 00:01:57.790\nAnd to make sure that the services that\nare being delivered are rightly funded.\n\n35\n00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.930\nAnd by rightly,\nthat means we don't want to overspend, and\n\n36\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.140\nof course we don't want\nto under spend either.\n\n37\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.400\nSo a big part of this is going to be\nrelying on the value proposition,\n\n38\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.160\nnot just the cost proposition of\nbringing those two things together.\n\n39\n00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.099\nFinancial management obviously enabling\nthe cost side of that discussion.\n\n40\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.380\nAnd of course you don't want to\nunder-commit on the resources and\n\n41\n00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.290\nfunds, you don't want to over-commit\non the resources of funds.\n\n42\n00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.440\nSo getting that right balance is really\nwhat financial management is about.\n\n43\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.320\n&gt;&gt; I've seen some little cartoon clips and\n\n44\n00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.800\njokes about those kind of financial\ndiscrepancies where you go to your\n\n45\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.590\nproject manager or the PMO office,\nwhoever that sponsor was.\n\n46\n00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.290\nWhoever you're submitting this\ninformation to and you say hey,\n\n47\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.000\nlook I finished on time, under budget, and\n\n48\n00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.650\nthey're just looking at you and\nthinking okay well something's wrong here.\n\n49\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.150\nOkay, did you sacrifice the quality or\nI've given you too much time,\n\n50\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.824\nI've given you too much budget.\n\n51\n00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:56.659\nIt's kind of a joke but it really does\nmakes sense because using some of\n\n52\n00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.977\nthat background knowledge in\nyour experience to foresee and\n\n53\n00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:02.080\nkind of plan out is pretty important.\n\n54\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.120\n&gt;&gt; Totally agree.\n\n55\n00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.470\nAnd as you mentioned projects I think\nanother thing from my own basis of\n\n56\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.670\nexperience and again financial management\nis trying to fix this kind of dysfunction.\n\n57\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.870\nIs I've seen were projects were\npotentially appropriately funded right.\n\n58\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.660\nThey got the fundings for\nthat fixed set of time and deliverables.\n\n59\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.530\nI've seen that done at\na very mature level and yet\n\n60\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.420\nsee it fall over once the service\nis actually operating.\n\n61\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.030\nThere wasn't enough money to buy\nthe new licences or to pass out the new\n\n62\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.310\nheadsets or those kinds of things,\nto deliver the solution on time and\n\n63\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.320\non budget but they weren't quite ready for\nprime time operationally.\n\n64\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.200\nHow do we get these licences renewed?\n\n65\n00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.710\nWhat, there's an upgrade\nwe have to pay for?\n\n66\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.568\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we got project scope,\n\n67\n00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:46.370\nwhich is definitely important and\ncertainly part of financial management.\n\n68\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.670\nBut also,\nwhen you heard about service delivery,\n\n69\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.810\nyou're talking about on going\noperational funds as well.\n\n70\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.820\nSo I've often seen,\n\n71\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.460\nagain, my own experience where the project\nwas done very well on time, on budget.\n\n72\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.490\nBut them we were found lacking of\nfunds when it came to some critical\n\n73\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.220\ninvestment for\nongoing maintenance and support.\n\n74\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.400\nSo getting that right also key too.\n\n75\n00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.144\nSo, Financial Management for\nIT services needs to be there for\n\n76\n00:04:11.144 --> 00:04:12.780\nall this type of scope.\n\n77\n00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.650\nProject scope, operational scope, design,\ntransitions and all of the above.\n\n78\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.109\nSo effectively what Financial Management\nfor IT services trying to do as with\n\n79\n00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:28.637\nthese other processes is to come up with\na methodical way to do this well and\n\n80\n00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:30.420\npredictably, right?\n\n81\n00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.979\nSo as relates to financial management\nyou wanna be to create a framework so\n\n82\n00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.516\nthat you can track and\ncommunicate the cost of a service.\n\n83\n00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:41.840\nEven that sounds kinda easy,\nas a bullet statement, but\n\n84\n00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.150\nit's not that easy to actually figure out,\nI mean what is the cost of an incident?\n\n85\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.090\nIf one service has a thousand incidents\na week, and another service has four,\n\n86\n00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.760\nwhich one of those services costs more\nas it related to incidents, right?\n\n87\n00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.720\nSo, again it can be a complex\nquestion to answer.\n\n88\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.700\nBut finance management as a process\nis trying to make these answers\n\n89\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.900\nmore readily available, more readily and\npredictably available, right?\n\n90\n00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.700\nSo you can inform decision making, right?\n\n91\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.690\nYou're providing the right level of\nfunding, not the wrong level of funding.\n\n92\n00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.860\nThe counterbalance to,\nare we sure we have enough money?\n\n93\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.990\nWell let's just throw some more money\nat it is not a good answer, right?\n\n94\n00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.080\nAnd probably not very acceptable for\nyour CFO.\n\n95\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.040\nOf course after you've decided to spend or\ninvest,\n\n96\n00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.340\nit's accounting for\nthe actual money being spent.\n\n97\n00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.490\nMaking sure people are paid,\nmaking sure value is created.\n\n98\n00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.210\nMaking sure that the service\nis actually working and\n\n99\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.590\ndelivering as appropriate, right?\n\n100\n00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.980\nSo coming up with this framework through\nthe financial management process\n\n101\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.690\nIs the objective.\n\n102\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.040\nYou may remember these\nfrom the foundation.\n\n103\n00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.560\nAgain, not scratching\nthe surface any deeper.\n\n104\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.390\nAccount I call the ABCs,\na little bit different order here, but\n\n105\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.520\nthe ABCs of financial management.\n\n106\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.151\nAccounting, budgeting, and charging.\n\n107\n00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:06.491\nCherokee, what's the difference\nbetween accounting and budgeting?\n\n108\n00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:09.667\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n109\n00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.276\n&gt;&gt; First of all,\ndo you balance your checkbook?\n\n110\n00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:11.992\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:13.546\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n112\n00:06:13.546 --> 00:06:16.950\nkind of have a cop out here and\nfrom the IT perspective,\n\n113\n00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.280\naccounting is essentially logging,\nkind of like auditing.\n\n114\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.040\nSo budgeting would be in\nmy mind pre-planning,\n\n115\n00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.250\nwhereas accounting would be looking at\nthat historical data after the fact.\n\n116\n00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.860\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n117\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay!\n&gt;&gt; Budgeting is predictive,\n\n118\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.520\nwhat you expect to spend.\n\n119\n00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.000\nAccounting is actuals, what did we spend?\n\n120\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.499\nSo financial management needs to\nenable both of these activities.\n\n121\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.070\nEnable effective budgeting, and\nenable effective accounting.\n\n122\n00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.037\nNow, charging for\nan internal service provider,\n\n123\n00:06:48.037 --> 00:06:52.039\nif I'm the IT department,\nworking at an IT department of a company,\n\n124\n00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.353\nyou might not actually charge\nyour customers formally.\n\n125\n00:06:55.353 --> 00:06:57.386\nYou don't have an accounts receivable for\n\n126\n00:06:57.386 --> 00:07:00.220\nthose people using your email\nservice inside the company.\n\n127\n00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.150\nSo charging is actually considered in\nsome environments and optional activity.\n\n128\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.200\nYou don't necessarily have to formally\ncreate charging mechanisms, right?\n\n129\n00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.870\nYou will have budgeting,\nyou will have accounting.\n\n130\n00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.180\nAnd if you're an external service\nprovider trying to make money,\n\n131\n00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.764\nthen you're gonna to come up with a way\nto charge people and get money from them.\n\n132\n00:07:19.764 --> 00:07:23.530\nSo, accounting is the actual spend,\n\n133\n00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:29.260\nbudgeting is the projected spend, and\ncharging is the ability to recoup money\n\n134\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.260\nas appropriate to the service provider,\nall right?\n\n135\n00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260\nThe note you see here if you\nlook at the full screen.\n\n136\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.970\nThe note you see here, it's kinda small\nbut basically, keep in mind that financial\n\n137\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:46.236\nmanagement is a subset of corporate\nmanagement, financial management that is.\n\n138\n00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:52.305\nIt's not that IT tells finance how they're\ngoing to do it, it's the other way around.\n\n139\n00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:56.553\nThe finance department tells IT how\nthey're supposed to manage their budgets\n\n140\n00:07:56.553 --> 00:07:57.850\nand their accounting.\n\n141\n00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.029\nThat's gonna be a corporate decision\nRight, with corporate governance.\n\n142\n00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:07.747\nWhat Financial Management for IT services\nadds is the new ones in specificity for\n\n143\n00:08:07.747 --> 00:08:11.279\nmanaging the finances of IT services,\nright, so\n\n144\n00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:14.100\nit's getting a bit more specific.\n\n145\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.680\nBut the broad strokes of policy and\nprocedure for accounting and\n\n146\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.090\nbudgeting are gonna be defined\nby the corporate finance engine.\n\n147\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.185\nNot by the IT finance agent, okay.\n\n148\n00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:28.874\nAll right, why, why manage finances?\n\n149\n00:08:28.874 --> 00:08:30.348\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:08:30.348 --> 00:08:31.010\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n151\n00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.988\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's how I feel\nin my personal life, right?\n\n152\n00:08:32.988 --> 00:08:35.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just kidding, bad advice.\n\n153\n00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:36.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, bad advice.\n\n154\n00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.080\nI mean again, why do this?\n\n155\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.060\nThe value of the business is you\nunderstand what it costs, right?\n\n156\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.850\nYou have a cost basis at this discussion\n\n157\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.160\nof whether you should\nbring a service to life.\n\n158\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.850\nYou could say well,\nwhat's the project going to cost?\n\n159\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.380\nThat's one thing.\n\n160\n00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.120\nWhat's the operations gonna cost?\n\n161\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.190\nThat's another.\n\n162\n00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:59.730\nSo be able to understand the value\nproposition, as it relates to cost, is\n\n163\n00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.180\nwhat financial management for IT services\nis trying to give back to the business.\n\n164\n00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.127\nYou're spending the right amount of money,\nenhancing the decision making process,\n\n165\n00:09:09.127 --> 00:09:11.159\nand you're not spending too much or\n\n166\n00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:15.038\ntoo little based on the value\nproposition being presented, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:15.038 --> 00:09:16.941\nPretty straight forward.\n\n168\n00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:21.840\nOf course having governance back you\nup in finance is important, right?\n\n169\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.110\nThou shalt have a budget, thou shalt\nnot overspend kind of policies, right?\n\n170\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.030\nIf you need to spend more than what\nyour budgeted, what's the process for\n\n171\n00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.690\nexception handling, right?\n\n172\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.160\nPolicies guide that, right?\n\n173\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.950\nPolicies decide how this\nparticular process could be back\n\n174\n00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.590\nthrough appropriate behaviors\nthought out the organization, right?\n\n175\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.416\nIs it okay?\nI once had a grant of authority,\n\n176\n00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:48.530\nsounds like it was really big.\n\n177\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.820\nMy particular role or\n\n178\n00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.995\nmy rank in the organization,\nthey call it a grant of authority.\n\n179\n00:09:53.995 --> 00:09:58.470\nWhat I was allowed to approve,\nwithout getting anyone's permission.\n\n180\n00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.330\nAnd I could approve up to $50,\n000 worth of spend.\n\n181\n00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.018\nMy boss, on the other hand, he thought\nthat would should be like $1,500.\n\n182\n00:10:06.018 --> 00:10:08.643\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, a little bit different.\n\n183\n00:10:08.643 --> 00:10:14.072\nSo by policy it said they provided the big\npicture things further down the stream,\n\n184\n00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:18.410\nthat that was kinda redefined,\nit didn't quite have that type.\n\n185\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.900\n&gt;&gt; Maybe even defining who you go\nto submit those approval forms to-\n\n186\n00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.640\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n187\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.270\nWho has the ability to approve what level\nof spending for what type of activity.\n\n188\n00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.320\nExactly right.\n\n189\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.835\nSo for instance I had a training budget,\nthat I controlled,\n\n190\n00:10:33.835 --> 00:10:38.088\nthat allowed me to spend quiet\na bit more than $50,000 a year.\n\n191\n00:10:38.088 --> 00:10:42.270\nNot just on myself, but for\nthe people I manage, I had 25 people.\n\n192\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:47.410\nSo I had enough budget, basically $2,000\nper person is what that turned out to be,\n\n193\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.620\nthat I could spend on my people each year.\n\n194\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.828\nSo, again, policy was driving that, and\nthen I operated within those constraints.\n\n195\n00:10:55.828 --> 00:10:59.955\nI had a budget for it, and\nof course it was accounted for as well,\n\n196\n00:10:59.955 --> 00:11:02.570\nthrough our processes, okay.\n\n197\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.580\nAll right, so\nwhere does funding comes from?\n\n198\n00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.726\nGood points here, and things to\nconsider about how principles and\n\n199\n00:11:08.726 --> 00:11:10.406\nfinancial management might work.\n\n200\n00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:15.264\nFor an internal service provider,\nif I work for an IT organization,\n\n201\n00:11:15.264 --> 00:11:19.956\nwithin a company framework,\nthen I am probably just being funding\n\n202\n00:11:19.956 --> 00:11:24.710\nthrough a budgeting process and\nreconciliation process.\n\n203\n00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.505\nIf I am selling IT services on the other\nhand, I mean what's the funding model for\n\n204\n00:11:29.505 --> 00:11:30.350\nAmazon.com?\n\n205\n00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.920\nHow do they get paid?\n\n206\n00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.130\nI don't pay to be a member of Amazon.\n\n207\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.780\nI mean, just to log in to Amazon.com and\norder things, how do they get paid?\n\n208\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.180\nThey get paid by positioning products\non behalf of their suppliers.\n\n209\n00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.650\nThey get paid probably some residuals for\n\n210\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.490\neach thing that is sold,\nright, those sorts of things.\n\n211\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.527\nI'm not sure what their funding model is,\ntell you the truth, but\n\n212\n00:11:51.527 --> 00:11:54.308\nit is external,\nits coming from external sources, right?\n\n213\n00:11:54.308 --> 00:11:59.455\nAnd also have a high level investment\nthrough IT services internally as well.\n\n214\n00:11:59.455 --> 00:12:02.235\nSo these aren't necessarily\nmake exclusive choices.\n\n215\n00:12:02.235 --> 00:12:06.735\nThe funding for IT services\ncould come from outside sources,\n\n216\n00:12:06.735 --> 00:12:10.865\nit could come from inside sources or\nboth, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:14.888\nThe relevance of this,\nnot to much in terms of academics.\n\n218\n00:12:14.888 --> 00:12:19.220\nOn the exam,\nfunding sources is not gonna be a key\n\n219\n00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.930\nfactor of determining\na success on a given question.\n\n220\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.210\nYou just might see some examples of\nexternal funding or internal funding and\n\n221\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.270\nuse these terms.\n\n222\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.439\nExternal and internal funding, yeah,\n\n223\n00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:33.062\nas part of the description of a scenario,\nokay.\n\n224\n00:12:35.293 --> 00:12:38.379\nFunding models, so\nnot where does it come from,\n\n225\n00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:41.110\nbut what are the funding models in place?\n\n226\n00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.740\nA rolling plan funding, right?\n\n227\n00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.490\nIt's as one cycle ends,\nthe next one starts again, right?\n\n228\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.480\nSo this could be part of\nservice lifecycle funding.\n\n229\n00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.990\nAs an example,\nwhen you come up to a renewal period for\n\n230\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.100\nlicensing, you'll get your\nbudget associated for that.\n\n231\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.950\nBut you're not gonna see that in your\nbudget item until three years from now,\n\n232\n00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:02.700\nthose types of things.\n\n233\n00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.266\nSo, it's cyclical, rolling plan, and\nwe have plan for when that's gonna happen.\n\n234\n00:13:07.266 --> 00:13:11.346\nTrigger-Based plans,\nthis is where because something has\n\n235\n00:13:11.346 --> 00:13:14.470\nhappened we need to spend this money,\nright?\n\n236\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:23.260\nAs an example of trigger-based, if we\nget requests for more capacity needs,\n\n237\n00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.300\nsuch as your elastic demand management,\nthat you get through hosted solutions.\n\n238\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.340\nWhat triggers that additional money\nbeing sent to that IT server provider,\n\n239\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.610\nis an increase in demand, more service\nbeing requested, trigger-based funding.\n\n240\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.720\nZero based funding is the common\napproach for internal providers.\n\n241\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.541\nIs that you're just trying to break even,\nright?\n\n242\n00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:46.466\nYou're not trying to make\nmoney in your venture.\n\n243\n00:13:46.466 --> 00:13:51.222\nYou got a $1 million budget this year,\nyou can spend the $1 million, but\n\n244\n00:13:51.222 --> 00:13:53.764\ndon't spend a million and one, right?\n\n245\n00:13:53.764 --> 00:13:57.248\nAnd if you spend 800,000, we'll just\ncut your budget next year, right?\n\n246\n00:13:57.248 --> 00:13:58.100\nThat sort of thing.\n\n247\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.620\nSo zero based funding is trying\nto get down to break even, right?\n\n248\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:08.270\nThat's a very common approach for\ninternal IT organizations.\n\n249\n00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.660\nAgain, this knowledge at $0.25 will get\nyou a bad cup of coffee on exam day.\n\n250\n00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:19.670\nIn other words, it's not critical\nto your success on the exam.\n\n251\n00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.820\nAnd as you face these challenges\noperationally, again,\n\n252\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.210\nthis is gonna be the kind of thing\nthat's dictated, not by IT, but\n\n253\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:33.150\nby your corporate financial policies and\nprocedures, okay.\n\n254\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:38.064\nSo it's more FYI than being that relevant\nto you on the ground right away for\n\n255\n00:14:38.064 --> 00:14:40.022\noperational stuff, right?\n\n256\n00:14:40.022 --> 00:14:45.853\nWe've seen this before, principles of\nbasic concepts, making sure that the cost\n\n257\n00:14:45.853 --> 00:14:51.380\nof your service is somehow matched up to\nthe value that the services delivery.\n\n258\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.580\nSo coming up with methodologies for\nservice valuation, right?\n\n259\n00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.122\nWhat's it cost, and what's the value?\n\n260\n00:14:58.122 --> 00:15:01.758\nFinancial management for\nIT services is a process that can\n\n261\n00:15:01.758 --> 00:15:05.764\nprovide the intelligence to this,\nthe information to this, so\n\n262\n00:15:05.764 --> 00:15:09.420\nthat you can make wise decisions\nabout your investments.\n\n263\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.540\nAgain, nothing really magical about this,\nokay?\n\n264\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.650\nThere's compliance issues, again,\n\n265\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.090\ntheir corporate policies\nare going to be driving this.\n\n266\n00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.630\nBut there's also compliance issues,\n\n267\n00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:26.170\nhow are you complying with your processes,\nyour economic practices?\n\n268\n00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.630\nPublicly traded companies gave different\nrequirements than private companies.\n\n269\n00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.834\nNon-profits have a different set\nof compliance issues to deal with\n\n270\n00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:35.134\nthan for-profits, etc.\n\n271\n00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:37.456\nSo these compliance issues are part of it.\n\n272\n00:15:37.456 --> 00:15:42.420\nWhat they all have in common,\nthese different non-profits, for-profits,\n\n273\n00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.272\npublicly traded, or private,\nwhat they all have in common,\n\n274\n00:15:46.272 --> 00:15:50.990\nin terms of compliance, is that you\nneed to show some controls, right?\n\n275\n00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.515\nSo we talk about accounting,\nwe talk about budgeting,\n\n276\n00:15:54.515 --> 00:15:56.768\nthat's some ways to show control.\n\n277\n00:15:56.768 --> 00:16:01.444\nRight, so standards come in,\nSarbenes-Oxley, Cobit, other standards\n\n278\n00:16:01.444 --> 00:16:05.533\nare in place or best practices are in\nplace to show that you have some\n\n279\n00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:10.760\nsort of control over your financial\nengines, or financial factors, okay.\n\n280\n00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:16.328\nAgain, it's not a financial best practice,\nI 'til it's not, so the details or\n\n281\n00:16:16.328 --> 00:16:21.838\nthe getting down and diving deep into\nthis is not necessary, or in scope, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:25.354 --> 00:16:28.900\nWhat triggers financial management for\nIT services?\n\n283\n00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.480\nWhat triggers it?\n\n284\n00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.400\nWell, you might be\nsupporting a business case.\n\n285\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.330\nYou might be supporting a request for\nchange for a new service.\n\n286\n00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:42.230\nYou might be considering new\nregulatory requirements, or\n\n287\n00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.380\nthere's been an audit finding that\nsays that you're not in control, or\n\n288\n00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.780\nyou're simply doing monthly reporting,\nyour financial reporting cycles.\n\n289\n00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.940\nSo, this process could be in play,\nprobably just about all the time,\n\n290\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.930\nbecause most organizations are probably\nspending money just about every day.\n\n291\n00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:02.780\nEven with cycles of bill payment and\ncycles of money coming in,\n\n292\n00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.635\nthere's probably some sort of\nactivity happening on any given day.\n\n293\n00:17:05.635 --> 00:17:08.300\nAs it relates to financial management.\n\n294\n00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.255\nWhere do the inputs come from?\n\n295\n00:17:12.255 --> 00:17:16.600\nWell certainly, corporate finance\nis going to be a primary input\n\n296\n00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.700\nto financial management for IT services.\n\n297\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.580\nThey're gonna be setting a stage\nthrough policies and standards for\n\n298\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.110\nhow you should do your work.\n\n299\n00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.150\nRequest for change, we talked about that.\n\n300\n00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.370\nChanges in the portfolio.\n\n301\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.420\nYou see the generally accepted\naccounting practices,\n\n302\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.500\nthis is regulatory requirements.\n\n303\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.070\nSarbenes-Oxley could be\nthrown in here as an input.\n\n304\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.980\nSo governance factors as well as\noperational factors could be the point of\n\n305\n00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.090\ninput, and outputs,\nfinancial management for\n\n306\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.150\nIT services is going to provide\nthe service evaluations.\n\n307\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.680\nThey're going to help with\nservice investment analysis.\n\n308\n00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.330\nThey're gonna help with business\nimpact analysis, and planning.\n\n309\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:58.100\nThey're going to reduce\nvariation in predictability.\n\n310\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.510\nThey're gonna make sure they're better\nat predicting cost of services and\n\n311\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.390\ntherefore optimizing cost overtime, and\n\n312\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:10.030\nof course, coming up with your appropriate\nreports to satisfy compliance.\n\n313\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:16.010\nAre we in compliance with our regulatory\npolicy and statutory drivers?\n\n314\n00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.828\nAll right.\n\n315\n00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:26.580\nWhat doesn't money touch in IT services?\n\n316\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.320\nDoesn't everything have some sort of cost?\n\n317\n00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.215\n&gt;&gt; I always kind of fall back on that and\n\n318\n00:18:31.215 --> 00:18:33.623\nI say everything kind\nof boils down to money.\n\n319\n00:18:33.623 --> 00:18:35.587\nAm I wrong for saying that?\n\n320\n00:18:35.587 --> 00:18:37.443\nI kind of feel like that's true sometimes.\n\n321\n00:18:37.443 --> 00:18:40.380\n&gt;&gt; Well it is and in so many ways.\n\n322\n00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.180\nThere are certainly probably IT service\nproviders where money's not an object.\n\n323\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.180\nI can't imagine it but\n\n324\n00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.690\nthere may be is.There is plenty of\nfunding, it's always there Right?\n\n325\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.510\nSo they just do it, I can't imagine it\nin full life but perhaps that says.\n\n326\n00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.820\nSo your point, I think, is well taken.\n\n327\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.650\nDoesn't it usually come down\nsomehow to the control analysis or\n\n328\n00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.480\nprovision of money?\n\n329\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.753\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It probably does.\n\n330\n00:19:05.753 --> 00:19:11.004\nSo to list, what is there,\nmaybe eight or nine bullets there?\n\n331\n00:19:11.004 --> 00:19:15.150\nI'm talking about interfaces\nbetween financial management and\n\n332\n00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:21.020\nother processes within\nIT service management,\n\n333\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.740\nI think you could list all 26 processes\nbecause they all somehow cost money and\n\n334\n00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.169\nall need to be optimized and\nprovide value.\n\n335\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:35.200\nSo to come up with a finite list,\nis probably a little bit underestimating\n\n336\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.040\njust the reach of financial management,\nbecause everything has some sort of\n\n337\n00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.460\nfinancial play,bBut these are pretty\nclever, pretty unique in some regards.\n\n338\n00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.980\nInterfacing financial management\nwith your underlying CMS data.\n\n339\n00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.530\nService Asset Configuration Management Is\nthe process that\n\n340\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.620\nidentifies all your configuration items.\n\n341\n00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.220\nI've used this example before.\n\n342\n00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:03.330\nIf you could link your services,\nwhich is kind of a logical construction.\n\n343\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.150\nYou pull out of thin air what\nthe name of a service is.\n\n344\n00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.790\nIt's not a physical asset you can grab and\nhold, but\n\n345\n00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.800\nunderneath that service you have servers.\n\n346\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.830\nYou have network switches.\n\n347\n00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.165\nYou have a number of changes\nthat have happened this month.\n\n348\n00:20:19.165 --> 00:20:20.870\nA number of incidents that\nhave happened this month.\n\n349\n00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.220\nA number of outages you've had this month.\n\n350\n00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:29.560\nIf you can look at that kind of underlying\ndata, which the CMS can give you,\n\n351\n00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.110\nyou could have a way to boil\nup the cost of a service.\n\n352\n00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.692\nSo it's one thing to operate a server, to\noperate a database, to operate a network.\n\n353\n00:20:37.692 --> 00:20:40.826\nTo come up with a method\nwhere you could manage and\n\n354\n00:20:40.826 --> 00:20:45.873\nevaluate a service based on what a service\ncost would be a pretty clever trick,\n\n355\n00:20:45.873 --> 00:20:50.078\nand service asset configuration\nmanagement gives you a basis for\n\n356\n00:20:50.078 --> 00:20:54.846\nidentifying those various components\nthat are underneath the service.\n\n357\n00:20:54.846 --> 00:20:58.791\nSo you could have a chance of\nbottling that information upward.\n\n358\n00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:05.415\nBRM is gonna be there to help\nyou with the value proposition.\n\n359\n00:21:05.415 --> 00:21:10.634\nIt's a process we still have to discuss,\nbut understanding the business,\n\n360\n00:21:10.634 --> 00:21:16.030\nand what they're trying to get done is\nan important aspect of value creation.\n\n361\n00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.053\nBRM is going to be there for understanding\nhow this is valuable to the business,\n\n362\n00:21:20.053 --> 00:21:25.390\nalong with service portfolio management,\nyou'll see a little bit later in the list.\n\n363\n00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.221\nAll these things can cost money, so\nunderstanding the investment in capacity\n\n364\n00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:35.201\nmanagement, understanding the investment\nin capacity, continuity, change\n\n365\n00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:39.980\nis a point of interface for financial\nmanagement, these things cost money.\n\n366\n00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.881\nContinuous service improvement could\ninterface with financial management.\n\n367\n00:21:43.881 --> 00:21:50.190\nTo sum this topic up, in that it could\nidentify opportunities for cost savings.\n\n368\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.510\nCSI could do that or perhaps for\nadditional investment.\n\n369\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.413\nA chance to invest more money for\nmore value.\n\n370\n00:21:57.413 --> 00:22:00.559\nCSI could also boil those things up, okay?\n\n371\n00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:06.099\nInformation management,\nfinancial management,\n\n372\n00:22:06.099 --> 00:22:07.870\ndealing with dollars and cents.\n\n373\n00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.195\nCherokee asked offline a little bit\nearlier, are gonna have to do any math?\n\n374\n00:22:11.195 --> 00:22:12.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Great question,\n\n375\n00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.360\nbut obviously your information management\nsystem needs to be able to do some math.\n\n376\n00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.097\nWhat are we spending?\n\n377\n00:22:17.097 --> 00:22:20.382\nWhat is the difference between budget and\naccounting.\n\n378\n00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:24.870\nSo budget variations and\nevaluation's gonna be part of it.\n\n379\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:29.150\nInformation management is not a trivial\nmatter for any of these processes.\n\n380\n00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:33.280\nAgain, this is probably going to be a\nprocess that's governed more by corporate\n\n381\n00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.330\nsystems of information than IT\nsystems of information, but\n\n382\n00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:42.210\nyou're still gonna be driving these things\nthrough a financial management regime,\n\n383\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.440\nand finally,\ncritical success factors and KPIs.\n\n384\n00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.660\nA critical success factors for\nfinancial management for\n\n385\n00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.630\nIT services is to ensure you\nhave a framework to manage\n\n386\n00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.930\nfinancial information that's\nrelated to your IT services.\n\n387\n00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.060\nSo come up with your standards.\n\n388\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.440\nCome up with your policies.\n\n389\n00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.440\nMake sure you have regular reports.\n\n390\n00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.630\nYou can measure the success of your\nfinancial processes through those reports.\n\n391\n00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.970\nFunding.\nIs funding available to support\n\n392\n00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.160\nservice provision?\n\n393\n00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.850\nAre we spending the right amount of money?\n\n394\n00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.320\nWhat is your budget variance?\n\n395\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.360\nWhat is your predicted\nspend versus actual spend?\n\n396\n00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.100\nAre you meeting those kind of targets?\n\n397\n00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.190\nThose are kind of KPIs that could underpin\n\n398\n00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.830\nthe critical set factor\nrelated to funding.\n\n399\n00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.730\nChallenges, as we've talked about before,\n\n400\n00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:37.290\nare risk that have 100%\nchance of happening.\n\n401\n00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.650\nSo when you consider financial\nmanagement for IT services,\n\n402\n00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:46.250\nYou will face the challenge of is\nthe focus on cost of infrastructure,\n\n403\n00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.040\nor is it based on cost of services?\n\n404\n00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.250\nIt's one thing to understand that a server\ncosts so much money to provision and\n\n405\n00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.430\nthat it cost so\nmuch money to have licensing.\n\n406\n00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.600\nThat's one aspect of it, but\n\n407\n00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.370\nto boil all that information up to say,\nhow much does a service cost?\n\n408\n00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.980\nWhat did email cost you last year?\n\n409\n00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.120\nWhat did your learning management\nservice cost you last year?\n\n410\n00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.610\n&gt;&gt; That's a little more work.\n\n411\n00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.746\n&gt;&gt; A lot more complicated.\n\n412\n00:24:10.746 --> 00:24:11.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:24:11.331 --> 00:24:12.540\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you got to boil up a lot of\n\n414\n00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.340\ninformation related to that service, and\n\n415\n00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.670\nhow do you account for network\nutilization, or how do you apportion\n\n416\n00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:23.170\nthe cost of the network when email\nuses it, learning management uses it?\n\n417\n00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.180\n&gt;&gt; I think you'd have to use some kind of\nan org analysis tool, like Wireshark, and\n\n418\n00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.740\nsimply define it by protocol.\n\n419\n00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.550\nYeah, that's manual labor, yeah.\n\n420\n00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Come up with some way to do it,\nyeah, absolutely, manual labor.\n\n421\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.180\nIt's not a trivial matter.\n\n422\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:33.780\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n423\n00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.005\n&gt;&gt; So\nif you want to get service valuation,\n\n424\n00:24:36.005 --> 00:24:40.269\nyou got some homework to do because you\ngotta boil up these individual costs.\n\n425\n00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:42.986\nPerhaps a portion cost\nacross multiple services.\n\n426\n00:24:42.986 --> 00:24:49.825\nIntroduce so equitably, fairly, and\nmeaningfully, and ultimately predictably.\n\n427\n00:24:49.825 --> 00:24:53.945\nSo it's a good game play and\neven its a aspirational for\n\n428\n00:24:53.945 --> 00:24:58.423\na long period of time,\nin other words, your not quite there\n\n429\n00:24:58.423 --> 00:25:03.194\nmoving towards this target is\nvery valuable, very valuable.\n\n430\n00:25:03.194 --> 00:25:05.700\nGood, roles and responsibilities.\n\n431\n00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.465\nAs we've talked about before, we have\nprocess owners and process managers.\n\n432\n00:25:10.465 --> 00:25:15.155\nCertainly you want to get ahead of this\nthrough ownership and you wanna manage it\n\n433\n00:25:15.155 --> 00:25:19.851\non a day to day basis through a process\nmanager, as we've done with other ones.\n\n434\n00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:23.371\nSo the activities of financial management\nare gonna be executed on a day to\n\n435\n00:25:23.371 --> 00:25:23.950\nday basis.\n\n436\n00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:29.302\nYou need to have management on top\nof that, but the over all process\n\n437\n00:25:29.302 --> 00:25:35.049\nitself is to be owned and held\naccountable through process ownership.\n\n438\n00:25:35.049 --> 00:25:37.591\nThat's Financial Management for\nIT services.\n\n439\n00:25:37.591 --> 00:25:42.352\nAgain, we didn't scratch the surface much\ndeeper than we did in a foundation course.\n\n440\n00:25:42.352 --> 00:25:46.515\nTheres good little excercise here 60\nminutes worth that meaningfully called\n\n441\n00:25:46.515 --> 00:25:49.010\nFinancial Management for IT services.\n\n442\n00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.690\nSo please find that among the downloads\nwhich are available at the top right here,\n\n443\n00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:58.920\nin show files, to reinforce this\ninformation, and of course, join the forum\n\n444\n00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.020\nif you have any questions or discussion\npoints that you'd like to consider.\n\n445\n00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.240\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell it's been a long journey so far, but\n\n446\n00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.240\nwe're not quite finished yet, and next up\nwe're gonna be taking a look at that BRM,\n\n447\n00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.310\nthat Terry is mentioning.\n\n448\n00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.500\nSo I'm really excited for that, so\nladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n449\n00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.720\nLike I said, we have more information\nheaded your way, but for this show,\n\n450\n00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.620\nlet's go ahead and sign out,\nremember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n451\n00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n452\n00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.897\n&gt;&gt;

ladies and gentlemen,\nto your ITIL Service Offerings and\n\n7\n00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:16.577\nAgreements series.\n\n8\n00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:17.280\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.100\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at BRM, all right?\n\n10\n00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.780\nWe're taking a look at\nBusiness Relationship Management.\n\n11\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.600\nAnd with us today,\nin studios we have Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n12\n00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.070\nThank you for joining us, Terry.\n\n13\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.040\n&gt;&gt; As always, Cherokee, happy to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.400\nWe've been going through in previous\nepisodes very many processes.\n\n15\n00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.010\nWe've gone through seven,\nI'm sorry six up to now.\n\n16\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.820\nThis is the last in this series\nin referring to processes.\n\n17\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.420\nAnd as Cherokee said, it's called\nBusiness Relationship Management.\n\n18\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.210\nAnd it's kind of ironic that it's the last\nprocess we'll talk about because it's\n\n19\n00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.510\nprobably the first you actually\nneed to get your hands around.\n\n20\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.110\nBusiness Relationship Management is going\nto be the process that actually gets you\n\n21\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.620\nengaged with the business effectively.\n\n22\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.081\nSo if we have a look at the slides,\n\n23\n00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:01.655\nyou'll see how this plays out\nin some no uncertain terms.\n\n24\n00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:03.359\nUsing the vocabulary of ITIL,\n\n25\n00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.423\nthe main purpose of Business Relationship\nManagement is to establish and\n\n26\n00:01:07.423 --> 00:01:09.770\nmaintain the relationship, right.\n\n27\n00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.680\nNow, I think it's gonna be useful as we\nlearn this process that we considered\n\n28\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.430\nthat it's probably not an end to end\nprocess, it has a beginning and end.\n\n29\n00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.590\nIt's probably often I mean,\nit's probably just always active, right?\n\n30\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.420\n&gt;&gt; Well Terry, as we were covering\nsome of the other services,\n\n31\n00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.832\nyou were mentioning and\nreferencing this particular service.\n\n32\n00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:31.720\nS, o I could see how it's integrated and\n\n33\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.250\nnot just in one particular area but\nacross all spectrums here.\n\n34\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Good point,\nconsider portfolio management.\n\n35\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.610\nService Portfolio Management is trying\nto link services to business value.\n\n36\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.820\nA lot of the feedback that's gonna go\ninto a business case about the value of\n\n37\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.010\na service is gonna be generated by having\na relationship with the business, right?\n\n38\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.755\nSo BRM is certainly gonna be involved in\nfeeding the value chain, if you will,\n\n39\n00:01:56.755 --> 00:02:00.183\nmaking sure that everyone understands\nwhat we're trying to get done.\n\n40\n00:02:00.183 --> 00:02:02.375\nAnd when value is not being delivered,\n\n41\n00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:05.772\nBRM is on the frontlines hearing\nthose complaints, right.\n\n42\n00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:10.625\nSo it is the interface between\nthe service provider and the business or\n\n43\n00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:13.410\nthe customers, it's intended to be.\n\n44\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.480\nSo I think it's useful again to think\nabout this happening all the time.\n\n45\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.050\nI also think it's useful to think about\nthis process having many practitioners.\n\n46\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.240\nThere's not one monolithic\nBusiness Relationship Management\n\n47\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.260\nperson that does everything for\na given service.\n\n48\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.660\nWe've talked about\nthe role of service owner.\n\n49\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.180\nA service owner is someone that's gonna\nbe interacting with the business, right?\n\n50\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.680\nSo that role of service\nowner in some regards\n\n51\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.590\nis also gonna have some responsibilities\nfor business relationships.\n\n52\n00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.310\nSo again a couple tell-tale things there,\n\n53\n00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.990\nbusiness relationship\nmanagement is always active.\n\n54\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.095\nNot necessarily an end-to-end process.\n\n55\n00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:52.081\nAnd BRM is probably practised by lots\nof different people with lots of\n\n56\n00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.430\ndifferent roles.\n\n57\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.478\nSo, it's not one monolithic role\ncalled business relationship manager.\n\n58\n00:02:57.478 --> 00:03:01.565\nNow, that said,\nas you're taking an exam, you might see\n\n59\n00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:05.325\nan opportunity to distinguish BRM,\nBusiness Relationship Management\n\n60\n00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:08.315\nfrom service level management or\nservice ownership.\n\n61\n00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:11.995\nYou can certainly see distinguished\ncharacteristics between these roles and\n\n62\n00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:12.965\nprocesses.\n\n63\n00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:16.155\nBut just keep in mind that there's\nprobably gonna be lots of practitioners\n\n64\n00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:16.735\nfor BRM, right?\n\n65\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.930\nThe objectives of BRM also\nfairly straight forward.\n\n66\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.550\nWhat's the customer want?\n\n67\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.410\nAre we delivering it?\n\n68\n00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.090\nThat's in the simplest terms.\n\n69\n00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.610\nWhat do they want and are we delivering?\n\n70\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.108\nNow this idea,\nis the customer always right?\n\n71\n00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:36.660\nWell the current answer is yes.\n\n72\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.660\nBut we know that that's is\nnot a survey always true.\n\n73\n00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.510\n&gt;&gt; So interesting you bring that up.\n\n74\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.440\nI actually read a statement from a CEO\n\n75\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.930\ntoday about a particular\nbrand of leggings, Terry.\n\n76\n00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.020\nSo they have this crazy prints but\nthe company never had a return policy and\n\n77\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.030\nthey had individual consultants and\n\n78\n00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.590\nthey wouldn't accept any returns and they\nfinally got enough complaints about it.\n\n79\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.890\nThere was actually a group that\nformulated on Facebook where there was\n\n80\n00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.240\nover 26,000 users and the Better\nBusiness Bureau got involved and\n\n81\n00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.620\nthey actually had a lawsuit\nbrought against them.\n\n82\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.410\nAnd so now they're opening up\na return policy for new purchases and\n\n83\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.720\nthen they're also accepting returns\nfrom previous purchases as well.\n\n84\n00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.230\nBut in the statement from the CEO,\nhe said he wasn't going to go ahead and\n\n85\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.860\nput out a blanketed apology\nbecause he feels at this point\n\n86\n00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.940\nhis company really didn't need to do so.\n\n87\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.790\nAnd I just thought,\n\n88\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.080\nthat's kind of a tacky thing to say when\nobviously there's an issue going on and,\n\n89\n00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.460\neven if, it's just best to kind of accept\nthat constructive criticism, right?\n\n90\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.470\n&gt;&gt; Of course it is.\n\n91\n00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.090\nAnd, so to answer the question,\nis the customer always right?\n\n92\n00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.605\nI think we could certainly\nfind a circumstances were,\n\n93\n00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:55.890\nno the customer wasn't right, right?\n\n94\n00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.830\nHowever, customers are your life blood.\n\n95\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.854\nWith your internal service provider or\none selling IT services for\n\n96\n00:05:01.854 --> 00:05:04.770\nprofit, if you don't have customers\nyou're not in business or\n\n97\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.345\nif you don't have happy customers\nthey're gonna go somewhere else, right?\n\n98\n00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:10.708\n&gt;&gt; Or start a Facebook group about your-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or start a Facebook group and\n\n99\n00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:11.901\ntotally tarnish your reputation.\n\n100\n00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:13.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Good point, right?\n\n101\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.680\nSo to understand that perhaps the customer\nis not always right is fair and fine.\n\n102\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.550\nBut to understand that their perceptions\nare going to matter to you is also fine.\n\n103\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.300\nSo if they're not quite right, you're\ngonna have to manage those expectations.\n\n104\n00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.830\nSo I mean the dangers in not\nmanaging expectation are large.\n\n105\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.390\nIf they think it's going to do x and it\nonly delivers y and you've talked passed\n\n106\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.990\neach others to those requirement stages,\nthen you're gonna have a dissatisfied\n\n107\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.845\ncustomer and yet you think you've\ndelivered what you're suppose to deliver.\n\n108\n00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:46.465\nThe classic,\nwe delivered exactly what they ask for but\n\n109\n00:05:46.465 --> 00:05:48.975\nnot what they needed or\nnot what they wanted.\n\n110\n00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:49.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n111\n00:05:49.575 --> 00:05:50.145\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nSo\n\n112\n00:05:50.145 --> 00:05:52.525\nyou have yo avoid that at all cause,\nright?\n\n113\n00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:53.695\nThe best you can.\n\n114\n00:05:53.695 --> 00:05:58.645\nAnd BRN, Business Relationship Management\nis the process and the methodology for\n\n115\n00:05:58.645 --> 00:06:03.190\nwhich you try to quantify,\nqualify these expectations.\n\n116\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.490\nOkay, so the scope of BRM\n\n117\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.550\nis certainly gonna try to do it for\ninternal and external.\n\n118\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.550\nThis principles apply certainly\nInternal Service Provider of the BRM\n\n119\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.380\nprocess facing the customers is\na little different than those for\n\n120\n00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.160\nExternal Service Provider because External\nService Provider are not just trying to\n\n121\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.940\nget the customer, you're trying to\nget the customer's money, right?\n\n122\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.970\nSo that makes the relationship a little\nbit different because you're selling\n\n123\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.240\nyour services.\n\n124\n00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.100\nBut still the same principles apply and\nthat you have to be concerned about\n\n125\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.760\nwhat the requirements are and\nwhat you intend to do for\n\n126\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.370\nthem that's different,\nthen they could get elsewhere, right?\n\n127\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:51.004\nIs it cheaper, is it faster,\nis it better, etcetera, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:51.004 --> 00:06:53.822\nSo another key distinguishing\ncharacteristic here,\n\n129\n00:06:53.822 --> 00:06:56.884\nis looking in the box down below,\nis the difference between\n\n130\n00:06:56.884 --> 00:07:00.780\nBusiness Relationship Management and\nService Level Management.\n\n131\n00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.060\nWe've talked in previous episodes\nabout service level management and\n\n132\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.240\nservice level management is involved,\nyou may recall In negotiating and\n\n133\n00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.290\nagreeing with objective targets in mind,\nright?\n\n134\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.160\nSo you're promising the incidents\nwill be solved within two hours.\n\n135\n00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.880\nYou're saying that your service\nis gonna be up 99.9% of the time.\n\n136\n00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.840\nVery specific objective\nmeasurements are in place,\n\n137\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.190\nthat's what service level\nmanagement is about.\n\n138\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.930\nBRM is gonna be a little bit more on\nthe subjective side, do you like it?\n\n139\n00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.810\nHow is the utility?\n\n140\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.650\nDoes the functionality work for you?\n\n141\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.260\nAre you selling more widgets\nbecause of what we got here?\n\n142\n00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.470\nThose types of things.\n\n143\n00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.880\nSo there's a lot of salesmanship\nalmost in BRM, you're glad handing,\n\n144\n00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.360\nyou're making sure they are happy so\nthere is a little bit of that.\n\n145\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.500\nBut there's also the follow through,\nright?\n\n146\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.415\nSo Service Level Management,\nmanaging the objective,\n\n147\n00:07:49.415 --> 00:07:52.767\nBusiness Relationship Management,\nmanaging the subjective.\n\n148\n00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:54.940\nThere's a good way to distinguish\nbetween these two processes.\n\n149\n00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.977\nAnd both have interface with customers,\nall right.\n\n150\n00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:01.722\nAll right, so why do this?\n\n151\n00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:04.714\nWhy formalize your business\nrelationship management?\n\n152\n00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:05.747\nI'll give you one indication.\n\n153\n00:08:05.747 --> 00:08:09.825\nIt's not listed here as a particular\nbullet, but I worked for\n\n154\n00:08:09.825 --> 00:08:15.331\nan organisation recently that had so many\npeople interfacing with the customers.\n\n155\n00:08:15.331 --> 00:08:20.690\nThey had technical, architectural folks,\nthey had sales people,\n\n156\n00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.350\nthey had technical support\nliaisons like CSRs,\n\n157\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.150\ncustomer service representatives,\nvarious different titles in this.\n\n158\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.270\nThe customer was absolutely overwhelmed\nwith the numbers of points of\n\n159\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.240\ninterface,\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n160\n00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.138\n&gt;&gt; They had with the service provider.\n\n161\n00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:38.250\nSo BRM can help you rationalize those\npoints of interface, if nothing else.\n\n162\n00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:42.625\nAgain, I mentioned earlier that BRM is\nnot only, not an end to end to process,\n\n163\n00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:44.231\nit's going on all the time.\n\n164\n00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:46.913\nBut I also mentioned that there's\nlots of players in the game.\n\n165\n00:08:46.913 --> 00:08:51.011\nWell, formalizing your BRM process\ncan give you a chance to rationalize,\n\n166\n00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:54.327\njust where are our points of interface and\nwho's on point for\n\n167\n00:08:54.327 --> 00:08:56.900\nwhat type of interface and why?\n\n168\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.764\nIn this particular case as I just\nmentioned, the customer is actually just,\n\n169\n00:08:59.764 --> 00:09:01.270\nwhy I'm going to meetings all the time.\n\n170\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.640\nThis service provider is making me\ncrazy because I have to attend so\n\n171\n00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.480\nmany meetings and read so many emails.\n\n172\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.930\nWhen really all I want them to do is\ndeliver this service darn, gone it, right?\n\n173\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.350\n&gt;&gt; It seems like that\nwould be kind of a common,\n\n174\n00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.210\nsomething that you'd hear quite often.\n\n175\n00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.830\nBecause for\na company that I worked for before,\n\n176\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.570\nthey were seeing those types of problems,\nand so as a solution,\n\n177\n00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.580\nthere were just so many points of contact,\nthey didn't know who to contact for\n\n178\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.310\na particular issue and it was for students\non boarding to a new course, a program.\n\n179\n00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.817\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So for that particular solution, we had\n\n180\n00:09:30.817 --> 00:09:35.452\nan orientation meeting and actually just\nintroduced everyone and gave all of our\n\n181\n00:09:35.452 --> 00:09:40.311\ncredentials or not credentials, but how\nto contact us, our contact information.\n\n182\n00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:44.364\nAnd explained what we did for all those\nstudents that were starting a new course,\n\n183\n00:09:44.364 --> 00:09:46.942\njust so\nthat they felt comfortable with everyone.\n\n184\n00:09:46.942 --> 00:09:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and that's important.\n\n185\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.620\nAnd BRM would be the process that\nlines all those things up, right?\n\n186\n00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.416\nAnd gets them all in the right trough\nif you will, or the right swim lane.\n\n187\n00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:58.052\nIt might be a better way to speak to it.\n\n188\n00:09:58.052 --> 00:10:00.592\nSo I'm not suggesting that\nyou must rationalize and\n\n189\n00:10:00.592 --> 00:10:04.390\ndiminish your points of interface,\nthat's not what I'm saying.\n\n190\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.490\nI'm saying, you'd need to be aware of it,\nunderstand it and\n\n191\n00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.360\nmake sure as Cherokee has pointed out,\nthat you orient\n\n192\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.990\nyour customers appropriately to\nthe right swim lanes, at the right time.\n\n193\n00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.569\nAnd perhaps the way forward is just\nto come up with, if you're not sure,\n\n194\n00:10:17.569 --> 00:10:18.633\nstart here, right?\n\n195\n00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:22.877\nAnd then there's a person that knows how\nto do the routing of the appropriate\n\n196\n00:10:22.877 --> 00:10:25.344\nquestions at the appropriate time, okay?\n\n197\n00:10:25.344 --> 00:10:29.457\nAll right, so as you could see,\nthe activities, methods and\n\n198\n00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:33.745\ntechniques of BRM is just always\nactive as I mentioned before.\n\n199\n00:10:33.745 --> 00:10:37.410\nSo you're gonna be involved,\ndocumenting opportunities,\n\n200\n00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.020\nyou're gonna make sure that the pipeline,\nremember the service portfolio has this\n\n201\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.460\npipeline portion where you're\nconsidering new opportunities.\n\n202\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.640\nWell, BRM can you know use that\nas a point of process to say,\n\n203\n00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.200\nyes customer, we understand that,\nit's in our review stage right now, right?\n\n204\n00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.511\nWe're developing a business\ncase as we speak, right?\n\n205\n00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:57.630\nHow much do you think you're\nactually going to get out of this?\n\n206\n00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.077\nAre you gonna sell more widgets?\n\n207\n00:10:59.077 --> 00:11:03.950\nAre you going to beat\nthe regulators in an audit?\n\n208\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.560\nAre you going to make it more secure?\n\n209\n00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.830\nJust what you're trying to get done that's\ngonna help us build our business case.\n\n210\n00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:13.004\nSo you can see that BRM is gonna be\ninvolved with the customer till these\n\n211\n00:11:13.004 --> 00:11:15.140\nother processes succeed, right?\n\n212\n00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.374\nAnd while it might be\nboring in service strategy,\n\n213\n00:11:18.374 --> 00:11:23.001\nit certainly gonna be living throughout\nthe life of a service, right?\n\n214\n00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:24.766\nSo, how does it start?\n\n215\n00:11:24.766 --> 00:11:26.623\nDoes the customer come to BRM?\n\n216\n00:11:26.623 --> 00:11:28.249\nPerhaps.\n\n217\n00:11:28.249 --> 00:11:33.004\nThere could be that the start\nof any given encounter starts\n\n218\n00:11:33.004 --> 00:11:38.380\nwith the customer telling\nthe BRM interface, I need this.\n\n219\n00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.220\nOr is it the other way around?\n\n220\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.700\nBRM Manager says, hey,\nI'd like to sell you this, or\n\n221\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.110\nI think this is a good idea for you.\n\n222\n00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.260\nObviously, it depends on\nthe organization which one predominates.\n\n223\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.513\nI think in most external organizations,\nthere could be a lot of\n\n224\n00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:58.570\nsalesman proactivity sort of things,\nsales proactivity.\n\n225\n00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.128\nAs it relates to internal customers,\n\n226\n00:12:00.128 --> 00:12:02.624\nmaybe it's the other way around\nin terms of preponderance?\n\n227\n00:12:02.624 --> 00:12:06.818\nBut in any case, it doesn't really\nmatter academically speaking,\n\n228\n00:12:06.818 --> 00:12:08.928\nor even operationally speaking.\n\n229\n00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:14.043\nYou need to just use this process\ndefinition to understand how these\n\n230\n00:12:14.043 --> 00:12:19.888\ninterfaces work, whether it's incoming or\nproactively outgoing, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:22.407 --> 00:12:26.410\nSo if customers are involved,\nmake sure there's a point of contact form.\n\n232\n00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.080\nThey have an interface to do that.\n\n233\n00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.820\nIf the customers are going to get it\nstarted, where do they get that started?\n\n234\n00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.130\nSo the web form, is it a phone call,\n\n235\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:39.430\nis it a weekly meeting between\ncustomers and BRM representatives?\n\n236\n00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.170\nAll right, it could be all sorts\nof ways to get it done, okay?\n\n237\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.311\nIs it a formal process?\n\n238\n00:12:44.311 --> 00:12:49.394\nOr is it informal at first and\nthen BRM works to formalize it, right?\n\n239\n00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:55.330\nBRM as a process needs to define this\ngood gate keeping activities, okay.\n\n240\n00:12:57.293 --> 00:13:01.600\nAgain, continuing on with\nthis initiation by customers.\n\n241\n00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.009\nAre they going to use complaint system,\nright?\n\n242\n00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:10.067\nAnd that's what motivates your\nimprovements, that's kind of\n\n243\n00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:14.180\nan unfortunate thing that you want until\nthings are really sour and bad, all right?\n\n244\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.710\n&gt;&gt; Sure, kind of want to be\na little moire proactive with that.\n\n245\n00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's where SLM,\nService Level Management can help,\n\n246\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.220\ncuz it's kind of doing some\nmeasurements for you, right?\n\n247\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.180\nDo you have regular surveys?\n\n248\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.200\nAre you in front of the customer\nasking them often enough,\n\n249\n00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.210\nare we doing this right?\n\n250\n00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.440\nSo, or what could be better?\n\n251\n00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.420\nIs there an opportunity?\n\n252\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.208\nIs the forum open for feedback,\npositive and or negative?\n\n253\n00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:40.176\nSo certainly BRM is on point for\n\n254\n00:13:40.176 --> 00:13:43.812\nformalizing an approach to\nhandling those complains and\n\n255\n00:13:43.812 --> 00:13:49.203\nalso handling the compliments so that you\nget the positive feedback as well, okay.\n\n256\n00:13:51.616 --> 00:13:55.649\nAgain, as companies are,\nas customers might do, their initiation,\n\n257\n00:13:55.649 --> 00:13:58.082\nthere's various ways they could do this.\n\n258\n00:13:58.082 --> 00:14:02.162\nThey could do it electronically,\nthey could be based on the functionality.\n\n259\n00:14:02.162 --> 00:14:05.880\nThey could have a complaint with\nthe service desk because they were rude.\n\n260\n00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.300\nThey shut down the ticket.\n\n261\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:12.770\nA good friend of mine in the IT\nindustry is actually an instructor\n\n262\n00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.830\nwas really upset.\n\n263\n00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.368\nHappen to be with the training provider.\n\n264\n00:14:17.368 --> 00:14:21.726\nHe was a trainer but the lab provider and\nthey were not resolved, he basically lost\n\n265\n00:14:21.726 --> 00:14:25.834\nthe day of instruction while they were\ntroubleshooting a technical issue and\n\n266\n00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:29.938\nit turned out to be a very simple thing\nthat my friend had pointed out at the very\n\n267\n00:14:29.938 --> 00:14:32.756\nbeginning of the conversation and\nkept repeating.\n\n268\n00:14:32.756 --> 00:14:34.274\nDid you check this, did you check that.\n\n269\n00:14:34.274 --> 00:14:39.847\nAnd unfortunately, my good friend,\nin his frustration end up complaining\n\n270\n00:14:39.847 --> 00:14:45.090\nin such inappropriate ways that end\nup having to be one to apologize.\n\n271\n00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.498\nSo we have to deal with those complaints\nnow and then but that's the way it goes.\n\n272\n00:14:48.498 --> 00:14:53.591\n[LAUGH] All right, and how to speak,\nI mean are you going to formalize this\n\n273\n00:14:53.591 --> 00:14:58.436\nthrough emails, as at meetings,\nagain BRM is going to be the process\n\n274\n00:14:58.436 --> 00:15:03.473\nthat defines these points of interface and\nwhat's the best way for it.\n\n275\n00:15:03.473 --> 00:15:05.965\nIt's simple as that,\nthere is no prescriptive way.\n\n276\n00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:09.890\nIT is not saying this\nis how you must do BRM,\n\n277\n00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.940\nit's inviting you to look\nat this holistically, and\n\n278\n00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.368\nlook at it methodically so that you're\nnot just inventing the wheel every time.\n\n279\n00:15:16.368 --> 00:15:20.800\nOkay, all right.\n\n280\n00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.570\nSo what about the other way around?\n\n281\n00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.190\nThe service provider is coming to the\ncustomer saying, I got an idea for you.\n\n282\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.010\nAgain, I think you can see this in\nan aggressive sales organization.\n\n283\n00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:31.230\nThey're going to be very proactive.\n\n284\n00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.100\nHey, we can sell you this.\n\n285\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.870\nHey, could you subscribe to this one,\nor how about this one, right?\n\n286\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.172\nSo you're trying to sell things or\nupsell things, right?\n\n287\n00:15:39.172 --> 00:15:44.870\nBut in an internal service provider, it's\nprobably not quite as proactive in sales,\n\n288\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.410\nbut it still could come\nfrom the service provider.\n\n289\n00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.917\nI'll give you an example\nfrom my own experience.\n\n290\n00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:53.560\nWe had this business intelligence\nsolution, that we had developed for\n\n291\n00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.964\none of our business units.\n\n292\n00:15:54.964 --> 00:16:01.047\nAnd, the capacity of our team To serve\nother customers was considerable, yeah.\n\n293\n00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:02.257\nI'm sorry, did you have a question?\n\n294\n00:16:02.257 --> 00:16:04.739\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\n\n295\n00:16:04.739 --> 00:16:08.400\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe capacity was that we could do more.\n\n296\n00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.910\nSo we recognize this and\n\n297\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.820\nwe're sitting here, honestly we're\nthinking about job security.\n\n298\n00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.930\nWe're also thinking about\nvalue to the customers, right?\n\n299\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.308\nSo we found other customers for\nour capability.\n\n300\n00:16:20.308 --> 00:16:24.980\nWe had developed a centralized\ncapability to manage, extract,\n\n301\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.480\ntransform and load operations for data.\n\n302\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.140\nAnd we came up with some\ngreat ways to do reporting.\n\n303\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.280\nWhich is what business\nintelligence is a lot about.\n\n304\n00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:37.790\nDashboards, shiny lights, red amber\ngreen charts, all sorts of things.\n\n305\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.810\nSo since we had this capability\nwithin our team, and\n\n306\n00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.590\nwe weren't really, really busy,\nlet's sell this service.\n\n307\n00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.860\nWe got the capability,\nwe have the infrastructure.\n\n308\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.930\nWe have the people, unused capacity.\n\n309\n00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.890\nLet's find some other customers, and\nwe did within the same organization.\n\n310\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.830\nSo, in this case, it was a service\nprovider finding additional customers to\n\n311\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.090\nuse our existing services, right?\n\n312\n00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.035\nFinding a market space, okay.\n\n313\n00:17:05.952 --> 00:17:08.870\nSo how is BRM alive and well throughout\nthose stages of a life cycle?\n\n314\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:11.530\nCertainly it's gonna be there\nin service strategy, right?\n\n315\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.480\nI've talked about this being\nopen all the time, right?\n\n316\n00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.540\nBRM is everywhere, it certainly is.\n\n317\n00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.510\nIt's certainly gonna feed\nthe portfolio management discussions.\n\n318\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.280\nWhere is the value proposition?\n\n319\n00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.630\nIt can help with understanding demand,\nright?\n\n320\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.390\nBRM is this interface with the customer,\nso\n\n321\n00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.500\ndemand management can leverage\nthis interface with the customer\n\n322\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.580\nto determine what their patterns\nof business activity are, right?\n\n323\n00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:39.120\nEven come up with ways, what's\nacceptable cost models as well, right?\n\n324\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.840\nSo as it relates to service design,\nyou remember that service design\n\n325\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.470\nhas a couple of significant processes\nrelated to service offerings agreements.\n\n326\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.390\nService level management and\nservice catalogue management.\n\n327\n00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.290\nBRM can be there to work with SLM\n\n328\n00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.370\nto understand what is the value\nproposition for this customer.\n\n329\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.250\nThe customer wants 100% availability.\n\n330\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.150\nThis thing can never\ngo down type of thing.\n\n331\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.360\nOr you know what, they only work\nMonday through Friday 9 to 5, right.\n\n332\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.590\nSo BRM's gonna be understanding these\nsystem or service level requirements.\n\n333\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.240\nAnd service level management can then turn\nthose high level requirements into some\n\n334\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.170\nobjective measurements, all right?\n\n335\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.800\nAnd of course,\nas it relates to service transition.\n\n336\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.098\nWhen you're going through\nservice transition,\n\n337\n00:18:23.098 --> 00:18:25.655\nyou're gonna be testing services\nto make sure they are acceptable.\n\n338\n00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:28.423\nThat means you're going to be interfacing\nwith customers to make sure it's\n\n339\n00:18:28.423 --> 00:18:30.190\nacceptable to customers.\n\n340\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:35.440\nAs the relationship broker, BRM is\nthe process you would use to keep those\n\n341\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.790\nrelationships active and working through\nthe testing phases of service lifecycle.\n\n342\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.570\nAnd then as you consider\nservice operation,\n\n343\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.110\nof course this is where\nthe rubber meets the road.\n\n344\n00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.760\nThis is where the service is\nsupposed to be delivering value.\n\n345\n00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.780\nSo BRM can inform the service owner\nwhether the customers are satisfied and\n\n346\n00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.430\nvice versa.\n\n347\n00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:00.259\nThe customers, or the service provider\ncan feedback through BRM that\n\n348\n00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:05.640\nthey are delivering or\nnot delivering per agreed standards, okay.\n\n349\n00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.199\nOf course CSI can affect\ncontinue of service improvement,\n\n350\n00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:10.988\ncan be involved in anything.\n\n351\n00:19:10.988 --> 00:19:14.948\nIf BRM identifies a bunch of\na dissatisfied customers,\n\n352\n00:19:14.948 --> 00:19:18.077\nyou have an opportunity for improvements.\n\n353\n00:19:18.077 --> 00:19:22.701\nTaking a methodical approach to facing\nthat dissatisfaction is what CSI would be\n\n354\n00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:23.860\nabout in that case.\n\n355\n00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm just kind of going with\nthat example that you had spoke about\n\n356\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.480\nbefore with Amazon, and\nhow they have been evolving.\n\n357\n00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.160\nAnd so when they decided they\nsaw the need to go ahead and\n\n358\n00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.900\nbuild up their technical infrastructure\nto handle all those retail orders.\n\n359\n00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.484\n&gt;&gt; And they had the opportunity, they saw\nhey, we've got all this extra hardware,\n\n360\n00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:48.330\nthis extra equipment, we're paying\nall these technicians to be here.\n\n361\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.690\nWe do have some underutilized resources,\nwhy don't we rent out this space and\n\n362\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.610\nuse cloud services, like Amazon AWS?\n\n363\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.870\nAnd so then there might have been\na little period of time where they might\n\n364\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.070\nnot have had all the wrinkles ironed out.\n\n365\n00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.452\nSo, then that's where CSI comes into play.\n\n366\n00:20:06.452 --> 00:20:10.650\nSo, they might some kind of, throwing\nsome feelers out there, get feedback.\n\n367\n00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.670\nAnd then, moving forward,\nwhich I'm told they're doing as we speak.\n\n368\n00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.260\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, a very good example\nof how a service provider\n\n369\n00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.430\nlooked at their capabilities and\ntheir capacity.\n\n370\n00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.040\nTheir assets, their resources and\ntheir capabilities.\n\n371\n00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.710\nAnd says how can we\nserve customers better?\n\n372\n00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.510\nAnd there's two ways to\nanswer that question.\n\n373\n00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:32.070\nCan we bring our existing\nservices to new customers?\n\n374\n00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.950\nOr can we give our existing\ncustomers new services?\n\n375\n00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:39.093\nAnd Amazon's doing both all the time\nit seems, yeah, good point, yep.\n\n376\n00:20:39.093 --> 00:20:40.558\nSo what triggers BRM?\n\n377\n00:20:40.558 --> 00:20:44.403\nWell, as I said before it's not\nreally an end-to-end process,\n\n378\n00:20:44.403 --> 00:20:45.992\nit's active all the time.\n\n379\n00:20:45.992 --> 00:20:50.734\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't some\nkey points of interface that kinda get\n\n380\n00:20:50.734 --> 00:20:53.210\nconversations started.\n\n381\n00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.180\nIf there's a new service being initiated.\n\n382\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.520\nWhether that's coming from the customer\nside, or whether the service provider is\n\n383\n00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.210\ntrying to find new customers,\nBRM is gonna be involved there.\n\n384\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.730\nOr a major change,\nopportunities are coming about.\n\n385\n00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.530\nSo whether it's incoming or outgoing,\n\n386\n00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.190\nthe trigger is gonna be,\nhey, we need to talk, right?\n\n387\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.600\nIt really comes down to that.\n\n388\n00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.050\nIt's open all the time, and\nthat's really the important thing.\n\n389\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:19.750\nHave these avenues and these points\nof interface open and understood.\n\n390\n00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:24.020\nAnd make sure that your customer is\noriented to the right people to talk to\n\n391\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.259\nfor the right types of activities.\n\n392\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.300\nOkay, so inputs and outputs,\npretty straight forward.\n\n393\n00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.080\nWe've talked about these\nin our examples previous.\n\n394\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.040\nCustomer requirements, service strategies,\nservice portfolio, requests for\n\n395\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.460\nchange are all these potentially formal\nways to get the input side of things.\n\n396\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.080\nAnd, of course,\noutputs are gonna be satisfaction surveys,\n\n397\n00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.890\nthe actual business outcomes.\n\n398\n00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.480\nWe promised our servers would\nlet you sell more widgets.\n\n399\n00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.150\nAre you selling more widgets?\n\n400\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.380\nRight, so\nwe have that specifically defined, or\n\n401\n00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:01.878\nyou're finding it more quickly, etc, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:01.878 --> 00:22:08.750\nBRM, again, it's open all the time and\nit's everywhere.\n\n403\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.170\nThis is a good sundry list of\nwhere BRM could be involved.\n\n404\n00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.630\nIt also could be involved\nin others not listed here.\n\n405\n00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.240\nIf it affects the business,\nBRM could be at the table.\n\n406\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.050\nIt's pretty much the way\nwe should center this.\n\n407\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.450\nSo when you consider those things\nthat point to utility, and\n\n408\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.080\nthose things that point to warranty.\n\n409\n00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.450\nThe value of a service,\nBRMs gonna be at the table.\n\n410\n00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.884\nOkay, the challenge for\ninformation management and BRM.\n\n411\n00:22:36.884 --> 00:22:42.101\nThe service portfolio is managed by\nthe service portfolio management process,\n\n412\n00:22:42.101 --> 00:22:45.030\nwe've discerned that earlier.\n\n413\n00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.340\nThe customer portfolio,\n\n414\n00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.940\nthe list of all the customers,\nthat's BRMs responsibility directly.\n\n415\n00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.060\nAnd now of course,\nlinking the two would be a great trick.\n\n416\n00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.750\nSo one of the challenges of\ninformation management is\n\n417\n00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:00.750\nto use these various data sources\neffectively across the landscape.\n\n418\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.140\nSo that you have the right kind of\ninformation in front of the right people\n\n419\n00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:03.670\nat the right time.\n\n420\n00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.350\nCustomer satisfaction surveys\ndirectly in the remit of BRM.\n\n421\n00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.510\nThe service catalog, well that's\nmanaged by service catalog management.\n\n422\n00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:17.800\nBut also BRM has key inputs into that,,\nparticularly, the value statements.\n\n423\n00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.190\nWhy we are even offering the service,\nall right.\n\n424\n00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.560\nSo some critical success factors and\nkey performance indicators for\n\n425\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.660\nBRM is that you understand\nyour customer requirements.\n\n426\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.320\nAnd what outcomes are being served.\n\n427\n00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.470\nSo this is formalized, you have a way\nto understand the requirements.\n\n428\n00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.610\nAnd you also have a way to\nmeasure their outcomes.\n\n429\n00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.910\nNow this is perhaps a paradigm shift for\nlot's of IT organizations.\n\n430\n00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:48.338\nIT typically focuses on metrics that\nthey're directly in control of.\n\n431\n00:23:48.338 --> 00:23:53.209\nOur service is up, our service desk\nis responsive, those types of things.\n\n432\n00:23:53.209 --> 00:23:57.387\nAnd those are all very important,\nI'm not delimiting those in any way.\n\n433\n00:23:57.387 --> 00:24:02.968\nHowever, it would be very interesting if\nIT could also show how there services\n\n434\n00:24:02.968 --> 00:24:08.340\nactually move the needle in the positive\ndirection for the business.\n\n435\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.280\nSo if your services is promised\nthe business that they can do\n\n436\n00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.830\nsomething faster, or\nwith your heirs, right,\n\n437\n00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.690\nor with better audit capabilities.\n\n438\n00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:23.330\n&gt;&gt; Taking good metrics and\nmaintaining that information.\n\n439\n00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:27.150\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, get involved with\nthe business in this re case,\n\n440\n00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.790\nsee how your service is\nhelping them do that.\n\n441\n00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.285\nThis is gonna be a very powerful way to\nshow the value of your service as ongoing\n\n442\n00:24:33.285 --> 00:24:36.311\nis because you're talking in\nterms they really care about.\n\n443\n00:24:36.311 --> 00:24:38.235\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We have fewer audit findings.\n\n444\n00:24:38.235 --> 00:24:41.361\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Any time we can\nattach our ideas, arguments,\n\n445\n00:24:41.361 --> 00:24:44.133\nwhatever it is you're\nbringing to the table,\n\n446\n00:24:44.133 --> 00:24:48.610\ntwo of monetary dollar I found that's\njust made my argumenter point just so\n\n447\n00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.583\nmuch more persuasive, and\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n448\n00:24:50.583 --> 00:24:53.235\n&gt;&gt; As long as you put\nit in relatable terms\n\n449\n00:24:53.235 --> 00:24:54.655\n&gt;&gt; Some people when they hear IT and\n\n450\n00:24:54.655 --> 00:24:58.095\nthey start hearing the technical terms and\nthe jargon they kinda get lost in it.\n\n451\n00:24:58.095 --> 00:25:00.865\nBut when you start talking dollars,\nthat's when they pay attention.\n\n452\n00:25:00.865 --> 00:25:01.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you come to them and\n\n453\n00:25:01.765 --> 00:25:05.165\nsay, our maintainability metrics\nare really great this year.\n\n454\n00:25:05.165 --> 00:25:06.615\nMaintain ability, what's that?\n\n455\n00:25:06.615 --> 00:25:10.917\nRight, but if you turn around and says, we\nallowed you because our maintain ability\n\n456\n00:25:10.917 --> 00:25:15.159\nwhich is an important metric, because we\nwere so easy to maintain our availability\n\n457\n00:25:15.159 --> 00:25:19.537\nwas high, and because our availability is\nhigh, you sold more widgets, all right?\n\n458\n00:25:19.537 --> 00:25:20.232\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; That sort of thing.\n\n459\n00:25:20.232 --> 00:25:20.911\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n460\n00:25:20.911 --> 00:25:24.937\nyou have fewer audit findings from\nthe regulators or, you get something fat,\n\n461\n00:25:24.937 --> 00:25:26.170\nwhich right.\n\n462\n00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.150\n&gt;&gt; Which save us so\nmuch in fine or whatever.\n\n463\n00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You can usually find a way\n\n464\n00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:30.310\nrelated to money.\n\n465\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:34.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, or rework or\nlack of productivity, exactly, good point.\n\n466\n00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.370\nThat's what you're trying to get done with\nyour Business Relationship Management,\n\n467\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.740\nunderstanding those business outcomes.\n\n468\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:44.130\nThat's a critical success factor for sure,\nso it also can be just as subjective.\n\n469\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.020\nDo you like us?\n\n470\n00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.693\nMeasuring customer satisfaction.\n\n471\n00:25:46.693 --> 00:25:49.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; BRM is on the front end of this, right?\n\n472\n00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.380\nThey're there for the compliments and\nthe complaints, but\n\n473\n00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.190\nthey're also there to formalize a way\nto measure their actual satisfaction.\n\n474\n00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.760\nSo, is that done through surveys monthly,\nyearly, right?\n\n475\n00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.260\nComprehensively, every now and then.\n\n476\n00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.745\nBRM is a process that's going to define\nhow you're gonna go about doing that,\n\n477\n00:26:06.745 --> 00:26:08.480\nright?\n\n478\n00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.250\nAnd then also understand\npotential opportunities.\n\n479\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:16.145\nBRM could be on the front line of\nunderstanding not only customers\n\n480\n00:26:16.145 --> 00:26:20.777\nare version to change but\nalso there need for change, right.\n\n481\n00:26:20.777 --> 00:26:24.799\nThey need something new, something\nbetter you can be there for them for\n\n482\n00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:27.627\nthat, the BRM is gonna on the frontlines,\nokay?\n\n483\n00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:29.278\nVery good, challenges and\n\n484\n00:26:29.278 --> 00:26:33.890\nrisk remember a challenge is a risk\nthat is 100% chance of happening of.\n\n485\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.830\nSo, one of the challenges of\nBRM is if it's used only for\n\n486\n00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.400\nworking on customer satisfaction, right?\n\n487\n00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.710\nWe also need to be considering\nservice delivery, so\n\n488\n00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.400\nits one thing to look at the customer and\nensure they're happy.\n\n489\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.840\nBut you also have to understand what\nthe service provider is trying to get done\n\n490\n00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.560\ntoo, let me put this in a different way.\n\n491\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.180\nIs it possible for\na sales person to oversell something?\n\n492\n00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:01.730\nThis is one way to put it, right, so\nif you over promise, because your service\n\n493\n00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:08.030\nprovider is behind you can't deliver that\nmany things in that sort amount of time.\n\n494\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.570\nThen you're going to just end\nup disappointing the user and\n\n495\n00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:15.510\noverwork the service provider,\nso gonna be a balance there.\n\n496\n00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.500\nUnderstand your capabilities behind you\n\n497\n00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.930\nas you're facing the customer\nin front of you.\n\n498\n00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.250\nThat's certainly gonna be a challenge\nkeeping that balance right.\n\n499\n00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.610\nOf course you want to please them,\nof course you want to excite.\n\n500\n00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:29.350\nOf course you wanna progress and\nmove forward, of course you do.\n\n501\n00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:35.020\nBut you don't wanna do so,\nat the risk of quality, right?\n\n502\n00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:39.900\nLike this third bullet here underneath\nchallenges, the confusion of BRM role\n\n503\n00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.480\nin the BRM process,\nis re-enforcing this IDM merchant earlier.\n\n504\n00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.320\nDon't think of BRM, as an Indian\nprocess and also don't think of it as\n\n505\n00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.770\nthere is some monolithic, there is a role\ncalled business relationship manager and\n\n506\n00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.243\nthat's the person we go to all the time.\n\n507\n00:27:53.243 --> 00:27:58.270\nOrganisation use all of types of points\nof interface with different customers,\n\n508\n00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.340\nthey could be technical interfaces,\nthey're could be day to day operation\n\n509\n00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.920\ninterfaces, there could\nstrategic interfaces.\n\n510\n00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.930\nSo, it's likely not going to be all\nwrapped up into a single person, right?\n\n511\n00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.500\nSo think more of the process, and\n\n512\n00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.650\nthe roles will sort themselves out,\nif you think process first.\n\n513\n00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.500\nHow do we want to do this?\n\n514\n00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.680\nWhat are out points of interface, and\nare they well oiled and well understood?\n\n515\n00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.270\n&gt;&gt; So Terry here, ITProTV,\njust as you're explaining this,\n\n516\n00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.600\nI'm trying to think okay so\nwho does this at ITProTV?\n\n517\n00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.510\nAnd I can think of Angie is\nour relationship strategist,\n\n518\n00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.800\nshe helps nurture those relationships\nto bring in experts like you.\n\n519\n00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.143\nAnd then we have our, obviously customer\nsupport plays a big role into this\n\n520\n00:28:38.143 --> 00:28:40.919\ntoo because they're interfacing\ndirectly with customers.\n\n521\n00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:42.560\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n522\n00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.330\nWe have a career concierge that\ncan help people choose what\n\n523\n00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.310\nareas to really studying\ndepending on their needs.\n\n524\n00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.700\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; And then I guess even in some ways,\n\n525\n00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.420\nI'm kind of interfacing with the\nindividuals through our chat right here,\n\n526\n00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:54.962\nso yeah.\n\n527\n00:28:54.962 --> 00:28:58.090\n&gt;&gt; Not absolutely, and\nyou understand your roles and\n\n528\n00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.930\ntheir clear to your customers,\nwhich role is being used?\n\n529\n00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.240\nSo it's not monolithic.\n\n530\n00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.102\n&gt;&gt; There is a single BRM person.\n\n531\n00:29:04.102 --> 00:29:06.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nRight,but you do have ways to manage\n\n532\n00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.470\nthese points of interface, good point.\n\n533\n00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:12.920\nAll right,\nsome of the risk associated with BRM is,\n\n534\n00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:18.850\nas you look at the full screen here,\nis that BRM is related to other processes,\n\n535\n00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.900\nso good fences and good neighbors.\n\n536\n00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.910\nA clear way to describe this,\nI've put it down in previous episodes.\n\n537\n00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.060\nIs it possible for\n\n538\n00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:30.892\nyou to come into a meeting with all\nyour operational matrix nice and shiny,\n\n539\n00:29:30.892 --> 00:29:35.816\neverything is really good and\nstill have a dissatisfied customer, right.\n\n540\n00:29:35.816 --> 00:29:41.268\nSo, knowing that there could be potential\ndelta in matrix and satisfaction,\n\n541\n00:29:41.268 --> 00:29:46.472\nyour basically trying to talk about\nthe difference between BRM subjective\n\n542\n00:29:46.472 --> 00:29:51.750\nawareness, and SLMs Service Level\nManagement objective awareness.\n\n543\n00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.248\nSo make sure there's good fences and\ngood neighbors there.\n\n544\n00:29:54.248 --> 00:29:59.290\nAnd as Cherokee just pointing out about\nthe different roles here in ITProTV,\n\n545\n00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:04.080\nregarding who interfaces with customers,\nshe's bringing in talent.\n\n546\n00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.680\nYou have career concierge,\nI believe it's what you call it, yep.\n\n547\n00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.190\nAnd you have technical\nsupport staff as well.\n\n548\n00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.730\nSo different points of contact,\nwith different customers for\n\n549\n00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.090\ndifferent reasons, but\nit's clear and understood.\n\n550\n00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.660\nSo make sure those boundaries\nare understood and\n\n551\n00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.040\nthat there's always a point\nto turn if you're confused.\n\n552\n00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.540\nSo if you don't know where\nyou're supposed to turn,\n\n553\n00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.940\nwho do you call then customers say okay,\nI got this I feel comfortable, right?\n\n554\n00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.290\nAll right, so roles and\nresponsibilities, we talked about these.\n\n555\n00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:37.370\nWe have a process owner as\nwith other processes, and\n\n556\n00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:41.480\nwe also have process managers and\nprocess practitioners I wanna add.\n\n557\n00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.760\nThat could be wide spread and all around.\n\n558\n00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.200\nSo having a process owner is fundamental,\nand\n\n559\n00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.450\nit's the first thing you do if\nyou wanted to find a process,\n\n560\n00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:56.230\nis name a process owner and\nstart moving toward formalization, okay?\n\n561\n00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:01.610\nAnd of course day to day management of\nprocess is done by a process manager, and\n\n562\n00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:05.270\nagain this two roles could\nbe inside the same body,\n\n563\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.429\none person could serve both roles.\n\n564\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.940\nAll right, so there's a good exercise\nthat's suggesting here that takes about 30\n\n565\n00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.680\nminutes, it's appropriately named BRM 1,\nit's available for download.\n\n566\n00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:23.490\nJust see in your upper right hand corner,\nit's in the show files and\n\n567\n00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.530\nself study's gonna be important.\n\n568\n00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.810\nAnother aspect of self study is\ngonna be the practice exams and\n\n569\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.420\nthere's opportunities to take up on\nthose a little bit later on too.\n\n570\n00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.040\nSo enjoy your studies,\n\n571\n00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.596\nreach out in the forum if you\nhave any questions, and thanks.\n\n572\n00:31:36.596 --> 00:31:38.395\n&gt;&gt; All right ladies and gentleman,\n\n573\n00:31:38.395 --> 00:31:42.015\nyou are almost finished with our\nparticular shows here the series.\n\n574\n00:31:42.015 --> 00:31:44.475\nBut stay tune,\nwe do have another show headed your way,\n\n575\n00:31:44.475 --> 00:31:47.305\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat information and technology.\n\n576\n00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:49.145\nBut for this show,\nwe will go ahead and sign out.\n\n577\n00:31:49.145 --> 00:31:51.895\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n578\n00:31:51.895 --> 00:31:54.964\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here

thank you for\njoining us on ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:18.050\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.340\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we\ncontinue on with Sample Paper Review.\n\n9\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.458\nITIL Service Offerings and\nAgreements, this is part two.\n\n10\n00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:29.405\nAnd of course, Terry Decker will be\nbringing you guys all that information.\n\n11\n00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:30.700\nTerry, good morning to you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.134\n&gt;&gt; Good morning, happy to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:36.774\nAnd as Zach said, we're gonna be looking\nat the additional questions remaining in\n\n14\n00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:40.901\nSample Paper 1, 4 through 8, so\nwithout further ado, let's dig in.\n\n15\n00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:45.954\nIf you look here at question 4, again,\nI wanna remind you that the blue bits,\n\n16\n00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:49.264\nI'm calling the business strategy or\ndirection.\n\n17\n00:00:49.264 --> 00:00:53.153\nBut the blue bits are not the most\ncritical bits for exam success,\n\n18\n00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:55.641\nthey just provide some good background.\n\n19\n00:00:55.641 --> 00:01:00.700\nThe green bits are showing what IT's\ncurrent capabilities or constraints are.\n\n20\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.360\nThe reason why that is important is,\n\n21\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.500\nyou don't wanna solve\na problem you don't have.\n\n22\n00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.190\nSo if in the green bits they say\nsomething like you're very strong in x,\n\n23\n00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.450\nthen you wouldn't want to pick\nthe answer that says we must improve x.\n\n24\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.260\nThat's the type of thing\nthat shows up there.\n\n25\n00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.268\nIt also shows where there's good support,\nlike if you've got management behind you,\n\n26\n00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:24.683\nor the executive directors are 100%\nbehind you, and money is no object.\n\n27\n00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:27.543\nThose are a good understanding\nof the contextual\n\n28\n00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:31.039\nconstraints that the IT\norganization is operating under.\n\n29\n00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.593\nAnd then the red bits\nare the very specific requests or\n\n30\n00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.760\ndeficiencies that have been\nidentified in a scenario.\n\n31\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.350\nIt's those specific requests and\n\n32\n00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.940\ndeficiencies that your\nanswers must address.\n\n33\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.470\nSo in this particular case, the question\nitself obviously has a request.\n\n34\n00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.884\nFind the best solution to both\nthe problem currently being faced and\n\n35\n00:01:50.884 --> 00:01:53.446\nthose related to proposed expansion.\n\n36\n00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:58.033\nSo we have to fix some current issues,\nand also plan for the future.\n\n37\n00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:00.610\nSo there's certainly current and\nfuture in play here.\n\n38\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.661\nAnd as you look down in the text, there's\na concern that the additional business\n\n39\n00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:10.504\ndemand from the new stores will exacerbate\nthe service performance issues.\n\n40\n00:02:10.504 --> 00:02:12.696\nAnd if you can pronounce\nexacerbate better than I can,\n\n41\n00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:14.230\nyou're even better off on this exam.\n\n42\n00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.175\n&gt;&gt; You did a fine job,\n[LAUGH] I understood.\n\n43\n00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:20.650\n&gt;&gt; And then finally,\nit's also pointing to the future as well.\n\n44\n00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.990\nWe have some performance levels that are\nprobably on track, they may be just fine,\n\n45\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.099\nbut these services may become\nless relevant in the future.\n\n46\n00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.869\nSo this is right in the wheelhouse\nof demand management.\n\n47\n00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:33.516\nSome are performing just fine,\n\n48\n00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:36.690\nbut they may be less relevant\nas the expansion continues.\n\n49\n00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.601\nSo, that's what demand\nmanagement deals with.\n\n50\n00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:43.773\nSo certainly, we have a question here\nthat's focused on demand management.\n\n51\n00:02:43.773 --> 00:02:47.878\nSo, let's have a look at the answers,\nas you can see here, again,\n\n52\n00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:50.050\nthe color treatment makes it easy.\n\n53\n00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.562\nI've just taken the rationale and\ngiven us some colors.\n\n54\n00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:56.707\nSo the perfectly green one A,\nis the five answer,\n\n55\n00:02:56.707 --> 00:03:02.262\nthe one with all red is the distractor,\nthe one worth zero points.\n\n56\n00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:04.788\nSo again, I'm just giving some\ncolor treatments to this.\n\n57\n00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:08.165\nI'm not gonna run through the rationale,\nyou have that available for you,\n\n58\n00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:09.392\nI want you to learn from it.\n\n59\n00:03:09.392 --> 00:03:12.920\nBut I do want to point out some\ntest-taking tips as we look at these.\n\n60\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.355\nSo if you look at A, C, and D, if you look\nat these, you'll see that the first clause\n\n61\n00:03:17.355 --> 00:03:21.062\nin the sentence, the first clause,\nthey're identical basically.\n\n62\n00:03:21.062 --> 00:03:25.981\nThe service portfolio should be reviewed,\nan analysis carried out of each\n\n63\n00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:30.752\nbusiness unit's requirements, so A,\nC, and D all start off that way.\n\n64\n00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.859\nNow, that either means that\nB is the perfect answer, and\n\n65\n00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.620\nthese other ones are outliers.\n\n66\n00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.996\nOr that B is the outlier,\nand not gonna be in play.\n\n67\n00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:41.667\nIt really does kinda go that way, so\n\n68\n00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:44.864\nyou can kinda start parsing out\nthe questions that way for success.\n\n69\n00:03:44.864 --> 00:03:49.204\nNow where they distinguish themselves\na little bit is, A and D go ahead and\n\n70\n00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:52.152\ncontinue the sentence\nwith identical language.\n\n71\n00:03:52.152 --> 00:03:58.645\nBut C goes on and talks about,\nunderstand their current usage.\n\n72\n00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:02.590\nWhereas A and D deal with a good word\nthat demand management deals with,\n\n73\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.452\npatterns of business activity.\n\n74\n00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:08.260\nIt's not just how they currently work,\nit's when do they do things.\n\n75\n00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.467\nWhat users are doing what at what\ntime of day, or what time of week, or\n\n76\n00:04:12.467 --> 00:04:13.711\nwhat time of month.\n\n77\n00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.256\nDetermining those patterns\nof business activity, so\n\n78\n00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.809\nthat is right in the wheelhouse\nof demand management.\n\n79\n00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:23.130\nSo A and D are kind of shaping\nup to be the ones in play here.\n\n80\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.685\nThen you could also just take the approach\nof, go ahead and eliminate B.\n\n81\n00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:31.586\nYou had the suspicion that B\nis perhaps an outlier, that A,\n\n82\n00:04:31.586 --> 00:04:33.232\nC and D are in good shape.\n\n83\n00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:36.930\nAre there other things that\njust completely disqualify B?\n\n84\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.615\nAn analysis should be carried out\nof each business unit's patterns of\n\n85\n00:04:39.615 --> 00:04:40.440\nbusiness activity.\n\n86\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.987\nWell, they're using the PBA in there,\nthat's pretty good.\n\n87\n00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:46.860\nAnd appropriate services for each business\nunit selected from the service catalog.\n\n88\n00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.103\nWell the difference there is that\nthe service catalog is being\n\n89\n00:04:52.103 --> 00:04:56.447\ndistinguished from the service portfolio,\nwhich is mentioned in A, C and D.\n\n90\n00:04:56.447 --> 00:05:00.814\nSo is the catalog the better place to go,\nor the portfolio?\n\n91\n00:05:00.814 --> 00:05:04.393\nIt's kinda subtlety there, so maybe not\na shining bright light just yet, and\n\n92\n00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:05.815\nthey do mention the words PBA.\n\n93\n00:05:05.815 --> 00:05:07.150\nWhat about the next bullet?\n\n94\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.914\nIn conjunction with the finance\ndepartment, a revised cost\n\n95\n00:05:10.914 --> 00:05:15.509\nmodel should be introduced to allow for\nthe fluctuation in usage in cost.\n\n96\n00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.260\nThe scenario didn't point to\nanything related to cost.\n\n97\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.000\nThey were all concerned about demand,\nand what are the expected usages.\n\n98\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.426\nSo, this is starting to be\na bit of a red herring here.\n\n99\n00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:27.892\nNow, of course we're gonna be concerned\nabout cost, it would be silly for\n\n100\n00:05:27.892 --> 00:05:30.440\nus to ignore cost in\nthe full scheme of things.\n\n101\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.781\nBut as relates to this question and\nthis scenario,\n\n102\n00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:37.206\ncost wasn't even really a factor,\nso irrelevant.\n\n103\n00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:41.099\nAnd then there's also no involvement\nwith the business itself,\n\n104\n00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.303\nas we pointed out to this one as well.\n\n105\n00:05:43.303 --> 00:05:46.474\nSo it says, an analysis should be\ncarried out with a service catalog,\n\n106\n00:05:46.474 --> 00:05:47.837\nlooking at the first bullet.\n\n107\n00:05:47.837 --> 00:05:50.225\nBut not getting the business\nunits involved and\n\n108\n00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:53.873\nasking them about their usage and\ntheir patterns of business activity.\n\n109\n00:05:53.873 --> 00:05:58.370\nSo B is looking kinda smelly,\nit's certainly an outlier.\n\n110\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.803\nIt's an outlier already cuz it doesn't\nstart off the way the other ones does, and\n\n111\n00:06:01.803 --> 00:06:03.760\nit doesn't really get\nany better after that.\n\n112\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.694\nSo again, a test maker's technique is to\nshow, compare, and contrast opportunities.\n\n113\n00:06:09.694 --> 00:06:14.089\nA test taker's technique is to\nroot out those differences and\n\n114\n00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:16.888\nunderstand them and act accordingly.\n\n115\n00:06:16.888 --> 00:06:20.013\nAll right, how about moving\non to question five, then?\n\n116\n00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:21.643\nAgain, the blue, green, and\n\n117\n00:06:21.643 --> 00:06:25.860\nred here are just trying to show the\ncriticality of the particular statements.\n\n118\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.094\nThe business context, not so\nimportant, the green is the IT service\n\n119\n00:06:30.094 --> 00:06:34.335\nprovider's context, their constraints and\ntheir capabilities.\n\n120\n00:06:34.335 --> 00:06:37.330\nAnd the red, of course,\nare the specific asks,\n\n121\n00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.561\nthe specific deficiencies or\nrequests being made.\n\n122\n00:06:40.561 --> 00:06:45.357\nIf we look at those specific\nquestions being made here, it says,\n\n123\n00:06:45.357 --> 00:06:48.683\nthey have identified the key stakeholders.\n\n124\n00:06:48.683 --> 00:06:51.156\nYou can see this in about\nthe second paragraph.\n\n125\n00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:53.743\nThey have identified IT\nservice performance as one\n\n126\n00:06:53.743 --> 00:06:55.495\nof the major threats to the plant.\n\n127\n00:06:55.495 --> 00:06:58.210\nPerformance, performance,\nperformance, performance.\n\n128\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.937\nIt smells of capacity planning, usually.\n\n129\n00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:03.615\nThe CIO has been under\npressure from the board\n\n130\n00:07:03.615 --> 00:07:06.868\ndue to poor IT performance\nin the previous six months.\n\n131\n00:07:06.868 --> 00:07:10.537\nThe chief concern has been significant\nperformance variations and\n\n132\n00:07:10.537 --> 00:07:15.375\nnetwork connectivity and communications\nperformance, performance, performance.\n\n133\n00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:20.530\nContinuing on, it says that getting\nthe three to work together.\n\n134\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.467\nIn this case, we're talking about, it\nhas three contracts with different local\n\n135\n00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:28.365\nexternal suppliers and operating markets,\nsupporting three IT network hubs.\n\n136\n00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:31.044\nAlready, network connectivity's\nbeen highlighted as\n\n137\n00:07:31.044 --> 00:07:32.667\none of the major areas of concern.\n\n138\n00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:36.272\nAnd now we have three contractors\ninvolved in the local network hubs,\n\n139\n00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:38.116\nwith three separate contractors.\n\n140\n00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:40.918\nGetting the three to work\ntogether on incidents or\n\n141\n00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:44.800\nchanges has proved increasingly difficult,\ngot some issues here.\n\n142\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.002\nA number of outages have\nresulted in a blame culture.\n\n143\n00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:51.398\nImagine that,\nIT blaming other people for things.\n\n144\n00:07:51.398 --> 00:07:52.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they shouldn't do that [LAUGH].\n\n145\n00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:57.308\n&gt;&gt; So basically,\nhow can we get to a transparent Eyes open.\n\n146\n00:07:57.308 --> 00:08:00.106\nLet's solve the problem, let's not\nblame people, type of environment.\n\n147\n00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:04.726\nOther issues encountered at one or more\nlocations have included long-term service\n\n148\n00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:08.889\nimprovements have been sacrificed in\nfavor of short-term fixes that avoid\n\n149\n00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:11.880\nthe payment of contract\npenalties by the supplier.\n\n150\n00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.030\nSo the supplier's always just\nlooking very tactically.\n\n151\n00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.910\nChanges in ownership, of the customer\nrelationships by the suppliers.\n\n152\n00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:25.730\nSo the ongoing accountability's\nbeen shifting around, as well.\n\n153\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.260\nSo is this performance\nrelated to suppliers?\n\n154\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.210\nStarting to sound like\nsupplier management, perhaps,\n\n155\n00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.840\nis gonna be in play for this question.\n\n156\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.900\nAnd then, the specific question,\ngoing back to number five, question five.\n\n157\n00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.200\nWhen considering suppliers,\n\n158\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.270\nwhich one of the following options would\nbest ensure that the network issues\n\n159\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.380\nare addressed in order to meet the needs\nof the financial services organization?\n\n160\n00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.960\nWe've got network issues.\n\n161\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.000\nWe've got contractor issues.\n\n162\n00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.330\nAnd we have supplier management issues.\n\n163\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.310\nSounds like supply\nmanagement's gonna be in play.\n\n164\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.456\nLet's have a look.\n\n165\n00:08:56.456 --> 00:08:59.736\nSo again, what's gonna best ensure that\nnetwork issues are addressed in order to\n\n166\n00:08:59.736 --> 00:09:02.280\nmeet the needs of the financial\nservice organization?\n\n167\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.530\nTalking about some problems right now,\nwe gotta solve these problems.\n\n168\n00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.580\nAs we've done before, we can kinda look at\nthe opening statements to see if there's\n\n169\n00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.950\nany commonality.\n\n170\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.190\nAnd we can see, as we look at these,\nthat B and C are very consistent.\n\n171\n00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.730\nConsideration should be given to entering\ninto a partnership with a single supplier.\n\n172\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.310\nBecause we've got three\ncompeting against each other.\n\n173\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.190\nWhy are we dividing up that piece\nof pie for performance issues?\n\n174\n00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.346\nEspecially when it's so critical,\nsuch as network services.\n\n175\n00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:35.040\nNotice they're not making decision,\nit's a consideration that should be made.\n\n176\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.250\nThey're not deciding, decide on\na single supplier and move right now.\n\n177\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.058\nLet's consider this and\nmove forward appropriately.\n\n178\n00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:44.480\nSo they both start off the same way.\n\n179\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.490\nIf you look at the first bullet in A,\n\n180\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.020\nconsideration should be given to entering\na partnership with three local suppliers.\n\n181\n00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.760\nA partnership, a legal relationship.\n\n182\n00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.860\nWe're not talking about a new contract.\n\n183\n00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.570\nWe're talking about a legal\nrelationship between two organizations.\n\n184\n00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.700\nPartnership is often\nused among suppliers and\n\n185\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.830\nin loose terms like we're with you,\nwe wanna be partners with you.\n\n186\n00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.740\nBut that's more of a marketing spin\nthan it is a legal arrangement.\n\n187\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.141\nIn this case, ITIL is using this word\nto describe a legal arrangement.\n\n188\n00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:17.041\nAnd getting into a partnership with\na network service provider is probably not\n\n189\n00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:20.231\nin the best interest of a financial\ncompany unless they wanna get\n\n190\n00:10:20.231 --> 00:10:21.840\ninto the networking business.\n\n191\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.000\nAnd then, D, that first bullet in D.\n\n192\n00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.630\nConsideration should be given\nto recontracting with the three\n\n193\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.410\ncurrent local suppliers.\n\n194\n00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.390\nNow, that's not necessarily wrong.\n\n195\n00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.860\nYou could consider that, but\n\n196\n00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.270\nthere's no suggestion that\nthey're technically incompetent.\n\n197\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.410\nSo they all seem to be good.\n\n198\n00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.600\nBut what would you get if you\nbrought it under one supplier?\n\n199\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.170\nYou start getting it, it's more critical.\n\n200\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.413\nYou're categorizing the supplier as\nsomeone that's a little bit more higher up\n\n201\n00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:48.090\nthe food chain.\n\n202\n00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.200\nSo in the categorization scheme,\nthe supplier management must develop.\n\n203\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.290\nNetwork services is probably gonna be\nmore of a tactical and/or strategic one,\n\n204\n00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.640\nnot a commodity one or\nnot just a day to day operational one.\n\n205\n00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.740\nSo that's what were looking at for\nthis one.\n\n206\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:10.360\nSo again, at first blush,\nlooking at the first bullet statements,\n\n207\n00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.800\nB and C are kinda in consideration.\n\n208\n00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.373\nD's got some merit.\n\n209\n00:11:15.373 --> 00:11:19.475\nAnd A seems to be a little bit off the\nbeaten path because we're seeking a legal\n\n210\n00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:22.330\nrelationship and\nthat's probably going way to far.\n\n211\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.520\nAgain, looking just at the first bullet.\n\n212\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.250\nIf we look deeper through\nthe second bullet, you'll see that\n\n213\n00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.960\nA supplier management should have a single\ndefined local point of ownership.\n\n214\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.150\nNow, we're talking about what the IT\nservice provider should have in mind.\n\n215\n00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.460\nThey're gonna have\nsuppliers help them out but\n\n216\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.340\nwho's gonna be owning the relationship?\n\n217\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.620\nWe noticed in the scenario\nthat it was a changing thing.\n\n218\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.860\nIt just passed from one person to another.\n\n219\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.470\nThat was an explicit problem mentioned.\n\n220\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.381\nI'll just go back right quick.\n\n221\n00:11:51.103 --> 00:11:54.710\nAll three supplier contracts are due for\nrenewal in the next 12 months.\n\n222\n00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.810\nAnd then, we also have changes in\nownership of the customer relationship\n\n223\n00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:00.610\nby the supplier.\n\n224\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.540\nSo they're moving on\nthat side of the fence.\n\n225\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.790\nWe're moving on this side of the fence.\n\n226\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.680\nWe're doing various things.\n\n227\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.190\nSo that's got some merit,\nthe second bullet does of A.\n\n228\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.460\nSupplier management should have a single,\ndefined local point of ownership with\n\n229\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.570\nresponsibility granted for\noperational management of issues.\n\n230\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.740\nIf we compare that to the second bullet\nin B, supplier management should have\n\n231\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.269\na single, defined point of\nownership within each country.\n\n232\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.950\nAgain, if you're gonna consolidate\ncontracts which the first\n\n233\n00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.360\nbullet suggests we're gonna try to do,\nwhy would you then divide and\n\n234\n00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.400\nconquer the management of that\nwhen it's not really conquering?\n\n235\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.120\nCentralized single point of\ncontact between the supplier and\n\n236\n00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.910\nthe it service provider are in play here.\n\n237\n00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.590\nSo you see, again, compare and\ncontrast wants to go through these,\n\n238\n00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.260\nreinforcing the importance\nof categorization, and\n\n239\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.920\nreinforcing the importance\nof ownership in suppliers.\n\n240\n00:12:56.055 --> 00:12:56.932\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n241\n00:12:56.932 --> 00:12:57.716\n&gt;&gt; Very well done, sir.\n\n242\n00:12:57.716 --> 00:12:58.997\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n243\n00:12:58.997 --> 00:13:02.440\nNow, on question six.\n\n244\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.250\nWhat is the explicit ask, we jump\nright to the first of all questions.\n\n245\n00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:10.129\nWhich one of the following options will be\nensure that the primary concerns related\n\n246\n00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:13.624\nto the revisioned and\nreporting of targets are addressed?\n\n247\n00:13:13.624 --> 00:13:18.300\nSo if we look at the red bits,\nskipping to the specific ask here.\n\n248\n00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.280\nBut despite the reports of\nimproved service availability,\n\n249\n00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.760\na major service outage occurred\nduring the business week\n\n250\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.390\nof the year when over 25% of the annual\nbusiness revenue is normally earned.\n\n251\n00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.190\nSo here is an organization,\n\n252\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.430\nif you look at the green bits,\nthat provides availability.\n\n253\n00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.770\nTheir services are available\nto target standards.\n\n254\n00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:47.875\nThe serviceability target is 98.5, they\nare coming in at 98.9 on a regular basis.\n\n255\n00:13:47.875 --> 00:13:50.015\nSo at first blush you might think,\nshut up, customer.\n\n256\n00:13:50.015 --> 00:13:50.743\nEverything is just fine.\n\n257\n00:13:50.743 --> 00:13:52.269\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're doing what we're\n\n258\n00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.880\nsuppose to be doing.\n\n259\n00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.525\nWe're meeting our SLA targets just fine.\n\n260\n00:13:55.525 --> 00:14:00.565\nBut then, of course, when you read in\nthe red bits, when you read later on that\n\n261\n00:14:00.565 --> 00:14:06.735\nwhen 25% of annual business is occurs\nwithin a particular time frame and\n\n262\n00:14:06.735 --> 00:14:10.880\nyou were down significant there, you're\nobviously costing the business some money.\n\n263\n00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.320\nSo are we measuring the right things?\n\n264\n00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.790\nWhat does our availability management\nmetrics tell us if we're able to lose\n\n265\n00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.760\na critical service during\nthe bulk sales period?\n\n266\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.590\nSo we've gotta be\nmeasuring the right things.\n\n267\n00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.800\nAvailability is not a simple thing.\n\n268\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.490\nIt can be very complex and nuanced,\n\n269\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.720\ndepending on the patterns\nof business activity.\n\n270\n00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.247\nAnd who's in play at what time.\n\n271\n00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:37.680\nThe agreement is reached at the meeting\nto address two primary concerns, service\n\n272\n00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.450\navailability targets for the mission\ncritical periods are to be revised.\n\n273\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.388\nA very explicit ask here,\nrevise availability targets for\n\n274\n00:14:45.388 --> 00:14:47.365\ncritical business periods.\n\n275\n00:14:47.365 --> 00:14:50.420\n98% is not enough for that time of year.\n\n276\n00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.690\nAmend and more representative reports.\n\n277\n00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.370\nAmended and more representative business\nreports are gonna be produced so\n\n278\n00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.510\nwhen you're going into producing and\n\n279\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.150\nreporting how you're doing to\nyour customers, you need to have\n\n280\n00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:08.530\nbetter reporting, more transparency\nabout the full picture of availability.\n\n281\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.910\nSo we've got a future\ntints thing going on.\n\n282\n00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.110\nWe've gotta make sure we have good\nreports, and also we have to make sure\n\n283\n00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:20.870\nthat we have targeted measurements that\naccommodate heavy business periods.\n\n284\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.810\nThat's the specific ask.\n\n285\n00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:28.610\nSo again, as you compare and contrast,\nwhat are you gonna find here?\n\n286\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.760\nA starts off with determining what\ninformation each team can provide\n\n287\n00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.750\nregarding the collection and\nreporting of component availability.\n\n288\n00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.370\nComponent availability is important, but\n\n289\n00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.060\nremember that's only one\npart of the availability.\n\n290\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.450\nWe also have service availability.\n\n291\n00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.176\nAnd then, it's all technical stuff.\n\n292\n00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:47.441\nImplement, revise mechanisms for\nthe analysis calculation,\n\n293\n00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:51.795\nreporting of service availability, ensure\nthat event management is implemented to\n\n294\n00:15:51.795 --> 00:15:54.462\ntrigger alerts in response\nto availability issue.\n\n295\n00:15:54.462 --> 00:15:55.478\nNot patently wrong,\n\n296\n00:15:55.478 --> 00:15:58.840\nbut it´s not addressing the very\nspecific things in the question.\n\n297\n00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.390\nWhat are we gonna be measuring?\n\n298\n00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.715\nWhat's our different measurements?\n\n299\n00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:04.508\nThat's our different techniques for\ncollecting data.\n\n300\n00:16:04.508 --> 00:16:09.023\nI mean, those are good answers, but not\ndirectly related to the specifics of this\n\n301\n00:16:09.023 --> 00:16:13.606\nscenario, which had very specific things,\nwhat measurement should we have, and\n\n302\n00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:15.790\nhow are we gonna report these, right?\n\n303\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.120\nSpecifically, related to\nthe critical business periods, so.\n\n304\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.290\nI like how B starts off,\nmeet with the customer managers.\n\n305\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.710\nAll right,\nwe're getting the customer involved.\n\n306\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.000\nThere's no such thing in A, right?\n\n307\n00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.050\nC also starts off with meet\nwith customer managers.\n\n308\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:34.190\nRemember, one of the golden concepts, the\nthree golden concepts, customer, value,\n\n309\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.220\nand service?\n\n310\n00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.240\nWell the customer's in play on B and\nC, it was no where to be found in A.\n\n311\n00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.182\nWe're just looking at IT, and\ntechnology and components, right?\n\n312\n00:16:43.182 --> 00:16:46.710\nNot looking at metrics,\nnot looking at reports, right?\n\n313\n00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.040\nSo, we're not answering the question, and\nwe're diving deep into the technology,\n\n314\n00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.510\nand not focused on the customers.\n\n315\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.430\nB and C have a lot better start.\n\n316\n00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.794\nIf we look at D,\nit looks at the requirement for\n\n317\n00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:59.388\nservice availability against\nthe data collection and measurement.\n\n318\n00:16:59.388 --> 00:17:03.110\nSo the requirements for\nservice availability against collection to\n\n319\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.290\nmeasurement, well,\nit's kind of a neutral one.\n\n320\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.340\nAre we getting any more meat on that bone?\n\n321\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.230\nAnd again,\nI don't see the customer involved, right?\n\n322\n00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.180\nSo D is fading,\nbecause there's no customer involvement.\n\n323\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.040\nA is out, because it is all technical and\nnot customer.\n\n324\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.220\nB and C seem to be in play.\n\n325\n00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.280\nSo you get the idea?\n\n326\n00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.590\nI mean this is how you approach the exam.\n\n327\n00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.620\nI mean I'm not going to rehash\nthe entire rationale for this question.\n\n328\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.510\nYou have that available for you,\nbut the nature of the beast,\n\n329\n00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.430\nwhen you're taking these exams,\nis a whole lot of compare and contrast.\n\n330\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.070\nMake sure you answer the question, right?\n\n331\n00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.435\nDon´t just stay on the theoretical side of\nthings, get to the very specific requests,\n\n332\n00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:42.381\nall right?\n\n333\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Question for you, sir.\n\n334\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.310\n&gt;&gt; You bet.\n\n335\n00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:50.270\n&gt;&gt; So, would it be important\nto the golden concepts,\n\n336\n00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:55.140\ncustomer, service, value, use that as\na barometer with each of these questions?\n\n337\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.380\nWith all the questions?\n\n338\n00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:56.940\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n339\n00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n340\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.682\n&gt;&gt; Always, that's gonna be,\nperhaps that's gonna be,\n\n341\n00:18:00.682 --> 00:18:04.190\none of your simplest filters\nto run the question through.\n\n342\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.610\nIs the customer involved?\n\n343\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.620\nIs it focused on service, or\nis it more focused on technology?\n\n344\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.724\nRight, if it's just focused on,\nI mean technology is important,\n\n345\n00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:14.801\nafter all we are an IT\nservice provider here.\n\n346\n00:18:14.801 --> 00:18:18.220\nSo technology is not to be scoffed at,\nit is important.\n\n347\n00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.920\nBut if the specific ask is\nrelated to measurement, then\n\n348\n00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.800\nthe technology conversation needs to be\nabout the measurement side of the things.\n\n349\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.230\nNot about the architecture, not about\nthe application availability, etc.\n\n350\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.490\nSo yes, that will always work.\n\n351\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.020\nThe three golden concepts.\n\n352\n00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.110\nIs the customer involved?\n\n353\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.100\nAre you focused on the service,\nand not just technology?\n\n354\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.370\nAnd are you focused on the value,\nwhich is defined by the customer?\n\n355\n00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.870\nSo customer and value go so\nclosely together.\n\n356\n00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:51.280\nBut value, not for the IT organization,\nvalue for the customer, for the business.\n\n357\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.230\nYep, every time.\n\n358\n00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.040\n&gt;&gt; Very well done.\n&gt;&gt; And therefore,\n\n359\n00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.340\nyou can find some real easy ones.\n\n360\n00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.400\nSometimes you can eliminate\nthem just that easily.\n\n361\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.127\nThere might be real long questions, and\nyou can get rid of one because, whoop,\n\n362\n00:19:00.127 --> 00:19:01.930\nthere's no mention of the customer at all,\nright?\n\n363\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.018\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n364\n00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:06.150\n&gt;&gt; Good deal, all right.\n\n365\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.550\nMove on to question seven now.\n\n366\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:12.340\nSo this one, as with the other ones, can\nbe broken down into the business context,\n\n367\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:17.690\nthe service providers capabilities and\nconstraints, and the specific asks, okay.\n\n368\n00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.400\nIn this particular case,\nthere's quite a bit of red.\n\n369\n00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.980\nIn other words,\nthere's lots of things being asked.\n\n370\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.000\nThe question itself says, which one of\nthe following sequence of activities, so\n\n371\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.900\nnow we've got to get\nthem in the right order.\n\n372\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.850\nWhich one of the following sequence of\nactivities would be the best approach\n\n373\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.730\nto establishing service level\nagreements in the organization?\n\n374\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.910\nSo clearly, it's about the process\ncalled service level management.\n\n375\n00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.340\nAnd the various specific deliverable\nthat service level management has\n\n376\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.330\ncalled the service level agreement, right?\n\n377\n00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.708\nSo the fact that we're talking,\nthey're introducing a scenario here,\n\n378\n00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:50.874\nwhere they're bad SLAs as an example.\n\n379\n00:19:50.874 --> 00:19:55.408\nThere has been a history of confusion\nabout, what is required from the services,\n\n380\n00:19:55.408 --> 00:19:57.521\nand what has been actually achieved?\n\n381\n00:19:57.521 --> 00:19:59.330\nParticularly, from a warranty perspective.\n\n382\n00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.930\nNow that's relevant, because\nwarranties just happens to be things.\n\n383\n00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:08.250\nUtility is kind of harder to measure,\nutility is almost opinion, right?\n\n384\n00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:13.480\nYou can measure satisfaction with utility,\ndo you like how the application flows,\n\n385\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.230\nis it intuitive, are the colors right for\nyou, is it easy to use?\n\n386\n00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.660\nThose kind of things.\n\n387\n00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.707\nBut it's a lot more of opinion.\n\n388\n00:20:19.707 --> 00:20:25.960\nWhereas warranty, capacity, continuity,\nsecurity, and availability.\n\n389\n00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.360\nHave you had security incidents?\n\n390\n00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.170\nYou can measure those quite specifically.\n\n391\n00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.480\nWhat is your availability targets?\n\n392\n00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.760\nAre they being met?\n\n393\n00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.010\nIs there sufficient capacity?\n\n394\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.470\nThese are things that get a bit\nmore mathematical, if you will.\n\n395\n00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.090\nYou could put measurable\ntargets against warranty.\n\n396\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:46.520\nBut without warranty perspective, without\nthat being appropriately taken care of,\n\n397\n00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.000\nthere's resulted in strained relationships\nbetween the business units and\n\n398\n00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.720\nthe IT organization.\n\n399\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.700\nIn effect, what this is saying is, we\ncome with shiny green metrics every time,\n\n400\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.530\nand they don't like the service, right?\n\n401\n00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.210\nYou think our availability is good.\n\n402\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.540\nIt took me 5 days to get\nthat ticket responded to,\n\n403\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.550\nor it was out for three days or\nwhatever, that sort of thing.\n\n404\n00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.170\nSo, how does that work?\n\n405\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.670\nContinues on in the red.\n\n406\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:12.090\nAvailability targets have not been\nreviewed for the last two years.\n\n407\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.890\nWow, you're not even keeping score, right?\n\n408\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.120\nSo you have a service\nlevel management question,\n\n409\n00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.610\nbecause it's talking about the structures\nof the SLAs, and how they can improve.\n\n410\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.190\nAnd you haven't even reported on\navailability for two years, and\n\n411\n00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.810\ncustomers are complaining.\n\n412\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.427\nSo you obviously got a pretty\nclear dysfunctional aspect\n\n413\n00:21:30.427 --> 00:21:33.612\nworking out in this question, right?\n\n414\n00:21:33.612 --> 00:21:37.250\nAnd again, keeping with this last\nsentence here or the last bits.\n\n415\n00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.536\nThe IT director assure that many of the\ncurrent issues can be rectified through\n\n416\n00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:43.270\nthe implementation of\nservice level management.\n\n417\n00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.990\nIt's very good when you have the IT\ndirector saying, this is a good idea.\n\n418\n00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:51.090\nSLM is good, please go forth,\nand conquer the SLM landscape,\n\n419\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.880\nthat's really what this is, right?\n\n420\n00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.550\nSo, and therefore, directed that service\nlevel agreements be introduced for\n\n421\n00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.290\nthe service provided before\nmoving into other areas.\n\n422\n00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.956\nSo clearly, there is a direction here,\nand it's setting the context for\n\n423\n00:22:01.956 --> 00:22:03.937\nhow you're supposed to\nanswer the question, right?\n\n424\n00:22:03.937 --> 00:22:08.347\nAnd the specific ask is, go forth and\nconquer service level management,\n\n425\n00:22:08.347 --> 00:22:10.600\nthat's what we need.\n\n426\n00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.280\nYou've been asked to leave\nthe project to do that.\n\n427\n00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.340\nSo what is the appropriate\norder of steps now?\n\n428\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.863\nGetting back to the various question.\n\n429\n00:22:17.863 --> 00:22:21.570\nIf you have a blank slate,\nyou've never done SLM before, and\n\n430\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.150\nyou've been asked by the CIO,\ngo forth and conquer.\n\n431\n00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.630\nWhat steps would you take?\n\n432\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.820\nA classic question to see if you\nunderstand the purpose, and value, and\n\n433\n00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.730\nmethodologies of service level management.\n\n434\n00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:35.720\nGetting pretty close to theoretical here.\n\n435\n00:22:37.165 --> 00:22:38.240\nAgain, notice this one.\n\n436\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.470\nAnswers A, B, and D, again,\nall start with the same action.\n\n437\n00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.360\nSo can you eliminate C?\n\n438\n00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.330\nRight, it's one of these\nsame types of things, right?\n\n439\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.504\nSo in terms, that´s true.\n\n440\n00:22:50.504 --> 00:22:54.340\nA, B, and D all start with the same\naction, and it's IT focused, C that is,\n\n441\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.825\nis IT focused, it'sIT driven,\nit's not looking at the customers,\n\n442\n00:22:57.825 --> 00:23:00.027\nit's not looking at the business, right?\n\n443\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.703\nSo, we've seen that theme before,\nand is that prompt to be the answer?\n\n444\n00:23:05.703 --> 00:23:07.970\nDoes this apply to every question?\n\n445\n00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:08.720\nAbsolutely does.\n\n446\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.884\nCustomer, value, and service.\n\n447\n00:23:10.884 --> 00:23:12.630\nWe've gotta focus on those, okay?\n\n448\n00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:17.190\nAnd so, answer A,\nseems to cover all the bases.\n\n449\n00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.702\nIt covers OLAs and SOAs, and\n\n450\n00:23:18.702 --> 00:23:22.177\nmakes sure there's a link up to\nindependent contracts, right?\n\n451\n00:23:22.177 --> 00:23:25.340\nAnd agreements are formalized,\nand signed off on.\n\n452\n00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:30.310\nLater on in B, they don't get\nto the formal agreements, right?\n\n453\n00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.840\nAnd in C, it excludes IT from\nthe discussion, which is also bad.\n\n454\n00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.425\nIt's good to have a focus on the customer,\nbut\n\n455\n00:23:36.425 --> 00:23:39.955\nyou can't leave your own IT\norganization in the dark, right?\n\n456\n00:23:39.955 --> 00:23:42.232\nYou've heard the phrase,\nthe cobbler's kids have no shoes.\n\n457\n00:23:42.232 --> 00:23:43.611\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n458\n00:23:43.611 --> 00:23:45.380\nwe have to take care of ourselves, too.\n\n459\n00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:49.310\nThe cobbler's kids need shoes as well,\nokay?\n\n460\n00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.220\nSo pretty straight forward parsing\nout of this one, as you continues.\n\n461\n00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:53.950\nHopefully, this is a recurring thing.\n\n462\n00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.230\nNow you're starting to get\nused to this a little bit.\n\n463\n00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.490\nNow, again, this is also assuming\nyou know the subject matter.\n\n464\n00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.030\nI'm not making any short change\nof the learning you have.\n\n465\n00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.660\nYou have a lot to learn potentially,\nor a lot to master.\n\n466\n00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.760\nSo when you read these rationale for\neach of the questions,\n\n467\n00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.860\nit's an opportunity to learn or refresh or\nreenforce, on all of the above.\n\n468\n00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.940\nAnd finally, question eight.\n\n469\n00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.618\nFirst of all, specific ask in the question\nis you've been asked to resolve\n\n470\n00:24:24.618 --> 00:24:29.314\nthe confusion over the service level\nmanager and supplier manager rolls.\n\n471\n00:24:29.314 --> 00:24:32.368\nService level management is\nresponsible for some agreement,\n\n472\n00:24:32.368 --> 00:24:35.027\nsupplier management is responsible for\nagreements.\n\n473\n00:24:35.027 --> 00:24:38.507\nITIL has explicitly separated the two\nin two different processes, and\n\n474\n00:24:38.507 --> 00:24:40.310\nperhaps into two different people.\n\n475\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.160\nAnd you've been asked to\nresolve that confusion.\n\n476\n00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.650\nSo this is gonna get me back\ntoward a textbook answer.\n\n477\n00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.880\nWhat's the difference between SLM and\nsupplier management, effectively.\n\n478\n00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.475\nAnd it's putting\nthe business context here.\n\n479\n00:24:53.475 --> 00:24:56.645\nSome of the deficiencies found here is\na number of complaints have been received\n\n480\n00:24:56.645 --> 00:25:00.585\nfrom a new banking customer highlighting\nthat over the previous three months,\n\n481\n00:25:00.585 --> 00:25:03.445\nthe level of service provided by\nthe service desk in the management and\n\n482\n00:25:03.445 --> 00:25:06.215\nhandling of incidents has\nbeen inconsistent and\n\n483\n00:25:06.215 --> 00:25:09.775\nmany incidents have not been resolved\nin line with agreed targets.\n\n484\n00:25:09.775 --> 00:25:11.645\nSome confusion has arisen over how and\n\n485\n00:25:11.645 --> 00:25:14.049\nby whom the original complaint\nshould be dealt with.\n\n486\n00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:21.040\nSo if you are outsourcing your\nservice desk, who's responsible for\n\n487\n00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.730\nthat relationship?\n\n488\n00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.890\nSupplier management or\nservice level management?\n\n489\n00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.690\nIf your service desk is in house,\nwho's responsible for that relationship?\n\n490\n00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.960\nService level management or performance?\n\n491\n00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.893\nService level management or\nsupplier management?\n\n492\n00:25:33.893 --> 00:25:35.820\nThat's basically what\nits getting around to.\n\n493\n00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.895\nAnd in this case, the service desk is\nprovided by one of the suppliers, so\n\n494\n00:25:39.895 --> 00:25:41.650\nit´s outsourced.\n\n495\n00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.950\nYou´ve got some complaints about\nhow the supplier's performing.\n\n496\n00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.370\nNow, that is transparent to the customer.\n\n497\n00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.710\nThe customer doesn't care\nif you outsource it or not.\n\n498\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.700\nYou are the service provider, you are the\none on point for resolving this issue.\n\n499\n00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.500\nYou can´t just throw your\nsupplier under the bus and\n\n500\n00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.310\nexpect to good return from your customers.\n\n501\n00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.010\nSo again, here, we're looking at\ncompare and contrast opportunities.\n\n502\n00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:07.070\nNotice A, B, C, and D,\nhow they start off with the first bullet.\n\n503\n00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.590\nThe question is, who's doing what?\n\n504\n00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.040\nWhat's the service level manager doing?\n\n505\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.969\nWhat's the service level manager\nnot supposed to be doing?\n\n506\n00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:23.310\nSo if you look at C and D, while they're\npatently, I say they're kinda correct.\n\n507\n00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:29.264\nRemember, the gold text, or the brownish\ntext is kind of a neutral, kind of a meh.\n\n508\n00:26:29.264 --> 00:26:32.149\nIt's not wrong,\nit's not necessarily relevant.\n\n509\n00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.461\nThat's really what it comes down to.\n\n510\n00:26:34.461 --> 00:26:36.030\nIt's not a wrong answer.\n\n511\n00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:40.550\nIt's just not relevant to this question or\nnot powerful enough.\n\n512\n00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:45.120\nSo if we look at these going through,\nA says the service level manager\n\n513\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.655\nis supposed to go and apologize to the\ncustomer and compensate them financially.\n\n514\n00:26:48.655 --> 00:26:53.360\n[SOUND] Like the service level\nmanagers got a checkbook in his.\n\n515\n00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.405\nSorry about that, here's a check,\nare you happy now?\n\n516\n00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:57.162\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pay him off,\n\n517\n00:26:57.162 --> 00:26:59.410\nthat's kinda start off a little bad.\n\n518\n00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:03.740\nJust paying the customer some money,\nbecause you had bad experience,\n\n519\n00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.510\nis probably not-\n&gt;&gt; Bribe money it sounds like.\n\n520\n00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean-\n\n521\n00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little hush money here.\n\n522\n00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.420\nStop your complaining,\nwe got you grease the skids here.\n\n523\n00:27:14.016 --> 00:27:16.520\nSo it's really kinda starting off\na little bad there where you go\n\n524\n00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.190\ngive him some money.\n\n525\n00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.210\nEnsure them that under the terms and\nconditions of the contract,\n\n526\n00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.010\na review with the service desk will be\ncarried out and that supply will be\n\n527\n00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.920\nstrictly monitored against agreed\ntargets and penalties imposed.\n\n528\n00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.011\nNow, the service level management\nis not gonna be the process or\n\n529\n00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:32.232\nthe person that's gonna go to supplier and\nstart beating them up.\n\n530\n00:27:32.232 --> 00:27:33.730\nThat's supplier management's job.\n\n531\n00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.216\nSo the service level manager\nthat we're talking about,\n\n532\n00:27:37.216 --> 00:27:40.360\nthey are not gonna go beat up\nthe supplier, supplier management will.\n\n533\n00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.420\nSo A, fading away pretty fast here.\n\n534\n00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.630\nIf you look at B, service level manager,\nlog the complaints.\n\n535\n00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.574\nThat´s a good idea.\n\n536\n00:27:47.574 --> 00:27:49.494\nAnd you'll see that C starts\noff with the same way.\n\n537\n00:27:49.494 --> 00:27:52.248\nLog the complaints.\n\n538\n00:27:52.248 --> 00:27:55.820\nInform the customer the complaints will\nbe reviewed as a matter of urgency.\n\n539\n00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.890\nSo you're telling the customer,\nhey, we've got to get this.\n\n540\n00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.010\nNow, service level management\nis talking with the customer.\n\n541\n00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.320\nThey're not gonna go beat up the supplier.\n\n542\n00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.980\nCollect some evidence, B continues.\n\n543\n00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.590\nAnd pass those on to supplier management.\n\n544\n00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:15.620\nSo service-level management\nis there to gather evidence,\n\n545\n00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.500\nassuage the concerns of the business, but\nhand it over the supplier management,\n\n546\n00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.260\nwhereas C says, inform the customer that\nthe complaints will be discussed with\n\n547\n00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.859\nthe supplier at the next\nscheduled review meeting.\n\n548\n00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.080\nIs that three weeks from now?\n\n549\n00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.120\nIs that five months from now?\n\n550\n00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.285\nSo a little less.\n\n551\n00:28:32.285 --> 00:28:35.530\nIt doesn't quite have the urgency that\nthe customer might be asking for.\n\n552\n00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.370\nNow, all you've said in B is\nwith a matter of urgency.\n\n553\n00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.900\nWe'll take the matter\non with some urgency.\n\n554\n00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.650\nMaybe in the back of your mind you\nknow the review meeting is scheduled\n\n555\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:47.170\nfor next week.\n\n556\n00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.200\nAnd maybe that is urgent\nenough in your own mind.\n\n557\n00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.410\nIt's really just managing the customer\nat little bit, with a bit more finesse.\n\n558\n00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.642\nAnd then, as C continues,\n\n559\n00:28:55.642 --> 00:28:59.737\nensure the customer that the contractual\ndisputes process will be invoked.\n\n560\n00:28:59.737 --> 00:29:03.520\nTo ensure that the complaints are dealt\nwith in an efficient and effective manner,\n\n561\n00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.532\ninform the customers of the actions taken.\n\n562\n00:29:05.532 --> 00:29:07.445\nSo just laid back, that's not a bad thing.\n\n563\n00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:10.440\nSupplier management is gonna do\nthe dirty work with the supplier,\n\n564\n00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.790\nSLM is gonna do the front\nwork with the customers.\n\n565\n00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.660\nSo the problem ongoing with C, is\nthe lack of urgency in the first bullets,\n\n566\n00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.710\nand then there's actually\nno evidence gathered.\n\n567\n00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.930\nYou're not gathering the data that\nyou can go beat the supplier up with.\n\n568\n00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.251\nYou can’t just say,\nthe customer is kinda complaining and\n\n569\n00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:31.330\nnot have any data to back it up.\n\n570\n00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:35.971\nWithout measurement, without data,\nit's just whining or\n\n571\n00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:39.355\nunsubstantiated complaints.\n\n572\n00:29:39.355 --> 00:29:41.105\nAnd, of course, D starts of a similar way.\n\n573\n00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:44.955\nManager will inform the customer that\nthere will be some matter of urgency,\n\n574\n00:29:44.955 --> 00:29:48.535\nassure the customer the disputes\nprocesses in place, etc.\n\n575\n00:29:48.535 --> 00:29:51.875\nAnd then, it dives into reviewing\nthe performance of the supplier for\n\n576\n00:29:51.875 --> 00:29:53.935\nall the services they perform.\n\n577\n00:29:53.935 --> 00:29:57.640\nThat's not SLM's job,\nas we discovered in other ones.\n\n578\n00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.360\nSo again, knowing what a supplier does,\n\n579\n00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:05.590\nknowing what a service level manager does,\nis the real grist on this mill.\n\n580\n00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:10.150\nAnd as you grind them out through these\nanswers, B shines pretty brightly.\n\n581\n00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.204\n&gt;&gt; Another question for you.\n\n582\n00:30:11.204 --> 00:30:15.030\nCuz you mentioned this earlier,\ntoo, in episode one actually.\n\n583\n00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:19.040\nYou said, practice Trump's theory,\nI mean we're looking for\n\n584\n00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.730\naction over theory,\nis that what we're looking for?\n\n585\n00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:22.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me be clear about that.\n\n586\n00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.940\nYes, you're right, Zach,\nas it relates to this specific question,\n\n587\n00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:30.810\nyou need to find demonstrably related,\nI mean it's obvious\n\n588\n00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.690\nthat it points to this particular\nscenario in this particular question.\n\n589\n00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:40.252\nYou might find an answer that has\nreally nice flowery ITIL statements,\n\n590\n00:30:40.252 --> 00:30:43.410\nthat's described in a perfect world.\n\n591\n00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:47.160\nThis is what you would do but it's not\naddressed in these specific issues,\n\n592\n00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.790\nit's more generic.\n\n593\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:49.590\nSo yeah, that's what I mean.\n\n594\n00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:54.040\nPractice Trump's theory and we're talking\nabout applying an appropriate answer\n\n595\n00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.850\nto a particular scenario.\n\n596\n00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:56.450\n&gt;&gt; Bingo.\n\n597\n00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n598\n00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:57.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Good deal.\n\n599\n00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:02.890\nSo you get the idea for\nhow to approach these, of course.\n\n600\n00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.640\nLet's take a quick review.\n\n601\n00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.312\nWhat's gonna be next?\n\n602\n00:31:05.312 --> 00:31:09.090\nIf you haven't already,\nmake sure you take the other sample paper.\n\n603\n00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.770\nYou have two available to you.\n\n604\n00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.220\nTake the other sample paper,\nlearn from it.\n\n605\n00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.430\nReach out into the forum.\n\n606\n00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:17.965\nReach out in the forum for discussion.\n\n607\n00:31:17.965 --> 00:31:20.770\nThere'll be no experts there\nto answer your questions.\n\n608\n00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.720\nIf you have a dispute or you think it's\nkinda shady, that happens sometimes.\n\n609\n00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.500\nSome of these questions that show\nup on the sample papers are not\n\n610\n00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.270\nconstructed in the best way.\n\n611\n00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:33.950\nIn other words, there can be some,\nthat's kinda subjective, isn't it?\n\n612\n00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.640\nShould they be testing such tech?\n\n613\n00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.260\nThat's kind of an opinion, or\nthat was really a reach of logic.\n\n614\n00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.310\nSometimes that happens.\n\n615\n00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:41.790\nSo if you feel that way,\n\n616\n00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:45.495\nthrow it out there in a forum, and we'll\nlaugh at the test maker together perhaps.\n\n617\n00:31:45.495 --> 00:31:46.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n618\n00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.770\nit also is just an opportunity to learn.\n\n619\n00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.706\nRemember that.\nAs you're practicing,\n\n620\n00:31:49.706 --> 00:31:51.570\nyou're not being graded.\n\n621\n00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:52.640\nYou're getting an opportunity to learn.\n\n622\n00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.205\nSo even if the test maker\nkinda errors in his way and\n\n623\n00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:59.009\nyou still get an idea of what he was\ntrying to do or what she was trying to do.\n\n624\n00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:04.190\nAnd that is a very important\ntest takers techniques.\n\n625\n00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.440\nUnderstanding what\nthe test makers are up to.\n\n626\n00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.040\nSo reinforce what you've learnt and\n\n627\n00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.019\nalso take on the opportunities\nfrom the learning.\n\n628\n00:32:12.208 --> 00:32:16.040\nSometimes the rationale is just\nlike a nice short bolted list of\n\n629\n00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.030\neverything you know\nabout in a given topic.\n\n630\n00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.450\nWhich is pretty cool.\n\n631\n00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.946\nAnd there is a nice concise form.\n\n632\n00:32:21.946 --> 00:32:26.617\nAnd when you are ready fake the exam,\nyou're feeling pretty confident,\n\n633\n00:32:26.617 --> 00:32:31.436\nI would say this, if you can access\nyourself to the sample papers and you feel\n\n634\n00:32:31.436 --> 00:32:36.559\nlike you are able to understand the\nrationale, understand the subject matter,\n\n635\n00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:41.340\nunderstand the test maker's techniques,\nyou're probably ready to go.\n\n636\n00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.585\nThe sample papers are the single most\nimportant tools that you have for\n\n637\n00:32:45.585 --> 00:32:46.740\nself-study.\n\n638\n00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.726\nAnd when you're ready to go, you can order\nyour exam voucher from PassionIT Group.\n\n639\n00:32:50.726 --> 00:32:53.530\nYou see the web address there.\n\n640\n00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.240\nAnd schedule your exam and\nI wish you luck.\n\n641\n00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.770\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nVery good job.\n\n642\n00:32:58.770 --> 00:32:59.860\nI mean, excellent.\n\n643\n00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:04.121\nAnd sample paper review, this was ITIL\nservice offerings and agreements,\n\n644\n00:33:04.121 --> 00:33:04.750\npart two.\n\n645\n00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.550\nThere is a part one, watch them both.\n\n646\n00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.865\nAnd they'll be more in the ongoing\nseries of sample paper review, too.\n\n647\n00:33:09.865 --> 00:33:10.635\nWon't there?\n\n648\n00:33:10.635 --> 00:33:11.926\n&gt;&gt; Yes, for every subject.\n\n649\n00:33:11.926 --> 00:33:13.213\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n650\n00:33:13.213 --> 00:33:15.527\nSo thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n651\n00:33:15.527 --> 00:33:19.195\nYou know,\na good IT pro is always learning.\n\n652\n00:33:19.195 --> 00:33:20.215\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n653\n00:33:20.215 --> 00:33:21.145\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n654\n00:33:21.145 --> 00:33:21.813\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n655\n00:33:21.813 -->
