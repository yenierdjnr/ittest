  "description": "In this series, we will show you how to extend an on-premises Active Directory to Microsoft Azure. Extending Active Directory in Azure can be used for disaster recovery and supporting branch offices, to name a few. We will start at the beginning, by setting up our on-premises network, including Active Directory, DNS, and Routing and Remote Access. We will use the RRAS server as our VPN endpoint, which we will use to establish a site-to-site VPN tunnel to Azure. Then we will create our virtual network in Azure, including defining subnets, creating a gateway, and provisioning public IP addresses. Then we will create our Azure resources, including a virtual domain controller, storage accounts, and availability sets. Then we will verify that Active Directory is replicating properly. We will demonstrate using three different methods, with the classic portal, with the new portal and with Azure PowerShell.",

active\n\n3\n00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:16.400\ndirectory in Azure series.\n\n4\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.236\nNow the first thing we'd like\nto dispel is is this Azure AD.\n\n5\n00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.709\nMike, that's a great question.\n\n6\n00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:22.789\nIs this Azure AD?\n\n7\n00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.018\n>> It is great question and\nthe answer is no, it is not.\n\n8\n00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:26.237\nThey are two different things.\n\n9\n00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:31.341\nThey do sound very similar, but Azure AD\nis more of an identity solution that\n\n10\n00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:36.390\nwe can use with things like Office 365 and\nenabling that single sign on.\n\n11\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.575\nWhat we're going to be doing\nis Active Directory in Azure.\n\n12\n00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:44.060\nSo, we're gonna flip those words around\nand it does change the meaning completely.\n\n13\n00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.807\nWhat we're talking about is extending our\non premises Active Directory out into\n\n14\n00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:52.994\nAzure, so that we're running full\nblown copies of Active Directory,\n\n15\n00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:57.271\nreplicating with our on-premises\nmain controllers, the whole nine.\n\n16\n00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:00.411\n>> Now that we understand\nthat this isn't Azure AD,\n\n17\n00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:03.870\nwhat can we expect in\nthese upcoming episodes?\n\n18\n00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.629\n>> Well, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna basically walk you through\n\n19\n00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:07.479\nthe entire process.\n\n20\n00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.656\nWe're gonna start by setting up\nour on-premises Active Directory.\n\n21\n00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:16.056\nCreating our on-premises network and then\nwe're gonna move on out in the Azure where\n\n22\n00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:19.312\nwe're going to create our virtual\nnetwork out there in Azure.\n\n23\n00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:23.666\nWe're gonna create a site to site VPN\nbetween our on-premises network and\n\n24\n00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:28.088\nour Azure network and then we're gonna\nrole out some virtual machines, and\n\n25\n00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.368\ninstall active directory on them, and\n\n26\n00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:34.470\nverify that we have replication going\non across that site to site VPN.\n\n27\n00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.029\n>> Very good.\n\n28\n00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:37.271\nNow to hone it down just\na little bit farther,\n\n29\n00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:41.050\nwhat are some of the specific topics\nthat we might encounter in this series?\n\n30\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.049\n>> Well, we're gonna go through several\ndifferent ways to accomplish the task that\n\n31\n00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:44.749\nI just mentioned.\n\n32\n00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.093\nBecause as of the filming\nof these episodes,\n\n33\n00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:51.590\nthere's really three different ways we\ncan do what we're talking about doing.\n\n34\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.873\nWe've got the classic portal, which\nif you've been working with Azure for\n\n35\n00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:57.452\nany length of time,\nyou're probably familiar with that.\n\n36\n00:01:57.452 --> 00:02:02.120\nIt's a web-based portal that we can go\nthrough and we can manage our resources,\n\n37\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.417\ncreate our VMs and\nour virtual networks and the like, but\n\n38\n00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:09.855\nthen we also wanna dive into the new\nportal that's been released recently.\n\n39\n00:02:09.855 --> 00:02:11.031\nIt's the same thing.\n\n40\n00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:15.984\nWe're dealing with Azure out there in\nMicrosoft's Cloud, but it's a new portal\n\n41\n00:02:15.984 --> 00:02:21.180\nand it's a different way of going about\ncreating and managing these resources.\n\n42\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.367\nAnd then we're also gonna take\na look at Azure PowerShell,\n\n43\n00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:26.674\nbecause as we get more and\nmore into Azure.\n\n44\n00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:30.868\nPutting more, more resources out there,\nwe're gonna find the need to start\n\n45\n00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:35.240\nautomating certain tasks, especially\nsome of the more repetitive tasks.\n\n46\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.367\nSo we're gonna go through the whole\nprocess using Azure PowerShell, as well.\n\n47\n00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:42.722\nSo, we'll end up doing the same\ntasks three different times.\n\n48\n00:02:42.722 --> 00:02:46.805\nOnce with the classic portal,\nonce again with the new portal and\n\n49\n00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:49.084\nthen again with Azure PowerShell.\n\n50\n00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:49.792\n>> Excellent stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:52.915\nIt really sounds like it's\nsomething to look forward to.\n\n52\n00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:56.503\nNow, who is the intended audience for\nthis specific series?\n\n53\n00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:59.961\n>> These are really geared towards those\nof you that are getting ready to roll\n\n54\n00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:03.270\nout into Azure,\nlike you've got your on-premises network.\n\n55\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.355\nAnd now, you're looking to extend\nthat out into the cloud and\n\n56\n00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:08.739\nmaybe you're doing it for\ndisaster recovery.\n\n57\n00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.562\nSo that if your on-premises network\ndisappears for some reason,\n\n58\n00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:16.180\nyou still have copies of\nActive Directory out there in Azure and\n\n59\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.270\nthen recovering from that\ndisaster becomes easier.\n\n60\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.841\nBecause now, you have to setup your local\nnetwork again, recreate your site side\n\n61\n00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:27.501\nVPN, replication kicks in and\nwe're right backup and running.\n\n62\n00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:31.702\nOr if you're looking at taking some\nof the Windows Server 2012 exams,\n\n63\n00:03:31.702 --> 00:03:35.371\nthis isn't geared specifically\ntowards one of those exams, but\n\n64\n00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:39.508\na lot of these concepts and topics\nabout getting familiar with Azure could\n\n65\n00:03:39.508 --> 00:03:42.872\ndefinitely help you in your\nstudy process for those exams.\n\n66\n00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:44.173\n>> Excellent stuff.\n\n67\n00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:47.464\nWell, if that sounds like something\nthat's either gonna be useful or\n\n68\n00:03:47.464 --> 00:03:51.336\njust interesting to you, we look forward\nto seeing you in the upcoming episodes.\n\n69\n00:03:51.336 --> 00:04:00.369\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
