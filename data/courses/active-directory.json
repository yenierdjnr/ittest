Directory.\n\n3\n00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:15.283\nActive Directory is one of the more\nimportant concepts that we can learn about\n\n4\n00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:16.292\nas IT professionals.\n\n5\n00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:19.692\nAnd we wanna make sure that everybody has\na good understanding of the foundations\n\n6\n00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:21.690\nand the basics in Active Directory.\n\n7\n00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.510\nAnd we've got Mike Rodrick to\nactually help us out here,\n\n8\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.180\nto show us what we're\ngonna be talking about.\n\n9\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.360\nSo Mike, what are we gonna be\ncovering here in Active Directory?\n\n10\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.372\n>> Well,\nwe're gonna cover from A to Z, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:33.550\nThis is the place to be if you\nwanna learn about Active Directory.\n\n12\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.103\nWe're gonna start with the very basics\nof getting Active Directory installed.\n\n13\n00:00:38.103 --> 00:00:41.640\nAnd even just installing Active Directory,\nthere's different ways I can install it.\n\n14\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.253\nIf we're gonna install it on a full-blown\nserver with a GUI interface or\n\n15\n00:00:46.253 --> 00:00:48.608\nif we're gonna do it on Server Core.\n\n16\n00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:51.136\nWe're gonna take a look at\ncloning Domain Controller,\n\n17\n00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:54.328\nso that we can push domain controllers\nout in a rapid pace if we need to.\n\n18\n00:00:54.328 --> 00:00:57.563\nIf we need to deploy additional\ndomain controllers very quickly,\n\n19\n00:00:57.563 --> 00:01:00.170\nwe are gonna take a look at cloning,\nas well.\n\n20\n00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.980\nAnd then we're gonna break\nActive Directory down.\n\n21\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.785\nLike I said, we're gonna start at the very\nbasics, and kind of work our way through.\n\n22\n00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:08.790\nSo we're gonna learn about\nwhat makes Active Directory.\n\n23\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.740\nWe'll talk about the database,\nand the SYSVOL folder structure.\n\n24\n00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.342\nWe'll talk about organizing Active\nDirectory with organizational units.\n\n25\n00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:19.820\nWe're gonna take a look\nat user accounts and\n\n26\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.300\ncomputer accounts and\ngetting those created.\n\n27\n00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.180\nBecause really, Active Directory again,\nit's as Ronnie said, a very important\n\n28\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.780\ntopic if you're going to be administering\nan Active Directory network,\n\n29\n00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.310\nand almost all enterprises\nare running Active Directory.\n\n30\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.522\nWe move out of that work group model\nvery early on when we're in that SOHO.\n\n31\n00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:39.502\nWe get more than 10, 15 users,\n\n32\n00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:43.165\nwe're probably gonna be\nimplementing Active Directory.\n\n33\n00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:46.375\nThat's a beautiful thing about Active\nDirectory, it's very, very scalable.\n\n34\n00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:51.037\nIt can go from ten objects to\ntens of thousands of objects, and\n\n35\n00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:53.555\neven more, it scales very well.\n\n36\n00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:57.960\nBut, that brings challenges as we\nstart getting geographically dispersed\n\n37\n00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.073\nwith our offices.\n\n38\n00:01:59.073 --> 00:02:01.063\nAnd we've got offices in different cities.\n\n39\n00:02:01.063 --> 00:02:03.945\nNow I've gotta worry about\nreplication with Active Directory,\n\n40\n00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:07.720\nmaking sure that we have a consistent\nstate so we're gonna deal with that.\n\n41\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.798\nReplication and sites, and replication\nlinks or site links, you name it.\n\n42\n00:02:13.798 --> 00:02:14.959\nI'm trying to think of what else, Ronnie.\n\n43\n00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.530\nWe're gonna look at the trust relations\nthat get created in Active Directory.\n\n44\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.315\nHow to create our own trust if we need to\nset up trust with external organizations.\n\n45\n00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:27.730\nAdding additional domain controllers.\n\n46\n00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.810\nAs our forest grows,\nmaybe we go to a multi-domain environment.\n\n47\n00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.770\nHow do we add those child domains?\n\n48\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.970\nWhat if I've got a separate namespace?\n\n49\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.050\nWe'll throw a little bit of DNS in there\nbecause Active Directory does rely on DNS,\n\n50\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.480\nbut we're really gonna\nfocus primarily on DNS.\n\n51\n00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.664\nWe'll talk a little bit\nabout group policy but\n\n52\n00:02:46.664 --> 00:02:49.976\nthen we've got other shows where\nwe're gonna focus on group policy.\n\n53\n00:02:49.976 --> 00:02:53.936\nThis, again,\nis gonna really focus on Active Directory.\n\n54\n00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:56.652\nWe've gotta make sure we're ready for\ndisasters, right?\n\n55\n00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:59.300\nWe've gotta make sure we're\nbacking up Active Directory.\n\n56\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.920\nHow do we restore Active Directory?\n\n57\n00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.085\nWhat if I've got a deleted object that\nchanges the restoration process of putting\n\n58\n00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.062\nthat object back?\n\n59\n00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:09.180\nWe're gonna show you\nhow to do that as well.\n\n60\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.170\nSo if you do anything\nwith Active Directory,\n\n61\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.240\nwhether you're the admin\nthat handles everything.\n\n62\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.840\nOr maybe you've been delegated\na task that you're responsible for\n\n63\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.670\nresetting user accounts' passwords.\n\n64\n00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.270\nAnd we're gonna look at that delegation\nwizard and see how that's done.\n\n65\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.900\nMaybe you're administering Active\nDirectory but your organization is growing\n\n66\n00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.260\nand you need to delegate portions\nof your job out to other people.\n\n67\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.074\nHow do I do that in a secure fashion?\n\n68\n00:03:33.074 --> 00:03:36.979\nHow do I let the help desk go in and\nreset passwords but not for\n\n69\n00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.340\nthe admin accounts, or\nnot create new users.\n\n70\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.362\nWe're gonna show you how to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:42.362 --> 00:03:45.412\nLike I said, we'll work a little bit\nwith those default group policies,\n\n72\n00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:47.686\ngroups are another thing\nthat we've gotta deal with.\n\n73\n00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:51.122\nHow we create groups within\nActive Directory and\n\n74\n00:03:51.122 --> 00:03:53.813\nassign permissions to those groups.\n\n75\n00:03:53.813 --> 00:03:55.310\nPre-staging computer accounts.\n\n76\n00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.630\nI mean, you name it, we're gonna cover it.\n\n77\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.310\nSo if you need to learn about\nActive Directory, whether it's installing\n\n78\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.050\nActive Directory or maintaining an\nexisting Active Directory infrastructure.\n\n79\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.225\nIf you're new to it, or if you've had some\nexperience with it and you wanna brush up\n\n80\n00:04:09.225 --> 00:04:13.122\non your Flexible Single Master Operation\nroles and how to move those around.\n\n81\n00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:17.074\nAnd what to do if one of the domain\ncontrollers that's holding one of those\n\n82\n00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:17.850\nFSMOs fails.\n\n83\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.570\nHow do I recover from that?\n\n84\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.980\nWe're gonna show you how.\n\n85\n00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.480\nSo, again, if you need to learn about\nActive Directory, this is the place to be.\n\n86\n00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.818\nAll right, so we've got some\ngreat episodes coming your way.\n\n87\n00:04:27.818 --> 00:04:31.057\nWe're gonna, again, work with\nActive Directory from top to bottom.\n\n88\n00:04:31.057 --> 00:04:32.019\nHope to see you there.\n\n89\n00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:38.959\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
