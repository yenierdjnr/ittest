You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.616\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:20.196\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our Advanced Powerpoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:21.959\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:26.300\nwe're gonna be looking at customizing\nthe user interface within PowerPoint.\n\n8\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.100\nAnd here to show us the way and all the\ncool things we can do is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.990\nWelcome back, Vonne.\n\n10\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.160\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you so\nmuch for having me.\n\n11\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.710\nSo just as Mike said, we're going\nto be customizing our interface.\n\n12\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.710\nWe're gonna start\npersonalizing our PowerPoint.\n\n13\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.850\nBecause once we start getting familiar\nwith where everything is in the ribbon,\n\n14\n00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.730\nand how do we add content,\n\n15\n00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.660\nthere's going to be certain things\nthat is gonna pop along the way.\n\n16\n00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.670\nOf like, I really wish it would stop doing\nthat or I don't want this to happen, or\n\n17\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.550\ncan I make this a little different, and\n\n18\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.070\nthat's where going through the PowerPoint\noptions is going to be really helpful.\n\n19\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.780\nNow there's a lot of options in here,\nI mean we could probably be talking about\n\n20\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.670\nthis for hours really if we went over\nevery single one in like minute detail.\n\n21\n00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.737\nBut what we're gonna do is gonna go\nthrough each one of the categories and\n\n22\n00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:10.470\nthen I'm going to point\nout some of the ones that\n\n23\n00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.590\nI've found that have been helpful to me.\n\n24\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.870\nSo I would like to share that with you,\nand\n\n25\n00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.410\nmaybe just at least get you familiar\nwith what is even in there.\n\n26\n00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.370\nSo later down the road,\nit's like I think that's a check box,\n\n27\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.910\nan option, and if I turn that off,\nit would stop doing whatever it is,\n\n28\n00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.180\nit's not making me happy right now.\n\n29\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.050\nAnd this is actually for\nall of your products.\n\n30\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.260\nSo, you can do the same thing in Word and\nExcel.\n\n31\n00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.890\nIt's kind of nice to at least go\nthrough them and point them out.\n\n32\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.600\nSo, I have a file that we're\ngonna go ahead and just open so\n\n33\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.460\nwe can get PowerPoint ready to go.\n\n34\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.210\nSo we're gonna bring back to stars\nof the first PowerPoint show.\n\n35\n00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.030\nWe're gonna bring back the kitties.\n\n36\n00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.550\nSo we're gonna bring up learn PowerPoint.\n\n37\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.365\nSo, if you haven't watched\nthe PowerPoint 2016 series,\n\n38\n00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.165\nthey're a lot too and\nthey're gonna be in this one too.\n\n39\n00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:00.073\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fuego and\n\n40\n00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:03.267\nBishop are gonna be worldwide\nstars at this point.\n\n41\n00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:04.441\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, I know.\n\n42\n00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.732\nThat means probably gonna\nget to their head and\n\n43\n00:02:06.732 --> 00:02:09.217\nhe's gonna just lay around\nmore than he does now.\n\n44\n00:02:09.217 --> 00:02:14.910\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ngo to File &gt; Options.\n\n45\n00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.360\nAnd we're gonna go through our\ndifferent PowerPoint options.\n\n46\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.430\nNow on that first series that we did on\nPowerPoint, we did come here a few times\n\n47\n00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.560\nwhen we were doing our editing,\nour auto-correct options.\n\n48\n00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.509\nAnd we were also here when we were\ncustomizing our quick-access toolbar.\n\n49\n00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.980\nAnd that's really all we\nreally went through it.\n\n50\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.303\nSo we're gonna just take a few moments\nto go through each one of these, so\n\n51\n00:02:35.303 --> 00:02:37.056\nwe're gonna start with the general.\n\n52\n00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:42.031\nAnd here we have some different options\nin our user interface the mini toolbar.\n\n53\n00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:45.520\nI will tell you that this thing,\nwas it 2003?\n\n54\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.450\n&gt;&gt; I believe it is when it first came out,\nyes.\n\n55\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I don't know about you,\nbut I couldn't stand that thing.\n\n56\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.071\n&gt;&gt; When it first came out it annoyed\nthe heck out of me, and I've learned in\n\n57\n00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:57.485\noptions how to turn it off, but since\nthen I've actually turned it back on.\n\n58\n00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:00.259\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was the first thing I\nwould do at any computer that I was at,\n\n59\n00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.813\nI would go into the options and\nI would turn off the main toolbar.\n\n60\n00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:06.830\nBut now I like it,\nI think it's quite helpful.\n\n61\n00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.550\nSo if you're not familiar,\nlike what are you even talking about?\n\n62\n00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.520\nWhat is the mini tool bar?\n\n63\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.780\nCuz I don't know if I actually even\nreally pointed it out so blatantly,\n\n64\n00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.690\nif you wanna say, in the first series.\n\n65\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.765\nThe mini toolbar comes up when you\nhave selected items in your text or\n\n66\n00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:25.260\nmaybe a picture, or in a table.\n\n67\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.700\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect the word layout.\n\n68\n00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.976\nAnd you can see it's right there,\n\n69\n00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:35.615\nthat little toolbar that pops up\nright away as soon as I select it.\n\n70\n00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:39.243\nIt's going to give me some quick\noptions to format my text.\n\n71\n00:03:39.243 --> 00:03:44.520\nIf I had selected a column in a table or\nan image or something else,\n\n72\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.490\nyour mini toolbar is going to change\ndepending on whatever you have selected.\n\n73\n00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.280\n&gt;&gt; So, it's context sensitive.\n\n74\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.130\nIt's gonna give you the most\ncommonly used tools\n\n75\n00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.195\ndepending on what it is you have selected.\n\n76\n00:03:56.195 --> 00:03:58.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nit's nice because it's right there.\n\n77\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.860\nNow you're saying, well,\nit's right there on the Home tab.\n\n78\n00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.340\nBut what if you aren't on the Home tab.\n\n79\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.150\nWhat if I was over on say,\nthe Transitions tab, and\n\n80\n00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.410\nI wanted to just quickly make that bold.\n\n81\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.740\nWell, if that wasn't there,\nI'd have to go back up to the Home,\n\n82\n00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.110\nI'd have to click on the end, so\nit's just two or three more clicks,\n\n83\n00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.510\nbut you reduce a couple clicks, and\nit's gonna make your life a lot easier.\n\n84\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.470\nSo I've come to really appreciate\nthe mini toolbar for its purpose.\n\n85\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.590\nAnd good job, Microsoft.\n\n86\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So I like it now.\n\n87\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.893\nAnother thing while I'm here,\nthe live previews that we have,\n\n88\n00:04:29.893 --> 00:04:32.758\nas I go back to the home tab and\nnot stay on the mini toolbar.\n\n89\n00:04:32.758 --> 00:04:35.740\nIf I have the live previews that show me,\n\n90\n00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.020\nbefore I actually commit to something\nof what it's going to look like.\n\n91\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.340\nNow that is a feature they they started\nadding, I believe, in 2003 as well.\n\n92\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.650\nReally great, and\nit's always on by default.\n\n93\n00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.240\nBut back over here in our File &gt; Options.\n\n94\n00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.270\n&gt;&gt; Actually before you do that,\ncan you show that one more time,\n\n95\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.300\nI think the word was\nbehind your drop down.\n\n96\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.120\nMaybe select something out\nin the middle of the slide.\n\n97\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.160\n&gt;&gt; How about we do this.\n\n98\n00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.880\nWhy don't we take this one, and\nwe'll go ahead and go over to Format.\n\n99\n00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.120\nAnd you can see that right there, perfect.\n\n100\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.665\nSo you can see that while I'm hovering\nover the different colors and\n\n101\n00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:13.456\nformatting the fill color of this shape,\n\n102\n00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:17.778\nit's letting me see what it's\ngoing to look like before I do it.\n\n103\n00:05:17.778 --> 00:05:22.950\nAnd that is live preview and\nI love it, I think its fantastic.\n\n104\n00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know I've stared at it and gone\nokay what color would look good here and\n\n105\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.149\nit's a pain to click on it and\nthen go back and look and\n\n106\n00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:29.692\nclick on another one go back and look.\n\n107\n00:05:29.692 --> 00:05:33.640\nThis way you can kind of see as your\nhovering over there really quick.\n\n108\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.230\nBut, it does have some down sides,\ndoesn't it?\n\n109\n00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.080\n&gt;&gt; It does, if you have a computer\nthat maybe is a little bit older,\n\n110\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.897\ndoesn't have as fast of a GPU or graphical\nprocessing, is that, okay thank you.\n\n111\n00:05:44.897 --> 00:05:48.343\n[LAUGH] I know the letters and\nI start saying it, and I'm like,\n\n112\n00:05:48.343 --> 00:05:50.873\nI'm pretty sure that's what it stands for.\n\n113\n00:05:50.873 --> 00:05:52.789\nYour memory, your RAM,\n\n114\n00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.898\nbasically if your computer doesn't\nhave the oomph to support it,\n\n115\n00:05:57.898 --> 00:06:03.207\nit can maybe bog down your program,\nit's not gonna perform as fast.\n\n116\n00:06:03.207 --> 00:06:07.601\nSo that's something that does take a lot\nof it, so if you want to turn off that\n\n117\n00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:12.365\nlive preview, you can do so and\nit might make it a little easier for you.\n\n118\n00:06:12.365 --> 00:06:15.715\nBut it was a huge feature\nwhen it first came out.\n\n119\n00:06:15.715 --> 00:06:19.219\nSo if your computer can handle it,\nI would say don't turn it off.\n\n120\n00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.933\nBut back in to PowerPoint, sorry I had\nalready gone back to my File tab and\n\n121\n00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:25.810\ngone back to my Options.\n\n122\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.425\nYou can see that those two check boxes\nthere is what we're talking about.\n\n123\n00:06:30.425 --> 00:06:32.275\nKeeping the mini toolbar on or off, and\n\n124\n00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:35.175\nhaving the live preview enabled or\ndisabled.\n\n125\n00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:40.165\nIf we keep on going down our list,\npersonalize your copy of Microsoft Office.\n\n126\n00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:42.185\nThis is what your computer is named of.\n\n127\n00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:45.255\nWhen I actually created this Machine and\n\n128\n00:06:45.255 --> 00:06:48.775\nit's this version of\nWindows on my computer,\n\n129\n00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:53.855\nI named it VonnePC because it's my PC,\nversion on this computer.\n\n130\n00:06:53.855 --> 00:06:55.021\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is funny that\n\n131\n00:06:55.021 --> 00:06:58.336\nit actually pulls your computer name and\nnot your username.\n\n132\n00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:01.180\nWhich would make more sense maybe,\nat least to me.\n\n133\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.190\n&gt;&gt; I always thought that too,\nwhen I started this.\n\n134\n00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.500\nI'm like,\nwhy isn't it named Justin Timberlake?\n\n135\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.700\nBecause that's the account that\nI'm using in my Office 365, and\n\n136\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.790\nthat's what everything I'm signed in to,\nand that is it but\n\n137\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.300\nit really does pull from\nyour computer name.\n\n138\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.892\nSo if you have some weird thing in there,\nit could be that whoever installed your\n\n139\n00:07:18.892 --> 00:07:22.524\noperating system on your computer\nwithin your organization,\n\n140\n00:07:22.524 --> 00:07:24.525\nit might have some weird numbers.\n\n141\n00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:29.495\nBecause that's how your IT department has\ncataloged how this version of Windows\n\n142\n00:07:29.495 --> 00:07:33.450\nis installed on all the machines\nin your office or what have you.\n\n143\n00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.300\nSo that could be different,\nand that's okay, but\n\n144\n00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.180\nat least you know that that's\nwhat's going to pull off.\n\n145\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.100\nNow when I start doing collaboration and\nreviewing with my PowerPoint with other\n\n146\n00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.370\npeople, which we'll be using in future\nepisodes, it does use your username there.\n\n147\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.873\nIt will use Justin Timberlake,\nit won't say VonnePC.\n\n148\n00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:54.222\nBut I have seen in the past at\nleast before Microsoft Office,\n\n149\n00:07:54.222 --> 00:07:58.228\nthe whole subscription base in the cloud,\nit would use that and whatever\n\n150\n00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:02.453\nthe initials you would have if you were\ndoing track changes and everything.\n\n151\n00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:06.013\nMore in Word than PowerPoint, cuz you\ndon't have track changes in PowerPoint.\n\n152\n00:08:06.013 --> 00:08:08.839\nBut it would pull from\nwhatever you have here so\n\n153\n00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:13.114\nif you wanted to have it say something or\ndisplay differently when your\n\n154\n00:08:13.114 --> 00:08:18.660\nsharing documents then you could go ahead\nand customize it with this right here.\n\n155\n00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.598\nI'm gonna take a quick skip down to the\nbottom, the enable PowerPoint designer.\n\n156\n00:08:23.598 --> 00:08:27.836\nThis is where in that first PowerPoint\nseries where this thing is super awesome,\n\n157\n00:08:27.836 --> 00:08:29.410\nI love PowerPoint Designer.\n\n158\n00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.450\nThat's where it's going to give you those\ndesigning tips when you start inserting\n\n159\n00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:38.320\nmultiple images and brings it off to the\nright hand pane to give you the options.\n\n160\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.890\nIt is something that you do have\nto have an Office 365 account,\n\n161\n00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.720\nso if you don't have that then you\nprobably won't even have that option.\n\n162\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.841\nSo, that was the kind\nof contingency on that.\n\n163\n00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:52.088\nAnd I would always enable it\ncuz I think it's fantastic.\n\n164\n00:08:52.088 --> 00:08:58.746\nSo, if you don't see it, the whole Office\n365 subscription would be a reason why.\n\n165\n00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:01.650\n&gt;&gt; Interesting, so some of these\nsettings are dependent on whether\n\n166\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.740\nyou are logged in to\nyour Office 365 account?\n\n167\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.139\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n168\n00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:10.487\nThe designer is one of them and another\none that we're going to take a look\n\n169\n00:09:10.487 --> 00:09:14.450\nat is the customization of our\nbackground and our Office theme.\n\n170\n00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.896\nSo up here in the personalize your coffee?\n\n171\n00:09:17.896 --> 00:09:20.047\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do like personalized coffee.\n\n172\n00:09:20.047 --> 00:09:20.547\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I need some more coffee.\n\n173\n00:09:20.547 --> 00:09:21.894\nProbably not actually, that'd be bad.\n\n174\n00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.595\nBad, you don't want to see it.\n\n175\n00:09:23.595 --> 00:09:25.916\nSo I have Office background and\n\n176\n00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:27.730\nI have Office theme.\nWow,\n\n177\n00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.155\nI'm getting tripped up on that one.\nSo\n\n178\n00:09:29.155 --> 00:09:34.169\nIf you do not have Office background\nright here in this section, it is because\n\n179\n00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:39.336\nyou are not signed in to your Office\naccount, whether it's the Office 365 or\n\n180\n00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:42.432\njust like your regular Office account.\nBut,\n\n181\n00:09:42.432 --> 00:09:46.707\nI do like them because it's\nallowing you to customize and\n\n182\n00:09:46.707 --> 00:09:50.016\npersonalize what you're looking at.\nNow,\n\n183\n00:09:50.016 --> 00:09:54.351\nif you choose the options here,\nam gonna go with the doodle diamond a and\n\n184\n00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:59.118\nmay be we'll go with white, what you see\nit looks like, but you can't see it,\n\n185\n00:09:59.118 --> 00:10:01.747\ncan you?\nI have no idea what that even means right\n\n186\n00:10:01.747 --> 00:10:05.745\nnow because my PowerPoint options are\ntaking so much of the screen that what is\n\n187\n00:10:05.745 --> 00:10:09.047\nit doing, let's go down and\nokay that's well there you go.\n\n188\n00:10:09.047 --> 00:10:13.840\nWhat it's doing is taking the Office\nbackground and changing the color.\n\n189\n00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.120\nNow, I've gotten so used to looking at\nit as orange, but it's really hard for\n\n190\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.612\nme to look at it any other way, especially\nif you go to the black or the dark gray.\n\n191\n00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:25.540\nCuz it's really,\nreally dark, and it's just\n\n192\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.620\nI think it's kind of like you get used\nto it, and you see what it looks like.\n\n193\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.360\nThough if you change it,\n\n194\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.810\nit starts to kind of throw you off\na little bit within this program.\n\n195\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:40.300\nBut if I'm on like my mail, like my OWA,\nsorry, my Outlook Web Access,\n\n196\n00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.860\nand if I'm logging in through that portal,\nI've gone and changed all of that.\n\n197\n00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.320\nI mean it's like pink and purple and\n\n198\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.566\nmy Gmail's got like you know dancing\nbears around it or something.\n\n199\n00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:53.060\n[LAUGH] Everything's changed, so it's\nalong those same lines that you can go\n\n200\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.680\nahead and customize what this looks like.\n\n201\n00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.633\nI think the easier way to start seeing\nthese options of the color themes and\n\n202\n00:10:59.633 --> 00:11:01.037\nthe Office backgrounds,\n\n203\n00:11:01.037 --> 00:11:04.825\nis if you go to a different place than\nthe options where we were just at.\n\n204\n00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:06.224\nYou go to the account.\n\n205\n00:11:06.224 --> 00:11:09.076\nIf you go over here to the file and\nyou go over to account,\n\n206\n00:11:09.076 --> 00:11:12.993\nthe account is where it's going to get,\nwell, your account information.\n\n207\n00:11:12.993 --> 00:11:17.594\nYou can see my user name is Justin\nTimberlake and here is the email and\n\n208\n00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:21.549\nthis is the one that I'm associated\nbecause I am I am logged\n\n209\n00:11:21.549 --> 00:11:24.963\nin to my Office 365\naccount with this account.\n\n210\n00:11:24.963 --> 00:11:27.993\nFor some reason, I would tell you that it\ndoesn't you see my pictures that in there?\n\n211\n00:11:27.993 --> 00:11:32.755\nI have a picture, I have gone to my\nOffice 365 account online, customize my\n\n212\n00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:38.250\nphotograph and hide everything there and\nit won't connect to the product.\n\n213\n00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.737\nI have search and search and\nI have seen all sorts like forms that\n\n214\n00:11:42.737 --> 00:11:47.226\nare talking about the syncing\nissue with different versions of\n\n215\n00:11:47.226 --> 00:11:52.180\nthe Office products like whether\nit's like an enterprise edition.\n\n216\n00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.293\nBut there is a like a bug,\nthere's something does not connecting for\n\n217\n00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:55.999\nsome reasons.\n\n218\n00:11:55.999 --> 00:12:00.180\nSo if you don't see it either,\nthere's something going on there.\n\n219\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.200\nI wish I could tell you how to fix it but\n[LAUGH] it's-\n\n220\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.718\n&gt;&gt; We'll wait for Microsoft on that.\n\n221\n00:12:04.718 --> 00:12:05.585\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right, yeah.\n\n222\n00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:06.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n223\n00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.550\ndon't be alarmed if you don't have\nyour picture yet but I know set it.\n\n224\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.780\nIt's okay.\n\n225\n00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.940\nWe can go with it.\n\n226\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.210\nBut right here where I was going along,\nthe Office background, the Office theme,\n\n227\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.720\nthis is where if I start change it, you\ncan see it up here on the right hand side.\n\n228\n00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.703\nIf I start hovering over them you could\nsee that it is actually changing to those\n\n229\n00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:30.927\ndifferent areas of geometry, the lunchbox,\ncuz I wanna have pictures of toast.\n\n230\n00:12:30.927 --> 00:12:33.898\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; It starts making me hungry.\n\n231\n00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:35.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I would of course stars,\n\n232\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.380\ncuz I like things with stars.\n\n233\n00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.890\nAnd then you can see the dark gray,\nif I chose that.\n\n234\n00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.290\nThat's pretty dark.\n\n235\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.040\nThe black is, that's too dark for me.\n\n236\n00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.640\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n237\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know.\n\n238\n00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.358\nI think I've always,\nI've seen your product set that way.\n\n239\n00:12:51.358 --> 00:12:54.218\nBut it really depends, do you like\ndark backgrounds with light text?\n\n240\n00:12:54.218 --> 00:12:56.010\nOr do you like white\nbackgrounds with dark text?\n\n241\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.100\nIt's really a personal preference.\n\n242\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.740\nBut it's nice that is small but\nit's enough to just make,\n\n243\n00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.710\nthis is my copy of PowerPoint ans this\nis how I want PowerPoint to look,\n\n244\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.420\nand how I can make it mine.\n\n245\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.745\n&gt;&gt; And a little interesting\nsite there once you said that,\n\n246\n00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:15.425\nI realized that I wasn't signed\nin to my Office 365 account.\n\n247\n00:13:15.425 --> 00:13:17.585\nSo I did not have the background option.\n\n248\n00:13:17.585 --> 00:13:21.715\nI signed in and it remembered my\nbackground option from the last time.\n\n249\n00:13:21.715 --> 00:13:23.915\nAnd it went and threw that up there.\n\n250\n00:13:23.915 --> 00:13:27.725\n&gt;&gt; See, this is the reason why\nwe have our accounts at work.\n\n251\n00:13:27.725 --> 00:13:29.236\nSo I'm glad I could point that out to you.\n\n252\n00:13:29.236 --> 00:13:30.228\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n253\n00:13:30.228 --> 00:13:36.285\n&gt;&gt; Another really quick thing while\nwe're here on the account feature or\n\n254\n00:13:36.285 --> 00:13:37.833\nthe menu option.\n\n255\n00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:39.750\nWe don't really have menus anymore, but-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n256\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.090\n&gt;&gt; We're here.\n\n257\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:47.480\nThe product information, how do I know\nwhat version of Office that I'm using?\n\n258\n00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.450\nIt'll let you know that\nI'm on the 365 Plo, wow.\n\n259\n00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:59.690\nPro plus account [LAUGH] as opposed\nto if you have a personal version or\n\n260\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.290\nanother one and it can show you the\ndifferent accounts that you will have and\n\n261\n00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:09.060\neverything that is with the product\nthat you or your company purchased.\n\n262\n00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.680\nSo it's a good place to find out what\nversion I'm on and the other thing\n\n263\n00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.080\nwould be about your updates if you\nneed to have your Office updates.\n\n264\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.490\nSometimes I've seen it where\nit's highlighted in yellow.\n\n265\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.540\nThat means that you need\nto install your updates.\n\n266\n00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.850\nAnd you could go ahead and look at\nwhether or not you need it to update\n\n267\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:30.010\nall the different iterations of\nupdates that they have provided.\n\n268\n00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.450\nSo that is there in the product\ninformation in your account options or\n\n269\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.150\nyour account settings\nwithin the backstage view.\n\n270\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.300\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n271\n00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.140\n&gt;&gt; Nice, so we're gonna go and\ncontinue on with some more\n\n272\n00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.220\noptions that we were going down,\nwe were doing it in general.\n\n273\n00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got a long way to go.\n\n274\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.380\n&gt;&gt; We just started.\n\n275\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.870\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and\nchange this back to colorful.\n\n276\n00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.840\nAnd I'm going to go ahead and\nchange this back to circle and\n\n277\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.650\nstripes because I kind of\nactually like the defaults.\n\n278\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.040\nSo it was already starting to\nmess with my brain right there.\n\n279\n00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.710\nSo let go back to the proofing.\n\n280\n00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.000\nNow we did go over a lot\nwith proofing options and\n\n281\n00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.370\nauto correct options in that\nfirst series of PowerPoint.\n\n282\n00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.240\nBut I would like to just go ahead and\nre-emphasize it here again, and\n\n283\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.530\nthis is where it will do all of your\nauto correcting while you're typing,\n\n284\n00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.910\nwhere like ignoring,\n\n285\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:20.150\nwhere's the contained numbers when you're\ndoing your correcting of your spelling.\n\n286\n00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.435\nAnd ignoring uppercase words cuz\nthey don't wanna have that being\n\n287\n00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:29.332\na misspelled word, the other one would\nbe our auto correct option right here\n\n288\n00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:34.305\nwhere it has your auto format as you type,\nwhether or not it's going to do like\n\n289\n00:15:34.305 --> 00:15:39.301\nif you did the number one and then ST,\nit automatically superscripts the ST.\n\n290\n00:15:39.301 --> 00:15:41.570\nYou could have it start\ndoing some of those things.\n\n291\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.970\nAnd all of the different auto correct\noptions that it does as you type.\n\n292\n00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:49.020\nAnd you can go ahead and\nchange any of the features here.\n\n293\n00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.600\nLike you want it to start\ncapitalizing first words, or\n\n294\n00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.300\nfirst letters of sentences.\n\n295\n00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.054\nI personally like that, but\nyou could if you wanted to.\n\n296\n00:15:56.054 --> 00:16:02.109\nThe one that I have is in the math auto\ncorrect, not necessarily in PowerPoint but\n\n297\n00:16:02.109 --> 00:16:07.449\nI use a lot of when I'm typing out notes\nto Have like you wanna go to File,\n\n298\n00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:12.660\nthen Save then whatever,\nI use the dash and greater than sign.\n\n299\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Greater than, yep.\n\n300\n00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.184\n&gt;&gt; And it always makes that error,\nit drives me crazy, and I like,\n\n301\n00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.324\nstop doing that,\nI don't want it to do that.\n\n302\n00:16:18.324 --> 00:16:21.380\nSo it's in the math auto-correct options.\n\n303\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.146\nIt's all the way towards the bottom,\nit's right there, so\n\n304\n00:16:24.146 --> 00:16:26.330\nyou can have it stop doing\nthat if you wanted to.\n\n305\n00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.545\nSo that was just a big one of mine.\n\n306\n00:16:28.545 --> 00:16:30.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a personal thing, but\n\n307\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.840\nthat's just how it goes.\n\n308\n00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.946\nThe other thing right here would\nbe your custom dictionaries,\n\n309\n00:16:34.946 --> 00:16:39.118\nthe words that you want it to remember and\nthe whole roaming custom dictionary here.\n\n310\n00:16:39.118 --> 00:16:41.174\nThis is across all of\nyour office programs.\n\n311\n00:16:41.174 --> 00:16:44.902\nSo if you wanted to, you could go\nright directly to the source, start\n\n312\n00:16:44.902 --> 00:16:50.035\nadding words that you want it to remember\nto stop saying that it's spelled wrong.\n\n313\n00:16:50.035 --> 00:16:53.085\nSo you could always go into that and\ngo into the edit word list.\n\n314\n00:16:53.085 --> 00:16:58.740\nYou can see that it did add my username\nand my computer name right here.\n\n315\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.207\nThat's good, because it always\nsays that Vonne is misspelled, and\n\n316\n00:17:02.207 --> 00:17:05.690\nI always have to go in add, like nope,\nthat's how you spell my name.\n\n317\n00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.570\nAnd you could go ahead and\ngo right from there.\n\n318\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.690\nSo those are some of our proofing options,\nand all the different check boxes.\n\n319\n00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.670\nIf you go down to the next category,\nwhich is Save, you have where when you\n\n320\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.630\ndo a save by default,\nit always goes to a specific place.\n\n321\n00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.280\nIt always goes to your Documents.\n\n322\n00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.870\nAnd there's a lot of times that maybe\nI don't want it to go to my Documents\n\n323\n00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.670\nbecause maybe I have a different folder or\n\n324\n00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.690\nsomewhere else on my computer that\nthat's where I want it to go every time.\n\n325\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:37.440\nYou can change the default file\nlocation of your Save option.\n\n326\n00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.070\nI have always found that to be very,\nvery nice.\n\n327\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:45.130\nYour auto recovery options of how many\nminutes it takes for it to go ahead and\n\n328\n00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.500\ndo that auto save.\n\n329\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.610\nI can tell that has saved me many times\nin my life, where it just goes and\n\n330\n00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.726\nthen like, please be there,\nplease be there.\n\n331\n00:17:52.726 --> 00:17:53.641\nAnd it's there.\n\n332\n00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:55.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And ten minutes is a long time,\n\n333\n00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.152\nyou can do a lot of work in ten minutes.\n\n334\n00:17:58.152 --> 00:18:01.950\nWhen I think about it but if they,\nif all of a sudden the file rolls back\n\n335\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.615\nten minutes, you realize woah\nI just lost a lot of work.\n\n336\n00:18:04.615 --> 00:18:05.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n337\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.580\nshortening that up a little bit can\nhelp if you're not in the habit of\n\n338\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.645\ndoing that Ctrl + S\nevery couple of minutes.\n\n339\n00:18:10.645 --> 00:18:11.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yep.\n\n340\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.730\nKeyboard shortcuts, Ctrl +S,\nCtrl +S, Ctrl +S, lots.\n\n341\n00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.812\nI've been burned on that a couple times,\nnot necessarily in Office products cuz it\n\n342\n00:18:17.812 --> 00:18:21.367\ndoes have that auto recovery in place but\nsome other ones I think, yeah,\n\n343\n00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:24.726\na whole hour of Illustrator and\nthen the laptop died and it's gone.\n\n344\n00:18:24.726 --> 00:18:27.048\nThat was a bad day [LAUGH].\n\n345\n00:18:27.048 --> 00:18:30.060\nYeah, so definitely keep saving.\n\n346\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.020\nAll right, so we are gonna go down\nthrough the language options,\n\n347\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.620\nI can tell you that I don't speak\nanything other than English.\n\n348\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.360\nSo, but you do have other options of\n\n349\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.050\nadding languages that you might\nuse within your Office products.\n\n350\n00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.216\nSo this is definitely the place to\ngo where you could add the different\n\n351\n00:18:46.216 --> 00:18:51.040\nspellings and letters and-\n&gt;&gt; Do\n\n352\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.170\nthe grammar checking,\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n353\n00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.790\n&gt;&gt; And sorting, especially with those\ncharacters that have an umlaut over it or\n\n354\n00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.570\nsomething like that.\n\n355\n00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.713\nHow is that supposed to sort?\n\n356\n00:18:58.713 --> 00:19:02.656\nAnd in a multinational organization\nwhere you might be dealing with that,\n\n357\n00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:06.804\nvery nice to be able to configure Office\nto understand more than one language.\n\n358\n00:19:06.804 --> 00:19:07.450\n&gt;&gt;

Too many times.\n\n393\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nlet me demonstrate it really quickly.\n\n394\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.510\nSo, I'm going to go here, I'm gonna zoom\nin a little bit so you can see this.\n\n395\n00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:45.660\nThe allowing drag and drop it's where if\nyou are over a selected amount of text and\n\n396\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.050\nyou start dragging your mouse,\nyou see that grey line that pops up and\n\n397\n00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.710\nif I let go right now it's\nactually gonna move that text.\n\n398\n00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.760\nAnd if I get going really fast and\nI'm selecting something and\n\n399\n00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.600\nI thought I was off of it and\nI'm trying to deselect and\n\n400\n00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.330\nmove somewhere else or reselect the text,\nthat's where it always gets me.\n\n401\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.830\nAnd then I'm moving it, I'm like.\n\n402\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.440\nAnd I've thought it throws people off.\n\n403\n00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.340\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's really because like what did I do?\n\n404\n00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the drag and drop text,\n\n405\n00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:13.658\nwhile it can be handy,\n\n406\n00:21:13.658 --> 00:21:17.664\nif that's what you wanted to do, if it's\na little bit of a distraction to me.\n\n407\n00:21:17.664 --> 00:21:19.781\n&gt;&gt; It's the same with me,\nI mean I can cut and paste, so\n\n408\n00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:21.528\nI've got my keyboard shortcuts for that.\n\n409\n00:21:21.528 --> 00:21:25.406\nSo if I need to move it, I've got other\nways of moving it, this one seems to\n\n410\n00:21:25.406 --> 00:21:28.993\nhappen when I'm not really trying to\ndo that so I like to turn it off.\n\n411\n00:21:28.993 --> 00:21:34.240\nBut I do know people who love that feature\nand they're constantly rearranging text.\n\n412\n00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.069\nAnd it's a little bit easier than having\nto cut it, select it, copy it, paste it,\n\n413\n00:21:38.069 --> 00:21:38.962\nthings like that.\n\n414\n00:21:38.962 --> 00:21:40.099\nSo some people might like it.\n\n415\n00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:42.169\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it has its merits.\n\n416\n00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.770\nIt's just something that I\ndon't particularly like.\n\n417\n00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.220\nAnd that's, of course,\nthe whole reason for\n\n418\n00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.360\nthis episode is to show all the different\nthings that happen within your PowerPoint\n\n419\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.380\nenvironment that you might not like.\n\n420\n00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:58.200\nSo let's go back over to our account\ncuz we went over the advanced.\n\n421\n00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.730\nThe two parts that I wanted\nto show you was the undo and\n\n422\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.305\nthe allow text to be dragged and dropped.\n\n423\n00:22:03.305 --> 00:22:06.380\nBut you can see,\nthere's a lot of other ones,\n\n424\n00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.630\nlike in a slide show,\nlike the pop up toolbar.\n\n425\n00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.740\nI like the pop up toolbar,\nI don't want that to really go away.\n\n426\n00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:17.350\nMaybe you don't want it to end with\nthe black slide, you can turn it off,\n\n427\n00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.930\n&gt;&gt; We were talking about that in our\n\n428\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:23.270\nprevious series, where if you're giving a\npresentation and the only light is coming\n\n429\n00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:28.210\nfrom your presentation in a dark\nauditorium, if the last slide\n\n430\n00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:32.600\nis black and you click to it everything\ngets dark, people trip, whatever.\n\n431\n00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.261\nWhereas if the last slide was a little\nbit lighter, at least there might be some\n\n432\n00:22:35.261 --> 00:22:37.257\nlight in there before somebody\ncan find the light switch.\n\n433\n00:22:37.257 --> 00:22:39.536\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a perfect example\nbecause I'm thinking like,\n\n434\n00:22:39.536 --> 00:22:41.264\nwhy would you not want to\nend with a black slide?\n\n435\n00:22:41.264 --> 00:22:42.366\nThat's just what PowerPoint does.\n\n436\n00:22:42.366 --> 00:22:43.637\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n437\n00:22:43.637 --> 00:22:44.680\nyou can make it a bit different so.\n\n438\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n439\n00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.280\n&gt;&gt; So that's a great example of why\nyou might want to not have that done.\n\n440\n00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nVonne, I tell you what,\n\n441\n00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.120\nI know we've got a lot of additional\noptions to go through there, but\n\n442\n00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.930\nunfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n443\n00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.400\nSo why don't we stop there,\nand we'll do a part two.\n\n444\n00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.480\nWe'll come back and we'll continue to\ngo through the rest of these options.\n\n445\n00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.110\nSound like a plan?\n\n446\n00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.060\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n447\n00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.540\nAll right, well, ladies and gentleman,\nyou heard it, we're gonna call it here.\n\n448\n00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.490\nWe're gonna come back with a part\ntwo on customizing your interface.\n\n449\n00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.760\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n450\n00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.420\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n451\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.545\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n452\n00:23:17.251 --> 00:23:23.103\n[MUSIC]\n\n453\n00:23:23.103 --> 00:23:26.075\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:15.290\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.239\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our advanced PowerPoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.753\nAnd in this episode, we're actually\ncontinuing our thought process on,\n\n8\n00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:27.610\nthis is a part two and customizing\nyour user interface within PowerPoint.\n\n9\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.470\nSo if you missed that first part,\nmake sure you go back and\n\n10\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.210\nwatch that, otherwise we're\njump right back into it and\n\n11\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.870\nhere to show us the way is none\nother than Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n12\n00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.562\nWelcome back Vonne.\n\n13\n00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:39.392\n&gt;&gt; Hello, yes,\nwe left off on the advanced options,\n\n14\n00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:42.609\nI believe within our PowerPoint options.\n\n15\n00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.260\nSo like he said, let's just go ahead and\njump right back in And get started.\n\n16\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.705\nI actually didn't even\nreally change the screen.\n\n17\n00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:51.187\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're back here on Advanced and\n\n18\n00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:54.892\nwe had left off just going\nover our black slide, right?\n\n19\n00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:55.543\n&gt;&gt; Yup that's right.\n\n20\n00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:59.103\nYes, and while we're here I do have\na when printing this document,\n\n21\n00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:02.787\nit might be one of those things that\nevery time you go to print you always\n\n22\n00:01:02.787 --> 00:01:06.860\nhave to change the settings back to\nwhatever you had wanted it to be.\n\n23\n00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.490\nSo you could go ahead and create your\ndefault printing settings of like,\n\n24\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.620\nyou always want it to print the notes.\n\n25\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.910\nAnd you always want it to print\nin grayscale and not in color.\n\n26\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.170\nSo you could go ahead and set that there.\n\n27\n00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.021\nIt does have the use most\nrecently used print settings.\n\n28\n00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:24.101\nSo if you keep using the same ones,\nyou might not ever notice that,\n\n29\n00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:27.900\nbecause it's always back to the way you\nhad it last, because that is the default.\n\n30\n00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.623\nBut while I was here,\nI figured I'd point it out to you guys.\n\n31\n00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Vonne, all right.\n\n32\n00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770\nSo what's next on our list of options?\n\n33\n00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nwe'll keep going down that left hand side.\n\n34\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.752\nAnd we're gonna get into the customizing\nthe ribbon and the quick access tool bar.\n\n35\n00:01:39.752 --> 00:01:45.420\nI've kinda put those both together\nbecause they are used for\n\n36\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.690\ncreating and customizing all the different\ncommands that are on that top area\n\n37\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.550\nof your PowerPoint environment.\n\n38\n00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.430\nAnd a quick access toolbar is\nsomewhere where we went in the first\n\n39\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.390\nseries of PowerPoint.\n\n40\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.670\nWhere we went ahead added some\nof those buttons along the top.\n\n41\n00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.200\nAnd let's just quickly show\nus that this right here,\n\n42\n00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.950\nthis is a quick access toolbar.\n\n43\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.119\nSo we went into the Customizing settings.\n\n44\n00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.419\nFrom the actual toolbar itself,\nwe went into more commands and\n\n45\n00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:15.856\nit automatically brought\nus to this section.\n\n46\n00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.597\nWhere we could go ahead and\n\n47\n00:02:17.597 --> 00:02:21.801\nadd commands that we wanted to\nquickly access on that toolbar.\n\n48\n00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:25.218\nAnd, if you wanted to add say,\ncheck spelling, that,\n\n49\n00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:28.144\nI was just making sure\nthat wasn't over there.\n\n50\n00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:32.053\n[LAUGH] You wanted to add the check\nthe spelling because I always need to run\n\n51\n00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:33.830\na spell check.\n\n52\n00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.310\nYou have to remember what tab\non the ribbon that command\n\n53\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.960\nlives in cuz it might not be in\nthe popular commands that is\n\n54\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.870\nshowed by default in the customizing\nquick access tool bar.\n\n55\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.206\nSo up at the top.\n\n56\n00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:52.710\nYou can go into which tab or\n\n57\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.330\nwhere it actually appears within your\nribbon, and then you can go from there.\n\n58\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.390\nI know that the spell check is in\n\n59\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.190\nthe review tab and where is that?\n\n60\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.490\nThere it is.\n[LAUGH] My God, I don't see it.\n\n61\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.420\nI know it's on the review\ncome on find the review.\n\n62\n00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.510\nSo you can go down here to the spell\ncheck which is right there,\n\n63\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.320\ncheck spelling and I can add it and then\nit moves over to my quick access toolbar.\n\n64\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.966\nAnd the other thing that you can point out\nis that if you wanted to reset this cuz\n\n65\n00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:28.628\nmaybe you've gotten this all kinda crazy.\n\n66\n00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:31.410\nAnd you're like can we just\ngo back to where it was,\n\n67\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.730\ncuz I don't remember where I began.\n\n68\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.340\nYou can always go ahead and\nclick that Reset down here.\n\n69\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.920\nAnd notice that it is going\nto give us the option for\n\n70\n00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.330\nReset only the quick access tool bar,\nor reset all customizations.\n\n71\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.430\nAnd that could be for\nany of the things with your ribbons,\n\n72\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.590\nwhich we're going to get into.\n\n73\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.399\nAnd it's gonna remove everything.\n\n74\n00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:54.228\nSo you do to be a little careful\nabout which one do I want to do?\n\n75\n00:03:54.228 --> 00:03:59.156\nSo if I say only the Quick Access\nToolbar It will go ahead and\n\n76\n00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:04.597\nbring it back to where the default\noptions were on that toolbar.\n\n77\n00:04:04.597 --> 00:04:08.545\n&gt;&gt; I also like the option that that filter\nlist up there, there was one option for\n\n78\n00:04:08.545 --> 00:04:09.358\nall commands.\n\n79\n00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:14.440\nCuz like me, I can't remember, was\nthe spell check on the review ribbon or\n\n80\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.682\non the developer ribbon or\nwhere the heck is it?\n\n81\n00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:18.940\nI just go to all commands.\n\n82\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.000\nAnd it's a longer list.\n\n83\n00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.870\nIt takes me a little\nlonger to get through, but\n\n84\n00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.460\nat least I know it's in there\nsomewhere cuz that's all commands.\n\n85\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.831\n&gt;&gt; Yes, good point.\n\n86\n00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.100\nWhen I was going I was like,\nso it's on the review tab.\n\n87\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.971\nI know it's on the review.\n\n88\n00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:29.832\nAnd then I started questioning myself.\n\n89\n00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:31.130\nIs it on the review tab?\n\n90\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.080\nI dont remember.\n\n91\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.611\nSo yes, all commands is a great\nway to just show everything and\n\n92\n00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:40.195\nyou can figure out what\nyou want to do from there.\n\n93\n00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:43.785\nSo quick access toolbar,\nnice little toolbar at the beginning,\n\n94\n00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:44.839\nat the beginning?\n\n95\n00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:45.393\nAt the top.\n\n96\n00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:46.102\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n97\n00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:46.968\n&gt;&gt; Of our environment.\n\n98\n00:04:46.968 --> 00:04:48.583\nBut what about those ribbons?\n\n99\n00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:49.924\nLet's go ahead and cancel.\n\n100\n00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:53.164\nYou have your regular\ntabs across the ribbons,\n\n101\n00:04:53.164 --> 00:04:56.571\nyour Home, your Transitions,\nyour slide show.\n\n102\n00:04:56.571 --> 00:05:01.780\nIf you wanted to, you could create\nyour own tab on the ribbon.\n\n103\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.300\nAnd that's where you can put\neverything that you've ever used.\n\n104\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.608\nMaybe you're always using\nthe same commands, and\n\n105\n00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:11.431\ninstead of switching back and forth, back\nand forth through each one of these tabs?\n\n106\n00:05:11.431 --> 00:05:16.430\nYou can make your own, and\nput any command that you want on that.\n\n107\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.476\nPointing out here on your tabs on your\nribbons, you do have your groups, so\n\n108\n00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:23.961\nyou see in the insert you have tables,\nimages, illustration.\n\n109\n00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:28.291\nAnd I'm just pointing that out because\nonce we get into the customizing of it,\n\n110\n00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.831\nyou do have to know that that\nterminology of what is a group name,\n\n111\n00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.100\nbefore you get going.\n\n112\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.000\nSo let's go back over here to File,\n\n113\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.940\nand let's go into Options again,\nwe're gonna go into Customize.\n\n114\n00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.030\nThe not the, yes customize the ribbon.\n\n115\n00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.113\nSorry like which one are we doing?\n\n116\n00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:44.840\nYes, we are doing the ribbon.\n\n117\n00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.410\nOver here you have, these are the main\ntabs that are across the ribbon and\n\n118\n00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.600\nif you wanted to add your own\ntab down here at the bottom,\n\n119\n00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.680\nyou could see that you have new tabs.\n\n120\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.970\nSo we're going to create that.\n\n121\n00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:04.845\nAnd it adds in a new tab,\nnow I have the new tab here and\n\n122\n00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:06.919\nI have the new group here.\n\n123\n00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.030\nIf you wanted to rename the group or\nthe tab, you just gonna make\n\n124\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.280\nsure that your on the right part within\nthis list to click the Rename button.\n\n125\n00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.950\nSo I'm gonna start at the tab first.\n\n126\n00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.243\nAnd I'm going to click the Rename, and\nI'm just gonna go ahead and put in Vonne,\n\n127\n00:06:25.243 --> 00:06:26.390\ncuz that's who I am.\n\n128\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.301\nAnd I want all of my stuff there.\n\n129\n00:06:28.301 --> 00:06:30.990\nSo I'll click OK, and I've renamed that.\n\n130\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.505\nAnd if I go ahead and\nstart trying to put in a command, so\n\n131\n00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:37.445\nover here on the left-hand side, you could\nsee that I have all the different commands\n\n132\n00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:41.221\nthat are in there, and then that's maybe\nwhere we should go to that all commands so\n\n133\n00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:43.281\nI can just have the entire list there for\nme.\n\n134\n00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:44.854\nAnd everything is in here.\n\n135\n00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:47.665\nAnd I'm just gonna randomly pick things,\nhonestly.\n\n136\n00:06:47.665 --> 00:06:49.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So maybe I want the arrow down,\n\n137\n00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.829\ncuz that's definitely a shape\nthat I'm gonna be doing.\n\n138\n00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.745\nI can click on that and click on the Add.\n\n139\n00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:56.860\nYou will get a warning, though.\n\n140\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.110\nThat's why I wanted to point\nout that group, it says,\n\n141\n00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.230\nI can't add a command\nunless I'm in a group.\n\n142\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.900\nBecause I was on the tab name, so you need\nto make sure you're in that group, and\n\n143\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.995\nit always defaults to giving\nyou at least one group.\n\n144\n00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:14.512\nSo make sure that you're there before\nyou start adding the commands.\n\n145\n00:07:14.512 --> 00:07:16.220\nSo now that I'm here.\n\n146\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.530\nI click here on the command that I want to\nthen add, and it goes into that new group.\n\n147\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.952\nI can go ahead and rename this,\nand I can name it My Commands.\n\n148\n00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:30.250\nI can give it a little picture,\nhow about a little piggy.\n\n149\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.572\nIt doesn't really show up but,\n[LAUGH] It's there.\n\n150\n00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:34.521\nAnd so now I could go ahead and\n\n151\n00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:38.510\nthen keep on adding as many\ndifferent options that I want.\n\n152\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.130\nAgain I'm randomly picking.\n\n153\n00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.772\nI'm just click, click, click, I don't\nknow really know what I'm even adding.\n\n154\n00:07:44.772 --> 00:07:47.880\n[LAUGH] But I'm just trying to show\nyou that you can find the command.\n\n155\n00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.179\nYou add it over in your\ngroup within your ribbon.\n\n156\n00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:55.737\nIf you wanted to add another\ngroup to start organizing things,\n\n157\n00:07:55.737 --> 00:08:01.413\nyou're more than welcome to add another\ngroup and then continue to add More and\n\n158\n00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:06.315\nmore commands and then once you got\nyour commands you can go ahead and\n\n159\n00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:09.422\nclick OK, and across there, there it is.\n\n160\n00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:13.680\nAll of my buttons, all of my commands\nI wanted in my own special tab on\n\n161\n00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.221\nthe ribbon I'm feeling very,\nvery special right now.\n\n162\n00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:18.404\n&gt;&gt; It does make you feel yeah.\n\n163\n00:08:18.404 --> 00:08:20.190\n&gt;&gt; It's my PowerPoint.\n&gt;&gt; It does make you feel special,\n\n164\n00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.160\nthe other cool thing I think we should\npoint out is you can take commands that\n\n165\n00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.630\nare already on other\nribbons it's not like they.\n\n166\n00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:29.685\nIf they're in on another ribbon,\nyou can't add them.\n\n167\n00:08:29.685 --> 00:08:32.155\nCuz there's lots of commands,\nthere's a few commands,\n\n168\n00:08:32.155 --> 00:08:34.475\nif I can speak,\nfrom the Home Ribbon that I use a lot.\n\n169\n00:08:34.475 --> 00:08:37.185\nThere's a few from\nthe Developer I use a lot.\n\n170\n00:08:37.185 --> 00:08:39.468\nAnd I have to go back and\nforth between those Ribbons.\n\n171\n00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:42.965\nBut now I can create my own ribbon,\nput all the tools in one place, and\n\n172\n00:08:42.965 --> 00:08:45.452\npretty much live right\nthere on that one ribbon.\n\n173\n00:08:45.452 --> 00:08:47.665\nIt's great that Microsoft\ngave us the ability.\n\n174\n00:08:47.665 --> 00:08:50.915\nCuz remember in 2003 when it first came\nout, you couldn't modify the ribbons\n\n175\n00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:53.340\nwithout knowing code and\nbeing able to write this stuff.\n\n176\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.131\nIt's really easy to do now.\n\n177\n00:08:55.131 --> 00:08:57.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah I like it,\nI think it's very handy.\n\n178\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.160\nAnd again just overall, customizing\nit to the way you want to work.\n\n179\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.570\nAnd you might not even think that you\nwould ever want this when you first start\n\n180\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:06.270\nout I know I did.\n\n181\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.890\nI just need to learn the program and\nI'm just gonna learn it as is.\n\n182\n00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.350\nBut as you start getting into it and\ndoing it a lot.\n\n183\n00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.690\nYou have your own work flow and\nyou know that if I could just\n\n184\n00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.080\nhave all of these things in one place,\nI could work so much faster.\n\n185\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.240\nAnd so once you start getting\nmore comfortable overall.\n\n186\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.093\nThen that's where you might want to start\nventuring out and making it your own.\n\n187\n00:09:28.093 --> 00:09:32.165\nAnd really kind of having it work for\nyou, instead of you work for it.\n\n188\n00:09:32.165 --> 00:09:32.665\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:09:32.665 --> 00:09:34.505\n&gt;&gt; Awesome so it's great.\n\n190\n00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:36.665\nAnd the order in which the tab comes up,\n\n191\n00:09:36.665 --> 00:09:40.060\nyou can see here, that it went Home,\nInsert, then my name.\n\n192\n00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.181\nYou could always change it if you\nwent back into those options and\n\n193\n00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:46.176\ninto the customizing ribbon.\n\n194\n00:09:46.176 --> 00:09:47.352\nYou can see that right here.\n\n195\n00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:49.550\nI can use the little bumpy arrows.\n\n196\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.598\nTechnical term, bumpy arrows.\n\n197\n00:09:50.598 --> 00:09:53.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can move this up to the different\n\n198\n00:09:53.522 --> 00:09:55.445\nplaces that I want it to go,\n\n199\n00:09:55.445 --> 00:09:59.809\nor maybe I want it to go down\na little bit further past the view.\n\n200\n00:09:59.809 --> 00:10:04.339\nThere is a developer ribbon that\nis not on or developer tab,\n\n201\n00:10:04.339 --> 00:10:07.970\nsorry, on the ribbon that\nis not on by default.\n\n202\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.760\nI actually heard you said that when you,\nI use things on the developer.\n\n203\n00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.486\nAnd I was like,\nthey probably don't know what that is yet.\n\n204\n00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:16.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well that's great, great lead-in.\n\n205\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:21.300\nSo you can see that if you turn on\nthe developer tab and you click OK,\n\n206\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.580\nthese are what you'd start\ngetting into your macros and\n\n207\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.980\ndifferent things that you can\ndo to create actions with it.\n\n208\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.770\nWhat is a macro?\n\n209\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.600\nSo a macro is a small\nbit of programming code.\n\n210\n00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.597\n&gt;&gt; Right a little VVA.\n\n211\n00:10:36.597 --> 00:10:38.048\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nyes you know a lot of it don't you?\n\n212\n00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:39.364\n&gt;&gt; A little bit.\n\n213\n00:10:39.364 --> 00:10:39.909\n&gt;&gt; So I'm glad you're at my house today.\n\n214\n00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:45.039\n[LAUGH] It's basically like a recorded\nnumber of steps that you can\n\n215\n00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:50.353\nbe able to play back and to be able\nto automate some of your things that\n\n216\n00:10:50.353 --> 00:10:55.785\nyou do within any of your programs and\nwhether it's in a PowerPoint.\n\n217\n00:10:55.785 --> 00:10:59.530\nThis is across all the Office products,\nso if I wanted to always,\n\n218\n00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.881\nI always default back to Word\nwhen I think of that cuz like.\n\n219\n00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:05.970\nI always wanted to turn portrait or\nturn it landscape and\n\n220\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.910\nthen change my margins and then add\nthis particular header and footer.\n\n221\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.355\nAnd there's things that I always,\nalways do.\n\n222\n00:11:11.355 --> 00:11:14.101\nWhen I set up little documents for\nwhatever I'm working in.\n\n223\n00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:16.915\nAnd if I could just have a little\nbutton that I can click on and\n\n224\n00:11:16.915 --> 00:11:19.920\njust have it do everything,\nthat would be so much easier.\n\n225\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.470\nThat's where you can go into your macros.\n\n226\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.821\nNow of course, when you start writing\nmacros, you are writing code.\n\n227\n00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:29.714\nAnd any time you start writing code that\ncan be part of a file that's where you\n\n228\n00:11:29.714 --> 00:11:33.920\ncan start getting into some security\nissues or some trust issue,\n\n229\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.840\nwhich we're actually going to\nbe going into in a little bit.\n\n230\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.506\nBut I did wanna pull up that developer\nTab, fortunately it does exist in\n\n231\n00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:44.683\nPowerPoint just like some of\nyour other Office products, and\n\n232\n00:11:44.683 --> 00:11:46.289\nyou can start adding it there.\n\n233\n00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:50.197\n&gt;&gt; And we can have more than one\ncustom tab if we want, right?\n\n234\n00:11:50.197 --> 00:11:51.910\nFor different projects that we work on?\n\n235\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.730\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, you can add as\nmany tabs as you want, really.\n\n236\n00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.820\nAnd because you saw that developer\ntab was not on, by default I had to\n\n237\n00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.670\ncheck the box of if for some reason\nyou never wanna use the design tab.\n\n238\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.913\nI'm not really sure why you would want\nto turn it off, [LAUGH] But you could.\n\n239\n00:12:05.913 --> 00:12:09.908\n&gt;&gt; What if I made the only use two to\nthree commands from that draw tab.\n\n240\n00:12:09.908 --> 00:12:12.652\nAnd so I've taken those two,\nthree commands that I use and\n\n241\n00:12:12.652 --> 00:12:13.996\nput them on a custom ribbon.\n\n242\n00:12:13.996 --> 00:12:17.142\nI can turn the draw tab off now,\nI don't need to look at it anymore.\n\n243\n00:12:17.142 --> 00:12:20.341\nI can use my custom ribbon that\nhas just the tools that I use.\n\n244\n00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:25.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can do anything that\nyou want to make your life easier.\n\n245\n00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.324\nTurn off tabs, turn on tabs,\nmake your own tabs,\n\n246\n00:12:28.324 --> 00:12:31.621\nyou could keep on going until\nthe cows come home, I guess.\n\n247\n00:12:31.621 --> 00:12:32.462\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n248\n00:12:32.462 --> 00:12:35.587\n&gt;&gt; And make it to how I want this product\n\n249\n00:12:35.587 --> 00:12:36.948\nto work for me.\n\n250\n00:12:36.948 --> 00:12:38.386\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n251\n00:12:38.386 --> 00:12:45.333\n&gt;&gt; And moving on from that developer tab\nand talking about the macros in here,\n\n252\n00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:50.860\nperfect segue into the options\nof the trust center in here.\n\n253\n00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.630\nSo when I think of trust center it's my\n\n254\n00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.282\ncenterplace of where I'm going to\ndetermine who I trust and who I don't.\n\n255\n00:12:58.282 --> 00:13:00.802\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And about those macros,\n\n256\n00:13:00.802 --> 00:13:07.370\nIf Mike created a PowerPoint or any type\nof document that did have macros in there.\n\n257\n00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.604\nIf he sends it to me and I open it, it's\ngonna always give me that warning of hey,\n\n258\n00:13:12.604 --> 00:13:18.092\nthere's something going on in this file\nthat could be a potential problem for you.\n\n259\n00:13:18.092 --> 00:13:21.422\nAnd if you've ever seen those maybe it's\nscared you enough to where you're like I'm\n\n260\n00:13:21.422 --> 00:13:23.140\nnot gonna open this file this is bad.\n\n261\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.495\nBut I know Mike and I know that\nhe's not gonna write malicious code\n\n262\n00:13:26.495 --> 00:13:30.653\nthat's going to do something wrong to my\ncomputer, he is somebody that I trust.\n\n263\n00:13:30.653 --> 00:13:31.900\nWhich is not saying much.\n\n264\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.190\n[LAUGH] We go a way back.\n\n265\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.950\nBut yeah, so\n\n266\n00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.181\nthose are things that you can set here\nin the Trust Center of PowerPoint.\n\n267\n00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:44.442\nTo say, if I ever get a file from Mike,\ngo ahead and\n\n268\n00:13:44.442 --> 00:13:50.345\nstop giving me that warning and\nlet him in, or maybe a certain space.\n\n269\n00:13:50.345 --> 00:13:51.613\nIs that an accurate description?\n\n270\n00:13:51.613 --> 00:13:55.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz when we're talking\nabout macros and Visual Basic, and\n\n271\n00:13:55.015 --> 00:13:58.233\nI know we're not getting into VBA here But\nthe one thing that you\n\n272\n00:13:58.233 --> 00:14:02.563\nwanna remember is that those macros, that\nlanguage, is a very powerful language.\n\n273\n00:14:02.563 --> 00:14:06.100\nIt's really what the Office\nprograms themselves are written in.\n\n274\n00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.540\nSo with VBA, I can do a lot\nmore than just change a font.\n\n275\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.960\nWe could access the file\nsystem on the computer,\n\n276\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.130\nwe can issue operating system commands and\nthings like that.\n\n277\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:24.628\nSo if a macro could potentially be a virus\nand can do very bad things to your system.\n\n278\n00:14:24.628 --> 00:14:29.568\nSo you wanna be careful with who you're\naccepting any type of Office document that\n\n279\n00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:30.980\nhas a macro in it.\n\n280\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.026\nIf you don't know the people, if you\ndon't trust who they are you should block\n\n281\n00:14:35.026 --> 00:14:38.171\nthe macros because of the power\nthat they potentially have.\n\n282\n00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:40.740\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nI always default it to Mike for\n\n283\n00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.175\nsecurity cuz he goes way far in security.\n\n284\n00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:46.783\nI mean, if you've watched any other\nepisodes in our course library, I mean.\n\n285\n00:14:46.783 --> 00:14:48.505\nYou've got some serious\ncertifications in there.\n\n286\n00:14:48.505 --> 00:14:50.045\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I babble a little bit about\n\n287\n00:14:50.045 --> 00:14:51.770\nthe security side of things.\n\n288\n00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm actually glad that you're\nmy host for this particular episode,\n\n289\n00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.280\nbecause when I was, I was like,\nis that right, Mike?\n\n290\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.325\nBecause I know you know\na lot about this stuff.\n\n291\n00:14:58.325 --> 00:14:59.772\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if we do go through some of\n\n292\n00:14:59.772 --> 00:15:03.415\nthe Trust Center settings, if you\ndon't mind, how about I pull it up and\n\n293\n00:15:03.415 --> 00:15:04.969\nmaybe point out anything-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n294\n00:15:04.969 --> 00:15:09.245\n&gt;&gt; Else that people should maybe look for\nif you wanted to go ahead and\n\n295\n00:15:09.245 --> 00:15:11.356\nchange some of these settings.\n\n296\n00:15:11.356 --> 00:15:14.460\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\npull this up and you lead the way.\n\n297\n00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.955\n&gt;&gt; Some organizations don't use macros at\nall, and so they're blocked by default.\n\n298\n00:15:18.955 --> 00:15:20.600\nOffice does that to keep us safe.\n\n299\n00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.335\nAnd so you can just never\nmess with these settings and\n\n300\n00:15:23.335 --> 00:15:26.628\nthen the occasion that you get one\nwith a macro, you can click on\n\n301\n00:15:26.628 --> 00:15:30.377\nthe yellow bar that pops up and\nsays Enable or allow these macros to run.\n\n302\n00:15:30.377 --> 00:15:33.758\nBut if your organization or\nyou use macros a lot,\n\n303\n00:15:33.758 --> 00:15:39.453\nit gets a little tedious where every time\nI open up that PowerPoint presentation,\n\n304\n00:15:39.453 --> 00:15:42.603\nI have to say yes,\nallow these Macros to run.\n\n305\n00:15:42.603 --> 00:15:48.570\nSo what I can do in PowerPoint is say look\nI'm gonna tell you which ones to trust.\n\n306\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.896\nDon't bother prompting me\nanymore at least on this.\n\n307\n00:15:51.896 --> 00:15:53.006\nWe're not gonna try it all together.\n\n308\n00:15:53.006 --> 00:15:55.949\nWe're gonna allow PowerPoint to do\nits thing and block macros normally.\n\n309\n00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:59.654\nBut we're gonna specify\ncertain either individuals or\n\n310\n00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:04.558\nlocations That we're gonna say anything\nfrom here, go ahead and trust.\n\n311\n00:16:04.558 --> 00:16:06.148\nSo, as Vonne pulls up that screen,\n\n312\n00:16:06.148 --> 00:16:09.070\nI think you've already clicked\nit on the Trust Center Settings.\n\n313\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.840\nAnd let's just go up to the top there,\nyou're gonna trust a publications,\n\n314\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.805\nor trusted publishers,\nthis is if you're organization or\n\n315\n00:16:14.805 --> 00:16:19.075\npeople you work with digitally\nsign their documents.\n\n316\n00:16:19.075 --> 00:16:21.745\nSo, there's gonna be a certificate\nassociated with that.\n\n317\n00:16:21.745 --> 00:16:27.235\nAnd I can say look, any PowerPoint\npresentation that's signed by company XYZ,\n\n318\n00:16:27.235 --> 00:16:28.265\ngo ahead and trust it.\n\n319\n00:16:28.265 --> 00:16:30.205\nI trust them, we're good to go.\n\n320\n00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:31.935\nThe next one down is locations, and\n\n321\n00:16:31.935 --> 00:16:34.990\nhere I can say I've got\na folder on my hard drive.\n\n322\n00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:38.580\nThat I put all of my PowerPoints\nthat have macros in them.\n\n323\n00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.550\nAnd anything I put in\nthat folder don't block.\n\n324\n00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:47.100\nThose are mine, I trust them and so we're\ngonna allow this location to be trusted.\n\n325\n00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.460\nYou can do network locations\nwith that trusted locations, but\n\n326\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.192\nyou do wanna be careful with that option,\nright?\n\n327\n00:16:54.192 --> 00:16:57.940\nIf I add a folder from my own hard drive,\nwell I know\n\n328\n00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.910\nwhat contents going into that folder\nbecause it's my folder on my computer.\n\n329\n00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.110\nSo I can trust it with confidence.\n\n330\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.670\nBut if I'm doing a shared folder\non the network other people\n\n331\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.270\ncan save files to that location, as well.\n\n332\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.610\nAnd now, when I trust that network\nlocation, I'm not just trusting me and\n\n333\n00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:14.810\nmy documents.\n\n334\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.720\nI'm trusting anything anybody else\nputs in that shared location,\n\n335\n00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.880\nso something to keep in mind, right?\n\n336\n00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.250\nIf you trust everybody in your\norganization, which typically we do,\n\n337\n00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.740\nyou don't have a problem with that.\n\n338\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.680\nBut it is something you wanna think about,\nright?\n\n339\n00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.380\nA disgruntled employee could\ntry to put a document up there\n\n340\n00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.930\nthat had a macro in it that did\nbad things, if you go up there.\n\n341\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.260\nSo, that's what the trusted\nlocation is for.\n\n342\n00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260\n&gt;&gt; And we're talking about that if\nyou're in an organization that even has\n\n343\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.620\nshared network drives.\n\n344\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if you're in a home office that's\n\n345\n00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:46.230\njust you and maybe a friend or\noff to the side,\n\n346\n00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.930\nthat's the person who's\nsitting right next to me.\n\n347\n00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.730\nYou don't even have, shared drive.\n\n348\n00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.980\nSo that's just something I wanna point\nout that the larger organizations,\n\n349\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.630\nI mean the last place I worked at\nin a large university, we had,\n\n350\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.060\nthere was drives upon,\ndrives upon, drives.\n\n351\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.840\nI mean there's always different\nplaces where you can go, so.\n\n352\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.680\nIn a large network environment,\nthat's what you're talking about.\n\n353\n00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.400\n&gt;&gt; Very true,\nnext one down was trusted documents, and\n\n354\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.550\nthis is pretty straightforward.\n\n355\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:13.040\nIt's, I'm gonna trust this one individual\ndocument and you can just add.\n\n356\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.780\nMaybe you only have two or\nthree documents that use macros, and\n\n357\n00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.150\nyou don't wanna specify an entire\nfile location or a publisher.\n\n358\n00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.730\nSo you can just say, look,\nI trust this document and this document.\n\n359\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.560\nAnd then those two documents would\nnot prompt you when you open them up.\n\n360\n00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.390\nThe trust ad-in catalogs,\nI think you're gonna talk about ad-ins.\n\n361\n00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.715\nOr we already have, but\nad-ins are kinda like plug-ins.\n\n362\n00:18:32.715 --> 00:18:37.130\nSo we can add functionality to\nthe PowerPoint application and\n\n363\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.950\nso Microsoft, for example,\nhas a catalog of add-ins.\n\n364\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.800\nIf I trust the catalog, then I don't\nhave to trust each individual add-in.\n\n365\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.880\nI can take a look at\nanything from this catalog,\n\n366\n00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.410\nmaybe organization creates\na catalog of add-ins.\n\n367\n00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.730\nI trust the catalog, therefore,\nI don't have to trust each individual one.\n\n368\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.857\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nsince we're on that topic of add-ins.\n\n369\n00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:56.950\nI mean add-ins is exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n370\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.850\nYou're going outside of PowerPoint.\n\n371\n00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.740\nThat you could go into with\nmaybe other companies.\n\n372\n00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.970\nOr other software organizations\ncreate specific programs that you can\n\n373\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.760\nadd into PowerPoint,I mean.\n\n374\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.950\nI remember back in the day, Captivate.\n\n375\n00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:17.360\nIt's an Adobe Product that you could\nenable the PowerPoint Add-In for\n\n376\n00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.030\nthat particular program for Captivate.\n\n377\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.410\nAnd so that way, I had like an actual\ncaptivate ribbon, or a button,\n\n378\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.130\nor something that allowed me that.\n\n379\n00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:29.240\nWhen I was creating\na captivate presentation,\n\n380\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.590\nthen I could use PowerPoint that\nworked seamlessly in with it.\n\n381\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.940\nBut it wasn't from Microsoft,\nit was from Adobe and\n\n382\n00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.820\nso it was one of those\nthings I had to bring in.\n\n383\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.790\nAnd that whole trust issue is,\n\n384\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:47.440\ndo I want to allow this add-in\nto be part of my program?\n\n385\n00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.120\nAnd that's where Microsoft might have\na lot of add-ins that you could use for\n\n386\n00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:52.640\nPowerPoint.\n\n387\n00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.570\nAnd it's the catalog you're saying,\nis that, like.\n\n388\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.700\nIt doesn't matter if what Add-ins is.\n\n389\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.980\nIf it comes from Microsoft go ahead and\nit's safe, we're all good.\n\n390\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So perfect.\n\n391\n00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.529\n&gt;&gt; If we keep going down that list then\nVaughn, I think we've got Add-ins,\n\n392\n00:20:05.529 --> 00:20:06.845\nwe talked about that just now.\n\n393\n00:20:06.845 --> 00:20:10.570\nHow you can save all of them,\nyou can require.\n\n394\n00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.220\nThat they are signed by\na digital certificate,\n\n395\n00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.010\nbelow that you've got your ActiveX.\n\n396\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.380\nDo we still use ActiveX out there?\n\n397\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.476\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask you.\n\n398\n00:20:18.476 --> 00:20:21.802\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n399\n00:20:21.802 --> 00:20:26.804\nActiveX is a way to add a dynamic\ncontent but this clickable things,\n\n400\n00:20:26.804 --> 00:20:30.950\ndrop down lists, so\nif you want to disable all of those.\n\n401\n00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:36.380\nBut again ActiveX controls with their\ncode could access the file system and\n\n402\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.580\na little more.\n\n403\n00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.070\nSo, if one was created maliciously\ncan potentially do bad things.\n\n404\n00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.930\nSo do you wanna disable those?\n\n405\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we're getting in to\nthings like ActiveX things and\n\n406\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.700\n&gt;&gt; Things that I,\n\n407\n00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.320\nI can't remember the last time I've ever\ndone something like that in PowerPoint.\n\n408\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.190\nI mean, we're getting the very\nkind of like advanced,\n\n409\n00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.420\nadvanced areas of things that you\ncan do in Pow, it's available.\n\n410\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.180\nBut it might not be something that every,\n\n411\n00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.150\ncommon person would be using when\nyou're talking about PowerPoint.\n\n412\n00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.527\nSo, if you're starting to go a little,\n[INAUDIBLE] What?\n\n413\n00:21:05.527 --> 00:21:06.541\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:07.120\n&gt;&gt; It's okay so,\n\n415\n00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.120\nI just wanted to kinda point that out,\nbecause I can't remember the last time.\n\n416\n00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.880\nI mean I think we used to do it in Word.\n\n417\n00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; A long time ago.\n\n418\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.940\n&gt;&gt; Typically when you're giving\na presentation, you don't need buttons.\n\n419\n00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.410\nBut you never know, it depends,\nthe PowerPoint can be used for\n\n420\n00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:24.570\na lot of things, I knew a guy that used\nExcel as his Word document creator.\n\n421\n00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.485\nSo, we could use PowerPoint\nto do some strange things.\n\n422\n00:21:27.485 --> 00:21:28.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But I'll go, we'll go for\n\n423\n00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.255\na little bit faster then, macros\nsettings is an important one probably.\n\n424\n00:21:32.255 --> 00:21:35.254\nIf we look there you've got\nfour options the default,\n\n425\n00:21:35.254 --> 00:21:39.752\ndisable all macros with notifications and\nwhat that means is if its not in a trusted\n\n426\n00:21:39.752 --> 00:21:44.600\nlocation if you've downloaded it or it's\nstored somewhere else that's not trusted.\n\n427\n00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.297\nYou're gonna get that yellow bar right\nup at the top of your workspace that's\n\n428\n00:21:49.297 --> 00:21:52.640\ngonna save you wanna allow\nthese macros to run?\n\n429\n00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.370\nThat's what the notification is.\n\n430\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.860\nSo, basically you're saying,\nopen the document up and I'll choose for\n\n431\n00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.570\neach document every time.\n\n432\n00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.590\nDo I wanna allow them, do I not?\n\n433\n00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.520\nThe first option disable auto\nmacros goes without notification.\n\n434\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.510\nSays, I'm gonna block the macros, and\n\n435\n00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.090\nI'm not even gonna give you\na button to enable them.\n\n436\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.110\nYou're just gonna get blocked,\nthey're gonna be blocked, and that's it.\n\n437\n00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.760\nThe third option down there disable\nall macros except digitally signed.\n\n438\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.890\nPretty straight forward there,\nunless the macros not\n\n439\n00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.900\nsigned with a digital certificate\nwe're gonna block them.\n\n440\n00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.110\nEnable all macros, the fourth option.\n\n441\n00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.970\nNot recommended, potentially dangerous\ncode can run, heed that warning.\n\n442\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.200\nCan't think of any reason I would\never wanna choose enable all macros.\n\n443\n00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.920\nIt's basically saying,\nI don't care where the document came from,\n\n444\n00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.530\nI don't care where it's stored,\nI don't care who wrote it.\n\n445\n00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.120\nJust run any macro that you find in it.\n\n446\n00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.230\nDon't bother asking me anything,\nvery, very bad, very dangerous.\n\n447\n00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.280\nMacro viruses are a very common\nway to spread infection,\n\n448\n00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.350\nbecause office, PowerPoint.\n\n449\n00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:58.180\nWe know it's in most business places so,\nthis is a great vector for\n\n450\n00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.242\nthe bad guys to get bad\nthings on your system.\n\n451\n00:23:00.242 --> 00:23:04.050\n&gt;&gt; Kind of against the whole reason why\nwe have trust centers, as well, right?\n\n452\n00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to\n\n453\n00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.260\nopen it up to everybody.\n\n454\n00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.060\nYou do want to control the flow\nof where things are coming from.\n\n455\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you enable that last one,\n\n456\n00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:17.235\nthen your trust center does your trust\ncenter locations mean nothing that way.\n\n457\n00:23:17.235 --> 00:23:18.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The rest of them, like you said Vonner,\n\n458\n00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.440\nprobably ones that might be\nbetter off in another one,\n\n459\n00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:26.250\nbut protected view it tries to\nbasically lock things down.\n\n460\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.660\nIf you downloaded\nsomething from the internet\n\n461\n00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.270\nthen you don't know who it came from, so\nwe'll try to block most stuff in there.\n\n462\n00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.160\nYou can enable the protected the view.\n\n463\n00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.850\nThe message bar,\nthat's the one right up there that will\n\n464\n00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:42.170\ngive you the ability to either yes or\nno allow editing or allow macros.\n\n465\n00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:46.720\nI don't know why you never show\ninformation about blog content.\n\n466\n00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.010\nAnd if you set it to always block, don't\nallow macros at all, then you probably\n\n467\n00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.580\ndon't even want the warning saying,\nhey by the way, I've blocked a macro.\n\n468\n00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.540\nBecause you can't allow them anyway, so\nyou probably just get annoyed with that.\n\n469\n00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.405\nSo you can turn off those warnings there.\n\n470\n00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:04.350\nFile block settings, again,\nthe ability to just block whether or\n\n471\n00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.858\nnot you're allowed to open or\nsave certain types files, privacy options,\n\n472\n00:24:08.858 --> 00:24:12.110\nwhether Microsoft is gonna\ncollect any information.\n\n473\n00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.030\nTypically they leave out personal\ninformation when they're trying to make\n\n474\n00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.350\nthe product better and it gives you\nuse habits, errors that might pop up.\n\n475\n00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:23.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll see that, like if\nyour program decides to stop working.\n\n476\n00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.260\nI've seen that, like we're going to be\nsending information to Microsoft to try\n\n477\n00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.050\nto help us make this not happen any more.\n\n478\n00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:35.397\nThat, I mean for the collective good of\nall of us we should probably keep that on.\n\n479\n00:24:35.397 --> 00:24:37.276\nI know some people might get a little,\n\n480\n00:24:37.276 --> 00:24:40.410\nkinda a little wary about like,\ngosh what are they sending?\n\n481\n00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.130\nEspecially now,\nthis digital age that we're living in and\n\n482\n00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.480\neveryone starts to kind of get a little\nfreaked out about what's out there, and\n\n483\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.900\nwhat people are taking from us.\n\n484\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.950\nBut this isn't a bad thing.\n\n485\n00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, that check mark\nsays send personal information.\n\n486\n00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.100\nSo, what you'll find in the EULA\nwith Microsoft is they can collect\n\n487\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.240\nerror information.\n\n488\n00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.990\nBut it typically doesn't have anything\nthat's unique or personally identifiable.\n\n489\n00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.942\nLike it's not gonna tie back to an\nindividual or a specific computer if you\n\n490\n00:25:05.942 --> 00:25:10.280\ncheck the same personal information in\nMicrosoft to make improvements office,\n\n491\n00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.745\nthen there is this potential like metadata\nfrom your document mine have your name,\n\n492\n00:25:14.745 --> 00:25:15.920\nyour organization.\n\n493\n00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.300\nAnd things like that in there and maybe\nyou don't want that which by default,\n\n494\n00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.190\nit's not checked.\n\n495\n00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.230\nSo, it's not sending any\nof that information.\n\n496\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.840\nBut if you wanted to turn that on,\nthat's where you could do that?\n\n497\n00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.540\n&gt;&gt; Perfect,\nwell I feel we've almost switched roles.\n\n498\n00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.495\nI'm always like well you know what?\n\n499\n00:25:27.495 --> 00:25:28.116\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Mike that's about\n\n500\n00:25:28.116 --> 00:25:28.712\nall the time we have for this episode.\n\n501\n00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:30.174\n&gt;&gt; You wanna close the show?\n\n502\n00:25:30.174 --> 00:25:33.762\n&gt;&gt; So, I think we've gone over a lot\nof different things within our\n\n503\n00:25:33.762 --> 00:25:37.084\nPowerpoint options which we\nspend a lot of time going over,\n\n504\n00:25:37.084 --> 00:25:41.060\nbut they're really good to at\nleast know that they're there.\n\n505\n00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.950\nAnd just as a note that I started with,\n\n506\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.090\nthis is across all of\nyour office programs.\n\n507\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.010\nSo, the same things that you can find,\nall the things with a trust center,\n\n508\n00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.220\nwith the Add-ins and customize and ribbon,\nif you've seen it here you're going to be\n\n509\n00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.240\nable to do the same thing in all\nof your other office products.\n\n510\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.220\nSo, it's good that we spent a decent\namount of time going over all this because\n\n511\n00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.240\nI feel it can be really helpful when\nyou go to other office products.\n\n512\n00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.910\n&gt;&gt; It is a great point because\nsome of those settings are global\n\n513\n00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.400\nlike when you configure those\ntrust center settings, and\n\n514\n00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.610\na trusted location it's not just\nPowerPoint, it's all of them.\n\n515\n00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.550\nSo, you don't have to configure it for\neach application which is kind of cool.\n\n516\n00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nI don't know who's supposed to close now.\n\n517\n00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.774\n&gt;&gt; I don't either.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n518\n00:26:18.774 --> 00:26:19.869\n&gt;&gt; So, we'll just close together,\nhow about that?\n\n519\n00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:21.080\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, there we go.\n\n520\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, ladies and\ngentlemen, that is gonna do it for\n\n521\n00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.950\nthis particular episode.\n\n522\n00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.190\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n523\n00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.030\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n524\n00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:33.437\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n525\n00:26:33.437 --> 00:26:35.748\n[MUSIC]\n\n526\n00:26:35.748 --> 00:26:39.613\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Hello,\n\n4\n00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:15.471\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:19.710\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our advanced PowerPoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.320\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at slide masters.\n\n7\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.840\nWhat are they?\nWhat can we do with them?\n\n8\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.290\nHave no idea, but that's we've got\nMs.Vonne Smith here to help us out,\n\n9\n00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.220\nwelcome back Vonne.\n\n10\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.910\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.220\nYes the slide master is where it's at,\nI love the slide master\n\n12\n00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.480\nbecause it controls everything\nwithin your PowerPoint.\n\n13\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.170\nIt's like, all the slides obey the master.\n\n14\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.132\nSo if you can find the master and\ncontrol that, then you control everything.\n\n15\n00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:46.270\nSo it's great.\n&gt;&gt; Make it all ready.\n\n16\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.387\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:48.387 --> 00:00:49.150\n&gt;&gt; So in previous episodes,\n\n18\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.339\nwe were talking about the design theme.\n\n19\n00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.135\nAnd the design theme is what\ncontrols the fonts, the colors and\n\n20\n00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:56.650\nsome of the positions around the slides.\n\n21\n00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.040\nBut it actually goes\na little bit more than that.\n\n22\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.575\nIt's actually the slide master\nthat's controlling a lot of that.\n\n23\n00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:06.981\nSo, we went into formating our bullets,\nand we changed some alignments on one\n\n24\n00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:10.002\nside, but\nit wasn't going across all of our slides.\n\n25\n00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.223\nAnd if you have like 6\nyears of the slides,\n\n26\n00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:15.802\nthat's gonna take a long time to go\nahead and format all of those, and\n\n27\n00:01:15.802 --> 00:01:19.030\ntype of copying of the formating\nwith the formating painter.\n\n28\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.270\nBut if you can just go to\nthe slide master, edit\n\n29\n00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.760\nthe things that you want to change, on the\nslide master it's going to go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.275\ngo through your entire presentation, and\nit's going to make your life a lot easier.\n\n31\n00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:33.643\nIt's kinda like going behind\nthe scenes and changing everything and\n\n32\n00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:36.150\nthen it's going to apply\neverything on the stage.\n\n33\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.960\nSo, using some theater references\nright now, but [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.011\n&gt;&gt; But it makes sense though,\n\n35\n00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.901\ncuz we can apply one of these themes and\nthat will apply to all of our slides.\n\n36\n00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:47.812\nBut once that theme's applied,\nif I go in and make changes to one slide\n\n37\n00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:52.140\nI'm not changing the theme, therefore\nI'm not changing any other slides.\n\n38\n00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.180\nAnd I gotta do them all.\n\n39\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.380\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; But now you tell me if I go to\n\n40\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.142\nthe slide master,\nI can actually tweak the theme itself and\n\n41\n00:01:58.142 --> 00:02:01.240\nthere by modify all the slides at once\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\n\n42\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.090\neven more than that, it's the,\nthe slide masters or the master slides,\n\n43\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.878\nwe're gonna be kind of using those\ninterchangeably by the way so [LAUGH].\n\n44\n00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:11.424\nOnce we get in the program I'll\nremember which one comes first.\n\n45\n00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:14.201\n[LAUGH] But I've always just\nkinda said it in the same way.\n\n46\n00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:19.949\nThe layouts, that's what I was going for,\nthe layouts that determine the comparisons\n\n47\n00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:24.620\nslide or the title and content,\nthat's all controlled by the master.\n\n48\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.786\nSo, you can even go one level more is you\ncould create your own layouts that you\n\n49\n00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:35.048\ncan include within your theme, we'll\ncall it, and control all your slides.\n\n50\n00:02:35.048 --> 00:02:36.610\nSo, why don't we go ahead and\nget into this.\n\n51\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.980\nAnd I can show you when you\nstart demonstrating and\n\n52\n00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.970\nseeing what happens here.\n\n53\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.802\nSo, I have a file called\nFormatting Slides and Themes.\n\n54\n00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:48.508\nAnd this looks familiar from our\nlast series I don't have any design\n\n55\n00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:50.470\ntheme applied to it right now.\n\n56\n00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.110\nSo I'm going to come up to the design tab,\nand we'll go ahead and\n\n57\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.090\nchoose one that we like,\nthat one's pretty, you know what?\n\n58\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.170\nI'm not really feeling that one.\n\n59\n00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.310\nHow about we go with this one?\n\n60\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.680\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was like it's kind of busy\n\n61\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.530\nand kind of bright but then I'm like\nwell this a pretty bright team.\n\n62\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.210\nBut I do like this theme for\nthis particular demonstration.\n\n63\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.430\nSo, we go ahead and\napply our theme andfrom the last episodes,\n\n64\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.320\nwe were talking about, you could go\nahead and do some of the variance.\n\n65\n00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.760\nI do like the green, so\nmaybe I'll choose the green.\n\n66\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.310\nAnd I can come in and control maybe\nthe different facts that I wanna do, or\n\n67\n00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.620\nthe colors, the color schemes\nif I wanted to do kind of\n\n68\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.670\ndo some small customizations from here.\n\n69\n00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.870\nBut, we're just changing and\nformatting the looks of the design theme.\n\n70\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.899\nIf I come over here to slide two,\n\n71\n00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:43.215\nwell, what about if I wanted\nto change the bullets?\n\n72\n00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:46.745\nLike I don't like the tiny\nlittle circles there, and\n\n73\n00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:51.420\nI want to have the text to be a little\nfurther away from that bullet.\n\n74\n00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.450\nThe other thing is that I feel like\nthe text in all of the slides like all of\n\n75\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.355\nthe bulleted lists is kind of small\n&gt;&gt; Compared to the title part it's not\n\n76\n00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:01.807\nvery, it doesn't go very well together.\n\n77\n00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:04.622\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly so\nI really like the look of the same but\n\n78\n00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:08.690\nthose are the things that I would want\nto actually, go in and format the size,\n\n79\n00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.350\nthe font and the bullet, but if I do it\non one it's not gonna go for all of them.\n\n80\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.950\nSo, we're gonna go to the slide master.\n\n81\n00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.320\nSo, where do we find the slide master?\n\n82\n00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.960\nThis is one I would say that like.\n\n83\n00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.776\n&gt;&gt; Behind the curtain?\n\n84\n00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:21.663\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, well.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:04:21.663 --> 00:04:23.679\n&gt;&gt; If we're gonna go behind the curtain we\n\n86\n00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:27.745\nhave to look behind the curtain so for\nlooking what tab we might go to then Mike?\n\n87\n00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:32.278\n&gt;&gt; I would say the view tab,\ncuz I can see things from the view tab\n\n88\n00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:33.362\n&gt;&gt; You are correct, good job.\n\n89\n00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:37.783\nSo, this is one of those commands\nthat if I wanted to apply a design or\n\n90\n00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:41.525\na transition or\nan animation that's the name of the tab.\n\n91\n00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:46.257\nSo, it's not like I don't feel as\nintuitive to find the slide master\n\n92\n00:04:46.257 --> 00:04:48.549\nthan some of the other commands.\n\n93\n00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:53.370\nSom we're gonna go to the View and we're\ngoing to go to slide master right here.\n\n94\n00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.195\nAnd when I go ahead and select that, you\ncan see that I am now behind the scenes.\n\n95\n00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:03.111\nI'm kind of in the the depths of this\ndesign theme and this PowerPoint\n\n96\n00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:08.150\npresentation and this is where I\ncan start controlling everything.\n\n97\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.410\n&gt;&gt; So, at this point that is not one\nof the slides from your presentation,\n\n98\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.280\nthat is just filler data basically.\n\n99\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.460\nJust make sure about just to aware you're\nnot modifying your current presentation.\n\n100\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.730\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes that's, and\nthat sometimes can be a little,\n\n101\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.170\nespecially if you are starting\nwith a brand new presentation and\n\n102\n00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.250\nyou didn't have any\ncontent in your slides.\n\n103\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.141\nYou're like where am I?\n\n104\n00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:26.556\n&gt;&gt; Where did all this come from?\n\n105\n00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:29.271\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly.\nAnother way that you know that you're in\n\n106\n00:05:29.271 --> 00:05:32.522\nthe slide master is that you\ndo have that slide master tab.\n\n107\n00:05:32.522 --> 00:05:35.297\nAnd you have the slide tabs over here,\n\n108\n00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:40.090\nyou can see that there's not like,\neach slide isn't numbered.\n\n109\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.800\nThere's only one of them and you can\nsee that there is a line that comes\n\n110\n00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.740\ndown that is attached\nto the very top slide,\n\n111\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.020\nand that is the master\nslide of the slide masters.\n\n112\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.156\nSee there we go,\nwe're doing some circles again.\n\n113\n00:05:53.156 --> 00:05:57.343\nBut, that is something that makes to point\nout that when you come into the slide\n\n114\n00:05:57.343 --> 00:05:59.800\nmaster, it doesn't always show that.\n\n115\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.080\nFor some reason it always\nkinda comes down here, and\n\n116\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.400\nso you think that this is the first\nslide but it's not really.\n\n117\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.100\nAnd we would think it's a first slide\nbecause every time we've been doing\n\n118\n00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.730\na presentation, we've always\nstarted out with that title slide.\n\n119\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.120\nThere's one above it so\nmake sure you watch that scroll.\n\n120\n00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.790\nAnd you go all the way to the top,\nbecause this is the beyond and\n\n121\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.340\nall, this is what all of the other\nslides are basing themselves off.\n\n122\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.369\nThis is-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n123\n00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.034\nthat's what that dotted\nline is indicating there.\n\n124\n00:06:28.034 --> 00:06:32.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes,\nthis is the hierarchy, right?\n\n125\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:38.510\nAll of these are subordinate\nslides of this top one.\n\n126\n00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.835\nAnd they all come from here.\n\n127\n00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.555\nNow, as soon as I said it, you're like,\n\n128\n00:06:42.555 --> 00:06:44.533\nthat doesn't look anything like it,\ndoes it?\n\n129\n00:06:44.533 --> 00:06:46.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll get\nthere in just a second.\n\n130\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.310\nBut if I come down here, this is our\ntitle slide layout, this is our title and\n\n131\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.680\ncontent layout,\nthis is our section header layout.\n\n132\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.280\nAll of those different layouts\nthat we can apply to our slides.\n\n133\n00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.250\nAre all controlled from this center place.\n\n134\n00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.380\nSo you can see that this slide, and this\nslide, and this slide, all of these title,\n\n135\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.670\ncontent, the comparisons,\nthe blank slides.\n\n136\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.980\nThey all have those similar features\nbecause it's all connected from\n\n137\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.550\nthat slide master.\n\n138\n00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.760\nBut why is this one different?\n\n139\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.030\nAnd how did it not show that green\nbar off to the side or this one?\n\n140\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.290\nThis one looks very\ndifferent than this one.\n\n141\n00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.950\nWell, you can go through each individual\nlayout and you can then pick and choose or\n\n142\n00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.980\nstart kinda customizing those from there.\n\n143\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.190\nLet me start with a starting point and\nthen modify from there.\n\n144\n00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.068\nBut one point to make sure that you know,\n\n145\n00:07:42.068 --> 00:07:45.594\nis that let's say maybe\non this comparison slide,\n\n146\n00:07:45.594 --> 00:07:50.925\nI don't want to have that black sidebar\nover here, or the, what color is it?\n\n147\n00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:51.653\n&gt;&gt; Green.\n&gt;&gt; It's green.\n\n148\n00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:53.077\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm like, what is that?\n\n149\n00:07:53.077 --> 00:07:54.057\nI'm looking right at it.\n\n150\n00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.380\nThat green line over there,\nwell, I can't click on it.\n\n151\n00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.487\nSo any of those graphics, or\n\n152\n00:07:58.487 --> 00:08:04.312\nany graphical items that you\nadd to the slide master,\n\n153\n00:08:04.312 --> 00:08:11.390\nthey are not able to be modified\non any subsequent slide.\n\n154\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.780\nBut how do they get this to happen?\n\n155\n00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.419\nThey did right here.\n\n156\n00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:17.500\nYou see where it says\nhide background graphics.\n\n157\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.050\nThat is checked on.\n\n158\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.015\nThis one it is not.\n\n159\n00:08:21.015 --> 00:08:22.540\nI think we are on this one, right.\n\n160\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.290\nSo if I wanted to not have those,\nyou just check that.\n\n161\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.810\nAnd it will hide all of the graphics\nthat you can put on that master slide.\n\n162\n00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.960\nAnd then you could add your own, and\n\n163\n00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.350\nthat's how they did this\ntitle slide right here.\n\n164\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.766\nIs they went ahead, and\nthey hid the background graphics.\n\n165\n00:08:38.766 --> 00:08:41.923\nAnd even if I turn it on,\nsee, they hid that, and\n\n166\n00:08:41.923 --> 00:08:45.860\nthen they put their own shape,\nwhoops, sorry, there.\n\n167\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.260\nThey put their own shape\nin this title slide, and\n\n168\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.490\nchange the color of the background, and\n\n169\n00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.700\nall the different things that only for the\nbackground for that one particular slide.\n\n170\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.670\nAnd that's how they could modify\nfrom the Template if you wanna say.\n\n171\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.290\nThe stamp that you're creating\nfrom this master slide.\n\n172\n00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.350\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n173\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.870\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n174\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.440\nSo if I wanted to come,\nlet me go ahead and undo that right there.\n\n175\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.660\nSo talking about what would I,\nwhy was I even here.\n\n176\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.270\nI wanted to change the bullets.\n\n177\n00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.380\nSo If I come to the Title and\nContent slide.\n\n178\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.700\nI could go ahead and then select this\ntext, come back to the home tab,\n\n179\n00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.930\ngo ahead and do our bullet formatting.\n\n180\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.684\nLet's make them, I do this one just for\n\n181\n00:09:23.684 --> 00:09:26.564\nlike demonstration purposes\nbecause it looks a lot different.\n\n182\n00:09:26.564 --> 00:09:31.011\nAnd then we can come up here to our,\nthis is our ruler [CROSSTALK].\n\n183\n00:09:31.011 --> 00:09:32.107\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ruler.\n\n184\n00:09:32.107 --> 00:09:34.285\n&gt;&gt; Like,\nit's right there at the tip of my tongue.\n\n185\n00:09:34.285 --> 00:09:39.085\nAnd I could go ahead and take that\nbullet alignment and move it over, so\n\n186\n00:09:39.085 --> 00:09:42.825\nthere is a little bit more space\nbetween the bullet and the text.\n\n187\n00:09:42.825 --> 00:09:45.219\nAnd we did cover this,\npretty much in depth,\n\n188\n00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:47.561\nin the formatting text\nin our first series.\n\n189\n00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:49.289\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou call this slide was which layout?\n\n190\n00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:50.985\n&gt;&gt; This is the Title and Content.\n\n191\n00:09:50.985 --> 00:09:55.160\nThis is like the main slide\nthat is always added.\n\n192\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.500\nThis is where you just having the single\namount of content and the title.\n\n193\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:05.785\n&gt;&gt; So when you modify that particular\nbullet on the title and content template.\n\n194\n00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:07.151\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mm.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Okay,\n\n195\n00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:09.865\nonly where that is applied\nwithin your presentation or\n\n196\n00:10:09.865 --> 00:10:13.258\nwhat about slides that don't\nfollow that particular template?\n\n197\n00:10:13.258 --> 00:10:13.933\n&gt;&gt; Like the comparison?\n\n198\n00:10:13.933 --> 00:10:15.934\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I see where your going.\n\n199\n00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:17.146\nOkay.\n[LAUGH] Good point,\n\n200\n00:10:17.146 --> 00:10:20.399\nbecause we did have one of those layouts\nwithin our presentation, correct?\n\n201\n00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:21.167\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, I think so.\n\n202\n00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:23.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n203\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can see down here it's,\n\n204\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.110\nyou would have to go and format each one\nof those layouts because if I did have.\n\n205\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.952\nIf I did choose a two content layout,\n\n206\n00:10:31.952 --> 00:10:34.975\nyou gotta make sure you do\nthe bullets on this one.\n\n207\n00:10:34.975 --> 00:10:39.390\n&gt;&gt; If I did the comparison slide where\nit has the titles on top of it here or\n\n208\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.605\nthe headers,\nthen you'd have to modify it here.\n\n209\n00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:44.614\nBut that's okay,\nthe thing about you're just doing it once.\n\n210\n00:10:44.614 --> 00:10:45.213\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n211\n00:10:45.213 --> 00:10:48.264\n&gt;&gt; If I had 15 slides\nthat had that comparison\n\n212\n00:10:48.264 --> 00:10:50.742\nlayout in my actual presentation.\n\n213\n00:10:50.742 --> 00:10:51.533\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n214\n00:10:51.533 --> 00:10:53.293\n&gt;&gt; If I change it here,\nit's gonna change it on all 15.\n\n215\n00:10:53.293 --> 00:10:53.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n216\n00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.245\n&gt;&gt; So it's very, very handy.\n\n217\n00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:55.876\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n218\n00:10:55.876 --> 00:10:57.779\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhy don't we come back to here and\n\n219\n00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:00.070\nlet's just make this,\nlet's make this bold.\n\n220\n00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.150\nThat's the wrong keyboard shortcut, sorry.\n\n221\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.141\nWhy don't I just click the button?\n\n222\n00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:08.350\n[LAUGH] There we go, and\nthen let's center this title.\n\n223\n00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.193\nAnd let's, you know what?\n\n224\n00:11:10.193 --> 00:11:12.839\nNow that's, let's just center the title.\n\n225\n00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.560\nI'm getting ahead of myself because\nI was thinking, I wanna go ahead and\n\n226\n00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.879\nmake all of the titles\non every single slide.\n\n227\n00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:21.660\nWhether it's a title on content or\na two content, or\n\n228\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.345\na comparison [INAUDIBLE] on anyone,\nwhere do you think I'm gonna go?\n\n229\n00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:27.105\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna think to the very top.\n\n230\n00:11:27.105 --> 00:11:31.988\n&gt;&gt; You are correct [LAUGH] and that's\nwhere I was getting ahead of myself so\n\n231\n00:11:31.988 --> 00:11:36.620\nI am gonna undo this because I do\nwanna come back and say all slides,\n\n232\n00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.349\nI want your titles to be In the center and\n\n233\n00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:43.450\nI want it to be red just to make\nthat point so we can see that.\n\n234\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.940\nSo let's go ahead and select that.\n\n235\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.210\nLet's make it centered.\n\n236\n00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.090\nLet's make it red.\n\n237\n00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.070\nAnd you can see even here that it's going\nacross all of the different layouts and\n\n238\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.960\nit is making those titles red.\n\n239\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.577\nNow, not on these because it kinda\nformats a little bit different.\n\n240\n00:11:57.577 --> 00:11:59.970\nThese are, I think,\nthe picture with caption layout.\n\n241\n00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.090\nSo if I wanted to,\nI'd have to come into each one.\n\n242\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.266\nAnd I'm not actually using this layout\nin my slide presentation right now, but\n\n243\n00:12:07.266 --> 00:12:10.600\nI would have to kind of come and\ndouble check all of these.\n\n244\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.280\nSo you come into the master slide or\nthe slide master,\n\n245\n00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.130\nwhichever one we're\ngonna call it right now.\n\n246\n00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.007\nNow how do I leave?\n\n247\n00:12:17.007 --> 00:12:18.410\nThere's two ways.\n\n248\n00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:23.002\nYou can go on the Slide Master tab and\nyou can close the Master view or\n\n249\n00:12:23.002 --> 00:12:27.530\nyou can go to the view menu and\njust go back out to your normal view.\n\n250\n00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.621\nEither way is going to take you\nin front of the curtain now.\n\n251\n00:12:31.621 --> 00:12:34.598\nWe're going to leave back here and\n\n252\n00:12:34.598 --> 00:12:40.450\nnow you can see all of the slides\nin my presentation centered title,\n\n253\n00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.082\nwidth, red and\nI got some weird thing going on there.\n\n254\n00:12:45.082 --> 00:12:48.432\n[LAUGH] But maybe a weird, an erroneous\npaste that I made somewhere but\n\n255\n00:12:48.432 --> 00:12:50.049\nI might have been making notes but\n\n256\n00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:53.139\nI didn't realize I just pasted\nit in to my slide presentation.\n\n257\n00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:56.640\nSo I'll make sure that's gone when\nthis is uploaded to our library.\n\n258\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.550\nBut again, fantastic way of\nbeing able to change everything\n\n259\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:06.420\nin your presentation by going\ninto that slide master.\n\n260\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.690\n&gt;&gt; It is really cool concept.\n\n261\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.940\nI mean so now we can sit there,\n\n262\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.180\nwe can work with our presentation\ndirectly and edit an individual slide.\n\n263\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.150\nOr I can go into the slide master.\n\n264\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.616\nAnd I can pick one of the templates\nthat we apply, like compare or title and\n\n265\n00:13:19.616 --> 00:13:25.400\npicture, and I can modify all slides that\nhave that particular template applied.\n\n266\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.832\nOr I can jump to the very top of the\nhierarchy and hit the Master slide, and\n\n267\n00:13:28.832 --> 00:13:32.674\nI can make a change that applies to every\nsingle slide in my entire presentation.\n\n268\n00:13:32.674 --> 00:13:34.167\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we can really pick and\n\n269\n00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:37.295\nchoose what one would work best for\nthat particular scenario.\n\n270\n00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:41.805\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I know from teaching this\nproduct for so long, as soon as we start\n\n271\n00:13:41.805 --> 00:13:45.110\nformatting bullets, it's like, well,\nnow I want it to go for all of them.\n\n272\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.670\nYou gotta wait.\n\n273\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.420\nI think I even said that\nwhen we filmed the episode.\n\n274\n00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.142\nIt was like, don't worry,\nit'll get there, just come back and\n\n275\n00:13:50.142 --> 00:13:51.542\nwatch the Slide Master episode.\n\n276\n00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:55.093\nSo here I am, [LAUGH] telling you how\nto do it and you're like, this is so\n\n277\n00:13:55.093 --> 00:13:55.829\nmuch better.\n\n278\n00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:56.885\nSo what I'd like [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; One thing-\n\n279\n00:13:56.885 --> 00:13:57.518\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n280\n00:13:57.518 --> 00:14:00.458\n&gt;&gt; That I noticed though is that I don't\nbelieve you had to save anything there.\n\n281\n00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:05.218\nWhen you got out of the slide master\nmodifications, did you have to save that?\n\n282\n00:14:05.218 --> 00:14:10.348\n&gt;&gt; No, not necessarily because I\nhave altered the design theme.\n\n283\n00:14:10.348 --> 00:14:13.057\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So if I want to go to another theme,\n\n284\n00:14:13.057 --> 00:14:16.050\nlet's say I went over to this theme.\n\n285\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.612\nOr this theme, right?\n\n286\n00:14:17.612 --> 00:14:20.373\nIf I come back to this one,\nyou could see, actually I forgot.\n\n287\n00:14:20.373 --> 00:14:22.485\n[LAUGH] Good point.\n\n288\n00:14:22.485 --> 00:14:23.893\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:24.992\n&gt;&gt; I forgot that,\n\n290\n00:14:24.992 --> 00:14:29.060\nwell, I did went ahead and\nI moved off of that theme, so.\n\n291\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.868\nLet's stop there, sorry.\n\n292\n00:14:30.868 --> 00:14:33.212\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sorry,\nI didn't mean to throw you for a curve.\n\n293\n00:14:33.212 --> 00:14:34.316\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I was.\n\n294\n00:14:34.316 --> 00:14:37.943\nI thought it was going to change,\nor stick, but it didn't.\n\n295\n00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:40.340\n[CROSSTALK] So that's actually,\nit's a good stopping point.\n\n296\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.897\nCuz you're gonna say that, and\nI'm gonna say, well [LAUGH].\n\n297\n00:14:43.897 --> 00:14:45.828\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question [LAUGH].\n\n298\n00:14:45.828 --> 00:14:51.332\n&gt;&gt; If you don't change themes, and so\nthat way remembers and that happens.\n\n299\n00:14:51.332 --> 00:14:53.654\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n300\n00:14:53.654 --> 00:14:54.179\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we do that?\n\n301\n00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:56.555\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's see,\n\n302\n00:14:56.555 --> 00:15:02.516\nyou're gonna have to go back and put\nyour slide master to green [CROSSTALK].\n\n303\n00:15:02.516 --> 00:15:04.015\n&gt;&gt; So we were here.\n\n304\n00:15:04.015 --> 00:15:04.924\nYeah, I just wanna do, so.\n\n305\n00:15:04.924 --> 00:15:06.044\n&gt;&gt; It's uh-huh, yep, yep.\n\n306\n00:15:06.044 --> 00:15:08.892\n&gt;&gt;

Okay.\nSo let's say I've got my,\n\n343\n00:16:21.163 --> 00:16:26.063\neverything's red, and this way we did all\nof our modifications on our slide master,\n\n344\n00:16:26.063 --> 00:16:27.710\nand it was to this bad theme.\n\n345\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.090\nBut actually even when I\nhover over that theme,\n\n346\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.250\nit is going to go back to the way that\nthe theme was before I started all\n\n347\n00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.280\nthe customization-\n&gt;&gt; We haven't permanently modified that\n\n348\n00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.220\nslide master yet?\n\n349\n00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:39.910\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah.\n\n350\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.290\nAnd watch, if I go and click this theme,\nand then come back to this,\n\n351\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.337\nall of those modifications,\nthe badge theme did not take.\n\n352\n00:16:47.337 --> 00:16:49.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or did not stick.\n\n353\n00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.260\nBut if, let me back up, let me undo twice.\n\n354\n00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.900\nIf I did like this, and I wanted to\nkeep everything, you can save this\n\n355\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.980\nas a design theme, your own theme that\nwe had done in some other episodes.\n\n356\n00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.760\nBut this is a great point,\nthis is a really great point,\n\n357\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.520\nsince we are talking about slide masters.\n\n358\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.390\nSo I can go ahead and save the current\ntheme, and then I could name it badge red,\n\n359\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.370\nand then we can go ahead and save that.\n\n360\n00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:19.700\nJust like I had saved that rainbow\none from our previous episodes,\n\n361\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.580\nthen I can go ahead and\nsave the theme from here.\n\n362\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.800\nSo a very good point to make of,\n\n363\n00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.500\nif I like what I've done to my\nslide master or, which really is\n\n364\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.455\npart of the theme as well, then I need\nto make sure that I save all of this.\n\n365\n00:17:34.455 --> 00:17:35.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And actually,\n\n366\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.220\nit's a great lead into what I'd\nlike to demonstrate next is, well,\n\n367\n00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:44.148\nwhat if I wanted to build my own theme,\nmy own look to my presentation.\n\n368\n00:17:44.148 --> 00:17:46.858\nSo I wanna go over that and\nwe're also gonna save it as a template.\n\n369\n00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:47.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n370\n00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.900\n&gt;&gt; And create a new layout.\n\n371\n00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.176\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; We've got a couple of things that we're\n\n372\n00:17:51.176 --> 00:17:54.761\ngoing to do, so, why don't we go ahead and\nstart with a new presentation.\n\n373\n00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:59.163\nI'm not gonna save the changes here, that\nway you have a nice clean slate when put\n\n374\n00:17:59.163 --> 00:18:02.614\nup to the slide library, but\nI always have backup just in case.\n\n375\n00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:05.010\n&gt;&gt; Good [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like, I like this and I saved,\n\n376\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.517\nI was like, wait,\nI really wanted to do a save as.\n\n377\n00:18:07.517 --> 00:18:11.270\nI didn't wanna overwrite all the changes\non that file, so I always make sure.\n\n378\n00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.891\nI think I had three different places.\n\n379\n00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:14.422\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just to make sure.\n\n380\n00:18:14.422 --> 00:18:18.440\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nstart PowerPoint by itself.\n\n381\n00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.560\nAnd we're gonna start with\na blank new presentation and\n\n382\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.170\njust do a quick formatting of what\nI wanna do for my ITProTV layout.\n\n383\n00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.312\nThat's okay, thank you, new PowerPoint.\n\n384\n00:18:31.312 --> 00:18:33.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so here we go.\n\n385\n00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:37.841\nI want to go right into my slide master.\n\n386\n00:18:37.841 --> 00:18:41.043\nCuz that way I want to control what\neverything is going to look like.\n\n387\n00:18:41.043 --> 00:18:43.793\nI wanna make my own theme per se, and\n\n388\n00:18:43.793 --> 00:18:48.300\nthen be able to use it\nthroughout all of my slides.\n\n389\n00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.870\nSo let's go to the View tab, and\nwe will go to our Slide Master,\n\n390\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.290\nand we will come into here.\n\n391\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:57.370\nRemember, you gotta go all the way\nup to the top to get to that\n\n392\n00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.440\nMaster slide that all of them use.\n\n393\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.380\nSo we're gonna go ahead and add a shape.\n\n394\n00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.490\nI have this design in mind,\nthat is the wrong shape that I did.\n\n395\n00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.066\nI wanted a triangle.\n\n396\n00:19:08.066 --> 00:19:08.780\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n397\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I clicked on the wrong one,\n\n398\n00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.340\nI got going too fast.\n\n399\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.770\nAll right, so,\nwe're gonna make this triangle.\n\n400\n00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:19.090\nAnd the yellow dot, we're gonna go\nahead and move that yellow dot over,\n\n401\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.880\nto kinda make a right-angled triangle.\n\n402\n00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.920\nWe'll make this a little bit bigger, and\n\n403\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.720\nmaybe just a little bit thinner,\nlike that.\n\n404\n00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.300\nSo we just have a triangle off to\nthe side, we'll take off the outline, and\n\n405\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.625\nwe'll keep it blue, we'll go with that.\n\n406\n00:19:34.625 --> 00:19:35.530\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n407\n00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.750\n&gt;&gt; I want another one on the other side,\nbut I want to, same size but flip it.\n\n408\n00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.890\nThe easiest way is to do that Ctrl drag.\n\n409\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:46.890\nThe Ctrl drag is where you can\nmake a duplicate of your shape.\n\n410\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.620\nI can zoom out just a little bit.\n\n411\n00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.960\nI can rotate this around,\n\n412\n00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.820\nholding that Shift key cuz that\nwill constrain your proportions.\n\n413\n00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.576\nAnd then you can move that on over there.\n\n414\n00:19:56.576 --> 00:19:57.633\nOoh, fancy.\n\n415\n00:19:57.633 --> 00:19:58.222\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n416\n00:19:58.222 --> 00:20:00.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're saying kind of basic, but\n\n417\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:06.260\njust to kinda get the idea that this is\nwhat I want all of my slides to look like.\n\n418\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.875\nNow, when you put the shapes on it,\n\n419\n00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:13.110\ndo you see how it is putting\non top of everything?\n\n420\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:17.610\nSo if I were to add the dates to\nthe slide, it would be behind the shape.\n\n421\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.410\nSo we're going to hold the Shift key and\nselect this other one.\n\n422\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.570\nSo I have both of those\ntriangles selected.\n\n423\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.509\nAnd we're going to send them to the back.\n\n424\n00:20:26.509 --> 00:20:29.960\nGo behind everything, so\nthat way, the date shows up.\n\n425\n00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.000\nBut the date is really, you can't really\nsee it very well because it's in that\n\n426\n00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.967\ngrayish text, so\nI'm going to, whoa, sorry.\n\n427\n00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:37.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n428\n00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Using my scroll wheel and\n\n429\n00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.030\nI'm going a little crazy.\n\n430\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.500\nSo why don't we go ahead and use this.\n\n431\n00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.464\nWe'll just go ahead and use the Shift key.\n\n432\n00:20:44.464 --> 00:20:44.974\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n433\n00:20:44.974 --> 00:20:45.844\n&gt;&gt; You could see it enough.\n\n434\n00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:46.814\nI was trying to get it a little bit\n\n435\n00:20:46.814 --> 00:20:47.700\nmore in view.\n\n436\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.030\nAnd we will go ahead and make that bold.\n\n437\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.300\nAnd we'll make the text black,\nso you can see it.\n\n438\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.580\nAnd maybe we'll go ahead and make this\nbold, and we'll make it centered.\n\n439\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.048\nThen maybe I don't even like\nany of the text overall,\n\n440\n00:21:03.048 --> 00:21:05.682\nI wanna change the overall font scheme.\n\n441\n00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:09.685\nYou could come over to that\nSlide Master and you can control,\n\n442\n00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:13.387\nI want to have a set color scheme\nthat I want to go with it.\n\n443\n00:21:13.387 --> 00:21:17.460\nAnd maybe it's not, the Office isn't, I\nreally like some, let's go with some pink.\n\n444\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.674\nAll right, so all right,\nwe're not going with blue,\n\n445\n00:21:19.674 --> 00:21:21.182\nwe're going with pink now-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:21:21.182 --> 00:21:22.697\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then you could see,\n\n447\n00:21:22.697 --> 00:21:24.750\nyou could choose your font families.\n\n448\n00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.390\nLet's go with our Cordell.\n\n449\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.380\nAnd, beautiful, that looks great.\n\n450\n00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.170\nYou could go in a format all your bullets.\n\n451\n00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.146\nJust for time purposes,\nkeep it a little shorter.\n\n452\n00:21:35.146 --> 00:21:40.320\nSo you could see that I have gone and made\nall of these different edits to the slide\n\n453\n00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.760\nmaster, the Master slide, to control\nwhat I want all of my slides to look at.\n\n454\n00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.810\nBut I do want my title slide to look a\nlittle bit different, because you've seen\n\n455\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.890\nkind of in all the design themes,\nthat first slide is just a little bit\n\n456\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.460\nfancier, looks a little different-\n&gt;&gt; Set it apart from the rest of\n\n457\n00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.050\nthe slides.\n\n458\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.040\nIt's a special slide.\n\n459\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.060\n&gt;&gt; It is a special slide.\n\n460\n00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.430\nSo, cuz that's what people are going\nto be looking at when they walk in.\n\n461\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.056\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So let's make this special-er.\n\n462\n00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.290\nSpecial-er?\n\n463\n00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.210\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; More special?\n\n464\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.090\n&gt;&gt; More special.\n\n465\n00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] We'll go with that.\n\n466\n00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.380\nBut I can't move these squares, right?\n\n467\n00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.040\nBecause all of the slide master, any\ngraphics or elements that I put on that is\n\n468\n00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.280\ngoing to kind of lock in\nplace any subsequent slide.\n\n469\n00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.790\nBut we will go ahead and use that,\nhide background graphics, and\n\n470\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.650\nthen I can go ahead and control this.\n\n471\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.800\nAnd why don't we go ahead and\nmake this a pink color?\n\n472\n00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.702\nLet's go ahead and format the background\nand we will go with a solid color.\n\n473\n00:22:33.702 --> 00:22:37.112\nAnd we will go, there we go,\nwe will go [LAUGH] with a solid color and\n\n474\n00:22:37.112 --> 00:22:38.846\nmaybe throw a gradient on it.\n\n475\n00:22:38.846 --> 00:22:42.551\nI'm not sure about this but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n476\n00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:43.671\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah,\n\n477\n00:22:43.671 --> 00:22:47.031\nI better stop before I start\ngetting a little overboard,\n\n478\n00:22:47.031 --> 00:22:51.025\nbecause I could probably sit here for\nhours just messing with this.\n\n479\n00:22:51.025 --> 00:22:51.664\nBut you know what?\n\n480\n00:22:51.664 --> 00:22:52.516\nThere we go, we're done.\n\n481\n00:22:52.516 --> 00:22:53.412\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n482\n00:22:53.412 --> 00:22:55.678\n&gt;&gt; We will be done so I could go ahead and\n\n483\n00:22:55.678 --> 00:22:57.500\nmove on to say, I like this.\n\n484\n00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I think this looks really good.\n\n485\n00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.430\nI'm gonna leave my slide master.\n\n486\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.640\nI'm going to close out the master view.\n\n487\n00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.680\nAnd here is my presentation,\nI could go ahead and add a new slide.\n\n488\n00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.640\nGoing to my title and content, and you can\nsee that all the formatting that I have\n\n489\n00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.618\nused for that slide master is\ngoing to be applied to here.\n\n490\n00:23:17.618 --> 00:23:21.250\nAnd we could just keep on going,\nand it's gonna be really great.\n\n491\n00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.720\nBut I did say that we were going\nto make our own layout, didn't I?\n\n492\n00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.560\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n493\n00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.740\n&gt;&gt; I did, yes so why don't we go back and\ndo that as well?\n\n494\n00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.990\nBecause in here, I have the different\nlayouts that I wanted to do,\n\n495\n00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.700\nthe two content.\n\n496\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:36.540\nBut maybe I'm always going to have two\npictures and a text block in the middle.\n\n497\n00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.069\nI'm always gonna have it,\nand I'd like to go ahead and\n\n498\n00:23:40.069 --> 00:23:44.842\nset that layout up now, and so\nI can use that throughout my presentation.\n\n499\n00:23:44.842 --> 00:23:49.416\nLet's go back to that slide master,\nwe go back to our View,\n\n500\n00:23:49.416 --> 00:23:54.410\nwe go back to Slide Master, and\nnow I want to add a new layout.\n\n501\n00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.926\nSo I can go ahead and Insert Layout.\n\n502\n00:23:57.926 --> 00:24:02.156\nAnd you see how it's adding\na new slide right here.\n\n503\n00:24:02.156 --> 00:24:03.805\nSee, it says Custom Layout.\n\n504\n00:24:03.805 --> 00:24:04.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n505\n00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.110\n&gt;&gt; Let me just do that one more time.\n\n506\n00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:12.540\nAnd, I didn't point out that\nwherever I was in the order\n\n507\n00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.470\nof the slides, that's where it's\ngoing to put it on the next slide.\n\n508\n00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:21.230\nSo I happen to be on the second slide,\nwhich is the title and content layout.\n\n509\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.664\nAnd that's where I added that new slide.\n\n510\n00:24:23.664 --> 00:24:28.220\nIt's basically the same thing, but then\nI can go ahead and start customizing it.\n\n511\n00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.390\nSo, I just wanted to point that out.\n\n512\n00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.440\nSo let's see one more time,\ninsert layout here's my new slide.\n\n513\n00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.049\nBut custom layout, layout.\n\n514\n00:24:34.049 --> 00:24:36.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't sound very descriptive.\n\n515\n00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.550\nYou can rename that.\n\n516\n00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.575\nEasiest way, I say just rename it,\nright-click on it.\n\n517\n00:24:41.575 --> 00:24:44.175\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Easiest way to rename it is to\n\n518\n00:24:44.175 --> 00:24:44.838\nrename it.\n\n519\n00:24:44.838 --> 00:24:45.840\n&gt;&gt; Rename it, yeah.\n\n520\n00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.987\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So right-click on it, so you could go\n\n521\n00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:54.627\nahead and rename that layout, and\nthen we can name this two image and text.\n\n522\n00:24:54.627 --> 00:25:01.165\nHow about we go ahead and make the space,\nand we rename and we say beautiful.\n\n523\n00:25:01.165 --> 00:25:03.595\nThat is the name of that slide layout.\n\n524\n00:25:03.595 --> 00:25:08.416\nAnd now, how do I go ahead and\nput in picture like a placeholder,\n\n525\n00:25:08.416 --> 00:25:10.750\nplaceholder, placeholder.\n\n526\n00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:11.753\nInsert placeholder.\n\n527\n00:25:11.753 --> 00:25:14.808\nSo we're going to click on this button,\nand what am I adding.\n\n528\n00:25:14.808 --> 00:25:19.330\nNow in our other slides, you had\nthe ones with all the six boxes in it.\n\n529\n00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.120\nSo you could click on either\nthe insert a table, or chart, or image.\n\n530\n00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.750\nBut this one, I know specifically\nthat it's always gonna be a picture.\n\n531\n00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.190\nSo if I click on Insert\nplaceholder picture.\n\n532\n00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.014\nIt's like I have my pencil in my hand and\nI'm gonna draw on the box, so\n\n533\n00:25:33.014 --> 00:25:36.259\nI'm gonna go ahead and click hold and\ndrag, and I'm gonna draw it right here.\n\n534\n00:25:36.259 --> 00:25:39.381\nAnd that's where I want my\npicture placeholder to be.\n\n535\n00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:43.239\nI'm actually gonna move this over so\nI'm gonna get my 4 pointed arrows,\n\n536\n00:25:43.239 --> 00:25:46.429\ncuz I wanted to not interfere\nwith the background graphics.\n\n537\n00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:48.800\nNow, I want another one.\n\n538\n00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.605\nWell I already have one, right.\n\n539\n00:25:49.605 --> 00:25:51.293\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So why don't we just copy and pace, or\n\n540\n00:25:51.293 --> 00:25:52.586\nyou can still use that control.\n\n541\n00:25:52.586 --> 00:25:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Control D.\n\n542\n00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.889\n&gt;&gt; Drag, or yeah control D for\nduplicate, right.\n\n543\n00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:57.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Does that work here?\n\n544\n00:25:57.461 --> 00:25:58.572\n&gt;&gt; I think.\n&gt;&gt; I think.\n\n545\n00:25:58.572 --> 00:25:59.694\n&gt;&gt; I thought that's what you're using.\n\n546\n00:25:59.694 --> 00:26:02.733\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In some programs,\n\n547\n00:26:02.733 --> 00:26:05.310\nCtrl+D means a lot of\ndifferent things to be.\n\n548\n00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.290\nSo I was like, I don't actually know.\n\n549\n00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've never used that keyword shortcut\n\n550\n00:26:09.122 --> 00:26:10.644\nin office, but it does work.\n\n551\n00:26:10.644 --> 00:26:11.950\n&gt;&gt; With Ctrl click drag?\n\n552\n00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I was controlling,\nclicking and dragging.\n\n553\n00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.560\nBut I love the Ctrl+D, thank you very much\nfor letting us know, that's how works, but\n\n554\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.759\nI'm going to delete it.\n\n555\n00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:22.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I've got my two picture boxes, and\n\n556\n00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.439\nif anyone want to go ahead and\nmake a text, insert, placeholder.\n\n557\n00:26:26.439 --> 00:26:28.607\nI will go ahead and\ndrag that right in the middle.\n\n558\n00:26:29.827 --> 00:26:31.670\nAnd there you have it.\n\n559\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:35.830\nSo I've got my own layout that I\nwant to be able to add slides,\n\n560\n00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.454\nwith this layout in my presentation.\n\n561\n00:26:38.454 --> 00:26:39.676\nI've renamed that layout.\n\n562\n00:26:39.676 --> 00:26:42.319\nIt's in my slide master.\n\n563\n00:26:42.319 --> 00:26:44.289\nSo let's go ahead and\nleave our slide master.\n\n564\n00:26:44.289 --> 00:26:48.147\nI'm gonna go to the View tab this time,\nand go into our normal view.\n\n565\n00:26:49.368 --> 00:26:53.954\nSo there is our title slide,\nthere is our content, and\n\n566\n00:26:53.954 --> 00:26:59.947\nnow I want to insert the two image\nin text, yay my own, that's so cute.\n\n567\n00:26:59.947 --> 00:27:01.101\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n568\n00:27:01.101 --> 00:27:06.666\nnow I've got a new slide with this\nparticular layout, and I'm ready to go.\n\n569\n00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:11.425\nBut, what if I wanna use this for\nmultiple presentations because this is.\n\n570\n00:27:11.425 --> 00:27:13.296\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; This is our company format, and\n\n571\n00:27:13.296 --> 00:27:16.170\nI want everybody to use it or I want\nto use it on all of my presentations.\n\n572\n00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.109\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, correct.\n\n573\n00:27:17.109 --> 00:27:19.134\nSo, how am I going to do that?\n\n574\n00:27:19.134 --> 00:27:20.814\nOne, I would go ahead and\n\n575\n00:27:20.814 --> 00:27:25.456\nmake sure that you save this as your\ndesign theme, because that way at\n\n576\n00:27:25.456 --> 00:27:30.279\nleast the theme can carry on to\ndifferent presentations that you have.\n\n577\n00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:34.094\nSo we're going to save the current\ntheme and we're gonna name it pink,\n\n578\n00:27:34.094 --> 00:27:35.245\ncuz it's very pink.\n\n579\n00:27:35.245 --> 00:27:37.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with that.\n\n580\n00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.430\nThe other thing that you can do,\nis you could save this as a template.\n\n581\n00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:46.640\nWhen we do a File, New and it has all of\nthose boxes of the design templates or\n\n582\n00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.050\ndesign themes, are ready to go.\n\n583\n00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.810\nYou could go ahead and put it there.\n\n584\n00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.610\nAnd this is also something\nthat you could use.\n\n585\n00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.639\nIt makes a p, p, t wait.\n\n586\n00:27:55.639 --> 00:27:56.703\nI can't remember the file extension.\n\n587\n00:27:56.703 --> 00:27:58.438\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll see it when we save it.\n\n588\n00:27:58.438 --> 00:28:01.429\nBut what you could also do is\nyou could share it with people.\n\n589\n00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:03.648\nI could send you that template.\n\n590\n00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:06.896\nAnd then you could bring it in,\nyou could do open from template,\n\n591\n00:28:06.896 --> 00:28:08.650\nand then you have that ready to go.\n\n592\n00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.480\nAnd then you could save\nit as a design theme.\n\n593\n00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.840\nAnd you could save it\nas your own template.\n\n594\n00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.130\nSo it's a way of sharing\nit in that format of,\n\n595\n00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:22.470\nthis is going to go as an overall\nslide master design theme.\n\n596\n00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.000\nEverything for you.\n\n597\n00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.774\nSo that's pretty nice.\n\n598\n00:28:24.774 --> 00:28:26.092\nSo how do I do that?\n\n599\n00:28:26.092 --> 00:28:27.560\nWe're going to do a File.\n\n600\n00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.172\nWe're going to do a file Save As.\n\n601\n00:28:30.172 --> 00:28:37.784\nI will go to the Browse here, and I need\nto save the type right here, it's a POTX.\n\n602\n00:28:37.784 --> 00:28:39.247\nThat's what I was [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; POTX.\n\n603\n00:28:39.247 --> 00:28:40.099\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't remember.\n\n604\n00:28:40.099 --> 00:28:43.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So as soon as I change the Save As type\n\n605\n00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:48.601\nto template, don't change the location,\nbecause look at the top.\n\n606\n00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:53.459\nDo you see how it is way far, it's not\nthat far into it, but it is in my user\n\n607\n00:28:53.459 --> 00:28:58.755\naccount, it's in the Documents, and\nit's in the Custom Office Templates.\n\n608\n00:28:58.755 --> 00:29:01.600\nI like to keep it in there because,\nit's where it kinda needs to go.\n\n609\n00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.063\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's where PowerPoint\nknows to look for them,\n\n610\n00:29:04.063 --> 00:29:06.440\nso if you open up PowerPoint and\nit shows you all those.\n\n611\n00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.132\nIf you put it somewhere else, it might\nnot find it and display it for you there.\n\n612\n00:29:10.132 --> 00:29:12.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could put it somewhere else,\nbut to me,\n\n613\n00:29:12.913 --> 00:29:14.673\nput it where it goes by default.\n\n614\n00:29:14.673 --> 00:29:20.245\nAnd if you really want it to go and make\na copy of it and put it somewhere else,\n\n615\n00:29:20.245 --> 00:29:25.118\nbut keep the themes wherever your\noffice product puts the theme.\n\n616\n00:29:25.118 --> 00:29:31.775\nSo, why don't we go ahead and name this,\n\"pink template\" good a name as any.\n\n617\n00:29:31.775 --> 00:29:32.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n618\n00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.740\n&gt;&gt; We shall save, and now I have that.\n\n619\n00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.730\nI'm going to close PowerPoint\njust to demonstrate this.\n\n620\n00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.967\nWe'll just go ahead and\nstart PowerPoint back up.\n\n621\n00:29:39.967 --> 00:29:42.888\nI probably should just go ahead and\npin that to my task bar, but.\n\n622\n00:29:42.888 --> 00:29:47.866\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now I've got, if I should be able to\n\n623\n00:29:47.866 --> 00:29:52.020\nscroll down I might have to restart.\n\n624\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.190\nBut anyways, I have it over,\nwait, I'm sorry.\n\n625\n00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.522\nYou know where it's at?\n\n626\n00:29:56.522 --> 00:29:58.259\n[LAUGH] It's over here in custom.\n\n627\n00:29:58.259 --> 00:29:59.196\n&gt;&gt; Custom Office.\n\n628\n00:29:59.196 --> 00:30:02.419\n&gt;&gt; On my Custom Office Template, oops,\nsorry, I went a little too fast there.\n\n629\n00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:03.456\nAnd there's my other one.\n\n630\n00:30:03.456 --> 00:30:04.059\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n631\n00:30:04.059 --> 00:30:06.013\n&gt;&gt; So if you saw when I did the File,\nSave As.\n\n632\n00:30:06.013 --> 00:30:07.594\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; I was playing around.\n\n633\n00:30:07.594 --> 00:30:11.880\nAnd so now I have the ITPro.TV theme,\nand I have the pink template.\n\n634\n00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.590\nSorry, I forgot that doesn't\nshow up on that start screen.\n\n635\n00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.300\nThe design themes show up on that one,\n\n636\n00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.910\nthat's why I showed you\nthe rainbow was showing up, but\n\n637\n00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:25.730\nmy actual template of my starting point\nshows up in the custom templates.\n\n638\n00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.550\nSo once I go ahead and do that,\nnow you can see, cuz it did not open,\n\n639\n00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.760\nlook at the Title bar,\nit did not open pink template.\n\n640\n00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.440\nDid it?\n\n641\n00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.130\nIt started a new presentation\nbased off that template.\n\n642\n00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.511\nIt's kinda like made a little stamp.\n\n643\n00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:40.943\nAnd actually since I had added those two\nother slides, it remembered that as well.\n\n644\n00:30:40.943 --> 00:30:42.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's part of your template now.\n\n645\n00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:43.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n646\n00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:48.010\nSo, another point of where if you'd\nalways wanted to have specific slides.\n\n647\n00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.900\nLike you always are gonna start off\nwith certain context slide, and\n\n648\n00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.140\nalways have an image slide.\n\n649\n00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.660\nYou can always save that,\nas type of your template.\n\n650\n00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.090\nAnd you can move forward with that.\n\n651\n00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:03.010\nAnd that's a great launching point for\nyou to create a presentation.\n\n652\n00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:05.670\nIn a specific way that you want it to be.\n\n653\n00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.530\n&gt;&gt; Alright Vonne, fantastic stuff there.\n\n654\n00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.410\nReally good look at what we can do,\n\n655\n00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.740\nif we want to start customizing\nour PowerPoint presentation.\n\n656\n00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.660\nWorking with that slide master,\n\n657\n00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:19.140\nallows me to make changes that\napply to entire presentations.\n\n658\n00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.232\nWe saw we could save those.\n\n659\n00:31:21.232 --> 00:31:24.878\nWe could create our own templates for\nreuse in the future.\n\n660\n00:31:24.878 --> 00:31:27.953\nGreat stuff and Vonne,\nI know you've got more to go over, but\n\n661\n00:31:27.953 --> 00:31:31.160\nunfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n662\n00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.580\nSo we're gonna have to wait and\ncome back for a Part 2 for those.\n\n663\n00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.420\nSo, hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n664\n00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.420\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n665\n00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.290\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.500\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.420\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.979\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our Advanced PowerPoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:23.384\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're actually continuing\n\n7\n00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:25.600\nour thought process on slide masters.\n\n8\n00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.800\nThis is part two, so\n\n9\n00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.750\nif you missed part one make sure\nyou go and check that one out.\n\n10\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.660\nWe did some really cool stuff\nwith our slide masters.\n\n11\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.442\nBut, as I said a minute ago, there is\nmore to do with our slide masters and\n\n12\n00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:39.861\nmaybe even a couple of other masters\nwe might be able to work with.\n\n13\n00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:42.365\nAnd here to help us with that,\nof course, is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n14\n00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:43.075\nWelcome back, Vonne.\n\n15\n00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:45.830\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nyes we have multiple masters actually.\n\n16\n00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.948\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we were doing our slide\n\n17\n00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:54.855\nmaster that was controlling our slides and\nwhat the slides look like and the layouts.\n\n18\n00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:59.519\nBut there are other pieces that\nwe can use in PowerPoint besides\n\n19\n00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.644\njust the onscreen slides [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Slides, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:04.222\n&gt;&gt; Those things are a [LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:08.420\nWe also have things like notes, and\nwe have hand outs that we can use and\n\n22\n00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.280\nthose have their own masters.\n\n23\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.888\nIf you might have seen when\nwe were going in to the view,\n\n24\n00:01:12.888 --> 00:01:16.790\nthere are buttons off the side that\nhad Note Master and Hand-out Master?\n\n25\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.924\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well that's why we're back.\n\n26\n00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:18.712\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n27\n00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:19.970\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna explain those.\n\n28\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.375\nSo let's jump in and\n\n29\n00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:26.251\nstart up a PowerPoint I'm just going\nto set with a blank document, and\n\n30\n00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:31.709\nwhen we come in here, now a little tidbit,\nmy pink template did show up.\n\n31\n00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:32.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.980\n&gt;&gt; In the featured list, it just had,\nI had to use it enough for\n\n33\n00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.430\nit to remember, hey you're gonna do this,\nall right, let's go with it.\n\n34\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.600\nAnd it's actually bringing up the ones\nthat maybe I use a little bit\n\n35\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.670\nmore frequently.\n\n36\n00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.340\nRather than the ones that,\nbecause the rainbow one was up there for\n\n37\n00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.738\nawhile because I had used it,\nnow it's gone.\n\n38\n00:01:49.738 --> 00:01:50.782\n&gt;&gt; You stopped using it.\n\n39\n00:01:50.782 --> 00:01:53.746\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, so\nwhy don't we go ahead and do this one?\n\n40\n00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.117\nAnd I can just go ahead and create.\n\n41\n00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:57.680\nI think I accidentally clicked and.\n\n42\n00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.650\nI did something where it actually\nbrought that little box up.\n\n43\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.300\nThat's okay.\n\n44\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.780\nYou can always just click the create\nbutton rather than you know,\n\n45\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.880\nbecause I didn't double click.\n\n46\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.480\nThat's what it was.\n\n47\n00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.204\nI single clicked on it,\nand it just brought it up.\n\n48\n00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:08.510\nActually, what did I just do?\n\n49\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.220\nWhy did it do that?\n\n50\n00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.389\nThat's what I did.\n\n51\n00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:15.335\nWhere's the Note Master and\nwhat does the Note Master do?\n\n52\n00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:16.395\nLet's review.\n\n53\n00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:18.335\nWhat is the Note's View?\n\n54\n00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:21.845\nIf I go into the file and I go into Print,\n\n55\n00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:27.485\nyou can print out the Note's Page and\nif I go into the Notes,\n\n56\n00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:31.655\nit's going to show whatever speaker notes\nthat I had added to my presentation.\n\n57\n00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:33.754\nNow I have three blanks slides right now,\nso\n\n58\n00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:35.805\nit doesn't really show much of anything.\n\n59\n00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:38.840\nSo it has that same link again, so weird.\n\n60\n00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.220\nSo it's not gonna show me\nanything right now but\n\n61\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.750\nif I add speaker notes to my slide it's\njust gonna go ahead and show up down here.\n\n62\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.840\nBut before I start adding speaker notes.\n\n63\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.190\nI wanted to go into the notes master,\nfor couple of different things.\n\n64\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.288\nOne, I want to be able to control what\nit's going to look like when I print it\n\n65\n00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:57.037\nout on that page.\n\n66\n00:02:57.037 --> 00:03:01.530\nBecause I might have a lot of notes\nthat I need to add, to my slides.\n\n67\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.820\nMaybe four paragraphs of because, I want\nto make sure I have all the information\n\n68\n00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.350\nof whatever topic that I'm talking about\nand I want to have it right there.\n\n69\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.630\nBut there's only so much space for those\nspeaker notes and the slides really big.\n\n70\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.910\nWell, what if I made the slide smaller and\nthe notes area bigger?\n\n71\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.634\nAnd that will go follow all the notes\npages that I'm gonna print out.\n\n72\n00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:23.130\nThat would be really helpful.\n\n73\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.964\nThe other thing that we could do\nby formatting the notes master,\n\n74\n00:03:26.964 --> 00:03:31.652\nbefore we add speaker notes is that when\nI start adding the speaker notes in it.\n\n75\n00:03:31.652 --> 00:03:38.179\nIt will format to whatever I tell\nthe Notes Master to be because by default,\n\n76\n00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.322\nI can go ahead and\ncome in to here add the notes and\n\n77\n00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.760\nit's just going to format regularly.\n\n78\n00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.459\nWhat if I wanted that to\nbe a little bit bigger,\n\n79\n00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.997\nwhat if I wanted it to be bold what if\nI wanted it to be a different font.\n\n80\n00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:55.626\nYou could come in here and format, you do\nsome basic formatting In this view but\n\n81\n00:03:55.626 --> 00:04:01.001\nwon't do colors and everything here but\nI could go into the Notes Master and\n\n82\n00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.560\nhave it all preformatted\nbefore I start typing.\n\n83\n00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.979\nNow, do I have to do this?\n\n84\n00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:10.772\nNo, if you have a full presentation and\nyou want to make the speaker notes bigger,\n\n85\n00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:13.343\njust like we had done\nwith the slidemaster in\n\n86\n00:04:13.343 --> 00:04:17.490\nthe previous episode is we had\nan already created presentation.\n\n87\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.960\nWe went ahead and\nmodified the slidemaster, same thing here.\n\n88\n00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.360\nSo I don't want you to think I\nhave to format the notesmaster\n\n89\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.860\nbefore I add speaker notes.\n\n90\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.040\nIt can be either one.\n\n91\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.207\nIt's just since I hadn't done it,\nI figure we go there first.\n\n92\n00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:34.960\nSo I am going to undo and\ntake away those notes.\n\n93\n00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.100\nAnd how do I get to the notes master?\n\n94\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.757\nWe go back to our view tab, we go into our\nnotes master, and I accidentally clicked\n\n95\n00:04:41.757 --> 00:04:45.827\non the themes, when I clicked on that,\nso that's why that box came up.\n\n96\n00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:49.523\nAnd, so now I have the view of our notes.\n\n97\n00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:50.710\nWhat do I want to do?\n\n98\n00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.530\nI want to make the slide\na little bit smaller.\n\n99\n00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.460\nSo, I'm going to take this and\nmove the side.\n\n100\n00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.970\nOr make the slide a little smaller.\n\n101\n00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.790\nI can move this.\n\n102\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.360\nMaybe I want this up in\nthe upper right hand corner.\n\n103\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.490\nYou can move where the header.\n\n104\n00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.792\nI don't know if I really wanna take\nthe header and move it anywhere else,\n\n105\n00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:05.220\ncuz headers kinda [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n106\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.196\n&gt;&gt; Should go to the top really.\n\n107\n00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:07.695\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But you can.\n\n108\n00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:09.125\nYou can do whatever you want honestly.\n\n109\n00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:11.600\nAnd I would keep the footers and\neverything in the same place but\n\n110\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.830\nI can go ahead and click on this box.\n\n111\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.425\nMaybe move this box up,\nmaybe make it a little longer so\n\n112\n00:05:17.425 --> 00:05:21.334\nthat way it will allow more notes\nthat I add into that speaker\n\n113\n00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:24.394\nnotes to be able to be\nseen on the printed page.\n\n114\n00:05:24.394 --> 00:05:29.963\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit so\nwe can see this a little easier and\n\n115\n00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:35.000\nthis is where you can come\ninto this text and modify it.\n\n116\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.180\nYou can come into our Home tab.\n\n117\n00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.820\nLet's make it bold and\nlet's make it a little bit bigger.\n\n118\n00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.110\nI'm not gonna format the second\nlevels because I don't really\n\n119\n00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.060\nneed that for right now.\n\n120\n00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.674\nBut if you were going to be adding\nbulleted list to your speaker notes you\n\n121\n00:05:48.674 --> 00:05:50.602\ncould go ahead and format but I know for\n\n122\n00:05:50.602 --> 00:05:53.391\nthis particular presentation\nI'm not gonna need it.\n\n123\n00:05:53.391 --> 00:05:56.715\nSo I'm gonna just take out\nall the other levels and\n\n124\n00:05:56.715 --> 00:06:01.320\nthen just this is what I want my notes\nto look like when I type them out.\n\n125\n00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.140\nGo ahead and zoom back out, so\n\n126\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.440\nnow I've manipulated how\nthe notes page is going to look.\n\n127\n00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.030\nLet's leave our Notes Master by coming\nover to our Notes Tab, closing that.\n\n128\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.600\nAnd if I start typing in my speaker\nnotes you can see, blah, blah, blah,\n\n129\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.264\nblah, blah, blah, blah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:06:18.264 --> 00:06:20.310\n&gt;&gt; It is formatted to be this a little bit\n\n131\n00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.280\nbolder.\n\n132\n00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.190\nIt's not and it is a little bit bigger\nhere if I go over to my file tab and\n\n133\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.640\ngo over to print,\nyou can see that it will print out.\n\n134\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.280\nThis is where you can\nreally see that font size\n\n135\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.920\nbecause it's going to print\njust like I told it too.\n\n136\n00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.650\nThe slide will be up in\nthe upper right hand corner and\n\n137\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.430\nthis gives me a lot more real estate for\nme to be able to be working with my notes.\n\n138\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.290\n&gt;&gt; I really like modifying\nthat Notes Master.\n\n139\n00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.470\nOne, you can make it bigger.\n\n140\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.120\nLike you said the hold more notes or\nchange the fonts so\n\n141\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.160\nit's easier to read while you're\ngiving your presentation.\n\n142\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.830\nBut I really love changing the size\nof that slide because as you and\n\n143\n00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.983\nI know if we're using an ink jet printer,\nI mean, that ink is expensive.\n\n144\n00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:05.170\nIf we're using a color printer at work.\n\n145\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.490\nIt can eat up a lot of ink,\nmake my page curl up.\n\n146\n00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.650\nAnd I don't need to see the whole slide.\n\n147\n00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.390\nI know what the slides are, I made them.\n\n148\n00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.900\nI just need a little hint to\nremember what slide I'm on\n\n149\n00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.430\nwhen I start talking about this.\n\n150\n00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great point yeah.\n\n151\n00:07:16.224 --> 00:07:19.249\nI didn't even think about\nthat the printing part, so\n\n152\n00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:23.755\nthat's a fantastic reason why and talking\nabout like l know what slide I'm on,\n\n153\n00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:27.560\nl just about like if you see\nthe slide number down here.\n\n154\n00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.664\nThat's in the bottom righthand corner.\n\n155\n00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:29.810\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n156\n00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.878\n&gt;&gt; You could make that really big.\n\n157\n00:07:30.878 --> 00:07:32.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You could even up that up to the,\n\n158\n00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:38.090\nright next to the slide, so that way you\nknow what slide number that you're on.\n\n159\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.410\nSo, being able to control your environment\nis the name of the game, really.\n\n160\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.990\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Like, the notes obey that master.\n\n161\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.809\nAnd I'm the master and\nI will tell you what to do.\n\n162\n00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:51.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's a great way to control that.\n\n163\n00:07:51.898 --> 00:07:54.380\n&gt;&gt; And then, Vonne we have one\nmore mastery thing, I think,\n\n164\n00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.300\nif I saw the buttons correctly there.\n\n165\n00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.196\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I was jumping ahead of you.\n\n166\n00:07:57.196 --> 00:08:00.820\n[LAUGH] Yes, there is the notes master.\n\n167\n00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.840\nWhile we're here, we did come into our\nprinting options of the last series of\n\n168\n00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.180\nwhere we went over that.\n\n169\n00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.189\nI always go to that drop down.\n\n170\n00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:09.937\nIt's this one that I wanna go to.\n\n171\n00:08:09.937 --> 00:08:14.242\nHow I want to change my\nsix horizontal layout, or\n\n172\n00:08:14.242 --> 00:08:20.980\nmy four slide layout, these\nare controlled by the handouts master.\n\n173\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.440\nI will say, how much do you really\nneed to modify the handout master.\n\n174\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.775\nIt's just the cool kind\nof name of the game and\n\n175\n00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:32.661\nI feel like if I want four slides on\na page, you put the four slides on a page.\n\n176\n00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:35.900\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, they have one through\nnine as a choice right there for you.\n\n177\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.630\nSo, unless you wanted to arrange\nthe six slides differently maybe?\n\n178\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.020\n&gt;&gt; I would say if you really just\nwanted to make the headers and\n\n179\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.890\nfooter a little bit more pronounced.\n\n180\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.040\nThat's to me the biggest advantage\nto going into the hand outs master.\n\n181\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.970\nWhy don't we go into it and\nsee what we could do?\n\n182\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.510\nLet's go to the view tab.\n\n183\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.491\nLet's go to the handout master.\n\n184\n00:08:55.491 --> 00:09:00.200\nSo here it is, the four slides per page.\n\n185\n00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.740\nAnd maybe I want to\nchange the orientation.\n\n186\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm, that's true.\n&gt;&gt; That may be one thing you could do.\n\n187\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.560\nYou want to have it\nlandscape versus portrait.\n\n188\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.956\nThe slide's size,\nmaybe you want to be four by three,\n\n189\n00:09:11.956 --> 00:09:15.150\nrather than the six by nine.\n\n190\n00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.908\nI mean that's something you could do,\nof how you want it to print, but\n\n191\n00:09:18.908 --> 00:09:23.376\nif you're have wide screen size,\nthen having not print in wide screens.\n\n192\n00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:26.682\nI feel like it just kind of throws\neverything off, and you either get\n\n193\n00:09:26.682 --> 00:09:30.982\nthe black bars, if you're doing the four\nby three, to six, yeah, it doesn't match.\n\n194\n00:09:30.982 --> 00:09:34.305\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I can't even watch TV\nanymore unless they're stretched in\n\n195\n00:09:34.305 --> 00:09:34.932\nextra wide.\n\n196\n00:09:34.932 --> 00:09:37.761\nYou know how you watch the four\nby three and you zoom it out?\n\n197\n00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:39.419\n&gt;&gt; You're still watching shows in 4 by 3?\n\n198\n00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.075\n&gt;&gt; Kidding, kidding\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:42.452\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What are you watching?\n\n200\n00:09:42.452 --> 00:09:44.369\n&gt;&gt; I always like watching\nthe football games and\n\n201\n00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:46.189\nall the players are really short and wide.\n\n202\n00:09:46.189 --> 00:09:50.119\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe they try to play better\n\n203\n00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:50.724\nthat way.\n\n204\n00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:51.917\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to cover more ground.\n\n205\n00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:54.769\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n206\n00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:59.042\n&gt;&gt; But good points, I mean there are some\nthings that if you're a person that uses\n\n207\n00:09:59.042 --> 00:10:03.318\nthat handout Format quite often there\nmight be somethings you want to tweak and\n\n208\n00:10:03.318 --> 00:10:04.920\nthis is where you will do it.\n\n209\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.432\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n210\n00:10:05.432 --> 00:10:08.674\nThe other thing is though you can't\neven move around those boxes.\n\n211\n00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:09.961\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n212\n00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:14.549\n&gt;&gt; So when you wanted to move around the\nlocation, you can't really even do that.\n\n213\n00:10:14.549 --> 00:10:15.864\n&gt;&gt; What about the slide per page,\n\n214\n00:10:15.864 --> 00:10:18.692\nis that just changing between\nthe different pre-made layouts?\n\n215\n00:10:18.692 --> 00:10:19.250\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n216\n00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.990\nSo if I wanted to change the three size,\nbut I still can't, but\n\n217\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:27.390\nI can move the slide number and\nthe footer but that at least\n\n218\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.470\nthat three slide layer is nice because\nit adds those lines automatically.\n\n219\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.194\nSo I think honestly, [CROSSTALK] all the\nhand outs that they give me I don't really\n\n220\n00:10:36.194 --> 00:10:37.453\nneed to modify that.\n\n221\n00:10:37.453 --> 00:10:42.230\nThe notes master yes, the slide master\ndefinitely yes, but the hand outs.\n\n222\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:48.140\nI probably say to add maybe you wanted\na constant title, if you wanted to always\n\n223\n00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.280\nhave your company name but you didn't\nwanna add it as a header and footer.\n\n224\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.519\n&gt;&gt; Yeah copyright information,\npage number information for\n\n225\n00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:58.578\ninternal use only or something like that.\n\n226\n00:10:58.578 --> 00:11:01.359\n&gt;&gt; What if you wanna put\nyour company logo on it?\n\n227\n00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:02.736\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, company logo there you go.\n\n228\n00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:06.212\n&gt;&gt; See look at that just by talking about\nit we're figuring out uses of why we could\n\n229\n00:11:06.212 --> 00:11:08.120\ngo head and\nput the handout in that server.\n\n230\n00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.883\nBecause I'm thinking along the lines of\nlike changing how the layout looks and\n\n231\n00:11:12.883 --> 00:11:17.430\neverything but I've kind of forgot\nhonestly you could insert anything you\n\n232\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.553\nwanted in here,\nif I wanted to put a star in the top.\n\n233\n00:11:20.553 --> 00:11:21.876\nI could put a star in there.\n\n234\n00:11:21.876 --> 00:11:24.370\n&gt;&gt; Water marks maybe, or\n&gt;&gt; Water marks, yes.\n\n235\n00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.730\nI could go ahead and put in pictures.\n\n236\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.570\nI could go ahead and,\nlet's throw in that logo.\n\n237\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.949\nWhy don't we throw in our\nIT Pro TV logo and there we go.\n\n238\n00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:32.990\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n239\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.320\n&gt;&gt; And we'll put that right there.\n\n240\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.764\n[LAUGH] And then this is\na perfect example of maybe why\n\n241\n00:11:40.764 --> 00:11:43.176\nadd a little bit more pizzazz.\n\n242\n00:11:43.176 --> 00:11:47.149\nA little bit more personality\ncustomization to your hand-outs because\n\n243\n00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:49.240\nit's something that you do use a lot.\n\n244\n00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.340\nAnd you want people to remember that\nthis is the company that you're using.\n\n245\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.550\nBecause maybe they don't see\nthe logo on the slide so\n\n246\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.700\nmuch or you needed to add something\nspecifically for just that hand-out.\n\n247\n00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:05.760\nYou can add other elements to your\nhandouts besides just the layouts and\n\n248\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.440\nthe headers and footers.\n\n249\n00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, again,\nanother great look.\n\n250\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.499\nReally showing us all the different\nthings in PowerPoint that we can tweak,\n\n251\n00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.110\nmodify to make it our own, right.\n\n252\n00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.580\n&gt;&gt; We don't have to use PowerPoint\nlike it is out of the box.\n\n253\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.585\nJust about everything in\nthere's customizable.\n\n254\n00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:23.394\nWhen it's all about you know,\ntrying to take the things that we have\n\n255\n00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:26.551\nto do every time we get a new presentation\nand not necessarily automate but,\n\n256\n00:12:26.551 --> 00:12:29.245\nyou know, set it up to where we\ndon't have to do that every time.\n\n257\n00:12:29.245 --> 00:12:33.375\nSo, we can modify that slide master,\nwe can modify the notes master,\n\n258\n00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:37.855\nwe can modify that handout master,\nwe saw on the first part of this episode,\n\n259\n00:12:37.855 --> 00:12:40.730\nthat we can modify our theme,\nwe can save those.\n\n260\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.870\nWe can set up new themes.\n\n261\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.380\nSo lots of great customization\noptions within PowerPoint.\n\n262\n00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.686\nSo Vonne, anything else you want to\nadd before we close this one out?\n\n263\n00:12:48.686 --> 00:12:52.216\n&gt;&gt; There is one slide\nmaster to rule them all.\n\n264\n00:12:52.216 --> 00:12:55.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nwords of wisdom from Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n265\n00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.690\nHope everybody enjoyed watching this one.\n\n266\n00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.730\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n267\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.630\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n268\n00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.169\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n269\n00:13:03.169 -->

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:15.565\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:20.040\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our advanced PowerPoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.391\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna learn how to link and\n\n7\n00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:26.610\nembed external content into\nour PowerPoint presentation.\n\n8\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.470\nHere to show us how to do all\nof that is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.410\nWelcome back Vonne.\n\n10\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.290\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.310\nYes, we're going to be taking\ninformation from other places and\n\n12\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.800\nputting it into PowerPoint.\n\n13\n00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.390\nNow this isn't just a copy and paste, like\nI'm going to copy something out of a Word\n\n14\n00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.780\ndocument and then put in the text\ninto my PowerPoint presentation.\n\n15\n00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.670\nThis is taking it one step further.\n\n16\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.770\nThis is actually taking content\nfrom somewhere else and\n\n17\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.240\nlinking it,\nputting it into our presentation and\n\n18\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.760\ncreating that connection to\nthat data from wherever it is.\n\n19\n00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.028\nFor example,\nlet's say we have an Excel Chart, or\n\n20\n00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:05.514\nwe have information in Excel in a table,\nor however it's formatted.\n\n21\n00:01:05.514 --> 00:01:09.747\nAnd these are the weekly sales\nnumbers that I'm always going to have\n\n22\n00:01:09.747 --> 00:01:13.510\nto be presenting to the sales\nteam at our weekly meeting.\n\n23\n00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.028\nWhy would I want to go ahead and recreate\nthat every single time in PowerPoint if\n\n24\n00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:19.816\nI've already got it in Excel?\n\n25\n00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:23.514\nIf it changes in Excel,\nI want it to change in PowerPoint so\n\n26\n00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:28.200\nyou can create that linked information and\nhave it ready to go at any time.\n\n27\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.950\nSo I think that is a really\nhandy way of being able to use\n\n28\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.350\noffice products across the board and\nbe able to say bring this into there and\n\n29\n00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.580\nyou can do this across multiple programs.\n\n30\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.680\nSo it doesn't just go one way but\n\n31\n00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.680\nbeing able to have that content\nlinked is going to be important.\n\n32\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.680\nAnd I have a PowerPoint\npresentation ready to go,\n\n33\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.780\nthat's going to give us a couple\nmore tidbits of information before\n\n34\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.450\nwe actually start adding some information,\nadding that external content.\n\n35\n00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.440\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njump right into our link and\n\n36\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.900\nembed PowerPoint presentation.\n\n37\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.590\nAnd on slide two,\n\n38\n00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.160\nit is going to cover some of\nthe information that I want to talk about.\n\n39\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.280\nBut before we get into slide two,\nwhat is this?\n\n40\n00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.870\nWhat's going on here?\n\n41\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.493\nWell, I actually already put in some\nlinked content into this PowerPoint\n\n42\n00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:18.353\npresentation to show you what it looks\nlike before we actually do it ourself.\n\n43\n00:02:18.353 --> 00:02:21.495\nAnd this right here is giving me\na warn and says, hey guess what?\n\n44\n00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:23.365\nYou are link to other files.\n\n45\n00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:27.045\nAre you sure that you want to be able to\nretrieve all the information from that\n\n46\n00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:31.175\nfile and do you know where it\ncame from and are, is this safe?\n\n47\n00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:32.800\nAre you sure you wanna do this?\n\n48\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.029\nI know where I got this content.\n\n49\n00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.090\nI know where it came from.\n\n50\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.880\nIt came from me, so I think we're okay.\n\n51\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.130\nSo we're gonna go ahead and update this\nlink and be able to say, yes go ahead and\n\n52\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.750\ndo that.\n\n53\n00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.030\n&gt;&gt; It's a great point to make that.\n\n54\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.746\nYou might download a presentation,\na demo or something from the internet or\n\n55\n00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:50.889\nget something sent to you by\nsomebody you don't know that well.\n\n56\n00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.966\nAnd all of a sudden you try to open it\nup and it says it's reaching out and\n\n57\n00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:59.269\ngetting content from somewhere else,\ndo you really trust that, right?\n\n58\n00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.365\nYou've got to be careful because it\ncould do bad things to your machine or\n\n59\n00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:02.950\nyour data.\n\n60\n00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nYou should always be careful and\n\n61\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.100\nI'm always glad I'm doing these\nepisodes with you because\n\n62\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.295\nyou know all about the security.\n\n63\n00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:10.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it was a great time\n\n64\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.384\nfiller because you see, it took a little\nbit of time for that to actually to\n\n65\n00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:18.608\nstart up a little bit because it was going\nout to find all of those links, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:18.608 --> 00:03:23.098\nYou, cuz when I made this file it was\nlike, you told me where that file was.\n\n67\n00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:26.727\nSo, I'm going to go out into your file\nsystem, and go ahead find that file,\n\n68\n00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:29.340\nget the information, update the content.\n\n69\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.144\nIf you have multiple files that are linked\ninto this PowerPoint presentation,\n\n70\n00:03:33.144 --> 00:03:36.433\nit might take a little bit for\nit to kind of scan and find everything and\n\n71\n00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:40.034\nsay alright now I'm ready to go ahead and\ndisplay the information for you.\n\n72\n00:03:40.034 --> 00:03:41.392\nSo thank you for that time filler.\n\n73\n00:03:41.392 --> 00:03:43.250\n&gt;&gt; You're very welcome.\n\n74\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.690\n&gt;&gt; On slide two you can see that,\nwhat is the difference between linking and\n\n75\n00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.230\nembedding content into our files?\n\n76\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.000\nLinking does create that source connection\nor that connection to that source file.\n\n77\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.407\nAnd then if you're wanting to edit\nthat information in your slide,\n\n78\n00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:04.510\nwhen you double-click on it, it's going to\nactually open up into that Word file or\n\n79\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.340\nExcel file that you told\nit to make that link to.\n\n80\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.310\nAs opposed to embedding content, if you're\nembedding content into your slides,\n\n81\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.790\nthere isn't a connection to that source.\n\n82\n00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.920\nSo if you make any changes to the source\nfile, it's not gonna make any changes\n\n83\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.850\nin the PowerPoint presentation,\nand that way it's just in there.\n\n84\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.497\nSo, but it's a little bit more than again\njust copy and pasting because that, to me,\n\n85\n00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:27.844\nI'm like, well,\nthat's just copying and pasting.\n\n86\n00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:29.882\nIt is, but it isn't.\n\n87\n00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:31.143\nAnd one of my favorite sayings.\n\n88\n00:04:31.143 --> 00:04:34.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is but not, you know.\n\n89\n00:04:34.088 --> 00:04:36.880\nDouble clicking into\nthe item in PowerPoint,\n\n90\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.531\nyou're going to actually stay\nin PowerPoint the program but\n\n91\n00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:44.824\nits gonna look like your opening up\nthat Word file or opening up Excel but\n\n92\n00:04:44.824 --> 00:04:49.000\nit's just using that, its almost like,\nits a picture in a picture.\n\n93\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.390\nIt's kind of like right now\nlike a box in a box, right?\n\n94\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.510\nI'm in power point and I'm kind of in\nWord or Excel, but I'm not really.\n\n95\n00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.072\nYou'll see what I mean\nin just a second and\n\n96\n00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:03.770\nyou will kinda get in\nthis weird limbo world.\n\n97\n00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.810\nSo I wanted to put a point right here of\nmaking sure you hit the escape key or\n\n98\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.510\nyou click on another area\nof your slide to exit it,\n\n99\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.870\nbecause it can be a little confusing where\nyou think you're clicking the close button\n\n100\n00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.560\nand you're actually closing PowerPoint.\n\n101\n00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.670\nSo you wanna make sure\nthat you don't do that.\n\n102\n00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.775\nAnd I can't tell you how\nmany times I have done that.\n\n103\n00:05:21.775 --> 00:05:22.347\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n104\n00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:26.569\nI wanted to make sure you had this in\nthis slide as a reference as don't click\n\n105\n00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:27.930\nthe close button.\n\n106\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.360\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n107\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.680\nSo here is slide three.\n\n108\n00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.470\nIt all kind of looks the same.\n\n109\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.250\nWell I guess not really looks the same\nsince one says bunny trail and\n\n110\n00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.298\none says rabbit hole, but [LAUGH].\n\n111\n00:05:38.298 --> 00:05:40.481\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the idea here is that,\n\n112\n00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:44.530\nthis is an example of copied\ntext from a Word file.\n\n113\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.510\nAnd if I change, resize this,\nthis is really just a content placeholder,\n\n114\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.540\nlike a Text Box, and it has text,\nand I go ahead and change it.\n\n115\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.700\nAnd I could format it from within\nPowerpoint, cuz it's just copied text.\n\n116\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.490\nThis one right here,\nif I stretch it out so\n\n117\n00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.163\nit's not, that's not doing\nwhat I thought it would do.\n\n118\n00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:06.950\nSo what's going on here?\n\n119\n00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.950\nSame thing if I make\nthe third one different.\n\n120\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.500\nI just wanna show you that like\ntrying to resize it is not\n\n121\n00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.340\ndoing the same things as just like regular\ntext because it's not regular text.\n\n122\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.720\nThis is examples of linked and\nembedded content.\n\n123\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.200\nHow do I know the difference?\n\n124\n00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:29.100\nIf I double click on this item,\nyou see how it's going to open up in\n\n125\n00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.000\nwhat looks like word,\nbut you're not in word.\n\n126\n00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.660\nLook at my taskbar down at the bottom,\nI still only have PowerPoint open.\n\n127\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.050\nI do not have word the program opened,\nso it's like this.\n\n128\n00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.257\nOops sorry I already, sorry about that\nI already clicked on another area of\n\n129\n00:06:48.257 --> 00:06:53.978\nthe slide to actually get me out of that\nword environment from within PowerPoint.\n\n130\n00:06:53.978 --> 00:06:58.346\nLet me show you the difference so\nyou can have something to contrast with,\n\n131\n00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:02.373\nif I double click on the third one\nI'm now actually in the word file.\n\n132\n00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:08.316\nDo you see how the word application is\nopened on my computer and the title says,\n\n133\n00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:13.357\nAlice Text.doc and this is the whole\nfile from where this came from\n\n134\n00:07:13.357 --> 00:07:18.244\nbecause this is the linked content,\nnot the embedded content.\n\n135\n00:07:18.244 --> 00:07:23.205\nAnd to prove it one more time,\nif I go ahead and\n\n136\n00:07:23.205 --> 00:07:28.037\nchange like, let's make this purple, and\n\n137\n00:07:28.037 --> 00:07:32.500\nthen let's go ahead and add the forest.\n\n138\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.790\nI have no idea well [LAUGH].\n\n139\n00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was making things up and\n\n140\n00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.480\nthat's how you spell forest, right?\n\n141\n00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.270\n&gt;&gt; It is now.\n\n142\n00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.211\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n[LAUGH] that's\n\n143\n00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:39.740\nwhy there's always spell check.\n\n144\n00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.466\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you spell check because I'm\n\n145\n00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:42.161\na horrible speller.\n\n146\n00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:44.205\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I always got ends in spelling.\n\n147\n00:07:44.205 --> 00:07:45.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I was in school.\n\n148\n00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.755\nI probably tell you all of that but\nthat's what happened.\n\n149\n00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:53.706\nSo if I save the changes here in Word and\nI close Word,\n\n150\n00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:58.184\nyou can see that the changes have been.\n\n151\n00:07:58.184 --> 00:08:03.678\nCommitted here in PowerPoint because\nit is connected to that file.\n\n152\n00:08:03.678 --> 00:08:04.869\nWhich can be, again,\n\n153\n00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:08.550\nvery handy if I'm just going to\nbe always reusing that content.\n\n154\n00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.990\nThese are my sales number and\nnot just from Word.\n\n155\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.028\nI'm using Word just because I wanted to\nshow you the difference of what it can be\n\n156\n00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:18.332\nvery deceiving in your file that\nI don't know if that is linked,\n\n157\n00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:19.818\nembedded, or just copied.\n\n158\n00:08:19.818 --> 00:08:23.508\nAnd so\nbeing able to know the difference and\n\n159\n00:08:23.508 --> 00:08:26.899\nwhat to do with it is pretty important.\n\n160\n00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:29.920\nNow how do I actually get\nthis content into my slides?\n\n161\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.569\nThere's two main ways\nthat you can do this.\n\n162\n00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:36.543\nYou can do a copy from your external\nfile like a Word or Excel document.\n\n163\n00:08:36.543 --> 00:08:39.234\nAnd then you come in here and\nyou can Paste Special.\n\n164\n00:08:39.234 --> 00:08:43.651\nIt's not just regular Ctrl+V or going into\nthe Smart options with the little when you\n\n165\n00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:45.501\npaste it and then you can change it.\n\n166\n00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:50.263\nWhether it's like using\nthe destination theme or\n\n167\n00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.243\nthe-\n&gt;&gt; Source theme.\n\n168\n00:08:51.243 --> 00:08:53.227\n&gt;&gt; Source theme, thank you.\n\n169\n00:08:53.227 --> 00:08:55.646\nThere's other ways.\n\n170\n00:08:55.646 --> 00:08:58.879\nIt's going into the dropdown from here.\n\n171\n00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:02.549\nI'm gonna show you the Paste button\non the Home tab is that there is\n\n172\n00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:04.170\na Paste Special dot dot dot.\n\n173\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:09.008\nThat's what I'm talking about because it's\ngoing to give you those different options\n\n174\n00:09:09.008 --> 00:09:12.881\nof whether you want to paste it as a link,\ncreating that link content.\n\n175\n00:09:12.881 --> 00:09:14.898\nOr you can just paste it but\n\n176\n00:09:14.898 --> 00:09:19.670\njust that fancier paste of\njust embedding the content.\n\n177\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.930\nLike that example that we did in Word.\n\n178\n00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.620\nAnd this is nice, because it will isolate\nspecific content in a source document.\n\n179\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.460\nI didn't want all of the information\nin the alicetext.docx.\n\n180\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.190\nI just wanted that one paragraph.\n\n181\n00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.080\nOr, for example, in Excel,\nI don't want all 15 spreadsheets.\n\n182\n00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.490\nI just want that one\nsection of one spreadsheet.\n\n183\n00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.510\nSo this is the way that you would probably\nwant to use it to specify only that\n\n184\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.130\nrange or that amount of area,\nthe amount of content that I wanna\n\n185\n00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.270\nput in this PowerPoint presentation or\nthis particular slide.\n\n186\n00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:56.480\nThe other way that you could do this\nis insert the object from file.\n\n187\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.280\nThe thing that's different about this one\nis that you are going to be inserting\n\n188\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.439\nthe entire file.\n\n189\n00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.620\nSo it would add all of the Word content.\n\n190\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.480\nIt would add whatever is showing.\n\n191\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.050\nWell, if you wanna say the physical\nspace that you're occupying in Excel.\n\n192\n00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.842\nSo if you have a lot of cells,\nit's gonna show you all of them.\n\n193\n00:10:15.842 --> 00:10:20.515\nAnd it also depends on what spreadsheet\nyou had last left off when you save it.\n\n194\n00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:25.170\nSo it could be a good or bad thing,\ndepending on what your intentions are.\n\n195\n00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.680\nIf I have just a little bit of\ninformation, and I want the whole file to\n\n196\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.450\nshow, then that's a great option to do is\njust go ahead and inserting as a object.\n\n197\n00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.769\nAnd you can check whether\nyou want it linked or\n\n198\n00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:42.892\nembedded to create a connection or\nnot a connection.\n\n199\n00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:46.863\nAnytime that you are going to be adding\nlinked contents into your PowerPoint\n\n200\n00:10:46.863 --> 00:10:50.537\npresentation, you do need to be\nfamiliar with the Links Dialogs Box.\n\n201\n00:10:50.537 --> 00:10:53.700\nWhere does this live and what is it do?\n\n202\n00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.461\nThis is a way that you can tell whether or\nnot you have linked content.\n\n203\n00:10:57.461 --> 00:10:58.291\nLet me show you.\n\n204\n00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:02.084\nIf you go over to file and\nyou go down here on the info,\n\n205\n00:11:02.084 --> 00:11:05.760\nif you scroll down,\nI see Edit links to files.\n\n206\n00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.630\nIf you see this, then you do have linked\ncontent in your PowerPoint presentation.\n\n207\n00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.532\nIf this is not an option, if it doesn't\neven have under related documents,\n\n208\n00:11:16.532 --> 00:11:21.607\nit does not have this option, that means\nyou do not have any linked documents.\n\n209\n00:11:21.607 --> 00:11:25.604\nYou could have embedded documents,\nbut you have no linked documents.\n\n210\n00:11:25.604 --> 00:11:28.285\nLet's go ahead and\nopen this dialog box just so\n\n211\n00:11:28.285 --> 00:11:31.740\nyou can see that I already do\nhave some linked files in here.\n\n212\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.220\nAnd you do have some options\nin here of whether or\n\n213\n00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.920\nnot you want it to update,\nyou could even open the source from\n\n214\n00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.570\nhere rather than doing the double-clicking\nthat I told you about.\n\n215\n00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.410\nYou could use this there, or\nuse this option from this dialog box.\n\n216\n00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.875\nMaybe you changed the source,\ncuz I maybe moved that\n\n217\n00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:55.040\nAliceText.docx from my desktop or\nfrom a specific folder to another folder.\n\n218\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.170\nWell, it's gonna always remember the link\nthat you told it when you first copied or\n\n219\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.330\ninserted that.\n\n220\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.308\nSo it's like, wait no,\nstop looking here, go look over here.\n\n221\n00:12:04.308 --> 00:12:07.980\nSo you could go ahead and\nchange the source from this dialog box or\n\n222\n00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.200\nyou could just break the link.\n\n223\n00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.220\nYou don't wanna have that\nconnection to that file anymore.\n\n224\n00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.106\nIf you do break a link, you will be\ninserting it into your PowerPoint\n\n225\n00:12:17.106 --> 00:12:20.809\npresentation as an image\nfrom that point forward.\n\n226\n00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:25.138\nAnd the last thing I wanted to point out\nis that these are set to automatically\n\n227\n00:12:25.138 --> 00:12:25.688\nupdate.\n\n228\n00:12:25.688 --> 00:12:27.978\nYou could see if I scrolled over,\nit says Automatic.\n\n229\n00:12:27.978 --> 00:12:32.653\nAnd that's why that Word file\nupdated automatically, that linked\n\n230\n00:12:32.653 --> 00:12:38.090\nWord content in my slide updated\nright away, because I have this set.\n\n231\n00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.200\nYou could set this to uncheck.\n\n232\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.690\nYou could uncheck this from\nnot doing it automatically.\n\n233\n00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.570\nAnd you can manually update it, and\nit could give you a little bit more\n\n234\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.590\ncontrol because maybe you don't want\nto have all the recent numbers for\n\n235\n00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.890\na specific presentation because\nit's the wrong audience.\n\n236\n00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.200\nSo there's different ways that\nyou can control your links.\n\n237\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.156\n&gt;&gt; I like that option too.\n\n238\n00:12:57.156 --> 00:13:00.195\nSometimes if I link to content\nthat's on network drives\n\n239\n00:13:00.195 --> 00:13:03.956\nthat aren't always available,\nI try to open up that presentation.\n\n240\n00:13:03.956 --> 00:13:06.972\nAnd it gives me all these warnings about,\nhey, your link is broken,\n\n241\n00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:08.380\nwhere is this content?\n\n242\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.405\nI'm like no, no, no,\nI'm okay using the old content.\n\n243\n00:13:11.405 --> 00:13:13.470\nIt'll update tomorrow when I\nget back to work and connect.\n\n244\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.070\nSo I like leaving that\non manual sometimes.\n\n245\n00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.820\n&gt;&gt; That's a fantastic example,\nso good, thank you.\n\n246\n00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.797\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so why don't we go ahead and\n\n247\n00:13:22.797 --> 00:13:26.684\njump into my next slide within\nthe presentation is, well,\n\n248\n00:13:26.684 --> 00:13:29.346\nhow is this different than a hyperlink?\n\n249\n00:13:29.346 --> 00:13:31.948\nCuz we're talking about linking,\nand here's a link, here's a link.\n\n250\n00:13:31.948 --> 00:13:35.953\nSo I just wanted to throw this slide in\nhere to let you know that they are two\n\n251\n00:13:35.953 --> 00:13:37.736\ndifferent things, in a sense.\n\n252\n00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:40.017\nWhen you're creating a hyperlink,\n\n253\n00:13:40.017 --> 00:13:44.296\nyou are creating something that is\na trigger to open something else.\n\n254\n00:13:44.296 --> 00:13:51.344\nFor example, you can link to a file or\nwebpage, or another slide.\n\n255\n00:13:51.344 --> 00:13:54.601\nCuz it is really a way of adding\nexternal content, if you wanna say it.\n\n256\n00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:57.277\nBut it doesn't live in the presentation.\n\n257\n00:13:57.277 --> 00:13:58.988\nIt lives outside.\n\n258\n00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:01.538\nWhich I guess,\nall of this information lives outside.\n\n259\n00:14:01.538 --> 00:14:03.602\n[LAUGH] But it's just a different fashion.\n\n260\n00:14:03.602 --> 00:14:07.480\nI'm not actually seeing\nthe content on the slide.\n\n261\n00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.070\nIt's either a word or an image that I\nwould click to open the Word file, or\n\n262\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.800\nopen a webpage from within my\nslideshow that I'm demonstrating.\n\n263\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.596\nBut of course, you would have to have\naccess to any of those files at that\n\n264\n00:14:20.596 --> 00:14:23.208\nparticular time when\nyou're running the show.\n\n265\n00:14:23.208 --> 00:14:27.184\nBut just keep that in mind because\nwhen we talk about adding links,\n\n266\n00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:31.799\nthat we do need to talk about packaging\nour presentation at the very end to make\n\n267\n00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:35.641\nsure that when I bring this to my\ntrip that I'm going to Chicago.\n\n268\n00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:38.167\nAnd I'm not bringing my laptop,\nbut I'm just traveling along.\n\n269\n00:14:38.167 --> 00:14:41.563\nI wanna make sure I all of\nthe external information,\n\n270\n00:14:41.563 --> 00:14:44.740\nexternal files that I need\nall ready to go for me.\n\n271\n00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.660\nSo we will review how to package for CD if\nyou do not already know how to do that.\n\n272\n00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.129\nAnd how to add a hyperlink and\nyou can right-click.\n\n273\n00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:57.425\nIf you select any of your text,\nyou can right-click and\n\n274\n00:14:57.425 --> 00:15:01.810\nyou can go to hyperlink or you can go\nto the insert tab and go to hyperlink.\n\n275\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.154\nAnd then you can see you can\nlink to an existing file or\n\n276\n00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.118\nactual places document\nwould link to a slide,\n\n277\n00:15:08.118 --> 00:15:12.769\nwhich we do cover in our custom shows\nepisode if you wanna check that out.\n\n278\n00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:16.299\nAnd you could either pick a file\nthat's on your computer or\n\n279\n00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:20.850\nyou could copy a web URL that you would\ngo out to your browser, copy the URL.\n\n280\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.530\nAnd put it into your presentation and\nto be able to just put that in there.\n\n281\n00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.850\nSo, wanted to at least\nthrow in hyperlink there.\n\n282\n00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.240\nSo how am I going to get some content?\n\n283\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.765\nWe said that there was the two ways, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and demonstrate this.\n\n284\n00:15:33.765 --> 00:15:36.915\nI do have some files in here.\n\n285\n00:15:36.915 --> 00:15:43.608\nAnd I gave myself a note as to, okay,\nExcel data to PowerPoint object.\n\n286\n00:15:43.608 --> 00:15:45.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So let's open this one up.\n\n287\n00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:50.413\nSo you can see that in this file, I\nalready have some information that I would\n\n288\n00:15:50.413 --> 00:15:53.621\nlike to include in this\nPowerPoint presentation.\n\n289\n00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:57.013\nThis is a range of cells that\nis formatted as a table.\n\n290\n00:15:57.013 --> 00:15:59.285\nDo they have to be formatted as a table?\n\n291\n00:15:59.285 --> 00:16:01.288\nNo, they could just be regular cells.\n\n292\n00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:04.280\nI'm just obsessed with tables\ncuz I love them in Excel.\n\n293\n00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.560\nSo I format everything as tables [LAUGH].\n\n294\n00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.040\nThey're just quick and\neasy and it's fantastic.\n\n295\n00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.095\nSo I want to take all of these,\nbecause we have our first lesson titles\n\n296\n00:16:13.095 --> 00:16:17.820\nof all the people in my house,\nnot really, but me and some cats.\n\n297\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.020\nAlways gotta have the cats.\n\n298\n00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.030\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and copy this\ncontent and now I have this copied area.\n\n299\n00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.740\nI'm gonna come over to PowerPoint and\nnow I'm going to Paste Special.\n\n300\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.440\nI showed you before that we go to the\nPaste drop down and choose Paste Special.\n\n301\n00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.080\nAnd here's where you need to determine,\ndo you want it as a link or\n\n302\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.620\ndo you want it embedded?\n\n303\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.270\nIf you used the first option,\n\n304\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.700\nyou are going to be embedding\nthis as an Excel workbook object.\n\n305\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.110\nBut that's where it doesn't\nhave the link to the file.\n\n306\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.230\nIf you paste the link,\nit shows it's still showing\n\n307\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.690\nan Excel worksheet object because it\ndoes understand that this is Excel.\n\n308\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.210\nIf you had been copying this from Word,\nit would show as a Word document object.\n\n309\n00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.420\nSo it does understand\nwhere it's coming from.\n\n310\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.522\nLet's do both.\n\n311\n00:17:00.522 --> 00:17:04.300\nLet's do the first one through the paste,\nclick OK.\n\n312\n00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.601\nAnd here is my embedded content.\n\n313\n00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:10.310\nIt's already remembering\nthat I copied this.\n\n314\n00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:16.835\nSo I'm going to then go back over and do\nPaste Special, paste the link, click OK.\n\n315\n00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:19.870\nAnd visually, go ahead,\nthis looks the exact same.\n\n316\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.200\nSo it looks everything the same.\n\n317\n00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:28.100\nBut it really depends on if I\nhad change my source document,\n\n318\n00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.270\nthe one on the right will change and\nthe one on the left will not.\n\n319\n00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:36.160\nBecause of the way that I determined how\nI wanted to bring it into PowerPoint.\n\n320\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.230\n&gt;&gt; They looked identical.\n\n321\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.260\nI mean how are we supposed\nto tell them apart?\n\n322\n00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well that's where if we did\nthe double-clicking, we can find out.\n\n323\n00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.790\nBut before we go through\nthe whole demonstration of, well,\n\n324\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.500\nwhat if I have PowerPoint already closed?\n\n325\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.950\nAnd I'm going in and updating my files.\n\n326\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.710\nAnd we can really just see the difference.\n\n327\n00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.830\nI wanted to just show you\nthat other way that you can\n\n328\n00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.770\nget linked content into your slide\npresentation, or embedded content.\n\n329\n00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:02.400\nAnd that is doing the inserting\nobject from file.\n\n330\n00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.930\nNow I'm using a file called\nchapter.docx and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n331\n00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.890\njust open the file for you really quickly.\n\n332\n00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.220\nSo you can see it before I put it in.\n\n333\n00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.860\nThat it is just I'd already\ndone some updates to this one.\n\n334\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.565\nSo why don't I go ahead and\ntake that out first [LAUGH].\n\n335\n00:18:14.565 --> 00:18:16.349\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here we go, so\n\n336\n00:18:16.349 --> 00:18:19.670\nyou can see that it's just a single page.\n\n337\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.580\nAnd it doesn't have anything else\nin their slides, the chapters.\n\n338\n00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.920\nAnd I'm going to save my changes to this.\n\n339\n00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.030\nYou can see I was already doing some\npracticing before this episode and\n\n340\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.630\nforgot to change my file\nback to the way I started.\n\n341\n00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.580\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nclose this and I will close this for now.\n\n342\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.320\nI'm going to go into my\nPowerPoint presentation.\n\n343\n00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.832\nI'm going to go to Insert, we're gonna\ngo to object, which is my little button.\n\n344\n00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:49.300\nAnd do I want to create from file?\n\n345\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.115\nYes, I do,\nI want to grab that chapters.docx file.\n\n346\n00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:56.260\nSo I choose that option, I choose browse.\n\n347\n00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.500\nI'm going to go into my desktop\ninto my PowerPoint Advanced and\n\n348\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.319\ngo into the chapters.\n\n349\n00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:08.300\nThis is where I can choose whether it\nis a linked file or it's an embedded.\n\n350\n00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.650\nIf you do not check that box,\nit's automatically going to be embedded.\n\n351\n00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.600\nSo if you're just like, go go go,\nthinking you're making a link,\n\n352\n00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.870\nyou gotta make sure\nthe checkbox is checked on.\n\n353\n00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:23.860\nSo I click OK, and\nnow I have my linked document,\n\n354\n00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.860\nit's showing exactly what the physical\narea of what's in that file.\n\n355\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.880\nSo it's only going to show\nme that one little section.\n\n356\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.670\nIt's not gonna show the whole page,\ncuz it doesn't see anything beyond that.\n\n357\n00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:40.350\nAnd just to get our contrasting,\nwe're going to do the same thing.\n\n358\n00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.340\nWe're going to browse out to our\nnot to the documents folder.\n\n359\n00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.580\nWe're going to go into the PowerPoint\nAdvanced and go into chapters here.\n\n360\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:53.925\nWe are not going to check on link and\nthen we have our embedded\n\n361\n00:19:53.925 --> 00:19:57.730\ncontent right there.\n\n362\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:03.812\nNow, just wanted to point out last slide,\nslide nine, this is already created,\n\n363\n00:20:03.812 --> 00:20:08.322\nis that I had actually pasted\na linked Excel chart from here.\n\n364\n00:20:08.322 --> 00:20:13.136\nAnd this is a chart that is hinged on\ncells that are in my Excel file, so\n\n365\n00:20:13.136 --> 00:20:18.046\nthe cool thing is, if I change the data\nof where this chart comes from.\n\n366\n00:20:18.046 --> 00:20:20.140\nAnd then it's gonna change the chart,\nwhich is gonna change the PowerPoint.\n\n367\n00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:25.100\nSo it's almost like a couple hops, and\nplus the fact if it's already built\n\n368\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.670\nin Excel as a chart, I don't have\nto make a chart in PowerPoint.\n\n369\n00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.130\nAnd then it just all comes together.\n\n370\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.980\nSo, I am going to do a file\nsave as on this, just so\n\n371\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.420\nI don't change any of my\ninformation from my original file.\n\n372\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.230\nAnd I'll just say done,\nthat sounds descriptive.\n\n373\n00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.150\nAnd I'm going to close out of PowerPoint.\n\n374\n00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.420\nI'm gonna close all my files and say okay,\nso I've made all of those links to files.\n\n375\n00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:52.076\nSo I'm gonna come along, maybe let's just\nsay the next day, a couple days from now.\n\n376\n00:20:52.076 --> 00:20:55.508\nI'm gonna come into that Excel file and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n377\n00:20:55.508 --> 00:20:57.298\nchange some of my information.\n\n378\n00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:02.380\nBecause Pumpkin Pants, that's what we\nuse to call him, Mr. Pumpkin Pants,\n\n379\n00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.160\nhe is a squash but we actually we called\nhim winter squash, he was orange.\n\n380\n00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.610\nSo he is winter squash and Fuego,\n\n381\n00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:18.420\nhe is a big buffalo and that's his\nother nickname that we have for him.\n\n382\n00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.746\nAnd maybe I'll go ahead and\nadd another row in here and\n\n383\n00:21:22.746 --> 00:21:25.822\nwe're going to go ahead and say Puma,\n\n384\n00:21:25.822 --> 00:21:30.649\nshe was the princess and she was,\nwell, she was the queen.\n\n385\n00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:32.089\nWe called her queen.\n\n386\n00:21:32.089 --> 00:21:33.484\nShe was the ruling figure.\n\n387\n00:21:33.484 --> 00:21:34.268\n&gt;&gt; Royal family, yes.\n\n388\n00:21:34.268 --> 00:21:35.551\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n389\n00:21:35.551 --> 00:21:39.160\nSo I'm going to save\nthe changes to this Excel file.\n\n390\n00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.169\nI'm going to go into chapters and\nI'm going to change this,\n\n391\n00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:48.406\nand I'm gonna add a bunch\nmore information [LAUGH].\n\n392\n00:21:48.406 --> 00:21:53.445\nTo show that, since I inserted this in\nmy PowerPoint presentation as an object,\n\n393\n00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:57.025\nanything that's in here\nis going to be reflected.\n\n394\n00:21:57.025 --> 00:22:00.505\nBut that added row that I added in Excel,\n\n395\n00:22:00.505 --> 00:22:03.285\nthat's not going to show in\nmy PowerPoint presentation.\n\n396\n00:22:03.285 --> 00:22:06.525\nBecause I told it to\nonly show these cells.\n\n397\n00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:11.616\nSo you can see the good and the bad,\nthe differences of how you can use\n\n398\n00:22:11.616 --> 00:22:16.459\nthese different techniques of\ninserting and linking content.\n\n399\n00:22:16.459 --> 00:22:19.360\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nchange all of that.\n\n400\n00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.410\nCome back and open up my PowerPoint\npresentation that is the link and\n\n401\n00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.240\nembed done.\n\n402\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.490\nIt is giving me my warning that\nI have linked information,\n\n403\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:33.230\nit's going to take a minute to go\nahead and find all of my files.\n\n404\n00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.450\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nlet it do its thinking.\n\n405\n00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.740\nBut we will be able to go to that\nslide that has the chapters and\n\n406\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.460\nyou're gonna see all that gobbledygook\nthat I added in the chapter.\n\n407\n00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.839\nAnd then you're going to see\nthat princess was not added.\n\n408\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.530\nAnd that is in slide seven.\n\n409\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:56.140\nYou can see that I do have\nBig Buffalo is Fuego's new title and\n\n410\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.030\nWinter Squash is Pumpkin's new title.\n\n411\n00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.890\nBut you do not see\nPuma Princess because that is\n\n412\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:06.170\nnot within the range that I specified\nas this particular linked object.\n\n413\n00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.159\n&gt;&gt; Refresh our memory now,\n\n414\n00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:10.040\nthe one you're looking at there on\nthe right that is the linked content.\n\n415\n00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.575\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n416\n00:23:10.575 --> 00:23:11.181\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n417\n00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:13.391\n&gt;&gt; And the other one?\n&gt;&gt; The one on the left is the embedded,\n\n418\n00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:17.310\nwhich did not update when we\nchanged the external document.\n\n419\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n420\n00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:18.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n421\n00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.840\nAnd the other [INAUDIBLE] as I know that\nif I double-click, I double click it is\n\n422\n00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:28.550\ngoing into the actual file that\nis in separate application.\n\n423\n00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.345\nAnd if I double-click on this one,\nit does this weird kind of shifty thing.\n\n424\n00:23:32.345 --> 00:23:35.310\n[LAUGH] That's what I always,\nit just kind of freaks out and\n\n425\n00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.435\nthen it always threw me off when I was,\nI don't know where I'm at.\n\n426\n00:23:39.435 --> 00:23:41.850\n&gt;&gt; Looks like the computer was\ngetting ready to crash for a second.\n\n427\n00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:45.030\n&gt;&gt; And that's where I would always\ntry to go to that close button, but\n\n428\n00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:48.850\nI'm actually closing out\nthe PowerPoint presentation.\n\n429\n00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.419\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you never left PowerPoint,\n\n430\n00:23:50.419 --> 00:23:54.149\nyou were opening up a little mini version\nof Excel within PowerPoint there.\n\n431\n00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:58.802\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so I'm gonna hit the Esc key,\nso that will take me out of it.\n\n432\n00:23:58.802 --> 00:24:01.314\nBut I could have gone into and\nupdated it from there.\n\n433\n00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:04.406\nIt's just different reasons,\ndifferent strokes for\n\n434\n00:24:04.406 --> 00:24:07.710\ndifferent folks of why you want\nto do what you wanted to do.\n\n435\n00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:08.860\nAnd then the chapters,\n\n436\n00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:14.179\nyou can see that the linked file here\nis going to show all of the content.\n\n437\n00:24:14.179 --> 00:24:16.914\nAnd then it's going to,\nwell, I don't want that,\n\n438\n00:24:16.914 --> 00:24:20.643\nso there is different reasons why you\nwant to select versus insert and so\n\n439\n00:24:20.643 --> 00:24:23.647\nthese are some of the demonstrations\nthat you want to do.\n\n440\n00:24:23.647 --> 00:24:24.894\n&gt;&gt; All right, Yvonne, great stuff.\n\n441\n00:24:24.894 --> 00:24:29.350\nI know you headed something about that\nchart, what's going on with that thing?\n\n442\n00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.239\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthe triple hop as I was calling it.\n\n443\n00:24:31.239 --> 00:24:34.322\n[LAUGH] Yes,\nour last slide here is a copied and\n\n444\n00:24:34.322 --> 00:24:39.775\nlinked chart from Excel that is coming\nfrom a range of cells that I talked about.\n\n445\n00:24:39.775 --> 00:24:44.002\nSo let's see what that will do, I'm going\nto save my changes in this file, and\n\n446\n00:24:44.002 --> 00:24:45.660\nI'm going to close it.\n\n447\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:51.620\nI'm going to come into the chart data for\nPowerPoint file.\n\n448\n00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.655\nIf I can double click it, right?\n\n449\n00:24:52.655 --> 00:24:54.420\n[LAUGH] And it's going to open.\n\n450\n00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.930\nSo this is the content that's linked\nin my PowerPoint presentation.\n\n451\n00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.949\nBut it's coming from the cells in Excel.\n\n452\n00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:07.867\nSo if I went ahead and changed it to,\nlet's say, he slept for\n\n453\n00:25:07.867 --> 00:25:13.102\n500 hours and Bishop meowed for\n300 in a month.\n\n454\n00:25:13.102 --> 00:25:14.925\nI don't know where we're\ngoing now anymore.\n\n455\n00:25:14.925 --> 00:25:19.236\nBut just to get a big visual\nchange of that I changed\n\n456\n00:25:19.236 --> 00:25:22.224\nthe data connected to this chart.\n\n457\n00:25:22.224 --> 00:25:24.828\nI'm going to save the changes,\n\n458\n00:25:24.828 --> 00:25:29.755\nclose here, and if I open up our file,\nit will take a minute.\n\n459\n00:25:29.755 --> 00:25:31.696\nI just realized I probably\nshouldn't have closed the file,\n\n460\n00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.951\nbecause that's gonna take a second\nto go ahead and open itself again.\n\n461\n00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:35.808\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna annotate all those links.\n\n462\n00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:40.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But it will show that\nthe chart is going to be reflecting\n\n463\n00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.310\nthe changes because it\nis a linked document.\n\n464\n00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:47.030\nBut always remember that if\nit's not actually showing that,\n\n465\n00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.370\nlike I know this is linked,\nI know this is linked.\n\n466\n00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:54.030\nRemember when I was going back to that\nlinks dialog box from our info and\n\n467\n00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.158\nforcing the updates.\n\n468\n00:25:55.158 --> 00:25:58.222\nSometimes I've had to do that\neven if it's set automatically,\n\n469\n00:25:58.222 --> 00:26:02.306\nit's sometimes doesn't catch itself but I\nfound that if I go to that links document,\n\n470\n00:26:02.306 --> 00:26:05.338\nor that links dialogue box,\nit will go ahead and force itself.\n\n471\n00:26:05.338 --> 00:26:08.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and if somebody\nrenames that file you're linked to or\n\n472\n00:26:08.246 --> 00:26:11.345\nmoves that file, or anything like that,\nyou can throw it off, right?\n\n473\n00:26:11.345 --> 00:26:12.514\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yes, so yeah,\n\n474\n00:26:12.514 --> 00:26:15.478\nthat link style box is definitely\nthe place to know where to go.\n\n475\n00:26:15.478 --> 00:26:18.162\nSo if you can see there in slide nine,\nthat yep,\n\n476\n00:26:18.162 --> 00:26:21.605\nall of my changes have been\nreflected from this linked file.\n\n477\n00:26:21.605 --> 00:26:24.420\nAnd that could be really, really handy.\n\n478\n00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.460\nOne last thing since I was talking about\nthat links dialog box and where I can go.\n\n479\n00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:33.380\nMaybe I don't want a connection\nto this particular chart anymore.\n\n480\n00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.770\nOr I don't want it connected\nto the Alice text document.\n\n481\n00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.530\nI don't want the breaking of the link.\n\n482\n00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwhat if I wanna freeze that chart in time,\n\n483\n00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:44.000\nI don't want it to change even\nif the source data changes.\n\n484\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.088\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so if you go back over to file\nand we're already in the info section.\n\n485\n00:26:49.088 --> 00:26:53.261\nYou can see that the edit\nlinks to files box, or\n\n486\n00:26:53.261 --> 00:26:57.017\nthe command takes me to the dialogue box.\n\n487\n00:26:57.017 --> 00:26:59.604\nNow the thing is,\nyou have to remember what files are there,\n\n488\n00:26:59.604 --> 00:27:01.190\nbecause I do have quite a few things.\n\n489\n00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.426\nAnd just to give a quick explanation.\n\n490\n00:27:02.426 --> 00:27:06.401\nDo you see how this is showing that,\nthat was the insert file,\n\n491\n00:27:06.401 --> 00:27:11.217\nbecause it's showing the whole\nchapters.docx as opposed to right here,\n\n492\n00:27:11.217 --> 00:27:15.129\nin the Alice text document,\nit was only a specific section.\n\n493\n00:27:15.129 --> 00:27:19.967\nThat OLE, stands for\nobject linking and embedding.\n\n494\n00:27:19.967 --> 00:27:26.581\nIt's just a term that they use in\nMicrosoft in any of the applications.\n\n495\n00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:30.812\nAnd then you can see the Excel file\nright there, showing that row one,\n\n496\n00:27:30.812 --> 00:27:34.916\ncolumn one, to row five column C,\nit does not use cell references.\n\n497\n00:27:34.916 --> 00:27:37.290\nIt's actually just using those rows and\ncolumns.\n\n498\n00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.040\nSo that's why it's remembering that.\n\n499\n00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.740\nSo if I don't want that chart,\nI know that that's the file that\n\n500\n00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.600\nthat chart information is\ncoming from on slide nine, so\n\n501\n00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.940\nI can take this and I can break the link.\n\n502\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.000\nAnd now, there's no connection\nto that source document.\n\n503\n00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.750\nAnd if I come back over\nhere to slide nine,\n\n504\n00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:58.520\nyou see it's still there, it's not\ngoing away, but now this is an image.\n\n505\n00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.500\nNow, I can't go in and change each of the\ndata series like I had done in inserting\n\n506\n00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.230\ncharts in another episode.\n\n507\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.080\nThis is just a picture now.\n\n508\n00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.334\nSo, anything that is broken\nbecomes that photograph and\n\n509\n00:28:10.334 --> 00:28:13.383\nif you needed to update the information or\nchange it,\n\n510\n00:28:13.383 --> 00:28:17.339\nyou would have to basically start\nover because it's just a picture.\n\n511\n00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:19.043\nIt's frozen in time just like you said.\n\n512\n00:28:19.043 --> 00:28:19.587\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n513\n00:28:19.587 --> 00:28:22.196\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Yvonne, great stuff,\n\n514\n00:28:22.196 --> 00:28:25.223\ngreat explanations,\ngreat demonstrations as always,\n\n515\n00:28:25.223 --> 00:28:29.197\nexplaining to us what the differences\nbetween linking and embedding, and\n\n516\n00:28:29.197 --> 00:28:33.075\nhow we can get that external data\ninto our PowerPoint presentations.\n\n517\n00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:34.135\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n518\n00:28:34.135 --> 00:28:36.154\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n519\n00:28:36.154 --> 00:28:39.106\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n520\n00:28:39.106 --> 00:28:39.930\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Yvonne Smith.\n\n521\n00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.794\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n522\n00:28:41.794 --> 00:28:47.749\n[MUSIC]\n\n523\n00:28:47.749 --> 00:28:50.919\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:15.841\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.880\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our advanced PowerPoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.961\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\nactually doing a part two For our link and\n\n8\n00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.750\nembed external content.\n\n9\n00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.750\nAnd back in the studios with us\nonce again is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.620\nWelcome back Vonne.\n\n11\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.120\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, good to be back.\n\n12\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.310\nBecause we need to finish our thought\n\n13\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.970\nfrom our first part of our linking and\nembedding.\n\n14\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.980\nBut I got so excited about\nshowing all of the examples, and\n\n15\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.800\nI talked about packaging for a CD and how\nimportant it is, but we ran out of time.\n\n16\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.890\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n&gt;&gt; And we didn't cover it.\n\n17\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.680\nSo that's why we're back\nbecause I wanna show you this.\n\n18\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.530\nIt is a very important step if you\nare going to be taking this PowerPoint and\n\n19\n00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.980\nputting it onto a different computer.\n\n20\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.040\nOr maybe I wanted to give it to you\nbecause maybe you're going be taking over.\n\n21\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.900\nPresenting this information\nto the board of directors or\n\n22\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.700\nto whatever the audience is for this\npresentation and I need to give it to you.\n\n23\n00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.160\n&gt;&gt; Or you can't take your laptop with you,\nyou're going to an auditorium.\n\n24\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.640\nThey've got a laptop set up and\nall you get's a thumb drive or something.\n\n25\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.033\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, so I need to make sure\nthat all of the files that I am using\n\n26\n00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:19.843\noutside of PowerPoint\nneed to come with me, so\n\n27\n00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:22.240\nwe need to make sure that we package it.\n\n28\n00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.974\nSo I have the file that we had completed\nin that last episode here, and I called it\n\n29\n00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:31.580\nLink and Embed done, and we have all of\nthe different content that is linked.\n\n30\n00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.180\nNow, right now,\nall of these files that are on my computer\n\n31\n00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.730\nare saying go to the path.\n\n32\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.780\nThe link is saying go to Vonne's desktop,\nand go into the power point advance.\n\n33\n00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.810\nHere, let me actually show you,\nto remind ourselves where we were at.\n\n34\n00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.250\nWe went into the edit links,\nand found the links dialog box.\n\n35\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.650\nYou can see that these are the paths\nto those different items.\n\n36\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.360\nThere's my Excel file,\nthere's my word file.\n\n37\n00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.737\nAnd if I send this to Mike it's\ngonna remember those paths and\n\n38\n00:01:59.737 --> 00:02:03.920\nI actually have this brought up in\nanother computer so we can see that.\n\n39\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.695\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because if you bring it over\nto my computer it's gonna look for\n\n40\n00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:10.785\nC:Users/Vonne and\nthere is no C:Users/Vonne on my laptop,\n\n41\n00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:11.963\nso it's gonna break those links.\n\n42\n00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:16.165\n&gt;&gt; Yeah for example, if we imagine\nthis will switch over to Joey,\n\n43\n00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:18.855\nnow I've changed my personality and\nI'm Joey.\n\n44\n00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:23.172\nAnd so, Joey has received\nthis file from Justin, and\n\n45\n00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:25.332\nwhen he opens it, it's going to say this.\n\n46\n00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:28.062\nIt's like, I I'm sorry I can't find\n\n47\n00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:31.422\nthe linked files that are designated\nin this presentation.\n\n48\n00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:33.322\nI don't know where they're at.\n\n49\n00:02:33.322 --> 00:02:37.962\nSo it's given me Joey a warning to saying\nright off the bat like I don't know where\n\n50\n00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:38.792\nit's going.\n\n51\n00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:42.730\nNow it doesn't mean that it's not\ngoing to show up in your presentation.\n\n52\n00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.427\nSo, see, it shows and I can see\nthe charts and all the information, but\n\n53\n00:02:47.427 --> 00:02:52.358\nremember, if we wanted to edit a linked\nitem, you would double click it and\n\n54\n00:02:52.358 --> 00:02:54.890\nit would open up in that application.\n\n55\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.590\nIt's like, I don't know where it's at,\nI can't find it.\n\n56\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.233\nAnd so if I go into the links dialogue\nbox for Joey's computer it is,\n\n57\n00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:07.450\njust like we were saying, it is\nremembering that path to Vonne's desktop,\n\n58\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.120\nto the PowerPoint folder and\nit doesn't remember.\n\n59\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.860\nWell it still sees it as I saved it,\nbut doesn't know where all that exists.\n\n60\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.710\nSo it's important to make sure that\nwe bring that over with the file.\n\n61\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.610\n&gt;&gt; So I guess that's something\nwe should probably mention then.\n\n62\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.243\nIf you didn't care that the data was\never updated again or if they changed\n\n63\n00:03:27.243 --> 00:03:30.890\nthe source that your presentation\nwas updated, it would be ok, right?\n\n64\n00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.750\nThe presentation would\nstill play like normal?\n\n65\n00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, cuz the content's there.\n\n66\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.380\nIt's just the link to it.\n\n67\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.019\nSo that like he's saying, if it's not\nsomething that is important to you,\n\n68\n00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.260\nthen that's okay.\n\n69\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.659\nAnd really what you probably should do is\nbreak the links before you would send it\n\n70\n00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.219\nto your other person that\nyou want to share, or\n\n71\n00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.436\nif you're taking it on the road with you,\njust go ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:53.436 --> 00:03:57.800\nbreak that link make it an image, and\nthen you don't have to worry about this.\n\n73\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.690\nThat is something to always consider\nof making sure, when you're\n\n74\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.440\ndelivering your presentation, that you're\nnot going to be running into any issues.\n\n75\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.480\nYou want to have it work\nas flawlessly as possible,\n\n76\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.290\nto make sure that I'm gonna stand up here,\nbecause you're probably gonna be nervous,\n\n77\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.340\nand you're probably\ngonna forget your lines.\n\n78\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.824\nAnd you gotta make sure that your\nPowerPoint presentation, you don't get\n\n79\n00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:21.966\ntongue tied like that, is going to\nrun just the way you told it to run.\n\n80\n00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:23.659\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't have any idea but\n\n81\n00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:24.557\nthat's like, right?\n\n82\n00:04:24.557 --> 00:04:25.411\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n83\n00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:26.510\n[LAUGH].\n\n84\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.757\nWe haven't had a redo this\npart a couple times, have we?\n\n85\n00:04:28.757 --> 00:04:30.055\nNo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n86\n00:04:30.055 --> 00:04:30.564\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n87\n00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:31.474\n&gt;&gt; So we're just gonna\n\n88\n00:04:31.474 --> 00:04:35.200\nkeep on rolling on this take and just keep\non going, but yes know where you're at and\n\n89\n00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.050\nmake sure that everything is prepared for\nyou to be able to run properly.\n\n90\n00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.825\nSo, but,\n\n91\n00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:45.439\nif I needed to give you the files maybe\nI don't remember where all of them are.\n\n92\n00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.950\nLike I know I put a bunch\nof linked files in it.\n\n93\n00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.730\nIf you do that package for a CD even\nthough we are not really using a CD.\n\n94\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.990\nI mean, who uses CDs anymore?\n\n95\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.710\nWe're really just gonna\ncopy it into a folder.\n\n96\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.500\nAnd then PowerPoint is gonna magically\nbring everything together, and\n\n97\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.110\nput it in a nice little package for\nus to then take the whole folder.\n\n98\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.461\nAnd move it over to wherever I'm going,\nto a thumb drive, or\n\n99\n00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:11.770\nI email you the zipped folder and\nthen we move on from there.\n\n100\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.667\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n101\n00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so how do I do that?\n\n102\n00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.247\nIf we come into here, we can go to\nfile and we can go to export and\n\n103\n00:05:18.247 --> 00:05:20.042\nwe can go to package for CD.\n\n104\n00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:23.300\nAnd it's telling me that it\nwill include any files or\n\n105\n00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.270\nitems that are linked\ninto this presentation.\n\n106\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.670\nI package for a CD and I'm gonna name\nthis, let's go ahead and Linked Package.\n\n107\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.432\nProbably figure out whatever name you'd\nlike to do for your presentation.\n\n108\n00:05:38.432 --> 00:05:41.320\nIt's gonna make sense,\nthat's making sense to me right now.\n\n109\n00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.330\nWe'll go ahead and copy to a folder\ncuz we don't wanna actually have a CD.\n\n110\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.590\nI don't even have a CD drive.\n\n111\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.624\nI have all these wonderful new ports\nthat I have to have lot's of tumbles.\n\n112\n00:05:49.624 --> 00:05:50.803\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:05:50.803 --> 00:05:52.109\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n114\n00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:55.544\nbrowse to my computer and\nI'm gonna put this on my desktop so\n\n115\n00:05:55.544 --> 00:05:58.429\nI know where to find it and\nI'm going to click OK and\n\n116\n00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:02.759\nit's just given me a warning like make\nsure you are including files that you\n\n117\n00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:07.480\ntrust and it is going to do this or are\nyou sure you want to include your files?\n\n118\n00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.900\nYes I do, I click OK.\n\n119\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.164\nYou can actually see there that\nit's copying over all of those\n\n120\n00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:17.060\nfiles into that package\nfolder that I designated.\n\n121\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.192\nAnd then it's going to open because I have\nthat checkbox selected at the bottom to\n\n122\n00:06:21.192 --> 00:06:22.600\nopen when it's finished.\n\n123\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.080\nAnd here is the folder that I named,\nLinked package that has all of\n\n124\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.380\nthe different Excel files and the Word\nfiles and everything's ready to go.\n\n125\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.353\nAnd this is what I will now send off\nto whoever I need it to be sent to,\n\n126\n00:06:38.353 --> 00:06:40.930\nand it could even be myself.\n\n127\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.890\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that,\njust so we can complete that.\n\n128\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.149\nI have my shared folder across\nmy multiple virtual machines\n\n129\n00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:54.705\nthat I'm going to use after\nit recognizes itself.\n\n130\n00:06:54.705 --> 00:06:57.169\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And let's go ahead and\n\n131\n00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.980\nput where'd it go?\n\n132\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.953\nThere you are.\n\n133\n00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:04.630\nWe're gonna move that on over and\nthere's the whole folder.\n\n134\n00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.270\nWe're gonna switch personalities again.\n\n135\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.040\nWe're gonna come over here to Joey.\n\n136\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.170\nWe're gonna close out of that other file\nthat I was using for demonstrations.\n\n137\n00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.670\nWe don't need to save the changes to this.\n\n138\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.967\nI'll go ahead and open up my folder and\nit's going spin for\n\n139\n00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:23.330\njust a minute cuz it has to think.\n\n140\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.400\nThere we go and\nI'm going to take this folder and\n\n141\n00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.560\nI'm going to copy it over to\nmy desktop and there we go.\n\n142\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.820\nSo now, Joey has the packaged file so\neverything should work out beautifully.\n\n143\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.820\nSo let's go ahead and get that opened.\n\n144\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.770\nWe'll open up the Link and Embed file.\n\n145\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.330\nIt'll always say that, hey,\nyou've got some links in there.\n\n146\n00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.900\nSo this is that common\nwarning box that we had any\n\n147\n00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.420\ntime that you have linked information so\nI update the links.\n\n148\n00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.770\nIt is gonna take a second.\n\n149\n00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.120\nBefore, I had it already opened\nbecause I didn't want to\n\n150\n00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.500\nuse the time to have it just sit here.\n\n151\n00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.619\nSo we can talk.\n\n152\n00:07:57.619 --> 00:07:58.977\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a good sign,\n\n153\n00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:01.535\nwhen you see those messages\nsays hey you've got links,\n\n154\n00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:02.740\ndo you wanna update them?\n\n155\n00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.314\nInstead of the messages that says,\nhey there's links and\n\n156\n00:08:05.314 --> 00:08:07.173\nthey're broken what do you want me to do?\n\n157\n00:08:07.173 --> 00:08:09.223\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So it's already a good indicator\n\n158\n00:08:09.223 --> 00:08:12.279\nthat everything is working,\nit's finding the files and\n\n159\n00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.840\nsaying hey you wanna\nupdate this information?\n\n160\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.350\n&gt;&gt; And then you see this.\n\n161\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.852\nAnd you're like, wait, what happened?\n\n162\n00:08:17.852 --> 00:08:20.679\n&gt;&gt; And then again, it might be lying.\n\n163\n00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:24.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I actually knew\nthat this was gonna happen, so\n\n164\n00:08:24.487 --> 00:08:28.884\nI'm turning it into a teachable moment for\nall of us, because linking or\n\n165\n00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:32.430\nthe packaging function,\nit usually works pretty great.\n\n166\n00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.470\nBut every now and again,\nthere can be a little bug in there.\n\n167\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:43.970\nAnd so this is a good moment to say, well,\nwhat happens if this happened to me, okay?\n\n168\n00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.120\nSo I'm going to show you.\n\n169\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.640\nI'm going to click OK.\n\n170\n00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.070\nAnd all the content is in there.\n\n171\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.560\nWe're gonna deliver to that\nlinks dialog box over here.\n\n172\n00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.270\nAnd you can see that it is showing all of\nthem, but look at this one right here.\n\n173\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.670\nThat was that copied Excel that range\nof Excel cells that we had said\n\n174\n00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:09.040\nthat we wanted to bring over in\nslide five, let's remind ourselves.\n\n175\n00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.942\nOkay, slide seven this one right here,\nfor some reason when we packaged it,\n\n176\n00:09:15.942 --> 00:09:19.271\nit didn't remember the name of the file,\nand\n\n177\n00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:24.200\nit didn't remember the first cell\nwithin the range that I copied.\n\n178\n00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.250\nSo it might not work all that great.\n\n179\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.130\nIf you have a copied\nrange of Excel files or\n\n180\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.870\nExcel cells and then it comes over and\nyour package worked great.\n\n181\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.346\nFantastic, but just in case it\nkinda slipped up a little bit,\n\n182\n00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:41.250\nthis is how you can fix it.\n\n183\n00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.994\nCuz if I hadn't have packaged this, I\nwouldn't have the source information, but\n\n184\n00:09:45.994 --> 00:09:48.290\nI do have the source files.\n\n185\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.680\nSo you find the link that's not\nworking out just right, and\n\n186\n00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.870\nyou can see that over here.\n\n187\n00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.700\nIt's unavailable cuz it doesn't\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n188\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.220\nI can change the source.\n\n189\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.550\nI have it, so why don't I go ahead and\npoint it to the right direction?\n\n190\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.830\nI just need to give it a little\nnudge back to where it needs to go.\n\n191\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.000\nSo I'm gonna say change Source, and\nwe are going to go onto our desktop and\n\n192\n00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.860\ngo into that packaged\nfolder that we had created.\n\n193\n00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.170\nAnd I know that this is the file\nthat we need we click Open.\n\n194\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:21.482\nAnd then, now it understands, okay,\nI have the link to the right file.\n\n195\n00:10:21.482 --> 00:10:25.635\nWe'll say, notice the range\nis not showing anymore, but\n\n196\n00:10:25.635 --> 00:10:28.530\nat least it knows to go to the right file.\n\n197\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:33.790\nSo if you close this, and I go back\nover to my side, it will go ahead and\n\n198\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.530\nopen, but It's now understanding that\nthis is connecting to the whole file.\n\n199\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.490\nSo, if you remember from, if you saw\nthe part one of this we had went back\n\n200\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.590\ninto the Excel file and we've added\nthat new line with our Puma Princess.\n\n201\n00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:53.370\nAnd so it's seeing that it doesn't\nremember that rings that I had designated.\n\n202\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.850\nBut I have the file so if I needed\nto I can always just go ahead and\n\n203\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.690\nrecreate this, I could just go ahead and\ndelete this open up the Excel file select\n\n204\n00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.710\nthe ranges of cells and then go ahead and\npaste special back to where it was.\n\n205\n00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:11.897\nSo you might need to do a few extra\nlittle steps but you have the file,\n\n206\n00:11:11.897 --> 00:11:15.630\nJoey has the file so\nhe can go ahead and redo this.\n\n207\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.095\nAnd this is maybe another indication of,\ndo I really need to have that linked if\n\n208\n00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:24.590\nI'm going to be travelling somewhere or\nbringing over at Joey?\n\n209\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.192\nIt's your call, so\n\n210\n00:11:26.192 --> 00:11:31.567\nif it doesn't work out exactly\nthe way you think it's supposed to or\n\n211\n00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:36.656\nit has a little blip on the radar,\nyou need to go back and fix it.\n\n212\n00:11:36.656 --> 00:11:38.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nat least they make it pretty easy for us.\n\n213\n00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.568\nWe go into our file backstage area,\nright, we can click on that,\n\n214\n00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:44.590\nif we can see the links, and\nit tells us which one is broken.\n\n215\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.130\nAnd because we packaged it,\nwe know we got the source data.\n\n216\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.250\nWe just gotta tell it again, hey no,\nI only want this range of cells and\n\n217\n00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.513\nit will pick it up and go from there\n&gt;&gt; Exactly\n\n218\n00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:56.050\n&gt;&gt; All right well fantastic Vonne and\n\n219\n00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.322\nthank you for coming back and\n\n220\n00:11:57.322 --> 00:12:00.980\nrounding out that information we've\nlearned a lot about linking and embedding.\n\n221\n00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.726\nIn that first episode now we learned how\nto package it up and get it ready for\n\n222\n00:12:04.726 --> 00:12:07.024\ntransport if I need to\nsend it to somebody, or\n\n223\n00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:09.820\ntake it with me to give my\npresentation out on the road.\n\n224\n00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.820\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n225\n00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.003\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; We hope everybody out\n\n226\n00:12:12.003 --> 00:12:13.520\nthere enjoyed watching this one.\n\n227\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.220\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host Mike Rodrick\n\n228\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.070\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\nit's already installed, so\n\n28\n00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.996\nwe missed that opportunity.\n\n29\n00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:33.465\nSo we're going to be doing that, and how\nare you going to be getting your audio and\n\n30\n00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:36.644\nvideo files,\nthere's a whole bunch of different ways.\n\n31\n00:01:36.644 --> 00:01:41.489\nBut there is something to make sure\nthat you are familiar with is that\n\n32\n00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:46.334\ndifferent audio and video files\nreally make a difference because if\n\n33\n00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:50.780\nyou don't have the right codec\nthen something could be a lie.\n\n34\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.470\nSo, what is a codec?\n\n35\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.270\nMike, what is a codec?\n\n36\n00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.040\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n37\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.810\nI'm glad you're here to tell us.\n\n38\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.395\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what it is.\n\n39\n00:01:57.395 --> 00:02:01.275\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna assume that it is what\nit's gonna decode or code our video or\n\n40\n00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:02.345\naudio stream, right?\n\n41\n00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:05.185\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is a program and\na device that is used for encoding and\n\n42\n00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:06.635\ndecoding a digital data stream.\n\n43\n00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:09.597\nYes, I wanted to read that to make\nsure that I got that correct as well.\n\n44\n00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:10.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.655\n&gt;&gt; But we use it so frequently it's just,\n\n46\n00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:16.764\nit's like the language almost\nof being able to have the files,\n\n47\n00:02:16.764 --> 00:02:21.790\nit speaks in a certain language and\nmaking sure that we understand that.\n\n48\n00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.800\nAnd so you gotta make sure that you have\nthat right codec or the right format for\n\n49\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.780\nit to play in whatever\ndevice that you have.\n\n50\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Right cuz if somebody had put\na video of a certain file type in their\n\n51\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.940\nPowerPoint, you try to play it but\n\n52\n00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.440\ndidn't have the codec that was used to\nencode that video in the first place,\n\n53\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.550\nyour system wouldn't be able to decode it,\nplay the video and\n\n54\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.440\nyou're just gonna get an error\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n55\n00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.080\nAnd that actually happens,\nan example would be like a I know my mom.\n\n56\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.121\nShe has both a windows in a Mac\ncomputer or maybe she's on Mac,\n\n57\n00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:53.513\nshe goes to a computer pretty quickly,\nhonestly.\n\n58\n00:02:53.513 --> 00:02:56.611\n[LAUGH] But somebody has sent her\na video file and she wanted to watch and\n\n59\n00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.117\nshe's like, I can't watch it.\n\n60\n00:02:58.117 --> 00:02:59.459\nIt won't let me.\n\n61\n00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.930\nI'm like, well, why not?\n\n62\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.630\nJust play it.\n\n63\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.731\nShe goes, yes, but it opens and\nit says that I can't find the MOV file or\n\n64\n00:03:07.731 --> 00:03:13.405\na WMV, and I'm like, wait,\nthis is where you have a difference\n\n65\n00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:19.300\nof it was creating or encoded or\nsaved as an MOV file,\n\n66\n00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.060\nThen your Windows machine won't be\nable to read it, or vice-versa.\n\n67\n00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.140\nIf it was created on a Windows machine\nwith that MWV, Windows Media Video?\n\n68\n00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.400\nYeah, and then she's trying to play it on\nher Mac and it just wasn't understanding.\n\n69\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.810\nIt was like, I don't speak this language,\n\n70\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.880\nand I don't have any program that will\nallow me to understand what you're saying.\n\n71\n00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.940\nThe world of audio and\nvideo files can have that issue sometimes.\n\n72\n00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.980\nAnd so just make sure you\nunderstand at least that there\n\n73\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.890\nare different file formats, and sometimes\nyou don't have the right thing to read it.\n\n74\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.850\nBut there are some free video encoders or\ntranslators if you want to call\n\n75\n00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.630\nthem that you can download and\nyou can take an MOV file and\n\n76\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.400\nchange it into an MP4 file or an MP3 or\nwhatever file you want it to be.\n\n77\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.995\nMOV is video, so it'd be MP4.\n\n78\n00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:13.746\nSo since I'm throwing out\nall these letters and\n\n79\n00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:16.631\nnumbers right here,\nI do have a list to go ahead and\n\n80\n00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:20.377\ngive you a little reference chart\nin our file of audio and video.\n\n81\n00:04:20.377 --> 00:04:23.660\nAnd it is coming directly\nfrom the Microsoft website.\n\n82\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.790\nSo I did include the link that\nyou can be able to click on and\n\n83\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.010\nbe able to read up a little\nbit more about this.\n\n84\n00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.210\nSo here are some common audio file formats\nsuch as the MP3, that's probably one that\n\n85\n00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.630\nmany of us are familiar with because\nof our iPods and our MP3 players.\n\n86\n00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.780\nIt plays that type of file and\nit's a very popular codec or\n\n87\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.420\ntranslation of audio\nfiles that people use.\n\n88\n00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.470\nBut there are other ones out there\nthat you might see or come across,\n\n89\n00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.240\nlike a wav, a wave file,\nI've seen that quite frequently.\n\n90\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.340\nOr you have the m4a, that's something\nthat you really see with Apple products.\n\n91\n00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.730\nSo if you have music from your Phone, it\nwill come down as that a lot of times so.\n\n92\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.276\nAnd then there's some video file\nformats here, you can see the MP4,\n\n93\n00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:15.069\nanother popular one M4V.\n\n94\n00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.190\nAnd you also have the MOV.\n\n95\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.120\nMOV is more of an Apple\nbase file format and\n\n96\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.430\nthe WMV is going to be more of\na Windows media file as well.\n\n97\n00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.970\nThere is some flash there\nin with the Swift files,\n\n98\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.910\nthe SWF files that you might still see.\n\n99\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.456\nThat file format and flash all together\nis kind of reduced, we'll say.\n\n100\n00:05:38.456 --> 00:05:41.861\nYou don't see them as much with\nthe whole media flash war, but\n\n101\n00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:46.132\nthat is a whole other topic and it's\njust a little older, I guess you'd say.\n\n102\n00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:46.942\n&gt;&gt; We'll save that for another episode.\n\n103\n00:05:46.942 --> 00:05:48.458\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n104\n00:05:48.458 --> 00:05:51.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay so as long as you know that we\n\n105\n00:05:51.013 --> 00:05:55.445\nhave some file formats to consider\nwhen inserting into PowerPoint.\n\n106\n00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:58.725\nThe cool thing is, once you start\ngetting in the, if you have a file and\n\n107\n00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:02.875\nyou try to put it into PowerPoint, if it\nhas a problem, it will give you a warning.\n\n108\n00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:06.905\nIt will say like, I don't understand this,\nI'm not reading it properly.\n\n109\n00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:12.035\nSo, it'll tell you if something is\ngone all right within PowerPoint.\n\n110\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.280\n&gt;&gt; So how you're going to get your files?\n\n111\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.240\nYou're gonna have to get\nthem from somewhere and\n\n112\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.480\nI actually do have some files\non my computer that I'd like to,\n\n113\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.580\nbefore I actually go in to show you\nhow they insert into PowerPoint.\n\n114\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.690\nJust wanna give you a quick\noverview of where we're going.\n\n115\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.510\nI have some M4A files and\nI have some M4V files.\n\n116\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.340\nThese did come of of my iPhone.\n\n117\n00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.515\nI use the Voice Memo app and I [LAUGH]\nrun around recording my cats [LAUGH].\n\n118\n00:06:40.515 --> 00:06:42.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They were very confused like why\n\n119\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.715\nare you shoving this phone\non my face right now, mom.\n\n120\n00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:48.986\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so I did record Bishop [SOUND].\n\n121\n00:06:48.986 --> 00:06:53.073\nHe talks all the time but then of course\nI couldn't get him to talk on command, so\n\n122\n00:06:53.073 --> 00:06:57.002\nI had to hold him and he gets very upset\nand so this is him not being very happy.\n\n123\n00:06:57.002 --> 00:07:00.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n124\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.950\n&gt;&gt; He's not happy.\n\n125\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.811\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not happy.\n\n126\n00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:02.332\n&gt;&gt; Let me down.\n\n127\n00:07:02.332 --> 00:07:04.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think that.\n\n128\n00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.860\nSo I have some sound\nclips of Bishop on here.\n\n129\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.981\nI also have, I couldn't get\nFuego de Miao that night so,\n\n130\n00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:19.385\nwe had this little cat claw here in\nthe studio that if you pull the trigger\n\n131\n00:07:19.385 --> 00:07:25.067\nit makes a tiger sound so\nI recorded that for our sound of Fuego.\n\n132\n00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:27.520\nLet me go ahead and change the view\non this so that you can see.\n\n133\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.910\nI also have some video files\nthat they come off of my iPhone.\n\n134\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.790\nAnd I also have an MP3, this is\nan actual full song from the artist that\n\n135\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.282\nhas given me permission to use this,\nbecause I kind of know him.\n\n136\n00:07:41.282 --> 00:07:45.808\n[LAUGH] So I have an actual file,\na song file that I have used that we're\n\n137\n00:07:45.808 --> 00:07:50.179\ngoing to play across a whole bunch\nof slides because a lot of times,\n\n138\n00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:53.379\na lot of people what they\nwanna do in PowerPoint,\n\n139\n00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:56.839\nthey wanna create a A picture\nslide show with music.\n\n140\n00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:59.436\nUsually always got that request when\nwe were teaching PowerPoint, so,\n\n141\n00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:00.680\nI'm gonna show you how to do that.\n\n142\n00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.235\n&gt;&gt; Get some background\nmusic across my slides.\n\n143\n00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:05.290\nYes, so we're gonna show you and\nit's gotten a lot easier.\n\n144\n00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.581\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Remember it wasn't.\n\n145\n00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:08.450\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; As fluid as it used to be and it's now,\n\n146\n00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.030\nyou'll see, cliffhanger\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, I have some audio and\n\n147\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.010\nvideo files that we're going to go ahead\nand put into our PowerPoint presentation.\n\n148\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.450\n&gt;&gt; So, step one then is just to get all\nyour media together, whatever it is.\n\n149\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.410\nAudio clips, if you're\ndownloading them from the web and\n\n150\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.280\nyou have license rights to use them.\n\n151\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.110\nPictures, and whatever the case maybe,\nget it all ready, get it on your computer.\n\n152\n00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.570\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, or somebody maybe has sent\nthem to you, that like, we went ahead and\n\n153\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.120\nfilmed Nate, installing this mailbox.\n\n154\n00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.430\nHere is the file from my device.\n\n155\n00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n156\n00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n157\n00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.050\nSo, now I'm in PowerPoint I want\nto go ahead and insert my audio.\n\n158\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.700\nSo, we're going to go to Insert.\n\n159\n00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.320\nWe're gonna come over to our Media group\nand we're going to go to Audio and\n\n160\n00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.600\nwe're going to choose Audio on my\nPC because, I do have that file.\n\n161\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.610\nNow, I'm gonna go out and\nfind the file that I want to go into, and\n\n162\n00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.410\nthere's Bishop not happy, and\nwe're going to insert this, and\n\n163\n00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:04.080\nit comes up as a little speaker\nicon that I can then move around.\n\n164\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.400\nI could go ahead and make it bigger.\n\n165\n00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.240\nThis is just my visual\nrepresentation of the sound file.\n\n166\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:17.300\n&gt;&gt; That I will be able to play on click,\nand that is the default playback setting,\n\n167\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.810\nand you will see that there\nis a Play button here,\n\n168\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.950\nas a whole bunch of other things that\nwe're going to start exploring right now.\n\n169\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.165\nWhat if I don't like the speaker icon?\n\n170\n00:09:27.165 --> 00:09:33.610\nIt indicates sound, but I wanted to like\nsay meow, or something to that effect.\n\n171\n00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.940\nYou can change, what this icon looks like,\nbecause you can see in the audio\n\n172\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.310\ntools contextual tabs,\nwe have a format and we have a playback.\n\n173\n00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.910\nSo, the format is going to\nformat the visual picture,\n\n174\n00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.560\nin this case the speaker picture.\n\n175\n00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.580\nAnd I could make borders and I could\ndo different types of effects on it,\n\n176\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.830\njust like I would with any type of image,\nbut I want to change the picture,\n\n177\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.750\nthere is this weird thing that's\nhappening on my computer.\n\n178\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.535\nI honestly, can't tell you why.\n\n179\n00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:08.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I should have a little icon right here,\n\n180\n00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.520\nthat says change picture.\n\n181\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.200\nIt's not there.\n\n182\n00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.000\nI really don't know why.\n\n183\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.065\nLet me switch over to Joey's computer,\nI was Justin, now I'm Joey.\n\n184\n00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:26.040\nCuz, I did the exact same file, or\nwell the same audio file inserted\n\n185\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.620\ninto this PowerPoint presentation\non his format tab right there.\n\n186\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.340\nLet's change picture.\n\n187\n00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.130\nSo, if for some reason,\nyou're like me, and\n\n188\n00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.600\nyou don't know why that, like picture,\nchange picture is not available.\n\n189\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.260\nI don't really know either.\n\n190\n00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.865\nBut, it's okay, because we can always.\n\n191\n00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:47.340\nWhat's wrong virtual machine, here we go.\n\n192\n00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.960\nWe can always change it.\n\n193\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.780\nRemember back if you'd watched the first\nseries of the PowerPoint 2016.\n\n194\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.640\nYou can always add commands that you\ndon't see, or you don't commonly use.\n\n195\n00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.790\nOn the quick access tool bar and\n\n196\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.630\nthat is actually what I did right here\nthe change picture cuz, it does exist.\n\n197\n00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.520\nIt is part of the program.\n\n198\n00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.400\nIt just not displaying for\nme for some reason.\n\n199\n00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.210\nBut, just to remind you really quickly,\nyou can always go to the more commands and\n\n200\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.500\nthen you can find the command\nthat you're looking for.\n\n201\n00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.920\nI know that it is on the audio tools.\n\n202\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.670\nFormat tab and\nthen I found the change picture.\n\n203\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.219\nAnd then I added it to\nmy quick access toolbar.\n\n204\n00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:25.928\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n205\n00:11:25.928 --> 00:11:29.420\n&gt;&gt; So, we're going to click\non that to change picture.\n\n206\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.316\nAnd then I can go out and you can either\nfind a file on your computer cuz,\n\n207\n00:11:33.316 --> 00:11:36.953\nmaybe I created, maybe just a little\npicture of Bishop's face or\n\n208\n00:11:36.953 --> 00:11:40.083\nit says meow well,\nI don't have any of that ready to go.\n\n209\n00:11:40.083 --> 00:11:43.817\nSo, you can always do an image\nsearch if you wanted to and\n\n210\n00:11:43.817 --> 00:11:46.836\nwe can type in meow and\nthen it will go ahead and\n\n211\n00:11:46.836 --> 00:11:51.858\nfind a picture that's a funny little\npicture but, I do want it to say meow.\n\n212\n00:11:51.858 --> 00:11:53.025\nSo, why we go ahead and\n\n213\n00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:56.870\nuse this one and then we can insert\nit into our PowerPoint presentation.\n\n214\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.580\nAnd then it changes what I want\nthis icon to look like for\n\n215\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.420\nwhen I click on it to be able\nto play the presentation.\n\n216\n00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.150\nAnd then you can format this is\nsame way that you would format any\n\n217\n00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.780\nimage that you wanted to do.\n\n218\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.810\nLet's just go ahead and\nrun the slide, so just so\n\n219\n00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.790\nI can show you what it's\ngoing to look like right now,\n\n220\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:20.930\nbefore we start doing some customizations\nto how the sound is going to play back.\n\n221\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:27.590\nSo, if I go from current slide,\nI will have to then click on that icon.\n\n222\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:33.650\nNotice that it does, when I hover over it,\nit does bring up that timeline for\n\n223\n00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.900\nmy audio and then I can click the play\nbutton and it will go through and play.\n\n224\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.690\nAnd I can scrub through this by clicking\non the different parts of this but,\n\n225\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.550\nI know that there is a point at\nabout ten seconds of like when there\n\n226\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:51.470\nis that big meow from Bishop and\nI want to be able to get right to that.\n\n227\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.360\nSo, I wanna show you a few different\nvariations on how we can do that.\n\n228\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.080\nI gonna hit Escape to go ahead and\nget out of the slide show.\n\n229\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.420\nThat would be formatting the different\nplay back options that I have with this\n\n230\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:02.920\nsound clip.\n\n231\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.380\nYou can do two things,\nyou can either add a bookmark and\n\n232\n00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.110\nthat bookmark is just like if you\nwould add a bookmark into a book,\n\n233\n00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.120\nit's like a quick reference\npoint of where I can go to and\n\n234\n00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.890\nget right to the place that\nI want to be within my book.\n\n235\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:24.910\nNow, how you add a bookmark because,\nif you start playing the sound file either\n\n236\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.980\nfrom here or from here and I can listen\nto where I want it to go or I can scrub,\n\n237\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:36.120\nI know that it is a about, right before\nten seconds, probably about right there.\n\n238\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.910\nAnd you see how I clicked up here on the\nadd bookmark and it added a little yellow\n\n239\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.940\ndot in that timeline of the audio file for\nme to be able to quickly jump to.\n\n240\n00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.390\nCuz, maybe you had\na really long audio clip,\n\n241\n00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.700\nand you wanted to be able to\nget into specific places,\n\n242\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.890\nyou can add that bookmark so,\nyou can just jump right to it.\n\n243\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.320\nSay, here's where I wanna start and\n\n244\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.050\nthen hit the play button and\nit will go ahead and play through there.\n\n245\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.410\nThat's one way that you could do it,\n\n246\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.390\nbut maybe I don't even want any of\nthat beginning, the first ten seconds.\n\n247\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.910\nI want it to start right\nabout that ten seconds.\n\n248\n00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.740\nYou could trim the audio if you wanted to.\n\n249\n00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.380\nYou do have some very basic sound\nediting capabilities within PowerPoint.\n\n250\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.080\nOr I could say I want to have the start,\nthe green part of the side.\n\n251\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:29.260\nI wanna move that in to say start about\nnineish seconds cuz, I know it comes right\n\n252\n00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.600\naround that ten second mark and I could\nsay that's the part that I want to start.\n\n253\n00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.430\nAnd maybe I don't wanna have it\ngo all the way through the end,\n\n254\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.050\nI can change the ending and\n\n255\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:43.040\nI can make what was a 20 second sound\nclip Into about two, three seconds.\n\n256\n00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.510\nBecause, that's all I really need to\nhave to be able to hear Bishop's big,\n\n257\n00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.490\nunhappy meow.\n\n258\n00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:54.949\nSo, I can click okay, and\nnow you could see that if I play this,\n\n259\n00:14:54.949 --> 00:15:01.447\n[SOUND] That's the sound file that I\nwanted, just that one little section.\n\n260\n00:15:01.447 --> 00:15:06.112\nSo, I think that's some really handy\nways that you can get to the specific\n\n261\n00:15:06.112 --> 00:15:08.410\npoint of the sound that you want.\n\n262\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.040\nEither add a bookmark or\nyou can trim the audio.\n\n263\n00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.490\nI am having it Start on Click,\nwhich is what I want to do,\n\n264\n00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.180\nbecause I want to be able\nto control how this works.\n\n265\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.200\nWe will go over some of these other\noptions about why would I wanna hide\n\n266\n00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.377\nit during the show,\n\n267\n00:15:23.377 --> 00:15:27.909\nrewind after playing, if you wanted to\nbe able to click on it multiple times.\n\n268\n00:15:27.909 --> 00:15:30.771\nThat can be why you would want to let's\nput it back to the beginning, and\n\n269\n00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:33.670\nthen I can just go ahead and\nclick the Play button.\n\n270\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.735\nLoop, Until stopped.\n\n271\n00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:36.397\nIf I just want it to be meow, meow, meow,\n\n272\n00:15:36.397 --> 00:15:38.207\nmeow that might get\na little annoying [LAUGH].\n\n273\n00:15:38.207 --> 00:15:41.875\nBut, that's what they like\nto do to me all the time.\n\n274\n00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:43.165\nIt's like, please stop [LAUGH].\n\n275\n00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:47.989\nSo, loop until stopped,\nwe could go ahead and choose that as well,\n\n276\n00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:50.286\nand some of our volume options.\n\n277\n00:15:50.286 --> 00:15:51.861\nThe play across slides.\n\n278\n00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:53.668\nIf you think about what\nwe talked about earlier.\n\n279\n00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:57.291\nThat is going to be one of the options\nthat we're going to look at when we want\n\n280\n00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.140\nto play that sound in the background.\n\n281\n00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.080\nBut play in the backgrounds right there.\n\n282\n00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.317\nThat's actually the easiest way to do it.\n\n283\n00:16:03.317 --> 00:16:05.310\nBut we're not there yet.\n\n284\n00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.030\n&gt;&gt; So if we've already got the file\nwe want to insert or we go and\n\n285\n00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.050\nfind out on the internet.\n\n286\n00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.170\nWhat if I want to create my own?\n\n287\n00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.230\nCan I do that with a little\nmicrophone on my computer?\n\n288\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.880\nWe can, you can record directly\nrecord into the slide.\n\n289\n00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.310\nAnd you can just make whatever\nnarration you want to do.\n\n290\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.179\nFor example, on slide five here, we have,\n\n291\n00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:31.580\nI feel like I can record something\nto this toner that he's not happy.\n\n292\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.510\nI put his real top end on there.\n\n293\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:37.345\nAnd I want to record a little\nnarration over this slide.\n\n294\n00:16:37.345 --> 00:16:40.870\nWe can go to Insert,\nwe can go to Media and\n\n295\n00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.360\nin the Audio, we are going to\nrecord directly into PowerPoint.\n\n296\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.310\nYou must have saw that option.\n\n297\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.789\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good lead in, so\n\n298\n00:16:48.789 --> 00:16:51.330\nwe'll go to record audio, and\n\n299\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.540\nI could name this Fuego,\nyou can name it whatever you want.\n\n300\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.720\nAnd we're going to click\nthe little recording button.\n\n301\n00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.680\nAnd as soon as I click that,\nit's going to start what I want to say.\n\n302\n00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.470\nMerry Christmas,\nmy mom dresses me funny and bah humbug.\n\n303\n00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.394\n&gt;&gt; Sounds just like Fuego.\n\n304\n00:17:10.394 --> 00:17:11.187\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n305\n00:17:11.187 --> 00:17:14.940\n[LAUGH] I probably could have got\na little bit more animated on that one,\n\n306\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.740\nbut just for demonstration purposes\nI figured we'll just go with that.\n\n307\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.910\nAnd I can go ahead and move this icon.\n\n308\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.640\nI'm going to move it right over here so\nI can see it a little bit more.\n\n309\n00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.220\nAnd if I play it,\nit might be a little loud.\n\n310\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.080\n&gt;&gt; Merry Christmas!\n\n311\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.900\nMy mom dresses me funny and bah humbug.\n\n312\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you could see that\nit's playing that audio file,\n\n313\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.020\nright from when I recorded\nit into PowerPoint.\n\n314\n00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:40.860\nOn this slide,\n\n315\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.670\nI did want to demonstrate why you\nmight want to hide during the show.\n\n316\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.710\nBecause I would like\nthe slide to come up and\n\n317\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.080\nimmediately have that sound clip start.\n\n318\n00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.760\nSo instead of starting On Click,\n\n319\n00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.730\nI wanted to start Automatically\nwhen the slide comes up.\n\n320\n00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.072\nMay be I don't want people\nto see the little speaker,\n\n321\n00:18:01.072 --> 00:18:05.290\nI can say I don't need it to click on to\nbe able to trigger the sound to start.\n\n322\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.310\nSo Hide During Show,\nwould be a nice option here.\n\n323\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.820\nLet's go back to slide four and\nstart the show from there.\n\n324\n00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.220\nSo you can see that in this\none I would go ahead and\n\n325\n00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.185\ncontrol when I want to click\non Bishop meowing [SOUND].\n\n326\n00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:23.812\nAnd if I added the sound file or\n\n327\n00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:27.393\ntiger sound that we have shown before\nI could add it in the slide and\n\n328\n00:18:27.393 --> 00:18:30.665\nbe able to click on it and\nbe able to control when it happens.\n\n329\n00:18:30.665 --> 00:18:32.115\nI'm going to advance the slide.\n\n330\n00:18:33.152 --> 00:18:34.362\n&gt;&gt; Merry Christmas.\n\n331\n00:18:34.362 --> 00:18:35.912\nMy mom dressing me funny and buh humbug.\n\n332\n00:18:35.912 --> 00:18:40.984\n&gt;&gt; So you guys see that it just starting\nas soon as the slide pops up and\n\n333\n00:18:40.984 --> 00:18:42.932\nI don't have any icons.\n\n334\n00:18:42.932 --> 00:18:47.962\nSo that's the reason why you don't want to\nhave that check on for hide during show.\n\n335\n00:18:47.962 --> 00:18:52.180\nAnd I'm gonna hit escape\nto cancel out of this.\n\n336\n00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:56.010\nSo what about adding video\ninto our presentation?\n\n337\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.820\nIf we can audio, we can add video.\n\n338\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.900\nLet's go into the insert and\nlet's go into media.\n\n339\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.000\nWe'll go to video and you can see\nright here, you have video on my PC,\n\n340\n00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.070\nfrom the one that we're Fuego\nchasing the computer mouse.\n\n341\n00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.180\nBut if I didn't have a video from my\ncomputer, you can always go online,\n\n342\n00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.180\nwhich is going to be our next\nexample in the next slide.\n\n343\n00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.210\nBut let's go ahead and\ngo with video on my PC.\n\n344\n00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.720\nAnd I will choose this file right here,\nand I will insert it.\n\n345\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.258\nAnd heres is the video file this is a\nlittle like its a little longer because I\n\n346\n00:19:30.258 --> 00:19:31.760\ndid recorded on my Iphone.\n\n347\n00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.590\nSo that aspect ratio is due to how\nwas actually filmed on the device\n\n348\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:43.103\nthat filmed the file [LAUGH] I\nhave a little bit circling there.\n\n349\n00:19:43.103 --> 00:19:45.833\n[LAUGH] But\nif yours a little more four by three or\n\n350\n00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:49.130\nsix by nine it all depends on\nhow was actually captured.\n\n351\n00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.320\nAnd then I could go ahead and\nplay a video here.\n\n352\n00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.690\nAnd we'll let this run for\n\n353\n00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.010\na little while while I go ahead and\ndo some of the other options.\n\n354\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.440\nWe can watch Fuego try to\nchase a computer mouse.\n\n355\n00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.360\nIt's a great little game that we play.\n\n356\n00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.675\nBut you can see that you can format\nthis video the same way that\n\n357\n00:20:05.675 --> 00:20:07.928\nyou would format some other pictures.\n\n358\n00:20:07.928 --> 00:20:10.625\nSorry, I just realized it stop\nthe playback while I went to some of\n\n359\n00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:11.590\nthis options.\n\n360\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.340\nBut I could color this,\nI could make this more like of black and\n\n361\n00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.170\nwhite or I could give it like Orange hue.\n\n362\n00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.900\nSo all of this different\nediting options or\n\n363\n00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.170\ncorrection if you want to say stylization\nthat you have for image you can do\n\n364\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.810\nthe same thing with the video that can\nadd a little bit a caza to the video.\n\n365\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.308\nYou could also come over\nhere to the playback and\n\n366\n00:20:32.308 --> 00:20:36.190\njust the same way that we talked about\nour audio files you can add a bookmark or\n\n367\n00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.707\nyou could also trim the video to be\nable of where you wanted to start and\n\n368\n00:20:39.707 --> 00:20:42.400\nstop if you didn't want\nthe whole thing to play out.\n\n369\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.760\nAnd the same playback options that you\nhave for audio are in the video as well.\n\n370\n00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.805\nAnd I know there's right\nabout I think here is where\n\n371\n00:20:52.805 --> 00:20:57.966\nhe starts to he tries he\ndoesnt understand that there\n\n372\n00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:05.025\nis something he starts going behind\nthe computer like is it back there.\n\n373\n00:21:05.025 --> 00:21:10.531\nSo maybe I want to be able to get right\nto that specific point within the video,\n\n374\n00:21:10.531 --> 00:21:13.680\nthat's where adding the bookmark around.\n\n375\n00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.353\nI think it was around that, yeah 34,\n\n376\n00:21:16.353 --> 00:21:21.860\n35 seconds that I could add that bookmark\nand be able to use that playback.\n\n377\n00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.560\nAnd the same thing of having\nit start automatically or\n\n378\n00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.530\non click are all the same options here.\n\n379\n00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.540\nIf I wanted to insert an online video,\nwe could do that as well.\n\n380\n00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:38.520\nSo, we could go at the wonderful world of\nYouTube and pick some fun little videos.\n\n381\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.150\nWe could always say funny cats.\n\n382\n00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.130\nCuz there's not very many videos\nabout funny cats out there.\n\n383\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.906\nSo I don't think we have\na very good selection.\n\n384\n00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:49.215\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n385\n00:21:49.215 --> 00:21:50.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I could go ahead and\n\n386\n00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:54.375\npick whichever video that I would\nlike to go ahead and insert.\n\n387\n00:21:54.375 --> 00:21:58.445\nAnd you still have the same,\nsome of the same playback options and\n\n388\n00:21:58.445 --> 00:22:00.080\nI could make this bigger.\n\n389\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.368\nAnd you do have some of your formatting\noptions, note that you will need to be\n\n390\n00:22:04.368 --> 00:22:09.060\nconnected to the Internet when you are\npresenting this video, this online video.\n\n391\n00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.150\nIt doesn't live in your\nPowerPoint presentation,\n\n392\n00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.120\nyou do need to have a Internet connection.\n\n393\n00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.620\nSo if that is something\nthat you need to consider,\n\n394\n00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:20.350\nbe aware that you might want\nto not use this option.\n\n395\n00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.790\nYou can't change, like you can't trim or\nadd bookmarks to it, but\n\n396\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.710\nit does have that timeline that\nyou could scrub through and\n\n397\n00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:30.190\nbe able to pick the different\nparts of it if you needed to.\n\n398\n00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.440\nSo if I did want to play this and\nsee some of the funny cat videos.\n\n399\n00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.181\nAnd maybe,\n\n400\n00:22:35.181 --> 00:22:40.570\nyou're gonna just have to remember where\nin the video that you need to jump to.\n\n401\n00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.870\nAnd the regular time like\nyou would have in YouTube.\n\n402\n00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.775\nI know there is, that's a little\nloud I know about right here.\n\n403\n00:22:46.775 --> 00:22:51.265\n[LAUGH] I don't know why that's so,\n[LAUGH]\n\n404\n00:22:51.265 --> 00:22:52.153\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n405\n00:22:52.153 --> 00:22:53.603\n[MUSIC]\n\n406\n00:22:53.603 --> 00:22:54.751\n&gt;&gt; That just makes me laugh.\n\n407\n00:22:54.751 --> 00:22:56.628\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:22:56.628 --> 00:22:58.062\n&gt;&gt; He looks so sad and\n\n409\n00:22:58.062 --> 00:23:03.780\nprestigious at the same time,\nlook at me, I'm in my collared shirt.\n\n410\n00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.667\nBut yeah, so.\n\n411\n00:23:04.667 --> 00:23:07.549\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyways you could go ahead and\n\n412\n00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:12.352\njump to the specific places that you\nwant on your online video the same way\n\n413\n00:23:12.352 --> 00:23:13.940\nthat you would online.\n\n414\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.153\nAnd the last one that I wanted to\nget in before we take a small break,\n\n415\n00:23:18.153 --> 00:23:20.950\nbecause I realize I do\nhave a lot more to say.\n\n416\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.910\nSo we're gonna finish up for\nthis last example.\n\n417\n00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.999\nAnd then will go ahead and\nstop cuz I can see you looking at me and\n\n418\n00:23:26.999 --> 00:23:29.030\nlike hey we're getting close, [LAUGH].\n\n419\n00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:33.493\nIf I needed to do a screen recording,\nI love this feature because I do a lot\n\n420\n00:23:33.493 --> 00:23:38.397\nof demonstrations and if I was making\na PowerPoint presentation how to navigate\n\n421\n00:23:38.397 --> 00:23:43.374\nwithin the Windows Explorer, your file\nstructure, or I want to demonstrate how\n\n422\n00:23:43.374 --> 00:23:47.577\nto use Excel, I could go ahead and\nput it right into the PowerPoint.\n\n423\n00:23:47.577 --> 00:23:52.620\nAnd it will record my audio as I'm\ndemonstrating what I want on the screen.\n\n424\n00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.820\nSo, this is, to me, very fantastic.\n\n425\n00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.300\nYou do have to get everything ready for\nwhat you wanted to do.\n\n426\n00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.360\nSo, if I was going to be demonstrating\nExcel, I would make sure to have Excel\n\n427\n00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.030\nopen, that's the thing behind, if you\nwanna say my PowerPoint presentation.\n\n428\n00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.460\nFor this example I'm just gonna quickly\nshow how I can go to the desktop within\n\n429\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.870\nour Windows Explorer.\n\n430\n00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:17.960\nSo, I'm going to bring back up PowerPoint,\nI'm going to insert the screen recording.\n\n431\n00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.861\nSee how it automatically,\n\n432\n00:24:19.861 --> 00:24:24.660\nit minimized PowerPoint to show\nwhatever was left on your computer.\n\n433\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.550\nSo just go ahead and setup your area\nbefore you start your screen recording,\n\n434\n00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.130\nand then I can go ahead and set the area\nthat I want to record cuz maybe\n\n435\n00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.940\nI don't want to record my entire screen,\nI only want to designate this part.\n\n436\n00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.440\nSo, you ahead and\nset what you want it to be.\n\n437\n00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.810\nWhether it is your full screen or not and\nthen you go ahead and click record,\n\n438\n00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.460\nand it will count you down.\n\n439\n00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:51.090\nSo, you get ready, to say what I wanna\nsay and how you get to your desktop is\n\n440\n00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.830\nyou come over here to your quick\naccess and you click desktop and\n\n441\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.235\nthat's where you can get your desktop or\nwhatever else you need to say.\n\n442\n00:24:59.235 --> 00:25:03.680\nAnd can move your mouse up to where\nit brings up your controls again,\n\n443\n00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.020\nyou can click the stop button.\n\n444\n00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.610\nI didn't point out that those little\nbuttons over on the side were as recording\n\n445\n00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.320\naudio and recording where your\nmouse is automatically on.\n\n446\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.310\nBut if you did not want to record\nthe audio while you're doing your\n\n447\n00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.950\ndemonstration, you can\njust turn that option off.\n\n448\n00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.370\nAnd now, I have my screen recording,\nit is not going to be\n\n449\n00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:25.870\nin high definition because it is\nit's going directly into Powerpoint.\n\n450\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.454\nBut for a demonstration purposes,\nit is going to look pretty decent.\n\n451\n00:25:29.454 --> 00:25:34.951\nBut I know that I went ahead-\n&gt;&gt; How you get to your desktop is-\n\n452\n00:25:34.951 --> 00:25:35.550\n&gt;&gt; I scared myself.\n\n453\n00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.354\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n454\n00:25:37.354 --> 00:25:43.340\nI know that right about here is where\nI went ahead and stop the video.\n\n455\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.630\nThis is where you can go to your playback,\nyou can trim that out and\n\n456\n00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.020\nsay, I don't want it.\n\n457\n00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.635\nI want it to stop about, that would\ndrive the right one, right about there.\n\n458\n00:25:54.635 --> 00:25:58.455\nAnd that's the part where I don't want\nit to show everybody that I have stopped\n\n459\n00:25:58.455 --> 00:25:59.875\nmy screen recording.\n\n460\n00:25:59.875 --> 00:26:05.265\nAnd then you can go ahead and trim your\nvideo and you can resize it accordingly.\n\n461\n00:26:05.265 --> 00:26:08.715\nAnd so,\nthat's how you can get a screen recording\n\n462\n00:26:08.715 --> 00:26:10.495\ninto your PowerPoint presentation.\n\n463\n00:26:10.495 --> 00:26:11.885\n&gt;&gt; All right, fantastic, Vonne.\n\n464\n00:26:11.885 --> 00:26:14.845\nGreat look there at how we can\ninsert audio, insert video.\n\n465\n00:26:14.845 --> 00:26:17.620\nWhether we get it from the web or\nwhether we already have it.\n\n466\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.280\nOr whether we record it live on our\ncomputer, and putting in the screenshots.\n\n467\n00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.710\nFantastic stuff, and I know you got\nmore to cover, but we are, as you said,\n\n468\n00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.620\nout of time for this one.\n\n469\n00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.590\nSo we'll cut it off now,\nwe'll come back with the part two.\n\n470\n00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.730\nSo, I hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n471\n00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.670\nSounding off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n472\n00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:35.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n473\n00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.088\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n474\n00:26:37.088 --> 00:26:42.935\n[MUSIC]\n\n475\n00:26:42.935 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:15.462\n&gt;&gt; Hello welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:20.277\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and today\nwe're doing our Advanced PowerPoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:23.580\nSpecifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at audio and video.\n\n7\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.460\nWe've already done one part on audio and\nvideo, but\n\n8\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.140\nthere's more that we need to go over.\n\n9\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.020\nAnd here to help us is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.850\nWelcome back, Vonne.\n\n11\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.590\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.580\nYes, cuz we had a lot of fun\ninserting our cat videos.\n\n13\n00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.070\nWe saw some Fuego chasing the mouse.\n\n14\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.180\nAnd, it was great to go ahead and\nget everything in there.\n\n15\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.380\nBut I wanted to explain\na few things that you\n\n16\n00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.680\nneed to understand when you're\nputting in audio and video files.\n\n17\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.030\nBecause, video files are large,\nthey're big.\n\n18\n00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.040\nAnd if you are going to be\nputting in 15 of them, or\n\n19\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.530\n50, your file size is going to\nstart getting really, really large.\n\n20\n00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.550\nAnd so let's just talk about some of those\ndifferent things, and what we can do to\n\n21\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.830\ntry to reduce the size of our file and\nalso talk about compatibility within that.\n\n22\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.720\nBecause we did mention about our audio\nfiles, and we mentioned our codecs.\n\n23\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.590\nAnd what about if I'm doing fine on my\nmachine, could I be running into potential\n\n24\n00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.090\nissues, if I were to go somewhere else, or\nput this presentation on another machine?\n\n25\n00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.075\nSo the nice thing is that PowerPoint\nhas all that built in for us,\n\n26\n00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:27.590\nand it can really help us out.\n\n27\n00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.900\nSo let's jump back in to where we had just\nleft off in our audio and video file.\n\n28\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.120\nWe had last left off on\nmy screen recording.\n\n29\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.590\nActually, I really didn't do much at all,\nI didn't do anything.\n\n30\n00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.819\nI just stopped right where we were,\ncuz I knew that we had more to talk about.\n\n31\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.970\nSo if I save this file,\nI'm gonna do a file Save as, and\n\n32\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.730\nI'm going to put it in the same folder and\nI'll do a show done.\n\n33\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.740\nThere's a reason why I'm naming it\nbecause since the file that I'm\n\n34\n00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.570\ncreating within the show that\nwe are recording right now.\n\n35\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.850\nCuz I have other examples in there\nwhich you'll see in just a second.\n\n36\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.032\nI'm gonna go ahead and close this file.\n\n37\n00:02:01.032 --> 00:02:06.275\nIf you look at the file size,\nlook it's 74,000\n\n38\n00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:12.811\nkb thats 74 megs right there or\n72-ish cuz it kinda goes down.\n\n39\n00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:17.963\nI can't remember the exact [CROSSTALK].\n\n40\n00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:23.995\nYes, 1024,\n1024 bytes in a megabyte, right?\n\n41\n00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.130\n&gt;&gt; There's 1,024 kilobytes in a megabyte.\n\n42\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm glad I have a good tech\nexpert with me to remind me [LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.390\nof all of this math.\n\n44\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.830\nSo basically, this is a big file.\n\n45\n00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.040\nIt's a pretty decent sized file\nthat I need to at least consider.\n\n46\n00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.060\nNowadays if you have a newer computer and\na fast processor,\n\n47\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.880\nthis shouldn't be any of,\nreally that big of a filing issue be fine.\n\n48\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unless, I know a lot\nof corporate email servers put\n\n49\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.360\nlimits on attachment sizes and\nthings like that.\n\n50\n00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.399\nAnd what was perfectly fine until\nyou inserted all of these videos,\n\n51\n00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:59.640\nall of a sudden I can't\nemail it to anybody.\n\n52\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.660\nIt keeps getting returned and\nit's because it's just too large.\n\n53\n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.280\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and just knowing that\n\n54\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.040\nI'm putting a lot of information into a\nfile is just really the name of the game.\n\n55\n00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.480\nJust know, it is gonna get big and\nright there, I said into the file, right.\n\n56\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.330\nAny time you insert audio or\nvideo into a PowerPoint presentation,\n\n57\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.850\nit will embed itself automatically.\n\n58\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.210\nIt is part of the file.\n\n59\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.700\nSo it is not linked into the PowerPoint\npresentation, it lives within it.\n\n60\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.810\nBecause we actually did an episode about-\n&gt;&gt; Except for the online videos.\n\n61\n00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:33.600\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\n\n62\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.700\nThe online video doesn't live in there,\nbut you do need an internet connection,\n\n63\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.595\nso thank you for that correction.\n\n64\n00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:41.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But all the other files,\n\n65\n00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.740\nI don't have to worry about transporting\nthe files with the presentation.\n\n66\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.480\nLike the Bishop not happy, or\nthe one where he's chasing the mouse.\n\n67\n00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.600\n&gt;&gt; So we don't have to do a package for\nCD, to make sure that all those sounds and\n\n68\n00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.240\nvideos are included.\n\n69\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes, because it is not linked.\n\n70\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.840\nNow, you can link them.\n\n71\n00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.520\nSo I wanted to at least show you,\n\n72\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.910\nagain going through those options of\nwhat I can do to reduce the file size.\n\n73\n00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.540\nSo let's start here, you could see\nthat I do have a finished example,\n\n74\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.680\nan example optimized.\n\n75\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.660\nAnd I just wanted to point out\nright here the file size here.\n\n76\n00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.208\nYou have it about 72 megabytes, and\nthis one is 50 megabytes, what did I do?\n\n77\n00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:23.600\nLet me show you.\n\n78\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.320\nI'm gonna open this file up, it's pretty\nmuch the same thing that we have done\n\n79\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.146\nbefore, you can see that it's still\ngot the cat videos in there and\n\n80\n00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:35.230\nthe meow for Bishop.\n\n81\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.690\nI'm gonna go over to file, and\nI'm gonna go over to the info,\n\n82\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.420\ncuz in the info section you can see\nthat it's got two options here.\n\n83\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.150\nYou have optimized media compatibility and\nmedia size and performance.\n\n84\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.090\nThese are those two things that I had\ntalked about when I introduced the show.\n\n85\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.469\nIs that, PowerPoint is pretty smart now,\nthat it's saying hey you know what,\n\n86\n00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:59.338\nyou have a media file that you\nmight wanna optimize this.\n\n87\n00:04:59.338 --> 00:05:05.031\nSo you can improve your experience and\nyou can make sure that it is going\n\n88\n00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:11.760\nto convert into a file format that's going\nto be compatible across most devices.\n\n89\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.133\nIt's going to eliminate some of your,\npossible issues and\n\n90\n00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:19.200\nthat's a really nice thing to do for you.\n\n91\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.220\nSo you could go ahead and\noptimize the compatibility and\n\n92\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.960\nit will run through that.\n\n93\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.420\nI'm not going to actually click on it\nbecause it does take a little while.\n\n94\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.730\nBut I do have some screenshots for you.\n\n95\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.420\nIs that I have the optimize in progress.\n\n96\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.143\nCuz you can see that it found,\non slide six, and that was, remember,\n\n97\n00:05:37.143 --> 00:05:38.421\nI had it from my iPhone.\n\n98\n00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:42.113\nSo it was in a specific format\nthat was from the phone,\n\n99\n00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:47.100\nwhat if that's going to have\nproblems on other operating systems?\n\n100\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.159\nSo that's something that's going\nto actually convert, and make this\n\n101\n00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.970\nvideo in my Power Presentation\njust a little bit nicer.\n\n102\n00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.870\nIt speaks to all people instead\nof just the Apple people.\n\n103\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.810\nBecause it has processing and that was my\nscreenshot that I took for you guys, and\n\n104\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.670\nthen when it was done, it just says done.\n\n105\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.300\nI don't have a screenshot,\nbecause it just says finished.\n\n106\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.740\nBut the finished file,\n\n107\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.140\nlet me show you that after if\nI have the example optimized.\n\n108\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.370\nWell actually what this means is\nthat this is the online video, so\n\n109\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.130\nit's giving me that warning.\n\n110\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.460\nBut if I come over here to File,\nnotice that it grays out my Optimize.\n\n111\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.100\nIt's saying, I already optimized and\neverything's great, so\n\n112\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.730\nI've done everything that I could do\nto help you with your compatibility.\n\n113\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.230\nSo that's the finished product.\n\n114\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.414\nLet's go back over to our other file,\n\n115\n00:06:48.414 --> 00:06:52.290\nour finished example.\n\n116\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.980\nYes this one [LAUGH].\n\n117\n00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.890\nGetting myself a little confused\non which file I'm using.\n\n118\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.360\nAlways look at your title bars,\nand name your files accordingly.\n\n119\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.240\nMedia size and performance.\n\n120\n00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.790\nThis is saying that if you've got some\nmedia files that take up 66 megs,\n\n121\n00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.610\nwhat I could do is I could\nhelp you compress that media.\n\n122\n00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.000\nAnd if I choose this option,\nnow what option do I want?\n\n123\n00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.796\nDo I want an internet quality because it\ndoesn't have to be super high definition\n\n124\n00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:22.026\nor super high quality for the internet,\nbecause it's on the screen and\n\n125\n00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:24.791\nalso I don't want it to\ntake up too much space.\n\n126\n00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:28.092\nOr I could do a low quality,\nof where you've got the idea, and\n\n127\n00:07:28.092 --> 00:07:31.523\nI'm sure you've seen these on\nlike different YouTube videos or\n\n128\n00:07:31.523 --> 00:07:34.440\ndifferent streams of like,\nyou get the idea.\n\n129\n00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.390\nSome are really crystal clear and\nsome aren't.\n\n130\n00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.090\nWell that's just the way that it's\ntrying to compress that media to\n\n131\n00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.990\nnot have as much size.\n\n132\n00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.452\nSo you could see that this would probably\nbe the least, the little bit more, and\n\n133\n00:07:46.452 --> 00:07:50.196\nthen even more of the compressing\nto make your files a lot smaller.\n\n134\n00:07:50.196 --> 00:07:54.978\nI chose presentation quality, and I'm\ngonna just go ahead and start this just to\n\n135\n00:07:54.978 --> 00:07:59.073\nshow you that it's finding\nthe different files in my presentation.\n\n136\n00:07:59.073 --> 00:08:01.136\nAnd then it's gonna go ahead and\n\n137\n00:08:01.136 --> 00:08:05.502\nstart Processing them down to try\nto make them a little bit smaller.\n\n138\n00:08:05.502 --> 00:08:09.950\nSince I have four, but if you had\n40 it's gonna take a little bit.\n\n139\n00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.480\nSo I'm gonna cancel that just for\ntime purposes.\n\n140\n00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.180\nI don't need to go ahead and\nsave those changes here because\n\n141\n00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.650\nI do have the compress in progress,\nwhich you just saw.\n\n142\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.001\nAnd then the done, this is where is\ngoing to give you that report of saying,\n\n143\n00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:31.401\nhey I found this and I compressed it and\nI saved you 0.1 meg.\n\n144\n00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:33.611\nMaybe that not a huge change but\n\n145\n00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:37.189\nif you have a lot of them\nit will make a difference.\n\n146\n00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:41.551\nAnd if you have a really long recording,\nmy recordings were under a minute,\n\n147\n00:08:41.551 --> 00:08:46.256\nyou have a five, ten minute presentation\nor video in your presentation being able\n\n148\n00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:51.100\nto compress that, you're going to see\na more significant amount of compression.\n\n149\n00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.405\nSo that again is another handy\nfeature that PowerPoint gives us for\n\n150\n00:08:56.405 --> 00:09:02.952\nbeing able to help compress our file size\ndown to make it a little less cumbersome.\n\n151\n00:09:02.952 --> 00:09:05.329\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; If I need it to be.\n\n152\n00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:09.119\nNow I did mention that you can,\nif you wanted to,\n\n153\n00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:12.831\nyou can link to the external\naudio video files.\n\n154\n00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:17.190\nBut any time that you link to an external\ncontent, you do have to worry\n\n155\n00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.925\nabout bringing the files with you if you\nare ever going to change machines or\n\n156\n00:09:21.925 --> 00:09:23.599\nsend it to somebody else.\n\n157\n00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:28.142\nAnd we can use that package function that\nwe've talked about in some other episodes,\n\n158\n00:09:28.142 --> 00:09:32.180\nwhere packaging just goes ahead and\ncollects it all together into one folder\n\n159\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.230\nand you take the folder with\nyou instead of just the file.\n\n160\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.060\nNow how do you link to a file?\n\n161\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.590\nCuz we didn't see anything about linking,\ndid we?\n\n162\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.480\nIt just said insert and it just went.\n\n163\n00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.540\nWell, there's one small little\nthing to notice when you're telling\n\n164\n00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.620\nit to insert the video, that button\nactually has a drop down with it.\n\n165\n00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.880\nAnd I actually have a file that we're\ngoing to start as the video embedded.\n\n166\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.440\nAnd also before I open it,\ndo you see the file size right there?\n\n167\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.067\n&gt;&gt; 75 links.\n\n168\n00:10:02.067 --> 00:10:03.650\n&gt;&gt; And the other one that is linked.\n\n169\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.655\n&gt;&gt; Three and a half links.\n\n170\n00:10:04.655 --> 00:10:07.450\n&gt;&gt; That's significantly smaller,\nisn't it, but\n\n171\n00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.270\nI still have to bring all the other\nfiles with it they are just as big.\n\n172\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.097\nSo I'm not sure if it's,\n\n173\n00:10:12.097 --> 00:10:17.759\nyou're still gonna have overall in the\nfolder even if it's linked or embedded.\n\n174\n00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:20.258\nYou're gonna have a decent\namount of information, so\n\n175\n00:10:20.258 --> 00:10:22.390\nit's really up to you\nwhich way you want to go.\n\n176\n00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.440\nI would suggest keeping it embedded\nbecause then you don't have\n\n177\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.044\nto remember but\nI just wanna at least show you the option.\n\n178\n00:10:30.044 --> 00:10:31.880\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to think\nof a scenario real quick.\n\n179\n00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.870\nMaybe your coworker has access to\nthe same media file so rather than put it\n\n180\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.250\nembedded in and make the PowerPoint\nreally large, keep the PowerPoint small.\n\n181\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:41.970\nIt's just linked.\n\n182\n00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.039\nYou can send it to them,\nthey can re-link to it.\n\n183\n00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:44.540\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n184\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.270\n&gt;&gt; And still keep that\nPowerPoint really small and\n\n185\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.740\nnever have to move that big file.\n\n186\n00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as long as they know how\nto find the link style up box and\n\n187\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.000\nbe able to find it.\n\n188\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.570\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n189\n00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.311\n&gt;&gt; As long as they watched your videos.\n\n190\n00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:54.131\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n191\n00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:55.820\n&gt;&gt; Then they should be good to go.\n\n192\n00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.993\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great idea.\n\n193\n00:10:56.993 --> 00:10:59.433\nYes, definitely watch\nthose other episodes.\n\n194\n00:10:59.433 --> 00:11:02.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I have the video linked and\n\n195\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:12.150\nI also have a screen shot of when we\nwent to the insert file, oops, sorry.\n\n196\n00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.380\nThere we go.\n\n197\n00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.392\nThere's a drop down next to it.\n\n198\n00:11:14.392 --> 00:11:15.242\n&gt;&gt; That sneaky.\n\n199\n00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:16.730\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n200\n00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.196\nIf it says like hey,\nif you didn't wanna just go ahead and\n\n201\n00:11:20.196 --> 00:11:25.198\nclick the insert button, you can give me\nanother option of the linked to the file.\n\n202\n00:11:25.198 --> 00:11:29.618\nAnd we go ahead and\nenter the same way that we just did,\n\n203\n00:11:29.618 --> 00:11:35.216\nif l just clicked it but it is\ncreating that link to the information,\n\n204\n00:11:35.216 --> 00:11:39.930\nso that is how you can create\nthat if you so desire.\n\n205\n00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.673\n&gt;&gt; Also we've learn that you say that we\ncan package just like we did when we were\n\n206\n00:11:43.673 --> 00:11:46.259\nlearning about linking,\nembed external objects.\n\n207\n00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:50.740\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so we can go to our file,\nand we can go to export and\n\n208\n00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.905\nthen we can package for a CD.\n\n209\n00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:56.217\nAnd we go ahead and designate that\nwe wanna copy it to a folder, and\n\n210\n00:11:56.217 --> 00:12:00.010\nit will copy down all of the different\nvideos that we had linked to it.\n\n211\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.530\nI've actually already done this to this\nparticular video's linked presentation,\n\n212\n00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.570\nand I had it over here in the link\nvideo folder as you can see,\n\n213\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.040\nthat it did bring in those two videos that\n\n214\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.250\nI had inserted into the Power Point\npresentation and linked to.\n\n215\n00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:21.870\nAnd so this folder is what I would\nsend off to, or send to you,\n\n216\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.460\nor put wherever I need to go onto a thumb\ndrive and move on to my presentation.\n\n217\n00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.610\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\nyou've been keeping us in suspense.\n\n218\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.280\nYou've been telling us that there's a way\nthat I can put basically a sound track to\n\n219\n00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.110\nmy presentation, have an audio file\nplay through the entire presentation.\n\n220\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can.\n\n221\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.555\nSo, why don't we go ahead and\njump into that one.\n\n222\n00:12:40.555 --> 00:12:42.650\nI just went ahead and closed a few things.\n\n223\n00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:49.149\nI have that file or that sound,\nthat song that I wanted to play here.\n\n224\n00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:51.098\n[MUSIC]\n\n225\n00:12:51.098 --> 00:12:55.820\nIt's relaxing background music that\nyou can put to some beautiful imagery.\n\n226\n00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:01.206\nSo I have a presentation that\nwe are going to do that and\n\n227\n00:13:01.206 --> 00:13:05.173\nit is called slide transition images.\n\n228\n00:13:05.173 --> 00:13:06.786\nAnd let's try it again.\n\n229\n00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:11.170\n[LAUGH] Here we go.\n\n230\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.400\nSo I have my pictures and\n\n231\n00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.040\nthis is just pictures inserted\ninto a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n232\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.620\nI'm going to go to slide one.\n\n233\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.430\nI want to insert that sound here because\nI do want the sound to start at the very\n\n234\n00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.010\nbeginning of my slide show.\n\n235\n00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:31.680\nSo we'll go to Insert, and we will go to\nMedia and we will go to Audio from my PC.\n\n236\n00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.030\nHere's the MP3 that I want to play.\n\n237\n00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.620\nI'm gonna just put this over here for\nnow so we can see it.\n\n238\n00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.825\nIt's almost too simple.\n\n239\n00:13:40.825 --> 00:13:42.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You just click Play in Background.\n\n240\n00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.790\nAnd you see as soon as\nyou choose that option,\n\n241\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.550\nit's going to hide during the show,\nwhich we had covered.\n\n242\n00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.830\nIt's going to loop until stopped and\nit's going to play across the slides, and\n\n243\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.160\nit's gonna start automatically,\nwhich is fantastic.\n\n244\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.240\nThe loop until stopped, something you\nneed to consider is how long is your\n\n245\n00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.550\nsound file, your song,\nhow many slides you have your\n\n246\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:10.120\nsound might not be done by the time\nyou get through the presentation.\n\n247\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.120\nSo you just have to kind\nof think about that,\n\n248\n00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.510\nand how long do I want the transitions\nthat happen automatically?\n\n249\n00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.360\nCuz that's another thing that you would\nhave to do, which we don't have set,\n\n250\n00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.940\nwhich we'll go ahead and go over\nreally quickly is that I need to know\n\n251\n00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.250\nhow many seconds I want\nto have on each picture.\n\n252\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.170\nAnd you could time it to\nthe music if you wanted to.\n\n253\n00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.020\nI'm gonna come over here to transitions,\nand\n\n254\n00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.920\nI'm going to have it advance automatically\nafter let's say five seconds,\n\n255\n00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.790\nlike each slide is going to take\nfive seconds to go through.\n\n256\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.083\nWe do need to make sure we apply to all.\n\n257\n00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:47.955\nAnd we're gonna come down here to my\nslides sort of you can see that, yes,\n\n258\n00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:53.141\nevery slide is going to have that five\nseconds and I think I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n259\n00:14:53.141 --> 00:14:58.199\nput a transition so is just not like\na hard cut in between each slide or image.\n\n260\n00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:01.230\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo that morph, I like that one.\n\n261\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.290\nWe'll apply to all slides.\n\n262\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.930\nThen if I start my show,\nit will go ahead and play.\n\n263\n00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.122\nBefore I start, think about if you\nwanted to have that slide show\n\n264\n00:15:11.122 --> 00:15:13.898\njust keep on repeating cuz\nmaybe you have 50 slides and\n\n265\n00:15:13.898 --> 00:15:17.049\nyou always just want to have it\nkeep playing in the background.\n\n266\n00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:21.623\nYou can go to the setup slide show and\nif you use the browse that kiosk the full\n\n267\n00:15:21.623 --> 00:15:26.062\nscreen, that's just going to keep on\nlooping until you tell it to stop.\n\n268\n00:15:26.062 --> 00:15:30.176\nSo, just wanted to, I've pointed\nthat out in a few other episodes but\n\n269\n00:15:30.176 --> 00:15:34.780\nI wanted to point that out because it is\nsomething that most people would want in\n\n270\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.170\nthis type of presentation.\n\n271\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.362\nSo, if I started from the beginning.\n\n272\n00:15:39.362 --> 00:15:41.911\n[MUSIC]\n\n273\n00:15:41.911 --> 00:15:45.187\nThere's my sound.\n\n274\n00:15:45.187 --> 00:15:50.050\nAnd the sound is going to play across\nall my slides as each slide comes in,\n\n275\n00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.642\nand I feel like I wanna talk like this.\n\n276\n00:15:52.642 --> 00:15:56.329\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because the music is so soothing.\n\n277\n00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:59.333\nThere's the beach, and\nwe can keep on going.\n\n278\n00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:04.429\nNow if I had 50 slides You could\nkeep on going, I only have six, so\n\n279\n00:16:04.429 --> 00:16:10.638\nwe can watch all of these as I go through\nthe different places, this is Sarasota.\n\n280\n00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:12.038\n[LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:16.561\n[MUSIC]\n\n282\n00:16:16.561 --> 00:16:18.063\nThat's Chicago.\n\n283\n00:16:18.063 --> 00:16:18.634\n&gt;&gt; Nice\n\n284\n00:16:18.634 --> 00:16:21.252\n[MUSIC]\n\n285\n00:16:21.252 --> 00:16:22.810\n&gt;&gt; I'm just trying to get\nto the end of the show.\n\n286\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.398\nSo now you can see that I'm\nright back to the beginning.\n\n287\n00:16:26.398 --> 00:16:32.130\nWe see how wherever it was in that song,\nsince I told it to loop back,\n\n288\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.920\nof how I told it to set the show\nup of browse at a kiosk.\n\n289\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.760\nWhich just means play it full screen,\n\n290\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.190\nthere was that kind of stop\nbetween where the song stopped.\n\n291\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.380\nAnd then I told it to go to\nthe beginning and then it kept on, so\n\n292\n00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.150\nyou do have to think\nabout that transition.\n\n293\n00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.450\nAnd that's where how long do I have?\n\n294\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:49.640\nHow long is my file?\n\n295\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.390\nHow long is my sound?\n\n296\n00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.970\nAnd so you can get a little\ncreative with that one, so.\n\n297\n00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.270\nSo that's how you could play\nyour slide show with music.\n\n298\n00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.340\nThere was another part, since we're\ntalking about delivering our show,\n\n299\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.720\nthat I wanted to throw in this\nepisode because it does require or\n\n300\n00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.330\ncan include the recording of your sound.\n\n301\n00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.300\nAnd that is narrating your presentation,\nand\n\n302\n00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.620\nhow to record you talking\nthrough your presentation.\n\n303\n00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:24.100\nCuz maybe, I know that one way that this\nis used is with a former professor that I\n\n304\n00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.160\nused to work with, that he would record\nall of his lectures in PowerPoint.\n\n305\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.640\nSo, he has all of his slides and all of\nhis lecture notes, and he would just run\n\n306\n00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.360\nthe show, and just talk over the slides as\nhe would be giving his lecture in person.\n\n307\n00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.740\nBut he was,\nmaybe he had to go on vacation and\n\n308\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.800\nhe wanted to be able to give the lecture\nto his students, and not be in person.\n\n309\n00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.920\nSo this could be a great example\nof why you would want to do that.\n\n310\n00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.560\nI am going to get the presentation\nthat I want to demonstrate this\n\n311\n00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.290\nin my PowerPoint advanced folder.\n\n312\n00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.288\nAnd we are gonna go to record slide show.\n\n313\n00:18:05.527 --> 00:18:07.390\nAnd let's try it again.\n\n314\n00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.675\n[LAUGH] I think I just might've\nopened it a couple times, nope.\n\n315\n00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:15.304\nI had other files that was I was\ngetting kind of confused there.\n\n316\n00:18:15.304 --> 00:18:19.939\nHere we go, so we have our cats and\nwe have our slides, and\n\n317\n00:18:19.939 --> 00:18:22.751\nI want to record my presentation.\n\n318\n00:18:22.751 --> 00:18:27.953\nI go over to my slide show and I can\nRecord Slide Show from the beginning or\n\n319\n00:18:27.953 --> 00:18:30.570\nthe current slide if you wanted to.\n\n320\n00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.428\nAnd as soon as I click on this, and it's\ngoing to go in presentation mode but that\n\n321\n00:18:35.428 --> 00:18:40.376\ndoes not mean that this is how it's going\nto be displayed when you're finished.\n\n322\n00:18:40.376 --> 00:18:43.591\nThis is just thinking about, you're\nrecording it and so it's trying to give\n\n323\n00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:46.508\nyou all the things that you need to\nknow about what slide is coming, and\n\n324\n00:18:46.508 --> 00:18:47.650\nyour speaker notes.\n\n325\n00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.000\nSo it's going to help you as\nyou narrate your presentation.\n\n326\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.980\nSo you're gonna go ahead and click the\nstart recording, welcome to the cat show.\n\n327\n00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.810\nThis is all about Fuego and Bishop.\n\n328\n00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.653\nThese are brothers, they love each other,\neven though they sometimes like to fight.\n\n329\n00:19:05.026 --> 00:19:08.390\nFuego likes to sit in his tree and\nwave to all the neighbors.\n\n330\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.776\nBishop likes to play in his cat tree and\nhave fun.\n\n331\n00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:17.185\n[LAUGH] You might wanna rehearse\nwhat you wanna say before you start.\n\n332\n00:19:17.185 --> 00:19:23.100\n[LAUGH] And then thank you so\nmuch for attending this presentation.\n\n333\n00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:28.802\nAnd you stop, and then you end the show,\nand then you end the show.\n\n334\n00:19:28.802 --> 00:19:29.687\n[LAUGH].\n\n335\n00:19:29.687 --> 00:19:33.440\nAnd so, it recorded all of\nwhat I wanted it to have.\n\n336\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.740\nIf I go to the slide sorter view, you see\nthat the amount of time that I spent on\n\n337\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.450\neach slide is remembered here.\n\n338\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:47.000\nAnd all of that narration that I had\nrecorded, that's in the slides as well.\n\n339\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.780\nAnd you can see here on slide one,\n\n340\n00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.460\nif I double-click it,\nthere is my recorded narration.\n\n341\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:57.120\nThat is going to be played\nacross all of the slides and so\n\n342\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.600\nit knows to remember\nall of this narration.\n\n343\n00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.160\nIt's actually not playing across\nthe background it's not really playing in\n\n344\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.147\nthe background it's remembering\nthe audio that you recorded per slide.\n\n345\n00:20:08.147 --> 00:20:08.961\n&gt;&gt; For each one.\n\n346\n00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:13.212\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so yes let me clarify that part,\nso if I play this presentation from\n\n347\n00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:19.901\nthe beginning, Let's go.\n\n348\n00:20:19.901 --> 00:20:25.395\nThese are brothers, they love each other\neven though they sometimes like to fight.\n\n349\n00:20:25.395 --> 00:20:29.230\nFuego likes to sit in his tree and\nwave to all the neighbors.\n\n350\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:33.534\n&gt;&gt; And so you can see it's going to\nremember all of the audio that I recorded\n\n351\n00:20:33.534 --> 00:20:36.284\ndirectly into my PowerPoint presentation.\n\n352\n00:20:36.284 --> 00:20:37.084\nWhat if you didn't like that?\n\n353\n00:20:37.084 --> 00:20:40.199\nMaybe you're like [SOUND] I don't,\nI'm not sure if that works very well.\n\n354\n00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:42.930\nHow can I get rid of all that and\nstart over?\n\n355\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.013\nBack in that record slide show\nyou can clear the timings.\n\n356\n00:20:47.013 --> 00:20:50.774\nNotice that the timings and narration\nare separate because maybe you liked\n\n357\n00:20:50.774 --> 00:20:54.009\nthe narration but you needed to\nchange the timing or vice versa.\n\n358\n00:20:54.009 --> 00:20:58.663\nHonestly to me if you're recording\nthe show I'd probably wanna go ahead and\n\n359\n00:20:58.663 --> 00:21:02.310\ncreate both, but you do have to do one and\nthen do the other.\n\n360\n00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.643\nSo it's not just an all or\nnothing you have to do it twice if\n\n361\n00:21:05.643 --> 00:21:09.820\nyou want to get rid of everything on\nall the slides or the current slide.\n\n362\n00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.931\nSo you can kind of pick and choose\nhow you can clear all of that out and\n\n363\n00:21:14.931 --> 00:21:16.938\nthen you could go ahead and\n\n364\n00:21:16.938 --> 00:21:21.700\nrecord your new narration that\nyou wanted to put on your show.\n\n365\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, great stuff Vonne,\n\n366\n00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.990\nanytihng else you wanna throw in\nthere before we wrap this one up?\n\n367\n00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.910\n&gt;&gt; Actually there is,\n\n368\n00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:31.240\nit's not necessary recording directly\ninto the presentation like we've covered.\n\n369\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.610\n&gt;&gt; It is, once you're done,\nwhat do I do with it?\n\n370\n00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.500\nFor example,\nthe professor that was using his lectures,\n\n371\n00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.560\nmaybe he wanted to record it,\nand then upload that to YouTube.\n\n372\n00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.151\nSo and then be able to distribute the\nYouTube link to all of his students to be\n\n373\n00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:47.880\nable to watch his lectures.\n\n374\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.430\nYou can create any of\nyour presentations as\n\n375\n00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:56.115\na video itself you can make\nan mp4 out of the presentation.\n\n376\n00:21:56.115 --> 00:21:59.960\nSo think if we just recorded all that\nnarration, I want to distribute it,\n\n377\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.130\nlet's go to the file menu\nyou can go to export and\n\n378\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.120\nyou can create a video\nright from this screen.\n\n379\n00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.440\nAnd you can use what type of\nquality you would like to have,\n\n380\n00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.160\nwhat is the resolution, and\nif you were putting this on the internet,\n\n381\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.660\nyou might wanna choose Internet Quality.\n\n382\n00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.290\nAnd lower quality is going to, well,\nit's gonna have a lower quality, but\n\n383\n00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.300\nthe file size is going to be a lot less.\n\n384\n00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:27.250\nThese do create pretty large files,\nso it's something to consider.\n\n385\n00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.750\nI don't have the option for using record\ntiming cuz I had cleared those out.\n\n386\n00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.780\nBut if you had gone through it,\nyou could say, yes,\n\n387\n00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.910\nI would like to use this, and\ngo ahead and keep everything.\n\n388\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:43.560\nOr maybe you had included the narration,\nbut you only wanted to show\n\n389\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.590\nthe presentations automatically advancing.\n\n390\n00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.640\nThere's different options\nof why you might or\n\n391\n00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.820\nmight not want to include\nrecorded narration.\n\n392\n00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:57.010\nAnd then you go ahead and click Create\nVideo, and it will go ahead and export.\n\n393\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:58.850\nYou can see it exports out as an mp4.\n\n394\n00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.030\nYou click Save,\n\n395\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:05.710\nit will take some time to save down,\ncuz it's gonna be a pretty large file.\n\n396\n00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.580\nSo if it's a long presentation, you might\nwanna just sit and wait for a while.\n\n397\n00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:13.930\nAnd that way, you would have a,\nyour own video of your presentation.\n\n398\n00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.630\n&gt;&gt; All right again great stuff Vonne,\ngreat explanations, great demonstrations\n\n399\n00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.280\non working with audio,\nvideo within our PowerPoint presentation.\n\n400\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.880\nSo we appreciate that, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n401\n00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.930\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n402\n00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:28.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n403\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.159\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n404\n00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:36.380\n[MUSIC]\n\n405\n00:23:36.380 -->

Vonne, and it looks like\nit's picking up your name and\n\n62\n00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:08.570\neverything from maybe who\nyou already logged in as?\n\n63\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is the account.\n\n64\n00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; This is my Office 365 account.\n\n65\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.810\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n66\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.435\n&gt;&gt; So this is why it knows\nthat I am Justin Timberlake.\n\n67\n00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:16.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n68\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.830\nI'm gonna add a comment here.\n\n69\n00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.090\nWhy don't I go ahead and add comments to,\nthere's already a comment.\n\n70\n00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.768\nI forgot about this.\n\n71\n00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.510\n[LAUGH] So I already put this in,\n\n72\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.650\nI must have forgot to delete it before\nI save the file for you guys to see.\n\n73\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.470\nBut that is what I wanted to\nadd was to add another comment.\n\n74\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.640\nWhile I'm here, if I didn't like that,\nI don't want that to comment cuz maybe\n\n75\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.190\nI left it there and\nforgot [LAUGH] like I did and said.\n\n76\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.740\nNope, I changed my mind, you can just\ndelete it from your presentation,\n\n77\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.350\njust as you would any object.\n\n78\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.290\nAnd then it just shows there\nare no comments in this slide.\n\n79\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.390\nSo you can take away a comment\nif you wanted to, but\n\n80\n00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.690\nI'm gonna go ahead and add that in,\nand I'm going to add the same thing.\n\n81\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.890\nPlease pick an image, and you could\ncomment to the [INAUDIBLE] come home.\n\n82\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.610\nAnd anything that you need for any slide,\nyou can put multiple comments in.\n\n83\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.470\nIt doesn't mean that you can\nonly have one comment per slide.\n\n84\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.560\nYou can put in 15 comments and\nyou can attach it to different things.\n\n85\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.010\nBecause maybe you wanted to put\na comment next to a picture,\n\n86\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.100\nor put a comment next to some text.\n\n87\n00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.446\nAnd so you can move these around to\nthe places that you want to kind\n\n88\n00:04:22.446 --> 00:04:27.495\nof notify yourself as to why your\ncommenting on this object or\n\n89\n00:04:27.495 --> 00:04:31.264\nthis thing in the PowerPoint presentation.\n\n90\n00:04:31.264 --> 00:04:35.341\nThere is something else that\nyou can do with marking up or\n\n91\n00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.710\ncommenting on your slides.\n\n92\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.130\nAnd that's something known as inking,\n\n93\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.990\nit's sort of almost like\ntaking your highlighters.\n\n94\n00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.190\nAnd actually highlighting or circling,\nit's like drawing, just as if I was\n\n95\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.870\nan editor for a magazine or\nI was editing somebody's term paper.\n\n96\n00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.890\n&gt;&gt;

And they started using green pen,\n\n103\n00:05:05.947 --> 00:05:08.426\ncuz it's got a different\nconnotation than using the red pen.\n\n104\n00:05:08.426 --> 00:05:08.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n105\n00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.885\n&gt;&gt;

Compare two things?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, [LAUGH].\n\n235\n00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:47.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's\n\n236\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.690\nexactly what we're going to do.\n\n237\n00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.480\nThe key here is that you\nwould want to compare\n\n238\n00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.070\ntwo files that were somewhat the same.\n\n239\n00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.740\nI mean if I compared my images for\nreview and learn PowerPoint,\n\n240\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.360\nthere's gonna be a huge\ndifference right there.\n\n241\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.572\nSo, you always wanna kind of have versions\nof the same PowerPoint presentation,\n\n242\n00:13:06.572 --> 00:13:09.755\notherwise everything's\ngoing to be different.\n\n243\n00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:14.264\nSo I'm going to open up my\noriginal file that I had, and\n\n244\n00:13:14.264 --> 00:13:20.160\nI'm going to put this on my desktop,\nI already had one, that's okay.\n\n245\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.080\nWe'll replace it, that's fine, it's just\na little easier to pull from my hard drive\n\n246\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.348\nor this computer rather than the shared\ndrive, it might take a little bit longer.\n\n247\n00:13:28.348 --> 00:13:32.710\nSo I'm gonna open up the images for\nreview, the one that I had,\n\n248\n00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.108\nI just realized that I replaced that,\nthat's okay, we'll be all right.\n\n249\n00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:39.585\n[LAUGH] I just realized I\nsaved it on my desktop.\n\n250\n00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:40.160\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n251\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.900\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, we're-\n&gt;&gt; It's in your recycle bin.\n\n252\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.250\n&gt;&gt; It is, well, and also,\nI mean it came from this original file.\n\n253\n00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:44.890\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; To begin with.\n\n254\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.260\nSo I think we'll be fine.\n\n255\n00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:51.290\nWe're gonna go over to our review and\nwe're gonna go over to compare.\n\n256\n00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:56.210\nAnd now I'm going to open up that\nfile that Joey had made for me.\n\n257\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.370\nThat I put on my desktop, that I\noverrode the changes from last time,\n\n258\n00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.170\nbut that's okay.\n\n259\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.920\nSo now you can see that it is telling me\n\n260\n00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:08.660\nall the differences between my file and\nthe other file.\n\n261\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.768\nOn the Revisions pane,\nit shows me the changes on each slide.\n\n262\n00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:14.752\nAnd you can see there's these little,\n\n263\n00:14:14.752 --> 00:14:17.990\nalmost like little post-it\nnotes on each one of these.\n\n264\n00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.680\nAnd I can click on them.\n\n265\n00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.429\nAnd you see right here\non the slide properties,\n\n266\n00:14:21.429 --> 00:14:24.110\nit starts to put in these\nlittle check boxes and\n\n267\n00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.868\nlittle boxes around all of the different\nplaces that something has been changed.\n\n268\n00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:32.589\nAnd you see in parenthesis\nit says Joey Fatone,\n\n269\n00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:37.704\nbecause it's showing who did what\nbased on the file properties or\n\n270\n00:14:37.704 --> 00:14:40.970\nthe user input that Joey saved this file.\n\n271\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.780\nThis is a file from Joey.\n\n272\n00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.870\nAnd Justin,\nwho's the one who'd made the comments,\n\n273\n00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.610\nthat's gonna put in the parenthesis\nof what, who did what.\n\n274\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.194\nAnd if I check the box,\nI could see there's a slide layout,\n\n275\n00:14:53.194 --> 00:14:55.509\nthen he went ahead and\nadded a design theme.\n\n276\n00:14:55.509 --> 00:15:00.075\nIf I go over to slide two,\nthere's some other little boxes here.\n\n277\n00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:03.865\nIf I click on here, Joey inserted\na picture I can check that on and\n\n278\n00:15:03.865 --> 00:15:04.675\nsay, well, there you go.\n\n279\n00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:10.747\nSo you can start comparing and contrasting\nreally what has been done by who and\n\n280\n00:15:10.747 --> 00:15:14.727\nyou can say yes, I want this,\nor no, I do not want this.\n\n281\n00:15:14.727 --> 00:15:16.507\nBy checking them on or off or\n\n282\n00:15:16.507 --> 00:15:19.597\neven better what if I checked this\none on to see cuz I didn't see\n\n283\n00:15:19.597 --> 00:15:24.473\nwhat the picture was until I check\nthe box off, but maybe I don't like that.\n\n284\n00:15:24.473 --> 00:15:26.133\nI do not like that picture of that bunny.\n\n285\n00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:27.498\nI actually love this picture.\n\n286\n00:15:27.498 --> 00:15:31.743\n[LAUGH] If I didn't like this picture,\nI could come up here to the Review tab.\n\n287\n00:15:31.743 --> 00:15:36.123\nYou can see I have the Reject or\nAccept and I can say do I want this.\n\n288\n00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:40.293\nWell, maybe I don't want that and\nthen I can reject that change.\n\n289\n00:15:40.293 --> 00:15:43.330\nYou can use the next and the previous.\n\n290\n00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.640\nInstead of physically clicking on them,\nI can say yes, I want this, or no,\n\n291\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.820\nI don't want this.\n\n292\n00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.250\nClick on the boxes, turn them on or off.\n\n293\n00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.200\nIt's pretty much all the same thing, but\nit's really neat how you can say well,\n\n294\n00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.930\nwhat's the next thing that happened?\n\n295\n00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those can be really handy\nwhen you got a long presentation and\n\n296\n00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.410\nyou got one change on slide four, but\nthe next change is until slide 27.\n\n297\n00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:03.182\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n298\n00:16:03.182 --> 00:16:05.640\n&gt;&gt; And you just sit there and go one\nslide at a time looking for changes.\n\n299\n00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.978\nOr you could just day, why don't\nyou jump to the next change for me?\n\n300\n00:16:07.978 --> 00:16:08.648\n&gt;&gt; Great example.\n\n301\n00:16:08.648 --> 00:16:11.416\n[LAUGH] Since I only have five slides,\n\n302\n00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:15.490\nclicking on each slide is\nnot going to be very long.\n\n303\n00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.260\nBut yes,\nmultiple slides would be really great.\n\n304\n00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.759\nSo what did Joey do, he went ahead or\nthat was actually from the collection that\n\n305\n00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:26.800\nl have before that it's associated with\nJoey even though really Justin did it.\n\n306\n00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.350\nAnd then you can see that he deleted\nthis one and inserted that text,\n\n307\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:37.420\nl can go through each one and check all\nthese boxes off to see who did what, when.\n\n308\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.660\nAnd it's really nice to be able to see and\n\n309\n00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:46.130\ncompare the different versions of my\nslides, and then know what's going on.\n\n310\n00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:51.330\nAnd I still have control of whether\nI want to keep his changes or\n\n311\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.280\nnot keep his changes,\nreject those changes.\n\n312\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.360\nAnd you can see that the little box on the\nslide of where he deleted that slide and\n\n313\n00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.170\neverything like that.\n\n314\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:16:59.930\nI love this feature.\n\n315\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.110\nI think it's really, really handy.\n\n316\n00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.120\nBecause there's a lot of times\nwhere I don't know what you did.\n\n317\n00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:09.110\nAnd if you don't comment every single\nthing that you, I'm talking to you, Joey.\n\n318\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.860\n&gt;&gt; Joey, okay.\n\n319\n00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Joey didn't tell me exactly\n\n320\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.265\nwhat he did.\n\n321\n00:17:12.265 --> 00:17:13.925\nAt least I have that compare option.\n\n322\n00:17:13.925 --> 00:17:15.101\nAnd then I can choose.\n\n323\n00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:18.110\nAnd I think it's a really great\nfeature for collaborating.\n\n324\n00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:22.720\nThe old school way, and a little bit more\nmanual of comparing your results and\n\n325\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.570\nbeing able to accept or reject.\n\n326\n00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:25.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n327\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.270\nGreat look there at collaboration.\n\n328\n00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.590\nReally showing us what we\ncan do with PowerPoint.\n\n329\n00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.850\nBecause as you said at the beginning,\n\n330\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.135\na lot of times we might\nbe working on our own.\n\n331\n00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:35.925\nBut there's many times that we're\ngonna be working with colleagues,\n\n332\n00:17:35.925 --> 00:17:37.395\nbusiness partners, what have you.\n\n333\n00:17:37.395 --> 00:17:41.525\nTrying to come to a common goal or\nworking on the same presentation.\n\n334\n00:17:41.525 --> 00:17:43.675\nSo now we know how we can\nsend comments back and\n\n335\n00:17:43.675 --> 00:17:46.270\nforth as we progress through our project.\n\n336\n00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:50.540\nAnd then we can even compare two different\nversions of a slide show to make sure we\n\n337\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.420\ndidn't miss anything.\n\n338\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.350\nOr look for things that were changed\nthat maybe weren't commented, and\n\n339\n00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.280\nwe might not have noticed.\n\n340\n00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.680\nSo we thank you for that Vonne.\n\n341\n00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.260\nFantastic stuff there.\n\n342\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.760\nAll right, hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching this one.\n\n343\n00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.150\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Joey Fatone.\n\n344\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.113\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Timberlake.\n\n345\n00:18:06.113 --> 00:18:07.868\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n346\n00:18:07.868 --> 00:18:10.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n347\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:16.520\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.149\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and today we\nare doing our advanced PowerPoint 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:24.259\nIn this episode we're gonna be learning\nhow to collaborate In the cloud.\n\n8\n00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.068\nNow, I brought my gear, I was ready\nto jump in our hot air balloon, but\n\n9\n00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:30.210\nthose were evidently the wrong cloud.\n\n10\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.550\nSo here to help us and explain what the\nheck it means to collaborate in the cloud\n\n11\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.120\nis Ms Von Smith, welcome back Von.\n\n12\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.437\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nI'm glad you're geared up and ready to go.\n\n13\n00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was excited too.\n\n14\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.181\n&gt;&gt; Well don't worry,\nwe'll be using you in this whole episode.\n\n15\n00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:42.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to be\n\n16\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.760\ncollaborating with you.\n\n17\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.267\nWe're gonna float around in PowerPoint and\nsee what we can do together.\n\n18\n00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:51.772\nSo, and that's the whole point of this\nepisode is to show how we can collaborate\n\n19\n00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:53.100\nin real time.\n\n20\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.710\nLet's say I have somebody that I'm working\non a PowerPoint presentation with and\n\n21\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.660\ntheir in a satellite office in another\ncity, but we both have Office 365,\n\n22\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.820\nwe both have PowerPoint.\n\n23\n00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.240\nAnd I want to be able to work with them,\n\n24\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.710\nlike they were sitting\nin the room next to me.\n\n25\n00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.080\nTalking about our slides,\nand editing things together.\n\n26\n00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.085\nAnd we can do that, because Microsoft\nhas really kind of amped up their.\n\n27\n00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:22.445\nCollaborating in that real time through\nthe use of their One Drive technology or\n\n28\n00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:23.645\nservice.\n\n29\n00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:26.193\nThere's also you have other things,\nyou have Skype and everything.\n\n30\n00:01:26.193 --> 00:01:30.330\nBut we're gonna be focusing specifically\non working within the application\n\n31\n00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.220\nthrough OneDrive.\n\n32\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.801\nAnd so\nOneDrive is that kinda ethereal [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:36.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.529\n&gt;&gt; Cloud-based storage device, or\n\n35\n00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:39.677\nstorage system,\n\n36\n00:01:39.677 --> 00:01:44.930\nthat we can use to be able to put things\nup in there into that storage section.\n\n37\n00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.030\nAnd then we can share it\nout with other users and\n\n38\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.380\nthat's exactly what we're going to do.\n\n39\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.050\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, all right,\nhow do we get started?\n\n40\n00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.000\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're gonna go ahead and\ntake off by jumping into PowerPoint,\n\n41\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.400\njump into our little basket,\nright, in out hot air balloon.\n\n42\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.690\nAnd we're going to open up a file\nthat I have on my desktop, right now.\n\n43\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.740\nThis is on my local computer.\n\n44\n00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.160\nSo now, what I need to do is I need to\ngo ahead and get this into my OneDrive\n\n45\n00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.756\naccount and then from there I'll be\nable to go ahead and do my sharing out.\n\n46\n00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:18.960\nBut I would like to just do\na small side not right now.\n\n47\n00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.250\nIs that I am using my OneDrive for\nbusiness.\n\n48\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.200\nOn a Windows operating machine, you do\nhave, installed with the operating system,\n\n49\n00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.940\nyou have the OneDrive account, your\npersonal account that you could use for\n\n50\n00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.830\nthat cloud storage.\n\n51\n00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.720\nAnd so, I just wanna give you\na quick heads-up on that.\n\n52\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.800\nI'm just gonna pull up\nmy Start Menu on there.\n\n53\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.020\nYou can see there's OneDrive.\n\n54\n00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.530\nBut then there's OneDrive for\nBusiness, and\n\n55\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.670\nthat's the one that I'm\nputting my files up into.\n\n56\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.150\nSo we're going to do that,\nwe can do it in two ways.\n\n57\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.940\nYou can go ahead and do a File Save As,\nand then change your location,\n\n58\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.010\nto go ahead and put it in OneDrive.\n\n59\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.190\nThat will go ahead and\nput it there just fine.\n\n60\n00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.370\nYou could also go into\nthe Share section here, and\n\n61\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.680\nit's saying,\nI do want to share it with people.\n\n62\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.250\nAnd it's giving me a quick little overview\nof we're gonna save it to OneDrive and\n\n63\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.100\nthen I'll go ahead and\nhelp you share out your document.\n\n64\n00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.400\nAnd it's gonna pull up our Share task\npane that we'll see in a second.\n\n65\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.430\nBut you could go either way,\nso let's go here.\n\n66\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.740\nAnd the funny thing is\nonce you go ahead and\n\n67\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.870\nsay, yeah go ahead and save it to the\ncloud it takes you right back to Save As.\n\n68\n00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you're kinda going around and\n\n69\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.880\nI would like to make sure that I'm in my\nOneDrive account that I have connected to.\n\n70\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.370\nI'm going to name this formatting\nslides and themes are share.\n\n71\n00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.350\nTo clarify that this is going up into my\nshared account or my OneDrive account.\n\n72\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.130\nGoing ahead and\nit's getting everything ready for me.\n\n73\n00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.460\nAnd now since I had gone\nthrough that share with people,\n\n74\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.900\nit's kinda set me back at this point.\n\n75\n00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.510\nAnd says, well now I'm gonna go ahead and\nhelp you get those sharing links and\n\n76\n00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.350\nsend invitations to people\nthat you want to include.\n\n77\n00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.914\nAnd so it brings up that Share pane\nover there on the right hand side.\n\n78\n00:03:58.914 --> 00:04:02.727\nBut if you had gone by that just Save As\nand didn't go through that Save,\n\n79\n00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:06.224\nit's right up here on the top above\na ribbon of where I can say yep,\n\n80\n00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:10.370\nI wanna go ahead and share,\nit brings that right up for you.\n\n81\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.560\nNow, there's a couple ways\nwe could go ahead and\n\n82\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.850\ninvite people in, right from PowerPoint.\n\n83\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.870\nWe can email this presentation to\npeople within our global address list.\n\n84\n00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.650\nAnd this is all connected\nto our Outlook account.\n\n85\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.700\nSo you will you have to have Outlook setup\n\n86\n00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.890\nto do this specific step\nthat I'm going to show you.\n\n87\n00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.650\nBut if you don't use Outlook.\n\n88\n00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.170\nWhat if I'm using Gmail or some other type\nof Cloud based Internets or not internet,\n\n89\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.930\nemail service you could go ahead and get a\nshareable link that you could go ahead and\n\n90\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.250\nfind and get that link into your Gmail.\n\n91\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.570\nI will say right now,\nit's like well why isn't this showing?\n\n92\n00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.070\nIt will, I found that if it doesn't pop up\nautomatically with a get shareable link,\n\n93\n00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.830\nwhich it will, I found sometimes if I\nclose PowerPoint and it opens file up,\n\n94\n00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.380\nit kind of resets itself.\n\n95\n00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.030\nSo, we'll get back to that get\nsharable link in just a second.\n\n96\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.980\nBut now what we're going to is we're\ngoing to invite other people to\n\n97\n00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.080\nour PowerPoint party.\n\n98\n00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.850\nWe're going to invite Lance into this.\n\n99\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.468\nAnd I will get to you as well, Mike.\n\n100\n00:05:12.468 --> 00:05:13.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be joining in.\n\n101\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.790\nIt's just,\nI haven't sent your invitation yet, so.\n\n102\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.002\nWe're going to go ahead and\nclick on this, and\n\n103\n00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:22.817\nit is going to connect to my global\naddress list automatically, from Outlook.\n\n104\n00:05:22.817 --> 00:05:26.867\nBut if I had shared other contacts\nin there, I could go ahead and\n\n105\n00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:28.650\naccess it from this place.\n\n106\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.685\nWell we're gonna go ahead and\ngrab Lance and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n107\n00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:34.576\nsay let's send this and\nit's all right from within PowerPoint.\n\n108\n00:05:34.576 --> 00:05:38.864\nI don't have to close PowerPoint, go into\nOutlook, attach the file, get the link and\n\n109\n00:05:38.864 --> 00:05:39.590\neverything.\n\n110\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.985\nI can just do it all from within this\napplication, which is very handy and just.\n\n111\n00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:45.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Makes it a little bit more efficient.\n\n112\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And I am going to allow him to edit.\n\n113\n00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.668\nI could send this as a view only.\n\n114\n00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:54.131\nBecause I don't want him to\nactually change anything, but\n\n115\n00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:57.535\nI want his opinion on what this\nlooks like but don't edit.\n\n116\n00:05:57.535 --> 00:06:00.400\nI am going to edit, and\nI gonna just make a little note.\n\n117\n00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.342\nI could always go ahead and\nsay please look at slide six,\n\n118\n00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:06.987\nyou can give any instructions right\nhere from then the style outbox.\n\n119\n00:06:06.987 --> 00:06:09.121\nAnd then I click Share and\nthen it's going to,\n\n120\n00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:12.790\nyou can see it's giving a little warning,\nnot necessarily a warning it's just\n\n121\n00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.856\ntelling that this is what it's doing and\nit's going to go ahead and\n\n122\n00:06:15.856 --> 00:06:19.320\nsend that email right from my Outlook\naccount without even opening it.\n\n123\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, nice.\n\n124\n00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.570\n&gt;&gt; Which is wonderful.\n\n125\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.770\nSo, let's go ahead and see what lands\nis gonna see on that receiving end.\n\n126\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.010\nNow I'm going to just magically poof,\nhere I am, Lance [LAUGH] And\n\n127\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.750\nI'm in LANCE's computer and I'm gonna go\nahead and open up my Outlook as LANCE.\n\n128\n00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.340\nAnd I will see an email that's\ngoing to show that, hey guess what,\n\n129\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.390\nJoey has shared a file with you\nto be able to start editing.\n\n130\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.960\nSo Joey Fatone has sent me a file\ncalled Formatting Slides and Themes.\n\n131\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.350\nI can go ahead and click on that.\n\n132\n00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.550\nAnd it is going to go ahead and redirect\nme to my Office 365 log in prompt.\n\n133\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.900\nBecause I'm an Office 365 user and I have\nPowerPoint, little side note here as well,\n\n134\n00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.000\nyou can send this to people\nwithout a Microsoft account.\n\n135\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.210\nAnd that is how the OneDrive is set up.\n\n136\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.730\nBut there might be some type of prompt\nwhere it might ask them to sign in,\n\n137\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.790\nbut have them maybe look for\n\n138\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.110\nsomething that you wanna continue\nwithout a Microsoft account.\n\n139\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.830\nSo just kind of a little sidenote on that,\nthat is the whole capability of OneNote.\n\n140\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.120\nNot one note, what is this?\n\n141\n00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.960\n&gt;&gt; OneDrive.\n&gt;&gt; OneDrive,\n\n142\n00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.840\nthere is a product\ncalled OneNote-- [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Another good product.\n\n144\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's pretty awesome, but just\nwant to kind of clarify that with this so\n\n145\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.590\nlet's go ahead and see if I can type in\nLance's complex password on the first try.\n\n146\n00:07:45.805 --> 00:07:54.064\nOkay, slow down let me have to actually\nthink about it in my head, of.\n\n147\n00:07:56.486 --> 00:07:59.238\n&gt;&gt; All kinds of complex characters in\nthere, keeping it safe and secure.\n\n148\n00:07:59.238 --> 00:08:02.897\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\ncomplex passwords is the way to go.\n\n149\n00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:05.286\nBut you have to think about\nit [LAUGH] when you type it.\n\n150\n00:08:05.286 --> 00:08:09.980\nSo here I am, and it's opening\nup as lens in PowerPoint Online.\n\n151\n00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.440\nAnd so I could go ahead and use some of\nthe capabilities of PowerPoint Online.\n\n152\n00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.490\nCuz let's say he doesn't want\nto edit in PowerPoint, or\n\n153\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.940\nmaybe he doesn't even have PowerPoint\ninstalled locally on his computer.\n\n154\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.810\nAnd he always uses PowerPoint through\nthe online services he has an account.\n\n155\n00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.578\nSo you could do it either way.\n\n156\n00:08:27.578 --> 00:08:31.536\nNow notice right here that he can go\nahead and edit within the browser or\n\n157\n00:08:31.536 --> 00:08:33.427\ngo ahead and edit in PowerPoint.\n\n158\n00:08:33.427 --> 00:08:36.451\nAnd a few other things that they could\ndo is they could go ahead and share or\n\n159\n00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:37.840\nprint and things like that.\n\n160\n00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that could be really handy if I'm\ntraveling and I've got a loaner laptop or\n\n161\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.020\nI'm in some kinda business office at\nthe hotel where I don't have PowerPoint,\n\n162\n00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.430\nbut I really need to help him out,\nJoey's asking me for the help.\n\n163\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.740\nI can do it right there in the browser.\n\n164\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.525\nSo anywhere I that I have internet access.\n\n165\n00:08:51.525 --> 00:08:52.060\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n166\n00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.650\nAnd that's the beauty of the Office 365\naccounts is that you can it does give you\n\n167\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.750\nthe use of anywhere.\n\n168\n00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.730\nAs long you have an internet connection,\nyou can use the services.\n\n169\n00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:06.690\nThe share with people, think about\nlike I as Joey sent this to Lance.\n\n170\n00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.675\nAnd now Lance could share\nit with other people?\n\n171\n00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:13.490\nThere's a setting that you\ncan control with how you can\n\n172\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.970\nshare files from your OneDrive account.\n\n173\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.070\nAnd I'll give you like a quick overview\non that at the end of the episode,\n\n174\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.520\nso you can see that you can control\nit if you say like, all right,\n\n175\n00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.920\nI'm giving it to you, Lance, but I don't\nwant you to share it with anybody else.\n\n176\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.930\nWe're gonna go ahead and edit in, let's go\nahead and edit it in PowerPoint to start.\n\n177\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.920\nAnd you could see that it's\ngoing to give me a warning.\n\n178\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.240\nLike are you sure you know\nwhere this came from?\n\n179\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.460\nIt might have things that are harmful to\nyou but we know Joey, he's a good guy.\n\n180\n00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.420\nHe's okay.\n\n181\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.560\nSo we're gonna click OK and it's gonna\ngo ahead and edit right in PowerPoint.\n\n182\n00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.440\nAnd notice that it's opening\nup PowerPoint for me.\n\n183\n00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.650\nMy browser is still open which\nis going to be something\n\n184\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.850\nwe'll come back to in just a little bit.\n\n185\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.719\nAnd then it's going to open back up and\nnotice as Lance,\n\n186\n00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:00.280\nJoey's here in the party as well,\n\n187\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.970\nbecause we're both connected to\nthis particular file right now,\n\n188\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:10.550\non our own computers but it's kind of like\na V almost, we're going up and then down.\n\n189\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.610\nAnd so we're connected through the cloud.\n\n190\n00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.410\nSo, as Lance, I could go ahead and\nstart editing.\n\n191\n00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.460\nAnd the other thing is,\nI know where Joey is right now,\n\n192\n00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.870\nbecause it's giving me a little icon next\nto the slide that Joey is on slide one.\n\n193\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.110\nAnd if Joey starts moving around,\nthe little icon will move,\n\n194\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.300\nto let me know what Joey\nis doing at that time.\n\n195\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.561\nSo let's go over to slide three, and\nwe'll say, title and content and\n\n196\n00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:38.395\nthe Lance and we can start making\nour edits, we could go ahead and\n\n197\n00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:42.750\nmaybe move some, whoops,\nthat's moving, I need to go over here.\n\n198\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.932\n[LAUGH] I need to move the squares\naround cuz we've done that,\n\n199\n00:10:46.932 --> 00:10:53.560\nI can also make some comments, I could go\nahead and insert a comment and say hello.\n\n200\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.610\nAnd we could be talking through the\ncomments, through the cloud, and really\n\n201\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:04.060\nstart to be able to do that collaboration,\nwhich is, I think, pretty awesome.\n\n202\n00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's extremely handy.\n\n203\n00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.930\nSo now instead of sitting there with\na phone on my shoulder while I'm trying to\n\n204\n00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.660\ntype and talking to you and, hey,\ndo you see what I'm doing here?\n\n205\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.076\n&gt;&gt; I've basically got an IM client built\n\n207\n00:11:12.076 --> 00:11:15.111\nright in where we can talk about\nwhat we are doing, fantastic.\n\n208\n00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:15.802\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n209\n00:11:15.802 --> 00:11:18.163\nNow, as lance I will need to go ahead and\n\n210\n00:11:18.163 --> 00:11:21.253\nsave my changes just like if\nI was doing it on my own.\n\n211\n00:11:21.253 --> 00:11:25.901\nI'm like okay let me go ahead and\nmake sure I commit these changes so\n\n212\n00:11:25.901 --> 00:11:27.230\nJoey can see that.\n\n213\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.920\nSo I'm going to switch over to\nmy Joey personality now and\n\n214\n00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.330\nwe're going to be, here I am, here's Joey.\n\n215\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.100\nI do have to as Joey save my\nchanges as well to be able to\n\n216\n00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.540\nbring down those changes that Lance\nhad done down to my computer.\n\n217\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.630\nThere is a setting in some of\nlike the newer installations\n\n218\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.410\nof Office where it doesn't autosave and\nyou can use that option.\n\n219\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.380\nWe'll keep that in the back\nbanner as well and\n\n220\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.746\nwe'll visit that at the end just to\ngive you a little heads up on that.\n\n221\n00:12:00.746 --> 00:12:05.050\nI'm gonna click OK, and now you can\nsee that I've got a comment and\n\n222\n00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.850\nif I click on this it's going\nto open up my comments pane, and\n\n223\n00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.780\nI can see that Lance has said hello.\n\n224\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.340\nAnd I can say hello back, and then it's\ngoing to keep that running commentary like\n\n225\n00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.010\nthat IM client that Mike was talking\nabout right from within PowerPoint.\n\n226\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.520\nAnd then I can come along to\neach one of my slides, and\n\n227\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.730\nI can see that he's moved\nsome of the blocks around.\n\n228\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.750\nAnd that he went ahead and\nhas given his name.\n\n229\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.240\nAnd so we just go ahead and\nstart talking to each other.\n\n230\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.570\nWhat if I'm here on slide five, and\nI'm going to delete this slide.\n\n231\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.540\nAnd I'm going to save my changes.\n\n232\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.410\nAnd I'm going to come back over to Lance.\n\n233\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:44.020\nAnd let's say, at the same time that that\nis happening, Lance is going ahead and\n\n234\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.970\nmaking a comment here that he\nwants to say a new section or,\n\n235\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.203\nwe've made some type of\nchange on this slide and\n\n236\n00:12:52.203 --> 00:12:57.770\nas Lance I save this and it's going\nto bring up this resolved conflict.\n\n237\n00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:02.960\nSo this is something that like if were\nboth doing edits on the same slide,\n\n238\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.850\nwe're not overwriting each other.\n\n239\n00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.330\nWe're like, wait, we're having\n\n240\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.530\na conflict of interest right now because\nwe're both doing the same thing.\n\n241\n00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.050\nSo you can see right here, the changes\nby others, the slide was deleted.\n\n242\n00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.666\nMy change says, new section now,\nthis is where, who wins?\n\n243\n00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:18.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.610\n&gt;&gt; I could be like,\n\n245\n00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.710\nwell, I wanna keep mine.\n\n246\n00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.220\nAnd then, Joey could be like,\nI wanna keep mine.\n\n247\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.690\nSo that's where the collaborating and\nmaybe using those comments along the way.\n\n248\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.060\nLike, I really think we\nshould delete this slide.\n\n249\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.680\nAnd just really kinda just talking it out.\n\n250\n00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.390\nSo we'll say, and also, well Joey's\nthe author and I'm just a contributor,\n\n251\n00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.990\nso I'll go ahead and I'll give this\none to Joey, Joey gets this one.\n\n252\n00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.960\nSo you could go ahead and\ntalk that out and see who\n\n253\n00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.380\nwins NSN, so\nthat resolve conflict is really nice.\n\n254\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.220\nSo we're not stepping\non each other's toes.\n\n255\n00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's how Lance is using\n\n256\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.560\nthe collaboration from within\nPowerPoint the program on his machine.\n\n257\n00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.070\nWe talked about,\nI don't want to leave you out Mike.\n\n258\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.100\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; We said that we would invite you to\n\n259\n00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.720\nthe party.\n\n260\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.830\n&gt;&gt; I was ready to join.\n\n261\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.725\nI have my party heat ready and everything.\n\n262\n00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:12.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n263\n00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.280\n&gt;&gt; So I need to go ahead and get you here.\n\n264\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.340\nEnd of the party but\nI'm not going to email.\n\n265\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.280\nNow I could go ahead and email you right\nfrom here because I know you have an email\n\n266\n00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.210\naddress and I know you could go ahead and\nreceive it.\n\n267\n00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.390\nBut I wanna go ahead and\nget that sharable link.\n\n268\n00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.690\nI haven't gotten it just yet.\n\n269\n00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.580\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna go ahead and save our changes.\n\n270\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.000\nWe'll go ahead and\nrefresh what Lance had done.\n\n271\n00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.980\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\nclose Powerpoint,\n\n272\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.900\ncuz I want to be able to give it a little\nreset, so I can get that sharable link.\n\n273\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.640\nNow, I'm not opening this one,\ncuz that's the one on my desktop.\n\n274\n00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.165\nI have to go back into Powerpoint and\n\n275\n00:14:48.165 --> 00:14:51.960\nbe able to open that file up\nfrom my OneDrive account.\n\n276\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.640\nSo that's one of those things you gotta\nremember, which one am I opening?\n\n277\n00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.928\nYou start editing the one on your desktop,\nit's like, where is everybody?\n\n278\n00:14:57.928 --> 00:14:58.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wrong file.\n\n279\n00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.480\nSo I have over here in my recent\nthat I am using the one on the,\n\n280\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.460\nI can see that it is\nsaved in that location.\n\n281\n00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.680\nSo I know that's the one\nthat I want to get.\n\n282\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.330\nAnd it's opening it up\nfrom the share drive and\n\n283\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.600\nI want to come over here to my\nshare pane and we're connecting.\n\n284\n00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.630\nAnd we're refreshing, and there we go.\n\n285\n00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:26.620\nSee at the very bottom we have get\na sharing link, so if I click on\n\n286\n00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.520\nthat I can go ahead and say now what type\nof link do I want to send to somebody?\n\n287\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.760\nDo I want it to just view only,\nor do I want to edit.\n\n288\n00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.410\nWell, I wanna give you full party rights,\nso\n\n289\n00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.230\nI'll let you go ahead and edit the link.\n\n290\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.621\nAnd so it is going to go ahead and\ncreate that link for me.\n\n291\n00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:48.083\nI could go ahead and click that Copy\nbutton, and I'm going to swipe on over,\n\n292\n00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:50.872\nwhoops, wrong way,\nto my Mac computer here and\n\n293\n00:15:50.872 --> 00:15:55.058\nI already have a chart because Mike and\nI are connected through Skype for\n\n294\n00:15:55.058 --> 00:15:59.346\nBusiness and so that's the way that I\nwant to go ahead and connect to him.\n\n295\n00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:01.690\nSo I will go ahead and\npaste that link and now,\n\n296\n00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.285\nMike is going to be able to get the link\nthat he will be able to click on.\n\n297\n00:16:05.285 --> 00:16:10.168\nGo ahead and sign in with his Microsoft\naccount or his 365 account, and\n\n298\n00:16:10.168 --> 00:16:12.228\nhe will be able to edit as well.\n\n299\n00:16:12.228 --> 00:16:14.070\nSo you can go ahead and do that.\n\n300\n00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.370\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing that now.\n\n301\n00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.810\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n302\n00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.370\nswitch back over here to Joey and\nto Joey's local here.\n\n303\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.944\nAnd in just a little bit,\nwe're going to see Mike pop up over here\n\n304\n00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:29.859\nas a guest contributor once\nhe gets into the slide.\n\n305\n00:16:29.859 --> 00:16:32.214\nLook, there he is.\n\n306\n00:16:32.214 --> 00:16:33.426\nYou're in there twice.\n\n307\n00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:34.096\nWow.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n308\n00:16:34.096 --> 00:16:36.943\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's two Mikes.\n\n309\n00:16:36.943 --> 00:16:37.797\nMike, Mike, Mike, Mike.\n\n310\n00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:40.654\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So all the Mikes are here, so\n\n311\n00:16:40.654 --> 00:16:45.059\nyou could see that he is right here,\nediting along with me.\n\n312\n00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:50.100\nAnd you can see over here that I can\nsee that Lance is on slide three.\n\n313\n00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.930\nI can see that Mike is on slide, wait\nthat's slide four, Mike is on slide three.\n\n314\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.780\nAnd I can basically track\nwhat everybody is doing and\n\n315\n00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.700\nI can have all sorts of people\nto tell me what's going on.\n\n316\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.380\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and save my changes.\n\n317\n00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.414\nCuz I believe that I can hear\nyou clicking over there.\n\n318\n00:17:07.414 --> 00:17:08.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep.\n\n319\n00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.072\nAll right, I've made a few changes.\n\n320\n00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:11.398\nNow let's see if you can find them.\n\n321\n00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:14.581\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm saving and I see them.\n\n322\n00:17:14.581 --> 00:17:16.130\nOkay, so you went with orange.\n\n323\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.167\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n324\n00:17:17.167 --> 00:17:18.786\n&gt;&gt; And you said that PowerPoint rocks,\nawesome.\n\n325\n00:17:18.786 --> 00:17:21.416\nSo I could see that you've\nmade some changes and\n\n326\n00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:25.187\nthis is where you could be inserting\ncomments as well and we can use.\n\n327\n00:17:25.187 --> 00:17:28.142\nAnd that's kinda like\nestablishing a workflow or\n\n328\n00:17:28.142 --> 00:17:30.755\nlike how we're going\nto talk to each other.\n\n329\n00:17:30.755 --> 00:17:35.809\nLike, okay, I really want us to use\ncomments to communicate and everything.\n\n330\n00:17:35.809 --> 00:17:39.248\nYou can see that while he's changing,\nthere's parts that are highlighting.\n\n331\n00:17:39.248 --> 00:17:43.132\nLike it's highlighting right here that\nsomebody's doing something over here and\n\n332\n00:17:43.132 --> 00:17:44.638\na guest contributor is on this.\n\n333\n00:17:44.638 --> 00:17:49.935\nSo you could see that where people are at,\nnot just by on what the slide is,\n\n334\n00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:54.390\nbut what area they're in on the slide,\nwhich we really need.\n\n335\n00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.975\nI do wanna switch over to Lance again, for\njust a second because let's go ahead and\n\n336\n00:17:58.975 --> 00:18:01.514\nsee that Lance can see\neverybody that's in.\n\n337\n00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:04.649\nHere we've got our Mike and Mike in here.\n\n338\n00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:09.429\n[LAUGH] I'm going to go ahead and\nclose out my changes to this, but\n\n339\n00:18:09.429 --> 00:18:13.955\nremember, I'm still in the browser\nfrom my Lance account.\n\n340\n00:18:13.955 --> 00:18:18.450\nAnd the neat thing is that I could go\nahead and continue to edit online.\n\n341\n00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.990\nLet's just say for some reason, I didn't\nwant to be in the product anymore.\n\n342\n00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.941\nAnd I could go ahead and continue and\n\n343\n00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:26.550\nI can still see all\nthe changes that are in here.\n\n344\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.760\nI can see that there are two\nother people that are talking.\n\n345\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.090\nAnd the other neat thing\nis if I'm using online,\n\n346\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:38.620\nis I can use the chat function over here,\nthere we go.\n\n347\n00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:42.237\nIt just had to take him a second\nto go ahead and join in.\n\n348\n00:18:42.237 --> 00:18:45.323\nAnd then if I'm editing\nin the PowerPoint online,\n\n349\n00:18:45.323 --> 00:18:48.356\nwe could chat this way\ninstead of doing comments.\n\n350\n00:18:48.356 --> 00:18:50.120\nSo I could say like, hello.\n\n351\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:55.745\nAnd I can say, and I can see right there\nthat GC, that guest contributor, as Mike.\n\n352\n00:18:55.745 --> 00:18:58.940\nHe's talking to me as well and so\nwe could always communicate this way.\n\n353\n00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:03.700\nSo that might be another advantage or\njust a different way of doing things.\n\n354\n00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.220\nIf you wanted to kinda have\nthis type of IM'ing and\n\n355\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.180\ncommunication, rather than through\nthe actual comments in the slides.\n\n356\n00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.480\nBut you see that the chat won't\nbe saved when you close a file.\n\n357\n00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.782\nIt's kind of like a one time, like\na session variable, like we're just doing\n\n358\n00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:22.964\nit for this particular session that\nwe're talking online with each other.\n\n359\n00:19:22.964 --> 00:19:25.341\nAnd so I wanted to point that part out.\n\n360\n00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:29.602\nSo you can see that there's a lot of\nreally neat things that we could do\n\n361\n00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:34.470\nas a group to collaborate together when\nusing our PowerPoint presentations.\n\n362\n00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.935\nBut I would like to go ahead and\ntalk a little bit about me back as Joey,\n\n363\n00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:43.295\nas the owner of this document.\n\n364\n00:19:43.295 --> 00:19:45.283\nWhat if I, I'm done.\n\n365\n00:19:45.283 --> 00:19:46.875\nLike I don't need your\ncontributions anymore.\n\n366\n00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:47.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n367\n00:19:47.892 --> 00:19:50.750\nI don't want you to be able to\ndo any of the changes anymore.\n\n368\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.334\nAnd maybe it's like, okay,\nthank you so much Lance, but\n\n369\n00:19:54.334 --> 00:19:56.172\nI'm done with your sharing.\n\n370\n00:19:56.172 --> 00:20:00.059\nI want to stop sharing this\nfile with you because maybe,\n\n371\n00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:03.212\nwe're finished, we finished our product.\n\n372\n00:20:03.212 --> 00:20:05.794\nSo you don't kinda wanna\nleave any loose ends.\n\n373\n00:20:05.794 --> 00:20:08.033\n&gt;&gt; Or you didn't like my style decisions.\n\n374\n00:20:08.033 --> 00:20:09.018\nIt's really what it is.\n\n375\n00:20:09.018 --> 00:20:12.054\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat probably would be the case [LAUGH].\n\n376\n00:20:12.054 --> 00:20:14.685\nI've seen them [LAUGH].\n\n377\n00:20:14.685 --> 00:20:19.960\nSo I wanted to go ahead and show you that,\nlet's jump back over to Joey.\n\n378\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.552\nAnd I'm going to say, yes,\n\n379\n00:20:22.552 --> 00:20:28.507\njust to make that last change as\nthe owner, for whatever reason.\n\n380\n00:20:28.507 --> 00:20:29.874\nAnd Mike.\n\n381\n00:20:29.874 --> 00:20:30.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.564\n&gt;&gt; So I can see that other change that\n\n383\n00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:33.321\nMike had done.\n\n384\n00:20:33.321 --> 00:20:35.813\nAnd you can see that when it\nwas highlighted in that box,\n\n385\n00:20:35.813 --> 00:20:37.254\nthat you were doing something.\n\n386\n00:20:37.254 --> 00:20:39.417\nSo I'm going to close PowerPoint.\n\n387\n00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:41.369\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n388\n00:20:41.369 --> 00:20:47.405\nget into my Office online account because\nI need to get into my OneDrive account,\n\n389\n00:20:47.405 --> 00:20:52.231\nand say, all right,\nI wanna cut off the sharing capabilities.\n\n390\n00:20:52.231 --> 00:20:58.690\nSo, as the owner of this document,\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign in as Joey.\n\n391\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.340\nHere are all the different\nthings that Joey has access to.\n\n392\n00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.300\nI'm going to click on OneDrive.\n\n393\n00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.968\nAnd then from here,\nit's pulling itself up.\n\n394\n00:21:12.233 --> 00:21:13.307\nAll right, so\n\n395\n00:21:13.307 --> 00:21:18.954\nhere's my file that does show that I\nhave shared this out with some people.\n\n396\n00:21:18.954 --> 00:21:22.040\nIf I click on the shared over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n397\n00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.471\nIt's gonna bring up my pane, to say,\nthese are the people that I have access.\n\n398\n00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:29.504\nAnd this is always a good thing to go\nback to because maybe I shared out with\n\n399\n00:21:29.504 --> 00:21:32.470\nsomebody that I didn't even realize\nthat I gave them that share link.\n\n400\n00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.550\nCuz maybe they never contributed or did\nanything, but I wanna just kinda tie this\n\n401\n00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.820\nup and I wanna change the permissions\nthat people have access to.\n\n402\n00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.858\nSo I'm gonna click on change permissions,\nand that link,\n\n403\n00:21:43.858 --> 00:21:47.584\nthis is a link that anyone can get cuz\nmaybe Mike gave it to somebody else.\n\n404\n00:21:47.584 --> 00:21:51.679\nAnd I wouldn't even know that because\nit is, it's like an open channel,\n\n405\n00:21:51.679 --> 00:21:52.677\nif you wanna say.\n\n406\n00:21:52.677 --> 00:21:56.941\nSo I'm gonna cut off that open channel and\nI can just go ahead and disable this link.\n\n407\n00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.671\nAnd I'm going to remove the link and\nthat way,\n\n408\n00:21:59.671 --> 00:22:03.395\nif Mike clicked on that link or\nanybody else that had that link.\n\n409\n00:22:03.395 --> 00:22:05.941\nThey would not be able\nto access this file,\n\n410\n00:22:05.941 --> 00:22:10.630\nthey're just gonna get like a warning,\nlike access denied or a 404 error.\n\n411\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.485\nSome type of error to where it's saying,\nno, we can't go in there.\n\n412\n00:22:14.485 --> 00:22:18.011\nThe other thing is, I don't really want\nLance to have access to it as well.\n\n413\n00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:21.293\nSo you could see, if I click on\nthe drop-down underneath his name,\n\n414\n00:22:21.293 --> 00:22:23.144\nI could change it to just view-only.\n\n415\n00:22:23.144 --> 00:22:25.177\nSo he can still see it,\nbut he can't change it.\n\n416\n00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.565\nOr I can just stop sharing altogether.\n\n417\n00:22:27.565 --> 00:22:29.716\nAnd when I click stop sharing,\n\n418\n00:22:29.716 --> 00:22:34.431\nnow I'm going to be the only person\nthat has access to this file, and\n\n419\n00:22:34.431 --> 00:22:39.755\nI can move on and say thank you so much\nfor contributing but now, we are done.\n\n420\n00:22:39.755 --> 00:22:45.412\nThe last little part that I wanted to\ntell you about is the sharing privileges.\n\n421\n00:22:45.412 --> 00:22:50.143\nWhen I had shared it out to Lance, it gave\nup on the top that he could share this or\n\n422\n00:22:50.143 --> 00:22:52.670\ninvite other people to edit that as well.\n\n423\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.617\nIn your OneDrive admin,\n\n424\n00:22:54.617 --> 00:22:59.716\nyou have some settings in here that\nyou could if you wanted to say,\n\n425\n00:22:59.716 --> 00:23:05.111\nall right, well, I don't want people\nto go ahead and share past me.\n\n426\n00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:10.956\nAnd that is down here,\nif you scroll down just a little bit.\n\n427\n00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:12.277\nIt's getting there.\n\n428\n00:23:12.277 --> 00:23:14.013\nWait, I'm on the wrong section.\n\n429\n00:23:14.013 --> 00:23:20.930\n[LAUGH] I'm like wait, let's go over here\nto the left and click on the sharing part.\n\n430\n00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.220\nYes, so\nthe sharing capabilities of OneDrive.\n\n431\n00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.569\nAnd you could go down, the one was here,\n\n432\n00:23:26.569 --> 00:23:29.831\nit says let external users\nshare items they don't own.\n\n433\n00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:35.107\nBecause he, Lance was a contributor,\nhe wasn't the owner, so it's saying,\n\n434\n00:23:35.107 --> 00:23:40.176\nokay, you don't want to, I'm the only\none that can give that capability.\n\n435\n00:23:40.176 --> 00:23:43.622\nOne other point that I have mentioned,\nI said about the auto sharing.\n\n436\n00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:44.618\n&gt;&gt; The auto saving.\n\n437\n00:23:44.618 --> 00:23:46.479\n&gt;&gt; The auto save, yes, [LAUGH].\n\n438\n00:23:46.479 --> 00:23:48.147\nThe other S, [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:23:48.147 --> 00:23:53.081\nThe auto saving, that is something\nthat you do have to have like,\n\n440\n00:23:53.081 --> 00:23:55.786\nthe most recent version of Office.\n\n441\n00:23:55.786 --> 00:23:59.289\nAnd maybe by the time you're doing this,\nyou already have this feature.\n\n442\n00:23:59.289 --> 00:24:01.610\nBut for me, I don't have it.\n\n443\n00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:06.905\nLet me just point it out in PowerPoint.\n\n444\n00:24:06.905 --> 00:24:09.923\nAnd I'm going to go into my\nPowerPoint options of Joey,\n\n445\n00:24:09.923 --> 00:24:14.020\njust gonna go to open other presentation\nso I can get into the options.\n\n446\n00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.815\nYou see here on the General section,\n\n447\n00:24:16.815 --> 00:24:22.689\nthere's not a section down here that says,\nenable auto sharing for saving.\n\n448\n00:24:22.689 --> 00:24:28.176\nAnd that's because this particular version\nof Office or this particular version\n\n449\n00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:33.672\nof PowerPoint, you see right here\nversion 1609 and there's a build number.\n\n450\n00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:37.915\nLet me switch over here to JT,\nthis is Justin.\n\n451\n00:24:37.915 --> 00:24:39.740\nWell, I call him JT.\n\n452\n00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.562\nThat's his nickname.\n\n453\n00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:41.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or I guess my nickname.\n\n454\n00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:42.530\nI'm Justin aren't I?\n\n455\n00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n456\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so my nickname is Justin.\n\n457\n00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:50.610\nOver here in my PowerPoint,\nI do have that option.\n\n458\n00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.400\nAnd this is because I kinda forced it to\n\n459\n00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.360\ncommit to the most recent\nversion of PowerPoint.\n\n460\n00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.962\nAnd right here, look at the account,\nsee there's a different build number and\n\n461\n00:25:03.962 --> 00:25:06.563\nI have a higher build number and\na higher version number.\n\n462\n00:25:06.563 --> 00:25:11.411\nSo if I go into my options here right\ndown there, real-time collaboration,\n\n463\n00:25:11.411 --> 00:25:15.250\nwhen working with others\nautomatically save changes.\n\n464\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:20.820\nAnd so this is set and\nJustin's version but not in Joey's and\n\n465\n00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:27.890\nthat's where I made a quick little\nWord document that explains and\n\n466\n00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.420\ngives lengths to different websites\nthat kind of explain what this means,\n\n467\n00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.610\nis that you have to set in\nyour Office 365 Admin Center.\n\n468\n00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.420\nYou have to go in to your\nsoftware download settings and\n\n469\n00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.150\nset it to that every month,\nso where it's updating itself\n\n470\n00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.730\nevery month because the default\nsettings is every four months.\n\n471\n00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:52.090\nAnd so if you wait four months,\nit'll eventually get you all the changes,\n\n472\n00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:55.750\nbut if you needed to do that,\nyou could always set it to that.\n\n473\n00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:00.533\nAnd if that setting doesn't work, they\nsay that you can do a full uninstall of\n\n474\n00:26:00.533 --> 00:26:04.156\nOffice and then reinstall Office,\nand it would force it.\n\n475\n00:26:04.156 --> 00:26:05.392\nThat's what I had to do.\n\n476\n00:26:05.392 --> 00:26:10.250\nNow if you're in a networked environment\nor a large organization, you might not\n\n477\n00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.980\nhave access to this particular function\nwithin your Office 365 accounts.\n\n478\n00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.070\nSo if you don't see it, don't think\nthat you have something broken.\n\n479\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.750\nIt's just that you might have people\nthat are controlling you from higher up,\n\n480\n00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.392\nif you wanna say.\n\n481\n00:26:23.392 --> 00:26:24.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're saying no,\n\n482\n00:26:24.922 --> 00:26:27.627\nyou can't mess with those settings.\n\n483\n00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:30.062\nI do cover this in\nthe custom show's episode,\n\n484\n00:26:30.062 --> 00:26:34.190\nwhere we talk about the different ways\nthat you can use the zoom capabilities.\n\n485\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.914\nThis is another one of it's kind of all\nlumped together within your Office 365\n\n486\n00:26:38.914 --> 00:26:39.960\nadmin settings.\n\n487\n00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.390\n&gt;&gt; I love both of those features honestly.\n\n488\n00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.740\nThe autosave, cuz if you're working\nwith somebody or you're making changes.\n\n489\n00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.620\nYou are like hey, did you see what I did?\n\n490\n00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.230\nWhat do you think of that?\n\n491\n00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.720\nThough I don't see them.\n\n492\n00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.200\nThat's right, I didn't save it.\n\n493\n00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.610\nLet me save it real quick.\n\n494\n00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.080\nAnd it's just a constant issue.\n\n495\n00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.720\nSo, I like that.\n\n496\n00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.100\nAnd then the thing about sharing it.\n\n497\n00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.310\nYou know, I've shared it with you, but\nI don't want you sharing it with somebody.\n\n498\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.570\nIt could be intellectual property,\nit could be company specific, and\n\n499\n00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:08.800\nthere's a risk there of exposing\nthat data beyond what it should be.\n\n500\n00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.400\nSo, limiting who can share.\n\n501\n00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.710\nYes, I've shared it with you, but\nthat doesn't mean you can turn around and\n\n502\n00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:13.565\nshare it with somebody else.\n\n503\n00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:14.100\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n504\n00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.170\n&gt;&gt; I love both of those features,\nso we thank you for that Vonne.\n\n505\n00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.700\nGreat explanations, great demonstrations\non the whole sharing process.\n\n506\n00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.950\nBeing able to collaborate,\ntake advantage of the cloud, and\n\n507\n00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.390\nwork with people that aren't located\nin the same building, the same city,\n\n508\n00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.500\nthe same country as you, fantastic stuff,\nso we thank you for that.\n\n509\n00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.990\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n510\n00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.090\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been you host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n511\n00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:37.766\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n512\n00:27:37.766 --> 00:27:39.729\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n513\n00:27:39.729 -->

Hello welcome to another\nexiting episode here at IT PRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:20.138\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing our advanced Powerpoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:24.496\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be taking a look at custom shows.\n\n7\n00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:27.890\nNow you might think, well wait a second\nMike aren't all of my shows custom?\n\n8\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.030\nWe start with a blank presentation and\nbuild it from scratch.\n\n9\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.571\nWell that might be true there\nare some really cool features.\n\n10\n00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:38.420\nWe can take advantage of in PowerPoint\nthat give us the ability to do what we're\n\n11\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.040\ngonna call custom shows.\n\n12\n00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.410\nSo here to explain what\nthe heck that means and\n\n13\n00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.230\nhow we can do it is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n14\n00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.990\nWelcome back, Vonne.\n\n15\n00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.046\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n16\n00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:50.452\nAnd yes we are creating custom shows\nin the sense of how we're going to be\n\n17\n00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:52.298\ndelivering our slide shows.\n\n18\n00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:54.580\nNot necessarily building them.\n\n19\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.170\nSo we're gonna take our customly built\nshow and then create our presentation.\n\n20\n00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.730\nActually I think I just\nsaid that backwards.\n\n21\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.588\nWe are going to- [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well it's a custom built show.\n\n22\n00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:05.797\nWe're gonna also do custom presentations.\n\n23\n00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:07.209\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well, show presentation,\n\n24\n00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:09.456\nI think we're just gonna\nuse those interchangeably.\n\n25\n00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:10.037\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n26\n00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:12.290\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe made one now we have to deliver it.\n\n27\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.233\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n28\n00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:17.606\nSo maybe I have a slide show\nthat is focusing on a couple\n\n29\n00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:21.000\ndifferent Audiences for instance.\n\n30\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.864\nLike maybe I went ahead and made one big\nslideshow that has something that has\n\n31\n00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:30.729\nto do with the marketing team, and\nthe sales team and the development team.\n\n32\n00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.859\nAnd when I'm delivering a presentation\nto just the development team\n\n33\n00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.846\nthey might not really want\nto know all of the ins and\n\n34\n00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:41.566\nouts of what maybe the marketing\nteam is gonna want to know..\n\n35\n00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:44.293\nBut if I'm giving a presentation\nto say like the CEO or\n\n36\n00:01:44.293 --> 00:01:48.060\nthe board of directors they're gonna\nwanna know all of the departments.\n\n37\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.281\nSo they would wanna see every\nsingle section of our slides.\n\n38\n00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:55.891\nBut then individual pieces they don't\nneed to see what everybody else sees.\n\n39\n00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:56.864\nSo.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n40\n00:01:56.864 --> 00:01:57.364\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n41\n00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:59.979\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can create instead of making\n\n42\n00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.540\nfour different files\nwith the different slide.\n\n43\n00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.877\nYou can make one file,\none big presentation and\n\n44\n00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.723\nthen divide how you want to run the show.\n\n45\n00:02:09.723 --> 00:02:16.280\nYou can create a custom show to\nbe able to deliver to people.\n\n46\n00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.980\n&gt;&gt; So I might have a prevention that's\ndealing with our budget for example.\n\n47\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.480\nAnd when I deliver it for\n\n48\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.858\nour c level people I got to\nhave slides that have details.\n\n49\n00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:31.822\nBut I wanna skip those when I'm giving\nthe presentation to the c level people.\n\n50\n00:02:31.822 --> 00:02:32.400\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n51\n00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.720\nwhen I'm talking to the marketing\ndepartment they need to know how\n\n52\n00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.040\nthe budget breaks down\nwithin their department.\n\n53\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.750\nSo they need that more granular detail so\nmaybe I could then show those slides?\n\n54\n00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, great example.\n\n55\n00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.600\nIt's really just kind of taking instead of\na single linear presentation of slide one\n\n56\n00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.250\nto two to three, four, five, six.\n\n57\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.180\nYou could say let's go to slide two then\nwe jump to slide seven and eight, nine.\n\n58\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.360\nAnd then we go to slide 60 because all the\nother sides in between were somebody else.\n\n59\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.184\nSo it's just an easier way, like I said\ninstead of getting multiple files,\n\n60\n00:03:01.184 --> 00:03:03.950\njust make multiple,\nalmost like sub shows within it.\n\n61\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.104\nAnd so we're going to do different ways,\nwe're going to create,\n\n62\n00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:08.417\nwe're actually gonna create custom\nshows that's what it's called.\n\n63\n00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:11.579\nAnd then there's another thing that\nI'd like to show you about how you can\n\n64\n00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.335\nstart using action buttons and\nhyperlinks to be able to do that.\n\n65\n00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:19.128\nAnd there's an even cooler feature now in\nthe newest version of Office is there's\n\n66\n00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:23.989\nsomething called Zoom, which I think is\npretty, pretty awesome, and handy, and\n\n67\n00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.322\nreally neat looking.\n\n68\n00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:26.360\nSo we're gonna go off that.\n\n69\n00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.565\n&gt;&gt; All right Yvonne,\nI'll tell you that sounds really cool,\n\n70\n00:03:28.565 --> 00:03:30.383\nit's something I can use,\nlet's get started.\n\n71\n00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:33.426\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the first pulling I want\nto do before we start actually making\n\n72\n00:03:33.426 --> 00:03:36.340\nthose custom shows, is go over\nsomething known as rehearsed timings.\n\n73\n00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.513\nBecause if you are going to be\ndelivering these presentation you\n\n74\n00:03:39.513 --> 00:03:42.111\nmight wanna practice how\nlong is this going to take.\n\n75\n00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:45.603\nBecause we always budget that\nwe're going to have a 20 minute or\n\n76\n00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:49.360\na 30 minute episode and\nsometimes it's like hey no, I'm not done.\n\n77\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.304\nAnd it's really 45 minutes so\nI have to put that into two parts, right?\n\n78\n00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:53.842\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:57.588\n&gt;&gt; So you want to always try to\nsee how long this is gonna take,\n\n80\n00:03:57.588 --> 00:04:01.730\nwhile you're standing there at\nyour desk and trying to do this.\n\n81\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.492\nAnd then think about well somebody might\nask a question and budget that in so\n\n82\n00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:09.080\nyou know exactly how long it's\ngoing to take to run your show.\n\n83\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.940\nSo I'm going to open up a presentation\ncalled records slide show.\n\n84\n00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.833\nWe're not really recording anything\nnecessary I use this in another example in\n\n85\n00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:22.592\nanother episode as an example of how\nyou can record the actual presentation.\n\n86\n00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:25.414\nAnd we are going to be going\nto the same tab on the ribbon.\n\n87\n00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:29.114\nWe are gonna be going to the slide\nshow,but this time we're going to just go\n\n88\n00:04:29.114 --> 00:04:30.620\nwith rehearse timings.\n\n89\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.740\nSo practice makes perfect as it\nsays right there in the tool tip of\n\n90\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.420\nhow long is this going to take?\n\n91\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.407\nSo as soon as I go ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:36.407 --> 00:04:38.381\nclick rehearse timing it\nbrings me into the show.\n\n93\n00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:43.172\nAnd you can see in the upper left hand\ncorner it is actually counting down how\n\n94\n00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:48.210\nlong it's taken since I started the show\nand I'm introducing my first slide.\n\n95\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.721\nSo I could be saying okay,\nwe're going to open up with cats,\n\n96\n00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:52.213\nwe're going to talk about bishop.\n\n97\n00:04:52.213 --> 00:04:57.904\nAnd you go through your speech then\nyour ready to advanced your next slide.\n\n98\n00:04:57.904 --> 00:05:02.169\nBecause it is going to keep that\nrunning total in the right,\n\n99\n00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.680\non my right the right of\nthe little timer button.\n\n100\n00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.400\nAnd then in the middle\nit's giving the time for\n\n101\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.770\nthis particular slide of\nhow long you're taking.\n\n102\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.005\nAnd so you just go through and\ntalk about Fuego in his tree and\n\n103\n00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:15.412\nhow he likes to wave at\nall of the neighbors.\n\n104\n00:05:15.412 --> 00:05:18.131\nAnd all the dogs kind of like to bark\nat him and he just sits there and\n\n105\n00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:20.023\nlooks at them like [LAUGH]\nyour not getting me.\n\n106\n00:05:20.023 --> 00:05:22.118\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then he we talked about that and\n\n107\n00:05:22.118 --> 00:05:25.399\nthen now let's talk about Bishop and\nhow hes such a cute little baby.\n\n108\n00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:29.417\nAnd he loves to play in his little\ncat tree and make lots of noises.\n\n109\n00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:32.830\nAnd you hear scratches in the middle\nof the night, it's all the time.\n\n110\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.491\nAnd then you talk about that I'm done with\nthe PowerPoint presentation, thank you so\n\n111\n00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:41.142\nmuch for coming and\nenjoying my presentation about my cats.\n\n112\n00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:42.502\nAnd then you go ahead and stop and\n\n113\n00:05:42.502 --> 00:05:47.060\nyou can see that it says that the total\ntime was a minute and five seconds.\n\n114\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.035\nDo you want to save the new slide timings?\n\n115\n00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:53.036\nNope you're thinking well, sure why not?\n\n116\n00:05:53.036 --> 00:05:55.257\nNow why would I want\nto keep those timings?\n\n117\n00:05:55.257 --> 00:05:59.498\nCuz if you were running a slide show that\nwas going to be playing automatically\n\n118\n00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:02.119\nit's going to keep those times for\neach slide.\n\n119\n00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:06.042\nAnd then you can use that to do the\nadvance slide after this many minutes or\n\n120\n00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:08.240\nthis many seconds as you've been on it.\n\n121\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.377\nSo it's kinda nice is you can set all of\nthese features from the rehearse timings\n\n122\n00:06:13.377 --> 00:06:18.525\ninstead of setting it from the transitions\nwhere you're just guesstimating.\n\n123\n00:06:18.525 --> 00:06:23.980\nWell I think it's gonna take eight\nminutes or eight seconds per slide.\n\n124\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.620\nRehearse the show and\nsee how it works out.\n\n125\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.090\nWhere are those timings?\n\n126\n00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.940\nIf you go over to the transitions,\nI don't actually really need to go to\n\n127\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.490\nthe transitions I just\nnaturally went to that tab.\n\n128\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.050\nI was really wanting to go down to the\nslide sorter review to be able to see that\n\n129\n00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.701\nyep, all of those timings that\nI used are on the bottom of it.\n\n130\n00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:46.478\nAnd in the transitions tab I didn't want\nto go here to show you that it would\n\n131\n00:06:46.478 --> 00:06:51.690\nadvance automatically after those set\ntimings if you kept those timings.\n\n132\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.030\nAnd then the slide show you can\nsee it's checked on that you want\n\n133\n00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.400\nto use those timings and\nthen you could just let it play naturally.\n\n134\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.299\nSo if you're thinking if you\nhad a very rehearse play and\n\n135\n00:07:02.299 --> 00:07:05.391\nspeech that you know this is\nexactly what I'm going to say.\n\n136\n00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:09.328\nYou could let the slide show run knowing\nthat it's gonna take that long but\n\n137\n00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:10.932\nof course what if you mess up?\n\n138\n00:07:10.932 --> 00:07:12.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What if you trip up and\n\n139\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:13.650\nthen you're like wait,\n\n140\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.440\nnow the slide show's going in front of\nyou and you don't know where you're at.\n\n141\n00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.380\nSo everybody has different reasons for\nwhy you might want to use that.\n\n142\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.540\nAnd I probably if I was making\na presentation I would want to advance\n\n143\n00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.520\nthe slides myself.\n\n144\n00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.580\nBut if it is recorded to music or\n\n145\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.749\nanything like that example this is a great\nway to set the times and go forward.\n\n146\n00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:35.099\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; Now what if I don't want those timings\n\n147\n00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:37.510\nand can we just remove all of that?\n\n148\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.363\nYou can clear the timings on all\nslides from the record slide show and\n\n149\n00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:44.333\nit will clear everything.\n\n150\n00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:48.133\nThe other way you could have\ndone it is if you were on\n\n151\n00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:52.578\nthe transitions you could set\nthis to unchecked on after.\n\n152\n00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:56.155\nAnd then you can apply to all or\nif you could clear that out to zero.\n\n153\n00:07:56.155 --> 00:07:59.926\nAnd then Apply to All and\nthen it would get rid of the times.\n\n154\n00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:03.268\nI think it's a little easier to go\nthrough this record slide show and\n\n155\n00:08:03.268 --> 00:08:04.510\nthen clear the timings.\n\n156\n00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.950\nNotice that clear is not an option for\n\n157\n00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.410\nme, because it doesn't have any\ntiming associated with the slide.\n\n158\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.920\nSo that's why it's grayed out right now,\nbut\n\n159\n00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.830\nI think it's a little bit\neasier to go this way.\n\n160\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.650\nSo, always good to rehearse and\nsee how things are going before you start.\n\n161\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.280\nPractice does make perfect.\n\n162\n00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.290\nThe next thing I want to show you is going\ninto that, creating those custom shows.\n\n163\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.967\nI am going to not save the changes on\nthis and go to a different slide show or\n\n164\n00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:35.817\na different presentation to demonstrate\nthis, and we have custom shows.\n\n165\n00:08:35.817 --> 00:08:38.710\nAnd we will let it open up for a second.\n\n166\n00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.120\nThis is a new presentation, if you've\nbeen watching this entire series,\n\n167\n00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.720\nyou're like, this is different, right?\n\n168\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.729\n[LAUGH] Cuz I have been using\nquite the same files through here,\n\n169\n00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:54.218\nand I have it sectioned off into sections.\n\n170\n00:08:54.218 --> 00:08:55.785\nYou can see I have a default section,\n\n171\n00:08:55.785 --> 00:09:00.670\nbecause that's the one that always starts,\nbecause I added this section, and\n\n172\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.500\nso it automatically made\nthe one just called Default.\n\n173\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.090\nI could go ahead and rename that, because\nit should be a little bit different.\n\n174\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.210\nLet's just say Start, and\nI can rename my sections.\n\n175\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:16.900\nSo you can see that I have a couple slides\nthat go through the pictures of sunsets.\n\n176\n00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.540\nAnd then I have a section for\ncats that has, well, some cats.\n\n177\n00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.370\nAnd then I have some slides that\nhave some pictures of New York City.\n\n178\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.650\nAnd you can see some different\npictures of New York.\n\n179\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.585\nI have a final slide that I\njust called a Conclusion Slide.\n\n180\n00:09:31.585 --> 00:09:33.921\nBasically what we're going to do is,\n\n181\n00:09:33.921 --> 00:09:37.498\nwe're going to have this slide\nshow that has 15 slides.\n\n182\n00:09:37.498 --> 00:09:41.296\nBut depending on who I am delivering\nthis presentation to, whether it's\n\n183\n00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:45.594\nthe people that know about the cats or the\npeople that wanna know about the sunsets.\n\n184\n00:09:45.594 --> 00:09:50.583\nI can use this to then either jump around\nby creating custom buttons that I'm gonna\n\n185\n00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:54.269\nshow you first, or I could go ahead and\ncreate a custom show,\n\n186\n00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:56.900\nor I could use the zoom function.\n\n187\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.880\n&gt;&gt; So many options.\n\n188\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.610\n&gt;&gt; There is, so\nwhy don't we go through the first one,\n\n189\n00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.920\nof where we're going to add hyperlinks and\nsome action buttons.\n\n190\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.885\nNow hyperlinks, usually when you think of\nhyperlinks we're thinking about websites,\n\n191\n00:10:10.885 --> 00:10:13.285\nand here's a URL or a link to a website.\n\n192\n00:10:13.285 --> 00:10:16.210\nAnd that's exactly what\nhyperlinks can mean.\n\n193\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.950\nBut in this sense we're going to be\ncreating a hyperlink to where I wanna be\n\n194\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:25.220\nable to click the word sunset and\nit will jump to the sunset section.\n\n195\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:25.970\nWell you're thinking,\n\n196\n00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.009\nwell, that's the very next slide, so\ndo we really need that as a hyperlink?\n\n197\n00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:35.310\nWe'll keep it just to keep it consistent,\nbut if I was going to be on slide two and\n\n198\n00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:40.440\nwant to jump to the section for\ncats, well, cats is on slide seven.\n\n199\n00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.530\nSo click the word cats,\njumps to slide seven,\n\n200\n00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:48.410\nand then I can go ahead and\nplay those slides from that point on.\n\n201\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.710\nHow do I do that?\n\n202\n00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.210\nOn slide two we're going to go ahead and\nselect the word sunsets,\n\n203\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.170\nso I have that word selected.\n\n204\n00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.140\nYou can either right-click,\nthat is the wrong right-click.\n\n205\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.275\nSorry, I moved my mouse ever so\nslightly when I did that.\n\n206\n00:11:02.275 --> 00:11:06.275\nSo, when I right-click you can go ahead\nand go to hyperlink here, or you can go to\n\n207\n00:11:06.275 --> 00:11:12.045\nthe Insert tab and you can go to\nhyperlink from a link's group right here.\n\n208\n00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:15.320\nI do not want to link\nto an external file or\n\n209\n00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.290\nweb page, I do wanna have it\nfrom within this document, so\n\n210\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.630\nI do need to have the place in\nthis document option selected.\n\n211\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.010\nAnd then it shows me the list\nof the titles of the slides and\n\n212\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.470\nI would like to go to slide seven,\nwhich is where we start with the cats.\n\n213\n00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.088\n&gt;&gt; Sunsets.\n&gt;&gt; Are we doing sunsets?\n\n214\n00:11:31.088 --> 00:11:33.636\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n215\n00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:35.152\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\ngot cats on the brain [LAUGH].\n\n216\n00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:36.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we click OK, and\n\n217\n00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:39.460\nthen we have our sunsets, thank you.\n\n218\n00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.760\nThank you for keeping me there.\n\n219\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.220\nSo why don't we go ahead and\ngo to the cats and get the hyperlink for\n\n220\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.468\nthe cats as well while we're here.\n\n221\n00:11:44.468 --> 00:11:47.696\nWe will right-click, select hyperlink and\n\n222\n00:11:47.696 --> 00:11:50.820\nwe will go to cats, so\nthose words will jump there.\n\n223\n00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.441\nAnd I will select\nthe words New York City and\n\n224\n00:11:54.441 --> 00:11:58.371\ncreate a hyperlink to\nthe New York City slide.\n\n225\n00:11:58.371 --> 00:11:59.890\nAnd there you go.\n\n226\n00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:06.000\nI do know that these are links because\nof the visual underlining of the text.\n\n227\n00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.530\nThe reason why it is white and\nnot blue is because this is the theme.\n\n228\n00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:13.660\nSo any type of your design theme is going\nto designate whether or not it is blue or\n\n229\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.560\npink or\nhowever it kind of matches everything.\n\n230\n00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.070\nNow I'm doing this with words, but you\ncould just as easily do this with images,\n\n231\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.010\nwith smart art graphics, or with a shape.\n\n232\n00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.630\nSo it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be words.\n\n233\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.520\nAnything that you can click on basically,\nor\n\n234\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.090\nanything that is an object,\nyou can create a hyperlink from it.\n\n235\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:39.130\nSo I could have just as easily\ninserted a hyperlink to the image and\n\n236\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.980\nhave that be the trigger, if you wanna\nsay, for jumping to the next slides.\n\n237\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.350\nLet's try this out, let's go to the slide\nshow and go start from the beginning.\n\n238\n00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.716\nSo we're gonna be talking about Custom\nShows and then I'll advance to the next\n\n239\n00:12:50.716 --> 00:12:53.330\nslide, and maybe we're in\nthe New York City crowd, right?\n\n240\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.190\nSo this is the audience\nthat I'm delivering to, so\n\n241\n00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.490\nlet's talk about the pictures\nfrom New York City.\n\n242\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.166\nI click on it, and\nit immediately jumps to that slide,\n\n243\n00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:04.976\nwhich we know is about slide 10 or\n11, close to that.\n\n244\n00:13:04.976 --> 00:13:07.010\n&gt;&gt; Way down there, yeah.\n\n245\n00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.490\n&gt;&gt; And now I'm just advancing normally.\n\n246\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.240\nSo these are the pictures of New York City\n\n247\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.220\nthat were actually taken\nby my brother-in-law.\n\n248\n00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.880\nHe has some beautiful pictures.\n\n249\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.480\nThese are all just taken from his iPhone,\nby the way.\n\n250\n00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.920\nAnd these might be sunrises,\n\n251\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.350\nI don't think they're sunsets,\ncuz he does work late nights.\n\n252\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.500\nAnd so he usually has lots of early\nmorning shots that he sends in\n\n253\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.534\nthe family chat really\nearly in the morning.\n\n254\n00:13:28.534 --> 00:13:31.370\n[LAUGH] But they're really pretty.\n\n255\n00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.900\nAnd now I'm at this Conclusion Slide,\nand then I can go.\n\n256\n00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.390\nAnd then I end the show and so\n\n257\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.890\nI can jump around, and\nthat's just one way of doing it.\n\n258\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:44.440\nWhat if I was on the cats section?\n\n259\n00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.408\nSo I have a hyperlink, I've already\nset that hyperlink to the cats.\n\n260\n00:13:47.408 --> 00:13:50.232\nBut once I get to Bishop on slide ten,\n\n261\n00:13:50.232 --> 00:13:54.699\nI don't want to then advance to\nthe New York City slides and\n\n262\n00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:59.980\ngo through those, I want to just\njump to the Conclusion Slide.\n\n263\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.650\nSo think about if I had\ndifferent sections,\n\n264\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:07.140\nat each one of our sections you'd want\nsomething to get you to that last slide.\n\n265\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.890\nBecause if I'm giving\nthe presentation to the cats people,\n\n266\n00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:11.850\nthat's where they need to go.\n\n267\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.230\n&gt;&gt; They don't wanna see\nthe New York stuff.\n\n268\n00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.120\n&gt;&gt; They don't, so how could I do that?\n\n269\n00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.220\nYou could go ahead and\ncreate some words and text and\n\n270\n00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.310\ndo it just like we did before, but I did\nwanna show you that they have shapes.\n\n271\n00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.580\nSo I'm going to insert shapes, and\n\n272\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.520\nif I scroll down they have this\nsection called Action Buttons.\n\n273\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.550\nNow these are special, we'll call them.\n\n274\n00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:37.090\nThey're special shapes\nwith symbols in them, and\n\n275\n00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.940\nthey have an action automatically\nalready associated.\n\n276\n00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.280\nWhen I say action,\naction's almost like hyperlink.\n\n277\n00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.770\nIt's very similar, but\nit does a little bit more.\n\n278\n00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:48.910\nYou can add an action,\n\n279\n00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:53.000\nyou can really add an action to anything,\nsame thing like the text or an image or\n\n280\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.390\na different shape, it doesn't have\nto be specifically an action button.\n\n281\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.962\nAnd you can add a hyperlink, but you\ncould also have it like play a sound, or\n\n282\n00:14:59.962 --> 00:15:04.070\ndo some other things whether from click or\non rollover, so I'll show you what I mean.\n\n283\n00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:08.520\nBut for this example we're\ngoing to go to the Go To End.\n\n284\n00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.060\nYou see there's a Go to Beginning,\nGo to Next Slide.\n\n285\n00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.530\nSo I want to go ahead and\nclick that button.\n\n286\n00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.490\nGot it in my hand, I'm gonna go ahead and\ndraw that little button right there.\n\n287\n00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.370\nAnd it automatically pulls\nup the action settings,\n\n288\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:26.470\nyou can see that Action On Click hyperlink\nto, and that is going to the last slide.\n\n289\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.921\nBut, of course, I could drop this down and\nthen I could go to either the first,\n\n290\n00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:34.845\nprevious, or I can then go to a specific\nslide and then go through it.\n\n291\n00:15:34.845 --> 00:15:36.975\nSo it's very, very similar to\na hyperlink in that manner.\n\n292\n00:15:36.975 --> 00:15:40.695\nBut look at what actions also\nhave is running a program,\n\n293\n00:15:40.695 --> 00:15:43.075\nrun a macro, play a sound.\n\n294\n00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:45.715\nSo it kinda goes a little bit beyond\n\n295\n00:15:45.715 --> 00:15:49.690\njust doing a hyperlink if you wanted\nit to do some of these things.\n\n296\n00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.820\nAnd notice that there is\na different type of trigger.\n\n297\n00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.358\nYou could have it on mouse over, so\nyou could move your mouse over it, and\n\n298\n00:15:54.358 --> 00:15:56.399\nthen it would do those different things.\n\n299\n00:15:56.399 --> 00:16:01.564\nSo just a little bit more Action that you\nwant to say, that you can do by adding\n\n300\n00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:06.880\nan action to this that for this sense\nit's already done automatically.\n\n301\n00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.970\nSo if I click OK, you can see\nthat there is my action button.\n\n302\n00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.740\nAnd if I wanted to go ahead and\nget it on all of my slides,\n\n303\n00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.270\nthe end of each one of my section slides,\nI'm going to take this and\n\n304\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.880\nput it on the end of the New York City,\nagain, the next slide is the last slide.\n\n305\n00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.730\nBut we'll just go ahead and\npretend that it's not.\n\n306\n00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.520\n&gt;&gt; You might add more\nsections in the future and\n\n307\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.490\nthen all of a sudden it's not\nthe last slide in the deck.\n\n308\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.078\n&gt;&gt; There's a perfect example of why you\nwanna go ahead and do it anyway [LAUGH].\n\n309\n00:16:34.078 --> 00:16:35.030\nThank you.\n\n310\n00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.920\nLet's move over to the sunsets.\n\n311\n00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.450\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and paste this.\n\n312\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.900\nAnd it didn't keep the same color because\nI was saying that it was just keeping,\n\n313\n00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.830\nit says use the destination theme rather\nthan keeping the source formatting.\n\n314\n00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:50.030\nThat's why it changed from green to blue,\nin case anybody was wondering that.\n\n315\n00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.450\nBecause the way that I built these slides\nis I used all of the design ideas.\n\n316\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.470\nI didn't use any templates or any design\nthemes that were already installed.\n\n317\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.260\nI picked every slide individually and\n\n318\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.050\nchose that design idea and\nit did it for me.\n\n319\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.560\nAnd so that's why why was one green and\none blue?\n\n320\n00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:10.920\nThey look similar, but I did pick each one\nindividually, so I bet you one of them,\n\n321\n00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.310\nwell, obviously they had a different\ncolor scheme associated with it.\n\n322\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.130\nSo now, if I go back to the start,\nand I run my show from the beginning,\n\n323\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.450\nyou can see that if I'm going\nto be talking about the cats,\n\n324\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.470\nI can go through my different\nslides with the cats.\n\n325\n00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.720\nAnd then when I get to Bishop I can\nclick this button at the bottom,\n\n326\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.500\nand it goes automatically\nto the last slide.\n\n327\n00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.570\nSo, using a combination of hyperlinks\non any type of item, words, pictures or\n\n328\n00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:42.290\nshapes, and then adding the action\nbuttons, which are really just kind of\n\n329\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:49.220\nspecially built shapes that already\nhave those hyperlinks attached to it.\n\n330\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.540\nYou can create some different\nways of kind of jumping around\n\n331\n00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.950\na show to be able to\ndeliver to your audience.\n\n332\n00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.480\nSo that is one way that we can create it.\n\n333\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.850\n&gt;&gt; And you say one way.\nThat indicates that there are other ways.\n\n334\n00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.990\nSo Vonne, what else do you have for us?\n\n335\n00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.500\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n\n336\n00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.680\nIf you didn't want to have the buttons,\nand I wanted to have\n\n337\n00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.650\neverything kinda clean, I didn't want\nhyperlinks, you can create custom shows.\n\n338\n00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.580\nSo let's do that option.\n\n339\n00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.746\nThe custom shows is in the slide show tab,\nand it's right here.\n\n340\n00:18:20.746 --> 00:18:23.670\nSet up, whoops, that's the wrong one.\n\n341\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.440\n[LAUGH] Custom slide shows.\n\n342\n00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.260\nAnd then if you drop this\ndown it says custom shows,\n\n343\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.540\nbecause you're going to\nhave to create them.\n\n344\n00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.300\nYou're going to have to designate\nthat I want slide one, six, eight,\n\n345\n00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.270\nand ten to be in a custom show.\n\n346\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.934\nLet's go through the options.\n\n347\n00:18:35.934 --> 00:18:37.144\nWell, you do have to name this.\n\n348\n00:18:37.144 --> 00:18:38.737\nSo what's going to be my first one.\n\n349\n00:18:38.737 --> 00:18:44.050\nI'm going to actually, I need to name it.\n\n350\n00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:48.703\nAnd, I'm going to say cats.\n\n351\n00:18:48.703 --> 00:18:49.318\nCuz I really want to do\nthe cats first [CROSSTALK].\n\n352\n00:18:49.318 --> 00:18:49.876\n&gt;&gt; I knew you were gonna skip to that.\n\n353\n00:18:49.876 --> 00:18:53.144\n&gt;&gt; So, what slides do I\nwant to have in this show?\n\n354\n00:18:53.144 --> 00:18:54.409\nI want to have the first slide.\n\n355\n00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:56.063\nI want to have a second slide.\n\n356\n00:18:56.063 --> 00:19:00.620\n&gt;&gt; And then I would also like to\nhave seven, eight, nine, and ten.\n\n357\n00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.960\nSo I check off the slides that I want.\n\n358\n00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.930\nI click Add.\n\n359\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.560\nAnd then here they are in\nthe order that I want them to be.\n\n360\n00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.190\nIf for some reason I needed\nBishop to be before Fuego,\n\n361\n00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.700\nyou can see you can reorder them.\n\n362\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.500\nSo it doesn't have to\nkeep within the linear\n\n363\n00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.440\nset that you put in how you build the show\nor built the actual presentation.\n\n364\n00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.590\nThese custom shows,\n\n365\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.520\nyou could reorder them in whatever\norder that you would want them to be.\n\n366\n00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.840\nSo I click OK, and\nnow I have a cat's custom show.\n\n367\n00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.250\nJust for fun let's go ahead and\nmake a new one, and then we name it here.\n\n368\n00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.220\nI thought we named it in the beginning,\nsorry about that.\n\n369\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.089\nSo were going to go with lets go with,\nlet's go with NYC.\n\n370\n00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:42.247\nSo we will go make our New York show, and\n\n371\n00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:46.413\nwe will scroll on down to these slides.\n\n372\n00:19:46.413 --> 00:19:47.558\nWe will add those.\n\n373\n00:19:47.558 --> 00:19:49.146\nClick OK.\n\n374\n00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:58.530\nAnd then I can close this cuz now\nthese are like subshows of your file.\n\n375\n00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.910\nIf I want to just, and\njust said from the beginning,\n\n376\n00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.660\nthat's gonna say from the beginning.\n\n377\n00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.180\nBut if I knew that, and\nthis is before you even start,\n\n378\n00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.280\nthis is where you're in PowerPoint and\nyou're getting ready to get that first\n\n379\n00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.250\ntitle slide up before people come into\nthe building and ready to watch your show.\n\n380\n00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.980\nThis is where you would say\nnope I wanna go ahead and\n\n381\n00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.260\ndesignate that I wanna run the NYC show.\n\n382\n00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.930\nI choose that one,\nyou see it automatically starts.\n\n383\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.670\nSo I'm saying this is the one I wanna run.\n\n384\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.067\nAnd then if I click through my slides,\npretend we didn't have any hyperlinks.\n\n385\n00:20:28.067 --> 00:20:29.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I didn't click on a hyperlink,\n\n386\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.560\nI just clicked advance to the next slide.\n\n387\n00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.664\nHere's my New York City, and\nthen it goes through the specific slides\n\n388\n00:20:36.664 --> 00:20:41.783\nthat I designated in that custom show,\nand then it takes me to the end.\n\n389\n00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:46.229\nSo it's a nice way to customize\nmany shows within your file and\n\n390\n00:20:46.229 --> 00:20:49.855\navoid making multiple\ncopies of multiple files.\n\n391\n00:20:49.855 --> 00:20:52.280\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne,\ncan I go back in edit those custom shoes?\n\n392\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.346\nI noticed we didn't include our\nconclusions slide in the cats or\n\n393\n00:20:55.346 --> 00:20:56.325\nthe New York thing.\n\n394\n00:20:56.325 --> 00:21:00.740\nSo can we go back look and see what\nslides were in there and add to it?\n\n395\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I did that on purpose.\n\n396\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.560\n&gt;&gt; I knew that, and\nthat's why I gave you that question.\n\n397\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.085\n&gt;&gt; Kind of.\n\n398\n00:21:05.085 --> 00:21:06.150\n[LAUGH] But yes you can.\n\n399\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.570\nIf you come into your Custom Shows, and\n\n400\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:13.060\nthen you go into Custom Shows, you notice\nthat it's bringing you to your list\n\n401\n00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.180\nof all the ones that you have designated,\nand then you can edit them.\n\n402\n00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.200\nSo if I wanted to edit the cats,\nit just brings me right back into, well,\n\n403\n00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.810\nhere are all of your\nslides that are available.\n\n404\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.630\nI forgot that conclusion slide,\nlet me go ahead and add it.\n\n405\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.430\nAnd then it adds it.\n\n406\n00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.710\nNow, if it hadn't added in the right\nplace, you could then, of course, use\n\n407\n00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:35.745\nthese up and down buttons to go ahead and\nmake sure that it is in the right order.\n\n408\n00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:40.400\nBut, yes, that is a great point, that I\ncould come in and edit my show after it.\n\n409\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.370\nOr maybe I don't need any\nmore custom shows in here.\n\n410\n00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.830\nYou could always go ahead and remove it.\n\n411\n00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.610\nOr maybe you wanted\na starting point of cats, and\n\n412\n00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.430\nthen just add a few extra ones for\nwhatever reason.\n\n413\n00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.350\nYou can copy it.\n\n414\n00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.750\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Basically make a duplicate of that and\n\n415\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:00.050\nthen go in and edit that copied\nversion of your starting point.\n\n416\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:00.640\nVery good.\n\n417\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, couple of different\noptions in the custom shows.\n\n418\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.330\n&gt;&gt; And probably another good point,\nI think we saw, but just to make sure it\n\n419\n00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.730\nsinks in, notice that the custom shows\ncan actually share slides, right?\n\n420\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.350\nThe cats and\nthe New York both used the same intro and\n\n421\n00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.270\noutro slides,\njust different slides in between there.\n\n422\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great point.\n\n423\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.810\nThey do not have to be\nexclusive from each other.\n\n424\n00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.730\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n425\n00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:21.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, wonderful.\n\n426\n00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.170\nZoom.\n\n427\n00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:25.860\nIt's pretty fun, so.\n\n428\n00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.840\n&gt;&gt; So this is our third way we can go in,\nand create these custom shows.\n\n429\n00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.190\nAnd I know we were\ntalking before the show,\n\n430\n00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.920\nyou're a little excited about this one.\n\n431\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.770\n&gt;&gt; I am, it just has that\nlittle bit of flair to it.\n\n432\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.860\nAnd you don't really have to do much,\nwhich is nice.\n\n433\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:46.020\nThat's the nice part about it,\nis that it's a newer feature of Office.\n\n434\n00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.370\nAnd so, you will have to have the most\nrecent version of Office installed, but\n\n435\n00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.600\nI will talk about some of the little\nthings to some little tips and\n\n436\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.185\ntricks after I show you what it does.\n\n437\n00:22:55.185 --> 00:22:57.770\nCuz if you go into your PowerPoint,\nand you're like I'm so excited.\n\n438\n00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.940\nAnd you're like, I don't have zoom.\n\n439\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.660\nI had the same thing happen to me,\nso I had to go out and\n\n440\n00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.550\nfind out why, I know this exists,\nand I'd had it on another machine,\n\n441\n00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.990\nand this new installation didn't have it.\n\n442\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.270\nSo I'll give you those little\ntips in just one moment.\n\n443\n00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.290\nBut let's see what Zoom does first.\n\n444\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.980\nI'm going to go ahead and\nclose out of this file.\n\n445\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.970\nI don't need to save the changes for now.\n\n446\n00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.960\nCuz I made a different file for\ncustom shows zoom.\n\n447\n00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.830\nOne thing I'd like\n\n448\n00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.550\nto point out before we get started is\nthat we do have sections designated here.\n\n449\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.520\nAnd I said that before, but I just\nwanted to kind of reiterate that again,\n\n450\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.510\nis that I did go ahead and\nadd those sections.\n\n451\n00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.620\nAnd how do I add a section?\n\n452\n00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.770\nYou can either right-click in between\nyour slide and add a section, or\n\n453\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.085\nyou can come into here and add sections.\n\n454\n00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:45.880\nIt's just organizing the different places,\nor different slides that are in a section.\n\n455\n00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.110\nI don't know how else to explain that,\nreally.\n\n456\n00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.660\n&gt;&gt; It's like you're reading my mind\nbecause that was my next question.\n\n457\n00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.293\nCould you refresh us on\nhow to create sections?\n\n458\n00:23:51.293 --> 00:23:52.078\nSo, thank you for that.\n\n459\n00:23:52.078 --> 00:23:52.692\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n460\n00:23:52.692 --> 00:23:53.714\nWe're doing pretty good here.\n\n461\n00:23:53.714 --> 00:23:54.221\nYeah.\n\n462\n00:23:54.221 --> 00:23:55.511\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n463\n00:23:55.511 --> 00:23:58.065\n&gt;&gt; So, I want to Show you how to do Zoom.\n\n464\n00:23:58.065 --> 00:24:02.373\nI have this slide and I don't have\nanything on here, because there's a couple\n\n465\n00:24:02.373 --> 00:24:05.820\ndifferent ways that you can\nimplement this new Zoom feature.\n\n466\n00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.020\nIt's very, very similar to what I\njust showed you of making hyperlinks.\n\n467\n00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.791\nExcept that it's going to actually\nuse the slides as the picture or\n\n468\n00:24:14.791 --> 00:24:16.510\na button that you click on.\n\n469\n00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.650\nAnd then it jumps right to it.\n\n470\n00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.157\nBest way to show you is to do it.\n\n471\n00:24:21.157 --> 00:24:26.720\nWe go to Insert and we go to Links, and\nthe Links Group, and then we go into Zoom.\n\n472\n00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.260\nAnd there are three\ndifferent types of zooms.\n\n473\n00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.490\nThere's Summary, Section, and Slide.\n\n474\n00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.560\n&gt;&gt; Now, is this where I would realize\nif I had or didn't have Zoom?\n\n475\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.710\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Because that button won't be there,\n\n476\n00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.590\nokay, so at that point if I don't see it,\n\n477\n00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.710\nthey were gonna listen to your\ninstructions that are yet to come.\n\n478\n00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.230\n&gt;&gt; And that's the same thing that\nI was like, where did it go?\n\n479\n00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.390\nI know it's a feature and so yes,\n\n480\n00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:49.300\nif it doesn't live in your Insert tab,\nI'll tell you how to get it.\n\n481\n00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n482\n00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.210\n&gt;&gt; So Summary, Section, and Slide.\n\n483\n00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.500\nHow they're different.\n\n484\n00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.830\nWhat a Summary Zoom is going to do is\nit's gonna create you a brand new slide.\n\n485\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:04.590\nIf you use the Section Zoom, it's going to\nuse your present slide that you're in and\n\n486\n00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.180\nthen add it.\n\n487\n00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.010\nBut it's going to look very similar,\nso those are the biggest difference.\n\n488\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.910\nIs new slide created for\nyou versus it's just gonna go ahead and\n\n489\n00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.340\nput the pieces for you to be able to\nbuild it however you want to build it\n\n490\n00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.390\nwithin your current slide.\n\n491\n00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:22.546\nSo I'm gonna start with the Section Zoom\nand notice it is saying link to a section.\n\n492\n00:25:22.546 --> 00:25:24.070\nGot to have the sections.\n\n493\n00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.420\nThese are the different sections\nthat I have designated.\n\n494\n00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.110\nSo what are the ones I want buttons for\nthose different pieces?\n\n495\n00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.882\nSo I can select,\nI want Section 2, 3, and 4.\n\n496\n00:25:34.882 --> 00:25:38.470\nMy Sunsets, Cats and New York City.\n\n497\n00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:43.767\nI click Insert and\nit adds the slides like a little image of\n\n498\n00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:51.350\neach of hose sections first slides\nright into my slide my slide here.\n\n499\n00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.096\nI can then move them around just like\nI would if they were pictures and\n\n500\n00:25:55.096 --> 00:25:56.751\nI'm going to kind of go here.\n\n501\n00:25:56.751 --> 00:26:02.071\nI'm going to try to make myself not\nget to obsessive about the alignment.\n\n502\n00:26:02.071 --> 00:26:02.980\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff.\n\n503\n00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.627\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's enough,\nthat's enough [LAUGH].\n\n504\n00:26:03.627 --> 00:26:07.406\nAnd so you can see that's\nthe first slide of each section.\n\n505\n00:26:07.406 --> 00:26:10.449\nLet me show you what happens when\nyou go ahead and run it from,\n\n506\n00:26:10.449 --> 00:26:12.540\nI'll run it from the beginning.\n\n507\n00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.870\nSo I start the show.\n\n508\n00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.210\nHere's my next slide, so\nwhat are we gonna talk about?\n\n509\n00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.920\nLet's go ahead and\ntalk about New York City.\n\n510\n00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.990\nAnd as soon as I click on New York City,\nsee how it zooms in?\n\n511\n00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.147\n&gt;&gt; Hence the name zoom.\n\n512\n00:26:25.147 --> 00:26:26.050\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that fancy?\n\n513\n00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.801\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's so simple, but it's just,\n\n514\n00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:31.016\nI don't know, I just really like it.\n\n515\n00:26:31.016 --> 00:26:33.519\nSo here's New York and now I'm just\nclicking through as I normally would.\n\n516\n00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:35.128\nSo here's my next slide.\n\n517\n00:26:35.128 --> 00:26:36.694\nHere's my next slide.\n\n518\n00:26:36.694 --> 00:26:38.543\nHere's my next slide.\n\n519\n00:26:38.543 --> 00:26:39.976\nWhere do I go next?\n\n520\n00:26:39.976 --> 00:26:45.397\nIt zooms me back out and puts me right\nback to the slide I started from.\n\n521\n00:26:45.397 --> 00:26:46.137\n&gt;&gt; Very clever.\n\n522\n00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:47.188\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n523\n00:26:47.188 --> 00:26:51.400\nAnd then if I wanted to go to Cats,\nwe can go through the different cats and\n\n524\n00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.420\nthen it will zoom right back out to\nmy next slide and so on and so forth.\n\n525\n00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.970\nSo it's a nice way of organizing\ndifferent areas of your presentation that\n\n526\n00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.050\nalways kind of goes back.\n\n527\n00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.930\nSo think about if you were going\nthrough the different departments,\n\n528\n00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.110\nyou'd just click on it.\n\n529\n00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.910\nYou go in through that and you come\nright back out and that's all you need.\n\n530\n00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.300\nYou almost don't even need\nlike a whole another slide,\n\n531\n00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.630\nyou just right here talking.\n\n532\n00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:16.570\nI mean of course, you can still do more\nslides, but then you would have to,\n\n533\n00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:21.145\nI am just hitting the Escape key to\ntake me out of the show altogether.\n\n534\n00:27:21.145 --> 00:27:24.095\nYou could then create,\nyou could add another button for\n\n535\n00:27:24.095 --> 00:27:28.565\na hyperlink that would go\nto like the last slide.\n\n536\n00:27:28.565 --> 00:27:32.882\nIf I wanted to jump to the very last\nslide, but it's not in a section, is it?\n\n537\n00:27:32.882 --> 00:27:35.055\nI think it actually is\nin a section [LAUGH].\n\n538\n00:27:35.055 --> 00:27:39.594\nBut let's pretend that there isn't\na section called final slide,\n\n539\n00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:41.913\nbecause you can go into your zoom.\n\n540\n00:27:41.913 --> 00:27:44.165\nAnd you can go into a Slide Zoom, so\n\n541\n00:27:44.165 --> 00:27:48.220\nit's just jumping to a specific\nslide in your presentation.\n\n542\n00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.450\nAgain, pretend my last slide did not\nactually have a designated section on it.\n\n543\n00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.410\nOr even if it does, it doesn't matter\nbecause right here if I'm using this\n\n544\n00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:01.940\nparticular choice of zoom, I could say\nlet's go ahead and jump to the last slide.\n\n545\n00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.980\nIt adds it just the same.\n\n546\n00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.990\nNotice it doesn't have like\na little box around it.\n\n547\n00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.070\nBut I think that's actually because\nthat's the way the slide is formatted, so\n\n548\n00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.615\nnevermind.\n\n549\n00:28:09.615 --> 00:28:11.850\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and\n\n550\n00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:17.010\nrun this from this slide right here and\nwe will go from this current slide.\n\n551\n00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.760\nAnd you could go through your zooms.\n\n552\n00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.580\nAnd then if I jump down to this slide,\nit'll take me to that final slide.\n\n553\n00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.490\nAnd then it will go ahead and\nend the show.\n\n554\n00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.760\nCuz it's only taking me\nto a specific slide and\n\n555\n00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.220\nthen going forward from that place.\n\n556\n00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:35.705\nSo that's a little different than adding\nthe Section Zoom and the Slide Zoom.\n\n557\n00:28:35.705 --> 00:28:38.854\nAnd just the last option,\njust to show you what it does,\n\n558\n00:28:38.854 --> 00:28:42.900\nif you go to the Insert tab and\ngo to Links, I'm back on slide two.\n\n559\n00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.580\nJust to have a starting point for where\nl want to go, if l go to Summary Zoom,\n\n560\n00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.700\nthis is where it's automatically gonna\nfind the section slides that l have.\n\n561\n00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.860\nAnd there is my conclusion slide and\nl want to say yep, go ahead and add it.\n\n562\n00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.041\nLet's go ahead and insert, you can see\nthat it gave me a whole new slide.\n\n563\n00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:07.122\nAnd it did make an actual summary section\nfor me to do and then I could go ahead and\n\n564\n00:29:07.122 --> 00:29:12.300\ngive it it's own title, I could\nformat it and I can move it around.\n\n565\n00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.560\nSo it's just a starting point\nfrom when it will create it and\n\n566\n00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.900\nincreased that whole new slide.\n\n567\n00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.030\nAnd you can still customize it,\nmoving things around,\n\n568\n00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:24.600\nyou can make things smaller or bigger\nhowever you want it to go forward with it.\n\n569\n00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.190\nSo, love that new feature,\nit's very awesome.\n\n570\n00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.900\n&gt;&gt; Very, very cool.\n\n571\n00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.710\nAll right now, Vonne,\none last thing, I guess.\n\n572\n00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.470\nCan you show us how we can\nget that if we don't have it?\n\n573\n00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so I had to check this.\n\n574\n00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.880\nAnd cuz I just installed Office\nnot that long ago on this machine.\n\n575\n00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.980\nSo I'm like, how can I not have\nthe most recent version of Office\n\n576\n00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.390\ninstalled in my computer, and\nI have these in the show notes.\n\n577\n00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:51.350\nSo I have the links to some of\nthe places that I found online where\n\n578\n00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.280\nI found the information.\n\n579\n00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:58.010\nBut you have to go into your Office\n365 Administration Center, and then\n\n580\n00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:02.090\nyou have to go to your Office software and\nyour software download settings.\n\n581\n00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:06.437\nI was gonna go ahead and\njust take you into this quickly.\n\n582\n00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:10.790\nIf I could go ahead and\nlog into my 365 account.\n\n583\n00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.270\nSo here I'm at my login screen,\n\n584\n00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:16.980\nso I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign into my Office 365 account.\n\n585\n00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.383\nAnd then I'm going to wait for\nit for just a second.\n\n586\n00:30:19.383 --> 00:30:23.819\nOkay, so now I'm into my welcome\nscreen for my Office 365 for\n\n587\n00:30:23.819 --> 00:30:26.440\nmy Justin Timberlake account.\n\n588\n00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.660\nI'm going to go into\nthe Admin section right here.\n\n589\n00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.610\nIt will open up in a new tab.\n\n590\n00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.750\nSo now I'm in my Admin center.\n\n591\n00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:39.640\nWe're going to go over here to where\nit says the Office software and\n\n592\n00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.520\nwe're going to go into\nthe software download settings.\n\n593\n00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.390\nAnd we have our little box that comes up\nand it's going to go through everything.\n\n594\n00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:49.790\nThe thing you need to look for\n\n595\n00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.240\nhere is that how often do you\nwant users to get features.\n\n596\n00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.430\nAnd you want to choose it to every month.\n\n597\n00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.490\nWhen I had mine,\nit was set to every four months,\n\n598\n00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.550\nwhich is it says, the deferred channel.\n\n599\n00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.420\nI think it was on by default.\n\n600\n00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.008\nThat's how mine was set up.\n\n601\n00:31:05.008 --> 00:31:07.720\nSo you're thinking every four months.\n\n602\n00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.440\nWell, I thought I was on the most\nrecent version, I wasn't.\n\n603\n00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.594\nI changed it to this every month and\nthen I reinstall, I didn't reinstall yet,\n\n604\n00:31:15.594 --> 00:31:19.128\nI restarted my computer,\nI did all my things, I logged back in, and\n\n605\n00:31:19.128 --> 00:31:20.431\nit still wasn't there.\n\n606\n00:31:20.431 --> 00:31:24.060\nSo I was like well,\nthis is what it told me to do.\n\n607\n00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.020\nSo I did a little bit more searching and\nit said that if it\n\n608\n00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:31.660\ndoesn't work automatically if you choose\nthis option, it's still not doing what\n\n609\n00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:36.650\nI suggest is that you do a full\nre-installation of the Office products.\n\n610\n00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.510\nSo I went in to my Add or\nRemove programs, I went ahead and\n\n611\n00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:44.900\nuninstall the full version\nof Office from my computer.\n\n612\n00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:50.580\nCame back into my Office 365 account,\nclick the download or install Office.\n\n613\n00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.975\nI installed Office again and\neverything was there.\n\n614\n00:31:53.975 --> 00:32:01.535\nAnd it fixed, it worked itself out just\nlike the Google search told me to do.\n\n615\n00:32:01.535 --> 00:32:02.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is nice and\n\n616\n00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.470\nactually found it on Microsoft\ncommunity boards that would let\n\n617\n00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.410\nme know that that's what I needed to do.\n\n618\n00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.800\nAnd so if anybody has been watching and\nhow did you get that icons?\n\n619\n00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.400\nSee how it says insert an icon?\n\n620\n00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.510\nThis is another feature that was added and\n\n621\n00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.230\nthere's actually quite a few more\nthings in the PowerPoint options.\n\n622\n00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.270\nThat are new things that\nI hadn't seen before,\n\n623\n00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:27.690\nwhich actually we're going to be\ntalking about in another episode.\n\n624\n00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:34.770\nWhen we get into collaboration of the auto\nsaving that wasn't in this account.\n\n625\n00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.290\nIt wasn't in the account that I'm\ngoing to be demonstrating that from.\n\n626\n00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.848\nBecause I hadn't done this whole install,\nre-update everything,\n\n627\n00:32:40.848 --> 00:32:42.365\nre-update, is that a word?\n\n628\n00:32:42.365 --> 00:32:43.123\n&gt;&gt; Re-update, it is, no.\n\n629\n00:32:43.123 --> 00:32:44.653\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n630\n00:32:44.653 --> 00:32:48.683\nIt is, so that was my fix, so\nif you need to do that, double-check that,\n\n631\n00:32:48.683 --> 00:32:52.453\ncheck the links in my notes and\nyou should be able to have zoom ready for\n\n632\n00:32:52.453 --> 00:32:54.940\nyour wonderful PowerPoint presentations.\n\n633\n00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Vonne.\n\n634\n00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.240\nI tell you what we started the show,\nit's like what do you mean custom shows?\n\n635\n00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.880\nNow we all know what she\nmeans by custom shows.\n\n636\n00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.900\nFantastic stuff, great features there,\ngreat explanations and demos.\n\n637\n00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.176\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n638\n00:33:07.176 --> 00:33:09.889\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n639\n00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:11.032\n&gt;&gt;

Hello.\n\n12\n00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:33.278\nYes, we're going to be talking\nabout hidden information.\n\n13\n00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:34.893\n&gt;&gt; Hidden.\n&gt;&gt; It's not really hidden, but\n\n14\n00:00:34.893 --> 00:00:37.307\nit's probably something that\nyou don't see right away.\n\n15\n00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:40.520\nBecause anytime that we've\nbeen talking about our files,\n\n16\n00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.219\nwe've been talking about\ngiving the file a name,\n\n17\n00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.574\na location of where we're going\nto save it and the extension.\n\n18\n00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:51.058\nWe also talked about like the PPTX\nversus PPSX, [LAUGH] it's a matter of\n\n19\n00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:54.782\nfile format, I was trying to\nget those letters correct and\n\n20\n00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:59.418\nthose different types of files, but\nthere us a lot more information when\n\n21\n00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:04.490\nworking with files that is behind\nthe scenes, it's called metadata.\n\n22\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.510\nAnd this metadata can be very helpful for\nyou if you know one,\n\n23\n00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.920\nwhere it is and two,\nwhy you would even want to have it.\n\n24\n00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.520\nSo, I have file that we're going to be\nusing to add some information in, and\n\n25\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.560\nthis file specifically came from\nJoey Fatone, not Justin Timberlake.\n\n26\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.066\nHow do I know that?\nWell it says right here in the title slide\n\n27\n00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.048\nsaid Joey Fatone.\n\n28\n00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:28.610\nWell it's more than just that.\n\n29\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.731\nYou can find who created this file,\n\n30\n00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:34.349\nwhen it was created,\nwhen was the last time it was modified.\n\n31\n00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:38.361\nAnd you can even add more\ninformation to this file,\n\n32\n00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:42.744\nin case you wanted to index\nit in a more detailed manner,\n\n33\n00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:47.998\nthan just knowing the name of the file and\nthe location of the file.\n\n34\n00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:50.466\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Vonne, so\nwhere are we gonna find that information?\n\n35\n00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:53.417\n&gt;&gt; Well the file properties\nwould be in the file tab.\n\n36\n00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:56.827\nSo [LAUGH] we're going to go into\nthe back stage view over here, and\n\n37\n00:01:56.827 --> 00:02:00.609\nright on that info screen or the info\nsection that it comes on by default,\n\n38\n00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.160\nhere's my file properties.\n\n39\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.607\nWe're going to be going over all sorts\nof the things over here on the left, but\n\n40\n00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:09.001\nwe're gonna go over to the right first\nto show you that the file properties,\n\n41\n00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.359\nthis is where it has the size,\nthe number of slides.\n\n42\n00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.453\nAnd you can see that it has a title,\nwhich is the name of the file.\n\n43\n00:02:15.453 --> 00:02:18.051\nBut there's also some other\ntags that have been added, or\n\n44\n00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:20.716\nsome other information that\nhas been added into this file.\n\n45\n00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:24.774\nYou can see the tags has Fuego and Bishop.\n\n46\n00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:26.377\nAnd it has a category of cats.\n\n47\n00:02:26.377 --> 00:02:30.834\nAnd that's because Joey and I know\nthat Joey is the author of this file,\n\n48\n00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:35.200\nbecause it says so\nright there that Joey authored this file.\n\n49\n00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.650\nWell it also has that, Vaughn Smith\nis also the author on here, so\n\n50\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.720\nthere's two authors.\n\n51\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.530\nThere's nothing about Vaughn or\nJoey anywhere in this file,\n\n52\n00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.750\nwell Joey was on the title slide,\nbut Vaughn wasn't in there.\n\n53\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.000\nIt didn't tell me anything about Fuego or\nBishop from the very beginning, so this is\n\n54\n00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.010\nall that information that can be stored\nwith the file, to help you catalog it.\n\n55\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.610\nIt's kind of like if\nyou're using your context,\n\n56\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.280\nthere's a lot of fields when you have your\nfirst name, last name, the organization,\n\n57\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.220\nthe birthday, there's all sort of\ndifferent fields that you can add,\n\n58\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.660\nto be able to just keep on adding\ninformation to know what this is about.\n\n59\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.680\nIt's kind of like that,\n\n60\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.470\nit's like extending your contact\ninformation within this file.\n\n61\n00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.520\nAnd these are all things\nthat can be edited.\n\n62\n00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.300\nNow this came over already created,\nbecause Joey went ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.130\nput that into this document.\n\n64\n00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.438\nReally I was the one who put it into that.\n\n65\n00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:33.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why I added myself as an author.\n\n66\n00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.846\nLet's open up another file, just so\n\n67\n00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:37.425\nyou can see one that does\nnot have that information.\n\n68\n00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:41.991\nI'm gonna open up the Audio and Video\nfile that we had from another episode.\n\n69\n00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:44.710\nAnd you can see over here\nthat there aren't any tags.\n\n70\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.860\nThere isn't a category,\n\n71\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.950\nand it does have the author because\nit was authored by Justin Timberlake.\n\n72\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.820\nAnd you can see when was it created, and\n\n73\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.070\nwhen was it last modified,\nand all of that stuff.\n\n74\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.520\nBut it doesn't have any of\nthat extra information.\n\n75\n00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.803\nSo how can you add that information?\n\n76\n00:03:58.803 --> 00:04:00.239\nYou just click on it.\n\n77\n00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.260\nYou can see it's an actual\nfield right next to it.\n\n78\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.964\nAnd I could go ahead and put in audio.\n\n79\n00:04:04.964 --> 00:04:06.656\nI could put in video.\n\n80\n00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:11.970\nI could put in funny cats, cuz I think\nwe put in a funny cats video in there.\n\n81\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.335\nThings that would,\n\n82\n00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:17.921\nthe tags that you would think of\nthat are associated with this file.\n\n83\n00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:19.488\nWhat are those key words?\n\n84\n00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:22.381\nNow, how you decide what\nyou're gonna put in that and\n\n85\n00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:25.930\nwhat tags are gonna be consistent,\nthat's really all up to you.\n\n86\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.681\nI mean this is your way of\ncataloging this information.\n\n87\n00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:34.682\nOr it could be that maybe your company\nhas decided that these are going to be\n\n88\n00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:37.842\nspecific tags that we want you\nto add with all of the files or\n\n89\n00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:41.972\nall of the files that you're working with,\nbecause you could have hundreds\n\n90\n00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:45.416\nof thousands of files across\nmultiple drives and everything.\n\n91\n00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:49.364\nAnd, if you want it to be looking for\na file that you know was about audio and\n\n92\n00:04:49.364 --> 00:04:52.470\nvideo, but what if it wasn't named that?\n\n93\n00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.230\nYou could use this and I'll show you\nin a second that you can use that for\n\n94\n00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.350\nyour search capabilities, you could type\nin audio and it's going to actually search\n\n95\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.830\nthis metadata of all the files, and so if\nyou're putting that information into it,\n\n96\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.310\nit can really help you to be\nable to find things later.\n\n97\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.890\nSo, adding a category again,\ndo you wanna use a category,\n\n98\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.950\ndo you not wanna use a category?\n\n99\n00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.081\nMaybe you'll only use tags,\nit's up to you.\n\n100\n00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:18.682\nCategory, we'll just say cats since I\ncan't think of anything else [LAUGH].\n\n101\n00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:19.734\nI mean but again,\n\n102\n00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:23.952\ncuz the tags and categories you could\nalmost think to be the same thing.\n\n103\n00:05:23.952 --> 00:05:28.452\nIt really depends on how you want\nto differentiate these different\n\n104\n00:05:28.452 --> 00:05:30.530\nproperties for yourself.\n\n105\n00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.703\n&gt;&gt; Yes I'll tell you, I always like\nusing the categories as project names,\n\n106\n00:05:33.703 --> 00:05:36.725\nbecause I might have different files\nassociated with the projects and\n\n107\n00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:40.329\nPowerPoint presentations, spreadsheets and\nWord docs, lists, what have you.\n\n108\n00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:42.868\nSo for categories,\nI'll use that project name and\n\n109\n00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:45.821\nthen my tags are what's actually\nin this Word Document, or\n\n110\n00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:49.740\nwhat's in this presentation thar help\nme find the resource I'm looking for.\n\n111\n00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.220\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, and that's your method\nof being able to categorize and\n\n112\n00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.320\ncatalog all of your files.\n\n113\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.217\nThe way I might use it,\nmight be a little different.\n\n114\n00:05:58.217 --> 00:05:59.158\nAnd somebody come in and\n\n115\n00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.616\nI have no idea why she's putting\nthese things into her files.\n\n116\n00:06:01.616 --> 00:06:04.477\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, it makes sense to me.\n\n117\n00:06:04.477 --> 00:06:08.309\nIt's funny I found like an old drive\nwith this product I did years and\n\n118\n00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:09.801\nyears ago with this book.\n\n119\n00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.702\nAnd I'm like, why did I organize?\n\n120\n00:06:11.702 --> 00:06:13.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why did I name these files this way?\n\n121\n00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.310\nWhy did I put this in that folder?\n\n122\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.706\nAnd this makes no sense to me anymore,\nbecause I was so far removed from it.\n\n123\n00:06:19.706 --> 00:06:22.477\nBut it made sense at the time, so [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:06:22.477 --> 00:06:25.445\n&gt;&gt; So where we put these tags,\nwe put these categories in here,\n\n125\n00:06:25.445 --> 00:06:29.690\nwe've got to be able to use these outside\nof PowerPoint to be useful to us, right?\n\n126\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.736\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nAnd this is for any file,\n\n127\n00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:36.110\nnot just an Office files, but\nyou have things in Adobe files, like all\n\n128\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.876\nfiles can support or at least most files\nI would say, can support metadata.\n\n129\n00:06:40.876 --> 00:06:44.343\nAs soon as I said all, I remember\nreadings like TXT files and git.\n\n130\n00:06:44.343 --> 00:06:45.563\n&gt;&gt; TXT files and git.\n\n131\n00:06:45.563 --> 00:06:46.594\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw your face too.\n\n132\n00:06:46.594 --> 00:06:48.714\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like no it was not all, so\n\n133\n00:06:48.714 --> 00:06:51.634\nthat a lot of files can\nsupport that metadata and\n\n134\n00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:55.890\nyou can use it in different capacities,\nso I save this file.\n\n135\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.030\nAnd I will save this one as well.\n\n136\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.980\nAnd if I'm out here,\nI can use it in my Window search.\n\n137\n00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.860\nI could type in audio.\n\n138\n00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.670\nAnd now, one thing to make sure\nyou understand here is that\n\n139\n00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.060\nin the Windows 10 search, you do have to\nunderstand these little items up here.\n\n140\n00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.441\nIt's I'm not finding this in an app,\nI want to find it within my documents,\n\n141\n00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:22.821\nlike search the document information,\nnot what's out there on the web, or\n\n142\n00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:26.396\nwhat app it wants me to purchase,\nor download from the store.\n\n143\n00:07:26.396 --> 00:07:29.156\nAnd you can see that it's\nshowing the audio and video,\n\n144\n00:07:29.156 --> 00:07:33.126\nthat's probably not the best one to do\nexample because that isn't the title.\n\n145\n00:07:33.126 --> 00:07:36.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How about we do a fuego?\n\n146\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.980\nLet's move that off and\nwe will go with Fuego,\n\n147\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.190\nbecause I'm pretty sure I\ndidn't name any of my files.\n\n148\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.630\nWow, I cannot type.\n\n149\n00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.285\nThere we go.\n\n150\n00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:47.950\nThere's that file properties that\nI know had that tag in there, and\n\n151\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.600\nit's also gonna pull from the text that's\nin the document and everything like that.\n\n152\n00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.660\nBut at least I know I added\nthat as a file property.\n\n153\n00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.275\nSo it is actually working\nin a sense that it's.\n\n154\n00:08:00.275 --> 00:08:04.515\nSeeing that, and using that for\nyour search capabilities.\n\n155\n00:08:04.515 --> 00:08:08.330\nYou could if you wanted to, you could\nalways use it in your file explorer.\n\n156\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.110\nAnd you can add,\nsee over here I have different columns.\n\n157\n00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.120\nThere is a column called Authors over\nhere, and I think I added that myself.\n\n158\n00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.920\nBut you can come up to\nthese different columns.\n\n159\n00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.750\nAnd if you right click on them, you can\nuse those different, there's tags and\n\n160\n00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:27.880\ncategories right there, and titles that I\ncould use for my displaying, and using my,\n\n161\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.330\nnot just for searching, but for displaying\nthe information within your file system.\n\n162\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.850\nWhich could be very handy,\nif you choose to use them.\n\n163\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.930\n&gt;&gt; And we can search from\nthat top right corner, right?\n\n164\n00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:38.695\n&gt;&gt; Yes we can.\nRight in there.\n\n165\n00:08:38.695 --> 00:08:39.255\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n\n166\n00:08:39.255 --> 00:08:43.198\n&gt;&gt; And that would be specifically for\nwithin this folder, I was doing down here,\n\n167\n00:08:43.198 --> 00:08:45.800\nI was doing like a full system search.\n\n168\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.750\nSo it's, it depends on which way you wanna\ngo because this, cuz when you put it in\n\n169\n00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.770\nhere, it will specify that you are looking\nin this particular directory of folder.\n\n170\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.255\nSo it might make it a little easier,\nlike I know it's somewhere in this folder.\n\n171\n00:08:57.255 --> 00:08:58.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just don't know where it's hidden.\n\n172\n00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.890\nEither way, you can go ahead and use that.\n\n173\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, Yvonne.\n\n174\n00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.020\nSo we can add a lot of data or\nmetadata to our files,\n\n175\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.320\nwhich is gonna make it easier for\nus to find maybe what we're looking for.\n\n176\n00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.130\nWhat about if I wanna share\nthis outside my organization or\n\n177\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.470\nmake it available to the public?\n\n178\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.630\nSome of that information might not be,\nor probably shouldn't be exposed.\n\n179\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.290\nCan I get rid of it once we've added it?\n\n180\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.510\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, there's something that is\ninspect a document if you think of what\n\n181\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.488\nthat sounds like, it's inspecting your\nfile to see if there are things like\n\n182\n00:09:27.488 --> 00:09:32.420\nmetadata, or\nthere's content that's not on the slide.\n\n183\n00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.350\nWhy don't we get into it,\n\n184\n00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.890\nso I can remember remind myself\nabout all the different categories.\n\n185\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.230\nAnd the different things that inspect\ndoc could be very useful for.\n\n186\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.570\nAnd like Mike was just saying,\nI'm ready to distribute this.\n\n187\n00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.650\nMaybe I have things in\nthe speaker notes that is\n\n188\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.418\nkind of sensitive information\nthat's great for me as a presenter.\n\n189\n00:09:51.418 --> 00:09:57.150\nBut if I'm going to be putting this\nonline or sending it out to a client\n\n190\n00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.410\nthat doesn't need to see that information,\nhow can I get rid of all of that?\n\n191\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.430\nI might have 75 slides, and I have speaker\nnotes on every single one of them.\n\n192\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.960\nI've added metadata in there or\n\n193\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.070\nall sorts of things that I\nmight not want people to see.\n\n194\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.380\nSo inspecting can be very handy.\n\n195\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.690\nI'm gonna go back over to file and\nI'm gonna let info check for\n\n196\n00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.030\nissues and I can inspect a document.\n\n197\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.880\nAnd you can see over to\nthe side it says for\n\n198\n00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.630\npublishing you'll see if it\nhas an off slide objects.\n\n199\n00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.440\nThe presentation, the speaker notes,\nthe embedded documents and\n\n200\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.030\nall of the different document properties.\n\n201\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.880\nRather than coming in here and\nphysically deleting it,\n\n202\n00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.170\nbecause I showed you how\nyou can type them into add.\n\n203\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.590\nYou can just hit the delete key, or\nthe backspace key, in each one of them,\n\n204\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.400\nbut I might have a couple\ndifferent fields.\n\n205\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.870\nI don't wanna have to do\nall of them one by one.\n\n206\n00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:51.280\nThe inspect document will find it and\nthen give you options to remove\n\n207\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.430\na lot of this information or at least\nmore information on what you need to do.\n\n208\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.200\nSo let's go ahead and\ninspect this document.\n\n209\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.510\nAnd it's just telling me that\nI need to save my changes.\n\n210\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.585\nIt's always good to read your prompts.\n\n211\n00:11:04.585 --> 00:11:06.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll go ahead and save it now.\n\n212\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.920\nAnd here we go, our Document Inspector.\n\n213\n00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.710\nThe comments, if I have like a straight\ncomment in there that I didn't realize,\n\n214\n00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.610\nespecially if I was collaborating with\nsomebody and I make a comment in there\n\n215\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:21.002\nthat may it's really more for inter\noffice dialog, but not public dialog.\n\n216\n00:11:21.002 --> 00:11:23.924\nThat's where you would take that that,\nthe document properties,\n\n217\n00:11:23.924 --> 00:11:28.950\nadd-ins that could be potentially not\ngood, or you don't want to include that\n\n218\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.740\nin there because you don't want\nto get a warning by any chance.\n\n219\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.110\nAny type of macros or anything\nthat would cause any type of harm,\n\n220\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.460\nembedded documents.\n\n221\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.410\nI do like this one, off slide content.\n\n222\n00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:44.500\nBecause maybe I have something off to the\nside that I was kind of playing with or\n\n223\n00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.960\nI was drawing some shapes and\nI didn't want that one, but\n\n224\n00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.600\nI didn't want to delete it,\ncuz I might wanna use it later.\n\n225\n00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.000\nSo you could always check for\nthe not checked on by default.\n\n226\n00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.490\nSo you have to turn that on and\n\n227\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.491\nthen of course the presentation is would\nbe those speaker notes that I have.\n\n228\n00:11:56.491 --> 00:11:59.653\nIt will go through and\ninspect the document and\n\n229\n00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:03.380\nthen it will give you like\na report of what it has found,\n\n230\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.101\nI see that you have an author you\nalso have picture crop information.\n\n231\n00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:12.591\nI always find this handy, because if I did\nall of those kind of image editing it's\n\n232\n00:12:12.591 --> 00:12:15.708\ngreat but it does remember\nall that extra information.\n\n233\n00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:19.664\nAnd what if I cropped out\nanother company's logo or\n\n234\n00:12:19.664 --> 00:12:22.730\nanything that's it's still there.\n\n235\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.430\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they could then try to edit\nthe PowerPoint and undo the editing and\n\n236\n00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.920\npotentially see that information.\n\n237\n00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.510\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n238\n00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.980\nSo it's really important that you're like,\n\n239\n00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.335\nanything that I don't see,\nI don't want you to see either.\n\n240\n00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:34.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you could remove it, and\n\n241\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.690\nI think that's great that it's\njust a quick button right there.\n\n242\n00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.640\nIt was like, go ahead and take it out.\n\n243\n00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.140\nIt's gone.\n\n244\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.218\n&gt;&gt; Now one of the options that I saw in\nthere when you were getting ready to click\n\n245\n00:12:45.218 --> 00:12:49.096\ninspect, and it was telling you what it\nwas going to look for, was find things\n\n246\n00:12:49.096 --> 00:12:52.403\nthat people with accessibility\nissues might not be able to read.\n\n247\n00:12:52.403 --> 00:12:55.555\nCan we address that like\naccessibility within PowerPoint?\n\n248\n00:12:55.555 --> 00:12:56.459\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n249\n00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:57.720\nExactly.\n\n250\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.310\nBecause this is just talking about the\nactual information that we either see or\n\n251\n00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.400\ndon't see.\n\n252\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.390\nAnd then I can tell it to remove\nthe off content slide and\n\n253\n00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.250\nI can remove all my speaker notes and\nthen I can go ahead and clean up this.\n\n254\n00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.670\nTo be able to distribute, but\nthe other one that was in the inspect\n\n255\n00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.220\nwas in the file and\nwe have checked for issues.\n\n256\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.160\nWe have accessibility issues, cuz that's\nsomething that's also very important.\n\n257\n00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.680\nCuz you have people that might be hearing\nimpaired or visually impaired and\n\n258\n00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.550\nyou want to be able to have them\nexperience the document to be able for\n\n259\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.530\nthem to either hear it or\nsee it in however which way that they do.\n\n260\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.780\nSo checking for accessibility is\nsomething that's really important.\n\n261\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.910\nAnd it's kind of a weird one to think\nabout because this is such a very,\n\n262\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.120\nvisual program and\nsuch a like presentations are visual.\n\n263\n00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.480\nBut there's a lot of things that\nyou can do to help with that.\n\n264\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.840\nSo if I go ahead and check the\naccessibility, it's gonna go through and\n\n265\n00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.900\nfind all the different things that,\nit's saying that someday that would be\n\n266\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.590\nhearing or\nvisually impaired would have trouble with.\n\n267\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:07.640\nAnd some of the biggest ones are going to\nbe reading order, and then alternate text.\n\n268\n00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.580\nI know those are two big ones.\n\n269\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:16.470\nI also put a website up here, and\nI will include this in the notes as well.\n\n270\n00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:21.550\nBut they do a really good job of\nexplaining a lot of the details and\n\n271\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.460\ninformation, and\ngiving you lots of suggestions\n\n272\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.180\non what you can do to make your\nPowerPoint presentations more accessible.\n\n273\n00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:34.010\nI think they just do a really great job\nof explaining how, like what it is,\n\n274\n00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.940\nhow you can kind of change it and\n\n275\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.000\nyou can see like the alternate text\nthat's with any visual tables.\n\n276\n00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.680\nAnd so\nit's just giving you suggestions as well.\n\n277\n00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.010\nMeaningful hyperlink text and screen tips.\n\n278\n00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.430\nEnsuring that color is not the only\nmeans of conveying information.\n\n279\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.550\nThings that you might not\nconsider if you're doing it for\n\n280\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.040\njust an onscreen visual presentation\nwhere I can hear and see everything.\n\n281\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.930\nWhat about for those that can't?\n\n282\n00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:05.060\nAnd I just really appreciate the time and\neffort they put into this.\n\n283\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.460\nBecause it is something\nthat is very important.\n\n284\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.200\nI am pointing out one where it says,\nmaking videos accessible.\n\n285\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.760\nIt does talk about closed captioning.\n\n286\n00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.710\nThat is something that does have\nto be within the file itself.\n\n287\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.560\nPowerPoint can't do that it,\nitself for any type of video.\n\n288\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.170\nBut you can see it gives you links to\nhow you can use that in alternative\n\n289\n00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.030\naudio tracks and thinking about when\nyou're picking a video, making sure that\n\n290\n00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.130\nthere is enough of an audio track\nthat somebody could follow along,\n\n291\n00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.490\nrather than it just being visual.\n\n292\n00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.460\nYou see it a lot on social media now.\n\n293\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.772\nEverything has the closed captions because\na lot of people don't even have sound on\n\n294\n00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:40.396\ntheir phones.\n\n295\n00:15:40.396 --> 00:15:44.281\nSo it's not even just for\na disability stand point, it's,\n\n296\n00:15:44.281 --> 00:15:47.035\npeople don't want to have you listening.\n\n297\n00:15:47.035 --> 00:15:48.555\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The videos that\n\n298\n00:15:48.555 --> 00:15:52.080\nthey're watching, so kind in the close\ncaption can be really, really handy.\n\n299\n00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.008\nSo definitely check out this link and\n\n300\n00:15:54.008 --> 00:15:56.753\nsee about the different\ntechniques that you can do.\n\n301\n00:15:56.753 --> 00:15:59.561\nThe few things that I wanted to\nshow with that ultimate text and\n\n302\n00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:01.540\nthen the reading order.\n\n303\n00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.254\nFor your files.\n\n304\n00:16:02.254 --> 00:16:07.280\nAnd it will give you this accessibility\nreport that does tell you what objects\n\n305\n00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.790\nhave missing alt text and some slides that\nyou might wanna change the reading order.\n\n306\n00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.890\nI'm gonna go to slide three.\n\n307\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.630\nActually, maybe slide four, here we go.\n\n308\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.960\nSo with this one, it's like, well,\n\n309\n00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.160\nI'm not understanding what\nyou mean by reading order.\n\n310\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.610\nThere's only one thing.\n\n311\n00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.500\nThe thing that you need to look for\nis the Selection Pane.\n\n312\n00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.670\nNow the Selection Pane is something\nthat you can bring up on the Home tab\n\n313\n00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.620\nunder Range, and\nyou can see the Selection Pane.\n\n314\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.340\nAnd we had used this in some other\nepisodes where you're wanting to\n\n315\n00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.860\nget somewhere where you could click on and\nselect\n\n316\n00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.050\nthe different items in your presentation\nreally quickly, this is the way to do it.\n\n317\n00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.900\nWell, you see that the order and\nif somebody was, if this was being\n\n318\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.090\nread out loud to somebody like a screen\nreader and everything it's going to read\n\n319\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:57.080\nthe Content Placeholder 8 first and\nthen the title.\n\n320\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:57.590\nThink about it.\n\n321\n00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.440\nYou would probably want the title to be\nfirst and then the content placeholder.\n\n322\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.380\nNow I don't have any content in there, so\n\n323\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.667\nmaybe I'll just say the fat cat,\ncuz he is quite a large man.\n\n324\n00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:13.350\nSo you can see that I want\nthe title first and then the text.\n\n325\n00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.850\nSo you can change the order by\ndragging it within the selection pane.\n\n326\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.180\nAnd to us visually,\nthat doesn't change anything.\n\n327\n00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.630\nWe see the title and then the description.\n\n328\n00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.642\nBut the reading order in the selection\npane can be really handy.\n\n329\n00:17:25.642 --> 00:17:30.110\nAnd it's not really hard to just\ngo ahead and choose the order\n\n330\n00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.650\nthat if somebody was reading this to\nsomebody, what order would it be?\n\n331\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.920\nSo I think that's really handy and\nthe selection pane has made it a lot\n\n332\n00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.300\neasier to do than older\nversions of the program.\n\n333\n00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.820\nThey've really come a long way with trying\nto make the accessibility accessible for\n\n334\n00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.370\nyou to be able to modify.\n\n335\n00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.920\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, very important stuff,\n\n336\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.370\nand especially if you have to be\ncompliant with regulations as well.\n\n337\n00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.293\nNow, Vonne,\nyou had showed us the reading order.\n\n338\n00:17:57.293 --> 00:17:59.365\nYou had mentioned\nsomething called alt text.\n\n339\n00:17:59.365 --> 00:18:00.230\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Can you tell us a little bit\n\n340\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.890\nmore about that?\n\n341\n00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes, alternate text is\nkind of what it sounds like.\n\n342\n00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.570\nIt's text that's alternate\nto the visual image.\n\n343\n00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:11.460\nIt's the description that\nyou might not actually see,\n\n344\n00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.330\nbut somebody having this read to them with\nthe screen reader, it's going to read.\n\n345\n00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.700\nBecause we can see right here in this\nslide that this is a picture of a big,\n\n346\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.580\nfat white cat laying in the grass, right?\n\n347\n00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.620\nWe could add that as the description.\n\n348\n00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.690\nWe might leave out the portly\npart of our description,\n\n349\n00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.838\ncuz Fuego would not really like that.\n\n350\n00:18:29.838 --> 00:18:30.609\n&gt;&gt; Fuego would appreciate that.\n\n351\n00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:32.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes, he's a buffalo.\n\n352\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.120\nSo, that's his other nickname,\nhe's a big buffalo.\n\n353\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.031\nHow do I add alternate text to any image?\n\n354\n00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:40.668\nThis could be a table, Smart Art graphic.\n\n355\n00:18:40.668 --> 00:18:44.819\nIf you right-click on the object, you can\ngo into the Format Picture, SmartArt,\n\n356\n00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:48.438\nwhatever the thing that you are\nright-clicking on and you can bring it,\n\n357\n00:18:48.438 --> 00:18:50.951\nwow, I got a lot of panes\ngoing on over here [LAUGH].\n\n358\n00:18:50.951 --> 00:18:56.750\nIn the Format Picture,\nthere is this category, this section.\n\n359\n00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.520\nAnd that's where your alternate,\nor alt, text is located.\n\n360\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.560\nAnd you could go ahead and\nput the title and the description.\n\n361\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.360\nAnd you can see that it also gives\nyou the little tool tip, sorry,\n\n362\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.880\nI clicked it, to provide alternative text\n\n363\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.070\nbased representations of the information\ncontaining in these visual elements.\n\n364\n00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.650\nSo a title is really all you really need.\n\n365\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.945\nA description would be that if you\nwanted to make a longer description.\n\n366\n00:19:21.945 --> 00:19:24.515\nI believe the title, is it 128 characters?\n\n367\n00:19:24.515 --> 00:19:25.518\nOr, I might be pulling that.\n\n368\n00:19:25.518 --> 00:19:26.226\n&gt;&gt; It is limited to, I think.\n\n369\n00:19:26.226 --> 00:19:27.436\n&gt;&gt; It is limited.\n\n370\n00:19:27.436 --> 00:19:33.368\nI don't know if 128 is the limit, but\nI do know that it does have a capacity.\n\n371\n00:19:33.368 --> 00:19:34.810\nMaybe it's 144?\n\n372\n00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.573\nI don't know why I keep saying,\nI think 128 is Twitter, isn't it?\n\n373\n00:19:38.573 --> 00:19:39.412\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is.\n[LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:40.987\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's probably why I keep\n\n375\n00:19:40.987 --> 00:19:44.482\nsaying that, but I know that there is\na description limit or title limit.\n\n376\n00:19:44.482 --> 00:19:51.150\nSo I will say large white\ncat laying in the grass.\n\n377\n00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.110\nAnd then that's where I can add\nthat alternate text to my images.\n\n378\n00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:04.220\nAnd I can have this be a lot more\naccessable to people with disabilities.\n\n379\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.120\n&gt;&gt; All right now Vonne.\n\n380\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.730\nI was looking ahead, I saw one more in\nthat drop down list when we went to File &gt;\n\n381\n00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.803\nInspect and I think it said compatibility.\n\n382\n00:20:10.803 --> 00:20:12.405\nWhat are we talking about there?\n\n383\n00:20:12.405 --> 00:20:18.330\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's where we're talking about\nour different file formats for PowerPoint.\n\n384\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.240\nAnd that's where the PPT versus the PPTX.\n\n385\n00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.550\nIn 2007 and above,\nyou had the file extension of PPTX,\n\n386\n00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.230\nand then below that, 2003 and\nlower, that's where it's PPT.\n\n387\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.950\nWhy does that matter?\n\n388\n00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:37.720\nWell, there's a lot of neat,\nnew features that you can do in these\n\n389\n00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.330\nlatest versions of Powerpoint that if\nyou were going to be using it on 2003 or\n\n390\n00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.980\nsending into somebody with 2003,\nthey wouldn't necessarily be able to see\n\n391\n00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.600\nsome of the elements that you're adding.\n\n392\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.618\nThey would see it, but\nthey wouldn't be able to edit it.\n\n393\n00:20:53.618 --> 00:20:56.876\nSo if I'm putting in these\ncomplex SmartArt graphics,\n\n394\n00:20:56.876 --> 00:20:59.162\nthey might not be able to do anything and\n\n395\n00:20:59.162 --> 00:21:03.410\nit's just going to be like an image on\ntheir slide and not be able to do it.\n\n396\n00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.165\nSo that compatibility checker is going\nto check for something like that.\n\n397\n00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.090\nLet's run that over here.\n\n398\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.470\nI have a bunch of different\ntest screens over here, so\n\n399\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.610\nlet's close some of those out.\n\n400\n00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.150\nAnd we'll go over here to File, and\nwe will go to Check for Issues, and\n\n401\n00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:21.354\nwe have Check Compatibility, and this is\nwhere it's going to check for features.\n\n402\n00:21:21.354 --> 00:21:24.335\nAnd it's saying, right,\nthat shape can't be edited, but\n\n403\n00:21:24.335 --> 00:21:27.540\nthe text in the shape can be\nrevised using earlier versions.\n\n404\n00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.850\nSo you can see that it says slide four.\n\n405\n00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:33.030\nIt's that the formatting that I\nhave on the image, that fancy,\n\n406\n00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.510\nthe cropped corners and\nthe drop shadow and\n\n407\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.850\neverything like that, so\nthey're not going to be able to see.\n\n408\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.540\nThe nice thing about it is that\nif you click on any of these help\n\n409\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.450\nin there it goes right to the website that\njust gives you lists upon lists of all\n\n410\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:50.280\nthe warning errors or the different\ncompatibility issues that you might\n\n411\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.780\nface when going to a earlier\nversion of PowerPoint.\n\n412\n00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.840\nAnd it lists everything out and\n\n413\n00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.240\nthen it just kind of gives\nyou all the information.\n\n414\n00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.569\nMy, there it is, it's finally loading up.\n\n415\n00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:03.900\n[LAUGH] I'm on the wireless, so\nit's going a little slower right now.\n\n416\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.850\nBut you can see every single one\nof these is going to tell you what\n\n417\n00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.790\nis wrong with it and\nhow you can correct it.\n\n418\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:18.570\nBut 2003, that's an old version of\nPowerPoint, but it is still around.\n\n419\n00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.220\nThere was some weird statistic\n\n420\n00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.546\nabout Windows 7-\n&gt;&gt; Windows XP.\n\n421\n00:22:22.546 --> 00:22:24.279\n&gt;&gt; XP, you guys were talking about, yeah.\n\n422\n00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:26.306\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nstill like 10% of the computers out there.\n\n423\n00:22:26.306 --> 00:22:27.678\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n\n424\n00:22:27.678 --> 00:22:32.590\n[LAUGH] But hey, it's out there, so\nyou do have to at least be aware of it,\n\n425\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.890\nknow what it does, and\nhow to accommodate it.\n\n426\n00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.810\nSo that is our compatibility checker.\n\n427\n00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.680\nSome of the last things that we're\ngoing to go over with our advanced file\n\n428\n00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.740\nproperties really work with\nthe protecting of this document.\n\n429\n00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.840\nBecause if I'm sending this to Mike,\nI trust Mike and\n\n430\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.244\nI know that he-\n&gt;&gt; Mistake.\n\n431\n00:22:51.244 --> 00:22:52.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n432\n00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know,\n\n433\n00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:55.388\nyou are a little wishy-washy\nthere sometimes.\n\n434\n00:22:55.388 --> 00:22:57.051\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I know him,\n\n435\n00:22:57.051 --> 00:23:00.829\nhe's in my organization,\nthat I could send him something and\n\n436\n00:23:00.829 --> 00:23:02.584\nhe's gonna be fine with it.\n\n437\n00:23:02.584 --> 00:23:07.153\nBut what if I'm sending this out onto a\nnetwork that maybe I don't want Ronnie to\n\n438\n00:23:07.153 --> 00:23:08.950\nget into it, right?\n\n439\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.395\nHe can be able to [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Plagiarize, use his middle name.\n\n440\n00:23:11.395 --> 00:23:13.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What is it?\n\n441\n00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.025\n&gt;&gt; Plagiarize.\n\n442\n00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:16.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n443\n00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.388\nSo I'm not sure if I would want\nRonnie to get into my document.\n\n444\n00:23:20.388 --> 00:23:22.331\nSo I could put a password on it, and\n\n445\n00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:27.150\nI could give you the password to open the\nfile, but I wouldn't give it to Ronnie.\n\n446\n00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.340\nI don't know about that.\n\n447\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.860\nSo there's different ways\nthat you could protect it.\n\n448\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.190\nThe marking as final,\nsince that's the first one in this list,\n\n449\n00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:37.890\nI went from adding\na password to mark as final.\n\n450\n00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.000\nAll this is is just going to\nmake it a read only file and\n\n451\n00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.620\nput a little thing across it,\nI have marked this as final.\n\n452\n00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.761\nBut it can be very easily overridden, but\n\n453\n00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:54.438\nit is a nice visual indication that\nhey I'm done with this don't check it.\n\n454\n00:23:54.438 --> 00:23:57.012\nCuz let's say I finished\nthe presentation and\n\n455\n00:23:57.012 --> 00:24:01.501\nI'm going to be presenting it to the board\ntomorrow and it's in a shared folder.\n\n456\n00:24:01.501 --> 00:24:05.470\nWell, if Mike goes and opens the file and\nhe sees that across the top then\n\n457\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:09.771\nhe's gonna, Hopefully think, okay,\nVonnne has said that she's done, so\n\n458\n00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:13.493\nI'm not gonna change anything in\nthis file, but you still could.\n\n459\n00:24:13.493 --> 00:24:17.601\nSo I'm gonna just mark this as final and\nall I did was just click that.\n\n460\n00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:22.674\nI click OK and it said that it has been\nindicate that editing is complete.\n\n461\n00:24:22.674 --> 00:24:25.810\nSo it is saying that I am done.\n\n462\n00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.090\nIf I click OK,\nthis is what they would see.\n\n463\n00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.650\nAnd maybe this could be,\nmaybe not just for you, for me.\n\n464\n00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I need to remind myself that,\n\n465\n00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:35.260\ndon't do anything to this.\n\n466\n00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.790\nThis is the version that you are done.\n\n467\n00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:41.251\nCuz maybe I made, file properties one,\ntwo, three, [LAUGH] four, 4.5,\n\n468\n00:24:41.251 --> 00:24:43.118\nall of the different versions.\n\n469\n00:24:43.118 --> 00:24:45.780\nThis is an indication to me,\ndon't do anything.\n\n470\n00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.597\nBut you could see how easy is it for\nme to just start editing it?\n\n471\n00:24:49.597 --> 00:24:52.679\nI just click edit anyway and\nI could go ahead and start editing it.\n\n472\n00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:58.034\nSo visual indication, but\nit's not a true locking this down.\n\n473\n00:24:58.034 --> 00:25:00.900\n&gt;&gt; One of those keep the honest\npeople honest type thing.\n\n474\n00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.010\nAnd you're gonna hopefully realize,\nthe commenting period is over.\n\n475\n00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.720\nI missed my window, I'm not gonna\nmake any more comments on there.\n\n476\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.640\nCuz you don't want Vonne going to\nher presentation tomorrow in front\n\n477\n00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.270\nof the board, and\nsee your comments all over there.\n\n478\n00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.360\nBut like you said, if there's\nsomething that needs to be fixed,\n\n479\n00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.850\nit's not like we've permanently\nmarked it as non-editable.\n\n480\n00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.380\nIt's really just a way to make\nsure everybody's aware, hey,\n\n481\n00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.920\nthis is the final version.\n\n482\n00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.803\nPlease don't goof it up.\n\n483\n00:25:23.803 --> 00:25:26.212\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, for\nothers or for yourself.\n\n484\n00:25:26.212 --> 00:25:27.027\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n485\n00:25:27.027 --> 00:25:28.227\n&gt;&gt; Some other ones that we have,\n\n486\n00:25:28.227 --> 00:25:28.858\nthe password.\n\n487\n00:25:28.858 --> 00:25:32.460\nNow that's one that I do not\nwant anybody to mess with this.\n\n488\n00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.130\nThe only way that they're going to\nbe able to open the file is if I\n\n489\n00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.230\ngive them the password.\n\n490\n00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.120\nBe careful about this because if you\ncan't remember your password to open\n\n491\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.070\nthe document,\nyou're not gonna be able to get it.\n\n492\n00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.370\nWell, I'm sure you could cuz\nyou can hack a lot of stuff.\n\n493\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:49.480\n&gt;&gt; We'll say that the password\nprotection in here is not the greatest.\n\n494\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.070\nBut it is definitely another one\nof those that's worth doing,\n\n495\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.640\nit's gonna keep the casual\nperson from making changes.\n\n496\n00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.962\nIt's not the end all in security, but\nthat's not what it was designed for.\n\n497\n00:25:57.962 --> 00:26:00.773\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you don't have\nsomebody like Mike on staff,\n\n498\n00:26:00.773 --> 00:26:04.010\nthat would be able to use some type\nof tool for ethically hacking.\n\n499\n00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.976\n&gt;&gt; Well, I will tell you that\nyou can pretty much Google this.\n\n500\n00:26:06.976 --> 00:26:09.644\nCuz I've locked myself out of\nsome documents before, and\n\n501\n00:26:09.644 --> 00:26:11.284\nyou can find some little crackers.\n\n502\n00:26:11.284 --> 00:26:12.941\nBut that would not be ethical,\nthat's right.\n\n503\n00:26:12.941 --> 00:26:17.514\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, [LAUGH] but it will,\nfor the common people like myself,\n\n504\n00:26:17.514 --> 00:26:22.190\nthat is not a security expert like Mike,\nthis would at least help.\n\n505\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.581\nSo if I typed in, I'm typing\nthe word apple, and then I click OK.\n\n506\n00:26:26.581 --> 00:26:29.390\nI'm going to retype it and then click OK.\n\n507\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.550\nYou could see that if I save this file and\n\n508\n00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:36.350\nthen I close it,\nthe next time that I come to open it, and\n\n509\n00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:40.040\nit's going to say, well, if you want to\nopen this, you have to have the password.\n\n510\n00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.182\nSo what is the key?\n\n511\n00:26:41.182 --> 00:26:44.698\nAnd then if I type that in,\nthen it will let me in.\n\n512\n00:26:44.698 --> 00:26:48.123\nNow if you wanted to remove the password,\nsince I had the password to\n\n513\n00:26:48.123 --> 00:26:51.202\nget into the file, when I save,\nit's gonna remember that.\n\n514\n00:26:51.202 --> 00:26:54.874\nAnd then every time I try to open it,\nif you wanted to remove the password,\n\n515\n00:26:54.874 --> 00:26:57.970\nyou'd just come back into\nthe Protect Presentation.\n\n516\n00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.400\nYou click the encrypt with password and\n\n517\n00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.680\nyou just delete the little\nbubbles I call them.\n\n518\n00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.610\nThe words or the letters that are in for\nthe password that you set,\n\n519\n00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.740\nand so that's a way that you\ncan protect the document.\n\n520\n00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.631\nThere are two last things that we're\njust going to go over pretty quickly in\n\n521\n00:27:13.631 --> 00:27:14.138\na sense.\n\n522\n00:27:14.138 --> 00:27:16.421\nBut I will at least\ntell you what they are.\n\n523\n00:27:16.421 --> 00:27:19.300\nThe restrict access,\nthat sounds like a great thing.\n\n524\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.630\nThe thing what that is\nthat you do have to have\n\n525\n00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.170\nconnecting to your rights\nmanagement servers.\n\n526\n00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:30.470\nIf you don't have this set up, it's not\ngonna know what you're talking about.\n\n527\n00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:34.594\nSo this IRM,\nInformation Rights Management.\n\n528\n00:27:34.594 --> 00:27:36.740\nThat would be something that\nyou would set up on a network.\n\n529\n00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.481\nCorrect, Mike?\n\n530\n00:27:37.481 --> 00:27:38.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n531\n00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.957\n&gt;&gt; Your network administrators\nwould have this all set up and\n\n532\n00:27:40.957 --> 00:27:42.690\nthis would actually mean something.\n\n533\n00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.130\nBut you would have to,\nis it with Active Directory?\n\n534\n00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.492\n&gt;&gt; It's tied into Active Directory.\n\n535\n00:27:46.492 --> 00:27:49.682\nAnd you can do some neat things\nwith rights management services,\n\n536\n00:27:49.682 --> 00:27:50.610\nlike I cannot say,\n\n537\n00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:54.790\nyou can't forward this presentation to\nanybody that doesn't have a company email.\n\n538\n00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.620\nSo you can't send it\noutside your organization.\n\n539\n00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.970\nOr I can send it to you, but\nyou're not gonna be able to print it.\n\n540\n00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.755\nSo it can do some really neat things,\n\n541\n00:28:01.755 --> 00:28:05.451\nbut it is gonna require infrastructure\nfrom your IT department to support.\n\n542\n00:28:05.451 --> 00:28:07.644\n&gt;&gt; I'm just glad that I remembered\nthat Active Directory part, so.\n\n543\n00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:08.408\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n544\n00:28:08.408 --> 00:28:09.209\n&gt;&gt; I sound so techie.\n\n545\n00:28:09.209 --> 00:28:09.709\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n546\n00:28:09.709 --> 00:28:12.790\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\nthere's the Restrict Access.\n\n547\n00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.980\nAnd you could add a digital\nsignature to this document.\n\n548\n00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:21.260\nThe whole idea about adding\na digital signature is saying that,\n\n549\n00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.430\nI am signing off on this and\nI'm attaching my signature to it.\n\n550\n00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.060\nAnd that indicates that I was\nthe last person that touched it.\n\n551\n00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:34.700\nAnd then if I send it to Mike, if somebody\nhad compromised it in between that time,\n\n552\n00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.980\nthen that digital signature\nwould no longer be valid.\n\n553\n00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.740\nAnd then it would indicate that\nsomebody else has messed with the file,\n\n554\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.500\nif you wanna say.\n\n555\n00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.990\nSo it's just that extra level of\nsecurity of understanding that is,\n\n556\n00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:51.800\nI signed off on this, I created this,\nI edited it, and I'm done.\n\n557\n00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.390\nAnd so if it's broken,\nthen somebody's tampered with it.\n\n558\n00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.908\nAnd we don't necessarily want that.\n\n559\n00:28:56.908 --> 00:29:03.010\nAnd you do have to have a certificate\nthat validates your digital signature.\n\n560\n00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.333\nAnd that's, again, a lot of times\nif you're in a large organization,\n\n561\n00:29:06.333 --> 00:29:09.834\nyour company will issue a certificate for\nyou or have a certificate server.\n\n562\n00:29:09.834 --> 00:29:13.892\nAnd everything that's set up within your\norganization that basically verifies that\n\n563\n00:29:13.892 --> 00:29:16.610\nVonne has signed this,\nthis is Vonne, and we're done.\n\n564\n00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:17.950\nOr I guess I'm Justin, I'm sorry.\n\n565\n00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.551\nAnd Justin is signing this, and Justin has\nsigned off on it and everything like that.\n\n566\n00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:26.367\nBut for use around the office or,\nin a lot of times, in a normal capacity,\n\n567\n00:29:26.367 --> 00:29:31.740\nyou probably won't need to go to this\nlength of adding a digital signature.\n\n568\n00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:37.020\nBut it is available, and in huge\norganizations this can be really important\n\n569\n00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:42.145\nof verifying this is the person\nmade it and that's that person.\n\n570\n00:29:42.145 --> 00:29:43.465\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, great stuff there.\n\n571\n00:29:43.465 --> 00:29:45.905\nReally good look at some of\nour advanced file properties.\n\n572\n00:29:45.905 --> 00:29:49.515\nSome of the stuff that we can use\nbeyond title and extension, right?\n\n573\n00:29:49.515 --> 00:29:54.286\nThat we can add to our document with\nthat metadata facilitate searching for\n\n574\n00:29:54.286 --> 00:29:59.223\nthat document and large repositories\nof files expecting our presentation.\n\n575\n00:29:59.223 --> 00:30:02.971\nLooking for maybe some of that metadata\nthat we don't want in there when\n\n576\n00:30:02.971 --> 00:30:05.540\nwe're getting to release\nit out to the public.\n\n577\n00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:10.045\nChecking for accessibility issues,\nchecking for compatibility issues.\n\n578\n00:30:10.045 --> 00:30:13.531\nAnd then of course how to secure\na document, maybe with a password or\n\n579\n00:30:13.531 --> 00:30:15.040\neven a digital signature.\n\n580\n00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.480\nSo we thank you for that, Vonne.\n\n581\n00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.890\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n582\n00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:21.850\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n583\n00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:22.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n584\n00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.387\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n585\n00:30:24.387 --> 00:30:30.565\n[MUSIC]\n\n586\n00:30:30.565 --> 00:30:33.720\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",
