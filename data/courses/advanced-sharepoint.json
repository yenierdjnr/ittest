you an overview of what you\n\n4\n00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.010\ncan expect in our upcoming\nseries Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.740\nStanding next to me is\nour SharePoint expert Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.130\nMark Ingram who's gonna fill us in on some\nof the details of our upcoming series.\n\n7\n00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.040\nHow you doing Mark?\n\n8\n00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.780\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n9\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.110\nSo some of you will have already watched\nthe first SharePoint series we filmed and\n\n10\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.830\nyou'll need content from that week and\nthis upcoming week of episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.640\nIn order to have a chance\nat passing the 70-339 exam,\n\n12\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.740\nyou'll also need hands-on experience\nas you would for any Microsoft exam.\n\n13\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.460\nLet's take a look at what\nthose objectives are.\n\n14\n00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.670\nOkay, so we can see that this\nexam is currently in beta.\n\n15\n00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.390\nAnd many of you won't even be attempting\nthe exam during the beta period, so\n\n16\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.290\nthat's fine.\n\n17\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.350\nIf you are feeling really proactive and\nwant to write the exam, how it works,\n\n18\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.240\nthe beta exams, typically you don't find\nout for months, whether or not you passed.\n\n19\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.900\nSo you're one of the guinea pigs,\nand they do their metrics and\n\n20\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.120\nfigure out who should get a passing\nscore based on a variety of criteria.\n\n21\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.650\nThere's someone at Microsoft, Liberty\nMunson, one of the best names ever.\n\n22\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.400\nAnd that's her whole job,\nis psychometrics and and\n\n23\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.490\nexam analysis and verifying the validity\nor reliability of these exams.\n\n24\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.760\nOkay, so scrolling down here.\n\n25\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.690\nThere's a variety of objective domains for\n\n26\n00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.100\nevery exam, and for\nthis one we have seven objective domains.\n\n27\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.230\nSo again we use content from the basic\nSharePoint admin course, and\n\n28\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.710\nthis week's segments,\nepisodes, and we can see here,\n\n29\n00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.450\nI like to print these out because\ntrying to navigate multiple screens,\n\n30\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.200\nit's tough to get a handle on\nit even if you use digital ink.\n\n31\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.160\nSo, do yourself a favor.\n\n32\n00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.950\nPrint them out and then you can use\na highlighter or somehow highlight\n\n33\n00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.310\nobjectives you have no clue about or areas\nyou wanna brush up on, and then maybe some\n\n34\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.610\nof those areas you'll be quite confident\nin but you should still review those.\n\n35\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.520\nSo if I click on Show all it expands and\nyou can see here under each objective\n\n36\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.200\ndomain for example design SharePoint\ninfrastructure, we get into very explicit\n\n37\n00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.970\ndetail about what you need to be\nconfident on and have skills in hands on.\n\n38\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.170\nNow some of them are designed related type\nquestions you'll get, so the hands on\n\n39\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.827\nwould be more architecturally planning and\nknowing architectural models for example.\n\n40\n00:02:30.827 --> 00:02:32.264\nSo, we're not going to\ngo through all of these.\n\n41\n00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:37.055\nJust my main point is to get you onto\nthis page ASAP in your exam journey for\n\n42\n00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.268\nwhatever exam you're writing.\n\n43\n00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:41.304\nFind out what the test is on.\n\n44\n00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:42.287\nPretty fundamental, right?\n\n45\n00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.499\nA lot of people thought well,\nI'll just do the courses first,\n\n46\n00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:45.471\nthen I'll think about it.\n\n47\n00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:49.390\nBy reviewing all the exam objectives and\nreading the content.\n\n48\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.150\nIt'll make your ears perk up when you hear\nconcepts related to those exam objectives,\n\n49\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.522\nso it's never too early to start\npreparing for the exam objectives.\n\n50\n00:02:57.522 --> 00:03:00.740\nAll right, that said, let's talk\nabout what we're covering this week.\n\n51\n00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.070\nWe've got a lot to cover.\n\n52\n00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.060\nSo we'll look at four\narchitectural models of SharePoint.\n\n53\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.230\nAlways, exam fodder is new functionality\nand change functionality, deprecated.\n\n54\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.140\nMaybe new names for the old things.\n\n55\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.420\nSo any changes compared to\nthe previous version is fair game and\n\n56\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.050\nyou can expect questions\ndesigned to confuse you\n\n57\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.210\ninto perhaps selecting an answer\nthat used to be correct.\n\n58\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.620\nFor example, SharePoint 2013.\n\n59\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.279\nBut now in the new era\nis no longer correct.\n\n60\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.590\nSo core Microsoft SharePoint\nconcepts we'll review as well,\n\n61\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.170\nhybrid scenarios are a huge part\nof Microsoft's way forward,\n\n62\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.650\nmost of the investment in new design,\nnew technologies,\n\n63\n00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.750\nnew productivity apps, for example,\nhappens in the hybrid world,\n\n64\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.970\nwith SharePoint online,\na combination of online and on print.\n\n65\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.760\nSo we'll look at hybrid architectures, and\nconfiguring one drive and one drive for\n\n66\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.210\nbusiness, as well.\n\n67\n00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.840\nWe'll also look at business\ncontinuity management.\n\n68\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.390\nAlways in season.\n\n69\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.780\nYou might be subject to a disaster.\n\n70\n00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.160\nYour data center may burn to a crisp.\n\n71\n00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.340\nWhat's your strategy?\n\n72\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.630\nSo we'll look at various\nhigh-availability strategies,\n\n73\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.060\nboth local and maybe geolocated\nsomewhere else beyond where you are.\n\n74\n00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.748\nWe'll look at the benefit of using\nAzure as a DR site, if you will.\n\n75\n00:04:17.748 --> 00:04:21.261\nAnd various back-up and restore plans,\n\n76\n00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:27.500\nvarious SQL topologies which will help\nyou in your back-up and DR rules.\n\n77\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.180\nWe'll also look at business connectivity\nservices in secure store service.\n\n78\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.609\nSo the ability to connect in to any\norganized data source creating middleware,\n\n79\n00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:40.840\nessentially, connect in to that other\ndata source and the secure storage server\n\n80\n00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.740\nstores credentials used to\naccess the other data source.\n\n81\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.430\nThe benefit here is that, individual users\ncan access a variety of data repositories\n\n82\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.330\nto do their work or pulling in data for\nreports for example.\n\n83\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.740\nDon't spend half their\ntime authenticating.\n\n84\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.550\nSo we can move towards the holy grail of\nsingle sign-on by leveraging the secure\n\n85\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.950\nstore service.\n\n86\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.420\nWe'll also look at productivity services,\nso we'll look at SharePoint apps and\n\n87\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.480\nthe app architecture.\n\n88\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.800\nAccess services, PowerPoint automation\nservices, Word automation services.\n\n89\n00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.010\nAnd we'll talk about solutions\nas a way of introducing\n\n90\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.870\nfunctionality in your\nSharePoint environment.\n\n91\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.060\nConnecting people, so\nwe'll talk about planning user profiles,\n\n92\n00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.520\nmy sites, profile synchronization.\n\n93\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.900\nWe'll look at community sites as a way\nof setting up discussion boards and\n\n94\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.310\nfostering knowledge exchange\nwithin your organization.\n\n95\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.570\nWeb content managements\nwe'll look at as well.\n\n96\n00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.650\nSo especially considerations regarding\nmultiple locals and languages.\n\n97\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.740\nWe'll look at managed navigation and\ncatalog sites.\n\n98\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.700\nAnd web content management is part of\nenterprise content management we'll look\n\n99\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.478\nat that as well.\n\n100\n00:05:54.478 --> 00:05:57.620\nSo including e-discovery for\n\n101\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.640\nlegal discovery, records management\nwe'll cover in that episode as well.\n\n102\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.930\nAnd site based retention policies.\n\n103\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.840\nWe'll also look at some BI solutions,\nsome really cool BI technologies like\n\n104\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.590\nPower BI for example,\nwe can leverage within Office 365, so\n\n105\n00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.440\na variety of business intelligence tools\nare available to us and productivity.\n\n106\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.880\nSo we'll look at integration with\nSharePoint and project server and\n\n107\n00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.770\nalso project team sites.\n\n108\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.690\nWe'll show you how to set those up and\n\n109\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.580\nproject server integration\nwe'll talk about as well.\n\n110\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.030\nAnd also upgrading and\nmigrating to SharePoint 2016.\n\n111\n00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.020\nSo we'll look at planning considerations\nbefore you consider upgrading and\n\n112\n00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.220\nthe flexibility in terms of\nsite collection upgrades and\n\n113\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.660\nthen some advanced scenarios, as well.\n\n114\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.440\nSo all this and more is coming at\nyou in these series of episodes.\n\n115\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.630\n>> All right, Mark.\n\n116\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.260\nFantastic, you've got me excited\nabout Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n117\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.930\nI hope you are excited as I am,\nso we are ready to get started.\n\n118\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.945\nHope to see you there.\n\n119\n00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:11.704\n[SOUND]\n\n",
