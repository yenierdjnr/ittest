you an overview of what you\n\n4\n00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.010\ncan expect in our upcoming\nseries Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.740\nStanding next to me is\nour SharePoint expert Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.130\nMark Ingram who's gonna fill us in on some\nof the details of our upcoming series.\n\n7\n00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.040\nHow you doing Mark?\n\n8\n00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.780\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n9\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.110\nSo some of you will have already watched\nthe first SharePoint series we filmed and\n\n10\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.830\nyou'll need content from that week and\nthis upcoming week of episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.640\nIn order to have a chance\nat passing the 70-339 exam,\n\n12\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.740\nyou'll also need hands-on experience\nas you would for any Microsoft exam.\n\n13\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.460\nLet's take a look at what\nthose objectives are.\n\n14\n00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.670\nOkay, so we can see that this\nexam is currently in beta.\n\n15\n00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.390\nAnd many of you won't even be attempting\nthe exam during the beta period, so\n\n16\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.290\nthat's fine.\n\n17\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.350\nIf you are feeling really proactive and\nwant to write the exam, how it works,\n\n18\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.240\nthe beta exams, typically you don't find\nout for months, whether or not you passed.\n\n19\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.900\nSo you're one of the guinea pigs,\nand they do their metrics and\n\n20\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.120\nfigure out who should get a passing\nscore based on a variety of criteria.\n\n21\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.650\nThere's someone at Microsoft, Liberty\nMunson, one of the best names ever.\n\n22\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.400\nAnd that's her whole job,\nis psychometrics and and\n\n23\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.490\nexam analysis and verifying the validity\nor reliability of these exams.\n\n24\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.760\nOkay, so scrolling down here.\n\n25\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.690\nThere's a variety of objective domains for\n\n26\n00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.100\nevery exam, and for\nthis one we have seven objective domains.\n\n27\n00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.230\nSo again we use content from the basic\nSharePoint admin course, and\n\n28\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.710\nthis week's segments,\nepisodes, and we can see here,\n\n29\n00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.450\nI like to print these out because\ntrying to navigate multiple screens,\n\n30\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.200\nit's tough to get a handle on\nit even if you use digital ink.\n\n31\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.160\nSo, do yourself a favor.\n\n32\n00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.950\nPrint them out and then you can use\na highlighter or somehow highlight\n\n33\n00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.310\nobjectives you have no clue about or areas\nyou wanna brush up on, and then maybe some\n\n34\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.610\nof those areas you'll be quite confident\nin but you should still review those.\n\n35\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.520\nSo if I click on Show all it expands and\nyou can see here under each objective\n\n36\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.200\ndomain for example design SharePoint\ninfrastructure, we get into very explicit\n\n37\n00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.970\ndetail about what you need to be\nconfident on and have skills in hands on.\n\n38\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.170\nNow some of them are designed related type\nquestions you'll get, so the hands on\n\n39\n00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.827\nwould be more architecturally planning and\nknowing architectural models for example.\n\n40\n00:02:30.827 --> 00:02:32.264\nSo, we're not going to\ngo through all of these.\n\n41\n00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:37.055\nJust my main point is to get you onto\nthis page ASAP in your exam journey for\n\n42\n00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.268\nwhatever exam you're writing.\n\n43\n00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:41.304\nFind out what the test is on.\n\n44\n00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:42.287\nPretty fundamental, right?\n\n45\n00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.499\nA lot of people thought well,\nI'll just do the courses first,\n\n46\n00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:45.471\nthen I'll think about it.\n\n47\n00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:49.390\nBy reviewing all the exam objectives and\nreading the content.\n\n48\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.150\nIt'll make your ears perk up when you hear\nconcepts related to those exam objectives,\n\n49\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.522\nso it's never too early to start\npreparing for the exam objectives.\n\n50\n00:02:57.522 --> 00:03:00.740\nAll right, that said, let's talk\nabout what we're covering this week.\n\n51\n00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.070\nWe've got a lot to cover.\n\n52\n00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.060\nSo we'll look at four\narchitectural models of SharePoint.\n\n53\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.230\nAlways, exam fodder is new functionality\nand change functionality, deprecated.\n\n54\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.140\nMaybe new names for the old things.\n\n55\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.420\nSo any changes compared to\nthe previous version is fair game and\n\n56\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.050\nyou can expect questions\ndesigned to confuse you\n\n57\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.210\ninto perhaps selecting an answer\nthat used to be correct.\n\n58\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.620\nFor example, SharePoint 2013.\n\n59\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.279\nBut now in the new era\nis no longer correct.\n\n60\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.590\nSo core Microsoft SharePoint\nconcepts we'll review as well,\n\n61\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.170\nhybrid scenarios are a huge part\nof Microsoft's way forward,\n\n62\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.650\nmost of the investment in new design,\nnew technologies,\n\n63\n00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.750\nnew productivity apps, for example,\nhappens in the hybrid world,\n\n64\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.970\nwith SharePoint online,\na combination of online and on print.\n\n65\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.760\nSo we'll look at hybrid architectures, and\nconfiguring one drive and one drive for\n\n66\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.210\nbusiness, as well.\n\n67\n00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.840\nWe'll also look at business\ncontinuity management.\n\n68\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.390\nAlways in season.\n\n69\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.780\nYou might be subject to a disaster.\n\n70\n00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.160\nYour data center may burn to a crisp.\n\n71\n00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.340\nWhat's your strategy?\n\n72\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.630\nSo we'll look at various\nhigh-availability strategies,\n\n73\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.060\nboth local and maybe geolocated\nsomewhere else beyond where you are.\n\n74\n00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.748\nWe'll look at the benefit of using\nAzure as a DR site, if you will.\n\n75\n00:04:17.748 --> 00:04:21.261\nAnd various back-up and restore plans,\n\n76\n00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:27.500\nvarious SQL topologies which will help\nyou in your back-up and DR rules.\n\n77\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.180\nWe'll also look at business connectivity\nservices in secure store service.\n\n78\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.609\nSo the ability to connect in to any\norganized data source creating middleware,\n\n79\n00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:40.840\nessentially, connect in to that other\ndata source and the secure storage server\n\n80\n00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.740\nstores credentials used to\naccess the other data source.\n\n81\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.430\nThe benefit here is that, individual users\ncan access a variety of data repositories\n\n82\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.330\nto do their work or pulling in data for\nreports for example.\n\n83\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.740\nDon't spend half their\ntime authenticating.\n\n84\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.550\nSo we can move towards the holy grail of\nsingle sign-on by leveraging the secure\n\n85\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.950\nstore service.\n\n86\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.420\nWe'll also look at productivity services,\nso we'll look at SharePoint apps and\n\n87\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.480\nthe app architecture.\n\n88\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.800\nAccess services, PowerPoint automation\nservices, Word automation services.\n\n89\n00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.010\nAnd we'll talk about solutions\nas a way of introducing\n\n90\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.870\nfunctionality in your\nSharePoint environment.\n\n91\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.060\nConnecting people, so\nwe'll talk about planning user profiles,\n\n92\n00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.520\nmy sites, profile synchronization.\n\n93\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.900\nWe'll look at community sites as a way\nof setting up discussion boards and\n\n94\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.310\nfostering knowledge exchange\nwithin your organization.\n\n95\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.570\nWeb content managements\nwe'll look at as well.\n\n96\n00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.650\nSo especially considerations regarding\nmultiple locals and languages.\n\n97\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.740\nWe'll look at managed navigation and\ncatalog sites.\n\n98\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.700\nAnd web content management is part of\nenterprise content management we'll look\n\n99\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.478\nat that as well.\n\n100\n00:05:54.478 --> 00:05:57.620\nSo including e-discovery for\n\n101\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.640\nlegal discovery, records management\nwe'll cover in that episode as well.\n\n102\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.930\nAnd site based retention policies.\n\n103\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.840\nWe'll also look at some BI solutions,\nsome really cool BI technologies like\n\n104\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.590\nPower BI for example,\nwe can leverage within Office 365, so\n\n105\n00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.440\na variety of business intelligence tools\nare available to us and productivity.\n\n106\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.880\nSo we'll look at integration with\nSharePoint and project server and\n\n107\n00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.770\nalso project team sites.\n\n108\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.690\nWe'll show you how to set those up and\n\n109\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.580\nproject server integration\nwe'll talk about as well.\n\n110\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.030\nAnd also upgrading and\nmigrating to SharePoint 2016.\n\n111\n00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.020\nSo we'll look at planning considerations\nbefore you consider upgrading and\n\n112\n00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.220\nthe flexibility in terms of\nsite collection upgrades and\n\n113\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.660\nthen some advanced scenarios, as well.\n\n114\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.440\nSo all this and more is coming at\nyou in these series of episodes.\n\n115\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.630\n>> All right, Mark.\n\n116\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.260\nFantastic, you've got me excited\nabout Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n117\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.930\nI hope you are excited as I am,\nso we are ready to get started.\n\n118\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.945\nHope to see you there.\n\n119\n00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:11.704\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:20.411\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing our advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:23.470\nAnd specifically in this\nepisode we're gonna\n\n5\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.720\nbe looking at Architectural design right?\n\n6\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.800\nA very important part of\nplanning our SharePoint\n\n7\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.360\narchitecture is figuring out what we need.\n\n8\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.510\nHow we're going to lay all that out and\n\n9\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.450\nhere to help us with that is\nnone other than Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n10\n00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.290\nHow you doing Mark?\n\n11\n00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.830\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much,\ngood to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.140\nSo many of you have watched\nthe first course on SharePoint 2016.\n\n13\n00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.155\nThis is the advanced course,\nadvanced meaning more thinking required.\n\n14\n00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.225\nFor some of you it's good news,\nfor some it's bad news.\n\n15\n00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:56.610\n[LAUGH] As IT admins,\nif you're like me, at\n\n16\n00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.230\nleast the old me, was very keen on\ngetting hands on technology immediately.\n\n17\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.215\nPlanning's for other people.\n\n18\n00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:05.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So is documentation for that matter,\n\n19\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.830\nbut no, if you're gonna progress\non from basic admin roles,\n\n20\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.560\nplanning and governance becomes more\na part of your day to day role.\n\n21\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.630\nThe actual doing, which we showed you\na lot of in the first course, and there'll\n\n22\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.420\ncertainly be lots more demos this week,\nthe actual doing, people can do that.\n\n23\n00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.150\nThere's often guidance, checklist to\nfollow, but the planning in governance.\n\n24\n00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.040\nThat's where people fall down and as\nthe saying goes, you don't time to plan,\n\n25\n00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.575\nyou have to make time to plan later\nafter you've already deployed.\n\n26\n00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:42.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then it becomes more expensive and\n\n27\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.650\nmore of a headache\n>> To undo or\n\n28\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.380\npatch your existing environment in some\nkind of model which is not optimal.\n\n29\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.350\nSo I realize that not everyone watching\nwill be starting fresh with their\n\n30\n00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.260\nSharePoint environment.\n\n31\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.932\nYou may have an older version of\nSharePoint, hopefully not 2001.\n\n32\n00:01:57.932 --> 00:02:01.099\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But let's say, more realistically,\n\n33\n00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.880\n2007 or 2010 or 2013.\n\n34\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.550\nAnd some of you may be\nlooking to upgrade as well.\n\n35\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.415\nSo our last module this week, actually, is\non upgrading from SharePoint 2013 to 2016.\n\n36\n00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:19.100\nThat being said in the planning realm\nwe have to consider architecture.\n\n37\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.730\nNow that's a fundamental decision\nthat has to be made up front\n\n38\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.960\nbecause it'll affect\nother design decisions.\n\n39\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.780\nNow in the old days of\nSharePoint back in the 2001,\n\n40\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.450\n2003 era some of you may have been\naround that long in terms of SharePoint.\n\n41\n00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.420\nWe had a lot less flexibility.\n\n42\n00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.900\nIn other words whatever architectural\nmodel you chose in the beginning\n\n43\n00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.140\nyou were stuck with absent\nsome major hacks that\n\n44\n00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.960\nit would have been easier just to\nstart over with a brand new farm.\n\n45\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.750\n>> I remember being a newbie at SharePoint\nand you would install and one of\n\n46\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.610\nthe first things you had to choose was is\nthis going to be a stand alone or a farm.\n\n47\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.590\nAnd it gave you this big warning that\nyou can not change this after the fact.\n\n48\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.860\nAnd I remember freezing right there and\n\n49\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.620\ngoing, okay, I can't go any further cause\nI don't know which decision is right.\n\n50\n00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.610\n>> It's a good thing your froze, because\na lot of people would say I can't stand\n\n51\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.735\nthe uncertainty, i'm just gonna pick one.\n\n52\n00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:09.642\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I am hoping the boss did not find out\n\n53\n00:03:09.642 --> 00:03:11.540\nor I hope I made the right choice.\n\n54\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.160\nWell, with this episode we are gonna\nhelp you make the right choice for\n\n55\n00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.830\nyour business and if you are a consultant\nand you work with a variety of businesses.\n\n56\n00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.290\nWe will look at four different models,\none of which tends to be the more\n\n57\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.520\nlogical choice, if you will for a given\ncustomer or your environment at work.\n\n58\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.520\nSo let's look at those\nfour models shall we?\n\n59\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.120\nWe got again, four fundamental models\n\n60\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.050\nwhich we'll talk about in\ndetail in this episode.\n\n61\n00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.220\nAnd Mike is kindly gonna\nbring up the first model.\n\n62\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.190\n>> Very good, Diana one letter by\nnowhere we're getting this diagram from.\n\n63\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.380\nMake sure you guys can go out there and\n\n64\n00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.400\nget the same information,\nhelp you study, things like that.\n\n65\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.840\nThis is straight off a Microsoft site.\n\n66\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.790\nJust do the Google search for\nSharePoint 2016 Architectural Models.\n\n67\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.348\nYou can download the PDF and I've got\nthat already downloaded for us here, so\n\n68\n00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:07.309\nlet's start I guess,\nMark, with this diagram.\n\n69\n00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:08.634\n>> Yeah, that's perfect, thanks, Mike.\n\n70\n00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:13.774\nSo in brief, the four architectural\nmodels are SharePoint Online also known\n\n71\n00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:18.611\nas Software as a service,\nthat's the first column represented there.\n\n72\n00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:23.881\nWe'll talk about different elements\nof those columns shortly and this is\n\n73\n00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:29.670\na software as a service model, which means\nyour SharePoint is always up to date.\n\n74\n00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.130\nYou don't have to worry about patching,\nbut\n\n75\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.430\nyou do have to manage the SharePoint\ncontent, which makes sense.\n\n76\n00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.810\nActually, I'll just describe all four and\n\n77\n00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.560\nthen we'll get into\nmore detail about them.\n\n78\n00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.928\nI've got to stop myself, I'm so\nexcited to talk about the models.\n\n79\n00:04:41.928 --> 00:04:44.931\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Keep it focused on what makes sense to\n\n80\n00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:45.790\nthe viewer.\n\n81\n00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.771\nSo SharePoint hybrid, so\nyou've got SharePoint\n\n82\n00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:56.900\non premises and in online\ncomponent your SharePoint as well.\n\n83\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.080\nSo some of your SharePoint services\nare hosted by Microsoft and\n\n84\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.330\nthis is good for a couple of reasons.\n\n85\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.400\nOne is you can sort of dip\nyour toe in the water,\n\n86\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.580\nin terms of storing some of your\ncontent with SharePoint Online.\n\n87\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.270\nAnd then move workloads\nincreasingly as you become more\n\n88\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.680\ncomfortable working in\nthat online interface.\n\n89\n00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.260\nSome organizations also pull back.\n\n90\n00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.240\nSo they might have had some\nkind of workload in the clouds.\n\n91\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.330\nI know we want to manage that on premises,\nbut\n\n92\n00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.830\nwe'll move this other\nworkload to the cloud.\n\n93\n00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.690\nSo it's a flexible dynamic\nkind of architecture,\n\n94\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.600\nif you choose the SharePoint Hybrid model.\n\n95\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.030\nThe third model is SharePoint in Azure,\n\n96\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.970\nthat's the Infrastructure\nas a Service model.\n\n97\n00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.690\nThis is great for high availability.\n\n98\n00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.025\nIn other words, you can fail over to\nAzure with virtually no downtime.\n\n99\n00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:43.303\nSo you want to have an on-prem,\nthat environment fail over to Azure, and\n\n100\n00:05:43.303 --> 00:05:46.090\nalso good for your test and\nor dev environment.\n\n101\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.960\nSo that's, some of you may be familiar\nwith Azure, have some workload there or\n\n102\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.500\nbe experimenting with Azure.\n\n103\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.490\nThe fourth option is On-premesis.\n\n104\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.500\nSo we've always had that option.\n\n105\n00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.010\nYou're handling everything to\ndo the SharePoint yourself.\n\n106\n00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.120\nSo your own data center, you're handling\nbackups, you're handling SQL storage.\n\n107\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.910\nYou're handling all\nthe content of SharePoint,\n\n108\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.310\nin other words, no part of your\nSharePoint deployment lives in the Cloud.\n\n109\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.450\nSo those are the four options there.\n\n110\n00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:18.460\nNow, if we look at the diagram,\nyou'll notice several components,\n\n111\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.210\nthe first four lines actually you\ncan see that the blue box denotes.\n\n112\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.180\nThat you as an on-prem SharePoint\nadministrator are always gonna\n\n113\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.590\nbe responsible for things like data\ngovernance and rights management.\n\n114\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.140\nSo data governance,\nwho can do what with the data?\n\n115\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.200\nDo you have an information right policy?\n\n116\n00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.270\nWhat happens to all data?\n\n117\n00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.850\nDoes it just keep accumulating or\ndo you have something a workflow design\n\n118\n00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.960\nto automatically transition\nthat data to backup or\n\n119\n00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.100\narchiving or deletion or\nthings like prompting site owners.\n\n120\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.050\nAfter six months of an activity,\nsay, do you wanna delete this site?\n\n121\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.800\nSo that all falls into data governance,\nthat's always on you.\n\n122\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.400\nThere's nothing Microsoft has to say about\ndata governance, you have to decide.\n\n123\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.460\nI mean Microsoft will give\nyou perspective guidance but\n\n124\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.220\nthey're not going to do any data\ngovernance for you in your SharePoint\n\n125\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.780\nno matter if its on premises,\nin the Cloud or some combination.\n\n126\n00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:20.250\nRights management again, so in terms of\ndata in transit where is the data stored?\n\n127\n00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.470\nThat falls under rights management,\nClient end points.\n\n128\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.440\nAgain you'll always be responsible for\nmanaging those.\n\n129\n00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.650\nSo security standards,\n\n130\n00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.807\nantivirus on various devices that will\ninteract with your SharePoint environment.\n\n131\n00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:37.292\nAnd now there's so many devices that\ncan interact with SharePoint so\n\n132\n00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:40.600\nthat is a concern that again falls on you.\n\n133\n00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.882\nThe third line there,\nAccount and Access Management.\n\n134\n00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:48.955\nYou can set to be alert on unusual\nactivity, so you get to define what\n\n135\n00:07:48.955 --> 00:07:53.328\na normal baseline is, and then unusual\nactivity you can be alerted for.\n\n136\n00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:56.611\nJust like, you might be familiar with\nbanking or had the frustration of trying\n\n137\n00:07:56.611 --> 00:07:59.098\nto use your credit card When\nyou've traveled out of state,\n\n138\n00:07:59.098 --> 00:08:00.759\nand all of a sudden, you can't use it.\n\n139\n00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:04.990\nAnd you gotta call your bank, and\nthey have to make sure it's you, and\n\n140\n00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.460\nthen the fraud department unholds\nyour funds, your credit card.\n\n141\n00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.310\nSo, again, that's account and\naccess management.\n\n142\n00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.470\nYou handle that.\n\n143\n00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.200\nThe last thing that you, as a SharePoint\nadmin always manage his identity.\n\n144\n00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.280\nAnd you can have credentials\nsecured by hardware,\n\n145\n00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.980\nespecially now in\na Windows 10 environment.\n\n146\n00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.860\nMultifactor authentication you\ncan set up as well, or require.\n\n147\n00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.190\nSo some combination of something you are,\nso retinal scan, or\n\n148\n00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.100\nWindows Hello,\nfacial recognition, for example.\n\n149\n00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.240\nSomething you have so\n\n150\n00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.770\nthat can be a smartcard and something,\nit's a password so or a pin.\n\n151\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.250\nOkay, so Windows 10 machines you can enter\na four digit pin instead of a lengthy\n\n152\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.770\npassword.\n\n153\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.080\nAnd actually have that be more secure\nwhich is a whole other concept.\n\n154\n00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.050\nBut the point is, you get to say about\nidentity who gets to access what\n\n155\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.770\nan how users are authenticated.\n\n156\n00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.287\nAlright, now looking at some of the other\noptions here we can see that on pram,\n\n157\n00:09:00.287 --> 00:09:04.257\nagain, you're managing all those\nvarious roles, applications,\n\n158\n00:09:04.257 --> 00:09:08.845\ndirectory instructor, physical hosts,\nphysical network and data center and\n\n159\n00:09:08.845 --> 00:09:12.979\nthen online, it's just the first\nfour that you're responsible for.\n\n160\n00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:18.348\nAnd then with hybrid SharePoint online and\non pram and then also the Azure option.\n\n161\n00:09:18.348 --> 00:09:22.332\nYou're managing some but Microsoft is\ntaking a lot of that workload away from\n\n162\n00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:25.560\nyou which is great if\nyou're a small environment.\n\n163\n00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.433\nSo, let's now move on to our next\ngraphic which is get a little picture or\n\n164\n00:09:31.433 --> 00:09:38.008\nrepresentation where it looks like\narchitecturally using SharePoint Online.\n\n165\n00:09:38.008 --> 00:09:43.541\nSo in this case, Microsoft host\nyour user accounts through 0365.\n\n166\n00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:49.135\nSome of you may already be\ntesting out your 0365 deployment.\n\n167\n00:09:49.135 --> 00:09:53.800\nThere is a great onboarding procedure\nMicrosoft has established for\n\n168\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.970\nfast tracking.\n\n169\n00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.450\nYour organizations moved to 0365.\n\n170\n00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.709\nOthers are in a test mode.\n\n171\n00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:07.226\nAnd you can see there we have an Azure\nactive directory tenant as well included.\n\n172\n00:10:07.226 --> 00:10:09.590\nNow, why would you choose this option?\n\n173\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.440\nWell, as O365 implies, if you know\nanything about it means Microsoft is\n\n174\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.630\nhandling the hassle of\nmanaging the infrastructure.\n\n175\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:21.000\nYou're just responsible for\nyour users and then information.\n\n176\n00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.400\nYou know what information\nshould be made available there,\n\n177\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.310\nhow much room to allocate for\nresources, that sort of thing.\n\n178\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.230\nNow, software as a service means that\nthe features are constantly being updated.\n\n179\n00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.670\nThis could be a plus and a minus.\n\n180\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.690\nIf you like to test out and\nyou're frustrated by any\n\n181\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:45.890\nunannounced changes, then maybe\nthis is not the solution for you.\n\n182\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.390\nSo we live in what I\ncall a beta test world.\n\n183\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:53.360\nIf you use Facebook and all or\nLinkedIn O-365, SharePoint Online.\n\n184\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.880\nIt seems that every single day,\nor at least every week,\n\n185\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.660\nthere's something that's changed.\n\n186\n00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.040\nYou have a familiar way of doing things,\nfor\n\n187\n00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.053\ncertain menu options, and then all of\na sudden an option's not there anymore.\n\n188\n00:11:02.053 --> 00:11:03.470\nOr, exists.\n\n189\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.190\nOr, the look and\nfeel is slightly different.\n\n190\n00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.250\nOr, this gear icon moved.\n\n191\n00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.306\nIf you've read the book,\n\n192\n00:11:08.306 --> 00:11:09.453\nWho moved my cheese,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:11:09.453 --> 00:11:11.636\n>> You'll notice it's totally a normal\n\n194\n00:11:11.636 --> 00:11:14.780\nhuman reaction to be somewhat\nfrustrated by changes.\n\n195\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.139\nEspecially if they're unexpected.\n\n196\n00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:20.512\nWhat I'm telling you is expect\nthe unexpected if you're using Office 365.\n\n197\n00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:22.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It can still irritate you but\n\n198\n00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.370\nat least you wont be surprised.\n\n199\n00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.090\nIn other words, they're always testing.\n\n200\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.700\nNow some of the features they\nmight introduce in Office 365,\n\n201\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.530\nMicrosoft introduces, may or\nmay not survive long term.\n\n202\n00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.048\nSo if you see a new feature,\nyou might be one of the guinea pigs.\n\n203\n00:11:38.048 --> 00:11:42.824\nRight, so my point is that's what you're\nsigning on for, you're signing on for\n\n204\n00:11:42.824 --> 00:11:46.510\nconstant changing but\nyou also get the patching which is nice.\n\n205\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.520\nSo you can worry less about\nthe infrastructure SharePoint and\n\n206\n00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.410\nmore on managing user access,\nsite collection,\n\n207\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.310\nmanaging permissions, and storage, etc.\n\n208\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.680\nSo Microsoft takes over a lot\nof the extra work there.\n\n209\n00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.000\nAnd another benefit is users can log on\nwith a Microsoft account from anywhere.\n\n210\n00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.590\nSo the more powerful our machines get,\nthe more users are expecting to get\n\n211\n00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:18.320\ndesktop like functionality from\na variety of devices, tablets, PDAs,\n\n212\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.420\nphones, tables, there's such a blurring\nof what's a computer now days.\n\n213\n00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.027\nRight?\n\n214\n00:12:24.027 --> 00:12:29.501\nSo this article I read this morning on\nApple versus Microsoft and how there\n\n215\n00:12:29.501 --> 00:12:35.519\nare different bets on without knowing\nthe exact form factors are going to exist.\n\n216\n00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:36.990\nMaking sure that both Apple and\n\n217\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.660\nMicrosoft are going to be part\nof the world as it exists.\n\n218\n00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.080\nAnd for Microsoft certainly Azure and\nHoloLens and\n\n219\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.730\nother technologies they're betting on.\n\n220\n00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.380\nBut I digress.\n\n221\n00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.306\nIt won't be the first digression but\n\n222\n00:12:48.306 --> 00:12:51.732\nI promise digressions will be\nmany percent technology related.\n\n223\n00:12:51.732 --> 00:12:53.468\n>> [LAUGH] That was good.\n\n224\n00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:57.928\n>> Yes, quite the thing with SharePoint as\nwell is that so many technologies feed in\n\n225\n00:12:57.928 --> 00:13:01.141\nand relate to it that it's a,\neasy to go off on a tangent and\n\n226\n00:13:01.141 --> 00:13:05.668\nbe relevant to your real work deployment\nof SharePoint and the exam as well because\n\n227\n00:13:05.668 --> 00:13:10.165\nI know a lot of you are watching because\nyou want to become SharePoint certified.\n\n228\n00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:12.725\nSo we're also reference often this week\n\n229\n00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:18.175\nexam related specifics without\nobviously giving away questions.\n\n230\n00:13:18.175 --> 00:13:22.195\nOkay, what else do you get\nwith O365 support for HTTPS?\n\n231\n00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:25.460\nIn other words, port 443 and\n\n232\n00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.360\nwe can customize with apps for\nOffice and SharePoint.\n\n233\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.830\nWe talked about apps in the first course.\n\n234\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.300\nWe'll certainly have more,\nmore talk about apps.\n\n235\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.680\nProductivity apps and\nthe like this week, as well.\n\n236\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.380\nAnd, again,\nMicrosoft's data center handles your data.\n\n237\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.790\nThey handle the replication and\nthe high availability.\n\n238\n00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.570\nSo that they financially back\ntheir availability guarantee.\n\n239\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.280\nNow, that might be another reason to maybe\nstay away from the cloud, is that, if\n\n240\n00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.590\neverything's hosted on premises, there's\none or two next to ring, as it were.\n\n241\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.155\nRight?\n\n242\n00:13:56.155 --> 00:13:57.761\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if it's Microsoft,\n\n243\n00:13:57.761 --> 00:14:02.228\nit's obviously in their best interest\nto keep high-availability going, but\n\n244\n00:14:02.228 --> 00:14:07.228\nthey don't guarantee it beyond 99.9,\nor 99.99 Depending on your agreement,\n\n245\n00:14:07.228 --> 00:14:10.028\nwhich means they're essentially admitting,\nor\n\n246\n00:14:10.028 --> 00:14:13.020\nsaying in advice there\nwill be some down time.\n\n247\n00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.710\nAnd if you ever tried to send an email, or\njust do Routine Activities Note 365, or\n\n248\n00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:21.260\nshare point online and\nyou can't do it temporarily.\n\n249\n00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.670\nSometimes there's an air message,\nsometimes not.\n\n250\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.520\nWell that's, it's highly likely\nthat a certain service is down or\n\n251\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.550\nperhaps it's down in your region only.\n\n252\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:34.400\nMicrosoft does provide a dashboard we\ncan see the availability of various\n\n253\n00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.890\nservices through various\nregions through out the world.\n\n254\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.110\nAnd it, frankly it's several\nscreens to scroll down to,\n\n255\n00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.940\nthat might help you understand\nwhy you can't do a certain thing.\n\n256\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.310\nBut again,\nMicrosoft is responsible for all that.\n\n257\n00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.180\nNow why would you choose this\nparticular architectural option?\n\n258\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.660\nWell let's say you don't wanna do anything\non prem, or you don't wanna have an on\n\n259\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.970\npremises directory like Active Directory,\nfor example.\n\n260\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.780\nOr you dont have the budget for\nIT infrastructure, or the expertise.\n\n261\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.960\nYou weren't planning on hiring a an IT\nadmin guy or SQL database guy or gal.\n\n262\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:14.840\nThat would lead you to toward this as\na prefered architectural solution.\n\n263\n00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.550\nThe SharePoint online option.\n\n264\n00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.890\nIn terms of licensing,\n\n265\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.370\nwe always have to be cognizant of\nlicensing since it's a subscription model,\n\n266\n00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:27.210\nso it's a pay per user per month model so\nno additional licenses are needed, so\n\n267\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.880\nagain, let's say you're a start up, you've\ngot so many balls you're juggling anyway,\n\n268\n00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.110\ndistribution, contracts,\nhiring, marketing, sales.\n\n269\n00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.870\nI mean you're not gonna hire\nsomeone to handle licenses.\n\n270\n00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.970\nRight?\nJust one more thing you can off load.\n\n271\n00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.549\nSo, that's a benefit\nto that model as well.\n\n272\n00:15:45.549 --> 00:15:51.386\nOkay, now, architecture tasks, from your\nperspective as an on-prem administrator,\n\n273\n00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:56.302\nor on-prem/cloud admin, you want to\nplan and design implementation with\n\n274\n00:15:56.302 --> 00:16:01.679\nAzure Active Directory, so you can\nsynchronize your on-prem Active Directory,\n\n275\n00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:05.559\nif you have one,\nwith Active Directory hosted in Azure..\n\n276\n00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:08.464\nYou'd still need to make\nsure that whatever,\n\n277\n00:16:08.464 --> 00:16:11.517\nif you have on-prem\nresources are accessible,\n\n278\n00:16:11.517 --> 00:16:15.840\nyou may want to go the route of\ngetting third party SSL certificates.\n\n279\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.020\nAnd you'll have to plan the tenant\nname for Azure Active Directory.\n\n280\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.950\nYou still gonna have to plan your site\ncollection, architecture and governance.\n\n281\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:29.410\nRemember, as I said before,\nMicrosoft does so much on the hardware or\n\n282\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.170\nthe hosting end, but it doesn't abrogate\n\n283\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.780\nyou of your responsibility to\nmake the governance decisions.\n\n284\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.850\nOr if not you,\nyou need to implement them as an IT admin.\n\n285\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:44.320\nNow often, in terms of some kinda\nplanning committee for governance,\n\n286\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.820\nas an IT admin, you or someone like you\nis probably gonna be on that committee.\n\n287\n00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:55.480\nBut the mistake a lot of businesses\nmake is, let's say I'm a COO or a CEO.\n\n288\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.420\nIf they see SharePoint as an IT function,\nthat's a mistake.\n\n289\n00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.640\nBecause they need to be making\nthose decisions on governance.\n\n290\n00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.380\nIT can implement it, no problem.\n\n291\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.540\nBut it's not up to IT to make\nthe call on who should access what.\n\n292\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.800\nSo that is a common misperception and\n\n293\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.150\nfrankly a reason why certain SharePoint\ndeployments go bad is that the C-level,\n\n294\n00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.500\nthey do not understand or\nit hasn't been impressed upon them.\n\n295\n00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.603\nSo that's one of your roles is to\nsell the C-level on the benefits and\n\n296\n00:17:25.603 --> 00:17:30.010\ngovernance and the fact that they,\nnot you need to make those decisions.\n\n297\n00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.730\nYou can certainly have recommendations\nfrom your experience with SharePoint, but\n\n298\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.260\nit effects the whole organization.\n\n299\n00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.020\nThat's why someone at the C-level, or\n\n300\n00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.650\nmore than one people, one person\nat the C-level should be involved.\n\n301\n00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.720\nAnother thing you have to do in\nterms of architecture tasks for\n\n302\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.878\nyou on-prem is any customizations,\nsolutions and apps.\n\n303\n00:17:48.878 --> 00:17:53.590\nMay work on-prem, may not work so\nwell with SharePoint online.\n\n304\n00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.960\nSo one of the trade-offs, if you go\nto SharePoint online, you don't get\n\n305\n00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.560\nthe full functionality that you would\nwith an on-prem deployment of SharePoint.\n\n306\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.250\nThat might not be a big deal for you.\n\n307\n00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.110\nAgain, if you're a start-up,\nmaybe you don't have any customizations,\n\n308\n00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.170\nat least in the beginning.\n\n309\n00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.230\nSo that's not gonna be a problem.\n\n310\n00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:09.750\nBut, if you're an established company,\n\n311\n00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.830\nmaybe you've been using SharePoint\nsince 2007 for example.\n\n312\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:17.140\nAnd you're used to the process of\nre-coding any customizations or\n\n313\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:22.230\nweb parts and the like, to work with\nsuccessive versions of SharePoint on-prem.\n\n314\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.940\nWell, not all of those are gonna\nwork with SharePoint Online.\n\n315\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.460\nSo then you have to decide,\ncan we live without this customization?\n\n316\n00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.875\nOr, well we need to pull that work load or\nmaintain it on-prem.\n\n317\n00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:33.435\nAll right.\n\n318\n00:18:33.435 --> 00:18:37.195\nNow, let's move on to our\nSharePoint hybrid environment,\n\n319\n00:18:37.195 --> 00:18:40.250\nsince I kind of alluded to\nthat in the last few minutes.\n\n320\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.415\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:18:41.415 --> 00:18:44.675\n>> So this is great because it lets you\n\n322\n00:18:45.855 --> 00:18:48.155\nmove workloads to\nthe cloud at your own pace.\n\n323\n00:18:48.155 --> 00:18:51.270\nThis is a useful slide here.\n\n324\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.250\nSo, we can see on the left we have\nthe 0 365, the SharePoint Online there,\n\n325\n00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.780\nand the Azure Active Directory Tenant,\nwe had that in the last slide.\n\n326\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.780\nBut now, because a hybrid environment\nover on the right-hand side,\n\n327\n00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.980\nin the gray there where\nit says On-premises.\n\n328\n00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:11.470\nWe've got a farm on-prem,\nthat's the grouping there of five servers.\n\n329\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.160\nIt's just a symbol.\n\n330\n00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.324\nIt doesn't mean we need five servers.\n\n331\n00:19:13.324 --> 00:19:14.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I almost said cluster but\n\n332\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.480\nthat would be misleading.\n\n333\n00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.810\nSo a group of five servers in your farm.\n\n334\n00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.370\nFor example, and\nthen you can see outbound requests so\n\n335\n00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:24.850\nthere's a line going across\nthe screen from right to left.\n\n336\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.750\nRequest headed to SharePoint online.\n\n337\n00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.530\nAnd directory synchronization,\nthis is important.\n\n338\n00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.580\nYou want single sign-on, so people can\nsign on with the same credentials.\n\n339\n00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:39.240\nWhether they're accessing content on-prem,\nor online through Microsoft Azure.\n\n340\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.799\nAnd we also have Active Directory\nFederation Services enabled as well,\n\n341\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.890\nso this is a nice flexible model.\n\n342\n00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:50.560\nWhy?\n\n343\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.050\nYou can start slowly,\nmaybe you're ramping up skills, frankly,\n\n344\n00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.610\nunderstanding how to utilize Office 365 so\nyou don't want to move everyone, let's say\n\n345\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.640\nyou have 1,000 employees, you don't want\nto move everyone to the cloud right away.\n\n346\n00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.310\nYou're gonna have some test group, maybe\nof 20 users asnd when you're choosing\n\n347\n00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.135\na test group, make sure it's people\nthat aren't likely to freak out.\n\n348\n00:20:10.135 --> 00:20:11.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which could include, but\n\n349\n00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.250\nnot necessarily people in the IT,\ncuz we're all users, too, right?\n\n350\n00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.710\nWe're more knowledgeable\nthan the average user, but\n\n351\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.150\nat the end of the day we're still users.\n\n352\n00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.770\nWe want to have a seamless experience for\neveryone, where possible.\n\n353\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.020\nOkay, so we're gonna do a little trial.\n\n354\n00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.120\nAnd then, as time goes on,\nwe get more comfortable.\n\n355\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.109\nMaybe we're moving everyone to the cloud.\n\n356\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.890\nWe're hosting more site collections and\nother resources in the cloud,\n\n357\n00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.340\nand people are getting used to search\nfunctionality, and the ability to search\n\n358\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.250\nonce and have results come from\neither on-prem or on the cloud.\n\n359\n00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.559\nAll right, so speaking of search.\n\n360\n00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:50.203\nAgain, we can run search against\nthe whole SharePoint environment,\n\n361\n00:20:50.203 --> 00:20:54.093\nwhich wasn't always the case it was\na bit kludgy before, in terms of having\n\n362\n00:20:54.093 --> 00:20:57.760\nto actually execute separate searches for\non-prem and in the cloud.\n\n363\n00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:03.340\nAnd in terms of user adoption,\nanyone that's used a web browser,\n\n364\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:08.110\nany kind of Office documents is not\ngoing to be flummoxed by Office 365.\n\n365\n00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.760\nThere's the word of the day.\n\n366\n00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.670\n>> That's a good one, yeah.\n\n367\n00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.880\n>> I don't know where it came from.\n\n368\n00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.170\nToo much Scrabble playing,\nDave, I don't know.\n\n369\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:18.528\nAnyway, again you'll probably get some\nhelp desk calls though because actions\n\n370\n00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:21.538\nusers could take on-prem and\ncan still take on-prem,\n\n371\n00:21:21.538 --> 00:21:24.310\nthey won't be able to do\nnecessarily in the cloud.\n\n372\n00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.860\nSo there's gonna be a learning curve.\n\n373\n00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.800\nSo I always stress this.\n\n374\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.110\nIf you don't have end-user training as\npart of your SharePoint deployment,\n\n375\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:37.290\nit's not gonna succeed, or\nthe success of it will be greatly limited.\n\n376\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:42.620\nI'm not saying you need formal training,\ncertainly watching videos,\n\n377\n00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.810\nmaybe you're doing a lunch and\nlearn session.\n\n378\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.218\nThree days a week, one week, and\ncome learn about SharePoint.\n\n379\n00:21:49.218 --> 00:21:52.900\nThey use to a little demo, or maybe it's\na video you put up on your intranet.\n\n380\n00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.660\nBut you can't just throw people in a new\nenvironment and give them some emails.\n\n381\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.380\nThey will need some hand-holding.\n\n382\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.770\nAnother strategy that's very useful for\nSharePoint, or\n\n383\n00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:05.920\nany new technology deployment is\nyou give people a lot of lead time.\n\n384\n00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.940\nAnnounce when a change is going to occur\nand then you make a resource, one or\n\n385\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:15.700\ntwo people per office depending on your\nsize, make them available to walk around\n\n386\n00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:20.010\nfor a day say, to help people as\nthey learn to use the new system.\n\n387\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.740\nPeople will sabotage your efforts.\n\n388\n00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.484\nMyself included, we generally hate change,\n\n389\n00:22:26.484 --> 00:22:30.810\neven intellectually now this change is for\nthe better.\n\n390\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.900\nThis is going to be better,\nI know it's better.\n\n391\n00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.910\nIntellectually, to\nunderstand it is better.\n\n392\n00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.070\nStill there's a resistance.\n\n393\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.530\nSo make it easy on people.\n\n394\n00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.620\nProvide formal or informal training or\nhave someone available.\n\n395\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:47.300\nIf you don't do it that way, you're gonna\nget de facto training by someone who\n\n396\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.560\nappears to know more than anyone\nelse in their particular work area.\n\n397\n00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.220\nAnd they'll be bugged consistently because\nyou didn't assign or create a formal or\n\n398\n00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.444\ninformal training environment.\n\n399\n00:22:56.444 --> 00:22:58.720\nSo there's going to be some\nkind of training going on,\n\n400\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.720\nit might as well be training from\nsomeone that knows what they're doing.\n\n401\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.360\nRight?\n\n402\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.505\nSo maybe, again, maybe you train up one or\ntwo people for a department, and they,\n\n403\n00:23:06.505 --> 00:23:10.655\nsort of train the trainer format, they get\na authorized and encourage and required\n\n404\n00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:14.975\nfrankly, to train other users in the\ndepartment on the new way of doing things.\n\n405\n00:23:14.975 --> 00:23:19.275\nOkay, so search,\nanother thing is it's useful with hybrid.\n\n406\n00:23:19.275 --> 00:23:24.045\nOneDrive for Business, now there have\nbeen some problems with OneDrive which\n\n407\n00:23:24.045 --> 00:23:28.480\nmany of them have been fixed and we'll\nlook at this as we go later in the week.\n\n408\n00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.850\nAnd it's called now OneDrive for\nBusiness redirect.\n\n409\n00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.880\nIt used to be SkyDrive.\n\n410\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.710\nAnd then through trademark\nlitigation Microsoft lost, so\n\n411\n00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.630\nthey had to change the name to OneDrive.\n\n412\n00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.060\nAnd now OneDrive for Business.\n\n413\n00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.280\nThe idea if you've used Dropbox\nyou kind of get the idea.\n\n414\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.590\nAnd in terms of the redirect,\nthat means users may\n\n415\n00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.530\nthink they're saving on-prem, but\nit's actually being stored in the Cloud.\n\n416\n00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.625\nJust like folders\nare redirection of desktop.\n\n417\n00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:57.320\nRight, so\nagain with a more common Windows example,\n\n418\n00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.188\npeople have a folder on the desktop,\nthey assume that.\n\n419\n00:24:01.188 --> 00:24:05.813\nWhatever content they put there lives on,\nis stored on the desktop, but no,\n\n420\n00:24:05.813 --> 00:24:10.726\nthrough policy setting, we can make sure\nany content that gets saved there goes to\n\n421\n00:24:10.726 --> 00:24:15.351\na file folder on a file server where it\ncan be properly backed up and checked for\n\n422\n00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:17.920\ncompliance or audited or what have you.\n\n423\n00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.240\nSame idea with one drive for\nbusiness redirect.\n\n424\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.580\nThis way you are putting that\nstorage in the cloud with all\n\n425\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:30.350\nthe high availability and built-in\nbackup capability that that entails.\n\n426\n00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.480\nNow again, it's a workload.\n\n427\n00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.610\nIt's gonna cost you some\nmoney to put in the cloud.\n\n428\n00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.560\nIt may or may not be worth the money\ncompared to buying more storage on-prem.\n\n429\n00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.100\nSo my point is,\nthere's lots of design decisions to make.\n\n430\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:50.250\nAnd then some cloud services through\nOffice 365 include Office 365 video.\n\n431\n00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.630\nThat's kind of cool, because as you know,\n\n432\n00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.370\nbecause you're watching this episode,\npeople love to learn from video.\n\n433\n00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.340\nOr be entertained or\nhave information communicated that way.\n\n434\n00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.320\nSo the video is not going away.\n\n435\n00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.410\nIt's growing, becoming increasingly\npopular whether it's YouTube videos,\n\n436\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.980\nFacebook Live Facebook streams now.\n\n437\n00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.750\nI forget what they call it,\nFacebook Live or something.\n\n438\n00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.920\nEven MPR is live and\n\n439\n00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:18.100\nnow it's frankly cluttered up my Facebook\nfeed, but the point is people love video.\n\n440\n00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.740\nAnd a lot of organizations,\n\n441\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.049\nthey wouldn't necessarily want\nto invest in storage space.\n\n442\n00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.320\nBut with Office 365 it's very flexible,\nand a great thing about Azure and\n\n443\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.440\nSharePoint online and Office 365,\nit's pay for what you use.\n\n444\n00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.640\nIt lets you ramp up and\n\n445\n00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.340\nscale back very easily on the fly,\nwell not really on the fly.\n\n446\n00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.610\nIt's a very flexible solution as\nopposed to budgeting, planning,\n\n447\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.250\nrequesting funding for, say,\na few terabytes more storage on-prem.\n\n448\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.200\nWell that could take a year, right,\ndepending on the bureaucracy and\n\n449\n00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.400\nhow big your organization is.\n\n450\n00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.170\nSo Delve is very cool, the Office graph,\n\n451\n00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.740\nthis is available to you\nin a hybrid environment.\n\n452\n00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.200\nAnd it's like Facebook\ngraph if you used that.\n\n453\n00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.390\nRemember Microsoft bought 5% of Facebook.\n\n454\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:07.550\nSo you're going to see some cross\npollination just like all companies,\n\n455\n00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.060\nborrow, steal, reinvent from others.\n\n456\n00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.080\nSo this is a great way for\nusers to find out information\n\n457\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.350\nabout other people in their organization\nor filter based on various parameters.\n\n458\n00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.640\nJust like you could with office graph.\n\n459\n00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.497\nSo what would be the benefit or\n\n460\n00:26:23.497 --> 00:26:27.823\nwhat kind of people should gravitate\ntowards a hybrid environment?\n\n461\n00:26:27.823 --> 00:26:32.906\nAgain, you can move workloads\nto the cloud at your own pace,\n\n462\n00:26:32.906 --> 00:26:36.030\nyou may not wanna set up an extranet.\n\n463\n00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.461\nSo if you were called from\nthe first SharePoint week,\n\n464\n00:26:39.461 --> 00:26:44.414\nit can be quite cumbersome to set up\nexternal sharing or set up an extranet, or\n\n465\n00:26:44.414 --> 00:26:49.677\nprovide a federated services to provide\na partner organization state with access\n\n466\n00:26:49.677 --> 00:26:54.583\nto some of your Active Directory\ninfrastructure, or resources on-prem.\n\n467\n00:26:54.583 --> 00:26:58.199\nSo instead of setting up an extranet\nyou can use Office 365 as a way\n\n468\n00:26:58.199 --> 00:27:01.310\nof setting up external sharing and\ncollaboration.\n\n469\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.750\nSo that might be of interest to you.\n\n470\n00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:09.070\nNow again, I mentioned in\n\n471\n00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.800\nuser training well it's also in\nterms of SharePoint admin skills.\n\n472\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.210\nYou want to develop those overtime and\nby using this hybrid model again,\n\n473\n00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.620\nI give an example using,\nputting twenty uses to the cloud.\n\n474\n00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.970\nOr maybe it's just you the IT admin maybe\nyou're the only user for a week or two.\n\n475\n00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.790\nAnd you're experimenting and\nknow that whatever you do it's only\n\n476\n00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.010\nprobably gonna effect you and\nnot others in your organization.\n\n477\n00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:35.780\nSo getting your skills up to speed and\nhaving an environment to do that without\n\n478\n00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.500\nrisk is another compelling reason\nto use the hybrid environment.\n\n479\n00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.210\nAnd again you might want to reduce\nyour on premises footprint.\n\n480\n00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:51.410\nSo your architecture tasks, you want to\nplan your network con activity between you\n\n481\n00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.655\non pram and your o 360 E5 environment.\n\n482\n00:27:54.655 --> 00:28:00.335\nYou will be required to set up server\nto server trusts using certificates.\n\n483\n00:28:00.335 --> 00:28:02.521\nFigure out your identity\nsynchronization model.\n\n484\n00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:06.914\nDo you wanna synchronize your on-prem\nwith Azure Active Directory, for example.\n\n485\n00:28:06.914 --> 00:28:10.502\nAre you gonna move your\nuser profiles from your\n\n486\n00:28:10.502 --> 00:28:14.004\nSharePoint online environment to O365?\n\n487\n00:28:14.004 --> 00:28:14.626\nAnd again,\n\n488\n00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:18.432\nwhat features do you wanna enable do\nwanna enable in SharePoint online?\n\n489\n00:28:18.432 --> 00:28:21.776\nWhat work loads do wanna move to the\ncloud, keep in your mind, you're not gonna\n\n490\n00:28:21.776 --> 00:28:25.936\nbe able to do everything you can on prem\nin the SharePoint online environment.\n\n491\n00:28:27.586 --> 00:28:31.306\nAnd then if you wanna use the OneDrive for\nBusiness redirect,\n\n492\n00:28:33.216 --> 00:28:38.870\nfirst decide to do that, and then plan how\nthat content is gonna move to the cloud.\n\n493\n00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.650\nIn terms of licensing requirements and\n\n494\n00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:45.160\nsubscription models with Office\n365 the subscriptions cover it.\n\n495\n00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.736\nSo again per user per month,\nno additional licensing required.\n\n496\n00:28:47.736 --> 00:28:53.638\nAnd then on-prem as you probably know\nif you've got an existing environment,\n\n497\n00:28:53.638 --> 00:28:57.250\nyou'll need your Server 2012 R2 license,\n\n498\n00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:01.302\nyour SharePoint 2016 server license and\nCALs, so\n\n499\n00:29:01.302 --> 00:29:06.961\nclient access license and their\nSQL Server 2014 SP1 license or later.\n\n500\n00:29:10.476 --> 00:29:14.025\nOkay, housekeeping.\n\n501\n00:29:14.025 --> 00:29:14.655\nI got one more.\n\n502\n00:29:14.655 --> 00:29:15.368\nI could probably [CROSSTALK]\nI got 8 minutes left.\n\n503\n00:29:15.368 --> 00:29:17.573\n>> We got one or two more models to go?\n\n504\n00:29:17.573 --> 00:29:19.605\n>> I got one more I believe.\n\n505\n00:29:19.605 --> 00:29:20.435\nNo, two.\n>> Yeah.\n\n506\n00:29:20.435 --> 00:29:21.198\n>> Yeah.\n>> We got IaaS as well.\n\n507\n00:29:21.198 --> 00:29:23.055\n>> [CROSSTALK] another episode,\nIf we could.\n\n508\n00:29:23.055 --> 00:29:24.065\n>> Very good.\n>> Yup.\n\n509\n00:29:24.065 --> 00:29:25.285\n>> All right, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n510\n00:29:25.285 --> 00:29:28.905\nAs we covered two of the four models,\nunfortunately we are out of time for\n\n511\n00:29:28.905 --> 00:29:30.095\nthis particular episode.\n\n512\n00:29:30.095 --> 00:29:31.965\nSo what we're going to do is\nwe're going to break this one.\n\n513\n00:29:31.965 --> 00:29:36.550\nWe'll come back with a part 2 and\ncover we've got the IaaS or\n\n514\n00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.070\nthe infrastructure as a service model.\n\n515\n00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.660\nAnd we've got the complete\non-prem model to go as well.\n\n516\n00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.430\nSo Mark, we thank you for\n\n517\n00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.380\nthose great discussions here\non those first two models.\n\n518\n00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.880\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n519\n00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.410\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n520\n00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:50.950\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n521\n00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.059\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:20.623\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.623 --> 00:00:25.098\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\nactually continuing our thought process,\n\n5\n00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:28.700\nthis is a part two to our SharePoint\narchitectural design, right?\n\n6\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.040\nWe've got a couple more models\nthat we've gotta go over, and\n\n7\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.170\nhere to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.010\nHow you doing, Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.360\n>> Good, Mike, thank you.\n\n10\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.630\nLet's move right along with\nour third of four models.\n\n11\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.474\nThis is the on-prem model,\nwhich many of you will be familiar with,\n\n12\n00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:46.802\nthe traditional way of getting\ninvolved with SharePoint.\n\n13\n00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:51.183\nMaybe some test environment or\nfull-fledged on-premises environment.\n\n14\n00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:54.785\nSo this may or may not look\nexactly like your environment, but\n\n15\n00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:56.820\nthe principles do apply.\n\n16\n00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.230\nYou've got some users\nclustered together there.\n\n17\n00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.250\nThey look like little chemical bonds.\n\n18\n00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.476\nMaybe if you put them together the right\nway, they make caffeine, I'm not sure.\n\n19\n00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:07.492\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Anyway, and users,\n\n20\n00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:13.805\nactually before I go there, on the bottom,\nyou can see the request arrow, so requests\n\n21\n00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:19.290\ngo from left to right in this diagram,\nand replies go from right to left.\n\n22\n00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.940\nSo in other words, the users on\nthe left are never interacting with\n\n23\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.750\nthe database server clusters directly\non the right-hand side, but rather,\n\n24\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.570\nthey interact with one or\nmore front end servers.\n\n25\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.600\nAnd in fact, for the demos that\nwe'll be seeing throughout the week,\n\n26\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.250\nthis is our on-prem\nequivalent environment,\n\n27\n00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.040\nwhere we have a representative of\nthese different layers, if you like.\n\n28\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.603\nSo we'll have a web front end server,\ndistributed cache, application server,\n\n29\n00:01:48.603 --> 00:01:51.090\nsearch server and database server.\n\n30\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.215\nSo we don't have the clustering but\nthe point is,\n\n31\n00:01:53.215 --> 00:01:56.460\nyou get the idea of the tiers\navailable in SharePoint.\n\n32\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.840\nAnd we'll talk more about that later.\n\n33\n00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.752\nI'll resist the urge to go into\nmore detail now, but the point is,\n\n34\n00:02:00.752 --> 00:02:04.081\nthis is gonna be something like what\nyour on-prem environment looks like,\n\n35\n00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.810\nif you have any kind of workload at all.\n\n36\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.597\nAnd it's not just a simple single machine\nor a two machine test environment.\n\n37\n00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:15.640\nSo, and\nit's very expandable as needed as well.\n\n38\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.139\nFlexible in terms of if\nyou want to add resources,\n\n39\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.590\noften due to poor performance or expected\ncapacity being reached for a given server.\n\n40\n00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.960\n>> And with an architecture like this, it\nlooks like it would really lead itself or\n\n41\n00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.620\nlend itself to be enabled to expand\none particular area, not everything.\n\n42\n00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.320\nIf I found that my front ends\nweren't carrying the workload right,\n\n43\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.660\nI can add a front end server.\n\n44\n00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.140\nIt's not gonna affect my\ndatabase in the back.\n\n45\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.990\n>> Exactly, so\nyou've got that flexibility.\n\n46\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.760\nAnd you'll always be measuring as well.\n\n47\n00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.360\nThere's a built in measuring tool\nthat SharePoint has to alert you.\n\n48\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.930\nAnd then, as we talked about\nextensively in the first course,\n\n49\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.590\nSystems Center Operations Manager has a\nmanagement pack just for SharePoint 2016.\n\n50\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.670\nAnd because there's so\nmany technologies related to SharePoint,\n\n51\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.570\nyou're gonna have management packs for\nWindows Server, SQL Server, and more.\n\n52\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.039\nIIS, even there's a management pack for,\nso, the point is,\n\n53\n00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.331\nsome things unexpected will, happen but\n\n54\n00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:16.796\nlot of what's going on your SharePoint\nenvironment shouldn't be surprising.\n\n55\n00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:21.392\nOr you'll be alerted enough in advance\nto be able to plan appropriately either\n\n56\n00:03:21.392 --> 00:03:24.735\nby throttling some workload,\nadding another machine,\n\n57\n00:03:24.735 --> 00:03:28.791\nestablishing quotas maybe if your\nstorage base is growing too high.\n\n58\n00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:30.477\nOkay, I went on a tangent there.\n\n59\n00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.605\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Gotta focus.\n\n60\n00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:35.540\nAll right, more and\nmore caffeine is always the answer.\n\n61\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.570\nOkay, so this is a traditional model.\n\n62\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.090\nAgain, you have an enterprise agreement in\nterms of licensing or volume licensing.\n\n63\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.450\nAnd Microsoft,\nyou can buy support as well.\n\n64\n00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.940\nIn fact, you're gonna get X number\nof hours of support annually anyway,\n\n65\n00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.330\ndepending on your license.\n\n66\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.810\nYou could buy more if you need it.\n\n67\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.542\nOkay, so\n\n68\n00:03:54.542 --> 00:03:59.680\nwhat are your tasks architecturally\non premises with this model?\n\n69\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.457\nWell, you want to figure out what\nSharePoint services your organization\n\n70\n00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:05.003\nneeds.\n\n71\n00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:07.790\nAnd when we look at new features\nin a different episode,\n\n72\n00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.934\nvery exciting, we'll look at\na way that that's automated for\n\n73\n00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:15.060\nyou, in terms of once you've\ndecided what services are required.\n\n74\n00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.760\nAnd you still need to design a farm\ntopology and logical architecture, and\n\n75\n00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.200\nwe covered that at length in\nour first course as well.\n\n76\n00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.720\nYou'll need to size the hardware\nappropriately, again, by measuring,\n\n77\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.430\nyou can adjust on the fly.\n\n78\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.090\nYou can use a physical or virtual workload\nor some combination thereof, depending\n\n79\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.990\non what you're currently using and\nwhere you see your organization headed.\n\n80\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.145\nSome organizations have\nvirtualized the whole workload.\n\n81\n00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:43.310\nYou'll also be responsible for\nvalidation testing, especially for\n\n82\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.895\ncustomizations or apps.\n\n83\n00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:46.650\nRunning custom apps you may have created,\n\n84\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.038\nrunning your SharePoint\non-prem environment.\n\n85\n00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:52.210\nAnd then your DR environment, so\none of the nice things about one\n\n86\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.130\nof the online models, which we talked\nabout in a different episode, is that at\n\n87\n00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.130\nleast some of your DR can be handled\nautomagically through Azure.\n\n88\n00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.100\nIf you're using all SharePoint, it's all\non-prem, then disaster recovery again is\n\n89\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.380\nback, the ball is in your court for\nmaking sure you have a plan there.\n\n90\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.010\nOkay so, under what circumstances\ndoes this model make sense for\n\n91\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.870\nyou or\nan organization you work with or for?\n\n92\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.639\nWell, maybe you've got\ncustomized solutions.\n\n93\n00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.669\nIn fact, they're so customized that\nthere's no resources to try and\n\n94\n00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.200\nfigure out how to make that workload\nwork in a SharePoint Online environment.\n\n95\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.010\nIt's just probably not gonna work.\n\n96\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.250\nAnd even if it does, it's gonna require so\n\n97\n00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.590\nmuch work to adjust\nthat it's not worth it.\n\n98\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.511\nSo that is a good indication to keep\nall or some of the workload on prem.\n\n99\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.400\nNow, you might have\ngovernance issues again,\n\n100\n00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.805\nrelating to the laws about\nwhere data can reside.\n\n101\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.010\nNow Microsoft, depending on the,\nif you're a government organization or\n\n102\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.080\nwhat industry you work in, or what\ncountry or even what state you work in,\n\n103\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.600\nthere may be laws, again,\nabout where that data can be stored.\n\n104\n00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.300\nSo online might not be\na legitimate option.\n\n105\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.950\nOr as Microsoft adds more data\ncenters around the world,\n\n106\n00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.330\nCanada, for example, came online in\n2016 in Toronto and Quebec City.\n\n107\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.630\nBefore that point,\ngovernment organizations and others had\n\n108\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.620\na legitimate concern that they would lose\nsovereignty of the data, essentially.\n\n109\n00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.086\nIf it's stored out of country, basically,\nthey're losing control of the ability to\n\n110\n00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:31.957\nhave it audited or prevent auditing,\nthat sort of thing, or prying eyes.\n\n111\n00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:34.957\nNow, the whole data prying,\nI'm not gonna go there,\n\n112\n00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:37.707\nbecause that has to be a whole course,\nactually.\n\n113\n00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:38.768\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n114\n00:06:38.768 --> 00:06:39.903\n>> Guest speaker, Edward Snowden.\n\n115\n00:06:39.903 --> 00:06:42.148\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just kidding.\n\n116\n00:06:42.148 --> 00:06:45.540\nOkay, but the point is,\nthat's a legitimate concern.\n\n117\n00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.630\nIf you're a government organization,\n\n118\n00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.130\nyou don't necessarily want your\ndata going out of the country.\n\n119\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.989\nSo you may want to wait for\nMicrosoft, for example,\n\n120\n00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:57.828\nto provide cloud solutions\nphysically located in your country.\n\n121\n00:06:57.828 --> 00:06:59.060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n122\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.839\n>> You might have a private\ncloud solution, which again,\n\n123\n00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.980\nSharePoint, entirely on-prem\nwould lend itself to nicely.\n\n124\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.280\nYou might have a situation where\nyou've got third party components or\n\n125\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.508\nsome kind of legacy solution provided by\nsome vendor that's no longer in business.\n\n126\n00:07:14.508 --> 00:07:18.870\nThe hardware and/or software combination\nmight not work with Azure, for\n\n127\n00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.210\nexample, might not be supported on Azure.\n\n128\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.380\nSo then you have to use\nan on-prem workload.\n\n129\n00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.370\nAnd you might have also\nprivacy restrictions.\n\n130\n00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.460\nWe talked about having\na Active Directory on-premises.\n\n131\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.300\nAnd then if you go this route\nin Azure Active Directory,\n\n132\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.960\nyou may not be allowed to\nsynchronize between on-prem and\n\n133\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.565\nAzure Active Directory again for\na legal or business reasons.\n\n134\n00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:39.280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n135\n00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.850\n>> And those are legitimate concerns.\n\n136\n00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.362\nI'm not knocking any one of these\nsolutions because as you can see,\n\n137\n00:07:44.362 --> 00:07:48.438\nthere's different reasons that make good\nsense to use one of the four models.\n\n138\n00:07:48.438 --> 00:07:53.098\nAnd maybe, frankly, a model that makes\nsense today might not make sense tomorrow,\n\n139\n00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:56.000\ndepending on the direction\nyour business is going.\n\n140\n00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.100\nMaybe they wanted to redeploy some\nof the IT staff, for example.\n\n141\n00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.870\nThen you might lose a database\nadministrator from the organization\n\n142\n00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.866\nbecause Microsoft realizes,\n\n143\n00:08:03.866 --> 00:08:07.700\nwe can just have Microsoft do it by\nmoving the workload to the cloud.\n\n144\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.230\n>> You might have gone on-premises\nbecause you've got legacy software.\n\n145\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.150\nAnd now comes time where we don't\nneed that software anymore.\n\n146\n00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.790\nSo now we can think about\nmoving up to the cloud.\n\n147\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.450\n>> Excellent point.\n\n148\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.580\nYes, so circumstances can change.\n\n149\n00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.740\nMaybe you go with a new vendor for\n\n150\n00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.530\nwhatever that software used\nto handle in your business.\n\n151\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.230\nGood point.\n\n152\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.870\nNow, there's also control issues which\nsometimes are more political than\n\n153\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.060\ntechnical.\n\n154\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.020\nAnd again, I'm not knocking it.\n\n155\n00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.852\nFrankly, who doesn't want more control?\n\n156\n00:08:35.852 --> 00:08:38.853\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I do.\n\n157\n00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:40.537\nThere's at least one.\n\n158\n00:08:40.537 --> 00:08:44.788\nSo you might want end to end control\nover your data, where it lives,\n\n159\n00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:46.290\nwhere it's backed up.\n\n160\n00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.640\nAnd still, there's gonna be some maybe\nold school business people, for example,\n\n161\n00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.460\nthat just aren't comfortable,\nthey don't even know what the cloud is.\n\n162\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.437\nThey're not comfortable not knowing where\nthe data is, and that might be something\n\n163\n00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:02.314\nthat's just not gonna change, you're\nnot gonna convince them that it's safe.\n\n164\n00:09:02.314 --> 00:09:05.758\nAlthough nowadays it's so\nubiquitous and so\n\n165\n00:09:05.758 --> 00:09:12.280\nmainstream that even those kinds of\nreactions or resistances are fading away.\n\n166\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.409\nEspecially if a business person,\nfor example,\n\n167\n00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:20.448\nsees their competitor realize huge cost\nsavings in terms of human resources,\n\n168\n00:09:20.448 --> 00:09:24.005\nhardware, data storage,\nhigh availability, etc.\n\n169\n00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:28.862\nThen they're going to start thinking,\nif I'm the laggard here,\n\n170\n00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:33.275\nand 80% of my competitors\nhave utilized some resource,\n\n171\n00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:36.905\nthen I'm essentially wasting money,\nand I'm falling behind.\n\n172\n00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:39.725\nSo even those people can come around, or\nmaybe they leave the organization, and\n\n173\n00:09:39.725 --> 00:09:43.625\nthe next person is far more,\nmaybe not experimental,\n\n174\n00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:47.525\nbut far more at least willing to try new\nsolutions rather than just stick with\n\n175\n00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:49.780\nthe way it's always been done.\n\n176\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.146\nAgain, if you've been\nwatching this episode or\n\n177\n00:09:53.146 --> 00:09:57.992\nother episodes on SharePoint 2016\narchitecture in this course,\n\n178\n00:09:57.992 --> 00:10:01.750\na lot of what we're talking\nabout is not technical.\n\n179\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.910\nIt's related to governance and\nplanning and decision making.\n\n180\n00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.880\nOkay, so, licensing requirements.\n\n181\n00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:15.786\nYou need a Server 2012 R2 license,\nyou'll need SQL 2014 SP1,\n\n182\n00:10:15.786 --> 00:10:21.407\nSharePoint 2016 Server license and\na sufficient number of CALs,\n\n183\n00:10:21.407 --> 00:10:26.280\nClient Access Licenses, for\nSharePoint 2016 as well.\n\n184\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.590\nAll right,\nthat brings us to our last model, and\n\n185\n00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.270\nthis is SharePoint 2016\nin Microsoft Azure.\n\n186\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.750\nOkay, so this scenario,\n\n187\n00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.340\nyou're offloading your servers to\nAzure infrastructure as a service.\n\n188\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.829\nYou still control your\nSharePoint 2016 environment, but\n\n189\n00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:52.494\nas you can see from the slide,\nthe entire farm is hosted in Azure.\n\n190\n00:10:52.494 --> 00:10:54.289\nHow cool is that?\n\n191\n00:10:54.289 --> 00:10:55.231\n>> That's sweet.\n\n192\n00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:56.790\n[LAUGH] I like that.\n\n193\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.345\nCuz now they're taking care\nof the infrastructure,\n\n194\n00:10:59.345 --> 00:11:03.206\nyou're just basically deciding, having\nthe machines you need at the different\n\n195\n00:11:03.206 --> 00:11:05.635\ntiers or if you're gonna do the tiers.\n\n196\n00:11:05.635 --> 00:11:08.895\nThey're gonna take care of a lot\nof that background work for you.\n\n197\n00:11:08.895 --> 00:11:13.195\n>> Exactly, so it's the ultimate\nin delegation, if you will.\n\n198\n00:11:13.195 --> 00:11:16.425\nNow some of you have\nexperimented with Azure,\n\n199\n00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.290\nmay be running actual\nbusiness workloads in Azure.\n\n200\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.946\nIt can take a while to\nnavigate that platform, or\n\n201\n00:11:22.946 --> 00:11:27.593\nthe menu options,\nwhich again are always subject to change.\n\n202\n00:11:27.593 --> 00:11:31.281\nBut once you've got some experience\nprovisioning machines in Azure, then you\n\n203\n00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:35.257\nrealize, it's just another interface,\nand we're using interfaces all day.\n\n204\n00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:38.979\nSo in a sense, who cares whether\nit's in the cloud or on prem,\n\n205\n00:11:38.979 --> 00:11:42.486\nit's just an interface we need\nto have some mastery over,\n\n206\n00:11:42.486 --> 00:11:47.870\nand be willing to be flexible, learn as\nnew options come or some other options go.\n\n207\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.090\nBut from a management perspective, I mean,\n\n208\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:56.100\nyou can see almost the entire slide\nshows resources hosted in Azure.\n\n209\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.720\nNow from the end user\nperspective on the left there,\n\n210\n00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.600\nthey can access through port 80 or\n443 for SSL.\n\n211\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.500\nAnd just like with our\non-prem architecture example,\n\n212\n00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.540\nyou can see the tiers look very similar,\nbecause they are.\n\n213\n00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.126\nI mean, from a user perspective, do they\nreally care where the resource is hosted?\n\n214\n00:12:14.126 --> 00:12:14.937\n>> No.\n\n215\n00:12:14.937 --> 00:12:18.157\n>> No, they just wanna know\nthat they can access it,\n\n216\n00:12:18.157 --> 00:12:22.459\nwhether it's a file share,\na website, content hosted in Azure.\n\n217\n00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:25.841\nThey don't need to know or care,\njust tell them how to get there,\n\n218\n00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:30.226\nmaybe it's a shortcut or favorite on their\nbrowser, and boom, they're in there.\n\n219\n00:12:30.226 --> 00:12:34.896\nOkay, some other components here, we've\ngot Windows Server Active Directory and\n\n220\n00:12:34.896 --> 00:12:38.000\nDNS also hosted in Azure, so\nthat has to be maintained.\n\n221\n00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.401\nAlthough Azure definitely helps\nyou with the setup for DNS,\n\n222\n00:12:43.401 --> 00:12:46.050\nbut there is some work\nthat you need to do.\n\n223\n00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:52.252\nAnd then in terms of, on the right hand\nof the screen there, an on-premises\n\n224\n00:12:52.252 --> 00:12:57.450\nconnection, you can use a VPN tunnel,\nyou can also use express route.\n\n225\n00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.240\nSo this is something that costs you more,\n\n226\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.520\nI mean you get a bigger\npipe to the Azure content.\n\n227\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.915\nSo that's something to consider\ndepending on your requirements there.\n\n228\n00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:15.285\nNow, so, again the whole\nfarm is hosted in Azure, and\n\n229\n00:13:15.285 --> 00:13:19.465\nit's great because it hosts SQL for\nyour backend and\n\n230\n00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:24.410\nSharePoint various resources,\nit's so flexible, Azure.\n\n231\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.080\nThat's why I love it.\n\n232\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.850\nYou get instant ramp up and\nmodification on the fly.\n\n233\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.490\nNo commitment, so there's no long-term\ncommitment like there would be if you were\n\n234\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.300\nbuying a data center worth of servers,\nfor example.\n\n235\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.290\nIt's totally flexible, scale up,\nscale down as needed in advance, for\n\n236\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.420\nexample, of expected peak times.\n\n237\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.320\nEvery business has peak times.\n\n238\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.920\nIf you're retail, then Christmas time\nwould be, or after Black Friday,\n\n239\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.840\nI guess, for a month.\n\n240\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.860\nSo you know this, you can plan for\nit, you can execute it on the day.\n\n241\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.490\nAgain, it's pay for what you use.\n\n242\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.770\nThis lets you focus on applications.\n\n243\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.690\nA lot of people use SharePoint as\na dev environment to customize.\n\n244\n00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.680\nSo your organization could focus\non that element of the work,\n\n245\n00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.420\nthat aspect as opposed to\nthe infrastructure and the data centers.\n\n246\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.688\nSo another compelling advantage there.\n\n247\n00:14:13.688 --> 00:14:20.127\nAnd you can, in terms of various software\nsolutions that you may introduce,\n\n248\n00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:25.380\nyou could make them accessible\nonly from users on premises.\n\n249\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.660\nIn other words, they have to go through\nyour VPN or express route tunnel.\n\n250\n00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.130\nOr you can say that anyone with a browser\ncan access those solutions directly from\n\n251\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:38.607\nany browser, they don't have to first\ngo in through your on-prem environment.\n\n252\n00:14:38.607 --> 00:14:41.820\nAnd then you've got far more\nflexibility in terms of customization\n\n253\n00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.210\nas well because remember, this is\nthe actual software for SharePoint,\n\n254\n00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.952\nSQL, etc.,\nrunning in a hosted environment.\n\n255\n00:14:47.952 --> 00:14:51.150\nIn Azure, but you don't have those\ncustomization restrictions that you would\n\n256\n00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.610\nif you were to use SharePoint Online.\n\n257\n00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.560\nSo that's good, too.\n\n258\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.030\nSo what are your architecture tasks\nif you decide to go this route?\n\n259\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.562\nWell, you've gotta design\nyour Azure virtual network.\n\n260\n00:15:01.562 --> 00:15:04.909\nSo again, it could take a while to set up\nthings we're used to doing on prem with\n\n261\n00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:05.833\nour familiar tools.\n\n262\n00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:10.109\nIt does take a while to learn the new\ninterface of Azure to set up some basic\n\n263\n00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:12.774\nthings like networking, virtual network,\n\n264\n00:15:12.774 --> 00:15:17.420\nit's the kind of thing that once you've\ndone it once, it becomes far easier.\n\n265\n00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.040\nIt's probably gonna take\nyou longer the first time.\n\n266\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.020\nJust, that's the way it is.\n\n267\n00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.707\nYou want to design your domain environment\nand integration with your on-prem servers.\n\n268\n00:15:27.707 --> 00:15:34.549\nLet's see,\nyou wanna use the min rule architecture.\n\n269\n00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:39.129\nWe'll look at the min\nrule in a later episode,\n\n270\n00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:43.598\nwhen we talk about new features of 2016.\n\n271\n00:15:43.598 --> 00:15:47.570\nYou wanna have virtual machine sizes,\nyou wanna pick those.\n\n272\n00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.989\nExternal endpoints,\nno need for public access.\n\n273\n00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.730\nOkay so this is best for,\n\n274\n00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.565\nthis environment is best for,\nif we go back to the diagram, please.\n\n275\n00:15:58.565 --> 00:16:00.500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n276\n00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.330\n>> Public facing sites\nthat use Azure AD for\n\n277\n00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.920\naccounts authentication\n>> It's great if you just wanna set up\n\n278\n00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.520\na dev environment or testing or\nstaging environment and then tear it down.\n\n279\n00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.780\nAnd of course, you can automate this\nprocess as well, which is handy.\n\n280\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.840\nIf you have an application that you\nneed to expand both on-prem and\n\n281\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.560\ncloud resources, you can use Azure.\n\n282\n00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.890\nVery good for\na recovery environment as well, and\n\n283\n00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.330\ndata encryption at rest,\nthat might be important to you,\n\n284\n00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.660\nso by default, data is encrypted\nin SQL databases in Azure.\n\n285\n00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.699\nSo, especially today, when there's so\nmany, maybe not daily, but\n\n286\n00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:40.464\nit seems weekly, there's some new\ndata breach affecting a few or\n\n287\n00:16:40.464 --> 00:16:44.588\npotentially millions of customers,\nsay, at the retail store level.\n\n288\n00:16:44.588 --> 00:16:47.470\nSo a little paranoia is good,\nis what I always say.\n\n289\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:53.305\nSo having data encrypted in your\nsingle databases is significant.\n\n290\n00:16:53.305 --> 00:16:54.840\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n291\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.660\n>> Okay, so we've got licensing\nrequirements, need an Azure subscription,\n\n292\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.240\nand then also licenses for SQL 2014 SP1.\n\n293\n00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:10.264\nAnd your SharePoint server license and\nsufficient CALs for SharePoint 2016.\n\n294\n00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:12.590\nSo that's all I've got for architecture.\n\n295\n00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.420\n>> All right, Mark.\n\n296\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.720\nGreat way to round that out.\n\n297\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.140\nWe took a look at those last two models,\nwe had the Azure IaaS,\n\n298\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.740\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n299\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.730\nAs well as the complete on-prem where\nyou're in control of everything.\n\n300\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.337\nAnd then remember,\nin the previous episode, in the part one,\n\n301\n00:17:29.337 --> 00:17:31.448\nwe took a look at SharePoint online,\n\n302\n00:17:31.448 --> 00:17:35.893\nas well as doing a hybrid model we get\na mix of some maybe online, some on prem.\n\n303\n00:17:35.893 --> 00:17:39.293\nSo, great look at that and\na lot of decisions to make,\n\n304\n00:17:39.293 --> 00:17:43.677\nwe start to see how planning is a very\nimportant part in the successful\n\n305\n00:17:43.677 --> 00:17:46.260\ndeployment of our SharePoint servers.\n\n306\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.970\nSo understanding the different models, the\nbenefits as you so greatly went through.\n\n307\n00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.110\nWhy we might consider one over the other.\n\n308\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.060\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n309\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.180\nWe thank you for that.\n\n310\n00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.990\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n311\n00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.580\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n312\n00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.320\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n313\n00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.848\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n314\n00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:11.059\n[SOUND]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:15.552\nHello, welcome to another exciting\nepisode of here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:20.540\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing our advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.654\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be taking a look at some of the new\n\n5\n00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:27.634\nfeatures that we're gonna\nfind in SharePoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:31.980\nAnd here to point those out for us is Mr.\nMark Ingram, how are you doing Mark?\n\n7\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.706\n>> Thanks very much, all right.\n\n8\n00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:39.060\nPeople often when they're preparing for\nan exam, remember\n\n9\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.634\nthere's a saying in remnant, if you're\nnot writing code, you're selling code.\n\n10\n00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:45.088\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So even the act of taking an exam is in\n\n11\n00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:47.250\na sense selling code.\n\n12\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.770\nRight, you're preparing for an exam why?\n\n13\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.000\nBecause you're learning new features,\n\n14\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.040\nbecause they often feature\nprominently on exams, and\n\n15\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.040\nthen of course you'll know those\nfeatures and be able to specify them.\n\n16\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.660\nOr recommend them for\nupgrade or what have you.\n\n17\n00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.730\nSo finding out what's new\nis a key part of any exam,\n\n18\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.670\nespecially if you're familiar\nwith product before.\n\n19\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.460\nAs I've said before, in some ways people\nnew to product have an advantage because\n\n20\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.600\nthey don't have to unlearn anything.\n\n21\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.450\n>> That's right.\n\n22\n00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.500\n>> Whereas it's quite common on\nMicrosoft exams to get an answer\n\n23\n00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830\nthat would have been right\nin the previous version.\n\n24\n00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.550\nOr the question writer's intentionally\ntrying to distract you from\n\n25\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.360\nthe right answer by referencing something\nthat might have been in the product for\n\n26\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.020\nseveral versions.\n\n27\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.610\nBefore this one, but now is not.\n\n28\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.270\nSo it's always important\nto know what's new.\n\n29\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.570\nWe'll be going into detail about a lot\nof what's new throughout the week.\n\n30\n00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.040\nBut it's nice to get an overview of\nthat because that often what people\n\n31\n00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.100\nwanna know first.\n\n32\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.340\nWhat's different?\n\n33\n00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.810\nSo let's go into that.\n\n34\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.060\nSo we have Access Services,\nthere's some new things there.\n\n35\n00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.900\nSupport for apps for Office, there's\na download an Excel feature, that's new,\n\n36\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.730\nfor users to pivot access tables,\nwe will go into much detail on that.\n\n37\n00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.490\nAnother thing that's new, that's frankly\nis better from a security perspective, and\n\n38\n00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.090\nthat is this.\n\n39\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.860\nIts central admin site, by default,\nused to be provisioned on all servers.\n\n40\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.570\nSo no matter what role you chose for\nthe server, whether it was an application\n\n41\n00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.140\nserver or web front end, you would get\nthe central admin site by default.\n\n42\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.190\nNow, the central admin site is\nnot provisioned by default.\n\n43\n00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.420\nBecause how can you administer the farm\nif the very first server you're\n\n44\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.420\ncreating the farm doesn't\nhave the central admin site?\n\n45\n00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.915\nThat wouldn't make sense at all.\n\n46\n00:02:37.915 --> 00:02:42.500\n[LAUGH] Remember,\nwhat is the farm creation process?\n\n47\n00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.720\nThat is creating a new configuration\ndatabase in a nutshell.\n\n48\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.080\nSo when you add additional\nSharePoint servers to the farm,\n\n49\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.950\nyou might remember for the wizard, I know\nour first week course on SharePoint,\n\n50\n00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.290\nyou get to ask that fundamental question.\n\n51\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.040\nAre you creating a new\nconfiguration data base or\n\n52\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.750\nare you connecting to an existing\nconfiguration database?\n\n53\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.660\nThat's another way of asking,\nare we creating a brand new farm here or\n\n54\n00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.650\nare you adding a serve\nto an existing farm.\n\n55\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.540\nOkay, so first server in the farm\ngets a central item site by default.\n\n56\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.640\nNow what if you decide,\nlet's say you install a web or\n\n57\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.530\nan end server, you don't have a central\nadmin site, but you want to add it later?\n\n58\n00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.860\nYou can do that and I'm gonna show you,\n\n59\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.395\njust to demo something,\nbecause it's fun to demo.\n\n60\n00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:32.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And also, by way of pointing out that\n\n61\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.345\nwhat you can expect in this week of class\nhere ITPRO.TV and certainly on the exam.\n\n62\n00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:43.705\nAnother thing Microsoft loves to do\nnot only test you on your knowledge of\n\n63\n00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:46.845\nnew functionality but\nalso see how many ways you can do it.\n\n64\n00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:50.825\nIn fact often the hardest way\npossible you'll be asked about.\n\n65\n00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:52.017\n>> [LAUGH] Of course.\n>> So in other words,\n\n66\n00:03:52.017 --> 00:03:56.746\nsomething you wouldn't necessarily do in\nthe real world because you probably use\n\n67\n00:03:56.746 --> 00:03:58.230\nthe GUI.\n\n68\n00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.797\nBut there's always gonna be\na PowerShell equivalent to the GUI.\n\n69\n00:04:00.797 --> 00:04:03.510\nThere's not always gonna be a GUI\nequivalent to the PowerShell command.\n\n70\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.340\nBut let's say you're used to\ncreating something with the GUI.\n\n71\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.090\nIt's likely on a test, you'll get asked\n\n72\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.610\nto pick an answer from how to create\nit in PowerShell or psconfig.\n\n73\n00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.570\nFor example, so I'm going to show you\nhow to provision or make available\n\n74\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.580\nessential admin site on a SharePoint\nserver that didn't originally get it.\n\n75\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.258\nSo I'll go to my demo machine here.\n\n76\n00:04:32.784 --> 00:04:38.457\nExcellent, and I'm going to go into\n\n77\n00:04:38.457 --> 00:04:45.230\nMy SharePoint 2016 Management shell.\n\n78\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.140\nAnd wait a while for\nthat PowerShell prompt to appear.\n\n79\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.700\n>> That's loading up the modules\nnecessary to work with SharePoint?\n\n80\n00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.800\n>> Yeah, and\nthat happened lickety split, thankfully.\n\n81\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.600\nAll right, so\nI'm say new SPCentralAdministration.\n\n82\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.610\nUsing tab complete,\nthere's the commandlet.\n\n83\n00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.380\nThat's it, hit Enter and\nwait a few seconds and\n\n84\n00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.500\nboom, I will have the SharePoint\ncentral lab insight available\n\n85\n00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.790\nin this case a web front end server.\n\n86\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.580\nSo it makes sense to only have essential\nadmin site on the application server\n\n87\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.400\nmost of the time.\n\n88\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.520\nBut if there's some reason that you need\nto have it on a different SharePoint\n\n89\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.010\nserver, then that's a simple, simple\nas that power stroke command and run.\n\n90\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.490\nAnd let's say you change your mind or\n\n91\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.120\nyou make some configuration change a good\npractice would be to remove that central\n\n92\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.980\nadmin site if it was\na one-off thing you're doing.\n\n93\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.420\nRemember you can always add in later, you\ncan always add in a group permission for\n\n94\n00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.630\nexample where people get caught\nout sometimes and share a point,\n\n95\n00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.160\nanother admin task is to get lazy.\n\n96\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.190\nFor example, giving local admin rights\nto users just so software application\n\n97\n00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.510\ncan run which is sometimes you have to do\nit that way to get the software to work.\n\n98\n00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.080\nBut in a case like this, you might say,\n\n99\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.880\nwe'll just leave that central admin\nsite available on the way of front\n\n100\n00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.210\nend server because we might need it later,\nthat's a bad practice.\n\n101\n00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.050\nPeople that need to access the central\nadmin site, we'll always be able to do it\n\n102\n00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.750\nwhere it's hosted on the application\nserver, where it belongs, right.\n\n103\n00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.812\nSo think about the principle\nof least privilege and\n\n104\n00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:21.660\ndon't add unnecessary risk, it's my point.\n\n105\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.770\nSo let's say you change your mind now and\nor you've configured whatever you wanted\n\n106\n00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.240\nto configure by enabling that central\nadmin site on your web front-end server.\n\n107\n00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.779\nAnd you wanna remove it?\n\n108\n00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:39.815\nWell, you simply do\nRemove-SPCentralAdministration,\n\n109\n00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:42.070\nas easy as that.\n\n110\n00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.020\nSo, this week will there be\na lot of demos using PowerShell.\n\n111\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.610\nNow, I'm doing that purposely because,\nagain, for the example, the real world,\n\n112\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.310\nyou'll need to know the PowerShell\nequivalent to the GUI action.\n\n113\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.380\nSo I did show you a lot of GUI actions for\n\n114\n00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.490\nregular SharePoint admin, so what we'll\ntalk about, entirely new topics this week.\n\n115\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.450\nAnd my bias will be towards PowerShell,\nthe PowerShell way of doing something.\n\n116\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.850\nCuz you're gonna need to get hands on and\nget conversant with that method,\n\n117\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.930\neven though you may be\nused to doing it via GUI.\n\n118\n00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.770\nOkay and often I'll show two different\nways to do the same different thing,\n\n119\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.460\nif not three.\n\n120\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.470\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.985\n>> Cuz as we know,\n\n122\n00:07:18.985 --> 00:07:20.612\nin Microsoft technologies\nthere's often two or\n\n123\n00:07:20.612 --> 00:07:21.890\nthree ways to do the exact same thing.\n\n124\n00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.634\n>> Absolutely.\n\n125\n00:07:22.634 --> 00:07:27.180\n>> And so it never hurts to be nimble,\nif you will.\n\n126\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.290\nOkay, what else is new?\n\n127\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.990\nBecause that is the purpose\nof this episode.\n\n128\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.500\nWhat's new?\n\n129\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.480\nWe have compliance features that are new.\n\n130\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.700\nAnd, for example,\n\n131\n00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.780\nwe can delete documents in a user's\nOne Drive after a period of time.\n\n132\n00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.690\nThat's kind of cool.\n\n133\n00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.360\nSo we can essentially expire the content.\n\n134\n00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.170\nWe always have to be conscious\nof storage growth and\n\n135\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.840\nmaking sure we have relevant\ncontent being stored.\n\n136\n00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.150\nWether it's publicly available or\njust for the individual user.\n\n137\n00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.061\nOr perhaps, user plus whoever he or\nshe share content with.\n\n138\n00:07:57.061 --> 00:08:02.980\nPruning content is under rated, frankly,\nand definitely a best practice.\n\n139\n00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.894\nOne way to get departments or\ndivisions on board with the pruning, and\n\n140\n00:08:06.894 --> 00:08:11.468\nI'm using that term an English word, not\ndatabase pruning or that kind of thing,\n\n141\n00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:15.681\nthat more technical term, but just to\nget rid of old stuff you don't need.\n\n142\n00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:17.462\n>> Mm-hm, kinda cleaning house.\n\n143\n00:08:17.462 --> 00:08:18.118\n>> Yeah, cleaning house.\n\n144\n00:08:18.118 --> 00:08:19.260\nExactly.\n\n145\n00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.915\nEspecially if you're moving to a new\nsystem, that's a whole other conversation.\n\n146\n00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:27.510\nMy point is there's tools now to make\nit easier to delete old content and\n\n147\n00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.460\nthis is one of them,\nin terms of compliance.\n\n148\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.610\nWe have a whole episode or\ntwo on compliance this week as well.\n\n149\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:42.090\nAlso an in hold policy, or in place hold\npolicy which lets us put say, legal hold\n\n150\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:47.180\non content even if it's not in a specified\nrepository wherever that content lives.\n\n151\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.320\nIn my sites or a document library,\nwherever that content is,\n\n152\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.160\nit's been tagged to be held for\nlegal reasons, we can do that now.\n\n153\n00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.990\n>> Nice.\n\n154\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.390\n>> So we can preserve documents and\nother files as well as emails.\n\n155\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.350\nSo again we'll have a whole episode or\ntwo on that.\n\n156\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.960\nThere is improvement to\ndocument library accessibility.\n\n157\n00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.615\nSo in terms of keyboard shortcuts,\nfor example, so\n\n158\n00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:15.025\nmany of us can use all ten fingers,\nnot everyone has that liberty.\n\n159\n00:09:15.025 --> 00:09:20.485\nSome people might be using a pen in their\nmouth, for example, with sticky keys.\n\n160\n00:09:21.612 --> 00:09:24.412\nSo they can hit Alt first and\nthen hit E, and\n\n161\n00:09:24.412 --> 00:09:26.592\nit's as if they hit Alt and\nE at the same time.\n\n162\n00:09:26.592 --> 00:09:29.292\nSo there's improvements\nto keyboard shortcuts for\n\n163\n00:09:29.292 --> 00:09:30.778\ndocument library accessibility.\n\n164\n00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:35.052\nAnd also call-out reading,\n\n165\n00:09:35.052 --> 00:09:39.122\nand just whether you're\nphysically impaired or\n\n166\n00:09:39.122 --> 00:09:43.982\nperhaps have problems hearing or\nseeing visual cues, there's improvements\n\n167\n00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:49.060\nthere in terms of call-outs and\ncolor to make it easier to apprehend.\n\n168\n00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.602\nA little sideline, if I may.\n\n169\n00:09:52.602 --> 00:09:56.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A fellow that's been involved with\n\n170\n00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.470\nMicrosoft for many years.\n\n171\n00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.550\nMuhammad Ali died recently.\n\n172\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.650\nAnd he mentioned, out of the blue one day,\n\n173\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.290\nhe had a meeting at Microsoft and Muhammad\nAli walked by with a couple of people.\n\n174\n00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.910\nAnd nobody knew he was coming or\nat least he didn't but he was,\n\n175\n00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.640\nMohammed Ali was there to help Microsoft\nwith their accessibility features.\n\n176\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.280\n>> Really?\n>> Because he had\n\n177\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.920\nParkinson's disease late in life so\nhe thought it was cool.\n\n178\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.850\n>> That's neat.\n>> Of all the spokespeople or\n\n179\n00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.560\nI guess test users, if you like,\nwho you're getting feedback from,\n\n180\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.940\nwhy not one of the greatest boxers if\nnot the greatest boxer of all time?\n\n181\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.460\nOkay so, accessibility is key.\n\n182\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.390\nSo it's not, if sometimes,\n\n183\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.150\npeople have some kind of impairment that\nyou don't necessarily see, but they would\n\n184\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.550\nappreciate it, or even people maybe,\nthey can't see as well as they used to.\n\n185\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.985\nAny visual cue we can enable them to\ntake advantage helps them out, and\n\n186\n00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:45.395\nagain when we get some more\nbuying into share point,\n\n187\n00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.535\nespecially if people are doing\nthings newly in share point.\n\n188\n00:10:48.535 --> 00:10:51.725\nWe want to make it as easy as possible so\nthat they\n\n189\n00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:56.695\nhave a smooth process on boarding, if\nyou like, in the share point experience.\n\n190\n00:10:56.695 --> 00:11:00.215\nAnother thing new is\nencryptic connections.\n\n191\n00:11:00.215 --> 00:11:06.690\nSo we use TLS1.2 Encryption as long as\nyour client application supports it.\n\n192\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.960\nPart of the reason for\n\n193\n00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.490\nthis is there was a security\nvulnerability identified in SSL 3.0.\n\n194\n00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:17.590\nAnd that may be counter intuitive,\nbecause I would think any\n\n195\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:22.510\nway that any vulnerability would be more\nlikely to attack a previous version of,\n\n196\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.126\nan older version of any given technology,\nbut that's what happened there.\n\n197\n00:11:27.126 --> 00:11:29.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Another thing new is fast site\n\n198\n00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:35.440\ncollection creation and\nthis lets you use commandlets the SP\n\n199\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.840\nsite master commandlets in PowerShell and\nthe idea there is that it takes sites and\n\n200\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.580\nsite and cycle action much faster by\nreducing round trips between the web\n\n201\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.140\nfront end that the clients connect to and\nthe SQL backend.\n\n202\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.500\nSo that's something new.\n\n203\n00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.980\nThis might help you out.\n\n204\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.270\nThe next new feature, file names,\n\n205\n00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.610\nwe can use additional characters\nnow that were verboten before.\n\n206\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.090\nThis can be very handy because before, it\nmight have been just an inconvenience or\n\n207\n00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.320\nsomething that you were reminded of when\nyou tried to use an illegal character.\n\n208\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.650\nBut for authorizations, it may screw them\nup because they might have very specific\n\n209\n00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:14.510\nnaming conventions for files or\nfolders in their file service for example.\n\n210\n00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.758\nAnd then when they try and\nuse the same naming convention on\n\n211\n00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:23.178\nSharePoint they get told no,\nyou can't use the ampersand,\n\n212\n00:12:23.178 --> 00:12:27.943\nyou can't use the tilde,\nthat little wavy thing which is above,\n\n213\n00:12:27.943 --> 00:12:33.336\nto the right of the 1 key, left of\nthe 1 key, shift, that little tilde.\n\n214\n00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:33.942\nWhat else?\n\n215\n00:12:33.942 --> 00:12:36.110\nThe square braces.\n\n216\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:41.320\nSo again, for some users,\nit would just be a mild inconvenience.\n\n217\n00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.390\nBut for others, it's a hassle,\n\n218\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.410\nit's a waste of time at least translating\nyour naming convention to the file server,\n\n219\n00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.960\nand then switching it up\nsomewhat to fit in SharePoint.\n\n220\n00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.980\nAnything like that, it's unnecessary\noverhead on people's brains.\n\n221\n00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.650\nIt might seem inconsequential, but you\nhave to do that and then Maybe if you're\n\n222\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.380\nmoving it back from SharePoint on-prem and\ndo you have to rename it then.\n\n223\n00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.460\n>> Absolutely.\n\n224\n00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.348\n>> I suppose another way around is\nto change your naming convention\n\n225\n00:13:07.348 --> 00:13:10.910\no n mass in your entire environment so\n\n226\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.620\nthat it is complicit with SharePoint,\nbut again, that's more work.\n\n227\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.212\nSo more characters you can use for\nfile names.\n\n228\n00:13:17.212 --> 00:13:21.497\nOkay, there's a lot of hybrid\nfunctionality that's new in\n\n229\n00:13:21.497 --> 00:13:23.184\nSharePoint 2016.\n\n230\n00:13:23.184 --> 00:13:25.368\nBut because that is such a large topic,\n\n231\n00:13:25.368 --> 00:13:28.082\nwe've got episodes devoted\njust to hybrids, so\n\n232\n00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:33.020\nI'm not going to go into exactly what's\nnew with hybrid, a little teaser there.\n\n233\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.355\nSo watch the hybrid episode\nto get the low down.\n\n234\n00:13:37.355 --> 00:13:38.910\n[LAUGH]\n>> We can search for\n\n235\n00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:43.550\nwhat's called sensitive content now\nin both SharePoint server 2016 and\n\n236\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.900\nOne Drive documents.\n\n237\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.980\nAnd also SharePoint online so\n\n238\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:54.060\na single place to search multiple\nrepositories for content.\n\n239\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.120\nAnd what is the sense of data type?\n\n240\n00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.960\nWell we've got, Microsoft has 51 built-in\ndefinitions for sensitive data types.\n\n241\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.750\nNow if you views exchange and\nmany of you have, probably as a user with\n\n242\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.680\nall the web access or maybe as\nadministrator, you'll know about the data\n\n243\n00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.370\nloss prevention capabilities that have\nbeen around exchange for some time.\n\n244\n00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.550\nThe idea there is that you can prevent\n\n245\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:21.580\nrestricted content from leaving your\norganization based on pattern recognition.\n\n246\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.990\nFor things like common credit card\npatterns, perhaps in your specific\n\n247\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.760\nbusiness, patient ID numbers for example,\nor some kind of security clearance.\n\n248\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:36.490\nWhatever numbers or information types\nare sensitive in your environment,\n\n249\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.930\nyou can search for\nthat content again with built\n\n250\n00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.830\nin sensitive information types,\nthey're called.\n\n251\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.910\nSocial security number\nwould be another obvious\n\n252\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.550\none that organizations would\nwant to search through.\n\n253\n00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.600\n>> Yeah, very important stuff there\nbecause you've got users putting content\n\n254\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.340\nup in these libraries and\nthen in One Drive for business or\n\n255\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.350\nthe redirect feature.\n\n256\n00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:02.010\nAnd we train, we train,\nwe try to explain to them, but inevitably,\n\n257\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.120\nthey put a document in a library that\nhas sensitive information in there, and\n\n258\n00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.220\nit shouldn't be in that library.\n\n259\n00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.100\nSo the ability for\nus to go in and search and\n\n260\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.610\nfind it without having to read\nthrough every document is fantastic.\n\n261\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.080\n>> Yeah, and\nmaybe it's just from an audit perspective.\n\n262\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.750\nYou want to know okay, let's say all\ncredit cards, three major credit cards,\n\n263\n00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.178\nAMEX, Visa and MasterCard,\nis that product placement?\n\n264\n00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:23.960\n>> I think so.\n\n265\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.121\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See if we get a check later on.\n\n266\n00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:28.190\n>> Yeah, we'll see, or a law suit.\n\n267\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.090\nYeah, no it wouldn't be that.\n\n268\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.320\nLet's just say the three major\ncredit card providers we want to see\n\n269\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.820\neverywhere in the organization\nin a SharePoint context,\n\n270\n00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.360\nin One Drive where those\nnumbers might be stored.\n\n271\n00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.160\nIt could be document libraries, could be\nit users OneDrive, OneDrive for business,\n\n272\n00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.630\njust to get an audit report, where\nare these pieces of information living?\n\n273\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.325\nAnd then maybe we create\na policy from that.\n\n274\n00:15:49.325 --> 00:15:53.684\nOr maybe we do have a policy or it's been\nincorrectly applied or only applied to\n\n275\n00:15:53.684 --> 00:15:57.860\na segment of our overall information\nstorage, so it's just good to know.\n\n276\n00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.137\nWe could also, maybe as part of\nan e-discovery process, so again,\n\n277\n00:16:02.137 --> 00:16:07.375\nin terms of litigation, we may be required\nto produce certain content relating to,\n\n278\n00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:11.230\nlet's say,\na specific customer's credit card number.\n\n279\n00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.442\nMaybe an organization got sued because\nthis person wants to make sure we\n\n280\n00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:18.684\ndon't have their number or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n281\n00:16:18.684 --> 00:16:22.657\nI mean that's certainly something I've\nread, in the Microsoft community anyway,\n\n282\n00:16:22.657 --> 00:16:24.476\nis that people are, it's one thing for\n\n283\n00:16:24.476 --> 00:16:27.110\nsay a large organization to\nacknowledge a data breach.\n\n284\n00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.800\nBut then,\nwhat are they doing with our numbers?\n\n285\n00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.582\nI mean should I just call my provider,\nmy credit card provider,\n\n286\n00:16:34.582 --> 00:16:36.452\nand demand a new number?\n\n287\n00:16:36.452 --> 00:16:41.367\nSo e-discovery, we can use this\ndata loss prevention technology in\n\n288\n00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:46.470\ncombination with sensitive content,\nsensitive information types.\n\n289\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.560\nImage and video previews is\nsomething that's new, this is cool.\n\n290\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.836\nSo you're probably familiar with this in\nother websites, quite normal nowadays,\n\n291\n00:16:55.836 --> 00:16:59.448\nyou hover over an image or video and\nyou get, well, if it's the image,\n\n292\n00:16:59.448 --> 00:17:00.430\nyou see the image.\n\n293\n00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.080\nMaybe it's blown up a bit.\n\n294\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.200\nOr, if it's a video you're hovering over\nthere's a particular frame of the video\n\n295\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.100\nthat you can see.\n\n296\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.772\nNow, it may be the first frame, or\nany frame that the content creator has\n\n297\n00:17:12.772 --> 00:17:17.225\nselected to be the frame that appears\nwhen you hover your mouse over.\n\n298\n00:17:17.225 --> 00:17:17.979\n>> Nice.\n\n299\n00:17:17.979 --> 00:17:20.880\n>> So that image and video preview is new.\n\n300\n00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:28.021\nThere's new technology related to\ninformation rights management, and\n\n301\n00:17:28.021 --> 00:17:34.660\nwe can secure and sync information rights\nmanagement with OneDrive for Business.\n\n302\n00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.430\nSo this is good.\n\n303\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.010\nSo just as a refresher on\ninformation rights management,\n\n304\n00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.800\nwe did talk about it in the first course.\n\n305\n00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.430\nBut so many of these concepts\nrelate to other courses that\n\n306\n00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.410\na little repetition is never a bad thing.\n\n307\n00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.731\nSo this pertains to what we do with data.\n\n308\n00:17:50.731 --> 00:17:53.076\nIt can include things like\nRights Management Services.\n\n309\n00:17:53.076 --> 00:17:56.186\nSo, if you've enabled that, the ability\nfor an author to put additional\n\n310\n00:17:56.186 --> 00:17:59.170\nrestrictions on a document that\nwouldn't normally be available.\n\n311\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.770\nLike a do not print restriction, or\na do not forward restriction which would\n\n312\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.700\nprevent a document I authored,\nif I specify do not\n\n313\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.920\nforward that means that document could\nnot be emailed out of the organization.\n\n314\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.790\nI could also expire the content\nat a certain date so\n\n315\n00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.285\nafter that date the content\nwill become illegible.\n\n316\n00:18:18.442 --> 00:18:21.800\nBut information rights management\nalso includes things like\n\n317\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.540\nmoving content to cheaper storage,\nlike archiving it or deleting it, or\n\n318\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.310\npolicies related to how information is\nmoved throughout your organization.\n\n319\n00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.280\nNow this is good.\n\n320\n00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.670\nSome of you would have encountered this in\nterms of large file support, now we can\n\n321\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.080\nupload or download files, or combinations\nof files larger than 2 gigabytes.\n\n322\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.920\n>> Wow.\n\n323\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.660\n>> This is handy, so\n\n324\n00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.890\nthat's a setting you'd establish\non a per web application basis.\n\n325\n00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.760\nSo perhaps you're producing video,\nlike we are here right now,\n\n326\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.630\nyou quite likely could have a larger file\nsize or combination of files that for\n\n327\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.610\nwhatever reason you wanted to upload all\nat once, and then more than 2 gigs now.\n\n328\n00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:05.010\nA policy setting at the web application\nlevel can allow users within site\n\n329\n00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.338\ncollections hosted within that web\napplication to upload file sizes or\n\n330\n00:19:09.338 --> 00:19:13.034\ncombinations of files totaling\nmore than 2 gigabytes.\n\n331\n00:19:13.034 --> 00:19:15.000\n>> Nice.\n>> So large file support.\n\n332\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.178\nNow the MinRole farm topology,\nthis is very good from an admin\n\n333\n00:19:20.178 --> 00:19:25.461\nperspective because now we can\nautomatically have SharePoint\n\n334\n00:19:25.461 --> 00:19:30.742\nconfigure services on a SharePoint\nserver we're deploying,\n\n335\n00:19:30.742 --> 00:19:35.230\ndepending on the role we're using it for.\n\n336\n00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.820\nAs opposed to us specifying okay, we wanna\nmake this a web front end server, and\n\n337\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.830\nafter the fact going in and turning on,\nor disabling certain services.\n\n338\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.344\nNo, with MinRole, it's a bit misleading,\n\n339\n00:19:45.344 --> 00:19:48.854\nbecause MinRole sounds to me\nlike some stripped down version,\n\n340\n00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:53.370\nlike a server core installation for\nexample, but it's nothing to do with that.\n\n341\n00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:58.130\nI guess, think of it as minimum hassle,\n[LAUGH] to set up.\n\n342\n00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.410\nOr minimum installation, if you like.\n\n343\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.790\nBut I mean, that's not official.\n\n344\n00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.920\nSo MinRole is the official term for it.\n\n345\n00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.260\nSo for example,\nwe have several different role types.\n\n346\n00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.290\nAnd in our lab environment for\nthis course,\n\n347\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.750\nwe set up one of each of these roles.\n\n348\n00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.600\nSo what are those roles?\n\n349\n00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.070\nWe have a front end role.\n\n350\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.250\nSo this is our web front end server,\nwhich if you're familiar with SharePoint,\n\n351\n00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.930\nyou'd be familiar with,\n\n352\n00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:25.650\nthat's the server type that end users\nconnect to with various machines.\n\n353\n00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:30.620\nAnd then the web front end servers\nproxy requests to the SQL storage\n\n354\n00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.410\nin the backend on behalf of the client and\nthen return whatever content is supposed\n\n355\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.410\nto be returned to the client based on\naccess to the content in the SQL database.\n\n356\n00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:44.487\nSo the point is with the MinRole I\nclick on a button saying Frontend,\n\n357\n00:20:44.487 --> 00:20:50.633\nboom, all the services are configured\ncorrectly to have that physical machine or\n\n358\n00:20:50.633 --> 00:20:54.572\nVM I configure, optimized for\nthat front end role.\n\n359\n00:20:54.572 --> 00:20:57.651\nSimilarly, there is\nan application server role.\n\n360\n00:20:57.651 --> 00:21:01.935\nThis is optimized to run\nservice applications, services,\n\n361\n00:21:01.935 --> 00:21:04.965\ncrawl requests, background jobs, etc.\n\n362\n00:21:04.965 --> 00:21:07.146\nSo that's another role type, and\n\n363\n00:21:07.146 --> 00:21:12.032\nwe'll be having demos run on all these\ndifferent types I'm mentioning now,\n\n364\n00:21:12.032 --> 00:21:16.640\nbecause remember we got one of each\nof these types installed in our farm.\n\n365\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.146\nWell, actually all but one,\nwhich I'll explain in a minute.\n\n366\n00:21:19.146 --> 00:21:23.790\nThe distributed cache role is another\nserver role, so distributed cache,\n\n367\n00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:29.100\nthe more content that's cached\nthe faster content can be returned\n\n368\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.950\nto clients requesting data.\n\n369\n00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.590\nIt also takes some heat off the SQL\nservers in the backend, right?\n\n370\n00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.085\nWhy?\nBecause the content has already been\n\n371\n00:21:37.085 --> 00:21:40.233\nrequested, there's a time of life,\nif you like,\n\n372\n00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:43.967\na time to live on that content\ndepending on what we set up, and\n\n373\n00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:47.920\nhow volatile the content is and\nhow timely it needs to be.\n\n374\n00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.959\nMaybe the content lives in cache for\nan hour or more, again,\n\n375\n00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:54.251\ndepending on how important it is\nto have up to the minute content.\n\n376\n00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:57.118\nBut the point is, we're taking some\nload off the web front end servers so\n\n377\n00:21:57.118 --> 00:21:59.090\nthey don't have to do all the caching.\n\n378\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.468\nAnd again,\ntaking load off the SQL backend servers,\n\n379\n00:22:02.468 --> 00:22:07.670\nbecause each new request doesn't require\na full round-trip to the SQL backend.\n\n380\n00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:08.770\nAnd also,\n\n381\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:14.210\nlet's not forget the bandwidth in-between\nthese server types is also reduced.\n\n382\n00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:19.550\nSo if you set up the MinRole and specify\nthe distributed cache radio button,\n\n383\n00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:24.820\nthen you get a server optimized with\nservices, applications and components\n\n384\n00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:30.390\nto make it the best possible cache\nserver because that's what its role is.\n\n385\n00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.210\nThat's its role in life,\nto cache things and serve them up.\n\n386\n00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.780\nSimilarly, we have a search MinRole, and\n\n387\n00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.500\nas you've guessed by now,\nthat means it's optimized for search.\n\n388\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.980\nAll the components, services,\napplications relating to search.\n\n389\n00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.298\nThere is also a single server farm role.\n\n390\n00:22:48.298 --> 00:22:53.143\nAnd again, it would be for dev or testing,\nnot for any kind of decent production use,\n\n391\n00:22:53.143 --> 00:22:56.574\nit's just a test environment,\nif you don't have the time or\n\n392\n00:22:56.574 --> 00:23:00.775\nthe desire to install multiple roles,\njust install single server farm.\n\n393\n00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:05.448\nOkay, but\nyou will need a SQL Server to connect to.\n\n394\n00:23:06.888 --> 00:23:12.134\nThe other role type,\nMinRole type, is custom, and\n\n395\n00:23:12.134 --> 00:23:17.978\nlet's say the default role types for\nMinRole like cache,\n\n396\n00:23:17.978 --> 00:23:22.761\nand search, and\napplication, and front end.\n\n397\n00:23:22.761 --> 00:23:26.706\nLet's say those don't quite meet your\nneeds for whatever custom role you need.\n\n398\n00:23:26.706 --> 00:23:29.253\nMaybe it's a special\napplication you wanna run.\n\n399\n00:23:29.253 --> 00:23:33.804\nBut it doesn't really fit in\nwell with the default services,\n\n400\n00:23:33.804 --> 00:23:38.106\netc., that would run on\nan application server MinRole.\n\n401\n00:23:38.106 --> 00:23:39.813\nWell, you can customize it, so\n\n402\n00:23:39.813 --> 00:23:44.117\nthat gives you the flexibility if you need\nit with custom roles and just the ease of\n\n403\n00:23:44.117 --> 00:23:47.937\ninstall and optimization available\njust by selecting a radio button.\n\n404\n00:23:47.937 --> 00:23:52.500\nSo the point is Microsoft has already\ndone the research as to the best\n\n405\n00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.025\ncombination of application and\nservices, etc.,\n\n406\n00:23:56.025 --> 00:23:59.484\nand components to run based\non what you're using.\n\n407\n00:23:59.484 --> 00:24:00.696\nThe SharePoint server four.\n\n408\n00:24:00.696 --> 00:24:02.496\nIt's not one size fits all.\n\n409\n00:24:02.496 --> 00:24:04.670\nThis is a huge benefit.\n\n410\n00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:09.960\nIn fact, if your deployment somehow falls\nout of line with Microsoft recommendation\n\n411\n00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.990\nin terms of an extra service running or\none isn't running that should be.\n\n412\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.680\nYou'll get notified about that.\n\n413\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.910\nSo very handy,\nagain we always wanna be notified.\n\n414\n00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.990\nWe don't want to have to go\nlooking in the event logs, or\n\n415\n00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.020\nyou know running reports\nto find out what's wrong.\n\n416\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.400\nI mean sometimes that's useful for\nhistorical analysis,\n\n417\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.950\nbut whenever possible we want to be\nalerted when something is wrong.\n\n418\n00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.790\nBecause who has time, nobody has\ntime to scour all the event logs.\n\n419\n00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.940\nBecause you're probably not just running\nshare point in your organization,\n\n420\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.270\nyou're probably responsible for\nother jobs as well.\n\n421\n00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.990\nSo the more we can have\ninformation coming to us\n\n422\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.780\nRelevant information coming to us,\nthe better.\n\n423\n00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.900\nSo again, you'll be alerted if\nany of the rules you're running\n\n424\n00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.840\nsomehow fall out of compliance\nwith Microsoft's best practices.\n\n425\n00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.240\nWhat else is new?\n\n426\n00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.900\nSince that is the theme of this episode,\nmobile experience.\n\n427\n00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.900\nSo better mobile view it.\n\n428\n00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.550\nWe're also touch optimizing now and\nhave been since 2013.\n\n429\n00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.270\nSo assuming that people are going\nto use a variety of devices,\n\n430\n00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.620\nmany of them are touch enabled.\n\n431\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:12.760\nSo that means if you're thinking\nfrom a user experience perspective,\n\n432\n00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.470\nyou don't want links crammed in together,\nbecause it's very easy,\n\n433\n00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:21.680\neven if you're using a proper pen\nwith a rubber tip, it's still,\n\n434\n00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.880\nif the links are too close together, for\nexample, it's easy to click the wrong one.\n\n435\n00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.540\nSo by touch optimizing,\nwe have enough space around each option so\n\n436\n00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.970\nthat it's more likely the user is\ngonna click on what they intended to.\n\n437\n00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.200\nOkay, so there's tiles and\n\n438\n00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.530\nlinks available as well when you\ngo into a site on a mobile device.\n\n439\n00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.870\nSo again, a better experience for\nmobile users.\n\n440\n00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.880\nOkay, there's new controls if\nyou're using OneDrive for Business.\n\n441\n00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.420\nAgain, we're gonna be\ndemoing a lot of this.\n\n442\n00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.070\nComing up later this week.\n\n443\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.030\nSo when you go use OneDrive and\n\n444\n00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.810\nclick the waffle,\nthat's in the upper left there for you.\n\n445\n00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.160\nWe've got different\nOneDrive options available.\n\n446\n00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:08.370\nSo the ability to upload files with a tile\nthere, to be able to synchronize files for\n\n447\n00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:12.600\noffline use, and the ability for\nyou to share your files as well.\n\n448\n00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.660\nSo these are some of the simple controls.\n\n449\n00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.920\nWe've got the open\ndocument format available,\n\n450\n00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.490\nso you know Microsoft does\nplay nice with others.\n\n451\n00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.850\nIt's not entirely a close shop especially\non the new leadership with Satya.\n\n452\n00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.758\nI mean he's pretty much\nabout collaboration, and\n\n453\n00:26:26.758 --> 00:26:31.449\nI guess competition is the jargon word\nwhere you're competing and cooperating.\n\n454\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.600\nWith frenemies I guess,\ncorporate frenemies if you will.\n\n455\n00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:44.220\nOkay, so the point is we can use,\nusers can save files in the ODF format\n\n456\n00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:50.680\nso they can use non Microsoft\ntechnologies to edit whatever they save.\n\n457\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.470\nNow, this is something cool.\n\n458\n00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.110\nThe next one is Project Server 2016.\n\n459\n00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.410\nSo there's a lot of capabilities,\n\n460\n00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:00.440\nit's, Project 2016 is installed with\nEnterprise version of SharePoint,\n\n461\n00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:05.910\nthat's how closely integrated they are,\nbut Project Server is licensed separately.\n\n462\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.930\nAnd I'm gonna show you later in the week\nhow to enable, to turn on or unlock that\n\n463\n00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.770\nproject server functionality, because\na lot of organizations will use it.\n\n464\n00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.310\nSome will and there's been some\ngreat success stories about\n\n465\n00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.490\norganizations successfully\nintegrating sheriff went project.\n\n466\n00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.310\nWe definitely wanna do things like\neliminate multiple iterations of task list\n\n467\n00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.900\nso the ability to synchronize task lists\nis available now which is super handy.\n\n468\n00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.610\nSo whether you're using your\noutlook client, project server or\n\n469\n00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.560\nyour project client, your share point.\n\n470\n00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.900\nIt's gonna be a synchronized unified\ntask list, and that is super handy.\n\n471\n00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.290\nI mean, I don't know about you, but\nI don't need another place to go for\n\n472\n00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.720\nreminders or\nanother list online or offline.\n\n473\n00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.600\nIt's overwhelming.\n\n474\n00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.270\nCertainly can be.\n\n475\n00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:52.290\nSo whatever we can do to get\na handle on how data comes to us and\n\n476\n00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:53.970\navoid duplication, I'm all for it.\n\n477\n00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.730\nSo I'll show you how to enable\nproject server this week.\n\n478\n00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:01.490\nAnd let's see, if you're into\n\n479\n00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:05.470\nBI Business intelligence functionality\nwith SharePoint, you're gonna love this,\n\n480\n00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:11.190\nPowerPivot add-in, and Power View\nare available to use with SharePoint 2016.\n\n481\n00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.080\nSo there's so many cool,\nit's one of my favorite technologies.\n\n482\n00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.230\nAnd I'd say SharePoint's number one,\nbut the related BI technology's number\n\n483\n00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:20.430\ntwo in terms of my favorite\ntechnology is Microsoft.\n\n484\n00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.950\nThere's so much you can do visually\nin terms of displays and reports.\n\n485\n00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.720\nSo those of you who have stuff in there,\n\n486\n00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.290\neither with single server\nanalysis services,\n\n487\n00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.810\nintegration services, reporting services,\nwill love the Power Pivot add in.\n\n488\n00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.110\nOkay, we'll get to that\nlater in the week as well.\n\n489\n00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:36.779\nVarious Power View reports.\n\n490\n00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.730\nWorkbooks is a data source.\n\n491\n00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.350\nAll this is available in SharePoint.\n\n492\n00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.770\nOkay, in terms of sharing there's\nimprovements there as well.\n\n493\n00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.830\nSo the ability to create and\nshare a folder.\n\n494\n00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.060\nThe ability to see, let's say you've\nshared a folder already with certain\n\n495\n00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.450\npeople, but you can't remember who.\n\n496\n00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:59.420\nIt's easier to see who you've\nshared a folder with now.\n\n497\n00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.315\nMembers have the ability to share,\nnot just owners.\n\n498\n00:29:03.315 --> 00:29:03.815\nFirst.\n\n499\n00:29:05.965 --> 00:29:09.655\nThere is a one-click email to approve or\ndeny a request for access.\n\n500\n00:29:09.655 --> 00:29:11.995\nSo again,\nwhatever we can streamline the better.\n\n501\n00:29:11.995 --> 00:29:17.185\nI was at a GoToMeeting session recently,\nand\n\n502\n00:29:17.185 --> 00:29:22.300\nthere was a few steps to do from my\nclient email on my computer, and\n\n503\n00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.960\nthen I got disconnected,\nactually my battery dies is what happened.\n\n504\n00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.410\nSo I went to my iPhone, and\nI went to the same email, and one click.\n\n505\n00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.730\nBoom, the quote immediately opened up.\n\n506\n00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:30.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I didn't have to log in.\n\n507\n00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.270\nThat's how simple we should be making.\n\n508\n00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.370\nAnd a lot of organizations realize this,\nand Amazon, others are pioneering in that.\n\n509\n00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.820\nAs simple as possible for\nthe user, no complicated log on.\n\n510\n00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.130\nIdeally one click, and so\n\n511\n00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:49.270\nwe have one click to approve or\ndeny requests for access.\n\n512\n00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:55.020\nI've also heard people say if I\nsend more than one request for\n\n513\n00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.940\ninformation, or one question to my boss,\n\n514\n00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.090\nmy boss only answers whatever\nthe first question is in an email.\n\n515\n00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.000\nSo then they get trained to send\nseparate emails for each request.\n\n516\n00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.430\nWell, you know people want simplicity,\nwant to click yes or no on grant or\n\n517\n00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.290\ndenying access to this resource.\n\n518\n00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.680\nOkay, in terms of the Share Point search\nservice application improvements there,\n\n519\n00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:22.320\nwe can index up to 500 million items\nper search server application.\n\n520\n00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.740\nThat sounds like a lot, but I think in\na few years it won't seem like that much.\n\n521\n00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.650\n>> True. [LAUGH] >> So the need to create\na separate surge server application,\n\n522\n00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.190\na search service\napplication is going down.\n\n523\n00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.710\nThere maybe again political reasons,\nthey have two separate ones but\n\n524\n00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.380\nthat's another story.\n\n525\n00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.120\nWe may wanna set up SSL for\na central admin site.\n\n526\n00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.310\nWe can do that now simply\nwith a commandlet using use\n\n527\n00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:50.830\nsp central administration and specify a\nport number and then the whatever port is.\n\n528\n00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.190\nAnd then your sockets there parameter.\n\n529\n00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.210\nI won't show you that one.\n\n530\n00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:58.580\nBut it's very easy to set up as a cell for\ncentral admin.\n\n531\n00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.960\nWe have three options for\nsite collection upgrades.\n\n532\n00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.940\nWe're gonna look at that late in the week\nas well upgrading from 2013 to 2016, so\n\n533\n00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.470\nwe got more options now to\nupgrade our site collections.\n\n534\n00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.430\nWe can also encrypt our SMTP connection.\n\n535\n00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.250\nAnd then we're gonna also have site\npages pinning is something new as well.\n\n536\n00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.090\nSo let's say we want to\nfollow certain sites,\n\n537\n00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.690\nwe can pin them at the top as opposed to\nunnecessarily having to scroll around,\n\n538\n00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.110\nlook around for sites you want to follow.\n\n539\n00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.700\nWe can pin them.\n\n540\n00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.440\nThat's handy.\n\n541\n00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.600\n>> Very convenient.\n\n542\n00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.830\n>> Okay, that's enough for\n\n543\n00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:37.010\nwhat's new, becoming almost everything\nI touched on in this episode.\n\n544\n00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:40.410\nI'll be showing you more detail\non as we go through the week.\n\n545\n00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.390\n>> Fantastic, Mark.\n\n546\n00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.920\nReally good look and hopefully getting\neveryone excited about some of the new\n\n547\n00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.120\nthings and things we're going to be doing\nin our SharePoint series, as you said,\n\n548\n00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.530\nwe progress through the week.\n\n549\n00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.720\nLot of really cool new features that\nI know I'm excited about seeing\n\n550\n00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.440\nwith SharePoint 2016.\n\n551\n00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.240\nSo we thank you for that,\nlaying all that out for us.\n\n552\n00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.080\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n553\n00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.760\nSigning out for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n554\n00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.971\n>> I'm Mark Ingram\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n555\n00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:12.270\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:20.510\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.740\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngoing to be talking about what's been\n\n5\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.880\nremoved from this new edition, right?\n\n6\n00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.310\nWe had an episode where we talked\nabout some of the new features,\n\n7\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.310\nwe also need to be familiar with\nwhat's not going to be there\n\n8\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.590\nwhen we migrate to 2016 or install 2016.\n\n9\n00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.410\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n10\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.190\nHow are you doing, Mark?\n\n11\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.980\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n12\n00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.440\nYeah, let's.\n\n13\n00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.940\nSo, it's one thing to know what's new.\n\n14\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.130\nWe covered that in another episode,\npeople generally want to know what's new,\n\n15\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.250\nthe latest and greatest and\nstart work right away.\n\n16\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.880\nBut as we talked about in another episode,\nthe importance of planning,\n\n17\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.130\narchitectural design are very important.\n\n18\n00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.390\nIf you want to know what's new,\nthat's good.\n\n19\n00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.910\nYou also need to be prepared for\nwhat's not there anymore, or\n\n20\n00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.529\nwhat functionality has been deprecated.\n\n21\n00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.690\nUnlearning what used to be there is\nimportant as well, so let's get to it.\n\n22\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.957\nAnd the first item is duet, and that's\nnot what Mike and I are doing right now.\n\n23\n00:01:11.957 --> 00:01:12.830\n>> [LAUGH] Thank goodness.\n\n24\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.265\n>> This is, yes, well,\nit's a form of duet.\n\n25\n00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:17.000\n>> [LAUGH] You can sing, I can't, so-\n>> No,\n\n26\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.585\nI was talking about just the banter.\n\n27\n00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:19.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There will be\n\n28\n00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.630\nno on-air performance of that sort.\n\n29\n00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.610\nAnyway, Duet Enterprise for SharePoint,\nthat was a collaboration between SAP P and\n\n30\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.930\nMicrosoft middleware essentially,\n\n31\n00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.600\nto help some of SAP's technologies\nintegrate better with SharePoint.\n\n32\n00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.360\nUnfortunately, there's no support for\nit [LAUGH] in SharePoint 2016, which means\n\n33\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.510\nyou could go the custom coding route,\nor just remain on SharePoint 2013.\n\n34\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.620\nSo, one of the things we haven't\ntalked about is the Importance for\n\n35\n00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.240\ncertain organizations to log behind.\n\n36\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.480\nEven two or\nthree major versions behind in SharePoint.\n\n37\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.520\nCertain military environments for example,\nthere's so much testing required, and\n\n38\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.860\nthey standardize on a platform for\nx number years in the future.\n\n39\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.510\nSo, some organizations\nare actually surprising.\n\n40\n00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.630\nYou might think they'll be a little\nmore cutting edge, but actually no,\n\n41\n00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.370\nthey're behind the curve.\n\n42\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.860\nBanking as well as another example,\nsometimes they seem to be cutting edge,\n\n43\n00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.380\nother times way behind.\n\n44\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.590\nNow behind sounds like a bad thing,\nit's a smart thing if that's what your\n\n45\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.730\nsoftware support and allows for,\nX number years of testing.\n\n46\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.970\nI'm not denigrating previous versions,\nbut this is an example of a time where\n\n47\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.550\nif this duet integration was very\nimportant to our organization, and\n\n48\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.370\nor you didn't want to spend\nthe money to create middleware,\n\n49\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.851\nthen it makes sense to\nremain on SharePoint 2013.\n\n50\n00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:36.420\nOther technology has been deprecated or\n\n51\n00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.340\nat least not being renewed or\nadvanced an info path.\n\n52\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.680\nSo, if you work with forums design,\nthere's a 2013 edition and\n\n53\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.698\nthere isn't going to be no more.\n\n54\n00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:48.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> There will be support for\n\n55\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.460\nten more years at least\nwhich is kind of weird,\n\n56\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.400\nyou'd think they'd just\nput a new number on it so\n\n57\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.040\nit seems like it's current with\nthe current version of SharePoint, but no.\n\n58\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.070\nAt least Microsoft's\nbeing upfront about it.\n\n59\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.570\nThey're not going to create\nanother InfoPath version.\n\n60\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.830\nAt least, that's the story at this point.\n\n61\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.830\nSo you can use, it's totally fine to\nuse InfoPath 2013 with 2016 in future\n\n62\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.660\nreleases of SharePoint.\n\n63\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.980\nThere's no problems there.\n\n64\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.270\nJust don't look for\nthe new number of that version.\n\n65\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.810\nSimilarly, SharePoint Designer won't\nbe updated to reflect the number 2016,\n\n66\n00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.690\nthat version SharePoint,\nbut you can still use it.\n\n67\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.920\nOkay, SharePoint foundation is out,\nso that was the free version.\n\n68\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.480\nUsed to be Windows SharePoint services\ncame with your server license,\n\n69\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.500\nthe idea there was,\nyou know, like Starbucks,\n\n70\n00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.230\nwe would want to sample a new product,\nsame kind of idea.\n\n71\n00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.878\nOops, there's branding, again.\n\n72\n00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:41.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Product placement.\n\n73\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.960\nOkay, anyway.\n\n74\n00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.180\nThe point is, a lot of businesses\nwant to give a free teaser offer.\n\n75\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.410\nAnd the idea there is with\nWindows SharePoint services and\n\n76\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.740\nWindows foundation, or\nSharePoint foundation rather,\n\n77\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.930\nwas that companies would\ndip their toe in the water,\n\n78\n00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.610\nget familiar with SharePoint and then bump\nup against limitation in the free product.\n\n79\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.520\nAnd some of them would invest\nthe big bucks in a standard or\n\n80\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.120\nenterprise full SharePoint license.\n\n81\n00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.032\nThey're by design, and\nfor obvious reasons,\n\n82\n00:04:09.032 --> 00:04:11.740\nthere would be limitations in\nthe free version of the product.\n\n83\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.690\nSo that's gone.\n\n84\n00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.360\nSharePoint foundation's gone,\nstan low install mode is gone as well.\n\n85\n00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.030\nYou can install the SharePoint\ncomponents of one machine, but\n\n86\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.950\nyou would have had to installed SQL\nserver on that machine in advance.\n\n87\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.670\nWhen I'm saying machine,\n\n88\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.004\nI'm always referring to either virtual or\nphysical machines.\n\n89\n00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:31.100\nSo that standalone mode requires\na little more work on your part.\n\n90\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.420\nYou have to set up SQL in advance and then\ninstall all the SharePoint components on\n\n91\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.970\na single server and that's available\nfrom the Startup Wizard, but\n\n92\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.810\nmore likely these days you're going to\nchoose one of the mini role options we\n\n93\n00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.080\ncovered in another episode like search,\nor web front end,\n\n94\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.190\ncash, and custom possibly, so other roles.\n\n95\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.290\nAnother thing that's gone is FIM,\nthe forefront identity manager client.\n\n96\n00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.191\nSome of you may be using FIM,\nit's been replaced with MIM,\n\n97\n00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:02.790\ngot to love the acronyms\nMicrosoft Identity Manager.\n\n98\n00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.526\nYou could impress your friends or\n\n99\n00:05:04.526 --> 00:05:08.128\nalienate your friends at cocktail\nparties by speaking in acronyms.\n\n100\n00:05:08.128 --> 00:05:10.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> LOL.\n\n101\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.040\n>> As well, yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.270\n>> What's that?\n>> Good for trivia as well.\n\n103\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.020\n>> Yes, for trivia, you never know.\n\n104\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.768\nPlaying at the bar with all\nthose multiplayer games.\n\n105\n00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:17.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so.\n\n106\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.168\nThe technology behind FIM is still around,\nit's just that FIM client is gone,\n\n107\n00:05:22.168 --> 00:05:26.545\nForefront Identity Manager, which is a\ngreat tool to synchronize from a different\n\n108\n00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:28.840\napplication identity information.\n\n109\n00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.700\nYou might have HR database, Active\nDirectory, some other line of business\n\n110\n00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.800\ndatabase, FIM takes care of\nthe integration and synchronization of\n\n111\n00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.100\nchanges made in one database replicating\nthose changes to other databases.\n\n112\n00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.010\nThat FIM client is gone.\n\n113\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.980\nAnother thing that's\nchanged in this version of\n\n114\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.750\nSharePoint 2016 is Excel services.\n\n115\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.620\nSo, we're no longer\nhosting Excel services and\n\n116\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.070\nrelated BI technologies\non a SharePoint server.\n\n117\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.140\nThat fundamental technology to Excel\nis now hosted with Excel Online\n\n118\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.250\nin the Office Online Server.\n\n119\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.440\nAnd if you're familiar with\nOffice web apps server in 2013,\n\n120\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.260\nthat's the same function,\nOffice Online Server.\n\n121\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.230\nAnd as I've been saying, that's something\nwe'll be covering in more detail, and\n\n122\n00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.910\nwith some hands-on,\nI'll show you later in the week.\n\n123\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.740\nSo that's different.\n\n124\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.727\nAnd so, if you're using Excel\nservices now in 2013, and\n\n125\n00:06:25.727 --> 00:06:30.380\nyou want to upgrade Excel services, you'd\nhave to then deploy the Office Online\n\n126\n00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.640\nserver to make sure your Excel services\nfunctionality remains available.\n\n127\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.075\nOkay.\n\n128\n00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:42.555\nThere's some SharePoint BI capabilities,\nand\n\n129\n00:06:42.555 --> 00:06:47.325\nthings like a PowerPivot Gallery,\na schedule data refresh.\n\n130\n00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:51.695\nSo these are some new BI capabilities\nthat weren't available before or\n\n131\n00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:53.885\nmodified from the 2013 version.\n\n132\n00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:56.670\nPowerPivot Management dashboard,\nwe'll be covering.\n\n133\n00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.770\nThe BI integration with SharePoint\n2016 later in the week as well.\n\n134\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.430\nIn terms of deprecated features, the\ndefinition of deprecated in this context\n\n135\n00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.660\nmeans that the role of\nthe feature has been diminished,\n\n136\n00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.010\nit still works, it may not be\nsupported in the next versions.\n\n137\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.220\nThe idea is they want you transition\naway to another tool while there's time,\n\n138\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.950\nbefore it's an urgent situation.\n\n139\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:26.930\nSo, tags and notes falls under\nthe category of deprecate items, and\n\n140\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.350\nyou could still work with your existing\ntags notes, anchoring new tags and notes.\n\n141\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.329\nBut the next release, at this point,\nI mean, everything's subject to change,\n\n142\n00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:38.186\nbut this point tag notes will be gone for\nthe next release.\n\n143\n00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:46.540\nAnd finally, STS 80M.exe now, the death\nof STM STS 80M has been long predicted.\n\n144\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.425\nIt will not die.\n\n145\n00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:53.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, the PowerShell is the way to go.\n\n146\n00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.390\nSo, I strongly recommend whatever\nthere might be one or two tasks or\n\n147\n00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.850\nroutines you're still using\nwith a Script using SDS ADM.\n\n148\n00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.000\nDefinitely now is the time to\ntransition away from that.\n\n149\n00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.690\nIf you never use it again,\nI'd be happy for you.\n\n150\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.470\nPowerShell can accomplish whatever\nyou were doing with SDS ADM before.\n\n151\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:12.970\n>> Absolutely.\n\n152\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:20.310\n>> And that's it for,\nthose are remove re-deprecated features.\n\n153\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.820\n>> And not too long of a list there, but\nagain, just an extremely important part of\n\n154\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.470\nunderstanding SharePoint and learning\nSharePoint, because especially with\n\n155\n00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.430\nthe deprecated stuff I find,\nyou know having that warning.\n\n156\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.680\nBecause you might have hours and\n\n157\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.725\nhours of development on scripts\nthat are going that you use in you\n\n158\n00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:41.400\nSharePoint environment, and if they just\nyanked them, you'd be kind of stuck.\n\n159\n00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.740\nWhereas by telling you hey look,\nthey're still there, but\n\n160\n00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.070\nwe're saying you should start\nmigrating away from them.\n\n161\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.240\nStart now, planning some way\nto move away from them, so\n\n162\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.250\nthen when we do pull the plug on those,\nyou're not left in the dark and\n\n163\n00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.340\njust kind of up the creek\nwithout a paddle.\n\n164\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.830\nSo, you got to pay attention\nto those deprecated features.\n\n165\n00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.280\nIf we use them, we got to make\nsure we're getting away from them\n\n166\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.800\nbefore that next release because you'll\nnever know what's going to happen.\n\n167\n00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.587\nAll right, Mark.\n\n168\n00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:09.690\nWe thank you for that list of removed and\ndeprecated features in Sharepoint 2016.\n\n169\n00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.900\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n170\n00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.420\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n171\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.110\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n172\n00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.962\n>> And

00:00:19.708\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\ntoday, we're doing SharePoint 2016,\n\n4\n00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:21.450\nthe advanced version.\n\n5\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.980\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be looking at high availability and\n\n6\n00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.390\ndisaster recovery, both very important\nparts in our SharePoint design.\n\n7\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.354\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:33.534\nHow are you doing, Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.386\n>> Thanks, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:38.186\nYeah, so critical to your success\nas a SharePoint admin and\n\n11\n00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:40.618\nyour continued employment frankly.\n\n12\n00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:42.626\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is the ability to plan ahead for\n\n13\n00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:48.170\npotential disaster scenarios, and also to\nbe able to recover from those scenarios.\n\n14\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.230\nAnd that includes things from backup\nto failover of the data center or\n\n15\n00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.260\nto the cloud in the event of tornadoes or-\n>> Hurricanes.\n\n16\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.213\n>> Wash outs, yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:01.785\nI was gonna say acts of God,\nbut it's a vengeful God.\n\n18\n00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:03.507\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would wreak such havoc on\n\n19\n00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:04.115\nthe people.\n\n20\n00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:07.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n21\n00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.469\ncan you tell it's late in the day.\n\n22\n00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.330\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n23\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.722\n>> So before getting into some of the\ntheory, it's time for a little demo here.\n\n24\n00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:19.723\nSo we covered some of this in the first\ncourse, but it bears repeating,\n\n25\n00:01:19.723 --> 00:01:20.866\nrepeating is good.\n\n26\n00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:24.950\nIf we could switch over to my computer,\nformerly Mike's computer.\n\n27\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.709\nI stole it.\n\n28\n00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:26.600\n>> Thief.\n\n29\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.479\n>> Not getting it back.\n\n30\n00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330\nSo we're in central admin here.\n\n31\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.197\nThis won't be a surprise\nto any of you to see this.\n\n32\n00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:34.117\nIf you were with us in\nthe first course and\n\n33\n00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:38.740\nhave any experience at all at SharePoint,\nyou're used to the central admin site.\n\n34\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.825\nAnd from under the Backup and\nRestore section,\n\n35\n00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:49.170\nI'm gonna select to perform a backup and\nlet me get used to this computer.\n\n36\n00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.830\nSo we can see here, we can choose what\nto back up only from the farm level.\n\n37\n00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.080\nWhich includes not everything you need to\nrecover from a disasters we talked about\n\n38\n00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.470\nin the first course, but\na lot of the SharePoint related content.\n\n39\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.920\nWe can also get more specific than that,\nmore granular.\n\n40\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.825\nAnd you can see the various\ncheckboxes here.\n\n41\n00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:10.764\nA checkbox denotes something\nyou can back up by itself.\n\n42\n00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:15.490\nAnd for example,\nthe SharePoint service states service.\n\n43\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.475\nAnd one of the things I like about this\ninterface, Microsoft did a good job in\n\n44\n00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:22.409\nmaking it really obvious what\nyou're about to back up.\n\n45\n00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.167\nAnd by extension,\nwhat's not gonna be backed up,\n\n46\n00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:29.650\nbecause it's not in that nice little\nslate color or is it teal, I'm not sure.\n\n47\n00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.270\nBut at this point, I've selected\nthe SharePoint service date service, and\n\n48\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.960\nI can actually expand this date\nservice application if I wanted.\n\n49\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.170\nBut the point is, it's gonna be included,\nawesome database settings there.\n\n50\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.697\nSo the programming's intelligent\nenough to not let you select something\n\n51\n00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:49.306\nthat's sort of partial or incomplete or\nthat you couldn't restore from.\n\n52\n00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:53.325\nSo you can get granular like that or\nforum level or\n\n53\n00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:57.650\nindividual site collections,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n54\n00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.800\nSo for now, I'm gonna show you\nhow to back up at the farm level.\n\n55\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.095\nAnd right, thanks.\n\n56\n00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:10.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's Windows on a Mac, and I'm getting\n\n57\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.791\ncoaching here on the gestures, reminders\nabout how to navigate the screen.\n\n58\n00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.520\nYes cool, all right.\n\n59\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.354\nSo then I can click on Next, and\n\n60\n00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:26.028\nthen I've done a backup already,\nif you're wondering why?\n\n61\n00:03:26.028 --> 00:03:32.403\nHey, wait a minute the backup location\nhere whoops, is prepopulated.\n\n62\n00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:38.323\nHere we go, you can see it,\nthe backup location says SQL,\n\n63\n00:03:38.323 --> 00:03:42.470\nbackup, and estimated disk space required.\n\n64\n00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.764\nSo this is based on whatever we selected,\nI selected the entire farm.\n\n65\n00:03:47.764 --> 00:03:50.686\nIf I had chosen just the service app or\nsite collection of course,\n\n66\n00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:52.350\nit'd be much less.\n\n67\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.700\nAnd then there's a backup type of full and\ndifferential.\n\n68\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.280\nYou get other options if\nyou use third party for\n\n69\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.380\nyour backups like incremental for example.\n\n70\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.510\nAnd here I can choose to Back\nup only config settings, but\n\n71\n00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.460\nat this point, I wanna Back up content and\nconfiguration settings.\n\n72\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.810\nSo then I can click on Start Back Up.\n\n73\n00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.241\nSo I'm not gonna do that now,\n\n74\n00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:17.179\nbecause this back up will take\napproximately 15 minutes.\n\n75\n00:04:17.179 --> 00:04:22.341\nI did it before, so I cancel out of there.\n\n76\n00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:27.294\nThere we go, and I'm gonna show\nyou what it's like when we're\n\n77\n00:04:27.294 --> 00:04:31.319\ngonna delete something,\na service application.\n\n78\n00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.853\nAnd then we're gonna do a restore,\nand we'll see what that looks like.\n\n79\n00:04:34.853 --> 00:04:40.258\nSo I'm going to go into\n\n80\n00:04:40.258 --> 00:04:44.818\nback to-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:46.902\n>> Backup and Restore.\n\n82\n00:04:46.902 --> 00:04:53.419\nAnd I'm gonna click on Check backup and\nrestore our job status.\n\n83\n00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.900\nAnd the restore a job failed,\nactually it didn't.\n\n84\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.235\nThat's an old.\n\n85\n00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:00.563\n>> Is it the one that cancelled?\n\n86\n00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:03.495\n>> No,\nbecause this refers to a restore a job.\n\n87\n00:05:03.495 --> 00:05:04.632\n>> Okay.\n>> This is not a backup job.\n\n88\n00:05:04.632 --> 00:05:05.321\nThis is old,\n\n89\n00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:09.471\nlingering information because I was\nactually successfully able to restore.\n\n90\n00:05:09.471 --> 00:05:14.166\nSo I'm not sure why that's\nactually there at this point, but\n\n91\n00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:18.692\nthis shows the status of restores,\nso we can get a history.\n\n92\n00:05:18.692 --> 00:05:23.638\nYou can see what the success or\nfailure was of a given restore operation,\n\n93\n00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:25.560\nor a backup operation.\n\n94\n00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.983\nSo for now, I wanna restore From a Backup,\nand I only have one completed backup,\n\n95\n00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:35.682\nso it makes it easy to\nknow which one to select.\n\n96\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.375\nAnd I can expand if I want to make\nabsolutely sure I'm restoring\n\n97\n00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:44.176\nthe right one, or\nrestoring part of a certain backup.\n\n98\n00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:47.200\nSo that's the one I want,\nthat's the only one that exist.\n\n99\n00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.041\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'll click on Next.\n\n100\n00:05:57.015 --> 00:06:04.902\nAnd it's waiting I think it might have\nto take my two fingers together here.\n\n101\n00:06:04.902 --> 00:06:07.203\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To make sure that using two fingers at\n\n102\n00:06:07.203 --> 00:06:07.706\na time.\n\n103\n00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:11.111\nThis is a new operation here.\n\n104\n00:06:11.111 --> 00:06:12.926\n>> It's a beautiful thing.\n\n105\n00:06:12.926 --> 00:06:15.224\n>> Yes, it's a learning organization.\n\n106\n00:06:15.224 --> 00:06:16.485\n>> It's a skills market.\n\n107\n00:06:16.485 --> 00:06:17.886\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't do operating\n\n108\n00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:19.079\nsystem in front of him.\n\n109\n00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:22.085\nIt doesn't even faze him,\nhe just keeps on trucking with SharePoint.\n\n110\n00:06:22.085 --> 00:06:26.443\n>> [LAUGH] Thanks for\nthe behind the scenes prompt from Mike.\n\n111\n00:06:26.443 --> 00:06:27.987\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not like I type with two fingers\n\n112\n00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.827\neither, so I'm not used to that operation.\n\n113\n00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:33.850\nAt last, what's going on now?\n\n114\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.053\nI must have pressed one finger.\n\n115\n00:06:35.053 --> 00:06:36.801\nIt's still waiting,\nstill loading up there.\n\n116\n00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:40.042\nYou can see a little circle and\nnow is loaded.\n\n117\n00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:43.491\nSo because I backed up the full farm,\n\n118\n00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:49.068\nI can choose the entire farm or\nany elements of it to back up.\n\n119\n00:06:49.068 --> 00:06:52.444\nActually my bad, first I have to\ndelete something to make sure-\n\n120\n00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:53.028\n>> Here we are.\n\n121\n00:06:53.028 --> 00:06:54.726\n>> So the restore operation.\n\n122\n00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:58.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I got confused on the way to that link.\n\n123\n00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.780\nSo I'm gonna go Managed\nservice applications.\n\n124\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.290\nADD are us, and I just want to delete,\n\n125\n00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:12.290\nlet's say the machine translation service\nSo I select it by highlighting or\n\n126\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.640\nclicking next to the link,\nnot gonna click the link itself.\n\n127\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.325\nAnd for the ribbon I click eDlete,\nand Delete data associated absolutely,\n\n128\n00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:28.103\nand figure out the navigate\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:07:28.103 --> 00:07:30.076\n>> I can click okay anyway.\n\n130\n00:07:30.076 --> 00:07:31.240\nI always do that.\n\n131\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.470\nModel without scrolling, and\nit says it shouldn't take long.\n\n132\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.720\nMy question is, why does it take so long?\n\n133\n00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.289\n>> Yeah.\n\n134\n00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.351\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm agreeing with the dialogue box.\n\n135\n00:07:40.351 --> 00:07:42.188\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Later,\n\n136\n00:07:42.188 --> 00:07:46.632\nwe'll get a even smaller rectangle,\nstill saying it shouldn't take long.\n\n137\n00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:49.125\n>> Long is relative, evidently.\n\n138\n00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:51.100\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, that's right.\n\n139\n00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.372\nWhat would Einstein say?\n\n140\n00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:55.691\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll wait for it, and\n\n141\n00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.398\ninject witty banter.\n\n142\n00:07:57.398 --> 00:07:58.500\n>> That's right.\n\n143\n00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.996\nYeah, it was nice though to see that error\non the restore screen I thought, because.\n\n144\n00:08:02.996 --> 00:08:06.155\nAs one of those things or\non your back up in your restore screen.\n\n145\n00:08:06.155 --> 00:08:08.772\nCuz it's just something\nthat we need to verify.\n\n146\n00:08:08.772 --> 00:08:12.934\nI actually recently I was talking to\nsomebody that with their organization one\n\n147\n00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:15.969\nof their responsibilities was\nto be doing this backups.\n\n148\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.125\nAnd unfortunately, until it was time\nto do a restore that's when they found\n\n149\n00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:23.570\nout that the backups weren't\nbeing done properly.\n\n150\n00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.753\nThey weren't getting everything\nthey thought they were getting.\n\n151\n00:08:26.753 --> 00:08:30.603\nAnd had they been given some kind of\nwarning or bothered to read the log files.\n\n152\n00:08:30.603 --> 00:08:34.300\nBut the point is, you can't just assume,\njust because it says it completed,\n\n153\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.001\nyou can't assume that you've\ngot everything you need.\n\n154\n00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:39.016\nYou need to go back and\ncheck those logs or\n\n155\n00:08:39.016 --> 00:08:42.810\ncheck those error messages to verify\nthat hey yeah, we need to change this,\n\n156\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.746\nsomething's not getting included or\nat least test those restore processes.\n\n157\n00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:50.562\n>> Absolutely, true enough.\n\n158\n00:08:50.562 --> 00:08:53.617\nAll right, so now we're back\non the screen and hallelujah.\n\n159\n00:08:53.617 --> 00:08:55.780\nThe service application has been deleted.\n\n160\n00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:01.850\nSo I'll click OK, and then when\nthe page automatically refreshed,\n\n161\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.400\nwe can see the machine translation service\nis not in the list of service apps.\n\n162\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.600\nThat's what we wanted to see, because\nthat's the whole point of the demo,\n\n163\n00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.430\nis to delete something and\nthen restore it.\n\n164\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.278\nSo now I'll go back into Backup and\nRestore,\n\n165\n00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:19.218\nand restore from a backup.\n\n166\n00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:21.880\nWe've been through this road before.\n\n167\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.682\nI almost restored something\nthat was not in fact deleted.\n\n168\n00:09:26.682 --> 00:09:29.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would not be a very good demo.\n\n169\n00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.530\nSo this time, the next page\nshould load sooner, we'll see.\n\n170\n00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.077\n>> So basically, open up the back up and\nit's gonna show you all the things that\n\n171\n00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:41.176\nyou have backed up, and you can pick and\nchoose what it is you need to restore.\n\n172\n00:09:41.176 --> 00:09:43.987\nYou don't have to restore the entire farm.\n\n173\n00:09:43.987 --> 00:09:44.500\n>> Exactly.\n\n174\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.757\n>> Nice.\n\n175\n00:09:45.757 --> 00:09:47.956\n>> And I wouldn't do that.\n\n176\n00:09:47.956 --> 00:09:49.054\nI wouldn't put you through that.\n\n177\n00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:51.420\n>> [LAUGH] We appreciate that.\n\n178\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.604\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is taking its sweet time.\n\n179\n00:09:54.604 --> 00:09:57.665\nIt's not like we've under\npowered this VMs either.\n\n180\n00:09:57.665 --> 00:10:00.617\nSo, somebody at SharePoint\nitself just takes it sweet time.\n\n181\n00:10:00.617 --> 00:10:06.245\nSo now, we can restore elements from\nall the way up to the farm level or\n\n182\n00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:11.210\na sub components if you like or\nsmaller portions of the farm.\n\n183\n00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.772\nIncluding service applications or\nsite collections, so\n\n184\n00:10:13.772 --> 00:10:16.345\nwhat I just deleted was\nthe machine translation service.\n\n185\n00:10:16.345 --> 00:10:19.926\nSo let's look for that and restore it.\n\n186\n00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:26.940\nThere it is near the bottom there,\nso I'll select that checkbox only.\n\n187\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.617\nOf course, I could choose to restore\nother items that have been backed up and\n\n188\n00:10:30.617 --> 00:10:34.130\njust overwrite what's there now,\nbut there's no point in doing that.\n\n189\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.489\nSo I will scroll down\n\n190\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:50.800\nAnd next, and\njust a couple of options here.\n\n191\n00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:56.922\nDo I wanna restore this service\napplication in this case to a new\n\n192\n00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:59.512\nconfiguration or the same configuration?\n\n193\n00:10:59.512 --> 00:11:02.068\nSo in other words,\nam I restoring to a different machine?\n\n194\n00:11:02.068 --> 00:11:03.080\nIn this case, no.\n\n195\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.349\nI want the same configuration, and then I\nget a warning which is helpful, especially\n\n196\n00:11:07.349 --> 00:11:11.397\nwhen we're about to do something that\ncould be an RPE or Resume Producing Event.\n\n197\n00:11:11.397 --> 00:11:13.118\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's good to get these warnings.\n\n198\n00:11:13.118 --> 00:11:17.572\nOf course, it's only good if you actually\nread them rather than just click OK.\n\n199\n00:11:17.572 --> 00:11:20.822\nThey call that when you're going through\nwizard, they call it the spousal prompt.\n\n200\n00:11:20.822 --> 00:11:22.528\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\n201\n00:11:22.528 --> 00:11:25.478\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just kidding.\n\n202\n00:11:25.478 --> 00:11:29.845\nSo hit OK, cuz I do want to\noverwrite in case of conflicts,\n\n203\n00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:31.908\nthen I specify a password.\n\n204\n00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:37.969\nI'll type that in now.\n\n205\n00:11:37.969 --> 00:11:42.050\nLet's scroll down and start restore.\n\n206\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.235\nAnd for some reason it does take\na while to acknowledge on this\n\n207\n00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:53.246\nscreen anyway in fact that there's\na restore process going on.\n\n208\n00:11:58.848 --> 00:12:01.933\nSo will wait to see this occur.\n\n209\n00:12:01.933 --> 00:12:05.944\n>> So not unlike a lot of the other backup\nutilities we see throughout Windows\n\n210\n00:12:05.944 --> 00:12:06.599\nproducts.\n\n211\n00:12:06.599 --> 00:12:11.000\nYou've got to make sure you're doing your\nbackups and then you can go in there.\n\n212\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.702\nAnd assuming you've backed up at a higher\nlevel, like the entire farm like we did.\n\n213\n00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:18.399\nYou can always go back in and\npick sub components and restore them or\n\n214\n00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:19.860\nrestore the entire farm.\n\n215\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.450\nI really like the ability too,\nto pick and choose what I'm backing up,\n\n216\n00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.340\nbecause I might have different schedules.\n\n217\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.172\nI might back up that entire site or\nan entire farm on one schedule, but\n\n218\n00:12:28.172 --> 00:12:31.544\nsome of the other stuff that's\nmaybe a little more dynamic,\n\n219\n00:12:31.544 --> 00:12:33.742\nmaybe I want to back that up more often.\n\n220\n00:12:33.742 --> 00:12:35.519\nI don't have to back up\nthe entire farm every time.\n\n221\n00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:38.943\nI can go in and pick and\nchoose exactly what it is I wanna back up.\n\n222\n00:12:38.943 --> 00:12:39.755\nThey're very nice.\n\n223\n00:12:39.755 --> 00:12:41.555\n>> Indeed.\n\n224\n00:12:41.555 --> 00:12:43.374\n>> Can we schedule backups,\nI would assume in there as well?\n\n225\n00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:43.960\n>> Absolutely.\n\n226\n00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.718\n>> Nice.\n\n227\n00:12:45.718 --> 00:12:48.889\n>> We're still waiting for\nthis screen to refresh,\n\n228\n00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:51.917\nshowing us evidence of\nour restore operation.\n\n229\n00:12:53.368 --> 00:12:55.544\nTrust, but verify.\n\n230\n00:12:55.544 --> 00:12:58.357\nIt worked, was there any doubt?\n\n231\n00:12:58.357 --> 00:12:58.917\n>> No, never.\n\n232\n00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:00.972\n>> Okay, so [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n233\n00:13:00.972 --> 00:13:04.714\nWell we'll see with some of the complex\nPowerShell scripts we're gonna be running\n\n234\n00:13:04.714 --> 00:13:05.253\nthis week.\n\n235\n00:13:05.253 --> 00:13:07.565\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There may be some doubt.\n\n236\n00:13:07.565 --> 00:13:09.876\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then we'll edit those out and\n\n237\n00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:12.108\nyou'll never know,\nunless you're watching live.\n\n238\n00:13:12.108 --> 00:13:12.738\n>> That's right.\n\n239\n00:13:12.738 --> 00:13:17.154\n>> So we can see in the line that says,\nitem and\n\n240\n00:13:17.154 --> 00:13:22.808\nthen current/total,\none of four has been restored.\n\n241\n00:13:22.808 --> 00:13:24.877\nAt least we have some evidence there.\n\n242\n00:13:24.877 --> 00:13:30.006\nI'll hit Refresh again,\nand it's completed.\n\n243\n00:13:30.006 --> 00:13:32.563\nThat was fast, like that.\n\n244\n00:13:32.563 --> 00:13:34.216\nNotice the restore threads here,\n\n245\n00:13:34.216 --> 00:13:38.090\nthat's something we didn't talk\nabout in the first course.\n\n246\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.818\nThree is by default, dedicated.\n\n247\n00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:44.272\nIf you wanna increase the speed of\nbackups, we can allocate more threads or\n\n248\n00:13:44.272 --> 00:13:48.179\nin the case of restore,\nmore threads for the restore operation.\n\n249\n00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:54.482\nAnd now, Let's see, scroll up here.\n\n250\n00:13:54.482 --> 00:13:57.100\nNow let's go again, trust with verify.\n\n251\n00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.320\nGo back into application Manglement, and\nwe'll go into Manage service applications.\n\n252\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.377\nAnd voila!\n\n253\n00:14:06.377 --> 00:14:09.877\nThe machine's translations service has\nmiraculously, well not miraculously,\n\n254\n00:14:09.877 --> 00:14:11.370\nit's just a standard restore.\n\n255\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:11.900\nIt's back!\n\n256\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.000\nIt's back where it was.\n\n257\n00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.619\nSo that was just a little\nrefresher really.\n\n258\n00:14:15.619 --> 00:14:18.505\nLet's get on to the meat\nof this module for\n\n259\n00:14:18.505 --> 00:14:23.045\nthis episode on creating high\navailability architecture and for\n\n260\n00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:27.860\nShare Point 2016 we'll talk\nabout some concepts here.\n\n261\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:33.954\nSo yeah, high availability, if I say\nthat typically it means the up time,\n\n262\n00:14:33.954 --> 00:14:39.471\noften expressed as a percentage,\nfour nine 99.99% up time,\n\n263\n00:14:39.471 --> 00:14:42.496\nfive nines 99.999% up time.\n\n264\n00:14:42.496 --> 00:14:46.800\nSo various strategies for getting us\nto that high availability panacea.\n\n265\n00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.263\nNow you could theoretically have\n100% high availability, but\n\n266\n00:14:50.263 --> 00:14:53.650\nthat's gonna cost you a lot of money, and\nthe law of diminishing returns kicks in.\n\n267\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:54.890\nMost organizations for\n\n268\n00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.426\nat least some of the workloads\nare willing to accept some downtime.\n\n269\n00:14:58.426 --> 00:15:00.654\nIf you want 100%,\nyou're gonna pay a lot for it.\n\n270\n00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:03.345\nIf you can do with some unplanned outages,\n\n271\n00:15:03.345 --> 00:15:06.422\nthen it's gonna be a lot\nless expensive for you.\n\n272\n00:15:06.422 --> 00:15:11.008\nAnd then in another episode, we talked\nabout architecture design, this is another\n\n273\n00:15:11.008 --> 00:15:14.898\nfactor that has to be considered\nwhen choosing architecture design.\n\n274\n00:15:14.898 --> 00:15:19.220\nDo you wanna be responsible for\nthe high availability architecture and\n\n275\n00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.500\nbackups or do you want to offload some\nof that responsibility to Microsoft?\n\n276\n00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.710\nThat's up to you.\n\n277\n00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.130\nSo that maybe something high availability\nthat you say, you know what?\n\n278\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.160\nI could design this,\n\n279\n00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.750\nit's not a business priority right now\nI have other IT tasks to focus on.\n\n280\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.820\nSo I'm gonna essentially outsource that to\nMicrosoft or off load that responsibility.\n\n281\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.484\nIt'll cost you, but again maybe less\ntime than what your time is worth or\n\n282\n00:15:44.484 --> 00:15:46.863\nyour human resources time is worth.\n\n283\n00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:50.776\nAll right, so we definitely wanna\neliminate single points of failure,\n\n284\n00:15:50.776 --> 00:15:52.893\nthat's a pretty standard operation or\n\n285\n00:15:52.893 --> 00:15:56.177\nmethodology when we're talking\nabout high availability.\n\n286\n00:15:56.177 --> 00:16:00.623\nAnd this can go not just from\nthings like web applications.\n\n287\n00:16:00.623 --> 00:16:04.810\nMachines hosting various\nelements of our SharePoint farm.\n\n288\n00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.020\nBut also things like\nredundant power supplies.\n\n289\n00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:10.960\nSo in your data center, redundant\nconnections to the Internet, for example.\n\n290\n00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:17.550\nSo redundancy is not just specific to\nthe SharePoint tiers that we may deploy.\n\n291\n00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.290\nIt certainly includes that, but\nthere's If you think about it,\n\n292\n00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.705\nwhat could possibly go wrong?\n\n293\n00:16:21.705 --> 00:16:26.140\n[LAUGH] It's good to imagine\nthe worst thing that could happen for\n\n294\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.380\nyour organization and\nthen have a contingency plan,\n\n295\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.960\nor even if you or your boss decides not\nto spring for that contingency plan, for\n\n296\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.840\nexample a DR site a thousand miles away.\n\n297\n00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.730\nAt least you know what possible, and\nyou've made a conscious choice no,\n\n298\n00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.250\nwe're not gonna invest that money.\n\n299\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.000\nOr maybe you want to fail over to Azure,\nfor example.\n\n300\n00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.820\nSo that's another option,\nanother way people are leveraging Azure.\n\n301\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:57.220\nNot using it full time, but it's\navailable as a DR location, if you will.\n\n302\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.150\nAnd because it's hosted in the cloud,\n\n303\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.180\nyou're allowing then your users who may\nnot be able to get into the office.\n\n304\n00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.586\nMaybe the office burned to a crisp or\nflooded out.\n\n305\n00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:11.780\nBy [INAUDIBLE] to Azure that means that\nanyone with access to the Internet\n\n306\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.500\ncan access your data.\n\n307\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.383\nSo that's something to consider.\n\n308\n00:17:15.383 --> 00:17:19.241\nAll right, so let's look at a couple\n\n309\n00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:24.229\nof architecture slides\nnow on Mike's screen.\n\n310\n00:17:27.117 --> 00:17:28.821\n[CROSSTALK] Thank you.\n\n311\n00:17:28.821 --> 00:17:32.870\nSo this is a farm architecture\nsupporting high availability.\n\n312\n00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.440\nNow this is just a sample.\n\n313\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.940\nTake the principles from this slide,\nthat is available on TechNet or\n\n314\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:47.360\nyour exact combination of servers at\ndifferent tier level will probably vary,\n\n315\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.500\nbut this just gives you an idea.\n\n316\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.870\nThe point is redundancy.\n\n317\n00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.940\nSo, on the left-hand side there, we've\ngot redundant web content servers, and\n\n318\n00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.560\nthey happen to be labeled W1 through W4.\n\n319\n00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:03.570\nIn the middle tier, we've got application\nservices, servers rather, and notice\n\n320\n00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:09.610\nwe've got a couple of search query and\nindex machines, index partition on each.\n\n321\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.970\nAnd then, other related crawler roles.\n\n322\n00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.740\nThe crawler role crawls the content and\nmakes it indexable,\n\n323\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.130\nand therefore searchable.\n\n324\n00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:24.590\nSo there's two crawler roles there and\nin the back-end, we've got SQL server.\n\n325\n00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:30.250\nAnd we're gonna look at different\nkinds of redundancy in the back-end,\n\n326\n00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.910\nbut always on database high\navailability with synchronous command\n\n327\n00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.080\nhappens to be the example here.\n\n328\n00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.210\nAgain, we'll look at the different\nSQL high availability options,\n\n329\n00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.110\ntwo of which are, really have been\nreplaced, in terms of value and\n\n330\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:48.860\nease of deployment,\nby the always-on availability options.\n\n331\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:54.250\n>> A big thing I pick up from this, Mark,\nis that you're providing that redundancy\n\n332\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.280\nat every level,\nevery tier in your deployment, right?\n\n333\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.830\nYou can't just give\nyour redundancy at that\n\n334\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.060\nweb server level because that's not gonna\nhelp you if the SQL server goes out.\n\n335\n00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.882\nSo it seems important to redundancy\nat every tier in my architecture.\n\n336\n00:19:07.882 --> 00:19:09.322\n>> Absolutely, as the cliche,\n\n337\n00:19:09.322 --> 00:19:12.092\nyour chain is only as strong\nas the weakest link, right?\n\n338\n00:19:12.092 --> 00:19:14.862\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it is legitimate to say yes our\n\n339\n00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:17.240\nweb server is are redundant.\n\n340\n00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.670\nThat's true, but it doesn't mean that\nwhole SharePoint is redundant for\n\n341\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.830\nreasons Mike just articulated.\n\n342\n00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.250\nLet's go on to the next diagram please.\n\n343\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.770\nAnd here we see a virtualized environment.\n\n344\n00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:32.130\nRemember we can have virtual or\nphysical workload in SharePoint.\n\n345\n00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.705\nWe can even mix and match.\n\n346\n00:19:33.705 --> 00:19:39.160\nFor example, we happen to have\na couple of host servers And\n\n347\n00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:44.280\nwe have work loads spread across them and\nwe've got application server,\n\n348\n00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.620\nweb content server and the ability\nto fail over between physical hosts.\n\n349\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:55.106\nNow If you are preparing for\nthe loss, or lack of availability for\n\n350\n00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:59.792\na complete host server,\nif all of those VMs on rack 2 for\n\n351\n00:19:59.792 --> 00:20:05.117\nexample fail over to rack 1,\ncan rack 1 handle the workload?\n\n352\n00:20:05.117 --> 00:20:08.092\nSo it's always a trade-off when\nwe talk high availability.\n\n353\n00:20:08.092 --> 00:20:11.047\nIt's kind of like lanes of the I75.\n\n354\n00:20:11.047 --> 00:20:16.411\nThey're making 4 lanes to\n6 across 35 miles or so.\n\n355\n00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:18.307\nThankfully not this weekend.\n\n356\n00:20:18.307 --> 00:20:20.379\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But anyway, for\n\n357\n00:20:20.379 --> 00:20:25.503\nsome point in time those 6 lanes will be\nthe percentage utilization will be less\n\n358\n00:20:25.503 --> 00:20:30.779\nthan the utilization of 4 lanes, but then\nas always happens when you build, well\n\n359\n00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:36.844\nalmost always,when you build extra lanes,\npeople say, let's get that third car now.\n\n360\n00:20:36.844 --> 00:20:39.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For junior.\n\n361\n00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.870\nOr let's build a subdivision way\n\n362\n00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.010\naway from the metro center because\nnow people can commute faster.\n\n363\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.060\nAnd then just like hardware and\nsoftware, hardware gets faster,\n\n364\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.970\nthe software coders code to take\nadvantage of the increased power, so.\n\n365\n00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:00.830\nMy point is back to this specific example,\nif we are planning for\n\n366\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:05.780\nthe fail over of a complete host server\nwith all the VMs running on it to another\n\n367\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.900\nhost server, for example, that means in\nnormal operation when both rack 1 and\n\n368\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.590\nrack 2 are operating,\nthere's gonna be a lot of unused capacity.\n\n369\n00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.690\nSo there's a cost to that.\n\n370\n00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.900\nIt cost money to buy more expensive\nmachines, more cores, more ram,\n\n371\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:26.080\nmore storage,\nmore throughput to prepare for\n\n372\n00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.790\nin case an entire physical\nserver fails over.\n\n373\n00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:30.532\nIf it was just one or\n\n374\n00:21:30.532 --> 00:21:34.885\ntwo VMs failing over to another\nphysical host, that's different.\n\n375\n00:21:34.885 --> 00:21:38.460\nThat's a less of an increase\ncapacity required.\n\n376\n00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.020\nI think you get my drift.\n\n377\n00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.755\nIf not, write to Mike.\n\n378\n00:21:42.755 --> 00:21:45.100\n>> [LAUGH] And\njust to let everyone know as before,\n\n379\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.500\nthat came straight off of\nTechNet site from Microsoft.\n\n380\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.520\nI'll make sure I throw a link to\ntheir article in your show notes, so\n\n381\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.030\nyou can have access to\nthose diagrams as well.\n\n382\n00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.280\nAll right, Mark, so\nwe've got our backup and restore.\n\n383\n00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.300\nWe've talked about some high availability\nand redundancy in our architecture,\n\n384\n00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.140\nwhether it's on premises, or on premise,\nI should say, or farm deployed.\n\n385\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.350\nWhat's next?\n\n386\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.830\n>> Well, let's go to fail over clustering.\n\n387\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.380\nSo there's a variety of fail over\noptions when it comes to SQL.\n\n388\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.950\nWe'll look at various options and then I\nhave a recommendation as to what the best\n\n389\n00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.520\none is in your 2016 environment for\nSharePoint.\n\n390\n00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.855\nSo SQL server fail over cluster\nas a possibility, and so\n\n391\n00:22:24.855 --> 00:22:29.130\nwe've got fail over between cluster nodes.\n\n392\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.994\nDatabase mirroring is also a possibility,\nalthough,\n\n393\n00:22:32.994 --> 00:22:38.253\nwhat's better now is SQL server always on,\navailability groups, because\n\n394\n00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:43.124\nwe get the benefits of data redundancy and\nit's a lot easier to set up.\n\n395\n00:22:43.124 --> 00:22:47.417\nAnd you don't need special hardware or\nshared disks, for example.\n\n396\n00:22:47.417 --> 00:22:50.561\nYou can use the disks\nof the cluster members,\n\n397\n00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:53.140\nof the availability group members.\n\n398\n00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.396\nYou still could use database mirroring,\nbut\n\n399\n00:22:57.396 --> 00:23:01.160\nit's recommended to use the always\non availability groups.\n\n400\n00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.440\nIf you have any SQL experience,\n\n401\n00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.240\nyou're probably familiar\nwith that since SQL 2014.\n\n402\n00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:13.700\nOkay, so when it comes time to\nlook at any kind of backup or\n\n403\n00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.470\nhigh availability option, there's\na couple concepts that always appear.\n\n404\n00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.340\nRecovery time objective and\nrecovery point objective.\n\n405\n00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.980\nRecovery point objective refers to,\nhow much data are you willing to lose?\n\n406\n00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.940\nSo for some organizations,\nthey might say no data.\n\n407\n00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.130\n>> [CROSSTALK] Most people\nprobably start with no data.\n\n408\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:37.111\n>> Yeah, but then when you, given the cost\nestimate for that, they might say okay, we\n\n409\n00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:41.970\ncan use five minutes of data, say, or the\nlast one minute of data, what have you.\n\n410\n00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.330\nSo that's a factor to consider.\n\n411\n00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.610\nThat's recovery point objective.\n\n412\n00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.601\nRecovery time objective means\nhow long is it gonna take you\n\n413\n00:23:49.601 --> 00:23:50.950\nto get back to that point?\n\n414\n00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.285\nWhat's the process involved?\n\n415\n00:23:52.285 --> 00:23:55.099\nIs it simply a manual fail over option?\n\n416\n00:23:55.099 --> 00:23:57.260\nYou have to run a little script or\nsomething?\n\n417\n00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.570\nSo that is something to\nbe decided in advance.\n\n418\n00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.280\nAs an admin, you want to be measured and\nhave known metrics.\n\n419\n00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.190\nSo rather than have your boss scream at\nyou on the phone because a database is\n\n420\n00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:14.590\ndown, better to have performance metrics,\nthat if a content database goes offline,\n\n421\n00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.089\nfor example,\nyou have an hour to restore it.\n\n422\n00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.280\nThat can be your service level agreement.\n\n423\n00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:26.120\nSo we talked in the first course about the\nimportance of service level agreements.\n\n424\n00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.170\nBut it bears repeating that even if\nyou don't have a formal service level\n\n425\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.070\nagreement for uptime,\nlet's say in a SharePoint context or\n\n426\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.910\nExchange, or whatever else you're working\nwith, I suggest you have an informal\n\n427\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:40.710\nservice level agreement, which is fix\nthis asap or start looking for a job.\n\n428\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.390\nEspecially in the heat of\nbattle when you're trying to\n\n429\n00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.950\nrestore a conduit database,\nsay, from a backup perhaps,\n\n430\n00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:52.110\nmuch better to know in advance what\nthe standards are for how long you've got.\n\n431\n00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.950\nMight be four hours, might be a day.\n\n432\n00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.870\nDepends on, of course,\nhow critical the workload is.\n\n433\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.160\nSo different content databases\nin the SharePoint context.\n\n434\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.810\nYou might have different service\nlevel agreements as to how\n\n435\n00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.340\nfast you have to get those back online.\n\n436\n00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:09.490\nSo a lot of the comparisons between\nrecovery point objective and recovery time\n\n437\n00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.760\nobjective are the kinds of things\nthat are better looked at in a table.\n\n438\n00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.686\nSo we're not going to go through\nevery parameter there but\n\n439\n00:25:15.686 --> 00:25:19.388\nI'm just giving you options to consider or\ncharacteristics if you like,\n\n440\n00:25:19.388 --> 00:25:22.931\nparameters, recovery time objective,\nrecovery point objective.\n\n441\n00:25:22.931 --> 00:25:24.467\nOkay.\n\n442\n00:25:24.467 --> 00:25:27.293\nAnd then you can compare against\nthe database mirror option,\n\n443\n00:25:27.293 --> 00:25:30.760\nfail over clustering and\nalways on availability groups.\n\n444\n00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.810\nAnother option is a stretched farm,\nthis means it's like you're encapsulating\n\n445\n00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.290\ntwo data centers which could be a long\nway apart and treating them as one.\n\n446\n00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.690\nNow, you definitely need very low latency.\n\n447\n00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.820\nSo, that precludes a large\ngeographic distance,\n\n448\n00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.355\nunless you have fiber\nconnection which is possible.\n\n449\n00:25:49.355 --> 00:25:50.160\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n450\n00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.500\n>> So, generally there's some\nrelationship to physical proximity.\n\n451\n00:25:54.550 --> 00:26:01.680\nAnd different options for ensuring\nconcurrency, or consistency of the data.\n\n452\n00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.300\nSo it could be an asynchronous or\na synchronous situation where synchronous\n\n453\n00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.700\nmeans the data gets written in the remote\ndata center before it's committed\n\n454\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.870\nat the local center, asynchronous\nmeans there'll be some lag there.\n\n455\n00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.380\nOkay.\n\n456\n00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:16.980\nSo that's that.\n\n457\n00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.570\nLet's move on to the next concept here.\n\n458\n00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.110\nJust checking the time.\n\n459\n00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:25.250\nLet's look at supported high availability\nand disaster recovery options for\n\n460\n00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.830\nSharePoint.\n\n461\n00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.710\nSo the key thing here in terms of\n\n462\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.640\nhigh availability groups which I mentioned\nis the preferred way of going forward.\n\n463\n00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.130\nThere's two critical components\nof SharePoint that cannot be\n\n464\n00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.610\nmade highly available this way.\n\n465\n00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.288\nAnd that is your central admin database.\n\n466\n00:26:39.288 --> 00:26:43.980\nAnd also your config database.\n\n467\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.080\nRemember the config database is the farm.\n\n468\n00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.240\nYour central admin database\npretty critical as well.\n\n469\n00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.140\nThey cannot be part of a high availability\ngroup which means you need another\n\n470\n00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.990\nstrategy maybe involving log shipping for\n\n471\n00:26:54.990 --> 00:27:00.010\nexample to make those two particular\ndatabases highly available.\n\n472\n00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:07.462\nAnd depending on the service application,\nthere are different requirements as well.\n\n473\n00:27:07.462 --> 00:27:11.410\nBecause SharePoint can do so much,\nthere's dozens of service applications.\n\n474\n00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.280\nI would love to be able to tell you\nthere's a one size fits all solution for\n\n475\n00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.190\nmaking each of those service applications\nhighly available, but there isn't.\n\n476\n00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.744\nSo depending on your workloads\nthat you're running whether you're\n\n477\n00:27:21.744 --> 00:27:24.317\nrunning App Management for\nexample, or the BDC,\n\n478\n00:27:24.317 --> 00:27:27.030\nthe Business Data Connectivity\nService Database.\n\n479\n00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.338\nBy the way I'll be covering\nthat in another episode.\n\n480\n00:27:29.338 --> 00:27:31.992\nThat BDC service has its own episode.\n\n481\n00:27:31.992 --> 00:27:37.835\nManage Metadata Service Database,\nwhich again has its own episode.\n\n482\n00:27:37.835 --> 00:27:40.945\n[LAUGH] We're managing\nhigh availability for\n\n483\n00:27:40.945 --> 00:27:43.610\nthese different application\ndatabases differently.\n\n484\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.210\nAnd again, that's not something that\nlends itself to talking about but\n\n485\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.670\nI'm just giving the heads up on that and\nthen,\n\n486\n00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.985\ndepending on the workloads you're running\nyou should definitely investigate for\n\n487\n00:27:51.985 --> 00:27:56.245\neach of those service applications how to\nmake those databases highly available.\n\n488\n00:27:56.245 --> 00:27:59.375\nKeep in mind, as well, if you're\nwatching the first week we learned that\n\n489\n00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:03.430\neach service application that we\ncreate creates at least one database.\n\n490\n00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.710\nBut often several or\n\n491\n00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.500\nmore than one especially in terms of\nthe user profile service, for example.\n\n492\n00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.010\nSo that's another reason why there's\nno one size fits all approach\n\n493\n00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.260\nto making service applications\nhighly available.\n\n494\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.025\nCome to think of it, we have\na service applications episode too.\n\n495\n00:28:19.025 --> 00:28:21.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's like I tell people if they're\n\n496\n00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.630\nnew to SharePoint, I realize this is the\nadvanced course, but often, let's say you\n\n497\n00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.130\nwere watching the first week, and you'd\nnever interacted with SharePoint before.\n\n498\n00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:34.100\nIt's quite common to get progressively\nmore overwhelmed until the Friday,\n\n499\n00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.120\nwhen things start to come together.\n\n500\n00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:41.080\nBecause it's tough to talk about concepts\nin SharePoint in isolation, because so\n\n501\n00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.800\nmany concepts relate to others.\n\n502\n00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.090\nAnd until you've got\na grasp of all the others,\n\n503\n00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.590\nit's tough to make sense of the whole.\n\n504\n00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.950\nSo if you're,\nyou know that's just par for the course.\n\n505\n00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.050\nIt is a beast.\n\n506\n00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.160\n>> Yes\n>> It's a big animal.\n\n507\n00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So search database is another example\n\n508\n00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.790\nof different concepts to\nmake them highly available.\n\n509\n00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.450\nOkay, that's all I want to say there.\n\n510\n00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:06.340\nAnd now some best practices for\nbackup and restore.\n\n511\n00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:11.860\nYou definitely want to have low\nlatency between your SQL server and\n\n512\n00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.770\nthe backup location.\n\n513\n00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.700\nIn other words, don't have the backup\nlocation you might get clever and think\n\n514\n00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.140\nokay, I'm gonna put that backup location\nin Siberia because that's thousands of\n\n515\n00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:25.555\nmiles away, not a good idea because\nlatency issues will cause problems.\n\n516\n00:29:25.555 --> 00:29:28.480\nYou also want to make sure to\neliminate I/O as a bottle neck so\n\n517\n00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.490\nI have a lot of throughput there.\n\n518\n00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:35.114\nProcessing conflicts is a factor to keep\nin mind If you work in IT you're probably\n\n519\n00:29:35.114 --> 00:29:37.240\naware there's many cycles.\n\n520\n00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.120\nSharePoint itself has many cycles\nas we looked at in the first week.\n\n521\n00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.040\nTimer jobs run activities,\nsome happen in the matter of minutes,\n\n522\n00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.780\nsome are done hourly,\ndaily, weekly, monthly.\n\n523\n00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.578\nSo that's just within SharePoint.\n\n524\n00:29:50.578 --> 00:29:54.990\nBut within the bigger IT picture\nyou've probably got exchange databases\n\n525\n00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:59.800\nto back up, file servers to back up,\nother routine maintenance operations.\n\n526\n00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.920\nIf you have a monthly calendar and\nchunk it out into one hour blocks,\n\n527\n00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.208\nthere often is not a lot of spare time for\na new process.\n\n528\n00:30:08.208 --> 00:30:10.900\nEither it's gonna have too big\nof an impact on production users\n\n529\n00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.310\nespecially if you're a 24/7 shop where\nthe sun never sets on your business.\n\n530\n00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.470\nAnd then other routine backup activities.\n\n531\n00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.330\nSo you want to in terms of\n\n532\n00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:25.080\nkeeping some best practices you wanna\nhave smaller content databases.\n\n533\n00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.918\nI talked in the first week the basic\ncourse 100 to 200 gigabytes max\n\n534\n00:30:29.918 --> 00:30:31.513\nper content database.\n\n535\n00:30:31.513 --> 00:30:35.410\nThat gives you faster back up and\nfaster restore times right?\n\n536\n00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.756\nSo that is a key driver of the maximum\nsize of a given content database is,\n\n537\n00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:42.870\nhow fast can you restore it?\n\n538\n00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.770\nAgain, that goes back to\nservice level agreements.\n\n539\n00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.635\nSo in this episode, there's been\na lot of concepts intertwining.\n\n540\n00:30:48.635 --> 00:30:50.390\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Just in this episode.\n\n541\n00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.079\nAnyway, so smaller databases are better.\n\n542\n00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:00.190\nIncremental backup strategy is totally\nacceptable for larger databases.\n\n543\n00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.590\nSo the first database\nbackup would be huge, and\n\n544\n00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.810\nthen subsequent ones would be much faster.\n\n545\n00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:09.640\nUsing compression during\nbackup is a good idea.\n\n546\n00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.992\nWhenever we talk compression, like\nmany things in IT, there's a tradeoff.\n\n547\n00:31:12.992 --> 00:31:16.400\nThere's gonna be a processor hit on\neach end when you use compression.\n\n548\n00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.070\nHowever the benefit there is you\nget better bandwidth utilization,\n\n549\n00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.110\nmore efficient utilization of bandwidth.\n\n550\n00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:27.570\nRAID, if you're gonna use RAID,\nRAID 10 recommended.\n\n551\n00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:32.132\nSo if you have the budget for\nit so that's a mirror.\n\n552\n00:31:32.132 --> 00:31:33.540\nOkay.\n\n553\n00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.830\nAnd let's see, what else do we wanna say?\n\n554\n00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.880\nYou wanna test your back ups do trial\nrestore as Mike alluded to that earlier.\n\n555\n00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.410\n>> Very important.\n\n556\n00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.808\n>> And you know what, that is a long\nepisode, so I'm gonna stop talking now.\n\n557\n00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:53.839\n>> [LAUGH] All right Mark,\nwell important stuff.\n\n558\n00:31:53.839 --> 00:31:58.174\nWe appreciate you taking the time to give\nus all of that information because it\n\n559\n00:31:58.174 --> 00:32:01.709\nreally is a fundamental part of\ndesigning our architectures,\n\n560\n00:32:01.709 --> 00:32:05.330\nunderstanding that back up and\nrestore process as you hit into.\n\n561\n00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:09.973\nWe've got to worry about\nthe what do we call it, the time?\n\n562\n00:32:09.973 --> 00:32:11.615\n>> RPO and RTO?\n\n563\n00:32:11.615 --> 00:32:12.770\n>> Yeah, the RPO and the RTO.\n\n564\n00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.145\nThe recovery time objective,\nthe recovery point objective.\n\n565\n00:32:16.145 --> 00:32:19.180\nSLAs, all of these come into play.\n\n566\n00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.250\nAnd we need to know these before\nwe design everything, right.\n\n567\n00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.430\nBecause that's gonna change\nthe way we design it,\n\n568\n00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.490\nthe way we implement the fault towers or\nthe load balancing, or\n\n569\n00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.850\nthe redundancy, how big we make\nthe maximum size on these databases.\n\n570\n00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:35.080\nSo you can see that there's\na lot to the planning phase, and\n\n571\n00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.620\nwe have to have all this\ninformation ahead of time.\n\n572\n00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.790\nSo we appreciate you spending\nthe time explaining all that to us.\n\n573\n00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.300\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n574\n00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.746\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n575\n00:32:44.746 --> 00:32:45.925\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n576\n00:32:45.925 --> 00:32:47.147\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n577\n00:32:47.147 -->

00:00:20.289\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.958\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.150\nwe're gonna be looking at\nbusiness connectivity services.\n\n6\n00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.770\nAnd we got a lot of moving\nparts in Enterprise and\n\n7\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.500\nSharePoint can really get his fingers\nout into a lot of those pieces.\n\n8\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.010\nWe got to make sure we can\nconnect those different pieces.\n\n9\n00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.310\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n10\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.213\nHow are you doing Mark?\n\n11\n00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:38.235\n>> Mike, thanks very much.\n\n12\n00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:41.433\nSo if you're work at\norganization like many,\n\n13\n00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:46.435\nyou're not gonna have all of the business\ndata you need to make decisions\n\n14\n00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:51.201\nstored in house on a SharePoint\nenvironment or on your file servers.\n\n15\n00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:54.041\nOften we have to connect\ninto external systems, and\n\n16\n00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:57.700\nthat is the purpose of business\nconnectivity services.\n\n17\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.185\nThe acronym in BCS,\nit's not the Bull Championship Series.\n\n18\n00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:02.744\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is business connectivity services.\n\n19\n00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:07.569\nNow Microsoft has renamed this middleware\nover the course of the SharePoint's\n\n20\n00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:09.880\nhistory, but it does the same thing.\n\n21\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.444\nIt's middleware,\nit connects our SharePoint environment and\n\n22\n00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:17.736\noffice applications for example,\nto one or more external content sources.\n\n23\n00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:19.970\nAnd so anyway,\nthink of it like a translator.\n\n24\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.729\nThe middleware, the BCS middleware is\na translator between our SharePoint\n\n25\n00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.557\nenvironment and\napplications that our users would use.\n\n26\n00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:29.427\nLike we're gonna Excel in\nline of business apps and\n\n27\n00:01:29.427 --> 00:01:32.240\nthat external content\nsource wherever it lives.\n\n28\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.820\nSo that's the purpose of this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.880\nSo we're gonna look at the diagram\ncoming up shortly that will help you\n\n30\n00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.386\nunderstand what's going on in the various\nparts and components involved.\n\n31\n00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:49.549\nAnd then I'll show you how to\nconfigure that in your environment.\n\n32\n00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.570\nSo what are the various\ndata sources we can access?\n\n33\n00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.880\nThey could be any organized data source is\na candidate for connectivity through BCS.\n\n34\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.956\nSo I'm talking SQL databases or\nOracle databases for example,\n\n35\n00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:10.883\nOData web services, .NET connectivity\nassemblies are all candidates.\n\n36\n00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:15.840\nAnd then we can do things like index\nthat data on the external source.\n\n37\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.350\nSo one of the great things with\nSharePoint is the ability to use a search\n\n38\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.097\ninfrastructure, one search\ninfrastructure to index and\n\n39\n00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:29.457\ntherefore search on a variety of content\nsources in different data repositories.\n\n40\n00:02:29.457 --> 00:02:33.339\nSo if we can make it easy for users as\nopposed to say having them to look for\n\n41\n00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.260\nwhat they need in five different pages.\n\n42\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.890\nWith maybe different search interfaces and\ndifferent things to remember about how to\n\n43\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.750\nformat a query and\ndifferent abilities to filter?\n\n44\n00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.090\nNo, none of that, we're gonna have\neverything concentrated in one\n\n45\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.040\nsearch environment through SharePoint.\n\n46\n00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.260\nNow I'm not saying that's out of the box,\nready to go for your environment.\n\n47\n00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.470\nThere's a lot of search\nconfiguration required, and\n\n48\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.530\nwe will cover that in\nanother episode this week.\n\n49\n00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.620\nWe also talked about search in our\nfirst week of SharePoint 2016 content.\n\n50\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.413\nSo we'll cover search again more or later,\nbut for now I'm just pointing out some of\n\n51\n00:03:08.413 --> 00:03:12.619\nthe rational and reasons why you'd\nwanna set up BCS in your environment.\n\n52\n00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.160\n>> Really cool concept though\nthat- I can take SharePoint.\n\n53\n00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.130\nAnd even if the data is\nnot stored in SharePoint,\n\n54\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.680\nI can still create an index and give\nit that searchable capability outside.\n\n55\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.640\nLike you saying, SharePoint gonna create\nthe index not my external data source.\n\n56\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.537\n>> Exactly.\n>> Wow.\n\n57\n00:03:28.537 --> 00:03:32.737\n>> Exactly, so\nagain it’s not an out of the box solution.\n\n58\n00:03:32.737 --> 00:03:33.352\n>> Right.\n\n59\n00:03:33.352 --> 00:03:35.801\n[LAUGH]\n>> There's configuration required\n\n60\n00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.955\nthe fact, it could take you many days\nto properly complete your search and\n\n61\n00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:41.660\nthen tweak it overtime.\n\n62\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.936\nWe could also use business\ndata webparts as a tool or\n\n63\n00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:48.069\na way to access content\nin this external system.\n\n64\n00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.835\nSo one of the great things we'll\nSharePoints, we can surface webparts, and\n\n65\n00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:56.740\nwe have a dashboard type page,\nwhere information comes to us.\n\n66\n00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.930\nWe want as much as possible for\ninformation to come to us.\n\n67\n00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.280\nSo we could take action on it or\n\n68\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.715\nhave webparts that are easy\nto use to access content.\n\n69\n00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:06.538\nAs oppose to having to navigate\nthat external content source and\n\n70\n00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:11.220\nformat some really obscure query in\na language you don't really understand.\n\n71\n00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.110\nSo the more we can make it plain language,\n\n72\n00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.250\neasy to use for anyone that can use Office\napps or a browser, they will love you.\n\n73\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.347\nThe business will do better because of it,\nbecause people will get access to\n\n74\n00:04:22.347 --> 00:04:25.753\nthe information they need to\nmake proper business decisions.\n\n75\n00:04:25.753 --> 00:04:28.592\nAnother good reason to utilize BCS and\n\n76\n00:04:28.592 --> 00:04:33.660\nto access externally stored content\nis in the context of work flow.\n\n77\n00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.452\nSo a way companies are getting great\nvalue, and other organizations great\n\n78\n00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:43.320\nvalue from SharePoint, is to think\nthrough their processes that should and\n\n79\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.470\ncould be codified in a work flow.\n\n80\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.650\nSo a process might have\ntaken three weeks before.\n\n81\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.690\nMaybe if you start putting\ninto SharePoint context and\n\n82\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.020\ntaking advantage fo\nthe tools of SharePoint,\n\n83\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.030\nyou can reduce that workflow time and\nthat process to two weeks for example.\n\n84\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.740\nAnd perhaps reduce a bunch of\npaper base process along the way.\n\n85\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.210\nSo again,\nthere are some very basic workflows\n\n86\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.810\nwhich we'll look at in this week,\nbuilt into the product.\n\n87\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.980\nFor more complexity,\nwe do SharePoint Designer, and for\n\n88\n00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.000\nmore complexity still,\nwe're talking Visual Studio at that point.\n\n89\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.517\nSo as a tool to drive SharePoint\nworkflows that is another\n\n90\n00:05:24.517 --> 00:05:28.949\nreason to connect into these\nexternal sources of data.\n\n91\n00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.850\nSo we have a model and\nwe use business data connectivity models\n\n92\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.410\nto represent data entities\nwithin an external system.\n\n93\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.940\nSo again, it's a way of translating,\nmaking sense of\n\n94\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.310\ninteracting with that data that's stored\noutside of our SharePoint context.\n\n95\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.580\nOnce we create a BBC\nmodel that's portable,\n\n96\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.248\nin other words we can export it and\nimport it.\n\n97\n00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:53.090\nMaybe we wanna test it out in a dev\nenvironment or a test environment.\n\n98\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.370\nAnd then we can use the exact same model.\n\n99\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.620\nOnce we've tweaked it, and\nmade sure it works in the way we want it,\n\n100\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.630\nuse the same model in our\nproduction environment.\n\n101\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.840\nSo it's not like you have to\nstart from scratch in production.\n\n102\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.670\nIt's a portable model, we can create\non BDC model's in SharePoint Designer.\n\n103\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.040\nAlso using WCF web services,\nwe don't do that.\n\n104\n00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.470\nI won't be showing you\nthat in an upcoming demo.\n\n105\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.180\nWell that is a toll you could use.\n\n106\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.397\nAnd the service application built into or\npart business to kinda help you services\n\n107\n00:06:23.397 --> 00:06:26.466\ninclude the Service app,\nthe BBC service app itself.\n\n108\n00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:30.606\nAnd then the secure store service which\nis a way of storing credentials and\n\n109\n00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:31.490\nmapping them.\n\n110\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.080\nSo to avoid the problem of multiple\nlogins it usually might have.\n\n111\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.668\nThe more we can make a single\nsign on experience for our users,\n\n112\n00:06:39.668 --> 00:06:42.497\nthe more they will love you\nan utilize the tool and\n\n113\n00:06:42.497 --> 00:06:45.230\nnot pester help desk with request for-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n114\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.671\n>> Credential resets, etc.\n\n115\n00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:52.910\nSo to properly store those credential\nmappings we use the secure store service.\n\n116\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.354\nSo I'll show you how to\nset that up as well.\n\n117\n00:06:56.354 --> 00:06:59.455\nNow it's time for\nan architectured diagram, so\n\n118\n00:06:59.455 --> 00:07:03.094\nif we could switch to my screen please or\nmy other screen.\n\n119\n00:07:03.094 --> 00:07:04.363\nIt's a multi-computer environment here.\n\n120\n00:07:04.363 --> 00:07:07.958\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now astute viewers will see,\n\n121\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:13.451\nit says 2011, but\nthe principles still apply today.\n\n122\n00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:17.720\nThat's why we're using this model,\nit's not outdated, it's still relevent.\n\n123\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.950\nSo if I clock on the diagram,\nit gets me to this.\n\n124\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.176\nAnd depending on your browser you\nmight have to save it, re open it.\n\n125\n00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:31.110\nThings like this, anytime there's\na post to the Microsoft credit, and\n\n126\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.180\nthey create a lot of them.\n\n127\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.310\nThey're just really searchable on Technet.\n\n128\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.300\nAny kind of design diagram like this,\n\n129\n00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.140\nvery useful to print out as\nopposed to trying to remember it.\n\n130\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.130\nThat takes mental energy, but\nif you have it printed out.\n\n131\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.382\nMaybe you have it on a wall or cubical\nside or something that you can look at,\n\n132\n00:07:47.382 --> 00:07:50.218\nand really help you\nunderstand what's going on or\n\n133\n00:07:50.218 --> 00:07:52.731\nif you get stuck as\na trouble shooting tool.\n\n134\n00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:55.872\nYou might have forgotten that's something\nreally basic that you knew an year ago.\n\n135\n00:07:55.872 --> 00:07:59.406\nAnd then by just looking at this\ndiagram you say, yeah of course,\n\n136\n00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:02.328\nthis a place to look as to why\nthis behavior has changed.\n\n137\n00:08:02.328 --> 00:08:05.228\nIt's not obviously a thorough\ntrouble shooting tool, but it.\n\n138\n00:08:05.228 --> 00:08:10.377\nAt this stage to conceptualize what we're\ndoing here with the [INAUDIBLE] services,\n\n139\n00:08:10.377 --> 00:08:11.690\nit's a useful tool.\n\n140\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.760\nSo let's look at that.\n\n141\n00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.930\nI'll let you look at that on\nthe screen in front of you there.\n\n142\n00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:22.290\nThe BDC service application, this is\nwhat stores and manages BDC models.\n\n143\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.297\nModels are stored in\nthe BDC Metadata store,\n\n144\n00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:31.000\nmetadata cache, and\nthen the model definition is\n\n145\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.620\nretrieved when a user requests data\nfrom one of the external data sources.\n\n146\n00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.590\nSo on the right hand side of your screen,\n\n147\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.620\nyou can see a variety of data sources we\ntalked about, some of them databases,\n\n148\n00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.270\ndot net assembly, a web services or\na custom data source.\n\n149\n00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.000\nYou're really limited by\nyour imagination there as\n\n150\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.950\nto what you could tap into\nthat lives externally.\n\n151\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.570\nOn the, near the bottom,\n\n152\n00:08:54.570 --> 00:09:00.190\nor the middle right there we have\nthe secure store service application.\n\n153\n00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.360\nAnd again this store's credentials\nrequired to access external systems.\n\n154\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.190\nAnd so what happens is we map\ncredentials to share point users\n\n155\n00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.790\nin a secure store target applications.\n\n156\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:18.040\nAnd we can map these credentials to share\npoint users and or share point groups.\n\n157\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.650\nSo that's something you want to think\nthrough what it would make sense to allow\n\n158\n00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.550\nconnectivity to members of a SharePoint\ngroup, as opposed to, individual user.\n\n159\n00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.670\nAnd the Windows principals apply if it\nmakes sense to apply permission setting at\n\n160\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.900\na group level, do so.\n\n161\n00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.670\nIf it doesn't, it may or\nmay not be worth creating a new SharePoint\n\n162\n00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.080\ngroup just to hold people that need\naccess to a certain external data source.\n\n163\n00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.680\nThat's a design decision that you would\nhave made back in your governance and\n\n164\n00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.350\nplanning sessions.\n\n165\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.190\nAnd then there's a connector\nframework as well, and\n\n166\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.450\nthis lets the BDC runtime communicate\nwith other external systems,\n\n167\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.950\nwhich you see on the right\nhand side of your screen.\n\n168\n00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.660\nOkay, so\nwhat is the request process in general?\n\n169\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.470\nWe've got an external list or a client, or\nmaybe a web part, on the lower left there.\n\n170\n00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.320\nEven a browser requesting some\nkind of operation creates,\n\n171\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.640\nupdate, delete for example query on\none of the external data sources\n\n172\n00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.980\nthe crud q acronym applies here, and\nthen the web front end server routes\n\n173\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:26.790\nthe request to the BDC run time which you\ncan see there in the middle in the front\n\n174\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.500\nend web server box in the top middle\nof the screen, and then the appropriate\n\n175\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.400\nBDC metadata is retrieved to fulfill\na request for the BDC metadata store.\n\n176\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.900\nWhat kind of information is in here?\n\n177\n00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.760\nWell connection information,\nauthentication information,\n\n178\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.760\nany method definitions that required\nafter-support data operations.\n\n179\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.200\nAnd then if store secured\ncredentials are required, and then,\n\n180\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.930\nthe Secure Store Services is\ncontacted by the BDC runtime, and\n\n181\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.560\nthen it gets the correct mapping\nto the current SharePoint user or\n\n182\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.680\nthe group that the user's a member of,\nto the target application.\n\n183\n00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.989\nWhich would be an external data source,\none of them on the right.\n\n184\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.080\nOkay and\n\n185\n00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.110\nthen the results are then returned to\nthe client that submitted the request.\n\n186\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.130\nAll right, so that's that, diagram there.\n\n187\n00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.082\nWe can go back to me.\n\n188\n00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:25.460\nAll right so, we have a variety of\n\n189\n00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.360\nmodels we can use but they all involve\nconnecting to an external system.\n\n190\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.290\nAgain, like a database or even specific\ntables in a sequel database for example.\n\n191\n00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.280\nAnd then we have a system instance.\n\n192\n00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.480\nSo we could have more than one\ninstance related to a specific system.\n\n193\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.420\nAnd then we'd have, specify things like\nendpoints, connections strings, details\n\n194\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.400\nabout how to authenticate to an external\nsystem instance and then entities.\n\n195\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.260\nSo this could be, again,\na table or some list, and\n\n196\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.578\nthese are represented as ECTs or\nExternal Content Types.\n\n197\n00:11:58.578 --> 00:11:59.956\nOkay.\n\n198\n00:11:59.956 --> 00:12:06.520\nAnd then based on the External Content\nTypes, we can define what can be done.\n\n199\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.480\nSo maybe we just want queries to be\nallowed on the external list, for\n\n200\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.380\nexample, but no changes to be made.\n\n201\n00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.340\nThat again is something we have to decide.\n\n202\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.040\nWe can enable it in the software,\n\n203\n00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.990\nwhich I'll show you how to\ndo in an upcoming demo.\n\n204\n00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.950\nOkay.\nSo provisioning this service app.\n\n205\n00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.370\nI will show you the steps.\n\n206\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:32.740\nAnd we have various permissions related\nto business data collectivity relating to\n\n207\n00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:38.190\nthe BDC metadata store, external systems,\nexternal content types.\n\n208\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.390\nWe can have edit permission and\nthis let's the user\n\n209\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.770\nmodify elements to the external content\ntype, maybe add new items as well.\n\n210\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.560\nExecute as well.\n\n211\n00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.960\nSo, we could run some executable for\n\n212\n00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.420\nexample or\nuse components relying on external data.\n\n213\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.230\nAnd whether or not the external content\ntype should be selectable in clients.\n\n214\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.590\nIn other words, where the users can click\non and select a field or a folder or\n\n215\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.640\nindividual list item.\n\n216\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.780\nAnd then Permissions.\n\n217\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.620\nIs the user allowed to modify and\n\n218\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.170\nset permissions on the external\ncontent site or not?\n\n219\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:22.530\nSo these are some of the decisions we\nmake normally in any document library, or\n\n220\n00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.000\naccess to any shared resources.\n\n221\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.860\nYou know, printers, files, who should have\npermissions, what should they be able to\n\n222\n00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.200\ndo, should they be allowed to\nmodify existing permissions?\n\n223\n00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.760\nSo these concepts should\nat least be familiar.\n\n224\n00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.550\nEven if you haven't worked with BCS,\nI'm sure you've applied permissions and\n\n225\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:42.920\ndealt with issues relating to too much or\ntoo little access to a certain resource.\n\n226\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.150\nSo same kind of idea here.\n\n227\n00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.460\nOkay.\nAnd\n\n228\n00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:50.190\nthen the next thing we're going to do is\nto configure the secure store service.\n\n229\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.895\nAnd again,\nwe're storing credentials, mapping.\n\n230\n00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:57.690\nSharePoint uses and groups to allow for\naccess to external data sources.\n\n231\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:03.460\nAnd now I'm going to switch to Demo Mode.\n\n232\n00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.869\nI'm on my DC and I'm going to go into\nActive Directory Administration Center.\n\n233\n00:14:25.952 --> 00:14:27.384\nWait for it to open up.\n\n234\n00:14:27.384 --> 00:14:29.210\n[LAUGH] Indeed.\n\n235\n00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.750\nAll right, now some of you may\nbe still using active directory.\n\n236\n00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.200\nUsing the computers that's fine.\n\n237\n00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.840\nThe certain things you\ncan only do in A-DAC, so\n\n238\n00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.160\nI encourage you to familiarize\nyourself with the interface.\n\n239\n00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:45.050\nIt is a bit of a hustle to get use to but\nthere are benefits and for certain things\n\n240\n00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.240\nthat you see their dynamic access control,\nyou'll have to use this interface.\n\n241\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.827\nSo, that's a little shout out for\nA-DAC instead of A-DUC.\n\n242\n00:14:52.827 --> 00:14:56.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, and now I want new user.\n\n243\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.650\nLet's expand this here.\n\n244\n00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.600\nSo this wizard will look a little\ndifferent compared to AD users and\n\n245\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.790\ncomputers.\n\n246\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:11.680\nCall this one, SharePoint BDC.\n\n247\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.670\nLet's just make it, let's tighten up here.\n\n248\n00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.624\nSP BDC and you can log on SP BDC.\n\n249\n00:15:33.368 --> 00:15:34.358\nThe password.\n\n250\n00:15:40.223 --> 00:15:44.019\n>> So we're creating a user that we're\ngonna use in this demonstration.\n\n251\n00:15:44.019 --> 00:15:48.614\n>> Exactly, yeah so it's a service account\nto run the BDC service application, so\n\n252\n00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:52.331\nit's good to have dedicated\nservice accounts for service apps,\n\n253\n00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:56.523\nyou don't have to but the reasons\nrecommended is for security cuz you're\n\n254\n00:15:56.523 --> 00:16:00.986\nisolating service accounts per service\napp, also for troubleshooting if you\n\n255\n00:16:00.986 --> 00:16:04.907\ngo to an event viewer and you have\nthe same account associate would say\n\n256\n00:16:04.907 --> 00:16:09.571\nten service applications it's just clutter\nup your results And make it harder for\n\n257\n00:16:09.571 --> 00:16:12.854\nyou to isolate issues with\na given service application.\n\n258\n00:16:12.854 --> 00:16:15.985\nSo there, you know, there is no limit to\nthe ones that you can create, you do it\n\n259\n00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:19.370\nonce then it's available for the service\napp, so it's definitely best practice.\n\n260\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:21.800\nLet's see here.\n\n261\n00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.810\nOther past options, go, users expires,\nuser cannot change password and okay.\n\n262\n00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:34.020\nAnd now, I'm going to register\nthe service account as a managed account.\n\n263\n00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.317\nSo I'm going to go over\nto my SharePoint box.\n\n264\n00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.480\nThat was much faster than I expected.\n\n265\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.140\nHallelujah.\nActually I want my shell.\n\n266\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.780\nI'm in the wrong,\nlet's get this management shell up here.\n\n267\n00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.790\nBut we'll need that lab and\nsite later anyway.\n\n268\n00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.020\nSo, that's okay.\n\n269\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.800\nLet's wait for\nthe PowerShell prompt to appear here.\n\n270\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.560\nI'm gonna change that font.\n\n271\n00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.315\n>> That's good,\nI was having trouble reading that one.\n\n272\n00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:20.700\n>> [LAUGH] You're here to help.\n\n273\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.570\nWow, that's almost accessibility size,\nbut it can't be too big.\n\n274\n00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:28.500\nEspecially when you need to troubleshoot\nsome glitch in a PowerShell.\n\n275\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.380\nCommandlet or parameter.\n\n276\n00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.100\nSo I want to create a new\nSP managed account.\n\n277\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.640\nThis is kind of a hybrid, if you like,\nbetween using the shell and a GUI.\n\n278\n00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.070\nSo I hit tab complete.\n\n279\n00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.000\nAnd you see a credential box opens up.\n\n280\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.115\nAnd I'm gonna specify the account\nthat I've just created, which is\n\n281\n00:17:46.115 --> 00:17:51.150\nrailtown/ BDC.\n\n282\n00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:57.620\nAnd give it the right password.\n\n283\n00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:03.890\nAnd we know it's successful because almost\ninstantly we get a result back with user\n\n284\n00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.380\nname, password expiration,\nthis information about the user name, so\n\n285\n00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.220\nthat's now a managed account.\n\n286\n00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.820\nAs a refresher, a managed account means\nWindows takes care of refreshing,\n\n287\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.020\nor renewing if you like, the passwords,\n\n288\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.230\nchanging them on a schedule that\ncan be based on a domain policy.\n\n289\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:24.480\nThat way you get the security benefit\nof rotating passwords every, say,\n\n290\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.890\nsix weeks or so, whatever you specified.\n\n291\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.920\nWithout the hassle of manually\nchanging that password.\n\n292\n00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:39.670\nSo again, recommendation, one manager\naccount per service application.\n\n293\n00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.130\nSo you might end up with 10 or\n20 accounts for\n\n294\n00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.980\nvarious service apps without the hassle\nof having to manually change them.\n\n295\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:45.800\nIf you think about it,\n\n296\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.220\nyou want to eliminate any kind\nof manual process like that.\n\n297\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.570\nWe've got enough to worry about.\n\n298\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.960\nFires come up, putting out fires,\nplanning for next year, without having to\n\n299\n00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.680\nworry about this minutiae, which should\nbe handled automatically, and it is.\n\n300\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.720\nOkay, so, that's good.\n\n301\n00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.540\nNow I wanna start the business\ndata connectivity service, and\n\n302\n00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.550\nto do that we'll go into Central Admin.,\nwhich is over here.\n\n303\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:14.700\nAnd we'll go into System Settings, and\nI want to manage services on server.\n\n304\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:23.480\nIf you're low on coffee, you could easier\nconfuse and get the wrong item here.\n\n305\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.190\nSo make sure you're\nactually thinking through.\n\n306\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.790\nOkay, is it in the servers.\n\n307\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.960\nServicing the farms.\n\n308\n00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.640\nServices on the servers.\n\n309\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.100\nIt's almost like a Dr. Seuss thing.\n\n310\n00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.710\nAll right.\n\n311\n00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.920\nThat's the one I want.\n\n312\n00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.410\nIf not, you can just hit the back\nbutton and select the correct ones.\n\n313\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.910\nNo consequence for hitting the wrong one.\n\n314\n00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:39.540\nAll right.\n\n315\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.650\nI'm just going to restart my\nbusiness data connectivity service.\n\n316\n00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.580\nSomething you like to do.\n\n317\n00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.110\nAnd that's good.\n\n318\n00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:51.070\nNow I'm going to create a new service\napplication instance for my BDC service,\n\n319\n00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:56.810\nand I'll go into application management\nfor that and manage service applications.\n\n320\n00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.390\nAnd then, with the new button here.\n\n321\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.570\nThose various options,\nbut we'll keep it focused.\n\n322\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.200\nWe want the business data\nconnectivity service.\n\n323\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.620\nThe good thing about learning creating\nservice apps is once you've created one or\n\n324\n00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.480\ntwo, you'll know how to\ncreate all the others.\n\n325\n00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.910\nI'm not saying they're all identical, but\nthere's going to be nothing that will\n\n326\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.370\nthrow you in the wizard that you're\nprompted for certain entries,\n\n327\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.680\ndepending on the service\napp you're creating.\n\n328\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.190\nAll right.\nService app name,\n\n329\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.617\nwe're going to call this rail\n\n330\n00:20:32.617 --> 00:20:39.310\ntown bdc and database name here.\n\n331\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.720\nThis is a guid, which we don't need\nbecause it's not like we'll be creating\n\n332\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.330\nthousands of databases this week.\n\n333\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:50.054\nSo I'm going to eliminate the unnecessary\ncomplexity represented by the guid.\n\n334\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.569\nNow, I'm using a Macintosh\npiece of hardware,\n\n335\n00:20:57.569 --> 00:20:59.050\nI don't know if there is a delete.\n\n336\n00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.355\nI mean a delete as in backspace.\n\n337\n00:21:00.355 --> 00:21:01.670\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n338\n00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.420\n>> Anyway.\n\n339\n00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.820\n>> A little different.\n\n340\n00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.570\n>> Yeah, never hurts, I guess.\n\n341\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:14.840\nSo I'm gonna call this\nRailTown BDC service database,\n\n342\n00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.720\nalways good, I always harp on this,\nI don't care if I repeat it,\n\n343\n00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.520\nit's worth repeating, keep these\nconsistent with your naming conventions,\n\n344\n00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.560\nwhether it's groups,\nin this case it's the database name,\n\n345\n00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.000\nI mean I'm using a domain name\nin front of The BDC service db.\n\n346\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.700\nWell thankfully Microsoft\nhas pre populated that,\n\n347\n00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.120\nso, you wanna make it really obvious\nwhat the name of something represents,\n\n348\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:44.260\nwhether it's a list, a group, a, you know,\na path or in this case a database name.\n\n349\n00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.260\nAll right.\n\n350\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.810\nSo that anyone meeting it down the road or\nanybody trouble shooting can look at this\n\n351\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:54.200\nand know exactly, maybe they go into\nSQL now and look at the database and\n\n352\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.980\nsee what issue might have occurred.\n\n353\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.860\nIs it just mounted?\n\n354\n00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.800\nIs there some corruption in that database?\n\n355\n00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.665\nAs opposed to trying to wade\nthrough some cute Star Trek names.\n\n356\n00:22:01.665 --> 00:22:05.845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Teletubbies names or something.\n\n357\n00:22:05.845 --> 00:22:07.645\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can't believe I said that on the air.\n\n358\n00:22:07.645 --> 00:22:09.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n359\n00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.315\nAnd now application pool.\n\n360\n00:22:11.315 --> 00:22:13.610\nRemember when we're\ncreating a service app,\n\n361\n00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.720\nwe can always choose to create\na new application pool,\n\n362\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:22.320\nwhich is like carving out, say,\n250 megs or RAM for the application pool.\n\n363\n00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.800\nYou do get the security\nbenefit of isolation.\n\n364\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.560\nBut nobody has unlimited\nhardware resources.\n\n365\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.460\nMaybe you do, or it seems like unlimited.\n\n366\n00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.200\nIn certain context,\ncuz you can always buy more.\n\n367\n00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.240\nBut, so there's a tradeoff between the\nsecurity isolation having the service app\n\n368\n00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.710\nin its own app pool, isolated\nprocesses versus running out of RAM,\n\n369\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:42.810\nbecause you've had too many app pool.\n\n370\n00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.680\nSo in other words, I could choose the\nrating button to use an existing app pool,\n\n371\n00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.700\nbut I'm not going to because hey, why not.\n\n372\n00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.450\nLet's create a new app pool.\n\n373\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.680\nThis'll be RailTown,\n\n374\n00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.190\nthe SharePoint RailTown BDC.\n\n375\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.180\nAnd then, here's the security count.\n\n376\n00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.440\nThis is the manage account it\njust created a few minutes ago.\n\n377\n00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.281\nIt's the RailTown SP BDC.\n\n378\n00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:13.940\nNow, you see register new manage account.\n\n379\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.290\nYou may think great a link but,\nif you open that often,\n\n380\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.000\nyou'll loose the entire form contents.\n\n381\n00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.730\nSo, it's kind of annoying,\nbut it's another place to.\n\n382\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:26.180\nThe reason they put it here is you might\nrealize, I forgot to create the manage\n\n383\n00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.070\naccount that I wanted to use to\nassociate with service application and\n\n384\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.020\napplication pool.\n\n385\n00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.080\nSo it's a reminder and a chance to create\none that you're gonna lose whatever you\n\n386\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.860\nentered in the form already.\n\n387\n00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.570\nSo but I already created, so okay.\n\n388\n00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.600\nSo now we've created the new\nBDC service application,\n\n389\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.820\nnice to get the actual\nconfirmation dialog.\n\n390\n00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.830\nSome dialogs you'll notice\nin SharePoint 2016,\n\n391\n00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.640\nparticularly the managed metadata service,\nit can leave you hanging.\n\n392\n00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.253\nYou're wondering wondering is it working,\nis it not.\n\n393\n00:23:55.253 --> 00:24:00.057\nMost of them, the service apps including\nthis one, do give you the feedback you\n\n394\n00:24:00.057 --> 00:24:03.588\nwant that it's working and\nit was created successfully.\n\n395\n00:24:03.588 --> 00:24:04.572\nOkay.\n>> That was good.\n\n396\n00:24:04.572 --> 00:24:06.259\n>> Yes, nice to get that feedback.\n\n397\n00:24:06.259 --> 00:24:09.454\nOr if something didn't work,\nyou wanna know as soon as possible,\n\n398\n00:24:09.454 --> 00:24:11.289\nthen you can take corrective action.\n\n399\n00:24:11.289 --> 00:24:18.810\nOkay, now I'm gonna select my service\napplication I just created, Real Town BDC.\n\n400\n00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:21.556\nRemember when it comes to\nworking with service apps,\n\n401\n00:24:21.556 --> 00:24:25.320\nyou don't want to click on\nthe service app necessarily,\n\n402\n00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.058\ndepending on what you're doing you,\ncan select the line.\n\n403\n00:24:28.058 --> 00:24:30.010\nWell, the line will appear.\n\n404\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.130\nIf you click it, the line will appear.\n\n405\n00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.070\nNext to the appropriate service app.\n\n406\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:40.561\nAnd it's the application\nReal Town BDC in this case.\n\n407\n00:24:40.561 --> 00:24:43.044\nAnd, oops, okay.\n\n408\n00:24:43.044 --> 00:24:46.503\nAnd I'm going to click on Manage now.\n\n409\n00:24:46.503 --> 00:24:51.523\nNotice if you hover over\nthese icons in the ribbon,\n\n410\n00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:54.450\nyou get tool tip quite often.\n\n411\n00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.470\nF2 for more help.\n\n412\n00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.190\nThat's unusual.\n\n413\n00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.212\nWhatever happened to F1?\n\n414\n00:24:58.212 --> 00:25:00.750\n>> I guess F2 is the new F1.\n\n415\n00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:05.660\n>> I'll click manage, And\nother thing I was thinking\n\n416\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.420\nabout the other day is this little circle\nthat's going around in the tab here.\n\n417\n00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.960\nIt would be cool if you\ncould change the color.\n\n418\n00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.890\nJust to make it really obvious that\nsomething is happening because often I'm\n\n419\n00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.880\nthinking did that work?\n\n420\n00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.120\nAnd then I have to look up\nat this tiny little circle.\n\n421\n00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.930\nAnyway these are what we\ncall first world problems.\n\n422\n00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.402\n[LAUGH] I want the circle to be bigger.\n\n423\n00:25:26.402 --> 00:25:31.190\nAll right, now I want to set\nmetadata store permissions.\n\n424\n00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.359\nAnd I'm gonna specify my admin account.\n\n425\n00:25:38.461 --> 00:25:40.631\nNow, I could type\nthe whole thing correctly,\n\n426\n00:25:40.631 --> 00:25:42.534\nand hit Enter, and a line would appear.\n\n427\n00:25:42.534 --> 00:25:45.628\nI get lazy sometimes, or efficient,\n\n428\n00:25:45.628 --> 00:25:50.567\nI type part of it, hit Enter and\nthen you get a squiggly line.\n\n429\n00:25:50.567 --> 00:25:53.539\nWhich you see in other versions\nof SharePoint and that\n\n430\n00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:57.910\nI can just click on what I've typed and\nthen choose the actual name that I want.\n\n431\n00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.970\nNotice how it's underlined, so\nI know it's a legitimate account.\n\n432\n00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.100\nAnd now I need to click add.\n\n433\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.439\nNow there's various permissions we\ntalked about earlier in the episode.\n\n434\n00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.720\nSo I'm granting metadata stores\npermissions to my account,\n\n435\n00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.190\nadministrator account.\n\n436\n00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:16.270\nI'm gonna include all of them.\n\n437\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:21.090\nSo edit, execute, selectable clients,\nand the ability to set permissions.\n\n438\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.120\nAnd then, the last check box here.\n\n439\n00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.090\nI'm gonna select that and that's gonna\nallow me to propagate permissions to\n\n440\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.490\nthe BDC models, external systems and\nexternal content types.\n\n441\n00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.390\nWe talked about all those earlier.\n\n442\n00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:38.620\nAnd then a warning that whatever\npermissions I'm setting now,\n\n443\n00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.860\nall four of them in this case,\n\n444\n00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.740\nwill overwrite whatever permissions\nmay have already have been set.\n\n445\n00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.330\nIn this case, it doesn't matter because\nit's the first time I'm establishing\n\n446\n00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.533\nany permissions.\n\n447\n00:26:46.533 --> 00:26:50.560\nBut we always wanna make sure, okay, when\nwe're adding or modifying permissions,\n\n448\n00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.950\nare we going to erase the permissions\nthat currently exist or\n\n449\n00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.520\nare we adding on extra permissions?\n\n450\n00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.246\nYou need clarity of thought [LAUGH].\n\n451\n00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:02.900\nIf you're fuzzy, go away, come back and\nthink through the ramifications.\n\n452\n00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.920\nSometimes we get lazy and\njust hit okay, okay, okay,\n\n453\n00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.670\njust to get the wizard over with, and then\nrealize actually, I didn't wanna do that.\n\n454\n00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.160\nAnd then you have to uninstall something.\n\n455\n00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.220\nIt's, so clarity of thought.\n\n456\n00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.140\nSo hit okay.\n\n457\n00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.270\nSo that dialog box completed.\n\n458\n00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.230\n>> Great look at setting up that\nbusiness connectivity service.\n\n459\n00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.330\nCreating that service account,\ngetting everything set up that we need.\n\n460\n00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.320\nWe still have a little more to do,\n\n461\n00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.940\nI know, cuz we haven't worked with\nour secure store service yet.\n\n462\n00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.390\nBut unfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode so\n\n463\n00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.260\nwe're gonna have to make\na part two out of it.\n\n464\n00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.680\nSo make sure you come back and\njoin us for that one.\n\n465\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.760\nFor now, that's gonna do it,\nagain, we appreciate the look.\n\n466\n00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.300\nWe talked about business\nconnectivity services,\n\n467\n00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.500\nand where we might find that useful in our\nenterprise connecting to those external\n\n468\n00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.990\ndata sources, if I can say that correctly.\n\n469\n00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:49.100\nBeing able to index those\nexternal sources and setting up,\n\n470\n00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.140\nas Mark has said several times,\n\n471\n00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.770\nthe ability to search from one location\nall of these different data sources.\n\n472\n00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.950\nJust makes it more convenient for\nyour users, for everybody.\n\n473\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.220\nAnd you're gonna get that buy in.\n\n474\n00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.750\nPeople will just start using Share Point\nmore and it just snowballs from there.\n\n475\n00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.590\nPeople start loving Share Point.\n\n476\n00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.960\nWhich they should right?\n\n477\n00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.860\nEspecially after watching\nthese videos here.\n\n478\n00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.430\nAll right Mark.\n\n479\n00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.780\nWell, we appreciate that demonstration.\n\n480\n00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.890\nLook forward to the next one.\n\n481\n00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.100\nBut for now, signing off,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n482\n00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.650\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n483\n00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.859\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n484\n00:28:18.859 --> 00:28:26.600\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:19.220\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing an advance SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.840\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.690\nwe're gonna be continuing on with\nour business connectivity services.\n\n6\n00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.630\nThis is a part two.\n\n7\n00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.200\nRemember that previous episode,\nwe got everything kind of set up.\n\n8\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.700\nWe created that business\nconnectivity service,\n\n9\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.230\nwe created an account to run that under,\nwe created the application.\n\n10\n00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.140\nNow we're going to be working\nwith the secure store service,\n\n11\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.320\nwhere we store the credentials used\nby the business connectivity service.\n\n12\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.620\nAnd here to show us the way,\nis Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n13\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.600\nHow are you doing, Mark?\n\n14\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.820\n>> And Mike, thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.410\nAll right, now,\nwe done some preliminaries.\n\n16\n00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.570\nNow we wanna create a service account\nto run the secure store service, so\n\n17\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.280\nI'll do that for my DC.\n\n18\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.660\nI'm in my actual directory\nadminister of center still and\n\n19\n00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.740\nI'm gonna click in new user.\n\n20\n00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.975\nAnd this will be SPSSS,\nsounds like senior secondary school.\n\n21\n00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:11.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, that's not it.\n\n22\n00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.580\nIt's secure store service,\nI am all for acronyms.\n\n23\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.845\nMake sure I got that right,\nand the password!\n\n24\n00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.560\nThat's good, and\nthen we'll make it password never expires.\n\n25\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.985\nUser cannot change password.\n\n26\n00:01:33.985 --> 00:01:40.320\nAnd that's good and we're gonna\nregister another managed account,\n\n27\n00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.408\nso for\nthat we'll go back to SharePoint box,\n\n28\n00:01:46.748 --> 00:01:53.330\nAnd back into the shell, so the up arrow\ncuz we're doing the exact same thing.\n\n29\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.800\nSo this time would be SPSSS.\n\n30\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.938\nActually no, we want domain name first.\n\n31\n00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:05.864\nRealtown/password and\n\n32\n00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:11.050\nright away we can see the creation\nof the kennel was successful, so\n\n33\n00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.180\nthat's all we need there.\n\n34\n00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.520\nNow I'll go back into central admin\non this same machine here, and\n\n35\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.740\nthis time we want to go to system\nsettings and managed services on service.\n\n36\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.580\nIt's helpful.\n\n37\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.350\nThe hyperlinks of options you've used\nrecently appear in a different color,\n\n38\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.800\njust like other hyperlinks would so\n\n39\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.080\nthat helps you if you frequently use\ncertain options in central admin.\n\n40\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.830\nSaves you a bit of time there and\n\n41\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.820\nI'm gonna scroll down to\nsecure a story service.\n\n42\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.680\nI like to restart it so will do that.\n\n43\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.200\n>> And you change the account that\nservice was running under, so\n\n44\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.970\nyou wanna restart it so it knows,\nhey I got a new account to use.\n\n45\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.360\n>> Indeed and now we're going\nto application managements and\n\n46\n00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.760\nmanage service applications and\n\n47\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.130\nwe want new secure or store service.\n\n48\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.672\nI'm tricking myself up with it now.\n\n49\n00:03:04.672 --> 00:03:05.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n50\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.950\nwe'll give it an intelligent name.\n\n51\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.930\nLet's call it Railtown Secure Store and\n\n52\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.085\ndatabase name,\nI'll get rid of that GUID again.\n\n53\n00:03:26.478 --> 00:03:28.452\nAnd put Railtown in front of it.\n\n54\n00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:43.366\nAll right, and\ncreate new application pool,\n\n55\n00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:47.518\nso scroll down for that and\n\n56\n00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:54.710\nthis will be SharePoint's, real town SSS.\n\n57\n00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.110\nAnd we'll use the manage\naccount just created.\n\n58\n00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.730\nSlash SPSSS and there's an option there\nfor the audit log, 30 days until purged.\n\n59\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.060\nNow, you maybe an organization where\nyou're not allowed to purge audit logs.\n\n60\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.110\nYou may have to keep them indefinitely,\ncertain military applications, or for\n\n61\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.270\nan extended period, so In that case,\nyou deselect that option.\n\n62\n00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.230\nSorry, you wouldn't deselect.\n\n63\n00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.210\nYou'd change the days until purge\nto something much higher than 30.\n\n64\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.900\nI'll leave it at default, hit OK.\n\n65\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.040\nThat worked and I'll hit OK.\n\n66\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.573\nThat secure store was successfully\ncreated, was there any doubt?\n\n67\n00:04:31.573 --> 00:04:33.469\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n68\n00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:38.032\n>> No.\n>> [LAUGH] So select Railtown Secure Store\n\n69\n00:04:38.032 --> 00:04:42.781\nand up on the ribbon I'll click on manage.\n\n70\n00:04:47.923 --> 00:04:50.315\nAnd now I need to generate a new key.\n\n71\n00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:54.885\nAnd in case,\nthere's any doubt about that, there's\n\n72\n00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:58.667\na pink background box here, and notice\nthe other options aren't even available.\n\n73\n00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:01.187\nSo it makes it pretty obvious\nwhat the next step is.\n\n74\n00:05:02.207 --> 00:05:06.997\nNow sometimes, we use pass phrases\nin Windows administration.\n\n75\n00:05:06.997 --> 00:05:11.837\nThis is one of those examples which is\npresumably more secure than a password,\n\n76\n00:05:11.837 --> 00:05:13.217\nbecause you can includes spaces in there.\n\n77\n00:05:13.217 --> 00:05:17.647\nIt's much tougher to crack\na sentence than a word.\n\n78\n00:05:17.647 --> 00:05:19.350\nAll right, so I'll enter that info.\n\n79\n00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:29.469\nAnd a warning here in the dialog box,\n\n80\n00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:33.600\nthe pass phrase will not be stored and\nit is case sensitive.\n\n81\n00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.230\nSo if you wanna add a new\nsecure store service server or\n\n82\n00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.080\nif you need to do a restore from\na back up, you'll need this password.\n\n83\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.490\nSo sometimes writing things down\nis not an insecure practice or\n\n84\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.710\nmaybe you save it on a USB key and\nyou stick that in a safe.\n\n85\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.859\nBut the point is you need\nto know this passphrase.\n\n86\n00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:54.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you don't and\n\n87\n00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.610\nyou're trying to restore,\n\n88\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.690\nyou're gonna have to recreate everything\nto do with your Secure Store service.\n\n89\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.499\nSo write it down, please.\n\n90\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.380\nUnless it's your dog name, okay.\n\n91\n00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.170\nThat worked and now,\nthat warning has gone away and\n\n92\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.884\nit gives guidance for\nthe next step there as well.\n\n93\n00:06:12.884 --> 00:06:16.216\nRight now at this point, we've created and\n\n94\n00:06:16.216 --> 00:06:20.731\nconfigured a secure store\nservice application instance.\n\n95\n00:06:20.731 --> 00:06:24.204\nNow we want to create a target\napplication, so in other words,\n\n96\n00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:26.710\nwhat are we connecting to.\n\n97\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.660\nThat's the purpose of this next phase here\nso go back into application management\n\n98\n00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.970\nhere's applications and\nwe're back to Railtown Secure Store.\n\n99\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.760\nAnd manage, and now I'm gonna select new.\n\n100\n00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.730\nAnd I'm gonna call this\n\n101\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:57.250\nTarget Application ID Railtown,\nI'll say data warehouse.\n\n102\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.490\nTA for Target Application and\nlet's give it a display name.\n\n103\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.660\nThat never hurts either, so\nI'll say Realtown data warehouse.\n\n104\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.976\nDatabase target application and\n\n105\n00:07:15.976 --> 00:07:24.550\nagain display name helpful\noften there's a tool tip.\n\n106\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.630\nJust extra confirmation that\nyou're on the right path.\n\n107\n00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.125\nContact email sure I'll say administrator\n\n108\n00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:38.090\n@realtown.com, and\n\n109\n00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.520\nnow, the target application type.\n\n110\n00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.840\nRemember we can use individuals or\ngroups, we can even specify\n\n111\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.700\ntickets which have a 2 hour expiry, so\nit can be leveraged by other users.\n\n112\n00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:53.434\nI'll just keep it simple and\nI'll click on a group and\n\n113\n00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:57.014\nthat's all I need there, next.\n\n114\n00:08:01.304 --> 00:08:04.670\nOkay, so these are the default options\nhere, Windows User Name and Password.\n\n115\n00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.430\nIf I click on Add Field\nit exposes different\n\n116\n00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.950\nfield types I can use to authenticate\nto the target application.\n\n117\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:16.242\nSo I might wanna use this,\nt he certificate for\n\n118\n00:08:16.242 --> 00:08:19.650\nexample or a PIN or even a key.\n\n119\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.560\nSo we have a variety of ways to\nauthenticate that target application.\n\n120\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.490\nFor now,\nI'll delete that additional field,\n\n121\n00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.680\nand stick with the default Windows\nusername and Windows password.\n\n122\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.510\nHit Next, and\nthen I'll specify my admin account\n\n123\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:46.528\nand that resolves successfully and\nI will add me as a member as well.\n\n124\n00:08:46.528 --> 00:08:50.103\n[SOUND] Administrator accounts\n\n125\n00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:57.110\nAll right, and then okay.\n\n126\n00:09:00.335 --> 00:09:06.103\nNow, I'm gonna set the credentials for\nthe target application,\n\n127\n00:09:06.103 --> 00:09:11.466\nso I will select my real town DWTA and\nthen in the credentials.\n\n128\n00:09:11.466 --> 00:09:15.410\nThis is a little confusing here because\nThere's a set button for credentials and\n\n129\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.920\na set button for permissions.\n\n130\n00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.150\nSo you know, if I was designing this\nI would just say set credentials or\n\n131\n00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.255\nset permissions on the button,\nbut I didn't code the product.\n\n132\n00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:24.003\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n133\n00:09:24.003 --> 00:09:27.060\nmake sure you're clicking on set\ncredentials that's the next step.\n\n134\n00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:39.535\nAnd let's say for\nuser name it will be Railtown/,\n\n135\n00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:45.060\nI'm gonna use administrator here again.\n\n136\n00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:53.341\nAnd plus for the password confirm.\n\n137\n00:10:00.198 --> 00:10:03.199\nSo, in the field, you probably have\na separate username here instead of just\n\n138\n00:10:03.199 --> 00:10:07.570\nadministrator again, but for convenience,\nI'm just showing you with administrator.\n\n139\n00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.070\nI hit OK.\n\n140\n00:10:10.217 --> 00:10:14.230\nNext stop and lastly we're going to\nimport and configure BDC models.\n\n141\n00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.940\nSo I'll go back into Application\nManagement > Manage service applications.\n\n142\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:29.220\nGo down to Railtown BDC > Manage and\nnow we want to import the model.\n\n143\n00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.030\nAnd this is where I would choose\nbrowse and I would link to,\n\n144\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.620\nor click on, a file with extension BDCM.\n\n145\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:43.090\nThis is something you can create in\nSharePoint Designer, takes about 13 steps.\n\n146\n00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.820\nThe idea is you're setting up credentials,\nthe mapping, to create the model.\n\n147\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.314\nYou end up with a very large XNL\nfile that scrolls several pages.\n\n148\n00:10:50.314 --> 00:10:54.201\nThat's beyond the scope of what we're\nshowing here, but the point is that you or\n\n149\n00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:56.791\nprobably someone else,\na Dev in your organization.\n\n150\n00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.669\nWould have already created that model\nat that point, you browse to it and\n\n151\n00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:03.270\njust select that file and import it.\n\n152\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.490\nAnd then you would associate\nthe external system,\n\n153\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.280\nthe BDC, with a target application.\n\n154\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.230\nAnd then from then on, you just with\ncorrect permissions can interact with that\n\n155\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.710\ntarget application, do things like\nchoose lists, modify permissions, or\n\n156\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.070\nwhatever permissions\nwe'd allow them to do.\n\n157\n00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.620\nSo that completes this demo.\n\n158\n00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.228\n>> So that model then might\ncreated by the actual data.\n\n159\n00:11:23.228 --> 00:11:28.330\nStore owner, or if you were connecting to\na database that somebody was managing.\n\n160\n00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.302\nThey might give us the model that we\ncould use to connect our SharePoint to\n\n161\n00:11:31.302 --> 00:11:32.100\ntheir database.\n\n162\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.260\n>> Exactly, and they'd probably\nwant to have a say in it, frankly.\n\n163\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.430\n>> Yes, because it affects what they do.\n\n164\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.740\nSo the model is, again it's many\npages of XML it turns out into,\n\n165\n00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:44.230\nyou can create it easily in SharePoint\njust designer have someone do it for you.\n\n166\n00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.820\n>> Very good.\nMark again,\n\n167\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.190\nanother great demonstration there,\n\n168\n00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:50.640\nlooking at secure store service\nwhere we can put the credentials\n\n169\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.440\nin that we're gonna be using to connect\nto those different external data sources.\n\n170\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.960\nSo we can start tying it all together,\nset up our search to work, and\n\n171\n00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.820\nsearch our enterprise no matter\nwhere that data is stored.\n\n172\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.010\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n173\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.406\nHope everybody out there enjoyed those\ndemonstrations and watching this episode.\n\n174\n00:12:04.406 --> 00:12:06.696\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mark Rodrick.\n\n175\n00:12:06.696 --> 00:12:07.712\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n176\n00:12:07.712 --> 00:12:08.939\n>> And

at ITVPro TV I'm your\nhost Mike Roderick and\n\n4\n00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.230\ntoday we're doing\nAdvanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.543\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:25.712\nwe're gonna be focusing in on\nEnterprise Content Management.\n\n7\n00:00:25.712 --> 00:00:31.070\nAnd here to help us with all that fun\nstuff is the one and only Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.040\nHow you doing Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.902\n>> Nice Mike.\nWhen you're this big they call you Mister.\n\n10\n00:00:33.902

Management.\n\n13\n00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.250\nSo, how do you keep control\nover your sites and content?\n\n14\n00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.850\nThat's the subject of ECM and\n\n15\n00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.970\nagain as I've said many times\nalready in this week's class and\n\n16\n00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.090\nthe first SharePoint week we did a lot of\nwhat we're doing is not that difficult.\n\n17\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.930\nClick here, select this.\n\n18\n00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.850\nIt's the planning, the governance,\n\n19\n00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.400\nthe deciding who gets to decide\nabout what information to retain.\n\n20\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.140\nWhere should it be stored?\n\n21\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.440\nWho gets access to it?\n\n22\n00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.290\nAll these are non technical decisions\nthat definitely effect the overall\n\n23\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.019\nutility of your SharePoint environment.\n\n24\n00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.580\nSo we'll look at document and\n\n25\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.560\nfile management capabilities,\ninformation management policies as well.\n\n26\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.300\nAnd so we were talking\nenterprise content management,\n\n27\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.720\nwe're really talking about a few areas\nincluding web content management,\n\n28\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.740\nwhich is so significant it gets\nits own episode, maybe two.\n\n29\n00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.330\nRecords management and\ndocument management,\n\n30\n00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.720\nall those fall under the umbrella\nof enterprise content management.\n\n31\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.470\nSo in terms of document management,\n\n32\n00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.590\nnow a lot of these are activities\nthat end users would do or\n\n33\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.830\nsometimes power users but not, generally\nusers of the SharePoint platform.\n\n34\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.600\nThis is not a farm administrative a task\nor even a administration task often.\n\n35\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.620\nSo with SharePoint we have\na delegated administration model.\n\n36\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.980\nDo not be the farm administer\nthat says yes to all requests for\n\n37\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.900\nbasic administration that really should\nbe handled at more of a department level.\n\n38\n00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.110\nFor one thing department managers or\ninformation managers say,\n\n39\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.520\nare gonna be more in tune with\ntheir needs and requirements for\n\n40\n00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.320\ninformation classification and\nsearch and categorization.\n\n41\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.170\nThen you would be as a farm administrator.\n\n42\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.490\nYou can't know everything\nin the enterprise,\n\n43\n00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.530\ninformation management wise, so you\ndefinitely wanna make sure site collection\n\n44\n00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.120\nadministrators are trained up to do and\nmanage their part of the SharePoint world.\n\n45\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.460\nMuch like in Windows administration, we'd\nhave delegated administration for OUs for\n\n46\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.150\nexample, similar idea there.\n\n47\n00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.420\nSo however but as SharePoint\nadmins we're also users as well.\n\n48\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.460\nSo what are some of the document\nmanagement functions, checking out and\n\n49\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.060\nchecking in.\n\n50\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.770\nThis let's you restrict\nediting to one user at a time.\n\n51\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.170\nUnless you have Office online server,\nit used to be the Office Web Apps Server.\n\n52\n00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.710\nIf you install that,\nwhich we will this week,\n\n53\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.890\nyou can get concurrent\nauthoring capabilities.\n\n54\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.540\nSo multiple people can work\non the exact same document.\n\n55\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.010\nYou can see who's working on what,\nwho's editing on what.\n\n56\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.037\nIt's kind of freaky, actually.\n\n57\n00:03:17.037 --> 00:03:18.927\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n58\n00:03:18.927 --> 00:03:20.846\n>> If you're used to working solo or\n\n59\n00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:24.412\nmaybe sending somebody changes or\nin the case of SharePoint,\n\n60\n00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:28.750\nchecking in a document you've checked\nout so someone else can make edits.\n\n61\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.838\nSo if you're not used to current editing,\nit can be something to get used to.\n\n62\n00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:38.530\nVersioning so, we look at something\nthat's new and versioning then later on\n\n63\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.410\nin this episode but the idea there is\nyou want to save users from themselves.\n\n64\n00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.550\nBy retaining x number of previous\nversions of a document and in the first\n\n65\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.170\nthe basic admin or SharePoint admin cuz we\nlooked at the difference between major and\n\n66\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.160\nminor versions.\n\n67\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.540\nContent approval, so\ndepending on the size or the number\n\n68\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.260\nof users viewing your content ultimately,\nthe more users you have viewing\n\n69\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.540\ncould be in the millions in the case of\npopular websites, or tens of millions.\n\n70\n00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.650\nThe more likely you are to have multiple\nlevels of approval in between one\n\n71\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.680\nsingle content creator and its ultimate\npublication out to the real world.\n\n72\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.360\nSo, content approval is part\nof document management.\n\n73\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.730\nAnd then document sets,\n\n74\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.000\nthis is a way that we can identify\ndocuments that belong together or\n\n75\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.760\nshould be managed together even if they\nmove around throughout the enterprise.\n\n76\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.280\nSo they might start off say in\na certain document library,\n\n77\n00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.130\nget processed, moved to other areas for\nfurther processing.\n\n78\n00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.680\nBut with document sets you have the\nability to apply retention policies for\n\n79\n00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.920\nexample, to all items in a particular\ndocument set, even though\n\n80\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.120\nyou don't know exactly where those items\nlive in your SharePoint environment.\n\n81\n00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.800\nIt could be potentially in hundreds\nof different document libraries but\n\n82\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.360\nyou can manage them as one.\n\n83\n00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.020\n>> That's convenient.\n\n84\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.280\n>> That's very convenient.\n\n85\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.215\nContent types, we looked at at length\nin the first week but as refresher\n\n86\n00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:05.480\ncuz they're so vital and impact so\nmany areas of our SharePoint deployment.\n\n87\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.180\nA content type is a unique grouping\nof meta data columns, and depending\n\n88\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.860\non what you're working with, you could\nhave different combination requirements.\n\n89\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.259\nSo for a patient ID, or patient records\nfor example, you might have patient name.\n\n90\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.760\nInsurance policy provider,\ninsurance policy number,\n\n91\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.060\nmaybe some kind of patient id.\n\n92\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.650\nSo those are specific columns that\nmetadata you can capture and you can\n\n93\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.110\nassociate them and create all those in\na patient content type, for example.\n\n94\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.910\nAnd depending on your business,\nyou can probably imagine\n\n95\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.800\ndifferent metadata columns that would\nmake sense for different aspects of\n\n96\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.890\nyour business depending on whether\nyou're a sales organization or\n\n97\n00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.500\nmarketing or research, for example.\n\n98\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.930\nGovernment organization, military, so\nlots of different applications of creating\n\n99\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.640\nmultiple content types, and again,\nwe can use content types in many areas.\n\n100\n00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.780\nFor search, as a search scope, for\napplying information rights management or\n\n101\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.810\nretention policies to all files\nof a certain content type.\n\n102\n00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.690\n>> Mm hm.\n>> A given document library can be\n\n103\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.770\nexclusively for one content type or\nmaybe the user has a choice of two or\n\n104\n00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.840\nthree content types when uploading or\n\n105\n00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.120\nsaving content to that document\nlibrary for the first time.\n\n106\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.840\nAdditionally in terms of\nmetadata it makes it easier to\n\n107\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.510\nfind documents if you've\ngot content types.\n\n108\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.790\nSo the more metadata we can capture\nespecially if we can do it automatically\n\n109\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.810\nwhere the user doesn't\nhave to select an option.\n\n110\n00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.540\nSo it might be a calculated column, or the\nmetadata to populate a documents a column\n\n111\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.660\nfor example might come from some other\nsource, the possibilities are limitless.\n\n112\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.246\nI can ramble on, entertain.\n\n113\n00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:43.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Edutain for a day on content types.\n\n114\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.660\nSo, that's all I'll say about that.\n\n115\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.980\nSo, you may wanna brush up on\ncontent types just to refresh your\n\n116\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.280\nparticular environment what you can\ndo with them in your organization.\n\n117\n00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.530\nOkay, so\nplanning information management policies.\n\n118\n00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.620\nWe've got several policies there including\n\n119\n00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.940\nconcepts like information\nrights management, retention.\n\n120\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.370\nSo how long should content be retained.\n\n121\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.750\nAnd we can sort of start\nthe timer if you like so\n\n122\n00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.340\nit could be five years after\nthe document was created.\n\n123\n00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.970\nOr after it was last accessed, or after,\n\n124\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.130\nif it's a contract,\nalthough that would probably be a record,\n\n125\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.450\nwhich we'll talk about later,\nbut let's say it was a contract.\n\n126\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.810\nIt was just a plain old document.\n\n127\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.175\nYou could say,\nwhatever the contract expiry date is,\n\n128\n00:07:33.175 --> 00:07:38.270\nfive years after that, take some kind of\naction, which could be archive, delete.\n\n129\n00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.770\nKick off a work flow, so the manager, at\nthat point, five years after the contract\n\n130\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.610\nexpiration, could then decide\nwhat to do with that content.\n\n131\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.690\nThat's important as well,\n\n132\n00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.120\nespecially if you're talking about\nmulti-year retention periods.\n\n133\n00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.281\nBecause frankly, the business rules might\nhave changed in the intervening years, or\n\n134\n00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:56.655\nthe law might have changed.\n\n135\n00:07:56.655 --> 00:07:59.757\nTypically, seven years for financial\ninformation required to retain data.\n\n136\n00:07:59.757 --> 00:08:02.922\nAlthough, different countries would\nhave different rules on that.\n\n137\n00:08:02.922 --> 00:08:08.860\nSo again, you might be in compliance and\nabout to delete some documents.\n\n138\n00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.510\nBut the law might have changed\nin the intervening years.\n\n139\n00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.780\nAnd then all of a sudden,\nyou might be out of compliance, and\n\n140\n00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.010\nsubject to regulatory censure,\nfines, that sort of thing.\n\n141\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.370\nSo it never hurts to decide later,\n\n142\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.060\nwhen it comes time to disposal or\narchiving of documents.\n\n143\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.200\nBut to do nothing, that's my main\npoint in this little section here.\n\n144\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.010\nDon't just have no policy, and let content\nbuild up in your SharePoint environment.\n\n145\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.240\nThat's a recipe for poor performance, and\n\n146\n00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.780\nan expensive, bloated,\nsearch infrastructure.\n\n147\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.758\nThat becomes less useful over time as more\nand more unnecessary information exists.\n\n148\n00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:47.600\nYou know, the spring cleaning,\nthe pruning and\n\n149\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.170\nautomating that procedure\nwill make your life easier.\n\n150\n00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.970\n>> Auditing as well, so again,\ndepending on the industry or\n\n151\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.636\nthe geography in which you work, you may\nhave different requirements for auditing.\n\n152\n00:08:58.636 --> 00:09:02.510\nSo, you can audit almost any\n\n153\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.850\nkind of event ensured of what\nyou can dream up can be audited.\n\n154\n00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:11.070\nBut just like for auditing, you don't\nwant to audit more than necessary.\n\n155\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.490\nDon't just check all the boxes, for\n\n156\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.470\nexample, and think, let's audit everything\njust in case my boss might want to\n\n157\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.980\nknow who signed out that fantasy\nfootball Excel spreadsheet in 1999.\n\n158\n00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:26.150\n>> Might end up with some very large\nlog files that really becomes difficult\n\n159\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.790\nto find the important, you start missing\nthe important stuff in those log files.\n\n160\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.670\n>> Indeed, indeed.\n\n161\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.790\nSo always, you know?\n\n162\n00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.780\nI'm not saying, be irresponsible\nwhat you prune, but, you know?\n\n163\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.480\nLess rather than more\nis often the way to go.\n\n164\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.390\nAnd being proactive when it\ncomes to disposal, and auditing,\n\n165\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.348\nin this case, you know?\n\n166\n00:09:43.348 --> 00:09:45.850\nAudit, the bare minimum of what you need,\nor\n\n167\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:51.306\nif there's some regulatory or business\nrule that requires auditing, fine.\n\n168\n00:09:51.306 --> 00:09:54.270\nAnd also, it comes,\nthen there's a decision to make on\n\n169\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.010\nhow long to retain audit logs.\n\n170\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.290\nIndefinitely?\n\n171\n00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.170\nYou know, first in, first out.\n\n172\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:04.150\nOnce the log file hits 500 megs or\n500 gigs or whatever limit you want.\n\n173\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.002\nDo you purge the old content?\n\n174\n00:10:06.002 --> 00:10:12.620\nNow, I met a fellow recently with\nhigh clearance in a military branch,\n\n175\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.820\nand where he worked they were not\nallowed to delete any audit logs.\n\n176\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.000\nSo, it was an indefinite retention period.\n\n177\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.200\nNow that's an outlier, most organizations\ndon't need to keep them that long,\n\n178\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.280\nbut you know, that's something to decide,\nagain, it's a governance issue.\n\n179\n00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.090\nYou may want to have a repository for\n\n180\n00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.020\nlarge documents, so\n>> In general, we\n\n181\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:37.030\npreach about 100 to 200 gigabytes as being\nthe maximum size for a content database.\n\n182\n00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.440\nBut sometimes you want a repository\n\n183\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.520\nto contain a lot of historical data or\nproduct documentation or\n\n184\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.340\nwhatever it is, it makes sense\nto store and manage together.\n\n185\n00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.070\nAnd there's no rule saying you can't\ngrow beyond 100 or 200 gigs for\n\n186\n00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.990\nCOND database, but you want to\nhave special considerations for\n\n187\n00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.470\nsuch a large repository.\n\n188\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.920\nAnd you can have up to 30 million\nitems in a library, for example,\n\n189\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.950\nup to 60 million items in a content data\nbase which sounds like a lot and is a lot.\n\n190\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.720\nBut again, depending on what your business\nis, if you're a 100 year old Law Firm,\n\n191\n00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.440\nI like to use that example,\nyou're going to have a lot of paper.\n\n192\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.730\nAnd if you decide to digitize it,\n\n193\n00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.321\nyou can get into the millions very\nquickly, think of Erin Brockovich [LAUGH].\n\n194\n00:11:20.321 --> 00:11:22.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is that product place?\n\n195\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.470\nI'm not sure, well, it was a real person\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n196\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.240\n>> What's her name there?\n\n197\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.045\nJulia Roberts, Okay.\n\n198\n00:11:29.045 --> 00:11:30.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Good movie.\n\n199\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.840\nSo my point is, in general you want to\nkeep your content databases nimble.\n\n200\n00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.530\nWhich means, keep in mind,\n\n201\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.980\na site collection can only exist\nin a single content database.\n\n202\n00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.550\nYou can move an entire site collection\nto a different content database, but\n\n203\n00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.450\nyou cannot move part of a site collection\nto a different content database.\n\n204\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.440\nDatabase.\nThat's not doable.\n\n205\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.250\nAnd also,\nwhat we talked about in week one.\n\n206\n00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.880\nThe initial SharePoint week,\nabout your content database size is\n\n207\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.820\nrelated to how fast you need\nto recover from disaster.\n\n208\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.570\nIf you have to restore a content database\nthat's 200 gigs, it's going to happen\n\n209\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:11.240\na lot faster than ten times that size, so\nkeep your databases nimble and workable.\n\n210\n00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.780\nIt's also good in terms of rotating your\nback up schedules and fitting in windows\n\n211\n00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.580\nso you can have maybe one content database\nskits backed up every night in full, and\n\n212\n00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.320\nyou have another incremental plan for\nthe other days of the week.\n\n213\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.470\nSo there's many compelling reasons for\nsmall content databases, sometimes you\n\n214\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:34.200\nwant a larger, okay,\nI think we beat that one to death.\n\n215\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, another factor\n\n216\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:42.975\nthat makes it okay for a very large\nrepository is the percentage of content.\n\n217\n00:12:42.975 --> 00:12:46.505\nAttendance Access that gives you a week or\na month, or the depositors.\n\n218\n00:12:46.505 --> 00:12:49.075\nIt is just there, it is rarely accessed.\n\n219\n00:12:49.075 --> 00:12:53.985\nIt's helpful on one place, but\nit is not like a project themed site for\n\n220\n00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:57.385\ncurrent project where there is lot\nof interaction, new documents,\n\n221\n00:12:57.385 --> 00:12:59.755\nmodified documents,\nmaybe multiple authors.\n\n222\n00:12:59.755 --> 00:13:01.986\nThis is more of a static, or\n\n223\n00:13:01.986 --> 00:13:08.014\narchival reference kind of document\ncenter we're talking about there.\n\n224\n00:13:08.014 --> 00:13:14.970\nOkay, site-based retention\nis another concept as well.\n\n225\n00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.568\nHow long should sites be kept?\n\n226\n00:13:16.568 --> 00:13:21.039\nNow, you can have the primary\nsite collection administrator and\n\n227\n00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:23.520\nsecondary if one is specified.\n\n228\n00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.410\nNotified, say, after six moths.\n\n229\n00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.420\nLet's say six moths after site created.\n\n230\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.860\nA little message, email,\ndo you want to keep this site?\n\n231\n00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.170\nDo you need to keep this site?\n\n232\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.440\nAnd often if it's a purpose built site,\nfor\n\n233\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.610\nparticular, it could be a document\nworkspace, for example.\n\n234\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.660\nSo collaborating on one document that's\ncreated, do you need the site anymore?\n\n235\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.080\nProbably not, because the document\nprobably lives somewhere else now, or\n\n236\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.860\nif it's a project to put on some kind\nof event, and that event has past and\n\n237\n00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.820\nmaybe you've retained some kind of work\ndocument of best practices for the event.\n\n238\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.140\nDo you still need that site or\nsite collection for the event?\n\n239\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:56.660\nNo.\n\n240\n00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.830\nSo again,\n\n241\n00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:02.550\nbeing proactive and by automatically\nemailing site collection administrator,\n\n242\n00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:07.060\nsay six months after site creation, you\ncan have a process there where nobody has\n\n243\n00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.080\nto, you want to get away from where people\nhave to remember things in their head.\n\n244\n00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.240\nSo information overload,\nmany of us suffer from it.\n\n245\n00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.540\nA prime way to suffer is to try and\nremember everything in your head.\n\n246\n00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.640\nThe more you cannot remember,\nbut have in existence or\n\n247\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.850\ncoming to you, in this case,\nsix month reminders, so\n\n248\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.180\nyou don't have to remember or\neven put it in your task management.\n\n249\n00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.640\nI have to decide about this cycle action,\nno, it comes to you in an email,\n\n250\n00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.380\nit's automatic ,and you can decide on\nthe spot, retain or delete that site.\n\n251\n00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.350\nAnd then if there's no response,\nwe can automatically close that site and\n\n252\n00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.780\nthen X number of days after it's closed,\nin other words,\n\n253\n00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.670\nit can't be edited, then we can as\nadmins choose to delete that site.\n\n254\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.550\n>> Kind of wait and see how many phone\ncalls you get about why isn't this site\n\n255\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.658\naccessible anymore?\n\n256\n00:14:54.658 --> 00:14:55.850\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n257\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.950\nWell, did you get the email that was sent?\n\n258\n00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.567\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because I show that it was sent.\n\n259\n00:14:59.567 --> 00:15:00.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.090\n>> Mr. Site Collection Owner.\n\n261\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.320\nYeah, I forgot about that.\n\n262\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.980\nShredded storage is an improvement\nthat's been around, and\n\n263\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.390\nthe benefit here is we use SQL blobs,\nand in the old days, we had.\n\n264\n00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.460\nLet's say if we had five\nversions of a document,\n\n265\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.480\nthat meant we have five times\nthe document size in storage.\n\n266\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.000\nIn other words,\nwe couldn't just save the deltas.\n\n267\n00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.419\nBut now we can with shredded storage.\n\n268\n00:15:26.419 --> 00:15:29.580\nSo we don't have to make\na trade off like we would.\n\n269\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.079\nMaybe there's a business\nneed to keep ten major.\n\n270\n00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:38.130\nThe ten previous major versions of\na document and associated minor or\n\n271\n00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.560\ndraft versions.\n\n272\n00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.120\nWe might have been reluctant to do that,\n\n273\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.720\nknowing how fast that\ncould grow our storage.\n\n274\n00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.835\nAnd there's not an unlimited\nstorage budget.\n\n275\n00:15:45.835 --> 00:15:49.383\nBut now, because with shredded storage,\nwe can just save the deltas,\n\n276\n00:15:49.383 --> 00:15:52.948\nin other words only the changes to\nthe original document are retained.\n\n277\n00:15:52.948 --> 00:15:59.413\nNow, the storage impact on retaining\nten versions is much less.\n\n278\n00:15:59.413 --> 00:16:02.041\nI mean,\nit's not much bigger than one version.\n\n279\n00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:06.332\nWhereas in the old days would've been 10\ntimes the storage of the original version,\n\n280\n00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:09.742\nso huge benefit there with shredded\nstorage which has been around for\n\n281\n00:16:09.742 --> 00:16:11.710\na few years and blob storage in sequel.\n\n282\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.920\nOkay, next stop we're gonna\ntalk about e-discovery and\n\n283\n00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.607\nthis is to do with electronic discovery,\ne-discovery.\n\n284\n00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:28.090\nSo often, if we're being sued,\nour company then the courts might request,\n\n285\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:33.050\nor demand really, access to content that\n\n286\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.445\na particular VP might have accessed or\nworked on in the previous 24 months.\n\n287\n00:16:37.445 --> 00:16:38.500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n288\n00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.730\n>> And so, from our E discovery\ncenter that's a site template.\n\n289\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.500\nI'll show you how to create In SharePoint.\n\n290\n00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.950\nWe can use that as a home base,\nif you like,\n\n291\n00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:51.570\nto pull data from email, and\nSharePoint, and files as well.\n\n292\n00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.250\nSo, it's a nice solution for\na variety of content sources\n\n293\n00:16:55.250 --> 00:17:00.210\nwe can pull in information based on\na Date Range or other filtering this\n\n294\n00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:05.690\nparticular VP might have worked on or\nhad some connection with.\n\n295\n00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.560\nSo that is useful e-Discovery,\n\n296\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.290\nand then we create a case, so\nif you're a large organization,\n\n297\n00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:18.740\nit's quite possible you have numerous\npending litigation cases against you.\n\n298\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.920\nIf you think of Apple and\nSamsung and Microsoft.\n\n299\n00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.830\nI mean, we here about several lawsuits.\n\n300\n00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.600\nThere's a lot more we never hear about.\n\n301\n00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.740\nSo being constantly under litigation and\n\n302\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.730\nbeing a litigator I'm not sure\nif that's the right terminology.\n\n303\n00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.210\nBut we're suing and being sued.\n\n304\n00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.510\nIt's litigious society.\n\n305\n00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.360\nSo you might the point is you might\nhave to manage several cases.\n\n306\n00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.310\nAnd again in our template our\nrediscovery template allows for that,\n\n307\n00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.750\nbecause if you think about it, a single\nperson like this B.P. example that I used.\n\n308\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.470\nThat person might be of\ninterest to multiple cases.\n\n309\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.640\nSo there's a way by setting up\na separate case for each case we can\n\n310\n00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:03.070\nfind information pertinent to that VP,\nin this case.\n\n311\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.160\nAnd even export it so\nwe can save it say to a hard drive.\n\n312\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.190\nAnd also put a hold on it,\nlet's say a retention policy.\n\n313\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:16.460\nWas set to expire certain content, like\na document this person might have created.\n\n314\n00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.460\nWell, with a litigation hold on it that\nmeans even though the policy says it\n\n315\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.050\nshould be deleted or moved, or archived,\nor some action taken, because a litigation\n\n316\n00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:30.260\nhold was placed on it, Via our case in our\nEdiscovery center no action will be taken\n\n317\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.400\non that document unless and\nuntil that legal hold is lifted.\n\n318\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.000\nOkay, so\nagain this includes objects in exchange,\n\n319\n00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.360\nnot just SharePoint,\nalso file server content.\n\n320\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.380\nOkay, let's see what this looks\nlike now in the interface.\n\n321\n00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:55.400\nSo I'm going back into my trusty DC and\nActive Directory Administrative Center.\n\n322\n00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.846\nAnd I wanna create a new user.\n\n323\n00:19:00.492 --> 00:19:02.300\nFor this demo.\n\n324\n00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.760\nAnd let's call this person Legal Larry.\n\n325\n00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.640\nLegal Larry,\nthat is more than a first name.\n\n326\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.852\nWell actually you know\nlets do it that way.\n\n327\n00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:19.890\nLegal Larry, Smith.\n\n328\n00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:26.227\nOkay we'll call him Legal Larry And\n\n329\n00:19:26.227 --> 00:19:29.478\nusual password.\n\n330\n00:19:34.677 --> 00:19:37.370\nAnd password never expires,\ncannot change password.\n\n331\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.720\nOkay, so there's Larry,\nand now, a new group.\n\n332\n00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.380\nWe're gonna create a legal group.\n\n333\n00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.160\nA new group here, Legal.\n\n334\n00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:59.460\nAnd let's go down to Members and add\n\n335\n00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:12.210\nAnd there's legal Larry Smith and okay.\n\n336\n00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.990\nNow, web application policy for\nthe legal team.\n\n337\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.850\nSo, Remember, and I mentioned in\n\n338\n00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.750\nthis course the importance of\nhaving diagrams on display.\n\n339\n00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.900\nSo, keep in mind Microsoft makes\nmany of these available, and\n\n340\n00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.600\nsome of them are really decent\n24 by 36 inch, 2 by 3 feet size.\n\n341\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.810\nNow, they're freely available,\nthat doesn't mean they're free to print.\n\n342\n00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.713\nLast time I went to a printer for\nthis it was about 50 bucks\n\n343\n00:20:40.713 --> 00:20:41.665\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:20:41.665 --> 00:20:44.740\n>> But for Azure or any architectural\n\n345\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.790\nposter that you want, try and keep this\nall in your head or look on a small screen\n\n346\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.820\nis a recipe for stress, so\n>> Especially if you're new to technology,\n\n347\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:57.096\nhaving, say,\na Share Point slide displayed, can\n\n348\n00:20:57.096 --> 00:21:01.870\nreally accelerate your understanding of\nhow the different components fit together.\n\n349\n00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.600\nSo, I bring this up here because we're\nabout to create a web application policy.\n\n350\n00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.650\nSo, permissions can be set at\nseveral levels in the farm.\n\n351\n00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.800\nYou know, they're farm wide settings,\n\n352\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.620\nthere are application level provisions\n>> As well as at the individual site\n\n353\n00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.700\ncollection and site level.\n\n354\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.460\nSo there are built in options to choose\nfrom at those levels I just mentioned.\n\n355\n00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.940\nPlus when you factor in the capability\nto create custom permission levels,\n\n356\n00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.836\nyou can see that your head could\nexplode [LAUGH] if you don't document.\n\n357\n00:21:29.836 --> 00:21:31.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's my.\n\n358\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.830\nI guess a general purpose\nwarning about permission and\n\n359\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.320\nmaking sure you are granting the correct\nkind of access, not too much,\n\n360\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.490\nnot too little, but just right.\n\n361\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.550\n>> Just right.\n>> So, I'll go into central admin.\n\n362\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.420\nNow im over in my apps server and\n\n363\n00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.909\nin central admin im going\nto manage web applications.\n\n364\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.600\nAnd I'll choose my Share Point 80, app.\n\n365\n00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.110\nAnd policy will be user policy.\n\n366\n00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.670\nNow, you can see some users already there.\n\n367\n00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.630\nI'm going to click on add users.\n\n368\n00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.910\nAnd the all zone's here, so\n\n369\n00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.710\nif you are call zones is a different\nway of accessing the same contents.\n\n370\n00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.100\nYou're coming in from a different place.\n\n371\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.670\nSo we've looked at extranet zones,\nintranet zones,\n\n372\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.120\ninternet zones, custom zones.\n\n373\n00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.350\nBut this polls is gonna\nfly no matter where a user\n\n374\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.800\nmaybe connecting in to the content\nfrom and also accounts for\n\n375\n00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.250\nany zones I may create in the future\ncuz at this point, we haven't created\n\n376\n00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.690\nalternate access mappings and zones,\ndifferent ways to access this content.\n\n377\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.940\nSo by leaving it at all zones, if I create\na new zone I know I'm to come back and\n\n378\n00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.140\nrevisit this policy setting.\n\n379\n00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.840\nI click on Next, and\n\n380\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.070\nlet's go real town, Legal.\n\n381\n00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.830\nWe hit enter it automatically\nchecks the name, verifies.\n\n382\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.070\nIf I clicked on the people picker,\nhover over it, it says check names.\n\n383\n00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.900\nThat's this little person\nicon with a check mark.\n\n384\n00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.360\nSame thing as hitting enter.\n\n385\n00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.410\nOkay.\nSo here's the permission levels applicable\n\n386\n00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.050\nto web applications,\n\n387\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:15.500\nwhich will apply to all site collections\nhosted within that web application.\n\n388\n00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:21.600\nI'm gonna say freed because that's all\nthe legal team would need, read access.\n\n389\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.200\nIn fact, we don't want them modifying or\nmaybe deleting the document,\n\n390\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.325\npretending it never existed.\n\n391\n00:23:26.325 --> 00:23:27.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Being paid under the table.\n\n392\n00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.050\n>> They wouldn't do that, would they?\n\n393\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.300\n>> No, just on TV.\n\n394\n00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.380\nAll right.\nYou'll hit finish.\n\n395\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.370\nAnd now we can see the real town legal.\n\n396\n00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.729\nThere's a policy there, full read.\n\n397\n00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.320\nI'll hit OK.\n\n398\n00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.990\nNow I wanna create a site collection.\n\n399\n00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.053\nA special kind of site collection,\ne-discovery.\n\n400\n00:23:51.053 --> 00:23:56.649\nSo remember, a we have a variety of\ntemplates built-in to SharePoint.\n\n401\n00:23:56.649 --> 00:23:59.774\nWe can create our own if we want,\nor modify built-in ones and\n\n402\n00:23:59.774 --> 00:24:01.629\nsave them as a different template.\n\n403\n00:24:01.629 --> 00:24:03.867\nSo right now, I wanna go into.\n\n404\n00:24:03.867 --> 00:24:07.387\nApplication measurements and\nunder Site Collections,\n\n405\n00:24:07.387 --> 00:24:11.868\nthe first option there is,\ncreate site collections, that's the one.\n\n406\n00:24:13.876 --> 00:24:19.237\nAnd then grab the correct web app here and\ncall this one, real town.\n\n407\n00:24:22.404 --> 00:24:23.371\nEDiscovery.\n\n408\n00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:32.284\nAll right and a description never hurts so\n\n409\n00:24:32.284 --> 00:24:35.379\nI'll say an eDiscovery.\n\n410\n00:24:38.506 --> 00:24:45.040\nCenter for legal.\n\n411\n00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.670\nAnd I will choose the URL as /sites.\n\n412\n00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:50.480\nI'll scroll up here.\n\n413\n00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.090\nAnd Discovery.\n\n414\n00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.210\nAgain, use an intelligent\nnaming convention here.\n\n415\n00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:05.510\nAnd I want in the Enterprise tab here.\n\n416\n00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.000\nWhoops.\n\n417\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.490\nThe eDiscovery template.\n\n418\n00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.210\neDiscovery Center.\n\n419\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.800\nUsername will be administrator.\n\n420\n00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.230\nReal time administrator.\n\n421\n00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.605\nWhoops, still getting used\nto the wheel on this.\n\n422\n00:25:21.605 --> 00:25:25.983\n[LAUGH]\nAll right.\n\n423\n00:25:25.983 --> 00:25:27.790\nAnd okay.\n\n424\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:29.720\nAll right,\nside collection's now been created.\n\n425\n00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.430\nSo, I'll click on the link to it.\n\n426\n00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.810\nUnder apps slash sites, slash discovery.\n\n427\n00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.890\n>> And then my favorite part.\n\n428\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.650\nI always takes a little bit to\nload that page at the first time.\n\n429\n00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.150\n>> The waiting is the hardest part.\n\n430\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:41.690\n>> Yes.\nHere we go.\n\n431\n00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.475\n>> Let's talk about that.\n\n432\n00:25:44.475 --> 00:25:48.976\n[LAUGH] Okay, there we go,\n\n433\n00:25:48.976 --> 00:25:52.256\nto authenticate.\n\n434\n00:25:55.561 --> 00:25:57.770\nI think I used that line last week.\n\n435\n00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.165\nI need new material each week.\n\n436\n00:25:59.165 --> 00:26:00.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kind as recycle cuz some of you'll\n\n437\n00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.715\nwatch the first week the basic share\npoint, I mean before the advance.\n\n438\n00:26:04.715 --> 00:26:05.409\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.090\nIt's different going to different\nclassroom environments,\n\n440\n00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.660\nbecause generally i see people\nthat I'll never see again.\n\n441\n00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.624\nSo can use the same tired stick and\nits new to them.\n\n442\n00:26:14.624 --> 00:26:19.570\n[LAUGH] All right,\nnow the site has appeared.\n\n443\n00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.530\nHallelujah.\n\n444\n00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.570\nSo you can see there like\nall templates in SharePoint\n\n445\n00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.900\nit comes preloaded with some web parts and\nsome contents.\n\n446\n00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.900\nHere we have some quick launch options,\nhere, cases, data loss prevention query,\n\n447\n00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.320\nsite contents.\n\n448\n00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.920\nSome of these enterprise templates\n\n449\n00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.570\nreally help you out because even\nif you are new to the template,\n\n450\n00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:44.070\nyou will find in your feed there is some\nuseful guidance here often with links.\n\n451\n00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.240\nFor example there is\na Get Started section, so\n\n452\n00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.890\nthe order you would normally configure,\neDiscovery Center,\n\n453\n00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:57.847\nand another place on the bottom right for\nIn-Place Hold,\n\n454\n00:26:57.847 --> 00:27:02.110\nSearch, & Export,\nleave you to your own devices.\n\n455\n00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.460\nThere's some guidance provided there,\nwhich is handy.\n\n456\n00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.040\n>> Very nice.\n>> So I'm\n\n457\n00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.890\ngonna under the gear icon there and\nsay Settings.\n\n458\n00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.370\nAnd I wanna grab some permissions here so\n\n459\n00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:15.940\nunder Users & Permissions I'll\nclick on People & Groups.\n\n460\n00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.270\nAnd I wanna add users,\nso I'll click on New.\n\n461\n00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.840\nAnd this will be Legal Larry.\n\n462\n00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.050\nNow I should get an option\ndown here which I do, so\n\n463\n00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:34.620\nit returns both the group name Legal and\nthe username Legal Larry.\n\n464\n00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.240\nI'll choose that first one there.\n\n465\n00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.340\nThe person and I click on share.\n\n466\n00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.030\nNow I can see Legal Larry Smith\nlives In that list.\n\n467\n00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.640\nNow next thing to do is\nto create a new case.\n\n468\n00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.790\nSo let's do that.\n\n469\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:28:01.410\nI'll click on Cases, and\nit says click to create new case.\n\n470\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:11.470\nLet's do that they call this one,\nAcme contractor's dispute.\n\n471\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.970\nWe got a beef with Acme.\n\n472\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.820\nMaybe they got a beef with us.\n\n473\n00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.768\n>> You are not using\nour products correctly.\n\n474\n00:28:18.768 --> 00:28:20.496\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n475\n00:28:20.496 --> 00:28:27.650\n[LAUGH]\nSo, Acme contract dispute,\n\n476\n00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.650\nlet's call this and\nI'll give a description.\n\n477\n00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:36.794\nSo, let's say a case reference of A01.\n\n478\n00:28:36.794 --> 00:28:41.220\nActually, let's make it.\n\n479\n00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.180\nThat's good, A01 And URL.\n\n480\n00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.620\nNotice how a separate safe\ngets created for every case.\n\n481\n00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.490\nSo, it's easy to manage the various\ncases and information discovered and\n\n482\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.740\nstored in that site.\n\n483\n00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.600\nSo, I will give you unknown name of A01.\n\n484\n00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:05.110\nAnd notice the only template\noption is eDiscover Case,\n\n485\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.420\nwhich is good because that's what we want.\n\n486\n00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.830\nWe don't want people\nclicking something else,\n\n487\n00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.710\nso we don't even provide\nthat something else.\n\n488\n00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.659\nI'll leave the defaults,\nin terms of permissions and\n\n489\n00:29:14.659 --> 00:29:18.764\nwhether to display the site in the quick\nlaunch and top link bar, and click Create.\n\n490\n00:29:22.735 --> 00:29:24.680\nSo back at the central admin page now.\n\n491\n00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.200\nI'm going to click on\nManage Service Applications.\n\n492\n00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.270\nAnd I'll scroll down to my\nsearch service application.\n\n493\n00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:33.900\nUp on the ribbon.\n\n494\n00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.660\nClick Manage.\n\n495\n00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:41.210\nAnd then I want Content Sources\non the quick launch bar.\n\n496\n00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.360\nI have the bar on my mind.\n\n497\n00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.740\nOkay.\n\n498\n00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.680\nThat'll take a few seconds to load up and\n\n499\n00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.460\nthen we're gonna crawl\nthe local SharePoint sites.\n\n500\n00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.070\nSo let's try the Full Crawl.\n\n501\n00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.670\nAre you sure?\n\n502\n00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:54.515\nSure I'm sure.\n\n503\n00:29:56.865 --> 00:29:58.680\nAnd you can see the status of starting.\n\n504\n00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:07.150\nThe crawl has just completed and let's go\nback to our Acme contract dispute page.\n\n505\n00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.300\nSo under when we create a new\ncase in an eDiscovery center\n\n506\n00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.420\nit auto-magically creates a nice\nsite that looks like this.\n\n507\n00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:21.320\nSo it's got web parts optimized for\nwhat we'd need in terms of eDiscovery.\n\n508\n00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.000\nSo you can see an Identify and\nHold section there and\n\n509\n00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.130\na Search and Export section.\n\n510\n00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:31.935\nSo I'll click on eDiscovery Sets and\nI want a new item.\n\n511\n00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:44.890\nWe'll call this one Acme\ncontractual Documents.\n\n512\n00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.870\nAnd down here under sources or\nbeside sources I'll click on add and\n\n513\n00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:52.980\nmanage sources.\n\n514\n00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:01.580\nAnd notice how we have lines really\nan unlimited number of lines is three\n\n515\n00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.580\nby default, but you can add, so if you\nwanna search specific mailboxes we can.\n\n516\n00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.538\nWe're interested in specific URLs,\nso I can enter one or\n\n517\n00:31:09.538 --> 00:31:12.016\nmore URLs which I'll do right now.\n\n518\n00:31:14.026 --> 00:31:18.923\nAnd this'll be actually in\nthe site collection that I'm\n\n519\n00:31:18.923 --> 00:31:23.616\ncurrently working in just\nbecause it was easy to upload\n\n520\n00:31:23.616 --> 00:31:28.429\nthe document there and\nthat Contents crawled.\n\n521\n00:31:28.429 --> 00:31:32.590\nSo Discovery/ao1.\n\n522\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.680\nAnd there's a checker.\n\n523\n00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.400\nAnytime there's some kind of people picker\nor validation checker for username.\n\n524\n00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.000\nI always like to take advantage of it,\njust to make sure right away whether I've\n\n525\n00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.090\nmistyped a location in this case,\nfor example.\n\n526\n00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:52.834\nSo it usually takes a few seconds to come\nback with a nice checkmark on the left,\n\n527\n00:31:52.834 --> 00:31:57.735\nwhich it did, and\nwe can see here it prettied up the name to\n\n528\n00:31:57.735 --> 00:32:01.745\nACME contract dispute,\nso now I can hit okay.\n\n529\n00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:02.858\nAnd I'm gonna filter.\n\n530\n00:32:02.858 --> 00:32:05.618\nSo a free text query term.\n\n531\n00:32:05.618 --> 00:32:09.749\nWell how about acme or acme contracts.\n\n532\n00:32:09.749 --> 00:32:11.359\nSee what happens there.\n\n533\n00:32:11.359 --> 00:32:15.655\nAnd notice I can specify a start and\nor end date if I'm often interested in\n\n534\n00:32:15.655 --> 00:32:20.587\na particular time to search for as opposed\nto if someone's been there at the firm for\n\n535\n00:32:20.587 --> 00:32:25.025\n20 years you don't necessarily wanna\nknow what they did the first 18 or\n\n536\n00:32:25.025 --> 00:32:27.650\nmaybe the last two you do,\nyou can specify.\n\n537\n00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:32.210\nAnd then you can also filter by author,\nor sender and\n\n538\n00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.870\nsome other parameters as well if you want.\n\n539\n00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:42.150\nSo I'm going to scroll down now and\n\n540\n00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.609\nI'm going to enable in place\nhold this radio button here.\n\n541\n00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.940\nSo this way we can hold content\nin place wherever it lives and\n\n542\n00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.400\nshare, but we don't have to\nmove it somewhere to hold it.\n\n543\n00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.750\nIt can be held, in other words\nprotected from modification and\n\n544\n00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:02.550\ndeletion, exactly where it is now.\n\n545\n00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.040\nNow, let's say that a certain source\nthat does not support in place hold,\n\n546\n00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.740\nin that case you'd have to export it.\n\n547\n00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.440\nAnd you can do that,\nwhich we'll look at a little later.\n\n548\n00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.340\nSo now,\nI'm going to click on preview results.\n\n549\n00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:17.017\nNow there's nothing in Exchange\nhere in the exchange tab.\n\n550\n00:33:17.017 --> 00:33:20.446\nBut that's because we don't have Exchange\nset up, and we didn't search exchange.\n\n551\n00:33:20.446 --> 00:33:21.821\nBut if I click on the SharePoint tab.\n\n552\n00:33:25.939 --> 00:33:29.152\nSo, now is it takes going back in\nto get actually results appearance,\n\n553\n00:33:29.152 --> 00:33:30.070\nlet's do that.\n\n554\n00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.910\nI'll go back in the preview results.\n\n555\n00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:34.970\nThis may take a while.\n\n556\n00:33:36.536 --> 00:33:39.399\nSo, again sometimes you have to\nclick Preview results more than one,\n\n557\n00:33:39.399 --> 00:33:40.427\nsort to just be patient.\n\n558\n00:33:40.427 --> 00:33:44.089\nI'm not a patient person, you may be.\n\n559\n00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:49.679\nSo now we can see here on the SharePoint\ntab that we've got a variety of returns\n\n560\n00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:54.934\nhere, and the preview results which\nis all I wanted to see at this point.\n\n561\n00:33:54.934 --> 00:33:58.852\nAnd now I'm gonna click on Save\nto save the eDiscovery set.\n\n562\n00:34:02.044 --> 00:34:05.395\nAnd we can see the item there\nacuity contractual documents.\n\n563\n00:34:06.415 --> 00:34:12.470\nNow let's run the eDiscovery in place\nhold processor timing job or timer jobs.\n\n564\n00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:15.998\nSo I'll go back to my\ncentral admin site and\n\n565\n00:34:15.998 --> 00:34:22.330\ngo to monitoring And\nthen I want Timer Jobs.\n\n566\n00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:23.794\nI wanna review jobs definition.\n\n567\n00:34:26.485 --> 00:34:28.525\nRemember, a lot of\nrepetitive events happen,\n\n568\n00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:33.345\nSharePoint from every number of seconds or\nminutes to hours, days, weeks, months.\n\n569\n00:34:33.345 --> 00:34:36.150\nWe don't have time to wait for\nthis normal cycle for\n\n570\n00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:41.275\ne-discovery in place hold processing\nto occur, so we're gonna kick start it.\n\n571\n00:34:42.805 --> 00:34:48.807\nSo, scroll down here and\nit's right here so\n\n572\n00:34:48.807 --> 00:34:53.998\nI can click on it, it's scheduled for\n\n573\n00:34:53.998 --> 00:34:57.582\nonce an hour processing.\n\n574\n00:34:57.582 --> 00:35:01.445\nSo, normally in production\nyou don't run it manually,\n\n575\n00:35:01.445 --> 00:35:04.823\nyou just wait usually working on for\nother cases or\n\n576\n00:35:04.823 --> 00:35:09.830\nthe natural hour cycle is sufficient but\nin our case again I am impatient.\n\n577\n00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.880\nSo any timer job you have the ability to\ngo into the timer job like I just did by\n\n578\n00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.590\nclicking on it.\n\n579\n00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.868\nAnd then you see at the bottom\nthere there's a run now option so\n\n580\n00:35:18.868 --> 00:35:20.189\nI'll click that.\n\n581\n00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:27.370\nAnd now I'm gonna test the in\nplace hold functionality.\n\n582\n00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.670\nOkay, so\nnow I'm back in my documents library.\n\n583\n00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:37.180\nLet's see what happens when trying to\ndelete a document that's under hold.\n\n584\n00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:45.741\nSo, I am going to Select the document,\ncontext menu here.\n\n585\n00:35:45.741 --> 00:35:47.569\nDelete.\n\n586\n00:35:49.857 --> 00:35:50.630\nAnd I'll say OK.\n\n587\n00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.270\nNow I'll go into site contents.\n\n588\n00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.800\nNow you can see there's a new app created.\n\n589\n00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.360\nRemember an app, now a days\neverything's an app in SharePoint so\n\n590\n00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.691\nwhat used to be known\nas document library or\n\n591\n00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:10.856\nlist which is quite explanatory is now\nknown as an app to be cool, all right.\n\n592\n00:36:10.856 --> 00:36:11.823\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n593\n00:36:11.823 --> 00:36:15.962\nthis is a new preservation\nhold library app, if you like.\n\n594\n00:36:15.962 --> 00:36:20.781\nAnd this will contain\nthe object I tried to delete.\n\n595\n00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:32.585\nWhich is right here.\n\n596\n00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:34.540\n>> Mm-hm, so\n\n597\n00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.210\nthe user actually thought they deleted it,\nbut, they were unsuccessful.\n\n598\n00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:38.720\n>> Right, and\n\n599\n00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.209\nas you'd expect, not everyone can\nsee this Preservation Hold Library.\n\n600\n00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:49.130\nNow the user might be very glad to\nthink the document is deleted but\n\n601\n00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.460\nbecause there's specific reasons\nit's on hold in the first place\n\n602\n00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.930\nwe want to make sure that\nit's inaccessible to them.\n\n603\n00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:59.360\nSo you'd have to have sufficient\nprivileges to be able to see\n\n604\n00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.829\nthis Preservation Hold Library and\nthe contents within it.\n\n605\n00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.110\nAll right next up is query and\nexporting content.\n\n606\n00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.910\nSometimes you want this,\n\n607\n00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:13.520\nthe results of your scouring of email,\nfile server, and Sharepoint.\n\n608\n00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.410\nYou want want that explorer to save\nto a thumb drive or a hard drive.\n\n609\n00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.080\nSo how do we do that?\n\n610\n00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.910\nNow we're gonna do another crawl.\n\n611\n00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:24.627\nSo I'll go back into.\n\n612\n00:37:27.108 --> 00:37:28.373\nCentral Admin.\n\n613\n00:37:36.142 --> 00:37:37.263\nAnd Service Apps.\n\n614\n00:37:44.938 --> 00:37:46.437\nContent sources\n\n615\n00:37:57.296 --> 00:38:00.637\nAnd we'll do another full crawl\non local SharePoint sites.\n\n616\n00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.370\nSo that crawl is complete.\n\n617\n00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:03.930\n>> All right, Mark.\n\n618\n00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.850\nThanks for that look on\nEnterprise content management.\n\n619\n00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.740\nTaking a look at managing the content.\n\n620\n00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.230\nA lot of information being stored in our\nSharePoint sites that we've gotta be able\n\n621\n00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.790\nto take good care of retention policies.\n\n622\n00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.780\nAnd we also looked at the setting\nup e-discovery, right?\n\n623\n00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:23.240\nThe special site that gets created so\nwe can put documents on legal hold.\n\n624\n00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.120\nEven documents can be part\nof more than one legal hold.\n\n625\n00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.150\nA lot of neat stuff there,\nMark, thank you for that.\n\n626\n00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.240\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n627\n00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.140\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n628\n00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.003\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n629\n00:38:34.003 --> 00:38:37.093\n>>

00:00:16.979\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:19.990\nAnd today we're doing\nAdvanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.976\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're gonna be looking at web content\n\n6\n00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:25.050\nmanagement.\n\n7\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.710\nWe've taken a look at\nenterprise content management.\n\n8\n00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.800\nNow we're going to divide that up,\nbreak it down a little bit and\n\n9\n00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.180\nget into web content management, and\nhere to do that for us is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n10\n00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.980\nHow you doing, Mark?\n\n11\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.540\n>> Thanks, Mike, great.\n\n12\n00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.570\nAll right, so, yes, web content management\nis a subset of enterprise content\n\n13\n00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.210\nmanagement, a prime driver for\n\n14\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.460\ncompanies adopting SharePoint, is to\nget away from a multi-vendor solution.\n\n15\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.070\nThey might have had a separate\nprovider for intranet, extranet and\n\n16\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.640\nInternet applications.\n\n17\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.930\nWouldn't it be better and more streamlined\nto have the same platform for all three?\n\n18\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.545\nAbsolutely, of course it would.\n\n19\n00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:02.232\nThank you.\n[LAUGH] I said, wait a beep there for\n\n20\n00:01:02.232 --> 00:01:03.767\nthe audience respond.\n\n21\n00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:04.348\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n22\n00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:05.775\n>> My host, Mike.\n\n23\n00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:08.250\nAwesome, so how does this relate?\n\n24\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.670\nSo we know we can use SharePoint for\nall those applications I just mentioned,\n\n25\n00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.160\nwhether we're communicating\ninternally with employees or\n\n26\n00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.640\nusing extranet for partners,\nor Internet for customers.\n\n27\n00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.330\nMaybe they have millions of customers,\nthey wanna publish their catalog so\n\n28\n00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.340\nthey can view and make their choices.\n\n29\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.190\nI'll show you how to do that,\nto create a catalog later.\n\n30\n00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.760\nBut, we have a publishing portal, which is\none of the templates we get in SharePoint.\n\n31\n00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.570\nSo remember we've got a variety of\ntemplates we could choose depending on\n\n32\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.140\nwhat the website to\nthe function of the website.\n\n33\n00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.380\nThis includes things\nlike enabling features,\n\n34\n00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.770\nif I enable the publishing portal for\n\n35\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.300\nexample, certain web parts would appear\non the page and we're introducing certain\n\n36\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.220\nfunctionality that wasn't there\nbefore installing the template.\n\n37\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.650\nSo it's not just the template\nyou're selecting, but\n\n38\n00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.820\nother actions take place to enable\nthe use of the publishing template.\n\n39\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.650\nIn some cases,\nespecially the publishing portal,\n\n40\n00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.100\nthere are features we have to enable at\nthe site level as well to take advantage,\n\n41\n00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.920\nto be able to use\nthe publishing functionality.\n\n42\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.330\nEnterprise Wiki is another option\nyou can use for publishing.\n\n43\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.670\nSome organizations don't bother\ndeploying Wiki technology at all.\n\n44\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.170\nOthers swear by it as an informal\nway to get ideas curated or\n\n45\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.600\nstarted and people can add content,\nanother communication channel.\n\n46\n00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.750\nIt may or\nmay not work in your environment, or\n\n47\n00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.180\nit may not be adopted by many users but\nthose that use it, do swear by it.\n\n48\n00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.800\nSo, the product catalog I mentioned,\nit's a way to we can set up the terms.\n\n49\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.498\nI'll show you how to do that, so\nthat a user can navigate down through\n\n50\n00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:48.710\nthe term hierarchy to find\na product they're looking for, or\n\n51\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.153\nwant to reorder, or what have you.\n\n52\n00:02:51.153 --> 00:02:56.373\nAll right, we have special groups and\npermissions enabled as well,\n\n53\n00:02:56.373 --> 00:03:01.150\ndepending on whether we choose\na publishing site, say or not.\n\n54\n00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.635\nAnd we have navigation available like we\nhave with many templates, when we create\n\n55\n00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:09.795\nthem we can choose to use separate\nnavigation compared to the current site,\n\n56\n00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:11.670\nor just use the same navigation.\n\n57\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.750\nSo we always want to make it as easy as\npossible for users to know where they are,\n\n58\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.910\nhow they can get back to where they were,\nso they don't waste a lot of energy trying\n\n59\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.430\nto figure out again where they\nare in your SharePoint hierarchy.\n\n60\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.930\nAnd I wanna make this\nas easy as possible for\n\n61\n00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.460\nthem to do what they\ncame to your site to do.\n\n62\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.160\nWe also have master pages which we can\ncustomize the overall look and feel.\n\n63\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.200\nNow that is a very dangerous tool to\nbe able to edit those master pages,\n\n64\n00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.800\nit affects the whole look and feel and\n\n65\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.830\nusability of your site, so very few\npeople should have the capability to just\n\n66\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.600\nrandomly change a site template look and\nfeel, for example.\n\n67\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.090\nSo, typically your SharePoint designers.\n\n68\n00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.840\nPeople with design skills would have\naccess to modifying those if necessary and\n\n69\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.550\nnot the general user population.\n\n70\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.130\nDevice channels we have as well,\nso this lets us\n\n71\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.400\nrender content differently depending\non the device accessing SharePoint.\n\n72\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.060\nWe've seen,\njust from our own use in the real world,\n\n73\n00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.430\nwe're often using a variety of form\nfactors to access the same content.\n\n74\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.715\nWe can't just have,\nlet's say we're used to seeing content\n\n75\n00:04:19.715 --> 00:04:22.936\non a regular laptop screen,\nit doesn't make sense to try and\n\n76\n00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:26.242\nsquish it down into a tablet or\nphone, it would be illegible.\n\n77\n00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:29.302\nSo it's reformatting required.\n\n78\n00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:34.246\nSo there's tools to be able to do that\nautomatically once you set up a device\n\n79\n00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:39.110\nchannels, so that you know the content\nwill be legible and functional and\n\n80\n00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.384\nusable no matter what device the user's\naccessing your SharePoint site with.\n\n81\n00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:48.340\nWeb parts,\nwe have content related web parts.\n\n82\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.470\nThings like content roll ups,\nsupport for multilingual sites.\n\n83\n00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.980\nSo some of you working in\ninternational environments or\n\n84\n00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.170\ninternational divisions where having\na multilingual interface is important, or\n\n85\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.710\nthe option for the user to choose,\nor in many cases it's based on their\n\n86\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.700\nOS language, they would automatically get\ntheir SharePoint's information rendered in\n\n87\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.048\nthe correct language, assuming you've\nsetup the correct language packs for that.\n\n88\n00:05:14.048 --> 00:05:18.642\nAnd caching is available as well, so\nto reduce round trips to the SQL storage\n\n89\n00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:24.195\nthe backend and also to get faster\nservice of user requested pages.\n\n90\n00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:26.842\nOkay, so planning.\n\n91\n00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:30.687\nAgain, there's could be different\nplanning stages depending on what\n\n92\n00:05:30.687 --> 00:05:33.710\nyou're using SharePoint for\nin the publishing realm.\n\n93\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.270\nIs it just for internal use,\nas an intranet?\n\n94\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.600\nIs it external use,\n\n95\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.790\nmaybe some partner organizations,\nin an extranet format or Internet.\n\n96\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.710\nSo maybe just read only anonymous access\nto potentially millions of customers or\n\n97\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.990\nviewers of your page.\n\n98\n00:05:50.396 --> 00:05:53.630\nSo there's different methods\nof authentication or\n\n99\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.990\nno authentication depending on which\ntype or which audience you're serving.\n\n100\n00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.640\nOkay, there's also this concept of\ncross site collection publishing.\n\n101\n00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.390\nThis is where you offer\nthe content at one site and yet\n\n102\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.330\nit gets consumed in one or\nmore other sites.\n\n103\n00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.060\nSo you update it once in\nthe authoring site, and\n\n104\n00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.070\nthen these other sites automatically get,\nfor example, a product list updated in\n\n105\n00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.260\nthose sites, as opposed to you having\nto make multiple changes one per site.\n\n106\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.183\nNo, you change the content once and\nthose consuming sites through cross site\n\n107\n00:06:26.183 --> 00:06:29.635\npublishing get the updated say,\npricelist, for a given product.\n\n108\n00:06:29.635 --> 00:06:31.921\n>> Nice.\n\n109\n00:06:31.921 --> 00:06:35.019\n>> Okay, so if you don't have a need,\nif it's a very small,\n\n110\n00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:38.820\nmaybe a departmental Internet for\nexample, or it's a small company,\n\n111\n00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.500\nyou may not have a need for\ncross site publishing.\n\n112\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.369\nTherefore, the authoring site becomes\nthe only place to view the content you're\n\n113\n00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:48.917\ncreating, so cross-site publishing\ndoesn't enter into the equation.\n\n114\n00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:52.081\nOkay.\n\n115\n00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:58.772\nLet's look now at, we're gonna look at\nmanaged navigation and catalog sites,\n\n116\n00:06:58.772 --> 00:06:59.460\nas promised.\n\n117\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.459\nWe're gonna use some clothing examples\njust to get some reality around\n\n118\n00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:08.190\nmanaged navigation and catalog sites.\n\n119\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.280\nSo you might have a situation.\n\n120\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.960\nAnother way to think\nof managed navigation,\n\n121\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.610\nmaybe you've got sports equipment.\n\n122\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.100\nFor example, so\nmaybe you're selling unicycles,\n\n123\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.688\nhoverboards, and amphibious cars.\n\n124\n00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:24.585\n>> Hm, nice.\n\n125\n00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:28.358\n>> [LAUGH] So then you could\ndrill down under amphibious cars,\n\n126\n00:07:28.358 --> 00:07:31.823\ndo you want a convertible\namphibious car or do you want\n\n127\n00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:36.450\nan armored car to go through the water and\non land like those duck boats?\n\n128\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.620\nWhere people are going quack,\n\n129\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.750\nquack on these city tours, or\nbicycles is a better example,\n\n130\n00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.580\nmaybe there's a tricycle category you can\ndrill down into gold-plated tricycles.\n\n131\n00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.170\nIt's getting silly now,\nbut you get the point.\n\n132\n00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.672\nThere's gonna be natural hierarchies,\ntaxonomies, if you will.\n\n133\n00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:58.367\nIf you think the animal kingdom or\nthe plant kingdom, there's natural ways of\n\n134\n00:07:58.367 --> 00:08:03.295\norganizing data that make sense to people\nstudying or researching in that field.\n\n135\n00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:06.116\nYou might think of maybe\nschool population of students,\n\n136\n00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:09.360\nyou're gonna typically organize by grade,\nmaybe by homeroom.\n\n137\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.062\nMaybe there's some cross-referencing\nwith the teacher or responsible or\n\n138\n00:08:13.062 --> 00:08:14.540\nguidance counselor.\n\n139\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:20.430\nSo thinking your own organization,\nnatural ways of ordering employees,\n\n140\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.340\nproducts, customers in\na way that makes sense.\n\n141\n00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.310\nIn a way that users might navigate or\n\n142\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.050\ndrill down to find the information\nthey're looking for.\n\n143\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.540\nOkay, so I went back in central\nadministration, my home away from home.\n\n144\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.457\nAnd let's go down into\napplication management.\n\n145\n00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:41.219\nAnd I'm gonna create site collections.\n\n146\n00:08:44.896 --> 00:08:47.870\nMake sure I'm using the right web app,\nyes I am.\n\n147\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.781\nAnd this title will be Products.\n\n148\n00:08:55.783 --> 00:08:59.300\nAnd we'll call this Product Catalog.\n\n149\n00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:11.990\nAnd then I'll create a URL slash site\nslash catalog, keep the naming simple.\n\n150\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.500\nAnd now I'll go to my publishing template.\n\n151\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.120\nWe talked about some of these\noptions a few minutes ago.\n\n152\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.260\nAnd I'm gonna choose product\ncatalog as the template type.\n\n153\n00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.708\nMake myself the primary site\ncollection administrator.\n\n154\n00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:36.266\nAnd okay.\n\n155\n00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:44.059\nAnd there's my site created and\nI'll click on that.\n\n156\n00:09:53.287 --> 00:09:55.224\nAnd authenticates.\n\n157\n00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:02.126\nNow this is another example of\na useful template where they don't\n\n158\n00:10:02.126 --> 00:10:03.700\njust throw you to the wind.\n\n159\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.310\nNo, Microsoft sets you up to\n\n160\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.900\nwin by including links to actions\nyou're going to be doing.\n\n161\n00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.280\nAt least some of them you'll be doing,\nfor example, creating site columns,\n\n162\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.040\nmanaging site content types, managing\nthe hierarchy in the Term Store, and more.\n\n163\n00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.970\nSo we'll be doing these things.\n\n164\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.154\nBut first,\nwe're gonna create site columns.\n\n165\n00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:30.512\nAnd I could, theoretically, just scroll\ndown through hundreds of site columns.\n\n166\n00:10:30.512 --> 00:10:34.768\nBut what a waste of time because\nMicrosoft conveniently has groupings.\n\n167\n00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:39.225\nAnd I can filter the scope\nof what's shown in terms of\n\n168\n00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:42.882\ncolumns by using the show group drop down.\n\n169\n00:10:42.882 --> 00:10:45.950\nAnd I'll choose product catalog columns.\n\n170\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.000\nAnd that's a much more manageable number,\njust four columns right now.\n\n171\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.100\nWe're going to add to that total, but\n\n172\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.090\nit's far easier to work with\na smaller number of course.\n\n173\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:11:00.533\nSo I'll click on create and the first\ncolumn I'm going to create is size.\n\n174\n00:11:04.057 --> 00:11:06.780\nSo I'm creating a new site column now.\n\n175\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.630\nI can put it in existing group.\n\n176\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.120\nI could create a new group if I want,\nbut I don't wanna do that because\n\n177\n00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.900\nyou guessed it, it's going in the product\ncatalog columns existing group.\n\n178\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.880\nAnd I'm going to add another column\ncalled Quantity the same way\n\n179\n00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.720\nI created the size column quantity.\n\n180\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:35.070\nAnd this time I'm gonna choose not just\nthe default single line of text option.\n\n181\n00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:41.163\nBut notice all the different ways we\ncan capture data to populate a column.\n\n182\n00:11:41.163 --> 00:11:45.260\nSo it could be a choice menu,\nin this case, I want a number.\n\n183\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.980\nAnd there's other options here\nincluding manage metadata,\n\n184\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.270\nbut I won't get into that now.\n\n185\n00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.629\nI'll put the Site Column into\nthe Product Catalog columns again.\n\n186\n00:11:58.308 --> 00:11:59.149\nAnd okay.\n\n187\n00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.375\nThere's other options here to require\na column contains information.\n\n188\n00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:07.944\nIn other words,\nI can't add a new document or product,\n\n189\n00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:11.552\nin this case, without specifying a field.\n\n190\n00:12:11.552 --> 00:12:14.577\nIt has to have this column\ncontaining information.\n\n191\n00:12:14.577 --> 00:12:17.643\nThere's also an option to\nenforce unique values,\n\n192\n00:12:17.643 --> 00:12:20.367\nwhich can be useful in\ncase of some metadata.\n\n193\n00:12:20.367 --> 00:12:22.381\nFor example, if you are using\na serial number or customer ID,\n\n194\n00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:23.559\nyou don't want duplicate values.\n\n195\n00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:28.620\nBut that's again, I digress,\nI just hit OK before further division.\n\n196\n00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:35.074\nAnd one more column to create and\nthis will be color.\n\n197\n00:12:39.378 --> 00:12:43.378\nAnd I'll put it in the Product Catalog\ncolumn one more time.\n\n198\n00:12:50.924 --> 00:12:51.739\nAnd okay.\n\n199\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.540\nNext up I'm gonna create\na product related content type.\n\n200\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.187\nSo to do that I'm gonna go into my\ngear menu and site settings and\n\n201\n00:13:03.187 --> 00:13:07.669\nunder web designer galleries,\nwe have site content types.\n\n202\n00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.570\nRemember our content type?\n\n203\n00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.488\nA unique grouping of metadata columns.\n\n204\n00:13:15.234 --> 00:13:18.020\nSo there's some built in content types.\n\n205\n00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.441\nI wanna create my own,\nso I'll click Create.\n\n206\n00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:25.469\nAnd I'm gonna call this Clothing products.\n\n207\n00:13:34.236 --> 00:13:39.390\nAnd the parent content type will be\nfrom Product Catalog content types.\n\n208\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.830\nAnd my options here are product or\nproduct with image.\n\n209\n00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:49.450\nI'll just keep it at the vanilla product\nand I'll put the site content type\n\n210\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:54.540\ninto Product Catalog content types.\n\n211\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.153\nAnd okay.\n\n212\n00:13:59.153 --> 00:14:01.554\nAll right, so\nnow I've got a site content type.\n\n213\n00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:03.620\nI wanna populate it with\nsome additional columns.\n\n214\n00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.263\nSo I'll click on add from\nexisting site columns.\n\n215\n00:14:12.448 --> 00:14:15.220\nAnd again, we wanna filter out and\nscroll through hundreds of options.\n\n216\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:20.190\nLet's filter by Product Catalogue columns,\nspecifically the columns I just created\n\n217\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:25.200\nthat don't already exist,\nwhich is color, quality, and size.\n\n218\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.938\nI'll add all those.\n\n219\n00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:30.160\nAnd okay.\n\n220\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:38.430\nAnd I'll click on the S logo here to\ngo back to my products home page.\n\n221\n00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.790\nNow I wanna add the Clothing products\ncontent type to my products list.\n\n222\n00:14:44.415 --> 00:14:46.788\nSo I'm going under add catalog items.\n\n223\n00:14:46.788 --> 00:14:51.815\nSo often on these site templates, like\ne-discovery or in this case, the product\n\n224\n00:14:51.815 --> 00:14:56.507\ncatalog, you're not necessarily doing\nthe activities in order they're presented.\n\n225\n00:14:56.507 --> 00:15:01.057\nI don't code the products, but\nthey do all have some relevance to\n\n226\n00:15:01.057 --> 00:15:05.477\nwhat you may be doing now or\nin the future in regards to this template.\n\n227\n00:15:05.477 --> 00:15:09.927\nSo I'm going down here to add catalog\nitems and I'll click on products list.\n\n228\n00:15:11.867 --> 00:15:16.057\nI'll go up to my lists\ntab in the ribbon and\n\n229\n00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:17.879\nthen over on the right is list settings.\n\n230\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.820\nAnd now I wanna go under content types,\nso I'll scroll down.\n\n231\n00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.350\nI'm gonna add from existing\nsite content types.\n\n232\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:35.280\nAgain, we'll filter by\nProduct Catalog content types and\n\n233\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.644\nwe want Clothing products.\n\n234\n00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:41.212\nAnd Add and OK.\n\n235\n00:15:44.815 --> 00:15:49.551\nAnd under Content Types here,\n\n236\n00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:54.657\nwe've got a product with image.\n\n237\n00:15:54.657 --> 00:15:55.499\nI'll click on that.\n\n238\n00:15:55.499 --> 00:15:57.557\nI'm gonna get rid of that one.\n\n239\n00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:02.474\nSo I select it and then I choose\nthe Delete this content type option,\n\n240\n00:16:02.474 --> 00:16:04.970\nam I sure, sure I'm sure.\n\n241\n00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:09.280\nNow I'm going to go to my settings page.\n\n242\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:15.770\nI'm actually here, I'll scroll down,\nunder Views I'll click on all items.\n\n243\n00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.869\nNow some of these options don't\nlook like hyperlinks, but they are.\n\n244\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.250\nAs you see if you hover over them.\n\n245\n00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.260\nAll right, so now there are some\ncolumns that are visible in the view,\n\n246\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.795\nthis has nothing to do whether\nthe column is deleted or not,\n\n247\n00:16:31.795 --> 00:16:35.260\nit's just these columns exist you\ncan make them visible if you want.\n\n248\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.750\nNow the three site columns I just\ncreated I wanna make them visible, so\n\n249\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.709\nI will select Color.\n\n250\n00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:47.576\nQuantity and size, And okay.\n\n251\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:56.005\nWe'll click the logo again in the upper\nleft to go back to the Products homepage.\n\n252\n00:16:56.005 --> 00:16:59.065\nNow, here comes\nthe configuring the terms set.\n\n253\n00:16:59.065 --> 00:17:02.335\nSo I have to manually put in,\nactually not necessarily manually.\n\n254\n00:17:02.335 --> 00:17:06.060\nI can import from an Excel spreadsheet,\nso if I'm 3M for example.\n\n255\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:12.350\n[LAUGH] I have tens of thousands of\nproducts, not gonna manually enter them.\n\n256\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.580\nProbably already configured\nsome kind of term hierarchy,\n\n257\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.130\nI can import them from\nan Excel spreadsheet.\n\n258\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.580\nBut for this demo, there's so\nfew I'm just gonna manually enter them so\n\n259\n00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.380\nyou know how to do that the old\nfashioned way, manually.\n\n260\n00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:29.250\nSo now I'm gonna click on the third\noption down here Manage Item Hierarchy\n\n261\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.180\nin Term Store.\n\n262\n00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.610\nAnd let that load up.\n\n263\n00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:43.460\nOkay, now down here at the bottom of the,\nnow the left nav here,\n\n264\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.395\nwe've got sight collection,\napps, sites, catalog Log.\n\n265\n00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:53.725\nSo, I'm gonna expand that and\nI'll click on Product Hierarchy.\n\n266\n00:17:53.725 --> 00:17:56.155\nThis could be a little finicky\ndepending on where you click,\n\n267\n00:17:56.155 --> 00:17:58.575\nyou might not see the drop down\noption you actually expect.\n\n268\n00:17:58.575 --> 00:18:00.845\nSo, it's just something\nyou'll learn by doing.\n\n269\n00:18:00.845 --> 00:18:06.669\nSo, you could see there's a little\ntiny arrow on the right and\n\n270\n00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:13.624\ntooltip helpfully says click to expand and\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n271\n00:18:13.624 --> 00:18:20.360\nAnd I wanna create a term and\nthe term will be clothing products, ops.\n\n272\n00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:27.740\nTypo there,\nclothing products Hit Enter there.\n\n273\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.980\nAnd, I will click back\non Clothing Products.\n\n274\n00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.721\nAnd now,\nI'm going to click on Create Term.\n\n275\n00:18:41.322 --> 00:18:43.899\nAnd this will be called Accessories.\n\n276\n00:18:49.535 --> 00:18:51.819\nAnd, I go back to Accessories.\n\n277\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.200\nAnd I'm gonna create a term.\n\n278\n00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:00.274\nWe'll call this Ankle\n\n279\n00:19:00.274 --> 00:19:06.363\nbracelets.\n\n280\n00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:09.960\nAnd I need to create another term here.\n\n281\n00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.460\nScarves.\n\n282\n00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.229\nOkay.\n\n283\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.180\nAnd now I'm going to create another\nterm under Clothing Products.\n\n284\n00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:26.340\nSo you can see how we're starting\nto categorize our product catalogs.\n\n285\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.290\nSo I'll create term here, and\nthis, I'll call it denim.\n\n286\n00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.714\nIt's making these things up here.\n\n287\n00:19:34.714 --> 00:19:37.450\n[LAUGH] Let's go with,\nwe'll create a term under Denim,\n\n288\n00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.800\nlet's call it acid wash,\nI think those are back in.\n\n289\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.680\n>> I think so.\n\n290\n00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.495\n>> Everything old is new again,\njust like our parents said.\n\n291\n00:19:46.495 --> 00:19:48.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so under Denim let's go with,\n\n292\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.720\nlet's see,\nin honor of somebody here, Paisley!\n\n293\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.530\nAll right, and then let's do one\nmore just for the heck of it.\n\n294\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.426\nUnder Clothing Products let's\ngo Create Term here, and\n\n295\n00:20:03.426 --> 00:20:09.130\nlet's call it featured.\n\n296\n00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.685\nSelect featured again, Create Term,\n\n297\n00:20:13.685 --> 00:20:17.143\nlet's say Angora Sweaters,\n\n298\n00:20:19.211 --> 00:20:25.490\nJust more features to, belts.\n\n299\n00:20:30.506 --> 00:20:31.802\nCouple more.\n\n300\n00:20:31.802 --> 00:20:33.768\nDo Pants.\n\n301\n00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:36.015\nAnd Socks.\n\n302\n00:20:36.015 --> 00:20:39.664\nBusiness socks.\n\n303\n00:20:39.664 --> 00:20:44.217\n[SOUND] Yeah, okay.\n\n304\n00:20:44.217 --> 00:20:48.420\nGet rid of my little cheat sheet here\nwith the terms I whipped up earlier.\n\n305\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:53.920\nAnd now it's time to populate\nthe product catalog site.\n\n306\n00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.750\nWhich I would do if I had a script.\n\n307\n00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:01.169\nFor example I could use PowerShell\nto import an Excel spreadsheet\n\n308\n00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:02.550\nif I wanted to.\n\n309\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:08.520\nOr I could just leave as is or\nmanually populate if I wanted to.\n\n310\n00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.610\nBut the main thing I wanted to\nshow is how to create a hierarchy.\n\n311\n00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.470\nAnd now I'm gonna show you how to\nconfigure cross site publishing.\n\n312\n00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:21.646\nSo and gonna go into my catalog sites,\nlet's go back here.\n\n313\n00:21:21.646 --> 00:21:28.490\nAnd let's do this, get back there.\n\n314\n00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:34.060\nAnd anyways,\nto get back to where you once were, and\n\n315\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.159\nI'll go into Products on my\nquick launch navigation there.\n\n316\n00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.370\nAnd I'm gonna go back to my List tab\non the ribbon and then List Settings.\n\n317\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.650\nAnd I'll go under General Settings.\n\n318\n00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.990\nAnd at the bottom here\nis catalog settings.\n\n319\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.860\nThese menu options you see\nin lists in SharePoint,\n\n320\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.490\nwhether it's Central Admin, Site\nCollection Admin on these list settings,\n\n321\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.960\noften bear no relationship to reality in\nterms of being in alphabetical order or\n\n322\n00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.700\nchronological order of how\nyou'd normally do things.\n\n323\n00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.270\nI didn't code the product,\nbut what I've done before,\n\n324\n00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.050\nrather than scour through many lists,\n\n325\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.960\njust use Ctrl + F on your browser, because\nwe're working web pages, so Ctrl + F\n\n326\n00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.380\nwill help you find what you're looking for\nwithout having your eyes go all squinty.\n\n327\n00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.140\nAll right, so\nwe're into catalog settings now.\n\n328\n00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.960\nAnd this check box here is critical.\n\n329\n00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.240\nCatalog, sharing,\nenable this library as a catalog.\n\n330\n00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.090\nSo then content is listed, searchable,\nfrom other sites and site collections.\n\n331\n00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.260\nAnd other available fields here,\n\n332\n00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.590\nthen I click on Item Category.\n\n333\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.490\nAnd add, and\nthen also item number I'll add.\n\n334\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.650\nAnd scroll down to navigation hierarchy so\n\n335\n00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.180\nwhich column should categorize\nthe items for navigation?\n\n336\n00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.740\nI'll choose the item category, and OK.\n\n337\n00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:09.980\nNow I'm going to go into Advanced Settings\nand I want to re-index the list.\n\n338\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.710\nNow, this is a significant operation\ndepending on the size of what you\n\n339\n00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.860\nare re-indexing, so\nyou do get a warning about that.\n\n340\n00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.708\nI'll scroll down here and\nre-index list, and it says,\n\n341\n00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:25.564\nre-indexing may cause massive\nload on the search system\n\n342\n00:23:27.524 --> 00:23:31.070\nThey're saying, hey,\ndo you really need to re-index?\n\n343\n00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.750\nWhatever you've done may not\nneed a full re-indexing.\n\n344\n00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:37.710\nIn other words,\nthe next incremental crawl may pick it up.\n\n345\n00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.500\nOr maybe you're doing a continuous crawl,\n\n346\n00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.500\ndepending on how you set up\nyour search infrastructure.\n\n347\n00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.180\nSo just a warning there, but\nthis has so little to index,\n\n348\n00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.500\nit's not gonna be a big deal.\n\n349\n00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.796\nSo I'll say yeah, re-index it and then OK.\n\n350\n00:23:55.404 --> 00:24:00.354\nAnd now I wanna share the product\nhierarchy term set with the publishing\n\n351\n00:24:00.354 --> 00:24:01.767\nsite collections.\n\n352\n00:24:01.767 --> 00:24:05.716\nSo I'll go let's say home here.\n\n353\n00:24:05.716 --> 00:24:10.584\nI wanna manage item\nhierarchy in the Term Store.\n\n354\n00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:16.722\nAnd I'll go into my site collection,\napp sites catalog.\n\n355\n00:24:16.722 --> 00:24:22.828\nAnd now, in the site collection access,\n\n356\n00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:29.117\ndown here I want to\nenter in my staging URL.\n\n357\n00:24:29.117 --> 00:24:30.250\nSo let's type that in here.\n\n358\n00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:38.063\nIt's http app/sites/staging.\n\n359\n00:24:40.877 --> 00:24:41.996\nAnd save.\n\n360\n00:24:44.552 --> 00:24:46.090\nAnd it's time for another crawl.\n\n361\n00:24:49.034 --> 00:24:50.396\nYou know what that means?\n\n362\n00:24:50.396 --> 00:24:51.304\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n363\n00:24:51.304 --> 00:24:53.458\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, so\n\n364\n00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:54.752\nI'll manage service apps.\n\n365\n00:25:00.018 --> 00:25:02.636\nAnd then there's\nSearch Service Application, Manage.\n\n366\n00:25:07.796 --> 00:25:09.454\nAnd Content Sources.\n\n367\n00:25:21.732 --> 00:25:25.100\nAnd I'll start a full crawl.\n\n368\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.669\n>> All right.\n\n369\n00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:28.615\n>> And we see that it's starting.\n\n370\n00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.100\nThat crawl completed.\n\n371\n00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.210\nAnd now we've made the contents of\nour product catalog site available\n\n372\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.570\nto other sites so they can consume it,\nthat content, via cross-site publishing.\n\n373\n00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.130\nWe update the catalog in one place,\n\n374\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.470\nit automatically gets\nupdated everywhere else.\n\n375\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.353\nNext up is configuring publishing sites.\n\n376\n00:25:50.353 --> 00:25:53.703\nSo I'll create a publishing\nsite collection to do that.\n\n377\n00:25:53.703 --> 00:25:57.466\nI'm in central admin,\nwe'll go back to it anyway,\n\n378\n00:25:57.466 --> 00:26:02.263\nand then Create site collections\nunder Application Management.\n\n379\n00:26:02.263 --> 00:26:05.903\nCall this one staging.\n\n380\n00:26:05.903 --> 00:26:11.287\nAnd I will say, staging for\n\n381\n00:26:11.287 --> 00:26:16.684\ncross-site publishing.\n\n382\n00:26:16.684 --> 00:26:22.246\nAnd let's put it under /site/staging.\n\n383\n00:26:26.723 --> 00:26:31.432\nAnd we want, under the Publishing tab,\n\n384\n00:26:31.432 --> 00:26:35.180\nthis time a publishing portal.\n\n385\n00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.754\nAnd I'll put my user name in.\n\n386\n00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:43.910\nAnd okay.\n\n387\n00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:49.212\nAnd we see that was successful, so\nI'll click on that staging link.\n\n388\n00:26:54.022 --> 00:26:57.232\nIt says, welcome to your publishing site,\nand again, very helpful, right.\n\n389\n00:26:57.232 --> 00:27:00.369\nOn the left hand side, we've got,\nI'm the information architect.\n\n390\n00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:02.678\nAnd on the right-hand side,\nI'm the visual designer.\n\n391\n00:27:02.678 --> 00:27:07.480\nSo different people involved in SharePoint\nwould have a different interest in various\n\n392\n00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.374\nelements of the SharePoint deployment,\ndepending on your job role.\n\n393\n00:27:11.374 --> 00:27:15.179\nOkay, so now I wanna connect\nthe Publishing site to a product catalog.\n\n394\n00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:18.204\nI do that by going to Site Settings.\n\n395\n00:27:18.204 --> 00:27:23.190\nAnd under Site Administration,\nscroll down a bit here, and\n\n396\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.630\nI wanna Manage the catalog connections.\n\n397\n00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.592\nI'll click on Connect to a catalog,\nI love it when they make it so\n\n398\n00:27:31.592 --> 00:27:33.080\nobvious what the next step is.\n\n399\n00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.811\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think I'll click this one.\n\n400\n00:27:37.811 --> 00:27:39.018\nAnd let that load up.\n\n401\n00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.190\nAnd again,\nthere's only one thing to do here.\n\n402\n00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:48.660\nWe click on Connect.\n\n403\n00:27:56.154 --> 00:28:00.967\nOkay, so I do want to keep the default,\nwhich is to integrate the catalog into\n\n404\n00:28:00.967 --> 00:28:05.484\nmy site, which includes things like\ncatalog terms and navigation, and\n\n405\n00:28:05.484 --> 00:28:07.354\nany design elements as well.\n\n406\n00:28:07.354 --> 00:28:12.580\nAnd the navigation hierarchy,\nlet's scroll down a bit here,\n\n407\n00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.826\nI want to make sure item\ncategory is selected here.\n\n408\n00:28:16.826 --> 00:28:17.830\nThat's the only option,\nso that makes it easy.\n\n409\n00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.330\nAnd I'm gonna browse\nthrough a valid choice.\n\n410\n00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.876\nNow, this is one of those icons that\nif you're not familiar with it,\n\n411\n00:28:23.876 --> 00:28:27.000\nthere's these two little\ntags over here on the right.\n\n412\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.230\nBut that actually is the symbol for browse\nfor a valid choice, believe it or not.\n\n413\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:37.461\nAnd I'm gonna select a clothing product,\n\n414\n00:28:37.461 --> 00:28:40.670\nclick on Select, and OK.\n\n415\n00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.300\nThere's various other options here\nwe're not gonna get into now.\n\n416\n00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.066\nAnd I'll hit OK.\n\n417\n00:28:49.377 --> 00:28:52.646\nAnd the pièce de résistance.\n\n418\n00:28:52.646 --> 00:28:55.164\nDrum roll, please.\n\n419\n00:28:56.971 --> 00:28:57.506\n[SOUND]\n>> Sorry,\n\n420\n00:28:57.506 --> 00:28:58.925\nyou didn't mean a literal drum roll.\n\n421\n00:28:58.925 --> 00:29:00.168\n>> Absolutely, literal drum roll.\n\n422\n00:29:00.168 --> 00:29:00.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so\n\n423\n00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.860\nnow we see this quick launch\nhierarchy should look very familiar.\n\n424\n00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.900\nIt include the terms that we just\ncreated under Accessories, Denim, and\n\n425\n00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:15.880\nFeatured, and they're displayed in the way\nwe created them in terms of indentation.\n\n426\n00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.790\nSo if I click on Belts,\nfor example, what happens?\n\n427\n00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.290\nOkay, so this is something,\nwe have nothing there,\n\n428\n00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.330\nI would have had to upload actual\ninformation about one or more belts.\n\n429\n00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.785\nFurthermore, this landing page would be\nprettied up by your SharePoint designer.\n\n430\n00:29:30.785 --> 00:29:31.310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n431\n00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.810\n>> People modifying the master page,\nand making it look functional.\n\n432\n00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:39.887\nBut, this is, from our end, as our\nSharePoint admins, this is what we do.\n\n433\n00:29:39.887 --> 00:29:43.370\nAnd there'll be other people involved,\nagain, to pretty it up and\n\n434\n00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:47.049\nactually upload the various product\ncatalog items in the first place.\n\n435\n00:29:47.049 --> 00:29:48.900\n>> All right, Mark, fantastic.\n\n436\n00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:54.840\nSome really good demonstrations there\non setting up the catalog site,\n\n437\n00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.710\nthe publishing site, connecting those two,\ngetting that set up so\n\n438\n00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.840\nwe can do that cross-site publishing.\n\n439\n00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.890\nAs well as don't forget we talked a lot\nabout web content management in general,\n\n440\n00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.920\nwe talked about all the different things\nthat are available within SharePoint\n\n441\n00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.935\n2016 like a wiki, a product catalog,\n\n442\n00:30:10.935 --> 00:30:15.940\nmultilingual support, web ports, device\nplatform optimization, you know, when it\n\n443\n00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.490\ncan tell you're on a mobile device, we're\ngonna change that page up a little bit to\n\n444\n00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:24.440\nmake sure it's presented in a useful way\non whatever device you're connecting from.\n\n445\n00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.530\nSo thank you for that.\n\n446\n00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.340\nGreat demonstrations there.\n\n447\n00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.079\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n448\n00:30:29.079 --> 00:30:31.724\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike

00:00:17.590\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.200\nAnd today we're doing our\nAdvanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.520\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.190\nwe're gonna be looking at productivity and\ncollaboration,\n\n7\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.870\na couple of the key reasons we wanna\nget into SharePoint in the first place.\n\n8\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.036\nSo here to help us to figure out how\nwe can accomplish all of this is Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:33.700\nMark Ingram.\n\n10\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.367\nHow you doing Mark?\n\n11\n00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.621\n>> Good, Mike, thanks very much.\n\n12\n00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:41.040\nYes, so this isn't the end all or be all\nor end all when it comes to collaboration.\n\n13\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.236\nWe're gonna take a stab at it and we'll\nlook at to how project can integrate and\n\n14\n00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:50.804\nwith Word, PowerPoint and\nother applications we normally use, and\n\n15\n00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:55.791\nwe'll look at integrated task lists as\nwell as we go through this episode.\n\n16\n00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:58.950\nSo, if you think of\nthe average user's work day,\n\n17\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.960\nthey're probably in multiple applications,\n\n18\n00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.852\nthey're working with Exchange,\nSharePoint, various Office documents,\n\n19\n00:01:06.852 --> 00:01:11.313\nand often task lists can appear in\ndifferent software they might use.\n\n20\n00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:16.420\nSo, we wanna make life easier for users.\n\n21\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.960\nWe don't want them to have to go\nto multiple places to get multiple\n\n22\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.760\ntask lists.\n\n23\n00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.780\nNo, we want them to be able to aggregate.\n\n24\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.158\nWell, we do that in the back end.\n\n25\n00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:26.848\nAggregate tasks list, so\nthey can go to one place, or\n\n26\n00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:32.014\nany of the places they would normally\ncheck for tasks, whether it's a team\n\n27\n00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:37.017\nsite on SharePoint, or from Exchange,\nthey get the same view of tasks.\n\n28\n00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:40.060\nThere's no missing tasks, so they don't\nhave to remember to go back to this task\n\n29\n00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.958\nlist to make sure they're\ncovering everything.\n\n30\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:47.008\nNo, that's adding stress, wanna de-stress\nand we do that by a unified task list.\n\n31\n00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:51.558\nAll right,\n\n32\n00:01:51.558 --> 00:01:56.200\nso we will have a little\ndemo on that later on.\n\n33\n00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.320\nMy Sites is another place where users,\nif you enable it.\n\n34\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.340\nSo My Sites is one of those\npolarizing aspects of SharePoint.\n\n35\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.950\nSome organizations love it and\nit's a prime driver for deployment.\n\n36\n00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.840\nOther users or other organizations rather\n\n37\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.460\nstay away from it because they\nfear a total loss of control.\n\n38\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.280\nSo, I don't know, I can make arguments\neither way, but the point is,\n\n39\n00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.060\nif you do enable My Sites in your\norganization, you're essentially saying,\n\n40\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.900\nanyone with My Site's capabilities\ncan create their own site collection.\n\n41\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.110\nNow that means there's extra\nstorage to manage, and\n\n42\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.070\npeople essentially become their\nown site collection administrator.\n\n43\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.543\nSo again, I go back to training being\na fundamental driver of the success of\n\n44\n00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:42.690\na SharePoint deployment.\n\n45\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.600\nIf you have enabled My Sites,\nthat's another user where users could see\n\n46\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.440\nthis integrated task list\nfrom their My Sites page.\n\n47\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.940\n>> Very cool.\n\n48\n00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.722\n>> Yeah, okay, so again,\n\n49\n00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:59.686\nwe can connect to Exchange\nusing the OAuth protocol.\n\n50\n00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:03.824\nAnd that involves setting up trust\nrelationships, between Exchange and\n\n51\n00:03:03.824 --> 00:03:04.638\nSharePoint.\n\n52\n00:03:04.638 --> 00:03:08.899\nI won't show you that but\nthat's something you'll need to do if you\n\n53\n00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:12.734\nwant to enable that task list\nintegration within Exchange.\n\n54\n00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.877\nAnd there's a variety of\nPowerShell scripts to run.\n\n55\n00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:19.127\nSo again,\nI've mentioned this several times.\n\n56\n00:03:19.127 --> 00:03:23.651\nIf you don't have PowerShell skills now,\nI'm not saying you have to become\n\n57\n00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:28.335\na PowerShell expert, but there are certain\ntasks you can only do in the shell.\n\n58\n00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:32.740\nWhether you're talking about Exchange,\nProject, SharePoint.\n\n59\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.710\nAny major server technology, all server\ntechnologies Microsoft's released\n\n60\n00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.470\nsince Exchange 2007 require\nPowerShell to administer some or\n\n61\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.700\nmany activities or options you\ncan configure in those platforms.\n\n62\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.157\nSo, don't be afraid,\nmaybe add that to your learning list,\n\n63\n00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:51.060\nPowerShell if you're new.\n\n64\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.140\nI don't consider myself a coder or\na scripter.\n\n65\n00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.960\nEven I found it fairly intuitive to\nlearn and lots of built-in help.\n\n66\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.990\nSo, using actual English words.\n\n67\n00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.290\nSo it's designed to take\nthe best of other shells and\n\n68\n00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.390\nmake it easy for new people that don't\nhave experience coding, for example,\n\n69\n00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.220\nto quickly ramp up and\nbe able to create their own scripts and\n\n70\n00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.800\nmodify scripts available online or from\nexamples for use in your own environment.\n\n71\n00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.810\n>> So,\nit's really not as bad as people think.\n\n72\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.511\nI think it's something that, as you said,\n\n73\n00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:28.120\nyou're gonna need it in just about any\nfield with a server that you go into.\n\n74\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.800\nSo, you might as well start\nplaying around with it.\n\n75\n00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.755\n>> Indeed, so when it comes to Project,\nthere's multiple levels of integration.\n\n76\n00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:39.805\nI'll show you how to set up\na Project site and set up some of\n\n77\n00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:44.275\nthe functionality there, and\nwe'll create a little scenario in Project.\n\n78\n00:04:44.275 --> 00:04:48.094\nWe could also in SharePoint 2016,\nwith the right licensing key,\n\n79\n00:04:48.094 --> 00:04:49.656\nenable the functionality.\n\n80\n00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:53.581\nSo Project is installed with\nSharePoint in 2016 and you need, again,\n\n81\n00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:56.836\nthe right key to unlock\nthe functionality of Project server.\n\n82\n00:04:56.836 --> 00:04:58.654\nBut it's not an all or\nnothing proposition.\n\n83\n00:04:58.654 --> 00:05:00.624\nYou don't have to spring for\n\n84\n00:05:00.624 --> 00:05:06.351\nthat Project server license to take\nadvantage of a Project site template.\n\n85\n00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:08.925\n>> And so you can dip your toe in.\n\n86\n00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:12.520\nAnd then if you're not integrating\nProject with SharePoint now,\n\n87\n00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.563\nby using some Project sites,\nyou might realize, hey, this makes sense,\n\n88\n00:05:16.563 --> 00:05:20.544\nlet's either port over from another\nProject solution we're using now or\n\n89\n00:05:20.544 --> 00:05:25.190\nlet's go full bore with our integration\nwith Project server and SharePoint server.\n\n90\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.796\nIt makes sense because you want maximize\nthe amount of interfaces users have to\n\n91\n00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.696\ngo to to do their work day to day.\n\n92\n00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:33.669\nAnd because they're\nMicrosoft technologies,\n\n93\n00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.650\nyou can expect them to\nplay nice with each other.\n\n94\n00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:42.130\nAnd users generally are familiar with\nOffice, apps, and how to use a ribbon.\n\n95\n00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.095\nSince Office, several versions ago now.\n\n96\n00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:47.100\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n97\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.040\n>> 2010, I believe it was.\n\n98\n00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.820\nI lost track, maybe 2007, but\nribbon's been around for years.\n\n99\n00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.330\nAnd anyone that's familiar with a browser.\n\n100\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.270\nSo with basic Office and\nbrowser skills, people can have a good\n\n101\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.250\nexperience working with SharePoint and\nProject together in a 2016 environment.\n\n102\n00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.291\nOkay, so Project site template includes,\nlike all templates,\n\n103\n00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:10.019\na variety of web parts.\n\n104\n00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:14.921\nAnd we have a Project summary web part,\ntask schedule,\n\n105\n00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:19.525\neven a OneNote team notebook and\na shared calendar.\n\n106\n00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:25.000\nSo you can customize that site just\nlike any site template in SharePoint.\n\n107\n00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.310\nYou can certainly change the branding to\nbe inline with your corporate colors,\n\n108\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.850\nfor example.\n\n109\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.470\nAnd you may have some\ncustom web parts that you\n\n110\n00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.160\nuse to access different databases.\n\n111\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.585\nThat's the beauty of SharePoint, you can\nmodify, customize to your heart's content.\n\n112\n00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:42.878\nSo you can bring in data that displays\nin a dashboard like environment so that,\n\n113\n00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:47.172\nagain, we're restricting the amount of\ntrips users have to take to different\n\n114\n00:06:47.172 --> 00:06:49.646\ninterfaces, portals, applications, and\n\n115\n00:06:49.646 --> 00:06:54.160\nwe can consolidate a lot of the work in\none interface, which is extremely useful.\n\n116\n00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.098\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n117\n00:06:56.098 --> 00:06:56.954\n>> Okay.\n\n118\n00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:05.333\nThere's also, you can utilize what\nused to be called Office Web Apps and\n\n119\n00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:08.040\nnow is Office Online Server.\n\n120\n00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.670\nDon't be confused by the name, Online\nServer, it's not like SharePoint Online,\n\n121\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.780\nin other words,\nit's not a cloud-hosted service.\n\n122\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.663\nIt's something that's, you install in\nyour environment and it allows for\n\n123\n00:07:18.663 --> 00:07:19.883\nextra functionality.\n\n124\n00:07:19.883 --> 00:07:25.768\nSo if you're familiar with Office Web Apps\nfrom 2013, the principles are the same,\n\n125\n00:07:25.768 --> 00:07:30.161\nit's a very similar experience,\nit's just that Microsoft seems\n\n126\n00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:34.877\nto like to rebrand technologies that\nwe've come to know and remember.\n\n127\n00:07:34.877 --> 00:07:36.477\nAnd then the next version, it's changed.\n\n128\n00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:39.824\nAnd we think, it's a brand new technology,\nbut not always the case.\n\n129\n00:07:39.824 --> 00:07:42.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sometimes just marketing, branding.\n\n130\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.808\n>> Yes.\n>> So Office Web Apps,\n\n131\n00:07:43.808 --> 00:07:46.497\nalmost identical to Office Online Server.\n\n132\n00:07:46.497 --> 00:07:50.328\nAnd again, that's something\nthat runs in your enterprise.\n\n133\n00:07:50.328 --> 00:07:54.575\nSo why would someone install\nOffice Online Server?\n\n134\n00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:55.467\nWhat's the benefit?\n\n135\n00:07:55.467 --> 00:07:56.587\nYou don't have to install it.\n\n136\n00:07:56.587 --> 00:07:57.649\nIt's definitely optional.\n\n137\n00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:02.141\nYou can still take great advantage of\nDocument libraries, and then working on\n\n138\n00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:06.990\ndocuments, versioning, but you get change\ntracking, so you get revision marks.\n\n139\n00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.950\nIf you've ever collaborated with others\non a document and there's some kind of\n\n140\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.770\nmarkup, maybe you use some other software\nfor that, and then you can see comments,\n\n141\n00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.340\ntypically in the margin, just someone\nhas written in the body of the document.\n\n142\n00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.170\nSo you can see who made what comment, or\n\n143\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.530\nwhat change, you know strike through\non a certain sentence or word perhaps.\n\n144\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.435\nSo you get change tracking if you\ninstall Office Online Server and\n\n145\n00:08:30.435 --> 00:08:34.200\nco-authoring is available as well, so\nwe can get multiple people working on\n\n146\n00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.380\nthe document say, or\nPowerPoint deck at the very same time.\n\n147\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:44.710\nAnd you can imagine without, it could turn\ninto a gong show, but they've setup so\n\n148\n00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.510\nthat it's very plain which user's working\non which section of the document.\n\n149\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.400\nSo you're not fumbling over or overwriting\nchanges that your colleague just made\n\n150\n00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.646\nthen it leads to frustration, and\nmaybe a thrown doughnut or two.\n\n151\n00:08:56.646 --> 00:09:00.465\n>> [LAUGH] Or however you take out\nyour stress, maybe a Nerf gun.\n\n152\n00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:02.245\n>> A Nerf gun.\n\n153\n00:09:02.245 --> 00:09:06.460\n>> Ink, ink support as well, so\ndigital ink is kind of a cool thing,\n\n154\n00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.690\nso-called corridor warriors would use\nthat maybe in OneNote with a convertible\n\n155\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.295\ntwo-in-one tablet type arrangement,\nwhere you can\n\n156\n00:09:14.295 --> 00:09:18.570\nuse digital ink to actually write on\n>> The document for example.\n\n157\n00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.580\nWhich, by the way, you can do that\nin the Edge browser now as well,\n\n158\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.400\nwhich is one of the selling features for\nEdge.\n\n159\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.010\nI'm not fully a fan frankly, I find\ncertain sites just don't function as they\n\n160\n00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.070\nwould in IE or other browsers, but\nthat is one compelling feature of Edge,\n\n161\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.670\nthat you can write on the web page,\nwhich is cool.\n\n162\n00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.560\nAnd so if you take my recommendation and\ninstall Office Online Server,\n\n163\n00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.590\nthere are a couple licensing options.\n\n164\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:50.650\nView Only is one and the second licensing\nlittle more expensive is Edit and View.\n\n165\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.760\nWhich makes sense, you want to be able to\ncollaborate but there's a cost for that.\n\n166\n00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.610\nAnother cool thing.\n\n167\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.670\nLet's say you're, I always like\nto use the 100 year old law firm.\n\n168\n00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.490\nYou've got massive amount of documents.\n\n169\n00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.360\nWhatever we can do to make it easier for\nyou just to search or\n\n170\n00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.020\nbetter yet, filter down or\nnarrow down the search is a good thing.\n\n171\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.110\nBecause I don't know about you, but\nwhen I'm searching often whatever search\n\n172\n00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.690\nphrase I use, doesn't matter what\nsearch engine I'm talking about,\n\n173\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.945\nSharePoint or Online search engine's.\n\n174\n00:10:19.945 --> 00:10:22.005\nOften the first the set\nof results were turned,\n\n175\n00:10:22.005 --> 00:10:26.725\nI realized [LAUGH] there's still\n300,000 I'm not going to wave through.\n\n176\n00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:32.955\nSo, we often refine our searches after\nthe results are displayed the first time.\n\n177\n00:10:32.955 --> 00:10:35.645\nWe realize yeah, if I could have\nbeen a little more specific here, or\n\n178\n00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:39.270\nmaybe include a data or\nsome other parameter and narrow down.\n\n179\n00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.900\nSo, to help users quickly narrow\ndown what they're looking for,\n\n180\n00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.080\nwe have search preview capabilities\nwith Office Online Server,\n\n181\n00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.240\nwhich means the user can just\nhover over a search result and\n\n182\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.060\nsee the first page of that document,\nfor example, or PowerPoint Deck.\n\n183\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.840\nAnd that is a much faster way of narrowing\ndown, as opposed to having to open\n\n184\n00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.530\nthe word doc or PowerPoint deck just to\nfigure out, no that's not exactly what I'm\n\n185\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.580\nlooking for, then you close it and\nmaybe have to open another one.\n\n186\n00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.920\nSo it's, by having that little preview,\nthat little thumbnail\n\n187\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.300\nthat opens up a little bigger,\nwe can without having to open the document\n\n188\n00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.160\nit lets us get to the information\nwe're looking for that much faster.\n\n189\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.500\nAnd that works for\nboth photos and videos well,\n\n190\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.370\nthumbnails from videos as well\nas other kinds of office docs.\n\n191\n00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.770\nOkay, so we have a couple of other\nimprovements it's well off that line\n\n192\n00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.800\nserver that you don't get otherwise.\n\n193\n00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.370\nWe have Mobile Viewers available for\nExcel, and\n\n194\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.710\nword and also a PowerPoint attendee view,\n\n195\n00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:48.400\nthis means a PowerPoint's presenter\ncan broadcast slide presentations.\n\n196\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.550\nNow having said that those last three\nthings I mentioned, the excel and\n\n197\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.970\nword mobile view and\nthe PowerPoint attendee view\n\n198\n00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.910\nthat kind of functionality is available\nfrom the app store now, because Apple and\n\n199\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.410\nGoogle, Microsoft is really\nkeen on having the app.\n\n200\n00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.250\nSo often times there\nare very convenient and\n\n201\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.370\nfree viewers available that\nwould accomplish the same thing.\n\n202\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.250\nOkay, so, in terms of authentication, you\nhave to use claims based authentication\n\n203\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.830\nwhich would you're almost certainly\nusing claims-based authentication.\n\n204\n00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:23.710\nIf for some reason you're still using\nthe old classic mode authentication,\n\n205\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.075\nyou're gonna have to upgrade, if you will,\nor change the authentication type to\n\n206\n00:12:28.075 --> 00:12:30.560\nclaims-based before you can\nuse the Office Online Server.\n\n207\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:37.030\nAnd make sure you have proper licensing if\nyou want to allow users to edit documents\n\n208\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.310\nvia Office Online Server or\ncollaborate and edit at the same time.\n\n209\n00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.410\nOkay, now there's something called\n\n210\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.850\nWord Automation Services we should talk\nabout as well, and this is a way of\n\n211\n00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:56.890\nconverting formats of various\ndocuments into Microsoft Word format.\n\n212\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:02.110\nAnd this technology came out back in\nthe SharePoint 2010 era works for\n\n213\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.610\nthings Open XML file format.\n\n214\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.420\nSo docx, docm, dotx,\n\n215\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.690\ndotm, even back to Word 97 and\n2003 documents.\n\n216\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.590\nSome people just refuse to\nupgrade their Office suites,\n\n217\n00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.770\nunbelievable, sometimes going around.\n\n218\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.150\nYou know and sometimes there's\na legitimate reason why someone's running\n\n219\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.000\na 2003 version of Office.\n\n220\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.770\nSome customization that they maybe got\nfrom a vendor or maybe they have a plan.\n\n221\n00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:33.210\nI heard a story about NASA where they\nstick with technology for 10 years.\n\n222\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.310\nAnd so once things have been tested\nthey have a x number of years lifespan,\n\n223\n00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.990\ndoesn't matter what the latest and\ngreatest technology is.\n\n224\n00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.620\nThey've tested the software to work\nwith the hardware, and when you're\n\n225\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.790\nshooting satellites and people up in space\nI guess you do want that consistency.\n\n226\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:51.410\nYou don't want to sort of beta\ntest this satellite launch.\n\n227\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.068\nWe'll try it out.\n\n228\n00:13:52.068 --> 00:13:53.311\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What's\n\n229\n00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:55.230\nthe worst thing that could happen?\n\n230\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.670\n>> I'm sure the astronauts\nappreciate that.\n\n231\n00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:57.205\n>> Yes.\n\n232\n00:13:57.205 --> 00:13:58.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Indeed.\n\n233\n00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.500\n>> What else can we convert\na single file web pages so\n\n234\n00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.300\nthey\n>> If you've ever saved,\n\n235\n00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.860\nmaybe you're on a website, and\nyou want to save the site,\n\n236\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.930\nyou can save it in a single file,\nthat's the MHT, or the MHTML format.\n\n237\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.550\nThose can be converted into Word as well.\n\n238\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.270\nYou might have a Word XML document,\nan XML format also can be converted.\n\n239\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.160\nOkay, so, this used to be done\non the web front end server,\n\n240\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.429\nwhich put quite a load on the web server,\nand so\n\n241\n00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:33.920\nnow we can, the more efficient\nway of converting documents.\n\n242\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.960\nSo we can schedule when documents get\nconverted and maybe X number of hours for\n\n243\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.980\nX minutes an hour,\nwe can have that conversion process going.\n\n244\n00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.290\nAnd again that the company's been\nin business for a long time.\n\n245\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.700\nA lot of Word documents or\n\n246\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.490\nother file types want to be\nable to convert into Word.\n\n247\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.250\nThis could take months theoretically,\nor years depending\n\n248\n00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.342\non what the priority was to convert those\ndocuments into a Word readable format.\n\n249\n00:14:56.342 --> 00:15:02.110\nAll right, so,\n\n250\n00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:08.050\nin terms of Co-authoring we've got a Word,\nPowerpoint, Excel capabilities and\n\n251\n00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:13.350\nagain, users working on the docs will get\nnotified or changes made by the users in\n\n252\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:19.070\nreal time, and\nOne Note we can utilise as well.\n\n253\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:27.040\nAnd One Note's a little different,\nwe get near real time co-authoring.\n\n254\n00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.040\nSo, in terms of planning for co-authoring,\n\n255\n00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.010\nthat could be quite a shift in\nprocess if you're an organisation that\n\n256\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:36.520\ndoesn't allow for co-authoring, there's\nfactors to consider before enabling it.\n\n257\n00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.340\nMaybe you wanna try it out on a document\nlibrary worth of content at once or for\n\n258\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.510\na certain department,\nrather than just enable it for everybody.\n\n259\n00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.500\nBecause it could cause confusion\nif you're used to again,\n\n260\n00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.720\nnot collaborative that way, right?\n\n261\n00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.706\n>> Yeah, you're working on a document.\n\n262\n00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:52.143\nAll of a sudden, you start seeing\nchanges from other people.\n\n263\n00:15:52.143 --> 00:15:53.747\nThat could throw a user for\na loop a little bit.\n\n264\n00:15:53.747 --> 00:15:55.930\n>> Absolutely, who's doing this?\n\n265\n00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:56.746\n>> Yes.\n\n266\n00:15:56.746 --> 00:15:57.979\nBan them.\n\n267\n00:15:57.979 --> 00:15:59.012\n>> A ghost in the machine.\n\n268\n00:15:59.012 --> 00:16:00.273\n>> Indeed.\n\n269\n00:16:00.273 --> 00:16:02.770\nOkay, so permissions.\n\n270\n00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.370\nUsers obviously need permissions to\nthe document to be able to coauthor,\n\n271\n00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.550\nedit permissions.\n\n272\n00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:13.270\nNow, versioning is a concern because,\n\n273\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.100\nwith all the changes that could get made\nwith users collaborating on a document,\n\n274\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.440\nthat could translate to\na large number of versions.\n\n275\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:27.580\nSo, you could, again, the preference would\nbe to, in a document library setting,\n\n276\n00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.270\nbecause versions are document library\nspecific settings, you could,\n\n277\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:36.170\nrather than just allow unlimited versions\nset a maximum number of major versions.\n\n278\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.948\nFor example, 10.\n\n279\n00:16:37.948 --> 00:16:45.280\nAnd then as many associated minor versions\nwith each major version as necessary.\n\n280\n00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.130\nSo in other words, if you say 10 major\nversions kept, if you're up to version 11,\n\n281\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.270\nversion one is deleted.\n\n282\n00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.960\nNow, you may be able to\nretrieve it from a backup, but\n\n283\n00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.250\nthat's a whole other scenario there.\n\n284\n00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.565\nYou can also create\na versioning period for\n\n285\n00:16:58.565 --> 00:17:04.120\nco-authored documents, and\nalso a maximum number of co-authors.\n\n286\n00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.080\nSo this way, as an admin or at least,\nthis is something that could\n\n287\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.840\ncertainly be handled at the site\ncollection admin level.\n\n288\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.340\nThis way,\nthey have some control over, again,\n\n289\n00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.869\nmaximum number of co-authors, maximum\nnumber of versions, versioning period.\n\n290\n00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:23.370\nAnd something I would start on\na department by department basis,\n\n291\n00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:27.640\nget sort of lessons learned from the first\ndepartment working on the co-authoring,\n\n292\n00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.280\nand then you can make some policies or\nguidelines that would apply to other site\n\n293\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:38.100\ncollection administrators that were also\ntold to implement this co-authoring.\n\n294\n00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.950\nAnd again, I keep saying governance is\nkey because, while a site collection\n\n295\n00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.680\nadministration can easily enable this\nfunctionality, leaving it up to that\n\n296\n00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.670\nsite collection administrator to\ndecide is not a best practice.\n\n297\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.850\nBecause there may be business logic or\nbusiness rules that dictate no,\n\n298\n00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.970\nwe're not gonna allow co-authoring.\n\n299\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:00.590\nMaybe it's in privacy concerns, or\nclassified information confidentiality.\n\n300\n00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:06.490\nThose concerns may exclude\ncoauthoring from your environment.\n\n301\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:12.500\nSo, again, as admins we can implement\nwhat we're told to implement,\n\n302\n00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.431\nbut we shouldn't necessarily be\ndeciding these governance issues.\n\n303\n00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:19.620\nWe can be perhaps on\na committee that decides, but\n\n304\n00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.870\nultimately it's a business decision and\nwe should just implement and not be\n\n305\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.210\nthe governors, if you will, of the site\ncollection that we're responsible for.\n\n306\n00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.490\nNow, I'll show you how to\nconfigure project sites.\n\n307\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:37.590\nSo, to do that, I'm gonna set up\na managed path from my web app first.\n\n308\n00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:43.100\nSo, I'm in central admin, and\nI'm gonna go into manage web applications.\n\n309\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:49.460\nAnd I'll choose my SharePoint web app.\n\n310\n00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:54.860\nAnd I click on managed\npaths in the ribbon,\n\n311\n00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.350\nand the paths will be known as projects.\n\n312\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.770\nAnd I want a wild card inclusion,\nwhich is the default.\n\n313\n00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.630\nThe other option would be\nan explicit inclusion.\n\n314\n00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:08.030\nIn other words, that would be\nthe only site collection in the path.\n\n315\n00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.910\nBut wild card means I can\nhave any number beneath it.\n\n316\n00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.459\nSo I click on Add Path.\n\n317\n00:19:17.035 --> 00:19:20.770\nAnd we can see there that the Manage Paths\nshows up at the bottom of the list up top.\n\n318\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.100\nSo we see projects, and\nit's a wild card inclusion manage path.\n\n319\n00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.560\nAnd OK.\n\n320\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.159\nNow, I'll create a site collection.\n\n321\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.255\nSo to do that, I'll go back to Application\nManagement, and Create Site Collections.\n\n322\n00:19:38.747 --> 00:19:40.930\nMaking sure I use the right web app,\nyes I am.\n\n323\n00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:50.610\nAnd let's call this one Project Runway.\n\n324\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.133\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n325\n00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:55.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I don't watch the show.\n\n326\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.710\nI'm not kidding.\n\n327\n00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.850\nAll right.\n\n328\n00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.610\nSo, now I'll choose the managed\npath I just created,\n\n329\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.840\nwhich happens to be projects.\n\n330\n00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.810\nAnd because there's a wild card managed\npath, I can create beyond that URL.\n\n331\n00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.110\nAnd I'm gonna call this P1.\n\n332\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.650\nKeep it simple.\n\n333\n00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.710\nYou also wanna,\nI've talked about intelligent naming,\n\n334\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.700\nyou don't want to get wordy because\nit all adds to the URL length and\n\n335\n00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.120\nyou've got a 254 character maximum.\n\n336\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.190\nBut at the same time, you don't want\nto get so acronymy, if that's a word,\n\n337\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.910\nthat nobody can understand,\nit doesn't make sense, right?\n\n338\n00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.910\nBut P1, I mean, for\nthis purpose, that's good enough.\n\n339\n00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:35.720\nNow, the template.\n\n340\n00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.394\nWhoops, scrolling the right way.\n\n341\n00:20:40.394 --> 00:20:43.210\nAll right.\nSo, on the default collaboration tab,\n\n342\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.930\nthis is where I'm gonna choose\nthe project site templates.\n\n343\n00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.227\nAnd the familiar administrator.\n\n344\n00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:55.303\nResolve the squiggly name there.\n\n345\n00:20:55.303 --> 00:21:01.043\nAnd Hit OK.\n\n346\n00:21:01.043 --> 00:21:01.887\nSo that completed.\n\n347\n00:21:01.887 --> 00:21:05.160\nNow, I'll click the link\nto the new site collection.\n\n348\n00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.840\nAll right, so here's our project site.\n\n349\n00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.090\nNotice how we have web parts you're\nprobably not familiar with and\n\n350\n00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.970\nsome that you are.\n\n351\n00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.840\nSo, our project summary\nhere with a timeline that's\n\n352\n00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.930\nspecific to the project template.\n\n353\n00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.100\nType, the get started.\n\n354\n00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.710\nThat's quite common on\na variety of template types.\n\n355\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.300\nAnd a little documents part here and\na news feed.\n\n356\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.558\nAnd the ability to, well,\nit's pretty quiet here.\n\n357\n00:21:29.558 --> 00:21:31.251\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:21:31.251 --> 00:21:33.860\n>> Some pretty funny things Microsoft,\n\n359\n00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.450\nwell, more friendly Microsoft\nin the last few years.\n\n360\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.670\nUser friendly.\n\n361\n00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.720\n>> But it is a site that's\nreally geared towards a project.\n\n362\n00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.260\nIt's already got all of the web\nparts as you would maybe use\n\n363\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.140\nwhen setting up a site\nto support a project.\n\n364\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.130\n>> Yeah, if you're a purist there's\nnothing saying you can't start with\n\n365\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.850\na blank site and add your own parts and\ncreate your own template from scratch.\n\n366\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.630\nBut why bother when it's already done for\nyou?\n\n367\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.978\nSo let's get on with it.\n\n368\n00:21:56.978 --> 00:21:57.538\nAll right.\n\n369\n00:21:57.538 --> 00:22:02.260\nSo, the first thing we do is edit the task\nlist under, it says get organized.\n\n370\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.420\nI agree.\n\n371\n00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:10.250\nEdit, let's call this one, so\nyou can see there's a line there for\n\n372\n00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.670\na task, and I can add an unlimited\nnumber of tasks there.\n\n373\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:18.520\nLet's call this one product design.\n\n374\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:25.170\nAnd let's do a due date which will be,\n\n375\n00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.560\nlet's see,\nthere's little calendar object here.\n\n376\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.956\nLet's say in a week.\n\n377\n00:22:32.193 --> 00:22:35.511\nSo, and then I'll assign it to,\nactually, you know what,\n\n378\n00:22:35.511 --> 00:22:38.324\nI'm gonna create a new user here for\nthis purpose.\n\n379\n00:22:40.434 --> 00:22:41.954\nOver on my DC.\n\n380\n00:22:49.485 --> 00:22:59.407\nAnd\n>> Active Directory administrative center.\n\n381\n00:22:59.407 --> 00:23:02.406\n>> Let's switch it up\n>> A little active directory users and\n\n382\n00:23:02.406 --> 00:23:02.933\ncomputers.\n\n383\n00:23:02.933 --> 00:23:04.217\n>> Let's go old school.\n\n384\n00:23:04.217 --> 00:23:05.130\n>> My favorite.\n\n385\n00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:09.967\n>> ADOC, yeah.\n\n386\n00:23:09.967 --> 00:23:13.520\nOkay, so let's, new user.\n\n387\n00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.912\nLets go with Kim.\n\n388\n00:23:18.634 --> 00:23:19.822\nSmith.\n\n389\n00:23:25.964 --> 00:23:30.835\nKim, I like to use those\nsort of androgynous names.\n\n390\n00:23:30.835 --> 00:23:31.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not sure that's\n\n391\n00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.380\nthe right word, actually.\n\n392\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.825\nBut Saturday Night Live skit,\n>> [LAUGH] Cuz that's what I was doing.\n\n393\n00:23:37.825 --> 00:23:40.177\n>> [LAUGH] Pat.\n\n394\n00:23:40.177 --> 00:23:42.090\nOkay,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n395\n00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.160\n>> Can we joke about that?\n\n396\n00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.870\nI think we can.\n\n397\n00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.480\n>> I think we can, it's legit.\n\n398\n00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.670\n>> All right, without offending anybody?\n\n399\n00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.134\nWe'll see.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:23:49.134 --> 00:23:50.905\n>> Let me check the Twitter feed.\n\n401\n00:23:50.905 --> 00:23:52.586\nOkay, now, it's assigned Kim.\n\n402\n00:23:52.586 --> 00:23:57.410\nAnd this is cool because I start typing\nand I just added the user right away It's\n\n403\n00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:01.794\navailable to pick in this list here\nthat matches kim, so that's good,\n\n404\n00:24:01.794 --> 00:24:05.990\nthat wasn't always true often there\nwould have to be some syncing.\n\n405\n00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.600\n>> Right.\n\n406\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.540\n>> Or it would take a while for\n\n407\n00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.570\nnew objects created in active directory\nto populate where you wanted them to.\n\n408\n00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.320\n>> Yeah.\n\n409\n00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.510\n>> So kudos to Microsoft on that one.\n\n410\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.660\nAnd now.\n\n411\n00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.948\nI'm gonna click on task name\nhere under product design.\n\n412\n00:24:19.948 --> 00:24:26.270\nAnd just funny,\nmore friendly this Microsoft.\n\n413\n00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.280\nThe first one's on us.\n\n414\n00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.850\nAll they're really doing for\nus is adding a task to the timeline,\n\n415\n00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.660\notherwise I'd have to go to that ellipsis\nmenu and add a task, so thanks for that.\n\n416\n00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:42.340\nThat's asking for a little too\nmuch credit I think but anyway.\n\n417\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.770\nSo now we have an ellipsis\nnext to product design.\n\n418\n00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:49.400\nAnd remember,\nI didn't code the product but\n\n419\n00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.150\nnow there's another ellipsis and\nthe plural is ellipses.\n\n420\n00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.230\nWe have two ellipses here.\n\n421\n00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.010\nAgain, it's optimized for touch, right,\n\n422\n00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.615\nbecause a lot of people will be using some\ntouch screen to configure SharePoint.\n\n423\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.620\nSo I guess I can't really complain,\nit's easy to, it's almost like braille,\n\n424\n00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.210\njust to find those three dots.\n\n425\n00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.780\n>> Yes.\n>> So\n\n426\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:14.580\nI'm gonna click on the second set of\nellipsis here and click on edit item.\n\n427\n00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.368\nAnd for the start date,\n\n428\n00:25:20.368 --> 00:25:24.942\nI'm gonna say today and save and\n\n429\n00:25:24.942 --> 00:25:29.686\nnow I'll click the task name here\n\n430\n00:25:29.686 --> 00:25:34.610\nI'm gonna go, proof of concept.\n\n431\n00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.159\nIt's always good to have a POC.\n\n432\n00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:37.089\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n433\n00:25:37.089 --> 00:25:41.702\n>> And I'll go to the due date, and\nlet's say, it's a tight timeline here,\n\n434\n00:25:41.702 --> 00:25:45.450\nour time is precious,\nwe're gonna give two weeks for that.\n\n435\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.085\nAnd I'll sign to administrator.\n\n436\n00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:54.575\nExcellent.\n\n437\n00:25:54.575 --> 00:25:56.640\nAnd I'll go into task name again.\n\n438\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:04.130\nAnd then the ellipsis next as proof\nof concept, and add to timeline.\n\n439\n00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.720\nHow Exciting.\n\n440\n00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.906\n[SOUND] Yeah, so we can see there,\nproduct design, and\n\n441\n00:26:08.906 --> 00:26:14.098\nnext to proof of concept you're\ngonna click on the ellipsis again.\n\n442\n00:26:14.098 --> 00:26:18.898\nAnd the other ellipsis and edit item, and\n\n443\n00:26:18.898 --> 00:26:21.915\nstart date, let's say,\n\n444\n00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:27.283\nI'm feeling cruel, I'll make it a holiday.\n\n445\n00:26:27.283 --> 00:26:32.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And save.\n\n446\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:32.870\nThe new guy.\n\n447\n00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.820\nIt gets something-\n>> It's terrible.\n\n448\n00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.287\nTerrible.\n[LAUGH]\n\n449\n00:26:36.287 --> 00:26:37.987\n>> Horrible bosses.\n\n450\n00:26:37.987 --> 00:26:38.531\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n451\n00:26:38.531 --> 00:26:39.623\n>> All right now,\n\n452\n00:26:39.623 --> 00:26:44.747\nit can be a little confusing frankly\nwith this interface with the color,\n\n453\n00:26:44.747 --> 00:26:50.470\nis the blue and the gray, but at least\nthey make it clear that it's a hyperlink.\n\n454\n00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:55.600\nI want to stop editing this less so\nI'll gonna click on the stop,\n\n455\n00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.174\nword there, and\nnow I'm going to click on the home link.\n\n456\n00:27:00.174 --> 00:27:03.797\nAnd now we can see the overlap here\nbecause often in projects there's some\n\n457\n00:27:03.797 --> 00:27:05.844\nactivities that happen concurrently and\n\n458\n00:27:05.844 --> 00:27:08.950\nsome have to happen only after\nthe previous one's completed.\n\n459\n00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:12.078\nSo there's some overlap here we\nsee between product design and\n\n460\n00:27:12.078 --> 00:27:13.030\nproof of concept.\n\n461\n00:27:14.188 --> 00:27:19.300\nAnd now I'm going to add a task,\nand this is up on the right,\n\n462\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.885\nagain, when I talk about moving between\nversions, not only often do you have to\n\n463\n00:27:22.885 --> 00:27:26.350\noften unlearn the old name for\nsomething like Office web apps, and\n\n464\n00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.010\nthe new name Office Online Server,\nalso, the things you are used to doing,\n\n465\n00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.099\nthe menu options, and\nwhere the buttons were, move around.\n\n466\n00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.790\nSo, you know it used to be over here,\nnow it's over here,\n\n467\n00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:41.400\nso that's I guess these are first world\nproblems, but anyway the point is we\n\n468\n00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:46.570\nare gonna add a task, and\nthe task will be kick off meeting.\n\n469\n00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:55.290\nAnd lets make this today,\nlets strike while the iron it hot.\n\n470\n00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.908\nAnd let's go to due date.\n\n471\n00:27:58.908 --> 00:28:03.549\nI'll make this today as well, cuz nothing\nworse than meetings that drag on over one\n\n472\n00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:07.850\nday, so I think one day is plenty,\nand we need to assign this now.\n\n473\n00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.661\nSo I can assign it to a person if I want.\n\n474\n00:28:10.661 --> 00:28:15.790\nLet's say kim again or\n\n475\n00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.940\nit could be to a group if I wanted and\nthen save.\n\n476\n00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:26.380\nNow, again when we get a template\nin SharePoint it's a suggested\n\n477\n00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.640\narrangement of web parts and a certain\nlook and feel based on the master page for\n\n478\n00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.500\nexample, it's totally customizable,\nwe're not stuck with what we've got.\n\n479\n00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.730\nSo let's customize a little bit.\n\n480\n00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:35.690\n>> Let's do.\n\n481\n00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.510\n>> Yeah.\nSo I am going to the proof of concept\n\n482\n00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:43.890\ntask, and\n\n483\n00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:48.110\non the timeline,\nyou can just click on display as call out.\n\n484\n00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.230\nThat's in the current selections there.\n\n485\n00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:56.280\nAgain, very useful to hover\nover the item in the ribbon.\n\n486\n00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.240\nAnd then if you are not exactly\nsure what the item does,\n\n487\n00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.700\nyou get some guidance there.\n\n488\n00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.890\nSo display as call out, and\nnow I'm gonna go into settings,\n\n489\n00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:07.470\nthat's the gear icon, and edit the page.\n\n490\n00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.120\nAnd I'm gonna go down to the get\nstarted with your site web part.\n\n491\n00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.705\nNow, this is often the,\nyou notice when I move my mouse up there\n\n492\n00:29:19.705 --> 00:29:25.390\naway from get started with your site,\nthe web part menu drop down disappears so\n\n493\n00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.600\nit's kind of like you hover and\nthe menu will appear.\n\n494\n00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.155\nField of dreams, web part of dreams.\n\n495\n00:29:31.155 --> 00:29:31.932\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay so\n\n496\n00:29:31.932 --> 00:29:35.550\nthen I can click the down arrow and\nI want to delete this web part,\n\n497\n00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.766\nthis is a generic,\nget started with your site web part and\n\n498\n00:29:38.766 --> 00:29:42.921\nI don't need any of these, sort of,\ntraining wheel prompts if you will.\n\n499\n00:29:42.921 --> 00:29:46.700\nSo I'm going to delete the web part and,\nare you sure?\n\n500\n00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.840\nSure, I'm sure.\n\n501\n00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.180\nNow, I got rid of that one and\nI wanna add a web part.\n\n502\n00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.092\nSo, how do I do that?\n\n503\n00:29:52.092 --> 00:29:56.890\nI'm gonna go,\nnotice that we have panels or zones and so\n\n504\n00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.160\nwe want to make sure we're selecting the\nweb part in the correct area of the page.\n\n505\n00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.200\nWe can always move it later, but\n\n506\n00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.820\nwhy not put it where you\nwant it in the first place?\n\n507\n00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:09.790\nSo I'll click on add a web part,\nand notice how we\n\n508\n00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:14.060\nhave a variety of categories here I'm\ngonna refrain from the desire to start\n\n509\n00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:18.950\ntalking about all the different categories\nand keep it focused, so apps and calendar,\n\n510\n00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.980\nthose happen to be the defaults that are\nhighlighted, which is good that's exactly\n\n511\n00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.230\nwhat I wanted, and then over on the right\nhand side here, I'll click on add.\n\n512\n00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:32.450\nAnd now I want the calendar web part,\nscroll down a bit,\n\n513\n00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.010\nand I'm going to minimize this web part.\n\n514\n00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.670\nSometimes when you're moving\nweb parts around a page,\n\n515\n00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.090\nespecially if you have a lot of web parts,\n\n516\n00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:42.308\nit helps to minimize the web part to\nmake it easier to move that web part or\n\n517\n00:30:42.308 --> 00:30:45.150\nanother web part underneath it which\nis what we're about to do now.\n\n518\n00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:46.025\nSo I'll minimize this web part.\n\n519\n00:30:46.025 --> 00:30:50.976\nI'm not deleting it, it's still there and\nI'm gonna maximize it when I'm done,\n\n520\n00:30:50.976 --> 00:30:55.218\nso it's not like the calendar where\nthe display is a less than helpful,\n\n521\n00:30:55.218 --> 00:30:59.848\ntiny rectangle with no dates on it,\nno I'll put it back the way it was before.\n\n522\n00:30:59.848 --> 00:31:05.970\nAnd now I'm going to go\nto the top panel again,\n\n523\n00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.890\nand I want to drag that calendar web part\n\n524\n00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.700\nunder the project summary web parts.\n\n525\n00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.180\nSo notice I've selected it and right below\nmy mouse, I don't know if you can see it\n\n526\n00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:24.100\non the screen there, the calendar there's\na little box that says calendar so\n\n527\n00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.478\nI know I've clicked on the right place and\nI'm dragging it so I'll drag it down.\n\n528\n00:31:28.478 --> 00:31:32.954\nDown, down like an alligator\ninto the river I guess I\n\n529\n00:31:32.954 --> 00:31:36.330\nshould just stop watching TV, scary.\n\n530\n00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.857\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All those kind of shows, and then\n\n531\n00:31:39.857 --> 00:31:44.900\nsometimes it takes some finagling to get\nthe web part release where you want it.\n\n532\n00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.202\nSometimes it goes on top or beside,\nand you'll want it underneath.\n\n533\n00:31:47.202 --> 00:31:48.218\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it's something\n\n534\n00:31:48.218 --> 00:31:51.607\nthat you might have to futz with,\na technical term more than once.\n\n535\n00:31:51.607 --> 00:31:52.996\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thankfully\n\n536\n00:31:52.996 --> 00:31:54.481\nit worked the first time here.\n\n537\n00:31:54.481 --> 00:31:56.816\nAnd now I'm gonna maximize, or\n\n538\n00:31:56.816 --> 00:32:02.277\nrestore the size of that web part by\nusing the drop down, oops, wrong one.\n\n539\n00:32:02.277 --> 00:32:04.578\n[LAUGH] That's easy to do.\n\n540\n00:32:04.578 --> 00:32:08.600\nRestore the calendar web part and\nit returns to its former glory.\n\n541\n00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.570\nNow, I want to stop editing,\nso how do I do that?\n\n542\n00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:19.081\nI'm gonna go to the Page > Menu,\nand then stop editing.\n\n543\n00:32:19.081 --> 00:32:20.979\nSo another thing to\nknow is the SharePoint,\n\n544\n00:32:20.979 --> 00:32:22.734\nyou've probably discovered already.\n\n545\n00:32:22.734 --> 00:32:26.943\nIs sometimes buttons like stop editing\nappear right on the page where you\n\n546\n00:32:26.943 --> 00:32:29.290\nare editing other times where did it go?\n\n547\n00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.600\nAnd you have to go to a different menu.\n\n548\n00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.628\nIn this case,\nthe page menu to find stop editing.\n\n549\n00:32:32.628 --> 00:32:37.916\nSo there is frankly, a lack of consistency\nwhen it comes to where buttons appear and\n\n550\n00:32:37.916 --> 00:32:42.991\nwhether they're visible by default or\nyou have to go look for them a little bit.\n\n551\n00:32:42.991 --> 00:32:48.153\nSo if you get a little confused,\nmaybe that was the design, just kidding.\n\n552\n00:32:48.153 --> 00:32:50.364\n>> They kinda force you to explore\nthe user interface, right?\n\n553\n00:32:50.364 --> 00:32:51.350\n>> Maybe that's right.\n\n554\n00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.110\n>> By moving those buttons around,\nand putting the in different locations\n\n555\n00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.640\n>> Where's Waldo?\n\n556\n00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.725\nWhere's that button?\n\n557\n00:32:56.725 --> 00:33:04.260\nOkay, so I've stopped editing and now,\nI can add an item to the project calendar.\n\n558\n00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.430\nSo I'll go to the calendar web part for\n\n559\n00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.650\ntoday which is, there's a pretty settled\nbar on top of the current day and\n\n560\n00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:20.040\nthen there's the, the number of the day\nis also in blue so helps you locate it.\n\n561\n00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.630\nAnd again if the add\nappears once you've put\n\n562\n00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:28.700\nthe mouse on the date you want,\nthat box, I'll click on add.\n\n563\n00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:37.890\nAnd I'll call this kick off meeting,\noops, not kickstarter, kick off meeting.\n\n564\n00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.310\nAnd then category scroll down here,\ncategory will be meeting,\n\n565\n00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.740\nand there's some other options there.\n\n566\n00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.730\nWhere's the golf category?\n\n567\n00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:50.910\n>> Yes a very important one.\n\n568\n00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.751\n>> Okay, it's not here, well.\n\n569\n00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:56.458\nMeeting, a lot of business gets\ndone on the golf course, or so\n\n570\n00:33:56.458 --> 00:33:57.873\nthey would like you to believe.\n\n571\n00:33:57.873 --> 00:33:58.501\n>> Yes.\n\n572\n00:33:58.501 --> 00:34:01.193\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then is it in all the events,\n\n573\n00:34:01.193 --> 00:34:04.128\nin other words we don't\nhave a specific start and\n\n574\n00:34:04.128 --> 00:34:09.067\nend time it's in all day long And I could\ntheoretically make it a repeating event or\n\n575\n00:34:09.067 --> 00:34:13.670\nsomething that recurs but if it's kickoff,\npresumably that's a one off.\n\n576\n00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:15.050\nWe might have a kickoff for\nanother project.\n\n577\n00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:18.168\nSo this is not one of those schedule\na weekly meeting types of deals.\n\n578\n00:34:18.168 --> 00:34:22.910\nIt's a one-off, so I'll click Save, and\n\n579\n00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:27.290\nthat is how I've customized and\nconfigured a Project Site.\n\n580\n00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:32.790\n>> Very cool Mark, a great look there, and\na lot of the features and capabilities\n\n581\n00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:36.400\nof SharePoint that are designed to help\nus with productivity and collaboration.\n\n582\n00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.570\nWe talked about integrating our\nOffice applications that we're\n\n583\n00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.460\nalready familiar with\nas we also talked about\n\n584\n00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:47.240\nhow Office Web Apps is now that\nOffice Online Server that's run locally.\n\n585\n00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.280\nAnd then a really good look at\nsetting up a site designed for\n\n586\n00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.940\nprojects, using that project template,\nadding a couple of events to that.\n\n587\n00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.955\nShowing you really,\nhow customizable it is.\n\n588\n00:34:56.955 --> 00:35:00.555\nYou start with that template, and it\ngives you some basics, some suggestions,\n\n589\n00:35:00.555 --> 00:35:02.795\nwhich, if they're fine with you,\nyou keep it.\n\n590\n00:35:02.795 --> 00:35:05.895\nBut, just about everything about\nthat site was customizable.\n\n591\n00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:08.435\nSo, fantastic,\nwe thank you for that, Mark.\n\n592\n00:35:08.435 --> 00:35:10.225\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n593\n00:35:10.225 --> 00:35:12.835\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n594\n00:35:12.835 --> 00:35:13.545\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n595\n00:35:13.545 --> 00:35:15.890\n>>

00:00:20.461\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:24.879\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at upgrading and\n\n5\n00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.101\nmigrating to SharePoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:30.035\nWe're gonna talk about what we can and\ncan't do and some of the dos and\n\n7\n00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:32.074\ndon'ts of that upgrade or\nmigration process.\n\n8\n00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:34.345\nAnd here to walk us through that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n9\n00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:35.167\nHow you doing, Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:36.440\n>> Thanks, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.050\nYeah, so a lot of people wait\nto implement the latest feature,\n\n12\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.570\nthe latest version of SharePoint\nbecause of testing requirements.\n\n13\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.061\nWe're gonna talk about how to go from 2013\nSharePoint to 2016, not from 2010 to 2016.\n\n14\n00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.522\n[COUGH] Third party could get\naway with it, there's a tool, but\n\n15\n00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:59.510\nwe're just gonna talk about\nwhat's baked into the product.\n\n16\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.907\nSo if you're running SharePoint\n2010 now and wanna get to 2016,\n\n17\n00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:05.883\nfirst you'll have to upgrade to 2013 and\nthen to 2016.\n\n18\n00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:10.146\n[COUGH] This is a reason, to avoid the\nupgrade process, why some organizations\n\n19\n00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:13.829\nare going all SharePoint Online or\nconsidering a hybrid approach,\n\n20\n00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.940\nbecause those updates happen continuously,\nsometimes daily.\n\n21\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.920\nSo they never have to worry\nabout doing the updates.\n\n22\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.979\nHowever, Microsoft has\npromised on-prem support.\n\n23\n00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.090\nThey made some noises about threatening to\nremove the on-prem version of Sharepoint.\n\n24\n00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.370\nBut now due to pushback they've\ncommitted to releasing on-premises\n\n25\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.850\nversions of SharePoint as long\nas there's demand for it.\n\n26\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.390\nThis is important because some\ncustomizations will not work in the cloud,\n\n27\n00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.620\nso some organizations have to\nmaintain an on-premises environment.\n\n28\n00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.956\nSo good news it's not going away, and\n\n29\n00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:49.632\nto conceptualize what the on-prem version\nis, think of it as a point in time\n\n30\n00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:54.623\nsnapshot of a functional SharePoint\nonline architecture tested, works fine.\n\n31\n00:01:54.623 --> 00:01:58.133\nWe'll make that the RTM\nversion of SharePoint 2016.\n\n32\n00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:02.243\nOkay, so again, a trade-off between having\nthe latest and greatest functionality and\n\n33\n00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:05.967\nhaving time to test it, so those of you\nthat wanna remain on-prem exclusively,\n\n34\n00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:07.390\nno problem at all.\n\n35\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.632\nLet's look at the upgrade process.\n\n36\n00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:12.295\nSo [COUGH] back in the day if you've\nbeen around SharePoint some time,\n\n37\n00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:14.960\nthere was at one point\nan in place upgrade option.\n\n38\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.558\nThat's no longer available.\n\n39\n00:02:16.558 --> 00:02:21.280\nWhat this means is you're gonna\nhave to create a brand new farm on\n\n40\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.720\nseparate hardware and\nthen you migrate the databases over.\n\n41\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.740\nOkay, so there's a database\nattach migration option as well\n\n42\n00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.290\nfor certain service applications, which\nwe'll talk about, like the manage metadata\n\n43\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.430\nservice for example, a performance\npoint services, secure storage service.\n\n44\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.450\nAnd what is the upgrade process?\n\n45\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.518\nSo first, you're gonna create\nthat new 2016 farm [COUGH] and\n\n46\n00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:51.785\nyou wanna copy the databases\ninto the new environment.\n\n47\n00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:56.410\nNow, it has to be tested and\nwith virtualization now\n\n48\n00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.960\nthere's really no excuse to not test\nbecause you have the capability to do so.\n\n49\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.280\nSo that you reduce, not eliminate, but\n\n50\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.490\nreduce the surprises when you actually\ndo the migration in production.\n\n51\n00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.170\nAll right, let's see,\nnext step is planning the upgrade.\n\n52\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.930\nSo you want to plan\nbusiness communications.\n\n53\n00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.150\nThis means that if people are gonna be\nunable to access the site collection for\n\n54\n00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.880\na weekend, say, because you're doing\nx number of site collections or\n\n55\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.100\ncontent databases per weekend.\n\n56\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.330\nSo your whole upgrade could take weeks or\nmonths depending on how much data you\n\n57\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.120\nhave in your SharePoint contacts and\nhow much testing you have to do after\n\n58\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.340\nthe migration of a single content\ndatabase worth of site collections.\n\n59\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.479\nIt could take months, so\nthere's no rush and slower is better.\n\n60\n00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.901\nIt's not something like maybe\nan Exchange upgrade, for example, or\n\n61\n00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:50.615\na Windows Server upgrade where maybe it\nis realistic to do that in a weekend.\n\n62\n00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:51.311\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n63\n00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:53.983\n>> This is not an upgrade in\na weekend kind of project for\n\n64\n00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:55.698\nmost SharePoint environments.\n\n65\n00:03:55.698 --> 00:03:56.988\nSo business communications,\n\n66\n00:03:56.988 --> 00:04:00.072\nwe're talking about letting people\nknow if there's gonna be an outage.\n\n67\n00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:05.042\nOr perhaps site collections they're used\nto making changes on, maybe they'll be\n\n68\n00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:09.311\nread-only for this weekend, for\nexample, or this three day period.\n\n69\n00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.917\nBusiness requirement survey, so\nmaybe find out what people don't like\n\n70\n00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:17.700\nabout the current environment, or what\nthey'd want to see in the new environment.\n\n71\n00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.510\nIt's a really good chance, just like if\nyou're moving house or moving office,\n\n72\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.710\nit's a great chance to take stock,\neliminate what's not working,\n\n73\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.670\nfigure out what you want in the new digs\nin terms of how you wanna set up your\n\n74\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.620\nspace or furniture or whatever,\nsimilar to SharePoint.\n\n75\n00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.984\nWhat functionalities do you\nwanna take advantage of now and\n\n76\n00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.912\nplan that out in advance.\n\n77\n00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:41.171\n>> Yeah, a great time to get rid of some\nof those sites that maybe aren't being\n\n78\n00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.695\nused as heavily or utilized much.\n\n79\n00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:45.816\nAnd why spend the time migrating\nthose over to the new system if\n\n80\n00:04:45.816 --> 00:04:48.530\nthey're just gonna sit there and\nnot be used anyway?\n\n81\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.740\nSo a really good time to do\nthe spring cleaning, if you will.\n\n82\n00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.225\n>> Indeed, and the answer to why is\nsome people are lazy or these types of\n\n83\n00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:59.029\ninformation management projects always\nget put to the bottom of the list.\n\n84\n00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:00.603\nIn other words, they never happen.\n\n85\n00:05:00.603 --> 00:05:04.193\nI mean, it is easier in a sense\njust to port over the old content,\n\n86\n00:05:04.193 --> 00:05:08.268\nrather than having to do the tough\nthinking work of do we need this or not?\n\n87\n00:05:08.268 --> 00:05:11.120\nDo I really wanna get in touch with\nthis person to see if they need it?\n\n88\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.360\nLet's just move it all,\nwe might need it later.\n\n89\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.030\nThat's sloppy, and it does things like\nit ends up cluttering search results.\n\n90\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.512\nAnd in terms of legal liability,\nwhy not get rid of old content?\n\n91\n00:05:21.512 --> 00:05:25.235\nNot that you've done anything wrong, but\nwhy expose yourself to potential liability\n\n92\n00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:28.635\njust because you've retained content\nthat really should have been deleted.\n\n93\n00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:30.512\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n94\n00:05:30.512 --> 00:05:33.533\n>> You definitely wanna test the upgrade.\n\n95\n00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:38.734\nIn terms of roll back and restore type\noperations, I mean, you'll still have your\n\n96\n00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:44.360\nexisting 2013 farm in production and\nworking and serving requests from users.\n\n97\n00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.180\nSo it's not like you'd be caught in limbo\nwith no working SharePoint environment.\n\n98\n00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.100\nNo, he worst case scenario is you upgrade,\nattach a new content database,\n\n99\n00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.890\nor a content database to your new farm,\nand there's some glitch.\n\n100\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.275\nBut you still have your\nworking 2013 environment so\n\n101\n00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:03.229\nyou're not gonna do anything\ndestructive to your old environment.\n\n102\n00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.093\nThe biggest impact it'll have on users is,\nas I said, some sites might have\n\n103\n00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:12.047\nturned into read-only access\ninstead of read write access.\n\n104\n00:06:12.047 --> 00:06:16.057\nPost upgrade activities, there's always\nthings that are gonna not work the same in\n\n105\n00:06:16.057 --> 00:06:19.845\nthe new version, or some customizations\ndidn't port over correctly.\n\n106\n00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:23.439\nAdditionally, you wanna have someone or\npeople walking around and\n\n107\n00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:27.915\navailable to coach some users because some\nthings will look a little different, and\n\n108\n00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:29.824\nI always use, who moved my cheese?\n\n109\n00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:31.607\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> People resist change or\n\n110\n00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:36.541\nthey get frustrated even though it might\nbe some simple little button that's moved,\n\n111\n00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:39.365\nthey tend to freak out if\nthey're on a deadline.\n\n112\n00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:43.638\nSo having people wandering around with\nexperience in SharePoint 2016 is really\n\n113\n00:06:43.638 --> 00:06:45.415\ngonna help by easing the concern.\n\n114\n00:06:45.415 --> 00:06:48.110\nThere may be one person per department,\nyou train them up on\n\n115\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.750\nsome end user functionality, say,\nof 2016 in advance, so that you have some\n\n116\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.640\nexpertise that can be disseminated\nthat way throughout your organization.\n\n117\n00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.060\n>> All right, Mark, I know upgrades and\nmigrations can be tricky.\n\n118\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.340\nYou got some best practices for us?\n\n119\n00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.195\n>> Absolutely, Mike, so there's a five\nstage process you should consider,\n\n120\n00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:06.471\na framework if you like.\n\n121\n00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:10.129\nAnd if you've done any of the ITIL, the IT\nInfrastructure Library courses based in\n\n122\n00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.280\nLondon, England you'll be familiar\nwith the multi-stage process.\n\n123\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.780\nSo the first one is learning, learning\nwhat your organization's needs are.\n\n124\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.540\nYou want to make sure you have enough\nstorage capacity, for example, in your new\n\n125\n00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.378\nfarm to account for not just your current\nusage, but anticipated future growth.\n\n126\n00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:32.629\nNot everyone has the ability to simply\npurchase new hardware, new storage, for\n\n127\n00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:37.140\nexample, on the fly off and there's\na month long budget cycle to prepare for.\n\n128\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.761\nSo that's another reason to prune and\ndelete old content\n\n129\n00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:46.969\nthat's unused before moving\ninto your 2016 environment.\n\n130\n00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:49.422\nAnd then preparation.\n\n131\n00:07:49.422 --> 00:07:54.605\nSo we wanna have a detailed list of\nany customizations and solutions.\n\n132\n00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:57.180\nThat you may have implemented\nin your environment now.\n\n133\n00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:57.758\nWhy?\n\n134\n00:07:57.758 --> 00:08:02.126\nBecause, generally, you should assume\nthat none of those customizations and\n\n135\n00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:05.690\nsolutions will work correctly\nin your new environment.\n\n136\n00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.970\nIn fact, summarizations will\nstrip away any customizations and\n\n137\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.360\nremove solutions before upgrade, and\n\n138\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.680\nthen add them in the 2016\nenvironment after the upgrade.\n\n139\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.650\nSo, there's a lot of manual work\nbefore and after the upgrade process.\n\n140\n00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.750\nSo you have to factor that in, especially\nif your boss, say, comes at you with\n\n141\n00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:32.440\nan unrealistic timeline for completing\nyour SharePoint 2016 upgrade project.\n\n142\n00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.140\nMonths is realistic.\n\n143\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.980\nWeeks is probably not realistic.\n\n144\n00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.360\nTesting, I've been harping on that.\n\n145\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.260\nAnd with the ubiquity of\nvirtualization technologies,\n\n146\n00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.275\nthere's really no excuse not to\ntest using VMs, if you like.\n\n147\n00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:50.294\nIt's very quickly to reset, and if you\nencounter a glitch during an upgrade,\n\n148\n00:08:50.294 --> 00:08:55.465\nfor example, or a database attached, you\ncan easily revert the VM to where it was\n\n149\n00:08:55.465 --> 00:09:00.432\nbefore and then attempt it again once\nyou've put in what you suspect is a fix.\n\n150\n00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:05.650\nThen, implementation is the next step.\n\n151\n00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.460\nThere are status indicators, so\n\n152\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.290\nyou can monitor the health of\nthe upgrade process ongoingly.\n\n153\n00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.130\nAnd validation, so\nwhen it comes to validation,\n\n154\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.550\nyou wanna have people that are actually\ngonna be using the product, end users.\n\n155\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.440\nOf course, as admins we're end users, too.\n\n156\n00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.330\nBut I'm talking about the regular\noffice worker type end user.\n\n157\n00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.242\nHave them interact with\nthe new environments,\n\n158\n00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:29.600\nstill in the test phase, right?\n\n159\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.410\nSo you've done a database attached,\nnew content database,\n\n160\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.370\nthe old content database is now\nrunning in a 2016 environment.\n\n161\n00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.360\nHave a user sit down,\n\n162\n00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.910\ninteract, do some things they would\nnormally do on team sites, for example.\n\n163\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.090\nMaybe upload a document,\n\n164\n00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.700\nmaybe try to do some edits, maybe check\nin a document, add version information.\n\n165\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.100\nJust get a sense of, okay,\nthis is working as we expect for\n\n166\n00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.260\nnormal tasks that\neveryday users would do..\n\n167\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.810\nAnd it's also,\nyou get some good feedback as well,\n\n168\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.720\nwatching users interact with the system.\n\n169\n00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.150\nSo you might get some ideas\non some customizations or\n\n170\n00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.415\nsome clarification in your training\nmaterials based on where these users might\n\n171\n00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:11.175\nget stumped doing activities which should\nbe easy if you know how to do them.\n\n172\n00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:14.815\nOkay, so what is the pre-upgrade\nsteps to complete then?\n\n173\n00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:16.285\nYou wanna have a farm inventory.\n\n174\n00:10:16.285 --> 00:10:20.405\nSo, you wanna know certainly all\nyour SharePoint servers running\n\n175\n00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:23.475\nin your environment, a detailed list\nof all the service apps running.\n\n176\n00:10:23.475 --> 00:10:26.440\nYou might as well have a site\ncollection list as well.\n\n177\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.860\nClean up your environments.\n\n178\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.980\nGet rid of the debris,\nunused content, site collections.\n\n179\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.710\nAnd there's a way to set that up to avoid\n\n180\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.740\naccumulating debris in the first place\nwhen you create a site collection.\n\n181\n00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.990\nFor example, you can say, okay,\n\n182\n00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.120\nsix months from that date,\nsite collection owner gets contacted.\n\n183\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.848\nDo you wanna keep this site, yes or no?\n\n184\n00:10:44.848 --> 00:10:50.180\nAll right, now,\n\n185\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.040\nin terms of working with your devs for\ndependencies, now you're gonna have to,\n\n186\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.410\nif you've made any customizations to\nthings like master pages, themes,\n\n187\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:05.030\nany custom web parts or modifying of\ndefault web parts, custom JavaScript or\n\n188\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.520\nCSS files, these are some of\nthe content types, list types.\n\n189\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.090\nSo, really, any customization you made to\nthe plain vanilla install of SharePoint\n\n190\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.440\n2013 is, you need to enumerate that.\n\n191\n00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.100\nBecause as I mentioned,\nyou're probably gonna have to recreate\n\n192\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.520\nall those customizations in\nthe new 2016 environment.\n\n193\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.080\nAnd if you've been around a few versions\nof SharePoint, this is not news, and\n\n194\n00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.450\nI would like to be able to say,\n\n195\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.540\nMicrosoft's invested a lot of work\nin helping you port customizations.\n\n196\n00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.140\nBut, no.\n\n197\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.080\nPartly because there are so\nmany ways you can customize, I suppose.\n\n198\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.600\nIt was determined to not even be\na worthwhile project to attempt\n\n199\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.430\nto have to those customizations\nmoved to the new version.\n\n200\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.790\n>> Kinda makes you wanna think\nabout staying on the older version.\n\n201\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.315\nI mean,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:11:49.315 --> 00:11:50.920\n>> At some point, it is like, wow!\n\n203\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.060\nSo everything I've done over the last\nfew years has to be completely removed.\n\n204\n00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.445\nAnd then possibly won't work\nif I try to bring it back, or\n\n205\n00:11:57.445 --> 00:12:00.350\nI'm gonna have to re do it for\nthis upgrade process.\n\n206\n00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.210\n>> Right.\nOne of those three.\n\n207\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.200\nWell, that's a good point.\n\n208\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.060\nSo, you may want to stick with 2013 for\na little longer.\n\n209\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.760\nIf there's no compelling reasons or\nfeatures that occur in 2016, and\n\n210\n00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.860\nwe looked at some of those new features in\na different episode, it does make sense\n\n211\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:21.080\nto consider staying on 2013 and maybe\nwaiting for the next to do your upgrade.\n\n212\n00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.970\nSo, there's another reason why.\n\n213\n00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.019\nI mean, I joke about it sometimes, but\n\n214\n00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:28.560\nit makes sense why some larger\norganizations would be one, two, or\n\n215\n00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.662\nmaybe three major versions behind\nthe current SharePoint offering because of\n\n216\n00:12:32.662 --> 00:12:37.300\nthe massive amount of resources\nrequired to do a successful upgrade.\n\n217\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.900\nLet's see, so solution ages,\nweb templates.\n\n218\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.145\nYou might have modified content types.\n\n219\n00:12:42.145 --> 00:12:44.980\nAgain, you probably have\nto customize all these.\n\n220\n00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.676\nSo, that list I just gave to you,\nit doesn't,\n\n221\n00:12:49.676 --> 00:12:53.630\nI'm not saying that any customizations\nare guaranteed not to work, but all\n\n222\n00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.650\nthose items have the potential to\ncause a failure of an upgrade,\n\n223\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.100\nsay, of a content database\nworth of site collections.\n\n224\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:07.450\nSo, in terms of your troubleshooting,\nuse log files for that.\n\n225\n00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.840\nThose, the potential offenders as\nto why something might not work.\n\n226\n00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.160\nThat's why we have to test.\n\n227\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.810\nMaybe you can get away with not having\nto redo some of your customizations\n\n228\n00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.550\nbecause maybe they weren't too obscure and\nduring the upgrade process,\n\n229\n00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.710\nit's understood it will actually\nplay nice out of the box.\n\n230\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.380\nWell, not out of the box,\n\n231\n00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.300\nbut after the upgrade in your\nSharePoint 2016 environment.\n\n232\n00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.190\nAnd, it may not.\n\n233\n00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.500\nSo it's, I wish I could just give you a\none-size-fits-all, this is the checklist,\n\n234\n00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.470\nit's guaranteed to work this way,\nyou can expect some detours along the way.\n\n235\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.728\nAnd we call that learning.\n\n236\n00:13:36.728 --> 00:13:39.700\n[LAUGH] Experience.\n\n237\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Experience.\n\n238\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.572\nMy favorite definition is that thing\nyou get right after you needed it.\n\n239\n00:13:45.572 --> 00:13:46.560\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.750\n>> The knowledge you get right\n\n241\n00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.430\nafter you needed it.\n\n242\n00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.850\nOkay.\n\n243\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.200\nSo, in terms of cleanup,\nwe talked about deleting site collections.\n\n244\n00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.680\nMaybe you can get rid of\nunnecessary versions.\n\n245\n00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.370\nDo you really need the last 20 versions\nof the, I don't know, company picnic?\n\n246\n00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Who's bringing what.\n\n247\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.810\nProbably not.\n\n248\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.220\nSo, features, templates, web parts that\nyou may have been using before, and\n\n249\n00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:11.950\nnow you don't even need.\n\n250\n00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.660\nThey've already been\nsuperseded by other web parts.\n\n251\n00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.500\nGet rid of those.\n\n252\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:22.330\nOkay, so again, this is because\nsite collection administrators have\n\n253\n00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.030\nquite a lot of power as to what\nhappens in their own sites.\n\n254\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.910\nThere might be a different amount of work\nfor different site collection admins in\n\n255\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.080\nyour environment in terms of preparing for\nthe upgrade.\n\n256\n00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.330\nOne site collection administrator\nmight run a tight ship and\n\n257\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.900\nis very pro-active about\ndeleting unused sites, and\n\n258\n00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.066\none it may have not even have occurred\nto them to delete old content.\n\n259\n00:14:40.066 --> 00:14:41.726\nSo, again, training.\n\n260\n00:14:41.726 --> 00:14:44.000\nTraining before upgrade is very helpful.\n\n261\n00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.610\nSo maybe you have a two month window\nbefore you even do anything resembling\n\n262\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.890\nupgrade, just to encourage\npeople to clean up the old, and\n\n263\n00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.095\ngiving a specific example\nof items to clean up.\n\n264\n00:14:54.095 --> 00:14:57.165\nAnd then, as a reward, after they do that,\n\n265\n00:14:57.165 --> 00:15:00.655\nyou can prioritize them as being\nfirst in line for an upgrade, right?\n\n266\n00:15:00.655 --> 00:15:01.405\n>> Yeah.\n>> And in fact,\n\n267\n00:15:01.405 --> 00:15:04.085\nyou can prevent an upgrade,\nthat's not good.\n\n268\n00:15:04.085 --> 00:15:05.125\nCarrot and the stick.\n\n269\n00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:09.675\nYou could say, if you're not gonna do any\nof these cleanup tasks, you're gonna be at\n\n270\n00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:12.505\nthe bottom of the line when it comes to,\nin terms of upgrading to the new version.\n\n271\n00:15:13.555 --> 00:15:16.357\nOkay, so you wanna test your\nupgrade in a trial environment.\n\n272\n00:15:19.225 --> 00:15:22.531\nYou definitely wanna back up\nyour SharePoint 2013 databases,\n\n273\n00:15:22.531 --> 00:15:24.097\nmake sure you've got a back up,\n\n274\n00:15:24.097 --> 00:15:27.580\nsort of up to the minute right before\nyou do any kind of upgrade process.\n\n275\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.290\nSo back them up.\n\n276\n00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:32.600\nYou're gonna make your site collections\nReady Only, so no changes can be made, and\n\n277\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.580\nthen do the upgrade process.\n\n278\n00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.309\nYou also wanna make sure that certain\nservice applications are backed up.\n\n279\n00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:44.277\nSo, for example, the BDC,\nour business connectivity services,\n\n280\n00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:49.435\nyour search administration,\nsecure store services, back them up.\n\n281\n00:15:49.435 --> 00:15:51.791\nJust an FYI about\nthe search admin database.\n\n282\n00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:55.910\nYou have to stop The search service\nbefore backing up that database.\n\n283\n00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.050\nAnd again,\nthat could have untoward impact.\n\n284\n00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.450\nDepends, I mean, if you're a small shop,\n\n285\n00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:04.330\nsome of these gotchas that I'm\nmentioning might not matter at all.\n\n286\n00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.410\nBut if you're a 24,\n7 international organization,\n\n287\n00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:11.780\nstopping the search service could cause\na lot of grief and may be problematic.\n\n288\n00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.576\nSo again, planning, planning, planning.\n\n289\n00:16:16.061 --> 00:16:16.642\nOkay.\n\n290\n00:16:22.308 --> 00:16:26.761\nSo we want to, more customizations\nthat we need to reconfigure in the new\n\n291\n00:16:26.761 --> 00:16:29.900\nenvironment include\nalternate access mappings.\n\n292\n00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.470\nRemember, that's a way to\naccess through a zone,\n\n293\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.820\nthe same content from a different way,\nfrom the extranet, from the Internet, for\n\n294\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.820\nexample, or\nfrom anywhere outside your firewall.\n\n295\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.680\nSo, those alternate access mappings will\n\n296\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.350\nhave to be recreated in\nthe new environment.\n\n297\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.860\nAuthentication providers,\n\n298\n00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.540\nespecially if you're using some kind of\nmulti-factor authentication, you might\n\n299\n00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.780\nhave some quota templates that are in use\nwhen a new site collection is created.\n\n300\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.770\nYou'll have to recreate\nthe quota templates.\n\n301\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.650\nManaged paths, we've looked at this week.\n\n302\n00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.630\nThose will have to be recreated\nin the new environment as well.\n\n303\n00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.170\nAnd then,\nincoming outgoing e-mail settings for\n\n304\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.728\nthings like receiving alerts when content\nhas changed in the document library.\n\n305\n00:17:10.728 --> 00:17:13.930\nOr granting the users\nthe ability to upload or, sorry,\n\n306\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.780\nto e-mail content to lists and libraries,\nas opposed to having to navigate\n\n307\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.110\nthe Sharepoint infrastructure and\nuploading that way.\n\n308\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.160\nAll right.\n\n309\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.340\nWhat else do we have?\n\n310\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.740\nWe have farm-level security and\npermission settings.\n\n311\n00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.170\nWe'll have to create the new farm.\n\n312\n00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.140\nAgain, you want to have a list so\nyou're not trying to do it from memory.\n\n313\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.330\nYou have the documentation\nin the old farm, and\n\n314\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.030\nit's creating the same\nenvironment in the new farm.\n\n315\n00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.307\nBlocked file types, those are configured\non a per web app basis, and you'll have to\n\n316\n00:17:42.307 --> 00:17:46.604\ndo any customizations of block file types\nfor every web app in your new environment.\n\n317\n00:17:48.924 --> 00:17:50.431\nSettings and schedules for\n\n318\n00:17:50.431 --> 00:17:54.240\ntimer jobs, so this only applies\nif you've customised a timer job.\n\n319\n00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.120\nRemember, there are so\nmany repetitive processes in SharePoint\n\n320\n00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.560\nthat depend on a timer job running every\nx number of minutes, days, hours, etc.\n\n321\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.997\nIf you've customized the timer jobs or\ncreated brand new ones for\n\n322\n00:18:05.997 --> 00:18:09.144\nwhatever custom code you have,\nfor example,\n\n323\n00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:15.047\nyou'll have to recreate those timer jobs\nin your SharePoint 2016 environments.\n\n324\n00:18:15.047 --> 00:18:15.547\nOkay.\n\n325\n00:18:17.923 --> 00:18:20.601\nSo, performing the upgrade process,\nwe have to update,\n\n326\n00:18:20.601 --> 00:18:22.140\nupgrade our content databases.\n\n327\n00:18:24.389 --> 00:18:28.904\nWe have to create web applications\nwhich would involve specifying paths,\n\n328\n00:18:28.904 --> 00:18:33.062\nhost headers, DNS configurations,\nwhether or not we're allowing\n\n329\n00:18:33.062 --> 00:18:37.882\nself-service site creation, are we\nenabling the my site's functionality?\n\n330\n00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.687\nAnd then we can mount a content\ndatabase to our new environment.\n\n331\n00:18:49.035 --> 00:18:53.810\nWe can use PowerShell to update or\nupgrade our service applications.\n\n332\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.074\nI'll be showing you some of these\nthings in a different episode.\n\n333\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.240\nTroubleshooting upgrade issues.\n\n334\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.610\nDefinitely take advantage\nof the log files.\n\n335\n00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:15.030\nThere's an upgrade error log file,\nand you want to\n\n336\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:20.070\njust by using the farm, having various\nusers use various customizations or\n\n337\n00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.190\nprograms or custom web parts you may\nhave created, when you recreate them in\n\n338\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.130\nthe new environment, just test them\nto see if they work as expected.\n\n339\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.210\nRemember, at this point,\nyou haven't deleted anything.\n\n340\n00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.344\nYou haven't damaged, altered,\n\n341\n00:19:31.344 --> 00:19:36.770\nremoved anything to do with your\nexisting SharePoint 2013 environment.\n\n342\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.710\nThis way, you've got a fallback\nposition if there's some\n\n343\n00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.020\nissue that takes awhile to\nresolve in the 2016 environment.\n\n344\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.820\nSo you're gonna have two farms running for\na period of time.\n\n345\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:50.530\nAnd this is, that's helpful to know,\n\n346\n00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.130\ntakes some of the pressure off that\nthere's not gonna be a period of time when\n\n347\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.600\nnothing works and there's no\nSharePoint functionality available.\n\n348\n00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.490\nSo, again, the larger the organization,\nthe more likely you are to have\n\n349\n00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.945\na staged migration process,\nas opposed to everybody all at once.\n\n350\n00:20:04.945 --> 00:20:05.565\n>> All right, Mark.\n\n351\n00:20:05.565 --> 00:20:08.285\nLotta work it seems like\ninvolved in upgrading or\n\n352\n00:20:08.285 --> 00:20:10.555\nmigrating our SharePoint 2016 environment.\n\n353\n00:20:10.555 --> 00:20:14.740\nBut as you said, you have done\nproperly and taken slowly over time,\n\n354\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:20.370\nnot something that we're gonna rush, can\nbe easily successful migration as well.\n\n355\n00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.870\nAnd we've got that great\nbecause we're not destroying or\n\n356\n00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:29.340\nbringing our 2013 environment down until\nwe've done our migration and testing and\n\n357\n00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.960\nvalidation, we know we've gotta roll back,\nso that really does relieve some of that\n\n358\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.570\nstress that we might be feeling during\nthat upgrade migration process.\n\n359\n00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.470\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n360\n00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.770\nGreat information there.\n\n361\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.470\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n362\n00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.820\nSigning off for IT Pro TV.\n\n363\n00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.210\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n364\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.910\n>> I'm Mark

00:00:20.641\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.743\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at social computing\n\n5\n00:00:24.743 --> 00:00:25.700\nfeatures.\n\n6\n00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.860\nOur computers need to get out\nthere in the real world and date.\n\n7\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.701\nNo, just kidding.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n8\n00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:30.558\n>> [LAUGH] No,\n\n9\n00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:37.050\nwe're gonna look at running, basically,\nkinda like social media, in house.\n\n10\n00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.210\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n11\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.060\nHow you doing, Mark?\n\n12\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.820\n>> Good, Mike, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.459\nYes, there's no Tinder app for SharePoint.\n\n14\n00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:45.509\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sorry to disappoint.\n\n15\n00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:48.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But there some social features.\n\n16\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.890\nNow unfortunately there's also essentially\nanti-social features built in.\n\n17\n00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.525\nIn other words, you can't really force\nusers to adopt things like My Sites or\n\n18\n00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.250\nto comment on community forums and\nthe like.\n\n19\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.500\nBut you can at least make\nthose tools available.\n\n20\n00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.280\nLet's look at some of those tools.\n\n21\n00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.625\nSo user profiles are the source of it all.\n\n22\n00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:15.139\nAnd we looked in detail on the first\ncourse, the basic advanced, sorry,\n\n23\n00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:16.170\nthe basic advanced.\n\n24\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Basic SharePoint 2016 week.\n\n25\n00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.210\nSo I'm not going to re-demo what's\nalready covered in that course.\n\n26\n00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.710\nSo if you want more demos,\ngo back or go to that course.\n\n27\n00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.720\nBut we will talk about some features and\n\n28\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.450\nI'll show you some things that we haven't\nyet demonstrated in an upcoming episode.\n\n29\n00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.340\nBut let's talk about what's available.\n\n30\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.240\nSo we've got, if you think of repositories\nof information about people in our\n\n31\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.940\nSharePoint world,\nwe've got Active Directory information.\n\n32\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.838\nThere's no point in recreating that,\nmanually or otherwise,\n\n33\n00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:49.156\nyou're asking users to fill\nout some kind of form.\n\n34\n00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:51.120\nNo, let's make it as simple as possible.\n\n35\n00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.500\nLet's import data that already exists\nabout our users in Active Directory.\n\n36\n00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.640\nAnd while we're at it,\n\n37\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.520\nwe have the capability of importing\nfrom other repositories as well.\n\n38\n00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.879\nAs long as we make an LDAP connection.\n\n39\n00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.680\nSo you might want to pull\nin some information from\n\n40\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.580\nan HR database for example.\n\n41\n00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.440\nBut to keep it simple, let's just talk\nabout importing it from Active Directory.\n\n42\n00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.210\nSo typically we do a one-way import.\n\n43\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.010\nNow for the past few versions\nof SharePoint we've had\n\n44\n00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.880\nthe capability of doing\na two-way synchronization.\n\n45\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.670\nThis could be dodgy.\n\n46\n00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.800\nWhat we're saying there is,\nat least for certain fields, or\n\n47\n00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.820\ncertain metadata, if you like,\nabout an individual user,\n\n48\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.902\nsome of that data can replicate\nback to Active Directory.\n\n49\n00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:35.370\nNow, there's more fields of information\ncaptured about a user in SharePoint.\n\n50\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.280\nThings like hobbies, alma mater,\nskills, other kinds of\n\n51\n00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.680\nreporting relationships that aren't\nneatly captured in Active Directory.\n\n52\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.062\nSo we have control whether we're\ndoing a one-way import, or\n\n53\n00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:50.855\na two-way profile synchronization.\n\n54\n00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:55.750\nWe can control exactly which fields\nare eligible for synchronization.\n\n55\n00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.243\nYou can imagine that things can go south\nquite quickly if users were interacting,\n\n56\n00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:03.697\ntheir SharePoint personalization or\nMy Sites environment and\n\n57\n00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:07.682\njust playing around making changes,\nnot realizing the implications.\n\n58\n00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:11.911\nThat for example, if they change their\nname for a lark and SharePoint then, maybe\n\n59\n00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:16.620\nthat change goes to Active Directory and\nit screws up some HR database connection.\n\n60\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.855\nSo you've got control, but that is\npossible to do a two-way synchronization.\n\n61\n00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:28.846\nAll right, so we could also use,\nI mentioned LDAP as a way to connect\n\n62\n00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:33.753\nto an external source to connect\ninto SharePoint for populating or\n\n63\n00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:36.310\nadding information about users.\n\n64\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.260\nWe can also use the BDC, the Business Data\nConnector, or Business Data Connectivity.\n\n65\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.890\nSo we talked about that in\na different episode and\n\n66\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.040\nthe ability to connect into\nany organized data source.\n\n67\n00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.990\n>> So it sounds a lot like, I think we\nused the term middleware earlier when\n\n68\n00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.630\nwe were talking about\nthe Business Data Connectivity.\n\n69\n00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.115\n>> Exactly, so not only are we restricted\nto Active Directory imports or\n\n70\n00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:05.656\nany organized data source we can make\nan LDAP connection to, also the BDC.\n\n71\n00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:10.700\nSo really when you think about it,\nno matter where critical user information\n\n72\n00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.993\nis stored that you want to bring into\na SharePoint environment, you can do that.\n\n73\n00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:17.657\nAnd that's a good thing.\n\n74\n00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:21.540\n>> [LAUGH] It really is, as you said,\nI mean why double up the work?\n\n75\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.280\nWhy have to recreate information that\nalready exists in an accessible source?\n\n76\n00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.080\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n77\n00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.630\n>> in terms of two-way profile\nsynchronization, you're definitely gonna\n\n78\n00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.660\nwanna be very selective as to which\nfields a SharePoint user can update\n\n79\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.560\nthat would propagate back to, say,\nActive Directory or other data source.\n\n80\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.270\nThink through the implications and\nwhether you even need to do that at all.\n\n81\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.713\n>> Because maybe they're used to\nusing that familiar interface.\n\n82\n00:04:48.713 --> 00:04:51.896\nOr there might be some security\nconsiderations that you don't want people\n\n83\n00:04:51.896 --> 00:04:53.774\ndealing with sensitive data necessarily.\n\n84\n00:04:53.774 --> 00:04:58.006\nOr revealing information about themselves,\nclassification levels perhaps,\n\n85\n00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.814\nin a SharePoint context or\nbeing able to modify that.\n\n86\n00:05:00.814 --> 00:05:03.660\nBut you have a lot of\nchoices is the point.\n\n87\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.256\nWhich gets back to our\ngovernance conversation that's\n\n88\n00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:12.568\nbeen peppering the episodes\nwe've done this week.\n\n89\n00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:15.113\nAll right, so for the prerequisites,\n\n90\n00:05:15.113 --> 00:05:19.537\nwe covered some of this in the first\nweek but it's worth repeating.\n\n91\n00:05:19.537 --> 00:05:22.760\nWe wanna have a separate web\napplication to host My Site.\n\n92\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.045\nSo if you're gonna enable\nMy Site's functionality,\n\n93\n00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:26.742\nit definitely deserves its own web app.\n\n94\n00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:29.704\nIn fact, it's not unusual\nto have multiple web apps.\n\n95\n00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:33.189\nIn other words, one web app per country or\nworld region for example.\n\n96\n00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.855\nBecause administrators generally\nwant to have local control or,\n\n97\n00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:39.282\nI mean I realize\na continent's a big place.\n\n98\n00:05:39.282 --> 00:05:43.299\nBut the Europeans would want to have\ncontrol over their My Sites in a separate\n\n99\n00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:47.153\nweb application, North Americans\nprobably would wanna have control.\n\n100\n00:05:47.153 --> 00:05:51.737\nFor variety of reasons pertaining\nto web app settings, backups, etc.,\n\n101\n00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:54.420\nand different policies and standards.\n\n102\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.604\nIt makes sense to have multiple My Sites\nregions, if you like, around the world,\n\n103\n00:05:58.604 --> 00:06:01.910\ndepending on the size of\nyour organization of course.\n\n104\n00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.290\nWe wanna set up a managed path for the My\nSites, a My Site host site collection.\n\n105\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.410\nWe've gotta set up a user\nprofile service application.\n\n106\n00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.330\nSo again, we did this,\n\n107\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.100\nI demoed this, in the first week,\nthe basic SharePoint administration week.\n\n108\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.482\nAll right.\n\n109\n00:06:24.405 --> 00:06:29.735\nNow, in terms of property mappings, there\nmay be, let's say Active Directory for\n\n110\n00:06:29.735 --> 00:06:34.253\nexample, there may not be a one-to0one\nrelationship between a fee.\n\n111\n00:06:34.253 --> 00:06:37.738\nIn fact, there are definitely some fields\nin SharePoint out of the box that don't\n\n112\n00:06:37.738 --> 00:06:39.826\nmap to an equivalent field\nin Active Directory.\n\n113\n00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:43.139\nSo you get total control over\nthe mapping of the fields,\n\n114\n00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.830\nconstraints like the type\nof data expected.\n\n115\n00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.600\nIs it an integer,\nis it a word that's expected, and\n\n116\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.740\na lot of other options as well.\n\n117\n00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.769\nSo again, you can shape exactly what is\nbeing replicated to what data source.\n\n118\n00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:00.861\nAnd in what manner and constraints\non the kind of input expected for\n\n119\n00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:02.185\na particular field.\n\n120\n00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:06.967\nTo make sure that we get the behavior we\nwant, that the field in the other data\n\n121\n00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:12.070\nsource is populated correctly after\nthe two-way synchronization process.\n\n122\n00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.360\n>> Absolutely, I know a lot of systems\nadmins probably cringe when you say wait,\n\n123\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.210\nthey can fill out fields in a SharePoint\nthat would replicate back to\n\n124\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.060\nActive directory or some other LDAP store.\n\n125\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.910\nBut, as you said, with the proper planning\nand constraints that SharePoint allows me\n\n126\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.290\nto put in place,\nI can keep my data store protected.\n\n127\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.110\n>> Exactly,\nanother thing with the mappings is, and\n\n128\n00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.660\nif you recall our discussion\non content types,\n\n129\n00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.250\nthis was a big reason to\nstandardize definitions of columns.\n\n130\n00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:45.790\nBecause what we call, say, the first name\nfield in SharePoint might be slightly\n\n131\n00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.060\ndifferent from what the equivalent first\nname field is called in other data source.\n\n132\n00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.743\nSo you have to make sure\nthat names line up.\n\n133\n00:07:51.743 --> 00:07:56.985\nAnd in many cases, manager, for example,\nin SharePoint, might not actually\n\n134\n00:07:56.985 --> 00:08:02.168\ncorrespond to what you think manager It\nrepresents in that other data source.\n\n135\n00:08:02.168 --> 00:08:06.641\nSo, just because the names of\nthe profile properties are the same,\n\n136\n00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:10.721\nit doesn't mean they're gonna\nsync the way you want them to,\n\n137\n00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:13.233\nor that you want to sort of translate or\n\n138\n00:08:13.233 --> 00:08:18.119\nsync up that field with the same named\nfield in the different data source.\n\n139\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.280\nSo there's a SharePoint,\nsorry, SharePoint.\n\n140\n00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.960\nThere's a Technet link if you want\ndefault user profile property mappings,\n\n141\n00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.080\nyou can check out.\n\n142\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.940\nAnd again, this will help.\n\n143\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.720\nIt's nice to see things on paper,\nor at least on a screen, rather\n\n144\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.530\nthan be in the interface in SharePoint,\nand if you don't know what you're doing,\n\n145\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.980\ntrying to navigate and scroll and\nget options right from the interface,\n\n146\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.450\nis probably not gonna give\nyou the best results.\n\n147\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.920\nSo this is, because there's so\nmany options for mapping,\n\n148\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.230\nthis is a good example of something\nthat you may wanna print out.\n\n149\n00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.380\nMaybe circle some properties that you\nthink would be good candidates for\n\n150\n00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.180\nsynchronization.\n\n151\n00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.042\nIt's the kinda thing you wanna\nbounce off other people, or\n\n152\n00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:58.827\nmaybe that decision is made for you.\n\n153\n00:08:58.827 --> 00:09:03.471\nAnd then, you go into the interface, and\ninstead of scrolling through hundreds, or\n\n154\n00:09:03.471 --> 00:09:06.180\nat least dozens of potential\nproperty mappings,\n\n155\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.825\nyou know exactly the mapping\nyou're looking for\n\n156\n00:09:08.825 --> 00:09:12.521\nand how you're gonna configure it\nbefore entering the interface.\n\n157\n00:09:14.411 --> 00:09:18.999\nData type compatibility is another\nconsideration to evaluate.\n\n158\n00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:23.874\nIn other words, there may be an acceptable\ninput in a field in SharePoint that\n\n159\n00:09:23.874 --> 00:09:29.199\ndoesn't map well due to integer size, for\nexample, or just unexpected data type,\n\n160\n00:09:29.199 --> 00:09:34.690\nor an incompatible data type in that other\ndirectory source you're trying to sync to.\n\n161\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.410\n>> Now, Mark, I know some of\nthe information in my user profile\n\n162\n00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.730\nmight not be appropriate for sharing\nwith everybody in the organization.\n\n163\n00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.760\nDo we have ways of controlling that or\nwhat's visible?\n\n164\n00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.940\n>> Absolutely, and that's a great thing.\n\n165\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.090\nBecause we have privacy concerns and\n\n166\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.730\nbusiness rules about what\ninformation gets exposed.\n\n167\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.760\nSo, for any given field in\nthe SharePoint's profile, for\n\n168\n00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.700\nexample, we can make it required or\noptional, or\n\n169\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.490\neven disable it so\nthat field doesn't even appear to users.\n\n170\n00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.710\nAnd additionally, users have\ncontrol based on a privacy setting.\n\n171\n00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.030\nSo, not all the fields,\nbut many the fields,\n\n172\n00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.030\nallow the user to control who\nsees that particular information.\n\n173\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.330\nIf, for example, if I have a home\nphone number, I haven't had one for\n\n174\n00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.741\n20 years, that's another story.\n\n175\n00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:21.941\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But a mobile phone number,\n\n176\n00:10:21.941 --> 00:10:23.311\na mobile phone number.\n\n177\n00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:25.411\nI might only want my boss to have that.\n\n178\n00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:28.010\nSo, I can make that setting for\nthat field.\n\n179\n00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.170\n>> Okay.\n>> Other information may be,\n\n180\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.370\nis appropriate for my colleagues,\nthat's another grouping of visibility.\n\n181\n00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.820\nAnd everyone is another option as well.\n\n182\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.790\nAnd the user, not for all the fields,\nbut for the vast majority of fields,\n\n183\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.580\neach user gets to control who\ncan see what information.\n\n184\n00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.724\nHome address, for example,\nor hobbies or sun signs.\n\n185\n00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:54.344\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n186\n00:10:54.344 --> 00:10:58.887\nNow, a big part of why we go to this\ntrouble of establishing profiles in\n\n187\n00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:05.060\nSharePoint, and the synchronization we've\ntalked about, is the concept of audiences.\n\n188\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:11.160\nNow, a big misunderstanding exists for\nsome people.\n\n189\n00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.880\nThey think audiences and\nsecurity are the same thing, or\n\n190\n00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.070\nhave some kind of correlation.\n\n191\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.270\nThey don't.\n\n192\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.090\nWhat audiences do allow us to\ndo is to target information\n\n193\n00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:26.040\nto certain user populations based\non any criteria we specify.\n\n194\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.330\nSo, an example I'd like to use is let's\nsay we've got a company intranet page,\n\n195\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.445\nand we have five offices\nthroughout the country.\n\n196\n00:11:33.445 --> 00:11:37.885\nWe can have information that's\nimportant to disseminate for\n\n197\n00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:39.715\neveryone in the company.\n\n198\n00:11:39.715 --> 00:11:42.955\nBut other information is really\nonly relevant regionally.\n\n199\n00:11:43.955 --> 00:11:48.945\nFor example, upcoming sales meetings or\neven metrics that\n\n200\n00:11:48.945 --> 00:11:54.485\nshould only be seen by people at that\nparticular office, not all five offices.\n\n201\n00:11:54.485 --> 00:11:59.110\nSo it's much better to create\none intranet homepage, for\n\n202\n00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.290\nexample, rather than five different\nones just to expose slightly different\n\n203\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.990\ninformation to each of the five offices.\n\n204\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:11.000\nSo by using audiences,\nwe can choose any single field or\n\n205\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.440\ncombination of fields, there's lots\nof ways of setting up audience rules,\n\n206\n00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.680\nto target information to users\nwho should see that information.\n\n207\n00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:26.200\nThis is good because if we want people to\nadopt and increase their use of SharePoint\n\n208\n00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.480\nand maybe start or have the Internet page\nopen all day long, or a place that they go\n\n209\n00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.290\nto frequently, maybe a start page for the\nbrowser, something like multiple monitors.\n\n210\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.570\nThe way to get that stickiness, or\nthe interest in users in going there,\n\n211\n00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:46.360\nis to make that information timely, which\nmeans expiring content that's out of date.\n\n212\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.850\nAnd you can do that before publishing it.\n\n213\n00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.540\nYou can say, you know what,\nexpire this content on this date.\n\n214\n00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.700\nThe day after the annual general meeting,\nfor example, or may be a week after.\n\n215\n00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.730\nSo when people go there,\nthey're expecting, and\n\n216\n00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.800\nthey get, fresh content,\nalso relevant content.\n\n217\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.310\nSo, by taking the time and\nshowing appreciation for\n\n218\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.373\nthe time of our employees and showing\nthem regional content relevant to them,\n\n219\n00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:14.180\nagain, they're gonna be more\nlikely to want to go and\n\n220\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.770\nstay and use other tools that we make\navailable on that intranet homepage.\n\n221\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.400\nAnd when I say intranet homepage,\nthat's just an example.\n\n222\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.340\nYou can use audience targeting on any page\n\n223\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.812\nin SharePoint if you think it's gonna\nmake the content more relevant.\n\n224\n00:13:26.812 --> 00:13:31.250\nAnother idea,\nanother example I like to use is KPI's.\n\n225\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:36.420\nMaybe only VP level and\nabove employees should get to see KPIs.\n\n226\n00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.300\nAnd they wanna see it on a page\nthat's frequented by the people.\n\n227\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:45.010\nAgain, we can expose a web part only\nto those of a certain audience,\n\n228\n00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.712\nand the audience we can declare as,\nor define as VPs,\n\n229\n00:13:49.712 --> 00:13:54.630\nand it would show up for\nVPs based on their\n\n230\n00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.610\ntitle which presumably would have\nbeen pulled in from active directory.\n\n231\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.650\nSo, or any combination,\nwe can have multiple rules.\n\n232\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.950\nSo, maybe there's a rule for managers,\none for VPs, one for the west region.\n\n233\n00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.455\nYou can have multiple rules\nto comprise an audience,\n\n234\n00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:11.810\nit's only limited by your imagination.\n\n235\n00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:17.750\nThis means you have the capability to\ntarget content as narrowly or as broadly\n\n236\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.580\nas you want, again, making SharePoint\na more useful tool for everybody.\n\n237\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.270\n>> Very good.\n\n238\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.980\nAnd making it easier for us to administer\nbecause then I don't have to make five\n\n239\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.130\npages for five different offices.\n\n240\n00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.440\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n241\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.570\nIt probably wouldn't be us as admins,\n\n242\n00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.330\nbut somebody's gonna appreciate not\nhaving to do that duplicate work.\n\n243\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.690\nAnd then also, you get some\nissues with making changes and\n\n244\n00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.790\nyou have to change it five times.\n\n245\n00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.718\nNow, you could be using content rollups,\nbut that's a whole other discussion.\n\n246\n00:14:42.718 --> 00:14:45.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, what's next?\n\n247\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.050\nAudiences, let's look\nat social interaction.\n\n248\n00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.110\nNow, there's been attempts at Microsoft,\nthey bought 5% of Facebook so\n\n249\n00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:59.120\nyou can see some of the Facebook-like\nactivity or tagging with @s and\n\n250\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:06.450\nhashtags and that kinda thing, or general\nsocial media activities we'd pursue.\n\n251\n00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.780\nNow, Microsoft acquired Yammer,\nthe adoption of that was iffy.\n\n252\n00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.730\nIt's kind of a weird level of abstraction.\n\n253\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.676\nPutting a social network\ninside a social network.\n\n254\n00:15:16.676 --> 00:15:20.475\nI mean, it's just, people didn't use it,\nor it wasn't fully deployed.\n\n255\n00:15:20.475 --> 00:15:25.100\nCuz we have the same, or\nvery close tools in SharePoint already.\n\n256\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.370\nSo people have avoided Yammer for\nthat reason.\n\n257\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.440\nSo what do we have capabilities,\nthe My Sites.\n\n258\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.870\nIf we enable it, that means the user\nhas their own site collection.\n\n259\n00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.480\nThey can share documents\nwith whomever they please,\n\n260\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.310\nthey can use it as a repository,\nreminder, task list, whatever they want.\n\n261\n00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.980\nThey can do some blogging from there.\n\n262\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.167\nThey can, it's a place to go, they can\nfind mentions if they've been tagged in\n\n263\n00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:50.117\nsome kind of content, for example.\n\n264\n00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:54.321\nMaybe a discussion somewhere from\ntheir MySite, they can see a feed,\n\n265\n00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:58.683\nshowing all the mentions or\nhashtag they're interested in following.\n\n266\n00:15:58.683 --> 00:16:05.820\nThere's also likes as well and ratings,\nthose have been deprecated though.\n\n267\n00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.640\nCommunity sites, I'm gonna have a demo for\n\n268\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.430\nyou in an upcoming episode\nof community sites.\n\n269\n00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.020\nIt's kind of a news group feel,\ndiscussion list.\n\n270\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:21.190\nI often ask people in organizations,\napproximately what percentage of\n\n271\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.340\nthe information they need to run their\nbusiness lives just in people's heads?\n\n272\n00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.760\nIn other words,\nit's not documented anywhere.\n\n273\n00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.370\nIt could be a standard operating\nprocedure that everybody knows about,\n\n274\n00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.669\nbut some of those aren't\nwritten down anywhere.\n\n275\n00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.958\nSo, typically the answer\nis from 20 to 70%.\n\n276\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:42.904\nSo, 20 to 70% of the information\nthat employees need to do their\n\n277\n00:16:42.904 --> 00:16:47.956\njobs is not documented anywhere,\nnot on paper, not in some Word doc.\n\n278\n00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:52.864\nSo, this is a problem\nbecause it can be tough\n\n279\n00:16:52.864 --> 00:16:57.920\nto find areas of expertise\nthat people have.\n\n280\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.400\nYou might pass someone in the hallway or\n\n281\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.170\ntalk to them about football\ngame on the weekend.\n\n282\n00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.800\nBut not realize that\nthey have some expertise\n\n283\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.210\nin an area that would really\nmake a difference to you.\n\n284\n00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.070\nMaybe learning a new programming language,\nfor example, or they put on\n\n285\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:14.040\na conference before, or they attended\na conference you're thinking of attending.\n\n286\n00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:19.050\nAll kinds of information that is no\nreal convenient way to expose that,\n\n287\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.050\nor it hasn't been til now.\n\n288\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.270\nSo, certainly with the different\nfields available for\n\n289\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.405\nSharePoint, I can expose my hobbies,\nI can say all that matter.\n\n290\n00:17:27.405 --> 00:17:31.270\nProjects that I've worked on,\nawards I've received or\n\n291\n00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.960\nrecognitions, publications\nis another thing.\n\n292\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.630\nI mean there's not gonna be a publications\nfield in Active Directory, but\n\n293\n00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.650\nthere would be on my SharePoint My Sites.\n\n294\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.750\nI can expose to people, they say,\nMark published this paper, great,\n\n295\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.410\nI'll go check it out.\n\n296\n00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.450\nSo Wikis is one way to quickly\nget knowledge disbursement,\n\n297\n00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.160\nthese community sites is another way.\n\n298\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.840\nLike a discussion list, which we\nprobably all posted on reader response,\n\n299\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.540\nnewspaper articles, or online sites.\n\n300\n00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.950\nIt's a place where people can go to\ndiscuss and comment on a common interest\n\n301\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.650\nor article or a news event or\na political campaign or what have you.\n\n302\n00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.470\nSo, it's a way of getting\nthe conversation going.\n\n303\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.040\nAnd keep in mind, a lot of organizations\nnow, they may not be large, but\n\n304\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.800\nthey're often geographically dispersed.\n\n305\n00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.670\nWhat I mean is, maybe there is no actual\nhead office, it's an entirely virtual\n\n306\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.970\ncompany, people working from wherever\nthere's an Internet connection.\n\n307\n00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:32.430\nAnd a good cup of coffee, so in that case\nthere's no kind of water cooler talk.\n\n308\n00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.950\nThere maybe some message\nboard kind of environment.\n\n309\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.070\nBut these community sites again,\nwe can get discussions going.\n\n310\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.963\nNow the question then becomes,\nwho is moderating the content?\n\n311\n00:18:41.963 --> 00:18:48.300\nBecause for obvious reasons we don't\nwant malicious words being approved.\n\n312\n00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.680\nSo but then you have to introduce\nthe concept of a moderator.\n\n313\n00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.400\nWhich means somebody, that's part of\ntheir job, to authorize essentially or\n\n314\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.590\napprove any comment from being\nplaced on the discussion boards.\n\n315\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.520\nSo that person, that moderator or\n\n316\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.150\nmoderators, become the bottleneck for\nfree flowing communication.\n\n317\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.260\nSo that's a factor to\nkeep in mind as well.\n\n318\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:15.330\nSo a community portal is a place to go for\na collection of these site collections or\n\n319\n00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.660\ncommunity sites, and\nthen a user could search from there.\n\n320\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:26.200\nSo again, the antisocial computing,\nwe joke about it but just because\n\n321\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.470\nI have a SharePoint My Site set up,\nI can be very stingy with my knowledge.\n\n322\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:36.520\nIn other words I know, but if I say I went\nto this university, or I presented at\n\n323\n00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:42.460\nthis conference, that's gonna attract some\nattention, maybe some demands on my time.\n\n324\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.670\nWhich is really part of my job\ndescription, so I might say you know what,\n\n325\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.790\nI'm gonna keep focused\non my tasks at hand.\n\n326\n00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.060\nI'm not going to reveal this about myself\nknowing that I'm gonna be interrupted for\n\n327\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.960\nmy primary purpose.\n\n328\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.690\nNow, it may involve a culture change,\nwhere people realize\n\n329\n00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.850\nthe more people that participate in this,\nthe better it is for everybody.\n\n330\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.682\nSo it may need a carrot and\n\n331\n00:20:03.682 --> 00:20:08.030\nor stick to get people to buy into,\nto share their wealth of expertise\n\n332\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.890\nwith other members of the organization\nthat could driver the enterprise forward.\n\n333\n00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:21.930\nOkay, so, again we have a separate web\napp for the my sites architecture.\n\n334\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.840\nThat's important at least one and\none per region,\n\n335\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.510\nI recommend,\nif you're a world wide organization.\n\n336\n00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.970\nWhen the user creates the My Site for\nthe first time it takes a while\n\n337\n00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.090\nto get created but\nthat becomes a site collection.\n\n338\n00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.720\nWhich may involve discussions about\nquota and total storage space.\n\n339\n00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.550\n>> All right Mark, so\n\n340\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.470\nwhat kind of permissions does\na user need to create My Sites?\n\n341\n00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.740\n>> Okay good question, so they need\nto create personal site permission.\n\n342\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.440\nNow by default, all authenticated\nusers would have this permission.\n\n343\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.640\nWhat I recommend is having a test\ndepartment or division or a geographic\n\n344\n00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.650\nlocation to ramp up with the My Site's\nfunctionality first rather than everyone.\n\n345\n00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:07.640\nBecause there's gonna be lesson learned,\nstorage requirements are an issue.\n\n346\n00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.870\nNow that people are essentially\nsite collection administrators,\n\n347\n00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.520\nif they're on site collection they're\nprobably going to break things or\n\n348\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.840\nexperiment and\nhave increasing help desk calls.\n\n349\n00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.530\nSo rather than turning loose 10,000\npeople potentially with MySites,\n\n350\n00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.220\nmaybe start with a hundred.\n\n351\n00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:27.130\nAnd then you'll get a sense of the support\nrequired during the onboarding,\n\n352\n00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:34.610\nif you like, of these hundred new\npeople using My Sites, all right.\n\n353\n00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.940\nNow, every time we set up\na service application,\n\n354\n00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.260\nthere's at least one\ndatabase that's created.\n\n355\n00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.490\nAnd there's also related databases\nwhen it comes to My Sites.\n\n356\n00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.500\nSo there's the User Profile\nservice application.\n\n357\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.600\nThat has a profile database, a social\ndatabase and a synchronization database.\n\n358\n00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.930\nSo the profile database holds\ninformation about the users.\n\n359\n00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:01.920\nThe social database has information\nabout tags or likes to manage that.\n\n360\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.950\nAnd the synchronization database for\n\n361\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.609\nsynchronizing with the external\ndata sources like Active Directory.\n\n362\n00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.580\nThere's also the manage metadata service,\n\n363\n00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:16.410\nthis is useful because we can use\nkeywords, so maybe you want to,\n\n364\n00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:19.020\nwe've looked at managing metadata\nservice in other episodes.\n\n365\n00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.400\nMaybe you want to constrain\nusers in terms of words or\n\n366\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.030\nperhaps phrases they can\nuse in certain fields.\n\n367\n00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.320\nSome fields lend themselves to that\nmore than others, like department or\n\n368\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.110\nclassification or rank, for example.\n\n369\n00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.670\nEven job title, but that would probably\ncome from an active directory anyway.\n\n370\n00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:42.220\nBut other fields would make\nmore sense to freeform or\n\n371\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.380\nno such constraint,\nlike a phone number field, for example.\n\n372\n00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.190\nAll right search service application\nis highly recommended because,\n\n373\n00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.310\nwhat I said earlier.\n\n374\n00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.110\nSince so much of the information required\nto run a company doesn't exist anywhere\n\n375\n00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:59.870\ndocumented, now more of that information\ncan be exposed through MySites.\n\n376\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.310\nSo we want to make sure that\nsearch is involved as well.\n\n377\n00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.270\nSo when I'm searching on\na particular topic not only am I\n\n378\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.650\ngetting results back\nfrom actual documents and\n\n379\n00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.750\nperhaps websites internally and externally\nthat are part of the crawl database.\n\n380\n00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.870\nBut also now, I'm gonna get people\nresults in my search results, and\n\n381\n00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.790\nthen I can hover over or\nclick on those and\n\n382\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.660\ndrill down and go to that person's\nMy Site, a personalization page.\n\n383\n00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.210\nBased on a search result I clicked on,\nagain,\n\n384\n00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.880\nthat now before the My Sites I\nwould not have had that capability\n\n385\n00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.030\nunless that person had published\nsomething in relation to my search field.\n\n386\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:39.550\nBut now a search can include\nany field in SharePoint\n\n387\n00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:45.180\npopulated on the personalization page for\nthe particular user.\n\n388\n00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.969\nNow, there's several timer jobs related\nto profile synchronization which\n\n389\n00:23:51.969 --> 00:23:52.874\nare automatic.\n\n390\n00:23:52.874 --> 00:23:58.271\nYou may have multi-lingual\nuser interface requirements.\n\n391\n00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:04.359\nSo we've looked at that in another\nepisode, the multilingual capabilities.\n\n392\n00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:09.206\nAnd you may want to restrict the kinds\nof files that users are allowed\n\n393\n00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:11.174\nto upload to their My Site.\n\n394\n00:24:11.174 --> 00:24:15.562\nSo if there's no good reason, for\nexample, for them to have video files,\n\n395\n00:24:15.562 --> 00:24:17.034\nblock those file types.\n\n396\n00:24:17.034 --> 00:24:23.226\nBecause you can imagine that's just gonna\nbe a massive bandwidth and storage hog.\n\n397\n00:24:23.226 --> 00:24:26.987\nNow depending on the business, if your\nbusiness is involved with producing video\n\n398\n00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:29.778\nthen that would be silly to block\nupload of those file types.\n\n399\n00:24:29.778 --> 00:24:33.632\nBut maybe not because maybe you\nwant anything that resembles work,\n\n400\n00:24:33.632 --> 00:24:36.900\nif you're a video production company for\nexample.\n\n401\n00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.550\nMaybe you don't want any of that content\nbeing stored in your users' My Sites\n\n402\n00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.570\nbecause maybe that's the main\noutput of what you do.\n\n403\n00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.582\nSo you want it stored somewhere, a file\nserver for example, where you can access\n\n404\n00:24:47.582 --> 00:24:51.361\nit, edit, manipulate, delete, etc.,\nand have total control over it.\n\n405\n00:24:51.361 --> 00:24:53.788\nAnd remember,\nwhen we're talking about block file types,\n\n406\n00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:55.653\nthose are set an a pure\nweb application basis.\n\n407\n00:24:55.653 --> 00:24:59.607\nWhich means if you have European,\nNorth American, let's say\n\n408\n00:24:59.607 --> 00:25:04.530\nSouth American My Sites hosts, to block\nall those file types from appearing in\n\n409\n00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:10.127\nany region requires setting those blocked\nfile types on each web application.\n\n410\n00:25:10.127 --> 00:25:13.153\n>> It would be nice if there\nwas a sort of blanket, far and\n\n411\n00:25:13.153 --> 00:25:18.013\nwide blocked file types capability, but\nthere's not, natively, in SharePoint.\n\n412\n00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:24.213\nOkay, now to set up\nthe My Sites web application,\n\n413\n00:25:24.213 --> 00:25:29.610\nwe'll have to set up a DNS record and\na separate service account.\n\n414\n00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.604\nYou wanna registered that service account.\n\n415\n00:25:31.604 --> 00:25:37.330\nSo remember, separate web applications\nvery important for My Sites.\n\n416\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:42.375\nYou wanna create a My Site\nhost site collection and\n\n417\n00:25:42.375 --> 00:25:48.115\nthat is an enterprise type of site\ntemplate, the My Site host template.\n\n418\n00:25:48.115 --> 00:25:52.229\nThen you want a wildcard-included\nmanage path, so\n\n419\n00:25:52.229 --> 00:25:56.535\nany number of people's sites\nbelow the My Sites host.\n\n420\n00:25:58.628 --> 00:26:01.601\nAnd then we can connect that\nweb app to various service\n\n421\n00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:04.122\napplications I discussed\na few minutes ago.\n\n422\n00:26:04.122 --> 00:26:08.280\nAnd then, we want to enable\nself-service site creation.\n\n423\n00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.417\nSo once that little button is exposed for\nusers,\n\n424\n00:26:11.417 --> 00:26:16.237\nwhen they log in they'll see it on\nSharePoint and they can click to enable or\n\n425\n00:26:16.237 --> 00:26:19.940\nto start this self-service\nsite creation process.\n\n426\n00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.020\nRemember, that's gonna lead\nto extra storage, bandwidth,\n\n427\n00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.539\nhelp desk calls potentially.\n\n428\n00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:26.687\nSo rather than choose the default,\n\n429\n00:26:26.687 --> 00:26:31.634\nall authenticated users may be exposed\nto a functionality, just a small subset.\n\n430\n00:26:31.634 --> 00:26:34.800\nMaybe the IT users of\nthe western region for example.\n\n431\n00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.580\n>> Now, Mark, is there a way that I can\nrestrict certain users from using tags or\n\n432\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.440\nsome of those other social features?\n\n433\n00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.240\n>> Absolutely, so\nthings like tags and notes.\n\n434\n00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.013\nMaybe you don't want to enable all that\nfunctionality right away for all users.\n\n435\n00:26:49.013 --> 00:26:53.295\nAgain, sort of experimenting or maybe\nthat's just not the direction your company\n\n436\n00:26:53.295 --> 00:26:55.190\nwants to go in, in terms of social.\n\n437\n00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.862\nSo you can block access\nto that functionality.\n\n438\n00:27:01.931 --> 00:27:07.020\nOkay, and then we also have privacy\nsettings for social features as well.\n\n439\n00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:13.229\nSo again, me as a user,\nI can choose the visibility of things like\n\n440\n00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.090\nmy tags or\nthings like workplace anniversary.\n\n441\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.840\nMaybe I don't want people to know that\nI've been here 50 years, for example.\n\n442\n00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.234\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n443\n00:27:23.234 --> 00:27:26.086\nin terms of the Ask Me About section,\n\n444\n00:27:26.086 --> 00:27:31.615\nthat's where it's getting sort of\nintroduction, ask me about this.\n\n445\n00:27:31.615 --> 00:27:36.785\nMaybe once that's set, or\nmaybe someone else designs it for you,\n\n446\n00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:42.660\nso maybe your manager says,\nI don't want Fred to opt out of this.\n\n447\n00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.766\nHe will be asked about X, Y,\nand Z cuz that's his expertise.\n\n448\n00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:50.395\nAnd it's really important that other\npeople get a chance to know that and\n\n449\n00:27:50.395 --> 00:27:53.170\nI'm saying this is part\nof his job description.\n\n450\n00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.040\nSo I can say,\n\n451\n00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.780\nonce that About Me section is filled out,\nit cannot be changed by Fred.\n\n452\n00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.740\nSo that's another way of forcing people\nto buy into this knowledge sharing\n\n453\n00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.230\nenvironment that you may\nwant to be creating.\n\n454\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:13.710\nNow, I might not want people to know\nwhich communities I'm participating in or\n\n455\n00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.570\nwhether I'm following a certain person.\n\n456\n00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:20.170\nSo again, me as a user,\nI have control over who sees what about\n\n457\n00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.640\nmy social activities on\nthe various SharePoint sites.\n\n458\n00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.220\nBirthdays as well, maybe some people don't\nlike their birthdays being celebrated.\n\n459\n00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.965\nIt's a reminder that they're not getting\nany younger so I might want to hide that.\n\n460\n00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:36.588\nOr maybe they just don't like surprises so\nI can hide the birthday.\n\n461\n00:28:36.588 --> 00:28:40.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n462\n00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.615\n>> All right, Mark, great look at some\nof the social computing features that\n\n463\n00:28:44.615 --> 00:28:48.291\nare built into SharePoint that we can\nchoose to enable or not to enable.\n\n464\n00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:52.192\nAnd a lot of the control that\nwe have over that and again,\n\n465\n00:28:52.192 --> 00:28:56.930\npart of and a kind of a deeper look\nat My Sites as well thrown in there.\n\n466\n00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.600\nSo we appreciate that, Mark.\n\n467\n00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.490\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n468\n00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.210\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n469\n00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:03.990\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n470\n00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.643\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n471\n00:29:04.643 --> 00:29:12.186\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.950\nat ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.080\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.198\nAnd today,\nwe're doing our advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:22.071\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n7\n00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:26.330\nwe're actually continuing our thought\nprocess on social computing features.\n\n8\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.170\nThis is a part two.\n\n9\n00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.220\nSo if you missed the first one,\nmake sure you go back and check that out.\n\n10\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.760\nIn this one, we're going to move into\ncommunity type settings within SharePoint.\n\n11\n00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760\nAnd here to make a little more\nsense of that than what I'm doing\n\n12\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.680\nis Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n13\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.610\nHow are you doing, Mark?\n\n14\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.870\n>> Good, Mike.\nThanks.\n\n15\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.488\nYes, communities.\n\n16\n00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:45.485\nWe're all one, or 1,000.\n\n17\n00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:46.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But anyway.\n\n18\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.230\nWe want a way to collaborate\n\n19\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.786\ndiscussions boards with people\nthat share common interestes.\n\n20\n00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.580\nNow, presumably, this is work related but\n\n21\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.910\nit could be a company baseball team,\nwhat have you.\n\n22\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.110\nSo we have a bunch of features related\nto communities that we'll look at.\n\n23\n00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.710\nCommunity portal comprised\nof multiple community sites.\n\n24\n00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.490\nAnd we'll look at community usage options,\nmembership, permissions levels, which\n\n25\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.060\nare a little different than your standard\nSharePoint site permission levels.\n\n26\n00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.700\nWhy?\n\n27\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.610\nBecause we need moderators.\n\n28\n00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.861\nIf experience on the web has shown,\nunmoderated content descends quickly.\n\n29\n00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:26.273\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The race to the bottom.\n\n30\n00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:31.802\nAll right so the idea is to allow for\ncollaboration and to expose content and\n\n31\n00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:38.213\nexpertise that again people didn't really\nknow that existed in their organization,\n\n32\n00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:42.101\nyou can't meet everybody and\nget their life story.\n\n33\n00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:45.595\nHowever that person you pass in\nthe hallway might have some really useful\n\n34\n00:01:45.595 --> 00:01:48.300\ninformation for\nyou to move your next project forward.\n\n35\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.840\nSo it's a way to classify discussions and\nencourage discussions in your enterprise.\n\n36\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.120\nNow presumably with generally\na business motivation, but it could be\n\n37\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.770\njust letting off steam or just some kind\nof social outlet for people as well.\n\n38\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.770\nWe also have the ability to\nlike certain comments and\n\n39\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.230\nthen that will be more likely be promoted.\n\n40\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.594\nAnd so we get sort of the group knowledge,\n\n41\n00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:21.476\nknowledge of the herd to help classify\nwhich comments are of most value.\n\n42\n00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:25.116\nSo you probably seen this in\nother community based sites, for\n\n43\n00:02:25.116 --> 00:02:28.686\nexample Microsoft,\nsome of the tech net communities were,\n\n44\n00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:33.096\nyou get a star rating based on the number\nof correct answers given as voted by\n\n45\n00:02:33.096 --> 00:02:35.630\npeople that got benefit from your answer.\n\n46\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.000\nSo that kind of functionality\nexists as well.\n\n47\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.850\nAnd you can even award badges as well,\n\n48\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.700\nI don't know if you can\ntake those to the bank,\n\n49\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.867\nbut it gives you a nice warm feeling\ninside knowing you're a gold member.\n\n50\n00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:50.910\nAll right, or maybe there is some\nfinancial benefit or it does translate\n\n51\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.040\ninto some kind of formal recognition or\nconsideration for promotion, who knows,\n\n52\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.920\nbut it is a way of rewarding and\nacknowledging who has been the most useful\n\n53\n00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.410\nand valuable on these communities and\nmaybe it's a defacto help desk as well.\n\n54\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.797\nOr a channel there for resolving issues\nthat you may have with technology or\n\n55\n00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:15.979\nsome business process organization,\nmaybe assembly line situations.\n\n56\n00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:23.530\nThe uses for communities are really left\nas limited by your imagination only.\n\n57\n00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.930\nBest reply is another tag\noption as well as likes.\n\n58\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.150\nSo again to help users that don't\nhave a lot of time scan through,\n\n59\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.480\nsearch discussions and\nthen maybe get a question answered that\n\n60\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.760\nsomebody already else had that\nquestion and it was answered.\n\n61\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.876\nSo you can get a much faster answer\nthan by re-posing the same question.\n\n62\n00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:46.046\nAll right, so,\n\n63\n00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:51.660\nnow you might think about we just use\nemail we just use distribution list.\n\n64\n00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.190\nBelieve me if my golfing group is any\nindication those list are annoying\n\n65\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.530\ngetting thirty replies about whether\nsomeone is available this Tuesday for\n\n66\n00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.530\ngolf, forget about it.\n\n67\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.677\nEmail.\nLet's keep things like it's away from\n\n68\n00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.059\nemail distribution lists.\n\n69\n00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.556\n>> Hopefully everybody at ITProTV is\nlistening to you in regards to our\n\n70\n00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:10.221\nkickball team, but I digress.\n\n71\n00:04:10.221 --> 00:04:12.680\n[LAUGH]\n>> Kickball, I've never heard of that.\n\n72\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.788\nIf we can maybe discuss that offline.\n\n73\n00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:15.482\n>> Yeah.\n\n74\n00:04:15.482 --> 00:04:18.513\n[LAUGH]\n>> So besides the annoyance factor that\n\n75\n00:04:18.513 --> 00:04:23.992\ncomes at you through email, community is\nthe place you can go to when you're ready.\n\n76\n00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:27.042\nMaybe you have some time, maybe you're\ninterested in helping some people out with\n\n77\n00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:29.110\nreplies, or you have a question to post.\n\n78\n00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.609\nYou get to go there on your time.\n\n79\n00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.270\nAlso, we have a very valuable history.\n\n80\n00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.750\nSo I had mentioned that in a different\nepisode about the knowledge walking around\n\n81\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.990\nfrom long term employees.\n\n82\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.760\nSome of that is now captured and retained\nbecause there is a history maintained for\n\n83\n00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.560\ncommunity discussions.\n\n84\n00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.850\nSo again, compared to email say, if you\njust joined email distribution lists,\n\n85\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.600\nyou wouldn't be privy to all\nthe previous discussions.\n\n86\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.153\nYou'd just start fresh from\nthat point you entered.\n\n87\n00:04:57.153 --> 00:05:02.012\nSo it's a great way to also organize\ninformation, especially if you've hooked\n\n88\n00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:06.085\nit up with search functionality\nthen it's easy for users to again,\n\n89\n00:05:06.085 --> 00:05:10.600\nfind what you're looking for without\nhaving to repose the same question.\n\n90\n00:05:12.892 --> 00:05:15.400\nAll right, so what are the,\nwe have a template,\n\n91\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.830\nlike many things SharePoint\nthere's a template for that.\n\n92\n00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.720\nFully customizable.\n\n93\n00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.110\nWe have elements like we can add pages,\nlists, so category members,\n\n94\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.700\ndiscussions, a variety of Web parts that\nare unique to community sites as well.\n\n95\n00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.050\nFor example, What's Happening?\n\n96\n00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.500\nWasn't it that a show from the 70's?\n\n97\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.650\n>> It was.\nIt was a good show.\n\n98\n00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.440\n>> What's Happening?\n\n99\n00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.680\nFlashback.\n\n100\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.543\nOkay, top contributors, so\n\n101\n00:05:41.543 --> 00:05:45.499\nanother way to call out people\nthat are contributing the most.\n\n102\n00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.931\nMy membership so I can get a count\nof how many posts I've made or\n\n103\n00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:52.794\nreplies I've made so I can say,\nhey I've made one reply last month.\n\n104\n00:05:52.794 --> 00:05:55.411\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm fully engaged in this community.\n\n105\n00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then we have community tools.\n\n106\n00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.873\nSo, the moderates would have\naccess to this community tools,\n\n107\n00:06:03.873 --> 00:06:06.279\nthey can do things like a word badges.\n\n108\n00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.878\nThey can create categories so you might\nstart out with a certain number of\n\n109\n00:06:09.878 --> 00:06:13.713\ncategories and realize based on a\ndiscussion within the category that really\n\n110\n00:06:13.713 --> 00:06:17.670\nshould have two or three categories now\nto sort of subdivide these categories.\n\n111\n00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.005\nSo someone has to take on that role and\n\n112\n00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:25.966\nthis available site owners and\ncommunity moderator.\n\n113\n00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:26.640\n>> All right, Mark.\n\n114\n00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.270\nNow I'm sure like everything else in\nSharePoint we've got a template to help us\n\n115\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.130\nget started with these community portals.\n\n116\n00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.270\n>> Funny you should mention that, Mike.\n\n117\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.040\nWe have a community portal template.\n\n118\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.730\n>> How about that?\n\n119\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.322\n>> What are the odds?\n\n120\n00:06:37.322 --> 00:06:40.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so it's an Enterprise\n\n121\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.113\ntemplate so it's on the Enterprise\ntab when you create a new site and\n\n122\n00:06:44.113 --> 00:06:47.504\nthese give elements like\na popular community's Web part.\n\n123\n00:06:47.504 --> 00:06:51.317\nSo at a glance a visitor to the site can\nsee what communities are getting the most\n\n124\n00:06:51.317 --> 00:06:55.680\naction, seem to have the most activity\nin them, I'll check those out.\n\n125\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.155\nAnd let's see, we have if you set up\nMySites, which is not a requirement,\n\n126\n00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:06.625\nbut if you have, there’s a link to get\nto communities right from your MySites.\n\n127\n00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.945\nNow there's only one community\nportal per SharePoint farm.\n\n128\n00:07:11.312 --> 00:07:17.342\nI have mentioned in a different episode it\nmakes sense to host my sites regionally,\n\n129\n00:07:17.342 --> 00:07:21.072\nsay North America, South America,\nEurope, separate my site hosts.\n\n130\n00:07:21.072 --> 00:07:22.537\nBut for the community portal,\n\n131\n00:07:22.537 --> 00:07:26.326\nyou can only have one per SharePoint forum\nso you can fight amongst yourselves.\n\n132\n00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:28.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, and\n\n133\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.312\nthen you have a few different ways\nto use community sites and features.\n\n134\n00:07:33.312 --> 00:07:35.700\nYou can have a stand alone community.\n\n135\n00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:41.265\nIn a single site collection,\neven a site, if you want, so\n\n136\n00:07:41.265 --> 00:07:45.960\na very exclusive community,\na secret society, if you will.\n\n137\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.610\nThe first rule of the standalone\n\n138\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.690\nSharePoint Community is we don't\ntalk about the SharePoint Community.\n\n139\n00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.758\nI think I butchered that one.\n\n140\n00:07:54.758 --> 00:07:55.490\nYou can also,\n\n141\n00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.907\nan easy way to setup a community\nis via an email distribution list.\n\n142\n00:07:58.907 --> 00:08:00.812\nNow I was just vilifying email for\n\n143\n00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:04.893\nThis kind of activity where you get\nreply to all, but as a way to start and\n\n144\n00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:09.370\npopulate a community, an e-mail\ndistribution list is a great tool.\n\n145\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.080\nBecause there must be some reason for\n\n146\n00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.750\npeople to be on that\nlist in the first place.\n\n147\n00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.480\nPresumably there's communication,\n\n148\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.650\nat least from one member to everyone\nelse in that distribution list.\n\n149\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.880\nSo, why not port that right\nover to a more modern IDF for\n\n150\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.040\ncollaboration of the community?\n\n151\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.370\nAnd you can also,\nlet's say you have existing sites,\n\n152\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.180\nyou're able to activate community\nfeatures on existing sites.\n\n153\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.400\nThis is useful.\n\n154\n00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.440\nRemember, we've got lots of\nfeatures available, idling,\n\n155\n00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.600\nkind of lying in ways,\nthey're not activated.\n\n156\n00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.690\nSo if you go into look at your\nfarm features or web app features,\n\n157\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.350\nsite collection, site features,\nalmost certainly if you just scroll down\n\n158\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.080\nthe list of features, some of them will be\nactivated, and some will not be activated.\n\n159\n00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.880\nAgain, they're kind of dormant, waiting\nto see if you need that functionality.\n\n160\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.430\nIt would definitely be a mistake to say\nI'm going to activate all features right\n\n161\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.770\nnow, so I just have to do this once, and\nI don't have to worry about it again.\n\n162\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.090\nThat's not a good practice.\n\n163\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.430\nWhy?\nBecause you're introducing some\n\n164\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.600\nfunctionality that's going\nto confuse users, and\n\n165\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.130\npotentially introduce some\nsecurity risks as well.\n\n166\n00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.620\nSo don't go all willy-nilly there,\nbut the point is,\n\n167\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.230\nyou can activate community\nfunctionality on\n\n168\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.469\nexisting sites without having to create\na special community site for the purpose.\n\n169\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.470\nMembership of a community is\nspecific to the community\n\n170\n00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.418\nwhich lets you segment communities nicely.\n\n171\n00:09:37.418 --> 00:09:40.080\nThere's going to be some overlaps,\nsome people will be part of\n\n172\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.610\nmultiple communities, some just one\ncommunity or maybe no communities.\n\n173\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.859\nBut they are organized on a per\ncommunity basis, the membership.\n\n174\n00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.728\nNow, I mentioned earlier,\nI hope it was this episode or\n\n175\n00:09:51.728 --> 00:09:56.180\nthere will be trouble, but\nthere's slightly different permission\n\n176\n00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.840\ncommendations with communities as opposed\nto your regular share point site.\n\n177\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.179\nSo, we still have the members permission,\nwhich is quite\n\n178\n00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:10.900\ncommon to both, but now instead we have\n\n179\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.510\na moderators group as well because we need\nsomeone to moderate, approve comments.\n\n180\n00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.340\nIf we want every comment\nto be approved and\n\n181\n00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.620\ncertainly to change membership to\nthe communities, to award badges and\n\n182\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.459\njust sort of general maintenance of\nmoderating the list and its documents.\n\n183\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.020\nOwners still have full control of the\nsite, and visitors have read permission,\n\n184\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.496\nand that's common to other\nSharePoint sites as well.\n\n185\n00:10:34.496 --> 00:10:41.490\nAll right, so\njust like many things SharePoint,\n\n186\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:47.580\nthe implementation of\nthe technology is not that hard.\n\n187\n00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.330\nI mean, you can follow a checklist, or\nyou know what to do it from experience.\n\n188\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.730\nBut deciding what to implement\nthat can be a challenge.\n\n189\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.220\nSo in terms of planning for communities,\nagain, you're going to have to have some\n\n190\n00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.820\nkind panel or group to identify project\nstakeholders' responsibilities.\n\n191\n00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.230\nWhat are the business needs that having\nthis community or communities will serve?\n\n192\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.910\nIf you can't think of any business needs,\nyou don't have to implement communities.\n\n193\n00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.740\nBut I find it hard to believe that every\nenterprise wouldn't benefit at least\n\n194\n00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.839\nsomewhat from having some of\nthese community functionalities.\n\n195\n00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.920\nAnd even if you don't know exactly\nhow it's going to benefit,\n\n196\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.540\nwho knows what kind of\ninformation gets surfaced?\n\n197\n00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.170\nYou hear these stories\nsometimes about some,\n\n198\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.500\nlet's say, assembly-line worker who\nhad this great idea ten years ago.\n\n199\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.720\nNobody asked him about it.\n\n200\n00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.140\nAnd it comes out, yeah,\nI thought of that ten years ago.\n\n201\n00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.330\nHe finally gets up the courage to\nmention it, or someone finally asks him.\n\n202\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.310\nAnd you know, not everyone's going\nto be proactive with their ideas.\n\n203\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.660\nSo, you know?\n\n204\n00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.070\nIntroverts, extroverts.\n\n205\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.440\nSome people may think,\nit's not my place to suggest this.\n\n206\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.580\nI just started here.\n\n207\n00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.840\nFor whatever reason.\n\n208\n00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.730\nMaking it easier for\npeople to give feedback or\n\n209\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.360\ncontribute to discussion is a great idea.\n\n210\n00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.870\nAnd who knows what benefit\nit could provide, you know?\n\n211\n00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.580\nMaybe try it for\na doodle little trial period.\n\n212\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.710\nIf people say it was waste of time, then\nditch it, but I'm quite confident that\n\n213\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.330\nyou'll get some unexpected ideas\nthat wouldn't be surfaced otherwise.\n\n214\n00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.540\nSo, I recommend at least\ntrying our communities and\n\n215\n00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.070\nthen you can go from there.\n\n216\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.200\nNow, there will be some extra overheads,\nsome will have to moderate each community,\n\n217\n00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.390\nor maybe it's one person moderating\nmultiple communities and\n\n218\n00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.669\nmaybe that becomes part\nof their job description,\n\n219\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.350\nwhich is not necessarily a bad thing,\nand certainly happens at Microsoft.\n\n220\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.810\nWe got actual Microsoft employees,\nmaybe vendors, but they are still\n\n221\n00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.520\nrelated to Microsoft monitoring news\ngroups and discussion groups and\n\n222\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.300\ncommunities, you know, just to,\nso that somebody is listening.\n\n223\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.970\nRight?\nAnd good ideas do come up, and\n\n224\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.100\nmaybe someone doesn't want to go through\na formal channel of phoning Microsoft say,\n\n225\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.380\nor are going to some feedback form, but\nby some community they can make a comment.\n\n226\n00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.450\nIf someone's monitoring that,\na good idea may serve us.\n\n227\n00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:57.680\nAll right, let's put this in practice to\nsee what it looks like in the interface.\n\n228\n00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.560\nSo I'm going to create\na community site infrastructure.\n\n229\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.340\nFirst, I'm in my DC and\nI can figure a DNS record for\n\n230\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.590\nthe community site portal, so\n\n231\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.900\nI'm into my domain name here at DNS and\nI can say new host record.\n\n232\n00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.959\nLet's call this one community, and\n\n233\n00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:23.692\nit's the IP address of my\nSharePoint application server.\n\n234\n00:13:31.309 --> 00:13:37.360\nAll right, and now let's go into\nActive Directory administrative center.\n\n235\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.870\nI'm going to create a new user.\n\n236\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.260\nSpan this.\n\n237\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.550\nThis will be, notice the red asterisks\nthere, those are required fields,\n\n238\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:14:01.980\nwe call this Community Application Pool.\n\n239\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:07.680\nLet's call it Community App Pool for\nthe UPN name and type\n\n240\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:16.940\nin the password.\n\n241\n00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.984\nTwice, And\n\n242\n00:14:23.984 --> 00:14:27.330\nthe usual password never expires,\nuser cannot change.\n\n243\n00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.550\nAnd now, I go back to my SharePoint box.\n\n244\n00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:40.710\nAnd I'm going to register the service\naccount as a SharePoint Managed Account.\n\n245\n00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:47.200\nSo I'm going to go under Security, and\n\n246\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:53.990\nunder General Security configure Managed\nAccounts and register Managed Accounts.\n\n247\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:15:01.587\nThis will be the account I just created,\n\n248\n00:15:01.587 --> 00:15:08.968\nwhich is real town community app pool.\n\n249\n00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:15.827\nAnd okay.\n\n250\n00:15:20.847 --> 00:15:24.530\nI won't store the password, it's funny,\nI've never been prompted for that before.\n\n251\n00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.200\nWhen filling out a form in\nthe SharePoint environment,\n\n252\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.680\nI've never had the auto complete,\ndo you want to remember this account name.\n\n253\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.370\nPop up before.\n\n254\n00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.130\nAlways something new.\n\n255\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.970\n>> Always.\n>> Figure a new web app for\n\n256\n00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:42.944\nthe community site portal, so\nI'll go back into application management.\n\n257\n00:15:42.944 --> 00:15:46.828\nAnd management of applications, new.\n\n258\n00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.140\nAnd we wait a little bit\nwhile it works on it.\n\n259\n00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.860\nOkay, here it is.\n\n260\n00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.319\nCall it community-80 for port 80,\n\n261\n00:16:07.319 --> 00:16:11.700\nwhich means we're going\nto be using host headers.\n\n262\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.454\nLet's call this community.realtown.com.\n\n263\n00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:33.248\nOkay, and we'll scroll down,\nway down to the application pool name and\n\n264\n00:16:33.248 --> 00:16:43.160\nlet's call this SharePoint Community, -80.\n\n265\n00:16:48.324 --> 00:16:52.568\nAnd configurable,\nI'll use my community app pool,\n\n266\n00:16:52.568 --> 00:17:01.285\nmanage the counts, And okay.\n\n267\n00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.580\nWell, that web app's completed.\n\n268\n00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.770\nI'll click on OK.\n\n269\n00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:16.407\nAnd there's my new web app appearing\nin the list, I'll select it and\n\n270\n00:17:16.407 --> 00:17:21.637\ngo to Manage Paths, it says Path,\nI'm gonna call it Forums.\n\n271\n00:17:21.637 --> 00:17:26.324\nThis will be a wildcard inclusion, so\n\n272\n00:17:26.324 --> 00:17:32.040\nadd the path that appears in the list,\nand OK.\n\n273\n00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.132\nNext up is to go to my General Settings.\n\n274\n00:17:38.132 --> 00:17:43.420\nI've still selected the web app I've just\ncreated, Community-80, and Outgoing Email.\n\n275\n00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:53.119\nThis will be mail.realtown.com and\n\n276\n00:17:53.119 --> 00:18:01.896\nlet's go from community@realtown.com and\n\n277\n00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:06.176\nreply to donotreply.\n\n278\n00:18:06.176 --> 00:18:13.640\n[LAUGH] The power, @realtown.com.\n\n279\n00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.340\nExcellent, next up to is to create a site\ncollection for the community portal, so\n\n280\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:25.010\nin Application Management,\nI will choose to create site Collections.\n\n281\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:31.310\nHm, whenever we see a screen\nlike this that has an option,\n\n282\n00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.180\nit often says Web Application.\n\n283\n00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.850\nMake sure you're seeing\nthe Web Application you expect to see,\n\n284\n00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.570\notherwise whatever you're creating will\nbe created in the wrong Web Application.\n\n285\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.382\n>> It's really easy to do in SharePoint,\nisn't it?\n\n286\n00:18:42.382 --> 00:18:43.380\n>> Definitely.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.260\n>> Even if you think okay,\n\n288\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.200\nyou couldn't possibly screw this up.\n\n289\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.290\nI've been working with this web app for\nseveral screens, or\n\n290\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.770\nwizards, dial-up boxes,\nsometimes the old switcheroo can occur.\n\n291\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.190\nSo it's a good idea to check.\n\n292\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.970\nIf it is the wrong web app,\nyou simply select the web app and\n\n293\n00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:05.770\nclick on change web application, and then\nselect the web app you actually wanted.\n\n294\n00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.390\nI'll cancel out of here because\nit is the correct web app.\n\n295\n00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:15.023\nNow the title will be Community Portal,\nUnity portal,\n\n296\n00:19:17.305 --> 00:19:21.990\nAnd I want the root site there,\nso that represented by the slash.\n\n297\n00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.149\nSo I'm not gonna select\nthese other options,\n\n298\n00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:31.310\njust the slash,\nGuns N'

there's a community site, but\n\n301\n00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.890\nfirst we wanna create the portal to\nhost any number of community sites so\n\n302\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.320\nyou go to the

on\ncan be much more reasonable, yeah.\n\n329\n00:21:20.528 --> 00:21:21.745\n>> Much more.\n\n330\n00:21:21.745 --> 00:21:24.035\n[LAUGH]\n>> Thankfully.\n\n331\n00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:31.059\n>> [LAUGH] Search admin app pool,\nokay, and the password.\n\n332\n00:21:38.927 --> 00:21:42.440\nAnd password never expires,\nuser cannot change password.\n\n333\n00:21:44.742 --> 00:21:45.830\nAnd OK.\n\n334\n00:21:48.585 --> 00:21:50.950\nAnd onto another user now.\n\n335\n00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:57.408\nThis will be the search service\nquery web service, application pool.\n\n336\n00:22:00.627 --> 00:22:03.725\n>> And again as he's making that,\nwe're following best practice, right,\n\n337\n00:22:03.725 --> 00:22:06.150\ncreating separate accounts for\nthe different services.\n\n338\n00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.000\nThat way if one becomes compromised,\n\n339\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.469\nthey're not all compromised, just a best\npractice or standard approach to this,\n\n340\n00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:22.387\nPort search query, @Pool.\n\n341\n00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:27.813\nPassword again.\n\n342\n00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.469\nExcellent.\n\n343\n00:22:32.469 --> 00:22:36.449\nAnd user cannot change,\npassword never expires.\n\n344\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.460\nAnother new user now, so\n\n345\n00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.200\nB, the search service account.\n\n346\n00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.086\nWhoops, and we'll call\n\n347\n00:22:52.086 --> 00:22:57.222\nthis one search service.\n\n348\n00:22:57.222 --> 00:23:05.248\n[BLANK AUDIO] Okay, unusual.\n\n349\n00:23:05.248 --> 00:23:10.324\nI'm using this Mac again today and\nthe key depth is minimal.\n\n350\n00:23:10.324 --> 00:23:11.230\n>> It is, isn't it?\n\n351\n00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.520\n>> Wow, it's like a souped up car or\nsomething.\n\n352\n00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.520\n>> You're gonna get used to it and\ngo back to that PC and go, what the heck?\n\n353\n00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.670\n>> Man, my finger are weak now.\n\n354\n00:23:19.328 --> 00:23:25.380\n[LAUGH] We'll have you converted\nbefore the end of the week.\n\n355\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.665\n>> Delirium has set in.\n\n356\n00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:30.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I will not go to the Macs.\n\n357\n00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.870\nI have iPhones, but I'm not getting a Mac.\n\n358\n00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.657\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n359\n00:23:32.657 --> 00:23:37.818\nnow it's time to register some service\naccounts as SharePoint managed accounts,\n\n360\n00:23:37.818 --> 00:23:44.277\nwhich means I need to go back to my\n>> SharePoint box.\n\n361\n00:23:44.277 --> 00:23:50.781\nSo under Security General Settings.\n\n362\n00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:55.668\nI want to Configure Managed Accounts,\nAdd Registered Managed Account.\n\n363\n00:23:55.668 --> 00:23:58.311\nSo this one will be Real Town.\n\n364\n00:24:00.912 --> 00:24:03.613\nAnd Search Admin App Pool,\n\n365\n00:24:13.662 --> 00:24:20.573\nAnd okay And\n\n366\n00:24:20.573 --> 00:24:23.853\nwanna register another\nmanaged account now and\n\n367\n00:24:23.853 --> 00:24:26.813\nthis one will be\nthe search query app pool.\n\n368\n00:24:45.569 --> 00:24:48.425\nAnd okay.\n\n369\n00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:50.855\nAnd one more will be the search service.\n\n370\n00:25:08.593 --> 00:25:09.190\nAnd okay.\n\n371\n00:25:13.736 --> 00:25:17.708\nAnd now it's time to view the community\nsites on the community portal.\n\n372\n00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:19.734\nAt last.\n\n373\n00:25:19.734 --> 00:25:23.520\n[LAUGH]\nOkay, so\n\n374\n00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.370\nin fact this was expected\nthat we wouldn't load up.\n\n375\n00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.170\nWe have to run a search crawl first.\n\n376\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:30.900\nI must say, though,\n\n377\n00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.875\nI was expecting an error message\nnot just the blank white canvas.\n\n378\n00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:37.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sometimes error messages pop up,\n\n379\n00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.360\nsometimes they don't.\n\n380\n00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.980\nBut the point is I was expecting to not\nsee what I needed until we run the crawl.\n\n381\n00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.280\nSo go back to my Essential Admin.\n\n382\n00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.770\nI'll go back to Application Management and\nManage Service Applications.\n\n383\n00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.880\nNow I wanna set up a new\nsearch service application.\n\n384\n00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.647\nLet's call this Railtown Search.\n\n385\n00:26:13.212 --> 00:26:18.174\nOkay, and in the Search Service Accounts\n\n386\n00:26:18.174 --> 00:26:23.600\nlist I want my REAL_TOWN/searchService.\n\n387\n00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.760\nRegister managed account.\n\n388\n00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.640\nAnd I'll set up in app pool for\nthis, scroll down a bit more there.\n\n389\n00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.217\nAnd, let's call this SearchAdminAppPool.\n\n390\n00:26:38.414 --> 00:26:38.914\nWhoops.\n\n391\n00:26:41.944 --> 00:26:47.587\nOkay, and for my application pool for\nsearch query and\n\n392\n00:26:47.587 --> 00:26:53.361\nsite settings,\nthis will be the search query app pool.\n\n393\n00:27:05.942 --> 00:27:06.530\nOkay.\n\n394\n00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:13.129\nOkay, so unlike some other\ndialog boxes in SharePoint,\n\n395\n00:27:13.129 --> 00:27:16.530\nthis one actually gives us\nsome helpful information.\n\n396\n00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.810\nWe can see here that the search\nservice is configured and\n\n397\n00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.390\nnow the search service\napplication is being configured.\n\n398\n00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.870\nIt'd be nice of the standardized actually\nto have some kind of progress part so\n\n399\n00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.440\nyou're wondering, okay they did that\nclick take when I clicked okay.\n\n400\n00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.340\nWhat is happening?\n\n401\n00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.730\nSo people like some feedback,\nit's reassuring.\n\n402\n00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.270\nOkay so that search service\napplication was created.\n\n403\n00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.870\nAnd I'll refresh this page here.\n\n404\n00:27:44.657 --> 00:27:51.507\nOur service applications page, and here's\nthe Railtown search service application.\n\n405\n00:27:55.971 --> 00:27:56.552\nClick that.\n\n406\n00:28:00.922 --> 00:28:02.643\nIt takes a while to load.\n\n407\n00:28:07.711 --> 00:28:08.670\nMake sure I don't tweak that.\n\n408\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.869\nClick on Content Sources under Crawling.\n\n409\n00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.770\nAll right, so the crawl of the local\nSharePoint site is now complete and\n\n410\n00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:18.570\nsuccessful.\n\n411\n00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:22.870\nSo from there we can create\ndiscussions on the community sites and\n\n412\n00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:26.040\nconfigure the community\nsite participation.\n\n413\n00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.935\n>> Fantastic Mark.\n\n414\n00:28:26.935 --> 00:28:31.532\nGreat look at, again, some were talking\nabout the social computing features that\n\n415\n00:28:31.532 --> 00:28:33.380\nwe find in SharePoint 2016.\n\n416\n00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.260\nWays to really enhance collaboration and\nsharing of information.\n\n417\n00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:41.610\nGetting your users to work together,\nright, that's what it's all about.\n\n418\n00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.270\nWe're not going to start singing\nKum Ba Ya or anything like that.\n\n419\n00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:49.220\nBut then a great demonstration as well\nis setting up that community portal and\n\n420\n00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.380\nthat community site.\n\n421\n00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.780\nSo we thank you for that, Mark.\n\n422\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.640\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n423\n00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.350\nSigning up for ITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n424\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.615\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n425\n00:28:57.615 --> 00:28:59.490\n>> And

00:00:19.474\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and today\nwe're doing our Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:25.076\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at Office 365 and\n\n5\n00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:28.000\nSharePoint Online registration.\n\n6\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.540\nSo we're starting to move from\nthe on-premises deployment of SharePoint\n\n7\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.090\nto that online or\ncloud SharePoint deployment and\n\n8\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.390\nhere to help us with all of this is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n9\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.350\nHow are you doing, Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.640\n>> Great, Mike, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.606\nYes.\n\n12\n00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:46.240\nIn our architectural module, our episode\nright at the beginning of this series,\n\n13\n00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.080\nwe looked at four architectural models.\n\n14\n00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.290\nAnd we've been working with\non-premises to this point.\n\n15\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.330\nNow we're going to look at where, frankly,\nalmost all of the development occurs,\n\n16\n00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.030\nfrom Microsoft's perspective, in terms of\nintroducing new functionality, namely,\n\n17\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.110\nthe Cloud.\n\n18\n00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.370\nSo, we'll look at Office 365,\nSharePoint Online, but\n\n19\n00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.380\nbefore we do any of that, we need to\nactually register for an account.\n\n20\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.330\nNow, when you actually go\nthrough the procedure,\n\n21\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.070\nit will probably have changed from\nwhat [LAUGH] I'm showing you.\n\n22\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n23\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.590\neverything's subject to change not just\nwith the registration procedure but\n\n24\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.880\ncertainly working with Office 365\nitself or whatever bundle you get\n\n25\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.570\nmight have a different addition tomorrow\ncompared to today with the pricing plans.\n\n26\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.980\nYou think of all these MBAs working\nto figure out how to bundle,\n\n27\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.340\nextract the most value from people and,\nso I'll show you that as well,\n\n28\n00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.740\njust some of the many\noptions you can choose.\n\n29\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.590\nSo, this again comes down to\na planning consideration.\n\n30\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.940\nSo let's flip over to my screen\nover here and I'm just starting.\n\n31\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.910\nIn the beginning there was Google.\n\n32\n00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.580\nA good place to start all searches.\n\n33\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.864\nI'll go for Office 365 and\ngo to the sponsored link.\n\n34\n00:02:01.485 --> 00:02:02.930\nAll right.\n\n35\n00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.310\nTo be fair to Microsoft, although\nthere are a dizzying array of options,\n\n36\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.200\nthey do help guide you to the pricing plan\nand the feature plan that's best for you.\n\n37\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.960\nYou can always move, you may wanna scale\nup for example if you're doing a trial,\n\n38\n00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.020\nO365, a deployment of maybe 20 people\nare trying it out and reporting back and\n\n39\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.140\nthen you're tweaking and then you're\ngonna upgrade the licence say to an E3 or\n\n40\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.080\nan E5 licence.\n\n41\n00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.210\nSo you can see the plans and pricing.\n\n42\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.550\nThe ribbon area, below the ribbon,\nO 365 Business, Business Premium.\n\n43\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.730\nAnd again,\nthese are always subject to change.\n\n44\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.370\nSo you may have a key, like Skype for\nbusiness, for example.\n\n45\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.630\nThat might be really important to you and\n\n46\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.500\nmaybe it doesn't appear in the bundle\nyou have so you have to switch bundles.\n\n47\n00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.620\nThat sort of thing can be\nquite common unfortunately.\n\n48\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.220\nEverything's subject to change.\n\n49\n00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.703\nAnd, as you'd expect,\nyou got clear, up-front pricing and\n\n50\n00:02:57.703 --> 00:03:01.330\nannual committment is cheaper\nthan a month committment,\n\n51\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.760\nwhich is pretty basic\npricing business there.\n\n52\n00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.540\nNow, it also gives you nice icons.\n\n53\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.240\nIt helps you at a glance to\nfigure out what you're getting.\n\n54\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.010\nThis is pretty good.\n\n55\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.980\nEven the O365 business essentials.\n\n56\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.250\nYou do get Office online so\n\n57\n00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.660\nthe ability to edit Office content without\nhaving the client on your machine.\n\n58\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.400\nAnd, what else do we have here,\nso that's email and\n\n59\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.430\nconferencing, we've got O365 business,\nbusiness premium.\n\n60\n00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.370\nSo you can see that we get more\ncapabilities as we go up the ladder so\n\n61\n00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.350\nSkype, some cloud storage and\n\n62\n00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.680\nthe ability to install client applications\nas well free with your license.\n\n63\n00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.840\nAdditionally, you often get up to five\nPCs that you can put the software on.\n\n64\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.360\nSo it's a nice trade-off between\nactually paying for the product but\n\n65\n00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.280\ngetting a lot of licenses\nto use the product.\n\n66\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.160\nSo it's pretty reasonable.\n\n67\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.710\nAnd then there's gonna be\ntables to look at as well and\n\n68\n00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.850\nI'll show you a screen a little later\nthat's got a feature comparison.\n\n69\n00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.630\nSo again, it goes back to governance.\n\n70\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.540\nRather than wading through a table\nwith literally hundreds of lines and\n\n71\n00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.790\ncomparing options across pricing plans,\nit's better to know in advance\n\n72\n00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.850\nwhat are the critical components you need,\nand what might be nice to have, and\n\n73\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.600\nthen some of those options you're\nnot even gonna know what they are.\n\n74\n00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.800\nSo have a list of what you must have,\nnice to have and\n\n75\n00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.912\nthen other,\nperhaps that you don't care about.\n\n76\n00:04:28.912 --> 00:04:33.310\nAll right, so\nare people going to be editing online?\n\n77\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.180\nIs HD video conferencing a need for you?\n\n78\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.710\nSo you have to decide this.\n\n79\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.385\nAnd let's say we select\nO 365 Business Premium.\n\n80\n00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:46.680\nI'll say buy now.\n\n81\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.810\nIt tells me I already have\na subscription through work.\n\n82\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.430\nSo this can be a problem if you have\nmultiple identities in your life,\n\n83\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.400\nor maybe you have a trial account\nthat's totally separate from work, and\n\n84\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.180\nnow you have to do a proper work trial.\n\n85\n00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.959\nSo you might encounter this screen.\n\n86\n00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:06.742\nSo I'll click on create a new account,\nand they're going to sign me out.\n\n87\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.020\nRecommending browsers be closed,\nbut I'm not gonna do that.\n\n88\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.508\nOkay, so, it's important to\nchoose the correct country.\n\n89\n00:05:19.508 --> 00:05:21.114\nYou might think it's a trial,\n\n90\n00:05:21.114 --> 00:05:24.465\nI'll just play around and\nchoose Botswana or something.\n\n91\n00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:27.765\nThat could throw you for\na loop because not all the options or\n\n92\n00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:31.745\nthe same combinations of options\nis available in each country.\n\n93\n00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:33.125\nDifferent licensing arrangements.\n\n94\n00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:34.925\nSo, don't get cute with that.\n\n95\n00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:36.490\nJust keep it what it is.\n\n96\n00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n97\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.640\n>> All right, so\nwe'll let Mark fill out that form,\n\n98\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.580\nwe'll kinda hide his information\nas he's filling it out.\n\n99\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.630\nHe likes you guys, but\n\n100\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.381\nhe doesn't really wanna receive\na whole bunch of phone calls though.\n\n101\n00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.549\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You good, Mark?\n\n102\n00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:49.892\nGot it all filled out I think?\n\n103\n00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:50.885\n>> Yeah, we're good now.\n\n104\n00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:53.542\nThank's for\nthat security through obscurity.\n\n105\n00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:54.145\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n106\n00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:54.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.980\n>> So, what happened was I filled out\n\n108\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.000\nmy name and address.\n\n109\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.350\nThe address is verified, so if you're\nthinking of using this as a trial and\n\n110\n00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.570\nyou don't wanna make it a real account\nthat you use in production and you think,\n\n111\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.795\nwell, I'll just put a fake address in,\nthat won't work.\n\n112\n00:06:06.795 --> 00:06:07.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n113\n00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.150\nI guess unless it's\na legitimate fake address.\n\n114\n00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.520\n>> Right.\n>> Because there's zip code verification\n\n115\n00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.720\nand that kind of thing.\n\n116\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.400\nSo-\n>> Use your neighbor's address, it's okay.\n\n117\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.300\n>> Or your ex's address,\n\n118\n00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.090\nthat always goes [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n119\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.590\n>> Yes, please send promotional material.\n\n120\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.870\nOkay, that's silly.\n\n121\n00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.370\nAll right, so\nnow we're onto this screen here.\n\n122\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.230\nIt says Step 4, place your order.\n\n123\n00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.710\nSo this is the plan I originally clicked\non, the Office 365 Business Premium.\n\n124\n00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.654\nAnd then I enter the number of users,\nkeep it at one.\n\n125\n00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:36.420\nAnd it shows the taxes, which is nice.\n\n126\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.842\nAnd then if I have a discount code or\npromo code, maybe I was at a tech,\n\n127\n00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:44.031\nwell, not tech, that doesn't happen\nanymore, Ignite conference for example and\n\n128\n00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:47.276\nthe presenter was handling out cards\nwith the code on to get people\n\n129\n00:06:47.276 --> 00:06:50.190\nto try Office 365 then\nyou click on that link.\n\n130\n00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.080\nHave a promo or discount code and\nenter the information.\n\n131\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.090\nAnd then let's say I realize, well, I was\nhoping to get away for five bucks a month.\n\n132\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.570\nI just wanna try this out.\n\n133\n00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.630\nI don't wanna spend 15 bucks a month.\n\n134\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.450\nThen I can click on Looking For\na Different Plan?\n\n135\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.300\nBut I'll just stick with what\nI got there and click on Next.\n\n136\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.920\nAnd then credit card information.\n\n137\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.690\nNow, if you look around and\nthe links seem to change fairly often but\n\n138\n00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.340\nyou should be able to track\ndown a free trial for\n\n139\n00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.670\nOffice 365 legitimately\nonline from Microsoft,\n\n140\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.840\nsometimes it's restricted to Home,\nthe Home version of Office 365, but\n\n141\n00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.200\nat least you can try it out and\nget some comfortability.\n\n142\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.905\nI'm never sure if that's actually a word.\n\n143\n00:07:33.905 --> 00:07:34.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n144\n00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.960\nget some comfort with the new interface\nand then maybe you're the guinea pig for\n\n145\n00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.610\nyour company and you can report\nback saying what usability, etc.\n\n146\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.550\nSo I did not look for a free version so\nit is prompting me for\n\n147\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.639\ncredit card information.\n\n148\n00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.270\nI would, at this point,\nenter that information.\n\n149\n00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.475\nAnd let's go back to Mike so\nthat people don't see that.\n\n150\n00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:58.680\n[LAUGH]\n>> Come on Mark,\n\n151\n00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.025\nyou're not willing to share?\n\n152\n00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:03.935\n[LAUGH] We all want a free\ntrial on Mark's credit card.\n\n153\n00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:05.332\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Alright,\n\n154\n00:08:05.332 --> 00:08:10.440\nwe'll give Mark a minute to fill\nthose out, then we'll be right back.\n\n155\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.272\n>> Okay, that completed.\n\n156\n00:08:12.272 --> 00:08:17.684\nLet's see what it looks like\nnow having just signed up for\n\n157\n00:08:17.684 --> 00:08:24.223\na subscription, so a little sparse here,\nas Microsoft points out,\n\n158\n00:08:24.223 --> 00:08:29.771\nso lets click on the admin tile and\nsee what opens up there.\n\n159\n00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:35.605\nNow, you'll see links like this,\nwhere it says go to the old admin center.\n\n160\n00:08:35.605 --> 00:08:39.670\nIf you've worked with Azure, often there's\nthe classic mode and the new mode.\n\n161\n00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.730\nSo it gives you time to transition away\nfrom something you finally got familiar\n\n162\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.770\nwith to something now you have to\nrelearn how to use the interface.\n\n163\n00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.190\nI mean, in my experience, the Azure for\nexample, the latest interface is better\n\n164\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.400\nbut again there's an unlearning period and\na relearning period.\n\n165\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.390\nSo I'm not gonna go there right now.\n\n166\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.134\nFor right now I do want to show\nyou though, under billing,\n\n167\n00:08:59.134 --> 00:09:00.767\nthen you go to purchase services.\n\n168\n00:09:07.635 --> 00:09:11.381\nOkay, so remember when I talked earlier\nabout how there's a large number of\n\n169\n00:09:11.381 --> 00:09:13.140\nservices to choose from.\n\n170\n00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.290\nWell, helpfully they do rank them and\n\n171\n00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:24.810\ngive you some clue as to for your size of\nbusiness, what is a plan that makes sense?\n\n172\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.380\nWhat are several plans that make sense?\n\n173\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:32.470\nSo here's O 365 Premium and from here, you\ncan actually start a free trial which is\n\n174\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.545\nkind of interesting, even though you might\nhave paid to get here in the first place,\n\n175\n00:09:35.545 --> 00:09:37.880\nnow you can trial some other things.\n\n176\n00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.080\nI guess once they've got your credit\ncard number [LAUGH] You're solid.\n\n177\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.130\nBut anyway, so, it's kind of cool\nactually if you scroll down,\n\n178\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.440\nyou've got your Office 365 Enterprise E3.\n\n179\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.370\nIt's always per-user pricing, per-user\nper month, offered with annual discounts.\n\n180\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.650\nNow just a slight diversion here but\ntechnology related,\n\n181\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.320\nif you're into dynamics CRM, some of you\nmay be using that on-prem and may be\n\n182\n00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.230\nconsidering moving that workload to the\ncloud or maybe you have a new vision for\n\n183\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:16.270\nthe company where you want to reduce or\neliminate on-prem servers completely and\n\n184\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.480\nhave your entire business\nrunning in the cloud.\n\n185\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.760\nMaybe you're downsizing office space,\n\n186\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.850\ndon't want to be responsible for servers\nand the power and the admin skills.\n\n187\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.840\nRemember, you still need some\nadmin skills in the cloud but\n\n188\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.720\nit's just a different set of skills.\n\n189\n00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.910\nAnd, some people may be let go, but other\npeople will be involved in configuring and\n\n190\n00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.970\nmaintaining and\nmanaging your Office 365 and\n\n191\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.350\nSharePoint online offerings,\nso CRM is kind of cool.\n\n192\n00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.320\nSocial Engagement Enterprise.\n\n193\n00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.988\nSome marketing tools here.\n\n194\n00:10:46.988 --> 00:10:49.279\nPretty cool.\nParature, bet you never heard of that.\n\n195\n00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.570\nMe neither until a few days ago.\n\n196\n00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.490\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n197\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.287\n>> There's something cool down here as\n\n198\n00:10:56.287 --> 00:10:56.836\nwell.\n\n199\n00:10:56.836 --> 00:11:00.060\nLet's scroll down,we've\ngot Exchange Online,\n\n200\n00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.130\nso makers of server products are designed\nto play nicely with each other.\n\n201\n00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.920\nWe looked at workflow manager earlier and\nhow we can have a unified set of tasks.\n\n202\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:14.760\nWhether the tasks are generated and\nmanaged in SharePoint, exchanged or,\n\n203\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.310\nyeah, so now we can move that\nworkload online as well.\n\n204\n00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:22.130\nSo Exchange Online, archiving services.\n\n205\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:27.254\nSo some organizations are putting\ntheir archive mailbox in the cloud and\n\n206\n00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:29.690\nwe have a SharePoint Online plan.\n\n207\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.138\nI'm going to show you real soon how\nto sign up for SharePoint Online.\n\n208\n00:11:33.138 --> 00:11:38.070\nI just wanted to make you aware of some\nof the offerings available in the cloud.\n\n209\n00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:38.860\nI don't get a cut.\n\n210\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.520\nI'm not gonna put any kind of\npromo link code in the video or\n\n211\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.860\nanything [LAUGH] just out of\nthe purity out of my IT convictions.\n\n212\n00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:50.843\nProject Online, so again,\nwork flow manager, project,\n\n213\n00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:54.541\nExchange SharePoint, working together.\n\n214\n00:11:54.541 --> 00:11:58.237\nAzure rights management, so you might\nwanna offload your authorization,\n\n215\n00:11:58.237 --> 00:11:59.920\nyour authentication directory.\n\n216\n00:12:01.205 --> 00:12:06.340\nPowerBI, pretty cool so you can run\nsome analytics right from the Cloud.\n\n217\n00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.020\nAnd then OneDrive For Business as well.\n\n218\n00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.800\nSo if you have OneDrive redirection for\nexample,\n\n219\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.000\ngoing from on-prem into the Cloud.\n\n220\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.790\nCloud security is there,\nYammer, even Visio.\n\n221\n00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.220\nThis is kind of cool.\n\n222\n00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.780\nSMS dedicated short code.\n\n223\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:29.360\nIf you've ever received a text ad,\nit comes from a service like this.\n\n224\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.260\nSo you can get basically advertised\nby a cell phone text message,\n\n225\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.170\nthat's a service you can buy.\n\n226\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.430\nI wasn't aware of that,\nI don't know if you were.\n\n227\n00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.300\nI get the odd text from a phone company,\n\n228\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.360\nsay, if I'm roaming in a different\ncountry, or maybe an ad for a product.\n\n229\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.990\nI didn't know you can actually sign up for\n\n230\n00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.249\nthat service and\nhave it as a Cloud service.\n\n231\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.300\nAll right, Enterprise Mobility Suite.\n\n232\n00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.340\nOkay, now we're getting\noff the course here.\n\n233\n00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.260\nBut I just wanna make you aware\nthere's a variety of services that\n\n234\n00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.410\nmay make sense for your business.\n\n235\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:04.730\nSo, now let's go over to, I'll show you\nhow to sign up for SharePoint Online,\n\n236\n00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.020\nslightly different procedure.\n\n237\n00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.170\nKeep in mind, Office 365 can\nbe separate from SharePoint.\n\n238\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.235\nYou can have one without the other,\nbelieve it or not, but\n\n239\n00:13:15.235 --> 00:13:20.585\nmost people would integrate those and\ngo for the full meal deal.\n\n240\n00:13:20.585 --> 00:13:24.995\nSo I'll click on SharePoint Online\ncollaboration software, and\n\n241\n00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:26.805\nhere's a smiley person.\n\n242\n00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:30.125\nAnd we've got the ability\nto compare plans.\n\n243\n00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:32.995\nIt's starting at $5 a month.\n\n244\n00:13:32.995 --> 00:13:37.120\nAnywhere access, so a little marketing\nthere about some of the features.\n\n245\n00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.706\nAnd, let's go to compare plans.\n\n246\n00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:49.015\nOkay so this is a little less complexity,\nwhich I frankly always prefer.\n\n247\n00:13:49.015 --> 00:13:53.320\nFor 5 bucks, 10 bucks, or 20 bucks, and\n\n248\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.720\nI notice that with plan 1 and plan 2,\nyou're just getting SharePoint Online.\n\n249\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.180\nBut, if you fork out for\nthe O 365 Enterprise E3,\n\n250\n00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:06.058\nyou're getting a variety of familiar\nOffice apps as well as Skype and\n\n251\n00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:09.940\nOneDrive cloud storage\nwith your subscription.\n\n252\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.140\nNow this table here is actually\nquite easy to comprehend.\n\n253\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.860\nI mentioned earlier about trying to\ncompare hundreds of lines of features.\n\n254\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.880\nTeam sites, external sharing, even if\nyou weren't necessarily a tech person,\n\n255\n00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.130\nit would be pretty plain\nwhat you were getting.\n\n256\n00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:29.290\nYou might not know what ACM stands for,\ninfo path, form services, business\n\n257\n00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.130\nconductivity services, the middle wherein\nto connect any organized data source.\n\n258\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.010\nYou can see that search is\navailable in all the plans.\n\n259\n00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.584\nSo let's say you wanted to get into\nthe nitty gritty, in that case,\n\n260\n00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:44.518\nyou'd go to the SharePoint\nonline service description,\n\n261\n00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:48.068\nclick that link there, and\nthen it goes to Technet.\n\n262\n00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:54.890\nScroll way up here.\n\n263\n00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.990\nDon't worry,\nwe're not gonna cover all this, but\n\n264\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.810\nI'm just pointing out that there's-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.440\n>> Depending on your interest in\n\n266\n00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.750\nthe SharePoint as a dev, or an admin, or\na site collection admin, or search admin.\n\n267\n00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.550\nI mean it's unbelievable the ways you\ncan compare the different plans with\n\n268\n00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.550\nthe on-prem.\n\n269\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:15.050\nSo, I know I totally freak you out,\nbut if your boss might say we need\n\n270\n00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:20.170\nthis specific feature for sure or else we\ncan't go to the Cloud with this workload,\n\n271\n00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.410\nthen you can come and look here, maybe use\ncontrol F to search rather than scroll.\n\n272\n00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:30.000\nBut there are at least sections for\ndifferent elements.\n\n273\n00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.190\nInsights, for example.\n\n274\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.110\nSo business intelligence information.\n\n275\n00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.670\nSearch features.\n\n276\n00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.000\nSites features.\n\n277\n00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.650\nSo again, and lots of footnotes.\n\n278\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.520\nSo I don't know,\nit might make sense to print it out.\n\n279\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.460\nMaybe have multiple pages\nspread out across a desk and\n\n280\n00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.480\nget your highlighter out and\n[LAUGH] start trying to make sense of it.\n\n281\n00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.030\nI find that any time\nyou can get a poster or\n\n282\n00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.330\nprint things out if it's more than one or\ntwo screen,\n\n283\n00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.760\nit's really gonna help you conceptualize\nand see connections between elements that\n\n284\n00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.270\nyou might not see if you're just scrolling\nor frantically going tab to tab.\n\n285\n00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:10.920\nSo that's a little spiel there\nabout the detailed comparison, and\n\n286\n00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.752\nwhy don't we see what happens when\nwe sign up, let's say, for plan two.\n\n287\n00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.225\nYou see it knows me.\n\n288\n00:16:20.225 --> 00:16:24.490\n[LAUGH] Hello Mark Ingram,\nwhy do you keep signing up for accounts?\n\n289\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:30.889\nBut at least it's helpful because at this\npoint I can add SharePoint online plan\n\n290\n00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:34.825\nto my existing account or\nstart fresh with a brand new account.\n\n291\n00:16:37.302 --> 00:16:42.585\nAnd if I say brand new account, then it's\nthis familiar field I just showed you,\n\n292\n00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:46.250\nat least some of it [LAUGH]\nwith the Office 365 sign up.\n\n293\n00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.580\nNotice it helpfully makes it very clear\nwhat you're about to sign up for there.\n\n294\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.609\nSo, let's see what happen if I choose\nthe other option, if I get back there?\n\n295\n00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.600\nOkay.\n\n296\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.260\nLet's start over.\n\n297\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.370\nSometimes if you have multiple tabs open\non your browser, you hit the Back button,\n\n298\n00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.180\nbut based on information that's stored\nabout other tabs or sessions running,\n\n299\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.400\nit can take you to a different place.\n\n300\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.040\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:10.730\n>> And actually,\n\n302\n00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.610\nthis is a browser out there in Internet\nland, but it can certainly happen in\n\n303\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:18.780\nyour SharePoint deployment as well,\nespecially as an admin.\n\n304\n00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.350\nSometimes you hit the Back button and\n\n305\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.100\nit takes you somewhere that you\ndidn't come from, right, before.\n\n306\n00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.205\nSo, I guess they're trying\nto keep us on our toes.\n\n307\n00:17:26.205 --> 00:17:28.824\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's working.\n\n308\n00:17:28.824 --> 00:17:31.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n309\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.200\nWhat's next here?\n\n310\n00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.760\nI wanna get back to where I can\npiggy-back on an existing account.\n\n311\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:43.800\nBut now that it's,\nthe selection has got a cookie maybe\n\n312\n00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.410\nits not gonna let me piggy-back on.\n\n313\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.209\n>> All right.\n\n314\n00:17:50.357 --> 00:17:51.990\n>> No net, ladies and gentlemen, no net.\n\n315\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.490\nOkay that's not working, so\nwe'll get this figured out.\n\n316\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.600\n>> It's the same, actually,\n\n317\n00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.330\nin the end it's the same process\nthat we saw with Office 365 right?\n\n318\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.404\nYou're going to fill in your\npersonal information after choosing,\n\n319\n00:18:04.404 --> 00:18:08.061\ndoing your research, choosing the right\nplan that's most appropriate for you or\n\n320\n00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:10.450\nyour business,\nfill in your personal information.\n\n321\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.244\nGive them credit card number information.\n\n322\n00:18:12.244 --> 00:18:13.760\nEven if it's a trial,\n\n323\n00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.720\nthey don't bill you unless you actually\nchoose to continue on with the service.\n\n324\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.120\nSo that part is gonna be the same.\n\n325\n00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.260\nSo, I think we've probably seen that.\n\n326\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.660\nSo, let's take one more\nlook at Mark's screen here.\n\n327\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.090\nSee what he's got for us.\n\n328\n00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.282\n>> Miraculously, I fixed it.\n\n329\n00:18:27.282 --> 00:18:28.030\n>> Woo-hoo!\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.095\n>> In the time Mike was talking.\n\n331\n00:18:30.095 --> 00:18:31.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now it did deploy and\n\n332\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.960\nthis is not your father's SharePoint,\nright?\n\n333\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.550\nI might say, this is SharePoint.\n\n334\n00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.990\nIt says so in the bar there.\n\n335\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.830\nBut what the heck?\n\n336\n00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.150\nThis doesn't look like SharePoint at all.\n\n337\n00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:42.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What's this?\n\n338\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.790\nPoint Publishing.\n\n339\n00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.360\nHub Site.\n\n340\n00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.330\nTeam Site.\n\n341\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.165\nSo remember,\nthe behavior of SharePoint Online\n\n342\n00:18:47.165 --> 00:18:51.275\nis not gonna be identical at\nall to your on-prem deployment.\n\n343\n00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:54.575\nHybrid is a different story, which is\nsomething of a different episode, but\n\n344\n00:18:54.575 --> 00:18:56.805\nI'm just showing you how\nstripped down it is.\n\n345\n00:18:56.805 --> 00:18:59.645\nIf you just sign up for\nSharePoint Online, with or without O365,\n\n346\n00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:03.665\nit's gonna be quite bare to start.\n\n347\n00:19:03.665 --> 00:19:06.640\nAnd of course we have the ability to edit,\nso\n\n348\n00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.660\nwe'll get into the utilization for\nSharePoint Online in another episode.\n\n349\n00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.060\n>> All right, fantastic, Mark.\n\n350\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.040\nGreat look there.\n\n351\n00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.060\nSigning up for those two different\nservices, Office 365 as well as\n\n352\n00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.880\nSharePoint Online, look forward to diving\ninto those guys a little more in-depth so\n\n353\n00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.990\nwe can see what we get when\nwe once are signed up.\n\n354\n00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.270\nBut we thank you for that,\ngreat demonstration sir,\n\n355\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.370\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n356\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.960\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n357\n00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.825\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n358\n00:19:33.825 --> 00:19:34.502\n>> And

00:00:20.406\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:21.585\nAnd, specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:25.750\nin this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at Office 365 administration.\n\n6\n00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.990\nIn a previous episode we showed you\nhow to get signed up for Office 365.\n\n7\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.133\nNow we're gonna take a look at\nadministering it once you get in there.\n\n8\n00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.269\nHere to do that for us is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n9\n00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.342\nHow you doing, Mark?\n\n10\n00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:37.010\n>> Good, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.089\nThank you.\n\n12\n00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.952\nNow that we've signed up for our accounts,\nlet's now go delve into the portal and\n\n13\n00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:45.890\nhave a look-see.\n\n14\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.640\nSo if we could box it up, here?\n\n15\n00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.850\nThank you.\n\n16\n00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850\nFirst I'm going to go to\nthe old admin center.\n\n17\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.940\nIf you're familiar with this, you can\nstill use this interface for a while.\n\n18\n00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.790\nBut as it gets closer to forcing everyone\n\n19\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.400\nto move to the new platform, the new way\nof administering, you do get warnings.\n\n20\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.100\nThere's an orange bar there,\nwe'll be changing you over.\n\n21\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.489\nSo in other words,\nyou can choose to move over and\n\n22\n00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.009\nstart learning the new\ninterface at your leisure.\n\n23\n00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.382\nBut at a certain point,\nit's at Microsoft's pleasure, if you will,\n\n24\n00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:25.026\nthat you're forced to move over.\n\n25\n00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:27.270\nI always recommend being proactive here.\n\n26\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.550\nI realize it's not priority one.\n\n27\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.230\nYou've got a lot of other things to do and\nactual administration rather than\n\n28\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.120\ninvesting time to learn the new,\nhow to do things differently.\n\n29\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.560\nHowever, if you wait until\nyou're forced to move over,\n\n30\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.530\nthen you might have to do something\ncritical, and not understand how to do it,\n\n31\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.850\nand make a mistake while putting out fire.\n\n32\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.260\nSo you wanna give yourself a chance.\n\n33\n00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.568\nI know it's a pain.\n\n34\n00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:54.093\nYou had it all set up, and you knew\nexactly where the list options were,\n\n35\n00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:56.066\non the nav panel on left there.\n\n36\n00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.481\nBut that's life.\n\n37\n00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:00.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And Azure, same thing, right?\n\n38\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.310\nThere's a classic interface for\nAzure and a more modern one.\n\n39\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.150\nEventually you will be\nassimilated to the new version.\n\n40\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.310\nAnd don't worry, there'll be\nanother new version after that.\n\n41\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.070\nIt might sound flip, but\nI've kind of made peace with the fact that\n\n42\n00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.890\nI expect something to change\nevery time I go to the interface.\n\n43\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.480\nIt may not, but if it does,\nI'm not surprised.\n\n44\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.704\nAnd now I'm kind of actively seeking\nout what's new since last time.\n\n45\n00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:29.870\nI mean, there's different ways of\ninteracting with the interface, right?\n\n46\n00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.180\nAnother way might be,\nwhy did they do this to me again?\n\n47\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.240\nAnd then they start\nranting on social media.\n\n48\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.090\n>> That just causes stress and ulcers.\n\n49\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.460\nYou might as well get comfortable with it.\n\n50\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.900\nIt's the pros and cons.\n\n51\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.960\nWe talked about going to\nthese online services and how\n\n52\n00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.240\nnow we don't have to worry about updating\nthings and keeping that up to date.\n\n53\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.705\nSo that might be a pro.\n\n54\n00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:53.779\nBut then the con is we might not even\nrealize, or we might not be notified,\n\n55\n00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.220\nif a change comes out and\nsomething's not where it used to be.\n\n56\n00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.320\nBut it's not the end of the world.\n\n57\n00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.671\nIt's there somewhere,\nwe just have to find it.\n\n58\n00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.580\nSo like Mark says,\nstay positive and just go with it.\n\n59\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.240\nTake advantage of it.\n\n60\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.800\n>> There is support available.\n\n61\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.920\nOften a chat window will appear, 24/7 in\nmany cases, to answer your questions.\n\n62\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.714\nThat interaction may or\nmay not help you but\n\n63\n00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:20.901\nIt's not like you're flying solo,\nas it were.\n\n64\n00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.375\nScrolling down, there's a video.\n\n65\n00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:27.210\nIt's another friendly way\nto introduce training.\n\n66\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.260\nWe love video.\n\n67\n00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.991\nSo I won't click on that,\nquick-start video.\n\n68\n00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:34.080\nJust to get you familiarized\nwith the interface.\n\n69\n00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.995\nAt a glance, now, Service Health.\n\n70\n00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:40.232\nMicrosoft does financially back\ntheir service level agreements.\n\n71\n00:03:40.232 --> 00:03:47.370\nIn fact, for SharePoint they have\na commitment to recovery, time objective.\n\n72\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.640\nIf the data center blows\nup with six hours,\n\n73\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.750\nin terms of the amount of lost data, so\n\n74\n00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.950\nthe recovery point objective, they say\nno more than hour's worth of data.\n\n75\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.110\nSo that might be a deal breaker\nin your circumstance, right?\n\n76\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.000\nThat's something you need to\nfigure out before you move\n\n77\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.962\ntoo much of your work load to the cloud.\n\n78\n00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:06.043\nService Health.\n\n79\n00:04:06.043 --> 00:04:11.803\nBecause there's so many services that\nOffice 365 and SharePoint Online\n\n80\n00:04:11.803 --> 00:04:17.474\ndepend on, sometimes they're down in\nsome region or at some data center.\n\n81\n00:04:17.474 --> 00:04:22.044\nAnd this is a dashboard that will give\nyou a clue as to when that's the case.\n\n82\n00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:27.350\nSo for example, Current Health,\nExchange, Rights Management Service.\n\n83\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.790\nSo green is good.\n\n84\n00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.270\nAnd then let's say you're curious about\nwhether Microsoft is meeting their end of\n\n85\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.519\nthe bargain,\nin terms of service level agreements.\n\n86\n00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:37.970\nYou can click into View details and\nhistory.\n\n87\n00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.280\nThen you can see,\nI'm going back a week or so by default.\n\n88\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.130\nAnd then going back 30 days,\nif you click the link for View history for\n\n89\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.400\npast 30 days,\nyou can see what their issues were.\n\n90\n00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.850\nSo here we have an information meeting,\nor a message rather, and\n\n91\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.069\nI can drill down into it.\n\n92\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.570\nAnd, so this is good.\n\n93\n00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.882\nI mean, at Microsoft, they're not trying\nto pretend that everything is always up or\n\n94\n00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:03.810\nthere's no hot fixes.\n\n95\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.812\nThat would be absurd because technology\nhas issues and they needed to be fixed.\n\n96\n00:05:07.812 --> 00:05:11.160\nThey've been very responsible\nin communicating,\n\n97\n00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.420\ncompleted implementation of a fix,\nstart time, end time, and then root cause.\n\n98\n00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.200\nThe point is you can read to your\nhearts content about the source\n\n99\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.140\nof whatever caused,\nat least, some down time.\n\n100\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.710\nIn this case, to do with the Office 365\nportal, and there's a legend down there.\n\n101\n00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.080\nSo red, as you'd expect,\nis bad, service interruption.\n\n102\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.040\nHow this shows up for users, or you as an\nadmin, is you might not be able to log in.\n\n103\n00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.490\nOr you might not be able to access\na certain service, like your mail box,\n\n104\n00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.370\nfor example.\n\n105\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.029\nWhereas in the morning, you sign in and\neverything's tickety-boo.\n\n106\n00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.059\nAnd then after lunch,\n\n107\n00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.665\nall of a sudden you can't access your\nmail from the interface you're used to.\n\n108\n00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:53.585\nSo this is a good place to look,\nthe Service Health dashboard.\n\n109\n00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:55.735\nThere is also a planned\nmaintenance section here.\n\n110\n00:05:57.945 --> 00:05:59.237\nNothing planned.\n\n111\n00:05:59.237 --> 00:06:03.725\nMy main purpose in showing you\nthis interface was to show you\n\n112\n00:06:03.725 --> 00:06:06.315\nthe classic mode, if you like.\n\n113\n00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:08.180\nYeah, another cool thing there.\n\n114\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.669\nLet's go back to where I was.\n\n115\n00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.005\nMicrosoft is keen on getting you\nthe app for Office 365 Admin, so\n\n116\n00:06:15.005 --> 00:06:20.352\non your tiny screen products you\ncan administer the Office 365.\n\n117\n00:06:20.352 --> 00:06:22.191\nI don't know if that's a good thing,\nfrankly.\n\n118\n00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:26.162\nI mean, do you really wanna be squinting\nand clicking on the exact leg and\n\n119\n00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:26.888\nexact area.\n\n120\n00:06:26.888 --> 00:06:29.710\nI guess in an emergency,\nif you're on a plane or something.\n\n121\n00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.967\nThe plane has WiFi and\nyou have to reset some service grade.\n\n122\n00:06:32.967 --> 00:06:37.361\nBut I wouldn't be counting on\nadministering my own 365 with SharePoint\n\n123\n00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:40.024\nonline implementation long-term on a PDA.\n\n124\n00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:41.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's silly.\n\n125\n00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:48.540\nNow a tablet, more realistic, but more is\nmore when it comes to screen real estate.\n\n126\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.550\nI always like more.\n\n127\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.140\nBut the point is, Microsoft is being\nvery proactive at promoting this app for\n\n128\n00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.098\nthe major Apple, and Google,\nand Microsoft stores.\n\n129\n00:06:59.098 --> 00:07:03.015\nYou simply enter your cellphone, and\nwithin 30 seconds, you get a link.\n\n130\n00:07:03.015 --> 00:07:05.776\nClick the link,\nit goes to the app store for\n\n131\n00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:10.150\nyour device, and then you can\nget that on your mobile device.\n\n132\n00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.253\nPretty cool, yeah.\n\n133\n00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:15.368\nAll right, so\n\n134\n00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:20.045\nlet's go back here.\n\n135\n00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:22.989\nThis is the portal homepage and\nthankfully,\n\n136\n00:07:22.989 --> 00:07:25.520\nit's a nice small URL with HTTPS.\n\n137\n00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.160\nSo, portal.office.com/home.\n\n138\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.620\nAlways good to know where you are,\nand Hello, Mark.\n\n139\n00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.270\nVery friendly.\n\n140\n00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.990\nA friendlier face of Microsoft.\n\n141\n00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.155\nThere's a bunch of tiles here.\n\n142\n00:07:39.155 --> 00:07:43.525\nEnabling collaboration with Office online.\n\n143\n00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:48.752\nWe're gonna come back to drilling\ndown into some of those options.\n\n144\n00:07:48.752 --> 00:07:51.089\nBut first I wanna make\nsure to stay focused,\n\n145\n00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:54.636\nbecause that's the title of this episode,\non the admin element.\n\n146\n00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:56.717\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n147\n00:07:56.717 --> 00:08:00.752\n>> Shoot, it's still got me\nin the [LAUGH] old interface.\n\n148\n00:08:00.752 --> 00:08:02.717\nI expected to see the new one now.\n\n149\n00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:05.200\n>> Does that orange bar give\nyou access to the new one or?\n\n150\n00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.610\n>> No or maybe it does.\n\n151\n00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.145\n>> It will let you.\n\n152\n00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:08.917\n>> You are the man.\n\n153\n00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:12.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I thought it was just notification.\n\n154\n00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.390\n>> I do, I remember from what\nwas it was dealing with,\n\n155\n00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.210\nit was what we talked about earlier,\nAzure.\n\n156\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.040\nIt was the same way.\n\n157\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.100\n>> Right.\n>> You go that classic and\n\n158\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.720\nit have that link across the top there.\n\n159\n00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.280\n>> It just didn't occur\nto me as a hyperlink but\n\n160\n00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.150\nthank goodness for Mike, as a host.\n\n161\n00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.335\nHe's been there, he's done that.\n\n162\n00:08:27.335 --> 00:08:30.190\nOkay, brain glitch there, my bad.\n\n163\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.630\nWhat do we have here?\n\n164\n00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.980\nOffice 365 setup is incomplete.\n\n165\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.850\nI'm not sure about that, because I\nactually did set something up before\n\n166\n00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.820\nthe show, but I'm going to ignore that for\nnow because it's not a deal breaker.\n\n167\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.770\nWhen you purchase an Office\n365 subscription, or\n\n168\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.855\neven with a trial if you\nhave the free trial or\n\n169\n00:08:48.855 --> 00:08:54.040\none-month trial, you get to install\nOffice on up to five machines.\n\n170\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.310\nPretty cool.\n\n171\n00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.410\nOptions here, Install my software.\n\n172\n00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.817\nAnd I can choose and get a display\nof which apps will be installed,\n\n173\n00:09:05.817 --> 00:09:08.540\nI mean I might not need Access.\n\n174\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.270\nBut it looks like it's coming anyway.\n\n175\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.472\nPublish, wow, people still use Publisher?\n\n176\n00:09:12.472 --> 00:09:13.133\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n177\n00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:15.730\n[LAUGH]\n>> This shocks me.\n\n178\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.160\nI think I used it back in the 2000 era.\n\n179\n00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.020\nBut then again,\nI'm not a guy that would design things, so\n\n180\n00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.960\nthat's best left to others.\n\n181\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.460\nBut the point is,\nmaybe you use that software, so\n\n182\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.220\nmaybe you have to whip up some\nevent invitation, or something.\n\n183\n00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.068\nNever at.\n\n184\n00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:32.970\nOkay so this is an excellent question\n\n185\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.260\npeople might have if they want to\ngo completely to the cloud, and\n\n186\n00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.350\nnow Microsoft is saying, hey you get\nfive free copies of the software.\n\n187\n00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.390\nWell, why would I?\n\n188\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:45.320\nSo one thing I like about what Microsoft's\ndoing lately is giving you links.\n\n189\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.170\nI mean, based I'm sure on feedback and\nquestions and\n\n190\n00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.580\nhelp desk kind of information.\n\n191\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.200\nWhy would I install Office 2013?\n\n192\n00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.320\nJust a brief aside, with my Windows 10\nmachine, not this one in front, but\n\n193\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.500\na more modern tablet using UEFI\ninstead of BIAS I'm able to\n\n194\n00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.420\nsign on with a four-digit\nPIN instead of a password.\n\n195\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.890\nTo me, just at a glance, it seems, how\ncould that be more secure than a password?\n\n196\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.820\nWhich is a question many people have.\n\n197\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.410\nSo they provide a link,\nhow is a PIN safer than a password?\n\n198\n00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.510\nAnd then you can get the information.\n\n199\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:22.510\nSo it's, I'm sure this will change\nover time, maybe based on other FAQs.\n\n200\n00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.050\nSo let's see what happens.\n\n201\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.260\nWhy does Microsoft say we\nwanna install Office 2013?\n\n202\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.415\nWell, it might be compatibility issues.\n\n203\n00:10:30.415 --> 00:10:35.965\nThose with the latest versions\nof Visio Project File or Office.\n\n204\n00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:37.955\nYou may have old versions of Exchange.\n\n205\n00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:40.275\nThere might be issue with add-ins.\n\n206\n00:10:40.275 --> 00:10:45.565\nSo the point is there's a variety of\nreasons why you may not want to install.\n\n207\n00:10:45.565 --> 00:10:47.629\nBut what the heck,\nthrowing caution to the wind.\n\n208\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.043\nNo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:10:50.043 -->

happens.\n\n212\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.230\nI could go into internet options\nright now and allow for downloads but\n\n213\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.020\nI'm not gonna bother because\nall you'll see is the download.\n\n214\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.760\nThe point is you can do it.\n\n215\n00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.070\nAnd then in case you've forgotten how to,\nthis gold bar appears at the bottom,\n\n216\n00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.680\nit gives you advice to click Run and\nsay yes at the security prompt and\n\n217\n00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.960\nthen stay online means don't\nsuddenly decide to go for lunch and\n\n218\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.750\nshut off your computer in\nthe middle of the download.\n\n219\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.216\nThat's not gonna be constructive,\nand so I'll hit close there, so\n\n220\n00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:28.489\nactually it's a blessing that that got\nblocked because we don't actually need it.\n\n221\n00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:31.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> While we're here, tools and add-ins,\n\n222\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.470\nthis is cool, at support and\nrecovery assistance, Mr. Fix it, you might\n\n223\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.100\nhave used, a way of automatically fixing\nproblems as opposed to having to having to\n\n224\n00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.482\nstart a support ticket or start googling\nor using your favorite search engine.\n\n225\n00:11:44.482 --> 00:11:48.190\nInfoPath and SharePoint Designer.\n\n226\n00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:53.040\nRemember we talked in a different episode\nthis week about how those versions\n\n227\n00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.770\nof products that people would\nnormally use with SharePoint for\n\n228\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:01.120\ndesigning forms and designing the look and\nfeel of your SharePoint environment.\n\n229\n00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.730\nDon't be confused by the name,\nMicrosoft is being quite honest here about\n\n230\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.840\nwe're not just gonna upgrade the year\nto make it seem like a new version.\n\n231\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.362\nThey're saying we're not gonna\nupgrade the version of InfoPath and\n\n232\n00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:13.420\nSharePoint Designer.\n\n233\n00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:18.670\nBut they will continue to use\nthe usable for at least ten more years.\n\n234\n00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.290\nSo, it might seem weird that you might\nthink you're using old technology.\n\n235\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:25.960\nBut for whatever reason, Microsoft's made\nthe decision to not update InfoPath or\n\n236\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.740\nSharePoint designer.\n\n237\n00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.930\nSo, 2013 is the current version.\n\n238\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.180\nIt works fine with SharePoint 2016,\nyou're good to go.\n\n239\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.510\nSo you may want to download\nthose apps as well.\n\n240\n00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.700\nSkype for business, good for\ninstant messaging, audio/video calls.\n\n241\n00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.600\nAvailability, so\npresence awareness is extremely useful.\n\n242\n00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.140\nEspecially if you're dealing in a multi\n\n243\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.820\ntime zone kind of\ninternational corporation.\n\n244\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.530\nYou could waste a lot of days,\n\n245\n00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.800\nif I sent you an email, you might not\neven get till the next day from me.\n\n246\n00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.230\nAnd by the time you respond,\nit's three in the morning and I am asleep.\n\n247\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.235\nSo if you really slow things down,\nbut if you know someone's there.\n\n248\n00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:05.085\nI mean, assuming it's set up to work.\n\n249\n00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:08.085\nIt doesn't always work,\nin terms of presence awareness,\n\n250\n00:13:08.085 --> 00:13:11.845\nbut it's much easier if one of three\npeople can answer a question and\n\n251\n00:13:11.845 --> 00:13:14.735\ntwo people are appearing offline a link,\nbut one person's online,\n\n252\n00:13:14.735 --> 00:13:17.425\nyou can send them an IM right then,\nget an answer to your question, and\n\n253\n00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:21.050\nkeep that workflow going\nas opposed to the delay.\n\n254\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.890\nAll right, that's my spiel for\nSkype for Business.\n\n255\n00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.094\nRemember, I get no commission,\nno commission.\n\n256\n00:13:25.094 --> 00:13:29.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then phone or tablets.\n\n257\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:29.970\nThat's interesting.\n\n258\n00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.330\nWhat, you're gonna buy one from here?\n\n259\n00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.030\nHm.\n\n260\n00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.770\nWe're not gonna do that now.\n\n261\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.590\nAll right, let's go back.\n\n262\n00:13:37.392 --> 00:13:39.210\nAll right, so\nwe're back in the interface there.\n\n263\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.190\nWe talked about Office Software, you may\nor may not want to download it on multiple\n\n264\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:48.190\ndevices depending on what's the age\nof applications you're using, and\n\n265\n00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.020\nwhether there might be potentially\ncompatibility issues, but you point is\n\n266\n00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.750\nyou're licensed for up to five downloads,\nand you can choose to take advantage.\n\n267\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.870\nNow, there's a dashboard here like we'd\nexpect in a SharePoint environment,\n\n268\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.720\nso you can use the nav on the left side\nif you're more comfortable with that.\n\n269\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.590\nOr utilize the dashboard for\nthings like service health.\n\n270\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:12.745\nClick on that.\nWe're all good!\n\n271\n00:14:12.745 --> 00:14:15.925\n>> [LAUGH]\n>>

can scroll down and\ncheck out the status.\n\n275\n00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.280\nIf there was an issue with\none of these categories,\n\n276\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.750\nlike mobile device management for\nexample, rights management service.\n\n277\n00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.977\nYou can read all about it\non the right hand side.\n\n278\n00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:36.817\nGo back to where I was, and\nwhat else do we have here?\n\n279\n00:14:36.817 --> 00:14:38.082\nWhat happened to my message center?\n\n280\n00:14:38.082 --> 00:14:39.762\nThere were messages before.\n\n281\n00:14:39.762 --> 00:14:43.502\nLots of videos, people see this\non other interfaces as well, and\n\n282\n00:14:43.502 --> 00:14:46.160\nof course,\nour whole business here is video.\n\n283\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:52.860\nInstead of the help file or some reference\nto maybe a bit of a wordy TechNet article\n\n284\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:58.400\nthat sort of thing a lot of organizations\nnow are displaying videos as a help file.\n\n285\n00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.070\nSo they have to be short and to the point\nso typically under two minutes.\n\n286\n00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:08.073\nSo, there is an admin center overview,\nhow to install Office on PC or Mac.\n\n287\n00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:13.940\nOneDrive, running Outlook\non your mobile device.\n\n288\n00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.160\nA little get started chat video.\n\n289\n00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.420\nSo that's something you\ncan watch at your leisure.\n\n290\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.072\nWe won't play them here.\n\n291\n00:15:22.072 --> 00:15:26.930\nRecently added in terms of\n\n292\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.150\nfunctionality that's added because\nthink of it like a constant beta,\n\n293\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.920\nlike Google tends to advertise\ntheir products in beta.\n\n294\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.085\nRight?\nHow many?\n\n295\n00:15:35.085 --> 00:15:37.574\nIt's a multi-year beta.\n\n296\n00:15:37.574 --> 00:15:40.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like if you want a software\n\n297\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.310\nlicense and it's only good for\nsort of testing purposes internally,\n\n298\n00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.940\nwe can say well, it's a multi-year test.\n\n299\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.810\nUntil the next version of software comes\naround, it will be a multi-year test.\n\n300\n00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.180\nSo the same kind of idea.\n\n301\n00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.156\nSo the point is, wouldn't it be great\nto have one place, and there is now,\n\n302\n00:15:55.156 --> 00:15:58.016\nthat you can find out what\nwas updated month to month.\n\n303\n00:15:58.016 --> 00:16:02.493\nSo for example, custom tiles, the ability\nto create mail enabled security group.\n\n304\n00:16:02.493 --> 00:16:06.161\nSo remember, one of the points of\nfrustration for you is it's let's see you\n\n305\n00:16:06.161 --> 00:16:09.889\nuse to deal exclusively at on-prem\nenvironment, whether it's Exchange,\n\n306\n00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:13.840\nProject Server, SharePoint,\nWindows server, other server products.\n\n307\n00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.910\nYou're used to using the tools you have,\nyou probably don't use all the tools but\n\n308\n00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.430\na lot of them and\nthen you come in an online environment\n\n309\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:25.170\nas we looked at in our architecture in\nthe beginning of the course this week.\n\n310\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.690\nIt's a trade off there,\nyou're not getting all the control you\n\n311\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.080\nused to have on-prem if you\ngo to the cloud services.\n\n312\n00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.250\nSo, the more services that are added in,\nthe more similar it'll\n\n313\n00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.408\nbe to your experience administering\non-prem, so that's a good thing.\n\n314\n00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:41.720\nTypical feature on-prem,\nit's based on feedback,\n\n315\n00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.310\nyou'll see on the bottom\nright that never goes away.\n\n316\n00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:50.300\nI've tried to kill it, it will not die.\n\n317\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.639\nThis feedback box, so if we click on that.\n\n318\n00:16:53.855 --> 00:16:58.520\nIt'll rate the experience, and then you\ncan arrange to get contacted if you want.\n\n319\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.320\nThere's also other windows,\n\n320\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.400\ndepending on what you're doing, that\nyou can actually type in some feedback.\n\n321\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.370\nMore of a support thing rather\nthan a feedback features and\n\n322\n00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:11.180\nthe like, that kind of thing.\n\n323\n00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.930\nSo your feedback does get aggregated and\nwho knows,\n\n324\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.510\nit might result in a fix in the future,\nor some future improvement.\n\n325\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.700\nAccessibility improvements.\n\n326\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.030\nSo the point is, this is where you go\nto find out what's changed recently.\n\n327\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.180\nAnd keep in mind, it's quite\nlikely that one week to the next,\n\n328\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.430\nthere would be something different.\n\n329\n00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.370\nYou'll notice something has moved,\n\n330\n00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.160\ncolor scheme, design is different,\nmenu options are reversed.\n\n331\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.818\nSo It keeps you on your toes,\nI'll say that.\n\n332\n00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:47.520\nOkay, so let's stroll down into the actual\nnav menu on the left-hand side.\n\n333\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.350\nNow, like Azure, if you've used that,\nor other interfaces, there's a way to\n\n334\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:55.800\nminimize the screen real estate taken up\nby the nav menu, because depending on your\n\n335\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.440\nscreen, especially if you're using a\nsmaller device real estate is precious and\n\n336\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:07.480\nplus over time your brain will remember\nwhat these different icons are for.\n\n337\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.460\nFor example groups or\n\n338\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.520\nthe individual user there is some\nintelligence in the design of the icon.\n\n339\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.170\nAnd if you forget you just hover over and\nthere's a fly out there.\n\n340\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.450\nPersonally I like to expand it.\n\n341\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.450\nEspecially so that you can all see\n\n342\n00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.100\nwhat the different categories\nare without having to guess or wonder.\n\n343\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.500\nI mean, this looks like\nGrumpy Cat too right for users.\n\n344\n00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.010\n>> Which sometimes is the case.\n\n345\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.560\n>> That's right, sometimes I'm Grumpy Cat.\n\n346\n00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.940\nBefore my morning coffee.\n\n347\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.420\nAll right, so Active Users,\nthere's two of me.\n\n348\n00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.162\n[LAUGH] Now how did that happen?\n\n349\n00:18:43.162 --> 00:18:49.540\nBecause I just added myself earlier as\nMark Ingram1 or Mark1, so go figure.\n\n350\n00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.500\nThat's weird, I've seen some duplicates\nlately with car reservations,\n\n351\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.170\nhotel reservations that have shown up and\nthey've said, you made two reservations.\n\n352\n00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.870\nI don't I don't remember making two.\n\n353\n00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.710\nHere's another example, seeing double.\n\n354\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:04.920\nSo I can select one of the users,\nlittle MI here.\n\n355\n00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.770\nAgain, this is, you know,\nlovely ripped from Apple.\n\n356\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.440\nI would say this little\ninitials in the circle\n\n357\n00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.850\nat a glance to help you\nsee what's going on.\n\n358\n00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:19.710\nAnd I can edit a lot of parameters,\nif you like, about me.\n\n359\n00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:26.290\nFor example, my email address,\nmy product licenses.\n\n360\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.960\nSo it takes a while to\nfill out this page here.\n\n361\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.180\nSo I can enable or disable a licenses for\n\n362\n00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.930\nexample Exchange Online and\nSharePoint Online.\n\n363\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.980\nRemember, I may not, in fact I don't\nremember actually signing up for\n\n364\n00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.700\nExchange Online, plan to but it came\nin a bundle that I did sign up for.\n\n365\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.020\nAnd it's quite possible the bundle will\nhave changed since I signed up for it.\n\n366\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.810\nSo you may be in for some surprise when\nyou look at what you're licensed for.\n\n367\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.870\nIt also Also shows me because\nthe enterprise E3 license comes\n\n368\n00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.520\nwith 25 licenses,\nI have almost all of them available.\n\n369\n00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.810\n24 of 25 left to assign to a user and\n\n370\n00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:12.540\nagain I can change the licensing\nbecause maybe you know I wanna give,\n\n371\n00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.420\ngrant someone else a license for\na technology I'm not using.\n\n372\n00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.950\nOkay, group memberships,\n\n373\n00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.150\nlooks like I'm a loner right now,\nI'm a member of no groups.\n\n374\n00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.450\nSo well, that's okay.\n\n375\n00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.040\nSign in status, sign in allowed.\n\n376\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.800\nWell, this is a way to transition\nsomeone out of your organization,\n\n377\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.110\nis when they call help desk and\nsay I can't sign in.\n\n378\n00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.195\nAnd they transfer you to HR.\n\n379\n00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:38.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n380\n00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.270\nthen security escorts\nyou out of the building.\n\n381\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.360\n>> That's right.\n>> That's what they do in\n\n382\n00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.190\nthe movies, anyway.\n\n383\n00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.220\nThankfully it's never happened to me.\n\n384\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.770\nSo you could block sign in because maybe\nthere's security, something compromised.\n\n385\n00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.590\nYou think someone might have\nhacked the account, for example,\n\n386\n00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.020\nor a password's been stolen.\n\n387\n00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.050\nSo that's a quick way to avoid for\nthe damage by blocking sign in.\n\n388\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.058\nThat wouldn't be a good idea right now\nsince I'm a global admin In the O365\n\n389\n00:21:02.058 --> 00:21:06.810\ndeployment so,\nI don't want to experiment to try, but\n\n390\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.470\nrather than start a tech incident because\nI blocked myself out of the account,\n\n391\n00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.430\nI'll just leave it the way it is.\n\n392\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:17.810\nSo global admin role okay,\nno, you'll find this a lot.\n\n393\n00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:22.433\nYou think, okay, I'm in an interface, and\nI should be able to edit my own settings,\n\n394\n00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:23.987\nthat is not always the case.\n\n395\n00:21:25.656 --> 00:21:28.812\nSo, don't be surprised to see a screen\nlike this, where you'd think,\n\n396\n00:21:28.812 --> 00:21:32.010\nokay a global admin, doesn't that\nmean I have rights to do anything?\n\n397\n00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:32.950\nNot necessarily.\n\n398\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.090\n>> Hm.\n\n399\n00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:40.810\n>> Let's see, email forwarding, I could\nallow or disallow certain email apps.\n\n400\n00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:45.540\nFor example iMap, people still use that,\nit's pretty cool actually.\n\n401\n00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.290\nOr a little desktop I might wanna block\n\n402\n00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.310\nfrom being connected to this O365\nenvironment for whatever reasons.\n\n403\n00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:56.540\nAnd then now you'll see the little icon\nnext to Edit Exchange properties and\n\n404\n00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.490\nalso Manage multi factor authentication.\n\n405\n00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:59.840\nThat's gonna open up a new window.\n\n406\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:06.282\nSo let's see what happens then,\nI'll probably have to re-authenticate and\n\n407\n00:22:06.282 --> 00:22:10.121\nalso accept some more elements of\nthe page to load it correctly.\n\n408\n00:22:13.445 --> 00:22:16.658\nOkay, so here is, so you'll see interfaces\n\n409\n00:22:16.658 --> 00:22:21.490\nlike this if you've used Exchange 2013 for\nexample and later.\n\n410\n00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.190\nThe reason why these tabs\nare set up the way they are, but\n\n411\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.670\nthey don't even look like tabs cuz there's\nno traditional border around them or\n\n412\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.740\nbox, is for touch enabling.\n\n413\n00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:35.540\nSo there's theoretically enough space\naround these options you can click on,\n\n414\n00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.290\nthat you can tap them with your pen or\nfinger or whatever you use.\n\n415\n00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.030\nSo I can go to, I'm on users now.\n\n416\n00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.920\nI clicked on service settings,\nand verification options.\n\n417\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.659\nSo multifactor authentication, so we had\nan example of that when I signed up for\n\n418\n00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:51.306\nO365.\n\n419\n00:22:51.306 --> 00:22:57.779\nI had to provide a mobile number so that\na text message could be sent with a code.\n\n420\n00:22:57.779 --> 00:23:00.661\nMultifactor authentication,\nI've signed in,\n\n421\n00:23:00.661 --> 00:23:05.560\nI've given my phone number, I've now\nentered the code that came to my phone.\n\n422\n00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.640\nAnother option is to call to the phone\nnumber, or through a mobile app.\n\n423\n00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.280\nSo there's an Office 365 admin app,\nand just a regular Office 365 app, for\n\n424\n00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.090\nthe end users.\n\n425\n00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:20.600\nSo that's another way to get multi\nfactor authentication going.\n\n426\n00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.925\nAnd then you can specify\nreauthentication requirements for\n\n427\n00:23:26.925 --> 00:23:31.000\nmulti-factor authentication, so\nit's not a once only forever.\n\n428\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.536\nReauthentication is a good\nsecurity practice, so again,\n\n429\n00:23:35.536 --> 00:23:40.345\nsome combination of something you know,\nsomething you are and\n\n430\n00:23:40.345 --> 00:23:44.971\nsomething you have Is a best\npractice in terms of going beyond\n\n431\n00:23:44.971 --> 00:23:50.164\nthe potential security risks of\nsingle-factor authentication.\n\n432\n00:23:50.164 --> 00:23:53.669\nNow with Windows Hello, that's another\nway that makes it really easy for users.\n\n433\n00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:57.368\nIf you have a newer laptop, or you can\nbuy an Intel camera That it uses facial\n\n434\n00:23:57.368 --> 00:24:00.305\nrecognition to authenticate,\nthere's nothing to type,\n\n435\n00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:03.850\nit's just something you are,\nyou put your face in front of the camera.\n\n436\n00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.290\nAnd it's much improved technology from\nthe old days when you could just hold up\n\n437\n00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.270\na picture of Yoda for\nexample and we're in.\n\n438\n00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.921\nYes!\nSo a lot of testing has gone into that\n\n439\n00:24:14.921 --> 00:24:16.153\nWindows Hello, so\n\n440\n00:24:16.153 --> 00:24:20.850\nthat's a big benefit there in terms\nof multi-factor authentication.\n\n441\n00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:23.640\nOkay, what else there?\n\n442\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.610\nThat's not where I was, got a lot\nof Windows open here, that's okay.\n\n443\n00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.070\nSo similarly if I can edit Exchange\nproperties I won't show you that.\n\n444\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.165\nBut again with that little square box\nwith an arrow it means it's gonna open in\n\n445\n00:24:36.165 --> 00:24:38.140\na different window.\n\n446\n00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.460\nSo that’s all I wanna show you there.\n\n447\n00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.860\nI can change my password from here as\nwell, so nice user serviceable there.\n\n448\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.095\nStill surprised it allowed me to create\na second user with the exact same\n\n449\n00:24:49.095 --> 00:24:50.020\ninformation.\n\n450\n00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.801\nThat’s, I got to get my\nhead around that one.\n\n451\n00:24:52.801 --> 00:24:55.286\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyway two is better than zero,\n\n452\n00:24:55.286 --> 00:24:56.195\nI can say that.\n\n453\n00:24:56.195 --> 00:25:00.275\nContacts here, another,\nagain the friendlier Microsoft,\n\n454\n00:25:00.275 --> 00:25:02.940\nhere's a little computer with legs.\n\n455\n00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:08.230\nNothing here yet, and there's information\non how you can utilize contacts.\n\n456\n00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.560\nAnd going beyond contacts, so\nother ways of communicating.\n\n457\n00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.100\nSo we'll leave that there.\n\n458\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.760\nAnd then deleted users.\n\n459\n00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.230\nSo, [LAUGH], this cracks me up.\n\n460\n00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.215\nThere's nothing here,\nthat's probably okay.\n\n461\n00:25:20.215 --> 00:25:22.846\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just like if we deleted a user in\n\n462\n00:25:22.846 --> 00:25:26.815\nExchange, for example, we'd want that\nmailbox to be easily accessible.\n\n463\n00:25:26.815 --> 00:25:30.149\nOr perhaps reattachable for\nanother user replacing the user\n\n464\n00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:34.016\nwho left the organization, for\nexample, on Pat leave for 30 days.\n\n465\n00:25:34.016 --> 00:25:38.085\nSo, similarly,\nrather than simply delete and purge and\n\n466\n00:25:38.085 --> 00:25:43.016\nexpunge all data related to\na particular user that's left the firm.\n\n467\n00:25:43.016 --> 00:25:46.535\nWe gotta think it through,\nit can live in deleted users for a while.\n\n468\n00:25:46.535 --> 00:25:50.610\nBecause it's quite possible we're gonna\nwanna access contents of that mailbox.\n\n469\n00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.663\nOr simply as I said,\nattach the new user to that old user's\n\n470\n00:25:54.663 --> 00:25:59.135\nmailbox.Cuz there's a lot of\nconversation history in there,\n\n471\n00:25:59.135 --> 00:26:02.561\nthat will probably be of\nuse to the new employee.\n\n472\n00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:08.197\nAll right, under Data Migration,\nthis is a way of pulling\n\n473\n00:26:08.197 --> 00:26:14.650\ninformation from our existing\nemail account into Office 365.\n\n474\n00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.300\nThat could take a while,\n[LAUGH] as you can imagine.\n\n475\n00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.350\nBut there's a facility to do that.\n\n476\n00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.070\nWe find this a lot in Office 365.\n\n477\n00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:28.070\nWe'll also look at SharePoint Online\nadministration in a different episode.\n\n478\n00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:34.110\nA lot of what we need to do in terms of\ncoexistence with on-premises services and\n\n479\n00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.500\nserver content,\nwe could administer from the cloud.\n\n480\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.800\nSo if you're wondering where to do this,\non prem or\n\n481\n00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.350\non the cloud, always start with on cloud.\n\n482\n00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.050\nThere may be things to do on the server,\non prem.\n\n483\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:51.648\nBut all Microsoft's money, research money,\nalmost all of it is going to developing or\n\n484\n00:26:51.648 --> 00:26:57.570\nongoing development, new features in the\nCloud services, O365, SharePoint Online.\n\n485\n00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.339\nSo start there, and then if you have\nto run a script say on your on prem\n\n486\n00:27:01.339 --> 00:27:03.870\nserver you'll be given\nguidance to do that.\n\n487\n00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.679\nAnd you can typically copy and\npaste PowerShell script and\n\n488\n00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:09.940\nmake some modifications on prem.\n\n489\n00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.941\nSo we're not gonna wait for\nthis data migration dashboard to appear.\n\n490\n00:27:12.941 --> 00:27:18.100\nBut this is again this is enabling\nyou to import your mail into O365.\n\n491\n00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:23.510\nAnd the last thing I'll say for\nthis episode is on groups.\n\n492\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.750\nSo we have the ability to add a group,\nthere's that lonely computer again, and\n\n493\n00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.400\nwe have some options\nwhen it comes to group.\n\n494\n00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.850\nDo we want to make it an Office 365 group?\n\n495\n00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.950\nIs it a distribution list?\n\n496\n00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:39.180\nSo we've looked at in other episodes,\nthe community site template\n\n497\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.020\nas a better alternative to\ndistribution lists in some cases.\n\n498\n00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.991\nBut there still may be a need in your\norganization for distribution lists,\n\n499\n00:27:46.991 --> 00:27:48.320\nyou can create it there.\n\n500\n00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.860\nLet's see what happens if I\nclick on Office 365 group.\n\n501\n00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.628\nThe usual, what we'd expect,\nwhether we're doing it on prem or\n\n502\n00:27:57.628 --> 00:28:01.281\nnot, give it a name, and\nlet's call it Grouper.\n\n503\n00:28:01.281 --> 00:28:02.760\nIs that a fish?\n\n504\n00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.340\n>> It is, a very tasty one.\n\n505\n00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.910\n>> A tasty fish, cool.\n\n506\n00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.625\n[LAUGH] Doesn't taste like chicken,\nlet's call it groupergroup.\n\n507\n00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.460\nI know, it's silly, so\n\n508\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.210\nthe portion of the email address after\nthe at symbol is already populated there.\n\n509\n00:28:20.308 --> 00:28:24.750\nAnd I can give a description, and\nthen I can set privacy settings.\n\n510\n00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.700\nCan only members, so\nit's sort of a secret group that way,\n\n511\n00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.710\nonly members can see the group content.\n\n512\n00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.240\nOr can anyone see that group content?\n\n513\n00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.730\nGive it a language, and\nthen somebody needs to own the group and\n\n514\n00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:43.030\nbe able to send messages to the group,\nmaybe approve or reject member requests.\n\n515\n00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.320\nNow we see this screen here.\n\n516\n00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.320\nSo adding a group,\nyour group is being created.\n\n517\n00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.640\nIt can take up to a minute for\nthe group to be ready.\n\n518\n00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.170\nThis is a very common\nkind of feedback you get.\n\n519\n00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:57.960\nDuring any changes, additions, deletions,\nwhatever you're doing in the cloud\n\n520\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.020\nenvironment often it might take an hour or\nmore.\n\n521\n00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.480\nIn this case it was a very fast item,\nless than a minute.\n\n522\n00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.630\nIt might take an hour,\ntwo hours to provision.\n\n523\n00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.700\nEspecially when you're provisioning\nSharePoint Online for the first time.\n\n524\n00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:12.261\nYou see this gray outline, and\nthen it says we're getting it ready.\n\n525\n00:29:12.261 --> 00:29:16.720\nSo don't expect instant results when\nyou're working O365 and SharePoint Online.\n\n526\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.899\nBut certainly by the next day or if you do\nsomething at the end of the day at work\n\n527\n00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:22.000\nwhen you come in in the morning,\nit'll be ready.\n\n528\n00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.328\nSo you're not gonna get the instant\ngratification that you're probably used to\n\n529\n00:29:26.328 --> 00:29:27.800\nwith on prem environment.\n\n530\n00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.734\nThings go on, there may be a service\ndown which prevents you from creating or\n\n531\n00:29:32.734 --> 00:29:36.910\nadding that new service like Skype for\nBusiness, for example.\n\n532\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.880\nBut it does make it very clear in\nthe feedback in the dashboard there that,\n\n533\n00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.300\nokay, it's in process.\n\n534\n00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.700\nYou're not left wondering, did that work,\ndo I have to redo anything?\n\n535\n00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.200\n>> Fantastic, all right, really good look\nthere at the interface that we get once\n\n536\n00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.010\nwe've created that\nOffice 365 subscription.\n\n537\n00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.960\nAnd then we go back in to administer that.\n\n538\n00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.460\nSo we thank you for that, Mark.\n\n539\n00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.790\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n540\n00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.130\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n541\n00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.041\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n542\n00:30:01.041 --> 00:30:03.460\n>> And we'll see you next

at ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.370\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and today we\nare doing our advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.060\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.360\nwe're gonna be continuing on with\nour Office 365 administration.\n\n7\n00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.500\nWe've already done a part one, so if you\nmissed that make sure you go back and\n\n8\n00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.120\nwatch our first, it'll make this\nepisode make a little more sense.\n\n9\n00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.530\nHere to continue on exploring the\nOffice365 Administration Interface, and\n\n10\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.500\nsome other really cool stuff,\nis mister Mark Ingram.\n\n11\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.230\nHow you doing Mark?\n\n12\n00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.550\n>> Good, Mike.\nThanks very much.\n\n13\n00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.080\nYeah!\nSo\n\n14\n00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.780\nwhen we finished off last time,\nwe were in the middle of groups.\n\n15\n00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.130\nAnd now in this little bell\nnotification icon here,\n\n16\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.890\nin the upper right,\nIt reminds you that I've joined the group.\n\n17\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.600\nNice, its a grouper group.\n\n18\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.750\n>> Good, grouper group.\n\n19\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.580\n>> It's not grouper, is it?\n\n20\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.740\n>> I don't think so.\n\n21\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.640\n>> Okay.\nNow if I click on that,\n\n22\n00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.680\nit wants me to reauthenticate.\n\n23\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.660\nYou can see a bunch of other\naccounts that have used.\n\n24\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.820\nNow, It's not letting be close it.\n\n25\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.580\nOkay.\n\n26\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.059\nThat's odd that went somewhere\ncompletely different.\n\n27\n00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:14.618\n>> Nice!\n\n28\n00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:16.220\n>> That's annoying!\n\n29\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.495\n>> It's probably a little frustrated\nwe left it sitting during lunch.\n\n30\n00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:20.540\n[LAUGH]\n>> feels neglected!\n\n31\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.220\n>> It was feeling lonely, so\nnow its going to mess with us I guess.\n\n32\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.400\n>> So you might have seen\nsimilar notifications working in\n\n33\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.300\nserver manager on-prem, for example, you\ndo something and it appears in task view,\n\n34\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.680\nand you can dismiss it, I dismiss all\nhere, because I don't need to be reminded.\n\n35\n00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.640\n>> And it could be handy though.\n\n36\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.520\nIn this case, we were the ones\nthat added to the group, right,\n\n37\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.460\nbut what if you were added to a group and\nit wasn't you that did the adding?\n\n38\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.390\nYou log in, and hey, you're now part of\nthis group, and you can go explore and\n\n39\n00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.430\nfind new resources maybe that\nare available to that group.\n\n40\n00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.480\n>> Excellent point, and one of my\nFacebook beef's somewhat off topic\n\n41\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.870\nhere is the ability of people to add me\nto groups that I never gave consent too.\n\n42\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.490\nSo it's another reason to check.\n\n43\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.010\nYou might not want to\nbe associated with that\n\n44\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.280\nbocci ball Friday league\n>> Anybody been added to that group.\n\n45\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.560\nSo, that's a good point.\n\n46\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.180\nSo shared mailboxes is\nnext on the left here.\n\n47\n00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.700\nAnd the purpose of shared mailboxes.\n\n48\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.020\nIt's good for support.\n\n49\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.560\nHelp desk kind of scenarios where maybe\nyou've got three shifts in a twenty-four\n\n50\n00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.520\nhour period.\n\n51\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.480\nIt doesn't matter who answers\nthe support reques just anyone.\n\n52\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.870\nSo multiple people could have access to\nthe shared mailbox, either online here or\n\n53\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.810\nthrough their email client, and\nhandle the help desk request for example.\n\n54\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.560\nLet's go to resources now, I gonna close\nup the groups just to make the screen\n\n55\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.020\nlittle less cluttered and\nrooms and equipments.\n\n56\n00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.840\nSo this might be familiar if\nyou were working with Exchange\n\n57\n00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.280\nat all\n>> The ability to\n\n58\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.760\nreserve rooms and equipment.\n\n59\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.320\nI guess I haven't authenticated for\na while, so I have to reauthenticate.\n\n60\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.020\nMeanwhile, there's a traffic scene\nin the background, how relaxing.\n\n61\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.065\n[LAUGH] It wasn't totally crowded,\nthat's good.\n\n62\n00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:09.675\n>> That was my password,\ndot dot dot dot dot dot dot.\n\n63\n00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:11.197\n>> Amazing!\nI have to change it now.\n\n64\n00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:15.845\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Delirium is setting in.\n\n65\n00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:19.995\nAll right, so now I've authenticated\nit back to where I was trying to get\n\n66\n00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:23.680\noriginally, and\nI can click on Add Room, and\n\n67\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.750\nthen specify so a concept that might\nbe tricky to get your head around,\n\n68\n00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.779\nif you're not normally\nexchanging in background.\n\n69\n00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.562\nIs that you can literally email a room.\n\n70\n00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:33.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n71\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.560\n>> As a resource to reserve it,\nor any assets.\n\n72\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.410\nSo maybe there's a funky vehicle\nyou need that there's only\n\n73\n00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.030\none of in the organization.\n\n74\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.940\nYou could also reserve that asset and\nschedule it in\n\n75\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.790\nto a calendar application as well, similar\nto with equipment here, projector is on.\n\n76\n00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.710\nMaybe a projector that can move\nbetween rooms on a mobile cart,\n\n77\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.280\nthey may wanna reserve that.\n\n78\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.659\nSo that's useful, and let's go to sites.\n\n79\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.290\nIt's just gonna give an enumeration\nof sites, very useful sometimes,\n\n80\n00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.160\nif you forget the URL of where you're\ntrying to go, maybe you have it favorited,\n\n81\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.720\nmaybe not.\n\n82\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.180\nMaybe you closed out the browser\ntab accidentally and\n\n83\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.740\nyou can't remember exactly where\nyou were to get back to the URL.\n\n84\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.990\nWell this way you get a listing of sites\nhere, and they're linkable as you'd expect\n\n85\n00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.640\nso I can just click on them, and\nit also shows the sharing status.\n\n86\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.480\nSo, whether links are shared,\nwhether I can invite someone to\n\n87\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.270\nparticipate in that site, or not, that's\nuseful, public website, this is cool.\n\n88\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.060\nSo, in this course, we've looked\nat how useful SharePoint can be,\n\n89\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.230\nin terms of being an Intranet portal,\nalso an Extranet portal, and\n\n90\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.510\nan Intranet portal-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n91\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.760\n>> For different user populations\n>> Employees, partners through Extranet,\n\n92\n00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.670\nand maybe customers anonymously\naccessing an Internet portal.\n\n93\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.490\nWell, in this case, with Office 365,\nwe're using third party providers.\n\n94\n00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.960\nAnd the providers that show up\non this screen relate to your\n\n95\n00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.410\noriginal country that you entered when\nyou signed up for your own 365 account.\n\n96\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.420\nSo, in other words, I sign up in the US.\n\n97\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.190\nI think it was US, whatever it was,\nit might have been Canada, William Canada.\n\n98\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.110\nAnyways, GoDaddy and Wix are the partner\norganizations to create public sites and\n\n99\n00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.320\nthey're all kosher.\n\n100\n00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.200\nThey're experienced with setting people\nup with O365 with integration for\n\n101\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.090\nthe public facing site, so then you\ncan learn more by following links for\n\n102\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.399\nthose third party vendors.\n\n103\n00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.990\nOkay, I'll go back to where I was.\n\n104\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.840\nSo that's public website\nmobile management.\n\n105\n00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.010\nThis is kind of neat because\n\n106\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.130\nagain organizations that\nhave moving to the cloud, so\n\n107\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.750\nyou might have been using System Center\nConfiguration manager on premises.\n\n108\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.410\nFor inventory,\ndeploying software and updates, and\n\n109\n00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.790\nestablishing security settings and\nrestrictions on company owned devices.\n\n110\n00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.840\nEven the BYOD kind of environment where\nthe user brings their own device, but\n\n111\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.230\nit's also used for business reasons.\n\n112\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.150\nSo we can, with Windows Intune,\nwe can in mobile device management,\n\n113\n00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.470\nwe can have control over those\ndevices from an internet portal here.\n\n114\n00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.690\nSo control in mobile access, the ability\nto apply restrictions for example,\n\n115\n00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.360\nrequire a pin or password when\nthe user Starts up their machine,\n\n116\n00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.120\nthe ability to block Bluetooth or\nmaybe wi-fi connections, so\n\n117\n00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.300\nyou get some kinda control\nfrom the MDM Portal here.\n\n118\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.760\nAnd then let's say an employee leaves,\n\n119\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.210\nyou want the ability to\nwipe only corporate data.\n\n120\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.750\nSo I'm bringing my tablet for example,\nto work for a three month contract,\n\n121\n00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.860\nthe contract ends and then the\norganization can wipe just the corporate\n\n122\n00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.340\ndata and applications from my device,\nnot touching all my personal apps and\n\n123\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.820\ndata I brought into the organization\nBefore working for it.\n\n124\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.100\nSo the point is you can do this\nremotely with mobile device management.\n\n125\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.980\nKind of cool.\n\n126\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.200\nNow where was I?\n\n127\n00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.210\nKey question I ask myself.\n\n128\n00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.710\nSo that's it for resources there,\nnow let's go down to Billing.\n\n129\n00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.850\nSo, here's where I can find out\nmy subscriptions as we look at\n\n130\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.410\nin the different episode, there\nare all kinds of subscription options.\n\n131\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.280\nIt's nice to get a handle\non what's active for me and\n\n132\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.410\nthe ability to also add subscriptions here\nin the upper right by clicking on that\n\n133\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.910\nbutton, and then let down the lower\nleft I can assign licenses.\n\n134\n00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.650\nRemember, I'd only assign\none of a possible 25.\n\n135\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.430\nSo, here's where I can Move forward\nwith getting other people involved in\n\n136\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:36.370\nthe enterprise E3 trial,\nmore actions button down here.\n\n137\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.040\nI can cancel the trial,\nlet's say I'm going a different direction,\n\n138\n00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.500\nin that case I can choose\nto Click on cancel trial,\n\n139\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.200\nbecause maybe I'm actually able to go\nahead but I don't want to use the E3 plan.\n\n140\n00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.350\nI want to use a different plan.\n\n141\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.848\nSo I'll cancel this trial and\ntry this plan.\n\n142\n00:07:51.848 --> 00:07:55.827\nThere's also ways of transitioning\nbetween license types,\n\n143\n00:07:55.827 --> 00:08:00.186\ndifferent ways to go there, and\nthen there's a build section, and\n\n144\n00:08:00.186 --> 00:08:05.231\nyou can filter by say, a monthly A monthly\nfilter and the month of the year, and\n\n145\n00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:10.460\nthere's, like many things in the O365\ninterface, there's often a delay.\n\n146\n00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.380\nIn this case there's a 24 hour\ndelay between purchase and\n\n147\n00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.660\nwhat you purchase showing up here.\n\n148\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.420\nAnd then there's a Licences tab.\n\n149\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.440\nHere's my Office 365\nEnterprise E3 license.\n\n150\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.760\nIf I click on purchase services, of course\nMicrosoft wants to make it easy for\n\n151\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.820\nyou to buy more, more of everything and\nI already briefly went over\n\n152\n00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.500\nthe options here and just the fact that\nthere are a lot of them especially and\n\n153\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.210\nnotice how you get different subscription\nbundles and you can buy now or\n\n154\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.670\nlearn more about any given package,\nenterprise you want for example.\n\n155\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.480\nWe already covered that\nin a previous episode.\n\n156\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.710\nBilling notifications--\nhere's me doubling up again,\n\n157\n00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.120\nI don't know why I'm in duplicate.\n\n158\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.560\nI haven't troubleshot that but\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n159\n00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.930\nWho gets the invoice, in other words,\ntypically the accountants.\n\n160\n00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.950\nLet's go down into the support section\nnow, so this we could tell it's gonna open\n\n161\n00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.770\nanother tab because of the little symbol\nnext to it, the rectangle and the arrow.\n\n162\n00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.910\nSo I could see the health, so\nbefore I create a service request,\n\n163\n00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:18.010\nit makes sense to know whether the service\nis up in general in Microsoft's world\n\n164\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.920\nBecause there is no point in\npiling on with service request,\n\n165\n00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.580\nwhen the outage is probably affecting\ntens of thousands of users.\n\n166\n00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.520\nIn that case,\nthere would be some detail and\n\n167\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.290\npossibly an estimated time of resolution,\nbut at least some more detail.\n\n168\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.180\nAnd notice how there's some options\nto create service requests for\n\n169\n00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:42.020\nvarious elements, both 365,\nidentity management, mail.\n\n170\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.860\nSo you can narrow it down rather\nthan just a general request.\n\n171\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.240\nAnd then there's a link there\nto see all support tickets.\n\n172\n00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.330\nSo that's another option you have.\n\n173\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.070\nAnd I could get to that screen by\nclicking on Service Requests if I had any\n\n174\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.930\noutstanding service requests.\n\n175\n00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.950\nCheck their resolution state.\n\n176\n00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:05.147\nGoing down to the settings section,\nServices and add-ins.\n\n177\n00:10:05.147 --> 00:10:06.860\nOkay, so.\n\n178\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.870\nEarlier this week,\nwe've talked about apps, and\n\n179\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.750\nhow things that probably make\nmore sense call it what they are,\n\n180\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.990\ndocument libraries, lists,\nforms libraries, everything's an app.\n\n181\n00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:23.690\nWell we're changing that again, so now,\n[LAUGH] now apps are called add ins.\n\n182\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.640\nSo you'll probably see, actually in the\nportal you will see references to apps and\n\n183\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.785\nadd ins,\njust to keep it as confusing as possible.\n\n184\n00:10:30.785 --> 00:10:31.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I\n\n185\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.610\ndon't come up with these marketing terms.\n\n186\n00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.300\nBut anyway, add ins,\napps, same kind of idea.\n\n187\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.210\nSo functionality can be\nrepresented via an add in like\n\n188\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.430\nAzure multi factor authentication.\n\n189\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:47.130\nSo the finger print here implies some\nkind of biometric authentication.\n\n190\n00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.830\nWe already talked about\ngetting texted to your\n\n191\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.470\nphone as a form of multi\nfactor authentication.\n\n192\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:59.660\nWindows Hello for biometric or face\nrecognition, Calendar, Rights Management.\n\n193\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.400\nSo all these are considered add-ins,\nSkype for Business, so\n\n194\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.650\nwe'll be looking at the individual\nApplications, as part\n\n195\n00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.845\nof the normal Office suite, and some new\ntechnologies as well in a later episode.\n\n196\n00:11:12.845 --> 00:11:14.580\n[INAUDIBLE] Different episode,\nfor example,\n\n197\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.810\nSway, that's a little teaser there.\n\n198\n00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.950\nYou're thinking okay what is Sway?\n\n199\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.990\nTune in and see.\n\n200\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:24.060\nSo security, and privacy,\njust like on prem,\n\n201\n00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.540\nwe'd have a password expiration policy.\n\n202\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.120\nAnd presumably a lead time where\nusers are notified before they have\n\n203\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.340\nto make the change.\n\n204\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.120\nAnd then, do you want to let\npeople reset their own passwords?\n\n205\n00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.770\nI think it's a great idea, unless you\nhave a Help Desk that's bored and\n\n206\n00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.538\nwaiting for calls.\n\n207\n00:11:38.538 --> 00:11:41.243\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n208\n00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:42.700\nDomains.\n\n209\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.200\nSo here's the domain I originally set up.\n\n210\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.990\nNotice how it ends with onmicrosoft.com,\nwhich is how it starts out.\n\n211\n00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.170\nYou can modify that later.\n\n212\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.340\nSet up complete, that's good to know,\nI could add an additional domain here.\n\n213\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:00.060\nNow the organization profile tab\nwould reveal personal information,\n\n214\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.870\nyou know phone number, address,\ninformation I used to register\n\n215\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.945\nmy own 365 account which we\nalso obscured from you earlier.\n\n216\n00:12:06.945 --> 00:12:08.250\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n217\n00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.880\nthat's where you can see what it is.\n\n218\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.920\nMake sure it's accurate.\n\n219\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.330\nPartner Relationships.\n\n220\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.540\nThis is very useful.\n\n221\n00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.230\nJust like you might give your accountant\nthe ability to talk to the IRS on your\n\n222\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:22.390\nbehalf, well, similarly you could\nspecify a Microsoft partner here and\n\n223\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.640\nthey get specified as a partner of record.\n\n224\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.620\nWhich means, again, they can go to bat for\n\n225\n00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.530\nyou with Microsoft so\nyou don't spend your time on hold.\n\n226\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.490\nTo trouble shoot some issue that\nyour partner is better qualified or\n\n227\n00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.770\nat least your basically outsourcing that\nfunction to them because presumably they\n\n228\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.510\nhave a lot of Office 365 clients\nin the in their practice and\n\n229\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:45.505\nthey're used to talking to the right\npeople to get action, moving forward for\n\n230\n00:12:45.505 --> 00:12:46.395\nwhatever your problem might be.\n\n231\n00:12:46.395 --> 00:12:48.375\nYou don't have to specify\na partner relationship, but\n\n232\n00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:49.615\nthat's where you would put that info.\n\n233\n00:12:49.615 --> 00:12:53.333\nSo, when they call Microsoft,\nthey answer some security questions and\n\n234\n00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:58.015\nthey're allowed to interact,\nrepresenting you.\n\n235\n00:12:58.015 --> 00:12:59.585\nWhat do they call it in the election?\n\n236\n00:12:59.585 --> 00:13:00.595\nA surrogate?\n\n237\n00:13:00.595 --> 00:13:03.255\nThat sounds like a weird word,\nbut they can be your surrogate.\n\n238\n00:13:03.255 --> 00:13:06.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> I guess talking about email in\n\n239\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.030\nthe presidential election is maybe\nnot the best sensitive topic.\n\n240\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.600\nMoving on, reports.\n\n241\n00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.970\nWe can get into usage here.\n\n242\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.860\nAll right,\nthis is very useful because you could\n\n243\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.830\nend up spending more money that\nyou expected in Office 365.\n\n244\n00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.850\nIf you get silly and just decide to port\neverything from On Prem to Office 365 that\n\n245\n00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.940\ncould get very expensive.\n\n246\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.260\nMaybe your boss told you to do that and\nyou said no we shouldn't do that because,\n\n247\n00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.030\nand they said just do it,\nand we said okay fine.\n\n248\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.890\nAnd this is where you can get some\nammunition saying okay what we spent in\n\n249\n00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:40.910\nthe last seven days.\n\n250\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.510\nAnd that will peek your\nbosses interest for sure.\n\n251\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:51.670\nSo specifically relating to email\nactivity, now because I just set this up\n\n252\n00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.580\nReports, the, well first of all\nthere's no emails I've sent.\n\n253\n00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.430\nSo it says preparing data for\nyour reports, check back again soon.\n\n254\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.540\nSo especially the first time you\nspun something up In the old\n\n255\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.920\n365 realm there can be a lag before\nthere's information to report on it.\n\n256\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.710\nBut then over time it'll be consistently\nthere and you can go back one month,\n\n257\n00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:15.440\nsix months, or three months for\nin that case, email activity.\n\n258\n00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.930\nNow there's a bread crumb trail up there.\n\n259\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:21.160\nI just clicked on a different link\nthere so I can navigate back.\n\n260\n00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.460\nI can get a OneDrive file Storage usage,\nSkype activity,\n\n261\n00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.790\ncalling behaviour that kind of thing.\n\n262\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.810\nMeeting activities.\n\n263\n00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.980\nOffice activations.\n\n264\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.450\nSo these are useful reports, there's even\na tour which would pop up in a new window.\n\n265\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.510\nSo make it User friendly for you.\n\n266\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.570\nSecurity and compliance.\n\n267\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.460\nOkay, so this is a nice dashboard here,\n\n268\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.510\nthis is a completely separate console as\nwell for security compliance which we will\n\n269\n00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:56.660\ngo to very soon and what we have\nhere is sections for auditing,\n\n270\n00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.850\nso non-owners that access the mailbox,\nwhy are they accessing the mailbox?\n\n271\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.090\nThat could be shady and worth auditing.\n\n272\n00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.070\nLitigation holds.\n\n273\n00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.860\nSo in a different episode\nwe looked at eDiscovery and\n\n274\n00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.490\nplacing holds on content\nlike email messages, files.\n\n275\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:18.259\nTop senders and recipients,\nmalware related reports.\n\n276\n00:15:19.614 --> 00:15:20.850\nDLP.\n\n277\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.430\nSo data loss prevention.\n\n278\n00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.510\nSo you can set up rules.\n\n279\n00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.390\nAnd again Could be doing this for\nexchange for some years now.\n\n280\n00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:31.480\nWhere you can set up rules, say if\na number pattern matching a popular credit\n\n281\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.810\ncard, is about to be sent\noutside the organization.\n\n282\n00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.710\nThen there's a block on that or\n\n283\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.070\nat least a message that the user\nwould have to acknowledge.\n\n284\n00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.430\nYou know, something like,\n\n285\n00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:45.180\nit looks like you are about to send credit\ncard information, do you want to do this?\n\n286\n00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.140\nSo, someone might have to click OK or\n\n287\n00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.900\nyou can prevent anything resembling\na credit card number from leaving.\n\n288\n00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.820\nSo, those are some of the things you can\nconfigure with data loss prevention.\n\n289\n00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.799\nOkay, let's go into health now.\n\n290\n00:15:57.799 --> 00:16:01.156\nScroll down here, so Service Health.\n\n291\n00:16:01.156 --> 00:16:02.403\nWe're all good.\n\n292\n00:16:02.403 --> 00:16:06.468\nI think we looked at this before somewhere\nelse if memory serves correctly.\n\n293\n00:16:06.468 --> 00:16:09.000\nSo we'll skip past there\nto message center.\n\n294\n00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.040\nIt all becomes a blur after a while.\n\n295\n00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.180\nNo messages looks like.\n\n296\n00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:22.800\nRecently added, we looked at that so\nthat was the updates to O365 interface.\n\n297\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.670\nNow the admin centers, this is kinda cool.\n\n298\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.800\nWe're gonna cover this in this episode.\n\n299\n00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.560\nWe'll have a separate couple of\nepisodes just for SharePoint online.\n\n300\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.640\nBut because we're often tasked with\nintegrating multiple server products so\n\n301\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.080\nwe're the point person for\na variety of technologies cloud hosted.\n\n302\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.989\nIt makes sense to have\na look at some of these.\n\n303\n00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:44.000\nNot Exchange but SharePoint we'll get to.\n\n304\n00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.280\nI do want to show you security and\n\n305\n00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:52.122\ncompliance which I already have open in\nanother tab, so I'll go there right now.\n\n306\n00:16:52.122 --> 00:16:57.010\nNow, this is cool,\nbecause there's perspective guidance based\n\n307\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.895\non what parameters you specify,\nso if I say region North America,\n\n308\n00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:06.890\nit's gonna change this up here to,\nlets say Engineering and Save.\n\n309\n00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.470\nNow it says my settings are saved,\nnow I can look at compliance reports,\n\n310\n00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.830\ntrust documents and audited controls.\n\n311\n00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.540\nWhich are down under\nService Assurance here.\n\n312\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:26.010\nOkay, so Microsoft's contract with\nthird party companies and they\n\n313\n00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.390\ndepending on the region you selected, and\nyour industry, will give you compliance\n\n314\n00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:35.460\nreports that your industry would be under\nlegal obligation to be in compliance with.\n\n315\n00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.779\nSo, then we can scroll down,\nfor example, GRCSS Reports.\n\n316\n00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:40.714\nWow.\n\n317\n00:17:40.714 --> 00:17:42.479\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:43.494\n>> We're not gonna cover\n\n319\n00:17:43.494 --> 00:17:44.350\nthese,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.600\n>> You'll be glad to know\n\n321\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.040\n>> Trust documents, so we've also got\n\n322\n00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.790\ninformation, frequently asked questions,\nwhite papers related to Azure compliance,\n\n323\n00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:59.825\nsecurity considerations for Office 365,\nrisk management reports are there as well.\n\n324\n00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:04.665\nSo, maybe it's not you, the O365\nadmins responsible for this, but in\n\n325\n00:18:04.665 --> 00:18:07.645\na larger organisation you'd certainly have\na Compliance Officer and that's their job,\n\n326\n00:18:07.645 --> 00:18:11.505\nto pour through these standards and\nmake sure they're in compliance,\n\n327\n00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:16.060\nyour organisation's in compliance and\nready to answer any auditors questions.\n\n328\n00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.300\nHave you ever been to an audit?\n\n329\n00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.877\nIt's one of the least fun things.\n\n330\n00:18:18.877 --> 00:18:20.903\nA root canal might be more pleasurable,\n\n331\n00:18:20.903 --> 00:18:24.790\nespecially when the auditors sort of\nparked in your office for a month or two.\n\n332\n00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.895\nThey have their own desk and office,\npeople bringing them coffee,\n\n333\n00:18:27.895 --> 00:18:29.700\nmeantime they can cause you real harm.\n\n334\n00:18:31.015 --> 00:18:36.590\nAnyway, audited control, so\nagain this list will be dependent\n\n335\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.940\non the region and industry you selected\nearlier down in the settings section.\n\n336\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.480\nSo ISO standards, for example.\n\n337\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.350\nAnd then if you decide to change,\n\n338\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.430\nyou're fed up with the regulation of\nNorth America, and you say, you know what?\n\n339\n00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.318\nI'm moving to Brazil.\n\n340\n00:18:52.318 --> 00:18:55.010\n[LAUGH] I don't think that would\nbe less regulated, frankly.\n\n341\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.530\nBut the point is you can change the region\nby clicking save at that point.\n\n342\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.470\nOkay, so those are, what else do we have?\n\n343\n00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.650\nAlerts are configured as well.\n\n344\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.954\nWe can figure for security compliance,\nsecurity policies here,\n\n345\n00:19:06.954 --> 00:19:09.196\nday loss prevention, I alluded to earlier.\n\n346\n00:19:09.196 --> 00:19:12.390\nPolicies for data management for\narchiving and retention.\n\n347\n00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.450\nSo some of these concepts we discussed and\nI've demoed in advanced course and\n\n348\n00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.079\nthe basic SharePoint course.\n\n349\n00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:21.397\nPrinciples still apply online.\n\n350\n00:19:21.397 --> 00:19:22.499\nSearch & Investigation.\n\n351\n00:19:22.499 --> 00:19:26.210\nAgain, e-discovery,\nwe had a demo for that.\n\n352\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.656\nSimilar principles online.\n\n353\n00:19:28.656 --> 00:19:30.189\nThe interface is slightly different but\n\n354\n00:19:30.189 --> 00:19:32.090\nnot different enough to\nwarrant a whole new demo.\n\n355\n00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:37.900\nIf you get the principles on-prem you'll\nbe able to perform that activity online.\n\n356\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.309\nOkay, that's all I say about security and\ncompliance.\n\n357\n00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.520\nThe last interface or\n\n358\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.740\nadmin center I wanted to talk to you\nabout that's related to Office 365 and\n\n359\n00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:52.950\naccessible from admin center menu is\nthe Skype for Business admin center.\n\n360\n00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.070\nSo there's a dashboard here.\n\n361\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:20:00.000\nWe got some resources in the upper right\nand some community resources there.\n\n362\n00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.908\nThere's forums and\nblog websites from the Users tab.\n\n363\n00:20:05.908 --> 00:20:09.318\nNow here's the one and only user,\nyours truly, with my email address and\n\n364\n00:20:09.318 --> 00:20:10.420\nthe location in the US.\n\n365\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.720\nThere's an Organization tab here.\n\n366\n00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.450\nOkay, so this is a privacy concern.\n\n367\n00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:23.000\nMy presence, do I want to expose that\nto people just in my contacts list?\n\n368\n00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.190\nOr should anyone, accessing a meeting for\nexample, or communicate with me on Skype,\n\n369\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.460\nshould anyone else also be\nable to see my presence.\n\n370\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.910\nMobile phone notifications.\n\n371\n00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:39.595\nThere's Push Notifications here,\nso I may want to receive that.\n\n372\n00:20:39.595 --> 00:20:45.680\nSo alerts for instant messages,\nvoicemail messages, missed calls.\n\n373\n00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.325\nSo, for me, personally I like\nto keep Skype totally separate.\n\n374\n00:20:48.325 --> 00:20:52.817\nI don't want to have Skype related\ninfo permeating text messages, emails,\n\n375\n00:20:52.817 --> 00:20:54.681\nI just like to keep it separate,\n\n376\n00:20:54.681 --> 00:20:57.810\nso your organization policy\nmay be different there.\n\n377\n00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.540\nDial in conferencing, so\n\n378\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.910\nthe ability to give users\na Microsoft conferencing bridge, and\n\n379\n00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.630\nthere's bridge settings you can setup\nif you've setup a Microsoft bridge.\n\n380\n00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.815\nYou might use a third party provider.\n\n381\n00:21:09.815 --> 00:21:13.437\nSo often when you're running online\nmeetings people have the ability to use\n\n382\n00:21:13.437 --> 00:21:16.790\ncomputer audio or phone in a separate\nnumber to get the audio that way.\n\n383\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.830\nThat's what these settings are related\nto and the dial in users here.\n\n384\n00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.820\nOnline meetings,\nwe can specify a URL for our logo.\n\n385\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.960\nA help button URL, legal, and\nsome footer text as well.\n\n386\n00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.890\nAnd then various tools, this is useful.\n\n387\n00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.860\nWe've got a Skype for\nBusiness Connectivity Analyzer tool.\n\n388\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.850\nThis is really useful because there's so\nmany moving parts with online meetings.\n\n389\n00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:47.180\nSo many variables in terms of devices,\ntimezones, quality of signal,\n\n390\n00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.520\ngiving control to presenters, there's all\nkinds of variables, so it's nice to have\n\n391\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.530\nan Analyzer Tool which will take care of\nthe most common problems you may have and\n\n392\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.780\ngive prescriptive guidance, or\nautomatically take corrective action.\n\n393\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.910\nThere's also\nRemote Connectivity Analyzing here.\n\n394\n00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.229\nThis is testing the connection\nto Microsoft's O365 DNS servers.\n\n395\n00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.060\nAnd also link for setting up Skype for\nBusiness Online external communications.\n\n396\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.747\nSo this is for communicating via Skype\nwith users outside the organization that\n\n397\n00:22:16.747 --> 00:22:18.626\nmaybe involved in the meeting.\n\n398\n00:22:18.626 --> 00:22:23.544\nThere's a call quality dashboard as well,\nso you can be aware of call quality\n\n399\n00:22:23.544 --> 00:22:27.150\nissues before people start\nIMing you during meetings.\n\n400\n00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.540\nI can't hear you or the quality\nis bad It's best to be proactive.\n\n401\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.180\nSo we've seen a lot of service\nhealth dashboards in O365 so far and\n\n402\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.701\nit would give reason.\n\n403\n00:22:38.717 --> 00:22:39.709\n>> All right, Mark.\n\n404\n00:22:39.709 --> 00:22:44.381\nFantastic, again we're just\ncontinuing a look on that Office 365,\n\n405\n00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:49.436\nadministration interface, and as well as\ntaking a look at some of the Skype for\n\n406\n00:22:49.436 --> 00:22:52.285\nBusiness Integration with Office 365.\n\n407\n00:22:52.285 --> 00:22:54.975\nSo we thank you for that,\nMark, appreciate it.\n\n408\n00:22:54.975 --> 00:22:56.665\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n409\n00:22:56.665 --> 00:22:59.205\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n410\n00:22:59.205 --> 00:22:59.965\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n411\n00:22:59.965 --> 00:23:02.335\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n412\n00:23:02.335 --> 00:23:07.686\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:20.467\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:24.572\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at the SharePoint Online\n\n5\n00:00:24.572 --> 00:00:25.650\ninterface, right?\n\n6\n00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.050\nWe've already spent some time dealing\nwith SharePoint On-Premises and\n\n7\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.649\nsome other online technologies.\n\n8\n00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.565\nNow we want to see what we can do with\nthe SharePoint Online administration\n\n9\n00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:34.540\ninterface.\n\n10\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.960\nAnd here to guide us through that is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n11\n00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.820\nHow you doing Mark?\n\n12\n00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.450\n>> Good Mike, thanks very much.\n\n13\n00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.000\nYeah, let's continue on.\n\n14\n00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.432\nSo we've talked about Office 365\ninterfaces relating to Exchange,\n\n15\n00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:51.064\nsecurity and compliance, even Azure AD,\nso no technology is an island.\n\n16\n00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:55.152\nSo even if you were charged solely\nwith SharePoint administration and\n\n17\n00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:59.723\nwere involved with no other technologies\nyou'd still need to know those other\n\n18\n00:00:59.723 --> 00:01:00.708\ntechnologies.\n\n19\n00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:04.693\nBecause SharePoint interfaces so many ways\nwith different other, both Microsoft and\n\n20\n00:01:04.693 --> 00:01:06.232\nnon-Microsoft technologies.\n\n21\n00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.697\nSo now we've looked at those other\noptions there under admin centers,\n\n22\n00:01:09.697 --> 00:01:12.653\nnow we're gonna go and\nopen up the SharePoint admin center.\n\n23\n00:01:12.653 --> 00:01:16.652\nAnd you'll see right away the differences,\nand I'll talk about them and show you,\n\n24\n00:01:16.652 --> 00:01:18.682\nbetween the SharePoint Online version and\n\n25\n00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:21.910\nthe On-Premises version which\nwe've been using up to this point.\n\n26\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:30.007\nSo click on that link, and\nwe get to the SharePoint admin center.\n\n27\n00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:31.189\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n28\n00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.205\n>> So you can see right away that the\nribbon is minimalist compared to On-Prem.\n\n29\n00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.904\nNow if you recall our\narchitecture conversation,\n\n30\n00:01:39.904 --> 00:01:42.106\nmight wanna go back and have a look-see.\n\n31\n00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:45.960\nThe different architectural\narrangements with SharePoint\n\n32\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.590\nfrom all on-prem to hosted in Azure\nto hybrid, SharePoint Online.\n\n33\n00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.928\nSo SharePoint Online has\nthe least that we do and\n\n34\n00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:58.360\nthe most that Microsoft does in\nterms of managing the back end.\n\n35\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.286\nSo our options are limited because the lot\nof the options that we'd see on-prem\n\n36\n00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:06.720\nare automatically taken care of for us, in\nfact that we have no control over those.\n\n37\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.434\nWe can certainly do things like buy more\nstorage, which is one of the options here,\n\n38\n00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:14.380\nbut from a DBA perspective, there's a lot\nless to do, Microsoft handles that.\n\n39\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.990\nSo right now I've got a few\nsite URLs listed here.\n\n40\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.770\nThat New reference beside each of the four\nURLs listed will go away after a few days.\n\n41\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.820\nAnd this is very useful because\nin cloud you're paying for\n\n42\n00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.220\nwhat you use so it's good to know\nhow many gigabytes you've used.\n\n43\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.290\nAt this point I used a grand total of 0.\n\n44\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.330\nServer Resource Quota,\nthat is affected by things like CPU cycle,\n\n45\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.040\nstorage space, RAM, throughput.\n\n46\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.239\nIt's one of those secret sauce\n\n47\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.670\nmeasurements that comes up with\na nice number that you can see.\n\n48\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.470\nAnd then we also have\nversion information there.\n\n49\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.270\nOkay so\nlet's create a new site collection.\n\n50\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.690\nBecause why not,\na new private site collection.\n\n51\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:13.711\nAnd give it a title,\nlet's call this one, After lunch.\n\n52\n00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:14.235\n>> Hm.\n\n53\n00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:18.700\n>> A funky new club.\n\n54\n00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.350\nAnd now, so remember,\n\n55\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.610\nthere's always gonna be differences\nbetween online and on-prem, almost always.\n\n56\n00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.250\nHere's an example of that,\nwe don't have the exact same number of\n\n57\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.140\ntemplate options in the Collaboration\ntab or the Enterprise tab.\n\n58\n00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.280\nOne of the reasons is here we have a Team\nSite SharePoint Online configuration.\n\n59\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.960\nSo there's a difference there.\n\n60\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.140\nWe're not gonna cover all of these.\n\n61\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.200\nI'm just showing you that there's\na different number of template\n\n62\n00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.900\noptions in some of these tabs.\n\n63\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.560\nLet's keep it simple and\nstick with the team site.\n\n64\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.420\nI know, it's very vanilla.\n\n65\n00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.000\nAnd then, actually,\nlet's see if my admin account works.\n\n66\n00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.435\nI may not have an admin account.\n\n67\n00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:01.220\n[LAUGH] Better use me.\n\n68\n00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:07.465\nMy mind was in on-prem but\nnow we're in the online world.\n\n69\n00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:09.405\nOkay, that resolved to me and\n\n70\n00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:14.405\nnow again, you don't have to know\nexactly the makeup of these resources.\n\n71\n00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:17.065\nSo 5600 resources available,\nwhat the heck does that mean?\n\n72\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.320\nIt's a combination of secret\nsauce of resource usage.\n\n73\n00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.820\nThe point is now we're establishing\n300 out of the 5600 as a maximum for\n\n74\n00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.680\nthis new site collection\nwe're establishing.\n\n75\n00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.350\nI can change that to 200 if I want,\nif I'm feeling stingy or\n\n76\n00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.960\nI need to create a lot\nmore site collections.\n\n77\n00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.660\nSo I change that, hit OK,\nand you can see there,\n\n78\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.660\nso you have to be a little more\npatient than with on-prem.\n\n79\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.470\nBecause up in the right here,\nyour site collections being created,\n\n80\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.910\nit may take 15 minutes.\n\n81\n00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.710\nSo it may show up here and\nbe available, and it may not.\n\n82\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.860\nNotice how right now it's in black,\nnot hyperlinkable.\n\n83\n00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.990\nSo we'll let that do it's thing and\n\n84\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.870\nthen eventually have a little\nnew icon next to it.\n\n85\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.240\nNow I'll select a URL that does exist,\nnotice I have to select the check box or\n\n86\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.360\nthe line it's on, just like we would\nin the on-prem version of SharePoint,\n\n87\n00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.450\nto then expose the site collection\nspecific buttons on the ribbon.\n\n88\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.207\nThings like Owners, Sharing,\nServer Resource Quota here.\n\n89\n00:05:20.207 --> 00:05:24.470\nSo this one had the default\nof 300 resource units.\n\n90\n00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.567\nJust like quotas in SharePoint or\nfor file storage on-prem,\n\n91\n00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:32.677\nwe can have an email sent to\nthe admin at x% of resource usage.\n\n92\n00:05:32.677 --> 00:05:36.095\nSo you're not suddenly finding one day,\nI cannot upload this file and\n\n93\n00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:39.210\nyou find out it's because\nyou've exceeded your quota.\n\n94\n00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.190\nAnd then you have to either upload\nthe file somewhere else or delete files,\n\n95\n00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.160\nit's gonna slow down your work flow.\n\n96\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.310\nThis way, by getting an email, and\nyou can vary this number, 85%'s good.\n\n97\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.904\nYou'll have advanced notice that\nyour usage is increasing and\n\n98\n00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:56.604\nyou'll have to take action soon, buying\nmore storage, deleting some content.\n\n99\n00:05:56.604 --> 00:06:00.501\nOr else the site will become\nless than operational,\n\n100\n00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.600\nshall we say,\nwhen you hit 100% of the quota.\n\n101\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.909\nSo I'll cancel out of there,\nI don't want to change the resource quota.\n\n102\n00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:12.920\nOkay, Site collection upgrade settings,\nlet's check this out.\n\n103\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.985\nAnd right now we've got\nthe 2013 experience version.\n\n104\n00:06:18.985 --> 00:06:22.670\nAnd you see here it says, Site collection\nalready at the most current version,\n\n105\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.390\nyou do not need to upgrade it.\n\n106\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.210\nNow you might say, what the heck?\n\n107\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.350\nThis is a SharePoint 2016 admin course,\nyou're showing me 2013 content.\n\n108\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.320\nI don't code the product,\nthat's the way it is right now.\n\n109\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.750\nI also said something that all the dev\nmoney goes into online improvements.\n\n110\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.151\nWell, this is an example, it seems to\nbe lagging behind the on-prem version.\n\n111\n00:06:43.151 --> 00:06:46.265\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it is what it is.\n\n112\n00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:47.603\nI can't believe I said that, but I did.\n\n113\n00:06:47.603 --> 00:06:49.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The only time this week.\n\n114\n00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.432\nAnd upgrade notifications, okay,\n\n115\n00:06:53.432 --> 00:06:59.030\nnow let's say the 2016 experience\n\n116\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.550\nversion comes out and then I'm not using\nthe most current version at that point.\n\n117\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.873\nSo this red ink here won’t\nappear anymore because I'll have\n\n118\n00:07:05.873 --> 00:07:11.360\nthe opportunity to upgrade, if and when\nI want to, from 2013 to 2016 for online.\n\n119\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.780\nWell, that point I can send an email\nto site collection administrators so\n\n120\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.550\nthey can choose on their\nown schedule whether or\n\n121\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.655\nnot to upgrade their sites\nto the 2016 version.\n\n122\n00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:24.420\nSo you have some flexibility, it's not\na command in control, one size fits all.\n\n123\n00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.410\nSite collection admins have\nthe responsibility to choose whether or\n\n124\n00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.870\nnot to upgrade to the latest\nversion at that time.\n\n125\n00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.740\nAll right, recycle bin there,\nand that's good for\n\n126\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.970\nsite collection, let's go to infopath now.\n\n127\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:47.110\nOkay so, do you want to allow users\nto browse or enable form templates?\n\n128\n00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.706\nYou could have exempt user agents,\nso they're getting\n\n129\n00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:56.411\ninfopath forms as XML,\nif they need to edit for example.\n\n130\n00:07:56.411 --> 00:07:59.818\nThis is kinda cool, Googlebot, Slurp.\n\n131\n00:07:59.818 --> 00:08:03.620\nSo if you use the info path, you'll be\nprobably familiar with some of those.\n\n132\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.243\nLet's all say there.\n\n133\n00:08:05.243 --> 00:08:06.950\nAnd User Profiles.\n\n134\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.489\nThis should start to look familiar\nwith your on-prem experience.\n\n135\n00:08:11.489 --> 00:08:12.690\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Of SharePoint.\n\n136\n00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.150\nSo things like managing user properties.\n\n137\n00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:21.210\nOver here on the right we've got five user\nprofiles listed with 110 user properties.\n\n138\n00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.760\nOne organization profile,\nand a single audience.\n\n139\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.980\nHere's where we can click\nto set up my sites.\n\n140\n00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.240\nHow do you do that?\n\n141\n00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.910\nThrowing caution To the winds.\n\n142\n00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:35.870\n>> Let's do it.\n\n143\n00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:36.890\n>> Let's do this.\n\n144\n00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.880\nOkay, so.\n\n145\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.650\nSearch scope for finding people,\nit could be all sites,\n\n146\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.320\nit makes sense to leave it at people.\n\n147\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.810\nFor documents, though,\nwe want the scope of all sites,\n\n148\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.340\nnot just a restricted subset as a search\nscope, so we'll leave that there.\n\n149\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.570\nAnd okay, so site naming, it depends\nif you have a multi domain environment.\n\n150\n00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.670\nIf we do there could be a problem\nbecause there could be a John Smith\n\n151\n00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.790\nin Domain A and a John Smith in Domain B.\n\n152\n00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.070\nAnd we need a way to resolve them, so\n\n153\n00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.110\nthe best way to do that would be\nthe third option, domain and username.\n\n154\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.390\nIn other words,\nthere's no possibility of a conflict,\n\n155\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.610\neven if two people have the same name,\nbut in different domains.\n\n156\n00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.110\nOkay, then read permission level here.\n\n157\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:28.050\nIt's a somewhat unusual permission if used\non a parameter that is, everyone except\n\n158\n00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.620\nexternal users as a read permission level.\n\n159\n00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.300\nNews feeds that can enable activities so\n\n160\n00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:42.405\nthat means I'll get information\nabout New events from people.\n\n161\n00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:44.225\nAlso from content I follow.\n\n162\n00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:45.865\nWe'll look at following a little later.\n\n163\n00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:51.155\nWe're going to get into more end user\nperspective of SharePoint online and\n\n164\n00:09:51.155 --> 00:09:52.242\nsome apps we could use.\n\n165\n00:09:52.242 --> 00:09:57.332\nUse as users, and then email notification.\n\n166\n00:09:59.452 --> 00:10:02.022\nSo you may want,\nlet's say you're following at,\n\n167\n00:10:02.022 --> 00:10:05.682\nyou're at a community say and you're\npart of a conversation or discussion.\n\n168\n00:10:05.682 --> 00:10:08.962\nYou may want to get emailed when\nthere's a new piece of input.\n\n169\n00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:13.482\nSo for me, for example, Microsoft News\nGroup, I might be interested in a topic,\n\n170\n00:10:13.482 --> 00:10:18.030\ncompletely forget about it, and then\ntwo months later Someone posts a reply,\n\n171\n00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.210\nmaybe someone answers\na question that was asked,\n\n172\n00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.810\nmaybe they weren't allowed to answer\nbefore and now there's new information.\n\n173\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.530\nI totally forgot about the discussion, but\nby subscribing to email notifications,\n\n174\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.090\nit reminds me instantly yeah\nI was interested in that and\n\n175\n00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.900\nnow there's an answer,\ncool I'll check that out.\n\n176\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.818\nSo we can enable email notifications.\n\n177\n00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:37.574\nSite cleanup.\n\n178\n00:10:40.028 --> 00:10:43.734\nWhen a user profile is deleted,\nwe have a 30-day period,\n\n179\n00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:48.096\nduring which we can access that content,\nand often when someone leaves\n\n180\n00:10:48.096 --> 00:10:52.600\nan organization there's a need for\nthe new person replacing that.\n\n181\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.630\nPerson that left to access some of\nthe content that the old employee had.\n\n182\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:01.530\nSo this way, it's sort of in limbo\nuntil it's permanently deleted 30 days\n\n183\n00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.980\nlater after the My Site\nis initially deleted.\n\n184\n00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.790\nWe can specify a secondary admin for\nMy Site, that might seem a little unusual.\n\n185\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.390\nI think you can understand\nthe rationale for secondary admin for\n\n186\n00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.180\na regular team site, for example.\n\n187\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.770\nThe primary site collection\nadministrator's away, extended leave, then\n\n188\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:24.420\nimportant emails can get answered by the\nsecondary site collection administration.\n\n189\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:29.170\nThings like requests for access,\nor potential deletion email.\n\n190\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.680\nIt's been six months.\n\n191\n00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:36.490\nsenses any activity, should we delete\nthis site or do we need to retain it?\n\n192\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.870\nIt kind of weird thinking, it's almost\nlike notify incase of emergency when you\n\n193\n00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:46.140\nare traveling, so incase you are out of\ncommission someone else can respond on\n\n194\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:51.780\nyour behalf, even though it's your mysites\nsite collection we are talking about\n\n195\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.320\nprivacy settings,\nshould my sites be public or not?\n\n196\n00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.330\nThe default is yes,\nactually default is private,\n\n197\n00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.990\nright now it says make mysites public.\n\n198\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:12.550\nOkay, so again you can allow users\nto override settings or not.\n\n199\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.850\nThings like activities,\nworkspace anniversaries, social tagging,\n\n200\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.100\ncontent ratings And the like.\n\n201\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.037\nOkay so I'll hit OK.\n\n202\n00:12:30.806 --> 00:12:32.330\nAnd that's good for now.\n\n203\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.529\nSo Publish Links to\nOffice Client Applications.\n\n204\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:45.050\nWhat this means is,\nlet's say I'm going to save as.\n\n205\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:49.060\nI'm working on saving Microsoft Word, and\n\n206\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.740\nthere's some links that\nappear in the save as blocks.\n\n207\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.560\nI can put links in there to\nSharePoint document libraries, or\n\n208\n00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.110\nother lists for example.\n\n209\n00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.370\nSo that it's very easy for the user in the\nsave as dialogue to choose a particular\n\n210\n00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.030\nSharePoint library to save\nthat content to, as opposed to\n\n211\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:10.600\ntrying to navigate through the url path\nand start typing it in hassle, hassle.\n\n212\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.820\nWe wanna make it easier for users,\n\n213\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:17.550\nwe can pre-populate the save as dialogue\nbox with links to document libraries.\n\n214\n00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.969\nVery handy.\nYou wanna be nice to your users.\n\n215\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.280\nAll right.\n>> Most of the time.\n\n216\n00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.880\n>> Most of the time.\n\n217\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.540\nThat's right.\n\n218\n00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.890\nSo, other concepts here we're not gonna go\ninto because we would have covered them in\n\n219\n00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:37.550\nthe basic course, BCS, so,\nbusiness connectivity services.\n\n220\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:44.720\nAs we looked at,\nin our BCS episode in this course.\n\n221\n00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.410\nSo there's a need to connect to\nonline services sometimes, and or\n\n222\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.770\non premises services.\n\n223\n00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.640\nAlso you can manage your BDC models and\nexternal content types.\n\n224\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.530\nAgain, the BDC is middle where it's\ntranslating between SharePoint and\n\n225\n00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.218\nthat organized external data source.\n\n226\n00:14:01.218 --> 00:14:03.697\nTerm Store.\n\n227\n00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:08.910\nYou recall the taxonomy.\n\n228\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:14.220\nWe covered that in another episode, and\nso this interface should look familiar.\n\n229\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.200\nSo I refer you to that metadata episode.\n\n230\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.710\nFor more info I'm just pointing out what's\ndifferent in this interface, we're not\n\n231\n00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:26.030\ngonna redo, recover all the material\nwe've already covered in this course.\n\n232\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.905\nSo Records Management,\nthis is worth talking about again.\n\n233\n00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:31.675\nAgain, this is handy.\n\n234\n00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:35.055\nSo records management, a record is\nsomething that generally does not change\n\n235\n00:14:35.055 --> 00:14:38.595\nand needs to be kept for a certain period\nof time, like a contract for example.\n\n236\n00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:42.885\nThere may be edits during the contract\ncreation process and negotiation, but\n\n237\n00:14:42.885 --> 00:14:46.255\neventually it is signed and\nshould remain unaltered.\n\n238\n00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:49.505\nIn fact, you should be able to audit\nthat that contract was not altered,\n\n239\n00:14:49.505 --> 00:14:51.730\ndeleted are moved.\n\n240\n00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.390\nSo once we set up our records center and\nI show you how to create\n\n241\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:15:00.260\na record center template, and\nsettings involved with that in the basic\n\n242\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.730\nSharePoint administration course,\nwe can set up a send to connection.\n\n243\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.690\nThis means from the users perspective\nthey just have to access the content menu\n\n244\n00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.700\nwhen they want to send a record\nto the record center, and\n\n245\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.990\nwe set up the url and\nthe name of the item n the context menu.\n\n246\n00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.550\nI was going to say right click menu,\n\n247\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.730\nbut that's not exactly\naccurate to the context menu,\n\n248\n00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:26.760\nsometimes you have to click the ellipsis,\nactually sometimes right click does work.\n\n249\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.990\nDepends on the interface.\n\n250\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:33.280\nBut the point is, you have a context menu,\nand Send To, you configure the URL and\n\n251\n00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.340\nDisplay Name for that link, and\nthen the record gets sent there.\n\n252\n00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.160\nNow classifying the records is\na totally separate process.\n\n253\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.150\nThat's what I call librarian skills.\n\n254\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.739\nThat would have to be set up in advance so\nthat,\n\n255\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.600\njust like if you're sending a piece of\nmail, you just have to put in a mailbox.\n\n256\n00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.350\nI mean you trust that it's gonna get\ndelivered based on whatever systems and\n\n257\n00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.616\nclassifications that the organization\nexists, the US Postal Service.\n\n258\n00:15:56.616 --> 00:15:57.691\nInsert joke here.\n\n259\n00:15:57.691 --> 00:16:00.249\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But anyway, so\n\n260\n00:16:00.249 --> 00:16:04.652\nthen you see the send to records\nrepository, the records center And then\n\n261\n00:16:04.652 --> 00:16:09.997\nthe classification would have already been\ndone by someone else in your organization,\n\n262\n00:16:09.997 --> 00:16:15.340\npertaining to things like retention\npolicies, etc, related to the record.\n\n263\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:21.590\nNow, the search option down here,\nlet's load that up.\n\n264\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.840\nSo again,\nalthough they're displayed differently,\n\n265\n00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.300\nthe functions are the same as they are on\npremises in terms of the search schema.\n\n266\n00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.090\nSo properties that should be indexed,\nand therefore searchable.\n\n267\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.780\nSearch dictionaries, so\nmaybe even thesauruses.\n\n268\n00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.360\nSo some brand names,\nwe were talking about jargon earlier.\n\n269\n00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.430\nSo maybe an old name for a product,\nand now you have a new name, so\n\n270\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.760\nyou want to make those synonymous.\n\n271\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.320\nSo a search for either term will\nreturn results from both terms.\n\n272\n00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.040\nAuthoritative pages so\nagain that first the basic SharePoint\n\n273\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.450\nadmin course we discussed\nvarious search settings.\n\n274\n00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.780\nSecure store service we discussed another\nepisode in this course in the context of\n\n275\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.545\nusing it with the BCS Business\nConnectivity Service Apps, so\n\n276\n00:17:08.545 --> 00:17:14.110\napp catalogue here.\n\n277\n00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:16.080\nWe actually have another episode on apps.\n\n278\n00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.260\nI'll just show you where that is.\n\n279\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.690\nAnd we'll cover that in different episode.\n\n280\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.429\nCan you please make a note of that?\n\n281\n00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:25.505\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n282\n00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:27.315\n>> On the air, live on the air.\n\n283\n00:17:27.315 --> 00:17:29.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't wanna have to try and\n\n284\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.400\nremember it throughout the episode.\n\n285\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:31.980\nThank you.\n\n286\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.600\nAll right, now this is very\nimportant in terms of privacy and\n\n287\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.360\nwhat you're using content for\nin SharePoint Online for.\n\n288\n00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.450\nDo you want to share content with\nusers outside the organization?\n\n289\n00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.340\nYou could say no, do not share content.\n\n290\n00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.630\nYou could say, if the contact exist\nin the organization's directory,\n\n291\n00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.410\nthen they are for a reason, because\nthere's a supplier or a client Partner,\n\n292\n00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.140\nconsultant, what have you,\nyou can share with them but\n\n293\n00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.360\nthey have to have information\nin our organizational directory.\n\n294\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.130\nAnother option is to give users\nthe responsibility and choice as to who\n\n295\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:12.060\nto invite to participate, and\nshare a document with, so that's\n\n296\n00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.530\nanother option allow users to invite and\nshare with authenticated external users.\n\n297\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:23.590\nAnd then the last option here is allow\nsharing to authenticate external users and\n\n298\n00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.170\nusing anonymous access links,\nso that means anyone\n\n299\n00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.320\nwith access to the link could click\non it and access that information.\n\n300\n00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.230\nSo, product catalog to the general public,\nokay internal\n\n301\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.472\nexcel spreadsheet about margins and\ncustomer ratings,\n\n302\n00:18:39.472 --> 00:18:44.834\nnot okay.\n\n303\n00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:51.440\nNow the warning here at the bottom under\nadditional settings, if you're sharing by\n\n304\n00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:57.520\nanonymous links keep that in mind that\nusers don't have to authenticate.\n\n305\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.170\nAdditional settings here, external users\nmust accept sharing invitations using\n\n306\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.390\nthe same account\nthe invitations were sent to.\n\n307\n00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.880\nSometimes I have an issue\nwith online meetings,\n\n308\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.860\nbecause they want me to sign in with\na Google account, but it was sent\n\n309\n00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.480\nto my business account, and it just\nseems to be more hassle than it's worth.\n\n310\n00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.750\nSo this is a way of restricting, or\nmaking sure you're getting the invitation\n\n311\n00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.970\nto share in some content or\nto view some shared content,\n\n312\n00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.850\nmake sure the right person gets it\nbased on their specific email account.\n\n313\n00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.790\nSo it's not just the person but\nit's the person\n\n314\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:37.450\nat the specific email account\naddress on the settings option here.\n\n315\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.220\nOkay, so OneDrive for Business.\n\n316\n00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.150\nWe'll look at this when we talk about\nthe various apps we can use for\n\n317\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.920\nSharePoint online, do we want to\nshow options related to One Drive?\n\n318\n00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.570\nSure we do.\n\n319\n00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.820\nStorage management.\n\n320\n00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.269\nWe can allow for\nmanual override for storage.\n\n321\n00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:07.700\nThe OneDrive for Business experience,\nthere's additional features for various\n\n322\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:13.045\ndevices, and a simplified UI, so that's,\nremember New Coke and and Classic Coke.\n\n323\n00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Classic experience,\n\n324\n00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.055\nit's sounds, wow, retro.\n\n325\n00:20:16.055 --> 00:20:18.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like a 66 Mustang Convertible, but no,\n\n326\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.335\nit just means the old one.\n\n327\n00:20:19.335 --> 00:20:21.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or the new experience,\n\n328\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.700\nwhich is more streamlined\na little more user-friendly.\n\n329\n00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.280\nOneDrive sync button.\n\n330\n00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.660\nDo you want to show that or now.\n\n331\n00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.910\nKeep in mind if you're exposing\nfunctionality through the interface,\n\n332\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.040\nthat's gonna lead to training requests or\nhelp desk calls.\n\n333\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.160\nSo, you can always come back later and\nexpose certain functionalities that\n\n334\n00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.790\nyou hid to begin with, because maybe\nyou don't wanna overwhelm users.\n\n335\n00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.640\nOr as an organization you're still trying\nto get a handle on the functionality.\n\n336\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.210\nOkay, now SharePoint lists and\nlibraries experience,\n\n337\n00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.630\nagain optimized for\ndifferent form factors, tablets for\n\n338\n00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:01.080\nexample, Admin Center Experience,\nsimple or advanced.\n\n339\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:07.090\nNow Office Graph Is very cool,\nso this Dell is one of the apps\n\n340\n00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.720\nwe are gonna touch on in a different\nepisode that utilize office graph.\n\n341\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.160\nIf you use Facebook graphs,\nit's the same kind of idea.\n\n342\n00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.280\nIt creates connections with\nall kind of data points and\n\n343\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.030\nlets you search and\nfilter on a huge variety of data points.\n\n344\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.530\nSo, if you are looking for Fred Smith.\n\n345\n00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.530\nWho's 35 years old and\nlives in one of these two cities.\n\n346\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.360\nYou can get that specific\nwith your search.\n\n347\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.370\nSo, off this graph,\nthe default is to allow access to it.\n\n348\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.200\nAnd the more you use Share Point,\nthe more useful graph becomes.\n\n349\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.600\nBecause it uses your contacts, the people\nyou interact with and chat, or socially In\n\n350\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:48.140\nthe SharePoint context, documents you\ncreate or co-author, documents you follow,\n\n351\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.290\nall that information becomes just for\nthe mill if you like, so you're\n\n352\n00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.420\nbetter able to serve up content that\nmight be relevant to you, for example.\n\n353\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.200\nThat's one of the applications\nof Office Graph.\n\n354\n00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.440\nMore on that when we talk about Delve.\n\n355\n00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.610\nEnterprise Social Collaboration,\ndo you want to use SharePoint Newsfeed?\n\n356\n00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:08.090\nThat's the default, otherwise you can use\nYammer, and a warning here that would take\n\n357\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:13.374\nup to half an hour to\ncomplete the change to Yamar,\n\n358\n00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:19.360\nokay, so Yamar's not covered security\nwise under the trust center.\n\n359\n00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.400\nSo that might be a factor to not\nuse the Yammer.com service for\n\n360\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.910\nsocial collaboration,\nstreaming video is pretty cool.\n\n361\n00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.690\nYou can allow this through\nAzure media services.\n\n362\n00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.910\nRemember you do pay for what you use.\n\n363\n00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.770\nOkay, so\nglobal experience version settings,\n\n364\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.010\nthis could be a concern if\nyou've got customized software.\n\n365\n00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.690\nThat you've tested to work with an old\nversion, like sharepoint 2013, and\n\n366\n00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:49.980\nyou are not sure it's ready for the next\nversion, so lets say you are using 2010,\n\n367\n00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.310\nthen your son uses a 2010 sci collections,\nothers a 2013 sci collection.\n\n368\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.412\nDo you want to prevent, at a certain time,\n\n369\n00:22:57.412 --> 00:23:02.251\nold versions of SharePoint site\ncollections from being created?\n\n370\n00:23:05.482 --> 00:23:06.944\nSo, you have that option there.\n\n371\n00:23:08.981 --> 00:23:13.640\nYou could say, allow both the creation of\nold and new versions of site collections,\n\n372\n00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.920\nor you could also say allow old versions\nto be created, not the new versions.\n\n373\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.120\nAgain, this is very much depending on any\ncustomizations that presumably some time\n\n374\n00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.620\nto test, and verify in\nthe SharePoint Online environment.\n\n375\n00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.070\nSo just like the customizations\ndo take a while to test.\n\n376\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.540\nSo that will be reason to remain on\nolder versions of a site collection for\n\n377\n00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.920\nmany years potentially.\n\n378\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.270\nSo don't upgrade just because\nthe latest and greatest exists.\n\n379\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:44.790\nSome organizations do every second upgrade\nif you will from 2010 they move to 2016.\n\n380\n00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:49.080\nNot directly, but\nthey have to go through 2013 intermediate.\n\n381\n00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.640\nBut they might skip the whole process\nwhich might take a year or more and\n\n382\n00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:58.390\njust upgrade every other version,\ninformation rights management.\n\n383\n00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.420\nYou need Office 365 IRM service for this.\n\n384\n00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.200\nThat's a choice we talked about IRM\nin the basic week, and start a site.\n\n385\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.600\nSo you can specify,\ngive users a link, show you,\n\n386\n00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.640\nand they can start creating new team site\nunder a URL path that's specified here.\n\n387\n00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.881\nAnd then you can require a site\nclassification or make it optional.\n\n388\n00:24:27.311 --> 00:24:28.290\nOkay.\n\n389\n00:24:31.459 --> 00:24:34.760\nAnd you also have the ability\nto block workflows.\n\n390\n00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.030\nAnd whether or not to allow access apps.\n\n391\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.840\nSo if you're using Access and\nsupport users of Access to access apps,\n\n392\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.670\nthen you would leave that at\nthe default which is enabled.\n\n393\n00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:52.590\nI don't think I changed anything there,\nso I won't hit OK.\n\n394\n00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:56.364\nHybrid is a whole nother ball of wax,\nlet's click on it briefly here.\n\n395\n00:24:59.543 --> 00:25:04.134\nOkay, so, there's a couple considerations\nof the hybrid, whether you want to\n\n396\n00:25:04.134 --> 00:25:08.200\nhave a hybrid OneDrive, and\nalso hybrid One Drive and sites features.\n\n397\n00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.370\nThat's a separate architectural design\nif you recall from SharePoint online\n\n398\n00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.185\nHybrid was another one.\n\n399\n00:25:15.185 --> 00:25:18.505\n[INAUDIBLE] is another design,\nand then finally Azure.\n\n400\n00:25:18.505 --> 00:25:22.930\n[INAUDIBLE] host your\nentire SharePoint in Azure.\n\n401\n00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:28.060\nAlright Mark, thanks for that tour of the\nsharepoint online administrative center,\n\n402\n00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.760\nand a look at some of the different\nfeatures we have available,\n\n403\n00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.070\nsome of the things we can do, as well\nas pointing out some of the things that\n\n404\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.930\nare not available if we move or try to\nuse that sharepoint online admin center.\n\n405\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:39.080\nSo, we thank you for that.\n\n406\n00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.520\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching,\nsigning out from IT pro TV.\n\n407\n00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.330\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n408\n00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.160\n>> I'm Mark Andream.\n\n409\n00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.753\n>> And we will see you next

00:00:16.907\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:20.272\nAnd today,\nwe're doing our advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:24.680\nAnd specifically, this episode,\nwe're gonna be covering,\n\n6\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.098\nif I can get that out,\nthe SharePoint online user experience.\n\n7\n00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:31.870\nAnd here to show us the way is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.542\nHow you doing, Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:33.798\n>> Good, Mike, thank you very much.\n\n10\n00:00:33.798 --> 00:00:35.309\nYes.\n\n11\n00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.183\nLike Peter Frampton,\nyou want me to show you the way.\n\n12\n00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.118\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Every day.\n\n13\n00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:40.993\n>> Every day.\n\n14\n00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:45.067\n>> All right, so\nthis is a typical user experience of\n\n15\n00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:48.369\nSharePoint online we're gonna cover.\n\n16\n00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:50.630\nNow you might say, what the heck is this?\n\n17\n00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.896\nIf you could see it on your screen,\nyou'd see what I see.\n\n18\n00:00:54.896 --> 00:00:59.856\nAnd this looks rather bright, almost\nlike a teenage girl chose the colors,\n\n19\n00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:01.962\nI didn't choose these colors.\n\n20\n00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> However,\n\n21\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.856\nI did create some of these sites and\nobjects that you see here, for example,\n\n22\n00:01:07.856 --> 00:01:10.374\nthe Grouper Group in a previous episode.\n\n23\n00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:12.671\nThe After Lunch, it looks like AI,\n\n24\n00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:17.123\nPointPublishing Hub Site was there\nalready, Realtown Teams Site.\n\n25\n00:01:17.123 --> 00:01:22.014\nSo we can follow these, and then whether\nit's a group or a site or other object,\n\n26\n00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:25.446\nyou'd see in the following\nwhere the quick launch tab or\n\n27\n00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:30.300\nlinks used to be, different kind of\nquick launch, I suppose you could say.\n\n28\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.730\nTeam site and products,\nI can click on See All.\n\n29\n00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.510\nThen I'm following.\n\n30\n00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.560\nI just had two there, so\nthat wasn't very helpful to expand that.\n\n31\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.506\nLinks, so I put a link in\nthere to Microsoft earlier.\n\n32\n00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:46.600\nI can say, you know what,\nwe're going to delete that.\n\n33\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.631\nAnd now I'm down a link,\nso I can add another one.\n\n34\n00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:56.265\nLet's say, [LAUGH] Blast in the past.\n\n35\n00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:59.850\nI don't even know if this is a functional\nsite, but we're about to find out.\n\n36\n00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.999\nWhen I try the link for Novell.com,\nThis domain is available for purchase.\n\n37\n00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.971\n>> Yeah.\n\n38\n00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:14.451\n>> A variety of ad trackers.\n\n39\n00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.250\nNovell is a part of Micro Focus.\n\n40\n00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.084\nIf I'd cared in the last ten years,\nI might have known that.\n\n41\n00:02:19.084 --> 00:02:20.970\nI don't think this is a new thing.\n\n42\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.520\nAnyway, that point is,\nthere's a link there.\n\n43\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.300\nLet's set that down immediately.\n\n44\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.790\nI'll save that, and now I have a Novell\nlink in my Modern SharePoint online site.\n\n45\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.484\nOkay, that's ridiculous, Delete.\n\n46\n00:02:33.484 --> 00:02:39.192\nAll right, so if I had some more recent\nactivity in the frequent section here,\n\n47\n00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:40.932\nthere'd be more info.\n\n48\n00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:45.458\nVery handy, if you're like me, you're\njumping around between different websites,\n\n49\n00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:49.497\nprobably in different browsers,\nmultiple tabs, documents, some online,\n\n50\n00:02:49.497 --> 00:02:50.366\nsome on-prem.\n\n51\n00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:54.274\nIt's easy to forget what you were doing,\nso recent activity would appear here,\n\n52\n00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:57.841\nallowing you to one click get back to\nwhat you were doing, that's handy.\n\n53\n00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:02.051\nLet's see what happens when\nI click on Create site,\n\n54\n00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.420\nlet's give it a name, how about Alfred.\n\n55\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.261\nAnd notice how the URL, what I just typed\nin appears after my domain name here.\n\n56\n00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:17.741\nSo https://realtown/sharepoint.com,\nand now I got /Alfred.\n\n57\n00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.690\nThis shouldn't take long,\nit says, and they mean it.\n\n58\n00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.346\nSo this site should look very familiar,\nthis site template,\n\n59\n00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:29.550\nbecause it looks just like the one\nwe've created on-prem, that's good.\n\n60\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.370\nLet's go back to where we once were.\n\n61\n00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.920\nAnd now we're going to\nlook at the person object,\n\n62\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.210\nand I've kinda cut off the screen here,\nso I'll just scroll over a little bit.\n\n63\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.955\nThere's the anonymous person shape,\nI'll select that.\n\n64\n00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:50.784\nI could change the picture or add one.\n\n65\n00:03:50.784 --> 00:03:55.658\nIf I go to About Me, Now,\n\n66\n00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:59.212\nhere's a profile of where hopefully\nwe can obscure away information yet.\n\n67\n00:03:59.212 --> 00:04:05.275\n[LAUGH] This is cool, so\na place I could upload my documents,\n\n68\n00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:10.139\nand then I can make\ncertain documents private.\n\n69\n00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.107\nSo just like a My Site,\nI can use on-prem SharePoint,\n\n70\n00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:19.477\nI can have some documents private here\nin this area of SharePoint online.\n\n71\n00:04:19.477 --> 00:04:28.490\nI can edit my profile here, I can create\na new blog post, By clicking Blog.\n\n72\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.310\nOkay, so this says it may take\na few minutes setting up your blog,\n\n73\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.380\nwe only have to do it once,\nbut I'm impatient.\n\n74\n00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.820\nSo I shall let that roll in\nthe background and go back to the demo.\n\n75\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.180\nAnd it talks about Delve there,\nwe'll cover Delve a little bit later.\n\n76\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.520\nI can go back to home.\n\n77\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.631\nNow, popular documents, so this is\nrelated to Delve functionality as well,\n\n78\n00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:55.058\nwhich uses Office Graph,\nbased on my interactions with people,\n\n79\n00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:57.134\ndocuments I've looked at or created.\n\n80\n00:04:57.134 --> 00:05:02.559\nAnother activity, it will show me certain\n\n81\n00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:07.538\ndocuments here, which is kinda cool.\n\n82\n00:05:07.538 --> 00:05:12.153\n>> Really, especially when we find that\nyou might have hundreds of thousands of\n\n83\n00:05:12.153 --> 00:05:17.207\ndocuments in your enterprise content, but\nyou don't use all of those all the time.\n\n84\n00:05:17.207 --> 00:05:21.347\nYou've got a subset that you access\nas part of your daily routine, your\n\n85\n00:05:21.347 --> 00:05:26.180\njob function to have those recents show up\nthere, it can be extremely time saving.\n\n86\n00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.519\n>> Absolutely, so\nOneDrive is a place where Delve looks to\n\n87\n00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:34.510\ndetermine what content\nmight be relevant for you.\n\n88\n00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.030\nSo we'll also look at\nOneDrive in this episode.\n\n89\n00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.450\nBut for now, let's go back,\nI'll check up on my blog site.\n\n90\n00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.225\nOkay, well, I don't really need\nto show you the blog site anyway.\n\n91\n00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:50.821\nSo but just know that, as we've already\nseen several times in this course, when\n\n92\n00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:55.757\nwe're working with SharePoint online, we\nclick on something, with the first time,\n\n93\n00:05:55.757 --> 00:06:00.425\nthere's often a set-up period which can\nbe several seconds to several minutes or\n\n94\n00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:01.868\nan hour in some cases so.\n\n95\n00:06:01.868 --> 00:06:03.901\nBut typically, once it's set up,\nthen it's done.\n\n96\n00:06:03.901 --> 00:06:08.400\nNext time you click on it, it opens\ninstantly, and that is a good thing.\n\n97\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.010\nLet's scroll back over here.\n\n98\n00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.610\nLet's look at Mail now, and click on Mail.\n\n99\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.210\nNow I did click on this before.\n\n100\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.910\nJust to freshen up, we're gonna make\nsure that Tiles opened quickly.\n\n101\n00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.765\nSo again, you're gonna see a slight delay\nwhen you click on Mail for the first time.\n\n102\n00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:32.173\nAnd if you recall, from a different\nepisode, I joined the Grouper Group group.\n\n103\n00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:37.520\n[LAUGH] From the department\nof redundancy department.\n\n104\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.430\nAnd on behalf of Mark Ingram,\nthis is kinda cool.\n\n105\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.273\nSo a little more pizzaz\nthan we're used to.\n\n106\n00:06:43.273 --> 00:06:50.158\nSay with an on-prem or standard email and\nalso helpful for a new member there,\n\n107\n00:06:50.158 --> 00:06:56.644\nalso I can double click-there to get\na fullscreen version of that email.\n\n108\n00:06:56.644 --> 00:07:01.897\nSo very useful, I can do things\nlike take part in conversations,\n\n109\n00:07:01.897 --> 00:07:07.355\ngo to OneDrive Connect apps,\nconnect me to Twitter, for example.\n\n110\n00:07:07.355 --> 00:07:11.140\nIt's not just a Microsoft centered\nworld in here in SharePoint online,\n\n111\n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.635\nwe can connect to third-party tools and\napps.\n\n112\n00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:16.985\nSo that's pretty cool,\nI can click on Go to Group if I want.\n\n113\n00:07:16.985 --> 00:07:19.404\nBut at this point, I won't do that.\n\n114\n00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:24.410\nAnd some of the familiar, but certainly\nnot a full featured client like Outlook\n\n115\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.119\nwould be, but there's enough common\nMenu options that most people will do\n\n116\n00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:34.053\njust fine with Office 365, and they\nwon't miss some of those other options\n\n117\n00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:38.641\nif they're more used to working with\nthe full Outlook Client on-prem.\n\n118\n00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:39.529\nAll right, so what's next?\n\n119\n00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:40.545\nWe're just gonna go through these here.\n\n120\n00:07:40.545 --> 00:07:46.885\nCalendar, so again, similar experience\nto Outlook, not as full featured.\n\n121\n00:07:46.885 --> 00:07:49.982\nThis is kinda cool, we've got\nsome weather here auto magically,\n\n122\n00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:51.270\nthe weather is populated.\n\n123\n00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.522\nNice, kinda like that.\n\n124\n00:07:53.522 --> 00:07:54.394\nPeople.\n\n125\n00:07:55.597 --> 00:07:57.354\nPeople who need people.\n\n126\n00:07:57.354 --> 00:08:00.966\nSo a little smiley face,\nwe didn't find anything to show.\n\n127\n00:08:00.966 --> 00:08:05.693\nWell, if I had some people, they would\nshow up here I can add a contact.\n\n128\n00:08:05.693 --> 00:08:09.800\nLet's do that so\nthere's no emoticon there.\n\n129\n00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.692\nSo let's say Jo Smith, and\n\n130\n00:08:14.692 --> 00:08:22.145\nwe'll give it an email jo@smith.com.\n\n131\n00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:23.729\nDisplay as Jo.\n\n132\n00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.553\nOkay, I won't, IM, what the heck.\n\n133\n00:08:30.553 --> 00:08:32.737\nOr, actually, I can do IM.\n\n134\n00:08:32.737 --> 00:08:34.740\nI can add notes about Jo if I wanted.\n\n135\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.415\nAnd I'll click on Save.\n\n136\n00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:42.675\nAnd now I have a contact known\nas JS in the J category.\n\n137\n00:08:42.675 --> 00:08:45.230\nThere's a discover link\nunder the Groups option.\n\n138\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.960\nAnd again, using Delve,\nit comes up with suggestions.\n\n139\n00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.270\nGroups I might want to join.\n\n140\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.723\nWhat information would use to\ninform what displays here,\n\n141\n00:08:55.723 --> 00:08:58.828\nthings like people I know,\nwhat groups are they in?\n\n142\n00:08:58.828 --> 00:09:01.355\nOr people I've collaborated on documents\nwith, what groups are they in?\n\n143\n00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:04.235\nSo there's an overriding intelligence,\nif you like.\n\n144\n00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:05.706\nOthers would call it\nan invasion of privacy.\n\n145\n00:09:05.706 --> 00:09:08.515\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Take your pick.\n\n146\n00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:11.145\nNews feed is another option.\n\n147\n00:09:13.255 --> 00:09:16.605\nAnd I posted something,\nwow, five hours ago.\n\n148\n00:09:16.605 --> 00:09:17.535\nWhere does the time go?\n\n149\n00:09:17.535 --> 00:09:19.965\nI said, let's get it started.\n\n150\n00:09:19.965 --> 00:09:22.870\nIf I click on Show More Posts,\nthere aren't any more posts.\n\n151\n00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.930\nYeah, I'm following Alfred.\n\n152\n00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.770\nThat's cool.\n\n153\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.060\nOver here on the right,\nfollowing people, documents, and sites.\n\n154\n00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.207\nNo trending tags right now,\nthat's too bad.\n\n155\n00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:37.385\n#indianfood.\n\n156\n00:09:37.385 --> 00:09:39.290\nI've got that on the brain.\n\n157\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.840\nAs you'll see.\n\n158\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.859\nOkay.\n\n159\n00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:43.940\nI wonder if this makes it\na trending tag right away.\n\n160\n00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.706\nLet's find out.\n\n161\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.970\nNo, not trending.\n\n162\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.380\nI guess we need more people.\n\n163\n00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.205\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do plus one,\n\n164\n00:09:51.205 --> 00:09:53.542\nor you know, retagging or\nsomething like that.\n\n165\n00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:58.930\nMentions, so if I was mentioned,\nI wonder if I can mention myself.\n\n166\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.429\nLet's find out.\n\n167\n00:10:00.429 --> 00:10:03.150\nHow vain is that?\n\n168\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.120\nOr actually, it would just be Mark,\nyeah, there we go.\n\n169\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.950\nI'll post that.\n\n170\n00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:10.820\nOkay.\n\n171\n00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.370\nThere's some Likes here, if I liked\nanything it would show up there.\n\n172\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.629\nI do have a mention, because I mentioned\nmyself, that can get confusing.\n\n173\n00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:21.640\nIt's like when you fold in\nthe bathroom mirrors and\n\n174\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.120\nyou keep seeing multiple\nversions of yourself.\n\n175\n00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.910\nAll right, let's go to OneDrive.\n\n176\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.200\nOneDrive.\n\n177\n00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.000\nSo folder's empty,\nI can drag content in there.\n\n178\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.640\nThat's useful.\n\n179\n00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.752\nI could click on New.\n\n180\n00:10:34.752 --> 00:10:35.720\nI could upload.\n\n181\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.320\nSo I can create a new Word, Excel,\nPowerPoint, etcetera, right from here.\n\n182\n00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.469\nI specify a new link,\nI can upload content to the OneDrive.\n\n183\n00:10:45.108 --> 00:10:45.705\nVery handy.\n\n184\n00:10:45.705 --> 00:10:46.360\nSharePoint.\n\n185\n00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.680\nPlanner, so, remember, it's an evolving\nplatform, SharePoint Online.\n\n186\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.078\nThere's a blog post that I just looked at.\n\n187\n00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:55.234\nIt came out two days\nbefore we're filming here.\n\n188\n00:10:55.234 --> 00:10:58.601\nSo it was kind of beta release, a few\npeople, now it's generally available.\n\n189\n00:10:58.601 --> 00:11:00.668\nSo this is brand new.\n\n190\n00:11:00.668 --> 00:11:01.930\nYou heard it here first.\n\n191\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.873\nPlanner, so it's a way actually\nyou can have multiple plans,\n\n192\n00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:07.729\nkind of like multiple projects on the go.\n\n193\n00:11:07.729 --> 00:11:12.250\nAnd this is one place you can see\nwhere you're at with various plans.\n\n194\n00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.491\nSo it may or\nmay not be relevant to your situation.\n\n195\n00:11:14.491 --> 00:11:15.640\nI can click on New Plan.\n\n196\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.030\nLet's call this Simple Plan.\n\n197\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.100\nAnd should the plan be public?\n\n198\n00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:24.720\nYeah, why not?\n\n199\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.203\nCreate Plan.\n\n200\n00:11:29.573 --> 00:11:34.137\nThat was the first quasi-rock concert\nI took my niece to, Simple Plan and\n\n201\n00:11:34.137 --> 00:11:38.940\nHedley and some other band which I\ndidn't care for, but what the heck.\n\n202\n00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.240\nBonding with my niece over rock and roll.\n\n203\n00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.700\nAll right, so Simple Plan here.\n\n204\n00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.860\nRemember, it's got a project field, right?\n\n205\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.360\nSo don't be confused by the new\nname Planner, what's Planner?\n\n206\n00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.060\nSo I can add a task and set a due date,\nand then other options here,\n\n207\n00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.210\nconversations, members.\n\n208\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:12:00.586\nSo the point is, we can have different\ndisplays as well of the plan.\n\n209\n00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:05.429\nThis is kinda cool, charts, a little\nvisual there, a little circle ring.\n\n210\n00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:07.091\nThere's a notebook.\n\n211\n00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:08.391\nNothing to do with the movie.\n\n212\n00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:15.300\nNotebook is, Enter, so\nI can enter a section name.\n\n213\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.619\nLet's call it food.\n\n214\n00:12:18.619 --> 00:12:21.792\nAnd so, we can, now,\n\n215\n00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:26.780\nthis is true of many online apps.\n\n216\n00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.450\nYou have the ability to edit in\nthe full-featured application.\n\n217\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.655\nSo I click on Edit in OneNote,\nif I had OneNote installed locally,\n\n218\n00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:38.820\nthen I could edit in that\nfull-featured client.\n\n219\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.100\nBut most of the time, what we're doing, we\ngenerally use a very small percentage of\n\n220\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.580\nthe total capability of any\napplication we're working in.\n\n221\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.660\nSo these sort of stripped-down versions\nof the online version of the app,\n\n222\n00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.830\nin this case, OneNote,\nis enough to do what we need.\n\n223\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.910\nThere's also, like many companies,\nMicrosoft's eager to receive feedback or\n\n224\n00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.240\nat least give you an outlet to beef or\nrequest.\n\n225\n00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.520\nAnd so I can say Give Feedback.\n\n226\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.589\nI can also at this point click on Share.\n\n227\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.850\nSharing is caring.\n\n228\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.384\nAnd I can share the Simple Plan notebook\nand either give view, or basically,\n\n229\n00:13:12.384 --> 00:13:15.540\nread or read and\nwrite permissions with edit or view.\n\n230\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.890\nSo we'll cancel out of there.\n\n231\n00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.115\nSo that's OneNote.\n\n232\n00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:24.016\nVia Planner and Tasks.\n\n233\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.610\nSo a brief while to open my Outlook here.\n\n234\n00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.348\nSo no tasks, so I wanna create a new one.\n\n235\n00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:36.290\nClick on the New button.\n\n236\n00:13:38.466 --> 00:13:41.450\nAnd get more of these annoying pop-ups.\n\n237\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.240\nAll right.\n\n238\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.375\nSo I'm gonna say Indian\n\n239\n00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:52.005\nfood, due, today.\n\n240\n00:13:52.005 --> 00:13:54.318\nMore details.\n\n241\n00:13:54.318 --> 00:13:55.280\nReminder.\n\n242\n00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.150\nClick yes.\n\n243\n00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.080\nAnd we'll say 5:00 PM.\n\n244\n00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.310\nTotal work.\n\n245\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.020\nActual work.\n\n246\n00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:06.680\nI love that.\n\n247\n00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.405\nThere's a Dilbert cartoon in there.\n\n248\n00:14:09.405 --> 00:14:11.068\nMileage.\n\n249\n00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:12.040\n10 miles.\n\n250\n00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.812\nBilling.\n\n251\n00:14:12.812 --> 00:14:14.390\nUS Government.\n\n252\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:22.373\nAnd I could, we mention companies I'm\nworking with, how about Lockheed Martin.\n\n253\n00:14:22.373 --> 00:14:25.820\nPurely fictitious, by the way,\njust having fun here.\n\n254\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.739\nAnd I could attach a charm.\n\n255\n00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:32.167\nWe're living in an emoji world.\n\n256\n00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:37.768\nI'll put a soccer ball,\nbecause there's Euro 2016 action.\n\n257\n00:14:37.768 --> 00:14:38.800\nAll right, and save.\n\n258\n00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.324\nSo there's Indian food with a soccer ball.\n\n259\n00:14:43.324 --> 00:14:47.487\nI know it makes no sense,\nbut there it is, so\n\n260\n00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:52.230\na little emoji action\nin your O365 interface.\n\n261\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.620\nNow, Delve.\n\n262\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.633\nIn referencing this,\nthis leverages Office Graph technology.\n\n263\n00:14:57.633 --> 00:15:01.854\nAnd I could click on Learn More, and\n\n264\n00:15:01.854 --> 00:15:07.950\nit gets me to a nice link\non support.office.com.\n\n265\n00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:13.040\nAnd often people say, especially if you're\nnew, it's just spun up this SharePoint\n\n266\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.040\nonline environment, so there's not gonna\nbe a lot of content there right away.\n\n267\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.102\nSo for people that are curious to\nsee what Delve can do for them,\n\n268\n00:15:21.102 --> 00:15:25.877\nhere's some recommendations is to create\na folder structure in OneDrive and\n\n269\n00:15:25.877 --> 00:15:27.871\nstart up loading some content.\n\n270\n00:15:27.871 --> 00:15:32.149\nAlso, storing and\nsharing documents in SharePoint Online or\n\n271\n00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:37.340\nOffice 365 Is a way to start taking\nadvantage of what Delve has to offer.\n\n272\n00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.133\nSo right now it's rather sparse,\nto say the least.\n\n273\n00:15:43.133 --> 00:15:44.034\nThere's a pop-up there.\n\n274\n00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:51.264\nOkay, let's go to home again.\n\n275\n00:15:51.264 --> 00:15:51.792\nAll right, go back to where I was.\n\n276\n00:15:51.792 --> 00:15:57.446\nAnd let's go to video now.\n\n277\n00:15:57.446 --> 00:16:01.758\nSo there's great video hosting\ncapabilities with various\n\n278\n00:16:01.758 --> 00:16:03.660\nchannels we can specify.\n\n279\n00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.200\nSo I can create a channel, give it a name.\n\n280\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.730\nTV, that's available, okay.\n\n281\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.594\nCreate, you can't have\nduplicate channel names.\n\n282\n00:16:14.594 --> 00:16:17.552\nThat's creating a channel now.\n\n283\n00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:22.411\nSo if you've used Vimeo or\nother tools like that this won't\n\n284\n00:16:22.411 --> 00:16:26.890\nbe too shocking for you,\nthere's Channel Settings.\n\n285\n00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:34.340\nStorage Metrics, I can click on here.\n\n286\n00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.250\nSo Site Collection, storage size.\n\n287\n00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.210\nSo if we're talking video we\nhave a restrictive quota.\n\n288\n00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.890\nThen Vimeo's gonna get to\nchomp that up significantly.\n\n289\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:45.550\n>> What the heck does that mean?\n\n290\n00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.740\n>> It's gonna conceal\na lot of your resources.\n\n291\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thank you for translating that.\n\n292\n00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.720\n>> Yes, I have no idea why I said that.\n\n293\n00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.830\nIt just came out.\n\n294\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.988\nAll right, and then I can assign\npermissions here, Owners, Editors, and,\n\n295\n00:16:56.988 --> 00:16:57.565\nViewers.\n\n296\n00:16:57.565 --> 00:17:02.220\nAnd then I can expose\na download link to one, two or\n\n297\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.130\nall three of those categories,\nOwners, Editors and Viewers.\n\n298\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.860\nSpotlight, which means I can\nfeature on the channel page so\n\n299\n00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.900\nthat the landing page of the channel,\nI can feature a variety of videos there or\n\n300\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.100\nat least thumbnails of those videos.\n\n301\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:22.160\nAnd I can also enable Yammer conversations\nwith this channel, which I'm not gonna do.\n\n302\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.410\nNow, Word shows a variety of traditional\nOffice apps that are available.\n\n303\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.970\nThis is cool, a little integration\nhere with Dropbox, perhaps\n\n304\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:34.285\nsomewhat surprising given Microsoft's\nOffice preference for OneDrive.\n\n305\n00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:40.730\nBut the CEO is recognizing it's\na heterogeneous world, right?\n\n306\n00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.990\nIt's good to play nice with others.\n\n307\n00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.860\nSo I could add a Dropbox account here.\n\n308\n00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.590\nI can use Sway,\nwe're gonna talk about Sway a little bit.\n\n309\n00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.130\nAnd then Format Painter, which is handy,\n\n310\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.590\nI don't know,\nit's new to the product, that's why.\n\n311\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.520\nBut you're probably used to\nusing the Format Painter for\n\n312\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.780\nyour full-featured versions of Word,\nPowerPoint, so I'll say got it.\n\n313\n00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.761\nAnd various formats here calendars,\nblank formats, and\n\n314\n00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:14.036\nthere's also a nice shortcut here, so\nif I want to save my content in OneDrive,\n\n315\n00:18:14.036 --> 00:18:17.062\nso I can access it from any machine or\ndevice.\n\n316\n00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:21.160\nThen shortcuts to recently opened\ndocuments, and recently saved and\n\n317\n00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.851\nupdated documents in OneDrive\nwill appear right on this page.\n\n318\n00:18:24.851 --> 00:18:25.980\nVery handy.\n\n319\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.562\nSimilarly, get you to close out of there.\n\n320\n00:18:32.334 --> 00:18:36.440\nWe have a similar experience for\nExcel and PowerPoint.\n\n321\n00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:43.236\nOneNote we already looked at, and\nlet's go to Sway, as promised.\n\n322\n00:18:43.236 --> 00:18:47.063\nIf you're like me and not really\na graphic design guy or not really,\n\n323\n00:18:47.063 --> 00:18:49.210\ndon't have design chops.\n\n324\n00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.480\nSway makes it really easy to create\npolished looking presentations that will\n\n325\n00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.130\nwow people.\n\n326\n00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.100\nSo here we are at the Sway site,\nthis is very cool.\n\n327\n00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.090\nI can create presentations,\ninteractive reports, and more.\n\n328\n00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.563\nThere's some nice examples.\n\n329\n00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:11.443\nJust scrolling down the page I can send,\nor share this presentation,\n\n330\n00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.960\nor a document that I've\ncreated with a link.\n\n331\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.874\nSo let's see what happens\nwhen I click on Get Started.\n\n332\n00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:22.870\nIt takes a while to load up.\n\n333\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.390\nIn the meantime you've got\na nice hexagonal pattern.\n\n334\n00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.708\nReminds me of the guy that did those\nreally complex drawings where it looked\n\n335\n00:19:29.708 --> 00:19:30.770\nlike you were going up.\n\n336\n00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.964\n>> Escher\n>> Escher!\n\n337\n00:19:31.964 --> 00:19:33.817\nThank you, Escher drawings.\n\n338\n00:19:33.817 --> 00:19:37.762\nA little Jeopardy here,\na little game show.\n\n339\n00:19:37.762 --> 00:19:42.528\nOkay, so nice little tutorial here, or\nthis quick thing here, Adventures, so\n\n340\n00:19:42.528 --> 00:19:45.207\nyou can talk about your\ngoing on a field trip.\n\n341\n00:19:45.207 --> 00:19:50.186\nYou got a little variety of combinations\nof content types with pictures and text,\n\n342\n00:19:50.186 --> 00:19:52.650\neven video you can utilize in your Sway.\n\n343\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:59.520\nYou can drag in content from YouTube,\nPicasa, Bing, Flickr.\n\n344\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.630\nWherever the data is,\nyou can bring it in and\n\n345\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:07.010\ncreate really cool content with minimal\neffort, that's the key, minimal effort.\n\n346\n00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:11.350\nCuz if you're like me, plus,\nit comes up with a suggested\n\n347\n00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.883\narrangement of design elements\non the page and it shows you.\n\n348\n00:20:15.883 --> 00:20:18.680\nAnd you can say remix, and\nget a different combination.\n\n349\n00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.924\nSo I'll say Create New, it takes\na few minutes to get to this page or\n\n350\n00:20:23.924 --> 00:20:28.281\nprobably a minute but it seems like\nfive minutes, and now I'm at the page.\n\n351\n00:20:28.281 --> 00:20:33.517\nI won't actually create a Sway,\nI'm just showing you the design I want so\n\n352\n00:20:33.517 --> 00:20:35.886\nI can title a Sway, Sway Hey Hey!\n\n353\n00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:37.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And add content.\n\n354\n00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.370\nSo various content types,\nas mentioned before, image,\n\n355\n00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.845\nvideo, tweets I can bring in.\n\n356\n00:20:43.845 --> 00:20:47.540\nSo whatever mish-mash or\nmash-up I wanna create, I can do, and\n\n357\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.950\nSway makes sense of it and\npresents it in a really cool way.\n\n358\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.460\nAnd if I don't like it,\nI can say hey, remix, that does that.\n\n359\n00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.250\nSo and then there is authors here.\n\n360\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:01.159\nI can share it, the ellipses here, I can\nduplicate the Sway then maybe modify it.\n\n361\n00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:08.475\nSo if I wanna make some slight change\nthere's various options on the menu for\n\n362\n00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:14.090\ncards and design in various layouts and\nthen again remix.\n\n363\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.070\nSo if you don't like the assemblage,\nyou can just say do it again.\n\n364\n00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.220\nSo it's a fun tool to play around with,\n\n365\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.522\nand it's part of something that your users\nmight like to do to create something\n\n366\n00:21:25.522 --> 00:21:28.274\nthat's not just your\nstandard PowerPoint deck.\n\n367\n00:21:28.274 --> 00:21:30.281\nMaybe they're bored of creating those and\n\n368\n00:21:30.281 --> 00:21:33.570\nthey don't have the skills to\nmodify templates in PowerPoint.\n\n369\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.420\nAnd they could come up\nwith a really funky,\n\n370\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.090\nengaging presentation\nwith multimedia

00:00:20.038\nI'm you host Mike Rodrick and today we\nare doing our advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:23.700\nAnd specifically in this episode we\ngonna be diving into the world of\n\n5\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.930\ngovernance, right?\n\n6\n00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.550\nWe've talked about governance\nin several episodes,\n\n7\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.330\nwe've stressed its importance\nall the way through, right.\n\n8\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.290\nFrom the planning phase at the very\nbeginning to our implementation phase,\n\n9\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.590\nto our maintenance phase or,\nyou know, once we've got share point\n\n10\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.600\ninfrastructure set up and\nrunning, governance doesn't stop.\n\n11\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.360\nIt must continue,\nit's a very important part.\n\n12\n00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.967\nAnd here to help us understand the details\non how it works is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n13\n00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:48.908\nHow you doing Mark?\n\n14\n00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:49.731\n>> Thanks Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:54.181\nYeah, so three key words in governance\nwe'll be looking at policies,\n\n16\n00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:56.120\nprocedures, and processes.\n\n17\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.230\nA mistake many organizations make\nwith this SharePoint deployment,\n\n18\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.020\nbecause it often costs a lot of money or\nmay be part of an enterprise agreement.\n\n19\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.020\nBut in any event they think okay we sealed\nout the big bucks it should just work now.\n\n20\n00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.390\nOr if not it's IT's problem,\nthey'll figure out how to implement and\n\n21\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.320\nwhat to implement.\n\n22\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.290\nThat is a colossal mistake and it's\ngoing to be a recipe for aggravation and\n\n23\n00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.050\nthen people start blaming SharePoint for\nwhy their deployment\n\n24\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.560\nhas gone when the truth of the matter\nis it all starts with governance.\n\n25\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.739\nEven before planning for\nscaling software, hardware requirements,\n\n26\n00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:39.172\nwhether your architecture model on prem,\nin Azure, SharePoint online or\n\n27\n00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:44.626\na hybrid approach even before that,\ngovernance needs to be established.\n\n28\n00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:48.058\nAnd IT certainly has\nan investment in that and\n\n29\n00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:53.659\nshould be involved in those decisions and\ncan be a valuable contributor,\n\n30\n00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.624\nbut the buy in has to happen at the C\nlevel or the project is likely to\n\n31\n00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:03.138\neither fail badly or\nonly be adopted by a fraction of the user\n\n32\n00:02:03.138 --> 00:02:08.450\npopulation while leaving vast\ncapabilities unused in SharePoint.\n\n33\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.360\nSo we're banging the drum\nof governance today.\n\n34\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.050\nAs we go through this episode you might\nnot even be sure what governance is.\n\n35\n00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.990\nGovernance is who decides who decides.\n\n36\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.620\nSo a governance committee, for\nexample, would basically embolden and\n\n37\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.340\nempower certain people to make decisions\non behalf of the organization.\n\n38\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.440\nOkay, so this, again, IT can implement and\nhave some input in governance,\n\n39\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.430\nbut governance has to\ncome from business units.\n\n40\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.160\nBecause SharePoint is a tool for business.\n\n41\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.720\nEspecially because,\n\n42\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.810\nworkflow capabilities allow us now\nto move a lot of other processes,\n\n43\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.790\nmaybe paper based or with some other\ntechnology into a SharePoint context.\n\n44\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.200\nAnything you can dream up technology wise,\nwe can implement as a part of a workflow.\n\n45\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.210\nThat could be some basic\napproval workflows or for\n\n46\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.710\npublishing, to really complex\nprocesses in the organization,\n\n47\n00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.810\naccessing all kinds of external databases,\ninternal sources.\n\n48\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.960\nSo you can really tighten\nup your workflow,\n\n49\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.420\nwhether they're producing widget say or\nintellectual property or what have you.\n\n50\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.963\nSo we will look at the various\nconcepts of governance,\n\n51\n00:03:19.963 --> 00:03:24.211\nkey elements of governance,\nand then planning for\n\n52\n00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:29.865\ngovernance in your SharePoint\n2016 environment, all right.\n\n53\n00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:34.248\nSo a misconception about governance,\npeople think it has something to\n\n54\n00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:37.750\ndo with security, or\ngovernance equals permissions.\n\n55\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.380\nThat is not the case, permission certainly\ncan support the governance plan,\n\n56\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.110\nwe always want to keep in mind\nthe law of least privilege.\n\n57\n00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.400\nPeople should have access to the tools and\nbe able to do their job but\n\n58\n00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.640\nwe shouldn't grant\nunnecessary permissions.\n\n59\n00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.810\nFor example not everyone needs\nto be a farm administrator,\n\n60\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.890\ntypically only a very small\nnumber of farm admins are needed.\n\n61\n00:04:01.082 --> 00:04:05.790\nAll right, so what does governance help\nus avoid and why is it so beneficial?\n\n62\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.550\nWe can have, just like urban planning, if\nyou're planning neighborhoods or cities or\n\n63\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.730\nregions, if there's no over-arching plan,\nyou're going to get a mish mash\n\n64\n00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.760\nof neighborhoods and inefficiencies and\ncontent sprawl, you can think of it as.\n\n65\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.120\nSo, we've certainly pitched the idea of\npruning content, deleting expired content,\n\n66\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.550\nand certainly not moving, let's say you're\nnew to SharePoint, the last thing you\n\n67\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.250\nwanna do is start transporting all\nthat old content into SharePoint.\n\n68\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.600\nRemember, you can search all kinds\nof content sources right from\n\n69\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.700\nwithin SharePoint while\nleaving it where it is.\n\n70\n00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.890\nSo, what should be created in SharePoint?\n\n71\n00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.320\nNew collaborative content\nis a prime candidate,\n\n72\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.100\neverything else can be indexed in place.\n\n73\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.590\nOkay, quality management policies for\nthe content.\n\n74\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.520\nSo, rather than just anyone and their dog\nbeing allowed to create site collections,\n\n75\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.350\nfor example,\nyou might have some processes in place\n\n76\n00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.110\nthat determine who gets to\ncreate site collections.\n\n77\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.890\nYou might have quotas in place,\nthese are governance decisions.\n\n78\n00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.060\nNow, in terms of the look and\n\n79\n00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.540\nfeel of the site, you don't want everyone\nwith the capability to have a dramatically\n\n80\n00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.440\ndifferent looking site collection for\ntheir department.\n\n81\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.838\nFrom a user perspective, it's confusing\nand disorienting if it's a completely\n\n82\n00:05:22.838 --> 00:05:25.963\ndifferent experience navigating\ndifferent team sites or\n\n83\n00:05:25.963 --> 00:05:28.334\ndepartmental sites in your organization.\n\n84\n00:05:28.334 --> 00:05:30.750\nSo that's also a governance issue.\n\n85\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.420\nVery few people should have SharePoint\ndesigner permission to be able to\n\n86\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.090\ndrastically modify the look and\n\n87\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.650\nfeel of SharePoint through things\nlike master pages, for example.\n\n88\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.520\nOkay, escalation procedures.\n\n89\n00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.120\nSo you need to have a chain of\ncommand when it comes to SharePoint.\n\n90\n00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.510\nSo disputes are resolved and\n\n91\n00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.280\nif not, everyone knows who\nto appeal to if you like.\n\n92\n00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.810\nOkay and\n\n93\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.450\nthen does the implementation strategy\nmap correctly the business objectives?\n\n94\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.660\nSo you always want to figure out how\nis SharePoint delivering value to our\n\n95\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.440\norganization.\n\n96\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.620\nAnd you also need to be in\ncompliance with various\n\n97\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.500\nregulations determined by\nthe geography in which you operate.\n\n98\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.060\nYou might be a multi national\ncorporation subject to\n\n99\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.500\nall kinds of different privacy\nlegislations, for example.\n\n100\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.710\nVarious standards may apply\nin your line of business and\n\n101\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.390\ndepending on where you work.\n\n102\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.631\nI don't see us getting any less\nregulations going forward when it comes\n\n103\n00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:34.934\nto privacy and compliance.\n\n104\n00:06:34.934 --> 00:06:36.730\n>> It's probably just the opposite.\n\n105\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.060\n>> Exactly, more, okay.\n\n106\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.850\nThere's also some optional\ntechnologies you may want to use,\n\n107\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.520\nlike document sets and document IDs,\nwhich we discussed in another episode.\n\n108\n00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.950\nSo that's not something\nthat's essential to use,\n\n109\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.729\nit may be of use in your organization so\nagain, that's a governance issue.\n\n110\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:04.160\nSocial computing features now impact or\n\n111\n00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.970\nshould be designed by governance as well,\nor decided on.\n\n112\n00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.960\nFor example do we want\nto allow social tagging?\n\n113\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.690\nDo we want to allow hashtags,\nmentions with the at symbol?\n\n114\n00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.710\nFor some organizations all that\nis considered a distraction and\n\n115\n00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.460\ntaking away from the prime\nfocus of the business.\n\n116\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.720\nWhere as other organizations more embrace\nthat technology because a lot of people\n\n117\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.300\nalready use LinkedIn, probably Facebook\nand maybe some other social media sites.\n\n118\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.290\nSo they see no harm in using some of those\nsame social tagging concepts in-house and\n\n119\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.690\nin fact, they would actively encourage it.\n\n120\n00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.160\nShould we deploy Yammer?\n\n121\n00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.240\nThat's a question that you\ncan decide as well, or\n\n122\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.160\njust use the built-in social\nnetworking in SharePoint.\n\n123\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.189\nOkay, now let's say we have\na multi-farm environment.\n\n124\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.454\nOr even if we have just a single farm,\nhow are we classifying metadata?\n\n125\n00:07:54.454 --> 00:07:59.587\nSo we talked in another episode about\ncontent types, which is a unique\n\n126\n00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:05.171\ngrouping of metadata columns Who gets\nto decide definitions for metadata?\n\n127\n00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:09.157\nFor, now, it's something might seem\nobvious, like a customer field, for\n\n128\n00:08:09.157 --> 00:08:10.180\nexample.\n\n129\n00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.460\nBut the way that marketing defines, or the\ninformation of interest to marketing in\n\n130\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.680\na customer field,\nmay be different from an order fulfillment\n\n131\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.820\ndivision's interest in the customer field.\n\n132\n00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.160\nSo it's not like you can't have differing\ndefinitions for some metadata, but\n\n133\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.752\nyou need to define, in most organizations,\n\n134\n00:08:30.752 --> 00:08:35.260\nit behooves them to design\nfarm wide definitions for\n\n135\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.910\nmetadata so everyone knows this\ncustomer field has these restrictions.\n\n136\n00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.550\nIt's a text field.\n\n137\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.030\nOr you might have an ID number field,\nfor example.\n\n138\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.860\nThere's all kinds of different metadata\nyou could populate in site columns,\n\n139\n00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.740\nstandardizing definitions will\nmake everyone's life easier.\n\n140\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.310\nThat still allows for exceptions,\nsay, at a site collection level.\n\n141\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.940\nBut it makes sense, again,\nto have a content type hub,\n\n142\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.832\nwhich is a central site, you've defined\nmetadata columns and content types.\n\n143\n00:09:07.832 --> 00:09:11.260\nAnd then, any site collection\nin the organization can consume\n\n144\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.440\nfrom those content types and\nmake additional modifications or\n\n145\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.480\nadd additional columns, if necessary.\n\n146\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.350\nThat, what I just described,\nis a governance issue.\n\n147\n00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.550\nOkay, records management.\n\n148\n00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.160\nDo we wanna allow for things like in place\nrecords management, where the record stays\n\n149\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.110\nin the site collection or\ndocument library where it is, for example?\n\n150\n00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:37.980\nOr should records all be moved to a site\ntemplate type of records center enterprise\n\n151\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.160\ntemplate which is designed to handle\nlarge numbers of records in one place?\n\n152\n00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.920\nSo, whether you're gonna have\nin place records management or\n\n153\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.170\nmove it to a separate site,\nthat's a governance decision.\n\n154\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.950\nWhat kind of customization\nare you going to allow on sites?\n\n155\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.050\nWe talked about SharePoint designer, are\nyou gonna allow for Sandboxed Solutions?\n\n156\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:02.010\nSo, some custom code can run in\nsite collections, with limitations,\n\n157\n00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.630\nwhich we've already talked\nabout in another episode.\n\n158\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.878\nSo, whether or not to allow sandboxed\nsolutions, also a governance issue.\n\n159\n00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:16.360\nWhat are the key areas of governance\nin terms of information architecture?\n\n160\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.910\nWe talked about metadata already.\n\n161\n00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.140\nYou might have,\nin terms of content storage,\n\n162\n00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.970\nyou might have different\nversions of the same document\n\n163\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.080\nliving in different parts of your\nSharePoint farm infrastructure.\n\n164\n00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.660\nThat could be problematic.\n\n165\n00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.430\nSo even, for example, the context menu\nwhen you can send to another depository,\n\n166\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:38.560\na document center, a record center,\nyou have the ability, or you could have\n\n167\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.180\nthe ability, to leave a copy in place and\nmake another copy at the destination.\n\n168\n00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.650\nOr you could move that document and\nleave a link, or simply move the document.\n\n169\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.400\nSo if you are going to, and\nthere may be legitimate reasons for having\n\n170\n00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.200\nmultiple copies of the same document\nliving in different places in the farm.\n\n171\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.700\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n172\n00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.100\nthere needs to be a reason\nwhy that is the case.\n\n173\n00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.770\nOr some organizations might just\nwant a single copy of any document\n\n174\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.570\nexisting in the farm.\n\n175\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.610\nAnother governance decision is whether or\nnot to allow versioning.\n\n176\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.110\nNow, we've talked about the improvements\nin terms of shredded storage\n\n177\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.330\nsince SQL 2012,\nwhich means that if we allow 10 versions,\n\n178\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.350\nin the old days we used to have 10\ntimes the file storage requirements.\n\n179\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.680\nNow we don't have that,\nthanks to Shredded Storage.\n\n180\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.270\nBut still, deciding on whether or not you\nwant versioning is a key consideration\n\n181\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.870\nthat should be decided by governance.\n\n182\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.260\nNow, it's not like this governance\ncommittee has to decide all this.\n\n183\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.860\nWhat they do have to decide, though,\nis who gets to make the decision.\n\n184\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.869\nSo, they might say, you know what,\n\n185\n00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:41.130\nlocal divisions can make their own\ndecision on versioning versioning.\n\n186\n00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.840\nOr maybe site collection\nadministrators have that capability,\n\n187\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.470\nwhatever they think is best is\nfine in terms of whether or\n\n188\n00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.010\nnot they want versioning,\nmajor versions, minor versions.\n\n189\n00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.440\nSo, remember, we have a delegated\nadministration model at SharePoint.\n\n190\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.050\nWe, as the farm admins, definitely do not\nwant to be making all these decisions.\n\n191\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.430\nWe want to empower more localized\nadministration through site collection\n\n192\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.200\nadministrators.\n\n193\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.250\nOkay.\n\n194\n00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.175\nNow, in terms of SharePoint 2016 farms and\n\n195\n00:12:10.175 --> 00:12:14.640\nservers, occasionally you hear\nabout somebody getting fired, or\n\n196\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.850\nat least reprimanded cuz they set\nup a rogue wireless access point.\n\n197\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.230\nThey hid it under their desk, and they\nthought, well, no one's gonna find this,\n\n198\n00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:25.270\nnot realizing it's quite easy to scan for\nrogue wireless access points.\n\n199\n00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.908\nThat could be a serious concern if you're\ndealing with sensitive information, and\n\n200\n00:12:29.908 --> 00:12:33.570\nit might grant someone access to\na portion of the network where\n\n201\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.680\nsome data could be compromised.\n\n202\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.510\nSo, similarly,\nwe could potentially have rogue farms,\n\n203\n00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.750\nespecially if you're dealing with some\nIT people that know how to set them up.\n\n204\n00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.723\nThey might just decide I'm gonna set up my\nown farm, and not a responsible dev farm,\n\n205\n00:12:47.723 --> 00:12:52.415\nbut just a farm for their enjoyment to use\nor maybe to send in their own governance\n\n206\n00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:57.069\npermissions and inviting a few employees\nto their private farm, if you will.\n\n207\n00:12:57.069 --> 00:13:00.390\nSo that's probably not good.\n\n208\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.610\nYou might have an issue with applications,\n\n209\n00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.430\nespecially if you have\na lot of customizations or\n\n210\n00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.450\napplications running in your environment,\napps that may not play well with others.\n\n211\n00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.350\nSo, it could either,\nthey could either be poorly written and\n\n212\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.260\nconsume a lot of resources, and or they\ncould be legitimate security risks, again,\n\n213\n00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.950\nexposing more sensitive data to\neyes that should not see it.\n\n214\n00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.110\nOkay, and then another problem with\nrogue servers is you might have,\n\n215\n00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.700\nor just servers in general\nin your SharePoint farm,\n\n216\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.880\ninconsistent administration of\npolicies and compliance standards.\n\n217\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.310\nYou might have issues regarding training.\n\n218\n00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:48.060\nSo, obviously, I have a self-interest\nin promoting training.\n\n219\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.430\nHowever, the fact remains I can\nhave a self-interest in it, and\n\n220\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.620\nit can still be true.\n\n221\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.332\nWe talked about the importance\nof training end users and\n\n222\n00:13:56.332 --> 00:13:57.620\nsite collection administrators.\n\n223\n00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.630\nDefinitely farm administrators\nneed to be trained as well.\n\n224\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.120\nFor example,\nthey may not be backing up effectively, or\n\n225\n00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.980\nthey might just use the very\nconvenient wizard from central admin.\n\n226\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.040\nOr they might have have\na PowerShell script, for example,\n\n227\n00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.680\nto automate backup procedures\nwithout realizing that to recover\n\n228\n00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.060\na fully functioning SharePoint farm,\n\n229\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:24.170\nyou need to backup more than just what's\navailable from the central admin console.\n\n230\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.380\nThings like iOS certificates,\ncustomizations,\n\n231\n00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.860\nand more,\nwhich we covered in another episode.\n\n232\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.060\nSo, as they say, a little knowledge\ncan be a dangerous thing.\n\n233\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.650\nThe admin might think, okay, I've covered\nit all up because I do a full farm back\n\n234\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.500\nup, and maybe some incrementals in there,\nmaybe have a third party tool.\n\n235\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.400\nBut the third party tool might\nnot capture everything and\n\n236\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.800\nall the customizations you need\nin case a total disaster strikes,\n\n237\n00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.980\ntornado, you loose all your hardware,\nyou have to do a restore.\n\n238\n00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:55.050\nAnd then that's not the time to,\nwe didn't back-up everything we needed.\n\n239\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.130\nWhich brings up another point.\n\n240\n00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.490\nIf you're not doing trial\nrestores periodically,\n\n241\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.640\nhow do you know your back-up\nroutine is accessible?\n\n242\n00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.050\nYou can't know, I promise you.\n\n243\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.350\nYou cannot know.\n\n244\n00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.480\nBecause there might be some\nlittle aspect of the back-up,\n\n245\n00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.670\nor besides just missing key components\nrelated to your SharePoint farm backup,\n\n246\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.940\nthere might be something that's\nreporting backing up successfully,\n\n247\n00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.990\nthe event viewer or maybe you've got\nSystem Center Operations Manager,\n\n248\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.610\nit's not reporting any\nerrors with your backup.\n\n249\n00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.710\nIf you don't do a trial restore, you can't\nknow the backup has been successful.\n\n250\n00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.540\nAnd that might produce the dreaded RPE.\n\n251\n00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.680\n>> Yes, we don't want that.\n\n252\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.400\n>> No, the resume producing event.\n\n253\n00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:37.670\nOkay, and then, in terms of customization,\nanother governance issue.\n\n254\n00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.610\nWhat customization tools can be used?\n\n255\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.150\nSharePoint Designer, 2013?\n\n256\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.810\nAnother tool?\n\n257\n00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.040\nRemember, Info Path 2013,\nSharePoint Designer 2013?\n\n258\n00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.290\nThose versions aren't gonna be updated.\n\n259\n00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.310\nThey'll still work fine with\nSharePoint 2016, vNext, etc.\n\n260\n00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.520\nBut do you want people using those tools?\n\n261\n00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.450\nWho should have access to them?\n\n262\n00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.750\nWhat about apps?\n\n263\n00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.413\nWho gets to add apps to the site?\n\n264\n00:16:00.413 --> 00:16:03.358\nWho gets to decide which apps get added?\n\n265\n00:16:03.358 --> 00:16:05.201\nSo, there's an app catalog for that.\n\n266\n00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:08.895\nAnd you can certainly restrict access to\nthe Windows store for third party apps.\n\n267\n00:16:08.895 --> 00:16:13.295\nPerhaps you or\nsomebody has to approve, one by one,\n\n268\n00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:17.140\nall the apps that people may want to use.\n\n269\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.950\nAnd if they have a need for another app,\nthey have to make a request.\n\n270\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.790\nAnd there's a mechanism for that, as well.\n\n271\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.430\nBut generally, you don't want to just\nopen it wide to the Windows store,\n\n272\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:30.060\nbecause there may be some unwanted\ninteractions with existing apps,\n\n273\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.150\nor maybe the app hasn't\nbeen tested thoroughly and\n\n274\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.390\nit could produce some security\nissues in your environment.\n\n275\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:40.200\nSo I always like to restrict\nthe number of apps users are using.\n\n276\n00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.570\nNow a little aside here,\nin the BYOD environment, people, remember,\n\n277\n00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.480\nit's their own device.\n\n278\n00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.450\nSo let's say I bring my tablet in for\na consulting engagement.\n\n279\n00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.360\nI have some personal apps and data and\n\n280\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.770\nthem presumably there'll be some\nbusiness apps and data on that device.\n\n281\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:17:00.000\nA problem can occur is that as a network\nadmin you might not know all of\n\n282\n00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.370\nthe apps that are running on a particular\ndevice that can access business data.\n\n283\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.610\nSo now, we have tools in the cloud so\nwe can get an enumeration,\n\n284\n00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:12.370\njust like System Center\nConfiguration Manager on-premises,\n\n285\n00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.470\nor Windows Intune in the cloud,\nnow we can have\n\n286\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:20.530\nan enumeration of all the software\nthat's running on a particular device.\n\n287\n00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.370\nBecause these cloud services,\nthere's so many of them SASS,\n\n288\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.420\nall kinds of CRM apps and more.\n\n289\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.160\nSo we always, as admins,\nwant to know the software that's running\n\n290\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.040\non machines that we're in a way\nresponsible for or that we're allowing to\n\n291\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.840\naccess some resources on prem or\nin the cloud that we are.\n\n292\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.790\nOkay, what about a source control system,\nanother governance issue.\n\n293\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:53.269\nIn terms of dev team, source control,\nchecking-in, maybe team foundation server,\n\n294\n00:17:53.269 --> 00:17:57.058\nsome such tool to get versioning for\nyour code development.\n\n295\n00:18:02.051 --> 00:18:06.670\nTesting procedures for, and\nverification for, site upgrades.\n\n296\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.340\nStandards for packaging and\ninsulation of solutions and features.\n\n297\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.300\nWhat about web parts, custom web parts?\n\n298\n00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.160\nWill you have standards about those,\n\n299\n00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.260\nshould users be allowed to install\njust any web part, or again\n\n300\n00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.140\nshould they be allowed to only install\nweb parts from a restricted gallery.\n\n301\n00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.020\nBranding, what branding will be used?\n\n302\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.330\nThat's something again should be standard\nacross the organization, you don't want\n\n303\n00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.230\npeople making cute modifications of your\nlogo, because branding is very important.\n\n304\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.150\nLet's look now to key elements\nof a governance plan.\n\n305\n00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.610\nSo vision statements, some people\nlove them, some people hate them, but\n\n306\n00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.030\nit doesn't hurt.\n\n307\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:58.308\nYou can set out what you wanna accomplish\nin your SharePoint 2016 governance plan.\n\n308\n00:19:01.787 --> 00:19:04.941\nAnd the vision statement makes sense\nto do at the beginning of the project,\n\n309\n00:19:04.941 --> 00:19:06.640\nnot after because you forgot to do it.\n\n310\n00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.400\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.370\n>> After you've created the governance\n\n312\n00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.352\nplan, it's probably too late for\na vision plan.\n\n313\n00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:16.282\nAlthough if you're going to revisit\nthe governance plan in a year or two,\n\n314\n00:19:16.282 --> 00:19:19.982\nor before the next major SharePoint\nupgrade you're performing,\n\n315\n00:19:19.982 --> 00:19:24.552\nit might be a good idea to create a vision\nplan for governance at that point.\n\n316\n00:19:24.552 --> 00:19:29.310\nWhat are the rules and\nresponsibilities for a governance plan?\n\n317\n00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:34.500\nSo if you've done any ITIL courses, the IT\nInfrastructure Library based in London,\n\n318\n00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.940\nEngland, they have some great policies and\nprocedures and methodologies.\n\n319\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.720\nWhether it's deploying a software or\nhardware refresh.\n\n320\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.690\nWhether it's developing a project,\ndoing some kind of rollout.\n\n321\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.490\nA lot of good standards, often they're\niterative, in other words it's a circle,\n\n322\n00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.670\nyou're never actually done, because when\nyou've finished implementing the previous\n\n323\n00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:59.380\nproject it's probably time to start\nplanning the next one, so but\n\n324\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:05.190\nsome questions to answer are who will\nbe responsible in SharePoint for\n\n325\n00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:06.710\nthe technical deployment?\n\n326\n00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:11.300\nSo the hardware and software,\nsizing, acquiring that.\n\n327\n00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.330\nLicensing, hardware, testing.\n\n328\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:21.370\nWho gets to install new features, apps,\nadd-ins now as we call them in 2016?\n\n329\n00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:26.140\nWho gets to setup new sites,\nis that something that anyone can do or\n\n330\n00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.170\nare only certain people\nallowed to setup new sites,\n\n331\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.910\nlike site collection administrators for\nexample?\n\n332\n00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.810\nWhat about service level agreements?\n\n333\n00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.380\nWhat should they be?\n\n334\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.530\nHow much data are you willing to lose?\n\n335\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.824\nIf you say zero, that's gonna cost more\nto influence that kind of hardware\n\n336\n00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:45.140\nrestructure then if you're\nwilling to live with,\n\n337\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.320\nwe can live with losing 30\nminutes of data at the most.\n\n338\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.100\nThat gives you a little more flexibility\nin terms of how you size a level of\n\n339\n00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.240\nredundancy in a number of servers\nrunning SharePoint in your environment.\n\n340\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.909\nWho gets to grant permissions or access\nto various site collections and sites?\n\n341\n00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.710\nCan users modify Web parts\non sites that they manage?\n\n342\n00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.930\nOr is that something that only\ncertain coders can do, for example?\n\n343\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.928\nWho is responsible for\nthe management of metadata?\n\n344\n00:21:17.928 --> 00:21:21.040\nMaybe reviewing metadata columns\nperiodically to make sure you're capturing\n\n345\n00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.688\nthe data you want.\n\n346\n00:21:21.688 --> 00:21:25.010\nStandardizing of metadata.\n\n347\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.470\nIncorporating various divisions\nas we talked about before.\n\n348\n00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.960\nWhat if there's a need for\na new content type?\n\n349\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.080\nWho should that request go to?\n\n350\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.650\nHow does someone justify their need for\na request for new content type?\n\n351\n00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.190\nRemember content types let\nus do all kinds of things.\n\n352\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.580\nIn the farm.\nI'm gonna avoid going down that rabbit\n\n353\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.772\nhole, cuz I've talked at length.\n\n354\n00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:44.284\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n355\n00:21:44.284 --> 00:21:46.290\n>> But, I am a fan of content types.\n\n356\n00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.444\nMaybe I'll get a t-shirt.\n\n357\n00:21:47.444 --> 00:21:49.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I heart content types.\n\n358\n00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.832\n>> There you go.\n>> Yeah, okay, Now,\n\n359\n00:21:54.832 --> 00:21:56.960\nso we should have various rules.\n\n360\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.160\nNow, sometimes in a small organization,\n\n361\n00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.850\nthere may be somebody\nwearing more than one hat.\n\n362\n00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.330\nBut you need executive level sponsorship.\n\n363\n00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:10.830\nSo C level ideally, or VP level,\nbecause there is going to be inevitable\n\n364\n00:22:12.305 --> 00:22:15.635\ndelay and inertia getting this new\nproject off, especially if your\n\n365\n00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:19.605\ncompany's been established for a long time\nand you newly transitioned to SharePoint.\n\n366\n00:22:19.605 --> 00:22:21.265\nPeople hate change and\n\n367\n00:22:21.265 --> 00:22:24.970\nthey're used to doing things a certain way\nwith whatever systems you have in place.\n\n368\n00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.520\nYou're asking them to\ndo things differently.\n\n369\n00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.810\nThe users are people involved in\nyour SharePoint deployment and\n\n370\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:35.250\ndecision making don't necessarily\nknow the benefits yet.\n\n371\n00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.840\nAren't sure if they can actually\nrealize then in SharePoint or\n\n372\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.900\nhow many years or months it will\ntake to realize those benefits.\n\n373\n00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:46.330\nSo when the project seems to be bogged\ndown, and enthusiasm is waning,\n\n374\n00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.840\nyou need someone at the C level or\nVP level to champion the project.\n\n375\n00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.910\nOtherwise, it's too easy for it to get\nshuffled to the bottom of priorities and\n\n376\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.800\nnever actually occur.\n\n377\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.700\nGovernance committee,\n\n378\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:03.220\nwhich has responsibility for\nmeeting your governance goals.\n\n379\n00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.410\nBusiness owner would\ncertainly wanna be involved.\n\n380\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.410\nAnd solution administrator would\nbe a good role to have as well.\n\n381\n00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.729\nSo managing what the governance committee\nwants to put into action from a technology\n\n382\n00:23:15.729 --> 00:23:16.496\nperspective.\n\n383\n00:23:18.824 --> 00:23:23.178\nThen from lower down the hierarchy\nin terms of site collections and\n\n384\n00:23:23.178 --> 00:23:25.755\nsites we want to site sponsor an owner.\n\n385\n00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.740\nSo maintain the integrity\nof content on pages.\n\n386\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.200\nA site steward if you will.\n\n387\n00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.370\nSo just someone that's\nresponsible if there's errors or\n\n388\n00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:42.950\nbroken links on a page for example,\nthey're responsible for maintenance and\n\n389\n00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:48.690\nkeeping the subject matter timely,\nas an Internet page, for example.\n\n390\n00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:53.550\nSite designers, it's always good\nto have a customer champion, so\n\n391\n00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.240\na site user champion.\n\n392\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.720\nThis is someone that represents\nthe interests of the rank and\n\n393\n00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.060\nfile employees that will be\ninteracting with the systems,\n\n394\n00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.460\nespecially if you're putting all\nkinds of new workflows in there.\n\n395\n00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.190\nYou have to look at things\nfrom a customer perspective.\n\n396\n00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.590\nNow, if it's just internal use,\n\n397\n00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:13.210\nthe SharePoint deployment,\nthen your customers are the employees.\n\n398\n00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.214\nSo often they're neglected,\n\n399\n00:24:15.214 --> 00:24:19.916\nbecause too much emphasis can be placed\non prettying up the interface and\n\n400\n00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:24.927\nhaving nice ego shots of smiling people\nat the expense of actual usability for\n\n401\n00:24:24.927 --> 00:24:28.087\nthe end user, or\nif you're actually selling and\n\n402\n00:24:28.087 --> 00:24:33.327\nif your customers are gonna be visiting\nyour SharePoint site or your products for\n\n403\n00:24:33.327 --> 00:24:38.218\nexample, you really needed someone\nto champion from their perspective.\n\n404\n00:24:41.615 --> 00:24:45.405\nThere is so much more to say,\nwe're gonna need a second episode.\n\n405\n00:24:45.405 --> 00:24:48.280\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna pass it back to Mike.\n\n406\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.080\n>> All right Mark we appreciate\nthat first look at governance, and\n\n407\n00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.800\nsome of the things that we have to think\nabout, what governance is, in the end,\n\n408\n00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.890\nresponsible for\nwithin our SharePoint deployment.\n\n409\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:03.290\nWe thank you for that, hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching, signing off for\n\n410\n00:25:03.290 -->

00:00:16.174\nat IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.174 --> 00:00:20.970\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and today we\nare doing our Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.650\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're actually doing a part two.\n\n6\n00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.520\nWe're continuing on with our governance\nepisodes, and here to help us,\n\n7\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.360\nof course, with that, is Mr. Mark Ingram.\n\n8\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.470\nHow are you doing, Mark?\n\n9\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.540\n>> Good, thanks, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.720\nRight on.\nSo let's look at some diagrams.\n\n11\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.200\nA diagram is worth a thousand words.\n\n12\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.085\nYou're gonna get 1000 words and\nthe diagrams.\n\n13\n00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:42.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if we can go to my screen please,\n\n14\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.450\nI'm using a TechNet article\nas a starting point.\n\n15\n00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.390\nNow, you're gonna say,\nwait a minute Wait a minute, it says 2013.\n\n16\n00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.630\nThat's ok because the principles for\n\n17\n00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.890\nSharePoint 2013 are directly\ntranslatable to 2016.\n\n18\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.360\nIn Microsoft there's often a lag in\nupdating some diagrams and content.\n\n19\n00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.000\nSometimes, you get the drop down link,\n\n20\n00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.603\nI'll show you here where it says other\nversions, and it goes [LAUGH] even older.\n\n21\n00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:09.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> SharePoint 2010.\n\n22\n00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.930\nBut, Microsoft is very good,\nI've found lately,\n\n23\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.510\nif I go at some resource in TechNet,\nthere's almost always a way to get to\n\n24\n00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.990\nthe same kind of guidance for a different\nversion, whether it's a server product, or\n\n25\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.360\nwhat have you, SharePoint Exchange,\nWindows Server, so that's very helpful.\n\n26\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.700\n>> They've done a really good\njob recently with that so.\n\n27\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.735\n>> Thank you for that Microsoft.\n\n28\n00:01:31.735 --> 00:01:32.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n29\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.150\n>> You do a search and\nyou find a document on an older version,\n\n30\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.920\nand you just cannot find that same\ndocument for the current version.\n\n31\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.820\nNow they got that little dropdown list,\nand you can switch versions.\n\n32\n00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.372\nFantastic.\n\n33\n00:01:42.372 --> 00:01:44.750\nAll right, so what do you got for\nus for governance there.\n\n34\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.780\n>> It's a beautiful thing.\n\n35\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.180\nOkay, so again,\n\n36\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.430\nthis 2013 guidance is directly\napplicable to your 2016 deployment.\n\n37\n00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.620\nZuma is a cool tool,\nbecause it's a rather dense poster.\n\n38\n00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.500\nIt should be printed two by three feet,\nfrankly.\n\n39\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.930\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna zoom in on portions of it.\n\n40\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.730\nSo I've got that all setup but\nI wanted to say where I'm starting from so\n\n41\n00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.670\nif you wanna grab it and\nyou wanna print this poster as well.\n\n42\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.470\nSo I'll go now over to my PDF reader and\nthis is to help you\n\n43\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.830\nvisualize some of things we talked about\nlast episode and certainly this episode.\n\n44\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.510\nThree different areas of governance\nsegments to be concerned with.\n\n45\n00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.220\nAnd maybe you have the same committee\nresponsible for governance for\n\n46\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.400\nall three, or\nmaybe you subdivide the committee.\n\n47\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.460\nIT governance in terms of software and\nservices, hardware refresh cycles,\n\n48\n00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.100\nsoftware deployment and\nsupport, that sort of thing.\n\n49\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.940\nWe've got information management,\nso the actual content and\n\n50\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.100\ndata, how is it going to be stored?\n\n51\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.850\nProvisions, stored in the cloud\naround PRIM or combination.\n\n52\n00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.800\nUpgrades the software to allow for,\nsay power pivot or\n\n53\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.240\nsome new tools, a new way of using data,\nand then application management.\n\n54\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.490\nSo if you have devs in house, we're\nworking on either Sandbox solutions or\n\n55\n00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.310\napps, add ins.\n\n56\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.870\nSome kind of custom code,\nadding features to your farm.\n\n57\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.960\nThere's a whole governance area for that.\n\n58\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.600\nThat's represented by the green bar.\n\n59\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.720\nNow, also very useful, diagram on\nthe right hand side of your screen,\n\n60\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.080\ngovernance and site types.\n\n61\n00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.250\nSo we don't need total lockdown control,\nsay, over someone's team site.\n\n62\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.550\nSome governance, for sure, but generally\nthe more people who are involved with\n\n63\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.090\nutilizing or reviewing content created,\nthe more governance is required.\n\n64\n00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.100\nSo I like to use the MSN.com portal,\nfor example, or\n\n65\n00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.700\nany new source you might go to, often has\nmillions of readers or tens of millions.\n\n66\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.610\nSo governance is critical there because,\nthe content creation, editing,\n\n67\n00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.870\ndissemination, probably passes\nthrough several stages and\n\n68\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.160\nmay be several different forums.\n\n69\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.570\nSo dev test stage and production and so,\nthe more people that are potentially\n\n70\n00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.470\naffected, it makes more sense to have\nmore governance and control over that.\n\n71\n00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.320\nSo, on the far left here, we have personal\nsights, projects and work spaces,\n\n72\n00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.320\nteam sites, so we're moving up the\nhierarchy here, the little stair steps.\n\n73\n00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.990\nAnd then, so,\nsome kind of Internet home page,\n\n74\n00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.140\neven an intranet page would affect more\npeople and require more governance.\n\n75\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.270\nSo, they often say if you need a total\nlock-down environment, where no\n\n76\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.815\none can do anything without a multi-page,\npaper-based request to do something.\n\n77\n00:04:22.815 --> 00:04:24.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> SharePoint's probably not\n\n78\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.585\na good tool for you.\n\n79\n00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:27.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n80\n00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.480\nlet's get specific with IT Governance, so\nin this next section I'll show you here,\n\n81\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.660\nnotice how there's a tradeoff with these\ndifferent sections we'll be looking at\n\n82\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.090\nbetween centrally managed and\nlocally managed.\n\n83\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.510\nIT governance leans a little to the left,\nif you will, toward centrally managed.\n\n84\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.740\nSo we have things like an IT service\ngovernance, a section there for\n\n85\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.350\nfarm governance,\ncommunications policies is essential.\n\n86\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.520\nAnytime we're making a change,\n\n87\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.340\nor we're moving users to\nthe SharePoint farm concept, at first.\n\n88\n00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.510\nWe need to let them know in advance, so\nthey dont return to work, the day after\n\n89\n00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.340\na holiday on a Tuesday and say, ooh my\ngoodness everything's changed, my workflow\n\n90\n00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.830\nis different, what's this Share Point\nportal stuff, team sites, nobody told me.\n\n91\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.580\nThat's no good, so communication\nhas to be a big part of your plan,\n\n92\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.300\nyou want to get some buy in.\n\n93\n00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.540\nOne way to do this is you can have\ndifferent methods of training it\n\n94\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.350\ncan be a video tutorial, lunch and learn,\na series of emails in the months and\n\n95\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.230\nweeks leading up to, I mean not too many,\nbut a couple months out,\n\n96\n00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.490\none month out a week out and with\nhelpful links in those emails as well.\n\n97\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.450\nThe kind of emails people are gonna want\nto favorite and save, maybe print out for\n\n98\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.290\nfuture reference.\n\n99\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.800\nAnd also, how we want to use\ninteract with the system.\n\n100\n00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.900\nSo that could be, for example, using,\nthink of SharePoint as guard rails.\n\n101\n00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.270\nSo assets in governance and farm admins.\n\n102\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.950\nWe provide some kind of context,\na road to drive on if you'd like.\n\n103\n00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.860\nBut, there's also the sandbox\nelement where there's\n\n104\n00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.680\ngot to be some area of play\nin experimentation as well.\n\n105\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.680\nSo we can tell people what we\nexpect them to do, and we have some\n\n106\n00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.470\ntest sites where they can play around,\nand just get familiar with the product,\n\n107\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.220\nor maybe some VM spinoff where\nit's a practice environment.\n\n108\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.640\nThey get access to a VM for\nan hour a day or something.\n\n109\n00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.570\nThey can do whatever they want.\n\n110\n00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.820\n>> And they know it's not permanent,\n\n111\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.000\nit's a test environment, okay so what\ndo we need to governance specifically,\n\n112\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.530\nwell policies related to security,\ninfrastructure, Web apps,\n\n113\n00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.260\ndata protection, so\nwhere are we storing backups for example?\n\n114\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.330\nIn the cloud,\noff site Site policies so under\n\n115\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.330\nwhat circumstance does a site die, in\nother words, when do we de-provision it?\n\n116\n00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.570\nIs it after a certain number\nof months of lack of use or\n\n117\n00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.330\na year after the site got created,\nespecially with the project site.\n\n118\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.740\nThe project is done, let me save some\ndocuments about best practices and\n\n119\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.380\nwe can shut down that site.\n\n120\n00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.020\nDo we need quota management?\n\n121\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.415\nDo we need a way of asset classification?\n\n122\n00:06:56.415 --> 00:07:01.270\nAnd think of potential risks\nin terms of data leakage.\n\n123\n00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.740\nHow will that impact your business?\n\n124\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.550\nWhat about if we're asking people\nto do things in a new way,\n\n125\n00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.090\nwhat if that service is not available now?\n\n126\n00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.090\nSo the only way to accomplish\ncertain workflow tasks, for example,\n\n127\n00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.290\nis through SharePoint.\n\n128\n00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.210\nBut there's a service that's\ndown they can't work.\n\n129\n00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.450\nI mean if we thought through\nthe implications of that.\n\n130\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.040\nSo that leads us to service level\nagreements, which I always say that if\n\n131\n00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.450\nyou don't have a formal service level\nagreement you have an informal one.\n\n132\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.250\nIn other words get this running ASAP or\nstart looking for another job.\n\n133\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.670\nBut it's much better to have formal\nservice level agreements, and\n\n134\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.260\nthis is a government task,\nsorry, governance tasks.\n\n135\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.320\nSo in other words, how much data are we\nwilling to lose if the database goes down,\n\n136\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.840\nhow many hours do we have to restore it.\n\n137\n00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.070\nYou know what are the standards\nby which we can measure.\n\n138\n00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.077\nIt's good to have measurement then you can\nsay okay, yes the database crashed, but\n\n139\n00:07:48.077 --> 00:07:51.134\nwe told you we should have made\nit a high availability scenario.\n\n140\n00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:54.631\nYou didn't provide budget for\nthat, we promised that we could,\n\n141\n00:07:54.631 --> 00:07:59.019\nwith the resources we have and the farm\ndesign number of servers, we promised that\n\n142\n00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:03.024\nwe could restore any content Say from\na site collection within four hours,\n\n143\n00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:07.250\nit took us three hours twenty minutes so\nwe're within the SLA's agreed upon.\n\n144\n00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.560\nThen there's no yelling or\npulling out hair.\n\n145\n00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.100\nYou may want to adjust the service\nlevel agreements in the future but\n\n146\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.410\nit's good to know what the rules are,\nhow the game should be played.\n\n147\n00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.580\nAre we gonna block installations\nof unauthorized software?\n\n148\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.790\nWhat about patching?\n\n149\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.260\nHow do we test patching?\n\n150\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:30.170\nWe have some VMs spun up to test the\nimpact of hotfixes and SharePoint patches.\n\n151\n00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.070\nWhat about site collection upgrades?\n\n152\n00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.450\nUnder what circumstances or\n\n153\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.840\nwhen are we gonna upgrade from the\nprevious version site collections to 2016?\n\n154\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.170\nLoad balancing, how do we measure\nthe success of the deployment?\n\n155\n00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.410\nFrom a user perspective\nwhats successful to them?\n\n156\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.970\nFast page loading time is great but what\nare the standards, one second average,\n\n157\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.988\ntwo seconds, a quarter of a second?\n\n158\n00:08:54.988 --> 00:08:59.720\nUsers get very antsy when they don't get\ninstant results after clicking a button.\n\n159\n00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.910\nThat brings us to our next section\non information management.\n\n160\n00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.680\nLet's look at some of\nthe governance elements there.\n\n161\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.760\nSo notice now our little\npendulum here has switched over.\n\n162\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.948\nIt's slightly biased towards\nthe loosely managed side.\n\n163\n00:09:15.948 --> 00:09:22.240\nSo webpages, lists,\nwho should access what content.\n\n164\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.230\nNow not just internally, but externally.\n\n165\n00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.550\nDo you have and\nextranet arranged with partners?\n\n166\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.160\nDo you have sites hosted\nin SharePoint online\n\n167\n00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.590\nas a way of collaborating\nwith external users?\n\n168\n00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.590\nWhat about if you wanna make a,\nfor example, a product catalog or\n\n169\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.770\na price list available to\nyour customers externally?\n\n170\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.980\nPresumably with anonymous\naccess from a browser,\n\n171\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.880\nthat has to be considered as well.\n\n172\n00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.800\nVersions, we talked about in\nthe part one governance episode.\n\n173\n00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.220\nNavigation, who's responsible for\ndesigning navigation?\n\n174\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.810\nNothing drives users more nuts than\nnot knowing where they are and\n\n175\n00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.800\nhow to get back to where they were.\n\n176\n00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.170\nSo, a bread crumb trail\nnear the top is useful.\n\n177\n00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.330\nTabs, quick launch options\non the left-hand side.\n\n178\n00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.650\nRemember, the implementation\nof what we're talking about\n\n179\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.340\nisn't necessarily that difficult.\n\n180\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.440\nBut someone has to decide\nwhat should occur.\n\n181\n00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.070\nHow do we want users to navigate?\n\n182\n00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.580\nWhat is their publishing strategy?\n\n183\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.250\nDo we have a multi-stage approval process?\n\n184\n00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.470\nCan content creators\nchose when to publish or\n\n185\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.730\ndo they always need an editor and\nan approver to sign off?\n\n186\n00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.610\nSomebody has to decide what the work\nflow's going to look like in\n\n187\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.419\nterms of publishing.\n\n188\n00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.000\nI'm gonna scroll over now, alright.\n\n189\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:54.280\nSo in terms of content information stored\nby users can IT manage that information?\n\n190\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.360\nIn other words maybe IT's not responsible\nfor backing up content in my sites.\n\n191\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.430\nSo users know that, hey, you're on\nyour own, you can use Scratchpad, but\n\n192\n00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.946\nserious business work should only be saved\nin document libraries which normally get\n\n193\n00:11:08.946 --> 00:11:09.597\nbacked up.\n\n194\n00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:14.570\nHow are we presenting data?\n\n195\n00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.790\nIs it some kind of visual display?\n\n196\n00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.170\nDo we pretty it up using apps?\n\n197\n00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:24.940\nAnd BI tools for example like Power BI,\nwhich we will look at in another episode.\n\n198\n00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.340\nMetadata, do we require\ntagging of content?\n\n199\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.050\nCan metadata happen automatically?\n\n200\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.440\nIn other words there's no field or\ndrop down menu for the user to select.\n\n201\n00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.230\nBut metadata gets automatically populated\nbased on say a field or in a form or\n\n202\n00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:49.610\nthe title of a document or the author or\nsome such metadata like that.\n\n203\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.490\nDo we have unique security needs for\nany of the content?\n\n204\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.060\nWhat about language specific\nversions of the content.\n\n205\n00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.700\nThis may not be a concern for\nyou if you're in a unilingual country but\n\n206\n00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.900\nif you're a multinational organization\nobviously you wanna have the content\n\n207\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.940\ntranslated or at least some of it for\nlocalization purposes.\n\n208\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:16.780\nOkay, permission structures for\nsites, who decides on that?\n\n209\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.538\nHow do I make sure that unauthorized\nusers aren't seeing content?\n\n210\n00:12:22.538 --> 00:12:27.310\nNow for the various document types you see\n\n211\n00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.510\nnear the lower right of the slide,\nlook at all these spokes.\n\n212\n00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:38.290\nLooks like some kind of artificial flower\ndesign, or a ceiling light or something.\n\n213\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:44.310\nSo, various rules could apply to different\ntypes of content that get created.\n\n214\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.230\nSo, we have different rules for videos\nversus blogs and wikis for example, or\n\n215\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.850\nexternal data.\n\n216\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.380\nNow, there's always a tradeoff.\n\n217\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:57.730\nLast thing I wanna show you on this\nsegment is prioritising content.\n\n218\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.600\nSo there's always a trade-off between\navailability, access and redundancy.\n\n219\n00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.710\nThat's what this little\ndial is showing here.\n\n220\n00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.110\nSo if we make something\n\n221\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.160\nmore highly available it's more\nlikely there's gonna be redundancy.\n\n222\n00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.170\nIn other words, duplicate copies\nof the data in the organization or\n\n223\n00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.810\nmaybe On Prem and in the Cloud.\n\n224\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.900\nAccess, the more people that have access\npresumably the less security there is\n\n225\n00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.760\nbecause more people can\naccess the content and\n\n226\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.120\ncan do things that maybe\nwe don't want them to.\n\n227\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.350\nSo there's always a trade off there.\n\n228\n00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.160\nThe next section to consider\nis application management and\n\n229\n00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.770\ncustom solutions.\n\n230\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.370\nSo I'll show you here.\n\n231\n00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.830\nAgain, this tends is near the middle.\n\n232\n00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.830\nIt's tends towards more strictly\nmanaged versus loosely managed.\n\n233\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.460\nThings like customizations,\ncustom app creation.\n\n234\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:51.090\nWho gets to, we're having a pilot or\ntest environment for customizations.\n\n235\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.490\nHow are they being packaged up?\n\n236\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.260\nIn a package?\n\n237\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.120\nIn a solution?\n\n238\n00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.070\nAs an app?\n\n239\n00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.780\nWho's gonna support the code?\n\n240\n00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.460\nIt's one thing to create the code.\n\n241\n00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.850\nBut the real work often begins after\nthe applications out in the wild in\n\n242\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.640\nthe organization.\n\n243\n00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.060\nThere's some feedback if you like,\nfrom users,\n\n244\n00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.510\nor maybe the app crashes,\nyou need ongoing support.\n\n245\n00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:16.760\nSo if it's something you've hired,\nmaybe you paid someone to design the app,\n\n246\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.030\nor they're no longer with the firm.\n\n247\n00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.030\nSomebody needs to be able to\nsupport that application.\n\n248\n00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.750\nIn terms of life cycle management for\ncustom solutions controlling source code,\n\n249\n00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.040\nsame with Visual Source Safe,\nsome kind of versioning there,\n\n250\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.590\nespecially with a multi dev environment.\n\n251\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.220\nAnd the ability to test solutions\nin a pre-production environment,\n\n252\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.910\nyou don't wanna test on your\nactual production users.\n\n253\n00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:45.206\nThere's really no excuse now, with\nthe inexpensive nature of virtualization,\n\n254\n00:14:45.206 --> 00:14:49.808\na lot of organizations have some sort\nof Hyper-V or VSX Server On Prem so\n\n255\n00:14:49.808 --> 00:14:53.873\nit's very easy to spin up and\ndestroy VMs on an as needed basis so\n\n256\n00:14:53.873 --> 00:14:56.969\nthere's no excuse not\nto test pre production.\n\n257\n00:14:56.969 --> 00:15:01.530\nBranding, what theme will be\napproved maybe enterprise wide?\n\n258\n00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.980\nMaybe divisions should have some\ncontrol over their branding.\n\n259\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.500\nAre you gonna use design manager or\nSharePoint Designer?\n\n260\n00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.210\nThat's another close choice as well.\n\n261\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.650\nAnd then solutions or apps for SharePoint?\n\n262\n00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.570\nSo do we want to bundle\nthe custom functionality\n\n263\n00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.890\nas a solution which we've been able to do?\n\n264\n00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.960\nOr now the more modern way is packaging\nthat functionality as an app?\n\n265\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.610\nWhen I say functionality, I mean that\ncan be some kind of video player.\n\n266\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.210\nIt could be a new button on the ribbon.\n\n267\n00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.460\nIt could be some custom list.\n\n268\n00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:38.160\nReally, any of the major elements of\nSharePoint you could customize or extend\n\n269\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.640\nthe functionality of, and then package it\nup in the form of a solution or an app.\n\n270\n00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.520\nAnd then who gets to deploy the solutions?\n\n271\n00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.080\nOr who decides when this\nsolution will be deployed.\n\n272\n00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.350\nThese are all governance issues.\n\n273\n00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.065\nLet's wrap up this section with\nsome best practices for governance.\n\n274\n00:15:54.065 --> 00:15:56.262\nSo like many things in SharePoint,\n\n275\n00:15:56.262 --> 00:16:00.731\npolicies should be reviewed periodically\nto evaluate against what your\n\n276\n00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:04.996\nexpectations were when you created\nthe policies in the first place.\n\n277\n00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:06.211\nOkay, so.\n\n278\n00:16:06.211 --> 00:16:11.564\nAgain, have an executive sponsor and\na strong governance committee.\n\n279\n00:16:11.564 --> 00:16:14.716\nYou don't wanna over complicate\nthe governance model,\n\n280\n00:16:14.716 --> 00:16:19.577\nyou don't wanna stifle people's innovation\nand make them have a multi-stage request\n\n281\n00:16:19.577 --> 00:16:22.810\nformat just to do something\nsimple like create a new site.\n\n282\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.445\nSo don't over design your\nSharePoint deployment.\n\n283\n00:16:30.445 --> 00:16:33.542\nMake sure that people that have\nvarious permissions know what their\n\n284\n00:16:33.542 --> 00:16:35.730\nresponsibilities are for\nthose permissions.\n\n285\n00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.620\nFor example,\nsite collection administrators.\n\n286\n00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.360\nMake sure they're trained,\nthey know what they're doing,\n\n287\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.629\nand they know the capabilities they have\nin terms of granting or denying access.\n\n288\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:51.402\nHow will you ensure your governance\nplan is being executed the way you want?\n\n289\n00:16:51.402 --> 00:16:56.428\nNow certain site collections, document\nlibraries, etc, might be more critical\n\n290\n00:16:56.428 --> 00:17:01.620\nto monitor from a governance perspective\nand operational perspective than others.\n\n291\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:07.002\nSo again, you prioritize the workload,\nwhat's critical, I mean an HR policy and\n\n292\n00:17:07.002 --> 00:17:08.670\nfinance, for example.\n\n293\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.265\nYou don't want the users with the ability\njust to search for salary information,\n\n294\n00:17:12.265 --> 00:17:12.902\nfor example.\n\n295\n00:17:12.902 --> 00:17:17.805\nWhereas, maybe old product information is\nnot such a security risk in terms of if\n\n296\n00:17:17.805 --> 00:17:20.050\nsomeone had inappropriate access.\n\n297\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.330\nSo in terms of your auditing time,\nyou wanna audit access, for example,\n\n298\n00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.540\nto the most sensitive parts of\nyour SharePoint deployment,\n\n299\n00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.359\nthe most sensitive data repositories.\n\n300\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.198\nOkay, so some common pitfalls you might\nencounter relating to governance.\n\n301\n00:17:36.162 --> 00:17:40.076\nNot defining policies into differentiating\npolicies that may be required,\n\n302\n00:17:40.076 --> 00:17:44.280\ndifferent policies for\ndifferent divisions, departments, teams.\n\n303\n00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.620\nIf you're a multinational conglomerate,\nfor example, and using SharePoint\n\n304\n00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.580\nthroughout, you're gonna have different\nentities in different countries,\n\n305\n00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.220\nin different industries, subject to\ndifferent compliance regulations.\n\n306\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.409\nAnd maybe more or\nless strict from a governance perspective.\n\n307\n00:17:59.409 --> 00:18:02.620\nNow you might give people, again,\npermissions to do certain things.\n\n308\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.780\nBut without training, it's like giving\nthem the keys to the Ferrari and\n\n309\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.980\nthey have their learner's license.\n\n310\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.724\nThe results are probably not gonna be good\nor they could be very expensive [LAUGH].\n\n311\n00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:15.569\n>> Yes [LAUGH].\n\n312\n00:18:15.569 --> 00:18:20.300\n>> Okay, now maybe it comes\ndown to educating users often,\n\n313\n00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.930\nas well, in terms of list items, so a user\nmight think I've got a product list here\n\n314\n00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:30.440\nwith 30,000 products available\nfrom widgets to window cleaners.\n\n315\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.110\nAnd they might think I'll just create one\ngiant list in SharePoint, so not realizing\n\n316\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.990\nthat there's realistic limits as to\nhow long any given list should be.\n\n317\n00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.050\nNot planning for scale and\ngrowth can be a gotcha as well,\n\n318\n00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.600\nso you might start small and\ndepartmentally.\n\n319\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.343\nAnd expand your SharePoint deployment, add\non more functionality that SharePoint has.\n\n320\n00:18:51.343 --> 00:18:58.570\nSearch, Record Center,\nDocument Center, custom workflows.\n\n321\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.260\nAnd over time your SharePoint deployment\nbecomes potentially unwieldy or\n\n322\n00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.380\nyou need to really start having\nseparate dedicated servers.\n\n323\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:12.270\nOr more than one server for search,\nfor caching, web front end,\n\n324\n00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.070\nsome kind of high availability on\nthe back end with SQL storage.\n\n325\n00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.890\nSo by failing to plan for\n\n326\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:22.908\nthe anticipated growth in your SharePoint\ndeployment, that could bite you.\n\n327\n00:19:22.908 --> 00:19:26.837\nAnd that is a governance issue,\nmaking sure you thought that through,\n\n328\n00:19:26.837 --> 00:19:31.027\nwhere do we expect our SharePoint\nenvironment to be at one year, two years,\n\n329\n00:19:31.027 --> 00:19:32.549\netc and planning for that.\n\n330\n00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:35.832\nWe talked about the importance\nof doing proper backups and\n\n331\n00:19:35.832 --> 00:19:39.120\ntesting recovery to make sure\nyour backups are adequate.\n\n332\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:45.550\nAnd again, this being overbearing\ncould be a problem as well in terms of\n\n333\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.360\nstifling any kind of creativity,\nor new ideas,\n\n334\n00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.020\nor new functionality in\nyour SharePoint deployment.\n\n335\n00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.870\nOkay, in terms of implementing governance,\nsite templates,\n\n336\n00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.710\nyou might wanna get some\ncustomizations there.\n\n337\n00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:06.360\nQuotas, workflows, deciding what features\nshould be enabled at different levels.\n\n338\n00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.430\nSo that's why you definitely need some\nIT expertise on a governance committee.\n\n339\n00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.060\nBecause we have features, for example,\nwe can enable at the farm level, web apps,\n\n340\n00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.310\nsite collections, site level.\n\n341\n00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.200\nShould we allow for\nself service site creation?\n\n342\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.250\nFor some organizations,\nthat opens up a can of worms,\n\n343\n00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.950\nthey don't wanna go there for others.\n\n344\n00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.630\nThat is one of the prime drivers\nof SharePoint, the ability for\n\n345\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:30.760\nusers to create their own sites, add some\ncontent, maybe modifying customized pages.\n\n346\n00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.883\nSite use confirmation and deletion,\n\n347\n00:20:33.883 --> 00:20:37.185\ndo you wanna just let the SharePoint\ninfrastructure grow wild?\n\n348\n00:20:37.185 --> 00:20:41.630\nOr do you wanna have some constraints on\nhow long a site collection can live for?\n\n349\n00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.350\nDo you want to enable My Sites?\n\n350\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.520\nSome organizations, yes, absolutely,\nother organizations, forget it,\n\n351\n00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.910\nwe're not doing My Sites.\n\n352\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.700\nOpens up a whole can of worms,\nwe don't wanna go there.\n\n353\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:02.460\nDocument management, versioning, content\napproval processes, these must be decided.\n\n354\n00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:09.800\nAuditing policies, blocked file types,\ndo you want to prevent, say, AVI type\n\n355\n00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.180\nfiles or video or audio content from being\nuploaded in your SharePoint environment?\n\n356\n00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.981\nOr on particular web applications, say,\nif you have a web app hosting My Sites.\n\n357\n00:21:18.981 --> 00:21:22.031\nDo you wanna prevent users\nuploading multimedia content,\n\n358\n00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:24.350\nwhich simply adds a lot\nto the storage space.\n\n359\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.480\nYou might have a concern there about\ncopyright infringement as well.\n\n360\n00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.580\nAgain, depending on your business,\nif you're making music or\n\n361\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.900\nvideos, obviously you don't wanna block\nthat kind of content from being uploaded.\n\n362\n00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.020\nAnywhere, probably, in your organization,\nMy Sites or otherwise.\n\n363\n00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:38.937\nAre you gonna allow for\n\n364\n00:21:38.937 --> 00:21:41.550\nsandbox solutions which have\nbeen deprecated in this version?\n\n365\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.867\nSo that's custom code that can run and\nis restricted in terms of\n\n366\n00:21:45.867 --> 00:21:50.352\nthe number of server resources it\ncan use in any 24 hour period.\n\n367\n00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:52.910\nAs measured by CPU, RAM, bandwidth and\n\n368\n00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.853\nother impacts on\nthe SharePoint deployment.\n\n369\n00:21:55.853 --> 00:21:59.215\nSo how are sandbox solutions\ngonna be governed,\n\n370\n00:21:59.215 --> 00:22:01.680\nare you going to allow them, even?\n\n371\n00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:06.060\nApps, are you gonna use\na catalogue on site,\n\n372\n00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.240\nare you gonna have apps in the cloud\nin some kind of hybrid environment?\n\n373\n00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.620\nShould users be able to create and\nadd their own apps, or\n\n374\n00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.240\nonly choose from an approved list?\n\n375\n00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.470\nSo these are some of the governance\nissues you should consider, and\n\n376\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.550\nI'm gonna pass it over to the one and\nonly, Mike Rodrick [LAUGH].\n\n377\n00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.400\n>> All right, we appreciate that Mark,\n\n378\n00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.560\nagain, a great look at governance and\nhow important it is.\n\n379\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:36.113\nAnd where it fits into our SharePoint\n2016 deployment and our infrastructure.\n\n380\n00:22:36.113 --> 00:22:39.490\nAnd you can see,\njust about everywhere, right?\n\n381\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.410\nA very important part,\nso we appreciate that,\n\n382\n00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.280\nMark, hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n383\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.870\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n384\n00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.650\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n385\n00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.820\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n386\n00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:55.677\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.073\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing our Advanced SharePoint 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:20.021\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:25.020\nwe're gonna be focusing in on\nsome of the hybrid features.\n\n6\n00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.558\nRight, we've looked at the couple\nof the different models way back in\n\n7\n00:00:27.558 --> 00:00:28.171\nthe beginning.\n\n8\n00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:31.853\nWe talked about the four different models,\n\n9\n00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:36.342\nwhether it's online, or\nAzure, or on-premises.\n\n10\n00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:39.759\nWe also talked about hybrid, where some\nenterprises are gonna have part of those\n\n11\n00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.990\nresources of the SharePoint deployment's\ngonna be out there in the cloud.\n\n12\n00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.560\nOther parts of it are gonna\nstill be on-premises.\n\n13\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.270\nHence the hybrid deployment, right?\n\n14\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.600\nAnd that's what we're\ngoing talk about today.\n\n15\n00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.310\nAnd here to do that with us is Mr.\nMark Ingram.\n\n16\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.874\nHow you doing Mark?\n\n17\n00:00:51.874 --> 00:00:53.360\n>> Good, Mike, thanks very much.\n\n18\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.240\nYeah, let's talk hybrid.\n\n19\n00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.130\nSo if we could get a shot of my screen,\nI'm in my Office 365 admin center.\n\n20\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.909\nAgain I'm gonna go down into\nSettings > Services & add ins.\n\n21\n00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.528\nSo we're gonna talk about a few\nthings in this kind of a mixed bag\n\n22\n00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:14.580\nhere this episode.\n\n23\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.790\nAnd wouldn't you know it,\nthey want me to authenticate.\n\n24\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.600\n>> Crazy.\n\n25\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.770\n>> I think I just did that,\nI'm doing it again.\n\n26\n00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.757\n>> Can never be too sure of who you are.\n\n27\n00:01:25.757 --> 00:01:28.875\n>> Well,\nhow much authentication do they need?\n\n28\n00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:30.251\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n29\n00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:31.825\nSettings > Services & add ins.\n\n30\n00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:38.222\nNow, I mentioned in a different episode,\n\n31\n00:01:38.222 --> 00:01:42.208\nwith Windows 10, Windows Updates,\n\n32\n00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:46.930\nthere's, and not just Windows updates now.\n\n33\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.070\nBut there is different tracks,\nif you like, for updates.\n\n34\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.160\nSome people want to be on the cutting\nedge and get the latest and greatest.\n\n35\n00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.118\nOthers, what they call now\na long-term servicing branch,\n\n36\n00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:58.920\nthey might only do Windows\nupdates once a year.\n\n37\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.610\nI'm talking about air traffic controls,\nhospitals.\n\n38\n00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.600\nYou don't want those organizations just,\nlet's experiment with this hot fix,\n\n39\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.872\nwhat can possibly [LAUGH] go wrong?\n\n40\n00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:08.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, bad.\n\n41\n00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.670\nSo there's different servicing rings for\nWindows Update.\n\n42\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.630\nSimilar kind of idea here\nwhen it comes to Office 365,\n\n43\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.900\nyou can get updates with a month delay or\na four month delay.\n\n44\n00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.360\nSo you can postpone some of the updates.\n\n45\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.340\nAgain, it's a little disruptive\nto some organizations.\n\n46\n00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.970\nThey might have just gotten used to\nwhatever the current O365 environment\n\n47\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.360\nis and SharePoint Online and\nthen there's more changes now.\n\n48\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.268\nSo you can be a little more aggressive or\n\n49\n00:02:34.268 --> 00:02:39.660\nwait a little longer to get some\nupdates in your Office 365 platform.\n\n50\n00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.675\nSo let's look at software\ndownload settings.\n\n51\n00:02:45.842 --> 00:02:48.030\nAnd here's that setting\nI was just referring to.\n\n52\n00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.930\nSo the current channel they call it,\nfor your Office 2016 apps every month.\n\n53\n00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.240\nYou could choose to go to the deferred\nchannel every four months.\n\n54\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.992\nSo it depends on the nature\nof your organization and\n\n55\n00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:02.788\nthe nature of your users as well.\n\n56\n00:03:02.788 --> 00:03:06.639\nSo I will cancel out of there and\n\n57\n00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.710\nlet's see now, let's talk OneDrive.\n\n58\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.780\nSo in my admin console for\nO365 is SharePoint\n\n59\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.120\nadmin center specifically and\nthe bottom there is configure hybrid.\n\n60\n00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.578\nSo Hybrid OneDrive, the settings\nyou can configure from O365 and\n\n61\n00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:29.610\nothers you can do on the client.\n\n62\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.084\nSo I click on Hybrid OneDrive, and\n\n63\n00:03:34.084 --> 00:03:37.330\nOneDrive for Business.\n\n64\n00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.200\nSo if I click Next then a little\napplication runs so it's very handy.\n\n65\n00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.386\nFor some of the tasks Microsoft's made it\nreally easy to configure from the user\n\n66\n00:03:45.386 --> 00:03:47.331\nperspective or admin perspective.\n\n67\n00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:49.042\nBecause there is a little\nwizard that runs,\n\n68\n00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:52.490\na little piece of software that runs and\ngives you some prescriptive guidance.\n\n69\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.095\nOther activities you may do in\nthe cloud actually take a lot longer,\n\n70\n00:03:57.095 --> 00:03:57.940\nthere's many, many steps.\n\n71\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.897\nThere's still some\nguidance along the way but\n\n72\n00:03:59.897 --> 00:04:02.061\nthere's more that you have\nto do kind of manually.\n\n73\n00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:06.220\nLike, for example, adding a UPN\nsuffix in your on-prem domain.\n\n74\n00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.170\nLet's see what happens when I click Next.\n\n75\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.289\nSo it'll take a few moments it says.\n\n76\n00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.053\nOkay, so\n\n77\n00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:19.685\nnow another heads up that hybrid picker\nwill initiate a setup assistance download.\n\n78\n00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:23.595\nLet's see what happens here,\nI see launching application.\n\n79\n00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.249\nWaiting to install.\n\n80\n00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.119\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay that worked,\n\n81\n00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:35.258\nnow I'm gonna show you\na different place where you\n\n82\n00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:38.790\ncan configure some Hybrid OneDrive and\nsite settings.\n\n83\n00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.337\nAnd if I go into Office 365\nfrom my central admin site,\n\n84\n00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:48.373\nover here is a port number\nwe've been using, app:5512.\n\n85\n00:04:48.373 --> 00:04:52.684\nAnd if I click down here,\nConfigure hybrid OneDrive and\n\n86\n00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:57.110\nSites features,\nhere's where I specify my My Site URL.\n\n87\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.234\nAnd I can click,\nalways good to try to link or\n\n88\n00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:04.802\nconfirm the username any time you\nget an opportunity to do that.\n\n89\n00:05:04.802 --> 00:05:08.850\nRather than forget what you did and\nhave to troubleshoot down the road.\n\n90\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.523\nSo it's, for some reason during this\nepisode I've had to authenticate\n\n91\n00:05:13.523 --> 00:05:15.885\n[LAUGH] numerous times already.\n\n92\n00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:17.209\n'Twas not always thus.\n\n93\n00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:18.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n94\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.930\nI'm not sure if that's a change of policy.\n\n95\n00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.440\nIt used to say, we recommend you close all\nyour tabs or your entire window of tabs,\n\n96\n00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.860\nbut it didn't make sure you did,\nbut now it really is.\n\n97\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.400\nSo that might be something new,\nI haven't seen it enough to know for sure.\n\n98\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.278\nOkay, so that worked.\n\n99\n00:05:35.278 --> 00:05:37.338\nThere's my Realtown Team Site so\n\n100\n00:05:37.338 --> 00:05:40.728\nI know that's the correct URL\nin the My Site URL field.\n\n101\n00:05:40.728 --> 00:05:44.608\nNow, just like rolling out\nany new functionality,\n\n102\n00:05:44.608 --> 00:05:49.030\nyou may not want everyone to\nexperience it at the same time.\n\n103\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.737\nFor one thing,\nyou might want some guinea pigs.\n\n104\n00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:54.058\nMaybe you have a test environment,\nsome things are not easy to use in\n\n105\n00:05:54.058 --> 00:05:58.160\na test environment so you just test in\nproduction with a small subset of users.\n\n106\n00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.124\nThis is one of those examples.\n\n107\n00:05:59.124 --> 00:06:02.446\nFor hybrid features you\ncan select an audience and\n\n108\n00:06:02.446 --> 00:06:06.160\nwe looked at audiences\nbefore in another episode.\n\n109\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.310\nWhere we can target content\nto specific audiences and\n\n110\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.860\nwe can define audiences based\non things like a metadata field.\n\n111\n00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.858\nSomething about them that's captured\nin SharePoint, in their profile,\n\n112\n00:06:17.858 --> 00:06:20.074\nor Active Directory profile for example.\n\n113\n00:06:20.074 --> 00:06:22.750\nSo we can get very specific\nabout how we target audiences.\n\n114\n00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.370\nMy point is, for this purpose,\nwe can target a specific audience for\n\n115\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.270\nhybrid features at first,\nget some lessons learned, best practices.\n\n116\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.868\nSee the impact, see how people\nare using the hybrid features.\n\n117\n00:06:33.868 --> 00:06:37.349\nAnd then we can come back here and\nselect the audience to be everyone for\n\n118\n00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:38.730\nhybrid features.\n\n119\n00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:46.460\nNow we may want to just enable OneDrive,\nor OneDrive and sites.\n\n120\n00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.550\nSo hybrid sites features we may\nwant to turn, or we can say none.\n\n121\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.070\nSo maybe we changed our mind or\nwe're just gonna go with the none option.\n\n122\n00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.970\nThere's also the hybrid picker and\n\n123\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.205\nthere's a little link there\nto learn more about that.\n\n124\n00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:07.595\nAnd for now I'm gonna show you\nthe client perspective on OneDrive,\n\n125\n00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:08.885\nhaving enabled that functionality.\n\n126\n00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:12.955\nSo I'm gonna switch over\nto a client machine,\n\n127\n00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:17.451\nand we see here a familiar interface.\n\n128\n00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:23.750\nAnd I'm gonna go down to my\nlittle hidden icons here.\n\n129\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.460\nAnd if you're wondering why there are two\ncloud icons, we can have both OneDrive and\n\n130\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.110\nOneDrive for Business installed\n[LAUGH] on the same machine.\n\n131\n00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.973\nAnd because of that, I can choose to sync\n\n132\n00:07:37.973 --> 00:07:42.695\ndifferent content with my OneDrive and\n\n133\n00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:46.710\nOneDrive for Business folders.\n\n134\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:54.076\nSo right now it shows OneDrive Personal\nand then OneDrive Railtown.\n\n135\n00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:59.626\nI can expand there and\ndrill down into that content.\n\n136\n00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:03.227\nAnd also that the,\nsee a green Oval with a white checkmark,\n\n137\n00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:07.810\nthat means the content has been synced,\nso that's handy.\n\n138\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:14.270\nAnd now I'm gonna go back to, now if I\ndelete it, let's see what happens here.\n\n139\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.463\nI'll jut delete ties and it's removed,\nthat's actually an Internet shortcut.\n\n140\n00:08:19.463 --> 00:08:21.679\nWhat happens if I\ndouble-click on food here?\n\n141\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.060\nOkay, so\nthat gets me into my OneNote online.\n\n142\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.770\nSimple plan.\n\n143\n00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.730\nWhen I had food on my mind when I\ncreated this, this is the OneNote here.\n\n144\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.990\nSo that's how I can get into\n\n145\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.810\nthat little lake that was referenced\nin my OneDrive folder on the client.\n\n146\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.920\nFor now, I'm going to go back to my app\nserver where the More action is happening\n\n147\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.720\nas we speak including for authentication.\n\n148\n00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.030\nIt's driving me nuts.\n\n149\n00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.530\nWhy me?\n\n150\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.400\nNow I've reauthenticated, for\nsome reason I had multiple tabs open, for\n\n151\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.910\nsome reason reauthenticating in one tab,\n\n152\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.170\nI mean it did warn me, I was supposed to\nclose down all the tabs in the session.\n\n153\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.360\nIn the past, I haven't had to do that,\nlooks like today I did.\n\n154\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.550\nAnd, check this out,\na brand new interface.\n\n155\n00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.100\nI swear its only been a few minutes\nsince you saw the last clip and\n\n156\n00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.640\nthis is a good example of\nthe interface changing.\n\n157\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.580\nSometimes daily.\n\n158\n00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.525\nI don't where the morning comes\nfrom because it's not morning.\n\n159\n00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:28.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I might have used a different time zone\n\n160\n00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.730\nwhere it is morning when I set this up.\n\n161\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.070\n>> For your address, yes.\n\n162\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.240\n>> Yeah, that's right,\nit's based on the address.\n\n163\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.379\nSo here's a link to install Office 2016,\nI'd be shocked if it actually worked.\n\n164\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.268\nBut giving the way things\nare going were just trying.\n\n165\n00:09:43.268 --> 00:09:44.440\nIt's a bandwidth hog.\n\n166\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.210\nSo that is how to install the software\nit doesn't like to install on\n\n167\n00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.410\nmachines running SharePoint as this\napp server VM is part of the reason I\n\n168\n00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.570\nhad a client added to the interface\nhere and installed office on the client\n\n169\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:05.320\nokay now some new apps to talk about.\n\n170\n00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.790\nLet's look at Power BI.\n\n171\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.040\nPretty cool, so\nwhy do these apps you might here about and\n\n172\n00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.010\nfind the link and then you might\nsign up with your Microsoft account.\n\n173\n00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.260\nAnd then discover, voila,\n\n174\n00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.890\nnow it's available in one place\nfrom your all 365 portal.\n\n175\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.996\nAnd Power Bi is no exception.\n\n176\n00:10:35.925 --> 00:10:41.113\nA really cool tool even if you're not\nfamiliar with graphically displaying\n\n177\n00:10:41.113 --> 00:10:45.895\nresults in In reports and the like so\nwhat's cool is you can import from\n\n178\n00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:50.837\nsome sample data into Power BI because\njust to start from zero it's tough\n\n179\n00:10:50.837 --> 00:10:55.699\nto get a sense of what the product does,\nbut once you've got some sample\n\n180\n00:10:55.699 --> 00:11:00.680\ndata you can see yeah, I can see how\nthat would relate to my situation.\n\n181\n00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.310\nHere's an example.\n\n182\n00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:08.380\nI'll ask a natural language query,\nlike variance.\n\n183\n00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.360\nNotice how there's some\nhelpful options that appear.\n\n184\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.110\nAnd here's a result here.\n\n185\n00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.680\nSo the idea is you might have\nseen some of these tools before.\n\n186\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.780\nNatural language careers.\n\n187\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.490\nWe don't have to format\nthe career in a technical way,\n\n188\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.110\nyou can enter things like sales\nlast year and see what comes up.\n\n189\n00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.950\nSo notice the various ways of displaying\ndata here and I have options,\n\n190\n00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.080\nlike what happens if I click\non focus mode, for example.\n\n191\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.370\nIt fills the screen with\nthat one data point.\n\n192\n00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.740\nThe upper left I can exit focus mode.\n\n193\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.950\nWhat else do I have here.\n\n194\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:47.590\nI have options here to look for related\ninsights with the little lightbulb.\n\n195\n00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.783\nAnd here's something on\nthe right-hand side.\n\n196\n00:11:52.783 --> 00:11:56.150\nSo, if you watch if you're a sports fan,\nsay, you watch them.\n\n197\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:00.960\nThere's all kinds of secure data coming\nup now about, you know, pitcher versus\n\n198\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.230\na batter, and some stats that nobody in\ntheir right mind could possibly remember.\n\n199\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.440\nOr IBM Watson,\nyou might've seen, you know,\n\n200\n00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.310\ndoing his funky analysis, making big data.\n\n201\n00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.610\nSo making sense of connections where\nyou wouldn't normally even think to\n\n202\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.870\nask those questions or\nmake the connection.\n\n203\n00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.050\nIt's doing it for you, so all these\nPower BI and a free tool you can use.\n\n204\n00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:29.120\nAnd again, various ways of\nvisually displaying the data\n\n205\n00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.460\nand I can delete a particular tile or\nedit tile details I can pin,\n\n206\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.420\nif I like a certain tile,\nI want it displayed I can pin it.\n\n207\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.710\nAnd I can also go to Export Data.\n\n208\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.490\nAnd open a CSV,\nlet's see what happens if I open Notepad.\n\n209\n00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:52.340\nSo Notepad, just some basics here about,\nyou can the title headers,\n\n210\n00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.440\nobviously it should be prettier in excel.\n\n211\n00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.620\nI don't have excel in this VM.\n\n212\n00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.040\nI wish I done it from my client, well.\n\n213\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.370\nPoint is, you can see various columns\nthere of data and then you could use\n\n214\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:08.120\nextra analysis in excel with PowerPivot\nfor example and some other great BI\n\n215\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.850\ntools built into Excel, not all of which\nare available from this old 365 interface.\n\n216\n00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.990\nSo you're gonna keep wanting to use\na combination of tools when it comes\n\n217\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.370\nto Power BI.\n\n218\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.980\nNow, let's look at something else\nthat's pretty cool, Power apps.\n\n219\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.230\nI signed up for a beta for this months\nago or to be on a list to be invited.\n\n220\n00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.830\nNow I'm on it and\nI thought I'd just throw it on here.\n\n221\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.960\nJust for the heck of it.\n\n222\n00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.280\nAgain, some sample apps.\n\n223\n00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.760\nThe idea is that it makes it easy for\nthe average user to create apps.\n\n224\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.520\nFor example here's a Budget Tracker.\n\n225\n00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.060\nWow.\nSo I Open for tablet.\n\n226\n00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.410\nP is for PowerApps,\nnot Publisher or PowerPoint.\n\n227\n00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.770\nOkay, Budget Tracker doesn't work in a\nbrowser, well that's Not very helpful for\n\n228\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:55.780\nthis demo is it?\n\n229\n00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.531\nBut if.\n\n230\n00:13:56.531 --> 00:13:57.673\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Tablet.\n\n231\n00:13:57.673 --> 00:14:00.559\nLet's see it looks like\nmaybe it's trying to work.\n\n232\n00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:01.940\n>> Maybe.\n\n233\n00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.380\n>> Let's see what happens.\n\n234\n00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.100\nPlace your bets.\n\n235\n00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.594\nWe're gonna gong it.\n\n236\n00:14:08.594 --> 00:14:12.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay so another thing related to power\n\n237\n00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:18.850\napps is flows, and\nI can start showing flows through an app.\n\n238\n00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:23.455\nOkay, so this is kinda cool, a way to\ncreate automatic automated work flows.\n\n239\n00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:28.885\nSo you might have set up Outlook\nrules to manage the deluge of emails.\n\n240\n00:14:28.885 --> 00:14:31.825\nNowadays maybe emails just\none part of the deluge and\n\n241\n00:14:31.825 --> 00:14:37.495\nyou've got other flows of information to\nmanage, various streams, maybe LinkedIn or\n\n242\n00:14:37.495 --> 00:14:40.960\nnewsfeeds that you follow specific\nto your industry, for example.\n\n243\n00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.560\nAnd so let's look at flows.\n\n244\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.200\nI can click on browse templates and\nthis is not an exhaustive list,\n\n245\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.780\nit just gives you an idea of a flow\nthat you might want to create.\n\n246\n00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.190\nSo for example, share my email attachments\nto a SharePoint document library.\n\n247\n00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.770\nYour exchange Admin will\ncertainly love you,\n\n248\n00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.250\nunless of course your exchange\nAdmin in also your share Admin.\n\n249\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.910\nThe last thing we want\nto do is have email,\n\n250\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.350\npeople sometimes have\na multi-gigabyte Outlook profile,\n\n251\n00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.000\nbecause it is low to save\ntheir attachments anywhere.\n\n252\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.410\n>> Right.\n>> Saving attachments to a document\n\n253\n00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.440\nlibrary in SharePoint\nis a pretty good idea.\n\n254\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.640\nThen you can delete\nthe attachment from email.\n\n255\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.330\nIn fact, you could simply email the\ndocument library with the attachment and\n\n256\n00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.460\nit would automatically.\n\n257\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.330\nThe attachment would populate\nin that document library.\n\n258\n00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.220\nHere's one kind of cool.\n\n259\n00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.991\nGet a text message, or\n\n260\n00:15:27.991 --> 00:15:33.100\ntext notification when you receive\nan email from your manager.\n\n261\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.284\nCopy new files in Drop Box to\na specific folder in OneDrive.\n\n262\n00:15:37.284 --> 00:15:42.050\n[LAUGH] So now we're talking about\nduplicating content in cloud storage which\n\n263\n00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.670\nmay or may not make sense.\n\n264\n00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:50.730\nYou can post to Yammer if\nnew tweets match a hashtag.\n\n265\n00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:56.559\nSo the point is it's automating routine\ntasks that don't take a lot of skill but\n\n266\n00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.823\nmight waste a lot of your time.\n\n267\n00:15:58.823 --> 00:16:01.878\nPush to notification if you\nget an email from your boss,\n\n268\n00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.698\neven integrating with Slack, so\n\n269\n00:16:03.698 --> 00:16:07.796\nyou can see variety of Cloud services\nare playing nicely with SharePoint.\n\n270\n00:16:07.796 --> 00:16:12.339\nThere's no point for Microsoft to\nisolate themselves, you have to be\n\n271\n00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:17.630\ninteracting with other Cloud services\nto make this more useful product.\n\n272\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:24.400\nSimilarly doing things with Twitter tweets\nand Facebook posts, so you get the idea.\n\n273\n00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.050\nThis is all you can do with Flow,\n\n274\n00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:32.580\nwhich is another tool in your toolkit\nyou can make available from Office 365.\n\n275\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.487\nAll right, now Sway we looked\nat in a different episode.\n\n276\n00:16:40.602 --> 00:16:44.227\nI do wanna show a couple of other things.\n\n277\n00:16:44.227 --> 00:16:48.349\nSo in my O 365 link, in Central Admin now,\n\n278\n00:16:48.349 --> 00:16:53.490\none more thing to talk about\nis configuring Yammer.\n\n279\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.580\nSo that would be a governance decision\nwhether or not to activate it.\n\n280\n00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.530\nFor some organizations it's a bit\nconfusing having a social network\n\n281\n00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.700\nwithin a social network that's\ncontained within SharePoint.\n\n282\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.187\nBut if you wanna go that way, Microsoft\ndid shell out a lot of money to acquire\n\n283\n00:17:05.187 --> 00:17:09.024\nit, for a reason presumably, and not just\nto neutralize a potential competitor.\n\n284\n00:17:09.024 --> 00:17:10.688\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or maybe it was.\n\n285\n00:17:10.688 --> 00:17:11.397\n>> Or maybe it was.\n\n286\n00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:13.583\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Anyway,\n\n287\n00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:18.930\nwe're gonna click on activate Yammer\nthere, and that worked there.\n\n288\n00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.530\nAnd our next options there\nin terms of Yammer is to\n\n289\n00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.370\nlearn more about customer engagement, and\n\n290\n00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.750\nthat takes you to a sign-up page where\nyou can choose to connect your company.\n\n291\n00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.890\nSign up for free and a little pitch there.\n\n292\n00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.340\nAnd as you expect it\nworks nicely with Office,\n\n293\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.960\nbeing a Microsoft product that's\nacquired several years ago.\n\n294\n00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.710\nOften there are many issues right after\na technology's acquired but a version or\n\n295\n00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.210\ntwo later, it's good to go.\n\n296\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:51.590\nAnd then governance is something we talked\nabout in a couple of other episodes.\n\n297\n00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:57.260\nSo there is governance related\nconversation if you like comparing\n\n298\n00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:03.130\nYammer and\nthe built-in SharePoint Newsfeed.\n\n299\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.680\nSo that will help you decide whether it's\nsomething you wanna deploy at this point\n\n300\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.370\nin your organization.\n\n301\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:13.220\nOkay, so\nonboarding is always the concern or\n\n302\n00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.430\nchanging to a new technology,\nso Microsoft, especially for\n\n303\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:23.495\na medium to large companies has made it as\neasy as they can to FastTrack to get you\n\n304\n00:18:23.495 --> 00:18:29.245\nutilizing the O365 environment,\nincluding things like\n\n305\n00:18:29.245 --> 00:18:34.305\nrunning OneDrive for Business,\nFile Migration Services.\n\n306\n00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:37.785\nSo if you're buying 150 seats or\n\n307\n00:18:37.785 --> 00:18:40.825\nmore, that's the current threshold,\nit wasn't always that way.\n\n308\n00:18:40.825 --> 00:18:45.530\n150 seats or\nmore of an eligible O365 plan,\n\n309\n00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:51.190\nwe looked at a whole bunch of plans, at\nleast looked at the right range of plans,\n\n310\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:56.160\nE3, E5 in the other episode, then\nyou're eligible for migration services.\n\n311\n00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:02.180\nAnd there's various scenarios there with\ndifferent components from envisioning,\n\n312\n00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.110\nonboarding, driving value,\nso getting people engaged\n\n313\n00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.590\nin the O 365 deployment, and\nthen management of O 365.\n\n314\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.430\nSo the place to start is\nNew to FastTrack?, here.\n\n315\n00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.045\nWe'll be eligible for\nsome support from Microsoft as well, so\n\n316\n00:19:22.045 --> 00:19:26.765\nyou're not left navigating this thing\nyou might only do once, ever, alone.\n\n317\n00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:30.615\nSo Microsoft has a dedicated team of\npeople that have worked with a lot of\n\n318\n00:19:30.615 --> 00:19:36.435\ncustomer engagement, so they will know\nthe common pit falls you might encounter.\n\n319\n00:19:36.435 --> 00:19:39.015\nYou can that way take advantage\nof their expertise, and\n\n320\n00:19:39.015 --> 00:19:40.905\nhave them help guide you through.\n\n321\n00:19:40.905 --> 00:19:47.440\nSo there's partners around the world and\nagain, you could buy this support.\n\n322\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:54.975\nAll right, so customer engagement,\nhere are the steps involved.\n\n323\n00:19:54.975 --> 00:19:59.515\nWith onboarding and assessing your\ncurrent environment and some issues that\n\n324\n00:19:59.515 --> 00:20:02.885\nmight occur that would prevent\na successful deployment to the Cloud.\n\n325\n00:20:02.885 --> 00:20:07.485\nSo you want to resolve those on-premise,\nwhich might be with certain fields or\n\n326\n00:20:07.485 --> 00:20:09.835\nkind of debris lingering\nin your active directory.\n\n327\n00:20:09.835 --> 00:20:14.300\nThis can happen if you've had a merged\nentity or you've acquired some firms.\n\n328\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.410\nAnd, or maybe the other company was\nusing a different directory service and\n\n329\n00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.750\nyou've kind of bolted of them together\nwith Novel or some other service.\n\n330\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.780\nAnd so there's some debris, as I like to\ncall it, remaining in that directory.\n\n331\n00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.161\nThese kinds of things could prevent\na successful move to an O 365 environment.\n\n332\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.775\nSo that's,\nI'm not saying that it's easy, but\n\n333\n00:20:36.775 --> 00:20:41.920\nat least there's prescriptive guidance and\nsupport available along the way.\n\n334\n00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.790\n>> All right Mark, great look at how\nwe can set up hybrid features for\n\n335\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.720\nour SharePoint deployment.\n\n336\n00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.050\nWe thank you for that, we hope\neverybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n337\n00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.620\nSigning off ITPRO.TV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n338\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.350\n>> I'm Mark Ingram.\n\n339\n00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.217\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n340\n00:20:56.217 -->
