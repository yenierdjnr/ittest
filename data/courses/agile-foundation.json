taking a look\nat a very important question, and\n\n9\n00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:22.834\nthat is, well, what is Agile?\n\n10\n00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:24.394\nAnd of course, we have Mrs.\n\n11\n00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:27.580\nJo Peacock in studios today\nto help answer that question.\n\n12\n00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.040\nHow are you doing today, Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.660\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely fine,\nthank you, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.340\nHow are you?\n\n15\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.970\n&gt;&gt; I''m doing great.\n\n16\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.910\nI'm super excited to be\nin studios with you.\n\n17\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.560\nIt's been a while since\nI've seen you last.\n\n18\n00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.490\n&gt;&gt; It has.\n&gt;&gt; Since the show started.\n\n19\n00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.388\nBrand new series,\nreally cool topic, Agile.\n\n20\n00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:43.416\nI do have some background\nin project management, but\n\n21\n00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:47.895\nI'm really hoping that you can expand\nthat, and show me the Agile way of life.\n\n22\n00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:52.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, okay, well in Agile\nwe like to do things on an incremental\n\n23\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.070\nbasis and we like sort of short\ndeliveries and quick deliveries as well.\n\n24\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.130\nSo we're gonna try and deliver this\nparticular class in an Agile way.\n\n25\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.200\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.530\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what we do here.\n\n27\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.445\n&gt;&gt; So where are we gonna start?\n\n28\n00:01:05.445 --> 00:01:09.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're gonna start with just\nreally understanding a little bit about\n\n29\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.195\nAgile, where Agile came from.\n\n30\n00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:13.830\n&gt;&gt; And a bit of a history lesson?\n\n31\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.980\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nthat's exactly what it's going to be.\n\n32\n00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.480\nAnd certainly if you're studying for\nyour Agile Foundation Certification,\n\n33\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.930\nthen you will need to have this\nlittle bit of a history lesson.\n\n34\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.590\nSo yeah, we're gonna take\nyou back in time, Cherokee,\n\n35\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.650\nand it's gonna be back in time by quite\na long way as well, about 18 years now.\n\n36\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.618\nSo we're gonna just take a brief look at\nwhere Agile came from and then we're gonna\n\n37\n00:01:36.618 --> 00:01:40.938\nmove into the concept of just what Agile\nis and why is it so different from\n\n38\n00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:45.783\nthe traditional waterfall approaches\nthat you mentioned earlier on, right?\n\n39\n00:01:45.783 --> 00:01:47.745\nTake a look at this slide\nin front of you now.\n\n40\n00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:51.695\nYou'll see that actually\nAgile's been around since 2001.\n\n41\n00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.395\nAnd prior to 2001,\n\n42\n00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:57.715\nwe had sort of the traditional waterfall\napproaches to project management.\n\n43\n00:01:57.715 --> 00:02:00.805\nBut you see, the problem was as far\nas the organization is concerned,\n\n44\n00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:02.494\nas far as the business is concerned,\n\n45\n00:02:02.494 --> 00:02:07.180\ntraditional waterfall approaches didn't\ndeliver anything quick enough for them.\n\n46\n00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.160\nYou know what it's like.\n\n47\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.520\nWe're in the 21st century now, and\nwhen somebody wants a solution or\n\n48\n00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.180\nthey want an answer to a problem that they\nhave, they generally want it yesterday.\n\n49\n00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.100\nThe other thing that happens is\nthat in a day to day environment,\n\n50\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.990\nyou'll find that I mean, let's face it,\nproducts are updated on a frequent basis.\n\n51\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.200\nHow often do you get\nyourself a new cellphone?\n\n52\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.920\n&gt;&gt; I know, right, and actually,\nI find it odd that that word there,\n\n53\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.655\nevolve is pretty significant.\n\n54\n00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:38.671\nOr I guess it's just ironic in this\nsituation, because even looking at I see\n\n55\n00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:41.639\nit's stemming from software\ndevelopment practices.\n\n56\n00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.595\nAnd I don't know if you work in any\ncapacity dealing with software development\n\n57\n00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:47.740\nor for a company.\n\n58\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.640\nHere at ITProTV, we certainly do,\nand the project that you\n\n59\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.170\nmight start on may look a little bit\ndifferent by the time you finish,\n\n60\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.660\nwhich in the past, when you talk\nabout traditional project management,\n\n61\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.870\nyou stick and\nadhere to that scope really tightly.\n\n62\n00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.890\nBut that's not the case here,\nis it, so much, Jo?\n\n63\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.770\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n64\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.450\nAnd the other thing about,\nyou mention sticking to the scope,\n\n65\n00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.620\nbut how long does\na traditional project take?\n\n66\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.060\nIt can take six months,\nmaybe if it's a very small project.\n\n67\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.570\nIt could take two years.\n\n68\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.390\nAnd what happens is that the customer,\nthe business or whoever it is that's\n\n69\n00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.670\nasking for that deliverable,\nhas asked for it probably six months ago.\n\n70\n00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.590\nThey defined the scope, and then as you\nsaid, that scope is then cast in stone.\n\n71\n00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.930\nBut then they hear nothing.\n\n72\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.220\nAnd maybe there is a little bit of\ncommunication throughout the project, but\n\n73\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.770\nthey hear nothing for two years.\n\n74\n00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.470\nAnd then two years later all of a sudden\nthis new product has been delivered.\n\n75\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.950\nThe problem with that is that by\nthe time it's delivered sometimes,\n\n76\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.710\nin a traditional waterfall approach,\n\n77\n00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.250\nby the time that's delivered it's out\nof date and things have moved on.\n\n78\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.310\nAnd so way back in 2001, as it says\non the screen in front of you right\n\n79\n00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.750\nnow, software developers and\n\n80\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.340\nthe project management sort of\ngurus at the time got together and\n\n81\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.340\nthey created a manifesto for\nAgile software development.\n\n82\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.530\nAnd we're gonna look at\nthat in another episode.\n\n83\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.530\nBut basically they acknowledged that\ntraditional waterfall approaches,\n\n84\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.440\nwhilst they had their place,\nthey weren't particularly, well, agile.\n\n85\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.050\nIn other words, they couldn't be changed.\n\n86\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.080\nAnd so what happened was they\nwere subject to scope creep.\n\n87\n00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.550\nAnd in these traditional waterfall\napproaches, you're finding that\n\n88\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.170\nthe scope was cast in stone but\nthen people wanted to make changes.\n\n89\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.640\nAnd there was no defined way,\nshould I say,\n\n90\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.870\nof incorporating those changes into\nthe project without a big upheaval.\n\n91\n00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.917\nSo Agile was born, and\nthe Agile manifesto was created,\n\n92\n00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.191\nas we said there, back in 2001.\n\n93\n00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:57.645\nAnd it was by industry experts.\n\n94\n00:04:57.645 --> 00:05:01.250\nThe idea of Agile is that we focus,\nthat bottom bullet point,\n\n95\n00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.835\nfocuses on delivery through evolution and\niteration of requirements.\n\n96\n00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:08.285\nAnd it's about adaptive planning.\n\n97\n00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:11.970\nIt's about acknowledging\nthat things change.\n\n98\n00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.500\nAnd in a project environment we\ncannot afford to be too rigid.\n\n99\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.990\nWhat we're here to do\nas a service provider,\n\n100\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.660\nas a business unit within an organization,\nis to deliver value.\n\n101\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.350\nThat's what we're here to do.\n\n102\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.370\nAnd let's be honest about this.\n\n103\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.360\nIf your organization doesn't perceive\nvalue in anything that you do,\n\n104\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.670\nthey're gonna find somebody else to do it.\n\n105\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.500\nAnd this is what was happening is that\na lot of organizations way back then and\n\n106\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.790\neven now were outsourcing a lot of\ntheir development purely because\n\n107\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.950\ndevelopment teams that were adopting\nwaterfall approaches were seen to be\n\n108\n00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.080\ntoo cumbersome, too bureaucratic.\n\n109\n00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.890\nAnd so we needed something.\n\n110\n00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.450\nAnd we needed something that was going\nto allow us to respond to the needs of\n\n111\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.350\nthe organization.\n\n112\n00:06:00.382 --> 00:06:04.610\nWhat you've got to understand is\nthat Agile is not a single approach.\n\n113\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.590\nIn fact, there are lots of\nmethodologies within Agile and\n\n114\n00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.470\nwe're going to look at\nthose in the next slide.\n\n115\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.770\nBut we're going to go a little bit more\nin-depth into each one of those as we move\n\n116\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.640\nthrough next episodes.\n\n117\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.500\nAgile is not a single approach.\n\n118\n00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.340\nAgile is more of a mindset.\n\n119\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.250\nIt's a way of introducing\na project in a iterative way.\n\n120\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.350\nIt's a group of methodologies\nthat encompasses many.\n\n121\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.240\nBut it's all about having a pragmatic\nmindset and it says there,\n\n122\n00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.600\na flexible approach, pragmatic, realistic.\n\n123\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.840\nRealistically acknowledging\nthat things are gonna change.\n\n124\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.630\nAnd not trying to cast everything in stone\nand say this is the way it's going to be\n\n125\n00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.465\nright at the very start of a project, and\nthey're carrying on down that road without\n\n126\n00:06:51.465 --> 00:06:56.505\neven acknowledging that the path that\nyou've chosen might need to change.\n\n127\n00:06:56.505 --> 00:06:59.355\nBut without even acknowledging\nthat actually what we want to\n\n128\n00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:01.575\nachieve is completely different.\n\n129\n00:07:01.575 --> 00:07:03.900\nYou see, the business changes.\n\n130\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.110\nAnd in a traditional waterfall project, it\ndoesn't really allow for too much change.\n\n131\n00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.443\nAnd if the business changes,\n\n132\n00:07:10.443 --> 00:07:13.919\nthen surely we've got to change to be\naligned with the needs of the business.\n\n133\n00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:14.970\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n134\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.510\n&gt;&gt; And the other problem that we've\ngot is that technology changes,\n\n135\n00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.010\ntoo, and it's not just the business but\nour suppliers change on a regular basis.\n\n136\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.630\nAnd when I say they change, what I mean\nis they change what they supply us with.\n\n137\n00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.312\nHow often do you update the operating\nsystem on your cell phone?\n\n138\n00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:32.345\n&gt;&gt; On my cell phone?\n\n139\n00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:34.258\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Quite often I can update.\n\n140\n00:07:34.258 --> 00:07:34.866\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n141\n00:07:34.866 --> 00:07:36.730\n&gt;&gt; I mean, I don't have to manually do it.\n\n142\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.630\nI get a notification,\nit's time to update and we're good to go.\n\n143\n00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.560\n&gt;&gt; So let's imagine then if you were using\na traditional waterfall approach, and\n\n144\n00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.590\nyou were creating an app for a cell phone.\n\n145\n00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n146\n00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.970\n&gt;&gt; So we'd start off with, and I'm just\ngonna use something that's familiar to me,\n\n147\n00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.520\nwe start off with iOS.\n\n148\n00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.461\nI don't know,\nlet's say we start off with iOS7.\n\n149\n00:07:57.461 --> 00:07:58.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n150\n00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.080\n&gt;&gt; And we start to design\nour new app based on iOS7.\n\n151\n00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.966\nWhat do we do when iOS8 comes along then?\n\n152\n00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:09.310\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna have to go\nback to the drawing board.\n\n153\n00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.730\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\nhow much time have we wasted?\n\n154\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:16.540\n&gt;&gt; Well, from the beginning of my project\nto that time that that update came out.\n\n155\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.150\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nthen we go back to the drawing board and\n\n156\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.280\nwe start to do all of\nthe design work again.\n\n157\n00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.384\nAnd we might even be halfway through\ndevelopment when iOS 9 comes out.\n\n158\n00:08:27.384 --> 00:08:28.510\nAnd then we're back again.\n\n159\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.572\n&gt;&gt; I see your point, Jo.\n\n160\n00:08:29.572 --> 00:08:32.244\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so we're not saying that\n\n161\n00:08:32.244 --> 00:08:35.880\nthe traditional waterfall approach\nto project management doesn't work.\n\n162\n00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.690\nWe're not saying that at all.\n\n163\n00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.620\nWhat we're saying is that there\nare times when it doesn't work, and\n\n164\n00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.890\nthere are times when\nclearly it doesn't work.\n\n165\n00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:48.790\nAnd the thing is, that your business and\nyour users, they expect rapid change.\n\n166\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.740\nThey expect rapid development.\n\n167\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.710\nThat's what they get in a day-to-day\nenvironment with their cell phones,\n\n168\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.300\nwith their operating systems on their\nlaptops, they get rapid development.\n\n169\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.860\n&gt;&gt; So we're able to meet those versions.\n\n170\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.360\nWhenever that versioning starts to roll\nout, we're able to approach it and\n\n171\n00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.353\nhandle it properly.\n\n172\n00:09:07.353 --> 00:09:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's exactly what Agile is about.\n\n173\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.690\nAgile is about accepting that we're\ngoing to do development in increments,\n\n174\n00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.600\nand that with each increment\nwe build on the last.\n\n175\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.970\nAnd with each increment we make progress,\nbut\n\n176\n00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.310\nwe're not trying to do\neverything all at once.\n\n177\n00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n178\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.450\n&gt;&gt; That's what Agile's about, and\nthat's where the pragmatic bit comes in,\n\n179\n00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.530\nis the fact that acknowledging that\nyou don't wanna start off right from\n\n180\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.980\nthe very beginning, go back to the drawing\nboard every time there's been a change.\n\n181\n00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.431\nAnd there are so\nmany influences to changing a project.\n\n182\n00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:44.615\n&gt;&gt; Right, customer needs, it doesn't\njust have to focus around updates or\n\n183\n00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:47.970\nenvironment changes, but\na lot of external factors.\n\n184\n00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we can't influence them.\n\n185\n00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.470\nAnd that again is down to\nthat pragmatic approach.\n\n186\n00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.653\nWe can't influence those external factors,\nbecause we can turn onto the business and\n\n187\n00:09:56.653 --> 00:09:59.760\nsay no, you're gonna stick with\nthis iOS and what will happen?\n\n188\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.273\nThey'll be-\n&gt;&gt; The competitor is like no,\n\n189\n00:10:01.273 --> 00:10:02.880\nI'm already two steps ahead of you.\n\n190\n00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.190\nSo we're gonna go ahead\nwith the competitor then.\n\n191\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.950\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the business is gonna go\nsomewhere else and yeah, we've lost out.\n\n192\n00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.450\nAnd the next thing you know,\nwe're kind of, well,\n\n193\n00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.070\nI was gonna use the word redundant,\nbut that's a British word.\n\n194\n00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.930\nWe're kind of surplus to requirements now,\nokay?\n\n195\n00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.430\nSo the other thing about Agile is,\nwe mentioned the word pragmatic, and\n\n196\n00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.660\nwe've been talking about that.\n\n197\n00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.310\nThe word flexible, again, allowing for\nchange, that's what Agile is about,\n\n198\n00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.050\nit's allowing for change.\n\n199\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:34.820\n&gt;&gt; So we've got quite a few methodologies\nthat we actually consider to be Agile.\n\n200\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:40.280\nSo we've got Scrum, you've got XP,\nyou've got Lean, you've got Kanban.\n\n201\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.030\nWe're going to look at\nthose in more detail\n\n202\n00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.100\na little bit later in other episodes.\n\n203\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.170\nWe're just gonna be taking a quick look,\nvery,\n\n204\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.650\nvery high level to those\nparticular methodologies.\n\n205\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.140\nSo Agile is not actually\na methodology in its own right,\n\n206\n00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.360\nit's about a mindset, and it's about\nthe way that we approach projects.\n\n207\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.745\nAnd there are, we said that,\n\n208\n00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.880\nlots of methodologies that will\napproach projects in that way.\n\n209\n00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.290\nSo let's just take another look at\nthose two words that we just spent\n\n210\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.150\na bit of time talking about there,\nCherokee.\n\n211\n00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:17.841\nThis pragmatic mindset also takes\ninto consideration the fact that,\n\n212\n00:11:17.841 --> 00:11:19.100\nyou know what?\n\n213\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.360\nWe don't know everything right now and\nwe don't know the future, and\n\n214\n00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.370\nI hate to get into cliches.\n\n215\n00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.880\nBut the only thing that you know about the\nfuture is that the future's gonna change.\n\n216\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.020\nYeah, I know that's a cliche and I hate\nto get into those, but it's so true.\n\n217\n00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.060\nAnd we don't know what\nour suppliers are doing.\n\n218\n00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.830\nWe don't know what our\ncustomers are doing.\n\n219\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.100\nWe don't know what our\ncustomers are learning.\n\n220\n00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.445\nHow many people are actually\nwatching this right now,\n\n221\n00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:46.563\nnot because they've been told to, but\n\n222\n00:11:46.563 --> 00:11:52.152\nbecause they actually want to do\nsome personal development, right?\n\n223\n00:11:52.152 --> 00:11:53.648\n&gt;&gt; I know I've, yeah, guilty.\n\n224\n00:11:53.648 --> 00:11:56.467\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there's nothing to feel guilty\n\n225\n00:11:56.467 --> 00:11:57.121\nabout.\n\n226\n00:11:57.121 --> 00:11:58.026\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n227\n00:11:58.026 --> 00:12:01.840\n&gt;&gt; And so every time you learn\nsomething new, you want to apply it.\n\n228\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.761\nAnd it's the same with people\nin our business as well.\n\n229\n00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:10.495\nEvery time our customer learns something\nnew or they're exposed to something new,\n\n230\n00:12:10.495 --> 00:12:12.530\nthey want to apply it.\n\n231\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:17.970\nNow I don't know about you, but I'm a bit\nof a demon when it comes to new gadgets.\n\n232\n00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.270\nSo I've got to have the latest shiny toy.\n\n233\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you like to try things out.\n\n234\n00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.758\nI've seen some of your toys.\n\n235\n00:12:22.758 --> 00:12:23.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n236\n00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.180\nI've gotta have the latest shiny toy.\n\n237\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:32.090\nBut every time I see something on TV,\nit's advertised, I have to have that.\n\n238\n00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.050\nI need it in my life.\n\n239\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.870\nAnd this is the problem with our business.\n\n240\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.630\nI'm not the only one, by the way.\n\n241\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:43.470\nI am not unique, and manufacturers and\ndevelopers will understand that.\n\n242\n00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:45.915\nAnd we need to be ahead of the game.\n\n243\n00:12:45.915 --> 00:12:48.525\nAs developers ourselves,\nwe need to be ahead of the game.\n\n244\n00:12:48.525 --> 00:12:53.941\nWe need to be driving that need\nrather than responding to our need.\n\n245\n00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:57.015\nThat's a bullet point talks about\nthings changing with little warning.\n\n246\n00:12:57.015 --> 00:13:03.240\nIf we allow that change\nthen to influence us, then\n\n247\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.530\nwe're responding to the business need, and\nthat's exactly what we should be doing.\n\n248\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.250\nIf we bury our head in the sand,\n\n249\n00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.060\nwhich can be what happens with the\ntraditional waterfall approach, if we bury\n\n250\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.570\nour head in the sand, then we're not\nresponding to the business needs at all.\n\n251\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.120\nWe're giving the business\nwhat we want to give them.\n\n252\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.808\nAnd giving them what we wanna give\nthem is not gonna keep them happy.\n\n253\n00:13:23.808 --> 00:13:30.575\nAnd that last bullet point talks\nabout predicting for the future.\n\n254\n00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:35.532\nHow much time is spent, how much time\nis wasted planning for something in\n\n255\n00:13:35.532 --> 00:13:41.530\na year's time when the environment is\ngonna change completely in six months?\n\n256\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.470\nLet's be honest, and\nit's part of being pragmatic here.\n\n257\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.580\nYour organization doesn't come to you and\n\n258\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.190\nask permission to, say,\nmerge with another organization, or\n\n259\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.050\nto make an acquisition or maybe to\nsell off part of the organization.\n\n260\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.550\nThey don't come to us in IT and\nask for our permission to do that.\n\n261\n00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.905\nAnd quite often we don't-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n262\n00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:03.625\nas much as I'd like to think that\nthey have to, that's just not.\n\n263\n00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:05.086\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, I mean,\n\n264\n00:14:05.086 --> 00:14:08.530\nwe don't even get to influence\nthat decision a lot of the time.\n\n265\n00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.192\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of the time it's told to us,\n\n266\n00:14:11.192 --> 00:14:13.960\nthat's what's going to happen.\n\n267\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.100\nSo we have to be able\nto respond to change.\n\n268\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.800\nAnd if we don't, yet again,\nthe organization's gonna go elsewhere.\n\n269\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.640\nSo Agile is flexible.\n\n270\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.890\nAnd Agile is about keeping\nour customers happy, but\n\n271\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.090\nmaking sure that we can deliver software,\nthat we can develop and\n\n272\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:36.315\nwe can deliver software\nin an iterative way.\n\n273\n00:14:36.315 --> 00:14:40.865\nAnd exactly the same with our cellphones,\nwith our mobile phones and\n\n274\n00:14:40.865 --> 00:14:45.445\nan operating system and all of those apps\nthat nowadays they update themselves\n\n275\n00:14:45.445 --> 00:14:49.505\novernight and\nyou don't even notice that it's happening.\n\n276\n00:14:49.505 --> 00:14:51.005\nThat's where we want to be.\n\n277\n00:14:52.085 --> 00:14:55.790\nAnd so we have to adapt our projects,\n\n278\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:00.760\nadapt our delivery, and adapt our\ndevelopment as the project progresses.\n\n279\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:06.520\nWhat starts off as being our\ndeliverable is not always what\n\n280\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.840\nends up as being our deliverable\nin a waterfall project.\n\n281\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.500\nAnd in an Agile project,\nwe acknowledge that.\n\n282\n00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.040\nAnd we actually plan to adapt,\nand funnily enough,\n\n283\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.710\nif you plan to change,\nthen it makes change a lot less painful.\n\n284\n00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.440\nSomething else that we don't\nlike to do in Agile, and\n\n285\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.790\nI'm gonna get into this in\nsome of our other episodes,\n\n286\n00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:32.340\nis that we do not like to spend too\nmuch time on bureaucracy and red tape.\n\n287\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.770\nAnd in fact, very similar to ITIL for\n\n288\n00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.950\nservice management,\nwe want to remove bureaucracy.\n\n289\n00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.140\nWe want to make our development\nprocess more efficient.\n\n290\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.110\nWe're looking at efficient\ndelivery of software,\n\n291\n00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.720\nand that's what we're doing with Agile.\n\n292\n00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.070\nSo we talk about self-organization,\nwe talk about\n\n293\n00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:59.710\nallowing our team to manage\nthemselves within certain guidelines.\n\n294\n00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.060\nEmpowering people, and\nwe really love that word, too.\n\n295\n00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.004\nSo that's an introduction really and\nlittle bit of history to Agile or\n\n296\n00:16:09.004 --> 00:16:13.071\nwhere it came from and\njust the differences between Agile and\n\n297\n00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:17.935\nthe traditional waterfall approach and\nwhy this flexible approach is so\n\n298\n00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:20.830\nrelevant to business nowadays.\n\n299\n00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.300\nIn our next episode, we're actually going\nto be looking at that Agile manifesto\n\n300\n00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:30.250\nthat was created back in 2001,\nso I hope to see you back then.\n\n301\n00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.350\nPerfect, Jo, thank you so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n302\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.230\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\nbut stay tuned for that next episode.\n\n303\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.641\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n304\n00:16:37.641 --> 00:16:38.255\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.254\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone, to your\nAgile Project Management Concepts series,\n\n6\n00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:17.720\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.140\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at the Agile manifesto.\n\n8\n00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.810\nAnd of course, with us back in studios\ntoday, we have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.200\nThank you for joining us today,\nJo, how are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.812\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:30.980\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; How are you?\n\n12\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.890\nI'm actually pretty excited to\ntake a look at this manifesto,\n\n14\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.760\nbecause this is really where\nit all started, right?\n\n15\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.460\nThis was the document that kind\nof paved the way and outlined,\n\n16\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.130\nI guess what is this,\na best practices that we'll be looking at?\n\n17\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.662\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n18\n00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:48.702\nin the manifesto we're gonna look in this\nparticular episode at the manifesto.\n\n19\n00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:51.866\nAnd then in the next episode we're\ngonna look at the principles that\n\n20\n00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.690\nare in the manifesto.\n\n21\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.678\nThis is really the, I guess,\nI don't wanna call it the principles,\n\n22\n00:00:58.678 --> 00:01:00.170\nbecause we've got the 12 principles.\n\n23\n00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.523\nThis is really our underlying theme,\n\n24\n00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:07.754\nthis is what underpins our job project\nmanagement, that's what our manifesto is.\n\n25\n00:01:07.754 --> 00:01:12.185\nI mean, we call it a statement of values,\nreally, it's what we value.\n\n26\n00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.455\nAnd you'll see straightaway,\nand in our next episode,\n\n27\n00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:19.605\nwe'll spend a little bit of time looking\nat the difference between waterfall\n\n28\n00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:24.250\napproaches, such as PMI and\nPRINCE2, and the Agile approaches.\n\n29\n00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.340\nBut really we just do things slightly\ndifferently here in our Agile world.\n\n30\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n31\n00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.364\n&gt;&gt; So we can take a look at the values\nright now, and you'll see that we value.\n\n32\n00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:40.300\nAnd that's the thing, you've got to put\nthe word value in front of all of these.\n\n33\n00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.480\nWe value individuals and\ninteractions over processes and tools.\n\n34\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.960\nWe value working software over\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n35\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.500\nAnd we value working together and\n\n36\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.180\ncollaboration over having a piece\nof paper and contract negotiation.\n\n37\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.002\nNow that that might be a little\nbit strange to some people.\n\n38\n00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:00.514\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I-\n\n39\n00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:01.027\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:02:01.027 --> 00:02:02.292\n&gt;&gt; You saw my face,\n\n41\n00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:04.100\nbecause I'm just like, what?\n\n42\n00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.950\nYeah, if you have a statement of work or\nSLA and something binding like that.\n\n43\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.650\nBut it's okay, I'll trust this process and\nI'll let you guide us, Jo.\n\n44\n00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.322\n&gt;&gt; Keep calm, take a breath.\n\n45\n00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:14.471\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right,\n\n46\n00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:15.985\nwe'll be okay on this one.\n\n47\n00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:16.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n48\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.780\n&gt;&gt; Think about,\nback to our previous episode.\n\n49\n00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.150\nIn our previous episode we looked at\nthe fact that when it's cast in stone,\n\n50\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.515\nyou can't change it.\n\n51\n00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:27.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so think about the bullet-\n\n52\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.070\n&gt;&gt; But that's my mentality right now.\n\n53\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.570\n&gt;&gt; Right-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.690\n&gt;&gt; But then think about a contract.\n\n55\n00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.680\nHow many times have you read the small\n\n56\n00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.590\nprint in a contract?\n\n57\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.335\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n&gt;&gt; That would be a never.\n\n58\n00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:36.860\n&gt;&gt; This is a-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.839\n&gt;&gt; We're being recorded right now,\n\n60\n00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:42.133\nso I have to be honest, right?\n&gt;&gt; All the time, yeah, all the time.\n\n61\n00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.280\n&gt;&gt; Sure, sounds good.\n\n62\n00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,\n\n63\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.944\nwe don't.\nWe spend a lot of time arguing about\n\n64\n00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:52.680\nthe small print and arguing about\ncertain words in contracts, etc.\n\n65\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.930\nAll that time could be spent working, and\n\n66\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.000\nlet's get together working as a team.\nSometimes with contracts,\n\n67\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.330\nthe wording in contracts, or just there\nmight be a specific clause in a contract\n\n68\n00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.380\nthat might really sort of cause\nproblems between the two of us.\n\n69\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.409\nJust because I don't want it one way and\nyou want it another way, and\n\n70\n00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.805\nwe can't reach an agreement.\n\n71\n00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:14.660\nWell, we're not going to collaborate\nfrom that moment onwards.\n\n72\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.842\nWe're not gonna work together as a team.\n\n73\n00:03:15.842 --> 00:03:17.045\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n74\n00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:19.426\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe'll take a look at that in a second.\n\n75\n00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:22.763\nAnd then the last one is that we\nvalue responding to change over\n\n76\n00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:24.340\nfollowing a plan.\n\n77\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.640\nNow, I'm not gonna tell you that\nwe don't follow plans, all right?\n\n78\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.060\nEverything has to be planned out.\n\n79\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.310\nBut what we're saying is we respond\nto changes, to request for changes.\n\n80\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.494\nAnd to business changes over\nsticking rigidly to a plan,\n\n81\n00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:44.140\nwe don't wanna do that, that's-\n&gt;&gt; Especially if it's gonna cause\n\n82\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.272\na detriment to the customer,\nor can I say project at stake?\n\n83\n00:03:48.272 --> 00:03:49.034\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n84\n00:03:49.034 --> 00:03:52.330\nwe're still using those terms here, but-\n&gt;&gt; It's still a project.\n\n85\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n86\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.411\n&gt;&gt; I'm just making sure,\n\n87\n00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:57.919\nbecause different vendors.\n\n88\n00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:03.695\nBut I guess I wouldn't be very Agile if we\nhad these particular ideals set in stone,\n\n89\n00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:04.695\nnow would it?\n\n90\n00:04:04.695 --> 00:04:07.279\n&gt;&gt; Well think about it,\nyou just used the word Agile.\n\n91\n00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n92\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.690\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly what it is.\n\n93\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.970\nWe're not talking about\nan upper case Agile,\n\n94\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.130\nwe're talking about lower\ncase agile as well.\n\n95\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.660\nIt's an agile approach\nto project management,\n\n96\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.150\nwhich means it's flexible by it's nature.\n\n97\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.820\nWe're not trying to\ncross all of the t's and\n\n98\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.565\ndot all of the i's, and then cast\nthem in stone and say, that's it.\n\n99\n00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:31.755\nThe project looks like this and\nit's never going to change.\n\n100\n00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:36.535\nWe've got to accept that change happens,\nand we've got to be able to respond to it.\n\n101\n00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:40.785\nYou bury your head in the sand and just\nignore change, and it's not gonna go away.\n\n102\n00:04:40.785 --> 00:04:41.775\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n103\n00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:43.585\n&gt;&gt; So think common sense.\n\n104\n00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:48.368\nI like to think that Agile, and\na lot of our methodologies as well within\n\n105\n00:04:48.368 --> 00:04:52.535\nIT; in the IT arena,\nIt's kinda common sense written down.\n\n106\n00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:54.300\nAnd you'll hear me say that a lot.\n\n107\n00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.760\nWhether I'm doing consultancy or\nwhether I'm a student in a classroom.\n\n108\n00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.620\nYou will hear me say\nthe words common sense a lot.\n\n109\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.540\nNow I know you can turn around and say to\nme that, yeah, but Jo, you don't have any.\n\n110\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.535\n[LAUGH] And I'm all right with that, but\nthat's why I need it written down, right?\n\n111\n00:05:09.535 --> 00:05:13.411\n[LAUGH] Because we've gotta\nwrite down what makes sense.\n\n112\n00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:17.290\nAnd we've got to be able\nto apply what makes sense.\n\n113\n00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.570\nAnd stop trying to get tied up in\nbureaucracy and red tape, and stop trying\n\n114\n00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.850\nto work to something that, well,quite\nfrankly, you can't work towards.\n\n115\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.961\nBecause if your end goal has changed, or\nyour way of working in your organization\n\n116\n00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:33.815\nhas changed,\nthen your projects have got to adapt too.\n\n117\n00:05:33.815 --> 00:05:37.060\nYou can't just carry on the way you were,\nyou can't carry on blindly.\n\n118\n00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.640\nSo let's take a look at these\nin a little bit more depth.\n\n119\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.310\nAnd we're gonna start off\nwith the individuals and\n\n120\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.920\ninteractions over processes and tools.\n\n121\n00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.360\nWe're not saying that there\nisn't a place for processes and\n\n122\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.243\nthat there isn't a place for\ntools, because there are.\n\n123\n00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:56.190\nBut you know what?\n\n124\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.920\nWe've got a saying in England,\nI don't know whether I should say that.\n\n125\n00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.550\nBut [LAUGH] a tool is only ever as good\nas the tool it's programmed in, right?\n\n126\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.421\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:06:06.421 --> 00:06:07.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're good.\n\n128\n00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.836\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're good with that one, yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:14.410\nBut what that really, really means is the\nfact that the tool is only ever be as good\n\n130\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.230\nas you have configured it to be.\n\n131\n00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.640\nIt's really simple,\n\n132\n00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.340\na process is only gonna ever be as good\nas the person who's designed the process.\n\n133\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.020\nAnd well, it's a motivated individual\nthat we need to design a process or\n\n134\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.490\nto configure a tool.\n\n135\n00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.350\nIf we don't have the right\npeople doing the work, then\n\n136\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.940\nthe quality of the work that we're gonna\nget out of them is going to be reduced.\n\n137\n00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.570\n&gt;&gt; Right, and in my IT mind,\nI'm relating that to look,\n\n138\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.620\nyou can have a plethora of\ntools available to you.\n\n139\n00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.360\nBut having a good technician or\nadministrator to know which\n\n140\n00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.902\ntools to use in certain circumstances\nis also a big thing too, right?\n\n141\n00:06:54.902 --> 00:07:00.182\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, and you need to\nhave people are motivated as well.\n\n142\n00:07:00.182 --> 00:07:04.078\nIt's talks about motivated and\ntalented individuals.\n\n143\n00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:07.760\nAnd we're not just talk about technical\nskills, w're talking about motivation.\n\n144\n00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.020\nHow motivated you are has a lot\nto do with what your output is,\n\n145\n00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.150\nand the quality of the output\nof the work that you provide.\n\n146\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.791\nIf you're incredibly motivated, and in\nfact just before we started filming this\n\n147\n00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:22.230\nepisode, we were talking\nabout culture a little bit.\n\n148\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.990\nAnd if the culture in your\nenvironment is strict and is rigid,\n\n149\n00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.260\nwhich it can be in a traditional\nwaterfall approach.\n\n150\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.115\nIf the culture is too strict and\ntoo rigid,\n\n151\n00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:37.230\nthen it can work to your advantage or\nit can work to your disadvantage.\n\n152\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.476\nBecause if we're insisting\nthat people get in and\n\n153\n00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:45.340\nwe have meetings at 9 AM every morning,\nand we don't allow flexibility in\n\n154\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.840\nthat as in organization, or\nas a service provider or a project team.\n\n155\n00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.201\nIf you don't allow that sort of\nflexibility, then you're gonna get people\n\n156\n00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.630\nthat are gonna come in at 9 o'clock for\nthe meeting but then, you know what?\n\n157\n00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.780\nWhen it comes to 5 PM, they're\ngonna be straight out of that door.\n\n158\n00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.617\nSo we have to have people that\nare motivated as well as having\n\n159\n00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:05.110\nthe right skills.\n\n160\n00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.140\nYou can have somebody who has got\nqualifications coming out of their ears.\n\n161\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.047\nBut if they're not motivated, they're not\ngoing to produce quality work for you.\n\n162\n00:08:14.047 --> 00:08:18.351\nSo you have to have somebody, if we look\ndown the bullet points of the individuals,\n\n163\n00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:21.379\nyou have to have people who can\ntalk to the business users.\n\n164\n00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:26.296\nYou have to have people that can engage in\nface to face contact with the customers,\n\n165\n00:08:26.296 --> 00:08:30.975\nspeak to them in their language,\nusing all sorts of communication methods.\n\n166\n00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:34.222\nIt's not necessarily about emails, and\n\n167\n00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:37.520\nwe've already just mentioned\nabout having things written down.\n\n168\n00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.817\nThat's a misconception with\nsome of the words that we use.\n\n169\n00:08:41.817 --> 00:08:46.506\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's something that I\neven, one of the biggest challenges for\n\n170\n00:08:46.506 --> 00:08:49.838\nme, Jo, is just thinking\nat an international level.\n\n171\n00:08:49.838 --> 00:08:51.383\nJust remembering that, look,\n\n172\n00:08:51.383 --> 00:08:54.082\nnot all of our members\nare sitting in the United States.\n\n173\n00:08:54.082 --> 00:08:57.710\nSo I have to, and I do apologize\nif you are one of those members.\n\n174\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:02.600\nBecause sometimes I do use a very\nsmall subset of analogies or\n\n175\n00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.730\nsomething like that.\n\n176\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.339\nBut even just working with\ndifferent hosts like you, Jo.\n\n177\n00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:11.065\nAnd being able to, I don't wanna say\nadapt to personalities, but that is,\n\n178\n00:09:11.065 --> 00:09:13.467\nbecause people are so\ndifferent in so many ways.\n\n179\n00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:16.468\nAnd just being able to have\nthat different communication.\n\n180\n00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:19.541\n&gt;&gt; I've beaten her into\nsubmission [LAUGH].\n\n181\n00:09:19.541 --> 00:09:23.349\n&gt;&gt; I'm chained to the desk\nright now [LAUGH].\n\n182\n00:09:23.349 --> 00:09:27.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just told her, you're not\nthe only one around here [LAUGH].\n\n183\n00:09:27.078 --> 00:09:27.806\n&gt;&gt; But it's true.\n\n184\n00:09:27.806 --> 00:09:29.564\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and that's,\n\n185\n00:09:29.564 --> 00:09:34.080\nthere's a difference in\nlanguage between the two of us.\n\n186\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.779\nBut there's also a difference in\nlanguage between IT, and the business,\n\n187\n00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:38.731\nand the customer.\n\n188\n00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:39.362\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n189\n00:09:39.362 --> 00:09:43.360\n&gt;&gt; And we have to make sure that we\ncommunicate in the right language.\n\n190\n00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.550\nAnd we have a saying, in when we\ntalk about methodologies and things.\n\n191\n00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.171\nWe always say that communication should\nalways be in the language of the audience,\n\n192\n00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:52.707\nalways.\n\n193\n00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:56.237\nIt's not your job, you out there,\nit's not your job to try and\n\n194\n00:09:56.237 --> 00:09:58.660\nfigure out what I'm saying.\n\n195\n00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:04.210\nIt's my job to ensure that I speak clearly\nand in a language that you can understand.\n\n196\n00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.620\nYou shouldn't be sitting there trying\nto Google something to try and\n\n197\n00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.520\nfigure out what that means.\n\n198\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.410\nIn a previous episode, in English,\nwe use the word redundant, and\n\n199\n00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.760\nredundant means to be\nlaid off in American.\n\n200\n00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.240\nAnd so sometimes, right,\nit means something completely different.\n\n201\n00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.105\nSo when we talk about redundant systems\nin the UK, we talk about resilience.\n\n202\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.705\nRight, there,\nI've just blown her mind, completely.\n\n203\n00:10:29.705 --> 00:10:33.452\nIf you could see the expression\non her face right now.\n\n204\n00:10:33.452 --> 00:10:38.305\n&gt;&gt; Well, here in the United States,\nredundancy means redundant, being too\n\n205\n00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:43.170\nmany times, like we're saying the same\nword in a sentence too many times.\n\n206\n00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.880\nBut we do want redundancy when\nit comes to our IT systems, so\n\n207\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.040\nthat we have failsafe mechanisms.\n\n208\n00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.600\nAnd we have that redundancy so we don't\nput all of our eggs in one basket and\n\n209\n00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.420\nwe lose them.\n\n210\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.869\nBut as far as being terminated, or\nfired, or whatever you wanna call it,\n\n211\n00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:00.502\nyeah, I don't use that term so\nmuch, in that context.\n\n212\n00:11:00.502 --> 00:11:06.283\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and that's exactly, if\nyou mentioned about redundancy in the UK,\n\n213\n00:11:06.283 --> 00:11:08.937\nif you mentioned the word redundant.\n\n214\n00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:14.142\nThen the first thing that people\nwill think about is being laid off,\n\n215\n00:11:14.142 --> 00:11:18.261\nis looking for another job,\nyou are made redundant.\n\n216\n00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:23.072\nSo this is what I mean about language,\nyou've gotta talk in the right language,\n\n217\n00:11:23.072 --> 00:11:25.050\nthe language of your audience.\n\n218\n00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.220\nAnd you have to understand\nthat even in business and\n\n219\n00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.740\nIT, we talk in different languages.\n\n220\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.270\nWhich is why we talk about,\nif you look at the bullet points there,\n\n221\n00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.110\nabout appropriate communication methods.\n\n222\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.060\nMaking sure that you really\nunderstand what the business wants.\n\n223\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.520\nBecause if you don't understand\nwhat the business wants,\n\n224\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.239\nif you assume you're talking\nthe same language as the business.\n\n225\n00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:49.935\nThen the deliverable that you are going\nto well deliver at the end of\n\n226\n00:11:49.935 --> 00:11:54.435\nthe project isn't gonna be valuable to\nthem, it's not gonna be what they want.\n\n227\n00:11:54.435 --> 00:11:58.870\nI'm going along with\nthe motivated individuals,\n\n228\n00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.010\nmotivated individuals tend to\nbe those that are empowered.\n\n229\n00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.940\nIn other words,\nthose that are left to do their work,\n\n230\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.320\nnot those that are micromanaged.\n\n231\n00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.762\nAnd so we want to empower individuals, and\n\n232\n00:12:11.762 --> 00:12:16.073\nwe value the individuals\nover the process and tools.\n\n233\n00:12:16.073 --> 00:12:20.718\nWe want to have self-organizing teams,\nwe want to have teams that are able\n\n234\n00:12:20.718 --> 00:12:24.858\nto manage themselves, and\nthis is why we talk about empowerment.\n\n235\n00:12:24.858 --> 00:12:29.500\nNow, there's also a little bullet point in\nthere that I mentioned the word DevOps.\n\n236\n00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.810\nDevOps is a concept, and\nit refers to, I mean,\n\n237\n00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:37.100\nit quite literally means development and\noperations.\n\n238\n00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.550\nAnd it refers to the transition of\n\n239\n00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.240\nservices between the development teams and\noperations.\n\n240\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:51.035\nAnd in agile, we value DevOps,\nin agile, we understand that sometimes\n\n241\n00:12:51.035 --> 00:12:56.650\nthe traditional waterfall approach\nto projects is conceived.\n\n242\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.633\nAnd we're not saying that\nthis is the right way, and\n\n243\n00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:01.270\nwe're not saying that\nthis is 100% of the time.\n\n244\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:06.630\nWhat I'm saying is, sometimes\nthe waterfall approach is perceived to be\n\n245\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.020\nthrowing things over the fence.\n\n246\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:14.095\nAnd I hear that quite a lot in operations\nenvironments, where traditional waterfall\n\n247\n00:13:14.095 --> 00:13:18.508\napproaches and traditional teams can't\nwait to walk away from a project.\n\n248\n00:13:18.508 --> 00:13:22.267\n&gt;&gt; So kind of like passing the buck, or\npassing that on to the next department or\n\n249\n00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:23.224\nthe next process?\n\n250\n00:13:23.224 --> 00:13:27.981\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly, and what they want to do\nin some organizations, and I've witnessed\n\n251\n00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:33.210\nthis, the project teams, they say, right,\nI've been working with this for 18 months.\n\n252\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.298\nThat said, I'm washing my hands of it,\nyou can have it, and\n\n253\n00:13:36.298 --> 00:13:38.064\nit's handed over to operations.\n\n254\n00:13:38.064 --> 00:13:42.230\nAnd then the project team are perceived\nto run away as quickly as possible.\n\n255\n00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.475\nAnd then the operations guys\nare sitting there, looking like,\n\n256\n00:13:45.475 --> 00:13:47.411\nI don't know what to do with this now.\n\n257\n00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:50.250\nSomebody’s got an issue and\nI don’t know what to do about it.\n\n258\n00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.540\nWe’ve got a problem here and\nI don’t know where to turn.\n\n259\n00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.620\nThat’s why that last bullet point on\nthe slide in front of you talks about\n\n260\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.970\ncommitment, okay,\ncommitment to transitioning a project.\n\n261\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.144\nWhich means that operations have gotta\nbe involved in the design of any new\n\n262\n00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:06.962\nsoftware, because after all,\n\n263\n00:14:06.962 --> 00:14:10.277\nit’s gotta be developed in\na way that they can support it.\n\n264\n00:14:10.277 --> 00:14:13.972\nBut also, the project team have\ngot to be involved in operations.\n\n265\n00:14:13.972 --> 00:14:18.881\nbecause it's only by understanding what\nsort of issues operations team have and\n\n266\n00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:23.360\nhow they work that you can develop\na solution that works for them.\n\n267\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.708\nIt's not just got to work for\nthe business, it's gotta work for\n\n268\n00:14:26.708 --> 00:14:27.455\nthem as well.\n\n269\n00:14:27.455 --> 00:14:29.172\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Jo, that sounds wonderful, but\n\n270\n00:14:29.172 --> 00:14:32.830\nare there any potential issues\nthat we need to think about here?\n\n271\n00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're not saying is that\nwe don't have any processes at all, and\n\n272\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.200\nthat's a common misconception.\n\n273\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.430\nWhen we talk about individuals\nover processes, well,\n\n274\n00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.520\nwe're not saying that\nwe wipe out processes.\n\n275\n00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.801\nBecause not having processes\ncan cause some issues.\n\n276\n00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:51.626\nFor instance, and you've got them\non the slide in front of you, but\n\n277\n00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:55.199\nif we don't have processes we\ncan't forget what we are doing.\n\n278\n00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:59.989\nAnd so we do need to have processes in\nplace, because, well, IT tends to be too\n\n279\n00:14:59.989 --> 00:15:05.150\nfocused on what it is they're doing,\nand they forget about the business.\n\n280\n00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.988\nAnd the business world tends\nto just leave IT to it, and\n\n281\n00:15:08.988 --> 00:15:12.164\nleave the development\nteam to it [CROSSTALK].\n\n282\n00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:13.334\n&gt;&gt; Segregation or separation there?\n\n283\n00:15:13.334 --> 00:15:18.214\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we do need to have some\nprocesses in place that will ensure that\n\n284\n00:15:18.214 --> 00:15:23.256\nthere is that collaboration that\nhappens with the business environment,\n\n285\n00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:26.230\nand also with other\nteams within IT as well.\n\n286\n00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.402\nWe've also gotta ensure, and\nagain, processes will help us,\n\n287\n00:15:29.402 --> 00:15:32.770\nthat we're not too focused on\nthe actual technology itself.\n\n288\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.500\nWe're not too focused on trying\nto play with a nice, new,\n\n289\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.740\nshiny toy, like I like to.\n\n290\n00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.386\nBut we're actually focused on\nthe entire customer experience as well.\n\n291\n00:15:42.386 --> 00:15:45.013\nAnd we want to make sure as well,\nand again,\n\n292\n00:15:45.013 --> 00:15:49.415\nwe need to incorporate this into our\nprocesses, that we do communicate in\n\n293\n00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:53.178\nthe language of the customer a nd\nthe language of the audience.\n\n294\n00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:58.170\nAnd therefore, there is a process in place\nor some check in place to ensure that\n\n295\n00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:02.120\nwe understand that language,\nthe language of the audience.\n\n296\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.773\nSo let's move on, now, to our next value.\n\n297\n00:16:05.773 --> 00:16:08.922\nThen in our next value,\nas we've seen on our first slide,\n\n298\n00:16:08.922 --> 00:16:12.820\nwas the working systems over\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n299\n00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.864\nNow again, we're not saying that\nyou shouldn't have documentation.\n\n300\n00:16:15.864 --> 00:16:18.490\nOf course, you need documentation.\n\n301\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.380\nBut when was the last time\nyou looked at a manual?\n\n302\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.438\nGo on, admit it.\n\n303\n00:16:23.438 --> 00:16:28.113\n&gt;&gt; If it doesn't work,\nthen I might look at the manual.\n\n304\n00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:33.047\nBut maybe it's an IT thing or maybe\nit's just a stubborn person thing, but\n\n305\n00:16:33.047 --> 00:16:35.490\nI always try to give it a go at home.\n\n306\n00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.520\nIn a business environment,\n\n307\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.048\nthen that's different, but-\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n\n308\n00:16:39.048 --> 00:16:40.782\nNo it's not, don't you dare.\n\n309\n00:16:40.782 --> 00:16:42.226\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No it's not,\n\n310\n00:16:42.226 --> 00:16:44.468\nbecause you are every bit as bad as me.\n\n311\n00:16:44.468 --> 00:16:47.094\nAnd this is why I ask the question,\nbecause yes,\n\n312\n00:16:47.094 --> 00:16:49.158\nI hardly might never look at a manual.\n\n313\n00:16:49.158 --> 00:16:50.930\nYou leave them when\nsomething has gone wrong.\n\n314\n00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.080\nI've seen them Google it\nrather than look at the manual\n\n315\n00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.905\neven in a working environment.\n\n316\n00:16:55.905 --> 00:16:59.002\n&gt;&gt; Well, I would say definitely\nresearch it in a work environment.\n\n317\n00:16:59.002 --> 00:17:03.070\nMaybe not the full technical\nstereo manual type reading,\n\n318\n00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.390\nbut I always definitely\nresearch in a work environment.\n\n319\n00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, so why are we spending time\nin projects producing comprehensive\n\n320\n00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.000\ndocumentation that nobody\nis ever gonna read?\n\n321\n00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n322\n00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.600\n&gt;&gt; So this is why we say yeah,\nthat's elegant, it's common sense.\n\n323\n00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.460\nThis is why we say only\nnecessary documentation.\n\n324\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.770\nSo documentation is going to be\nhanded over to the support teams.\n\n325\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.580\nThat's, definitely, needed.\n\n326\n00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.210\nBut other documentation?\n\n327\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.820\nThink about whether that\ndocument is actually going to\n\n328\n00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.760\nbe needed whether it's\ngoing to be referred to.\n\n329\n00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.202\nIf it's not going to be used,\nthen why are you producing it?\n\n330\n00:17:36.202 --> 00:17:38.730\nIt's not efficient to do so.\n\n331\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.164\nWe want to deliver working systems.\n\n332\n00:17:40.164 --> 00:17:44.727\nAnd we wanna spend our time delivering\nworking systems and delivering iterations,\n\n333\n00:17:44.727 --> 00:17:50.280\nand we'll come on toward what an iteration\nmeans, but delivering iterations quicker.\n\n334\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.740\nWe can deliver iterations more\nefficiently if we don't have to spend all\n\n335\n00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.880\nof that time documenting.\n\n336\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.280\nSo yes,\nwe do need to have some documentation.\n\n337\n00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.790\nWe need to have acceptance criteria and\n\n338\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.330\nwe'll look at acceptance\ncriteria in stories.\n\n339\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:11.390\nBut we don't want to jeopardize the\ndelivery and the time scale, just because\n\n340\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.740\nwe're producing a lot of documentation\nthat is just simply not read.\n\n341\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.690\nSo then our next value, customer\ncollaboration over contract negotiations.\n\n342\n00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.030\nWe already talked about this.\n\n343\n00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.060\nThe fact that we've gotta get along.\n\n344\n00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.776\nAnd sometimes contracts can\nprevent us from getting along.\n\n345\n00:18:27.776 --> 00:18:31.178\nAnd sometimes contracts\ncan tell us that well,\n\n346\n00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:35.270\nwe've gotta do it this way or\nwe've gotta do it that way.\n\n347\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.331\nAnd in fact, that's not\nnecessarily the way that we work.\n\n348\n00:18:37.331 --> 00:18:41.447\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, instead of working with Jo's way\nand my way, why don't we have an our way?\n\n349\n00:18:41.447 --> 00:18:43.296\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n350\n00:18:43.296 --> 00:18:47.180\nSo we don't necessarily want\nto pin everything down to\n\n351\n00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.710\na service level agreement or\nto a service level target.\n\n352\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.750\nToo often, service level targets\nby the way are used as a weapon.\n\n353\n00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.096\nAnd that's, exactly, what we don't want.\n\n354\n00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:01.703\nThat sort of service review\nmeeting where the customer and\n\n355\n00:19:01.703 --> 00:19:04.055\nthe service provider sits down and\nsays hey, look.\n\n356\n00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:07.430\nEverything is green on\nour nice chart here.\n\n357\n00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.700\nIt tells us that we've achieved\nall of our service level targets.\n\n358\n00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.544\nAnd the customer sits there and\nsays yeah, but\n\n359\n00:19:12.544 --> 00:19:14.530\nwhat about that outage note last night?\n\n360\n00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.177\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n361\n00:19:15.177 --> 00:19:21.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you don't want to rely,\ntoo heavily, on those targets.\n\n362\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.960\nWe want to work together.\n\n363\n00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.370\nAnd that's why it tells us that\nthe customer should be part of our team.\n\n364\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.410\nAnd we should be able to\nwork with our customer.\n\n365\n00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:34.990\nAnd we should not allow a piece of\npaper and a contract to get in the way.\n\n366\n00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.138\nThat's not saying that\nwe shouldn't have them.\n\n367\n00:19:37.138 --> 00:19:38.676\nBut nevertheless,\n\n368\n00:19:38.676 --> 00:19:44.650\nthey should be flexible enough to allow\nthe project team to work efficiently.\n\n369\n00:19:46.465 --> 00:19:49.850\nWe gotta make sure that whatever\ndocumentation that we've got and whatever\n\n370\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:55.090\ntype of agreement that we have in place\nthat we evaluate it on a regular basis.\n\n371\n00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.621\nAnd that we adjust any of\nthe targets sort of regularly, so\n\n372\n00:19:58.621 --> 00:20:00.937\nthat we know what we're delivering.\n\n373\n00:20:00.937 --> 00:20:03.200\nAnd we know when we're\ngoing to deliver it by and\n\n374\n00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.660\nwe know the involvement of the customer.\n\n375\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.056\nBut then what we have written down\nin those agreements is not rigid.\n\n376\n00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.124\nAnd then let's look at this, the last one,\n\n377\n00:20:14.124 --> 00:20:17.870\nwhich is responded to change\nover following a plan.\n\n378\n00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.400\nAnd that's our last value statement.\n\n379\n00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.757\nAnd we've already talked about this at\nthe beginning about embracing change.\n\n380\n00:20:23.757 --> 00:20:27.521\nAnd the fact that the only thing that we\nknow about technology is that it's gonna\n\n381\n00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:29.328\nbe different, you know about-\n&gt;&gt; It's always changing.\n\n382\n00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.884\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n383\n00:20:30.884 --> 00:20:34.036\n&gt;&gt; Which means that even in\nan Agile environment now,\n\n384\n00:20:34.036 --> 00:20:37.200\nwe've gotta get smarter\nin an Agile environment.\n\n385\n00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.364\nThere was a time back in 2001,\nand in sort of the early 2000s,\n\n386\n00:20:41.364 --> 00:20:43.989\nwhere Agile was really, really relevant.\n\n387\n00:20:43.989 --> 00:20:48.130\nAnd it was seen as the fast\nway of delivering software.\n\n388\n00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.130\nBut now when you think about how\nquickly software is developed and\n\n389\n00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.050\ndelivered, even Agile\ncould be too cumbersome.\n\n390\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.547\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm still trying to\nwrap my brain around all the time.\n\n391\n00:20:57.547 --> 00:21:01.161\nSo for someone who has worked in IT for\na very long time,\n\n392\n00:21:01.161 --> 00:21:03.920\nI'm looking at the way things used to be.\n\n393\n00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.748\nBut you can't think like that anymore,\n\n394\n00:21:05.748 --> 00:21:08.073\nyou see Microsoft changing\ntheir business model.\n\n395\n00:21:08.073 --> 00:21:10.980\nSo they're not releasing\noperating systems anymore.\n\n396\n00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.972\nThey have Windows as a service and\nit's on a continual rolling, changing,\n\n397\n00:21:15.972 --> 00:21:17.575\nevolving schedule.\n\n398\n00:21:17.575 --> 00:21:20.849\nAnd that's something that we have to\nlearn how to adjust with as well.\n\n399\n00:21:20.849 --> 00:21:25.848\n&gt;&gt; Right, I think that on my personal\nprofessional opinion is that I think\n\n400\n00:21:25.848 --> 00:21:29.349\nthe waterfall approach\nto projects definitely,\n\n401\n00:21:29.349 --> 00:21:33.930\ndefinitely has its place for\nlarge scale implementations.\n\n402\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.850\nBut I wouldn't even say it's an industry,\n\n403\n00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.680\nI just think it's a world we're moving\ntowards the more agile approach\n\n404\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.920\nin absolutely everything that we do and\neverything that we release.\n\n405\n00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.166\nWe also talk about efficiency in Agile and\nwe really do like that word.\n\n406\n00:21:50.166 --> 00:21:53.406\nAnd so we'll say things like if\nthe software is not being used,\n\n407\n00:21:53.406 --> 00:21:55.189\nwhy on earth have you got it there?\n\n408\n00:21:55.189 --> 00:21:57.210\nAnd then exactly the same\nwith documentation.\n\n409\n00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.790\nIf you don't refer to it, why is it there?\n\n410\n00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.160\nSo remove any software\nthat's not being used.\n\n411\n00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.310\nIf it's not required,\nthen you don't need it.\n\n412\n00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.679\nAnd you don't need to be programming and\n\n413\n00:22:08.679 --> 00:22:12.173\ndeveloping something that's\nnever ever going to be used.\n\n414\n00:22:12.173 --> 00:22:17.456\nNow, I like the fact that\nwe accept continual change.\n\n415\n00:22:17.456 --> 00:22:21.060\nSo we accept change right the way\nthrough to the project ends.\n\n416\n00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.110\nBut I also like, the next bullet\npoint is really important to me,\n\n417\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.543\ndirect observation,\nwhich provides validated feedback.\n\n418\n00:22:29.543 --> 00:22:34.290\nI can ask you a question and\nI can ask you a question right now.\n\n419\n00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.711\nAnd I'll say to you something, Cherokee,\n\n420\n00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:40.647\nalong the lines of are you understanding\nall of the concepts right now?\n\n421\n00:22:40.647 --> 00:22:44.184\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm just thinking of what so\nthat was just a rhetorical question?\n\n422\n00:22:44.184 --> 00:22:45.434\n&gt;&gt; That's a question.\n\n423\n00:22:45.434 --> 00:22:47.436\n&gt;&gt; A real question?\n&gt;&gt; No, no, it's a real question,\n\n424\n00:22:47.436 --> 00:22:49.300\n&gt;&gt; It sounds great to be able to adapt,\n\n425\n00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.280\nbut what if I'm in this continual loop\nwhere you're just not satisfied with\n\n426\n00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.220\nmy work and you wanna keep changing.\n\n427\n00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.148\nAm I ever gonna get a break or?\n\n428\n00:22:56.148 --> 00:22:58.415\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A simple yes or\n\n429\n00:22:58.415 --> 00:22:59.531\nno would have done right there,\nare you with me?\n\n430\n00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:03.506\n&gt;&gt; You know I couldn't be that easy,\nJo, that's a good point.\n\n431\n00:23:03.506 --> 00:23:07.601\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's just assume she said yes.\n\n432\n00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:11.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The only way I'm really gonna truly\n\n433\n00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:16.070\nfind out whether Cherokee is really\nunderstood what I'm saying is\n\n434\n00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.790\nby seeing if she goes and applies it.\n\n435\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.530\nIt's the only way I'm gonna find out.\n\n436\n00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.880\n&gt;&gt; Test me, right?\n\n437\n00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.624\n&gt;&gt; Well, I could test you, that's one way.\n\n438\n00:23:23.624 --> 00:23:26.872\nBut then that's just testing\nthat you understand the theory.\n\n439\n00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:29.019\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm thinking like\na performance-based test.\n\n440\n00:23:29.019 --> 00:23:32.842\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, yeah,\nwe don't necessarily like that.\n\n441\n00:23:32.842 --> 00:23:36.418\nWhat we want to do is we want to,\nwe talk about direct observation.\n\n442\n00:23:36.418 --> 00:23:39.914\nThe only way I'm really going to\nunderstand whether you've understood any\n\n443\n00:23:39.914 --> 00:23:41.670\nof this is to see whether you apply it.\n\n444\n00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:45.270\nIt's to see whether you can use it\nin your day to day environment.\n\n445\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:50.780\nAnd we value direct observation over\nasking questions and over the testing.\n\n446\n00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.270\nBecause the testing and asking questions,\nall that's going to do is that's gonna\n\n447\n00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.510\nshow me that you're able\nto memorize something or\n\n448\n00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.310\nthat you're able to learn something.\n\n449\n00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.834\nIt's not gonna tell me that\nyou're able to apply it.\n\n450\n00:24:01.834 --> 00:24:03.261\n&gt;&gt; Implement it, right?\n\n451\n00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:06.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, and some of the most important\nconversations happen in break rooms.\n\n452\n00:24:07.367 --> 00:24:08.064\nTrue story.\n\n453\n00:24:08.064 --> 00:24:10.959\n&gt;&gt; That's where we find out whether\nyou've really understood what we're\n\n454\n00:24:10.959 --> 00:24:12.620\ntalking about.\n\n455\n00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.460\nSo we like direct observation.\n\n456\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.940\nI like to call it the getting\noff your bum principle.\n\n457\n00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.090\nIt means get off your bum and go and see.\n\n458\n00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.794\nGo and see what's really happening\nrather than just listening to feedback.\n\n459\n00:24:23.794 --> 00:24:27.437\n&gt;&gt; Something that I think is pretty\ncool that our Dev team does is they work\n\n460\n00:24:27.437 --> 00:24:29.310\nin pairs, but they share systems.\n\n461\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:34.240\nSo they have dual monitors for\neach one of the collaborators.\n\n462\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.940\nSo that they can watch each other\ndoing their work to make sure that\n\n463\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.340\nthey are staying on track.\n\n464\n00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.949\nI guess kind of like keeping each\nother honest like we do here.\n\n465\n00:24:41.949 --> 00:24:42.611\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n466\n00:24:42.611 --> 00:24:45.632\n[LAUGH] Well you know what we're gonna\ntalk about this in a later episode\n\n467\n00:24:45.632 --> 00:24:46.407\nfunnily enough.\n\n468\n00:24:46.407 --> 00:24:48.218\nWe're gonna talk about\npartner development.\n\n469\n00:24:48.218 --> 00:24:49.143\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.\n\n470\n00:24:49.143 --> 00:24:52.932\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, we'll expand on that, but\nyeah, keeping each other in check.\n\n471\n00:24:52.932 --> 00:24:55.022\nCuz someone's gotta keep me in check.\n\n472\n00:24:55.022 --> 00:24:56.125\nSomeone's gotta keep an eye on her.\n\n473\n00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:58.110\n&gt;&gt; It's hard work, but\nsomebody's gotta do it.\n\n474\n00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.474\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so and again,\n\n475\n00:25:00.474 --> 00:25:06.053\nwhen we talk about embracing change,\nthat last bullet point looks irrelevant.\n\n476\n00:25:06.053 --> 00:25:09.447\nOur desires and\nour needs as an organization changes,\n\n477\n00:25:09.447 --> 00:25:12.060\nand they change very rapidly now.\n\n478\n00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.200\nSo we need to develop\nat a sustainable pace.\n\n479\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.975\nWe need to accept that we have\ngot to respond to change,\n\n480\n00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:23.340\nbut we've also gonna try maintain\nstability at the same time.\n\n481\n00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:27.056\nAs a development team,\nwe are responsible for\n\n482\n00:25:27.056 --> 00:25:32.020\nany instabilities we may cause\nin our business environment.\n\n483\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:36.888\nBecause if were releasing at such a rapid\npace, that what we're doing is we're just\n\n484\n00:25:36.888 --> 00:25:39.740\ncausing chaos and mayhem-\n&gt;&gt; A volatile environment.\n\n485\n00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.396\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n486\n00:25:40.396 --> 00:25:41.924\n&gt;&gt; And a crazy-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n487\n00:25:41.924 --> 00:25:47.330\nyou don't build business\nconfidence by constant change.\n\n488\n00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:51.330\nSo we've got to change in a way, and\nthis is where it gets really tricky.\n\n489\n00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.670\nYou've gotta change in a way that\nthe business will embrace the change.\n\n490\n00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.990\nBut you cannot afford\nto create instability.\n\n491\n00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.865\n&gt;&gt; So maybe some kinda rolling\nrelease schedule something like that.\n\n492\n00:26:03.865 --> 00:26:08.560\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly what we've got to do\nand we'll look at that in another episode.\n\n493\n00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.449\nWe'll look at the increments and\nthe iterations and releases.\n\n494\n00:26:12.449 --> 00:26:17.905\nAnd how we actually release in a way\nthat is acceptable for our business,\n\n495\n00:26:17.905 --> 00:26:24.000\nbut in a way that we can manage as well,\nwhilst still responding to change.\n\n496\n00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.640\nSo we talk about things like\nbrown bagging lunch bite\n\n497\n00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.520\nsession to get our message across.\n\n498\n00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.190\nAnd to ensure that all of\nthe businesses engaged\n\n499\n00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.450\nin what it is we're trying to achieve.\n\n500\n00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.752\n&gt;&gt; Does that mean like a working lunch?\n\n501\n00:26:39.752 --> 00:26:40.530\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n502\n00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.154\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly like a working lunch,\nand we've had plenty of them, right.\n\n503\n00:26:43.154 --> 00:26:45.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually have one today.\n\n504\n00:26:45.035 --> 00:26:47.914\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a hint by the way.\n\n505\n00:26:47.914 --> 00:26:50.782\nI know I can tell you this.\n\n506\n00:26:50.782 --> 00:26:54.825\nSo the other thing that we've got to\nfocus on is not over engineering or\n\n507\n00:26:54.825 --> 00:26:58.059\nnot over egging the pudding,\nas I would say in English.\n\n508\n00:26:58.059 --> 00:26:58.829\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See,\n\n509\n00:26:58.829 --> 00:27:00.346\nwhile we're talking about language.\n\n510\n00:27:00.346 --> 00:27:02.808\nIt's not over-engineering.\n\n511\n00:27:02.808 --> 00:27:05.070\nKeep it simple, okay?\n\n512\n00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.737\nJust because you've ticked the box,\n\n513\n00:27:07.737 --> 00:27:12.380\nor you've checked the box, doesn't mean\nthat you're actually delivering value.\n\n514\n00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.110\nIt just means that you've\nactually got to a certain point.\n\n515\n00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:19.279\nBut it doesn't mean that the work that\nyou've done so far is in any value.\n\n516\n00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:22.280\nKeep it simple and deliver value.\n\n517\n00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.800\nPrioritize the requirements and\n\n518\n00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.290\nmake sure that you don't overload\npeople with too much work.\n\n519\n00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.160\nKeep it simple and\nthen we'll deliver value.\n\n520\n00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.030\n&gt;&gt; You like to have little sayings.\n\n521\n00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.456\nHave you ever heard of\nthe KISS methodology.\n\n522\n00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:38.965\n&gt;&gt; I have, but\nI didn't want to mention that here.\n\n523\n00:27:38.965 --> 00:27:41.913\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't think we really can go into\n\n524\n00:27:41.913 --> 00:27:44.709\ndetail, but\nyou guys might have heard about it.\n\n525\n00:27:44.709 --> 00:27:47.228\n&gt;&gt; Just don't look at the last S.\n\n526\n00:27:47.228 --> 00:27:48.270\nYou'll be fine.\n\n527\n00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.007\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So for this particular episode,\n\n528\n00:27:51.007 --> 00:27:51.770\nthat's it.\n\n529\n00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.146\nWe're gonna wrap this one up.\n\n530\n00:27:53.146 --> 00:27:58.591\nAnd in our next episode, not our last\nthough, we're actually going to look\n\n531\n00:27:58.591 --> 00:28:03.971\nat the 12 principles that underpin\nthose values in the Agile Manifesto.\n\n532\n00:28:03.971 --> 00:28:06.177\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, sounds like a plan,\nJo, thank you so much.\n\n533\n00:28:06.177 --> 00:28:08.963\nAnd thank you for joining us,\nbut it is time to sign out.\n\n534\n00:28:08.963 --> 00:28:10.484\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n535\n00:28:10.484 --> 00:28:11.459\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n536\n00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:13.967\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n537\n00:28:13.967 --> 00:28:20.039\n[MUSIC]\n\n538\n00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:26.225\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone, to your\n\n5\n00:00:13.652 --> 00:00:18.352\nagile project management concepts series,\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.538\nSo we're actually in a part two,\na continuation,\n\n7\n00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:24.760\nwhere we take a look at\nagile the manifesto.\n\n8\n00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.011\nAnd with us today back in studios,\nwe have Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:30.390\nJo Peacock, how's it going today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, Cherokee,\n\n10\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.730\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm good,\n\n11\n00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.700\nwe did start talking about what agile is,\nthe basics there.\n\n12\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.160\nAnd we started looking at that manifesto,\nbut we ran out of time.\n\n13\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.790\nSo are we gonna be picking right\nback up here in this show?\n\n14\n00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, so in our last episode,\n\n15\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.760\nwe looked at the values\nof the agile manifesto.\n\n16\n00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.660\nAnd in this particular episode,\n\n17\n00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.020\nwe're going to be looking at the 12\nprinciples that underpin those values.\n\n18\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.930\nSo these are the actual manifesto\nprinciples themselves, and\n\n19\n00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.300\nwe're also gonna be looking at\nthe three pillars of agile as well.\n\n20\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.970\nI know that it sounds\nlike a lot of jargon, and\n\n21\n00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.630\nthat's not what it\nshould be sounding like.\n\n22\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.670\nThis is, I've already said this\nbefore in previous episodes,\n\n23\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.340\nthis is kind of common sense written down\nwhen it comes to project management.\n\n24\n00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.810\nHowever, what we're gonna\nbe doing is just expanding\n\n25\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.480\nthe values that we looked\nat in our last episode.\n\n26\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.510\nAnd looking at what really underpins them,\nand what we should be doing for\n\n27\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.710\neach and every project.\n\n28\n00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.421\nSo let's jump straight into it then,\nwe'll look at now, we've got principles\n\n29\n00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:38.130\none through to principle six\non the screen in front of you.\n\n30\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.280\nThere's a lot, there are 12, [LAUGH] so\nwe can't get them all on one page.\n\n31\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.470\nSo let's just go through these one by\none and if there are any questions,\n\n32\n00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.800\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure I'll throw them out there and\n\n33\n00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.940\nask [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I've also for you, and\n\n34\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.290\nfor everybody else as well, and this will\nbe available in the downloadable material.\n\n35\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.910\nI've highlighted really what we're\nconcentrating on in each one of these\n\n36\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.090\nprinciples.\n\n37\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.900\nNumber one, our highest priority, so\n\n38\n00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.610\ntherefore it's number one, obviously,\nis to keep the customer happy.\n\n39\n00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.810\nThrough, it says early and\ncontinuous delivery of valuable software.\n\n40\n00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.670\nAnd exactly the same as I mentioned\nin a previous episode when\n\n41\n00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.320\nwe looked at frequent releases.\n\n42\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.950\nAnd I asked about updating\nyour cellphone app, and\n\n43\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.500\nhow often do you update\nthat operating system?\n\n44\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.000\nAnd it seems to me that it updates at\nleast once a month [LAUGH] nowadays.\n\n45\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.580\nAnd that's what we're looking at,\nwe're looking at continuous delivery of\n\n46\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.810\nsoftware, so we're looking at\niterations of software delivery.\n\n47\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.110\nEach one must add value, and\n\n48\n00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.340\neach one must build on the improvements of\nthe last iteration or the last release.\n\n49\n00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.660\nSo we're looking at keeping people happy.\n\n50\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.680\nThe last thing that you want, and\nI know that you've suffered this, and\n\n51\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.000\nI've suffered this as well, is when you\ndownload a version of the software,\n\n52\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.470\nyour operating system.\n\n53\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.310\nAnd you realize that\nsomething else isn't working\n\n54\n00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.710\nbecause it's not been tested properly.\n\n55\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.545\nOr because they weren't aware\nof these other add-on apps\n\n56\n00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.015\nthat you had on your phone as well.\n\n57\n00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:13.865\nIf something doesn't work and\n\n58\n00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:17.975\nyou made the situation a whole lot\nworse than what it was before.\n\n59\n00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:21.355\nAnd instead of fixing problems that you\nwere trying to fix with the release,\n\n60\n00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:23.400\nyou're actually creating new ones.\n\n61\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.700\nSo what we want to do is make\nsure that that doesn't happen.\n\n62\n00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.740\nSo we still want to have\nthat rapid delivery, but\n\n63\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.270\nwe wanna make sure that we\ndon't cause more problems, so\n\n64\n00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.020\nwe gotta keep people happy.\n&gt;&gt; And that's true because even this\n\n65\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.540\nmorning, we were just joking about\nthe user interface for Snapchat.\n\n66\n00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.709\nBut you saw with their\nlatest update they released,\n\n67\n00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.474\nthere was a lot of pushback on that UI,\nand the end users just weren't having it\n\n68\n00:03:45.474 --> 00:03:48.916\n&gt;&gt; Snap what, what was that, [LAUGH] yeah,\n\n69\n00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:52.225\nyou forget-\n&gt;&gt; It’s what all the cool kids are doing,\n\n70\n00:03:52.225 --> 00:03:54.793\nJo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, this dinosaur here is\n\n71\n00:03:54.793 --> 00:03:58.400\njust gonna have to live without that for\na little bit longer [LAUGH].\n\n72\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.750\nBut yeah, you’re right, unfortunately,\n\n73\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.450\nwhen they’re building operating systems\nand when they’re building apps.\n\n74\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.530\nOne of the things that we’ve gotta\nbe very careful of is understanding\n\n75\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.512\nwho our customer is, and what it is they\nwant, and also what they use as well.\n\n76\n00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:19.540\nNow, there's absolutely no way that\ncompanies like Snapchat or Apple and\n\n77\n00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.630\nthe operating system, there's no way they\ncan accommodate every single app that’s\n\n78\n00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.816\nout there, no way at all.\n\n79\n00:04:25.816 --> 00:04:30.490\nAnd there's no way people like Apple could\nunderstand every single one of their\n\n80\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.140\nbillions of users and\nunderstand how they work.\n\n81\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.000\nBut nevertheless,\nthat's what we should be striving to do.\n\n82\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.690\nAnd so we'll take a look at some of\nthe techniques that we can employ\n\n83\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.950\nto help us achieve that.\n\n84\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.795\nSo the second principle there\nis about welcoming change and\n\n85\n00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:49.685\nrequirements, even in late development.\n\n86\n00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:54.155\nWe've spoken in previous episodes\nabout waterfall projects.\n\n87\n00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:59.056\nAnd about how with a traditional waterfall\nstyle project, that's great for very,\n\n88\n00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:00.860\nvery large implementations.\n\n89\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.900\nBut you quite often don't see\nany delivery of the solution or\n\n90\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.080\nof the new software until a good\nfew months down the line.\n\n91\n00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.570\nAnd what that means is, though,\nthat we don't accommodate change, and\n\n92\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.150\nwe have our requirements cast in stone.\n\n93\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.690\nAnd by the time we come to\ndeliver them and release them,\n\n94\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.390\nthey're about 18 months out of date.\n\n95\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.241\nWe can't afford to be like that anymore,\n\n96\n00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:31.973\nthis was something that was great 10,\n15 years ago,\n\n97\n00:05:31.973 --> 00:05:35.976\nbut it's not something that we can really-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n98\n00:05:35.976 --> 00:05:38.130\neveryone's in a rush\nto be first to market.\n\n99\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.250\nFirst to market with this,\nfirst to market for that.\n\n100\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.872\nSo looking at these timelines,\nif it is just a couple of months,\n\n101\n00:05:44.872 --> 00:05:49.000\nin tech, that's huge, that's a long time.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n102\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.640\nit is now, but you have to understand that\nwhen these waterfall approaches first,\n\n103\n00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.950\nI'm not gonna say came out.\n\n104\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.689\nBut you have to understand that\nwhen these waterfall approaches\n\n105\n00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:05.440\nwere first conceptualized,\ndevelopment wasn't that rapid.\n\n106\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.564\nAnd we weren't releasing\nsoftware every five minutes,\n\n107\n00:06:08.564 --> 00:06:11.270\ncuz that's what it feels like right now.\n\n108\n00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.770\nBut then our users had\na different expectation, and\n\n109\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.760\nI wouldn't say a lower expectation,\nbut they had a different expectation.\n\n110\n00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.800\nNow our users expect to have a new\nversion of an operating system\n\n111\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.990\nat least once a month,\nwhereas ten years ago, they didn't.\n\n112\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.985\nThat was something that, updating your\noperating system was a huge, big upheaval,\n\n113\n00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:32.270\nand it was something that\nyou never wanted to do.\n\n114\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and good point,\n\n115\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.860\nbecause you look at something,\nlike I'm familiar with Six Sigma.\n\n116\n00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.410\nAnd you're looking at companies,\nlike what started with Motorola, right?\n\n117\n00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.790\nI wannna say, I don't remember\nthe exact year, but in the 80s.\n\n118\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.780\nAnd we have seen a huge\nevolution since then.\n\n119\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\n\n120\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.650\nwe've gotta make sure that\nwe can accommodate that.\n\n121\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.490\nAnd this is another reason why agile,\nwe mentioned, was originally thought of,\n\n122\n00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.230\nthe agile manifesto came out in 2001.\n\n123\n00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.790\nAnd these principles\nare still relevant now, but\n\n124\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.140\nwe have to adapt the way\nthat we manage our projects.\n\n125\n00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.030\nIt's really simple, it's a simple concept,\nbut it makes so much sense.\n\n126\n00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.195\nWe can't afford to have\nprojects that last for\n\n127\n00:07:13.195 --> 00:07:16.410\ntwo years when the business\nchanges every few weeks.\n\n128\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.530\nAnd that comes into point number three,\n\n129\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.760\nwhich is deliver working\nsoftware frequently.\n\n130\n00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.710\nThere's a couple things that I\nwanna bring out on that one,\n\n131\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.490\nand the first one is the word working.\n\n132\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.430\nYeah, you don't just release something,\nright, and it doesn't work.\n\n133\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.510\n&gt;&gt; And it comes down to common sense,\n\n134\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.250\nyou said that, but\n[INAUDIBLE] here on paper.\n\n135\n00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.070\nAnd we're kind of laughing and\nscoffing at this, but it happens.\n\n136\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:47.832\nSometimes that being first to market,\nthey push it out a little too fast, before\n\n137\n00:07:47.832 --> 00:07:52.562\nthe whole working part comes about, right?\n&gt;&gt; And that could be the thing that\n\n138\n00:07:52.562 --> 00:07:56.311\nsends your customers over the edge and\nsends them to somebody else, as well,\n\n139\n00:07:56.311 --> 00:07:59.024\nif They've received software\nthat doesn't work, and\n\n140\n00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:03.050\nthis is the third lot of software that\nthey've received that doesn't work.\n\n141\n00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.800\nThen they're gonna go somewhere else.\n\n142\n00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.900\nI come across a lot of software\nproviders in my day-to-day\n\n143\n00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.850\nenvironment where they have very,\nvery unhappy customers.\n\n144\n00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.505\nAnd this is because they are really\nseeing software that doesn't work,\n\n145\n00:08:20.505 --> 00:08:22.119\nit's as simple as that.\n\n146\n00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:25.186\nBut they're releasing it because\nthey've got a deadline, and\n\n147\n00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:28.320\nthe deadline says that they've\ngotta release this by next week.\n\n148\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.595\nAnd then they've gotta have\nanother release two weeks later,\n\n149\n00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:34.460\nbecause that's the sort\nof release timescale.\n\n150\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.105\nAnd so they're doing this,\neven though it doesn't work.\n\n151\n00:08:37.105 --> 00:08:39.529\nAnd we all joke about it, but\n\n152\n00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:44.584\nthere is that joke that happens\nwhen software is released.\n\n153\n00:08:44.584 --> 00:08:48.373\nAnd we look down at the sort\nof the known error list, or\n\n154\n00:08:48.373 --> 00:08:50.911\nrather the features list, right.\n\n155\n00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:52.856\n[LAUGH] It's not an known error,\nit's a feature.\n\n156\n00:08:52.856 --> 00:08:54.685\n&gt;&gt; It's not a bug, yeah,\n\n157\n00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:59.784\nit's an enhancement [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and yeah, that doesn't work,\n\n158\n00:08:59.784 --> 00:09:05.310\nso we wanna deliver working software\nfrequently, it's got to work.\n\n159\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.452\nBut it's gotta be frequent as well,\nyou can't wait for 18 months or\n\n160\n00:09:08.452 --> 00:09:09.581\n2 years to see results.\n\n161\n00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:12.416\nAnd the other thing is that if\nyou're waiting for 18 months and\n\n162\n00:09:12.416 --> 00:09:15.568\n2 years to see results, your customers\nhave probably already started\n\n163\n00:09:15.568 --> 00:09:17.420\nlooking elsewhere at that point in time.\n\n164\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.608\nAnd that comes into number four,\nwhen I said customers have already started\n\n165\n00:09:22.608 --> 00:09:28.840\nlooking elsewhere at that point in time,\nyou've gotta work with the business.\n\n166\n00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.430\nIf you don't understand who your customer\nis, and you don't understand the way that\n\n167\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.830\nthey work, and you don't understand\nthe expectations and the requirements that\n\n168\n00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.811\nthey have, then how on Earth can you\ndeliver something that they can use?\n\n169\n00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:46.529\nYou've gotta understand who your\ncustomer is, cuz you've gotta\n\n170\n00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:50.804\ngive them something that they can use.\n&gt;&gt; Business 101, right?\n\n171\n00:09:50.804 --> 00:09:51.351\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n172\n00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:55.184\nyou'd like to think so,\nbut I could tell you now,\n\n173\n00:09:55.184 --> 00:10:00.038\nI go into so many organizations,\nand they produce a RAG chart.\n\n174\n00:10:00.038 --> 00:10:05.235\nAnd a RAG chart is red, amber,\ngreen, it's traffic lights.\n\n175\n00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:09.749\nAnd they'll show it to me and they'll say,\nright, this is our performance against our\n\n176\n00:10:09.749 --> 00:10:13.250\nservice level targets, and\nall of our customers see that.\n\n177\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.492\nAnd then I'll say to people, okay,\nhow many of your customers are colorblind?\n\n178\n00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:21.650\nAnd every single person,\nevery time I go into an organization,\n\n179\n00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.733\nthey look at me with that,\nsort of, well, I don't know.\n\n180\n00:10:25.733 --> 00:10:27.794\nSo why are you producing red, amber,\n\n181\n00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:31.994\ngreen if you don't know that that's\nreally relevant to your customer base?\n\n182\n00:10:31.994 --> 00:10:36.591\nThe whole idea of that chart is to see at\na glance whether we're doing well against\n\n183\n00:10:36.591 --> 00:10:41.476\nour targets, or whether we're doing badly,\nand if you can't tell the difference-\n\n184\n00:10:41.476 --> 00:10:42.795\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you're colorblind.\n\n185\n00:10:42.795 --> 00:10:44.340\n&gt;&gt; Then it's not at a glance, is it,\n\n186\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:49.340\nanymore, it's kind of, well, give me 30\nminutes and I'll take a look through this.\n\n187\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:55.653\nWe don't understand our customers,\nand that's why we gotta work together.\n\n188\n00:10:55.653 --> 00:10:58.959\nSo number five talks about\nmotivating individuals,\n\n189\n00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:02.197\nbuilding projects around\nmotivated individuals.\n\n190\n00:11:02.197 --> 00:11:05.880\nAnd then trust them or\nrather empower them to get the job done.\n\n191\n00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.870\nTrust the people that you've got working\nfor you, and don't micromanage them.\n\n192\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:16.540\nAgile is about delivering\nsoftware on a regular basis, and\n\n193\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.840\nso efficiency is really important.\n\n194\n00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.830\nIt is not efficient to micromanage people,\nand\n\n195\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.790\nhow demotivating is it if you\nhave to micromanage people?\n\n196\n00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.477\nIt shows that you don't trust them, and\nit also means that you're fostering\n\n197\n00:11:31.477 --> 00:11:34.952\nan environment where they\ndon't trust you as a manager.\n\n198\n00:11:34.952 --> 00:11:40.210\nAnd so what kind of contribution\nare they going to make to that project?\n\n199\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.140\nThey are not going to give it 100%,\nyou've gotta trust people,\n\n200\n00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.275\nyou've got to empower them.\n\n201\n00:11:47.275 --> 00:11:51.162\nAnd then I love number six,\nI've highlighted\n\n202\n00:11:51.162 --> 00:11:56.156\nface-to-face conversation,\nand I absolutely love it.\n\n203\n00:11:56.156 --> 00:12:00.988\nWe had a conversation a little\nwhile ago about something that,\n\n204\n00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:03.735\nit was the way I phrased something.\n\n205\n00:12:03.735 --> 00:12:05.584\nAnd it was the way I said something, and\n\n206\n00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:09.280\nwe talked about the fact that you\ndidn't quite understand what I said.\n\n207\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.200\nAnd there was me standing\nthere talking about,\n\n208\n00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.510\nyou've gotta have that conversation.\n\n209\n00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.657\nYou've gotta communicate in\nthe language of the audience.\n\n210\n00:12:15.657 --> 00:12:18.671\nYou were my audience and\nyou didn't understand me, so\n\n211\n00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.521\nI was really good at that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:24.315\n&gt;&gt; Face to face conversation gives you so\n\n213\n00:12:24.315 --> 00:12:27.820\nmany benefits,\nincluding the body language.\n\n214\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.003\nI can see whether you're\npaying attention to me.\n\n215\n00:12:31.003 --> 00:12:33.977\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.\n\n216\n00:12:33.977 --> 00:12:35.887\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, you've been called out,\n\n217\n00:12:35.887 --> 00:12:38.680\n[LAUGH] I can see whether\nyou're paying attention to me.\n\n218\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.100\nBut more importantly than that,\n\n219\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.869\nI can also see whether you're\nunderstanding what I'm saying.\n\n220\n00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.290\nWe communicate in absolutely\neverything that we do, and\n\n221\n00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:54.020\nif I take you to the ITIL service\nmanagement, we have a communication\n\n222\n00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.604\nprincipal in ITIL that looks at the fact\nthat we communicate all the time.\n\n223\n00:12:57.604 --> 00:13:03.098\nIn the way that we dress, in the way that\nwe carry ourselves, in our body language,\n\n224\n00:13:03.098 --> 00:13:07.258\nin the sort of comments,\nmaybe the under the breath comments,\n\n225\n00:13:07.258 --> 00:13:09.412\nI'm telling you now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or\n\n226\n00:13:09.412 --> 00:13:11.695\nlack of communication.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n227\n00:13:11.695 --> 00:13:12.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n228\n00:13:12.344 --> 00:13:13.782\n&gt;&gt; Or the lack of engagement,\n\n229\n00:13:13.782 --> 00:13:16.166\nthe lack of sort of eye contact for\ninstance.\n\n230\n00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:18.965\nWe're communicating all the time,\n\n231\n00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:23.756\nI can tell right now whether\nyou're getting what I'm saying.\n\n232\n00:13:23.756 --> 00:13:28.640\nI can't tell whether you're getting\nwhat I'm saying, I don't know.\n\n233\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.810\nSo I've gotta make sure that I\ncommunicate in your language.\n\n234\n00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:39.170\nBut I don't have that face to face method\nof communication, so I can't tell.\n\n235\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.199\nFace to face communication\nis more efficient,\n\n236\n00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:47.118\nI can understand straight away whether\nyou're on the same wavelength as me,\n\n237\n00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:51.819\nand I don't have to duplicate myself.\n&gt;&gt; So I can see now, a lot of this time in\n\n238\n00:13:51.819 --> 00:13:56.054\nwith our development team, because,\nand I keep bringing this up and\n\n239\n00:13:56.054 --> 00:14:00.523\nthis is what I have to relate it to,\nbecause I'm not a developer myself.\n\n240\n00:14:00.523 --> 00:14:05.841\nSo I'm looking at them, and they have\na remote team that they work with closely,\n\n241\n00:14:05.841 --> 00:14:10.780\nbut they're not on the phone with them,\nthey're on a messaging service.\n\n242\n00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.269\nSo I don't know if it's Skype for\nBusiness, or whatever platform they use,\n\n243\n00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:17.975\nbut they're video\nchatting with each other.\n\n244\n00:14:17.975 --> 00:14:20.571\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah, and we will tell you that,\n\n245\n00:14:20.571 --> 00:14:25.464\nin a project environment, we want you\nall in the same room, if possible.\n\n246\n00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:28.626\nNow that doesn't necessarily have to\nbe physically all in the same room,\n\n247\n00:14:28.626 --> 00:14:30.905\nthat can be virtually\nall in the same room.\n\n248\n00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:36.550\nBut you're gonna get more out\nof people if they feel involved.\n\n249\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.890\nYou're not gonna get as much out of\npeople if they feel disconnected.\n\n250\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.040\nAnd I hear people all the time say to me,\nbut\n\n251\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.290\nI get more done when I'm working from\nhome, yeah, all right, you get more done.\n\n252\n00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.120\nYou get more done in between\ndoing the laundry, in\n\n253\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.080\nbetween picking the kids up from school,\nin between doing all of the other things.\n\n254\n00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.590\nAnd yes, there are statistics\nthat say that you get more done,\n\n255\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:03.240\nbecause you use up more of your spare\ntime, you use up more of your free time.\n\n256\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.042\nWell, what we will tell you is that\nthat face to face communication,\n\n257\n00:15:07.042 --> 00:15:11.440\nthe collaboration of getting people\ntogether in one office, even virtually,\n\n258\n00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.703\nallows them to focus.\n\n259\n00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:16.424\nFocus more on the task in hand,\nbecause they become more accountable for\n\n260\n00:15:16.424 --> 00:15:18.030\ntheir time.\n\n261\n00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:22.492\nThey're not, I'll be the first one to\nadmit that i get distracted sometimes by\n\n262\n00:15:22.492 --> 00:15:24.224\nthings like social media or and\n\n263\n00:15:24.224 --> 00:15:26.839\nthat stuff.\n&gt;&gt; The Internet is kind of like\n\n264\n00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:31.646\na black hole, like an abyss,\nif you go on one little link, and you find\n\n265\n00:15:31.646 --> 00:15:35.362\nyourself 30 minutes, what happened?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so\n\n266\n00:15:35.362 --> 00:15:38.689\nthat's another reason why we'll say,\nget everybody in a team,\n\n267\n00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:42.040\nbecause then you become accountable for\nyour own actions.\n\n268\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.346\nWe're talking about efficiency,\nand we're going to talk about,\n\n269\n00:15:45.346 --> 00:15:48.362\nin another episode,\nwe're gonna talk about ideal days, and\n\n270\n00:15:48.362 --> 00:15:51.098\nwe're gonna look at actually\nwhen we're productive.\n\n271\n00:15:51.098 --> 00:15:55.640\nAnd we also wanna bring in some time\nmanagement principles into that as well.\n\n272\n00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.326\nAnd time management principles doesn't\njust mean that you've gotta be productive\n\n273\n00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:02.030\nfor eight hours a day.\n\n274\n00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.860\nIt actually means working out exactly\nwhen you are at your most productive.\n\n275\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.450\nAnd don't beat yourself up for\nthose times that you're not.\n\n276\n00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.330\nJust ensure that the tough\ntask that you do,\n\n277\n00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.110\nyou do them at a time of day\nwhen you’re most productive.\n\n278\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.023\nI mean, I don’t know about you,\nbut I’m a morning person.\n\n279\n00:16:18.023 --> 00:16:19.123\n&gt;&gt;

Well, my mom used to tell me to always\n\n287\n00:16:47.285 --> 00:16:50.675\neat the stuff that I didn't like\nfirst because then that would\n\n288\n00:16:50.675 --> 00:16:52.795\nguarantee I don't eat my plate.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:16:52.795 --> 00:16:54.254\n&gt;&gt; Eating the stuff that I liked.\n\n290\n00:16:54.254 --> 00:16:55.910\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] No one wants to eat\n\n291\n00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.463\nthe frog, right, so eat the frog first.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n292\n00:16:59.463 --> 00:17:00.739\n&gt;&gt; That's what your mom was trying to\n\n293\n00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:02.410\ntell you.\n&gt;&gt; Is that what it was?\n\n294\n00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.520\nI think if she ever saw me eating frog,\nI'd probably have been, yeah,\n\n295\n00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.208\nlet's not go there.\n&gt;&gt; All right, moving on, number seven.\n\n296\n00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:11.670\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at number seven then.\n\n297\n00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:16.270\nNumber seven simply says,\nit is what it says there.\n\n298\n00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.800\nWorking software is what\nwe want to deliver.\n\n299\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.770\nAnd again, I wanna put emphasis\non the fact that it's working.\n\n300\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.460\nAnd that's our measure of progress.\n\n301\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.650\nOur measure of progress is\nnot just the tick in the box.\n\n302\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:31.080\nIt's not just the fact that we\nhave achieved a certain target or\n\n303\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.430\nthat we've got to a certain\npoint in our timeline.\n\n304\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.700\nIt's the fact that we've\ndelivered working software.\n\n305\n00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.090\nThat's our measure of progress.\n\n306\n00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:43.013\nAnd then we talk there about\nsustainable development.\n\n307\n00:17:43.013 --> 00:17:48.420\nThat means that we want to ensure\nthat development carries on.\n\n308\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:54.274\nIt's a sustainable pace, which means that,\nwe don't do all of our development work in\n\n309\n00:17:54.274 --> 00:17:58.355\nsay January through to March, and then we\ndon't do any development work after that.\n\n310\n00:17:58.355 --> 00:17:59.997\nWe wanna sustainable pace.\n\n311\n00:17:59.997 --> 00:18:04.970\nWe've gotta set a pace within\nany project that we can maintain\n\n312\n00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.750\nthrough the length of that project,\nhowever long that may be.\n\n313\n00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.530\nBearing in mind,\n\n314\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.200\nthat quite often our projects don't\nhave a finite end date anymore.\n\n315\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.410\nLet's think about this.\n\n316\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.850\nLet's think about,\nlet's look at Apple for instance.\n\n317\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.530\nThe operating system in Apple.\n\n318\n00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.760\nI'm sure that there is nobody at\nApple that's ever sat there, and\n\n319\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.320\nturned around and said, right, okay.\n\n320\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.378\nSo when are we gonna stop\nmaking an operating system?\n\n321\n00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:32.805\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n322\n00:18:32.805 --> 00:18:35.735\nAnd you can see maybe Apple\n\n323\n00:18:35.735 --> 00:18:40.375\nwould follow suit like what with Microsoft\ndid with their software as a service.\n\n324\n00:18:40.375 --> 00:18:43.435\nIt might just change in the way\nthat their delivery of it,\n\n325\n00:18:43.435 --> 00:18:45.760\nbut yeah, it's not like hey,\n\n326\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.740\nthis is the last update you'll ever see.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's what we're\n\n327\n00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.714\nsaying now, is that we understand\nthe project where they used to be, and\n\n328\n00:18:54.714 --> 00:18:58.951\nagain the waterfall approach can work\nreally well for one-off project, but\n\n329\n00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:03.860\na lot of times, development of software\nis not just one-off activity anymore.\n\n330\n00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.090\nIt's something that we want to\nlook at on an ongoing basis.\n\n331\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.910\nBecause long gone are the years when where\nyou would bring in a software product,\n\n332\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:16.030\nand you'd put it in place, and\nyou'd say, right okay, that's good for\n\n333\n00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.100\nthe next five years.\n\n334\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:22.340\nWell, it's not good now, for\nthe next five weeks, really.\n\n335\n00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.110\nSomebody's expecting an update very,\nvery rapidly.\n\n336\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:30.190\nSo we can no longer approach our\nsoftware development with that mindset.\n\n337\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:36.030\nSo number nine is all about technical\nexcellence, and good design.\n\n338\n00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:41.200\nDesign knowing that things\nare going to be changed, and\n\n339\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.960\nthings are going to be improved on.\n\n340\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.030\nThat's where the last two words\nthere about enhancing agility,\n\n341\n00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.750\nthat's where that comes from.\n\n342\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.620\nDesign knowing that\nthings are gonna change.\n\n343\n00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.980\nSo don't design something\nthat can not be improved on.\n\n344\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.220\nDon't design something\nthat can not be changed.\n\n345\n00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.270\nYou have to design software, and\n\n346\n00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.950\ndevelop software,\nknowing that things are going to change.\n\n347\n00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.115\nThat, that software is not going to be\nin place for ever, and ever, and ever.\n\n348\n00:20:10.115 --> 00:20:11.955\nIt has to change.\n\n349\n00:20:11.955 --> 00:20:16.435\nBut then of course, we looked in\na previous episode of the KISS principle,\n\n350\n00:20:18.255 --> 00:20:19.995\nkeep it simple.\n\n351\n00:20:19.995 --> 00:20:23.775\nI really like the phrase,\nmaximizing the amount of work not done.\n\n352\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.350\nThat really means exactly as it says.\n\n353\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:33.440\nThe amount of work that you don't do,\nwell actually, you want to maximize that.\n\n354\n00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.270\nIn other words, don't do anything\nif you don't need to do it.\n\n355\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.750\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jo, I know that you're currently-\n\n356\n00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.990\n&gt;&gt; That's my philosophy anyway.\n\n357\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.730\n&gt;&gt; You're currently living in the South,\n\n358\n00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:46.173\nhow many pick up trucks\nhave you seen with [LAUGH].\n\n359\n00:20:46.173 --> 00:20:50.545\nGit ' done.\n&gt;&gt; I haven't.\n\n360\n00:20:50.545 --> 00:20:52.250\n&gt;&gt; For real?\n\n361\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.620\n&gt;&gt; I think I have actually,\n\n362\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.792\nI don't know what that means though.\n\n363\n00:20:55.792 --> 00:21:00.160\nAnd the reason I gave her the look\nis cuz I do have a pick up truck,\n\n364\n00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.660\nthat's why she got the look, I was\nwondering where she was going with this.\n\n365\n00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.690\nBut yeah, I've seen some.\n\n366\n00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.840\nBut I've seen a lot of other\nscary stickers as well.\n\n367\n00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.540\nBut if you want to tell me what\nthat means then please do.\n\n368\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Just get it done.\n\n369\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.640\nI guess like Nike, just do it.\n&gt;&gt; I like the keep calm and carry on.\n\n370\n00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all of those are-\n\n371\n00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.210\n&gt;&gt; Which is English for just shut up, and\n\n372\n00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.020\nget on with it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n373\n00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.080\n&gt;&gt; That's what that means, yeah.\n\n374\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.575\nBut yeah it's really-\n&gt;&gt; Either way you want to word it, right?\n\n375\n00:21:28.575 --> 00:21:29.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, just get on with it.\n\n376\n00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.860\nYeah, which is what she's\nsaying to me right now.\n\n377\n00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:21:33.215 --> 00:21:35.895\n&gt;&gt; But you're maximizing the amount of\n\n379\n00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:41.100\nwork not done means don't waste your\ntime on superfluous endeavours.\n\n380\n00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.060\nDon't waste your time on the frivolities.\n\n381\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.850\nKeep it simple.\n\n382\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.630\nAnd number 11, the best architectures,\nand requirements, and\n\n383\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.324\ndesigns emerge from self-organizing teams.\n\n384\n00:21:52.324 --> 00:21:53.200\nDo you know what?\n\n385\n00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.460\nAnd I'm gonna say something now.\n\n386\n00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.010\nNo, no, it's gonna be bad.\n\n387\n00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:04.862\nBut let's face it, when it's left to the\ntwo of us, we get on a lot better, right?\n\n388\n00:22:04.862 --> 00:22:07.010\nWe can get the work done, can't we?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n389\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.925\nI think so.\n&gt;&gt; Can you imagine what it would be like\n\n390\n00:22:09.925 --> 00:22:12.676\nif we had somebody standing\nover us right now,\n\n391\n00:22:12.676 --> 00:22:17.206\ntrying to, and of course, I'm not gonna-\n&gt;&gt; There are a couple comments in the chat\n\n392\n00:22:17.206 --> 00:22:19.840\nright now, from our members,\nand we see those.\n\n393\n00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.870\nBut we love you [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but ultimately,\n\n394\n00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.690\nif somebody was micromanaging us,\nwe'd find it incredibly difficult.\n\n395\n00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.760\nBecause you'd find it incredibly difficult\nto concentrate on the task at hand.\n\n396\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.430\nAnd this is what we mean\nby self-organizing teams,\n\n397\n00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.870\nit's not that we just want chaos.\n\n398\n00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.060\nWe don't want everybody running around\nlike a headless chicken just doing what\n\n399\n00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.360\nthey wanna do, and in full panic mode.\n\n400\n00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.800\nThere has to be somebody\nthat manages the team.\n\n401\n00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.030\nHowever, they manage the team from\nup here, and not from down here.\n\n402\n00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.770\nAnd this is why we encourage\nself-organizing teams, empowering people,\n\n403\n00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.470\nand trusting them to do a good job.\n\n404\n00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:03.510\nAnd then number 12, the team reflects\non how to become more effective,\n\n405\n00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.880\nand then,\nadjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\n406\n00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.760\nLet's face it, and I'm gonna go back\nto ask again, we know when we're not\n\n407\n00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.880\npulling out weight, yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n408\n00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.750\n&gt;&gt; And it's our responsibility to do\n\n409\n00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:22.220\nsomething about it because in\nthis environment we are empowered\n\n410\n00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.190\nto manage our own, what’s the word\nI’m supposed to use schedule.\n\n411\n00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.995\n&gt;&gt; Schedule.\n\n412\n00:23:26.995 --> 00:23:29.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.420\nYeah, I know she has\n\n414\n00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.617\nto say it wrong she can’t help it.\n&gt;&gt; Schedule.\n\n415\n00:23:32.617 --> 00:23:35.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we’re empowered to manage our\n\n416\n00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.390\nschedule, and we know that if we\nneed to pick up the pace because\n\n417\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:46.200\nmaybe we’ve had a bit too much rain today\nor something like that, we can do that.\n\n418\n00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.625\nBut again, if you're micromanaging\nyour team, you don't give them\n\n419\n00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:55.432\nthe flexibility to do there,\nthey're not really gonna give you 100%.\n\n420\n00:23:55.432 --> 00:23:58.973\nAnd it goes back to\nthe contract negotiation again,\n\n421\n00:23:58.973 --> 00:24:02.560\nthe collaboration over\ncontract negotiation.\n\n422\n00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.727\nIf you think about we wanna work together.\n\n423\n00:24:04.727 --> 00:24:07.637\nIf we had a firm contract that said,\n\n424\n00:24:07.637 --> 00:24:12.780\nyou have to do this much in one day,\nwe wouldn't be as focused.\n\n425\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.450\nWe'd be more focused on numbers,\nthan we would be on quality, right?\n\n426\n00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.576\nSo this takes us in to then\nthe three pillars of agile, and\n\n427\n00:24:21.576 --> 00:24:26.380\nthe three pillars of agile are\ntransparency, inspection and adaptation.\n\n428\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.090\nAnd really these are all,\nI mean we talk a lot about principles, but\n\n429\n00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:36.100\ntransparency really just looks\nat the fact that we should be\n\n430\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.110\nable to observe everything within agile.\n\n431\n00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.820\nIn other words,\n\n432\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.660\nremember what I talked about in a previous\nepisode about getting off your bum,\n\n433\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.790\nas I like to call it, observing directly?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n434\n00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.180\n&gt;&gt; Everything should be transparent.\n\n435\n00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:55.750\nAnd we will talk about boards, and\nwe'll talk about stand ups, etc in other\n\n436\n00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:01.620\nepisodes, but transparency simply\nmeans that we're not hiding anything.\n\n437\n00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.510\nProjects fail when we make an announcement\nthat this is what we're going to do and\n\n438\n00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.010\nthen nothing is seen for six months.\n\n439\n00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.800\nThat's when a project fails.\n\n440\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.030\nSo we wanna ensure that everything\nthat we do is transparent, and\n\n441\n00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.390\nthat means that we have to\ninspect on a regular basis.\n\n442\n00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:22.460\nIt says frequently, but\na regular basis as well as frequently.\n\n443\n00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.023\nOnce every ten years is regular,\nbut it's not frequent.\n\n444\n00:25:26.023 --> 00:25:30.710\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] So\nwe have to inspect frequently,\n\n445\n00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:35.506\nand then identify where\nwe're kind of veering off,\n\n446\n00:25:35.506 --> 00:25:40.526\nwhere we're not really going\nin the right direction.\n\n447\n00:25:40.526 --> 00:25:43.540\nInspection doesn't mean that\nyou stop somebody from working.\n\n448\n00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.160\nIt simply means that you\nobserve what's happening.\n\n449\n00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.230\nAnd then, we adapt.\n\n450\n00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:54.190\nSo if the inspection reveals that we're\nnot actually achieving what it is that\n\n451\n00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:58.980\nwe're supposed to achieve,\nthen we adapt to ensure that,\n\n452\n00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.180\nyeah, the end goal is still\ndefinitely being achieved.\n\n453\n00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:10.371\nSo I like to look at some\ncommon myths to do with agile.\n\n454\n00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:14.760\nPeople will tell me all the time, and\nthis is why I sort of mention this,\n\n455\n00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.053\nthat what we looked in the last\nepisode is really about\n\n456\n00:26:18.053 --> 00:26:22.883\nthe fact that we don't need to have any\ndocumentation, and that we don't need\n\n457\n00:26:22.883 --> 00:26:25.510\nto have any structure and\n&gt;&gt; Like it's just\n\n458\n00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:30.520\nfree range,but that's not really the case?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and what I said in the last\n\n459\n00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.790\nepisode was not about the fact that\nwe didn't have any documentation,\n\n460\n00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.310\nit was the fact that we had\nefficient documentation.\n\n461\n00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.290\nIn other words, what's needed,\nnot surplus to requirement.\n\n462\n00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:46.130\nAnd we did have processes, but\nwe had efficient processes, and\n\n463\n00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.800\nwe didn't have a lot of bureaucracy.\n\n464\n00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.770\nAll of these myths that are on\nthe screen in front of you right now.\n\n465\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.410\nThey are just that, myths.\n\n466\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.960\nWe still have structure\nto an agile project.\n\n467\n00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:01.640\nWe talk about the bottom two\nbullet points looks at stories.\n\n468\n00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.190\nAnd we'll look at those\nin another episode.\n\n469\n00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:08.620\nWe do have an episode in\nour series on user stories.\n\n470\n00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:13.990\nAnd a story is really the problem\nthat we are going to resolve by that\n\n471\n00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.610\nparticular iteration,\nby that particular unitive development.\n\n472\n00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.850\nAnd this all user story\nshould be the same size, and\n\n473\n00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.980\nwe should finish it all in\none particular iteration.\n\n474\n00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.350\nThat's not the case.\n\n475\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.380\nWe still want to bring in flexibility.\n\n476\n00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.150\nWe have to have flexibility.\n\n477\n00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.310\nIt's one of the principles.\n\n478\n00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:40.610\nSo we've talked a lot about the difference\nbetween waterfall approaches and\n\n479\n00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:46.450\nagile approaches in a previous episode,\nand in fact, in our introduction.\n\n480\n00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:50.120\nAnd also in the last episode, we looked\nat the difference between the two.\n\n481\n00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.960\nAnd really these slides that you've\ngot in front of you now, and\n\n482\n00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.210\ndon't forget all of this\nis downloadable for you.\n\n483\n00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:00.030\nThese slides just really look\nat the difference between them.\n\n484\n00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.270\nTraditional waterfall, in other words,\nsomething like Prince 2 or PMI,\n\n485\n00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.000\nlook at bringing all of\nthe requirements up front.\n\n486\n00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.160\nAnd all the requirements\nare specified out front.\n\n487\n00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.243\nThe functional, the non-functional,\n\n488\n00:28:12.243 --> 00:28:16.810\nthe usability, all of those requirements\nare specified, and then they are agreed.\n\n489\n00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.373\nAnd this goes back to\nthat casting it in stone.\n\n490\n00:28:20.373 --> 00:28:26.010\nAnd then we go and build, and\nwe design our documentation,\n\n491\n00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:30.665\nand we design all of the specifications.\n\n492\n00:28:30.665 --> 00:28:34.345\nAnd we have accurate designs\nincluding all of our environment.\n\n493\n00:28:35.455 --> 00:28:40.800\nAnd then, then we go and actually do\nthe build which is the implementation.\n\n494\n00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:47.070\nBut just think,\nwe've done all of this work up front, and\n\n495\n00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.470\nwe come up with our requirements, we cast\nthem in stone, and then we design them.\n\n496\n00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.720\nHow long does it take to do that?\n\n497\n00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.950\nIn a traditional project, that in itself\ncould take maybe six months depending on\n\n498\n00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.800\nthe size of the project or by which time\nwho's requirements have probably changed.\n\n499\n00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.470\nSo we have to think about\nthe scale of the project and\n\n500\n00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:12.080\nthink about what the project\nis looking to achieve,\n\n501\n00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.780\nbefore we work out whether we want to use\nthe traditional waterfall approach, or\n\n502\n00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:21.760\nwhether we want to use an agile approach.\n&gt;&gt; So I have a little, I'm just thinking.\n\n503\n00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.045\nSo are project charters even\ninvolved in this process?\n\n504\n00:29:25.045 --> 00:29:27.595\nHave they gone by the wayside?\n\n505\n00:29:27.595 --> 00:29:29.371\n[CROSSTALK] Do I have to wait for\nthat cliffhanger?\n\n506\n00:29:29.371 --> 00:29:31.779\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're gonna have to wait and\n\n507\n00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:33.200\nsee on that one.\n\n508\n00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.321\n[LAUGH] Project charter, that's\nsomething that's terminology that we use\n\n509\n00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:39.780\nspecifically in a waterfall approach.\n\n510\n00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.962\nNow were not saying that the child\nhasn't gone by the wayside.\n\n511\n00:29:42.962 --> 00:29:46.580\nWhat we're saying is that we've got\nanother approach to requirements\n\n512\n00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.872\ndefinition, because we're not looking for\n\n513\n00:29:48.872 --> 00:29:51.540\nrequirements definition for\neverything up front.\n\n514\n00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.210\nAnd that's the difference.\n\n515\n00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.340\nBecause in a waterfall approach,\n\n516\n00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:01.915\nwe do the requirements definition up front\nas it says at the top of that slide, GRUF.\n\n517\n00:30:01.915 --> 00:30:04.890\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's a great acronym\n\n518\n00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.680\nthere [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I didn't think that one up\n\n519\n00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.530\nmyself, I wish I could take credit for it.\n\n520\n00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:13.650\nBut we do the requirements definition\nup front, and then it's cast in stone.\n\n521\n00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.130\nAnd that might work for\nsome implementations.\n\n522\n00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:22.200\nHowever, from an agile perspective,\nyeah, it doesn't work.\n\n523\n00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.010\nWe have to be aware the requirements\nare going to change.\n\n524\n00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.590\nAnd what I wanted yesterday\nmight not be what I want today,\n\n525\n00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.610\nbecause my environment's changed as well.\n\n526\n00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.610\nAnd then with the traditional waterfall,\n\n527\n00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:40.485\nyou'll see that we will be aware\nof all of our testing environment.\n\n528\n00:30:40.485 --> 00:30:44.005\nAnd we will be implementing beta tests,\n\n529\n00:30:44.005 --> 00:30:47.335\nor beta tests, as you might call them.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n530\n00:30:47.335 --> 00:30:48.570\n&gt;&gt; See what I've got there.\n\n531\n00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.205\n[LAUGH] We might be doing that.\n\n532\n00:30:51.205 --> 00:30:53.685\nBut we will do that in\na very formalized way.\n\n533\n00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:56.835\nNow I'm not telling you that agile\ndoesn't test, because we do test.\n\n534\n00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.440\nBut a beta test, or a beta test,\ncould take three months just in itself.\n\n535\n00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.890\nSo we want to test, but we wanna make sure\nthat again that that testing is efficient.\n\n536\n00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.330\nAnd the full solution\nitself is implemented.\n\n537\n00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:16.180\nNow when we implement something huge,\nthat creates a big\n\n538\n00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.440\nimpact on the environment, it creates\na big impact on our organization.\n\n539\n00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.720\nAnd so therefore, the bedding-in\nperiod for that new service and\n\n540\n00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.400\nthat new solution can be quite large.\n\n541\n00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:32.405\nAnd that means the early life support or\nDevOps period, that hand-holding\n\n542\n00:31:32.405 --> 00:31:36.900\nperiod between the project being completed\nand operations taking over support,\n\n543\n00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:41.960\nthat can be extended as well\nin a waterfall environment.\n\n544\n00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.894\nIn an agile environment, because we\nare releasing in an iterative manner, and\n\n545\n00:31:46.894 --> 00:31:50.513\nthen the project team are always\nworking with operation.\n\n546\n00:31:50.513 --> 00:31:55.238\nBut it means that the impact is less\nsevere and by severe I don't mean that in\n\n547\n00:31:55.238 --> 00:31:59.966\na negative way What I mean is that there's\njust not as much being deployed at\n\n548\n00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:03.134\nany one point in time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and by having the, I guess,\n\n549\n00:32:03.134 --> 00:32:07.420\nthe more frequent, like you were talking\nabout, not just once every ten years.\n\n550\n00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.357\nIt's not as invasive or\nalarming if you have the smaller\n\n551\n00:32:11.357 --> 00:32:12.795\nincrements.\n&gt;&gt; Scary,\n\n552\n00:32:12.795 --> 00:32:14.815\nthat’s the word you wanna say.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n553\n00:32:14.815 --> 00:32:15.753\n&gt;&gt; It’s not as scary.\n\n554\n00:32:15.753 --> 00:32:17.067\n&gt;&gt; Not as scary.\n\n555\n00:32:17.067 --> 00:32:18.672\n&gt;&gt; You’ve gotta understand your customer,\n\n556\n00:32:18.672 --> 00:32:20.550\nand some customers just don’t like change.\n\n557\n00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:24.120\nSome customers like stability, if you’re\nworking in a financial institution-\n\n558\n00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.604\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, tell me about it.\n\n559\n00:32:25.604 --> 00:32:26.464\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n560\n00:32:26.464 --> 00:32:30.250\nI’ve done some work with\nfinancial institutions.\n\n561\n00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:34.821\nAnd I can tell you now that when\nyou’re talking about clientele that\n\n562\n00:32:34.821 --> 00:32:37.717\nmaybe haven’t grown up with technology.\n\n563\n00:32:37.717 --> 00:32:40.550\nMaybe because of environment or\nmaybe because of age.\n\n564\n00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.002\n&gt;&gt; Industry requirements\n\n565\n00:32:42.002 --> 00:32:43.878\n&gt;&gt; Right, and then all of a sudden,\n\n566\n00:32:43.878 --> 00:32:48.100\nwe’re bringing out something completely\nnew like contactless payment.\n\n567\n00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.572\nAnd these are people that\nhave never even used a check,\n\n568\n00:32:50.572 --> 00:32:54.860\nthey've always used cash before, and now\nwe're talking about contactless payment.\n\n569\n00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.360\nYou can imagine that that's daunting, and\nso a lot of people don't want to change.\n\n570\n00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.920\nSo the idea is with an agile approach that\n\n571\n00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.970\nyou want to make that as\npainless as possible.\n\n572\n00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:08.236\nSo we introduce certain elements\nat certain points in time.\n\n573\n00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:12.740\nYou see the waterfall approach also, and\nI do like the fact that with the waterfall\n\n574\n00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.410\napproach, we're able to demonstrate\nthat ROI, that return on investment.\n\n575\n00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.700\nAnd we do that right at\nthe very end of the project.\n\n576\n00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.960\nNow that's sometimes a challenge for\n\n577\n00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.200\nan agile approach,\nbecause when do we go and measure?\n\n578\n00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.183\nWhen do we go and do benefits realization,\nwhen do we measure?\n\n579\n00:33:29.183 --> 00:33:32.380\nBecause how do we know when\nthis solution is complete?\n\n580\n00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.000\nAnd how do we then measure\nthe return on that investment?\n\n581\n00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.019\n&gt;&gt; Especially if it's more cyclic, so\n\n582\n00:33:37.019 --> 00:33:39.604\nto speak.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so that's a challenge, for\n\n583\n00:33:39.604 --> 00:33:40.602\nan agile approach,\n\n584\n00:33:40.602 --> 00:33:43.960\nit definitely is a challenge to\nmeasure that return on investment.\n\n585\n00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.630\nAnd of course, with an agile approach\nas well, it can be difficult\n\n586\n00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:55.500\ntoo to maintain service level targets and\nkey performance indicators.\n\n587\n00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.980\nIn a traditional waterfall approach,\nthe solution is implemented,\n\n588\n00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:05.780\nand then we start measuring then\nperformance against service level targets.\n\n589\n00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.220\nAnd then if we need to improve,\nthen we can implement improvements.\n\n590\n00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.250\nBut in an agile approach, you have to\nthink that we are always changing.\n\n591\n00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.860\nSo those service level targets,\n\n592\n00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.760\nthe KPIs could also be\nchanging with every iteration.\n\n593\n00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.796\nSo how then are we able to demonstrate\nwhether we have met our key\n\n594\n00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:30.412\nperformance indicators,\nwhether we are performing as we should do?\n\n595\n00:34:30.412 --> 00:34:34.140\nIt can be incredibly difficult\nin an agile environment.\n\n596\n00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.920\nSo you can see that there are pros and\ncons to both approaches.\n\n597\n00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.836\nAnd we will never try to tell you\nthat agile is better than PRINCE2, or\n\n598\n00:34:40.836 --> 00:34:43.940\nthat PRINCE2 is better than agile,\nfor example.\n\n599\n00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.910\nSo we've looked at the underpinning\n12 principles, and\n\n600\n00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:51.432\nwe looked at the three pillars of agile.\n\n601\n00:34:51.432 --> 00:34:55.535\nAnd we've just looked at sort of\nthe pros and cons of the waterfall and\n\n602\n00:34:55.535 --> 00:34:58.560\nthe agile approaches\nto problem management.\n\n603\n00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.860\nAnd in our next episode,\n\n604\n00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:05.620\nwe're going to look a little bit closer at\nthe various methodologies that fall under\n\n605\n00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.440\nthe banner of agile project management.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, we're gonna be coming back\n\n606\n00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.190\nto debunk one of the myths that you had\ndisplayed on one of those slides there.\n\n607\n00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.640\nYeah, so\nwe'll take a look at those methodologies.\n\n608\n00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.770\nYou don't wanna miss that,\nbut for now, let's sign out.\n\n609\n00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.340\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n610\n00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.117\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n611\n00:35:25.117 --> 00:35:31.020\n[MUSIC]\n\n612\n00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.084\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.449\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:10.500\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome\n\n5\n00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.870\neveryone to your Agile project\nmanagement concept series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.880\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.740\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look at,\nwell, the Agile life cycle.\n\n8\n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.310\nAnd of course, with us today back in\nstudios, we have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.460\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n10\n00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.160\nThank you, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.830\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful.\n\n12\n00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.980\nI managed to make it through the word\nlife cycle without doing this.\n\n13\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n14\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.555\nAnd that's why I was stood here laughing.\n\n15\n00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:41.630\n[LAUGH] I was waiting.\n&gt;&gt; I was trying not to.\n\n16\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.060\nBut no.\nIn all seriousness,\n\n17\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.180\nwe're going to be looking at\nstarting at the beginning and\n\n18\n00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.060\nthen what to expect as we go through\nthis process, but it is, doing it now.\n\n19\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.770\nAll right, yep.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What we are going\n\n20\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.190\nto be looking at in this session.\n\n21\n00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.340\nThis is just a really,\n\n22\n00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.120\nreally brief introduction to\nthe life cycle of the Agile project.\n\n23\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.680\nIn our future episodes we're going to be\nlooking at each stage in more depth and\n\n24\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.190\nwe're going to be looking at activities\nthat occur within each stage of the Agile\n\n25\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.678\nlife cycle or now I'm gonna always\nrefer to it as the life cycle.\n\n26\n00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:13.049\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.570\n&gt;&gt; However at this particular episode\n\n28\n00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.130\nwe're just gonna take a really quick\noverview on the life cycle itself and\n\n29\n00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.880\nwhat activities there\nare in the life cycle.\n\n30\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.490\nSo, in a previous episode,\nCherokee, you mentioned that\n\n31\n00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.260\nthe life cycle of a scrum project,\nor of a project the,\n\n32\n00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.040\nan Agile type project would normally\nbe between sort of one to four weeks.\n\n33\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.410\nAnd yeah, it really depends\non what's being developed\n\n34\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.840\nas to how quick that release\nis actually developed and\n\n35\n00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.960\ndeployed.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n36\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690\n&gt;&gt; And what's inside each\n\n37\n00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.500\niteration as well.\n\n38\n00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.460\nSo let's take a look at\nthe life cycle itself.\n\n39\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.720\nIt can, as I've already said,\n\n40\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.220\nvary in size depending on what\nit is we want to release.\n\n41\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.360\nAnd so you'll see that we start off\nwith envisaging our release plan, and\n\n42\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.440\nthen we move into sort of\nplanning the iteration, and\n\n43\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.540\nthen actually developing that iteration.\n\n44\n00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.080\nAnd during the increment itself,\nthen we're going to have\n\n45\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.630\nstandup meeting that we looked at very,\nvery briefly in a previous episode, and\n\n46\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.000\nthen we're going to have after\nthe face updates as well.\n\n47\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.515\nAnd then once the iteration is\ncomplete and it's ready for\n\n48\n00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:26.760\nrelease then we will release.\n\n49\n00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.180\nAnd then we will review and so\nto make sure that it's going to deliver\n\n50\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.350\nwhat it's suppose to\ndeliver to ensure that\n\n51\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.580\nevery single story that we have put in to\nthat particular iteration is an iteration.\n\n52\n00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.290\nI can't even say the word now.\n\n53\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.890\nSee you've got me tongue tied.\n&gt;&gt; We know what you're talking about.\n\n54\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.683\nIt's because you didn't do some kind\nof hand movement while you're talking.\n\n55\n00:02:47.683 --> 00:02:49.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just not that smooth [LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.720\nThat's all it is.\n\n57\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.490\nAnd then of course it\ndoesn't just end there,\n\n58\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.560\nonce we've delivered the increments,\nand we've done our retrospective,\n\n59\n00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.940\nwe've taken a look back to\nconductor lessons learned exercise,\n\n60\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.090\nthen after that we're going\nto plan our next iteration.\n\n61\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.230\nAnd as you can see every single\niteration will take between one and\n\n62\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.740\nfour weeks depending on the scale\nof what it is that we're deploying.\n\n63\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.570\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting.\n\n64\n00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.470\nI should have Rob from the Dev\nteam come in and explain this,\n\n65\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.370\nbecause I know I'm going to butcher it.\n\n66\n00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.100\nBut it's pretty cool.\n\n67\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.150\nHe explained it once to us, a way\nthat they help identify the length or\n\n68\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.940\nduration of a particular story.\n\n69\n00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.240\nSo for instance, if we were talking about\nimplementing a technology or task or\n\n70\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.210\nwhatever then they basically huddle and\nplay a modified rock,\n\n71\n00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.350\npaper, scissor game,\nthey all at the same time express their,\n\n72\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.945\nthey use little codes for\nhours, or days, or whatever.\n\n73\n00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:54.915\nBut then they would say like,\nI think it's X amount of time.\n\n74\n00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:57.775\nSo, that if they're too far apart,\nlike let's say,\n\n75\n00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:01.905\nI think a test may take two hours,\nand you think it may take two days,\n\n76\n00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:04.815\nthen that would identify an issue,\nand they would need to talk about and\n\n77\n00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:09.375\nsay okay, well, why are our time\nestimates so different here?\n\n78\n00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:11.840\nSo, just kind of like determining.\n\n79\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.580\nI'm sure other companies have\ndifferent methods or ways but\n\n80\n00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.720\nthat's just kind of like a fun little\nthing that they do to help keep on track\n\n81\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.451\nand keep their stories in check.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we will use techniques like that\n\n82\n00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:26.370\nin estimating when we actually\nstart estimating the amount\n\n83\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.850\nof time that is going to be able to take\nto develop a particular resolution to use\n\n84\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.602\na story there will be all sorts\nof methods that are in use.\n\n85\n00:04:34.602 --> 00:04:39.300\nWe've looked in previous\nepisodes at team skills or\n\n86\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.210\nindividual skills and\nshowing that we've got the right spread\n\n87\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.410\nof skills across the team and\nthat the team collaborate.\n\n88\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.020\nAnd it could well be that in an instance\nlike that, we've got that disparity there,\n\n89\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.130\nbecause one person's got\n\n90\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.450\none particular set of skills.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n91\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.040\n&gt;&gt; And somebody else hasn't\n\n92\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.480\ngot those skills, or\nthey've got a different set of skills.\n\n93\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.000\nAnd so, that's why we want\nto work together as a team.\n\n94\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.720\nTraditionally in a waterfall\ntype project we find roles and\n\n95\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.900\nwe'll assign tasks to roles.\n\n96\n00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.210\nAnd it might not necessarily be\nthat level of collaboration.\n\n97\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.070\nAnd there's certainly not that\nlevel of flexibility that allows\n\n98\n00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.890\nyou to turn around to somebody else in\nthe team and say, do you know what?\n\n99\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.100\nI'm working on this bit of code and\nI can't look at this.\n\n100\n00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.190\nI really can't figure it out, so\nit's gonna take me five days to do\n\n101\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.650\nsomething like this or\nfive days to figure it out.\n\n102\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.770\nYou could do it in half an hour.\n\n103\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.900\nCan you do that?\n\n104\n00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.140\nAnd this is why we'll talk about it more\ndetail in different episodes when we look\n\n105\n00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.960\nat the activities we'll talk\nabout our stand-up meetings, but\n\n106\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.910\nthat's exactly why we had\nthose type of meetings.\n\n107\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.330\nSo that we can all get a chance to say,\n\n108\n00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.420\nthis is what I'm working on today and\nI need help.\n\n109\n00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.400\nAnd then someone else could say,\nokay I can help you.\n\n110\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.620\nSo that's exactly why we would do that.\n\n111\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.590\nAnd that's what's different to\nthe Agile approach as opposed to\n\n112\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.330\nthe waterfall approach.\n\n113\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.470\nI know, to the casual observer,\nthat there are some techniques that we're\n\n114\n00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.215\nusing in Agile project management that\nmay seem as though we are playing games,\n\n115\n00:06:09.215 --> 00:06:13.110\n[LAUGH] like rock, paper,\nscissors, or something like that.\n\n116\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.180\nAnd it can seem as though,\nit's just a bit of fun, but\n\n117\n00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.720\nreally it's whatever gets the job done and\nthat will enable us to work together.\n\n118\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.730\nYou know,\nthat sort of exercise builds team morale.\n\n119\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.710\nIt gives everybody a feeling that they're\nequally important to the actual project,\n\n120\n00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.880\nand it actually resolves an issue as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n121\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.490\n&gt;&gt; So it does work.\n\n122\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.890\nWe don't have to do things\nin the conventional.\n\n123\n00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.660\nDidn't wanna use the word strict but we\ndon't have to be so rigid in our approach.\n\n124\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.050\n&gt;&gt; Traditional, yeah, traditional,\n\n125\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.670\ngood words there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we don't wanna be traditional in\n\n126\n00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.450\nthat approach, we wanna ensure that\nwe're getting the best out of people.\n\n127\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.090\nAnd we have to understand that getting the\nbest out of people is not necessarily done\n\n128\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.020\nin a conventional way or in a way where\nwe've got too much bureaucracy or\n\n129\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.705\nit's just heavily sort of processed.\n\n130\n00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:09.985\nShould we say.\n\n131\n00:07:09.985 --> 00:07:13.755\nSo let's take a look at each\none of these steps in sequence.\n\n132\n00:07:13.755 --> 00:07:17.645\nAs I've said we're gonna have\nepisodes where we're going to look\n\n133\n00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:20.965\nvery specifically at the activities\nthat happened with each\n\n134\n00:07:20.965 --> 00:07:23.925\none of these life cycles phases or\neach one of these steps.\n\n135\n00:07:25.315 --> 00:07:29.960\nSo first of all, the first thing that\nwe do is envisioning a release plan and\n\n136\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.960\nthen envisioning the product backlog.\n\n137\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.260\nNow, what that means is what\nis it that we want to achieve?\n\n138\n00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.600\nAnd that's what do we want\nto achieve as a whole?\n\n139\n00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.275\nWhat is the vision for this project,\nbearing in mind that the vision for\n\n140\n00:07:47.275 --> 00:07:53.344\nthe project may not necessarily be\na complete one off delivery of a project.\n\n141\n00:07:53.344 --> 00:07:58.080\nIt might be ongoing,\niterative delivery of a project.\n\n142\n00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.860\nBecause we’re talking about iterative\ndelivery of functionality What I mean by\n\n143\n00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.738\nthat is, in a previous episode I\nmentioned an operating system.\n\n144\n00:08:06.738 --> 00:08:10.695\nAnd we don't just deliver an operating\nsystem as a one-off exercise.\n\n145\n00:08:10.695 --> 00:08:14.379\nWhen we're developing that operating\nsystem we'll say, right, okay,\n\n146\n00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:16.490\nI'm gonna develop the operating system.\n\n147\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.130\nAnd once it's developed, then that's it.\n\n148\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.850\nWe're not going to touch it again.\n\n149\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.730\nAnd it doesn't have a finite lifespan.\n\n150\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.371\nWhat happens when we're developing an\noperating system is that we develop this\n\n151\n00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:31.952\noperating system and then we have another\nincrement of the operating system.\n\n152\n00:08:31.952 --> 00:08:33.954\nAnd then another increment and\n\n153\n00:08:33.954 --> 00:08:38.960\nthen another increment as we continually\nenhancing that operating system.\n\n154\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.040\nSo we have to understand what the\nlong-term vision is of the project itself.\n\n155\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.170\nIs the project to deliver\na one-off product,\n\n156\n00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.210\nor is the project to\ndeliver an ongoing product?\n\n157\n00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.730\nEither way, we're still gonna use\nan agile approach to deliver the product.\n\n158\n00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.519\nSo we're still going to deliver\nthe functionality in increments, but\n\n159\n00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:06.920\nwe still have to work out\nwhat our long-term vision is.\n\n160\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.871\nWe also have to understand our goals, and\nour constraints, and our requirements,\n\n161\n00:09:11.871 --> 00:09:14.186\nand ensure that they are articulated.\n\n162\n00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:18.420\nIt says defined, articulated just simply\nmeans defined and then written down.\n\n163\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.590\nAnd then we identify who\nour stakeholders are.\n\n164\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.570\nAnd we will look at this\nin another episode.\n\n165\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.950\nBut a stakeholder is basically\nanybody that's interested,\n\n166\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.470\nanyone that has an interest or\ncould be impacted by the project or\n\n167\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.970\nthe particular piece of coding, that\niteration that you're planning right now.\n\n168\n00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.680\nSo we identify who our stakeholders are.\n\n169\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.940\nAnd when we're identifying who they are,\nwe've got to identify their level\n\n170\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:52.120\nof interest, their level of\ninvolvement in the actual project.\n\n171\n00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.580\nBecause you see, they may have\nhuge interest in the project, but\n\n172\n00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.490\nthey may have very little involvement.\n\n173\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.980\nSo we have to go and identify that.\n\n174\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.650\nAnd then we move into\nplanning that iteration.\n\n175\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.749\nAnd an iteration, which we saw in\nScrum in the previous episode,\n\n176\n00:10:09.749 --> 00:10:14.234\nthey call it sprint in Scrum,\nit'll ask for between one to four weeks.\n\n177\n00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:18.165\nIt really depends on\nthe scope of the iteration.\n\n178\n00:10:18.165 --> 00:10:23.290\nAn iteration in an agile project should\nnot last for longer than four weeks.\n\n179\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.600\nWe're talking about incremental\ndelivery of functionality.\n\n180\n00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.249\nBut then that doesn't mean\nthat we sort of scrimp and\n\n181\n00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:35.610\nsave when it comes to\nrequirements definition.\n\n182\n00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.865\nWe've still got to be very precise when\nit comes to defining what it is we're\n\n183\n00:10:39.865 --> 00:10:41.240\ndelivering.\n\n184\n00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.440\nAnd we'll talk about user\nstories in another episode.\n\n185\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.150\nBut we do have to know exactly what we're\ndelivering and what problem we're solving.\n\n186\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.210\nPlanning an iteration, as it says,\ninvolves elaborating on the requirements,\n\n187\n00:10:55.210 --> 00:11:00.100\nidentifying what tasks are needed\nwithin that iteration.\n\n188\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.950\nThat iteration being the sprint,\nbeing that portion of work.\n\n189\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.460\nThat's what we're releasing,\nis that portion of work.\n\n190\n00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.450\nWe'll talk about in another episode,\ncuz this is just a taster.\n\n191\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.710\nWe'll talk about the relationships\nbetween iterations and\n\n192\n00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.210\nreleases in another episode.\n\n193\n00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:23.200\nBut once we've decided what it\nis we're going to build and\n\n194\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.880\nwhat it is we're going to deliver,\nthen we start to deliver.\n\n195\n00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.750\nThis is where our development happens.\n\n196\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:35.540\nAnd so every 24 hours,\nwe will have our standup meetings, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.270\nYou might call them your Scrum meetings,\nyou might call them your daily standup.\n\n198\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.520\nWe have talked about this.\n\n199\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.710\nWe have a daily standup meeting\nourselves every morning,\n\n200\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:51.230\nwhere we discuss exactly what everyone\nwithin the team are going to be doing and\n\n201\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.660\nexactly what we're going\nto be recording for a day.\n\n202\n00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.473\nAnd look at, sort of,\nour schedules for that day.\n\n203\n00:11:57.473 --> 00:12:02.412\nAnd sometimes there may be\nthings that might happen during\n\n204\n00:12:02.412 --> 00:12:06.700\nour day where one person\nmight be unavailable.\n\n205\n00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.230\nAnd it's at that point in time where\nsomebody else could say, well, look,\n\n206\n00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.832\nI'm available.\n\n207\n00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:12.840\nI can stand in, I can do this for you.\n\n208\n00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.547\nAnd so this is what a standup\nmeeting really does.\n\n209\n00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:20.779\nIt allows us to identify any challenges,\nto outline what\n\n210\n00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:26.889\nwe're going to be doing for\nthat day and also to identify any help.\n\n211\n00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:30.960\n[LAUGH] Because sometimes we\nall need a little bit of help.\n\n212\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.600\n&gt;&gt; This is true, and\n\n213\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.780\nespecially if it's something\nthat someone's already done,\n\n214\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.750\nespecially if they have\nthat prior knowledge.\n\n215\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.945\nAnd then they can just bring that\nknowledge to the table to make your life\n\n216\n00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:42.162\na little bit easier.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so every 24 hours you'll\n\n217\n00:12:42.162 --> 00:12:47.076\nsee, and we should really have some arrows\nin that graphic there, because every 24\n\n218\n00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:51.733\nhours, what we're doing is we have our\nstandup meetings at the start of the day.\n\n219\n00:12:51.733 --> 00:12:55.039\nAnd then we want to update\nwhere we've got so far,\n\n220\n00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:57.736\nand then we want to develop the product.\n\n221\n00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.745\nThen we tell everybody the next\nday how far we've got.\n\n222\n00:13:00.745 --> 00:13:04.970\nAnd then we update all of our,\nwe call them our artifacts, but\n\n223\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.663\nwe want to keep all of our boards, etc.\n\n224\n00:13:07.663 --> 00:13:11.875\nWe wanna make sure that our backlogs\nare kept updated with our progress.\n\n225\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.980\nThen after we've developed, then,\nwell, we want to review the increment.\n\n226\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.940\nAnd review the increment means just\n\n227\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:27.290\nevaluating as to whether that increment\nactually resolves the user story.\n\n228\n00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.470\nDoes it do what it was supposed to do?\n\n229\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.866\nAnd then we also conduct what\nwe call a retrospective.\n\n230\n00:13:33.866 --> 00:13:36.419\nAnd the retrospective is our\nlessons learned exercise.\n\n231\n00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:39.582\nWhat did we do well,\ngiven that we've only been at this for\n\n232\n00:13:39.582 --> 00:13:42.860\nmaybe a week or maybe four weeks,\nwhat did we do well?\n\n233\n00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.220\nWhat did we not do so well?\n\n234\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.780\nAnd it's at this point in time\nwhere I expect things like\n\n235\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.110\ninefficiencies to be highlighted.\n\n236\n00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.690\nI expect people to say,\nwell, you know what?\n\n237\n00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.933\nIf I'd listened to Cherokee\nin the first place,\n\n238\n00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:57.460\nthen maybe I wouldn't be in\nthis situation right now.\n\n239\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.120\nMaybe things wouldn't have been delayed.\n\n240\n00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.100\nAnd at the end of that,\nthen a working product is then available.\n\n241\n00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:14.820\nNow, there's a word in there which is\nreally important, and that's the word may.\n\n242\n00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.600\nThe iteration may be\nreleased to the customer.\n\n243\n00:14:20.448 --> 00:14:24.590\nIn that left-hand corner,\nyou'll see it says deliver increments, and\n\n244\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.820\nthen we've got numbers one,\ntwo, and three.\n\n245\n00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.210\nAnd then we've got the word\nrelease underneath.\n\n246\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:36.055\nYou may choose not to release every\nsingle increment in isolation.\n\n247\n00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:40.782\nThink about this for a moment.\n\n248\n00:14:40.782 --> 00:14:45.189\nHow often does your operating system get\n\n249\n00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:49.810\nupdated on your cellphone?\n&gt;&gt; We talked about this earlier.\n\n250\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.530\nI think it's pretty frequent.\n\n251\n00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.450\nSo you said about a month.\n\n252\n00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.019\nI'd say something similar to that,\nmonth, month and a half,\n\n253\n00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:59.577\nsomewhere around there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and how happy are you with\n\n254\n00:14:59.577 --> 00:15:05.642\nthe frequency of those releases?\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's relative,\n\n255\n00:15:05.642 --> 00:15:11.062\nbecause am I happy that my information\nis spread across the Internet\n\n256\n00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:15.637\nbecause they're updating\nsecurity vulnerabilities?\n\n257\n00:15:15.637 --> 00:15:17.800\nThen, yes.\n\n258\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.100\nAm I inconvenienced?\n\n259\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.870\nYes, but it's not life changing.\n&gt;&gt; There\n\n260\n00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.760\nhas to be a balance.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n261\n00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.090\n&gt;&gt; There has to be, and\n\n262\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.476\nthis is where development teams and\nproject teams have to be very,\n\n263\n00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:33.921\nvery aware of who their customer is.\n\n264\n00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:36.430\nCuz there has to be a balance.\n\n265\n00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:41.700\nIf you're releasing every week,\nit's gonna cause instability.\n\n266\n00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.507\nAnd not just instability\nwithin your own environment,\n\n267\n00:15:45.507 --> 00:15:49.345\nit's also going to cause some very-\n&gt;&gt; Unhappy?\n\n268\n00:15:49.345 --> 00:15:53.072\nI'm thinking of the politically\ncorrect word to say here, but\n\n269\n00:15:53.072 --> 00:15:54.780\nthey're gonna be unhappy.\n\n270\n00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.760\nCustomers don't want to be interrupted.\n&gt;&gt; Loss of reputation, there we go.\n\n271\n00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.246\n&gt;&gt; Right, loss of credibility,\n\n272\n00:16:00.246 --> 00:16:01.279\nloss of reputation.\n\n273\n00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:05.899\nCustomers don't want to be\ninterrupted every couple of hours, or\n\n274\n00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:09.620\nevery couple of days, or\neven maybe every week or so.\n\n275\n00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.900\nSo we have to get the balance right\nbetween maintaining stability but\n\n276\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:19.086\nalso being responsive to changing factors\nand being responsive to requirements.\n\n277\n00:16:19.086 --> 00:16:21.223\nAnd we've got to deliver requirements.\n\n278\n00:16:21.223 --> 00:16:25.230\nWe've also got to deliver, you mentioned\nsecurity patches and security updates.\n\n279\n00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.600\nWe've still gotta be\nable to deliver those.\n\n280\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.540\nSo what we may choose to do is we may\nchoose to bundle together increments.\n\n281\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.300\nSo we may choose to have\na release schedule that, say,\n\n282\n00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.990\nreleases every four weeks, or\nreleases every three weeks.\n\n283\n00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.151\nBut understanding that\non the odd exception,\n\n284\n00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:44.743\nwhen there has been security issues,\n\n285\n00:16:44.743 --> 00:16:50.104\nthat we may need to release an increment\noutside of those scheduled releases.\n\n286\n00:16:50.104 --> 00:16:53.471\nAnd that would be our hot fixes or, yeah.\n\n287\n00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:56.577\nAnd then just with like our features,\nusually,\n\n288\n00:16:56.577 --> 00:16:59.848\nthen that would be on\nthe normal release schedule.\n\n289\n00:16:59.848 --> 00:17:04.179\nBut then any kind of immediate security\nvulnerability would require that immediate\n\n290\n00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:06.990\nattention with that hot fix.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n291\n00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:11.023\nSo there's no right or\nwrong when it comes to when to release and\n\n292\n00:17:11.023 --> 00:17:14.675\nwhen it comes to how many\nincrements to have in a release,\n\n293\n00:17:14.675 --> 00:17:19.505\nother than get to know your customer and\nknow what your customer wants.\n\n294\n00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:25.300\nThe other thing that I would say to\nyou is you have got a major increment,\n\n295\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.280\nif you have got some\nmajor functionality that\n\n296\n00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.170\nreally is going to cause some disruption,\npositive disruption,\n\n297\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.010\nyou'd like to hope, but is going to have\nan impact in the customer environment,\n\n298\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.640\nyou may choose to release\nthat separately as well.\n\n299\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.770\nYou don't necessarily want it bundled\nin with lots of other increments too.\n\n300\n00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:48.460\nSo get to know your customer and\nget to know what they would prefer, and\n\n301\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.260\nthink also, though,\nabout the stability of your environment.\n\n302\n00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:56.960\nBut then it doesn't just stop there,\nit's not just the one-off exercise.\n\n303\n00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.408\nAnd this is where it talks\nabout iterative development,\n\n304\n00:18:00.408 --> 00:18:06.550\nbecause you'll notice that\nthese wheels keep turning.\n\n305\n00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:10.240\nAfter the iteration review and\nretrospective, we go back and\n\n306\n00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.180\nwe start planning our next iteration.\n\n307\n00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.070\nSo we develop our products in increments,\n\n308\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:21.068\nunderstanding that our products may\nnot just be a one-off exercise.\n\n309\n00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.048\nIf we were to take into\nconsideration lean principles and\n\n310\n00:18:27.048 --> 00:18:32.215\nlean principles talk about minimal waste,\nthen with every single cycle,\n\n311\n00:18:32.215 --> 00:18:36.088\nas we release an increment,\nwe become more efficient.\n\n312\n00:18:36.088 --> 00:18:39.029\nBecause we conduct those\nretrospectives and\n\n313\n00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:43.825\nwe conduct our lessons learned, and\nthen we learn about efficiencies and\n\n314\n00:18:43.825 --> 00:18:46.932\nwe learn about how we can\nbe more effectivness.\n\n315\n00:18:46.932 --> 00:18:49.073\nAnd we also enhanced our skills, as well,\n\n316\n00:18:49.073 --> 00:18:51.580\nbecause we have collaboration\nacross our teams.\n\n317\n00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.350\nSo Agile provides for\niterative development.\n\n318\n00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.830\nIt provides for learning.\n\n319\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:05.340\nIt gives us an environment where\nwe can introduce functionality,\n\n320\n00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.820\nstill in a controlled manner, but\n\n321\n00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:13.152\nalso at a frequency where our customers\nare happy with our development.\n\n322\n00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:18.000\nAnd they're happy with our responsiveness\nto their environment into their\n\n323\n00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.570\nrequirements.\n\n324\n00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:25.830\nSo that's it for\nour quick delve into the Agile life cycle.\n\n325\n00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.330\nNow, in future episodes, we're actually\ngoing to be looking at all of those\n\n326\n00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.040\nactivities that we've just\ndiscussed in a lot more depth.\n\n327\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.200\nBut for now, for our next episode we're\ngoing to be taking a quick look into\n\n328\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.110\nthe roles that we have within an Agile\nenvironment and we'll hopefully see\n\n329\n00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.220\nyou in our next episode.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Jo,\n\n330\n00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.740\nI'm just super excited that now instead\nof going to my afternoon meeting,\n\n331\n00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.700\nI can inform everyone that we\nare going to have an artifact update.\n\n332\n00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.870\nSo instead of giving my show count today,\nhow many shows I recorded,\n\n333\n00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:01.680\nI can say, my artifact update is, artifact\nupdate, if I can say that properly,\n\n334\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.670\nis blah, blah, blah.\n\n335\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.770\nSo, pretty cool, thank you for\nthat information.\n\n336\n00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.146\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\nbut we are out of time for this show, so\n\n337\n00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:10.020\nwe'll sign out.\n\n338\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.605\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n339\n00:20:12.605 --> 00:20:15.089\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n340\n00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:21.266\n[MUSIC]\n\n341\n00:20:21.266 --> 00:20:24.354\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:07.390\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.014\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your\n\n6\n00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:15.221\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:17.121\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:20.618\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be taking a look at Agile roles.\n\n9\n00:00:20.618 --> 00:00:25.120\nAnd of course, with us today to explain\nthose roles, we have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.690\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.090\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm good but\n\n12\n00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.780\nI'm not really sure about my\nrole in this whole show thing.\n\n13\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.320\nSo you're gonna have to\nhelp me out with that\n\n14\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.202\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n15\n00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:36.651\nI think you're gonna have to\nfigure it out as we go along.\n\n16\n00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:39.432\nI think that's the best option.\n&gt;&gt; But you are the scrum master,\n\n17\n00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:42.405\nright?\n&gt;&gt; No, not really, no.\n\n18\n00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:45.264\nCuz there is somethings\nthat are just beyond hope.\n\n19\n00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:47.810\n&gt;&gt; So maybe we can send some light on\n\n20\n00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.432\nthe roles.\n\n21\n00:00:48.432 --> 00:00:51.909\nWhat a scrum master is and what they\nshould and should not be doing and\n\n22\n00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.560\nI'll let you decide.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think we should probably start\n\n23\n00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.200\noff by telling them that we're\nlooking at Agile projects right now.\n\n24\n00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.430\nAnd we've been in previous episodes\nlooking at Agile methodologies.\n\n25\n00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.419\nAnd we've taken a very, very,\n\n26\n00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:12.220\nvery high level look at the activities\nthat are involved in an Agile project.\n\n27\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.220\nAnd of course, we've looked at the\nprinciples of an Agile project as well.\n\n28\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.550\nAnd so in this particular episode,\nas Cherokee says,\n\n29\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.090\nwe're going to look at the roles\nthat there are in Agile.\n\n30\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.720\nAnd I'm gonna be perfectly\nhonest with you.\n\n31\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.440\nThere aren't many specific\nroles within an Agile project.\n\n32\n00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.970\nThere aren't many defined roles.\n\n33\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.480\nWhat we do have though, is we do have,\nwell, four roles that we've got defined.\n\n34\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.770\nAnd it says here these are common roles.\n\n35\n00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.395\nAnd in fact you'll see one of them,\ncertainly the role of a scrum master,\n\n36\n00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:50.350\nis well, we've seen that before.\n\n37\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.590\nWe've seen that in scrum.\n\n38\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.800\nAnd scrum is a methodology that these\nadhering to the Agile principles,\n\n39\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.530\nso we consider that to\nbe an Agile methodology.\n\n40\n00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.890\nAnd it says in that bottom bullet point\nthat the roles may vary depending on\n\n41\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.020\nthe methodology that we used.\n\n42\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.290\nBut for the most part, certainly the roles\nof scrum master and the roles of product\n\n43\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.020\nowner are roles that appear in most Agile\nprojects, whether they're scrum or not.\n\n44\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.760\nWe tend to refer a lot\nto the scrum master.\n\n45\n00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.400\nSo let's knock off two of these,\nreally easy, right now and\n\n46\n00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.770\nthen we'll take a look at the other two.\n\n47\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.550\nSo we take a look at the team member.\n\n48\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.750\nAnd the team member, well,\n\n49\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.890\nas it says performs the daily\nwork of building the solution.\n\n50\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.260\nThese are our developers,\nthese are our programmers.\n\n51\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.420\nThese are the people that\nare actually doing the coding.\n\n52\n00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.290\nAnd these are the people that are,\nwell, at the call face as it were.\n\n53\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.040\nSo these are the people that are going\nto help us plan our iteration.\n\n54\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.090\nThese are the people that are going to\nhelp us prioritize the user stories that\n\n55\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.600\nare in our iteration.\n\n56\n00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.370\nAnd these are the people that\nare actually going to delivery the work.\n\n57\n00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.860\nAnd then they're going to be\nconducting the reviews and\n\n58\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.380\nthe retrospectives as well afterwards.\n\n59\n00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.490\nAnd of course I expect\nall of these people,\n\n60\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.350\nall of them, to be present in\nthe daily standup meeting.\n\n61\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.470\nAnd it's really important that, and\n\n62\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.310\nI put emphasis on all of them being\npresent at the daily standup.\n\n63\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.510\nIt's really important that all of them\nare present at the daily standup.\n\n64\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.780\nBecause the daily standup meeting,\nor the scrum meeting.\n\n65\n00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.040\nWhatever you want to call it depending\non what methodology you're using.\n\n66\n00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.830\nThat's the opportunity for everybody\nto outline what their role is for\n\n67\n00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.750\nthat particular day.\n\n68\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.580\nAnd some days,\nmy role might be as a developer.\n\n69\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.390\nBut other days my role might as a tester,\nfor instance.\n\n70\n00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.960\nOther days I might me an estimator.\n\n71\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.270\nSo it's really important that\nwe have that daily meeting so\n\n72\n00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.700\nthat we can identify who's\ndoing what on any given day.\n\n73\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.150\nAnd that if there are any gaps in our\ntasks, in other words, that we've\n\n74\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.910\ngot people with different skills that\naren't quite able to do certain tasks.\n\n75\n00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.380\nThen somebody else can step in.\n\n76\n00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.840\nSo it's very important that all of our\nteam members are in place at our team\n\n77\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.470\nmeetings, at our daily standups.\n\n78\n00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.664\nWe also have, and it's the second one\ndown on that particular list there,\n\n79\n00:04:16.664 --> 00:04:18.573\nthe role of an Agile coach.\n\n80\n00:04:18.573 --> 00:04:22.995\nThe role of an Agile coach\nis quite an unusual one,\n\n81\n00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:30.490\ninasmuch as it's something that we will\ngenerally not utilize, and yet we should.\n\n82\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.920\nAnd that really is the person\nwho will come in and\n\n83\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.220\nwill guide the team, and\nguide maybe the scrum master and\n\n84\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.580\nthe product owner,\nthrough what they should be doing.\n\n85\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.650\nAnd through roles and\n\n86\n00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.490\nresponsibilities and maybe would provide\nadvice on who should take charge of what.\n\n87\n00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.210\nLet's be honest, there are quite often,\nwithin any team,\n\n88\n00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.940\nthere's quite often sort\nof contentious times.\n\n89\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.760\nWhen we don't always agree when\nwe're working within a team.\n\n90\n00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.600\nAnd it's the Agile coach that\nwill come in and will say, right.\n\n91\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.970\nWell as far as Agile is concerned,\n\n92\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.870\nthis would be the most efficient\nway to work with that.\n\n93\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.970\nAnd as far as Agile\nmethodologies are concerned,\n\n94\n00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.990\nthis is where we should put this.\n\n95\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.990\nSo we should have a board and we should\nput everything on this particular board\n\n96\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.350\naccording to whatever methodology\nit is that you're using.\n\n97\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.130\nSo the role of the Agile coach\nshouldn't actually be underestimated.\n\n98\n00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.980\nThere should be somebody\nwithin that development team,\n\n99\n00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.830\nwho is fully aware of Agile methodologies.\n\n100\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.238\nIt's really easy as a team member to\nwalk into an Agile project team and\n\n101\n00:05:38.238 --> 00:05:43.750\nnot actually realize that you're\nworking to a specific methodology.\n\n102\n00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.090\nOr not actually realize that you're\nworking as a part of an Agile team.\n\n103\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.850\nYou may just think,\n\n104\n00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.710\nwell that's the way the team works and-\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n105\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.360\nthat's exactly what happened to\nme when I started working here.\n\n106\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.780\nI wasn't like, hey, during orientation.\n\n107\n00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.580\nAnd we're Agile, and\nthis is what we're gonna do.\n\n108\n00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.652\nIt just kind of happened natively, or\n\n109\n00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:02.876\nnaturally.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n110\n00:06:02.876 --> 00:06:04.760\nI wonder how many people have walked in.\n\n111\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.860\nAnd we have daily standups ourselves\nwhere we will do exactly that.\n\n112\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.433\nThe 15 minutes where we all stand around\nand discuss what we're going to do for\n\n113\n00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:14.350\nthe rest of the day.\n\n114\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.840\nWe go around the group.\n\n115\n00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.959\nAnd I wonder how many people realize that\nthat's actually got something to do with\n\n116\n00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:22.130\nAgile and what the purpose is.\n\n117\n00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.590\nAnd I'm sure that, unless it's explained\nto you, I'm sure that there are probably\n\n118\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.380\npeople who probably don't\nwant to admit it as well.\n\n119\n00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.099\nBut they're probably people within our\norganization who wonder why they're doing\n\n120\n00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:35.445\nit and\nthink of it as being a bit of a pain.\n\n121\n00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:39.400\n[LAUGH] A little bit of a chore and\nfairly cumbersome, and\n\n122\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.770\nthat's the purpose behind it.\n\n123\n00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.201\nAnd when you understand\nthe purpose it all makes sense.\n\n124\n00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:45.710\nAnd that's what the Agile\ncoach is there for.\n\n125\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.700\nIt doesn't have to be somebody external.\n\n126\n00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.260\nIt doesn't have to be a consultant.\n\n127\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.550\nIt doesn't have to be a trainer.\n\n128\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.520\nIt doesn't have to be somebody like me,\nthat walks in and\n\n129\n00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.840\nthen oversees everybody to make sure\neverybody's doing the right thing.\n\n130\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.770\nDid you have a,\nyou put your hand up there.\n\n131\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.010\n&gt;&gt; I did, I was like, hold on.\n\n132\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.560\nNo, because when you said that\nit made sense because, so\n\n133\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.660\nwe do surveys from the employees.\n\n134\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.250\nAnd one of the comments on one\nof the employee surveys was\n\n135\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.490\nwhy do we have this long\nmeeting in the morning?\n\n136\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.190\nAnd I think that at that point in time,\nand this was a while back, but\n\n137\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.932\nit brought to the forefront\nthe need of that explanation.\n\n138\n00:07:22.932 --> 00:07:27.200\nSo that's something that we do do talk\nabout often as we're onboarding new\n\n139\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.980\npeople at this point in time.\n\n140\n00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.360\nBecause it is a question that\nsomeone may genuinely have.\n\n141\n00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.060\nWhy are we doing this?\n\n142\n00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.615\nRight, and that's exactly why you need\nsomebody who is willing to step up and\n\n143\n00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:39.749\nbe an Agile coach.\n\n144\n00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:43.032\nYou see, what we don't want to do, and\nwe're going to get into the roles of\n\n145\n00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:45.810\nscrum master, product owner and\nproduct manager in a moment.\n\n146\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.350\nBut what we don't want to do is we don't\nwant to distract the scrum master and\n\n147\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.070\nthe product owner from their work.\n\n148\n00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.343\nAnd this is why the Agile\ncoach would get involved and\n\n149\n00:07:54.343 --> 00:07:57.457\nwould actually sit down with that\nperson and say this is the reason why.\n\n150\n00:07:57.457 --> 00:08:01.154\nOr maybe the Agile coach\nwill be somebody who before,\n\n151\n00:08:01.154 --> 00:08:05.674\nin orientation for instance Before\nwe start work on any project,\n\n152\n00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:10.792\nwe'll explain all of the concepts of\nthat project and that methodology.\n\n153\n00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:14.027\nIt doesn't have to be\nsomething that's complex, and\n\n154\n00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:16.711\nit doesn't have to be\nvia a formal training.\n\n155\n00:08:16.711 --> 00:08:21.050\nIt could be just simply a sit down,\nthis is how we work.\n\n156\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.428\nSo we've also got another two roles,\nand I haven't ignored them.\n\n157\n00:08:24.428 --> 00:08:28.341\nAnd these are the roles of product\nowner and the role of scrum master.\n\n158\n00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:32.474\nAnd so let's just take a look\nat the role of product owner.\n\n159\n00:08:32.474 --> 00:08:37.613\nNow the responsibilities,\neven though in an agile project\n\n160\n00:08:37.613 --> 00:08:42.546\nwe will say that we don't\nhave rigid responsibilities,\n\n161\n00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:46.451\nwe don't have rigid roles, nevertheless,\n\n162\n00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:51.588\nwe still have to understand that\nthe role of scrum master and\n\n163\n00:08:51.588 --> 00:08:56.964\nthe role of product owner do\nhave defined responsibilities.\n\n164\n00:08:56.964 --> 00:09:01.674\nI want you to think of the product\nowner as being the person that takes\n\n165\n00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:06.648\nownership and takes accountability for\nthe technical side of things.\n\n166\n00:09:06.648 --> 00:09:08.707\nSo they take accountability for\n\n167\n00:09:08.707 --> 00:09:13.420\nensuring that the requirements\nmeet the business needs.\n\n168\n00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.766\nThey take accountability for\nall of the coding.\n\n169\n00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:22.841\nThey define what the prioritization\nis on the use of stories,\n\n170\n00:09:22.841 --> 00:09:26.560\nand they define the product\nbacklog itself.\n\n171\n00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.090\nSo they look at the functionality\nthat's required by the business, and\n\n172\n00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.496\nthey work with a team on functionality.\n\n173\n00:09:34.496 --> 00:09:38.560\nSo if you've got any technical queries,\nyou go to the product owner.\n\n174\n00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:45.040\nIf you've got any queries concerning\nthe requirements and whether a particular\n\n175\n00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.103\npiece of coding will meet requirements,\nthen you go to the product owner.\n\n176\n00:09:50.103 --> 00:09:52.419\nAnd the product owner owns the product,\n\n177\n00:09:52.419 --> 00:09:55.702\nthat's why they're called\na product owner obviously.\n\n178\n00:09:55.702 --> 00:09:57.142\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n179\n00:09:57.142 --> 00:09:58.047\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n180\n00:09:58.047 --> 00:10:01.101\nI just said that and I suddenly thought,\nthat sounds ridiculous.\n\n181\n00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:04.804\nBut yeah, that's why they're called that,\nthey own the product.\n\n182\n00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:11.097\nSo they own the functionality, and they\nwill make decisions on the functionality.\n\n183\n00:10:11.097 --> 00:10:13.741\nThey define what the team works on next,\nbut\n\n184\n00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:17.178\nthey actually make the decisions\non the functionality.\n\n185\n00:10:17.178 --> 00:10:20.646\nAnd then we have the scrum master.\n\n186\n00:10:20.646 --> 00:10:25.559\nThe scrum master, I love that bottom\nbullet point, the enforcer of rules.\n\n187\n00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:28.473\nNo, they do not stand there\nwith a baseball bat, all right?\n\n188\n00:10:28.473 --> 00:10:30.876\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] As much as you probably would\n\n189\n00:10:30.876 --> 00:10:32.687\nlike that, but-\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.\n\n190\n00:10:32.687 --> 00:10:34.843\nI mean from a sadistic perspective,\nyeah, probably.\n\n191\n00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:35.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No,\n\n192\n00:10:35.554 --> 00:10:39.644\nI'm just joking with you, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, I mean as a scrum master,\n\n193\n00:10:39.644 --> 00:10:43.708\nyeah, I'd love to have that power,\nbut no, that's not what they do.\n\n194\n00:10:43.708 --> 00:10:49.528\nAll right, the enforcer of rules\nmeans that, I mean, bear it in mind,\n\n195\n00:10:49.528 --> 00:10:56.124\nwe don't have the huge defined processes\nthat may exist in a waterfall project,\n\n196\n00:10:56.124 --> 00:10:59.810\nso these guys,\nthese people are the people or\n\n197\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.890\nthe person that ensures\nthat the team is working.\n\n198\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.175\nSo ensures collaboration,\ngets the team working together.\n\n199\n00:11:08.175 --> 00:11:11.388\nI think in a previous episode,\nwe talked about what if you and\n\n200\n00:11:11.388 --> 00:11:12.968\nI weren't seeing eye to eye.\n\n201\n00:11:12.968 --> 00:11:14.508\nWho would resolve that?\n\n202\n00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:16.920\nIt's the scrum master\nthat would resolve that.\n\n203\n00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.786\nIf you and\nI couldn't agree on our responsibilities,\n\n204\n00:11:19.786 --> 00:11:22.101\nit's the scrum master that resolves that.\n\n205\n00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:24.388\nSo let me ask you a question then.\n\n206\n00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:27.976\nLet's say that you and I were developers.\n\n207\n00:11:27.976 --> 00:11:32.106\nI can dream, but anyway, [LAUGH]\nlet's say that we were developers and\n\n208\n00:11:32.106 --> 00:11:33.928\nwe were developing a product.\n\n209\n00:11:33.928 --> 00:11:36.016\nAnd we couldn't agree on functionality.\n\n210\n00:11:36.016 --> 00:11:39.913\nI wanted to do it one way, and\nyou wanted to do it another way.\n\n211\n00:11:39.913 --> 00:11:40.865\nWho would we go to?\n\n212\n00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:45.475\nWho would decide what to do?\n&gt;&gt; Our mommy.\n\n213\n00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:46.876\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:11:46.876 --> 00:11:50.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, Jo, our scrum master.\n\n215\n00:11:50.103 --> 00:11:50.812\nI had to say that.\n\n216\n00:11:50.812 --> 00:11:54.912\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so somebody not only needs mommy,\n\n217\n00:11:54.912 --> 00:11:59.090\nbut somebody hasn't been paying attention.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.240\n&gt;&gt; Because what I asked you was, and\n\n219\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.473\nthis is where we've gotta\nget responsibilities right.\n\n220\n00:12:02.473 --> 00:12:05.847\n&gt;&gt; Not to bother our scrum master.\n\n221\n00:12:05.847 --> 00:12:07.495\n&gt;&gt; Did I say not to bother our scrum\n\n222\n00:12:07.495 --> 00:12:08.006\nmaster?\n\n223\n00:12:08.006 --> 00:12:12.534\nNo, what I said was our product\nowner owns the product, and\n\n224\n00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:15.896\nthey make decisions to\ndo with the product.\n\n225\n00:12:15.896 --> 00:12:18.601\nSo it's the product owner\nthat would resolve that.\n\n226\n00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:19.472\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n227\n00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.989\n&gt;&gt; Now the scrum master would resolve any\n\n228\n00:12:20.989 --> 00:12:24.183\ninterpersonal issues that you have.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks for\n\n229\n00:12:24.183 --> 00:12:27.981\nclarifying because okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n230\n00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:29.746\n&gt;&gt; I got it.\n\n231\n00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:31.858\n&gt;&gt; So the scrum master is responsible for\n\n232\n00:12:31.858 --> 00:12:35.818\nthe fact that I have threatened to\ntake you outside with a baseball bat,\n\n233\n00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:36.476\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:12:36.476 --> 00:12:37.611\n&gt;&gt; Because you clearly weren't\n\n235\n00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:38.384\npaying attention.\n\n236\n00:12:38.384 --> 00:12:40.961\n[LAUGH] That's the scrum master.\n\n237\n00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:44.336\nBut the product owner is the person\nthat will make the decision to do with\n\n238\n00:12:44.336 --> 00:12:45.356\nthe functionality.\n\n239\n00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:48.500\nSo if you and\nI had a disagreement on functionality,\n\n240\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.787\non which way to do the development, or\n\n241\n00:12:50.787 --> 00:12:55.575\non what the output of the development\nshould look like, it's the product owner\n\n242\n00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:58.971\nthat makes that decision.\n&gt;&gt; Would the agile coach ever\n\n243\n00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:03.923\nstep in in this type of situation?\n&gt;&gt; The agile coach might advise.\n\n244\n00:13:03.923 --> 00:13:08.050\nI mean, the agile coach may pull the scrum\nmaster and the product owner aside and\n\n245\n00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.270\nsay, you've got to decide on this.\n\n246\n00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.210\nAnd if I were the agile coach\nin that particular instance,\n\n247\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.450\nI would go back to the product owner and\nI would simply say right,\n\n248\n00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.270\nyou've gotta make the decision\non functionality, but\n\n249\n00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.312\nyou need to sort them two out-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n250\n00:13:21.312 --> 00:13:22.430\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they keep arguing.\n\n251\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.691\n[LAUGH] All right, so the agile coach\nmight advise in that respect, but\n\n252\n00:13:26.691 --> 00:13:28.219\nnothing more than that.\n\n253\n00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:30.959\nThe agile coach is not\ngoing to get involved.\n\n254\n00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:35.595\nThey're just going to sort of we\nwant the team to work efficiently.\n\n255\n00:13:35.595 --> 00:13:40.347\nAnd so what they're gonna do is\nreally just give the managers\n\n256\n00:13:40.347 --> 00:13:45.016\nthe tools with which to ensure\nthe team works efficiently.\n\n257\n00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:50.360\nSo the scrum master is the person that, it\nsays removes impediments to the backlog.\n\n258\n00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:57.259\nSo if the scrum master sees any potential\nconflict or sees any potential obstacles,\n\n259\n00:13:57.259 --> 00:14:03.101\nit's the scrum master's responsibility\nto remove those obstacles.\n\n260\n00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:06.462\nNow they may well be technical obstacles,\nin which case,\n\n261\n00:14:06.462 --> 00:14:10.030\nthen the scrum master may\nrefer to the product owner.\n\n262\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.261\nBut remember, the product owner is\nresponsible for the technical aspect.\n\n263\n00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:17.853\nThe scrum master is also responsible for\ncommunication.\n\n264\n00:14:17.853 --> 00:14:21.929\nAnd in a previous episode,\nwe looked at communication as being in\n\n265\n00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:25.498\nthe language of whoever it\nis you're communicating to.\n\n266\n00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:29.338\nSo the scrum master's role is to\nensure that if we're communicating to\n\n267\n00:14:29.338 --> 00:14:32.602\nthe customers,\nwe're communicating in their language and\n\n268\n00:14:32.602 --> 00:14:35.355\nthat we're communicating\nwhat they need to hear.\n\n269\n00:14:35.355 --> 00:14:39.117\nWith any communication, the recipient\nalways wants to answer the question,\n\n270\n00:14:39.117 --> 00:14:40.145\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n271\n00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:42.460\nAnd that's that the scrum\nmaster's got to be able to do.\n\n272\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.806\nAnd so when the scrum master is the person\nthat is managing the team as it were,\n\n273\n00:14:47.806 --> 00:14:52.593\nthen the scrum master needs to\ncommunicate in the team's language.\n\n274\n00:14:52.593 --> 00:14:53.963\nSo who do you think then,\n\n275\n00:14:53.963 --> 00:14:56.223\nhere's a question.\n&gt;&gt; Gosh.\n\n276\n00:14:56.223 --> 00:15:01.243\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who do you think that drives or\n\n277\n00:15:01.243 --> 00:15:06.312\nensures that the daily stand\nup meeting runs on time?\n\n278\n00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:10.467\nI love these trick questions.\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm so nervous now.\n\n279\n00:15:10.467 --> 00:15:12.475\nI don't know what to say.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] in the episode, right?\n\n280\n00:15:12.475 --> 00:15:16.051\n[LAUGH] I wanna say scrum master.\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n281\n00:15:16.051 --> 00:15:17.548\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n282\n00:15:17.548 --> 00:15:18.917\n&gt;&gt; Because it's to do [LAUGH] with\n\n283\n00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:20.346\nthe facilitation of the team.\n\n284\n00:15:20.346 --> 00:15:22.692\nAnd it's to do with\nthe efficiency of the team.\n\n285\n00:15:22.692 --> 00:15:24.642\nSo yes,\nit's the scrum master that would do that.\n\n286\n00:15:24.642 --> 00:15:26.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n287\n00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so product owner just remember,\n\n288\n00:15:28.244 --> 00:15:30.776\nproduct owner takes accountability for\nthe functional side of things.\n\n289\n00:15:30.776 --> 00:15:35.796\nAnd the scrum master takes accountability\nfor the actual efficiency of the team.\n\n290\n00:15:35.796 --> 00:15:39.765\nEnsures that the team is functional and\nproductive, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:39.765 --> 00:15:42.981\nNow we've got one more role here\nthat I just wanna talk about.\n\n292\n00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:46.253\nAnd I don't wanna spend too\nlong talking about this, but\n\n293\n00:15:46.253 --> 00:15:49.880\nI know that this is a role that\nexists in a lot of organizations.\n\n294\n00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.043\nAnd it's a role that,\nI guess psychologically,\n\n295\n00:15:53.043 --> 00:15:55.611\nwe can't get away from for some reason.\n\n296\n00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:59.518\nIt's also a role that most people\noutside of IT are familiar with as well.\n\n297\n00:15:59.518 --> 00:16:02.909\nIf you go outside of IT and\nstart talking about scrum masters,\n\n298\n00:16:02.909 --> 00:16:06.054\nthey might look at you as\nthough you're slightly crazy.\n\n299\n00:16:06.054 --> 00:16:10.131\nAnd certainly in the UK,\nif you start talking about scrum masters,\n\n300\n00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:12.643\nthen people start thinking about rugby.\n\n301\n00:16:15.121 --> 00:16:17.750\nYou don't know that, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I know what rugby is, but\n\n302\n00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:22.710\nI have no clue what role a scrum\nmaster plays in the rugby family.\n\n303\n00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.224\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so rugby scrum is, and\n\n304\n00:16:25.224 --> 00:16:30.184\nnow I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get\ndeath threats, I can tell you now.\n\n305\n00:16:30.184 --> 00:16:32.219\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But a rugby scrum is basically,\n\n306\n00:16:32.219 --> 00:16:35.272\nI've seen something similar\nin American football, but\n\n307\n00:16:35.272 --> 00:16:39.342\nit's really when all of the players on\nthe field just sort of get together and\n\n308\n00:16:39.342 --> 00:16:41.660\nthey're all just-\n&gt;&gt; Huddle?\n\n309\n00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.685\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could well be, it could be.\n\n310\n00:16:43.685 --> 00:16:44.544\n&gt;&gt; Tackle?\n\n311\n00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:47.124\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, it's more of a pile on more\n\n312\n00:16:47.124 --> 00:16:49.141\nthan anything else.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n313\n00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:49.997\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this so\n\n314\n00:16:49.997 --> 00:16:52.259\nthe scrum master has\nthe responsibility for\n\n315\n00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:57.350\norganizing the team.\n&gt;&gt; Rugby is just like American football,\n\n316\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.880\nbut because we're tough and hard we\njust don't have all of the armor and\n\n317\n00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.030\neverything.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n318\n00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.169\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we just get the injuries instead,\n\n319\n00:17:05.169 --> 00:17:05.800\nright?\n\n320\n00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.530\nYeah, it's not good.\n\n321\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.790\nIt's quite, yes.\n\n322\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.920\nAs scrum master then,\nit's probably something that,\n\n323\n00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.490\ncertainly in the UK you've heard the words\nscrum burden, not anywhere else.\n\n324\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:22.170\nAnd so it's not something I expect\nthe business to be aware of.\n\n325\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.651\nSo the business is generally aware\nof the project manager role.\n\n326\n00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:27.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n327\n00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.820\n&gt;&gt; What you may wanna do,\n\n328\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:34.100\nin your Agile project,\nis you may want to refer to the project,\n\n329\n00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.670\nor to the scrum master\nas a project manager.\n\n330\n00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.690\nWe don't care.\n\n331\n00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:42.500\nI mean, it's a methodology and it's up to\nyou to decide which methodology you use,\n\n332\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.516\nand what roles and\n\n333\n00:17:43.516 --> 00:17:48.940\nwhat responsibilities you give each role.\n&gt;&gt; However, if all of those practitioners\n\n334\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:54.210\nand all of those developers have\nbeen trained in Agile methods,\n\n335\n00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:59.240\nthen they'll be aware of the terminology\nand the difference in the responsibilities\n\n336\n00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.680\nbetween the scrum master and\nthe product owner.\n\n337\n00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.630\nSo introducing a role like project\nmanager might confuse the team.\n\n338\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.930\nSo if you're going to use\nthe role of project manager,\n\n339\n00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.540\nplease make sure-\n&gt;&gt; Define it.\n\n340\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.710\n&gt;&gt; It's defined, yeah,\n\n341\n00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.290\nthat we understand roles and\nresponsibilities.\n\n342\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.120\nThe project manager is,\nin traditional waterfall projects,\n\n343\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.130\nis somebody that's responsible for\nthe overall project.\n\n344\n00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.120\nSo they do both scrum\nmaster possibilities, and\n\n345\n00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.200\nthey will also make\ndecisions of functionality.\n\n346\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.830\nSo they do product owner as well.\n\n347\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.490\nSo a project manager, if you're going to\nbring one in, you've got to be really,\n\n348\n00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.720\nreally careful as to\nwhat you want them to do.\n\n349\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.620\nDo you want them to oversee the scrum\nmaster and the product owner?\n\n350\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.820\nBut then, do you need that role?\n\n351\n00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:50.600\nBecause if a scrum master facilitates the\nteam and the product owner takes ownership\n\n352\n00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.630\nof the product, and literally our\niterations are between one and\n\n353\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.180\nfour weeks long, do you really\nneed the project manager role?\n\n354\n00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.310\nSo define it.\n\n355\n00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:05.250\nIf you're going to bring in a project\nmanager, then everyone in the team, and\n\n356\n00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.160\nI mean everybody, has got to be\naware of the responsibilities that\n\n357\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.410\nyou are giving that project manager.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n358\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:19.080\nwhat we've done in that particular episode\nis we've just taken a very brief look at\n\n359\n00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.640\nthe roles that we've got described within\nAgile and within the Agile methodologies.\n\n360\n00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.111\nAnd more importantly, we've taken a look\nat what we would consider to be common\n\n361\n00:19:29.111 --> 00:19:30.388\nroles within our job.\n\n362\n00:19:30.388 --> 00:19:35.321\nAnd when we come back in our next episode\nwe're going to start to delve more into\n\n363\n00:19:35.321 --> 00:19:39.730\nAgile itself and look at\nthe activities of an Agile project.\n\n364\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:40.786\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so\n\n365\n00:19:40.786 --> 00:19:45.208\nI guess I can officially say\nnow I know my role, right?\n\n366\n00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:48.678\n[LAUGH] Thank you for that, Jo, and\nthank you guys for joining us as well, but\n\n367\n00:19:48.678 --> 00:19:49.880\nwe are going to sign out.\n\n368\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.480\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n369\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.862\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n370\n00:19:54.862 --> 00:20:00.854\n[MUSIC]\n\n371\n00:20:00.854 --> 00:20:04.333\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to\n\n5\n00:00:13.044 --> 00:00:16.390\nyour Agile Project Management Concepts\nseries.\n\n6\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.590\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.540\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look at\nsome agile methodologies, specifically,\n\n8\n00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.650\nScrum and XP.\n\n9\n00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.116\nAnd I'm so glad we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock in studios today cuz I can just\n\n10\n00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:35.049\nabout spell those acronyms, but\nI'm hoping you can provide more insight.\n\n11\n00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:37.945\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I certainly try, if you can't XP,\n\n12\n00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:41.812\nwe've got more problems-\n&gt;&gt; Well, here's the thing, I see XP, and\n\n13\n00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.512\nmy mind automatically goes\nto the operating system.\n\n14\n00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:46.800\nBut that's not the direction\nwe need to go in,\n\n15\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.805\nis it?\n&gt;&gt; Not right now, no.\n\n16\n00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:49.637\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:49.637 --> 00:00:51.906\n&gt;&gt; What we're gonna do in this particular\n\n18\n00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:56.513\nepisode is we're going to be looking at\njust a couple of methodologies that fall\n\n19\n00:00:56.513 --> 00:00:57.970\nunder the agile banner.\n\n20\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.632\nWe've already looked in previous\nepisodes at the fact that agile,\n\n21\n00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:05.506\nit's a concept, it's a way of working.\n\n22\n00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:10.221\nBut there are many more, I don’t like\nto use the word prescriptive, but\n\n23\n00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:14.970\nmore defined methodologies that\nactually operate in an agile way.\n\n24\n00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.110\nAnd that abide to those 12 principles of\nagile, abiding by the values of agile.\n\n25\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.915\nSo we’re gonna look at two of them in just\na little bit more depth, bearing in mind\n\n26\n00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:32.370\nthat this particular series is not\nabout these individual methodologies.\n\n27\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.150\nWe can look at those in other series.\n\n28\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.070\nThis series is just about\nlooking at agile concepts.\n\n29\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.747\nAnd all of these methodologies that\nwe're going to cover in this episode and\n\n30\n00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:48.650\nin another episode, Well,\nthey adhere to the agile principles.\n\n31\n00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.744\nAnd so these are just very specific or\nmore defined ways of employing an agile.\n\n32\n00:01:54.744 --> 00:01:56.770\nSo we're gonna start off with Scrum.\n\n33\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.307\nAnd Scrum is probably,\nI would like to say, the most well-known,\n\n34\n00:02:01.307 --> 00:02:06.300\nthe most used methodology that\napplies to the agile principle.\n\n35\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.460\nAnd Scrum is where you will\nhear words like sprint,\n\n36\n00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.230\nand the daily scrum, etc.\n\n37\n00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.521\nAnd you'll hear those words, and\nyeah, this is where it comes from.\n\n38\n00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:18.826\nYou hear terms like a scrum master,\n\n39\n00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:20.064\nwe'll take a look at that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n40\n00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:22.184\nI'm unfamiliar with those terms so.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\n\n41\n00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:27.160\nwe'll take a look at that in another\nepisode when we look at agile roles.\n\n42\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.840\nBut Scrum adheres to the agile principles,\nas we've already said.\n\n43\n00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.340\nAnd it is pretty much as it says,\nreally, right in front of us.\n\n44\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.340\nIt's an iterative, incremental framework\nfor managing product development.\n\n45\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.440\nAnd it goes on, and\nthis is the definition of Scrum.\n\n46\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.910\nFor complex problems,\n\n47\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.410\nwhile productively delivering\nproducts of highest possible value.\n\n48\n00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.310\nWe've already said this\nin previous episodes.\n\n49\n00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.510\nWe are all about delivering\nvalue to our customers.\n\n50\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.945\nIf we don't deliver valuable,\nworking software to our customers,\n\n51\n00:03:03.945 --> 00:03:06.280\nthey're going to go elsewhere.\n\n52\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.708\nAnd we have to deliver that\nin an iterative manner.\n\n53\n00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:16.220\nCustomers, users, expect software to be\nupdated and enhanced on a regular basis.\n\n54\n00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.740\nAnd so\nScrum as a methodology will do that.\n\n55\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.550\nSo Scrum concentrates on the actual team.\n\n56\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.770\nThat’s the team working on\nproduct development and\n\n57\n00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.370\nthe individuals within the team.\n\n58\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.740\nNow we already know that,\nin Agile, we value our team.\n\n59\n00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.350\nAnd we value the collaboration\nwith our customers.\n\n60\n00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.220\nAnd we value collaboration\nwithin our team.\n\n61\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.170\nAnd that's exactly what Scrum does.\n\n62\n00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.580\nScrum concentrates on our team,\ntheir skills, and\n\n63\n00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.590\nhow they work together, empowering\nthem to be able to deliver software.\n\n64\n00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.980\nAnd then we’ve got events.\n\n65\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.622\nAnd we've got words here\nwe’re all familiar with.\n\n66\n00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:57.386\nAnd you said you were familiar\nwith the Scrum master.\n\n67\n00:03:57.386 --> 00:04:02.350\nSo we've got a sprint, now a sprint,\nwe call this, in agile,\n\n68\n00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.130\nwe call that an iteration.\n\n69\n00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.848\nAnd that’s what we’re delivering\nat that point in time.\n\n70\n00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:09.400\nThat’s what we’re developing and\ndelivering.\n\n71\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.067\nNow that's slightly\ndifferent to a release.\n\n72\n00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:16.961\nAnd we'll look at that in more of our\nagile concepts in another episode.\n\n73\n00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:20.790\nSo we have our sprint, and\nour sprint is our iteration.\n\n74\n00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.530\nThat is what we are developing\nat that point in time.\n\n75\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.955\nSo that's we've agreed to develop.\n\n76\n00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:28.210\nThen we have a daily scrum.\n\n77\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.892\nNow you might wanna call\nthat a stand-up meeting.\n\n78\n00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:33.420\nAnd it's something that a lot\nof people are familiar with.\n\n79\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.854\nIt's something that we're familiar with,\nas well.\n\n80\n00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:35.558\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n81\n00:04:35.558 --> 00:04:37.145\n&gt;&gt; Whereas every morning,\n\n82\n00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:40.170\nit should go on for\nno longer than 15 minutes.\n\n83\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.590\nEvery morning we have\na stand-up where we just simply\n\n84\n00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.750\ntell everybody what we're\nplanning on doing for that day.\n\n85\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.550\nAnd also we want to tell\nthe team what issues\n\n86\n00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.850\nthat we have experienced the day before,\nhow much progress we made the day before,\n\n87\n00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.910\nand also, what issues we are expecting\nto experience during that\n\n88\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.830\ncoming day.\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, this is actually the first\n\n89\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.910\ncompany that I've worked for that\nimplements a stand-up or scrum meeting.\n\n90\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.770\nAnd I think it's pretty interesting\nbecause you said no more than 15 minutes.\n\n91\n00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.730\nAnd our company is growing.\n\n92\n00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.200\nAnd so in order for us to get around\nthe circle for each person to explain\n\n93\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.820\ntheir obstacles, challenges, or\nmaybe achievements, we're getting close.\n\n94\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.226\nWe're at like 14 minutes.\n\n95\n00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:29.575\nAnd Tim is watching his watch\nevery morning as we go around.\n\n96\n00:05:29.575 --> 00:05:34.854\nBecause, at some point, that meeting\nmay in turn become ineffective or\n\n97\n00:05:34.854 --> 00:05:38.190\ncounterintuitive by taking up more time.\n\n98\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.290\nBut I think it’s really cool because,\nseveral times, I, personally,\n\n99\n00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.130\nmay have had an issue with something that\nsomeone else has overcame in the past.\n\n100\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.850\nOr it’s an obstacle they've\nalready tackled and completed.\n\n101\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.850\nAnd they can help me out.\n\n102\n00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.440\nSo it's a great opportunity\nto still have that\n\n103\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.010\ncollaboration.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n104\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.820\nwe've got an episode where we're\nactually going to look at meetings.\n\n105\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.045\nAnd we're going to look\nat the daily stand-up or,\n\n106\n00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:04.970\nthe case of scrum,\nour daily scrum meeting.\n\n107\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.004\nNow let's just think about that\ndilemma just for a moment.\n\n108\n00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:12.829\nThat a team gets so\nlarge that the scrum meeting,\n\n109\n00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:18.520\nthe daily stand-up,\nbecomes inefficient because it's so large.\n\n110\n00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.333\nBut it's still effective.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n111\n00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:22.208\n&gt;&gt; But it's at the point in time when it\n\n112\n00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:23.459\nbecomes ineffective,\n\n113\n00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:27.035\nthat's when we've gotta start\nthinking about what else we can do.\n\n114\n00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:31.540\nAnd maybe splitting it down\ninto individual scrum meetings.\n\n115\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.690\nThe scrum meeting, itself, should\ntake place within the actual project.\n\n116\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.045\nSo it should be within the project team.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n117\n00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:41.795\n&gt;&gt; However, when we start looking at\n\n118\n00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:46.255\nscalability, it may be that\nit makes more sense then\n\n119\n00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:50.764\nto split that scrum meeting\ninto smaller scrum meetings.\n\n120\n00:06:50.764 --> 00:06:53.636\nBut you have to think about the\neffectiveness, as well as the efficiency.\n\n121\n00:06:53.636 --> 00:06:58.507\nThe efficiency, you'd like to think,\nwas taken care of by putting in that 15\n\n122\n00:06:58.507 --> 00:07:04.362\nminute threshold, to say that everybody's\ngotta have a say within 15 minutes.\n\n123\n00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:08.822\nSo you like to think that took\nthe part of the efficiency, but\n\n124\n00:07:08.822 --> 00:07:10.042\nthink about effectiveness.\n\n125\n00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:13.760\nYou see, when you stand up in your scrum\nmeeting, and you'll say, right, and\n\n126\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.766\nI envisage this particular problem today.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n127\n00:07:16.766 --> 00:07:21.766\nOr I think we're gonna have this obstacle,\nif you don't have everybody in the room-\n\n128\n00:07:21.766 --> 00:07:23.086\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what if we miss someone?\n\n129\n00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:23.633\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n130\n00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:29.350\nyou're not having the opportunity then for\neverybody to say, but I can help you.\n\n131\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.030\nAnd at what point in time\ndoes that become ineffective?\n\n132\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.690\nBecause you've gotta give people\nthe opportunity to say, yes,\n\n133\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.960\nI can help with that.\n\n134\n00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.038\nBecause they may be able to\ndo it in an efficient way.\n\n135\n00:07:41.038 --> 00:07:45.727\nAnother one of the principles of\nagile which is applied to Scrum\n\n136\n00:07:45.727 --> 00:07:48.479\nreally well is that understanding.\n\n137\n00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:51.092\nAnd I know that you and\nI have had conversations,\n\n138\n00:07:51.092 --> 00:07:54.106\nthat understanding that we've\nall got our own skills.\n\n139\n00:07:54.106 --> 00:08:00.350\nAnd that my issues will probably be\nbetter off resolved by somebody else.\n\n140\n00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.760\nI've got way too many\nissues with one person.\n\n141\n00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.920\n[LAUGH] But my issues might be better\noff resolved by somebody else than for\n\n142\n00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.110\nme trying to work it out.\n\n143\n00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.030\nLet's think about this in a realistic way.\n\n144\n00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.590\nIs it actually efficient for\n\n145\n00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.670\nme to spend half an hour trying to\nfigure out how to do something?\n\n146\n00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.070\nOr is it more efficient for\nme to ask somebody else\n\n147\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.725\nto spend five minutes using their\nskills to do something for me?\n\n148\n00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:32.896\nThis morning, or\nearlier on in a previous episode,\n\n149\n00:08:32.896 --> 00:08:37.720\nI was having an issue with\na USB stick on a laptop.\n\n150\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.508\nNow sure, I can try and figure this one\nout myself, I could have done that,\n\n151\n00:08:41.508 --> 00:08:42.121\nI'm sure.\n\n152\n00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.347\nBut it probably would\nhave taken me 30 minutes,\n\n153\n00:08:44.347 --> 00:08:47.156\nwhen it took me five minutes to go and\nask somebody else to do it.\n\n154\n00:08:47.156 --> 00:08:50.795\nAnd so that's really what\na Scrum meeting is about.\n\n155\n00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:54.233\nIt's about not just saying, hey look,\nthis is what I'm working on.\n\n156\n00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:57.986\nAnd allows everybody to give input into\nthat and say, hey look, I can help you,\n\n157\n00:08:57.986 --> 00:09:01.082\nwe're both doing the same thing,\nwe can work more efficiently.\n\n158\n00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:05.797\nBut it also gives somebody like Nate,\nwho is the person that I badgered [LAUGH]\n\n159\n00:09:05.797 --> 00:09:10.070\nThis morning, and it also gives\nthem the opportunity to say, look,\n\n160\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:14.730\nI can help you with that, and I'm gonna\ndo this more efficiently than you.\n\n161\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.243\nAnd yet again, it really concentrates\non working within a team and\n\n162\n00:09:18.243 --> 00:09:21.925\nunderstanding that everybody in\nthe team has got different skills.\n\n163\n00:09:21.925 --> 00:09:26.016\n&gt;&gt; Right, unfortunately, I’ve met people\n\n164\n00:09:26.016 --> 00:09:30.796\nwho that process would aggravate or\nbother them.\n\n165\n00:09:30.796 --> 00:09:34.778\nBut those are the characters or\nthe personalities, and\n\n166\n00:09:34.778 --> 00:09:37.800\nyou talked about finding the right team.\n\n167\n00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.360\nMotivated individuals who are trying\nto find people who are not in it for\n\n168\n00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.500\nthe fame and the glory.\n\n169\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.770\nBut they're in it for the team as a unit,\n\n170\n00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.610\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n171\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.122\nit's really important that we\nall work together as a team.\n\n172\n00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:53.850\nThe team's gonna get\nthe glory if we all succeed.\n\n173\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.329\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n174\n00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:56.537\n&gt;&gt; If you're in it for\n\n175\n00:09:56.537 --> 00:10:00.319\nyourself and you're trying to\nget the glory for yourself.\n\n176\n00:10:00.319 --> 00:10:04.833\nIf you're going to try and\nmake the team look bad in order for\n\n177\n00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:09.180\nyou to look good,\nthen you're not seen as a team player.\n\n178\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:15.073\nAnd then how much in demand will you be\nin the future by future team managers?\n\n179\n00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.950\nThey want somebody on board\nwho's going to be motivated and\n\n180\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.900\nwho's going to be a team player.\n\n181\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.610\nAnd who's going to be working for\nthe effectiveness of the team, and\n\n182\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.120\nnot just make themselves look good.\n\n183\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.580\nSo yeah, we've gotta make sure that,\nwithin any sort of Agile team and\n\n184\n00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.830\nwithin the Scrum project, we have\nindividuals that are part of a team.\n\n185\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.910\nAnd that we all recognize that everybody\nhas their own individual skills.\n\n186\n00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:46.000\nThere is absolutely no point in\nme trying to add in my MCSE,\n\n187\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.680\nabsolutely years ago,\nnearly 20 years ago now.\n\n188\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.080\nIt was a long, long time ago.\n\n189\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.650\nSo if I wanted something technical,\nthen I'm gonna come to you and ask you.\n\n190\n00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.830\nWhy?\nBecause you got your MCSE really,\n\n191\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.190\nreally recently.\n\n192\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:02.820\nBut more importantly than that,\nyou've been working with the technical\n\n193\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.440\nthings a lot more recently than I have.\n\n194\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.239\nSo I recognize that, and you'd recognize\nthat, yeah, I've got other skills.\n\n195\n00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:12.210\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n196\n00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.840\n&gt;&gt; That I could help you with.\n\n197\n00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.570\nSo, we work together as a team, and that's\nexactly what a Scrum team should be doing.\n\n198\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.140\nAnd this is why we should be having our\n\n199\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.390\ndaily stand up meeting to\nencourage that collaboration.\n\n200\n00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.659\nAnd then we also have reviews and\n\n201\n00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:33.114\nretrospectives where we look back,\nwhere we review the user stories.\n\n202\n00:11:33.114 --> 00:11:37.421\nAnd we review exactly what's going\nto be in that particular sprint and\n\n203\n00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:39.540\nwhether it's achievable or not.\n\n204\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.017\nAnd also, the retrospect is where we\nlook back at what we have achieved.\n\n205\n00:11:44.017 --> 00:11:47.020\nAnd then we have our artifacts,\nas we call them.\n\n206\n00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.360\nThese are our remnants,\n[LAUGH] Which is the backlogs.\n\n207\n00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.650\nAnd the backlogs are really\nwhat's left still to do.\n\n208\n00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:59.460\nSo what sprints have we got left, or\nwhat iterations have we got left?\n\n209\n00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.620\nAnd what have we got left to\ndo within the product itself,\n\n210\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.210\nwithin the actual\ndevelopment project itself?\n\n211\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:13.730\nAnd then our burn down chart is how much\nprogress are we making on that backlog?\n\n212\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.650\nAnd then we've also got our, what we call\nrules of the game, as well, within Scrum.\n\n213\n00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:23.400\nAnd the rules of the game are really\nhow everything works together.\n\n214\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.850\nHow our technical team work together,\nbut also how our\n\n215\n00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:33.568\ncomponents of our services and\nhow the products work together, as well.\n\n216\n00:12:33.568 --> 00:12:39.172\nWe've got five Scrum values that we\nreally concentrate on in a Scrum project.\n\n217\n00:12:39.172 --> 00:12:44.022\nAnd so the first three on\nthe slide in front of you, focus,\n\n218\n00:12:44.022 --> 00:12:46.400\n[LAUGH] And that's really important.\n\n219\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.667\nAnd in a previous episode,\nI've talked about time management.\n\n220\n00:12:49.667 --> 00:12:54.180\nAnd I've talked about working out\nwhen your productive time is and\n\n221\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.535\nmaking sure that the difficult tasks you\ndo when your most productive time is.\n\n222\n00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:03.600\nAnd when you're at your least productive\ntime, like 3:00 PM in the afternoon for\n\n223\n00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.790\nme, for instance.\n\n224\n00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.550\nThen, that's where you do things that\nare almost second nature to you.\n\n225\n00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.550\nThings that you don't\nhave to concentrate on.\n\n226\n00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.300\n&gt;&gt; Like go grab a Snickers.\n\n227\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.285\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah [LAUGH]\n\n228\n00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:14.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Isn't that their\n\n229\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.010\nnewest commercial theme?\n&gt;&gt; Is that what it is?\n\n230\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you hit your afternoon\n\n231\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.040\nslump, go grab a Snickers.\n&gt;&gt; I'll go and grab chocolate anytime.\n\n232\n00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.408\n[LAUGH] Hey,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You don't have to tell me\n\n233\n00:13:24.408 --> 00:13:25.673\ntwice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n234\n00:13:25.673 --> 00:13:28.830\nanytime's chocolate time, right?\n\n235\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.190\nSo focus on what you're doing right now,\nand try not to be distracted And,\n\n236\n00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.245\nin a previous episode, yet again,\nwe looked at social media.\n\n237\n00:13:37.245 --> 00:13:41.190\n[LAUGH] And I made that face\nbecause social media is a huge,\n\n238\n00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.190\nbig distraction for most people.\n\n239\n00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.980\nYou're not productive\nwhen you're doing that.\n\n240\n00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.530\nSo, you have to focus\non the task at hand and\n\n241\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.620\nrely on your Scrum master, and we'll\nlook at that role in another episode.\n\n242\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.460\nBut a Scrum master is somebody who will\ncome along and who will ensure that your\n\n243\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.210\nworking environment is conducive\nto you being able to develop.\n\n244\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.750\nThey will remove any impediments.\n\n245\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.156\nAnd then you've got a product owner,\nsomebody who's responsible for\n\n246\n00:14:09.156 --> 00:14:11.953\nthe functional aspects of the development.\n\n247\n00:14:11.953 --> 00:14:14.733\nAnd they're going to ensure\nthat the work's prioritized, so\n\n248\n00:14:14.733 --> 00:14:16.830\nyou know what you should be working on.\n\n249\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.760\nNow, we talk about\nempowering people in Agile.\n\n250\n00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.975\nEmpowering people to do the work doesn't\nmean that we empower people to decide what\n\n251\n00:14:24.975 --> 00:14:27.160\nthey're going to work on, when, and where.\n\n252\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.032\nWe still have to know what's being\ndelivered in each sprint in this\n\n253\n00:14:32.032 --> 00:14:33.340\ncase with Scrum.\n\n254\n00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.223\nAnd therefore,\n\n255\n00:14:34.223 --> 00:14:38.636\nwe have to make sure that those developers\nare actually doing the work that they're\n\n256\n00:14:38.636 --> 00:14:40.053\nsupposed to be doing.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n257\n00:14:40.053 --> 00:14:42.308\nhelping them get to that goal, right?\n\n258\n00:14:42.308 --> 00:14:46.453\nLike providing the right resources for\nthem, the right equipment, or\n\n259\n00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:48.837\nwhatever it may be.\n&gt;&gt; And the roles combined,\n\n260\n00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:51.590\nScrum master and product owner,\nwill facilitate that.\n\n261\n00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.160\nThe product owner will keep them\nfocused on their priorities.\n\n262\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.910\nAnd the Scrum master will give them\nthe right tools to be able to do the job.\n\n263\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.647\nSo the team's gotta be finished, or gotta\nbe focused on finishing the user stories.\n\n264\n00:15:05.647 --> 00:15:08.519\nAnd making sure that we\nwill resolve whatever\n\n265\n00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:11.096\nproblem it is we're trying to resolve.\n\n266\n00:15:11.096 --> 00:15:16.027\nOr implement whatever functionality\nwe're trying to implement, and\n\n267\n00:15:16.027 --> 00:15:17.677\nthat we complete that.\n\n268\n00:15:17.677 --> 00:15:22.270\nAnd I really like, as a value,\nI love the word, courage.\n\n269\n00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.250\nBut then if I look a little\nbit more at the bullet points,\n\n270\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.910\nI see the word, commitment.\n\n271\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.630\nAnd I see the word, trust.\n\n272\n00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.410\nAnd I see the word, guide.\n\n273\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.350\nIt's about being empowered.\n\n274\n00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.230\nIt's about empowering the team.\n\n275\n00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.378\nBut it's also about the team saying,\nlook, this is what I'm gonna do.\n\n276\n00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:42.170\nAnd then this is what you do.\n\n277\n00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:47.581\nThe last bullet point in courage,\nwhile the team must commit\n\n278\n00:15:47.581 --> 00:15:51.721\nto as much work as they can achieve,\nyou can't over commit.\n\n279\n00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:57.183\nIf you over commit, you're not going to\nachieve what it is you set out to achieve.\n\n280\n00:15:57.183 --> 00:16:01.638\nBut also you don't wanna by sitting around\ntwiddling your thumbs with your feet up on\n\n281\n00:16:01.638 --> 00:16:02.650\nyour desk either.\n\n282\n00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.720\nSo you have to make sure that\nthe workload that you commit to\n\n283\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.400\nis actually a viable workload, and\nthat you're not just sitting around.\n\n284\n00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.499\nAnd this is where that trust comes\nin about empowering the team.\n\n285\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.240\nAnd this is why it's important to be open.\n\n286\n00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.310\nThat's the other value there on our slide,\nopenness.\n\n287\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:27.500\nMaking sure that everybody is fully aware\nof what it is that they've got to do,\n\n288\n00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.636\nand also what's outstanding, as well.\n\n289\n00:16:29.636 --> 00:16:36.780\nAnd I like open, and I like the word\nobjective, as well, that's mentioned.\n\n290\n00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.390\nBecause you have to have,\nI guess it goes back to courage as well,\n\n291\n00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.490\nyou have to have the courage to\nbe able to say I don't know.\n\n292\n00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.300\nI'm not the best person for\nthis particular role.\n\n293\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.810\nI'm not the best person for this job.\n\n294\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.530\nIt's being open.\n\n295\n00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:56.130\nHaving the courage to say I can't do it,\nand being open to the fact that somebody\n\n296\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:00.450\nelse may be better at that\nparticular task than you are.\n\n297\n00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.190\nAnd this is why we talk about objective.\n\n298\n00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:08.268\nAnd the retrospective, looking back on\nwhat we've done, and what we did well,\n\n299\n00:17:08.268 --> 00:17:12.610\nand where we didn't do so well,\nhas got to be completely objective.\n\n300\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.082\nIt's not a personal criticism.\n\n301\n00:17:14.082 --> 00:17:18.528\nIf you tell me that I didn't do something\nvery efficiently, or if you tell\n\n302\n00:17:18.528 --> 00:17:23.210\nme that I could have done something\nbetter, it's not a personal criticism.\n\n303\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.090\nIt's just we're concerned with\nthe efficiency, the effectiveness,\n\n304\n00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.794\nof the team.\n\n305\n00:17:27.794 --> 00:17:30.756\nAnd, therefore,we wanna\nmake sure that the team\n\n306\n00:17:30.756 --> 00:17:31.695\nexceeds.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n307\n00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:33.640\n&gt;&gt; And the team excels.\n\n308\n00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.270\nIt's not really down to\njust the individuals.\n\n309\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.886\nSo I'm gonna listen to you.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n310\n00:17:37.886 --> 00:17:42.841\nthat's something that\nI would say early on.\n\n311\n00:17:42.841 --> 00:17:47.813\nSometimes people don't always receive that\nwell because they might think they're\n\n312\n00:17:47.813 --> 00:17:52.520\ntaking it really personally or\nthey're coming, attacking me individually.\n\n313\n00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.500\nBut that's really not that case.\n\n314\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.840\nSo I think you kind of have\nto grow a thick skin or\n\n315\n00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.040\nat least you're able to\nrecognize the end goal, and\n\n316\n00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.710\nnot just take it so personally.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of it's\n\n317\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.380\ndown to interpersonal relationships.\n\n318\n00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.570\nAnd we've mentioned in previous\nepisodes about team collaboration and\n\n319\n00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.260\nabout teams getting on with each other.\n\n320\n00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.020\nAnd it's really important that\nyou have that collaboration and\n\n321\n00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.635\nthat you have the right mix of team.\n\n322\n00:18:18.635 --> 00:18:23.095\nIf you've got team members that really\ndon't get along, whether they've got\n\n323\n00:18:23.095 --> 00:18:26.175\na complementary skill set or not,\nif they really don't get along.\n\n324\n00:18:26.175 --> 00:18:28.255\nIf I don't like you,\nI'm gonna be honest with you.\n\n325\n00:18:28.255 --> 00:18:29.078\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n326\n00:18:29.078 --> 00:18:30.981\n&gt;&gt; If I don't like you [LAUGH], right,\n\n327\n00:18:30.981 --> 00:18:33.773\nI'm gonna take any criticisms\nthat you send my way,\n\n328\n00:18:33.773 --> 00:18:36.324\nI'm gonna take it as\ncriticism from the start.\n\n329\n00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.524\nAnd it might just be\nan objective observation.\n\n330\n00:18:38.524 --> 00:18:40.077\nBut I'm gonna take it as criticism.\n\n331\n00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:43.527\nI'm going to take it personally,\nand I'm not going to like it.\n\n332\n00:18:43.527 --> 00:18:47.464\nAnd then I'm going to look for\na way to criticize you.\n\n333\n00:18:49.084 --> 00:18:51.953\nAnd that's not collaboration, is it?\n\n334\n00:18:51.953 --> 00:18:55.323\nThat's not a good team.\n&gt;&gt; Well, not to mention it'll drive you\n\n335\n00:18:55.323 --> 00:18:59.853\ncrazy if you're like that because, I'll\ntell you, sometimes, especially even here\n\n336\n00:18:59.853 --> 00:19:04.094\nat IT.PROTV when I first started, I\nthought, wow, I said something so stupid.\n\n337\n00:19:04.094 --> 00:19:05.935\nOr what was I talking about?\n\n338\n00:19:05.935 --> 00:19:11.119\nAnd it will wear on you, and you just\nkind of have to let it go [LAUGH].\n\n339\n00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:14.067\n&gt;&gt; So, out of those, no, it's true.\n\n340\n00:19:14.067 --> 00:19:17.875\nOut of those, if you look at\nthe slide in front of you, then,\n\n341\n00:19:17.875 --> 00:19:22.837\nin the top section there on focus, whose\njob do you think it is to sort that out?\n\n342\n00:19:24.445 --> 00:19:25.870\n&gt;&gt; I would say it's the individual.\n\n343\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.730\nAnd if they're having such a big problem,\n\n344\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.770\nthen they take it to the scrum master.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n345\n00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.780\nit's the scrum master's job.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n346\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.030\n&gt;&gt; It's the scrum master's job to\n\n347\n00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.800\nsort that out.\n\n348\n00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.140\nIt says that they remove any\nimpediments to progress.\n\n349\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.250\nBut the scrum master\nactually manages the team,\n\n350\n00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.930\nand makes sure that everybody's\nworking in a collaborative way.\n\n351\n00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.550\nIt's their job to identify that and\nto do something about it.\n\n352\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.350\nYou cannot just let that type of\nrelationship fester because it's\n\n353\n00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.673\nnot going to improve teamwork.\n\n354\n00:19:52.673 --> 00:19:54.244\nIt's not going to improve morale.\n\n355\n00:19:54.244 --> 00:19:56.730\nAnd it's not gonna be effective either.\n\n356\n00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.040\nIt's not gonna allow for\nan effective delivery of product.\n\n357\n00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.938\nSo the product owner has got\nabsolutely nothing to do with that.\n\n358\n00:20:03.938 --> 00:20:07.714\nHowever, that said, the product owner\nis going to be affected if you're not\n\n359\n00:20:07.714 --> 00:20:11.152\ndelivering the product,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So what you're saying here, Jo,\n\n360\n00:20:11.152 --> 00:20:14.821\nis if I was saying some things\nrepetitively that didn't make sense,\n\n361\n00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:18.235\nwe should probably have some sort of Q&amp;A,\nor QA, I should say,\n\n362\n00:20:18.235 --> 00:20:19.560\nimplemented.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n363\n00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.582\n&gt;&gt; Which we do [LAUGH].\n\n364\n00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:21.335\n&gt;&gt; Check,\n\n365\n00:20:21.335 --> 00:20:24.120\nyeah, I don't know what she was on today,\nbut yeah.\n\n366\n00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.730\nThat sort of thing, right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n367\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.495\n&gt;&gt; So, lets look at our other values then.\n\n368\n00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:31.130\nAnd our other values include commitment.\n\n369\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.490\nAnd this is another value from scrum.\n\n370\n00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.550\nThe team commits to what\nthey're going to do.\n\n371\n00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:42.360\nAnd the scrum master commits to being that\nperson that's going to guide the team.\n\n372\n00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:47.310\nAnd then the product owner commits to\nhaving a prioritized backlog available.\n\n373\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:52.178\nSo there's commitment there from everybody\nthat they're going to be part of the team.\n\n374\n00:20:52.178 --> 00:20:56.280\nAnd I asked that question,\nit was a leading question, really,\n\n375\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.200\ncuz the answer's right in front\nof you now underneath respect.\n\n376\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.110\nThe scrum master's in charge of how\nthe team works and how the team interacts.\n\n377\n00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.235\nAnd the product owner, though, is in\ncharge of the actual project, itself.\n\n378\n00:21:07.235 --> 00:21:09.415\nThat's why they're called\nthe product owner.\n\n379\n00:21:09.415 --> 00:21:12.815\nBut you and I, as a team,\nwe're responsible for doing the work.\n\n380\n00:21:12.815 --> 00:21:17.105\nBut, nevertheless, somebody's got to\nensure that we're working in an efficient\n\n381\n00:21:17.105 --> 00:21:18.075\nand an effective way.\n\n382\n00:21:19.485 --> 00:21:24.510\nSo that brings us into, then, we've just\ntaken a very, very brief look at scrum.\n\n383\n00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:27.860\nAnd now we're gonna take\nanother look into XP.\n\n384\n00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.300\nNot the operating system.\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n385\n00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.940\n&gt;&gt; But extreme programming.\n\n386\n00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.230\nAnd really, again,\n\n387\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.020\nthis is, you're gonna find that all\nof these are pretty much the same.\n\n388\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.780\nWe have the same principle because\nthey're agile methodologies.\n\n389\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.600\nAnd it's all about focusing\non customer satisfaction.\n\n390\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.452\nIt's about delivering value.\n\n391\n00:21:47.452 --> 00:21:50.830\nBut it's about rapid\ndelivery of the product,\n\n392\n00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.473\nas well,\nthat we deliver on fixed delivery dates.\n\n393\n00:21:54.473 --> 00:21:58.460\nThen that's the principal with extreme\nprogramming is it's rapid programming.\n\n394\n00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.600\nThat's why it's called\nextreme because it is rapid.\n\n395\n00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.130\nSo there are some concepts there\nthat you can see in front of you.\n\n396\n00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.160\nAnd, really,\nthe ones that I want to pull out,\n\n397\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.028\nand I'm not gonna spend too much\ntime talking about XP because XP,\n\n398\n00:22:13.028 --> 00:22:17.790\nas you said, it's not something\nthat is widely recognized.\n\n399\n00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:24.364\nScrum is the most widely recognized,\nwidely utilized, methodology within agile.\n\n400\n00:22:24.364 --> 00:22:26.490\nThere are also DSDM, as well.\n\n401\n00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.020\nAnd we're gonna look at another\ntwo in another episode, too.\n\n402\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.929\nXP is not necessarily\nthe most widely recognized.\n\n403\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:43.960\nBut you'll see that all of these concepts,\nthey all follow the agile principles.\n\n404\n00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.410\nSo assumptions,\nthe requirements are going to change.\n\n405\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.830\nDevelopers, the team, are empowered.\n\n406\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.430\nIt's short iterations, but\nit allows for feedback.\n\n407\n00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.360\nOne thing, you were gonna say something,\n\n408\n00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.930\nCherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Just that it seems very similar to some\n\n409\n00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.942\nof the bullet points we\njust saw with the stories.\n\n410\n00:23:01.942 --> 00:23:08.390\nAnd so, even in the past, I know I always\nthought stories is like two weeks.\n\n411\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.320\nBut even then, you said it's not so\nset in stone, it's not so defined.\n\n412\n00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n413\n00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.630\nThe story, itself, should be defined.\n\n414\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.020\nBut then that's not to\nsay that it won't change.\n\n415\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.240\nAnd if it changes, then it should\nchange in a future iteration.\n\n416\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.650\nOnce the story's been agreed,\nthen it's defined.\n\n417\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.480\nBut then you're talking a number of weeks,\nso we'd say up to four weeks.\n\n418\n00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.770\nWell, yes,\nthat story's going to change, or\n\n419\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.070\nthere's going to be\nenhancements to the story.\n\n420\n00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.840\nBut because you're talking about\nmaybe a four week development cycle.\n\n421\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.880\n&gt;&gt; Start a new one?\n\n422\n00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.596\n&gt;&gt; Right, we start\n\n423\n00:23:41.596 --> 00:23:43.140\nanother one.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n424\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.040\nSo we don't actually\nchange the previous story.\n\n425\n00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.290\nSo we're not talking about something,\na project,\n\n426\n00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.111\nthat's gonna be 18 months long\nthat's gonna be cast in stone.\n\n427\n00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:54.948\nYou're talking about the next\nfour weeks being cast in stone.\n\n428\n00:23:54.948 --> 00:23:58.453\nYou're not talking about,\nThe next four years.\n\n429\n00:23:58.453 --> 00:24:04.600\nSo we have here, and, again, XP, and\nall of these are gonna sound very similar.\n\n430\n00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.270\nWhen we go into the other methodologies,\ntoo, they're all gonna sound very similar\n\n431\n00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.360\nbecause they're all based\non agile principles.\n\n432\n00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.110\nBut they were all created for\nspecific purposes.\n\n433\n00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.100\nAnd this one is very,\nvery development focused.\n\n434\n00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.315\nYou'll notice the bottom bullet\npoints talk about pieces of code.\n\n435\n00:24:23.315 --> 00:24:24.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just reading that one.\n\n436\n00:24:24.292 --> 00:24:26.274\nAnd I'm like unit testing performed for\n\n437\n00:24:26.274 --> 00:24:29.185\nevery piece of code developed.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n438\n00:24:29.185 --> 00:24:31.170\nscrum is at a very high level.\n\n439\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:36.412\nWhereas if we look at XP, XP is very-\n&gt;&gt; Granular?\n\n440\n00:24:36.412 --> 00:24:37.422\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n441\n00:24:37.422 --> 00:24:39.892\nIt's focused on coding,\n\n442\n00:24:39.892 --> 00:24:43.954\nlooking at this from a technical\nperspective, should we say.\n\n443\n00:24:43.954 --> 00:24:47.652\nWhereas scrum and\na lot of the other methodologies\n\n444\n00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:49.602\nare looking at it from\na management perspective.\n\n445\n00:24:49.602 --> 00:24:52.472\nThis is looking at it from\nsort of the technical analyst,\n\n446\n00:24:52.472 --> 00:24:54.670\nthe actual developer's perspective.\n\n447\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.720\nWhich is why we'll\nmention acceptance tests\n\n448\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.740\nthat are designed ahead of development.\n\n449\n00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.190\nSo before you even start to develop,\n\n450\n00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.070\nyou're going to design\nwhat you're going to test.\n\n451\n00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.940\nSo you understand your requirements,\nand then you say, okay,\n\n452\n00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.500\nhow can I test if those\nrequirements are met.\n\n453\n00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.710\nAnd then we test every single piece\n\n454\n00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:12.800\nof code.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n455\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.310\n&gt;&gt; And we have rules that we have with XP.\n\n456\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.970\nSo, for instance, the developers\nhave got to estimate how much work.\n\n457\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.922\nAnd we're gonna have short,\nconsistent iterations.\n\n458\n00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:27.830\nAnd we're taking every one to two weeks,\nas you've already mentioned, with XP.\n\n459\n00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.630\nBut then we still have our usually\ndaily stand-up meetings here, and\n\n460\n00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.970\nwe talk about velocity predictions.\n\n461\n00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:41.780\nSo knowing how quickly we're going\nto deliver certain iterations and\n\n462\n00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.120\ncertain pieces of code.\n\n463\n00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.870\nAnd that one to two weeks has got\nto allow for not just the design,\n\n464\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.950\nand the development ,and the testing,\nand the deployment as well.\n\n465\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:57.010\nSo that's very, very rapid development,\nwhich is why we call it XP.\n\n466\n00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.160\nIt's incredibly rapid.\n\n467\n00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.130\nNow, again,\nthere's that focus in the managing.\n\n468\n00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.830\nThere's focus on the teamwork.\n\n469\n00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:08.380\nThere's focus on the daily stand-up\nmeetings, moving people around\n\n470\n00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:13.250\naccording to their skill sets, and\nalso to allow for cross-training.\n\n471\n00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.680\nAnd we've spoken in\na previous episode about\n\n472\n00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.060\nhaving a team in one particular area.\n\n473\n00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.910\nEven virtually that will work,\nbut having the team together.\n\n474\n00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.140\nSo it really does enhance that\ncollaboration and the cross-training.\n\n475\n00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:34.600\nWhat we're looking at with XP is\nreally short and simple iterations.\n\n476\n00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.087\nThat's what we're looking at.\n\n477\n00:26:36.087 --> 00:26:42.980\nAnd we remove all unwanted code.\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking about, and\n\n478\n00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.430\nlike I said before, I'm not a developer\nmyself, but I do work with coding.\n\n479\n00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.510\nAnd even a lot of you,\nif you have a background in IT,\n\n480\n00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.929\nyou'll see that that's really the way\na lot of environments are heading.\n\n481\n00:26:53.929 --> 00:26:57.976\nAnd I can't think of an integrated\ndevelopment environment, an IDE,\n\n482\n00:26:57.976 --> 00:27:02.030\nthat doesn't allow you to run\na particular block of code in isolation.\n\n483\n00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:06.488\nSo I could see how important it\nreally is here in this extreme\n\n484\n00:27:06.488 --> 00:27:10.660\nprogramming methodology.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n485\n00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.130\nfocus on the bottom of\nthis particular slide.\n\n486\n00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.930\nIt looks more at the actual code,\nin itself.\n\n487\n00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.925\nAnd we mentioned in a previous episode,\n\n488\n00:27:19.925 --> 00:27:23.154\nyou'll talk about programming in pairs.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n489\n00:27:23.154 --> 00:27:25.310\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember we had that discussion?\n\n490\n00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.060\nAnd you'll see here under\nour coding rules, and\n\n491\n00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.390\nthese are our rules for XP, your code\nis written to an agreed standard.\n\n492\n00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.030\nBut it's pair programmed so\nit's programmed by two people.\n\n493\n00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.950\nOnly one pair integrates\nat any one point in time.\n\n494\n00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.700\nAnd by the way,\nyou never test your own code.\n\n495\n00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.710\nSo when it comes to testing, so\nyou and I might write some code.\n\n496\n00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.680\nOkay, I'm dreaming now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n497\n00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.750\n&gt;&gt; You and I might write some code, but\n\n498\n00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.010\nwe'll probably get Ronnie and\n\n499\n00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:56.730\nWes to test it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n500\n00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.250\n&gt;&gt; We wouldn't test it.\n\n501\n00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:02.450\nAnd that brings us into that last bullet\npoint about collective code ownership.\n\n502\n00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:06.410\nAnybody can make changes, and\nanybody can make enhancements to the code.\n\n503\n00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.040\nSo if Ronnie and Wes didn't like\nsomething that we had done,\n\n504\n00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.180\nthen they could make changes,\nand they could enhance it.\n\n505\n00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.980\nAnd as long as that is documented,\n\n506\n00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.200\nas long as there's a change control in\nplace so we know what's being done.\n\n507\n00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.540\nBecause that's another principal\nis that you fix something once.\n\n508\n00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.600\nYou don't fix it ten times.\n\n509\n00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.955\nSo if they're making changes to that code,\nthen that's documented so\n\n510\n00:28:29.955 --> 00:28:32.798\nthat we can apply those\nchanges in the future.\n\n511\n00:28:32.798 --> 00:28:37.097\nAnd, in fact, that's even mentioned on\nthe next slide here, in the middle there.\n\n512\n00:28:37.097 --> 00:28:42.475\nWhen bugs are found, you put something\nin place to prevent it occurring again.\n\n513\n00:28:42.475 --> 00:28:46.875\nSo this really does,\nXP focuses on the technical side.\n\n514\n00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:50.922\nIt focuses on the code rather than\nfrom a management perspective.\n\n515\n00:28:50.922 --> 00:28:54.682\nIt's actually, I like to think of\nXP as sort of agile for techies.\n\n516\n00:28:54.682 --> 00:28:56.345\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n517\n00:28:56.345 --> 00:28:57.015\n&gt;&gt; That's the easiest way to look at it.\n\n518\n00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:58.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in my mind,\n\n519\n00:28:58.288 --> 00:29:01.918\nin this testing phase,\nI'm thinking, well, not debugging.\n\n520\n00:29:01.918 --> 00:29:03.640\nBut in the testing, more like fuzzing.\n\n521\n00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.590\nSo I'm running iit through that fuzzer,\ntrying to break it before I\n\n522\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:11.660\nactually deploy it and send it on the way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, this really is.\n\n523\n00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.936\nWe don't want to get, we can't get\ninto too much detail, let's face it,\n\n524\n00:29:14.936 --> 00:29:17.335\nbecause we're in a project\nmanagement environment.\n\n525\n00:29:17.335 --> 00:29:20.641\nAnd any project could be-\n&gt;&gt; You can't force someone to use\n\n526\n00:29:20.641 --> 00:29:22.971\na particular tool or whatever.\n&gt;&gt; Right, right,\n\n527\n00:29:22.971 --> 00:29:25.890\nbut what we're saying is that\nwe've got some rules here.\n\n528\n00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.250\nAnd these are our sort of technical\nrules when it comes to agile,\n\n529\n00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.900\nthough a little bit more granular than\nanything else that we've looked at.\n\n530\n00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.401\nI mean,\n\n531\n00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:40.082\nwe do have some issues with XP because\nwe're focusing on the technical here.\n\n532\n00:29:40.082 --> 00:29:44.431\nSo we have to make sure that\nwe do have somebody managing\n\n533\n00:29:44.431 --> 00:29:46.993\nthe team that is able to manage.\n\n534\n00:29:46.993 --> 00:29:52.961\nAnd that's able to manage things like,\nwell, personalities,\n\n535\n00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:57.852\nfor instance, and\nis able to ensure collaboration.\n\n536\n00:29:57.852 --> 00:30:01.307\nI've come across some\ndevelopers who are really good\n\n537\n00:30:01.307 --> 00:30:06.219\nat sort of interpersonal relationships,\nand are people people as it were,\n\n538\n00:30:06.219 --> 00:30:08.771\nand get on very well with other people.\n\n539\n00:30:08.771 --> 00:30:11.821\nBut I've also come across\ndevelopers that work better when\n\n540\n00:30:11.821 --> 00:30:14.410\nthey're left to themselves.\n&gt;&gt; I have met a lot\n\n541\n00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.760\nof developers like that.\n\n542\n00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.564\nAnd if you are a developer,\nyou'll know what I'm talking about.\n\n543\n00:30:18.564 --> 00:30:22.286\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, I have too.\n\n544\n00:30:22.286 --> 00:30:24.788\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying they're all like that,\n\n545\n00:30:24.788 --> 00:30:25.311\nbut.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n546\n00:30:25.311 --> 00:30:27.152\nthis is why I wanted that caveat there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n547\n00:30:27.152 --> 00:30:28.681\n&gt;&gt; I've come across some that are really\n\n548\n00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:29.880\nsociable people.\n\n549\n00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.920\nBut I've also come across some\ndevelopers that are very quiet, and\n\n550\n00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.540\nwork best when they're on their own, and\n\n551\n00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:41.050\nleft to their own sort of thoughts,\nand to their own ideas.\n\n552\n00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:46.831\nNow, XP really does, the rules in XP\nwill kind of drag them out of there and\n\n553\n00:30:46.831 --> 00:30:50.491\nsay, no, we've gotta work in pairs, okay.\n\n554\n00:30:50.491 --> 00:30:55.336\nWe've got to make sure that if\nI'm run over by a bus today that\n\n555\n00:30:55.336 --> 00:30:58.580\nyou're able to pick up where I left off.\n\n556\n00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.280\nAnd it's about the efficiency of the team.\n\n557\n00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:05.780\nIt's about the fact that we've\ngot a product to deliver, and so\n\n558\n00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.320\nwe've both got to work together.\n\n559\n00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.971\nWe've got to be really careful,\nwe're techy people.\n\n560\n00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:15.740\nWe've got to be careful that we\ndon't try and automate too much.\n\n561\n00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.020\nI look at that third bullet point and\n\n562\n00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.150\nit talks there about\nautomated acceptance testing.\n\n563\n00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.970\nBe careful.\n\n564\n00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:29.760\nYou don't want to automate too much\nwhen it comes to your testing.\n\n565\n00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.710\nAnd you want to make sure that\nwhat we're actually testing is\n\n566\n00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.570\nagainst the specification.\n\n567\n00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.950\nAnd we're not just testing\nhow something works,\n\n568\n00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:41.790\nwe're testing that it's actually going to\ndeliver what it's supposed to deliver.\n\n569\n00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:47.610\nThere's a difference between whether\nsomething will deliver an output and\n\n570\n00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.660\nwhether it will do it in an efficient way.\n\n571\n00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:55.050\nAnd so we don't just want to be able\nto test that maybe that new patch or\n\n572\n00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:58.750\nthat new update will allow\nemail to be sent and received.\n\n573\n00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.280\nWe also want to test that it works in an\nefficient way, and that we're not waiting\n\n574\n00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.580\nfor half an hour for\nan email to come through from somebody.\n\n575\n00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:11.186\nSo we want to make sure that our\nacceptance tests both the output,\n\n576\n00:32:11.186 --> 00:32:15.140\nbut also the usability of\nany functionality, as well.\n\n577\n00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:20.954\nNow, the last bullet point is\na really important bullet point.\n\n578\n00:32:20.954 --> 00:32:25.630\nAnd it simply states that the customer can\nbecome a single point of failure if they\n\n579\n00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:30.640\ndon't approve the designs, or\nif they don't approve the test results.\n\n580\n00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.587\nYes, they can.\n\n581\n00:32:31.587 --> 00:32:36.302\nBut we also have to remember\nthat we are designing to deliver\n\n582\n00:32:36.302 --> 00:32:38.260\nvalue to the customer.\n\n583\n00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:43.170\nAnd so while that customer can be\nseen as a single point of failure,\n\n584\n00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:46.060\nour customer is also the person\nthat we want to deliver value to.\n\n585\n00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.300\nSo it's really important\nthat they're happy.\n\n586\n00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.450\nSo don't make your customer\na single point of failure.\n\n587\n00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:56.480\nMake your customer as the person that\nyou want to deliver your results to.\n\n588\n00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.190\nSo they are, in reality, your customer.\n\n589\n00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.600\nSo in this particular episode, then, we\nlooked at scrum, and we've looked at XP,\n\n590\n00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.130\nextreme programming.\n\n591\n00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:11.080\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\nwe're going to look at another two\n\n592\n00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.350\nagile methodologies.\n&gt;&gt; Another teaser, thanks for that, Jo.\n\n593\n00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.740\nCome back and look at those,.\n\n594\n00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.530\nAnd you don't want to miss them,\nbut for now, let's sign out.\n\n595\n00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.936\nI've been your host ,Cherokee Bose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n596\n00:33:21.936 --> 00:33:24.069\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n597\n00:33:24.069 --> 00:33:30.217\n[MUSIC]\n\n598\n00:33:30.217 --> 00:33:33.211\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Welcome to your\n\n6\n00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.580\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.640\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.180\nIn this episode we'll continue taking a\nlook at different agile methodologies and\n\n9\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.970\nspecifically we'll be taking\na look at Canban and Lean.\n\n10\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.100\nAnd of course, with us today back\nin studios, we have Mrs.Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.080\nThank you for joining us today,\nJo, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.674\n&gt;&gt; I'm fine, thank you,\n\n13\n00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:33.950\nhow are you, Cherokee?\n&gt;&gt; I'm good,\n\n14\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.365\nI'm really happy you didn't leave me all\non my own to go ahead with these topics.\n\n15\n00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:41.590\n[LAUGH] Because we'd\nlearn a few things but\n\n16\n00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.290\ndefinitely not to\nthe extent that you would.\n\n17\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.877\nI'd be talking about other Japanese\n\n18\n00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:47.994\ncultures\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:50.058\n&gt;&gt; Like going to Disney.\n\n20\n00:00:50.058 --> 00:00:52.434\nAnd things like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n21\n00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:55.878\nnow she is desperate to go to Disney now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n\n22\n00:00:55.878 --> 00:01:00.047\n&gt;&gt; I can tell you yeah am getting all\n\n23\n00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:03.824\ndiagram, the fish bone,\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that was, For\n\n24\n00:01:03.824 --> 00:01:05.380\nuse in problem management.\n\n25\n00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.370\nWhen we were looking at retail.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and real cause and\n\n26\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.560\nthings like that.\n\n27\n00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.020\nBut then we'd be like, and\n\n28\n00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.394\nthat was it folks.\n&gt;&gt; I'm impressed,\n\n29\n00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:17.375\nwell we're all going to get into\na little bit more of a Japanese lesson.\n\n30\n00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:21.962\nIn the first sort of few\nminutes of our episode now.\n\n31\n00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:23.580\nAnd in this particular episode.\n\n32\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.889\nIn our last episode,\n\n33\n00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:29.341\nwe looked at a couple of methodologies\nthat fall under the Agile banner.\n\n34\n00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.927\nAnd now we're gonna look at another\ntwo methodologies that fall under\n\n35\n00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:34.320\nthe Agile banner.\n\n36\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.810\nSo in our last episode we looked at Scrum\nand we looked at XP, X3 Programming.\n\n37\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.400\nAnd now we're going to look at Kanban and\nwe're also going to look at lean.\n\n38\n00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.060\nSo Kanban is Japanese, and\nit actually literally means visual board.\n\n39\n00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:56.725\nThere you go, that's it,\nthat's Kanban in a nutshell.\n\n40\n00:01:56.725 --> 00:01:58.745\nIt's a visual board.\n\n41\n00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:03.715\nWe have been talking about the application\nof Agile methodologies and\n\n42\n00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:08.835\nabout the application of some of our\nother principles as well including iTELL.\n\n43\n00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:11.375\nAnd one of the conversations\nthat we've had is just how\n\n44\n00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.115\napplicable this is in the real world.\n\n45\n00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:16.775\nWe can step this outside of IT.\n\n46\n00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:21.820\nAnd we can use these principles to\napply to many other projects that\n\n47\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.490\njust don't necessarily have\nanything to do with IT.\n\n48\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.570\nAnd this is very true, and\n\n49\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.960\nthis is one of those methodologies that we\ncan most definitely take outside of IT.\n\n50\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.310\nThis is an agile methodology, and\nit is based on the agile principles,\n\n51\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.690\nthere's 12 agile principles,\nand the agile values.\n\n52\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.410\nBut its focus is on simplicity.\n\n53\n00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.520\nIts focus is on just getting the job done,\nbut\n\n54\n00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.850\nin as easy a way as possible,\nkeeping things simple.\n\n55\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.490\nSo we don't have any prescribed roles,\nwhich is not something that\n\n56\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.990\nwe've looked at really in depth in any\nof the other Agile methodologies either.\n\n57\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.740\nWe want to ensure that we can detect and\nresolve any bottlenecks,\n\n58\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.700\nas quickly as we possibly can,\nand as early as we possibly can.\n\n59\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.580\nThe focus is on sort of a continual\nflow of just in time delivery.\n\n60\n00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.780\nThe focus is on eliminating waste.\n\n61\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.604\nIt's eliminating, it's being efficient.\n\n62\n00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.638\nAnd efficiency means minimal waste.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n63\n00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:31.360\n&gt;&gt; Now, interestingly enough, Muda, and\n\n64\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.180\nI don't know whether I'm\npronouncing that right.\n\n65\n00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.030\nSo Muda is the Japanese word for waste.\n\n66\n00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.420\nAnd, you know,\nI mention that because that has some\n\n67\n00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.950\ninfluence on our next methodology,\nand our next methodology that\n\n68\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.750\nwe're going to look at is Lean.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n69\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.230\n&gt;&gt; And we talk about mudah in mean\n\n70\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.550\nas well.\n\n71\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.936\nSo, Kanban as I've already said\nliterally means just a visual board,\n\n72\n00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:59.001\nand here is an example of a Kanban board.\n\n73\n00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.200\nAnd really, look at that,\ntalk about keeping it simple.\n\n74\n00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.146\nThis is, well, it's just a board.\n\n75\n00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:10.610\nAnd it's split into, we've got three\nbusiness units, or three tasks.\n\n76\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.860\nWe've got our to-do list,\nwe've got our in progress list, and\n\n77\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.440\nwe've got our done list.\n\n78\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.670\nAnd that's it.\n\n79\n00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.220\nThat's our Kanban Board.\n\n80\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.932\nNothing elaborate about that at all.\n\n81\n00:04:22.932 --> 00:04:28.069\nYou see, in Kanban timebox development,\nwhich is something\n\n82\n00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:33.417\nthat we have within Scrum, well,\ntimebox development is out.\n\n83\n00:04:33.417 --> 00:04:38.606\nSo our stories, our user stories, in\nother words what we're actually trying to\n\n84\n00:04:38.606 --> 00:04:44.790\ndevelop is, well, larger, we've got less\nstories, because they're larger stories.\n\n85\n00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.034\nNow in Scrum, what we're trying\nto achieve is small stories.\n\n86\n00:04:49.034 --> 00:04:53.274\nWe're trying especially in XP,\nin extreme programming,\n\n87\n00:04:53.274 --> 00:05:00.020\nwe're trying to achieve very small stories\nthat are released every one to two weeks.\n\n88\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.220\nHere, we're at the other end of the scale\nwhere our stories are larger and\n\n89\n00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.580\nwe have less of them.\n\n90\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.540\nWhich means that we're quite\noften releasing, well,\n\n91\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.940\nwe're releasing larger developments.\n\n92\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.224\nWe're releasing more functionality.\n\n93\n00:05:16.224 --> 00:05:18.934\nSo estimation is an option within Kanban,\nand\n\n94\n00:05:18.934 --> 00:05:22.067\nestimation is quite often\njust omitted completely.\n\n95\n00:05:22.067 --> 00:05:27.500\nSo we're not estimating exactly when\nwe're going to be doing something.\n\n96\n00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.450\nWe don't have velocity,\n\n97\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.960\nwhich is something that we're going to\nlook at in one of our other episodes.\n\n98\n00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.840\nWe have what we call cycle time.\n\n99\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.390\nAnd as we've already said, there are no\nprescribed roles when it comes to Kanban.\n\n100\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.140\nAnd that is Kanban in a nutshell.\n\n101\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.570\nWe don't have too much more to say to\nthat, it's one of those methodologies,\n\n102\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.840\nwhere I wouldn't say that it is\nwidely used in the Western world.\n\n103\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.375\nIt is still an Agile methodology,\nbut it really focuses on simplicity.\n\n104\n00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:03.270\nAnd so Kanban, I would say,\nwould be used for\n\n105\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.593\nthe very simple implementations.\n&gt;&gt; When I was originally learning about\n\n106\n00:06:09.593 --> 00:06:15.866\nproject and process management, I believe\nit was more for manufacturing industries.\n\n107\n00:06:15.866 --> 00:06:19.985\nThat really where you see\nthat the most being utilized.\n\n108\n00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:20.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah,\n\n109\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.229\nit's something that has been used in IT.\n\n110\n00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:27.991\nAnd I have seen it used, but\nit is really for It's almost as though\n\n111\n00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:33.620\nit's a stepping stone from Agile\ninto the waterfall approach.\n\n112\n00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.650\nIn other words it's quite simple but\nit incorporates larger projects,\n\n113\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.720\nit incorporates larger\ndevelopment initiatives.\n\n114\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.510\nBut, it's a simple way of managing\na project as opposed to utilizing\n\n115\n00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.690\na huge waterfall approach like PRINCE2 or\nPMI for instance.\n\n116\n00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.056\nAnd as you say,\nit comes from manufacturing.\n\n117\n00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:58.366\nAnd that's exactly where it really\nhas been at its most useful.\n\n118\n00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.495\nBut we started to see it creep into IT.\n\n119\n00:07:00.495 --> 00:07:05.299\nAnd so we'll use this as\nan Agile methodology because\n\n120\n00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:08.830\nthe Kanban Board I find really useful.\n\n121\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.620\nAnd in fact I would always recommend, and\n\n122\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.690\nwe'll talk about this more\nwhen we get into our Agile.\n\n123\n00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.520\nWhen we get into our activities within\nAgile, but we'll talk about the boards and\n\n124\n00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.010\nhow useful they really are.\n\n125\n00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.360\nIt's that snapshot,\nit's where we are right now.\n\n126\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.443\n&gt;&gt; And look, you'll be gettin' her done.\n\n127\n00:07:26.443 --> 00:07:27.345\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n128\n00:07:27.345 --> 00:07:28.188\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:07:28.188 --> 00:07:28.900\n&gt;&gt; And if you're not\n\n130\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.132\ntoo sure about that joke [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Bad joke you'll have to go\n\n131\n00:07:31.132 --> 00:07:33.083\nback to another episode.\n&gt;&gt; Go back to another episode.\n\n132\n00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:35.007\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n133\n00:07:35.007 --> 00:07:37.607\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look then at Lean,\n\n134\n00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:42.450\nand Lean is another Agile methodology and\nI know that Cherokee is\n\n135\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.150\nquite familiar with Lean, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, yeah.\n\n136\n00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.213\nWe've gotten better, faster,\nand more cost effective.\n\n137\n00:07:49.213 --> 00:07:49.884\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n138\n00:07:49.884 --> 00:07:53.976\nthat Lean really focuses on\nthe elimination of waste.\n\n139\n00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:59.282\nIn previous episodes, I've talked about\neliminating unnecessary documentation,\n\n140\n00:07:59.282 --> 00:08:03.216\nand I've talked about eliminating\nunnecessary programming.\n\n141\n00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:05.610\nOnly develop what is needed And\n\n142\n00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.920\ndon't develop enhanced features\nif they are not needed.\n\n143\n00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.600\nAnd in Lean, we also look at\nefficient processes as well.\n\n144\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.499\nSo Lean as a development methodology\nactually comes from sort of six sigma and\n\n145\n00:08:22.499 --> 00:08:25.130\nLean production principles.\n\n146\n00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.440\nAnd it's just really\nfocusing on efficiency.\n\n147\n00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.170\nSo it's about expenditure\nof our resources and\n\n148\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:38.170\nhow we use our resources rather\nthan just about delivering value.\n\n149\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.950\nWe don't want to be wasteful.\n\n150\n00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.975\nWe want to eliminate waste.\n\n151\n00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:44.915\nSo, we still want to deliver value,\n\n152\n00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:48.495\nbecause bearing in mind this is\nwhat all about projects are about.\n\n153\n00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:51.705\nIt's about delivering value\nto our customers, but\n\n154\n00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:54.165\nwe want to do it in a way\nthat eliminates waste.\n\n155\n00:08:54.165 --> 00:08:58.540\nWe want to do it in a way that we\ntake away unnecessary documentation.\n\n156\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.920\nWe take away unnecessary bureaucracy,\nand unnecessary red tape, and\n\n157\n00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.080\nanything that's not bringing that value.\n\n158\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.430\nLike waste can come in many forms,\njust, down time, rework.\n\n159\n00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.350\nYou kind of have to train your brain\nto think a little bit differently,\n\n160\n00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.900\nnot just like excess product and\nthrowing it into the garbage,\n\n161\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.800\nbut waste,\nlooking at it with an open mindset there.\n\n162\n00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.984\nLet's take your laptop that you have\nin front of you right now, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:25.984 --> 00:09:30.872\nIf we were to use, I don't know,\nI think it's generally accepted,\n\n164\n00:09:30.872 --> 00:09:35.570\nMicrosoft Outlook, all right,\nas your email service.\n\n165\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.060\nDo you use every single\nfeature in Microsoft Outlook?\n\n166\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.888\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n\n167\n00:09:38.888 --> 00:09:39.461\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n168\n00:09:39.461 --> 00:09:42.125\ndo you even know every single\nfeature is in Microsoft Outlook?\n\n169\n00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.493\n&gt;&gt; I’m going to go with a no on that one.\n\n170\n00:09:43.493 --> 00:09:47.374\n[LAUGH] And I'm gonna hold my hands up and\nsay I’m exactly the same.\n\n171\n00:09:47.374 --> 00:09:49.660\nI think it's exactly the same\nas with any Office product.\n\n172\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.946\nI have seen some complex,\n\n173\n00:09:52.946 --> 00:09:57.654\ncomplex financial spreadsheets\nout there in the real world.\n\n174\n00:09:57.654 --> 00:10:01.088\nAnd yet as far as I'm concerned\nwhen it comes to Excel I can manage\n\n175\n00:10:01.088 --> 00:10:04.839\nto add two cells together, I know I\nneed to see Vaughn though on this one\n\n176\n00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:05.647\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n177\n00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:08.120\nthat's my point of contact also.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n178\n00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.623\nthat goes [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n179\n00:10:08.623 --> 00:10:11.620\nVaughn is another entertainer\nhere at ITPro TV.\n\n180\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.648\nCheck out her Excel shows if you haven't,\nmind blowing.\n\n181\n00:10:14.648 --> 00:10:15.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n182\n00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n183\n00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.060\nI need to catch up with her\nas well because I can tell,\n\n184\n00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.760\nI cannot use Excel to\nits fullest potential.\n\n185\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.800\nAnd this is what Lean\ndevelopment looks at.\n\n186\n00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.880\nIt looks at the customer and\nsays right, but what are you gonna use?\n\n187\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.510\nWhat is it that you want it for?\n\n188\n00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.450\nAnd I'm only going to\ndevelop what's needed\n\n189\n00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.560\nrather than develop what's not needed.\n\n190\n00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.120\nAnd I use Excel as an example because it's\n\n191\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.581\nperfect example of\neverything that I don't use.\n\n192\n00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:47.903\n[LAUGH] And probably Vaughn will look\nat my spreadsheets that I have and\n\n193\n00:10:47.903 --> 00:10:52.140\nhave a heart attack if she saw them,\nbut you know what?\n\n194\n00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.400\nIt works for me.\n\n195\n00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.800\nAnd it also involves understanding\nthat when you're developing\n\n196\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.760\nsoftware you have to get\nto know your customer.\n\n197\n00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.050\nBecause I'm pretty certain that I\ndon't use Excel in the way that it's\n\n198\n00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.290\ndesigned to be used.\n\n199\n00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.830\nI use Excel in the way it was\ndesigned to be used 20 years ago but\n\n200\n00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.758\nI don't use Excel in the way\nit's designed to be used now.\n\n201\n00:11:13.758 --> 00:11:18.360\nBut somebody developing a product for\nme needs to know how I work.\n\n202\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.660\nBecause otherwise they're gonna be wasting\ntime, yeah, it's not lean, they're\n\n203\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.520\ngonna be wasting time developing features\nthat I'm never even gonna look at.\n\n204\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.860\n&gt;&gt; You may not even know exist, exactly.\n\n205\n00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n206\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.190\nExactly.\n\n207\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.480\nThe other thing that Lean\ndoes is it eliminates sort of\n\n208\n00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.500\nfluctuations in quality and\nfluctuations in the deliverable.\n\n209\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.680\nBy really focusing on our way of working,\nmaking us more efficient.\n\n210\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.388\nSo in previous sessions,\nin previous episodes,\n\n211\n00:11:49.388 --> 00:11:54.787\nwe've looked at the fact that we don't\nwanna bring in too much process.\n\n212\n00:11:54.787 --> 00:11:58.480\nWe don't wanna bring in\ntoo much documentation.\n\n213\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.080\n&gt;&gt; No, you don't wanna overwork and\n\n214\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.000\nover process something.\n&gt;&gt; But we still wanna process.\n\n215\n00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.830\nAnd that process has got to be lean,\nit's got to be efficient.\n\n216\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.160\nWe've got to try and reduce\nthe fluctuations in our deliverable,\n\n217\n00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.250\nthe fluctuations in our output.\n\n218\n00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.430\nAnd we've got to be efficient.\n\n219\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.875\nSo we still need to have\nprocesses in place.\n\n220\n00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:20.475\nIt's just got to be efficient processes.\n\n221\n00:12:20.475 --> 00:12:25.752\nWe've already talked about our Mudha but\nyeah.\n\n222\n00:12:25.752 --> 00:12:30.527\nOkay, I apologize if it's the wrong\nway I'm pronouncing it because yeah,\n\n223\n00:12:30.527 --> 00:12:31.506\nI don't know.\n\n224\n00:12:31.506 --> 00:12:33.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well don't look to me to correct you\n\n225\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.320\non that one, because I'm not sure either.\n&gt;&gt; Because it's\n\n226\n00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.160\ngot nothing to do with Disney.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n227\n00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.380\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n228\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.890\nthere are seven areas of waste\nthat we should actually eliminate.\n\n229\n00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.520\nAnd so anything that's been partially\ncompleted, why did you do it?\n\n230\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.140\nI don't know, seems like a simple\nquestion, but why did you do it?\n\n231\n00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.520\nIf you're not gonna finish it,\n\n232\n00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.410\nthen why start it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, there's also the idea of,\n\n233\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.520\nwith that rigid structure,\nwhat if the project does change?\n\n234\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.686\nWhen there's no need?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so\n\n235\n00:13:04.686 --> 00:13:08.257\nonly start what you're going to finish.\n\n236\n00:13:08.257 --> 00:13:11.390\nIf you're not going to finish\nit then don't start it.\n\n237\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.419\nThere are the things that I like, I mean,\n\n238\n00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:18.595\nwe know about additional features,\nbut re-learning.\n\n239\n00:13:18.595 --> 00:13:23.095\nThink back to previous episode where we\ntalk about efficiencies, and we talk about\n\n240\n00:13:23.095 --> 00:13:27.795\nworking as a team, a collaborative team\nwhere we've all got our own skills.\n\n241\n00:13:30.005 --> 00:13:36.855\nI mentioned earlier on that in a previous\nepisode, that Cherokee has got her MCSA.\n\n242\n00:13:36.855 --> 00:13:38.965\nI've got mine too, but that was a long,\n\n243\n00:13:38.965 --> 00:13:42.790\nlong time ago and\nthere's no way that mine is up to date.\n\n244\n00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.194\nNo way, [LAUGH] It's old.\n&gt;&gt; But technically,\n\n245\n00:13:44.194 --> 00:13:45.993\nthey don't expire, Jill.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.\n\n246\n00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:48.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n247\n00:13:48.308 --> 00:13:51.232\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, but my brain cells do.\n\n248\n00:13:51.232 --> 00:13:54.070\n[LAUGH] And that's the big problem here.\n\n249\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:59.240\nBut nevertheless, I mean, it might not\nexpire but I am not going to waste\n\n250\n00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.430\nmy time re-learning all of this when\nI've got Cherokee standing next to me.\n\n251\n00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:09.410\nBecause it's going to take me potentially\nyears to re-learn all of that sort of\n\n252\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.270\nstuff whereas Cherokee's got\nit in her head right now and\n\n253\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.030\nI can ask her a question.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n254\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.696\nI am so glad you have all\nthis confidence in me, Jill.\n\n255\n00:14:18.696 --> 00:14:19.317\n[LAUGH] Well, I do.\n\n256\n00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:22.970\nBut this is down to collaboration.\n\n257\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.520\nIt is down to understanding\nwho your team members are and\n\n258\n00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.150\nwhat their skills are and\nwhat their strengths are and acceptance.\n\n259\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.680\nAnd I talked in previous\nepisodes about objectivity.\n\n260\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.360\nAnd it really is about that acceptance and\nthat objective viewpoint.\n\n261\n00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.860\nThat certain people have got certain\nskills and that's what we want to utilize.\n\n262\n00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.857\nAnd that will mean that we can be\nefficient in our hand-offs and\n\n263\n00:14:47.857 --> 00:14:53.832\nin our hand overs, because we've got\nthe right person doing the right job.\n\n264\n00:14:53.832 --> 00:14:59.020\nAnd we're not wasting time teaching skills\nto people that don't need certain skills.\n\n265\n00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.540\nNow something else that I wanna\ndraw your attention to is the tasks\n\n266\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.950\nswitching if I could\neven manage to say it.\n\n267\n00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.731\nI have to admit to being guilty of\nthis one myself and I need to learn my\n\n268\n00:15:14.731 --> 00:15:18.365\nown principles really because I-\n&gt;&gt; Is it the whole squirrel thing?\n\n269\n00:15:18.365 --> 00:15:20.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n270\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.461\nI do this all the time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n271\n00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:24.586\n&gt;&gt; And we talk about being distracted on\n\n272\n00:15:24.586 --> 00:15:26.100\nhere with social media.\n\n273\n00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.940\nYeah, the tasks switching.\n\n274\n00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.650\nI started on this, but now I'm\ngonna go and do something else, and\n\n275\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.190\nnow I'm gonna go and do something else.\n\n276\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:42.020\nTime management really is important\nwhen we talk about Lean development.\n\n277\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.430\nAnd I have talked about\nthis in previous episodes.\n\n278\n00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.562\nBut we have a time of day when\nwe are at our most productive.\n\n279\n00:15:48.562 --> 00:15:52.879\nAnd that is when we should be\ndoing those challenging tasks,\n\n280\n00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:54.919\nthe ones that make us think.\n\n281\n00:15:54.919 --> 00:15:59.300\nAnd then bring in lean principles, and\nwe don't want to partially complete it.\n\n282\n00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.054\nSo we complete that task The tasks that\ndon't make us think, that aren't so\n\n283\n00:16:04.054 --> 00:16:08.607\nchallenging, are the ones that we\nshould do at our own productive time.\n\n284\n00:16:08.607 --> 00:16:13.844\nAnd we shouldn't jump between the two or\nthree or four different tasks because\n\n285\n00:16:13.844 --> 00:16:19.350\nevery time you jump, you're starting\nagain, a little bit further behind.\n\n286\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.090\nYou have to relearn something\nthat you've already done.\n\n287\n00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.080\nYou have to maybe catch up,\n\n288\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.760\nas you might want to say, with where\nyou were with a particular task.\n\n289\n00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.560\nSo yeah, don't do it.\n\n290\n00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.770\nSimple, just don't do it.\n\n291\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.782\nSo what principles do we have within Lean?\n\n292\n00:16:36.782 --> 00:16:40.490\nWell, we've already talked about\neliminating waste, such as unnecessary\n\n293\n00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:46.250\ncode, unnecessary documentation,\nand I like the inadequate testing.\n\n294\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.420\nThat doesn't mean don't test,\nwhat it means is don't waste\n\n295\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.195\nyour time testing something\nthat is not going to be used.\n\n296\n00:16:56.195 --> 00:17:00.180\nDon't waste your time testing\nfunctionality that you haven't yet\n\n297\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:05.940\ndeveloped or\nthat is still in the design parameters or\n\n298\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.655\nin that particular frame\nof that iteration.\n\n299\n00:17:09.655 --> 00:17:13.590\nDon't waste your time with testing\nwhat you don't need to test.\n\n300\n00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.790\nBut also, if you don't test fully,\nthen as it says,\n\n301\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.700\ninadequate testing means\nthat you're gonna have to\n\n302\n00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.590\nmake changes in the production\nenvironment, in that live environment.\n\n303\n00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.520\nSo make sure you test enough, but\n\n304\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.400\ndon't test those features\nthat you're not releasing.\n\n305\n00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:40.248\nAmplifying learning, really well,\nit's involving our costumer,\n\n306\n00:17:40.248 --> 00:17:44.124\nand it's short iterations where we learn,\n\n307\n00:17:44.124 --> 00:17:47.910\nand we grow based on previous iterations.\n\n308\n00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.511\nSo we grow our learning as\nwe grow our iterations,\n\n309\n00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:54.270\nas we release more then we learn more.\n\n310\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.965\nDeciding late, I like the fact that it\ntells you a better decision will be\n\n311\n00:18:00.965 --> 00:18:05.678\nreached, and uncertainty reduced,\nif you make your decisions as to\n\n312\n00:18:05.678 --> 00:18:11.200\nwhether you're going to say release or\nnot later on in the actual process.\n\n313\n00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.004\nIf you decide earlier on,\n\n314\n00:18:13.004 --> 00:18:18.670\nyou kind of put yourself under some\nunnecessary pressures, should we say.\n\n315\n00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.962\nYou make a decision very, very early on\nin the iteration, and this is where our\n\n316\n00:18:21.962 --> 00:18:26.090\nmistakes lie, in that you'll decide that\nright, this is what we're going to program\n\n317\n00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.900\nin this particular iteration, and\nthat's it, it's cast in stone.\n\n318\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.880\nBut then you put yourself under pressure,\nand you realize that actually,\n\n319\n00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.110\nwe're one week into this, and\nwe're not going to get this delivered.\n\n320\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.070\nBut we've already made the decision, and\n\n321\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.740\nwe've already promised the customer\nthat that's what they're going to get.\n\n322\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.085\nSo you have to deliver it.\n\n323\n00:18:44.085 --> 00:18:46.160\nYou've put yourself under pressure.\n\n324\n00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.600\nSo make the decision as to\nwhat you're going to release\n\n325\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.880\nlater on because that allows for-\n&gt;&gt; Some\n\n326\n00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.470\nflexibility.\n&gt;&gt; Flexibility, right, which is one of\n\n327\n00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.960\ncourse, of those agile principles.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n328\n00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.090\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what we want.\n\n329\n00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.010\n&gt;&gt; You can see that relationship here.\n\n330\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.741\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, definitely.\n\n331\n00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:06.599\nI mean, and I've already said, Lean is\none of the agile methodologies, and\n\n332\n00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:10.460\nit really does,\nit promotes agile brilliantly.\n\n333\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:16.920\nSo deliver fast, well, you don't want to\nspend three weeks just deploying, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.470\nThe idea is of an iteration,\nand a release,\n\n335\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.032\nis that we develop, and we release.\n\n336\n00:19:23.032 --> 00:19:26.700\nAnd then,\nwe move on to the next user story.\n\n337\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.010\n&gt;&gt; Better, faster, more cost effective.\n\n338\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.260\nI can't tell you how many times\nI heard that during my training\n\n339\n00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.250\nbacause that's really what it\nall stand for here with Lean.\n\n340\n00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n341\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.271\nwe've gotta bring in that better,\nas well ,right?\n\n342\n00:19:38.271 --> 00:19:40.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not just faster,\n\n343\n00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.220\nand more cost effective,\n\n344\n00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.560\nyou gotta have all three there.\n&gt;&gt; Fast,\n\n345\n00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.930\nand cheap, but\nwe don't care about the quality, right?\n\n346\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:46.600\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n348\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.350\nother principles that\nare about team empowerment for\n\n349\n00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:55.330\ninstance, I've talked about having\nthe right people doing the right job.\n\n350\n00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.850\nAnd we've also talked, in previous\nepisodes, about self organization as well.\n\n351\n00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.350\nAbout understanding who's got what skills.\n\n352\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.130\nAnd again,\nthink about that daily stand up meeting,\n\n353\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.460\nwhere we don't specifically\nmention that in Lean development.\n\n354\n00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.515\nBut the daily standup meeting\nthat we utilize in scrum,\n\n355\n00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:17.620\nwhere we can all talk about what we\nwant to achieve during the next day.\n\n356\n00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.395\nAnd we can talk about what\nchallenges we perceive happening,\n\n357\n00:20:21.395 --> 00:20:24.590\nwhat challenges we might've\nhad the previous day,\n\n358\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.510\nso that then we can bring in other\npeople with the right skills.\n\n359\n00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.700\nGives opportunity for other people to say,\nhey look, I can help you with that.\n\n360\n00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.900\nWe should have direct access\nto our customers as well.\n\n361\n00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.880\nRemember, you are delivering for them.\n\n362\n00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:47.250\nNow, building in integrity, that means\nthat we don't want to bring in failures.\n\n363\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.760\nWe want to build in\nsomething that is resilient.\n\n364\n00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.210\nWe've got to make sure that all the\ncomponents actually work well together.\n\n365\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:00.180\nWe want to use automated\ntesting where we can, but\n\n366\n00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.790\nwe wanna make sure that we test fully.\n\n367\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:07.650\nAnd if we're going to automate testing,\nwe've got to make sure that there is\n\n368\n00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.450\nsome form of customer check at\nthe end of the testing that says, yes,\n\n369\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.880\nI accept this, an acceptance test.\n\n370\n00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:19.727\nBecause otherwise, we could automate\nabsolutely anything that we want, and\n\n371\n00:21:19.727 --> 00:21:23.030\nwe could say that everything delivers\nwhat it's supposed to deliver.\n\n372\n00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:23.858\nAnd it might not actually deliver-\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n373\n00:21:23.858 --> 00:21:24.903\n&gt;&gt; Deliver any value, right?\n\n374\n00:21:24.903 --> 00:21:27.227\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:21:27.227 --> 00:21:29.726\n&gt;&gt; And one of the main principles to Lean\n\n376\n00:21:29.726 --> 00:21:32.790\ndevelopment is to see the whole.\n\n377\n00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:37.586\nUnderstand your relationships between all\nof our teams, between our developers,\n\n378\n00:21:37.586 --> 00:21:42.420\nbetween our developers,\nand our operations guys,\n\n379\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:47.740\nbetween the components of our solutions,\nbetween us, and our customers.\n\n380\n00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.180\nSee the big picture.\n\n381\n00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.680\nAnd I don't really like using sort of\nbuzz words, and phrases like that, but\n\n382\n00:21:53.680 --> 00:22:00.160\nyou have to see the project as a whole,\nyou have to see the iteration as a whole.\n\n383\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.340\nAnd what was it you said about lower cost,\nand\n\n384\n00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.360\ndo it quickly?\n&gt;&gt; Better, faster,\n\n385\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.560\nmore cost effective.\n&gt;&gt; Better, faster, more cost effective.\n\n386\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.341\nSo we've got think big, act small,\nfail fast, and learn rapidly,\n\n387\n00:22:13.341 --> 00:22:14.732\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Trial by fire.\n\n388\n00:22:14.732 --> 00:22:18.084\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all about understanding the big\n\n389\n00:22:18.084 --> 00:22:22.496\npicture, but understanding how your\nindividual coding, as it were,\n\n390\n00:22:22.496 --> 00:22:24.950\ncontributes to the big picture.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n391\n00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:25.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n392\n00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.370\nfailing fast means that if\nyou're going to get it wrong,\n\n393\n00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.470\nget it wrong in the early stages.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh ok.\n\n394\n00:22:31.488 --> 00:22:32.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fail fast,\n\n395\n00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.430\nand then do something about it, which is\nwhere the learn rapidly comes in to it.\n\n396\n00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.500\nGet it wrong in the early stages,\nand then,\n\n397\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.937\ndo something about it.\n&gt;&gt; Jo,\n\n398\n00:22:39.937 --> 00:22:45.369\nI know you're not big on social media, but\nrecently Will Smith joined social media,\n\n399\n00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:47.898\nand he's been posting.\n&gt;&gt; I'm supposed to be excited,\n\n400\n00:22:47.898 --> 00:22:48.501\nI'm not too sure.\n\n401\n00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:50.760\nJust wait, after the show I'm\ngonna show you some videos.\n\n402\n00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.665\nBut he's been posting some\nreally good ones, and\n\n403\n00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:56.232\nfailure was a topic that\nhe did really good.\n\n404\n00:22:56.232 --> 00:23:00.616\nYou guys should check it out, but\nit explains how important failure is, and\n\n405\n00:23:00.616 --> 00:23:02.410\nfailing fast does make sense.\n\n406\n00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.960\nMaybe we should email Will Smith,\n\n407\n00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.750\nmaybe he'll collaborate with us.\n&gt;&gt; After fail fast is\n\n408\n00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:09.870\nlearn rapidly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n409\n00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.960\n&gt;&gt; You don't learn if you don't\n\n410\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.530\nfail.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n411\n00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.001\n&gt;&gt; You're not actually learning anything\n\n412\n00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:13.610\nunless we fail.\n\n413\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.265\nSo we have to accept that our projects\nare going to fail because they are,\n\n414\n00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:18.620\nsomething's gonna go wrong.\n\n415\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.160\nBut we wanna make sure that we can\npick up the pieces when it does.\n\n416\n00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.690\nSo in these last two episodes then,\nwe've looked at some agile methodologies.\n\n417\n00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.970\nThere are other methodologies out there\nin the big wide world that conform to\n\n418\n00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.690\nagile principles, but\nthey're for another show.\n\n419\n00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:40.990\nIn this particular series we've just taken\na very quick look at those methodologies.\n\n420\n00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.830\nAnd when we come back, we are actually\ngoing to look at the lifecycle\n\n421\n00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.910\nof an agile project.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that was an amazing show.\n\n422\n00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.130\nThank you so much for your time today,\nJo, and thank you for your time also.\n\n423\n00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.940\nBut we are out of time, so we'll sign out.\n\n424\n00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.390\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n425\n00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.544\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n426\n00:23:59.544 --> 00:24:04.658\n[MUSIC]\n\n427\n00:24:04.658 --> 00:24:07.080\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.690\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.640\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look at\nvision and scope, and of course with us\n\n7\n00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.390\ntoday in studio we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock to help define those terms.\n\n8\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.560\nHow's it going, Jo?\n\n9\n00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.730\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.470\nHow are you?\n\n11\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.220\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, I have a bit of\na bad hair day, but you know what,\n\n12\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.000\nwe're not going to let that stop us today.\n\n13\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.067\nWell, I don't know it might\nstop me actually, it might.\n\n14\n00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:40.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One of those days today I think, yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.180\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna persevere and I think you\nknow maybe we should even talk about\n\n16\n00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.990\na little bit about a vision, what it is.\n\n17\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.740\nMaybe our vision could be like,\nthe perfect hairstyle.\n\n18\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.610\n&gt;&gt; Is there such a thing?\n\n19\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.080\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n20\n00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.830\nIs there?\n\n21\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I haven't found one yet.\n\n22\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.280\n&gt;&gt; Do we even care that much?\n\n23\n00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.530\n&gt;&gt; No, I've given up.\n\n24\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.470\nLike they say, you get to a certain age,\nyou just give up.\n\n25\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.270\n&gt;&gt; So then what kind of visions\nare we really looking at here?\n\n26\n00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're gonna look at\nin this particular episode is,\n\n27\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.190\nwe have looked in previous\nepisodes at Agile.\n\n28\n00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.229\nAnd the very basic Agile life cycle.\n\n29\n00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.990\nWe've looked at the principles of Agile\nand we've looked at the values of Agile.\n\n30\n00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.750\nFor a moment, in this episode we're\ngoing to look at the vision and\n\n31\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.460\nwe're going to look at the vision\nstatement and the problem, and\n\n32\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.820\nthe problem statement and\nthe scope of an Agile project.\n\n33\n00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.930\nBut for now what I really wanna us to do\nis just to have, what I'm gonna call this?\n\n34\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.480\nI'm gonna call this a very sort of\ncommon sense discussion about Agile.\n\n35\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.160\nIt's funny how Agile can be brought\ninto so many different concepts and so\n\n36\n00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.810\nmany different industries.\n\n37\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.560\nIt's not just about IT.\n\n38\n00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.810\nIt's not just about IT\nproject management either.\n\n39\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.790\nAnd in fact, just this morning,\nI was talking to somebody,\n\n40\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.340\non a completely unrelated subject.\n\n41\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.130\nAnd I'd be talking about,\nAgile Principles, and\n\n42\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.910\nthe fact that we want to\ndo things in iteration.\n\n43\n00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.980\nAnd so what I really wanna do is just\nemphasize how important Agile is\n\n44\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.395\nas a project management methodology.\n\n45\n00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:17.390\nBut as a concept for\njust day-to-day business.\n\n46\n00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.160\nWe've mentioned in previous episodes that\nhere on ITPRO.TV, we have daily stand ups.\n\n47\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.290\nAnd every single morning, we stand up and\nactually stand up and we'll\n\n48\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.310\ntalk about this in another episode about\nhow we stand up because it keep it short.\n\n49\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.810\nWe're actually stand up and\nwe go around the office and\n\n50\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.990\nwe just all say exactly\nwhat we're going to do,\n\n51\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.360\nwhat we're planning on doing for\nthe day and how important that is.\n\n52\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.280\nAnd then it gives the opportunity for\n\n53\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.612\nother people to sort of chime in and\ngive us some help or some advice.\n\n54\n00:02:50.612 --> 00:02:52.017\n[LAUGH] Or maybe tell us that-\n&gt;&gt; To make fun of us?\n\n55\n00:02:52.017 --> 00:02:53.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, to make fun of us.\n\n56\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.070\nSo maybe tell us that we\nshouldn't be doing something.\n\n57\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.920\nBut the stand up,\nthis is not at a particular project.\n\n58\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.940\nAnd yet we still doing daily stand ups.\n\n59\n00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.140\nAnd I will get us.\n\n60\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.020\nWhy do we used stand ups say in\na situation we don't have a project.\n\n61\n00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.450\nWell, because it makes\nsense both to do that.\n\n62\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.145\nWe work in a way,\nwe want to work in a way that's efficient.\n\n63\n00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.440\nAnd we can take our job principles and\n\n64\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.090\nwe can apply them to other\naspects of our work.\n\n65\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.200\nAnd even if we're not\nmanaging a specific project,\n\n66\n00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.450\nwe can apply that particular Agile concept\nbecause it allows us to interact and\n\n67\n00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.640\ncollaborate with our other team members.\n\n68\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.020\nAnd it's at that point in time where\nwe can highlight things like, look,\n\n69\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.950\nI've got an appointment throughout today.\n\n70\n00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.740\nI've got an important meeting.\n\n71\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.350\nI know I need somebody to stand in for me,\n\n72\n00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.390\nthat's what we'll do as\npart of the standup.\n\n73\n00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.100\nNow I think you mentioned\nthat in a previous episode\n\n74\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.270\nthat we've got a colleague that takes\nin all the reports to problem solving.\n\n75\n00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.350\n&gt;&gt; For the rock, paper, scissors?\n\n76\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n77\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n78\n00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:01.490\nDo you want to tell us\n\n79\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.560\na little bit about that?\n\n80\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Gosh,\nwe really need to get him on this show.\n\n81\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.370\nRob, if you're listening, yeah, so.\n\n82\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.957\n&gt;&gt; Get in here.\n\n83\n00:04:06.957 --> 00:04:08.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n84\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.390\nNo, when they're trying to\nestimate time frames for\n\n85\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.330\ndifferent stories that they're working on,\nthey will go like one, two, three shoot.\n\n86\n00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.590\nAnd of course it's not like a scissors but\nit means like two hours for\n\n87\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.530\nthis estimated like the estimation for\nthat project or story completion.\n\n88\n00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.640\nBut then if someone else think it will\ntake five hours then they're gonna say,\n\n89\n00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.790\nwhat's going on here?\n\n90\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.230\nDoes this person just not know how to\ndo this or end I'm, It just brings\n\n91\n00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.370\nawareness to the situations, I guess,\nwhen they're trying to task things out.\n\n92\n00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it sounds like it's just\nsomething that's a little bit of fun.\n\n93\n00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.750\nAnd it is a little bit of fun, but-\n&gt;&gt; We can do it now, if you want.\n\n94\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.299\n&gt;&gt; In what respect?\n\n95\n00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:52.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just for fun.\n\n96\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.893\n&gt;&gt; What are we trying to prioritize here?\n\n97\n00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:58.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Prioritize whether I'm more important\n\n98\n00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.366\nthan she is-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:00.968\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're prioritizing, right?\n\n100\n00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:01.581\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:02.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I always\n\n102\n00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.252\nlose at that game anyway.\n\n103\n00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:05.231\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've never played it.\n\n104\n00:05:06.707 --> 00:05:09.488\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there's an admission live on air.\n\n105\n00:05:09.488 --> 00:05:11.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n106\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.410\nyou know what we're really doing there in\nthat instance is we're prioritizing, but\n\n107\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.170\nwe're doing it in a fun way that\neveryone wants to participate in.\n\n108\n00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.120\nYou imagine if you called a meeting and\nsaid,\n\n109\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.360\nokay, we're gonna have a meeting every day\nor we're gonna have a meeting every week.\n\n110\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.670\nWhere we're going to prioritize\nall of our outstanding activities.\n\n111\n00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.090\nYou mentioned the word stories, and\n\n112\n00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.030\nI'm gonna get on to stories\nin another episode.\n\n113\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.730\nBut for now,\nlet's just think about them as activities.\n\n114\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.420\nIf we had a meeting every day or\nevery week where\n\n115\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.040\nwe sat down around the table and\nwe prioritized all of our activities.\n\n116\n00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.635\n&gt;&gt; Boring.\n\n117\n00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:48.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, and\n\n118\n00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.450\nwhat about the attendance?\n\n119\n00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.070\n&gt;&gt; It might start to decline.\n\n120\n00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.480\n&gt;&gt; Might start to decline.\n\n121\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.640\n&gt;&gt; It might fall asleep.\n\n122\n00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.200\nI don't know.\n\n123\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nI mean I\n\n124\n00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.400\ndon't think it' ever going to\nbe up to its most optimum.\n\n125\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.950\nIs it?\n\n126\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And yet\n\n127\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.380\nhaving five minutes worth of rock\npaper scissors or something similar.\n\n128\n00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.900\nOther prioritization means\nthat everybody's involved.\n\n129\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.900\nBecause everybody wants to be\ninvolved because it's a bit of fun.\n\n130\n00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.620\nBut we still actually get the job done or\nwhat is it, get it done or\n\n131\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.575\nwhatever you say.\n\n132\n00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:16.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.\n\n133\n00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.639\n&gt;&gt; You're learning, Jill.\n\n134\n00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I kinda wish I wasn't.\n\n135\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.740\n&gt;&gt; I know, right.\n\n136\n00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.020\n&gt;&gt; But we're getting the job done because\nwe prioritize in all of our tasks and\n\n137\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.360\nall of our activities whilst\nto having a bit of fun.\n\n138\n00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.230\nPhone.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n139\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Nobody said that managing a project or\n\n140\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.860\nmanaging any particular team or managing\nany particular work had to be boring.\n\n141\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.390\nAnd I think we get caught up\nsometimes especially in IT\n\n142\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.850\nin all of the nitty-gritty.\n\n143\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.580\nWe get caught up in the coding.\n\n144\n00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.210\nWe get caught up in\n\n145\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.720\nthe technical side of things-\n\n146\n00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.075\n&gt;&gt; Deadlines\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n147\n00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:54.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we forget that we're still people.\n\n148\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.630\nAnd we still need to what?\n\n149\n00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.410\nEnjoy what we do.\n\n150\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.160\nCuz if you don't enjoy what you do\nthen you're gonna start looking for\n\n151\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.690\nanother job.\n\n152\n00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.990\n&gt;&gt; And you're gonna burned out.\n\n153\n00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.650\n&gt;&gt; And that might seem trivial.\n\n154\n00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.180\nAnd I know that there's probably people\nthat they're looking at this right now and\n\n155\n00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.130\nthinking to themselves what's this\ngotta do with project management?\n\n156\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.145\nIt's got everything to do\nwith project management.\n\n157\n00:07:12.145 --> 00:07:14.810\nBecause this is about valuing your people.\n\n158\n00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.700\nAnd I can't stress this enough, and\nit's part of a lot of consultancy work\n\n159\n00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.460\nthat I do where I'll tell people, really,\n\n160\n00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.470\nthat your team are the most\nvaluable commodity that you have.\n\n161\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.910\nAnd if you don't value them, then your\nproject's gonna fail, it's really simple.\n\n162\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.180\n&gt;&gt; And something Tim likes to reiterate\nhere is if you take care of your team,\n\n163\n00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.150\nthey're gonna take care of your members,\nyour customers, or\n\n164\n00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.580\nwhomever it is you're looking to service.\n\n165\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nif you take care of your project team,\n\n166\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.870\nthen they're gonna deliver the work for\nyou.\n\n167\n00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.570\nIf you don't take care\nof your project team,\n\n168\n00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.650\nthen they're not going\nto deliver the work.\n\n169\n00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.140\nIf you don't look after your team, if you\ndon't show them that they're valuable,\n\n170\n00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.250\nif you don't provide them with certain\nthings that they need to do to their job\n\n171\n00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.140\nand make learning or\nmake their environment fun,\n\n172\n00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.190\nthen quite frankly they're\nnot gonna give you a 100%.\n\n173\n00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.190\nAnd those times when you do need a little\nbit more because you get into the end of\n\n174\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.400\nan iteration or\nget into the end of a sprint, those times\n\n175\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.060\nwhen you need that little bit more\nfrom them, they're not going to do it.\n\n176\n00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.300\nRemember, remember that we value people,\nand we value collaboration, and\n\n177\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.830\nwe value people over things\nlike contract negotiation.\n\n178\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.320\nIt's not what's about in\nyour contract of employment,\n\n179\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.690\nit's about the fact that we want to\nnurture an environment of collaboration,\n\n180\n00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.340\nand we want to nurture an environment\nwhere people, will, have fun.\n\n181\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.910\nWe see a lot of tech companies now,\n\n182\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.710\nand I think it's sort of spreading\ninto the non-tech arena, as well.\n\n183\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.530\nYou see a lot of tech companies\nwhere their environment so\n\n184\n00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.722\ncompletely different to anything\nelse that you've ever worked in.\n\n185\n00:08:54.722 --> 00:08:56.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think there's, is it Google?\n\n186\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.430\nTheir head offices have got\nkind of little pods in places.\n\n187\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It can take maps of certain areas.\n\n188\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.610\n&gt;&gt; This is great because you think\nabout productivity if you're tired.\n\n189\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:11.550\nTake a little nap you're energized instead\nof that person at five o'clock ready to go\n\n190\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.550\nhome to get ready for bed like just gives\na little bit of incentive to stay and\n\n191\n00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.460\nhang out and do things like that.\n\n192\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.010\nFun things like I think I had\nmentioned no I did not here but\n\n193\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.380\nlike we're getting a little robot\nhere in the office so that's fun, and\n\n194\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.680\nit's just something exciting\nto keep people engaged.\n\n195\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, and meetings don't have\nto take place around a table.\n\n196\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.840\nThey don't have to take\nplace in a meeting room.\n\n197\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.540\nThey don't have to take\nplace with a formal agenda.\n\n198\n00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.460\nYou walk into a meeting and you know\nwhat points you want to cover, but\n\n199\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.990\nthen there's no reason\nwhy you can't go and sit\n\n200\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.320\nin a cafeteria where you can go and sit\nin the garden, I'm American, I'm British.\n\n201\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.430\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n&gt;&gt; I'm British right?\n\n202\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.415\nWe don't have yards.\n\n203\n00:09:52.415 --> 00:09:54.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay we have gardens.\n\n204\n00:09:54.035 --> 00:09:56.130\n[LAUGH] It sounds nicer yeah?\n\n205\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nif you look at larger companies,\n\n206\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.000\neven like the Microsoft Campus\nit's gorgeous.\n\n207\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.070\nThey've got these beautiful cherry\ntrees and walking paths everywhere.\n\n208\n00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.940\nAnd so just even getting people up and\nmoving around,\n\n209\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.070\ngetting their blood flowing\njust creates and in certain\n\n210\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:16.390\nareas you feel like that energy and you\nfeel like people just wanting to excel.\n\n211\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:21.330\n&gt;&gt; There is a large company in UK that\nI spent a lot of time on site with\n\n212\n00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.610\nat there head office which\nis in the middle of London\n\n213\n00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.500\nactually which is the global head office.\n\n214\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.290\nHas a village on the,\nwell what I would call the ground floor,\n\n215\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.080\nwhat you would call the first floor.\n\n216\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.130\nAnd it has a complete village,\nand it has a hairdressing salon.\n\n217\n00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:43.090\nIt has a cycle shop where you\ncan get your cycles fixed and\n\n218\n00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.470\nwheels on your bike fixed.\n\n219\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.150\nIt has four different cafeterias.\n\n220\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.180\nIt has a coffee shop.\n\n221\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.820\nIt has convenience store.\n\n222\n00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.840\nIt has absolutely in there\nthat you could want.\n\n223\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.060\nYou can go and have a meeting with a\ncolleague while you're getting your nails\n\n224\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.155\ndone at the same time.\n\n225\n00:10:58.155 --> 00:10:59.535\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a dream.\n\n226\n00:10:59.535 --> 00:11:01.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Work's getting done.\n\n227\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n228\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:09.410\ndespite the fact that you could say yeah,\nwe're just having a conversation, but\n\n229\n00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.100\nthat's really important\nto the Agile environment.\n\n230\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.740\nIt's really important to the project.\n\n231\n00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.530\nWe've got deadlines and in an Agile\nenvironment we've got iterations that\n\n232\n00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.540\nwe've looked at in previous episodes.\n\n233\n00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.710\nWe've got iterations that last\nbetween one and four weeks.\n\n234\n00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.630\nIf you've got to deliver a piece of code,\nand you've got a deadline,\n\n235\n00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.000\nof say, two weeks to do that,\nand you're working in pairs.\n\n236\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.540\nWe've talked about paired programming,\nas well.\n\n237\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.370\nYou're working in pairs,\nyou've got two weeks to deliver something,\n\n238\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.850\nwouldn't it be great if you and\nI could go downstairs.\n\n239\n00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.440\nWe could go to the nail bar,\nand we could sit\n\n240\n00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.290\nnext to each other while we were both\ngetting a pedicure, working on our coding.\n\n241\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.410\n&gt;&gt; That'd be amazing, Jo.\n\n242\n00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, and why can't we do that?\n\n243\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.542\nWe need to have a word with somebody,\nright?\n\n244\n00:11:58.542 --> 00:11:59.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, but this is true.\n\n245\n00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:05.510\nI mean, I've even worked in an environment\nwhere it was very militant-like,\n\n246\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.700\nand employees weren't allowed to leave\ntheir chair until, I mean, of course,\n\n247\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.640\nuse the restroom or whatever.\n\n248\n00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.780\nBut they weren't allowed to socialize or\nleave their spot until a bell was sounded.\n\n249\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n250\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.640\n&gt;&gt; I'm not joking.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah best.\n\n251\n00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n252\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's completely\nopposing to the Agile concept.\n\n253\n00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it's completely opposing to,\n\n254\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.560\nit's very unsexy common\nsense as well right?\n\n255\n00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.080\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Right.\n&gt;&gt; You're not gonna get the best out of\n\n256\n00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.190\npeople like that.\n\n257\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:36.820\nSo once we can say that you know having\nfun is not obligatory in the office,\n\n258\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.360\nit's definitely part of the Agile mindset.\n\n259\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.540\nDefinitely, that's what\nwe want to encourage.\n\n260\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.510\nSo the Agile mindset and\n\n261\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.700\nthe Agile concept can be applied\nto just pretty much anything.\n\n262\n00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.590\nAnd not just with the project\nworks that we are associated with.\n\n263\n00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.370\nSo let's get onto\nthe Agile project itself.\n\n264\n00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.960\nAnd in fact you'll see there on\nour particular slide just to wrap\n\n265\n00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.520\nit up really.\n\n266\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.690\nThat particular slide.\n\n267\n00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.510\nYou'll see that it applies to Sales and\n\n268\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:09.560\nMarketing and Research and\nabsolutely anything.\n\n269\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.320\nAbsolutely anything, and the obviously\nthe Agile project approach or\n\n270\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.630\nso applies to absolutely everything too.\n\n271\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.760\nWe want to start doing things, and\n\n272\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.340\nhow many times were you told as\na kid to do things baby steps yeah?\n\n273\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.690\nOne feet at a time, one step at a time.\n\n274\n00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.650\nDon't try and achieve everything\nthat you want to achieve,\n\n275\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.730\nlet's do this one step at a time.\n\n276\n00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.570\nThat's exactly what Agile\nis telling you to do.\n\n277\n00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.480\nSo in order to do things\none step at a time,\n\n278\n00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.990\nyou have to understand\nthough where you're going.\n\n279\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.130\nAnd this is where our\nvision comes into this,\n\n280\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:52.160\nand every agile project\nhas to have a vision.\n\n281\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.930\nNow, a vision is not\nsomething that you plan,\n\n282\n00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.580\nin great detail right from the word go.\n\n283\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.550\nThe vision is where you want to get to,\n\n284\n00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.890\nit's what the entire\nproject wants to achieve.\n\n285\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.990\nIt's not what individual\niteration wants to achieve.\n\n286\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.810\nSo your Project Vision, well,\nit's where we, and it says on this slide,\n\n287\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.600\nwe envision our end goal.\n\n288\n00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.100\nIt's about preparing\nthe successful execution.\n\n289\n00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.900\nIt's where we want to get to.\n\n290\n00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.030\nAnd, so\n\n291\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.940\nthe first thing that we do in any Agile\nproject is understand what our vision is.\n\n292\n00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.290\nWhat's your vision for today?\n\n293\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.100\nDo you have a vision?\n\n294\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.785\n&gt;&gt; Margaritas, sand and sunshine.\n\n295\n00:14:34.785 --> 00:14:36.268\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, hold on.\n\n296\n00:14:36.268 --> 00:14:41.020\n[LAUGH] And what do we have\nto do in order to get there?\n\n297\n00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:45.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, I have to have money to travel so\nI guess that means I need\n\n298\n00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:50.280\nto execute what I'm set out to do for\nmy J-O-B my job right?\n\n299\n00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So how about let's focus on that and\n\n300\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.470\ncreate some kind of meaningful show,\n\n301\n00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.295\nsomething that we can deliver\nthat adds value to you.\n\n302\n00:14:59.295 --> 00:14:59.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n303\n00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.360\nWell if your vision is\nmargaritas at the end of\n\n304\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.640\nthe day\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.520\n&gt;&gt; We've got certain things that we've got\n\n306\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.060\nto do before we get to the margaritas.\n\n307\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.010\nAnd by the way, I hope I'm invited.\n\n308\n00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:10.985\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n309\n00:15:10.985 --> 00:15:13.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have increments.\n\n310\n00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.380\nWe have iterations that we have\nto achieve throughout the day.\n\n311\n00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.910\nIn other words we've got episodes that\nwe've got to record throughout the day.\n\n312\n00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n313\n00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.920\n&gt;&gt; And we record one episode at a time,\n\n314\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.450\nwe don't try to do all of them at once\nbecause quite frankly we'd be worn out.\n\n315\n00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.825\nAnd she'd probably wanna strangle\nme by the end of the second one.\n\n316\n00:15:32.825 --> 00:15:36.780\n[LAUGH] So we have increments and\nwe have iterations.\n\n317\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.470\nYou might even call them sprints.\n\n318\n00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.090\nLook at us, applying agile to something\noutside of project management.\n\n319\n00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:46.250\nBut we've got a vision, well Cherokee's\ngot vision and I'm tagging along for\n\n320\n00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.220\nthe ride.\n\n321\n00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.770\nWe've got a vision.\n\n322\n00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:54.170\nAnd what we need is to achieve our\nincrements in order to get to that vision.\n\n323\n00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.640\nWe have to achieve those iterations.\n\n324\n00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.140\nBut the vision is the end goal.\n\n325\n00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:03.100\nAnd so we need to have what\nwe call a Vision Statement.\n\n326\n00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.180\nAnd a Vision Statement as it simply\nsays there describes the future state.\n\n327\n00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.630\nSo once our problem statements\nhave been redressed,\n\n328\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.120\nwe're going to look at\nthose in another episode.\n\n329\n00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.910\nBut once our problem statements have been\n\n330\n00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.280\nsatisfied then we will\nhave achieved our vision.\n\n331\n00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.910\nAnd in our case,\n\n332\n00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:27.520\nyou see once we finish our episodes\nthen you can then achieve your vision.\n\n333\n00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're more great.\n\n334\n00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's the last iteration.\n\n335\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.860\nSo we have to have a sample\nVision Statement because we use that\n\n336\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.010\nVision Statement for communication.\n\n337\n00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.190\nThat's our goal and\nit's going to be visible.\n\n338\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.680\nAnd it might be on our boards think\nabout canvan board for instance.\n\n339\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.430\nSince we look down in this episode.\n\n340\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.260\nIt will be on our board.\n\n341\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.150\nAnd see, there's a sample in front of you,\nan example there,\n\n342\n00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.050\nit should start with Deliver\na solution that will.\n\n343\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.780\nAnd so, that should be on our board,\na vision should be on our board.\n\n344\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.650\nAnd everyone who's involved\nin the project, and\n\n345\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.200\nwho's involved in the iterations, can\nsee that this is what we're aiming for.\n\n346\n00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.820\nAnd so, today on our board, what we're\ngonna put on our board is margaritas.\n\n347\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.466\nAnd we're gonna have that up\non the board just behind us.\n\n348\n00:17:11.466 --> 00:17:17.063\nBut we gotta start with deliver a solution\nthat will foster relaxation and enjoyment.\n\n349\n00:17:17.063 --> 00:17:20.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, I am impressed by that, yeah.\n\n350\n00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.912\nDeliver a solution that will relax\nCherokee at the end of the day.\n\n351\n00:17:24.912 --> 00:17:25.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n352\n00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.840\nFair enough, so, that's it.\n\n353\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.840\nWe're going with the margaritas today.\n\n354\n00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.110\nAnd what we're gonna do then,\n\n355\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:36.740\nthroughout the day is we're\ngoing to deliver our increments.\n\n356\n00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.690\nWe're going to deliver our iterations that\nwill allow us to achieve that vision.\n\n357\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.890\nThe vision should be communicated not just\nwithin IT, and not just within the team.\n\n358\n00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.260\nBut the vision also needs to\nbe agreed with the customer.\n\n359\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.110\nWhomever your customer is.\n\n360\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.790\nBecause your vision is whatever it\nis that you're trying to achieve,\n\n361\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.790\nwhich is deliver value to your customer.\n\n362\n00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.650\nBear in mind that the customer is\nthe person who pays the bills,\n\n363\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.880\nthey're asking you to\nundertake that project.\n\n364\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.660\nSo you are delivering your\nvision to your customer, and\n\n365\n00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.950\ntherefore they've got to agree.\n\n366\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.180\nSo at the very start of a project,\nwe agree our Vision Statement.\n\n367\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.090\nSo what we're going to do for\n\n368\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.700\nthis particular episode is where\ngoing to wrap that up here.\n\n369\n00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.350\nAnd then when we come back in our next\nepisode we are going to take a look\n\n370\n00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.080\nat our problem statements.\n\n371\n00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.180\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nthe scope of our project as well.\n\n372\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.230\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan, Jo.\n\n373\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.230\nI know we said we'd be taking\na look at vision and scope, but\n\n374\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.170\nstay tuned, you don't wanna\nmiss that second part here.\n\n375\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.220\nFor now, let's sign out.\n\n376\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.230\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n377\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n378\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.700\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n379\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:50.464\n[MUSIC]\n\n380\n00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.381\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:12.026\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:15.200\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your agile project\nmanagement concepts series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.311\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:19.897\nIn this episode,\nwe'll continue taking a look at vision.\n\n8\n00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:21.880\nWhile we saw vision in the law episode,\n\n9\n00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.972\nthis is actually a part two where we're\ncoming back to talk about some scope, and\n\n10\n00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:30.085\nwith us today back in studios we were able\nto convince Ms. Jo Peacock to return.\n\n11\n00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:31.316\nHow's it going Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:33.585\n&gt;&gt; It's absolutely great,\nthank you Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:35.331\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful.\n\n14\n00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:36.898\n&gt;&gt; Looking forward to your margaritas?\n\n15\n00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:38.616\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nthat's what we were talking about.\n\n16\n00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:40.300\nSo how are we gonna get there?\n\n17\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.614\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, no,\nit's straight to the point.\n\n18\n00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:48.337\n[LAUGH] Okay, in our last episode then, we\nactually looked at defining the vision for\n\n19\n00:00:48.337 --> 00:00:52.691\nan Agile project, and so,\nCherokee decided that the vision for\n\n20\n00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:56.497\nour project today were margaritas\nat the end of the day.\n\n21\n00:00:56.497 --> 00:00:58.000\n&gt;&gt; Sand and sun.\n\n22\n00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.390\n&gt;&gt; Sand and sun, as well?\n\n23\n00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I don't know about\nthe sun if it's at the end of the day.\n\n24\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.309\nI'll take a sunset.\n\n25\n00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.120\nHow about that?\n\n26\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sunset and margaritas.\n\n27\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.200\nThat means we better be wrapped up early,\nas well.\n\n28\n00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.487\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a Jimmy Buffett\nsong brewing here.\n\n29\n00:01:11.487 --> 00:01:13.659\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If she starts singing,\n\n30\n00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.401\nI'm leaving.\n\n31\n00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.447\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n32\n00:01:15.447 --> 00:01:20.395\nwe've already defined our vision clearly,\nand Cherokee's got a really\n\n33\n00:01:20.395 --> 00:01:24.800\nwell defined vision in her head,\n[LAUGH] l by the sounds of things.\n\n34\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.982\nSo yeah, and if she starts singing.\n\n35\n00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:30.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what we've got to understand then,\n\n36\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.010\nalong with the vision, is that we've got\nto understand the problem statement.\n\n37\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.451\nNow within any particular project, and\nit depends on the size of the project,\n\n38\n00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:46.576\nand this is where Agile really,\nreally, really sort of shows its value.\n\n39\n00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:50.887\nIs that, we can have a problem,\nstatement for an Agile project itself,\n\n40\n00:01:50.887 --> 00:01:55.430\nas a whole, or we can have a problem\nstatement for individual user stories.\n\n41\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.670\nIn other words, a problem statement for\neach iteration, and\n\n42\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.150\nwe look to resolve a particular\nproblem with each iteration.\n\n43\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.340\nSome organizations prefer to\nidentify the problem statement\n\n44\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.450\nright at the very beginning as\nwe're identifying the vision.\n\n45\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.868\nBut it depends on the type of agile\nproject that you are implementing,\n\n46\n00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:22.180\nas to whether you want to define that\nproblem statement with your vision, or\n\n47\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.420\nwhether you want to define multiple\nproblem statements with each iteration.\n\n48\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.010\nNevertheless, you should always have\nan over arching problem statement\n\n49\n00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.640\nthat will tie in with your vision.\n\n50\n00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.612\nIn other words,\nyou have to answer the question why?\n\n51\n00:02:39.612 --> 00:02:43.118\nSo I'm gonna ask Cherokee,\nthis is gonna be good.\n\n52\n00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:44.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n53\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Why do you want a margarita\nat the end of the day Cherokee?\n\n54\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.090\n&gt;&gt; I feel like to my therapist or\nsomething right now, but yeah just for\n\n55\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.910\nthe relaxation, or\nmaybe to spark some creativity.\n\n56\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.274\n&gt;&gt; If I was your therapist right now,\nI would be asking the question of,\n\n57\n00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:07.406\nwhy do you feel you need a margarita\nto relax at the end of the day?\n\n58\n00:03:07.406 --> 00:03:10.203\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is working with me so stressful?\n\n59\n00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:11.741\n&gt;&gt; Man, guys let me tell you.\n\n60\n00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:15.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have to understand why we-\n\n61\n00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:16.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.096\n&gt;&gt; I'm just leaving that there,\n\n63\n00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:18.649\nright there.\n\n64\n00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:24.406\nWe have to understand exactly why\nwe want this particular project,\n\n65\n00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:29.350\nand so as part of vision we've\ngot to understand the why.\n\n66\n00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.810\nWhat is our problem statement,\n\n67\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.760\nwhat is our problem, what is the issue\nthat we're trying to address?\n\n68\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.776\nNow, here at the vision we're looking\nat this from a high level perspective,\n\n69\n00:03:40.776 --> 00:03:44.870\nbut with each users story, we may,\nwell as I've already said,\n\n70\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.940\ndefine problem statement that look at\nproblems in a more detailed perspective.\n\n71\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.530\nYour problem statement, whether it's\nincredibly detailed per user story, or\n\n72\n00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.100\nwhether it's for\nthe actually vision of the project itself,\n\n73\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.695\nas a whole the problem statement\nhas to describe the problem, and\n\n74\n00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:08.771\nwho's affected by the problem,\nand the impact go\n\n75\n00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:14.480\nto any other part of the organization and\nwhat those impacts are.\n\n76\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.400\nIn other words, what it does\nis it describes what the team,\n\n77\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.160\nas in the project team,\nhave got to overcome.\n\n78\n00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.090\nBut it doesn't propose a solution.\n\n79\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.180\nHow many times do you get your users\ncoming to you, and I know that they do.\n\n80\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.300\nThey'll come to you with a solution.\n\n81\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.060\nI want an iPad.\n\n82\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.525\nWell that's not a problem statement,\nthat's actually a solution.\n\n83\n00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:43.359\nYeah they've come to you with a solution.\n\n84\n00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:47.593\nGenerally, because they've seen something\nadvertised on TV, and they thought,\n\n85\n00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:50.107\nhey I could get that working\nin our organization.\n\n86\n00:04:50.107 --> 00:04:51.357\nWell my team needs that.\n\n87\n00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:52.700\nI'm gonna go out and get some.\n\n88\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.400\nSo they come to you in IT with\na simple request, I want an iPad.\n\n89\n00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.210\nBut that's not what\na project will deliver.\n\n90\n00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.154\nWhat a project needs is to understand\nthe problem, and the problem invariably in\n\n91\n00:05:05.154 --> 00:05:10.171\nthat particular case is, I want a tablet\nthat's something that's more portable\n\n92\n00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:14.776\nthan the current laptop that I have,\nso we have to understand the problem.\n\n93\n00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:19.413\nWe don't allow customers to\npropose their own solution,\n\n94\n00:05:19.413 --> 00:05:23.104\nbecause their own solution, quite frankly,\n\n95\n00:05:23.104 --> 00:05:27.945\nmay be, well, it may be against\nall of our infrastructure.\n\n96\n00:05:27.945 --> 00:05:32.152\nIt may be contentious, it may be-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be directly conflicting\n\n97\n00:05:32.152 --> 00:05:36.126\nwith our security policy, so\nmaybe we don't want to have,\n\n98\n00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:40.591\nthe mobility we don't want to have\nbecause of security concerns.\n\n99\n00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:43.702\nSo it might be, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in fact,\n\n100\n00:05:43.702 --> 00:05:49.161\nnot all that long ago, a few years ago\nwhen I was working in central government,\n\n101\n00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:54.618\none of the dilemmas that we really had was\nthe fact that a lot of our politicians,\n\n102\n00:05:54.618 --> 00:05:58.936\nand a lot of our senior civil\nservants wanted the flexibility of\n\n103\n00:05:58.936 --> 00:06:02.722\nbeing able to work outside\nof the office environment.\n\n104\n00:06:02.722 --> 00:06:08.150\nBut because of national security, we can't\nallow them to work in a mobile fashion.\n\n105\n00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.983\nAnd, so, you have that dilemma, and\nthe question that you get from them,\n\n106\n00:06:12.983 --> 00:06:16.818\nthe problem that they pose is,\nwell I want a cell phone, but\n\n107\n00:06:16.818 --> 00:06:19.147\nthat's not actually the problem.\n\n108\n00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:21.516\nThat's a request, I want a cell phone.\n\n109\n00:06:21.516 --> 00:06:26.329\nThe problem is delivering\nmobile solutions to a well,\n\n110\n00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:33.036\nto a certain security level, and that\nwas a problem that we had to overcome.\n\n111\n00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:36.783\nThat was a problem that we had\nto initiate a project, and\n\n112\n00:06:36.783 --> 00:06:41.904\nwork towards overcoming, and so\nwe have to understand what the problem is.\n\n113\n00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:47.650\nNow, the problem statement itself\nis made up of problem description.\n\n114\n00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.331\nIt's got to describe or\nlist certainly the stakeholders,\n\n115\n00:06:51.331 --> 00:06:55.307\nthey are those interested parties,\nbut, more specifically,\n\n116\n00:06:55.307 --> 00:06:58.695\nthe stakeholders that\nare experiencing the problem,\n\n117\n00:06:58.695 --> 00:07:03.060\nin this case the customers, and\nit's got to list the impacts as well.\n\n118\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.520\nSo that's the impact of\nthe problem on each stakeholder.\n\n119\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.950\nThis will help us prioritize.\n\n120\n00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.340\nCan you think of any other reason\nwhy we might wanna do that?\n\n121\n00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.198\n&gt;&gt; List the problem statement?\n\n122\n00:07:16.198 --> 00:07:19.260\n&gt;&gt; No,\nlist the impacts to each stakeholder.\n\n123\n00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI think if we wanna list the impact for\n\n124\n00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.810\neach stakeholder it'd be important,\nbecause then we are probably be able to\n\n125\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.140\npreemptively mitigate any kind\nof issues that would arise.\n\n126\n00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.914\n&gt;&gt; I'm asking Cherokee this\ncompletely on the fly, so\n\n127\n00:07:34.914 --> 00:07:37.319\nshe's completely unprepared for this one.\n\n128\n00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:40.523\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nI've caught her off guard by that.\n\n129\n00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:41.913\n&gt;&gt; It's okay I'm used to it Jo.\n\n130\n00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:47.738\nBut also I'm used to the fact of, and\neven like working in risk analysis and\n\n131\n00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:54.025\nsecurity, you understand the importance\nof, I guess, being able to foresee,\n\n132\n00:07:54.025 --> 00:07:58.832\nor attempting to foresee,\nthe future, because [LAUGH] you can\n\n133\n00:07:58.832 --> 00:08:03.660\nnever do it Assume and\nknow about all the problems in advance.\n\n134\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.540\nI mean, that's just something\nthat I've learned, and\n\n135\n00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.990\nat least I have not been able to foresee\nevery single problem that could arise.\n\n136\n00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.570\n&gt;&gt; But, well you actually mentioned one\nword that's really, really important,\n\n137\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.110\nand that was the word I\nwas trying to get to.\n\n138\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.430\n&gt;&gt; And you kinda threw that in there.\n\n139\n00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.550\nYou didn't really know\nthat you're doing it.\n\n140\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.880\nAnd that was the word, risk.\n\n141\n00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we want to identify the impact\n\n142\n00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.740\nbecause not only do we want to be\nable to prioritize a stories and\n\n143\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:33.280\nprioritize our project, but we also\nwant to be able to analyze risk is well.\n\n144\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.940\nNow, risk will help us\nprioritize an individual story.\n\n145\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.600\nSo risk will tell us well,\nwhat we've got to work on first.\n\n146\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.570\nBecause we'll do some risk analysis and\n\n147\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.440\nthat risk analysis will allow\nus to identify all the risk and\n\n148\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.220\nthen look at our vulnerabilities or\nthe likelihood of that risk occurring.\n\n149\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.240\nAnd then that allows us to decide\nwhere we want to mitigate or\n\n150\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.220\nwhat else we might want to\ndo to control that risk.\n\n151\n00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.160\nNow, we've got another episode on risk\nmanagement to do with agile projects, so\n\n152\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.670\nwe'll address that in more greater\ndetail in another episode.\n\n153\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.160\nBut yes, we want to do this, because\nwant to not necessarily analyze risk,\n\n154\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.690\nbut we want to identify\nrisk at this early stage.\n\n155\n00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.670\nWe have to understand the entire impact.\n\n156\n00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.600\nIt may just impact one particular\nbusiness unit or one particular customer.\n\n157\n00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.700\nBut it might impact\nthe entire organization.\n\n158\n00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.080\nAnd we have to understand\nnot just negative impact but\n\n159\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.670\nalso a positive impact as well.\n\n160\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.830\nNegative impact is something\nthat could go wrong.\n\n161\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.530\nSo what could go wrong if we don't\nimplement this particular project?\n\n162\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.090\nBut then we also want to\nlook at positive impact too,\n\n163\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.680\nand what could happen if we do\nimplement this particular project.\n\n164\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.887\nFor instance, if we do this, then we\ncould have an increase in sales by 30%.\n\n165\n00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:59.720\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is if\nthe reward outweighs the risk.\n\n166\n00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah, so\nthat's why we want that problem statement.\n\n167\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.970\nThat problem statement has got to\ntell us what's wrong right now.\n\n168\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.930\nAnd it doesn't give us, at this\npoint in time, we're not looking for\n\n169\n00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.860\na solution, what we're looking for\nis just to identify what the problem is.\n\n170\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.180\nAnd then that helps us to\nidentify potential solutions\n\n171\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.570\na little bit later on\nin the project itself.\n\n172\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.120\n&gt;&gt; i think you have got\na great example there,\n\n173\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.045\nbecause I kind of feel that\nsame way about paying bills.\n\n174\n00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:32.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What,\nyou don't want to pay them or just always?\n\n175\n00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.538\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's always that, but\n\n176\n00:10:34.538 --> 00:10:39.080\njust the task of logging into\nall these individual accounts.\n\n177\n00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.160\nAnd gee, if there was only something like\nsingle sign-on that we could leverage\n\n178\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.990\nto go ahead and create an application\nto bundle it all together.\n\n179\n00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay, and\n\n180\n00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:54.030\nI know that I'm full of confessions here\nbut I just wanna tell you something.\n\n181\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.220\nAnd this is important\nfrom a perspective of\n\n182\n00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.460\nunderstanding who your customers are and\nunderstanding your environment as well.\n\n183\n00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.670\nAnd I come from a culture,\n\n184\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.370\nobviously I wasn't born in\nthe same place Cherokee was.\n\n185\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.080\nPut it that way, and I come from a culture\nthat's completely different to yours.\n\n186\n00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.520\nAnd, do you know that I haven't seen\na checkbook in, what, 25 years?\n\n187\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.970\nBecause we simply don't use them in the\nculture where I come from, we don't use-\n\n188\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.400\n&gt;&gt; I write a check every single month.\n\n189\n00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.930\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\neverything that we do is technology based.\n\n190\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.670\nDo you know, and this is going to be-\n&gt;&gt; You would think in this day and age,\n\n191\n00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:39.430\nbut no, the bank that I use,\nthey will not allow any other payments for\n\n192\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.600\nthis particular bill that I have.\n\n193\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.410\n&gt;&gt; Do you know, I'm gonna say this, and\n\n194\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.540\nthis is gonna completely, some people\nare gonna be completely astounded by this.\n\n195\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.210\nI can tell you now, but do you know\nthere are still fax machines in use?\n\n196\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.080\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n197\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.120\nEven in the medical industry being\na huge user of those fax machines.\n\n198\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.950\n&gt;&gt; Only in America, only in America.\n\n199\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.070\nYou have met my daughter?\n\n200\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:05.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n201\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.810\n&gt;&gt; She doesn't know what a fax machine is.\n\n202\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.910\nShe's never seen one in her entire life.\n\n203\n00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:17.481\nBecause everything is done electronically\nin other places, and so again this comes\n\n204\n00:12:17.481 --> 00:12:23.670\nback to understanding who your customer\nis and understanding your environment.\n\n205\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.800\nIf you're in a global organization,\nand whilst this might seem\n\n206\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.980\na tongue in cheek sort of conversation and\njust a laugh about our differences.\n\n207\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.050\nBut if you're in a global organization,\nand\n\n208\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.410\nlet's look at that problem\nstatement that's there.\n\n209\n00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.490\nCustomers using mobile phones for\nbanking or cell phones for\n\n210\n00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.140\nbanking find paying bill tedious.\n\n211\n00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.020\nYou've gotta understand\nwho your customers are.\n\n212\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.530\nBecause you've mentioned paying bills\nare tedious for you, but then you've also\n\n213\n00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.120\nmentioned about how you've gotta write\nthe check in order to pay some bills.\n\n214\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.990\nWell quite frankly to other\npeople elsewhere in the world,\n\n215\n00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.770\nthey haven't used a checkbook.\n\n216\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.060\nI mean my daughter's never used\na checkbook in her entire life.\n\n217\n00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.560\nShe would know how to write one\nbecause she's never seen them.\n\n218\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.870\nAnd actually the bank that I\nhave doesn't produce checks.\n\n219\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.910\nYou can't get a check if you wanted one.\n\n220\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.190\nAnd so you have to understand\nwho your customer is.\n\n221\n00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; To find the solution for that customer.\n\n222\n00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.645\nAnd as it tells you here the process for\nentering the details for the bills is\n\n223\n00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:28.640\ncumbersome, but in some cultures and in\nsome countries and in some environments,\n\n224\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.170\nthat might be true for some customers but\nnot true for other customers.\n\n225\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, exactly.\nI mean, if you were tasked,\n\n226\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.320\nif you were a network or\na system administrator and\n\n227\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.670\nyou were tasked with implementing\na solution like this, you go in and\n\n228\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.440\nyou're like this is a great,\nhigh tech new solution going to implement.\n\n229\n00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.280\nBut if it debilitates your customer, and\nthey're not able to utilize something,\n\n230\n00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.130\na line of business application or some\nkind of process that is integral to just\n\n231\n00:13:54.130 --> 00:14:00.056\nmaintaining their organization then you're\nreally working against yourself there.\n\n232\n00:14:00.056 --> 00:14:07.470\n&gt;&gt; I was on site very, very recently\nwith a bank in this country, and\n\n233\n00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.600\nthey were looking to update their ITIL and\n\n234\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.230\nagile frameworks and the way that they\nwere working within the organization.\n\n235\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:20.292\nAnd one of the things that\nthey said to me was that their\n\n236\n00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:24.640\ncustomer demographic was\nover the age of 60, mainly.\n\n237\n00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.260\nAnd so they had to be incredibly\ncareful with technology because their\n\n238\n00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.471\ncustomer demographic was\nover the age of 60 and\n\n239\n00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:37.639\nof course this was in an environment and\na culture where paper was still king and\n\n240\n00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:43.690\nwhere technology wasn't really appropriate\nfor that particular demographic.\n\n241\n00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.780\nAnd you can only really,\ntruly, if you can see that and\n\n242\n00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.470\nyou can understand that conversation,\nthat's when you can truly say that that\n\n243\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.580\nbottom statement of we need an iOS app\nis not a problem statement but a wish,\n\n244\n00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:01.110\nit's not a problem statement, because\nyou see, you don't know what you want.\n\n245\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.720\nAnd it's at that point in time in that\nexample that I've have given you where\n\n246\n00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.230\nthis particular bank were\nleft wondering what to do.\n\n247\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:15.140\nBecause what they wanted to do was\nattract a younger demographic.\n\n248\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.980\nThat was their vision,\nto attract a younger demographic.\n\n249\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:25.000\nBut as vision for an entire organization,\nhow can you attract a younger demographic,\n\n250\n00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.750\nwhile still keeping your older\ndemographic as valued customers?\n\n251\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.570\nBecause if you went too far on\nthe technical side of things,\n\n252\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.720\nyou'd lose your older customers.\n\n253\n00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.115\nHowever if you didn't go far enough on\nthe technical aspect of banking, then\n\n254\n00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:46.990\nwhat happened was exactly what's happening\nor what was happening right then.\n\n255\n00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.030\nWhich was you have\nan older demographic and\n\n256\n00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.580\nthat older demographic is\ngetting older by the year.\n\n257\n00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.746\nAnd they're not bringing in new customers.\n\n258\n00:15:55.746 --> 00:16:00.384\nThen as then a financial\ninstitution then that institution\n\n259\n00:16:00.384 --> 00:16:04.710\nunless they change,\nhad a limited lifespan.\n\n260\n00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.173\nBecause there's that older\ndemographic of customers began to-\n\n261\n00:16:08.173 --> 00:16:10.260\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna say it, but-\n\n262\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.120\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and\n\n263\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.450\nas that older demographic of\ncustomers was no longer there,\n\n264\n00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.090\nthen that financial institution\nhad a limited life span.\n\n265\n00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.480\nSo we have to understand the vision for\nthe organization and\n\n266\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.640\nyou have to be able to articulate\nthe problem statements.\n\n267\n00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.190\nAnd the problem statements have to\nbe articulated very precisely, but\n\n268\n00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.710\nvery objectively as well.\n\n269\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.660\nAnd this can be a challenge.\n\n270\n00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.060\nThere are lots of arguments\nthat are had over identifying\n\n271\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.200\n&gt;&gt; Establishing that problem statement.\n\n272\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.310\n&gt;&gt; Over identifying and\ndefining the problem statement.\n\n273\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.200\nBecause you see,\nif I go back to this particular bank,\n\n274\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.330\nthis particular financial institution,\nyou still had\n\n275\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:56.300\na lot of senior managers who wanted to\n\n276\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.098\nretain their focus, their priority was\non retention of existing customers.\n\n277\n00:17:01.098 --> 00:17:05.015\nWhereas you had other senior\nmanagers whose focus and\n\n278\n00:17:05.015 --> 00:17:09.280\nwho's aim was to bring in new\ncustomers because they were\n\n279\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.910\nconsidering the longevity of\nthe institution of the bank itself.\n\n280\n00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.976\nAnd so\njust agreeing on a problem statement,\n\n281\n00:17:16.976 --> 00:17:20.376\njust agreeing on what is wrong,\nwas a challenge.\n\n282\n00:17:20.376 --> 00:17:24.577\nBecause one group of people said, well,\nwhat is wrong is that we don't have enough\n\n283\n00:17:24.577 --> 00:17:27.338\nmodern technology and\nthe other group of people said,\n\n284\n00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:31.220\nwhat is wrong is that we have\ntoo much modern technology.\n\n285\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.310\nAnd existing customers aren't\nable to work with that.\n\n286\n00:17:35.672 --> 00:17:37.660\nThat itself can be a challenge, and\n\n287\n00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.460\nso that can take quite\na lot of time to work out.\n\n288\n00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:46.620\nNow, I would be recommending\nthat you utilize roles like\n\n289\n00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.900\nbusiness relationship managers\nthat we find within IT as a whole\n\n290\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.880\nto help you to define\nyour problem statements.\n\n291\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.500\nBecause until you can get that agreed,\nyou can't move forward with your project.\n\n292\n00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.380\nCuz you simply don't\nknow what you're doing.\n\n293\n00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.337\nSo once you've got your problem statement\ndefined, and bear it in mind that we can\n\n294\n00:18:05.337 --> 00:18:11.760\nhave a limited problem statement for\neach particular user's story.\n\n295\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.580\nOnce we have the problem\nstatement defined,\n\n296\n00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.160\nthen we can define our vision and\ntherefore our scope.\n\n297\n00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.860\nAnd our scope is very simply,\nwhat we going to deliver.\n\n298\n00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.870\nFrom a high level perspective\nthis is not your solution,\n\n299\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:30.400\nyou are not at this point in\ntime defining your solution.\n\n300\n00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.400\nWhat you're doing is you're defining\nthe gap that exist between the vision,\n\n301\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.290\nwhich is where you want to be and\n\n302\n00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.270\nwhere you are right now,\nwhich is your problem statement.\n\n303\n00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.370\nYour problem statement should articulate\nyour baseline, where you are right now.\n\n304\n00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:51.535\nYour scope should include KPI\nexpectations, however KPI,\n\n305\n00:18:51.535 --> 00:18:56.414\nkey performance indicator,\nin other words how will we know whether\n\n306\n00:18:56.414 --> 00:19:00.130\nwe've achieved what it is\nwe set out to achieve?\n\n307\n00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.270\nHowever, we should be and\nI just wanna add this word of warning in.\n\n308\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:09.263\nWe shouldn't be too precise with our KPI's\nbecause we should be defining KPI's for\n\n309\n00:19:09.263 --> 00:19:11.190\nevery single user story.\n\n310\n00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.710\nWhat we're doing here\nat this point in time\n\n311\n00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.820\nis just defining how we will know\nwhen we have achieve our vision,\n\n312\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.960\nhow will we know when that\nproject can decide of as a whole.\n\n313\n00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.931\nNot each individual user's story,\nbut that project.\n\n314\n00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:35.890\nAnd this is where we, as part of the scope\nwill lay out our individual user stories.\n\n315\n00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:40.300\nIt's at this point in time where we\nwill take the problem statement and\n\n316\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.450\nwe will break it down into\nindividual user stories.\n\n317\n00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.670\nIndividual problems that we can address.\n\n318\n00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.700\nThat we can address in an incremental way,\nso\n\n319\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.210\nthat we can use to build our iterations.\n\n320\n00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.230\nThe other thing that we don't include,\n\n321\n00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.670\nbearing in mind that Agile\nis all about efficiency.\n\n322\n00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:04.600\nThe thing that we don't include are well,\nwhat the solution want to address.\n\n323\n00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.920\nSo we don't include what\nwe're not going to include.\n\n324\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.420\nIn other words, we don't mention\nwhat we're not going to build.\n\n325\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.020\nRemember efficiency?\n\n326\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.720\nAnd I said get rid of\nselfless documentation.\n\n327\n00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.840\nWe don't want, if you're not gonna\nrefer to the manual then don't use it.\n\n328\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.200\nYeah.\nGet rid of the selfless documentation and\n\n329\n00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.410\ndefine your boundaries for\nthat individual project.\n\n330\n00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.540\nThis is what's going to be\nincluded in this project.\n\n331\n00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.070\nAnd everything else is\nnot going to be included.\n\n332\n00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.830\nAnd I don't want to see a list\nof what's excluded by the way.\n\n333\n00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:40.480\nI just want to see a list of what's\nincluded and that's it, nothing more.\n\n334\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.170\nI don't want to see, and by the way,\nwe're leaving this for the next project.\n\n335\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.760\nThe next project can deal with that.\n\n336\n00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.760\nBecause bearing in mind,\n\n337\n00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.880\nthe length of your project could\nbe six months in it's entirety.\n\n338\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.960\nWell, by then,\nat the end of that six months,\n\n339\n00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.790\nbefore you move on to your next project,\nyou're gonna be redefining a vision again.\n\n340\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.530\nBecause your organization and\n\n341\n00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.100\nyour customer expectations will have\nchanged and will have moved on.\n\n342\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.910\nThey do now.\n\n343\n00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.810\nEvery few months they do that.\n\n344\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's something that I'm\njust thinking because I know [LAUGH] that\n\n345\n00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.730\nscope creep is real.\n\n346\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.390\nAnd sometimes people's visions change,\n\n347\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:22.560\nthey wanna start adding features into this\nparticular release or whatever it is.\n\n348\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.530\nThey wanna modify it and\nthat's a real problem too.\n\n349\n00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.880\n&gt;&gt; Well no, in Agile we allow for\nscope creep.\n\n350\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.470\n&gt;&gt; You do?\n\n351\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.820\n&gt;&gt; But we don't call it scope creep,\nwe allow it to change.\n\n352\n00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.380\n&gt;&gt; I've got my old mindset and\nI'm trying to learn, Jo.\n\n353\n00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWe allow for change.\n\n354\n00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.920\nAnd we want to embrace change.\n\n355\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.530\nAnd we acknowledge it throughout\nthe project that things will change.\n\n356\n00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:44.760\nAnd so we acknowledge that.\n\n357\n00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.780\nBut what we don't do because it's not\nefficient is plan too far in advance.\n\n358\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.710\nTo plan too far ahead.\n\n359\n00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.640\nThat is definitely not efficient.\n\n360\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.480\nWe know roughly what our end\nvision is going to be, but\n\n361\n00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.510\nwe also know that that could change.\n\n362\n00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.400\nAnd this is why we release in increments.\n\n363\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.470\nBecause by it releasing in increments or\niterations, then we allow for\n\n364\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.018\nchange with each subsequent iteration.\n\n365\n00:22:09.018 --> 00:22:13.025\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so by trying to teach a new\ndog or an old dog new tricks here.\n\n366\n00:22:13.025 --> 00:22:16.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But what you're saying here is look,\n\n367\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.760\nby setting those increments,\n\n368\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.840\nhopefully that doesn't allow me enough\ntime to change my mind 50,000 times.\n\n369\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.520\n&gt;&gt; Right, because with each iteration,\neach iteration's gonna last between one or\n\n370\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.520\nfour weeks.\n\n371\n00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.638\nAnd with each iteration,\nthen that´s it, it´s cast in stone.\n\n372\n00:22:33.638 --> 00:22:36.000\nOnce the iteration's been agreed,\nit´s cast in stone,\n\n373\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.740\nthat´s what´s going to be delivered.\n\n374\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.590\nSo you´re not gonna\nchange your mind on that\n\n375\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.285\nparticular part-\n\n376\n00:22:41.285 --> 00:22:42.052\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n377\n00:22:42.052 --> 00:22:46.320\nBut then you've only got four weeks and\nthen by the time the next one starts,\n\n378\n00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.310\nthen you could have a different goal.\n\n379\n00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm getting it.\n\n380\n00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n381\n00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, all right, okay.\n\n382\n00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.420\nThink about this.\n\n383\n00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.120\nYou see, look,\nif you have an unclear vision,\n\n384\n00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.460\nyou have to have a clear vision to\nensure that the team's organized.\n\n385\n00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:05.545\nBut your vision is what you want to\nachieve for your entire project.\n\n386\n00:23:05.545 --> 00:23:07.825\nAnd that's got to be fairly high level.\n\n387\n00:23:07.825 --> 00:23:14.355\nYour problem statement has got to detail\nwhat problem it is you want to overcome.\n\n388\n00:23:14.355 --> 00:23:18.275\nAnd, look, that last bullet point\nmentions scope change, yeah?\n\n389\n00:23:18.275 --> 00:23:19.755\nWe allow for scope change.\n\n390\n00:23:19.755 --> 00:23:20.475\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n391\n00:23:20.475 --> 00:23:22.755\n&gt;&gt; We understand change, all right?\n\n392\n00:23:22.755 --> 00:23:25.360\nNothing's ever cast in stone.\n\n393\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.910\nIt really isn't, and\nthe problem may evolve as well.\n\n394\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.030\nDon't forget, you've got that problem\nstatement but that could evolve.\n\n395\n00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.720\nBecause let's say your\nproject is outstanding for\n\n396\n00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.430\nsix months, you got a six month\nduration for the entire project.\n\n397\n00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.190\nThe problem may change, the problem\nmight change with each iteration.\n\n398\n00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.929\nAs you resolve a little bit of the\nproblem, it might bring out a new problem.\n\n399\n00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.138\n&gt;&gt; Hence the term, Agile.\n\n400\n00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:52.089\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right, right-\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting it.\n\n401\n00:23:52.089 --> 00:23:52.671\nNow we're getting there.\n\n402\n00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:55.657\n&gt;&gt; We're getting there [LAUGH].\n\n403\n00:23:55.657 --> 00:24:00.584\nSo be careful of things like assumptions,\nthat's assumptions on the project,\n\n404\n00:24:00.584 --> 00:24:05.148\nassumptions on things like assumption\non the problem which is why its gotta\n\n405\n00:24:05.148 --> 00:24:06.826\nbe articulated properly.\n\n406\n00:24:06.826 --> 00:24:11.759\nAssumption on the scope that is cast in\nstone right to the very beginning, yeah?\n\n407\n00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:15.638\nAnd the assumption is that, well,\nthey're just simply things that we assume.\n\n408\n00:24:15.638 --> 00:24:19.962\nThings that we, well, as it says,\nthat might be true right now, but\n\n409\n00:24:19.962 --> 00:24:23.360\nmay not necessarily be true\na little bit later on.\n\n410\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.000\nLike I said,\nproblem statement could change.\n\n411\n00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.670\nOr those things that we don't\nreally know for certain, but\n\n412\n00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.600\nwe're just gonna take a guess\nthat we don't like assumptions.\n\n413\n00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.600\nWe really don't.\n\n414\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.180\nAnd I know that we will say this in IT.\n\n415\n00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.593\nDon't ever assume anything and\n\n416\n00:24:37.593 --> 00:24:39.954\nyou're gonna say something\nsmart about this on you.\n\n417\n00:24:39.954 --> 00:24:41.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm not it's not appropriate.\n\n418\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:42.370\n&gt;&gt; All right okay.\n\n419\n00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:43.590\nThank you.\n\n420\n00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.120\nI'm happy please don't.\n\n421\n00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.960\nYeah we just don't like assumptions\nthat's all I'm gonna say.\n\n422\n00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.610\nAssumptions are a risk because\nan assumption might not come true.\n\n423\n00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:54.960\nSo we don't assume.\n\n424\n00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.710\nWe can base predictions on probability and\non previous performance.\n\n425\n00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.800\nBut you should never just assume.\n\n426\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.470\nI think so is never a good statement\nto start off a sentence or\n\n427\n00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.180\nto start off a vision or\nto start off a user's story.\n\n428\n00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:16.120\nOr even to be able to demonstrate\nwhether you've achieved a pay PI.\n\n429\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.310\nIf you're using the words I think so\n\n430\n00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:22.800\nthat shouldn't be part of\nyour project not at all.\n\n431\n00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.680\n&gt;&gt; Like what led you to that assumption?\n\n432\n00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.210\nDo you have a survey or\n\n433\n00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.500\nany type of statistical\ninformation that can support that?\n\n434\n00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.860\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah.\n\n435\n00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.720\nAnd even though we're in\nan agile environment.\n\n436\n00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.550\nAnd we want to be as\nflexible as we possibly can.\n\n437\n00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:41.210\nAnd I know that we don't want heavy\nprocess documentation at the same time,\n\n438\n00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.990\nwe have to have some constraints.\n\n439\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:48.330\nWe have to have some rules,\nwe have to have some ways of working and\n\n440\n00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.930\nsome processes.\n\n441\n00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.940\nAnd one of those rules that\nwe might want to have and\n\n442\n00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:59.120\nwe should definitely have is that you\ndon't assume, I want to see evidence.\n\n443\n00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:05.260\nI have a saying when I'm on sight\nwith clients my saying is show me.\n\n444\n00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.370\nAnd I will say that a lot.\n\n445\n00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:12.930\nDon't tell me, show me the evidence,\nI want to see this.\n\n446\n00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.140\nAnd of course we've already\ntalked in previous sessions,\n\n447\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.150\nabout observing directly.\n\n448\n00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.330\nGetting off your bum, and\nfinding out exactly what's going on.\n\n449\n00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.550\nDon't ever assume.\n\n450\n00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.760\nNow I mentioned the words,\nconstraints, and\n\n451\n00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.990\nconstraints really apply to designing the\nsolution, and designing each iteration.\n\n452\n00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.970\nAnd there's a list of constraints\non the screen in front of you.\n\n453\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:38.510\nThe one I think that's mainly forgotten\nabout, are the ethics, our company,\n\n454\n00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.230\nour corporate ethics.\n\n455\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:45.930\nThese are the rules that we impose on\nour corporation that are optional.\n\n456\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.010\nThey're a choice.\n\n457\n00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:51.320\nSo things like recycling,\nfor instance, is a big one.\n\n458\n00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.460\nRecycling is mandatory in certain\ncountries around the world, but\n\n459\n00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.260\nrecycling is not mandatory in every\nsingle state in the US, for instance.\n\n460\n00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:05.100\nSo an organization that's a global\norganization may impose a corporate\n\n461\n00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:11.080\nethic that say that, recycling happens\nacross the board absolutely everywhere.\n\n462\n00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.330\nSo work out your constraints.\n\n463\n00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.950\nWe all know the typical\nconstraints such as budget.\n\n464\n00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.440\nHow much money have we got to spend and\nwhat about schedule and\n\n465\n00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.010\nmaybe even skills as well.\n\n466\n00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.850\nThat would come under resources.\n\n467\n00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.560\nLet's think about other ones,\nlike our regulations.\n\n468\n00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.930\nAny regulations we have to uphold\nsuch as data protection rules and\n\n469\n00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.310\nalso ethics,\nwhich are imposed by the company.\n\n470\n00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.500\nWe have to understand these constraints\nand where do they come from and\n\n471\n00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.530\nwhether they can be influenced.\n\n472\n00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.630\nWe can possibly influence\nethical constraints.\n\n473\n00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.800\nBut we can't influence\nregulatory constraints.\n\n474\n00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.320\n&gt;&gt; Right, I know you know about GTPR and\n\n475\n00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:52.368\nthe regulations that\naffect your pin companies.\n\n476\n00:27:52.368 --> 00:27:58.660\nBut here, ITPRO.TV based out of\nthe US also has a branch in the UK.\n\n477\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.740\nSo we need to be aware of and\n\n478\n00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:06.970\njust be cognizant to the fact that we have\nto adhere to those standards as well.\n\n479\n00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:11.040\nJust looking at those regulations and\nbeing sensitive to that.\n\n480\n00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.500\n&gt;&gt; And it's not just about for\nthe working practices, but\n\n481\n00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.150\nit's also about things like\nemployment law for instance.\n\n482\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:16.930\nNow back in Europe,\n\n483\n00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.500\nemployment law is completely different\nto what it is here in the states.\n\n484\n00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.430\nAnd so organizations have got to be\naware of that especially when you\n\n485\n00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.400\nare managing a project team.\n\n486\n00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.890\nAnd your project team is split\nglobally across the world\n\n487\n00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:34.040\nyou will have different constraints\nin place in terms of employment laws.\n\n488\n00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.760\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n489\n00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.290\n&gt;&gt; And what your employees are allowed\nto do, what they're not allowed to do.\n\n490\n00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.200\nHow many days vacation they can have?\n\n491\n00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Over to them.\n\n492\n00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n493\n00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.815\n&gt;&gt; How are we gonna handle that?\n\n494\n00:28:42.815 --> 00:28:46.498\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, and then in fact in\nEurope we have something called the EU\n\n495\n00:28:46.498 --> 00:28:50.840\nworking time directive, which actually\nstates quite categorically by law\n\n496\n00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.870\nthat you cannot work more than\na certain number of hours per week.\n\n497\n00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.230\nNow you can opt out of that but\n\n498\n00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.840\nthat only gives you an extra\nfew hours that you can work.\n\n499\n00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.420\nAnd by law, the organization\ncannot ask you to do that.\n\n500\n00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.920\nUnless you're a doctor.\n\n501\n00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.520\nAnd if you're a doctor or\nyou're an emergency professional,\n\n502\n00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.740\nlike you're work for\nthe fire department or something.\n\n503\n00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.538\n&gt;&gt; First responders.\n\n504\n00:29:10.538 --> 00:29:11.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n505\n00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.510\nThen in that case then\nyou're exempt from that.\n\n506\n00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.710\nBut other than that, for\nan organization like us,\n\n507\n00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.850\nthen we have to make sure that\nour employees over in the UK,\n\n508\n00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.070\nwe can not ask them to work more\nthan a certain number of hours.\n\n509\n00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.610\nSo we have to be aware of that.\n\n510\n00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.880\nAnd that's the job of, and\nwe spoke about a scrum master,\n\n511\n00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.170\nand that's the job of the scrum master.\n\n512\n00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.200\nHis job is there to facilitate the team.\n\n513\n00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.950\nSo he needs to be aware of all of that.\n\n514\n00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.490\nAnd he needs to be aware\nof the constraints.\n\n515\n00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:43.940\nNow the product owner will also\nenable the scrum masters to be aware\n\n516\n00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:49.350\nof any product constraints that there\nare any technological constraints.\n\n517\n00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.710\nSo with any Agile project [or\nwith any project let's face it,\n\n518\n00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:58.000\nwe've got to determine what\nsuccess means for that project.\n\n519\n00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.620\nIn other words, how will we know\nwhen we finish that project?\n\n520\n00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:04.780\nNow if you remember in a previous episode,\n\n521\n00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.510\nwe talked about the fact that\nsome projects are just ongoing.\n\n522\n00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.610\nSome things are ongoing iterations.\n\n523\n00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.650\nFor instance, your operating system.\n\n524\n00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.800\nYou never ever set out to develop\nan operating system and then suddenly\n\n525\n00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.600\nturn around and say, right, that operating\nsystem's only going to be valid for\n\n526\n00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.450\nthe next year or the next two years or\nfor the next ten years.\n\n527\n00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:27.120\nBut you set out to develop an operating\nsystem, but then what you will do\n\n528\n00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.350\nis you will update that operating\nsystem in iterations and in increments.\n\n529\n00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.890\nBut with a lot of projects.\n\n530\n00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:38.740\nAnd in fact with most projects,\nwe will have a defined end date,\n\n531\n00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.840\nor we will have what we\ncall differing success.\n\n532\n00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.480\nAnd even with that operating system,\nwe have that defined success.\n\n533\n00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.010\nWe know that we want to do\nis we want to facilitate\n\n534\n00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.530\naccess to applications\nwith our operating system.\n\n535\n00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:58.650\nAnd we don't want to incur any problems or\n\n536\n00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:02.010\nincur any delays whilst\nwe're facilitating that.\n\n537\n00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.720\nAnd so that would be our project success.\n\n538\n00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.180\nBut with most projects we've\ngot to define success and\n\n539\n00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:13.210\nthat might be implementation of a brand\nnew service, a brand new functionality.\n\n540\n00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.000\nSo in that case then we've\ngot to ensure that we define\n\n541\n00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.060\nwhat we consider to be success.\n\n542\n00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.770\nCuz only then can we sign\noff on a project to say,\n\n543\n00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.640\nyes that project has been completed.\n\n544\n00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.700\nWe have to focus on the solution,\nnot the process.\n\n545\n00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.060\nThis is not about achieving milestones.\n\n546\n00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.150\nThis is not about saying, hey,\nlook, we've ticked this box, and\n\n547\n00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.755\nwe've ticked this box, and we've ticked\nthis box, so we must be finished.\n\n548\n00:31:36.755 --> 00:31:38.075\nThat’s not the case.\n\n549\n00:31:38.075 --> 00:31:41.615\nWhat we’re focusing on is the deliverable,\nand only when we’ve achieved\n\n550\n00:31:41.615 --> 00:31:45.255\nthe deliverable, can we then say\nthat the project has been a success.\n\n551\n00:31:45.255 --> 00:31:51.175\nWhich is why our projects assessed\nmust be defined as being SMART,\n\n552\n00:31:51.175 --> 00:31:55.815\nspecific, measurable, achievable,\nrealistic, and timebound.\n\n553\n00:31:55.815 --> 00:32:00.470\nWe’ve got to have an element of time in\nthere when we expect this to happen by.\n\n554\n00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:07.110\nAnd every single success criteria\nhas got to have a relevant and\n\n555\n00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:10.720\nrelated KPI,\nthat's a key performance indicator.\n\n556\n00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.260\nSo that's very difficult to achieve and\n\n557\n00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.790\nI'm not gonna pretend that this is\nsomething that's gonna be easy.\n\n558\n00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:19.660\nThis is probably gonna be as difficult and\n\n559\n00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.930\nas big an exercise as defined\nin the problem statement.\n\n560\n00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:28.600\nAnd making sure that the problem\nstatement is articulated with detail,\n\n561\n00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.120\nand enough detail for you to be able\nthen to define the success criteria.\n\n562\n00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.460\nAnd in a lot of instances,\n\n563\n00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.750\nwe find success criteria at the same\ntime as we define the problem statement.\n\n564\n00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.230\nBecause we know that if we have\nsatisfied the problem statement\n\n565\n00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.510\nthen we have met our success criteria.\n\n566\n00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:52.180\nBut again, I just want to emphasize\nthe fact that success criteria is key.\n\n567\n00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:56.610\nThis will determine whether you sign\noff on this particular project or\n\n568\n00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.560\nwhether you don't sign off\non this particular project.\n\n569\n00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.420\nYou have to meet your success criteria.\n\n570\n00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.870\nSo in our next episode,\n\n571\n00:33:03.870

00:00:06.856\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:08.363\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:12.755\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\n\n6\n00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:15.410\ngentlemen to your\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.510\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.770\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat, well, what stakeholders are.\n\n9\n00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.740\nAnd don't get that confused\nwith stockholders.\n\n10\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.270\nHowever, they could be stakeholders.\n\n11\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.130\nBut you know what?\n\n12\n00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.210\nWe'll just let Jo sort that all out for\nyou.\n\n13\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.310\nHow's it going today Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Well it was fine until a moment ago and\n\n14\n00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.280\nnow you've just given\nme a mess to sort out.\n\n15\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.510\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm great at that.\n\n16\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.790\nI always like to just say these\nlittle confusing things, and\n\n17\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.445\nthen let you deal with it, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks.\n\n18\n00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:43.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.480\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n20\n00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.090\nYes, we are.\n\n21\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.220\nIn this particular episode, we're actually\ngoing to look at identifying stakeholders.\n\n22\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.030\nHow do we work out what a stakeholder is,\nand who our stakeholders are?\n\n23\n00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.570\nAnd what they actually mean to\nthe success of our Agile project.\n\n24\n00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.060\nSo a stakeholder, really, is just defined\nas anybody who has got an interest in\n\n25\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.230\na particular outcome and in a particular\nproject, or even in an organization.\n\n26\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.450\nA stakeholder is literally\nanybody that's got an interest.\n\n27\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.042\nMy nosy neighbor is a stakeholder\nin everything that I do.\n\n28\n00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You have one of those too?\n\n29\n00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.070\n&gt;&gt; I do, yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.760\nIt's not the same one, but yeah.\n\n31\n00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.490\nNot the same one as yours, but\nyeah we have one of those.\n\n32\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.290\nWe've had quite a few of those\nin our lifetime as well.\n\n33\n00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.420\nBut they're a stakeholder.\n\n34\n00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.594\nYou, on the other end of the TV screen or\nyour computer screen or whatever,\n\n35\n00:01:36.594 --> 00:01:38.200\nyou are a stakeholder.\n\n36\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.600\nAnd you are a stakeholder in what we do\nhere because what we've gotta make sure is\n\n37\n00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.870\nthat what we deliver is\ncontent that you can watch.\n\n38\n00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.950\nAnd that actually you can relate to and\nalso that you can learn from as well.\n\n39\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.130\nSo you're a stakeholder and\nyou're very important to us.\n\n40\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.826\nBut other stakeholders, are people\nare like stakeholders for instance.\n\n41\n00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:02.500\nSomebody that owns stock in an\norganization has actually got an interest\n\n42\n00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.900\nin how that organization performs.\n\n43\n00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.390\nAnd so stakeholders can come\nfrom a variety of places.\n\n44\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.640\nAnd whilst it's defined as anybody who's\ngot an interest or a concern, it really is\n\n45\n00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.600\nanybody that cares about the activities or\nthe targets or the deliverables.\n\n46\n00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.460\nStakeholders could be\nabsolutely anybody and\n\n47\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.200\nthey come from all levels\nof our organization.\n\n48\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.160\nAnd external to our organization as well.\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n49\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.760\nJo, I mean, just having that\nideology that it could be anyone.\n\n50\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.861\nFor instance, maybe I worked for\n\n51\n00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:40.750\na company that worked with some kind\nof biochemical production or whatever.\n\n52\n00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.610\nAnd then there was some kind of leak.\n\n53\n00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.010\nAnd so the general public,\nmaybe my leak leaked into a water supply.\n\n54\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.020\nSo at that point in time\nanyone could be a stakeholder,\n\n55\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.570\nor anyone within that region\nthat would be affected or\n\n56\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.652\nhave a vetted interest there.\n&gt;&gt; and sometimes I worry where your head\n\n57\n00:02:58.652 --> 00:02:59.753\nis going.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n58\n00:02:59.753 --> 00:03:01.747\n&gt;&gt; But, you're right.\n\n59\n00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:02.942\nShe is right.\n\n60\n00:03:02.942 --> 00:03:07.454\n[LAUGH] A stakeholder is not just\nsomebody that's got a financial interest.\n\n61\n00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:10.960\nAnd I think that's a general\nmisconception that we have.\n\n62\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.440\nAnd I think that there are cultural\nissues to that as well.\n\n63\n00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.676\nBecause I know that certainly here in the\nUS, a stakeholder is generally considered\n\n64\n00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:21.520\nto be somebody who's got a financial\ninterest, like a customer.\n\n65\n00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.730\nBut as far as we're concerned\nin an agile perspective,\n\n66\n00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.010\na stakeholder is literally just\nsomebody who is interested,\n\n67\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.660\nsomebody who has a concern,\nwhether it's a financial interest or not.\n\n68\n00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.440\nNow I've already mentioned that you're a\nstakeholder in what we're producing here.\n\n69\n00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.732\nBut as my sort of co-host Cherokee\nis also a stakeholder in what I\n\n70\n00:03:39.732 --> 00:03:43.560\nproduce as well and\nwhat we're talking about right now.\n\n71\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.570\nAnd our director Taylor is also\na stakeholder in this entire production.\n\n72\n00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.466\nAnd every single one of us,\n\n73\n00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:53.370\nyou have an influence over\nthe content that we deliver.\n\n74\n00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.190\nCherokee has an influence over\nthe content that we deliver and\n\n75\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.250\nthe way that we deliver the content.\n\n76\n00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.960\nI have an influence over the content\nthat I have compiled and\n\n77\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.190\nthe way it's delivered.\n\n78\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.150\nAnd Taylor also has an influence over\n\n79\n00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.380\nthe way that our content is delivered\nas well and how it's presented.\n\n80\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.830\nAnd so each one of us in this particular\nrelationship has an interest.\n\n81\n00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.610\nNow they may be slight\ndifferent interests.\n\n82\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.984\nTaylor has an interest in\nhow this is produced and\n\n83\n00:04:22.984 --> 00:04:26.867\nhow he's going to ensure that\nthis is cohesive for you.\n\n84\n00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:30.893\nYou have an interest in whether this\nis going to be something that you're\n\n85\n00:04:30.893 --> 00:04:34.510\ninterested in and\nalso something that you can watch.\n\n86\n00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.910\nNow I have an interest in\nthe content that I'm producing and\n\n87\n00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.440\nalso the way I'm talking.\n\n88\n00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.610\nAnd Cherokee's also got an interest\nin the topic that we're covering and\n\n89\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.800\nmaking sure that she keeps me on track.\n&gt;&gt; Some of my\n\n90\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.520\ninterests are a little bit selfish,\ncuz I love this topic to begin with.\n\n91\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.894\nBut then, of course, yes just\nensuring that you guys are able to\n\n92\n00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:57.912\npass your certification or just develop\nyourselves professionally also.\n\n93\n00:04:57.912 --> 00:04:58.566\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n94\n00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:02.630\nso stakeholders come\nfrom a variety of places.\n\n95\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.580\nWhat we've got to do is that we've got to,\n\n96\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.280\nand you here this in\nbusiness all the time.\n\n97\n00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.730\nWe have got to manage\nstakeholder expectations.\n\n98\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.894\nAnd you quite often hear\nthe phrase under-promise and\n\n99\n00:05:14.894 --> 00:05:17.170\nover-deliver.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n100\n00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.109\n&gt;&gt; Yep, this is about\n\n101\n00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:20.450\nmanaging stakeholder expectations.\n\n102\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.920\nIt's ensuring that your\nstakeholders know what to expect.\n\n103\n00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.080\nRight at the very start of this episode\nwe tried to manage your expectations.\n\n104\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.791\nBecause we gave you a little insight\ninto what we were covering as\n\n105\n00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.458\npart of this episode.\n\n106\n00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:39.518\nNow Cherokee managed your expectations\nby telling you who it was\n\n107\n00:05:39.518 --> 00:05:44.600\nthat was actually covering the topic and\nwho it was that was talking today.\n\n108\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.400\nAnd Taylor, our director, is managing\nyour expectations by ensuring that\n\n109\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.590\nnot only you can see us on the camera.\n\n110\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.750\nBut also that the right sort of content\nis displayed at the right time.\n\n111\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.520\nAnd that the right information comes up\nat the bottom of the screen at the right\n\n112\n00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.830\ntime as well.\n\n113\n00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.460\nSo every single stakeholder has a role\nin your project and in your activity.\n\n114\n00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.356\nIt's up to you as a project manager or\nas a scrum master within\n\n115\n00:06:13.356 --> 00:06:17.780\nan Agile project to define\nwho your stakeholders are.\n\n116\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.939\nAnd we'll talk in a little while about not\njust the definition of stakeholders, but\n\n117\n00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.840\nalso about categorization\nof stakeholders as well.\n\n118\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.160\nBecause some stakeholders, well,\n\n119\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.470\nthey might not be as important\nas other stakeholders.\n\n120\n00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.410\nAnd we've gotta look at this objectively,\nand\n\n121\n00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.610\ntry not to let our emotions in the way.\n\n122\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.190\nCuz I mean, ultimately,\nCherokee has an interest in what it is\n\n123\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.397\nthat we produce here, but as-\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee can be replaced.\n\n124\n00:06:44.397 --> 00:06:48.917\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't say that, I didn't say that.\n\n125\n00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:51.826\n&gt;&gt; But [LAUGH] as far as this particular\n\n126\n00:06:51.826 --> 00:06:57.810\ncontent is concerned, she has\nabsolutely no influence whatsoever.\n\n127\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.990\n[LAUGH] So yeah, she has an interest,\nbut no influence.\n\n128\n00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.760\nAs she said, she can be replaced,\ncarries on, it will happen.\n\n129\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.100\nSo how do you know who your\nstakeholders are then?\n\n130\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.220\nThat first one that's up\nthere is the word really,\n\n131\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.180\nthat's most important to all of this.\n\n132\n00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.990\nAsk, if you don't know who\nyour stakeholders are, ask.\n\n133\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.650\nAsk who your stakeholders are, ask people.\n\n134\n00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.140\nThey could be people\nwithin your organization.\n\n135\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.920\nIt could be customers both internal and\nexternal.\n\n136\n00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.090\nIt could be other people within your team,\nfor instance.\n\n137\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.044\nSubject matter experts,\n\n138\n00:07:33.044 --> 00:07:38.030\npeople that you're working\nalongside that have specific roles.\n\n139\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.974\nAnd then think about people that\nare outside of your service provider\n\n140\n00:07:41.974 --> 00:07:46.150\norganization, such as users or\neven suppliers and third parties.\n\n141\n00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.020\nThese are all stakeholders.\n\n142\n00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.814\nYou see, if we didn't have third\nparties working with us to help us to\n\n143\n00:07:52.814 --> 00:07:58.120\ndeliver this content to the Internet,\nthen we wouldn't be able to do that.\n\n144\n00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.796\nAnd therefore, that would affect\nYour enjoyment of it certainly for\n\n145\n00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:06.472\nthose that are watching this live.\n&gt;&gt; This goes back to your\n\n146\n00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:10.922\nnew assumptions also, because we can't\nassume that we know everyone who is\n\n147\n00:08:10.922 --> 00:08:13.230\ngoing to be affected by our decisions.\n\n148\n00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:18.451\nSo having those meetings and putting those\nquestions out there, like you're saying.\n\n149\n00:08:18.451 --> 00:08:22.475\nWell, we didn't know that this department\nrelied on this particular process,\n\n150\n00:08:22.475 --> 00:08:25.199\nor software, or whatever, so great point.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n151\n00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:30.650\nthink about who our stakeholders are in\nterms of let's look at external right now.\n\n152\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.448\nRight at this particular moment in time\nwhere we are we are suffering some pretty\n\n153\n00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:36.960\nbad rain.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n154\n00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.140\n&gt;&gt; And so if you're watching live right\n\n155\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.289\nnow, then you will notice some\ninterruptions in some of our broadcast\n\n156\n00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:47.111\nbecause we're having some rain showers,\njust very mild ones.\n\n157\n00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:49.716\nBut anyway we're having\nsome rain showers and\n\n158\n00:08:49.716 --> 00:08:52.176\nthat's interfering with the way that we-\n&gt;&gt; Production.\n\n159\n00:08:52.176 --> 00:08:53.881\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it since very modern way\n\n160\n00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:55.791\nthat we can deliver things to you.\n\n161\n00:08:55.791 --> 00:08:58.292\nNow, you could say,\nwell what does that matter?\n\n162\n00:08:58.292 --> 00:09:02.517\nIt doesn't matter because you're recording\nbut if you're watching live right now and\n\n163\n00:09:02.517 --> 00:09:04.810\nyou're trying to study for\na particular test.\n\n164\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.350\nLet's say you're studying for\nyour Agile foundation test.\n\n165\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.115\nWell, at this point and time if you've\ngot your test on Friday afternoon you've\n\n166\n00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:17.161\nalready scheduled it and\nlet's say it's Tuesday morning right now.\n\n167\n00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:21.649\nThen you're not going to be able to get\nto that deadline of Friday afternoon,\n\n168\n00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:22.210\nare you?\n\n169\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.437\nThat's going to affect you.\n\n170\n00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:28.056\nSo it's really important that we\nunderstand who our stakeholders are, and\n\n171\n00:09:28.056 --> 00:09:33.900\nit might not be stakeholders that are in\nthe room in the studio with us right now.\n\n172\n00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.577\nAnd it's the same with any project,\nyou have to think of stakeholders\n\n173\n00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.458\nthat aren't necessarily\ninvolved with the project.\n\n174\n00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:45.320\nIncluding your third-parties, including\nyour nosey neighbors, for instance.\n\n175\n00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.715\nIt may be that there are things that\nare outside of our control that really\n\n176\n00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.156\ninfluence how we do work.\n\n177\n00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:54.917\nHave you ever been at\nwork in your home office?\n\n178\n00:09:54.917 --> 00:09:59.650\nYou're managing a project, you've got\na really important meeting with a client.\n\n179\n00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.053\nYou're trying to define your success\ncriteria with your client and\n\n180\n00:10:03.053 --> 00:10:05.272\nthen all of a sudden\nsomebody comes around.\n\n181\n00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:09.516\nThe local said he comes around to\ncollect trash from outside your window,\n\n182\n00:10:09.516 --> 00:10:13.497\nyou have no influence in that\nwhatsoever but they are a stakeholder.\n\n183\n00:10:13.497 --> 00:10:17.725\nAnd because they are a stakeholder you\nhave to consider how they're gonna\n\n184\n00:10:17.725 --> 00:10:22.420\ninfluence your particular project and\nyour deliverable of the project.\n\n185\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.211\nYou're not going to be giving\na presentation at 8 AM on a Thursday\n\n186\n00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:30.358\nmorning if that's when they come around.\n\n187\n00:10:30.358 --> 00:10:34.087\nSo consider your stakeholders and\nthey could be external.\n\n188\n00:10:34.087 --> 00:10:38.567\nAnd you have to ask\nyourself these questions.\n\n189\n00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:40.370\nWhat interests do they have?\n\n190\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.286\nWhat motivates them?\n\n191\n00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:45.920\nAnd what kind of influence\ndid they have on the project?\n\n192\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.050\nAnd what kind of influence\ndo I have on them?\n\n193\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.710\nI just wanna talk\na little bit about value.\n\n194\n00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:01.899\nAnd delivery of value to any stakeholder\nis based on the outcomes that they want\n\n195\n00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:08.580\nto achieve but also the preferences that\nthey have, and their perception of value.\n\n196\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:14.760\nSo let me take this another way,\nlet's take this outside of IT.\n\n197\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.944\nSo if I were to,\nlet's say that we had 35 grand in dollars,\n\n198\n00:11:19.944 --> 00:11:23.110\nand we were to go and buy a car, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.340\nWhat car would you buy?\n\n200\n00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:29.415\n35.\n\n201\n00:11:29.415 --> 00:11:33.136\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't supposed to be a difficult\n\n202\n00:11:33.136 --> 00:11:37.737\nquestion, by the way.\n&gt;&gt; I have expensive tastes, Jo, so\n\n203\n00:11:37.737 --> 00:11:39.111\nI'm trying to think.\n\n204\n00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:42.037\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I knew I shouldn't have started this,\n\n205\n00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:43.132\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n206\n00:11:43.132 --> 00:11:47.030\nI'll just go with a car\nthat I used to have.\n\n207\n00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.726\nThat was in that price range that I\nreally loved, an older car that I had.\n\n208\n00:11:49.726 --> 00:11:54.150\nIt was an Acura, so it was an Acura TSX.\n&gt;&gt; Right okay,\n\n209\n00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.800\nwe finally got there,\nwe finally got there.\n\n210\n00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.597\nSo if you wanted to go buy a car,\nyou'd go and buy,\n\n211\n00:11:59.597 --> 00:12:01.608\nI don't even know what kind of car.\n\n212\n00:12:01.608 --> 00:12:04.890\nIs it just a basic Sedan?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n213\n00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.906\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so Cherokee would go and\n\n214\n00:12:06.906 --> 00:12:07.583\nbuy a sedan.\n\n215\n00:12:07.583 --> 00:12:15.524\nAll right, now if I had 35 grand,\nI would go and probably buy a truck.\n\n216\n00:12:15.524 --> 00:12:18.549\nBecause it wouldn't be enough quite for\nthe car that I'd really, really want.\n\n217\n00:12:18.549 --> 00:12:19.461\nSo yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:12:19.461 --> 00:12:21.524\n&gt;&gt; I'd probably go and buy a truck.\n\n219\n00:12:21.524 --> 00:12:23.471\n&gt;&gt; That was my constraint too, Jo.\n\n220\n00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:24.484\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n221\n00:12:24.484 --> 00:12:28.553\nI mentioned that value is perceived.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n222\n00:12:28.553 --> 00:12:29.069\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n223\n00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:34.487\nit's a combination of the outcomes\nthat are achieved plus the preferences\n\n224\n00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:39.770\nthat you have, and we can sometimes\ninfluence value perception.\n\n225\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.060\nSo, I said that I'm just gonna\ngive you 35 grand to buy a car.\n\n226\n00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.950\nWhat is the outcome that we\nwant to facilitate with a car?\n\n227\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.140\nWhat does car do?\n&gt;&gt; Transportation.\n\n228\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.680\n&gt;&gt; Right, it gets us from A to B.\n\n229\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.002\nAnd yet\nwe both have different preferences.\n\n230\n00:12:53.002 --> 00:12:57.065\nSo the outcome that we want to achieve,\nour deliverable, is to get from A to B and\n\n231\n00:12:57.065 --> 00:13:00.208\nyet we both have different preferences.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n232\n00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:01.364\n&gt;&gt; All right, now,\n\n233\n00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:05.374\nall I said earlier on was if you\nhad 35 grand to spend on a car,\n\n234\n00:13:05.374 --> 00:13:07.164\nwhat would you spend it on?\n\n235\n00:13:07.164 --> 00:13:11.588\nNow, let's just say that you were,\n\n236\n00:13:11.588 --> 00:13:16.700\nI was gonna give you Toyota Prius.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n237\n00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.775\n&gt;&gt; Would you perceive as much value in\n\n238\n00:13:19.775 --> 00:13:25.605\nthat Toyota Prius as you would do\nin that other sedan that you had,\n\n239\n00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:31.280\nthat Honda that you were gonna go and buy?\n&gt;&gt; There's so\n\n240\n00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.280\nmay questions that, like,\ndo I get a driver with my Prius?\n\n241\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.614\nOr is the Prius-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n242\n00:13:36.614 --> 00:13:37.175\n&gt;&gt; Okay, no.\n\n243\n00:13:37.175 --> 00:13:38.632\n&gt;&gt; I have an expectations there,\n\n244\n00:13:38.632 --> 00:13:39.643\nis there?\n&gt;&gt; I know right?\n\n245\n00:13:39.643 --> 00:13:41.153\nSetting those expectations.\n\n246\n00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.287\nIf it were free,\n\n247\n00:13:42.287 --> 00:13:47.131\nI would be totally fine with a Prius.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's the point\n\n248\n00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:51.919\nthat I'm trying to make really is the fact\nthat we can influence those perceptions.\n\n249\n00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:55.280\nAnd that goes back to that question of\nwhat stake holder's can you influence?\n\n250\n00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.650\nBecause some people have got a very, very\nstraight perception on what they want.\n\n251\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.705\nThis is not just that preference but\n\n252\n00:14:03.705 --> 00:14:07.037\nthis is all that going to access.\n&gt;&gt; So when it comes to stakeholder\n\n253\n00:14:07.037 --> 00:14:09.848\nmanagement we have to understand\nwho are stakeholders are and\n\n254\n00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:12.220\nwhat stakeholders we can influence.\n\n255\n00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.970\nAnd sometimes stakeholders can be\ninfluenced from a financial basis,\n\n256\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:15.969\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n257\n00:14:15.969 --> 00:14:20.145\nare you trying to insinuate that I\ncan be bought with money here, Jo?\n\n258\n00:14:20.145 --> 00:14:21.821\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That wasn't an insinuation that was\n\n259\n00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:22.460\na statement.\n\n260\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.582\nIt was a statement, pure and simple.\n\n261\n00:14:24.582 --> 00:14:28.231\nYeah, if I get it to you for\nfree and you fell for\n\n262\n00:14:28.231 --> 00:14:28.981\nit.\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n263\n00:14:28.981 --> 00:14:29.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n264\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.398\nyou have to answer the question\nwas stakeholders in order to\n\n265\n00:14:33.398 --> 00:14:36.465\nable to deliver value,\nwhat's in it for them?\n\n266\n00:14:36.465 --> 00:14:37.939\nWhat are they gonna get out of it?\n\n267\n00:14:37.939 --> 00:14:42.290\nUltimately with any project,\nthey want to achieve a deliverable.\n\n268\n00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:46.388\nBut we can as we ascertained,\nwe can influence that\n\n269\n00:14:46.388 --> 00:14:51.083\ndeliverable because we can\ninfluence value perception.\n\n270\n00:14:51.083 --> 00:14:55.536\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nall of our stakeholders because I\n\n271\n00:14:55.536 --> 00:14:59.624\ndon't wanna have that conversation\nwith absolutely everybody.\n\n272\n00:14:59.624 --> 00:15:01.493\nThat's gonna take me a long time and\n\n273\n00:15:01.493 --> 00:15:05.882\nif I got an iteration that's literally two\nweeks long its gonna take me a long time.\n\n274\n00:15:05.882 --> 00:15:09.828\nIt's gonna take me well over two days to\nhave that conversation perhaps with all of\n\n275\n00:15:09.828 --> 00:15:10.749\nmy stakeholders.\n\n276\n00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:16.169\nSo we are gonna use tools like Stakeholder\nMaps and Registrations to understand or\n\n277\n00:15:16.169 --> 00:15:20.660\nregister, sorry to understand and\nlist who our stakeholders are.\n\n278\n00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:26.374\nAnd then define their value to us and\ndefine their importance to us and\n\n279\n00:15:26.374 --> 00:15:29.340\ntheir involvement in our project.\n\n280\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.880\nWe also have to be very careful that\nwe communicate with our stakeholders.\n\n281\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.397\nStakeholders like to know if\ntheir interested in your project,\n\n282\n00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:38.805\nthey want to know what's going on.\n\n283\n00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:43.093\nThey want to see progress perhaps, or\nmaybe they just want to hear that it's\n\n284\n00:15:43.093 --> 00:15:48.033\nstill happening in the background and\nthey don't really care about the progress.\n\n285\n00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:51.002\nThey just want an end date,\nthey want a deliverable date.\n\n286\n00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:56.047\nOr maybe they've got something planned for\na particular day and\n\n287\n00:15:56.047 --> 00:16:01.290\nthey want to make sure that you're\nable to meet that deliverable.\n\n288\n00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.454\nUnderstand who your stakeholders are and\n\n289\n00:16:03.454 --> 00:16:06.450\ncommunicate with your\nstakeholders regularly.\n\n290\n00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.261\nAnd so, Cherokee, when we're\ncommunicating with a stakeholder,\n\n291\n00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.800\nwhat language do we communicate with?\n&gt;&gt; Their language.\n\n292\n00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.105\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n293\n00:16:15.105 --> 00:16:16.915\n&gt;&gt; She said this one so many times before.\n\n294\n00:16:16.915 --> 00:16:19.880\n[LAUGH] I got one right.\n&gt;&gt; You always\n\n295\n00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.430\ncommunicate in the language\nof your audience.\n\n296\n00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.820\nBecause you communicate what's in it for\nme.\n\n297\n00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.720\nYou have to answer that question, but\n\n298\n00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.670\nyou have to answer the question in\na way that they can understand.\n\n299\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.380\nIt's no good me talking\nto you in my language.\n\n300\n00:16:35.515 --> 00:16:40.340\nCuz if I told you that I was going to get\nyou a Hyundai i10, you'd look at me as\n\n301\n00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.370\nthough I was absolutely crazy, cuz you\nwouldn't understand what that meant.\n\n302\n00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.653\nBecause in your language, that really\ndoesn't compute because we don't\n\n303\n00:16:47.653 --> 00:16:50.168\nactually have this car here that you use.\n&gt;&gt; And I like how\n\n304\n00:16:50.168 --> 00:16:52.500\nyou used the word compute for my language.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.290\n&gt;&gt; But that is something very true.\n\n306\n00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.000\nI learned that early on in\nmy career because sometimes\n\n307\n00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.190\nespecially with equipment acquisitions.\n\n308\n00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.780\nSo I wanted to upgrade systems, right?\n\n309\n00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.590\nI know why, and\nall the technical jargon and\n\n310\n00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:11.010\nall those reasons were not important to\nthe person that I had to ask for money.\n\n311\n00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:16.310\nSo just translating that into\na monetary dollar amount and\n\n312\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:21.760\npresenting it to them in money talks,\nJo just taught us that, right?\n\n313\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.840\n[LAUGH] So understanding that language,\nat least in\n\n314\n00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:32.095\nmy experience, they're not gonna be caring\nabout those technical terms or reasons.\n\n315\n00:17:32.095 --> 00:17:36.830\nLike, hey,\nwhat is the cost benefit to me and,\n\n316\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.010\nor my organization?\n&gt;&gt; No, all I taught you was that Cherokee\n\n317\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.080\ncan be bought.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.420\n&gt;&gt; That's what I taught you.\n\n319\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.830\nBut yeah,\nyou have to relate it back to them.\n\n320\n00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.060\nThe communication has to\nrelate back to them and\n\n321\n00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.660\nhas to be something that\nmakes them want to read it.\n\n322\n00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.170\nAnd we talk about having\na communication plan.\n\n323\n00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.380\nAnd how many emails do you deleted\nwithout even opening them or\n\n324\n00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.320\nreading them?\n\n325\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.110\n&gt;&gt; Thousands.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n326\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.830\n&gt;&gt; Seriously, it's ridiculous.\n\n327\n00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.308\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I would say that in one particular\n\n328\n00:18:05.308 --> 00:18:10.670\nemail account that I have, I'd say\nabout 90% of my emails are deleted.\n\n329\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.280\nAnd I don't even open them.\n\n330\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.000\nSo how effective is that as\na method of communication then?\n\n331\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.650\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n332\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.128\nI use that for all of my sign-ups, spam.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:18:21.128 --> 00:18:22.828\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I've got an email account for\n\n334\n00:18:22.828 --> 00:18:23.529\nthat, as well.\n\n335\n00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:26.332\nSo if you are compiling\na communication plan and\n\n336\n00:18:26.332 --> 00:18:30.818\nyou want to communicate with your\nstakeholders, you have to understand how\n\n337\n00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:33.149\nthey want to be communicated to.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n338\n00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:34.982\n&gt;&gt; And also how frequently they want to be\n\n339\n00:18:34.982 --> 00:18:36.325\ncommunicated to.\n\n340\n00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:38.845\nIf you're communicating\nto somebody every hour,\n\n341\n00:18:38.845 --> 00:18:43.345\non the hour, via email,\nmost of those emails are gonna be deleted.\n\n342\n00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:43.935\nAnd the problem\n\n343\n00:18:43.935 --> 00:18:46.940\nis that something important might be lost.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n344\n00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.180\n&gt;&gt; So you have to\n\n345\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.570\nwork out some communication principes for\nall of your stakeholders too.\n\n346\n00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.030\nBecause we've only got between one and\n\n347\n00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.520\nfour weeks per iteration to\ncommunicate with these stakeholders.\n\n348\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.480\nSo our messages have to got to be concise.\n\n349\n00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.590\nThey've gotta be to the point and,\nmore importantly, they've gotta be read.\n\n350\n00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.820\nSo you have to understand who\nyour stakeholders are and\n\n351\n00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.390\nwhat they want to see.\n&gt;&gt; It's so true.\n\n352\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:16.170\nEven just today, looking at\ndifferent methods of communication,\n\n353\n00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.640\nand you were talking earlier about that\nthe customers with that particular bank.\n\n354\n00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.030\nSo if you're trying to send communications\nthrough a channel that the end user\n\n355\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.670\ndoesn't know how to access or doesn't\neven have a way of accessing it, and\n\n356\n00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:34.940\nyou could assume that everyone in this\nmodern day and age communicates this way.\n\n357\n00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.210\nBut that's not always\ngoing to be the case.\n\n358\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.100\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you used that word assume,\n\n359\n00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.072\nand we've already looked in previous\nepisodes at the fact that we don't assume.\n\n360\n00:19:43.072 --> 00:19:44.123\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n361\n00:19:44.123 --> 00:19:45.710\n&gt;&gt; You can't assume.\n\n362\n00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.500\nPeople assume that when they send\nan email that it's going to get\n\n363\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.695\nthrough to that person.\n\n364\n00:19:50.695 --> 00:19:54.550\nI can tell you now that\nwe've got one person here\n\n365\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.130\nin our organization here that\nwhenever they send me an email,\n\n366\n00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.870\nit ends up either in my junk file or\ngoing missing completely.\n\n367\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.230\nAnd there's no rhyme or\nreason behind this.\n\n368\n00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.786\nNo, I haven't blacklisted them.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n369\n00:20:06.786 --> 00:20:09.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] However, it happens.\n\n370\n00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.750\nSo what if your email is the one\nthat's going to the junk file?\n\n371\n00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:18.530\nWhat are you doing about that to ensure\nthat your message is getting through?\n\n372\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.100\nBecause if something like that is\nhappening, how do you elicit feedback?\n\n373\n00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.990\nHow do you say, okay, did you get my\nmessage and did you understand it?\n\n374\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.820\nThat's something else that we've got\nto do in our communication with our\n\n375\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.360\nstakeholders.\n&gt;&gt; Please reply for\n\n376\n00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.960\nacknowledegment.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n377\n00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.105\nYeah, but\nwhat about those annoying read receipts on\n\n378\n00:20:35.105 --> 00:20:36.940\nemails?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n379\n00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how many of you?\n\n380\n00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.854\nCome on, you do it.\n\n381\n00:20:38.854 --> 00:20:40.380\nYou know you do it, right?\n\n382\n00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.660\nHow many actually just click on no when it\nsays do you wanna send the read receipt?\n\n383\n00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.280\nI do it too.\n\n384\n00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.140\nSo I've already talked about\naddressing the what's in it for me?\n\n385\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.120\nThink also about addressing any\nconcerns as well that they may have,\n\n386\n00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.680\nwhich doesn't necessarily direct the\nanswer the question what's in it for me.\n\n387\n00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.850\nBut we want to allay concerns.\n\n388\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.760\nSometimes, especially\nlarge scale projects,\n\n389\n00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.660\nthey may mean the restructuring\nof your organization.\n\n390\n00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.285\nAnd sometimes you may have stakeholders\nthat are feeling very vulnerable or\n\n391\n00:21:15.285 --> 00:21:19.810\nthey're in a position where they're just\n\n392\n00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:24.150\nuncertain about the future or\nuncertain about certain outcomes.\n\n393\n00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:28.610\nEven if you can't answer the outcome\ndirectly,or you can't answer their concern\n\n394\n00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:34.490\ndirectly, you should at least acknowledge\nthat there is a concern there.\n\n395\n00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.010\nYou should at least acknowledge\nthat that concern exists, and\n\n396\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.120\nthat, yes, I understand you're\nfeeling vulnerable right now.\n\n397\n00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.260\nI understand that this is\na period of uncertainty, but\n\n398\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.820\nit will all become clear\nin two weeks time.\n\n399\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.550\nOr this is how we're\ngoing to address that.\n\n400\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:55.770\nEven if you can't answer an question\ndirectly, you should at least address it.\n\n401\n00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.270\nBecause if you don't,\n\n402\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:02.100\nwe've spoken in previous episodes\nabout involvement of our team and\n\n403\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:06.030\ninvolvement of our staff, and it's the\nsame with involvement of our stakeholder.\n\n404\n00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.620\nWe're not going to maintain\nthe buy-in of our stakeholder\n\n405\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.400\nif we don't address their concerns, okay?\n\n406\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.490\nAnd our last bullet point there,\n\n407\n00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.740\nit mentions bringing in\nnon-core members to the team.\n\n408\n00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.190\nBecause we're in an Agile environment,\nit means that we're having one iteration,\n\n409\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.270\nand then another iteration,\nand then another iteration.\n\n410\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:33.900\nAnd we don't have specific\nroles within the team.\n\n411\n00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.290\nAnd so we have and we encourage a lot\nmore collaboration across the team.\n\n412\n00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:43.480\nAnd every morning, we have our stand-up\nand we look to each individual.\n\n413\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.480\nAnd we ask what they're\nspecifically doing for the day.\n\n414\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.510\nAnd it's at that point in time where we\nmight decide that other people have got\n\n415\n00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.950\nmore skills than you have.\n\n416\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.460\nAnd therefore, they might be best\noff doing that particular task.\n\n417\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.570\nAnd it's at that point in time then\nthat we bring that person in to manage\n\n418\n00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:01.600\nthat task.\n\n419\n00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.080\nSo there are no defined roles,\nwhich means that we are very,\n\n420\n00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.200\nvery open to bringing in subject matter\nexperts, to bringing in customers,\n\n421\n00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.990\nor to bringing in other parties\nto help with specific task.\n\n422\n00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.940\nAgain, if you're going to do that,\nthey are a stakeholder.\n\n423\n00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.530\nAnd as such, you need to address that\nconcern, whatever their concerns may be.\n\n424\n00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.160\nYou have to tell them what's in it for\nthem.\n\n425\n00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.755\nAnd some times,\nit comes down to just simply money.\n\n426\n00:23:27.755 --> 00:23:30.610\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nI'll pay you if you do that, right, but\n\n427\n00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:32.790\nyou have to address their concerns.\n\n428\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.360\nSo what we should do, and\nthis is really simple, and\n\n429\n00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.590\nthis concept is just really understand\nwho your stakeholders are, and\n\n430\n00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.706\nwhat their interest is,\nand what their power is.\n\n431\n00:23:44.706 --> 00:23:49.618\nYou see, Cherokee's highly\ninterested in what we're covering\n\n432\n00:23:49.618 --> 00:23:52.750\nhere right now and in the subject matter.\n\n433\n00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:57.070\nBut in terms of power, does she have\nthe power to stop production of this?\n\n434\n00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.151\nNo, absolutely not.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So she's got high interest and\n\n435\n00:24:00.151 --> 00:24:03.347\nlow power, and\nin which case the I'd keep her informed.\n\n436\n00:24:03.347 --> 00:24:04.012\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n\n437\n00:24:04.012 --> 00:24:04.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n\n438\n00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.719\nI'm just gonna tell you what's going on,\nokay?\n\n439\n00:24:06.719 --> 00:24:08.387\nThat's it.\n\n440\n00:24:08.387 --> 00:24:12.856\nNow I'm gonna take my, on the other\nhand Taylor who's our director,\n\n441\n00:24:12.856 --> 00:24:14.410\nbelieve it or not.\n\n442\n00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.320\nHe's got high interest.\n\n443\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.404\nBecause he's the person's that's\nwatching this and he's the person,\n\n444\n00:24:19.404 --> 00:24:22.534\nhe could cut the cord literally.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he could yell cut and\n\n445\n00:24:22.534 --> 00:24:23.753\nwe'd be done for.\n\n446\n00:24:23.753 --> 00:24:25.940\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; We've just been talking to ourselves at\n\n447\n00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.320\nthat point in time.\n\n448\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.870\nHe's got probably low interest\nin the subject matter,\n\n449\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.410\nnow I'm making an assumption here,\nall right.\n\n450\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.155\nBut he's got high power,\n\n451\n00:24:34.155 --> 00:24:38.130\nin which case that I want to make\nsure that we keep him happy.\n\n452\n00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.655\nSo we'll buy him a coffee every now and\nthen even if he doesn't want it.\n\n453\n00:24:41.655 --> 00:24:46.250\n[LAUGH] We want to make sure that we\nkeep him happy, we keep him satisfied.\n\n454\n00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.350\nSo we do something.\n\n455\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.730\nThis is really simple but\nthis is what we call a stakeholder map.\n\n456\n00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.940\nAnd it just really allows\nyou just to focus.\n\n457\n00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.930\nWe won't, what we wanna do is just take\nthis particular map and then just put x\n\n458\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.950\nin for certain people, and just put\nthe main to certain places on that map.\n\n459\n00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Bottom out.\n\n460\n00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:03.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n461\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.940\nit allows you just to identify at\na glance who's really important,\n\n462\n00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.090\nwho you've gotta manage closely,\nand who you've just gotta monitor.\n\n463\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.290\nCuz even though stakeholders\nthat have low interest and\n\n464\n00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:19.500\nhave lower power can still have\na negative effect on your project.\n\n465\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.980\nAll it takes is one negative person\nto undermine all of the positive\n\n466\n00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.450\noutlook of 500 people of an entire team.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n467\n00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.090\ntrue.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all you need is one person.\n\n468\n00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.980\nSo, you need to ensure that even\nthose that have low interest and\n\n469\n00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.380\nlow power, you still got to monitor them.\n\n470\n00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.720\nWe still don't want any\nsources of resistance\n\n471\n00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.250\ncropping up in any of our projects.\n\n472\n00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.640\nAnd sources of resistance are,\nthese are the people and\n\n473\n00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:53.380\nthese are the influencers, the negative\ninfluencers that undermine the project.\n\n474\n00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.300\nNow to get over any sources of resistance,\n\n475\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.600\nwe've got various techniques that\nwe'll look at in a little bit later.\n\n476\n00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.030\nBut one technique or rather one person\nthat we have that will help us is\n\n477\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:11.300\na sponsor, and a sponsor is an influencing\nstakeholder, as in a figurehead.\n\n478\n00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:16.130\nIt's a business leader or senior manager,\nand quite often just because\n\n479\n00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:20.850\nsenior management operation and just\nbecause senior management are seen to be\n\n480\n00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:26.110\nbehind a certain project and\nthey are reinforcing that project.\n\n481\n00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:32.600\nThen that will help to overcome some\nnegativity and some sources of resistance.\n\n482\n00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.280\nSponsors influence, that's what they do.\n\n483\n00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.330\nThe senior management that\ninfluence other stakeholders, okay?\n\n484\n00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.000\nSo we want to ensure that we can\nidentify who our sponsors are.\n\n485\n00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.080\nUltimately we gotta make sure that\nwe can mange our stakeholders\n\n486\n00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.470\nthroughout the project.\n\n487\n00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.420\nNot just as a one-off exercise, not just\nsomething that we do at the start of\n\n488\n00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.240\na project, it's something that\nwe do throughout the project.\n\n489\n00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.780\nSo we ensure that we assess our\nstakeholders, and it's in the middle\n\n490\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.590\non that particular diagram there,\nthat we engage with our stakeholders.\n\n491\n00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:10.350\nAnd then we can understand, once we've\nengaged with them, we understand their\n\n492\n00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.230\nimpact and their influence and\nwhat it is they want to achieve.\n\n493\n00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:19.400\nAnd of course we can influence that, so we\nwanna make sure that we keep them engaged.\n\n494\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.762\nAnd so\nonce we've identified our stakeholders,\n\n495\n00:27:22.762 --> 00:27:26.850\nthat particular circle just\nkeeps going around and around.\n\n496\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.382\nYou see,\nif we manage to achieve one iteration and\n\n497\n00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:33.243\nwe can keep our stakeholders engaged and\n\n498\n00:27:33.243 --> 00:27:38.750\nwe keep our stakeholders satisfied and\nhappy we achieve that iteration.\n\n499\n00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.200\nWe deliver their output,\nwe deliver that deliverable,\n\n500\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.300\nthen they'll be happy and they'll be\nmotivated for the next iteration.\n\n501\n00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.169\nBut again, we've got to keep them engaged,\nand we've got to deliver what they want on\n\n502\n00:27:52.169 --> 00:27:56.530\nthe next iteration because then that keeps\nthem motivated for the next iteration.\n\n503\n00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:00.920\nSo stakeholder management just doesn't\nhappen right at the start of the project.\n\n504\n00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.320\nWe've got to keep managing our\nstakeholders cuz what we do not want\n\n505\n00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.190\nis for any stakeholder to\nbecome a source of resistance.\n\n506\n00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.650\nCuz the source of resistance will\nprevent the success of a project.\n\n507\n00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.340\nAlso think about the fact that\n\n508\n00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.750\ndifferent stakeholders have\ngot different perceptions.\n\n509\n00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.940\nAnd it goes back to that conversation\nthat we had about the con.\n\n510\n00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:30.190\nIf you 35 grand, I've gone and get one\ncar, you go and get something else.\n\n511\n00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.770\nDifferent stakeholders not\nshow the title of our job and\n\n512\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.510\ngo away with something\ncompletely different.\n\n513\n00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.570\nBut different stakeholders have\ndifferent requirements and\n\n514\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.540\nsometimes those requirements conflict.\n\n515\n00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.390\nThen we got to manage it very very\ncarefully because still got to\n\n516\n00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.740\ndeliver a value.\n\n517\n00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:54.257\nWe still got to deliver an output\nthat the stakeholders want and\n\n518\n00:28:54.257 --> 00:28:56.350\nthat they see value in.\n\n519\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:01.225\nBearing in mind that we might have\ntwo different perceptionw or 3 or\n\n520\n00:29:01.225 --> 00:29:03.800\n5 or 20 different perceptions.\n\n521\n00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.020\nAnd therefore,\n20 different preferences, too.\n\n522\n00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.040\nAnd yet what we've been tasked to do is\ndeliver a one size fits all solution.\n\n523\n00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.590\nSo we've got to make sure that\nwe manage our stakeholders and\n\n524\n00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:22.260\nthat we understand,\nsometimes these requirements conflict.\n\n525\n00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.530\nAnd so we have to ensure that\nwe've got our sponsors on\n\n526\n00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.330\nboard because sometimes there\nare gonna be some decisions\n\n527\n00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:34.110\nthat need to be made that aren't going\nto keep every single stakeholder happy.\n\n528\n00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:37.760\nBut then you know what,\nthere's a word that's really important and\n\n529\n00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.250\nthat's the word compromise, and\n\n530\n00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.130\nsometimes we've gotta reach\na compromise between our stakeholders.\n\n531\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:48.210\nYou see, each individual stake holder is\nalways interested in what's in it for me.\n\n532\n00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.820\nThey're always interested\nin how it affects me.\n\n533\n00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:56.420\nIt's about personal benefit,\npersonal gain or personal impact.\n\n534\n00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.930\nThey don't necessarily\nunderstand the whole and\n\n535\n00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:04.140\nthe whole project, more importantly than\nthat they don't care for the most part.\n\n536\n00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:09.180\nLet's face it, we're all interested\nin how certain factors influence us.\n\n537\n00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.950\nSo, our sponsors are going to help us.\n\n538\n00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.620\nThese are our managers.\n\n539\n00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.670\nGuiding sponsors are figureheads\nthat are help, will help to\n\n540\n00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:22.280\nreinforce the message of what's in it for\nthem and also help to see benefits.\n\n541\n00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:27.860\nNow, I've already said we\nneed to think about, well,\n\n542\n00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.220\nthe issues and\nthe concerns that stakeholders have.\n\n543\n00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:35.300\nIf you don't address those concerns\nyou're gonna get negative feeling\n\n544\n00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:40.680\nin our stakeholders, and you're going\nto get conflicts between stakeholders.\n\n545\n00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:46.145\nI don't want to feel Taylor's in a driving\nseat right now, he's a director for\n\n546\n00:30:46.145 --> 00:30:51.121\nour episode, and I don't want to feel\nthat Taylor is going to take notice\n\n547\n00:30:51.121 --> 00:30:56.122\nof Cherokee more than he takes notice\nof me, cuz that wouldn't be fair.\n\n548\n00:30:56.122 --> 00:31:01.080\nBut then Cherokee doesn't want to feel\nas though Taylor's gonna take more\n\n549\n00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.053\nnotice of her than he is of me.\n\n550\n00:31:03.053 --> 00:31:10.022\nSo, we've both got conflicting priorities\nas far as we're concerned, right?\n\n551\n00:31:10.022 --> 00:31:12.755\nEach one of us thinks that we're\nmore important than the other one.\n\n552\n00:31:12.755 --> 00:31:16.267\n[LAUGH] It's true, right?\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n553\n00:31:16.267 --> 00:31:16.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n554\n00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.585\ndescribe me too, just go on, I know.\n\n555\n00:31:19.585 --> 00:31:22.511\nNo, Cherokee's just thinking about\nthe margarita at the end of [CROSSTALK]\n\n556\n00:31:22.511 --> 00:31:23.022\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n557\n00:31:23.022 --> 00:31:24.831\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n558\n00:31:24.831 --> 00:31:26.836\n&gt;&gt; But you see, we all have different,\n\n559\n00:31:26.836 --> 00:31:30.800\nwe all believe, and we all perceive\nthat we have different priorities.\n\n560\n00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.380\nBut there's only one person that\ncan actually identify what those\n\n561\n00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.370\npriorities are, and whose priority is,\nwell, the priority.\n\n562\n00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.530\nAnd from a product perspective,\n\n563\n00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:46.670\nfrom a functionality perspective,\nthat would be the product owner.\n\n564\n00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:51.783\nBut from a team perspective, and\nunderstanding stakeholders and\n\n565\n00:31:51.783 --> 00:31:54.704\nunderstanding the team priorities,\n\n566\n00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:59.882\nthen that would be the scrum master\nthat would make that decision.\n\n567\n00:31:59.882 --> 00:32:03.890\nUltimately, we've got to be able\nto identify our stakeholders.\n\n568\n00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.620\nWe can't manage them until\nwe can identify them.\n\n569\n00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:11.163\nSo that's got to be the first step\nthat we undertake with any project in\n\n570\n00:32:11.163 --> 00:32:16.460\na waterfall approach, we still gotta\nbe able to identify our stakeholders.\n\n571\n00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:20.816\nSo after we've defined our vision and our\nscope, and we've understood the problem\n\n572\n00:32:20.816 --> 00:32:25.190\nstatement then we then have to launch into\nunderstanding who our stakeholders are.\n\n573\n00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:29.000\nAnd who's going to influence and\nbe impacted by our project.\n\n574\n00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.200\nAnd then in our next episode\nwe're going to move into,\n\n575\n00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.110\nwe're going to explore iterations and\nwhat they actually mean for\n\n576\n00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:43.040\nour agile project and how we move\nthrough our agile project life cycle.\n\n577\n00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:43.606\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo,\n\n578\n00:32:43.606 --> 00:32:46.769\nis there anything that you'd like to,\nany kind of final thoughts, or anything\n\n579\n00:32:46.769 --> 00:32:48.642\nyou'd like to share before we close out?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n580\n00:32:48.642 --> 00:32:52.112\nin our next episode we're gonna be looking\nat a specific group of stakeholders,\n\n581\n00:32:52.112 --> 00:32:53.506\nwe're gonna be looking users.\n\n582\n00:32:53.506 --> 00:32:57.440\nBut, for now,\nwe'll leave that just right where it is.\n\n583\n00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:57.990\n&gt;&gt; Perfect,\n\n584\n00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.870\nwell you don't wanna miss the next show.\n\n585\n00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.710\nBut for now let's sign out,\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose,\n\n586\n00:33:02.710 -->

at\n\n8\n00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:26.454\nour stakeholders, but specifically, we'll\nbe identifying, well, who the users are,\n\n9\n00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:30.281\nand with us today, back in studios,\nwe have the lovely Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:33.516\nThank yo for joining us, Jo, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am great, thank you Cherokee,\n\n11\n00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:36.752\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing really good, and\n\n12\n00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:41.075\nI feel like you have a question for me.\n&gt;&gt; How did you know\n\n13\n00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:42.140\nthat?\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n14\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.322\n&gt;&gt; That's called telepathy.\n\n15\n00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:45.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well.\n\n16\n00:00:45.308 --> 00:00:46.602\n&gt;&gt; That's frightening actually.\n\n17\n00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:48.511\n&gt;&gt; I wish I could take credit for that,\n\n18\n00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:52.900\nand pretend that I did have that skill,\nbut you told me you had a question for me.\n\n19\n00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know,\n\n20\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.450\nI did give her a head's up.\n\n21\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.030\nI just said, I'm gonna put you on\nthe spot, is exactly what I said.\n\n22\n00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.080\nSo I'm gonna put her\non the spot right now.\n\n23\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.995\nSo tell me, Cherokee,\nwhat do you think a user is?\n\n24\n00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:05.080\n&gt;&gt; A user, okay,\n\n25\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.755\nwell there's a couple of different,\n\n26\n00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:11.253\n[LAUGH] interpretations on that one.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's think about IT for\n\n27\n00:01:11.253 --> 00:01:12.570\nthe moment.\n&gt;&gt; IT, okay.\n\n28\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.680\n&gt;&gt; Let's keep it clean.\n\n29\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.717\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n30\n00:01:14.717 --> 00:01:18.200\nIT, and\nmy first thought would be an end user.\n\n31\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.670\nWhoever the consumer of something is.\n&gt;&gt; You can, and look, this happens.\n\n32\n00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.930\nThis happens all the time.\n\n33\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.738\nYou cannot answer a question with the same\nword that I used in the question.\n\n34\n00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:30.295\nWhat is a user?\n\n35\n00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:35.076\nIt's a user.\n&gt;&gt; An end user is someone consuming\n\n36\n00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:39.311\nthe product, is that better?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I quite like that.\n\n37\n00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:41.380\nIt sounds as though, I mean-\n&gt;&gt; Product or\n\n38\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.360\nservice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n39\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.990\nI still think it sounds as though\nsomebody's eating something,\n\n40\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990\nwhen you say consuming, but yeah, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n41\n00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm all right with that.\n\n42\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.900\nActually we define a user as somebody\nwho interacts with a product or\n\n43\n00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.480\nwith a process.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n44\n00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.053\n&gt;&gt; Or with a service.\n\n45\n00:01:58.053 --> 00:02:00.571\nSo a user is somebody that interacts with\n\n46\n00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:01.430\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n47\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.306\n&gt;&gt; What's a customer?\n\n48\n00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:07.487\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n49\n00:02:07.487 --> 00:02:09.780\nsomeone,\n&gt;&gt; Go on.\n\n50\n00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.677\n&gt;&gt; I'm having an epiphany,\n\n51\n00:02:11.677 --> 00:02:15.471\nbecause I remember from our training, Jo,\n\n52\n00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:19.019\na customer is someone who interacts,\nbut pays.\n\n53\n00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:22.745\nJust pays.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:23.558\n&gt;&gt; Just pays, okay.\n\n55\n00:02:23.558 --> 00:02:24.367\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, just pays.\n\n56\n00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.554\nDid you notice that pause,\n\n57\n00:02:25.554 --> 00:02:28.058\nthe delayed pause on that one?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm picking up on your facial\n\n58\n00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:29.254\ncues here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n59\n00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:32.638\nshe sensed the disappointment.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know that they pay,\n\n60\n00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:35.679\nI know that that has to happen in\norder to be defined as a customer.\n\n61\n00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:36.334\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n62\n00:02:36.334 --> 00:02:38.169\na customer doesn't always use,\n\n63\n00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.570\nso a customer doesn't always interact.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n64\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.749\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so a customer's not necessarily\n\n65\n00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.960\na user, but a customer can be a user.\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n66\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.820\n&gt;&gt; And not all users are customers.\n\n67\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.420\nBut let's think about earlier on today,\nlet's put this into a real perspective.\n\n68\n00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.580\nEarlier on today,\nwe went and we got coffee.\n\n69\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.120\nIf I buy the coffee, I'm a customer.\n\n70\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.895\nIf I buy you a coffee-\n&gt;&gt; I'm the customer.\n\n71\n00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:10.532\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not.\n\n72\n00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:11.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm the user.\n\n73\n00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.230\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n74\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.859\ncuz I bought you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's why I meant\n\n75\n00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.067\nto say [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is hard work [LAUGH].\n\n76\n00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:21.032\nCuz I've bought you the coffee,\nso you're the user\n\n77\n00:03:21.032 --> 00:03:22.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're the customer,\n\n78\n00:03:22.228 --> 00:03:23.273\nI'm the user.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n79\n00:03:23.273 --> 00:03:25.032\n&gt;&gt; Unless you're also drinking coffee,\n\n80\n00:03:25.032 --> 00:03:28.265\nthen you're a user, and a customer.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right, okay.\n\n81\n00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:29.310\n&gt;&gt; Finally [LAUGH].\n\n82\n00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.650\n&gt;&gt; So let's think about this then from\n\n83\n00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.640\nan IT, well not from an IT perspective,\njust at the moment.\n\n84\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.070\nSo, when we go for coffee,\nthe person that's behind the bar,\n\n85\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.263\nthe barista.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n86\n00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:45.470\n&gt;&gt; Are they interested in whether you like\n\n87\n00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.241\nyour coffee or\nare they interested in whether I'm happy?\n\n88\n00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:51.646\n&gt;&gt; Both.\n\n89\n00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:52.807\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n90\n00:03:52.807 --> 00:03:55.396\n&gt;&gt; Because if I don't like the coffee Jo,\n\n91\n00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:59.631\nand I say, hey, let's go to\nthe other coffee shop down the way,\n\n92\n00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:02.299\nthen even though you're paying for it,\n\n93\n00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.071\nI may have influence on your decision.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's that word, influence.\n\n94\n00:04:07.071 --> 00:04:08.840\nOkay, you influence me.\n\n95\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.094\nSo even though I am the person with\nthe purse strings, you influence me,\n\n96\n00:04:13.094 --> 00:04:16.790\nbecause if we go for coffee and\nyou don't like the coffee, then\n\n97\n00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.574\nwhat's actually going to happen is I'm\njust gonna hear it all the time in my ear.\n\n98\n00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:23.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:24.523\n&gt;&gt; And we're not gonna go-\n\n100\n00:04:24.523 --> 00:04:26.520\n&gt;&gt; Why did you get this rotten coffee Jo?\n\n101\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.230\nI told you last time it was horrible.\n&gt;&gt; So it's up to the coffee\n\n102\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.920\nshop then to make sure that we're\nboth happy, both customers and users.\n\n103\n00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.550\nSo customers are interested\nin the delivery, but\n\n104\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.680\nI'm interested in whether that cup's full.\n\n105\n00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.990\nBut I'm not particularly interested\nin the taste, unless I'm also a user,\n\n106\n00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.590\ncuz you're probably gonna like, and\nyou do, you like coffee that's completely\n\n107\n00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.820\ndifferent to me, and therefore,\nI can't have a judgement on the taste,\n\n108\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.760\nbecause if I'm not drinking it, then it\nreally is down to you to like the taste.\n\n109\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.900\nAll I'm interested in is whether I'm\ngetting value for money as a customer, and\n\n110\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.280\nwhether my cup's full, or\nwhether your cup's full.\n\n111\n00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.360\nSo it's important that we can\ndifferentiate between customers and users.\n\n112\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.040\nAnd now we're gonna start talking about\nusers, because a user is anybody and\n\n113\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.912\nmost customers are users, and\n\n114\n00:05:18.912 --> 00:05:23.890\na user is anybody who's interacting with\na service, or a product, or a process.\n\n115\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.195\nAnd in Agile terms we can\nalso call those actors,\n\n116\n00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:33.341\nbecause they are acting on or\nthey are acting using a system\n\n117\n00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:37.981\nas a facilitator,\nusing the tool as a facilitator.\n\n118\n00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:41.359\nSo we call these actors in our story.\n\n119\n00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:42.730\nWe'll get on to that in a minute.\n\n120\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.053\nUses by the way can also be other tools,\nor other systems,\n\n121\n00:05:47.053 --> 00:05:48.490\nor other processes as well.\n\n122\n00:05:50.812 --> 00:05:53.650\n[LAUGH] All right, okay, yeah?\n\n123\n00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.147\nI caught your face.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n124\n00:05:55.147 --> 00:05:56.574\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:05:56.574 --> 00:05:57.561\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you.\n\n126\n00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:01.439\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A user can be another tool.\n\n127\n00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:02.785\nYou're trying to work that one out now.\n\n128\n00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:03.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:03.355 --> 00:06:04.266\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n130\n00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:05.434\n&gt;&gt; Cuz certain tools,\n\n131\n00:06:05.434 --> 00:06:08.388\nwell let's think about,\nlet's go back into IT and\n\n132\n00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:11.850\nlet's think about sort of\nrelational databases, right?\n\n133\n00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.555\nIf I update, the idea of a relational\ndatabase is that, if I have a core\n\n134\n00:06:16.555 --> 00:06:22.470\ndatabase, let's say I have,\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n135\n00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.620\nI'm thinking about this\non the fly right now.\n\n136\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.040\nBut let's say I have a call login tool,\nright,\n\n137\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.980\nand it gets its information\nfrom the HR database.\n\n138\n00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.960\nSo the information about users, and\nabout what their user ID is, and\n\n139\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.340\nwhere they work, and what they should have\naccess to, comes from the HR database,\n\n140\n00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.240\ntherefore, that core login tool\nis a user of that HR database.\n\n141\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.447\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n142\n00:06:50.447 --> 00:06:51.799\n&gt;&gt; It's a relational database,\n\n143\n00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:53.610\nthere's a relationship in place.\n\n144\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.330\nSo when something updates\non the HR database,\n\n145\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.620\nit should automatically update\nit on the core login tool.\n\n146\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.119\nAs far as that user is concerned and the\ndetails about that user is concern, but\n\n147\n00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:07.119\nit's actually the call login\ntool that is the user,\n\n148\n00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:09.693\nit's using the HR database.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n149\n00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:10.564\n&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?\n\n150\n00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:11.184\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n151\n00:07:11.184 --> 00:07:12.081\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n152\n00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:17.610\na user is not necessarily a physical\nperson, it could be another database,\n\n153\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.140\nit could be another tool,\nit could be another process, for instance.\n\n154\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.991\nOne process can use the output\nfrom another process as well.\n\n155\n00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:30.601\nOkay, that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n156\n00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:31.506\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n157\n00:07:31.506 --> 00:07:35.510\nnow we've explored who could be a user.\n\n158\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.496\nLet's think about what a user wants, and\nin terms of a project, [LAUGH] well,\n\n159\n00:07:40.496 --> 00:07:44.732\nwe've already looked at stakeholders\nin our previous episode.\n\n160\n00:07:44.732 --> 00:07:47.053\nIn part one, we looked at stakeholders and\n\n161\n00:07:47.053 --> 00:07:51.185\nwe identified the fact that different\nstakeholders have different needs.\n\n162\n00:07:51.185 --> 00:07:55.860\nAnd ordinarily, what we will do with\nstakeholders is we will group them.\n\n163\n00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.190\nAnd so,\nwe'll divide our stakeholders into groups.\n\n164\n00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.020\nSo we have our management, and\nthen maybe our sponsors for instance.\n\n165\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.180\nWe might have our external customers,\nand then maybe one stakeholder group.\n\n166\n00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.636\nAnd we also looked at mapping our\nstakeholders in terms of their importance\n\n167\n00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:14.100\nor their power, and the influence\nthat they can have on the project.\n\n168\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.040\nUsers are quite often just sort\nof lumped into one group really,\n\n169\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.410\nthat's our user group.\n\n170\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.095\nProblem is that we got\ndifferent user types.\n\n171\n00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.780\nAnd in that example that\nI've just given you,\n\n172\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.720\nwhen we talk about relational databases,\nwe've got different user types.\n\n173\n00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.340\nIf you think about that HR database, what\nuser types do we have for the HR database?\n\n174\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.920\nYou've got HR personnel themselves,\nand they're sitting there,\n\n175\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.910\nthey're inputting data.\n\n176\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.833\nYou might also have another\nuser of that database,\n\n177\n00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:51.121\nwhich might be something like\nmaybe a taxation system or\n\n178\n00:08:51.121 --> 00:08:55.611\nthe IRS or a financial system\nmay also use the HR database.\n\n179\n00:08:55.611 --> 00:08:58.682\nAs well as within IT our\ncore login system and\n\n180\n00:08:58.682 --> 00:09:04.670\nmaybe our configuration management\nsystem may also use the HR database.\n\n181\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:11.627\nSo people, those HR personnel,\nare only actually one user type and\n\n182\n00:09:11.627 --> 00:09:17.618\nevery single user type, Indeed,\neven go down to the individual level,\n\n183\n00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:21.410\nevery single user will have\ndifferent wants and needs.\n\n184\n00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.723\nIn a previous episode, I made some comment\nabout understanding your users and\n\n185\n00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:29.005\nyour stakeholders and\nthen asking you who was colorblind.\n\n186\n00:09:29.005 --> 00:09:30.890\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n187\n00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.230\n&gt;&gt; We have to understand that they\n\n188\n00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.520\nare stakeholders and we have to understand\n\n189\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.900\nthe nuances like that because everybody\nhas a different want and a different need.\n\n190\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.250\nHow many times have you\nturned around to somebody and\n\n191\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.085\nsaid, a want is not the same as a need?\n\n192\n00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:49.070\n[LAUGH] Quite often,\nespecially to my children.\n\n193\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] and\n\n194\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:55.220\nI could tell you now, when Apple\nreleased this wearable technology,\n\n195\n00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.970\nboy, did I have a watch shaped hole\nin my life at that point in time.\n\n196\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.250\nI needed it.\n\n197\n00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.720\nNo I didn't, I wanted it.\n\n198\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.470\nBut I wonder when we think about projects,\nand this will help\n\n199\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.280\nus prioritize our project, by the way,\nand prioritize our users' stories.\n\n200\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.620\nBut when we think about projects, how many\nof our user needs are actually just wants?\n\n201\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:26.955\nBut the simple fact is that they want\na certain, they want a certain service.\n\n202\n00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:30.460\nOr they want a certain functionality\n\n203\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.890\nbecause they believe it's going to have\na positive impact on the organization.\n\n204\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.190\nAnd they believe that it's gonna have\npositive impact on say, sales for\n\n205\n00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:43.730\ninstance or maybe on our ability to get\nto market quicker than anybody else.\n\n206\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.840\nSo we can't just dismiss wants.\n\n207\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.970\nBecause essentially, even though we tend\nto disguise a lot of our wants as needs,\n\n208\n00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.960\nbut essentially those wants,\nwe want them for a reason.\n\n209\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.670\nAnd it's not just a case of I want\nthem just to show off, right?\n\n210\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.260\nIt's a case of I want them because\nthere's a practical reason behind it.\n\n211\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.660\nAnd quite often,\nwe can influence those ones by the way.\n\n212\n00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.675\nI think of Apple being a perfect example,\n\n213\n00:11:11.675 --> 00:11:15.560\nApple are very proactive\nin their product delivery.\n\n214\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.160\nThey don't wait for us to come to\nthem as users, and customers, and\n\n215\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.350\nsay can I have this please.\n\n216\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.730\nThey're very proactive in this, and\nso, they actually create a need.\n\n217\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.740\nThey don't even identify needs.\n\n218\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.886\nThey actually create that need.\n\n219\n00:11:29.886 --> 00:11:33.234\nAnd when they launch a new product, and\nthey launch it with such a fanfare, and\n\n220\n00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.952\nthen they show you all these features,\nand you have to have it.\n\n221\n00:11:35.952 --> 00:11:37.338\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even know I needed it.\n\n222\n00:11:37.338 --> 00:11:38.879\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n223\n00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:39.483\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:11:39.483 --> 00:11:41.540\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know I needed a watch, but\n\n225\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.860\nI needed one.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.160\n&gt;&gt; I absolutely needed it.\n\n227\n00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.455\nI had this huge watch shaped hole\nin my life, and then I got it.\n\n228\n00:11:48.455 --> 00:11:49.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n229\n00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.770\n&gt;&gt; We call this an inflated peak\n\n230\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.460\nof expectation by the way.\n\n231\n00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.040\nI built this thing up in my head,\nand then I got it, and\n\n232\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.390\nrealized that I'm getting\non a bit in years,\n\n233\n00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.980\nand I need to put my glasses on in\norder to be able to see anything on it.\n\n234\n00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.770\nSo actually, that need [LAUGH],\nwe call that the trough of disillusion.\n\n235\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.550\nAnd that realization\nthat maybe I didn't quite\n\n236\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.949\nneed it in the way that I thought I did.\n\n237\n00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.250\nProject management have a responsibility\nin that, and we talk about the inflated\n\n238\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.870\npeak of expectations, and\nthe trough of disillusionment.\n\n239\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.020\nAnd project management have a huge\npart to play in ensuring that\n\n240\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.350\nthis inflated peak of expectation\nisn't actually an inflated peak,\n\n241\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.290\nand that we set expectations accordingly.\n\n242\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.790\nAnd we looked at setting stakeholder\nexpectations in our previous episode.\n\n243\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.547\nAnd we also, I talked about\nthe fact of underpromising, and\n\n244\n00:12:40.547 --> 00:12:44.350\noverdelivering, when it comes\nto managing expectations.\n\n245\n00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.240\nThat's exactly what we should be\ndoing to prevent then that trough\n\n246\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.390\nof disillusionment when we\nfinally deploy something.\n\n247\n00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.320\nSo what we should do is,\n\n248\n00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.495\nwe use something called user\nstories to capture wants and needs.\n\n249\n00:12:57.495 --> 00:12:59.690\nAnd we look at that in\na different episode,\n\n250\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.860\nwe're gonna be looking\nat defining stories.\n\n251\n00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.900\nBut a story is a want,\n\n252\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:09.570\na story is something that we need to\ndeliver as part of that iteration.\n\n253\n00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.930\nAnd we have many stories, perhaps,\npotentially in in an iteration,\n\n254\n00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.410\nbut it's something that we have to\ndeliver as part of that iteration.\n\n255\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:23.140\nAnd so we have to ensure that we\nprioritize user wants and needs.\n\n256\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.710\nAnd we also talk about reconciling\nuser wants and needs as well,\n\n257\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:33.640\nbecause it's down to the project team\nto make a decision on priorities too.\n\n258\n00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.170\nBecause I might want something,\n\n259\n00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.260\nand Cherokee might want something,\nand ultimately,\n\n260\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.540\nsomebody's got to make the decision\nas to what we're gonna deliver first.\n\n261\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.010\nAnd we've already talked about using\nvarious fun ways of doing that.\n\n262\n00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.883\nAnd rock, paper, scissors perhaps,\n\n263\n00:13:47.883 --> 00:13:51.250\nI think that was the one we talked\nabout in a previous episode.\n\n264\n00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.880\nBut it's a fun way of prioritizing.\n\n265\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.150\nAnd maybe what I want is only gonna take\ntake one day's worth of programming, but\n\n266\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.230\nmaybe what Cherokee wants is gonna take\nseven days worth of programming, so I win.\n\n267\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.790\n[LAUGH]\nJust remember that all\n\n268\n00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.340\nusers are stakeholders, but\nnot all stakeholders are users, and\n\n269\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.930\nit's the same with customers.\n\n270\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:15.520\nOur customers, well, they buy, but\nthey're not necessarily a user.\n\n271\n00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.970\nSo we start off by performing\na stakeholder assessment, and\n\n272\n00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.030\nworking out which one of\nour stakeholders are users.\n\n273\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.850\nSo think about things like, whose gonna\nuse that solution that you are developing,\n\n274\n00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:32.700\nwhat are they going to use it for, and\nalso, how are they going to use it.\n\n275\n00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:39.600\nThat will help you to define your user\nneeds, and also, your training as well.\n\n276\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.120\nYou have to work out who's\ngoing to use the service, and\n\n277\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.920\nexactly how they're going to do it.\n\n278\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.270\nTo be able to deliver a service that\nonly not only meet their needs, but\n\n279\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.580\nworks in a way that they want to work.\n\n280\n00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:58.160\nIt's no good, we talked in a previous\nepisode about a financial institution, and\n\n281\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.530\nthe fact that, I've been in to a financial\ninstitution where they have a huge\n\n282\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:09.530\ndilemma, in that they need to well, they\nneed to bring in new technology, and they\n\n283\n00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:14.970\nneed to bring in sort of new innovative\nways of interacting with customers.\n\n284\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.490\nHowever, their customer demographic\nis over sort of 60 years of age.\n\n285\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.944\nSo how do we do that?\n\n286\n00:15:20.944 --> 00:15:26.640\nAnd it's absolutely no good bringing\nin something like maybe tap to pay for\n\n287\n00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.710\ninstance, when your customers don't have\n\n288\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.310\na cell phone.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n289\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.000\n&gt;&gt; If they don't have a mobile phone,\n\n290\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.320\nthen bringing in tap to pay\nis not going to work anyway.\n\n291\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.040\nSo is that something that you need\nto be investing in right now?\n\n292\n00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.210\nSee, so who your users are really\ndoes influence your project.\n\n293\n00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.890\nAnd it should influence your project.\n\n294\n00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.867\nBut so many organizations when they're\ngoing down the project management route,\n\n295\n00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:53.833\nwhen they're.\n\n296\n00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:56.466\nComing up with new ideas for new services,\n\n297\n00:15:56.466 --> 00:16:00.280\nforget about their users and\nthey forget who their users are.\n\n298\n00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.839\nAnd they bring out this\nwonderful new concept and\n\n299\n00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:06.024\nthis wonderful new functionality and\nthen they deploy it and\n\n300\n00:16:06.024 --> 00:16:10.082\nwonder why it's never used, because\nthey've not thought about their users\n\n301\n00:16:10.082 --> 00:16:13.280\nthey've not thought about the way\ntheir users want to work.\n\n302\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.590\nSo we like things to be\nefficient in Agile, and\n\n303\n00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.930\nwe like to keep things simple as well.\n\n304\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:26.310\nWe like to keep things visible too, and\nwe like the use of some story boards,\n\n305\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.080\nwe like the use of Kanban boards, as well,\n\n306\n00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.800\nto see exactly how much progress\nwe've made in an iteration.\n\n307\n00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.350\nWe also like the use\nof sort of user cards.\n\n308\n00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.210\nNow these can be virtual.\n\n309\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:42.590\nThey can be, we can have them in\na shared directory, if we want to.\n\n310\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:47.080\nHowever, they don't have\nthe same impact as when a card,\n\n311\n00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.420\nwritten out, and stuck on a board.\n\n312\n00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.692\nAnd in the same way that we want to make,\nwe wanna have everybody\n\n313\n00:16:54.692 --> 00:16:59.060\nin the same team and in the same area and\n\n314\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.850\nphysically located together, whether that\nbe sort of using virtual meetings, or\n\n315\n00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.220\nwhether that be by actually\nphysically having people together.\n\n316\n00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.580\nThese storyboards and these boards with\nthe user cards need to be visible.\n\n317\n00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:18.230\nEverybody should be able to see at\na glance, that's the most efficient.\n\n318\n00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:23.077\nSo we'll use user cards, and\nreally the user card is just about\n\n319\n00:17:23.077 --> 00:17:28.200\nthinking of every single or\nidentifying every single user type and\n\n320\n00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.900\nthen summarizing them in terms\nof their key activities.\n\n321\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.440\nIn terms of their desires,\ntheir wants, their ways of working,\n\n322\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.860\ntheir incentives and also the pressures\nthat they're under as well.\n\n323\n00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.730\nAnd user cards just highlight\nsort of the strengths or\n\n324\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.430\nweaknesses as well in terms of skills.\n\n325\n00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.180\nWhat do our users know?\n\n326\n00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.420\nWhat don't they know?\n\n327\n00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.480\nWhat training will they need?\n\n328\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.650\nAnd also what level of support they need?\n\n329\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.260\nAnd that might also include what level\nof support they're currently used to?\n\n330\n00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:05.230\nIf you're moving somebody from\na face-to-face user support and\n\n331\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.190\nas part of the project, you're moving\nthem to an online user support,\n\n332\n00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.850\nwhere they've got chat capability, it's\ngonna need more than just training for\n\n333\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:19.070\nyour users in order to get to that point,\nwhere they're using the chat.\n\n334\n00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.830\nYou're gonna have to have a transitional\nperiod, cuz users are gonna have to get\n\n335\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:27.920\nused to that and they're going to\nhave to transition to using chat.\n\n336\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.440\nWe first of all gonna demonstrate success,\nand demonstrate that chat works, before we\n\n337\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:38.080\ncan then start dropping off support\nover the telephone or face-to-face.\n\n338\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.267\nSo these user cards don't cover\nthe specific wants and needs,\n\n339\n00:18:42.267 --> 00:18:47.718\nwe document those in the user story, but\nthe user cards just document a user type,\n\n340\n00:18:47.718 --> 00:18:52.221\nand they look at the strengths and\nweaknesses of that user type, and\n\n341\n00:18:52.221 --> 00:18:56.102\nthey look the way of working\nof that particular user type.\n\n342\n00:18:57.984 --> 00:19:03.058\nAgile is built on collaboration\nbetween both the development team and\n\n343\n00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:07.358\nthe business, so\nwe can look back at our Agile principles,\n\n344\n00:19:07.358 --> 00:19:11.920\nback at our first or\nsecond episode in this particular series.\n\n345\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.130\nUser cards,\nthey'll supplement collaboration, but\n\n346\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:23.420\nyou should always have an open-ended\ncommunication with your user group.\n\n347\n00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:28.500\nI should always be able to,\nas a developer, talk to Cherokee about\n\n348\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.480\nthe way that she works and about\nthe product that I'm developing for her.\n\n349\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.600\nI should always be able to elicit her\nfeedback and asked for her ideas as well.\n\n350\n00:19:39.655 --> 00:19:43.420\nCollaboration is key,\nit´s one of our values in Agile,\n\n351\n00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:48.730\nand it´s something that we have to\nuphold with every single iteration.\n\n352\n00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:53.070\nNow that said, we could avoid\nthis sort of open door policy,\n\n353\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:58.060\nbecause I don´t want Cherokee interrupting\nme every single minute of the day.\n\n354\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.980\nNow, I'm not saying that we\nshould close the door and\n\n355\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.220\nmake sure that nobody can talk to us,\nbut we have to ensure that\n\n356\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.092\nthe collaboration is structured.\n&gt;&gt; So like providing specific times for\n\n357\n00:20:10.092 --> 00:20:13.405\nme to stop by and chat with you?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's also,\n\n358\n00:20:13.405 --> 00:20:16.570\nit's making sure that I'm productive.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n359\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.670\n&gt;&gt; So, it’s really basic time management,\n\n360\n00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.580\nand nothing more than that.\n\n361\n00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:26.000\nIt’s about understanding that maybe my\nproductive time of the day is between\n\n362\n00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.090\nthe hours of, say, 8am and 11am,\nthat’s when I’m most productive.\n\n363\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:35.357\nSo what I’m probably going to do, is I’m\ngoing to spend between 8 and 8:15 or\n\n364\n00:20:35.357 --> 00:20:38.150\n8:30 talking to you, And\n\n365\n00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:42.120\nthen I'm gonna spend the rest of\nthe day working on development work.\n\n366\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.330\nAnd I don't wanna talk to you for\nthose two and a half hours, or\n\n367\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.670\nthose three and a half hours,\nI just really don't wanna talk to you.\n\n368\n00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.774\nAnd then in the afternoon,\nI'm not quite as productive, and\n\n369\n00:20:51.774 --> 00:20:55.236\nthen I might catch up with you again\nmid-way through the afternoon.\n\n370\n00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:59.763\nBut I wanna ensure that I\nuse my productive time to,\n\n371\n00:20:59.763 --> 00:21:02.614\nwell, to deliver my best work.\n\n372\n00:21:02.614 --> 00:21:03.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; For you.\n\n373\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.890\nI'm not gonna deliver my best work if\nyou're going to interrupt me during\n\n374\n00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.260\nmy productive time.\n\n375\n00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:14.300\nSo I wanna make sure\nthat I adhere to my own\n\n376\n00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.370\npolicy of making my productive time,\nproductive.\n\n377\n00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.390\nSo, we should filter access\nthrough the product owner\n\n378\n00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.790\nif it's appropriate to do so.\n\n379\n00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:29.320\nWe should make sure that, as developers,\nthat we're not distracted.\n\n380\n00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.970\nAnd that means that we're not\ndistracted by people walking around.\n\n381\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.500\nIf we are going to be productive,\nwe've gotta be aware of when our\n\n382\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.950\nproductive time is, and then we've\nalso gotta keep our conversations and\n\n383\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.550\nkeep our general interaction to\ncertain times during the day,\n\n384\n00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.210\nthat's how we become efficient and\neffective.\n\n385\n00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:54.080\nAnd the other thing that we should also\ndo, and you know what, it should be common\n\n386\n00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:00.470\nsense, but you should update people\non a regular basis on your progress.\n\n387\n00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.670\nBear in mind that each iteration is\nbetween one and four weeks in length.\n\n388\n00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.330\nSo you should update people on\na regular basis as to your progress,\n\n389\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.740\nbecause I will guarantee,\nif I only update Cherokee once a week,\n\n390\n00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.920\non my progress, she's gonna come,\nand she's gonna stop by, and\n\n391\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.292\nshe's gonna interrupt me, because she's\ngonna want to know how things are going.\n\n392\n00:22:19.292 --> 00:22:26.260\nSo you only want interruption\nat certain times during the day,\n\n393\n00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.120\nbut you also want to be more proactive\nto try and prevent those interruptions.\n\n394\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.860\nSo I've got a good\nrelationship with Cherokee, so\n\n395\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.630\nI am going to update Cherokee.\n\n396\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.920\nI know what she wants.\n\n397\n00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.900\nSo I'm going to update her with\nthat on a daily basis maybe or\n\n398\n00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.295\nmaybe every other day, and then that\nstops her coming and pestering me.\n\n399\n00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:45.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.610\n&gt;&gt; Not that that's a hint or\n\n401\n00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.820\nanything like that, all right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.335\n&gt;&gt; I'm just soaking it all in Jo.\n\n403\n00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:52.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah I know she's making notes\n\n404\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.460\nfor later.\n\n405\n00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.812\nUltimately we don't\nwanna exclude our users.\n\n406\n00:22:57.812 --> 00:22:59.680\n[LAUGH] Maybe we do.\n\n407\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.375\nSome of them we probably did.\n\n408\n00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:03.810\n[LAUGH] We don't wanna exclude our users.\n\n409\n00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.690\nWe wanna make sure that they feel as\nthough they're part of the team and\n\n410\n00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.740\nthey understand that what we're delivering\nis something for them, and that\n\n411\n00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.050\nthey find valuable, but at the same time,\nwe've gotta make sure that as a team, and\n\n412\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:20.230\nas an Agile team, that we are productive\nthroughout each iteration.\n\n413\n00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.690\nAnd so that's it as far as\nthe stakeholders are concerned.\n\n414\n00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.790\nBut if you have any questions\nwith regards to stakeholders or\n\n415\n00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.270\nstakeholder management, then.\n&gt;&gt; Don't ask Jo.\n\n416\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't ask me.\n\n417\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.385\n&gt;&gt; You can wait a day and\n\n418\n00:23:32.385 --> 00:23:35.210\nthen ask her [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n419\n00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.790\nonly ask me at certain times of the day.\n\n420\n00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:42.740\nSo just send us a message if you have any\nquestions at certain times of the day and\n\n421\n00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.620\nthat's when I'll reply to you.\n&gt;&gt; No, but in all seriousness,\n\n422\n00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.770\nif you do have questions,\nyou can always email Cherokee@ITProTV for\n\n423\n00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.580\nthose questions, and\nI will be the one to harass and\n\n424\n00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.500\ntrack down Jo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.660\n&gt;&gt; And give you those answers.\n\n426\n00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.710\nBut I think that's about it for\nthis episode, right,\n\n427\n00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:58.360\nJo?\n&gt;&gt; It is,\n\n428\n00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.222\nyes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay cool,\n\n429\n00:23:59.222 --> 00:24:01.140\nwell then let's go ahead and sign out.\n\n430\n00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.890\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n431\n00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.647\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITPro.TV.\n\n432\n00:24:06.647 --> 00:24:12.615\n[MUSIC]\n\n433\n00:24:12.615 --> 00:24:15.791\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:15.346\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:17.387\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.387 --> 00:00:21.313\nIn this episode we'll take a look\nat how we can build an Agile team.\n\n8\n00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:27.040\nAnd to help build these concepts up for\nus are going to be Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.026\nThat was really bad.\n\n10\n00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:31.179\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not saying anything but yes,\n\n11\n00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.010\nyes it was.\n\n12\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.681\n[LAUGH] It's great to be back Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.639\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how are you Jo?\n\n14\n00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:38.717\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I see you need some help.\n\n15\n00:00:38.717 --> 00:00:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you need my help.\n\n16\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.363\n&gt;&gt; I need you to build me a nice structure\nto flow in and segue into our topic.\n\n17\n00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:49.130\nDo you think you could do that for us?\n\n18\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.422\n&gt;&gt; That was terrible.\n\n19\n00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:51.189\n&gt;&gt; That was worse.\n\n20\n00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:52.339\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was terrible,\n\n21\n00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:53.833\nyou just carry on digging.\n\n22\n00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:57.790\nCarry on digging, and I'll build you\na ladder to get out, how about that?\n\n23\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.532\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:00:59.532 --> 00:01:00.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay,\n\n25\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.249\nin case you haven't guessed,\nin this particular section,\n\n26\n00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.090\nwe're going to be talking\nabout building an Agile team.\n\n27\n00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.748\nThat makes me very agile in this\nparticular circumstance, but\n\n28\n00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:10.870\nwe're all right.\n\n29\n00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.827\nWe are going to be looking at,\nactually resourcing our project and\n\n30\n00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:18.855\nmaking sure that we've got the right\npeople with the right skills,\n\n31\n00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:21.625\nin order to be able to\ndeliver the end product.\n\n32\n00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:27.002\n&gt;&gt; And this is actually a huge,\nlike it's a very important role or\n\n33\n00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.850\nduty here, it's not easy work.\n\n34\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.877\nI mean I guess maybe it comes\nnaturally to some people.\n\n35\n00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:37.515\nBut finding the right pieces for\nthis puzzle can be difficult.\n\n36\n00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:39.097\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI quite like what you just said and\n\n37\n00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:41.582\nI know that I laugh about some of\nthe things that Cherokee said.\n\n38\n00:01:41.582 --> 00:01:42.624\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I actually quite\n\n39\n00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:43.530\nlike what you said.\n\n40\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.142\n&gt;&gt; The puzzle?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n41\n00:01:44.142 --> 00:01:46.380\ncuz you talked about pieces in a puzzle.\n\n42\n00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.915\nAnd building a team for an Agile project\nis not quite as simple as it sounds.\n\n43\n00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:55.660\nIn a traditional waterfall style approach,\nwe assign roles and\n\n44\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.750\nresponsibilities to those roles.\n\n45\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.694\nAnd so what we'll do is we have\nvarious people that are already,\n\n46\n00:02:01.694 --> 00:02:05.650\nthe project analyst,\nthey're already part of a project team.\n\n47\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.859\nAnd that's who we'll use\nwithin our project, and\n\n48\n00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.326\nthen we'll give them specific roles.\n\n49\n00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:15.726\nWell, we don't do that within our Agile\nproject because that is not considered to\n\n50\n00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:16.910\nbe efficient.\n\n51\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.512\nWe want people to come into work on their\ntask and then they need to go off and\n\n52\n00:02:21.512 --> 00:02:26.207\ndo something else, whatever it is that\ntheir skills will allow them to do.\n\n53\n00:02:26.207 --> 00:02:28.120\nSo whatever suits their skills.\n\n54\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.521\nSo we only want people of certain skills\nthat are here for their specific task.\n\n55\n00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:36.700\nWe don't necessarily need\nan entire project team.\n\n56\n00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.254\nSo the approach to building a project team\nin Agile is very much like sort of getting\n\n57\n00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:43.444\nthe right pieces to make that picture.\n\n58\n00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:46.324\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's not really about having all of\n\n59\n00:02:46.324 --> 00:02:49.204\nthese people and then making them fit.\n\n60\n00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:52.075\nAnd in fact, actually that's\nthe last thing that we want to do.\n\n61\n00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:55.040\nWe wanna efficient in an Agile project.\n\n62\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.740\nWe want to be able to deliver\nproduct on a regular basis.\n\n63\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.074\nBut quickly, let's face it,\nevery sort of one to four weeks is quick.\n\n64\n00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:10.550\nSo we want to be able to deliver products\nefficiently as well as effectively.\n\n65\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.994\nAnd that means having the right people\nin place to do the right undertaking and\n\n66\n00:03:15.994 --> 00:03:21.100\ncode the right program in order to be\nable to deliver the right project but\n\n67\n00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.119\njust in time.\n\n68\n00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.730\nThis is not something where we\nwant people just sitting around.\n\n69\n00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.447\nIt's a waste of money, and it's\na waste of resources to have them just\n\n70\n00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:33.059\nsitting around doing nothing, just waiting\nfor their particular skill to be needed.\n\n71\n00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.998\n&gt;&gt; Time to shine.\n\n72\n00:03:33.998 --> 00:03:35.019\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n73\n00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna do that.\n\n74\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.292\nWe'll just bring people in at that\nparticular point in time when we need\n\n75\n00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:42.267\ntheir skill.\n\n76\n00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:47.615\nSo in a lot of respect, as I've\nalready said, we don't use the water\n\n77\n00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:53.640\nfall approach to plan in at all,\nbecause we're planning per each duration.\n\n78\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.307\nSo there's actually lesser\nfrom resource planning.\n\n79\n00:03:56.307 --> 00:04:00.240\nWe don't do it all in one goal,\nbecause we don't know what we need.\n\n80\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.093\nYou remember in our Agile approach,\nI've always said right from the start\n\n81\n00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:09.405\nof our series that we don't plan\nthe long term in any great detail,\n\n82\n00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:10.474\nbecause-\n&gt;&gt; Rough.\n\n83\n00:04:10.474 --> 00:04:11.169\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n84\n00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.224\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n85\n00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:15.111\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now you've got your acronym,\n\n86\n00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:16.385\nwhat does it mean?\n\n87\n00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:19.517\n&gt;&gt; Man, bring resources upfront.\n\n88\n00:04:19.517 --> 00:04:20.929\n&gt;&gt; Business requirements.\n\n89\n00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:21.871\n&gt;&gt; Business requirements upfront.\n\n90\n00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:23.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n91\n00:04:23.118 --> 00:04:26.789\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so we understand the business\n\n92\n00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.916\nrequirements but\nwe don't actually plan in great detail,\n\n93\n00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:36.010\nwe don't plan a long\nterm to the nth degree.\n\n94\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.885\nWe will work out our vision, and\nthen we understand our problem story,\n\n95\n00:04:40.885 --> 00:04:45.776\nour overall problem statement that\nwe looked at in a previous episode.\n\n96\n00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:51.180\nBut in terms of the iterations, in terms\nof user stories and user problems.\n\n97\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.710\nIt's only by working out what\nI use a stories are, and\n\n98\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.577\nby understanding which user's story\nwill be featured in each iterations\n\n99\n00:04:59.577 --> 00:05:02.654\nthat we can then identify\nwhat skills we need.\n\n100\n00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:08.179\nBecause those user's stories can change\ndepending on our achievement for\n\n101\n00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:12.620\nthe previous user story or\nfor the previous iteration.\n\n102\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.683\nAnd our vision could change as well.\n\n103\n00:05:14.683 --> 00:05:19.390\nRemember what we said in previous episodes\nabout we actually embrace change.\n\n104\n00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.884\nWe acknowledge that change happens and\nno, we don't call it scope creep.\n\n105\n00:05:23.884 --> 00:05:27.476\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No creeps here, just change, no creeps.\n\n106\n00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:30.506\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no creeps in Agile.\n\n107\n00:05:30.506 --> 00:05:32.440\nNo creeping, absolutely not.\n\n108\n00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.548\n&gt;&gt; It's like a TLC song I think.\n\n109\n00:05:35.548 --> 00:05:37.738\n&gt;&gt; TLC, isn't that a channel?\n\n110\n00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:39.199\n&gt;&gt; Anyhow.\n\n111\n00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n112\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n113\n00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:46.063\nI have a completely\ndifferent frame of mind.\n\n114\n00:05:46.063 --> 00:05:48.455\nI'm old, you forget about that, right?\n\n115\n00:05:48.455 --> 00:05:50.714\nI'm old and if it's not got\nanything to do with The Beatles or\n\n116\n00:05:50.714 --> 00:05:52.190\nThe Rolling Stones then I don't know.\n\n117\n00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.416\n&gt;&gt; No, I think it was probably No Scrubs\nanyways but that's a whole another story.\n\n118\n00:05:57.416 --> 00:06:01.085\n&gt;&gt; I always thought that had\nsomething to do with uniforms, but-\n\n119\n00:06:01.085 --> 00:06:03.071\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well stay focused.\n\n120\n00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.615\n&gt;&gt; Stay focused, yes.\n\n121\n00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:07.746\nWhich is exactly what Agile\nis all about funnily enough.\n\n122\n00:06:07.746 --> 00:06:10.563\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's actually making most use of\n\n123\n00:06:10.563 --> 00:06:15.131\nour productive time rather than\nof our non productive time.\n\n124\n00:06:15.131 --> 00:06:18.276\nOkay, so in terms of planning for\nthe long-term,\n\n125\n00:06:18.276 --> 00:06:20.406\nthat goal is gonna change, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:20.406 --> 00:06:24.815\nWe are going to have [LAUGH] a differing\nvision by the end of our project,\n\n127\n00:06:24.815 --> 00:06:27.605\nnot as well creep, but a differing vision.\n\n128\n00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:29.402\nAnd we acknowledge that,\nand we accept that.\n\n129\n00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:32.381\nSo there's absolutely no\npoint in planning for\n\n130\n00:06:32.381 --> 00:06:35.071\nthe long-term resources right up front.\n\n131\n00:06:35.071 --> 00:06:36.880\nCuz we don't know what\nwe're going to need.\n\n132\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.850\nSo we plan this iteration bearing in mind\nthat this iteration lasts between one and\n\n133\n00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.649\nfour weeks.\n\n134\n00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:44.970\nThat means we've got to\nhave people available.\n\n135\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.710\nWe've got to have people\navailable to us at our disposal.\n\n136\n00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.610\nSo we've got to have people who've\ngot a wide skill set as well.\n\n137\n00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.964\nWe don't actually break down these\nspecific tasks in the specific\n\n138\n00:06:59.964 --> 00:07:06.666\nworkload until we know the user story and\nwe know what tasks and workload there are.\n\n139\n00:07:06.666 --> 00:07:08.901\nAnd then when we assign priorities,\n\n140\n00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:13.340\nthat's when we would assign those\nparticular tasks to the people.\n\n141\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.914\nSo therefore, we've gotta have\npeople with a wide range in skills.\n\n142\n00:07:17.914 --> 00:07:23.139\nBut we don't want to have\neverybody with specific skills or\n\n143\n00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.550\nwith a comprehensive skill set.\n\n144\n00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.850\nWe want to have at our disposal\nthose resources that do have\n\n145\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.877\nthe specialist skills that we need but\nwe want them at our disposal.\n\n146\n00:07:35.877 --> 00:07:40.267\nWhat we really need for any project team\nis a good dynamic, a good team dynamic\n\n147\n00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:44.770\nwhere everybody is collaborative and\neverybody is working together.\n\n148\n00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.958\nWe have the stand up meeting every\nsingle morning without fail.\n\n149\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.750\nWe have a stand up meeting.\n\n150\n00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.175\nAnd that's really well, not only doing it\noutline, each individual have the task for\n\n151\n00:07:57.175 --> 00:08:01.560\nthe day but it gives all the team\nmembers the opportunity to say, hey,\n\n152\n00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.126\nlook I can help you with this Or\nI've got better skills than you've got.\n\n153\n00:08:06.126 --> 00:08:09.171\nAnd by the way,\nthat's not a reflection on your skills,\n\n154\n00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:12.857\nit's just that I could probably do\nit more efficiently than you can.\n\n155\n00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.076\nHaving a distributed team,\na team that's all over the place,\n\n156\n00:08:19.076 --> 00:08:21.391\na team that's in various locations, and\n\n157\n00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:27.070\nI've already spoken about this in previous\nepisodes, is not going to be efficient.\n\n158\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.890\nSo we prefer teams in Agile,\n\n159\n00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.840\nwe know that it's more efficient to\nhave a team all in one location.\n\n160\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.700\nNow yes, you can achieve that by\nthe utilization of virtual software.\n\n161\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.060\n&gt;&gt; To mimic that\nface-to-face communication?\n\n162\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:47.485\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, but bearing in mind,\nand we've spoken in previous episodes\n\n163\n00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:53.020\nabout the fact that we have a team here in\nthe US and we also have a team in the UK.\n\n164\n00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.540\nThere are time zones, as well that\nexist between some of our teams.\n\n165\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.670\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n166\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.260\n&gt;&gt; We've gotta make sure that we're at our\nmost productive when we are coding and\n\n167\n00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.840\nwhen we are developing,\nwe've got to be productive.\n\n168\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.890\nHow do you do that with a team that's\ngot a differing time zone to you?\n\n169\n00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.510\nIt's incredibly difficult, because you\nsee, when I'm at my most productive is\n\n170\n00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.500\nfirst thing on a morning,\nthat's when I'm at my most productive.\n\n171\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:26.480\nLet's say I am 5 hours ahead of you,\nif you're telling me that\n\n172\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:33.070\nI don't actually start work until, say\n1:00 PM in the afternoon, what do you do?\n\n173\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.520\n&gt;&gt; Because that window of overlap and\nthe time is going to be closing in, so\n\n174\n00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:45.500\nwhat has preference or priority, the\nproductive times or the necessary times?\n\n175\n00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Right, because you see, if you're\nasking me to start work at 1:00 PM and\n\n176\n00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.400\nthen I don't finish until\n10:00 PM in the evening,\n\n177\n00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.930\nI am not going to be productive\nat that time of day.\n\n178\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.621\nIn fact, I should be sitting at\nhome with a margarita in my hand\n\n179\n00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:02.887\nrather than trying to work on some coding.\n\n180\n00:10:02.887 --> 00:10:05.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So who do you think it is that makes\n\n181\n00:10:05.202 --> 00:10:06.268\nthat decision?\n\n182\n00:10:06.268 --> 00:10:11.420\n&gt;&gt; You love to trip me up on these,\nJo, correct me if I'm wrong here,\n\n183\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.100\nbut I think that directly\naffects the product.\n\n184\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.306\nSo if it directly affects the product,\nthen it's going to be that product owner?\n\n185\n00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:20.265\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n186\n00:10:20.265 --> 00:10:21.082\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n187\n00:10:21.082 --> 00:10:26.672\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, it's not, it's the scrum\n\n188\n00:10:26.672 --> 00:10:32.410\nmaster, because he is responsible for\nfacilitating the team dynamic.\n\n189\n00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.300\nHe's responsible for making sure that\nwe've got the right people on hand\n\n190\n00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.990\nwith the right amount of\nskills to do the job.\n\n191\n00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:43.200\nAnd he's responsible for resolving any\nconflict and getting over any obstacles.\n\n192\n00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.390\nSo it's actually the scrum master\nthat is responsible for this.\n\n193\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n194\n00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.420\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna make that decision,\nso that question that you asked.\n\n195\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.730\nIs it more important that we have people\nworking on the same time zone and\n\n196\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.510\nwe have people working together?\n\n197\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.415\nOr is it more important that we have\npeople at their most productive, but\n\n198\n00:11:00.415 --> 00:11:01.490\nthen they'll be working in isolation?\n\n199\n00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.640\nI don't have an answer to that, because\nthat's gotta be specific to the project.\n\n200\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.560\nSo the only person that does have\nthe answer to that is the scrum master,\n\n201\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.560\nand he has to make that decision.\n\n202\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.303\nAnd it is a decision\nthat you need to make,\n\n203\n00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:22.560\nwhen you're talking about\ncross-geographical teams.\n\n204\n00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.683\nYou've also got to consider language\nas well, and the language barrier,\n\n205\n00:11:27.683 --> 00:11:29.895\nand the fact that we all\nuse different words.\n\n206\n00:11:29.895 --> 00:11:34.340\n[LAUGH] And even though we're talking\nabout the difference between the US and\n\n207\n00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.110\nthe UK, we still use different words.\n\n208\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.630\nAnd we have different accents and\ndifferent things,\n\n209\n00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.990\nwe might use the same word but\nit might have different meanings.\n\n210\n00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.890\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n211\n00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and boy, does it get\nme in some hot water sometimes.\n\n212\n00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.280\n[LAUGH]\nBut that's something again,\n\n213\n00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.430\nthat the scrum master has to be aware of,\nbecause you cannot lead a team.\n\n214\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.050\nYou can't manage a team if you\ndon't understand your team.\n\n215\n00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.775\nSo developing the team\nreally means that for\n\n216\n00:12:04.775 --> 00:12:09.405\nevery iteration we have to,\nand this is not optional,\n\n217\n00:12:09.405 --> 00:12:14.450\nwe have to identify what skills\nwe need for that iteration.\n\n218\n00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:20.040\nSo across the team,\nwhat skills do we need for each iteration?\n\n219\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.090\nWhat skills do we need for each project?\n\n220\n00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:28.590\nAnd it's by analyzing the required skills,\n\n221\n00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.240\nthat's how we'll identify\nwho our team should be.\n\n222\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:41.240\nOur team is not necessarily made up\nof people within our environment.\n\n223\n00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.030\nOur team is actually made up of\npeople from within our environment,\n\n224\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.080\nmaybe external contractors,\nmaybe external third parties,\n\n225\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.940\nif they're helping us\nto deliver a product.\n\n226\n00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.915\nAnd then the team could also be made up\nof our customers and our users as well.\n\n227\n00:12:57.915 --> 00:13:01.357\nOur team is not just made up\nof developers, and of course,\n\n228\n00:13:01.357 --> 00:13:06.280\nwhen we start thinking about DevOps and\nthe DevOps environment, then we've gotta\n\n229\n00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.450\nthink about bringing in our operational\npeople into our team as well.\n\n230\n00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.450\nWhat skills do you think our\noperational people will bring?\n\n231\n00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.255\n&gt;&gt; This is a hard one too, Jo.\n\n232\n00:13:21.255 --> 00:13:27.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know, maybe operation,\n\n233\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:32.870\nso we're talking about maintenance, we're\ntalking about managing that maintenance.\n\n234\n00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n235\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we're talking about\nensuring customer satisfaction?\n\n236\n00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.745\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm asking you what skills\nthey're gonna bring to the [INAUDIBLE]\n\n237\n00:13:40.745 --> 00:13:43.843\n&gt;&gt; Skills, okay, so we're looking at time\n\n238\n00:13:43.843 --> 00:13:49.430\nmanagement, we're looking at technical\nas well as intrapersonal here.\n\n239\n00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.731\nSo are those specific enough?\n\n240\n00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:55.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You definitely need like network\n\n241\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.520\nmanagement skills, so you're looking for\nnetwork administration.\n\n242\n00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.142\nYou're looking for debuggers to\naddress the concerns from the customer\n\n243\n00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:07.852\nservice reps that are maybe receiving\nthose incoming calls or concerns.\n\n244\n00:14:07.852 --> 00:14:09.691\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're desperately\ntrying to get there, I know.\n\n245\n00:14:09.691 --> 00:14:11.748\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying, I really am.\n\n246\n00:14:11.748 --> 00:14:15.723\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You've kinda mentioned\neverything, but let's look at\n\n247\n00:14:15.723 --> 00:14:20.800\nwhat skills they bring and what value\nthey bring into the development team.\n\n248\n00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.705\nCuz when you talk about debugging,\n\n249\n00:14:22.705 --> 00:14:26.080\nI don't expect any of my operational\nguys to be able to do that.\n\n250\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I don't expect them to do that,\n\n251\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.340\nI don't expect them to know how to and\nit's not actually their role.\n\n252\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.286\nWhat I expect the operational guys to\nbring is I expect them to bring in their\n\n253\n00:14:36.286 --> 00:14:38.550\ncustomer service skills.\n\n254\n00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.540\nI expect them to bring in\ntheir business knowledge, so\n\n255\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.200\ntheir understanding of what\nthe customer and the user wants.\n\n256\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.320\nAnd also their understanding of how\nthe customer and the user works.\n\n257\n00:14:50.445 --> 00:14:55.900\nCuz the developers have got to develop\nsomething in a way that the users can use.\n\n258\n00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.940\nSo I expect customer service guys,\nour service desk and\n\n259\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.550\nour operations guys to bring that in.\n\n260\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:09.010\nI also expect operations guys\nto use their translation skills.\n\n261\n00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.460\n&gt;&gt; Bridging the gap.\n\n262\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.140\n&gt;&gt; Right, how many developers\ndo you know that feel actually\n\n263\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.100\ncomfortable talking to users and\ncustomers?\n\n264\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, [LAUGH] not too many.\n\n265\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.365\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nwe've all got our own skill set.\n\n266\n00:15:22.365 --> 00:15:28.140\nAnd a lot of developers don't particularly\nlike talking to customers and users.\n\n267\n00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.410\nAnd to be perfectly honest, a lot of\ncustomers and users don't particularly\n\n268\n00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:36.820\nlike talking to developers because we\nspeak a completely different language.\n\n269\n00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.260\nBut our operations guys are used\nto talking to customers and\n\n270\n00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.290\nusers because they are maintaining\nthe service going forward.\n\n271\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.770\nThey're translating the customer and\nuser requirements.\n\n272\n00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.631\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So they're bringing in a translation\n\n273\n00:15:51.631 --> 00:15:56.956\nskill that otherwise is not normally\nfound in a product development team and\n\n274\n00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.297\nin a project team.\n\n275\n00:15:58.297 --> 00:16:01.771\nUltimately, with the traditional\nwaterfall approach.\n\n276\n00:16:01.771 --> 00:16:06.424\nAnd you can consider that at the end of\na project, we hand over to operations.\n\n277\n00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:11.526\nBut in an Agile environment, we are\ncontinually handing over to operations,\n\n278\n00:16:11.526 --> 00:16:16.420\nevery sort of four weeks, or\nmaybe even more frequently than that.\n\n279\n00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.310\nSo it's important that our operations\nguys are involved in that team,\n\n280\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.420\nbecause they've gotta take ownership.\n\n281\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.740\nAnd so their skills as to how\nto transition to operation\n\n282\n00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.770\nare going to be incredibly important.\n\n283\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.390\nSo while their skills don't\nnecessarily lie in programming, and\n\n284\n00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.780\nI don't expect them to be doing bug fixes,\n\n285\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:41.470\ntheir skills will lie in requirements\ndefinition and also acceptance as well.\n\n286\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:46.430\nSo defining acceptance criteria, and\npotentially also signing off on that\n\n287\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.530\nacceptance criteria, too, they'll\ndefinitely have an influence in that.\n\n288\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n289\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.130\n&gt;&gt; So all of this people\nshould be part of our team.\n\n290\n00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.224\nSo what kind of decisions\ndo our teams need to make?\n\n291\n00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:05.665\nWell, our teams have got to decide,\ncollectively as a project team we've got\n\n292\n00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:08.325\nto decide on what methods\nwe're going to use.\n\n293\n00:17:08.325 --> 00:17:10.895\nWhat standards we're going to adhere to.\n\n294\n00:17:10.895 --> 00:17:17.225\nAnd what norms we're going to\naccept within our team environment.\n\n295\n00:17:17.225 --> 00:17:22.025\nSo in terms of methods, well,\nit's do we use extreme programming?\n\n296\n00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:24.090\nWe looked at that in a previous episode.\n\n297\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:28.320\nDo we use Lean or\ndo we use Scrum, for instance?\n\n298\n00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.190\nSo they're going to decide\nwhich particular Agile\n\n299\n00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.220\npractice we're going to use.\n\n300\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.096\nIs it okay to mix and match?\n\n301\n00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.121\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n302\n00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:36.621\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, it is.\n\n303\n00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:39.810\nYeah, you're right.\n\n304\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.120\nBut this is why we make these\ndecisions up front as to\n\n305\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.180\nhow we're going to manage the project,\nokay?\n\n306\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.020\nSo what methods are we going to use or\n\n307\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.170\nwhich pieces from individual\nmethods are we're going to use?\n\n308\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.410\nIn another episode,\n\n309\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:58.730\nI looked at the fact that Agile is\napplicable not just to projects.\n\n310\n00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:03.990\nIt's not just about delivering\na particular piece of code or\n\n311\n00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.310\ndelivering particular functionality.\n\n312\n00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.280\nWe can use certain agile principles\nabsolutely everywhere, and\n\n313\n00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.860\nwe do, part of our business as usual here.\n\n314\n00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.570\nWe'll have a stand-up meeting every day,\nthat's an Agile principle that we've\n\n315\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.620\ndecided to use on\na business as usual basis.\n\n316\n00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.120\nAnd it's exactly the same when\nwe're managing a project.\n\n317\n00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.000\nWe've gotta decide which principles we're\ngoing to use and when and where and\n\n318\n00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.450\nhow we're going to use those principles.\n\n319\n00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.180\nSo you might bring in\nsome can bang boards, for\n\n320\n00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.500\ninstance, to monitor progress visually.\n\n321\n00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.450\nYou might have boards for user progress.\n\n322\n00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.590\nBut then you might bring in the role of\na Scrum Master which is something that\n\n323\n00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.120\nappears in Scrum.\n\n324\n00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.208\nYou'll going to employ Lean principles,\nwhich talks about efficiency as well.\n\n325\n00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:53.760\nSo we wanna have efficient processes, we\nwant to have some defined processes, but\n\n326\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.560\nthey've got to be efficient.\n\n327\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.362\nYou might think about,\nmaybe as it mentions there,\n\n328\n00:18:58.362 --> 00:19:03.186\npair programming which we find\nin extreme programming in XP.\n\n329\n00:19:03.186 --> 00:19:06.790\nYou decide, it's part of the project.\n\n330\n00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:12.999\nYou'll decide collectively as a team,\nwhat methodologies you're going to use and\n\n331\n00:19:12.999 --> 00:19:17.730\nwhat elements of what methodologies\nthat you're going to use.\n\n332\n00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:21.422\nAnd where you're going to\nuse those methodologies and\n\n333\n00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:24.640\nthose particular tools, for instance.\n\n334\n00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.010\nAnd you decide that\ncollectively as a team.\n\n335\n00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.650\nAnd you know why we do that?\n\n336\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.300\n&gt;&gt; To create the value.\n\n337\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.130\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Because we devalue people.\n\n338\n00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, cuz we value people,\nbut we want everybody empowered.\n\n339\n00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.220\nEverybody's got to adhere\nto the same standards,\n\n340\n00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.790\nwhatever those methodologies\nare that we want to implement.\n\n341\n00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.250\nAnd whatever elements of those\nmethodologies we wanna implement,\n\n342\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.790\nwe want everybody on board with that.\n\n343\n00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n344\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe want everybody to be brought into it.\n\n345\n00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.210\nAnd so we want everybody to agree\nthat this is the way we're going to\n\n346\n00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.870\nmanage things.\n\n347\n00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.950\nIf we don't do that, if we don't bring\npeople in, and they don't feel empowered,\n\n348\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.900\nor they don't feel as though\nthey've got any influence,\n\n349\n00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.270\nthen they're gonna be that\nsource of resistance.\n\n350\n00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.710\nThey're gonna be the negative person\nthat maybe isn't giving 100% on\n\n351\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.440\nany particular project.\n\n352\n00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.996\nAnd when it comes to Agile, we really,\nreally can't have somebody that's not\n\n353\n00:20:16.996 --> 00:20:21.824\ngiving 100%, because that builds up\nteam resentment, but most importantly,\n\n354\n00:20:21.824 --> 00:20:25.847\nthen that results in delays in our\niterations and we can't have that.\n\n355\n00:20:25.847 --> 00:20:32.312\nAnd so team members have got to decide\nwhat they're going to be in charge of,\n\n356\n00:20:32.312 --> 00:20:36.870\nwhat's their specific role\nwithin that iteration?\n\n357\n00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.811\nSo which procedures we're gonna implement,\n\n358\n00:20:38.811 --> 00:20:40.910\nwhich procedures we're\nnot going to implement.\n\n359\n00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:46.590\nAnd remember Lean principles,\nwe only use what we're going to use.\n\n360\n00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:50.480\nSo if you don't bring in\na complete set of processes to\n\n361\n00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.140\ncover absolutely everything and\nuse only three of them.\n\n362\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.756\nWe bring in three processes\nif we're only gonna use that.\n\n363\n00:20:54.756 --> 00:20:56.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n364\n00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.290\n&gt;&gt; So team members have also gotta decide\nwhat standards they want to adhere to.\n\n365\n00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.300\nAnd that includes coding standards,\n\n366\n00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.600\nit includes standards for\nuser design, for instance.\n\n367\n00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.940\nIt includes standards for documentation\nand templates for documentation,\n\n368\n00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.419\nremember Lean principals and deficiency.\n\n369\n00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:16.980\nWe wanna have templates for our documents.\n\n370\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.890\nYou do not want to reinvent the wheel.\n\n371\n00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:24.720\nWe do not start with a blank piece of\npaper every time we design a new document.\n\n372\n00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.390\nWe should already have\nin place standards for\n\n373\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.870\ndocumentation like\nservice level agreements.\n\n374\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.226\nAre you kicking the bucket over there,\nCherokee, is there some?\n\n375\n00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:35.146\n&gt;&gt; Kicking the bucket?\n\n376\n00:21:35.146 --> 00:21:37.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I guess we know about that.\n\n377\n00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.340\n&gt;&gt; I did kick the bucket.\n\n378\n00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n379\n00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.030\nJust don't do it here,\nall right, not right now.\n\n380\n00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.670\nLet me finish first.\n\n381\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.196\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n382\n00:21:46.196 --> 00:21:51.852\n&gt;&gt; So when we talk about\nservice level agreements and\n\n383\n00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:57.350\nhaving templates for our documentation.\n\n384\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.040\nAnd I use service level\nagreements as just an example.\n\n385\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.714\nSo when we deploy any new software,\n\n386\n00:22:02.714 --> 00:22:08.419\nwe've got to have targets that we have\nagreed that we can deliver a service or\n\n387\n00:22:08.419 --> 00:22:14.412\na piece of functionality within those\ntargets, maybe availability targets.\n\n388\n00:22:14.412 --> 00:22:18.623\nWe're going to make this particular\nfunctionality available to\n\n389\n00:22:18.623 --> 00:22:22.690\nyou between 8 AM and 20:00 or\n8:00 PM in the evening.\n\n390\n00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.790\nThere are availability targets.\n\n391\n00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.650\nNow, every time we come up\nwith an availability target,\n\n392\n00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.380\ndo we want to actually start from scratch?\n\n393\n00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.560\nAnd then write a whole new document and\nthen get a customer to sign that, yeah,\n\n394\n00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.060\nthis is what they accept?\n\n395\n00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Or just note those delta changes.\n\n396\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.620\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, that's exactly what we do.\n\n397\n00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.280\nSo again,\nLean principles think about efficiency.\n\n398\n00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.180\nAnd you can call them standards.\n\n399\n00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.350\nDon't also forget\nthe international standards.\n\n400\n00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.640\nAnd quite often when you see\nthe word standard you think, maybe-\n\n401\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Your minds may drift that way.\n\n402\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:58.816\n&gt;&gt; Right, ISO 27002 which is the\ninternational standard for IT security or\n\n403\n00:22:58.816 --> 00:23:04.200\nISO 20000, the international standard for\nIT service management.\n\n404\n00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.491\nIf your company,\nif your organization has accreditation and\n\n405\n00:23:08.491 --> 00:23:13.192\nhas achieved any international standard or\nit may be ISO 9000,\n\n406\n00:23:13.192 --> 00:23:16.739\nif you have achieved any\ninternational standard,\n\n407\n00:23:16.739 --> 00:23:22.310\nthen that's really important that\nwe know about this in development.\n\n408\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.000\nBecause we've got to develop\nwithin that standard.\n\n409\n00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.140\nBecause the minute we develop\nany piece of functionality, and\n\n410\n00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:34.080\nthe management of that functionality\ndoes not fall within the norms\n\n411\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.040\nof that standard, then the company\ncan lose their accreditation.\n\n412\n00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.500\nAnd what it could mean,\nbest case scenario,\n\n413\n00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.680\nit could mean that we need to go back and\nstart to do some reprogramming.\n\n414\n00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.160\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was gonna say, and\n\n415\n00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.260\nit probably isn't gonna be that\nthe company will lose their creditation.\n\n416\n00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.258\nIt's probably gonna be Jo and\nCherokee have to go back and\n\n417\n00:23:53.258 --> 00:23:56.267\nre-shoot this episode or\ngo back and rework something.\n\n418\n00:23:56.267 --> 00:23:58.284\n&gt;&gt; Right, it really depends.\n\n419\n00:23:58.284 --> 00:24:00.288\nBecause quite often you see,\n\n420\n00:24:00.288 --> 00:24:04.709\nand this is why we think about this\nright now As the team decision.\n\n421\n00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:09.513\nYou see, if right now we're not aware\nthat let's say that we've got ISO 27002\n\n422\n00:24:09.513 --> 00:24:12.850\ninternational standard for\nIT security management.\n\n423\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.790\nWe're not aware of this so\nwe just carry on and\n\n424\n00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:21.710\nwe're coding something and\nin four weeks time we release it.\n\n425\n00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.250\nThen what's going to happen is that\nwe're gonna release something else\n\n426\n00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.100\nfour weeks later and we're gonna release\nsomething else four weeks later.\n\n427\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.710\nWe're not gonna get another\ninterim audit for another year.\n\n428\n00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.850\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask that.\n\n429\n00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:36.020\nWhat about audits that we're not\naware of or if it creeps up on us?\n\n430\n00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.580\nSo someone has to proactively\nbe paying attention.\n\n431\n00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n432\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.223\nAnd then you said, well, we'll go back and\nchange it but a year's elapsed.\n\n433\n00:24:43.223 --> 00:24:45.761\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why would you go back and\nwork on old computers?\n\n434\n00:24:45.761 --> 00:24:46.414\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n435\n00:24:46.414 --> 00:24:51.872\nSo if we've put something in place that\nmaybe it's in an operating system,\n\n436\n00:24:51.872 --> 00:24:56.240\nthat means that we no longer\nachieve a particular standard.\n\n437\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.985\nAnd then in another year's time or\njust maybe nine months later, the auditor\n\n438\n00:25:00.985 --> 00:25:06.050\ncomes in and does an interim audit and\nthey say, you've gotta rectify this.\n\n439\n00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.610\nIf that is so embedded, that piece of code\nis so embedded into your operating system\n\n440\n00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:15.330\nnow that you can not change it,\nyou're gonna lose your accreditation.\n\n441\n00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:19.950\nAnd it could be that serious which is why\nI say even best case scenario is that we\n\n442\n00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.050\njust go back and change it.\n\n443\n00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.400\nBut what if you can't?\n\n444\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.620\nBecause you have built in potentially 9,\n\n445\n00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.020\n10, 12, 14, however many\niterations on top of that code.\n\n446\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.900\nYou might not be able to, okay?\n\n447\n00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.998\nSo do think about standards as\nin international standards,\n\n448\n00:25:37.998 --> 00:25:40.327\nnot just as in ethical standards or\n\n449\n00:25:40.327 --> 00:25:45.329\nstandards to the way you're going to\ndo things like document templates.\n\n450\n00:25:45.329 --> 00:25:51.000\nAnd the other thing that I like, and I\nlove this bit, under the section of norms.\n\n451\n00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:59.327\nTeam members must agree on expectations\nregarding behaviors and quality.\n\n452\n00:25:59.327 --> 00:26:01.658\nNow where do we get started on that one?\n\n453\n00:26:01.658 --> 00:26:05.194\n&gt;&gt; Okay, listen,\nI'm going to take the safe route here and\n\n454\n00:26:05.194 --> 00:26:08.520\nI'm gonna go with baseline,\nbaseline, baseline.\n\n455\n00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.890\nFinal answer.\n\n456\n00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:10.730\n&gt;&gt; Based on what?\n\n457\n00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:11.880\nI didn't ask a question.\n\n458\n00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.750\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n459\n00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.065\n&gt;&gt; Whatever question comes up.\n\n460\n00:26:14.065 --> 00:26:16.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm non-judgemental but in order\n\n461\n00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.850\nto determine an abnormality, I have to\nhave something to compare it to, right?\n\n462\n00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, but\nwe're talking about behaviors.\n\n463\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.112\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to be diplomatic for\nour show.\n\n464\n00:26:27.112 --> 00:26:29.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Who's to say what's normal?\n\n465\n00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.630\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, don't they have\npsych tests that we can issue?\n\n466\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.131\nAnd I think we'd all be in\ntrouble if that were the case Jo.\n\n467\n00:26:36.131 --> 00:26:39.353\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's trying to accuse everybody, yeah,\n\n468\n00:26:39.353 --> 00:26:42.420\nokay, of needing certain,\nI don't know, help.\n\n469\n00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.420\nOur behaviors in the way\nthat we're actually working,\n\n470\n00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.400\nthe way that we're interacting, and\nthe way that we're collaborating,\n\n471\n00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.470\nit has got a big influence\non team collaboration.\n\n472\n00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.345\nBut the other things that have other\na huge influence on team efficiency and\n\n473\n00:27:01.345 --> 00:27:05.315\neffectiveness are the silly little\nthings that we don't notice and\n\n474\n00:27:05.315 --> 00:27:09.840\nit's the silly little things that some\npeople can pay no attention to and just\n\n475\n00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.674\nignore it completely, and other people,\nactually, it means a big deal to them.\n\n476\n00:27:14.674 --> 00:27:15.715\n&gt;&gt; Dwell on it?\n\n477\n00:27:15.715 --> 00:27:16.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay?\n\n478\n00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:23.320\nWhat about that one person that regulary\ncomes in late every single day?\n\n479\n00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:30.960\nAnd nobody really notices, nobody really\ncares apart from the one person who's\n\n480\n00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.290\nreally not happy and the longer it goes\non for them, more discontent they become.\n\n481\n00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:41.010\nAnd therefore, the more ineffective\nthey become because their morale drops.\n\n482\n00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.910\nSo we have to agree on certain behaviors.\n\n483\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.130\nWe have to agree on the way that\nwe're going to approach things.\n\n484\n00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:52.780\nWe have to agree on,\nwe talked about collaboration but\n\n485\n00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:57.660\nwhen I mention that word, I mean being\nobjective and having people that may be,\n\n486\n00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.590\nyou mentioned in the previous\nepisode about being thick-skinned.\n\n487\n00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.570\nI'm not saying that everybody needs to\nbe thick-skinned but we've all gotta be\n\n488\n00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:09.980\nobjective in our approach and realize that\nif somebody's holding their hand up and\n\n489\n00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.660\nsaying hey, I can do that for you and\nI can do it quicker than you,\n\n490\n00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.000\nthat's not actually any\nslur on your skill set.\n\n491\n00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's just that we've recognized that\n\n492\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.330\nthere are efficiencies to be had.\n\n493\n00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.735\nSo we have to be able to\nidentify team behaviors.\n\n494\n00:28:26.735 --> 00:28:29.050\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n495\n00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.110\nThat also includes team rituals as well.\n\n496\n00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.920\nThe certain things that we will do like,\nfor instance, we all agree to be in here\n\n497\n00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.670\nat a certain time every morning so\nthat we can attend a standoff meeting.\n\n498\n00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:42.760\nThat's a team ritual but\nthere can also be other fun rituals and\n\n499\n00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.410\nwe've talked about play and rock, paper,\n\n500\n00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:49.240\nscissors in order to determine\nthe priority of stories and activities.\n\n501\n00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.710\nThat's a team ritual.\n\n502\n00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.560\nAnd if it's getting the job done and\n\n503\n00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:58.310\nit's getting the job done efficiently and\nit's effective, then why not?\n\n504\n00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.600\nAlso what I want to mention and\n\n505\n00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.690\nwe're gonna look at this on\nthe next slide is just doneness.\n\n506\n00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:09.540\nWhen do we consider\nthe project to be done?\n\n507\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.290\nWhen do we consider it to be finite?\n\n508\n00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.360\n&gt;&gt; I feel like this is\nanother trick question but\n\n509\n00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.610\nI would say, at the end of that\nstory that was agreed upon.\n\n510\n00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.418\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and it is.\n\n511\n00:29:23.418 --> 00:29:24.810\nWe've all gotta agree and\n\n512\n00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:29.310\nthat's the thing with the concept of done\nand we'll see that in our next slide.\n\n513\n00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:35.720\nWe've all gotta agree on what consists\nof done, you have a question.\n\n514\n00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.550\n&gt;&gt; It's not a question but\nI was just gonna add to that.\n\n515\n00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:42.953\nSo I don't know if you heard this\nmorning Jo, in our stand up meeting,\n\n516\n00:29:42.953 --> 00:29:47.358\nsome of our developers talking about\nthey were gonna be partaking, or\n\n517\n00:29:47.358 --> 00:29:50.000\nparticipating in a ceremony today.\n\n518\n00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.990\nSo that is kind of where they decide,\nhey, did everyone meet their goals within\n\n519\n00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.550\nthis particular story, are we accepting\nit, can we move on during a ceremony.\n\n520\n00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.550\nSo that's just their terminology but\nI don't know,\n\n521\n00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.260\nother people may call\nit something different.\n\n522\n00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.940\n&gt;&gt; I thought somebody was getting married\nand we weren't invited, that was all.\n\n523\n00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.660\nI just thought maybe we'd been excluded.\n\n524\n00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.660\n&gt;&gt; No, no,\nRob's had to explain that before.\n\n525\n00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.587\nBecause it's not a common term\nthat everyone even within our\n\n526\n00:30:18.587 --> 00:30:19.980\norganization uses.\n\n527\n00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.185\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; So just understanding what that means.\n\n528\n00:30:22.185 --> 00:30:29.060\n&gt;&gt; So how efficient do you think that\nis if we don't all know about this?\n\n529\n00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.564\n&gt;&gt; Not very efficient but\nthat's why we're moaning.\n\n530\n00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:33.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now we're moaning.\n\n531\n00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:34.660\nBut yeah.\n\n532\n00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.500\n&gt;&gt; That's why talk about it at stand up.\n\n533\n00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.730\nBut you weren't there for that stand up.\n\n534\n00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.880\n&gt;&gt; No, I wasn't there for\nthat particular stand up.\n\n535\n00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.066\nBut it's not efficient,\nit really isn't efficient,\n\n536\n00:30:45.066 --> 00:30:48.930\nif we've gotta explain something,\nthen it's not efficient.\n\n537\n00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.550\nHowever, what we've gotta do is make\nsure that when we form the team,\n\n538\n00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:56.760\nthat everybody is aware of\nwhat the norms would be.\n\n539\n00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.620\nBut they're gonna develop over time,\nthey're going to change over time.\n\n540\n00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.060\nNothing remains static and,\nmore importantly,\n\n541\n00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.650\nnothing should remain static\nin an agile environment.\n\n542\n00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.700\nWe should be changing,\nwe should be improving.\n\n543\n00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.630\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n544\n00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:16.530\n&gt;&gt; And so that concept of done is just the\nteam's definition of what we've achieved.\n\n545\n00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:20.000\nThis is what we will consider to be done.\n\n546\n00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.370\nThis is when we signed that off and we'll\nagree that before we actually do the work\n\n547\n00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.930\nthat this is what we consider to be done\nand it could mean absolutely anything.\n\n548\n00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.150\nIt could mean that the tests\nare being written and\n\n549\n00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:34.150\nwe've tested everything and\nit's come back without any errors.\n\n550\n00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.540\nOr it could be that the product\nowners approved it or\n\n551\n00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:41.005\nit could be that the customer has signed\noff on that particular iteration,\n\n552\n00:31:41.005 --> 00:31:45.148\non that particular piece of code,\nthere's no right or wrong with this.\n\n553\n00:31:45.148 --> 00:31:50.000\nIt is completely subjective\nto the iteration but\n\n554\n00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.770\nnevertheless it has to\nbe an objective measure.\n\n555\n00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.900\nBut all of that forms part of\nthe building, this agile team.\n\n556\n00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.290\nBecause what we want to do is\nbuild a team that gets along,\n\n557\n00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:09.430\nthat collaborates with each other,\nthat allows us to define our norms and\n\n558\n00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.760\nour methods, and our way of working.\n\n559\n00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:17.685\nAnd these norms and methods and way of\nworking, and even how we define done,\n\n560\n00:32:17.685 --> 00:32:22.556\nit's all gotta be something that we can\nall work with as part of the agile team.\n\n561\n00:32:22.556 --> 00:32:28.500\nAnd so when we're building that team, the\nscrum master or the project manager, well,\n\n562\n00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:34.740\nthey have to be very, very picky, I wanna\nsay, about who we bring into the team.\n\n563\n00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.860\nBecause we have to have people\nthat are able to work together.\n\n564\n00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:38.870\n&gt;&gt; That's very important,\n\n565\n00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:43.080\nI think, just making sure you do have\nthose right pieces to our puzzle.\n\n566\n00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.550\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nyou've gotta get the right jigsaw, right?\n\n567\n00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:46.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what are you?\n\n568\n00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.020\nWould you say you're like a corner piece,\n\n569\n00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.590\nyou're there to like be\na foundation element?\n\n570\n00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.899\n&gt;&gt; I'm the biggest guy in the middle and\nnobody can figure it out.\n\n571\n00:32:55.899 --> 00:32:56.673\nThat's what I am.\n\n572\n00:32:56.673 --> 00:33:00.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, we appreciate that\nlittle bit of obscurity there for\n\n573\n00:33:00.942 --> 00:33:04.046\nus today, Jo, and\nwe appreciate you as well but\n\n574\n00:33:04.046 --> 00:33:08.020\nwe still have additional ad job\ncomponents headed your way.\n\n575\n00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.220\nDon't miss that on the next show,\nfor now, let's sign out.\n\n576\n00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.950\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boobs.\n\n577\n00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:13.950\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.941\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\n\n4\n00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:14.880\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.340\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.550\nIn this episode, we're gonna gather\nround and share some stories together.\n\n7\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.820\nSpecifically user stories, and of course\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock in studio\n\n8\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.000\nto help define what a user story is.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n9\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.180\nit doesn't start off with once upon a\ntime, and no one lives happily ever after.\n\n10\n00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.050\n&gt;&gt; In a far,\n\n11\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.113\nfar away land?\n&gt;&gt; No, no, you're thinking Shrek.\n\n12\n00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:42.766\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.797\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Completely different.\n\n14\n00:00:44.797 --> 00:00:45.525\n&gt;&gt; Great movie.\n\n15\n00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:47.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, doesn't end up\n\n16\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.470\nwith happily ever after as well.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.960\n&gt;&gt; Although it should end up with happy\n\n18\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.160\npeople.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n19\n00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we should end up with\n\n20\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.100\nhappy users.\n\n21\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.150\nThat's the goal, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's what a user story should be,\n\n22\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.060\nright.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what the goal is,\n\n23\n00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.060\nis to deliver something of value\nto the user, in other words,\n\n24\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.810\ncustomer satisfaction,\nthat should be our goal.\n\n25\n00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.140\nBut no, what a user story\nis is really it's a way of\n\n26\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.740\ncapturing user requirements\nin any project.\n\n27\n00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.872\nIt is specifically in an Agile project.\n\n28\n00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:20.710\nSo we will use user stories and\nScram and will use user stories and\n\n29\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.590\nall of our other Agile\nmethodologies as well.\n\n30\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.344\nWhen it just really is a way of\ncapturing their requirements.\n\n31\n00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:29.950\nSo we write it down in a story.\n\n32\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.930\nAnd that allows us to\ncapture those requirements.\n\n33\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.850\nAnd actually, to organize and\nthen prioritize those requirements.\n\n34\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.800\nAnd actually, in another episode,\nwe will be looking at a- well,\n\n35\n00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.170\nwe'll be looking at prioritization\nof our user stories.\n\n36\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.890\nThat'll probably be in, sort of,\npart three of looking at user stories.\n\n37\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.370\n&gt;&gt; You'll have to give me a heads up so\n\n38\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.860\nwe can actually have Rob come in here and\ndo the full on demonstration then for\n\n39\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.460\nthat prioritization process.\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna help with rock, paper,\n\n40\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.241\nscissors, is he?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he'll have to guide us.\n\n41\n00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:01.436\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so\n\n42\n00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:04.484\nthat's something to look forward to or\nbe very frightened of.\n\n43\n00:02:04.484 --> 00:02:05.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.705\n&gt;&gt; It could well be more like a grim story\n\n45\n00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:09.161\n[LAUGH] than anything else, yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.870\nBut a user story, really what that should\ndo is, that should take the problem\n\n47\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.780\nthat we have and then demonstrate and\ndescribe how to articulate, for\n\n48\n00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.840\nlack of a better word, how the user\nis going to use that solution.\n\n49\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.870\nThat's what the user's story should do.\n\n50\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.000\nSo how the user's going to perceive,\nthat's the word we use when we talk about\n\n51\n00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.990\nvalue, perceive value in that particular\nadditional functionality, etc.\n\n52\n00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.310\nSo the user's story, you might want to\ncall them stakeholder requirements,\n\n53\n00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.820\nbut not in an agile project.\n\n54\n00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.150\nThe user's story should be detailed\nenough to understand the user needs,\n\n55\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.960\nhowever they shouldn't be so\ndetailed that it restricts programming.\n\n56\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.820\nSometimes what happens when we're\ndefining user stories is that we get so\n\n57\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.220\ndetailed and we get so caught up\nin the actual detail of the story,\n\n58\n00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.320\nwe then actually pretty much do the design\nof the solution at the same time.\n\n59\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.770\nAnd that's not what we should be doing.\n\n60\n00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.570\nA User Story should really\ndescribe the endpoint.\n\n61\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.060\nWhat the resulting\nfunctionality should look like.\n\n62\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.280\nNot how it should be programmed or\nhow it should work but\n\n63\n00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.360\njust what it should look like.\n\n64\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.490\nSo it allows us to estimate the size\nof the story, it allows us to estimate\n\n65\n00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.650\nhow many days programming should be\nneeded to be able to deliver that story.\n\n66\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.450\nWhat Cherokee was going on\nabout just a little while ago,\n\n67\n00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.580\nin case you didn't hear any\nof our previous episodes,\n\n68\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.860\nwas we've got somebody in our office- Rob-\nwho will use Rock, Paper, Scissors or\n\n69\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.460\na derivative of Rock, Paper, Scissors\nto actually prioritize user's stories.\n\n70\n00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.890\nYou see, for every single project,\nand therefore for\n\n71\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.310\nevery iteration, we're going to\nhave a collection of user stories.\n\n72\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.550\nWe're not just going to have just one.\n\n73\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.300\nAnd we're not just going to deliver\none piece of functionality.\n\n74\n00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.800\nWe're going to deliver two, three,\nmaybe four pieces of functionality.\n\n75\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.270\nAnd maybe it's a case of where\nI've coming a bug for instance or\n\n76\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.990\nit's an additional feature but\nwe have to prioritize those stories and\n\n77\n00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.540\ncollectively across the entire project\nwe have to prioritize those stories.\n\n78\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.680\nAnd once we've done that,\nthat's how we decide then which stories\n\n79\n00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.780\nfit into which iteration\ndepending on the priority.\n\n80\n00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.500\nSo it all makes sense really.\n\n81\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:50.240\nA product owner has the role of not\nonly defining the user stories,\n\n82\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.650\nor at least being able to articulate and\nexplain the user stories, but\n\n83\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.640\nthe product owner has the role of\nowning the functionality that is that's\n\n84\n00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.557\nwhat they call the product owner that\nis required within those user stories.\n\n85\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.480\nSo the product owner takes ownership for\nthe deliverable.\n\n86\n00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.650\nThat's what's gonna come out of the\nprogramming that is needed to deliver that\n\n87\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.760\nuse a story.\n\n88\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.330\nSo what should be in a user story then?\n\n89\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.950\nWell pretty obvious, yeah, the user\ninterface, what it's going to look like.\n\n90\n00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.320\nAny services that we need, including\nthird-party or web services, etc.\n\n91\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.500\nAnd also any data services that we need.\n\n92\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.330\nBecause we might store our data\nin a different database, so\n\n93\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.849\nthe actual tool with which we're using it.\n\n94\n00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.033\nSo all of that should be part of our\nconsideration when it comes to our user\n\n95\n00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:48.080\nstory, however It should be\npart of the consideration.\n\n96\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.030\nJust go back a slide, and you'll see, and\nI've already mentioned that if we go back\n\n97\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.720\na slide, you'll see that it shouldn't\nhave enough detail to build the solution.\n\n98\n00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.460\nThe user story simply\ndetails what the user want's,\n\n99\n00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.155\nit doesn't detail how it should be used.\n\n100\n00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:12.072\nSo here's an example of a user story and\nthe user story should say something\n\n101\n00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:17.375\nalong the line's of as a user and\nwhatever particular type of user you are,\n\n102\n00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:21.020\nthis is what I need and\nI need it to be able to do this.\n\n103\n00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.440\nSo here's an example.\n\n104\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.840\nAs a retail customer,\nI need to be able to order and\n\n105\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.830\nbuy food from wherever I am so\nthat I can have food delivered to my\n\n106\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.110\nhome without having to drive to the shop.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds amazing.\n\n107\n00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.210\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a reality depending on\n\n108\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.230\nwhere you're living in the world.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n109\n00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.520\nAnd in some places it's only\nwithin like a two hour or\n\n110\n00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.470\nmaybe even a one hour window.\n&gt;&gt; We select a one hour window\n\n111\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.180\nback in the UK.\n\n112\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.070\nDepending on which one you wanna yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Gainesville, Florida has not yet\n\n113\n00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.290\nmet that particular map yet.\n&gt;&gt; You need to\n\n114\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.541\nmove to London.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n115\n00:06:58.541 --> 00:06:59.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n116\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.460\nthen to be fair up in Washington DC,\nyou can specify one or\n\n117\n00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.390\ntwo delivery-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n118\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.110\n&gt;&gt; With your Amazon.\n\n119\n00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n120\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, yeah.\n\n121\n00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.920\nYeah where I live in South Carolina\nwe haven't quite gotten to that.\n\n122\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.152\n&gt;&gt; Washington State,\n\n123\n00:07:10.152 --> 00:07:13.629\nSeattle that's where those\nbig companies are that offer\n\n124\n00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:16.222\na lot of those services.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:07:16.222 --> 00:07:17.173\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n126\n00:07:17.173 --> 00:07:17.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n127\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.380\nhere we've got our user story that,\n\n128\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.160\nreally just articulates\nthe value that the user sees.\n\n129\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.690\nAnd you can see in that that it says I\nwanna be able to order and buy food.\n\n130\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.150\nAnd here is my value statement so I can\nhave food delivered to my home without\n\n131\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.390\nhaving to go to the store or to the shop.\n\n132\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.210\nThat's my value statement.\n\n133\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:43.740\nBut my need is the functionality\nthat the developer has to include.\n\n134\n00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.517\nSo when it comes to, and we'll talk about\nprioritization in another episode, but\n\n135\n00:07:49.517 --> 00:07:53.447\nwhen it comes to priorities,\nwhat do you think we base the priority on?\n\n136\n00:07:53.447 --> 00:07:57.781\nDo we base it on the need or\ndo we base it on what it\n\n137\n00:07:57.781 --> 00:08:02.389\nactually allows them to do, the value?\n&gt;&gt; Perceived\n\n138\n00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:03.406\nvalue.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n139\n00:08:03.406 --> 00:08:06.486\nbecause we're actually delivering\nvalues to the customer, and\n\n140\n00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.060\nit's what the customer values.\n\n141\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.060\nThe customer doesn't necessarily value\na particular piece of functionality,\n\n142\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.130\nwhat the customer values is\nwhat it enables them to do.\n\n143\n00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.610\nIn other words,\nit enables them to have food delivered\n\n144\n00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.490\nhome without having to go to the shop.\n&gt;&gt; To\n\n145\n00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.177\nthe store, yeah.\n\n146\n00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:22.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n147\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.170\n&gt;&gt; And, interestingly enough, and\n\n148\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.290\nthis why we talk about\niterative development.\n\n149\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.780\nInterestingly enough, when you first\ndeploy a brand new service, and\n\n150\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.900\nlet's say we were deploying\na brand new service like this.\n\n151\n00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.940\nWhen we first deploy that service,\n\n152\n00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.810\nyou could make that user interface\nlook however you wanted it to look.\n\n153\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.630\nAnd the customer will perceive value\nin that, because it allows them to\n\n154\n00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.930\ndo something that they haven't\nbeen able to do previously.\n\n155\n00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:53.520\nHowever, they're only going to tolerate\na cumbersome user interface, or\n\n156\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.140\na cumbersome sort of functionality, or\nmaybe slow performance for so long.\n\n157\n00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:04.390\nBecause you see once you have implemented\nsomething that is a nice to have,\n\n158\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:10.670\na value driven feature, something new,\nvery, very quickly it becomes the norm.\n\n159\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.420\nIt becomes accepted,\nit becomes business as usual, and\n\n160\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.620\nvalue perception diminishes over time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if they say, okay,\n\n161\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.990\nI'm expecting to have my food delivered,\nthat's great.\n\n162\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.850\nI'm getting accustomed to it, but\n\n163\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.030\nthen my apples start showing\nup bruised every single time.\n\n164\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.870\nOr my avocados are extremely ripe,\nor something like that,\n\n165\n00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.410\nyou never know.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n166\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.850\nyou know what bugs me?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.447\n&gt;&gt; And I could tell you now,\n\n168\n00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:41.011\nI have used this in the UK before, and\nwhen it comes to the online grocery\n\n169\n00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:42.202\nshopping,\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh,\n\n170\n00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.983\nit's where they deliver toilet paper,\nit's a different color to that\n\n171\n00:09:44.983 --> 00:09:46.020\nthat I asked for.\n\n172\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.301\n&gt;&gt; Color?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n173\n00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:49.124\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n174\n00:09:49.124 --> 00:09:50.217\n&gt;&gt; I mean, come on.\n\n175\n00:09:50.217 --> 00:09:51.144\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n176\n00:09:51.144 --> 00:09:55.591\nJo you got a color.\n&gt;&gt; We have color toilet paper in the UK.\n\n177\n00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:57.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\n\n178\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.638\nI've never actually done that service and\nthat's something that I'm worried about-\n\n179\n00:10:00.638 --> 00:10:01.850\n&gt;&gt; The basin is yellow, and\n\n180\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.871\nthey deliver pink toilet paper, I mean,\n\n181\n00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:09.396\nwhat am I gonna do with that?\n&gt;&gt; Chemicals, you're\n\n182\n00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:12.150\nnot worried about [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's move on.\n\n183\n00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n184\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.293\nmoving on.\n&gt;&gt; So part of defining there, and\n\n185\n00:10:16.293 --> 00:10:20.522\nonce we've defined that user story,\nwhat we have to then define,\n\n186\n00:10:20.522 --> 00:10:24.840\nis what the acceptance criteria is for\nthat particular user story.\n\n187\n00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.126\nSo in that user story that\nI gave you as an example,\n\n188\n00:10:28.126 --> 00:10:32.199\nthe user story was about online\nat home delivery of her grocery\n\n189\n00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:35.720\nshopping with the right\ncolor toilet paper.\n\n190\n00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.420\nI saw Alex except his criteria is defined,\nat that point in time with the story.\n\n191\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.640\nSo we, think about what the customer wants\nto achieve, and what the customer wants\n\n192\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.700\nto achieve is, well,\nwe want to have our groceries delivered.\n\n193\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.780\nBut then as I've said,\nover time that scope creep,\n\n194\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:00.645\nas Cherokee likes to call it,\nthat scope creep might come into it.\n\n195\n00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:04.034\nBut that's not a scope creep,\nit's an enhancement, all right,\n\n196\n00:11:04.034 --> 00:11:05.855\nit's another iteration.\n\n197\n00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:09.285\nAnd we might change because we might\nchange our requirements based on\n\n198\n00:11:09.285 --> 00:11:11.068\nthe deliverables that we receive.\n\n199\n00:11:11.068 --> 00:11:14.796\nAnd if I receive my toilet paper,\ntwo of them in the wrong color then,\n\n200\n00:11:14.796 --> 00:11:17.645\nwe can have to make some improvements.\n\n201\n00:11:17.645 --> 00:11:22.390\nBut the acceptance criteria is what\nthe customers is willing to sign off on.\n\n202\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:27.180\nAnd it describes what's included that\nhas to be delivered in order for\n\n203\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.840\nthe users to accept that.\n\n204\n00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.650\nAnd so, we should capture the both\nthe user's story on the card, and also\n\n205\n00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.900\non the back of that card, which should\ncapture the acceptance criteria as well.\n\n206\n00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.050\nAnd it's the acceptance\ncriteria that we test for.\n\n207\n00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.067\nIt includes the must haves,\nand nice to haves, as well.\n\n208\n00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:54.649\nHave you every heard of Moscow?\n&gt;&gt; Like, a Moscow mule?\n\n209\n00:11:56.706 --> 00:12:00.182\n[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Always alcohol,\n\n210\n00:12:00.182 --> 00:12:03.210\nwhy?\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I feel like I really,\n\n211\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:08.990\nreally have, it's some kind of project\nmanagement tool aside from the city.\n\n212\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:14.640\nI can't dust enough cobwebs off right\nnow to really define that tool,\n\n213\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.810\nmaybe you can.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n214\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.610\nI'm gonna put her out of her misery now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:19.966\n&gt;&gt; She's thinking alcohol again.\n\n216\n00:12:19.966 --> 00:12:24.017\n[LAUGH] MoSCoW is must-have, should have,\n\n217\n00:12:24.017 --> 00:12:27.572\ncould have, and would like.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n218\n00:12:27.572 --> 00:12:30.338\n&gt;&gt; Amaze of the functionalities that\n\n219\n00:12:30.338 --> 00:12:33.674\nare specified when we define user story,\n\n220\n00:12:33.674 --> 00:12:38.170\nthen we have to think about,\nwhat our must-haves are.\n\n221\n00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.590\nBut also then, what our should have, and\nwhat our could haves, and what I won't\n\n222\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.570\nhave right now, or I would like in\nthe future, what those criteria are.\n\n223\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:53.680\nAnd the golden rule is really we to need\nmeet a minimum of 65% of our must haves.\n\n224\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.800\nAnd a lot of organizations will actually\ninsist on meeting at least 80% of\n\n225\n00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.600\nthe must haves.\n\n226\n00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.156\nSo the funcationality has to be\nable to meet those must haves.\n\n227\n00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:05.428\nAnd then it'a up to you to decide\nhow many the should haves or\n\n228\n00:13:05.428 --> 00:13:07.920\ncould haves you're gonna feature in there.\n\n229\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.952\nNow, now that I've said all of\nthat let's think about Agile, and\n\n230\n00:13:11.952 --> 00:13:14.700\nremember our lean principles within Agile.\n\n231\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.290\nAnd you don't develop something\nthat you're not going to use.\n\n232\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.600\nSo when we talk about must-haves, and\nshould-haves, and could-haves etc.,\n\n233\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.750\nthink about what's going\nto be used by the customer.\n\n234\n00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.070\nYes, you can add an additional\nfunctionality, but\n\n235\n00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.870\nif they're not going to use it\nthen why are you developing it?\n\n236\n00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.990\nThat's certainly not an Agile principle.\n\n237\n00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.700\nSo think about this,\nmaybe that in our customer story\n\n238\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.376\nwe've talked about having our online\ngrocery shopping delivered to our home.\n\n239\n00:13:44.376 --> 00:13:48.240\nAnd maybe as an additional functionality\nwe could actually get a cup of coffee\n\n240\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.480\ndelivered along with our grocery order.\n\n241\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.880\nBut given that our grocery order is\ngoing to sit in the back of a van for\n\n242\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.120\npotentially an hour before\nit's delivered to our home,\n\n243\n00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.190\ndo we really want a cold cup of coffee?\n\n244\n00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:04.203\nProbably not, so that nice to have\nfeature is probably not going to be used.\n\n245\n00:14:04.203 --> 00:14:10.670\nSo why are you wasting time in identifying\nand defining that particular feature,\n\n246\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.900\nif it's nice to have then\nit shouldn't be included?\n\n247\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.780\nSo some examples of acceptance criteria\nthat we have for this particular\n\n248\n00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.400\nuser story, there are things like items\nare not delivered until funds are cleared.\n\n249\n00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.880\nOr where a chosen item is not available,\nfor instance when the user or\n\n250\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.430\nthe customer chooses something\nthat a substitution is made.\n\n251\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.720\nBut then you wanna put rules\nin place like, it's no good\n\n252\n00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.290\nif my pork chops aren't available\n[LAUGH] when I've ordered my pork chops.\n\n253\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.190\nAnd you want to send me a joint of beef,\nand\n\n254\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.300\nI have an allergy to beef, then that's\nnot really going to help me any.\n\n255\n00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.650\nSo again you have to consider\nhow you approach those, and\n\n256\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.210\nthat's just an example here.\n\n257\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.488\nSo what do we do,\nif we're going to input the option for\n\n258\n00:14:59.488 --> 00:15:02.100\nsubstitutions in place, okay?\n\n259\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.770\nOr maybe of value of delivery\nshouldn't exceed more than $5,000 or\n\n260\n00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.910\n5000 pounds for\nthe security of the delivery driver.\n\n261\n00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.930\nOr that might not be necessarily\nthe security of the delivery driver more\n\n262\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.860\nlikely the safety of the delivery driver,\n\n263\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.805\nbecause he's got to carry\nthat into your home.\n\n264\n00:15:17.805 --> 00:15:22.050\n[LAUGH] So these are just\nexamples of acceptance criteria.\n\n265\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.330\nThis is the functionality of\nthe software that you have to deliver.\n\n266\n00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.960\nSo you have to ensure that\nyou have to have the funds,\n\n267\n00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.580\nthey've got to have cleared before\nsomebody then goes around the store and\n\n268\n00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.980\nactually, gets all of the groceries and\nputs them into a bag.\n\n269\n00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.290\nYou also have to ensure that your\nfunctionality will highlight stock levels,\n\n270\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.815\nand highlight where we don't\nhave the relevant stock and\n\n271\n00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:51.736\nthen suggest substitutions.\n\n272\n00:15:51.736 --> 00:15:56.762\nYou also have to ensure that your\nfunctionality in your software, and\n\n273\n00:15:56.762 --> 00:16:02.641\nthen once it gets to above 5,000 pounds,\nwell, then it rejects that order or\n\n274\n00:16:02.641 --> 00:16:08.200\nmaybe it gives out an error message to\nsay it's above our transaction limit.\n\n275\n00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.300\nSo these are the examples of\nour acceptance criteria, and\n\n276\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.260\nwe should be testing all of these\nto make sure that they work.\n\n277\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.360\nUltimately, when you're defining a good\ncustomer story, a good user story,\n\n278\n00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.530\nwe use this acronym,\nwe used the acronym, INVEST.\n\n279\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.237\nINVEST means that, very simply, a good\nuser story should be independent, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.763\nWe should be able to, what this means is\nyou should be able to implement that user\n\n281\n00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:39.230\nstory or that functionality independently.\n\n282\n00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.880\nIt's not dependent on another story.\n\n283\n00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.830\nSo we don't have to put two\nstories in place together.\n\n284\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:51.160\nThe user story should be independent, and\nthe user story should also be negotiable.\n\n285\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:57.290\nNow I have mentioned this right the way\nfrom, our very first episode in Agile.\n\n286\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:04.290\nAgile is about having that flexibility,\nit's why we call it Agile, let's face it.\n\n287\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.930\nIt's not having\nthe requirements cast in stone,\n\n288\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.945\nCherokee likes to call it scope creep.\n\n289\n00:17:10.945 --> 00:17:15.990\n[LAUGH] It's not scope creep,\nit's really about bringing\n\n290\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:21.740\nin enhancements and adapting to change,\nthat's what it is, it's negotiable.\n\n291\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.600\nWe've gotta deliver value, we know this.\n\n292\n00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:29.420\nBut we also have to be able\nto accurately estimate\n\n293\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:34.380\nwhat the story is, well, what it's going\nto take us to be able to deliver that.\n\n294\n00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.770\nNow it says within accuracy tolerances.\n\n295\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:41.530\nWe don't have to be, and you can't be, it\ndoesn't matter how good we are within our\n\n296\n00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.850\nteam and how skilled we are in our team.\n\n297\n00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:49.550\nThe ability to be able to precisely\nestimate, we call it an estimate for\n\n298\n00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:54.450\na reason, precisely estimate how long\na particular piece of programming or\n\n299\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.030\ncoding's going to take.\n\n300\n00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.220\nWell, that not only takes the skill set,\nbut\n\n301\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.530\nalso it's very, very difficult to achieve.\n\n302\n00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.780\nA good story should be small, remember our\niterations were a maximum of four weeks.\n\n303\n00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:12.730\nThat's four weeks from beginning to end,\nthat's four weeks from the user story,\n\n304\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:18.890\nthrough design, and development, and\ntesting, and deployment, four weeks.\n\n305\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.720\nSo that user story better be\nachievable within that four weeks.\n\n306\n00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.470\nAnd your user story has\ngot to be testable,\n\n307\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.760\nthat doesn't sound like a word does it,\ntestable?\n\n308\n00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.302\nBut anyway, it works [LAUGH] and\nwe've gotta be able to test the story.\n\n309\n00:18:32.302 --> 00:18:37.870\nWe've gotta be able to\ntest the deliverable,\n\n310\n00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:42.740\nwe've got to be able to test the output.\n\n311\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.410\nAnd then we have something called, and\nthis is where we're gonna leave it for\n\n312\n00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.550\nthis particular session, and then we're\ngonna come back in our next session and\n\n313\n00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.080\nwe're gonna carry on\ntalking about stories.\n\n314\n00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.370\nBut this is where we\ndiscuss our epic stories.\n\n315\n00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:04.400\nEpic stories are made up of\nstories that deliver value.\n\n316\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.040\nIn other words,\nI've already mentioned that the I for\n\n317\n00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.940\nINVEST stands for independent.\n\n318\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.500\nWell, all stories should be independent\nand we should be capable of programming\n\n319\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.870\nand delivering each story\nindependently of another one.\n\n320\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:25.730\nBut nevertheless, we're probably still\ngoing to group some stories together\n\n321\n00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.910\nin order to deliver value to the customer.\n\n322\n00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.760\nBecause the customer might not perceive\nvalue in just one individual story.\n\n323\n00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.272\nBut they might perceive value in two\nstories being delivered at the same time,\n\n324\n00:19:39.272 --> 00:19:39.780\nokay?\n\n325\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.679\nNow, we can develop these stories\nin more than one increment or\n\n326\n00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:47.540\nmore than one iteration.\n\n327\n00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.468\nIt's still exactly the same, we have\nexactly the same principles as the regular\n\n328\n00:19:51.468 --> 00:19:54.780\nuser story but what we're doing\nis we're just grouping together.\n\n329\n00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.910\n&gt;&gt; Rolling them out together.\n\n330\n00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.856\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're grouping them together,\n\n331\n00:19:57.856 --> 00:20:00.212\nwe'll talk about releases\nin another episode.\n\n332\n00:20:00.212 --> 00:20:04.983\nBut we're just grouping together user\nstories that will actually deliver\n\n333\n00:20:04.983 --> 00:20:06.720\nvalue to the customer.\n\n334\n00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.370\nBut, independently,\neach story won't deliver value, okay?\n\n335\n00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.330\nSo an epic story is just\na collective story.\n\n336\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.155\nNow we mind to split those\nindividual stories, the ones that\n\n337\n00:20:19.155 --> 00:20:23.840\nmake up the epic story, we might split\nthem over more than one iteration.\n\n338\n00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.190\nCuz it may be that we're working on\none particular iteration right now,\n\n339\n00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:33.910\nand the functionality hasn't been\nprovided to us by the supplier yet.\n\n340\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.150\nSo we're gonna work on this bit, but\n\n341\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.870\nthen we're gonna make sure it rolls\nforward into our next iteration.\n\n342\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:41.735\nLet's think about this.\n\n343\n00:20:41.735 --> 00:20:46.570\nWell quite often, so\nsoftware suppliers and\n\n344\n00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.820\nproviders, they will program and\n\n345\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:54.330\ndevelop, maybe an app that's going to\nwork with the next model of phone.\n\n346\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.233\nAnd so they're working that right now.\n\n347\n00:20:57.233 --> 00:21:03.125\nAnd there's nothing stopping them from\nactually developing and deploying,\n\n348\n00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:09.410\nrolling out, that model or that particular\nversion or functionality of that app.\n\n349\n00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.449\nBut actually the functionality's not\ngonna be available until the phone's\n\n350\n00:21:12.449 --> 00:21:14.040\navailable, right?\n\n351\n00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.940\nYeah, so we use this we got term,\nI think of something I think Apple did and\n\n352\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.330\nI'm sure a lot of the other\nmanufacturers did.\n\n353\n00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.951\nBut Apple rolled down a new version of\nthe operating system that allowed for\n\n354\n00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.340\nfingerprint recognition.\n\n355\n00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.651\nHowever, your phone won't allow for\nfingerprint recognition until you went out\n\n356\n00:21:31.651 --> 00:21:36.190\nand actually bought the model of phone\nthat allowed for fingerprint recognition.\n\n357\n00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.760\nAnd so\nthis is what we mean by epic stories,\n\n358\n00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:44.060\nthere are two different items of\nvalue there, two different stories.\n\n359\n00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:48.230\nBut you don't actually see value in\none until you've got the other, and\n\n360\n00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.440\nthat's what we mean by an epic story.\n\n361\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:57.129\nSo it's a story that collectively might\nbe made up of multiple stories or\n\n362\n00:21:57.129 --> 00:22:01.954\nit's one story that's split into two.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:02.920\n&gt;&gt; You're laughing.\n\n364\n00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.628\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n365\n00:22:03.628 --> 00:22:08.960\nit's not about the explanation\nis just about the term.\n\n366\n00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.300\nThat's one of those words that\nhave just been totally overused.\n\n367\n00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.336\n&gt;&gt; What, the word story?\n\n368\n00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:16.601\n&gt;&gt; No, epic.\n\n369\n00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:17.111\n&gt;&gt; Epic [LAUGH].\n\n370\n00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:19.445\n&gt;&gt; It was an epic night last night,\n\n371\n00:22:19.445 --> 00:22:23.011\nlike social media.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but some of our developers do\n\n372\n00:22:23.011 --> 00:22:27.202\nproduce some epic work, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n373\n00:22:27.202 --> 00:22:28.767\n&gt;&gt; I wish I hadn't said that now, right?\n\n374\n00:22:28.767 --> 00:22:31.371\n&gt;&gt; And that was an epic episode, Jo, so\n\n375\n00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:35.077\nthanks for that info, but\nI think we are out of time.\n\n376\n00:22:35.077 --> 00:22:37.592\nOr the users are gonna\nforce us to be out of time\n\n377\n00:22:37.592 --> 00:22:40.621\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling slightly nauseous with all\n\n378\n00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:42.112\nof that but anyway, yep.\n\n379\n00:22:42.112 --> 00:22:44.909\nYeah, we're out of time, definitely.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's time to sign out.\n\n380\n00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:47.710\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n381\n00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.649\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n382\n00:22:50.649 --> 00:22:56.650\n[MUSIC]\n\n383\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.979\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\n\n5\n00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:15.660\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.742\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:22.050\nHere we are in a part two where we\ncontinue looking at user stories.\n\n8\n00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.750\nAnd of course,\nwith us back in studios we have Mrs.\n\n9\n00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.490\nJo Peacock, how's it going today Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Cherokee,\n\n10\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.474\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing lovely,\n\n11\n00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:35.229\nI'm ready for some more story time\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can't promise you it's\n\n12\n00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.770\ngonna end well, though.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.590\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, we're gonna carry on,\n\n14\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.360\nwe're looking at user stories.\n\n15\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.919\nWe're in a part two,\nas you've already said.\n\n16\n00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:48.777\nAnd in part one we looked at\ndefining the user story and\n\n17\n00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:52.400\nsimply articulating what\nit is that a user wants.\n\n18\n00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.650\nAnd we also looked at epic stories.\n\n19\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.620\nWhich is, well, a collection of stories\nthat we've got grouped together.\n\n20\n00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.408\nIt's what we will deliver as a whole, not\nnecessarily what we deliver one by one.\n\n21\n00:01:06.408 --> 00:01:07.838\nThese are our individual stories.\n\n22\n00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:13.970\nBut an epic story, it's a story that\ncompletes the value deliverable.\n\n23\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.320\nSo right now then we're looking at\nsort of coordinating our stories.\n\n24\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.337\nAnd actually, well,\nwe'll talk about facilitation.\n\n25\n00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:24.280\nWe'll talk about estimating\nusers stories as well.\n\n26\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.655\nAnd yes, there will be a part three\nepisode to our user stories too.\n\n27\n00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.150\nWhere we look at prioritizing\nour user stories as well.\n\n28\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.230\nSo we like storytelling.\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n29\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.046\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See, cuz it sends her to sleep,\n\n30\n00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:45.506\nthat's why we like storytelling, right?\n&gt;&gt; You gonna tuck me in,\n\n31\n00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:47.350\nJo?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, you're all right.\n\n32\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.476\nNo, I've never be that sort of person, no.\n\n33\n00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:54.504\nYou want a story, here's the book,\nthat's what I'm saying [LAUGH].\n\n34\n00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:57.360\nSo what do we do with\nour user stories then?\n\n35\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.064\nWell first of all, we know we've got\nto compile our user stories, and\n\n36\n00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:04.310\nour user stories our endpoints.\n\n37\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.940\nThese are our points of value to\nour customer and to our users.\n\n38\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.140\nAnd let me just give you an example,\nlet's go back.\n\n39\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.120\nHere we have an example of a user\nstory as a retail customer.\n\n40\n00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.470\nThe customer wants to be able to order\nfood and buy food wherever they are,\n\n41\n00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.950\nso that they can have food delivered to\ntheir own home without having to shop.\n\n42\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.790\nSo that's an example of a user story,\nwe're solving a need.\n\n43\n00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.910\nAnd the value is that,\n\n44\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.100\nwell I can have food delivered to\nmy home without having to shop.\n\n45\n00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.310\nThat's the value that\nthe customer receives\n\n46\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.976\nfrom the piece of functionality,\nthe functionality that\n\n47\n00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:43.802\nwe're about to design.\n&gt;&gt; Did you know that I just placed my\n\n48\n00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:46.920\norder right now?\n&gt;&gt; Did you?\n\n49\n00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.100\n[LAUGH] Did you buy anything exciting?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna have some,\n\n50\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.690\nwhat's a real good southern?\n&gt;&gt; I thought it was margaritas, actually.\n\n51\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n52\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.210\nI don't know if you can\norder liquor via online.\n\n53\n00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.644\n&gt;&gt; No, we need to go back to England.\n\n54\n00:03:03.644 --> 00:03:05.072\n&gt;&gt; I'm sheltered, yeah,\n\n55\n00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:06.500\nI'm in a little bubble.\n\n56\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.320\nI don't know all of these cool things.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we need to go back to England.\n\n57\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.478\nWe really, really do.\n\n58\n00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:13.231\nCuz if you're ordering biscuits and\ngravy or something like that,\n\n59\n00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:15.530\nthen we definitely need to go back.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.750\n&gt;&gt; So what do we do with our user stories\n\n61\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.450\nthen, apart from allowing Cherokee to\norder anything online that she wants?\n\n62\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.350\nWell, what we wanna do is make sure that\nwe are delivering the project as a whole.\n\n63\n00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.970\nBearing in mind we're still\ndelivering iterations, and\n\n64\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.830\nour stories form part of our iteration.\n\n65\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.926\nIn other words, the functionalities that\nwe're delivering to resolve each story or\n\n66\n00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:41.841\nsatisfy each story form\npart of each iteration.\n\n67\n00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:46.071\nBut we're still have got to think\nabout the project as a whole and\n\n68\n00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:47.413\nwhat our vision is.\n\n69\n00:03:47.413 --> 00:03:53.980\nSo what we do is, when we document these\nstories, and we talked about story cards.\n\n70\n00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.648\nAnd adding our exceptions criteria\nonto back of those story cards.\n\n71\n00:03:57.648 --> 00:04:04.625\nWell, our collection of stories for any\ngiven project is what we call a backlog.\n\n72\n00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:10.970\nAnd that backlog is the list of stories\nthat have still to be completed.\n\n73\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.130\nThat's our backlog, that's why it's called\na backlog, it's what we've still gotta do,\n\n74\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.201\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Those things that just don't\n\n75\n00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.984\never shrink or go away?\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say\n\n76\n00:04:19.984 --> 00:04:20.606\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:04:20.606 --> 00:04:23.501\n&gt;&gt; That would be an inefficient project,\n\n78\n00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:24.430\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n79\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.260\nby the time you're finished with one,\nyou're getting another one added on.\n\n80\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.646\nOkay, I won't be a Debbie Downer,\nI'll stop.\n\n81\n00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:31.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n82\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.850\nOkay, now maybe that's\ntrue in some projects.\n\n83\n00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.450\nAnd certainly at\nthe beginning of a project,\n\n84\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.128\nthat might definitely be the case.\n\n85\n00:04:39.128 --> 00:04:42.150\nAnd when you've got a project\nthat's an ongoing project,\n\n86\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.970\nlike the delivery of an operating\nsystem for instance.\n\n87\n00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.590\nThat may well be the case that,\nas we knock one off,\n\n88\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.270\nwe might add another one on.\n\n89\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.358\nBut towards the end of the project,\n\n90\n00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:55.540\nI don't expect us to be sort of adding\na lot more on at that point in time.\n\n91\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.312\nNot unless you're feeling\nany incredibly pessimistic.\n\n92\n00:04:58.312 --> 00:04:59.328\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:59.328 --> 00:05:02.073\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we wanna make sure that our\n\n94\n00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:06.625\nstories and the backlog itself\nis visible to everybody.\n\n95\n00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:11.097\nAnd if it's visible to everybody,\nthat means that we can all, as a team,\n\n96\n00:05:11.097 --> 00:05:14.487\nthe project team,\ncan all then look at these stories and\n\n97\n00:05:14.487 --> 00:05:18.117\nsee what skills are needed to\nbe able to deliver each story.\n\n98\n00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:22.474\nBut also it allows them to\nreconcile stories that might be\n\n99\n00:05:22.474 --> 00:05:24.848\nconflicting with each other.\n\n100\n00:05:24.848 --> 00:05:28.560\nOr maybe overlapping stories,\nstories where there's duplication.\n\n101\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.600\nYou see these are user stories, and\n\n102\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.840\nwe've looked in previous episodes at\nthe variety of users that we've got.\n\n103\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.150\nAnd different users have\ndifferent perceptions, and\n\n104\n00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.100\ntherefore they've got different wants and\n\n105\n00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.060\ndifferent requirements from any particular\nnew functionality or from any new service.\n\n106\n00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.120\nWhich means that we're gonna\nhave different user stories.\n\n107\n00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.400\nAnd some of them might conflict and\nsome of them might overlap.\n\n108\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.506\nWhat we need to make\nsure that we do though,\n\n109\n00:05:55.506 --> 00:05:58.342\nbearing in mind that we wanna\nwork with lean principles.\n\n110\n00:05:58.342 --> 00:06:00.610\nAnd we wanna be efficient and\nwe want to be effective.\n\n111\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.496\nSo what we need to do is any\ndiscussions about the stories,\n\n112\n00:06:05.496 --> 00:06:09.298\nwell we need to facilitate\nthat discussion.\n\n113\n00:06:09.298 --> 00:06:14.316\nSo somebody's got to make the decisions\nabout which stories we keep and\n\n114\n00:06:14.316 --> 00:06:19.740\nwhich stories we go back to the user and\nmaybe look to tweak or change.\n\n115\n00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.820\nBut somebody's also go to make the\ndecisions about priorities, etc., as well.\n\n116\n00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.089\nSo somebody makes those decisions,\n\n117\n00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:33.808\nwho do you think it is?\n&gt;&gt; Decisions about the story, all right so\n\n118\n00:06:33.808 --> 00:06:37.990\nit's either gonna be the SCRUM master or\nthe product owner.\n\n119\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.020\nSo the stories, I'm gonna go with\nthe owner because it directly affects\n\n120\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.561\nthe functionality of that product.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n121\n00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:49.340\nremember that the SCRUM master facilitates\nthe smooth running of the team.\n\n122\n00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.230\nSo the SCRUM master will facilitate\nsort of personnel issues.\n\n123\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.090\nThe SCRUM master will ensure that\nthe team have got the necessary skills,\n\n124\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.200\nthat the team are working\ntogether in a collaborative way.\n\n125\n00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.930\nBut the product owner makes decisions and\nmediates when it comes to functionality.\n\n126\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.990\nSo the product owner is going\nto get involved in this.\n\n127\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.333\nSo the vision and\n\n128\n00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:18.327\nthe scope have also got to have\nan influence on your user stories as well.\n\n129\n00:07:18.327 --> 00:07:22.818\nIt's quite often that when we're\nout canvasing our users for\n\n130\n00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:24.466\ntheir requirements.\n\n131\n00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:28.535\nAnd roles that are performing sort\nof business relationship management\n\n132\n00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:33.180\nfunctionality and roles, they're\ngonna have a key influence in this.\n\n133\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.120\nBut it's quite often that when we\nare going out there canvassing users for\n\n134\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.510\ntheir requirements, that we come up\nwith a disparate array, a plethora\n\n135\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.310\nof requirements from the users, that\ncould be related to absolutely anything.\n\n136\n00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.449\nBut we're in one project and\nwe're focusing on one project here.\n\n137\n00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:55.905\nSo what we've gotta do is, we've\ngotta make sure that the stories that\n\n138\n00:07:55.905 --> 00:07:58.803\nwe are compiling are relevant\nto the vision and\n\n139\n00:07:58.803 --> 00:08:01.345\nthe scope of the actual project itself.\n\n140\n00:08:01.345 --> 00:08:04.488\nAnd this is not just a customer wish list.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n141\n00:08:04.488 --> 00:08:09.306\nbecause you're gonna have little one-offs\nrandom features that not many people\n\n142\n00:08:09.306 --> 00:08:12.080\nare really gonna care about.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n143\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.840\nwe wanna make sure that we try and\ndeliver as much of the scope as possible.\n\n144\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.430\nBut we also want to make\nsure that we're not sort of\n\n145\n00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.730\nrunning off all over the place.\n\n146\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.140\nWe still gotta keep within\nthe scope of the project.\n\n147\n00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.889\nSo we're not gonna have, necessarily,\na definitive set of stories up front.\n\n148\n00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:34.660\nBecause we've got to\nestimate those stories.\n\n149\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.545\nBut once we get into each story,\nwe've then got to start and\n\n150\n00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:44.930\ndefine exactly what each story means and\nwe design the solution.\n\n151\n00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:51.030\nSo don't expect to have a definitive\nset of stories up front.\n\n152\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.650\nAnd don't expect to have\ndesign documentation for\n\n153\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.995\nthose stories either because\nthat's not going to happen.\n\n154\n00:08:57.995 --> 00:09:02.765\nAnd exactly as you just said earlier on,\nthese are going to evolve, and yeah,\n\n155\n00:09:02.765 --> 00:09:04.875\nwe're gonna start off with\nten stories right now.\n\n156\n00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:08.825\nBut then, after our first iteration,\nwe might find that our storyboard has,\n\n157\n00:09:08.825 --> 00:09:13.910\nall of a sudden, 30 stories that have\ncome out of customer requirements but\n\n158\n00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.408\nhave also come out of iterations.\n\n159\n00:09:16.408 --> 00:09:21.520\nBecause as the result of developing one\niteration or developing for one story,\n\n160\n00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.570\nwe might realize that we might also\nwant to add in additional functionality.\n\n161\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:30.230\nOr maybe we want to adjust or\nremove some functionality as well.\n\n162\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.240\nSo I use the word estimate there and\nestimating the stories.\n\n163\n00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.727\nWell, we call that estimating\nthe deliverables, so\n\n164\n00:09:39.727 --> 00:09:42.330\nI've got another question for you.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n165\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.969\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I like these sorta things.\n\n166\n00:09:43.969 --> 00:09:48.315\nAnd so Taylor's gonna show me the full\nscreen on this one right now.\n\n167\n00:09:48.315 --> 00:09:51.075\nSo tell me if we were estimating,\n\n168\n00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:56.125\nhere's a key word, if we were\nestimating the deliverable on a story,\n\n169\n00:09:56.125 --> 00:10:04.184\nwhich of these would you want to pick?\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n170\n00:10:04.184 --> 00:10:09.342\nokay, [LAUGH] so I want to go top left for\nprecise and accurate.\n\n171\n00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.669\nYou emphasized the word estimate, so\n\n172\n00:10:11.669 --> 00:10:16.398\nI'm going to assume that I'm looking at\nthe one bellow that for imprecise but\n\n173\n00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:17.138\naccurate.\n\n174\n00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:18.188\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n175\n00:10:18.188 --> 00:10:19.179\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm using the word-\n\n176\n00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:23.943\n&gt;&gt; That's my test-taking logic.\n\n177\n00:10:23.943 --> 00:10:25.615\n&gt;&gt; Actually, that wasn't bad, right?\n\n178\n00:10:25.615 --> 00:10:27.578\nWe got to the right answer on that one.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n179\n00:10:27.578 --> 00:10:28.371\n&gt;&gt; I'm quite impressed.\n\n180\n00:10:28.371 --> 00:10:29.711\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n181\n00:10:29.711 --> 00:10:31.093\n&gt;&gt; You can't estimate\n\n182\n00:10:31.093 --> 00:10:32.460\nprecisely.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n183\n00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.630\n&gt;&gt; It's not an estimation if it's precise.\n\n184\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.530\nYou cannot estimate precisely.\n\n185\n00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.350\nAt the beginning of a project,\njust right at the top,\n\n186\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.770\nwe're talking about estimating\nthe deliverables in plural.\n\n187\n00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.308\nAt the beginning of a project,\nyou cannot do that.\n\n188\n00:10:46.308 --> 00:10:47.284\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:10:47.284 --> 00:10:50.750\n&gt;&gt; And this is where traditional waterfall\n\n190\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.490\napproaches don't always work for\nprojects where we need to\n\n191\n00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:00.890\nsee quick results and projects where\nwe know that scope will change.\n\n192\n00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:05.980\nSo you can't always get to number one,\nthat top left-hand one.\n\n193\n00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.420\nSo what we want to do is make sure\nthat we've got accurate estimations.\n\n194\n00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.720\nBut they're not precise because we don't\nyet know exactly what we're going to do.\n\n195\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.426\nThat top right-hand corner,\nyou can see they're actually way,\n\n196\n00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:20.156\nway off-\n&gt;&gt; Missed\n\n197\n00:11:20.156 --> 00:11:20.880\nthe mark.\n&gt;&gt; The target.\n\n198\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've completely miss the mark.\n\n199\n00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.108\nWe're delivering something else\nat that point in time, and\n\n200\n00:11:25.108 --> 00:11:28.540\nI'm not too sure what it is But\nwe're delivering something else.\n\n201\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.490\nAnd the bottom right-hand corner there,\nimprecise and inaccurate,\n\n202\n00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.725\nwe don't know what we're delivering and\nwe don't know how we're gonna do it.\n\n203\n00:11:35.725 --> 00:11:38.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would say give them points for\n\n204\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.245\neffort, but according to you in the UK,\nyou don't do that.\n\n205\n00:11:42.245 --> 00:11:42.763\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n206\n00:11:42.763 --> 00:11:43.665\n&gt;&gt; Everyone doesn't get\n\n207\n00:11:43.665 --> 00:11:48.322\na trophy at the end of the game.\n&gt;&gt; Look, we've all watched those programs,\n\n208\n00:11:48.322 --> 00:11:53.314\nthe programs where we have people\nsinging up on a stage and yeah,\n\n209\n00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:55.807\nwe're British, okay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:11:55.807 --> 00:11:57.292\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna sit there and\n\n211\n00:11:57.292 --> 00:12:00.530\ngo, that was great, my ears are hurting.\n&gt;&gt; We need a little\n\n212\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.210\nx button over here to\nslam the little button.\n\n213\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:08.158\nYeah, actually, you know what,\nthat's not a bad idea with projects now.\n\n214\n00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:12.000\nNext episode, [LAUGH] we've got ourselves\nan x button, and we're having one.\n\n215\n00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.070\nSo when it comes to estimation, precise\nestimates are really, really difficult.\n\n216\n00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:23.370\nWe do not want to waste time\ntrying to get precise estimates.\n\n217\n00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.530\nRemember, we're being efficient.\n\n218\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.050\nWe want to have estimates.\n\n219\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.290\nWe want to estimate how long\nsomething is going to take, but\n\n220\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.842\nwe're not going to estimate.\n\n221\n00:12:32.842 --> 00:12:35.820\nWe wanna estimate roughly how\nmuch work it's going to take,\n\n222\n00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.720\nbecause that's how we get to\nhow long is it gonna take.\n\n223\n00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.040\nBut we're not going to be\nprecise with that estimate,\n\n224\n00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.750\nbecause if it's an estimate,\nthen we're using it as a planning tool.\n\n225\n00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:52.550\nAnd if it's precise, then it's\nthe actual design itself, isn't it?\n\n226\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.790\nSo all of a sudden, we're not estimating,\n\n227\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.385\nwe're actually designing-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Doing it during that\n\n228\n00:12:57.385 --> 00:13:00.090\ninitiation process or\nthat beginning phase.\n\n229\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we don't wanna do that.\n\n230\n00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.060\nWe just wanna roughly\nestimate how much time and\n\n231\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.730\nhow much effort it's going to\ntake to develop each story.\n\n232\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:14.141\nI really love the kind of the,\nI guess, 1.3 bullet point up there,\n\n233\n00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:19.380\nwhere it tells us to embrace\nthe concepts that we learn as we go.\n\n234\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.510\nYou're not going to be precise up front,\n\n235\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.910\nand we don't want you\nto be precise up front.\n\n236\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.720\nBecause if you're being precise up front,\nyou're wasting time.\n\n237\n00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.760\nIt's more important to have\na shared understanding of the work\n\n238\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.270\nthan it is to be accurate.\n\n239\n00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.740\nBecause the team itself,\n\n240\n00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.240\ncollaboratively, collectively,\nhave got to deliver the work.\n\n241\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.400\nAnd so it's up to the team to decide how\nthey're going to divide up that work.\n\n242\n00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.430\nNow, we've talked before about looking\n\n243\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.900\nat using techniques like Rock,\nPaper, Scissors I think that\n\n244\n00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:01.147\nRob does to do our estimation on-\n&gt;&gt; Do you we need to a TV timeout so\n\n245\n00:14:01.147 --> 00:14:02.725\nthat you can play-\n&gt;&gt; Do we wanna do-\n\n246\n00:14:02.725 --> 00:14:04.166\n&gt;&gt; Your first game of Rock, Paper,\n\n247\n00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:05.760\nScissors in your life?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n248\n00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.180\nthen don't we have to get sort of\nRob in here to do the estimation for\n\n249\n00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.031\nus?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n250\n00:14:11.031 --> 00:14:12.784\nI'm calling a TV timeout guys.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n251\n00:14:12.784 --> 00:14:15.020\nwe can call a TV timeout in a moment.\n\n252\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.837\nBecause I wanna just look at the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're vetoing my TV timeout.\n\n253\n00:14:19.837 --> 00:14:22.545\n&gt;&gt; I'm vetoing the TV timeout, I am.\n\n254\n00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:24.365\nBecause just before we do that,\n\n255\n00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:28.145\nI'm gonna look at these common\napproaches there to estimate and effort.\n\n256\n00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:33.042\nBecause what Rob's gonna show us and I\ndon't know, this is completely unexpected.\n\n257\n00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:34.859\nSo welcome to a live TV.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n258\n00:14:34.859 --> 00:14:36.868\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apparently,\n\n259\n00:14:36.868 --> 00:14:39.672\nwhat Rob's gonna show us\nis how they estimate.\n\n260\n00:14:39.672 --> 00:14:44.752\nBut we can estimate using story points or\nwe can estimate using ideal days.\n\n261\n00:14:44.752 --> 00:14:48.082\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthose in a little while.\n\n262\n00:14:48.082 --> 00:14:52.920\nBut what we've got to make\nsure Ii that we do have\n\n263\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.030\ncontingency build into our estimations,\nso when we are doing estimates for\n\n264\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.010\nour stories that we have\ncontingency built in.\n\n265\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.841\nBut we've also got to ensure that\nwe deliver at least 60 to 65%\n\n266\n00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:08.492\nof our requirements.\n\n267\n00:15:08.492 --> 00:15:11.055\nNow, we talked about in our last episode.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n268\n00:15:11.055 --> 00:15:12.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a must have,\n\n269\n00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.020\nshould have, could have, and won't have\nright now or would like in the future.\n\n270\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.790\nAnd what we want to do,\nwe're in a lean environment, so\n\n271\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:26.667\nin Agile,\nwe deliver 60 to 65% of our must-haves.\n\n272\n00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:31.151\nAs far as should-haves and could-haves,\nit's not going to be efficient\n\n273\n00:15:31.151 --> 00:15:34.782\nto spend time on functionality\nthat's not going to be used or\n\n274\n00:15:34.782 --> 00:15:37.010\nfunctionality that we don't want.\n\n275\n00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.150\nSo we've gotta make sure that\nwe produce the estimates.\n\n276\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.600\nAnd in terms of the estimates,\nthe estimates that we rely on, and\n\n277\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.238\nthere are different techniques for\ndoing this and\n\n278\n00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:50.401\nwe're going to look at this in a moment.\n\n279\n00:15:50.401 --> 00:15:54.743\nBut the estimates that we rely\non are the estimates given by\n\n280\n00:15:54.743 --> 00:15:59.364\nthe team members that are actually\ngoing to produce the work.\n\n281\n00:15:59.364 --> 00:16:04.156\nSo let's say we've got a piece of\ndevelopment work in front of us.\n\n282\n00:16:04.156 --> 00:16:07.975\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nproduce that functionality that does this,\n\n283\n00:16:07.975 --> 00:16:09.480\nit's a home shopping app.\n\n284\n00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.280\nLet's face it, we're gonna produce that.\n\n285\n00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.472\nI've estimated five days,\nwhat's your estimate?\n\n286\n00:16:14.472 --> 00:16:15.762\n&gt;&gt; One day.\n\n287\n00:16:15.762 --> 00:16:16.428\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n288\n00:16:16.428 --> 00:16:18.635\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:20.420\n&gt;&gt; Kinda seems ambitious to me but hey,\n\n290\n00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.430\nlet's go for it.\n\n291\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:27.920\nRight, who's going to be doing that work?\n&gt;&gt; It should be\n\n292\n00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.260\nus because we're the estimators, correct?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n293\n00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.910\nit should be you because you've estimated\none day which means that your skills\n\n294\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:38.710\nare better than mine but we've talked\nabout this objectiveness before, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.876\nYou said that you can help me,\nyou've estimated one day, therefore,\n\n296\n00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:46.220\nwe're using your skills, so\nyou own that piece of work.\n\n297\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.840\nIt says so up there on that\nscreen in front of you, right?\n\n298\n00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.001\nOwned by the team member doing the work,\nthat's you.\n\n299\n00:16:51.001 --> 00:16:51.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.295\n&gt;&gt; You put yourself in that one.\n\n301\n00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:56.216\n&gt;&gt; How did we turn into me?\n\n302\n00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:57.370\n&gt;&gt; Well, because\n\n303\n00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.300\nI asked you how long it was gonna\ntake you to do, you said one day.\n\n304\n00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.084\nAnd I thought, hey look, what a hero.\n&gt;&gt; It's fine, it's fine, I got this, Jo.\n\n305\n00:17:04.084 --> 00:17:05.437\n&gt;&gt; Or should I use the word epic?\n\n306\n00:17:05.437 --> 00:17:07.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.970\n&gt;&gt; Maybe in their own place.\n\n308\n00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:13.678\nOkay, so, let's get into our estimation\napproaches, but before we do that,\n\n309\n00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:16.072\nhow about we call in Rob then?\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n310\n00:17:16.072 --> 00:17:17.460\n&gt;&gt; You wanna do your TV timeout?\n\n311\n00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:17.980\n&gt;&gt; Officially,\n\n312\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.905\ncan I do that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go on then.\n\n313\n00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:21.060\nGo for it.\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be a TV timeout.\n\n314\n00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.550\nWe'll see you in a minute.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we've had our timeout and\n\n315\n00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.240\nlook what's just happened.\n\n316\n00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.360\nMiraculously, we have a Rob.\n\n317\n00:17:30.942 --> 00:17:35.910\nSo Rob's gonna tell us just a little bit\nabout how we do estimations here on our\n\n318\n00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.440\nproject.\n\n319\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.990\nSo rather, he's going to demonstrate\nhow we do estimations here cuz Cherokee\n\n320\n00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.569\nand I, well,\nwe've already had our discussion as to how\n\n321\n00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:45.283\nlong it's going to take.\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I explained it\n\n322\n00:17:45.283 --> 00:17:47.840\nvery well, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; You don't think you explained\n\n323\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.730\nit very well.\n\n324\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.910\nYeah, but\nI think her estimation's way out anyway.\n\n325\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.744\n&gt;&gt; My estimation too.\n\n326\n00:17:51.744 --> 00:17:53.015\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't really matter how well\n\n327\n00:17:53.015 --> 00:17:54.600\nshe explains it, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n328\n00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.890\n&gt;&gt; So Rob, tell us,\n\n329\n00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.360\nwhat do we do here?\n&gt;&gt; So at this point,\n\n330\n00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.330\nyou guys have the fun feature?\n&gt;&gt; We have.\n\n331\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.392\n&gt;&gt; And you have a good description and\n\n332\n00:18:03.392 --> 00:18:05.370\nyou've read through it and\neverybody says, we understand what\n\n333\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.436\nwe're gonna ask [INAUDIBLE]?\n&gt;&gt; We have a very well defined\n\n334\n00:18:07.436 --> 00:18:09.219\n[INAUDIBLE] story.\n&gt;&gt; We agree on that part, yes.\n\n335\n00:18:09.219 --> 00:18:09.867\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n336\n00:18:09.867 --> 00:18:15.051\nwe do at that point is we agree that we\nare going us this technique like a rock,\n\n337\n00:18:15.051 --> 00:18:17.820\npaper, scissors technique.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n338\n00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.550\n&gt;&gt; For estimate.\n\n339\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:23.454\nAnd the reason we do it this way is we\nnever want one person's estimate to\n\n340\n00:18:23.454 --> 00:18:25.920\nbe influenced by someone else's.\n\n341\n00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.770\nWe want everybody else to\nbring their honest estimate.\n\n342\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.860\nSo we hide our estimate until the last\nmoment through this rock, paper,\n\n343\n00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.830\nscissors technique.\n\n344\n00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.835\nSo let's try it.\n&gt;&gt; By the way, all the time we've been\n\n345\n00:18:35.835 --> 00:18:41.001\ntalking about objectivity and\nmaking sure that we're not influenced by\n\n346\n00:18:41.001 --> 00:18:46.083\nany emotions and we're not influenced\nby any sort of subjectiveness,\n\n347\n00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:52.120\nthat is actually a very good impartial and\nobjective way of estimating a user story.\n\n348\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.075\nAnd it might sound as though it's\na little bit kind of crazy, but\n\n349\n00:18:55.075 --> 00:18:58.080\nhey, this is Agile and we're fun, right?\n&gt;&gt; You're fun.\n\n350\n00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.690\nOkay, so you guys wanna run through it one\n\n351\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.385\ntime?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n352\n00:19:00.385 --> 00:19:00.942\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go for it.\n\n353\n00:19:00.942 --> 00:19:01.627\n&gt;&gt; Let's demonstrate this technique.\n\n354\n00:19:01.627 --> 00:19:02.152\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n355\n00:19:02.152 --> 00:19:04.283\nAll right, so you've played the game rock,\npaper, scissors.\n\n356\n00:19:04.283 --> 00:19:05.280\n&gt;&gt; I have not.\n\n357\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.220\n&gt;&gt; See, we're already\n\n358\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.250\nat a learning curve here?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we are.\n\n359\n00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, the whole point of\n\n360\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.540\nrock, paper, scissors is that you don't\nreveal what you're gonna choose, rock,\n\n361\n00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.780\npaper, scissors, until the last second.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n362\n00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.400\n&gt;&gt; And so we're gonna\n\n363\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.340\nuse that sort of technique.\n\n364\n00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.290\nSo we take our hand and our fist.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n365\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.014\n&gt;&gt; And if we're estimating on a number\n\n366\n00:19:21.014 --> 00:19:23.910\nscale, hopefully for us like one to five.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n367\n00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.323\n&gt;&gt; Hours days, whatever.\n\n368\n00:19:26.323 --> 00:19:27.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whatever your scales is.\n\n369\n00:19:27.725 --> 00:19:28.856\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's talk about days.\n\n370\n00:19:28.856 --> 00:19:29.378\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n371\n00:19:29.378 --> 00:19:30.155\n&gt;&gt; We were talking about days.\n\n372\n00:19:30.155 --> 00:19:31.432\n&gt;&gt; Okay, days for our feature.\n\n373\n00:19:31.432 --> 00:19:35.960\nThen we're gonna say rock,\npaper, scissors, throw.\n\n374\n00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.768\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; And on this third one, you reveal your\n\n375\n00:19:37.768 --> 00:19:39.826\nnumber and then we'll go from there, okay?\n\n376\n00:19:39.826 --> 00:19:40.374\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n377\n00:19:40.374 --> 00:19:41.296\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n378\n00:19:41.296 --> 00:19:41.907\nready?\n&gt;&gt; Let's go for\n\n379\n00:19:41.907 --> 00:19:42.523\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n380\n00:19:42.523 --> 00:19:43.831\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm gonna lead this, right?\n\n381\n00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:46.712\nRock, paper, scissors, throw.\n\n382\n00:19:46.712 --> 00:19:48.428\nAll right, so I have a three-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n383\n00:19:48.428 --> 00:19:49.710\nexcellent.\n&gt;&gt; You had\n\n384\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.860\na five.\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n385\n00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.700\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee threw a one.\n\n386\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.620\nSo I'm sort of in the middle.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n387\n00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.024\n&gt;&gt; And then you two are the outliers, so\n\n388\n00:19:56.024 --> 00:19:58.713\nat this point we have disagreement\non how long the story is gonna take.\n\n389\n00:19:58.713 --> 00:19:59.685\n&gt;&gt; We certainly do.\n\n390\n00:19:59.685 --> 00:20:00.985\n&gt;&gt; Been the theme of the show.\n\n391\n00:20:00.985 --> 00:20:02.325\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:20:02.325 --> 00:20:03.573\n&gt;&gt; So at this point,\n\n393\n00:20:03.573 --> 00:20:08.239\nthe outliers need to explain why\nthey think the feature that we just\n\n394\n00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:11.920\nlooked at should either take less time or\nmore time.\n\n395\n00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.020\nWe're pretty close actually a three and\na five in our scale of Fibonacci scale\n\n396\n00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.001\nis pretty close.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n397\n00:20:17.001 --> 00:20:18.640\n&gt;&gt; But Cherokee's is really low.\n\n398\n00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.115\nSo Cherokee, can you explain\nwhy you think this new feature\n\n399\n00:20:22.115 --> 00:20:23.413\nis only a one?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n400\n00:20:23.413 --> 00:20:27.150\nlet's just say maybe I have\na great performance record.\n\n401\n00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:32.040\nI don't expect it to take very long.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n402\n00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.224\n[INAUDIBLE] I'm being objective and\nwe mentioned about skills and\n\n403\n00:20:36.224 --> 00:20:40.800\nhaving different people in the team\nthat have a varied range of skills.\n\n404\n00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.030\nYeah, we didn't mention about how\nbig their heads needed to be,\n\n405\n00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.932\nright?\n&gt;&gt; So at this point,\n\n406\n00:20:45.932 --> 00:20:49.834\nshe has not convinced, so I'm probably\ngonna either write the story as a five or\n\n407\n00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:52.320\na three, somewhere in there.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n408\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.540\nYeah, and, maybe then what we can do\nis we can reach a compromise by working\n\n409\n00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.100\ntogether.\n\n410\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.120\nWe collaborate because the idea is,\nof course, in an Agile team we have\n\n411\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.011\ncollaboration, and we'll collaborate and\ncome up with a solution that will actually\n\n412\n00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:08.722\nresolve that user story within four days.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe so,\n\n413\n00:21:08.722 --> 00:21:09.679\nthat'd be good-\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n414\n00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:13.420\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Not quite the one though.\n\n415\n00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.510\n&gt;&gt; But, anyway, thank you very much,\n\n416\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.140\nRob, for your involvement.\n\n417\n00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.087\nSo now I guess we'll\ntake another TV timeout.\n\n418\n00:21:20.087 --> 00:21:21.447\nAnd all of a sudden,\n\n419\n00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:23.500\nRob will miraculously,\n&gt;&gt; Vanish.\n\n420\n00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.480\n&gt;&gt; Disappear.\n\n421\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.180\n&gt;&gt; Vanish.\n\n422\n00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.630\n&gt;&gt; Just like that,\n\n423\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.090\npoof.\n&gt;&gt; Where did he go?\n\n424\n00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.386\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I don't know,\n\n425\n00:21:31.386 --> 00:21:35.401\nthat's the magic of TV.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But actually, you know what,\n\n426\n00:21:35.401 --> 00:21:38.330\nhe was really helpful.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n427\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.620\n&gt;&gt; That's just one of the many ways\n\n428\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.820\nthat we can estimate our user stories and\n\n429\n00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.020\nwe can estimate the amount\nof work that's involved.\n\n430\n00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.690\nAnd yeah,\nthere's nothing wrong with making it fun.\n\n431\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.425\nAnd I really like the objectiveness\nof that, I don't know about you but.\n\n432\n00:21:51.425 --> 00:21:51.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n433\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.480\n&gt;&gt; It kinda makes sense to me.\n\n434\n00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.420\nAll we wanna make sure\nis that we have a way of\n\n435\n00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.040\nactually getting to our\nestimates though as well.\n\n436\n00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.700\nAnd it's not just about\ngiving the estimates.\n\n437\n00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.750\nWhen Rob said to you, how come you just\n\n438\n00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.030\nmanaged to get a warning.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n439\n00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.940\n&gt;&gt; And we're kind of\n\n440\n00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.150\nat the top end of the scale.\n\n441\n00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.541\nNormaly, we'd estimate based on sort of\nour previous experience and maybe our\n\n442\n00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:17.590\nskill levels and maybe not whether we\nsaid they were better than we are.\n\n443\n00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.320\n&gt;&gt; Maybe they were a little [INAUDIBLE].\n\n444\n00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.430\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n445\n00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:25.300\nBut ultimately however you do your\nestimation, it's gotta be consistent.\n\n446\n00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.470\nIt's gotta be consistent\nacross the team as well.\n\n447\n00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.620\nSo we want to use estimating to ensure\n\n448\n00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.790\nthat the whole team are on\nexactly the same scale and\n\n449\n00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:41.150\nto ensure that we've all got an accurate\nestimate about how long it's going to\n\n450\n00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:46.430\ntake to actually produce that particular\nstory or at least resolve that story.\n\n451\n00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.010\nSo when it comes estimates and\nestimate revision,\n\n452\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.660\nwe wanna make sure that that\ncalculation that we did is facilitated.\n\n453\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.925\nAnd actually what Rob did is absolutely\nperfect for us because he came in and\n\n454\n00:22:59.925 --> 00:23:03.970\nhe facilitated that to ensure\nthat we had that objectivity.\n\n455\n00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:09.930\nAnd at the end of each time box, sorry,\nat the beginning of each time box,\n\n456\n00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.700\nthe beginning of each situation,\nwhen we start to do our development,\n\n457\n00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.240\nthat's when we want to start and\ndo our estimating.\n\n458\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.180\nAnd you'll see here the scale that Rob was\ntalking about, this is the scale that we\n\n459\n00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:26.540\nwould use which are story points.\n\n460\n00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.740\nSo at least that's the scale\nthat Rob was talking about.\n\n461\n00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.030\nWe could use what we\ncall ideal days as well.\n\n462\n00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.980\nIt doesn't have to be story points.\n\n463\n00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:38.310\nBut story points, you'll see the word\nthat he used, the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n464\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.710\nThat's something to google.\n\n465\n00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.870\nYou don't need to remember\na Fibonacci sequence for your test.\n\n466\n00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.023\nSo don't worry about that.\n\n467\n00:23:46.023 --> 00:23:51.377\nAnd, really, that just looks at the,\nsort of, the points, the story points\n\n468\n00:23:51.377 --> 00:23:56.830\nthat you might have for each individual\nstory and for each individual feature.\n\n469\n00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.953\nAnd take a look at your story points\nthere on the right-hand side.\n\n470\n00:23:59.953 --> 00:24:03.909\nIf you're estimating 100 story points,\nthen you need to split that down.\n\n471\n00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:04.447\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n472\n00:24:04.447 --> 00:24:05.943\n&gt;&gt; And you need to, what we call,\n\n473\n00:24:05.943 --> 00:24:07.150\nslice that story.\n\n474\n00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.630\nBut if you're estimating\nat one story point,\n\n475\n00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:15.020\nthen that's gotta be something that's\nreally, really, really simple to do.\n\n476\n00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.931\nAnd if one person's estimating a five and\none person's estimating a one, then,\n\n477\n00:24:19.931 --> 00:24:23.364\nas Rob says,\nthere's a huge disparity between the two.\n\n478\n00:24:23.364 --> 00:24:27.878\nAnd really what we wanna make sure that\nwe do is that we're accurate in our\n\n479\n00:24:27.878 --> 00:24:28.700\nestimates.\n\n480\n00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.705\nAnd so that's why Rob didn't believe you.\n\n481\n00:24:31.705 --> 00:24:35.835\n[LAUGH] It's not that we\ndon't trust your skills.\n\n482\n00:24:35.835 --> 00:24:39.419\nBut the reason why he [LAUGH] didn't\nbelieve you is because you came in at\n\n483\n00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:43.200\na one, which is probably about a couple\nof hours' worth of development.\n\n484\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.740\nAnd I'm looking at maybe five and\n\n485\n00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.666\nI'm thinking it's probably\na week's worth of development.\n\n486\n00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:51.014\nAnd that sounds, for what we're trying\nto do, we're trying to build an app,\n\n487\n00:24:51.014 --> 00:24:51.849\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n488\n00:24:51.849 --> 00:24:54.467\n&gt;&gt; I don't care how much of a wiz kid you\n\n489\n00:24:54.467 --> 00:24:58.139\nare, I'd like to see you\ndo it in that many hours.\n\n490\n00:24:58.139 --> 00:25:00.596\nOr we can use Ideal Days.\n\n491\n00:25:00.596 --> 00:25:05.646\nAnd ideal days, and what it says there,\nthey reflect the duration or\n\n492\n00:25:05.646 --> 00:25:12.000\nthe amount of time that you are going\nto be actually physically developing.\n\n493\n00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.380\nSecond bullet point down though says about\n\n494\n00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.680\ngetting development to\ncompletion with no distractions.\n\n495\n00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.660\nRemember our basic time management skills.\n\n496\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:27.210\nAnd our basic time management skills\nare really about understanding when\n\n497\n00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:29.730\nyour productive time is.\n\n498\n00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.380\nIt says they are complete\nwith no distractions.\n\n499\n00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.130\nWhen was the last time\nyou had a day without\n\n500\n00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.582\ndistractions?\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n501\n00:25:35.582 --> 00:25:36.191\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n502\n00:25:36.191 --> 00:25:37.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n503\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.976\n&gt;&gt; I've never had a day\n\n504\n00:25:37.976 --> 00:25:39.173\nwithout distractions either.\n\n505\n00:25:39.173 --> 00:25:44.220\nSo we've gotta think that an ideal\nday is a day where we don't have any\n\n506\n00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.820\ndistractions, and they don't happen.\n\n507\n00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:51.776\nSo most days are probably about\nthree-quarters of the day,\n\n508\n00:25:51.776 --> 00:25:53.630\nmaybe even half a day.\n\n509\n00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.720\nThe fourth bullet point down\nlooks at emphasizing that\n\n510\n00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.880\nideal days represent\neffort not elapsed time.\n\n511\n00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.670\nAn ideal day is a productive day.\n\n512\n00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:10.070\nSo one productive ideal day is\nprobably equivalent to two.\n\n513\n00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.170\nIt's probably equivalent to two days.\n\n514\n00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.770\nBecause, in reality, it's gonna be\ntwo half-days' worth of production,\n\n515\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.510\ncuz you might be disturbed for\nthe other half a day.\n\n516\n00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.185\nI mean, Rob,\nwho's one of our developers, bless him.\n\n517\n00:26:21.185 --> 00:26:23.889\nWhat did we just do to him?\n&gt;&gt; We disturbed him, Jo.\n\n518\n00:26:23.889 --> 00:26:24.994\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We disturbed him,\n\n519\n00:26:24.994 --> 00:26:25.730\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.810\n&gt;&gt; We kidnapped him and held him hostage.\n\n521\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.920\nBut we disturbed him.\n\n522\n00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.420\nAnd so, as a developer, it's very\ndifficult to say no, which is why we\n\n523\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.300\nsaid in a previous episode,\ndon't allow yourself to be distracted.\n\n524\n00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.520\nWe disturbed him, and we dragged him here,\nand we got him to show-\n\n525\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.662\n&gt;&gt; We really didn't ask, did we?\n\n526\n00:26:44.662 --> 00:26:47.000\n&gt;&gt; We kinda just kidnapped him, really,\n\n527\n00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.840\nand held him hostage.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n528\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.050\n&gt;&gt; What we also wanna make sure is that we\n\n529\n00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:58.430\nare consistent with our estimation of\nideal days across our projects as well.\n\n530\n00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:03.710\nWe've got to have the same unit\nof measure across our projects,\n\n531\n00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:09.680\nso that we know how long our projects\nare taking, across all of our projects.\n\n532\n00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.000\nAnd we've got that consistency.\n\n533\n00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.820\nWe've got a consistent approach with that.\n\n534\n00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.910\nSo we've mentioned backlogs already, and\n\n535\n00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.580\na backlog is what story points\nwe have left to complete.\n\n536\n00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:27.400\nAnd what we should ensure is that\nall of our backlogs adhere to, well,\n\n537\n00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.930\nDEEP, the DEEP acronym.\n\n538\n00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.600\nAnd DEEP stands for, as it says there,\nDetailed appropriately,\n\n539\n00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.090\nEstimated, Emergent and prioritized.\n\n540\n00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.460\nDetailed appropriately means\nwe've got enough information.\n\n541\n00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.420\nNot too much, remember, lean principles.\n\n542\n00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.480\nWe don't want to be estimating-\n&gt;&gt; Precise.\n\n543\n00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't wanna be precise,\n\n544\n00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.830\nit's an estimate.\n\n545\n00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:55.830\nAnd again, estimated, each story has got\nto have an estimate associated with it.\n\n546\n00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.520\nWhether it's based on Fibonacci sequence,\nwhich is exactly what we looked at with\n\n547\n00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.490\nRob, or whether it's based on ideal days,\neach story has to have an estimate.\n\n548\n00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.560\nAnd we have to be aware\nthat each story evolves.\n\n549\n00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:14.090\nAnd that means that we add in detail\nas we progress with the story.\n\n550\n00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:15.874\nIt's evolved, it's emerging.\n\n551\n00:28:15.874 --> 00:28:22.480\nAnd so we may not completely finish\nperhaps one story in an iteration.\n\n552\n00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.490\nAnd we'll make that decision that that\nstory then remains in the backlog and\n\n553\n00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:31.338\nmoves on to the next iteration\nat the end of that first one.\n\n554\n00:28:31.338 --> 00:28:32.974\nBut it's an evolved story.\n\n555\n00:28:32.974 --> 00:28:36.360\nIt's an emergent story, because\nwe've got more information with it.\n\n556\n00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.456\nAnd then, of course,\nall of our stories should be prioritized.\n\n557\n00:28:41.456 --> 00:28:44.794\nYeah, we know what we're\ngoing to deal with first and\n\n558\n00:28:44.794 --> 00:28:49.630\nwhat we should be dealing with second and\nthird and in each iteration, okay?\n\n559\n00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:55.640\nSo Iteration 0, that's our, well,\nthat's our initial iteration.\n\n560\n00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.910\nBut in iteration 0,\ndo we actually do any development work,\n\n561\n00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.265\ndo you think?\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n562\n00:29:01.265 --> 00:29:03.196\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n563\n00:29:03.196 --> 00:29:03.703\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n564\n00:29:03.703 --> 00:29:06.828\nlove it when you put me on the spot.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n565\n00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:10.478\n&gt;&gt; Iteration 0, I'm gonna go with no.\n\n566\n00:29:10.478 --> 00:29:13.070\nWe gotta plan before we can dive in there.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n567\n00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.300\niteration 0 is actually,\nit's kind of a misnomer.\n\n568\n00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.450\nIt's still an iteration.\n\n569\n00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:21.920\nIt's an iteration of the project,\nbut don't expect\n\n570\n00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.021\nany development work to be done.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n571\n00:29:25.021 --> 00:29:25.848\n&gt;&gt; It mentions on that\n\n572\n00:29:25.848 --> 00:29:29.259\nslide there limited development work,\nif there's any development, well,\n\n573\n00:29:29.259 --> 00:29:32.010\ndon't expect any development\nwork to be done in iteration 0.\n\n574\n00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.556\nIt really is about planning.\n\n575\n00:29:33.556 --> 00:29:35.781\nIt's about bringing your team together.\n\n576\n00:29:35.781 --> 00:29:38.902\nIt's about compiling all\nof your user stories and\n\n577\n00:29:38.902 --> 00:29:44.580\nensuring that we've got our user stories\nestimated and we've got them prioritized.\n\n578\n00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.997\nAnd this allows us to form iterations.\n\n579\n00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:52.943\nSo it allows us to look at our user\nstories and say, right, okay, well,\n\n580\n00:29:52.943 --> 00:29:55.490\nwe can group these\ntogether as iteration one.\n\n581\n00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.884\nAnd we can group these\ntogether as iteration two, and\n\n582\n00:29:58.884 --> 00:30:01.834\nthese stories can be\niteration three as well.\n\n583\n00:30:01.834 --> 00:30:06.386\nSo we want to actually scope\nour vision and our scope.\n\n584\n00:30:06.386 --> 00:30:11.860\nAnd we want to articulate our problems and\nour user stories in iteration zero.\n\n585\n00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:12.750\nSo this is our plan.\n\n586\n00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.120\nThis is kind of our admin iteration.\n\n587\n00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.780\nSome organizations don't\ncall them iteration at all.\n\n588\n00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.260\nSome organizations want to treat it\nas just part of project planning, and\n\n589\n00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.990\nthey'll call it project planning.\n\n590\n00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.401\nBut in Agile terms,\nwe call it iteration 0.\n\n591\n00:30:27.401 --> 00:30:30.176\nIt's our starting point, okay?\n\n592\n00:30:30.176 --> 00:30:33.936\nSo what we've done there is,\napart from drag Rob in,\n\n593\n00:30:33.936 --> 00:30:36.959\n[LAUGH] we've taken\na look at user stories.\n\n594\n00:30:36.959 --> 00:30:41.599\nAnd in our next episode, we're going to\nlook at prioritizing those users stories\n\n595\n00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:45.935\nand actually how we prioritize them and\nhow we come up with our iterations.\n\n596\n00:30:45.935 --> 00:30:46.665\n&gt;&gt; All right, perfect, Jo.\n\n597\n00:30:46.665 --> 00:30:49.135\nThank you for your time and\nyour time as well, but\n\n598\n00:30:49.135 --> 00:30:51.055\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n599\n00:30:51.055 --> 00:30:54.515\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock and\n\n600\n00:30:54.515 --> 00:30:56.340\nthat was Rob Mcgarry.\n\n601\n00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.566\nYeah, we gotta thank him also.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n602\n00:30:58.566 --> 00:31:02.874\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you next time guys, bye.\n\n603\n00:31:02.874 --> 00:31:08.723\n[MUSIC]\n\n604\n00:31:08.723 --> 00:31:13.455\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

[LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.190\n&gt;&gt; Slightly malnourished,\n\n18\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.688\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; We'll feed you after this\n\n19\n00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:49.314\nshow.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:50.897\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n21\n00:00:50.897 --> 00:00:55.880\nNo, but seriously, when we're talking\nabout stories, we looked at estimations,\n\n22\n00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.600\nbut how can we really tell which\nones are more important than others?\n\n23\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.540\nDo you have any suggestions?\n&gt;&gt; Well, we have a word for\n\n24\n00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.500\nthat, a special word and\nwe call that priority.\n\n25\n00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.670\n[LAUGH] So what we wanna do is we\nwanna prioritize our user stories.\n\n26\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.540\nAnd for any vision for any project\nitself we wanna make sure that we can\n\n27\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.420\nprioritize all of those user\nstories that we have collated.\n\n28\n00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.120\nSo yes, we do something with that,\nwe're not just gonna ignore them.\n\n29\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.510\nWe need to ensure that we use\nagile principles to prioritize.\n\n30\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.390\nWe don't wanna spend too long\nprioritizing our user's stories.\n\n31\n00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.480\nWe don't want to spend forever to\ntrying to evaluate those stories.\n\n32\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.733\nWe wanna make sure that,\n\n33\n00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:43.860\nin the same way that we did our estimation\nin our previous episode really quickly.\n\n34\n00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.150\nThat actually we use that\nestimation to help us prioritize.\n\n35\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.902\nPriority should be based on,\n\n36\n00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:52.267\nwhat do you think?\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n37\n00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:56.730\nsince I have been wrong like 75% in this\nseries, I am gonna go off the cusp here.\n\n38\n00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.399\nAnd in my opinion I think it should\nbe the amount, let me say this,\n\n39\n00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.340\nit's usually the amount of users affected.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n40\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.970\n&gt;&gt; And in turn, that usually equates to\n\n41\n00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.880\nROI or revenue produced.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n42\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.760\nwe normally base priorities on things\nlike impact and urgency for instance.\n\n43\n00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.620\nSo the impact is the amount\nof users that it affects or\n\n44\n00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.750\nthe impact of the organization and\nsuch as ROI, revenue, etc.\n\n45\n00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.230\nAnd also the urgency,\nhow quickly do we want it as well?\n\n46\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.320\nSo we have to make sure that we do\nprioritize all of our user stories.\n\n47\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.860\nAnd remember, that you can't do everything\nall at once, which is why we talk about\n\n48\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.200\nbringing in agile principles\njust to the prioritization.\n\n49\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.340\nBecause you can't do everything\nall at the same time.\n\n50\n00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.240\nAs much as we'd like to be able to, yeah,\n\n51\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.510\nwe wanna deliver all of the customer\nrequirements, all of, yeah, don't.\n\n52\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.430\nBut one thing at a time,\nagile is iterative.\n\n53\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.020\nIt's repeatable steps,\nit's producing these iterations, and\n\n54\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.308\nit's releasing one thing at a time.\n\n55\n00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:07.360\nBut we've gonna make sure that what\nwe're doing is we're delivering\n\n56\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.790\nin a way that the customer values.\n\n57\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.270\nAnd we are delivering the customer let's\nsay, the most valuable features first or\n\n58\n00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.850\nat least those features that we\nknow will make a huge difference or\n\n59\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.440\nimpact to the customer first.\n\n60\n00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.590\nSo the customer's really important\nin this prioritization, as well.\n\n61\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.960\nWhat do we need to do then\nto be able to prioritize?\n\n62\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.950\nWell, we've already talked\nabout impact and urgency.\n\n63\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.190\nWe need to be able to, well,\nwe talked about this in the last episode,\n\n64\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.210\nabout being objective when\nit came to our estimation.\n\n65\n00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.850\nWe've got to be objective when\nit comes to our priority.\n\n66\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.520\nYou don't bump something up into a high\npriority, or into a different iteration,\n\n67\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.410\nbecause the person that's asking for\nit happens to be your best friend.\n\n68\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.330\nAnd they're gonna buy you\na margarita a little bit later on.\n\n69\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.380\nBut that's not the reason why we do it.\n\n70\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.670\nWe have to have objectivity in there, but\nwe have to have empathy in there as well.\n\n71\n00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.880\nWe have to understand the customer,\nand understand the user.\n\n72\n00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.060\nYou can't just prioritize objectively\nwithout understanding what it\n\n73\n00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.550\nis that the customer wants to achieve.\n\n74\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.920\nThe customer may have a particular\nproblem, and we've got a lot of\n\n75\n00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.000\nuser stories that have been documented\nto resolve a particular problem.\n\n76\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.480\nBut you have to show empathy and\n\n77\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.460\nunderstanding, which one of those problems\nis actually more severe to the customer.\n\n78\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.190\nIt may not be the obvious one.\n\n79\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.290\nThe obvious issue there, and we used an\nexample previously about online shopping.\n\n80\n00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.654\nAnd about being able to do our\nonline shopping from wherever\n\n81\n00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:48.330\nwe are anywhere in well,\npotentially the world.\n\n82\n00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.367\nBut we're at work and\nwe want to do our online shopping and\n\n83\n00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:53.090\nhave our groceries delivered.\n\n84\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.468\nBut actually, that may not be our number\none priority, the number one priority to\n\n85\n00:04:57.468 --> 00:05:01.940\nour customer may be the protection of\ntheir credit card details for instance.\n\n86\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.770\nThat might be their number one priority,\nor\n\n87\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.730\ntheir number one priority\nmay be to ensure that\n\n88\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.299\nthe food that they buy is not damaged.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n89\n00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:14.755\nI think that also goes back to something\nyou had mentioned earlier on Jo.\n\n90\n00:05:14.755 --> 00:05:20.020\nWhen were looking at our company core\nvalues, our mission statement there,\n\n91\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.880\nso if our company is some kind of\ntrust company, maybe life insurance or\n\n92\n00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.430\nsomething like that.\n\n93\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.399\nThe basis of our organization, then yeah,\nthat should have hold a higher\n\n94\n00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:32.040\nweighted value.\n&gt;&gt; One,\n\n95\n00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.790\nthat's that first bullet\npoint right up there.\n\n96\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.150\nIt's that enterprise thinking,\n\n97\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.720\nit's about thinking about\nthe organization as a whole.\n\n98\n00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.680\nAnd not just thinking about\nthe ethics of the organization, but\n\n99\n00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.280\nthinking about how this particular story\nimpacts on the organization as a whole.\n\n100\n00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.770\nIs this something that's\nimportant to everybody, and\n\n101\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.700\nis this going to impact on everybody\neither in a positive or a negative way.\n\n102\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.500\nLet's face it, right?\n\n103\n00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.500\nWe're in development arena right now,\nand we know as a project team,\n\n104\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.210\nquite often we don't talk to\nother project teams doing.\n\n105\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.040\nWe don't think about\ndevelopment as a whole, and\n\n106\n00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.359\nthink about interacting\nbetween project teams.\n\n107\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.210\nAnd if we don't have any DevOps, and\n\n108\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.730\nwe don't bring our operations\nteam into our development arena.\n\n109\n00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.700\nWe don't involve them with testing, and\n\n110\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.550\nwe don't involve them too\nmuch with our transitions.\n\n111\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.295\nThen where are our relationships?\n\n112\n00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:27.500\nOur relationships are all within our team.\n\n113\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.270\nAnd if that's the case,\n\n114\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.728\nhow do we know if our development is\ngoing to impact on something else?\n\n115\n00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:36.730\nOr impact to have a detrimental impact\nto development of another project\n\n116\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.320\nfor instance?\n\n117\n00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.020\nSo you have to think, the organization\nas a whole, and you have to think about\n\n118\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.100\nall of the projects that we\nare developing, not just about our own.\n\n119\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.200\nSure, that's what we're concentrating on,\nbut you still should\n\n120\n00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.660\nhave that awareness of the rest of the\nenterprise, the rest of the organization.\n\n121\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.740\nYou don't walk around with blinkers on.\n\n122\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.370\nYou have to be aware of your surroundings,\nthis is what the enterprise thinking is\n\n123\n00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.970\nabout.\n&gt;&gt; Let me translate,\n\n124\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.390\nblinders.\n&gt;&gt; Blink,\n\n125\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.020\nthis is what a horse wears, right?\n&gt;&gt; Blinders.\n\n126\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.618\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, blinkers.\n\n127\n00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:13.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.000\n&gt;&gt; It's about communicating\n\n129\n00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.050\nin the language of the audience.\n\n130\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.240\nI'm communicating to my audience,\nyou can communicate to yours, and\n\n131\n00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.776\nwe'll be fine.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n132\n00:07:19.776 --> 00:07:22.687\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I also wanna mention here risk\n\n133\n00:07:22.687 --> 00:07:24.830\nidentification as well.\n\n134\n00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.290\nSo let me ask you another question,\n\n135\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.868\nbecause I like to put you on the spot.\n&gt;&gt; I know you do.\n\n136\n00:07:29.868 --> 00:07:31.273\n&gt;&gt; So now you try and embarrass me,\n\n137\n00:07:31.273 --> 00:07:33.360\nI'm gonna put you on the spot now.\n\n138\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.530\nSo when it comes to risk, do we want\nto address risk or mitigate risk?\n\n139\n00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.662\nThe biggest risk first or\ndo we want to tackle the small\n\n140\n00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:47.439\nrisk first?\n&gt;&gt; Hold\n\n141\n00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.275\non.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:50.018\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I have the answer, but\n\n143\n00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:51.710\nI wanna make sure that I'm not.\n\n144\n00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.960\nOkay, big risk first or small risk.\n\n145\n00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:01.122\nI'm going to go with our\nbig risk because If, yeah,\n\n146\n00:08:01.122 --> 00:08:06.342\nfinal answer, Alex, big risk.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know who Alex is but\n\n147\n00:08:06.342 --> 00:08:08.984\nshe's clearly forgotten my name anyway.\n\n148\n00:08:08.984 --> 00:08:10.414\nBut nevertheless,\n\n149\n00:08:10.414 --> 00:08:12.880\nwhy you looking at me like that?\n&gt;&gt; I'm\n\n150\n00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.770\nwaiting.\n&gt;&gt; I am not an Alex.\n\n151\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.880\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm like is it gonna be some crazy,\n\n152\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.790\ntwisted, Agile answer or\n\n153\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.870\nis it going to, cuz I do have\na bit of a different prospective.\n\n154\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.778\nSo I want to get your prospective, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; You can have my prospective as long as\n\n155\n00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:28.243\nyou don't call me Alex again.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:08:28.243 --> 00:08:30.276\n&gt;&gt; But the thing is that it really is down\n\n157\n00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:33.562\nto the organization,\nit's gonna be down to the customer.\n\n158\n00:08:33.562 --> 00:08:36.978\nAnd the customer's gotta help you set\nthose priorities, we're not gonna exclude\n\n159\n00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:40.189\nthe customer from that.\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz there are a lot of different\n\n160\n00:08:40.189 --> 00:08:43.100\nrisk matrices, or\nways that we can determine that.\n\n161\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.280\nAnd if it is lower hanging and\nsomething I can grab, but\n\n162\n00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.430\nthen again, you've got the other\nside of it where if it's huge,\n\n163\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.440\nlike personally identifiable\ninformation or something like that,\n\n164\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.600\nthen that's something we can't ignore.\n&gt;&gt; Well, the customer story that we’ve\n\n165\n00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.470\nbeen talking about so far is the ability\nto do our online grocery shopping,\n\n166\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.680\nand do it via an app on our mobile phone.\n\n167\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.800\nAnd so, there’s a risk involved in that,\n\n168\n00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.560\nin credit cards are a risk.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n169\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.790\n&gt;&gt; But there’s also a risk in getting\n\n170\n00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.560\ndamaged goods, we talked about getting\nthe wrong kind of toilet paper, or\n\n171\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.900\nmaybe even damaged avocados.\n\n172\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.674\nSo there are two risks that\nwe've identified there,\n\n173\n00:09:20.674 --> 00:09:22.349\nwhich risks do we tackle first?\n\n174\n00:09:22.349 --> 00:09:27.340\nBecause these are two potentially\ndifferent iterations.\n\n175\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.180\nSo which one do we tackle first?\n\n176\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.708\nDo we tackle credit card fraud or\ndo we tackle damaged fruit?\n\n177\n00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:34.561\nWell, you might think to yourself, okay,\n\n178\n00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:38.410\nthe biggest risk is the credit card fraud\nor the potential of credit card fraud.\n\n179\n00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.400\nSo do we tackle that one first?\n\n180\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.058\nWell, let's go and ask a customer.\n&gt;&gt;

Well,\n\n185\n00:09:50.201 --> 00:09:53.379\nit depends where you are in the world.\n\n186\n00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:56.515\nDoes escrow even exist elsewhere?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n187\n00:09:56.515 --> 00:09:57.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, one.\n\n188\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.071\n[LAUGH] But you see, the reason why\nI bring that in as an example is\n\n189\n00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:06.860\nbecause as a customer,\nthink about this as an external customer.\n\n190\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.790\nIf we're talking about avoiding credit\ncard fraud or we're avoiding damaged\n\n191\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.370\nfruit, what's the most important to\nthe business, to the organization?\n\n192\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.170\nThe credit card fraud they're going\nto list as their most important risk.\n\n193\n00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:20.818\nBut you know what?\n\n194\n00:10:20.818 --> 00:10:22.755\nTo me as an external customer,\n\n195\n00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:26.481\nthe biggest inconvenience to\nme is gonna be damaged fruit.\n\n196\n00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:29.474\nCuz my credit card company looks after\nthe credit card fraud for me and\n\n197\n00:10:29.474 --> 00:10:32.580\nif something happens, the credit\ncard company are gonna deal with it.\n\n198\n00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.290\nBut if I get damaged fruit week in,\nweek out, and my apples are all bruised,\n\n199\n00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.360\nI'm not gonna be happy and\nI'm not gonna use the service again.\n\n200\n00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.104\nSo that's actually going to be a risk\nto the organization in that they could\n\n201\n00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:47.171\nlose business.\n\n202\n00:10:49.308 --> 00:10:51.096\nWe'll go and ask our customers.\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Well, I mean,\n\n209\n00:10:59.571 --> 00:11:01.682\nit's a tough concept in\ngeneral to understand.\n\n210\n00:11:01.682 --> 00:11:06.840\nLike you said, it does boil down\nto every individual situation.\n\n211\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it really does.\n\n212\n00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:12.690\nWe've gotta think about how we're gonna\nprioritize, but we've not got to exclude\n\n213\n00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.780\nanything, no matter how sort of\nabsurd we might think it sounds.\n\n214\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.870\nWe've got to understand our customer,\nthat's why we talk about empathy.\n\n215\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.060\nWe've gotta understand our customer and\nwhat's important to them.\n\n216\n00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.685\nAnd what's important to them might not\nnecessarily be what's important to us.\n\n217\n00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:32.582\nIt's not down to us to assume.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I love that term empathy\n\n218\n00:11:32.582 --> 00:11:35.246\nbecause it's not the same as sympathy.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n219\n00:11:35.246 --> 00:11:37.189\n&gt;&gt; Sympathy, feeling sad for them,\n\n220\n00:11:37.189 --> 00:11:40.920\nempathy, trying to understand\nwhere they're coming from.\n\n221\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.410\n&gt;&gt;

On our imaginary phone, right?\n\n282\n00:15:07.986 --> 00:15:09.466\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so\n\n283\n00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:12.932\nwe have a hard dependency on an external.\n\n284\n00:15:12.932 --> 00:15:15.472\nAnd in this case, a third party provider,\n\n285\n00:15:15.472 --> 00:15:18.380\nit's an external provider completely,\nokay?\n\n286\n00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.350\nSo we have to understand\nall of our dependencies\n\n287\n00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.100\nin order to be able to help us\nprioritize our user stories.\n\n288\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.902\nBecause in that instance, and let's say\nthat we are delivering that functionality\n\n289\n00:15:29.902 --> 00:15:33.635\nthat's going to do the thumbprint or\nfingerprint recognition.\n\n290\n00:15:33.635 --> 00:15:38.533\nWould we put that as our first\nstory in our project if the handset\n\n291\n00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:42.046\nitself is not going to be released for,\nsay,\n\n292\n00:15:42.046 --> 00:15:46.910\nanother six months?\n&gt;&gt;

Well, it's gotta be objective.\n\n342\n00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.140\nAnd we've looked at all of the criteria,\n\n343\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.778\nand your organization will define\nthe criteria for prioritization.\n\n344\n00:17:28.778 --> 00:17:33.769\nSo it's gotta be an objective view on\nprioritization, but nevertheless, there\n\n345\n00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:38.160\ncan still be conflict and this is why-\n&gt;&gt; We know that, Jo.\n\n346\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.722\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is why you need,\n\n347\n00:17:39.722 --> 00:17:44.310\n[INAUDIBLE] your trained facilitator,\nbut you you need somebody to facilitate.\n\n348\n00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:49.080\nAnd you need somebody to agree and\ndecide on the priorities.\n\n349\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.050\nThat's gonna be your approach to owner.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n350\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, your\n\n351\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.510\nAgile coach is gonna help you facilitate.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n352\n00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.532\n&gt;&gt; But the product owner\n\n353\n00:17:56.532 --> 00:18:00.395\nis ultimately going to make the decision.\n&gt;&gt; The final decision, yeah, yeah.\n\n354\n00:18:00.395 --> 00:18:03.240\nI've got it.\n&gt;&gt; On the actual priorities themselves.\n\n355\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.180\nBut an Agile coach, that's that role\nthat's going to help you come in and say,\n\n356\n00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.050\nokay-\n&gt;&gt; Mediate.\n\n357\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:08.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n358\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.310\nyou need me to help you with this.\n\n359\n00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.760\nLet's facilitate a workshop.\n\n360\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.390\nLet's have a workshop.\n\n361\n00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.100\nAnd by the way, that workshop could\nbe by way of a very quick stand-up.\n\n362\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.510\nIt doesn't have to be\na form of sit-down meeting.\n\n363\n00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.270\nDon't forget,\nthe formality in everything else, well,\n\n364\n00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:29.760\nthat kind of adds in, well,\nI was gonna say the boring factor.\n\n365\n00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.102\nBut [LAUGH] it adds in more,\nI don't know, mundane sort of,\n\n366\n00:18:35.102 --> 00:18:40.070\nit kinda makes you feel run down,\ndoesn't it?\n\n367\n00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.621\nMeetings for the sake of having meetings.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n368\n00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.020\n&gt;&gt; We've all been to them.\n\n369\n00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.655\n&gt;&gt; I think you're gonna\n\n370\n00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:45.400\nmeeting someone to death.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n371\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.292\n&gt;&gt; What's the point of that?\n\n372\n00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so with any workshop,\n\n373\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.270\nit still needs a facilitator.\n\n374\n00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.890\nWe still need to have a purpose for\nthe workshop.\n\n375\n00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.650\nYeah, you don't just have\na meeting just for the sake of it,\n\n376\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:57.970\nthere has to be a purpose.\n\n377\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.520\nBut nevertheless, what we wanna do is\npinpoint those areas where's there been\n\n378\n00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.123\nsome sort of disagreement.\n\n379\n00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:07.790\nAnd we wanna work through\nthose disagreements.\n\n380\n00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.060\nAnd at the end of that workshop,\nwe wanna come out with our priority list.\n\n381\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.212\nSo now we're in iteration\nzero at the moment and\n\n382\n00:19:16.212 --> 00:19:19.470\nnow we have agreed on our user stories.\n\n383\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.453\nSo now what we've gotta is,\nand we've prioritized them,\n\n384\n00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:23.953\nwe've assessed them, etc.\n\n385\n00:19:23.953 --> 00:19:29.090\nNow we've got to agree which\nstories fit into which iteration.\n\n386\n00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.900\nBut of course,\nwe're gonna leave that one for\n\n387\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.500\nanother episode.\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Jo.\n\n388\n00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.830\nLet's go ahead and table this topic,\nam I allowed to say that?\n\n389\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.353\n&gt;&gt; No, no, please don't.\n\n390\n00:19:39.353 --> 00:19:40.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n391\n00:19:40.641 --> 00:19:43.190\n&gt;&gt; Don't, put it back on the story board.\n\n392\n00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:47.030\nNo, we're gonna table it, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But thank you so much, Jo.\n\n393\n00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.830\nAnd thank you guys for joining us too,\nbut let's go ahead and sign out.\n\n394\n00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.580\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:13.232\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\n\n5\n00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:15.635\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:17.335\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.883\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at iteration planning, and\n\n8\n00:00:20.883 --> 00:00:23.495\nwith us back in studios we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:24.455\nThanks for joining us, Jo.\n\n10\n00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:27.185\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am absolutely fine Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:29.935\nI'm slightly worried that\nyou said the word iteration,\n\n12\n00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:33.785\nso quickly that you might have set\nexpectations there that all of our\n\n13\n00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:37.110\niterations are gonna be that quick.\n&gt;&gt; Iteration.\n\n14\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.492\n&gt;&gt; Okay, they shouldn't be that slow.\n\n15\n00:00:39.492 --> 00:00:44.319\nIt kind of sounded like,\nhave you ever seen SpongeBob SquarePants\n\n16\n00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:46.703\nwhere he's like imagination?\n&gt;&gt; No\n\n17\n00:00:46.703 --> 00:00:47.691\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n18\n00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:48.983\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n19\n00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:49.778\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:53.221\n&gt;&gt; You got to say it iteration.\n\n21\n00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:55.125\n&gt;&gt; A lot of Cherokee's jokes just fall\n\n22\n00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.827\nflat over at this side of the table.\n&gt;&gt; I laugh, so\n\n23\n00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:00.260\nI'm okay with it.\n&gt;&gt; As long as she's\n\n24\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.000\nhappy.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.580\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of the approach we take.\n\n26\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the medication keeps me happy,\n\n27\n00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.090\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n\n28\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.450\nit's clearly not strong enough.\n\n29\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.160\nSo in this particular episode,\n\n30\n00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.810\nyeah, we're gonna be looking at\nthe iteration of an Agile project.\n\n31\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.440\nWe're also going to be referring to\nthese iterations as what we call\n\n32\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.830\ntimeboxes as well.\n\n33\n00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.637\nSo it's up to you as to what particular\nterminology you use within your\n\n34\n00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:26.950\norganization.\n\n35\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.376\nOne of the good things about Agile as\na methodology is that it doesn't matter or\n\n36\n00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:35.710\nas a concept it doesn't matter\nwhat methodology you use,\n\n37\n00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.370\nwhether it's Scrum, DSDM,\nwhether it's XP, we're going to\n\n38\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.325\nuse very similar terminology\nacross all of those methodologies.\n\n39\n00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:47.800\nBut if you wanna mix, and match your\napproaches, and you want to mix, and\n\n40\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.830\nmatch your definitions, and your\nterminology, then that's absolutely fine.\n\n41\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.560\nThere's no sort of hard, and fast rule for\nyou, there's no right or wrong as long\n\n42\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.120\nas we're following that Agile approach.\n&gt;&gt; So speaking of terminology,\n\n43\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.320\nwhat was that term you used,\nand do I need to know that for\n\n44\n00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.430\nthe exam?\n&gt;&gt; Well, your timebox?\n\n45\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.640\n&gt;&gt; Timebox, there we go.\n\n46\n00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.068\nI'm thinking of some kind\nof bomb of something.\n\n47\n00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:10.937\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you will need to know what\n\n48\n00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:11.774\na timebox is.\n\n49\n00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:14.725\nIt's just another word for an iteration.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n50\n00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:15.290\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n51\n00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.910\nif you're taking this particular\ncourse because you want to study for\n\n52\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.500\nyour Agile foundation class or\nyour Agile foundation test.\n\n53\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.635\nThen yes you would to\nknow what a timebox is.\n\n54\n00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:28.950\nTimebox is just another word for\nan iteration.\n\n55\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.190\nThis particular diagram,\n\n56\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.480\nwe're gonna look at a couple of times\nthroughout this particular episode.\n\n57\n00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.900\nAnd you'll see that,\nwhat we have right in front of us,\n\n58\n00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.700\nthe entire thing, iterations 1 through\nto iteration 6, that's our project.\n\n59\n00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.820\nBut what we have are two releases.\n\n60\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.210\nWe have R1 and R2, okay?\n\n61\n00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.245\nNow, release one contains four iterations.\n&gt;&gt; I see that.\n\n62\n00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:55.137\n&gt;&gt; And those iterations are the user\n\n63\n00:02:55.137 --> 00:02:56.070\nstories.\n\n64\n00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.470\nThey're the chunks of development,\nthat's our development work.\n\n65\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.616\nWe can also call that a timebox as well.\n\n66\n00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:03.790\nAnd of course,\nan iteration should be how long?\n\n67\n00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.321\nDo you remember?\n&gt;&gt; Up to four weeks.\n\n68\n00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, between one and four weeks.\n\n69\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.270\nAnd so, you can see in release one we've\ngot four iterations in that particular\n\n70\n00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.840\nrelease, and\nwe've got two iterations in release two.\n\n71\n00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.750\nThere's a common misconception that we\nshould be releasing every single iteration\n\n72\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.280\nas we've got it ready.\n\n73\n00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.330\nNo, once we've got the iteration ready,\nand it's complete, and we've checked its\n\n74\n00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.750\ndoneness, and we've got sign off on\nthe acceptance criteria, we don't go back.\n\n75\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.770\nAnd we don't reinvent the wheel,\nwe don't do any remedial action, we\n\n76\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.630\ndon't go back and revisit that iteration,\nwe move on to the next iteration.\n\n77\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.600\nBut we don't always release\nthat iteration immediately.\n\n78\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.940\nWe might bundle our iterations\ntogether to release them.\n\n79\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.920\nBecause at the end of the day,\n\n80\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.880\nwhat we're doing is delivering value\nto our customers and our users.\n\n81\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.680\nAnd we wanna make sure that we don't have\n\n82\n00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.130\ntoo many iterations or\ntoo many interruptions to them.\n\n83\n00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.770\nLet's think about our cellphone and\nour mobile phone.\n\n84\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.430\nIf each one of those iterations,\n1 through to iteration 4, if each\n\n85\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.170\none of those took a week, then we'd be\nupdating our cell phone every single week.\n\n86\n00:04:17.232 --> 00:04:19.210\nWe kinda get a little\nbit fed up with that.\n\n87\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.930\nSo what we're going to do is,\nwe'll bundle them all together, and\n\n88\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.390\nwe'll ensure that each release\nis conducted once a month.\n\n89\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.997\nSo we'll bundle those four together,\n\n90\n00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:33.380\nand we release those four\ntogether as one release.\n\n91\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.470\nThink about these as service packs.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n92\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.550\n&gt;&gt; Or think about this as maybe security\n\n93\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.048\nreleases or security updates,\nyou might want to bundle them together.\n\n94\n00:04:44.048 --> 00:04:49.430\nBut maybe iterations 5 and\n6 might take 4 weeks each, in which\n\n95\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.220\ncase then we're probably gonna bundle them\ntogether, and release them as release two.\n\n96\n00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.240\nIt's entirely up to you.\n\n97\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.360\nYou'll decide how many iterations or\n\n98\n00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.650\nhow many timeboxes you want\nto appear in each release.\n\n99\n00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.060\nAnd it's probably going to be\ndependent on things like priority, but\n\n100\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.200\nit's also gonna be dependent\non the time scale as well.\n\n101\n00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.290\nSo an iteration is just a timebox for\nproducing that increment, and\n\n102\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.280\nin Scrum, we refer to that as a sprint.\n\n103\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.260\nSo all our Agile methodologies, well,\nmost of them, are based on iterations.\n\n104\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.287\nAnd that's the way we work in Agile,\nis that we will release,\n\n105\n00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.921\nwe will certainly produce increments or\n\n106\n00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:37.430\niterations sort of in a period of one to\nfour weeks, as we've already talked about.\n\n107\n00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.400\nThe one thing that our iteration\nshould be is consistent in duration.\n\n108\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.190\nSo we don't want, one iteration of one\nweek, and then, the next one four weeks,\n\n109\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.100\nand the next one two weeks,\nand the next one four weeks.\n\n110\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.260\nWe want consistency.\n\n111\n00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.390\nIf we've got one or four weeks or one of\none week, and then, one of four weeks, and\n\n112\n00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.910\nthen, another one of one week,\nthen let's even out the stories.\n\n113\n00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.663\nAnd even out the stories within each\nincrement, so we've got one of two weeks,\n\n114\n00:06:01.663 --> 00:06:04.307\nanother one of two weeks, and\nanother one of two weeks.\n\n115\n00:06:04.307 --> 00:06:07.900\nYou we're gonna say something, Cherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm a little slow Jo,\n\n116\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.150\ncan we just back up for a second.\n\n117\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.142\nAnd I'm asking you to repeat what you said\nabout the sprint, so I just want to make\n\n118\n00:06:14.142 --> 00:06:18.588\nsure we're on the same page.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what I said about a sprint is\n\n119\n00:06:18.588 --> 00:06:23.820\nin Scrum we call an iteration a sprint.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n120\n00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.510\nour iteration is just that other word for\nthe timebox.\n\n121\n00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.130\nSo sprint timebox iteration-\n&gt;&gt; It means the same thing.\n\n122\n00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just want to make sure.\n\n123\n00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, means exactly the same thing.\n\n124\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.590\nAnd in terms of the exam itself,\nif you're doing the foundation exam\n\n125\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.790\nthen you're not going to be tested\non specific Scrum methodologies\n\n126\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.380\nbecause it's not a Scrum exam\nyou're doing, it's an Agile exam.\n\n127\n00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.500\nSo what we're doing is we're testing, and\n\n128\n00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.356\nright in this particular class we're\nlooking at the overall concept of Agile.\n\n129\n00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:58.523\nSo we're looking at, if we go back to\nepisode one in a series where we actually\n\n130\n00:06:58.523 --> 00:07:04.007\nhad a diagram where we looked at the fact\nthat Agile was an overarching methodology\n\n131\n00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:09.574\nor an overarching concept that included\nmethodology specific methodologies like\n\n132\n00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:13.800\nScrum, and XP and Kanban, and Lean etc.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n133\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.310\n&gt;&gt; So what we want then is for\n\n134\n00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:21.900\nconsistency, we want to have all of our\niterations roughly the same in duration.\n\n135\n00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.690\nWe accept that not every iteration's\ngonna be exactly the same length.\n\n136\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.460\nYou can't cuz it depends\nwhat stories we're covering.\n\n137\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.014\nYou can't guarantee that, I mean it's IT,\nwe don't like to guarantee too much in IT.\n\n138\n00:07:34.014 --> 00:07:34.816\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n139\n00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:37.622\n&gt;&gt; But we can't necessarily guarantee it,\n\n140\n00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:42.674\nbut we want to aim for consistency,\nbecause consistency will deliver us,\n\n141\n00:07:42.674 --> 00:07:48.226\nit'll manage expectations within our\nuser community, and with our customers.\n\n142\n00:07:48.226 --> 00:07:53.006\nIt also manages expectations in\nour development team as well,\n\n143\n00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:59.059\nin that we know that every two weeks we're\ngoing to be finalizing an iteration.\n\n144\n00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:00.182\nYou look perplexed by that.\n\n145\n00:08:00.182 --> 00:08:03.620\nYou don't like the idea of\nexpectation management?\n\n146\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.365\n&gt;&gt; No, I think it's great.\n\n147\n00:08:05.365 --> 00:08:07.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n148\n00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.520\nWhat are you trying to say then?\n\n149\n00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.320\nYou don't see it much in the real world?\n\n150\n00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.929\nCuz I think we do that.\n&gt;&gt; I just keep my expectations low,\n\n151\n00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:14.530\nso I'm always happy, right?\n\n152\n00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.920\nRemember, Jo, trying to stay happy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.120\nAnd that's what we wanna\ndo in development.\n\n154\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.632\nWe wanna keep our customers happy, but\npreferably not with medication that\n\n155\n00:08:24.632 --> 00:08:25.460\nCherokee's on.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n156\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.340\npreferably with realistic expectations,\nnot just\n\n157\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.460\nshooting below the belt every single time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n158\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.310\nthis is one of the things that when\nit comes to project management,\n\n159\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.455\nI have to say infuriates me,\nit really does frustrate me.\n\n160\n00:08:40.455 --> 00:08:45.750\nYou've to set realistic expectations,\nand if an increment, or\n\n161\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:52.410\nan iteration, if it's going to\ntake four weeks, don't write down,\n\n162\n00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:56.075\ndon't document that's its only going to\ntake 2 weeks, cuz that's not accurate.\n\n163\n00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:57.590\nWe've talked in the past about\n\n164\n00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.760\naccurate estimation.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n165\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.072\n&gt;&gt; And it's not accurate,\n\n166\n00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:05.550\nwe want to be within tolerances, and\nwe want to make sure that we're accurate.\n\n167\n00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.120\nAnd don't say that it's gonna be two\nweeks just because you wanna tick a box,\n\n168\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.840\njust because you got a milestone\nthat you want to achieve or\n\n169\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.570\nyou want to adhere to some, you want\nto adhere to some policy or other.\n\n170\n00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:22.110\nBe accurate and you've got to\nbe objective about it as well.\n\n171\n00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.210\n&gt;&gt; Just from experience,\n\n172\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.332\nI know you've been on the other,\nthe flip side of that.\n\n173\n00:09:25.332 --> 00:09:32.240\nIf I extended my duration, and I was\nkind of like fluffing that a little bit,\n\n174\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.119\nso I could give myself,\nI don't know, downtime or something.\n\n175\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.440\nWhat?\n&gt;&gt; I'm shaking my head at you because now\n\n176\n00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.580\nwe're fluffing our way through projects.\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, that's what I'm saying.\n\n177\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.120\nThat's something you\ndefinitely don't wanna do\n\n178\n00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.880\nbecause-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n179\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.250\n&gt;&gt; If I come in two weeks\n\n180\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.990\nearlier than my projected completion date,\nthat's gonna raise a lot of questions.\n\n181\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.340\nWell, why are you not able to\nhave an accurate estimation?\n\n182\n00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.892\nDid you skimp on something like quality,\nor did we\n\n183\n00:09:59.892 --> 00:10:04.610\njust completely leave something out?\n&gt;&gt; You know the worst effect that it's\n\n184\n00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.090\nactually going to have?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n185\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:07.810\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n186\n00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.430\n&gt;&gt; Apart from make me angry?\n\n187\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.310\nThe worst effect that it's\nactually going to have is that,\n\n188\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:17.590\nwhen it comes to the next iteration,\nhow much trust do you think the product\n\n189\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.900\nowner is going to put in your estimations?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not so much.\n\n190\n00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.580\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean,\n\n191\n00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.532\nwe've already demonstrated in\nthe previous episode, right?\n\n192\n00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:25.438\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My estimations\n\n193\n00:10:25.438 --> 00:10:28.625\nwere already way off, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nobody trusts her.\n\n194\n00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:31.625\n[LAUGH] Okay, this point in time,\nwe know this.\n\n195\n00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:35.700\nYou're just really digging\nyourself a deeper hole again,\n\n196\n00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.540\ndon't do it.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm known for Jo.\n\n197\n00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.630\nNo shame in the game.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n198\n00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.540\nwe're going to have to do something\nwith this, we're taking this offline.\n\n199\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.290\n[LAUGH] But yeah, we've got to make\nsure that our estimations are accurate.\n\n200\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.530\nYou've got to, this is your credibility,\nbut it's not just your credibility.\n\n201\n00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.810\nIt's the credibility of the team as well.\n\n202\n00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.410\nAnd it's also,\nthe credibility of the project.\n\n203\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:04.220\nIf we don't deliver what we have\ncommitted to delivering with our users,\n\n204\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.940\nthen IT as a whole,\n\n205\n00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.410\nand product development as a whole,\nwell, we damage our credibility.\n\n206\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:15.720\nAnd quite soon our users will be thinking\nabout going elsewhere when it comes to\n\n207\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.150\nproduct development.\n\n208\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.630\nAnd who could blame them,\nif they can't trust what we're saying?\n\n209\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.050\nSo be accurate, as accurate as you can.\n\n210\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.549\nWhich means that with every iteration\nwe've got to specify the final\n\n211\n00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:28.400\nrequirements.\n\n212\n00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.940\nWe've got to understand\nwith each iteration,\n\n213\n00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.000\nthis is the time when we've\ngot to start documenting,\n\n214\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.470\nwhen we've got to start defining exactly\nwhat it is we're going to deliver.\n\n215\n00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.850\nWe're designing at this point.\n\n216\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.210\nUp until now, we've had very,\nvery high level expectations.\n\n217\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.960\nWe've given a rough estimate of\nexactly how long we expect each\n\n218\n00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.420\nparticular functionality to take us.\n\n219\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.600\nAnd we've estimated on various\nthings including the time,\n\n220\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.735\nand including the amount of\nresources that we would need.\n\n221\n00:12:02.735 --> 00:12:05.880\nNow's the time when we plan.\n\n222\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.810\nAnd this is important, we've only\ngot between one and four weeks, so\n\n223\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.710\nlet's say we've got two weeks.\n\n224\n00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.950\nWe've got 2 weeks.\n\n225\n00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.700\nSo now, we start to do, and\nyes we've done a lot of\n\n226\n00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.698\nthe planning in iteration zero, but\nthis is the detailed stuff right now.\n\n227\n00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:25.348\nSo now, we start talking about these\ndaily stand up meetings that we have been\n\n228\n00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:27.781\ntalking about in every single episode so\n\n229\n00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:28.480\nfar.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n230\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these daily stand up meetings,\n\n231\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.130\nwhere what happens in\na daily stand up Cherokee?\n\n232\n00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.694\nYou've heard it 50 times.\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n233\n00:12:34.694 --> 00:12:35.570\nI should know this by now.\n\n234\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:40.990\nYes, so we're gonna discuss any challenges\nor obstacles as well as any kind of\n\n235\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.520\nprojects that we might be proud of, like\naccomplishments that we just recently did.\n\n236\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.010\nAnd I feel like I'm missing one more\nthing, but I think that's good.\n\n237\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.414\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, we outline our plan for\n\n238\n00:12:50.414 --> 00:12:52.180\nthe day.\n&gt;&gt; Plan for the day.\n\n239\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.209\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kinda the important bit.\n\n240\n00:12:54.209 --> 00:12:57.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I do this every day.\n\n241\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.335\nSo you would think I would know.\n\n242\n00:12:59.335 --> 00:13:00.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna stand here,\n\n243\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.540\nand roll my eyes.\n\n244\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.490\nA stand up meeting,\nwe will outline our plan for the day.\n\n245\n00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.030\nThat's the important bit.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n246\n00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.750\n&gt;&gt; And then, we discuss any obstacles that\n\n247\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:15.430\nwe may have, and we also, will give a\nquick recap on what we achieved yesterday.\n\n248\n00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.730\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember what my plan for the\n\n249\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.302\nday was today from this morning's meeting?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n250\n00:13:19.302 --> 00:13:20.937\nWere you gonna sing Sesame Street or\n\n251\n00:13:20.937 --> 00:13:23.370\nsomething like that?\n&gt;&gt; No, that was yesterday.\n\n252\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n253\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.495\n&gt;&gt; I had to deal with caffeine.\n\n254\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.040\n&gt;&gt; You had to deal with caffeine.\n\n255\n00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.835\n&gt;&gt; That's part of my plan for\n\n256\n00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:31.827\ntoday.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n257\n00:13:31.827 --> 00:13:33.387\n&gt;&gt; Keeping up my caffeine levels.\n\n258\n00:13:33.387 --> 00:13:34.789\n&gt;&gt; She's had way too much.\n\n259\n00:13:34.789 --> 00:13:37.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've exceeded my daily goal,\n\n260\n00:13:37.035 --> 00:13:38.900\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; She exceeded that expectation,\n\n261\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.235\nand that was really bad estimate, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:41.235 --> 00:13:46.387\nA really bad estimate, and maybe in\ntomorrow's stand up meeting, then maybe we\n\n263\n00:13:46.387 --> 00:13:50.878\ncan review that as being poorly estimated.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I need to have a more accurate\n\n264\n00:13:50.878 --> 00:13:53.210\nestimation for tomorrow's stand up?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n265\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.899\nWhich we've have already discussed\nthat estimation is based on previous\n\n266\n00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:57.760\nhistory.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n267\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Your previous history tells me that you\n\n268\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.650\nshouldn't be trusted to estimate.\n\n269\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.606\nAnd Rob came in a previous episode, and\nthat also told me that you can't be\n\n270\n00:14:04.606 --> 00:14:07.454\ntrusted to estimate.\n&gt;&gt; Another corroborating this story, yeah.\n\n271\n00:14:07.454 --> 00:14:09.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep.\n\n272\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.620\nYeah we know, we've got your number.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.980\n&gt;&gt; So this is what happens in\n\n274\n00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.740\nthe daily stand up.\n\n275\n00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.550\nHow long should a daily stand up be?\n&gt;&gt; Less than 15 minutes.\n\n276\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.180\n&gt;&gt; Yay, which is why if your team is\n\n277\n00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.770\nabsolutely huge, you're gonna\nhave challenges achieving that.\n\n278\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:29.000\nSo you have to consider the relevance\nof the people that are in the stand up.\n\n279\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.696\nAnd what their contribution\nis to that iteration, and\n\n280\n00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:33.808\nto that particular project as a whole.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n281\n00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:37.992\nyou're saying I'm allowed to judge people.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n282\n00:14:37.992 --> 00:14:39.708\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:14:39.708 --> 00:14:41.497\n&gt;&gt; We do consider that relevant.\n\n284\n00:14:41.497 --> 00:14:43.352\nWe don't necessarily judge-\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm just joking.\n\n285\n00:14:43.352 --> 00:14:46.490\n&gt;&gt; I mean, if you're gonna do something\n\n286\n00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.840\nlike that, can you please make\nsure you keep it to yourself?\n\n287\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.660\nKinda doesn't do much for the teamwork.\n\n288\n00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.392\nCollaboration-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's that.\n\n289\n00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.932\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so again here,\n\n290\n00:14:55.932 --> 00:15:02.190\nright at the start of the increment,\nthis is where we define the doneness.\n\n291\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.390\nThis is a term that\nwe've mentioned before.\n\n292\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.370\nAnd the doneness is slightly\ndifferent to the acceptance criteria.\n\n293\n00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.738\nThe acceptance criteria is\nactually user signing off.\n\n294\n00:15:12.738 --> 00:15:13.272\n&gt;&gt; Signing off.\n\n295\n00:15:13.272 --> 00:15:15.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's when we sign off.\n\n296\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.200\nBut doneness is that point where we say,\nokay, we've achieved this,\n\n297\n00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.780\ncan we actually sign off now?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n298\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.770\n&gt;&gt; So with every iteration,\n\n299\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.330\nthen we have specific rules\nwith every iteration.\n\n300\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.940\nIt's at this point in time,\nCherokee doesn't like scope creep, right?\n\n301\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.934\nShe doesn't want that.\n&gt;&gt; We've established that.\n\n302\n00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.198\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but then, and\n\n303\n00:15:36.198 --> 00:15:40.905\nI always tell you that for every single\niteration, it's not cast in stone or for\n\n304\n00:15:40.905 --> 00:15:44.260\nevery project it's not.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we don't use that term here.\n\n305\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.760\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n306\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.120\nBut you know what?\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n307\n00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.423\n&gt;&gt; Now it is.\n\n308\n00:15:48.423 --> 00:15:48.989\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n309\n00:15:48.989 --> 00:15:51.514\n&gt;&gt; Yep, we're planning our iteration or\n\n310\n00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:52.362\nour sprint.\n\n311\n00:15:52.362 --> 00:15:56.201\nAnd now, this is where It's cast in stone.\n\n312\n00:15:56.201 --> 00:15:59.712\nWe don't make any changes that\nare going to affect that iteration.\n\n313\n00:15:59.712 --> 00:16:04.880\nRemember that iterations,\ntwo weeks, four weeks, yeah?\n\n314\n00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.900\nWe've got to, at some point in time,\nwe've got to draw a line under it and\n\n315\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.230\nsay right, this is what we're building.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n316\n00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.340\n&gt;&gt; This is why once that backlog\n\n317\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.740\nis agreed, in other words,\nonce it's been agreed,\n\n318\n00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.480\nwhat stories we're going to develop and\n\n319\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.030\nonce we've decided how quickly we're going\nto get this situation out, that's it.\n\n320\n00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.450\nAnd the team doesn't get\nchanged at this point.\n\n321\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.140\nWe can't change the quality.\n\n322\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.960\nWe can't change the scope.\n\n323\n00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.130\nWe can reclarify it okay.\n\n324\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:39.860\nWe can ask for clarification but\nat this point in time we're agreeing it.\n\n325\n00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.660\nThat's what happens right now.\n\n326\n00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.460\nCuz at some point in time,\nwe've gotta draw a line under it, okay?\n\n327\n00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.780\nI know that I said-\n&gt;&gt; I agree.-\n\n328\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Adapted to change,\n\n329\n00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.900\nbut you know let's be realistic,\nwe've got to develop something.\n\n330\n00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.190\n&gt;&gt; That's what my first thought,\n\n331\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:59.090\nthat was just and that's only because I've\nbeen in situations where I just kind of,\n\n332\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.310\nI'm a big proponent of contracts and\nstatement of work, so\n\n333\n00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.400\nI can get it in writing, so\n\n334\n00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.440\nI know where that end in sight is.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n335\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.810\nthen we don't mind contracts and\nstatement of work as long\n\n336\n00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.510\nas they're a little bit flexible.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n337\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.230\n&gt;&gt; Because then-\n\n338\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.325\n&gt;&gt; I can be flexible, Jo.\n\n339\n00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:16.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n340\n00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.800\nbut just remember our agile values, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n341\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n342\n00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.440\nthere's nothing wrong with contracts,\nbut sometimes they're too rigid, and\n\n343\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.310\nyou just can't move from those contracts.\n\n344\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.330\nOkay, so think about velocity then,\nnow we're gonna get into some math.\n\n345\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.330\nAnd by the way,\n\n346\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.220\nwhen it comes to your test you're not\ngonna be given a calculation, all right?\n\n347\n00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.590\nSo don't worry about this,\nit does make sense.\n\n348\n00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.900\nBut the next few slides yeah we're\ngonna be talking about doing\n\n349\n00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.300\nsome calculations here on how\nquickly we can deliver something.\n\n350\n00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.330\nAnd so we call that velocity.\n\n351\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.940\nAnd velocity is the amount of\nwork the team can accomplish.\n\n352\n00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.450\nNow we're only going to calculate\nvelocity on whole stories.\n\n353\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.128\nBut exactly what I've just\nsaid right now which was,\n\n354\n00:18:03.128 --> 00:18:05.750\nwe're gonna have some fun with this.\n\n355\n00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.082\nAnd there's some calculation.\n\n356\n00:18:07.082 --> 00:18:11.630\nIt tells you that newly formed\nteams can struggle with this.\n\n357\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.610\nIt's a calculation.\n\n358\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.370\nAnd until you know really\nwhat you're doing,\n\n359\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.170\nuntil you've done it quite a few times,\nit can be a challenge.\n\n360\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.740\nSo we might, existing teams use\npast performance to help them.\n\n361\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.160\nBut they also know how to calculate\nit because they've done it before.\n\n362\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.797\nYou can use it, can calculate\nvelocity using your story points or\n\n363\n00:18:32.797 --> 00:18:34.493\nyou can use ideal days.\n\n364\n00:18:34.493 --> 00:18:37.044\nAnd in this calculation\nthat we've got right now,\n\n365\n00:18:37.044 --> 00:18:40.450\nwe're gonna use sort of a mixture of both.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n366\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.980\n&gt;&gt; So, Rob came in.\n\n367\n00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.020\nIf you remember, in our last episode,\n\n368\n00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.990\nwe kinda have one of those wonderful\nTV moments where as if by magic,\n\n369\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.145\nsomebody just appears.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:18:49.145 --> 00:18:50.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n371\n00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.910\nthen we kinda did some rock,\npaper, scissors.\n\n372\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.800\nAnd then, as if by magic again,\nhe just disappeared.\n\n373\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.580\n&gt;&gt; Vanished.\n\n374\n00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it wasn't even in a puff of\n\n375\n00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:57.760\nsmoke, was it?\n\n376\n00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.810\nThere was no drama about it, he just went.\n\n377\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.120\nYou will remember that when we were\ndoing our rock, paper, scissors and\n\n378\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.080\nwe were doing our\ncalculation on estimation.\n\n379\n00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.270\nWhat we're struggling to\nunderstand what points or\n\n380\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.740\nhow we were allocating-\n&gt;&gt; Our scale.\n\n381\n00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.240\n&gt;&gt; Our estimate, yeah, our scale.\n\n382\n00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.740\nAnd that's because we hadn't\ngotten to that point yet.\n\n383\n00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.870\nAnd there was no point in\ntrying to bring that in\n\n384\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.600\nat that particular point\nin time in that episode.\n\n385\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.300\nCuz I knew that we were\ngonna get to it here.\n\n386\n00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.590\n&gt;&gt; So Rob mentioned a Fibonacci scale.\n\n387\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:40.090\nAnd we will use a Fibonacci scale\nto give our stories points,\n\n388\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:44.170\nbased on the degree of difficulty.\n\n389\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.760\nSo that's how we evaluate our stories\nin terms of sort of priority,\n\n390\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.200\nand their estimation on sort\nof the degree of difficulty.\n\n391\n00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:58.910\nAnd the third bullet point down tells you\nthat the estimated velocity is the sum of\n\n392\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:04.414\nthe total story points in any iteration.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n393\n00:20:04.414 --> 00:20:05.072\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n394\n00:20:05.072 --> 00:20:11.730\nnow you don't want to have too\nmany stories in any iteration.\n\n395\n00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.720\nYou really don't.\n\n396\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.066\nYou want to try to make\nit as simple as possible.\n\n397\n00:20:15.066 --> 00:20:18.000\nRemember, keep it simple okay.\n\n398\n00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.060\nAnd so this is our measurement of unit,\nand if I could just take a look at all\n\n399\n00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.770\nthose yellow sticky notes that we have\nthere you'll see that each one of those\n\n400\n00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.750\nstories these are story paths, remember.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n401\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.540\n&gt;&gt; And each one of those stories have got\n\n402\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.597\na number attached to them.\n&gt;&gt; Story point.\n\n403\n00:20:36.597 --> 00:20:39.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so our velocity for\n\n404\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.520\nthat sprint or for that iteration\nis gonna be 28 story points,\n\n405\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.120\ncuz that's all of those added together.\n\n406\n00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.390\nYeah, we all right?\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.\n\n407\n00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.360\n&gt;&gt; You can do the math.\n\n408\n00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.480\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think real quick and\n\n409\n00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.730\nI'm like, okay, yeah, I believe you Jo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is, we've got 28 story\n\n410\n00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.510\npoints for that particular iteration cuz\nthat's how many stories we're covering.\n\n411\n00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.810\nAnd we're covering six\nstories in that iteration.\n\n412\n00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.550\nI see you trying to work it out again.\n&gt;&gt; I believe you.\n\n413\n00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just trust me.\n\n414\n00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:10.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n415\n00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.050\n&gt;&gt; So now what we're going to do then,\n\n416\n00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:17.200\nwe can use that to calculate our velocity.\n\n417\n00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.330\nAnd our velocity there is 28, it's 28\nbased on 28 story points per iteration.\n\n418\n00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.120\nThat's all we can achieve.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n419\n00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.580\n&gt;&gt; The other way of doing this,\n\n420\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.980\nis to do it via ideal days.\n\n421\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.810\nDo you remember what an ideal day was?\n\n422\n00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.150\n&gt;&gt; One.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n423\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.990\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I held up one finger and\n\n424\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.450\nI said one day.\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n425\n00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.340\nwhat is the definition of an ideal day?\n\n426\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.630\nMan, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.420\n&gt;&gt; I might need to refer back to\n\n428\n00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.874\nthe expert on this.\n&gt;&gt; An ideal day is the amount of time that\n\n429\n00:21:46.874 --> 00:21:49.310\nwe're productive during the day.\n\n430\n00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n431\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n432\n00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.490\n&gt;&gt; So the ideal day is when-\n\n433\n00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.510\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I couldn't remember that because\n\n434\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.790\nI have exceeded my ideal production for\nthe day.\n\n435\n00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, is that what it is?\n\n436\n00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:08.700\nSo we'll do is we will work out\nexactly how productive we are per day.\n\n437\n00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.250\nSo in the example on the right hand side,\nyou'll see that we've got 6 people in our\n\n438\n00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.900\nteam, one of them is only half-time or\nhalf, you know, they're part time.\n\n439\n00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.951\nSo we've really got five and\n\n440\n00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:21.606\na half people per day.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n441\n00:22:21.606 --> 00:22:24.135\n&gt;&gt; We've got 4 weeks in any\n\n442\n00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:25.982\ngiven iteration\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n443\n00:22:25.982 --> 00:22:31.017\nyou're including the entire productivity\nideal day for each team member.\n\n444\n00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:31.928\n&gt;&gt; Right hang on.\n\n445\n00:22:31.928 --> 00:22:32.921\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n446\n00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:34.151\n&gt;&gt; We're not there yet,\n\n447\n00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:34.927\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n448\n00:22:34.927 --> 00:22:36.467\n&gt;&gt; So you've got 6 people,\n\n449\n00:22:36.467 --> 00:22:40.527\nand we've got one who's only part time so\nwe've got 5.5 people.\n\n450\n00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:41.048\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n451\n00:22:41.048 --> 00:22:44.654\n&gt;&gt; We'll give an iteration of say 4 weeks.\n\n452\n00:22:44.654 --> 00:22:50.670\nBut we're going to estimate that\nwe've got a discount rate in here.\n\n453\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:58.540\nAnd the discount rate is how much time in\na percentage that we are not productive.\n\n454\n00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.080\nSo that's 50.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n455\n00:22:59.080 --> 00:22:59.690\n&gt;&gt; In other words,\n\n456\n00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:04.280\nhalf of our time is not productive.\n&gt;&gt; It seems a little high, is that normal?\n\n457\n00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.050\n&gt;&gt; It's actually quite\n\n458\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.410\naccurate.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n459\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:07.060\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or\n\n460\n00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.580\nnot we're not productive for\nabout 50% of the day.\n\n461\n00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.276\nBy the time we take in breaks,\nby the time we have lunch breaks, and\n\n462\n00:23:13.276 --> 00:23:16.520\nthen by the time we have meetings and\ndisturbances, etc.\n\n463\n00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.586\nWe're actually only productive, for the\nmost part, unless you lock yourself away,\n\n464\n00:23:20.586 --> 00:23:23.230\nyou´re generally unproductive for\nhalf the day.\n\n465\n00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.850\nHow many times do you get distracted\nby social media or things like\n\n466\n00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:32.163\nthat during the day?\n&gt;&gt; An unnecessary amount,\n\n467\n00:23:32.163 --> 00:23:35.665\nI don´t know.\n&gt;&gt; Again it's another one of these\n\n468\n00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:39.285\nconcepts where we'll say to you,\nbe realistic about this,\n\n469\n00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:40.795\nbe objective about this.\n\n470\n00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.291\nDon't-\n&gt;&gt; Sugar coat it.\n\n471\n00:23:42.291 --> 00:23:44.422\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's no point in trying to\n\n472\n00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:49.021\npretend that you're going to be productive\nfor say 75% of the day, because you\n\n473\n00:23:49.021 --> 00:23:53.567\nare not, and what is gonna happen is you\ngonna end up with inaccurate estimates.\n\n474\n00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:54.269\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n475\n00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:56.243\n&gt;&gt; And then inaccurate prediction.\n\n476\n00:23:56.243 --> 00:24:01.036\nAnd you're gonna predict to say\ndo 15 stories when actually you\n\n477\n00:24:01.036 --> 00:24:02.614\ncan achieve 1 or 2.\n\n478\n00:24:02.614 --> 00:24:06.758\nAll right, so we've gotta be accurate\nbecause if you're not accurate and\n\n479\n00:24:06.758 --> 00:24:10.308\nyou're not objective about how\nmuch of your day is productive,\n\n480\n00:24:10.308 --> 00:24:12.628\nthen you miss setting the expectations.\n\n481\n00:24:12.628 --> 00:24:13.251\nRight?\nAnd\n\n482\n00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:17.080\nthat doesn't do good from value\nperception and for value delivery.\n\n483\n00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:24.470\nSo if we're only then accurate for 50%\nof our day, then our estimated velocity,\n\n484\n00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:29.390\nif I can pronounce it,\nis 5.5 people multiplied by\n\n485\n00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:35.220\n4 weeks multiplied by 5,\ncuz there's 5 working days in a week.\n\n486\n00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.212\nBut multiply that by 0.5,\n\n487\n00:24:37.212 --> 00:24:40.097\nbecause we're only productive for-\n&gt;&gt; 50%.\n\n488\n00:24:40.097 --> 00:24:40.720\n&gt;&gt; Half of the day.\n\n489\n00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.786\nAnd that gives us 55 ideal days.\n\n490\n00:24:43.786 --> 00:24:48.084\nThat means that we've got\n55 working days from that\n\n491\n00:24:48.084 --> 00:24:51.053\nparticular project team per month.\n\n492\n00:24:51.053 --> 00:24:54.790\nThat's a four-week period, so\nper four-week period, okay?\n\n493\n00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.630\nSo that would be our velocity.\n\n494\n00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:01.130\nAnd then we use that to help us\ncalculate how many stories we can\n\n495\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.900\nget into that velocity.\n\n496\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.220\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n497\n00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.780\nSo it actually makes sense.\n\n498\n00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.710\nIt is a bit of a calculation.\n\n499\n00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.560\nIt's also a little bit of\na rough estimate too and\n\n500\n00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.380\nI think I said on a previous slide,\na brand new team\n\n501\n00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.220\nthat's just been formed is gonna\nfind it difficult to calculate this.\n\n502\n00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.239\nBecause you always like to think\nyou can achieve more than you can.\n\n503\n00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:23.732\n&gt;&gt; Well, we know that.\n\n504\n00:25:23.732 --> 00:25:25.417\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, right, right.\n\n505\n00:25:25.417 --> 00:25:29.840\n[LAUGH] Okay, yeah, you always like to\nthink that you know more than you can.\n\n506\n00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.960\nAnd I don't know who you're\ntrying to prove it to.\n\n507\n00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.940\nWhether it's to yourself or whether it's\nto I don't know maybe a scrum master or\n\n508\n00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.942\nthe product owner.\n\n509\n00:25:36.942 --> 00:25:39.999\nHey, look at me,\nI'm more productive than I think, and\n\n510\n00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:43.758\nthe reality of the situation is that\nyou get into it with enthusiasm and\n\n511\n00:25:43.758 --> 00:25:47.071\nyou may be really productive at\nthe start at that iteration but\n\n512\n00:25:47.071 --> 00:25:51.045\nthen as the iteration moves on,\nthen that productivity might just wane.\n\n513\n00:25:51.045 --> 00:25:54.620\nSo be realistic.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n514\n00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.297\n&gt;&gt; So that's our iteration, so\n\n515\n00:25:56.297 --> 00:26:00.128\nwe've already actually covered\nthe release and what a release is.\n\n516\n00:26:00.128 --> 00:26:04.944\nAnd a release is what we choose\nto release at that point in time.\n\n517\n00:26:04.944 --> 00:26:10.882\nAnd it can be one iteration or\nit can be up to four or five iterations.\n\n518\n00:26:10.882 --> 00:26:14.008\nOkay?\nIt just says simply that a release\n\n519\n00:26:14.008 --> 00:26:16.810\ncontains one or more iterations.\n\n520\n00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.410\nYou make that decision,\nwe can't make that decision for you.\n\n521\n00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.810\nYou'll make that decision.\n\n522\n00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.090\nBut what you must do is\nyou must plan the release.\n\n523\n00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.609\nWhen do you think you plan the release?\n&gt;&gt; When\n\n524\n00:26:32.609 --> 00:26:37.865\nyou're planning your iteration.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n525\n00:26:37.865 --> 00:26:39.008\n&gt;&gt; Hold on, let me.\n\n526\n00:26:39.008 --> 00:26:40.550\n&gt;&gt; Take a look at that bottom bullet point\n\n527\n00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.720\non the screen in front of you.\n&gt;&gt; Release plans for immediate future\n\n528\n00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.410\nare more accurate, release plans for\nthe immediate future are more accurate.\n\n529\n00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.470\nFarther out the release.\n\n530\n00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.800\nSo immediate future,\nwhat would classify as immediate future?\n\n531\n00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that would be your iteration.\n\n532\n00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.480\nSo if your release has only got, say,\nfor instance, one iteration in it.\n\n533\n00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.600\nAnd I'm going back to this example here.\n\n534\n00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.500\nIf your release has only\ngot one iteration in it,\n\n535\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.580\nthen your release plan is\ngoing to be very accurate.\n\n536\n00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.438\nBut let's say your release has\ngot four iterations in it.\n\n537\n00:27:12.438 --> 00:27:14.784\nFour times four weeks,\n&gt;&gt; Right, release one pass.\n\n538\n00:27:14.784 --> 00:27:17.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's 16 weeks potentially for\n\n539\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.600\n1 release pack.\n\n540\n00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.150\nSo right at the beginning, you're gonna\nhave an idea as to what's going to be in\n\n541\n00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.376\nyour release.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n542\n00:27:23.376 --> 00:27:25.121\n&gt;&gt; But you're really not going to have\n\n543\n00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:29.018\na plan for exactly what's going to be in\nthat release until a lot closer to the end\n\n544\n00:27:29.018 --> 00:27:31.234\nof Iteration 4.\n&gt;&gt; Right, because 16 weeks,\n\n545\n00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:33.130\na lot can happen in that time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n546\n00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.340\nthat's exactly what we're saying there.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n547\n00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.300\n&gt;&gt; So your release plan\n\n548\n00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.530\ncould be based on team's velocity or\nwork estimates.\n\n549\n00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.760\nIf they are not accurate in\nyour estimates, then yes,\n\n550\n00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.660\nyour release is going to change and\nthings like your minimal viable product.\n\n551\n00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.000\nWhat is it that we have to release and\nwhat can we leave in the backlog?\n\n552\n00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.470\nBecause there are some things,\nand don't get me wrong,\n\n553\n00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.850\nwhen it comes to an agile project,\nit's no different to anything else.\n\n554\n00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.560\nYou get to the end of an iteration and\nyou can't necessarily deliver\n\n555\n00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.680\neverything that you set out to do\nbecause maybe testing failed or\n\n556\n00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.470\nbecause maybe there's some other issue.\n\n557\n00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:13.040\nSo it's only as we get towards\nthe end of that final iteration that\n\n558\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.418\nwe're able to really confirm what\nit is that we're going to release.\n\n559\n00:28:17.418 --> 00:28:24.280\nWhat we've gotta make sure\nthat we do is that we must\n\n560\n00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.450\nplan our releases to align with\nthe organization as a whole and\n\n561\n00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:32.010\nto align with their objectives and\nmake sure that we're\n\n562\n00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.610\nin tune with the organization and\nwhat the organization wants.\n\n563\n00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:41.482\nThat's what we've gotta do, we've gotta\nkeep them happy, we're delivering value.\n\n564\n00:28:41.482 --> 00:28:44.220\nAnd we're delivering value\nby way of new product.\n\n565\n00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:48.320\nAnd so we've gotta make sure that we,\nif especially they have a deadline,\n\n566\n00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.810\nthat we are aligned to that deadline.\n\n567\n00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:50.820\nSome deadlines,\n\n568\n00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.800\nwhen we talked about constraints in\na previous episode, we looked at, say,\n\n569\n00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.020\nregulatory constraints for instance.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n570\n00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.320\n&gt;&gt; Some deadlines can't be moved.\n\n571\n00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.120\nSo we've gotta make sure\nthat we're aligned to that,\n\n572\n00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.470\nthat we're fully aware of that, and that\nit's actually part of our project as well.\n\n573\n00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.320\nSo that's how we plan a release, okay?\n\n574\n00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.160\nAnd how we plan an iteration.\n\n575\n00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.300\nAnd so what's coming up next is, well,\n\n576\n00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.832\nlooking at the contents of an iteration.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n577\n00:29:20.832 --> 00:29:25.620\nAll right, so if you really kind of\nnarrowing or zooming in on a particular\n\n578\n00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.960\ngranular component here, so don't miss\nthat ladies and gentlemen, but for\n\n579\n00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.190\nnow let's go ahead and\nsign out of the show.\n\n580\n00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.964\nI've been your host Cherokee Boobse.\n&gt;&gt;

cool,\n\n8\n00:00:20.862 --> 00:00:23.890\nit's something that we really\nneed to address and discuss here.\n\n9\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.370\nThis is going to be risk management,\nand of course we have Mrs.\n\n10\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.970\nJo Peacock in studios to cover this topic.\n\n11\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.650\nOn a scale of one to ten Jo- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you're gonna ask me how cool\n\n12\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.610\nrisk management is, well-\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n13\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.038\nI was gonna say you know what is the risk\nto my health that this show may pose?\n\n14\n00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:43.152\n&gt;&gt; It depends.\n\n15\n00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:44.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.100\n&gt;&gt; If you carry on annoying me,\n\n17\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.690\nthe risk is gonna be quite high.\n&gt;&gt; All right, then I'll stop,\n\n18\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.620\nbecause you do scare me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wel gee, thanks for that.\n\n19\n00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.270\nI really don't know what to say to that.\n\n20\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.550\nYeah, okay, but\nit's not actually the risk.\n\n21\n00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.810\nOn a scale of one to\nten it's not the risk.\n\n22\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.110\nIt's the likelihood of\nthat risk occurring.\n\n23\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.205\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you're right.\n\n24\n00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:09.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the risk is that my patience\n\n25\n00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.940\nruns out and I lose my tolerance.\n&gt;&gt; Take things into your own hands.\n\n26\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah,\n\n27\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.740\nand the risk is that I might do something.\n\n28\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.910\nI might do something that might\ninvolve walking away, and\n\n29\n00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.918\nthat's just the nice version, right?\n\n30\n00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:23.534\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n31\n00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:25.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's the likelihood this thing that\n\n32\n00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.180\nwe're gonna worry about.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n33\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.480\n&gt;&gt; And it's the combination of the risk\n\n34\n00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.160\nand the likelihood and\nthat's what we've gotta mitigate against.\n\n35\n00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.500\nSo you see,\nwe have to mitigate against this, and\n\n36\n00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.425\nI know that how we mitigate against\nrisks is by not giving you caffeine.\n\n37\n00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:39.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n38\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.200\n&gt;&gt; That's how we mitigating against it.\n\n39\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n40\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.920\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, you're right Cherokee in this\n\n41\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.280\nparticular episode, we're actually gonna\nbe looking a risk management and more\n\n42\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.480\nimportantly, identifying risks and making\ndecisions is to what we do with risk.\n\n43\n00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.310\nSo the first thing that I guess we've\ngotta do is identify what a risk is.\n\n44\n00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.410\nWe've been talking about all of this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just assuming that everyone\n\n45\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.080\nknows, but that's not always the case.\n&gt;&gt; It's not always the case,\n\n46\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.290\nand especially not in IT either.\n\n47\n00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.060\nIt can be very difficult to define risk.\n\n48\n00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.640\nA risk is something that might or\n\n49\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.080\nmight not happen but that will\nimpact the outcome if it does occur.\n\n50\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.240\nBut risk can either be positive or\nthey can be negative.\n\n51\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.370\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n52\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.330\n&gt;&gt; Right so\n\n53\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.370\nwe've got to work as a team and\nthat's part of each iteration to identify\n\n54\n00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.670\nany potential risks to our program and\nto our development work.\n\n55\n00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.620\nSo a risk could be absolutely anything.\n\n56\n00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.490\nAnd we look at the risks\nof something happening but\n\n57\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.750\nwe also look at the risks\nof something not happening.\n\n58\n00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.420\nWhich is why we are talking about risks\nbeing positive and negative because,\n\n59\n00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.345\nyou see, the risks of not implementing\nthe solution could be higher\n\n60\n00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:54.685\nthan the potential negative risk\nof implementing the solution.\n\n61\n00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:57.825\nYou see if we implement a solution\n\n62\n00:02:57.825 --> 00:03:02.235\nit might have a negative impact on\nthe rest of our infrastructure.\n\n63\n00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:06.863\nBut actually if we don't implement\nthe solution then that might have\n\n64\n00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:10.069\na negative effect on our\nentire organization.\n\n65\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.090\nWe are gonna weigh it out.\n&gt;&gt; It's definitely not an easy\n\n66\n00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.070\ntask.\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n67\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.180\nAnd to be perfectly honest,\n\n68\n00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.670\nthis is something that we would\nlook at in a separate class.\n\n69\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.582\nIt's something that we would\nlook at in a separate series.\n\n70\n00:03:24.582 --> 00:03:26.788\nManagement of risk,\n\n71\n00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:30.850\nit's a whole skill set on it's own.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n72\n00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.140\nand they have like that can\nbe an entire profession,\n\n73\n00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.620\njust in that category.\n&gt;&gt; It is and\n\n74\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.020\nin fact we do have a qualification\nof management of risk,\n\n75\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.510\nwe've got quite a few qualifications\nof management of risk.\n\n76\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.010\nBut we have a methodology which we\ncall MOR, which is management of risk.\n\n77\n00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.490\nAnd yeah, it's a qualification\nwhere we actually look,\n\n78\n00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.050\na methodology where we\nlook at risk management.\n\n79\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.120\nAnd I know that it's something that\nwe've got to pay close attention to.\n\n80\n00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.840\nBut it's something that we tend to look\nat from a very high level when we're\n\n81\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.020\nmanaging a project, and\nwe don't realize just how important it is.\n\n82\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.420\nBecause that risk could happen and\n\n83\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.470\nit could impact the project\nin a negative way.\n\n84\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.690\nSo what we've got to do, as I've all ready\nsaid is we've got to identify a risk.\n\n85\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.670\nAnd then we've got to assess the risk for\nits likelihood, or\n\n86\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.350\nwe might call that a vulnerability.\n\n87\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.380\nAnd we've got to respond to that risk.\n\n88\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.430\nWe've got to decide what we're\ngoing to do about that risk, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.070\nSo what we're going to do\n\n90\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.140\nis we're just gonna undertake just\na little exercise, Cherokee, here.\n\n91\n00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.400\nAnd we're gonna do some risk scoring.\n\n92\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.740\nSo a risk score is calculated by assessing\nthe impact and then multiplying that by\n\n93\n00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.406\nthe likelihood or the vulnerability,\nand then that gives us a score of, say,\n\n94\n00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:59.390\neither one to five or one to ten,\nit depends on how you'll do this.\n\n95\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.280\nSo that's assessing the impact.\n\n96\n00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.870\nSo let's just say we had some\nrain in a previous episode\n\n97\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.620\nthat interrupted us-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n98\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, in the previous episode.\n\n99\n00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.730\nSo what is the impact of let's say\nthe roof leaking on the studio\n\n100\n00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.302\nthat we're in on a scale of one to five.\n&gt;&gt; Five,\n\n101\n00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:20.957\nhigh impact.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n102\n00:05:20.957 --> 00:05:25.564\nit's gonna have a high impact because if\nit leaks then we just simply can't record\n\n103\n00:05:25.564 --> 00:05:26.490\nanymore.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n104\n00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.680\n&gt;&gt; We got lot of equipment in this\n\n105\n00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.210\nstudio.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n106\n00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.970\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n107\n00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.520\nSo high impact, and what about the\nvulnerability, what about the likelihood\n\n108\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.819\nof that happening?\n&gt;&gt; Well we're in Florida, and-\n\n109\n00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:37.627\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n110\n00:05:37.627 --> 00:05:39.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If we look at,\n\n111\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.890\nmaybe any kind of historical data like\nthe weather for the past couple of days\n\n112\n00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.050\nwe can maybe use some kind of mathematical\ncalculation to determine that.\n\n113\n00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.302\nSo lets say over the past two\ndays it has rained everyday, so\n\n114\n00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:58.229\nif we look at like the past\nfive days,it just depends.\n\n115\n00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.212\nAnd so\nmaybe I come up with the percentage.\n\n116\n00:06:00.212 --> 00:06:04.240\nMy guess would be somewhere\naround 50% the likelihood.\n\n117\n00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.820\n&gt;&gt; So did we get somewhere?\n\n118\n00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.360\nDid we?\n\n119\n00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.950\nI fell asleep at that point in time.\n\n120\n00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.718\nI don't know about you, cuz I swear I\nasked her on a scale of one to five,\n\n121\n00:06:12.718 --> 00:06:16.150\nwhat is the likelihood and\nshe came up with 50%.\n\n122\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.850\n&gt;&gt; Is it only whole numbers can I do\n\n123\n00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.257\nlike 2.5?\n&gt;&gt; No, we're trying to demonstrate\n\n124\n00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.730\nsomething here.\n&gt;&gt; Three.\n\n125\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, that's better.\n\n126\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.765\nWe can work with that, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:32.250\n[LAUGH]\nIt took awhile, it took awhile.\n\n128\n00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so 3 times 5 is 15,\n\n129\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.240\nso our score is 15.\n&gt;&gt; Our score is 15, right.\n\n130\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.580\nNow that was a simple concept,\nbelieve it or not boys and\n\n131\n00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.010\ngirls, that was a simple concept, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Glad I can help Jo.\n\n132\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.740\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, but\n\n133\n00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.870\nactually what Cherokee said is all true.\n\n134\n00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.570\nAnd I was kind of waiting until we got\na little bit later into the episode before\n\n135\n00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.130\nI hit you with all that but\nhey why not let's go over now.\n\n136\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.350\nThe likelihood and even the impact\nitself is based on a number of factors.\n\n137\n00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.910\nAnd the likelihood or\nvulnerability would be based on\n\n138\n00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.180\nthings like what happened in the past and\nbased on,\n\n139\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.880\ncertainly in the instance that I gave you,\nthe likelihood of flood.\n\n140\n00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.200\nThe likelihood would be based on\ngeographical location, where we are.\n\n141\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.210\nMaybe the structure of\nthe roof that we have.\n\n142\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.280\nHow often it's rained in the past.\n\n143\n00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.870\nSo we used all of those to calculate our\nvulnerability score or our likelihood.\n\n144\n00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.070\nNow, I simplified in risk methodology.\n\n145\n00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.610\nIn MOR, we don't simplify it that much.\n\n146\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.036\nAnd we may use the score of one to ten or\n\n147\n00:07:46.036 --> 00:07:49.335\nwe may use something a lot\nmore complex than that.\n\n148\n00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:53.990\nBut we will do for every single risk,\nwe will calculate a risk score.\n\n149\n00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.830\nSo we calculated a risk score of 15 for\nflooding.\n\n150\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:05.610\nBut say, let's say for instance that\nthis particular studio caught on fire.\n\n151\n00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.942\nNow we might give that,\nbecause the likelihood of that happening,\n\n152\n00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:10.753\nthe vulnerability would be a lot less\n\n153\n00:08:10.753 --> 00:08:12.040\nthan flooding.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n154\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.205\n&gt;&gt; So we might give that a risk score of\n\n155\n00:08:14.205 --> 00:08:16.340\n10.\n\n156\n00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.320\nWhy is that important?\n\n157\n00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.730\nWhy is it important that\nwe give it a number?\n\n158\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.490\nWell, it's really simple.\n&gt;&gt; It helps our triage.\n\n159\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah,\n\n160\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.670\nit helps us prioritize.\n&gt;&gt; Prioritize.\n\n161\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.563\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because the higher the risk score\n\n162\n00:08:28.563 --> 00:08:30.714\nwe have, then-\n&gt;&gt; The more attention,\n\n163\n00:08:30.714 --> 00:08:33.366\nthe higher priority.\n&gt;&gt; The more attention, yeah,\n\n164\n00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:36.041\nthat we have to give to\nthat particular group.\n\n165\n00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:39.320\nAnd so\nwhat we would want to do with that risk?\n\n166\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.793\nWell, there are lots of things that\nwe might want to do with risk.\n\n167\n00:08:41.793 --> 00:08:45.925\nAnd we might want to avoid risk,\nwe might want to mitigate against it,\n\n168\n00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:48.570\nwe might want to share it or accept it.\n\n169\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.330\nAnd you've got lots of\nways of managing risk, and\n\n170\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.510\nlots of ways of responding to risk.\n\n171\n00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.870\nAnd it's up to you.\n\n172\n00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.260\nAnd one that I really want to point out,\nthere's no right or wrong way here.\n\n173\n00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.380\nOne that I really want to\npoint out is mitigate.\n\n174\n00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.780\nMitigate, if you see it says act\nto reduce the risks likelihood or\n\n175\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.044\nthe risks impact.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n176\n00:09:12.044 --> 00:09:14.651\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's actually trying to\n\n177\n00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:17.805\nprevent something from happening, or-\n&gt;&gt; Reducing\n\n178\n00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:20.628\nthe effects.\n&gt;&gt; Accepting that something's going to\n\n179\n00:09:20.628 --> 00:09:23.084\nhappen and then reducing the effects.\n\n180\n00:09:23.084 --> 00:09:25.881\nOne's proactive, and one's reactive.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n181\n00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:28.866\nyou talked about having\nrealistic expectations.\n\n182\n00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:34.483\nSo sometimes, it's realistic to\nexpect that something will happen,\n\n183\n00:09:34.483 --> 00:09:39.254\nlike rain, because rain does happen.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n184\n00:09:39.254 --> 00:09:39.916\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n185\n00:09:39.916 --> 00:09:44.803\nSo if we're going to mitigate against\na risk we've got to decide whether\n\n186\n00:09:44.803 --> 00:09:48.610\nwe're going to mitigate\nagainst the likelihood.\n\n187\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.120\nOr whether we're going to\nmitigate against the effect.\n\n188\n00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.120\nSo if we were to try and mitigate\nagainst the likelihood of it raining,\n\n189\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.712\nhow would we mitigate against it raining?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think.\n\n190\n00:10:00.712 --> 00:10:02.167\n&gt;&gt; Given that we've established we can't\n\n191\n00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:04.705\nstop it for the moment, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I was going to say,\n\n192\n00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:06.444\nI think China conceived the clouds, but\n\n193\n00:10:06.444 --> 00:10:09.195\nI don't think they've come up\nwith a process to prevent rain.\n\n194\n00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:11.149\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n195\n00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:14.890\nhow do we mitigate against it, then?\n&gt;&gt; I don't think we can, Jo.\n\n196\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we can.\n\n197\n00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.851\nWe can maybe reinforce our roof,\nfor instance.\n\n198\n00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:20.713\n&gt;&gt; But that doesn't stop the rain.\n\n199\n00:10:20.713 --> 00:10:21.735\n&gt;&gt; But it would stop the flood,\n\n200\n00:10:21.735 --> 00:10:22.512\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n201\n00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:23.673\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we want to do.\n\n202\n00:10:23.673 --> 00:10:27.530\nWe want to mitigate against it, so\nwe want to stop it from leaking.\n\n203\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.297\nOr we want to mitigate the impact.\n&gt;&gt; We could wear raincoats that we\n\n204\n00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:33.644\ncould then put.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n205\n00:10:33.644 --> 00:10:36.698\nthat would mitigate against the impact.\n\n206\n00:10:36.698 --> 00:10:41.820\nYeah, this is actually great, because\nthis is what happens in the real world.\n\n207\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.220\nThere's a confusion between the two.\n\n208\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.240\nAnd that's what we've gotta try and\nget our way round is that, you see,\n\n209\n00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.590\nto prevent the roof from leaking, we\nprobably want to do something to the roof.\n\n210\n00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.496\nSo that actually,\nwhat happens inside the studio,\n\n211\n00:10:57.496 --> 00:11:00.885\nwe're minimizing the risk of it happening.\n\n212\n00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:04.160\nSo we're minimizing\nproduction being interrupted.\n\n213\n00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.837\nSo we might want to maybe\nadd an additional roof on,\n\n214\n00:11:06.837 --> 00:11:09.142\nmaybe we put a pitched\nroof all over the top,\n\n215\n00:11:09.142 --> 00:11:12.798\nor maybe we want to resurface the roof.\n&gt;&gt; Have a floating roof.\n\n216\n00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:14.160\n&gt;&gt; Have a floating roof, yeah.\n\n217\n00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.100\nDo something slightly different.\n\n218\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.250\nMaybe adjust the drainage on the roof.\n\n219\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.380\nSo, that's trying to prevent\nthe impact to this particular studio.\n\n220\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.500\nOr we might mitigate against\nthe impact that's caused by the flood.\n\n221\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.045\nSo, we might instead of saying,\nokay, well,\n\n222\n00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:35.241\nI'm gonna try in prevent rain\nfrom coming into the studio.\n\n223\n00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:40.158\nWhat we might do is, we might add\nsomething over all of our electricity and\n\n224\n00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:45.178\nwe might add some sort of canopy over\nour TVs and screens and cameras, etc.\n\n225\n00:11:45.178 --> 00:11:48.780\nSo that actually what we do with it is\nwe will accepting that the risk might,\n\n226\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.996\nis going to happen, we're accepting\nthat there might be a flood.\n\n227\n00:11:51.996 --> 00:11:56.211\nBut we're gonna make sure that you\nknow our equipment isn't damaged.\n\n228\n00:11:56.211 --> 00:11:57.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, the impact.\n\n229\n00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n230\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:05.450\nif I think about things like,\nlet's go back to our fire.\n\n231\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.550\nFire was another risk.\n\n232\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.510\nWe might try and\nprevent fire from happening.\n\n233\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.629\nOr we might try and accept that\nfire is going to happen in a room.\n\n234\n00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:16.610\nBut try and minimize the impact of fire.\n\n235\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.582\nAnd I think about the way that we work\nin the US compared to the way we work in\n\n236\n00:12:20.582 --> 00:12:22.250\nEurope for instance.\n\n237\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.547\nIn the UK and in Europe,\nsprinkler systems aren't very common.\n\n238\n00:12:28.242 --> 00:12:31.678\nWhat we'll do is we contain a fire.\n\n239\n00:12:31.678 --> 00:12:33.329\nSo we have fire doors.\n\n240\n00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.175\nSo a sprinkler system will try and\nprevent a fire.\n\n241\n00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:40.590\nWe'll try and prevent it from spreading.\n&gt;&gt; Supress.\n\n242\n00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.388\n&gt;&gt; But in the UK, in Europe,\n\n243\n00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:47.160\nwe accept that fire may happen.\n\n244\n00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.950\nBut the damage caused by sprinkler systems\nis actually greater than the damage caused\n\n245\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:51.910\nby a fire.\n\n246\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.500\nSo what we will do is,\nwe will have airtight rooms,\n\n247\n00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.970\nwe will be able to seal our rooms.\n\n248\n00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.220\nSeal off air to the rooms and therefore,\nsuppress the fire to stop it from\n\n249\n00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.889\nspreading.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we do have fire suppression\n\n250\n00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:07.468\nsystems here, it's just cheaper to do-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n251\n00:13:07.468 --> 00:13:08.254\n&gt;&gt; Sprinkler systems.\n\n252\n00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:08.942\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n253\n00:13:08.942 --> 00:13:13.122\nSo there's lots of different ways\nthat you can mitigate against risk.\n\n254\n00:13:13.122 --> 00:13:13.856\nAnd of course,\n\n255\n00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:17.250\nwith positive risks you might actually\nwant to encourage risk as well.\n\n256\n00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.589\nYou might want to ensure that what\nmight happen, it actually happens.\n\n257\n00:13:20.589 --> 00:13:22.137\n&gt;&gt; Big risk, big reward, right?\n\n258\n00:13:22.137 --> 00:13:22.961\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n259\n00:13:22.961 --> 00:13:25.979\nOkay, yeah, and then you,\nyou heard all the old adages,\n\n260\n00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:29.931\nback in the 1980s that you don't get\nanywhere if you don't take risks.\n\n261\n00:13:29.931 --> 00:13:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Synergy was the buzz word and all that.\n\n262\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, I mean, you can decide,\n\n263\n00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.590\nbut you've gotta identify them\nbefore you can make a decision as\n\n264\n00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.910\nto what you're gonna do with a risk.\n\n265\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.750\nSo what do you with it?\n\n266\n00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.000\nWell, the project team's got to\nagree on what to do with it.\n\n267\n00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.760\nAnd you might decide to\njust accept any risk.\n\n268\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.350\nRather than encourage it, or\nrather than discourage it,\n\n269\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.240\nyou might decide just to accept it.\n\n270\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.540\nI don't care what you do with it.\n\n271\n00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.640\nAm I allowed to say that?\n\n272\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.126\nYeah, I'm gonna say it anyway.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:13:58.126 --> 00:14:00.294\n&gt;&gt; I don't care what you do with the risk,\n\n274\n00:14:00.294 --> 00:14:01.840\nas long as you document it.\n\n275\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.714\nI want to know that you\nhave considered the risk,\n\n276\n00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:09.709\nthat you have actually identified a risk,\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n277\n00:14:09.709 --> 00:14:11.000\n&gt;&gt; And that it's being considered.\n\n278\n00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.950\nYou've assessed it,\nyou've considered it, and\n\n279\n00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.450\nthis is the decision that you've reached,\nand this is why.\n\n280\n00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:22.770\nSo any risk that we identify has\nto be assigned to a risk owner,\n\n281\n00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.630\nsomebody who's gonna take\nownership of that risk.\n\n282\n00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.560\nAnd it's gotta be somebody\nwithin the team as well.\n\n283\n00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.633\n&gt;&gt; I know it's kinda crazy, but\n\n284\n00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:33.190\nI remember hearing this for\n\n285\n00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.720\nthe first time that even avoiding\nit is a possibility as well.\n\n286\n00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.563\nSo if you have risk avoidance, you could\nbasically just be saying, hey, our quarter\n\n287\n00:14:41.563 --> 00:14:45.956\none budget doesn't allow for this\nparticular control at this point in time.\n\n288\n00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:48.850\nSo we're going to avoid it for\nthis quarter.\n\n289\n00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.700\nWe'll come back and look at it second\nquarter when our budget reups.\n\n290\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.849\n&gt;&gt; Right, or you might that avoidance or\n\n291\n00:14:53.849 --> 00:14:56.216\nyou might call that just delay.\n&gt;&gt; Delay, okay.\n\n292\n00:14:56.216 --> 00:14:57.876\n&gt;&gt; We're just trying to delay that risk.\n\n293\n00:14:57.876 --> 00:15:00.674\nYeah, but it's up to you.\n\n294\n00:15:00.674 --> 00:15:04.880\nIt's up to you to decide what\nyou want to do with that risk.\n\n295\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.520\nBut it has to be documented.\n\n296\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.750\nAnd somebody has to take ownership\nof that specific risk and\n\n297\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.410\nsomebody has to document what it is.\n\n298\n00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.890\nWe've got to agree what we're\ngoing to do with that risk.\n\n299\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.050\nAnd if we're going to do\nanything with the risk.\n\n300\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.340\nIf we're actually going to\nundertake any activities,\n\n301\n00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.880\nthen of course they've got\nto be planned out as well.\n\n302\n00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.630\nYou don't just wave a magic wand and\nthings happen.\n\n303\n00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.990\nSo we have residual risks and\nwe have secondary risks.\n\n304\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:35.060\nAnd a residual risk is that portion\nof the risk that's still left over\n\n305\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.220\nafter we have taken any actions.\n\n306\n00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:43.290\nSo, a residual risk is, let's say we've\ninstalled a sprinkler system, but\n\n307\n00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.520\nthere may still be some\nportion of risk left over.\n\n308\n00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.538\nThat's considered to be a residual risk.\n\n309\n00:15:49.538 --> 00:15:52.742\nA fire could still start after we\nhave installed a sprinkler system.\n\n310\n00:15:52.742 --> 00:15:54.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] True.\n\n311\n00:15:54.263 --> 00:15:57.417\n&gt;&gt; So that's the residual risk.\n\n312\n00:15:57.417 --> 00:16:02.354\nBut a secondary risk is the entire reason\nwhy sprinkler systems aren't really\n\n313\n00:16:02.354 --> 00:16:03.630\nbig in Europe.\n\n314\n00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:08.660\nBecause the secondary risk is a new\nrisk that's introduced by the actions.\n\n315\n00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:14.753\nSo we bring in a sprinkler system to try\nand mitigate against the risk of fire,\n\n316\n00:16:14.753 --> 00:16:20.300\nand what we actually do is cause flooding.\n&gt;&gt; Shorting out our electrical equipment?\n\n317\n00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n318\n00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.746\nthis is why they're in various places,\nlike in the UK,\n\n319\n00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:29.738\nthey would be considered to be the fact\nis the secondary risk is considered to\n\n320\n00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:33.101\nactually cause more damage\nthan the primary risk.\n\n321\n00:16:33.101 --> 00:16:36.820\nAnd so, therefore, we don't tend\nto use those sprinkler systems.\n\n322\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.516\n&gt;&gt; More like a halon or\n\n323\n00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:41.008\nsome kind of gas system.\n&gt;&gt; Right, we'd use something like that\n\n324\n00:16:41.008 --> 00:16:46.168\nperhaps, or we'd use other ways,\nsuch as isolating the fire completely.\n\n325\n00:16:46.168 --> 00:16:51.690\nSo yeah, we've got various different\nways of mitigating against risk.\n\n326\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.294\nBut just remember that you might\nmitigate against one particular risk and\n\n327\n00:16:54.294 --> 00:16:56.975\nyou might introduce another one.\n&gt;&gt; Introduce another one.\n\n328\n00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:57.885\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\n\n329\n00:16:57.885 --> 00:17:02.295\nso we've got to assess every single risk,\nwhether it's secondary risk,\n\n330\n00:17:02.295 --> 00:17:04.440\nprimary risk or residual risk.\n\n331\n00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.655\nIt's all gotta be assessed, and\nit's all got to be documented.\n\n332\n00:17:07.655 --> 00:17:11.891\nIt's all got to be accounted for.\n\n333\n00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:16.051\nNow, of course, with any project,\nwe've always got constraints, and\n\n334\n00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:19.700\nwe've talked about constraints\nwith all of our projects.\n\n335\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.070\nYou might even consider\nthese to be a risk as well.\n\n336\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.520\nWith any project, we've got the scope of\nthe project,, we've got schedule, and\n\n337\n00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.830\nwe've got the budget of\nour project as well.\n\n338\n00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.040\nInvariably, the budget and\nthe schedule are fixed, but\n\n339\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.100\nit's the scope that's actually flexible.\n\n340\n00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.180\nAnd we mentioned this when we talk\nabout risk management, because what\n\n341\n00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.830\nwe've gotta make sure is that we meet\nbudget and that we meet schedule.\n\n342\n00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:52.400\nBut we've also gotta consider how much\nscope we introduce as part of that.\n\n343\n00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.650\nIf our budget is so small and\n\n344\n00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:01.340\nour schedule is so short, then we might\nnot be able to deliver anything at all.\n\n345\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:07.390\nSo we really need to ensure that,\nit's part of risk management,\n\n346\n00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:12.030\nbut it's managing stakeholder expectation\ncause that in itself is a risk.\n\n347\n00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.294\nWe run the risk of over-promising and\nthen under-delivering, and\n\n348\n00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:17.100\nthat's exactly what we don't want.\n\n349\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.160\nWe want to deliver value.\n\n350\n00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.070\nSo we have to ensure that all of\nour stories are prioritized, and\n\n351\n00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.680\nthat we are able to, and\nwhen we talk about overestimation and\n\n352\n00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.190\nunderestimation in previous episodes,\nwe're able to accurately relate\n\n353\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.360\nto our stakeholders and\nto our customers what we can produce for\n\n354\n00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.920\nthem with each iteration given the time\nand the budget constraints that we have.\n\n355\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.510\nThat's why we've gotta be really\naccurate in our estimating.\n\n356\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.350\nAnd I say accurate, but\naccurate within tolerances, and\n\n357\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.090\nwe've gotta be really\nobjective with our estimating.\n\n358\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.900\nIn our previous episode,\nwe looked at ideal days, and\n\n359\n00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.699\nwe looked at sort of productive\ntime in our ideal days.\n\n360\n00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:03.730\nBe realistic, be objective about it,\nand let's welcome the premise\n\n361\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.500\nthat we're only really productive for\n50% of our working day.\n\n362\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.430\nAnd that some days we're gonna be\nproductive for a little bit more.\n\n363\n00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.460\nBut some days we might get distracted and\nwe might even be productive for less.\n\n364\n00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.290\nSo be realistic,\nbecause it's only then that you can\n\n365\n00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.560\nmanage stakeholder expectations and\nmanage customer expectations as well.\n\n366\n00:19:24.395 --> 00:19:29.251\nNow, of course, Agile is a methodology\nwhere we work on iterations.\n\n367\n00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:32.675\nSo we do adopt a just-in-time approach.\n\n368\n00:19:32.675 --> 00:19:37.283\nAnd so this fail fast and get-it-done\nquick, that actually applies to help us\n\n369\n00:19:37.283 --> 00:19:41.775\nreduce risk, which means that we've\ngotta identify failure immediately.\n\n370\n00:19:41.775 --> 00:19:43.295\nWe've got to identify risk.\n\n371\n00:19:43.295 --> 00:19:47.940\nAnd we've got to identify where somethings\ngoing to go wrong and then fix it, and\n\n372\n00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.370\nfix it now.\n\n373\n00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.230\nAnd we consider those risks\nin our story prioritization.\n\n374\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.400\nHow much of a risk is this story?\n\n375\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.270\nHow much of a risk do we have\n\n376\n00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.810\nto our current infrastructure\nby implementing this story?\n\n377\n00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.000\nAnd you don't just forget about a risk.\n\n378\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.290\nYou can't just forget about a risk.\n\n379\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.730\nJust because you have identified\na risk and you've assessed it and\n\n380\n00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.010\nyou've decided what to do about it,\nyou don't just then forget about it.\n\n381\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.200\nYou just say, well, okay, well,\nI've documented it, that's it.\n\n382\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.682\nWe can just move on.\n\n383\n00:20:17.682 --> 00:20:20.890\nAnd the fact of the matter is that\neven though you've documented this and\n\n384\n00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.370\nyou've documented your plan,\nit still could happen.\n\n385\n00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.900\nSo we need to be aware of this.\n\n386\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.540\nAnd all of our mitigation actions,\nif we're going to implement any mitigation\n\n387\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.210\nactions, they've got to be added\nto the backlog as activities.\n\n388\n00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.110\nThey've got to go into\niterations at some point.\n\n389\n00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:43.340\nSo risk is not something\nthat can just be ignored.\n\n390\n00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.695\nEven though we might accept risk,\nwe can't just ignore risk.\n\n391\n00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.320\nSo in this particular episode,\n\n392\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.990\nwe've taken a very brief look at risk\nmanagement for out Agile project.\n\n393\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.820\nAnd when we come back,\nin our next episode,\n\n394\n00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.850\nwe're going to be delving deeper into\nour project iteration and working\n\n395\n00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.600\ntowards getting our project completed.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n396\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.190\nit sounds like you've\nthoroughly planned that out.\n\n397\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.773\nYou've taken full account of all\n\n398\n00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:16.788\nthe risks possible.\n&gt;&gt; Planned only in the short term\n\n399\n00:21:16.788 --> 00:21:17.598\nthough, right?\n\n400\n00:21:17.598 --> 00:21:19.620\nYeah, we haven't planned the long term,\nyeah.\n\n401\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.188\n&gt;&gt; We've got an idea of what we're gonna\n\n402\n00:21:21.188 --> 00:21:23.602\ndo in the next episode, but\nthat could change folks, so.\n\n403\n00:21:23.602 --> 00:21:26.133\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's our interation.\n\n404\n00:21:26.133 --> 00:21:27.490\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well, thank you, Jo.\n\n405\n00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.080\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\nbut let's sign out.\n\n406\n00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.510\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n407\n00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.631\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:12.645\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to\n\n5\n00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.590\nyour Agile Project Management Concepts\nseries.\n\n6\n00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.710\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.350\nIn this episode we'll be talking\nabout something very important.\n\n8\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.720\nWe'll be looking at, well,\nplanning communication.\n\n9\n00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.100\nAnd nothing worse than\nhaving poor communication,\n\n10\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.010\nespecially here within our teams.\n\n11\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.630\nSo with us today we have Jo Peacock\nto help deliver this topic.\n\n12\n00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.238\nHow's it going, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:34.238 --> 00:00:36.120\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n14\n00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.280\nAnd I see that we're able to communicate\neffectively as of the moment, but\n\n15\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.286\nI'm looking to enhance those skills.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n16\n00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:45.762\nwe always start off with that first\nquestion when it comes to communication,\n\n17\n00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:47.390\ndon't we?\n&gt;&gt; What's the first question?\n\n18\n00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.580\n&gt;&gt; The first question is always about\n\n19\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.390\nlanguage, isn't it?\n\n20\n00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.743\nWhat language do we communicate in?\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n21\n00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:54.817\nwe've already learned this.\n&gt;&gt; You've learned this many times.\n\n22\n00:00:54.817 --> 00:00:57.364\nIt hasn't sunk in, but\nyou've learned this many times.\n\n23\n00:00:57.364 --> 00:00:59.865\nSo Cherokee,\nwhat language do we communicate in?\n\n24\n00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:01.491\n&gt;&gt; The language of the audience.\n\n25\n00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:05.434\n&gt;&gt; Hey look at that, it has sunk in.\n\n26\n00:01:05.434 --> 00:01:09.300\nWell, we're still working on\nthe application, but it's sunk in.\n\n27\n00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.510\nYeah, we always communicate in\nthe language of the audience.\n\n28\n00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.360\nBut at the same time,\nwe've got to plan effective communication.\n\n29\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.010\nIf we communicate in an ad hoc way,\n\n30\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.040\nbearing in mind that Agile is\nlooking at efficiencies here.\n\n31\n00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.050\nIf we communicate in an ad hoc way,\n\n32\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.810\nif we communicate in a way that\nis just completely disorganized.\n\n33\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.012\nThen what's going to happen is that\neverybody is going to be subject to\n\n34\n00:01:33.012 --> 00:01:34.091\ninterruptions.\n\n35\n00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:37.389\nAll of the recipients, or\nthe audience for any communication,\n\n36\n00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:41.190\nare going to be unsure of what\nthe message is that's being communicated.\n\n37\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.352\nAnd they're also not going to know\nwhether any communication is important or\n\n38\n00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:47.025\nwhether it's not important.\n\n39\n00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:51.450\nSo it is really important that\nwe plan our communication.\n\n40\n00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.260\nSo in this particular episode,\nwe're going to be looking at\n\n41\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.680\nvarious methods of communication\nwithin an Agile project.\n\n42\n00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.170\nAnd it's not just by talking,\nit's actually by planning and\n\n43\n00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.450\nusing what we call information radiators,\nand we're going to look at those.\n\n44\n00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.800\nAnd making sure that those information\nradiators are planned and are used\n\n45\n00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.610\neffectively as well as efficiently, so\nthat we are all working at our optimum.\n\n46\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.790\nWe talked in previous episodes\nabout having ideal days.\n\n47\n00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.118\nDo you remember what an ideal day was?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we went through that algorithm or\n\n48\n00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:30.983\nthe equation to look at how to set that\nup to determine the amount of hours\n\n49\n00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:35.600\nthat were actually usable where\nwe were really productive.\n\n50\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's about productive times.\n\n51\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.230\nAnd we'll use time management to help us\nto make the most of our productive time.\n\n52\n00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.630\nBut an ideal day in terms of a project\nis the productive part of our day.\n\n53\n00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.540\nSo do you remember how much time\nwe said that we were actually\n\n54\n00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.270\nproductive?\n\n55\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.060\n&gt;&gt; During a day?\n\n56\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; An\n\n57\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.826\nindividual?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n58\n00:02:56.826 --> 00:02:57.859\n&gt;&gt; 50%.\n\n59\n00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.809\n&gt;&gt; Right, only about half of a working\n\n60\n00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.090\nday we're actually really productive.\n\n61\n00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.110\nThe rest of the time, we're distracted.\n\n62\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.880\nWe're distracted by meetings maybe,\neven our stand up meeting,\n\n63\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.440\nwhich we're going to have\na look at in a moment.\n\n64\n00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.028\nEven our stand up meeting,\n\n65\n00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:15.628\nthat's a part of a day where\nwe're not actually productive.\n\n66\n00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:22.480\nEven though it's part of the project, it's\nsomething that happens where we are not.\n\n67\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.407\nIt's only 15 minutes, but that's 15\nminutes that we're not actually developing\n\n68\n00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:29.480\nanything, that we're not\nworking on the project itself.\n\n69\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.620\nSo everything that we do takes,\njust chips away,\n\n70\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.110\njust takes a little bit away\nfrom our eight hours per day.\n\n71\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.010\nAnd communication is a real important\ntime waster, as is social media as well,\n\n72\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.670\nand all of the other distractions\nthat we know that we also come to.\n\n73\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.995\nBut at the end of the day, we've got\nto make sure that we are productive.\n\n74\n00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:56.944\nAnd that means that if we can minimize\nthe amount of time that we spend\n\n75\n00:03:56.944 --> 00:04:01.173\neither communicating with, or\nreading and receiving communication,\n\n76\n00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:05.340\nthen that's only going to work\nto the benefit of the project.\n\n77\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.690\nAnd if it works to\nthe benefit of the project,\n\n78\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.710\nthen it's going to deliver\nvalue to our customer.\n\n79\n00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.567\nSo plan your communication and\nbasic time management as well.\n\n80\n00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:16.331\nPlan when you're going to read or\n\n81\n00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:19.485\nwhen you're going to perform\nyour communication as well.\n\n82\n00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:25.290\nSo don't just plan when you're going to\nsend it or how often you're going to send.\n\n83\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.750\nSo we're going to send communication\nout to our users once a week,\n\n84\n00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.040\nyou should also plan when you're going\nto compile that communication too.\n\n85\n00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.782\nSo everything should be planned,\nthat allows us to be more productive.\n\n86\n00:04:36.782 --> 00:04:42.069\nSo our project managers, or if we're\nin a SCRUM project, then our SCRUM\n\n87\n00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.940\nmasters have got to communicate\non a regular and continual basis.\n\n88\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.980\nWe've also got that role\nof product owner as well.\n\n89\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.391\nAnd the product owner is responsible for\nwhat?\n\n90\n00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:55.657\n&gt;&gt; The product.\n\n91\n00:04:55.657 --> 00:04:56.179\n&gt;&gt; Right, sorry,\n\n92\n00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:57.990\nI like putting her on the spot.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.766\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wanna see if\n\n94\n00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.460\nshe's been paying attention.\n\n95\n00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.860\nBut the product owner is responsible for\nthe functionality\n\n96\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.560\nof the actual product itself,\nof what it is that we are developing.\n\n97\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.760\nSo do you think he communicates?\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n98\n00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, in fact,\n\n99\n00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.036\nin a previous episode we looked at sort of\nestimating, and we looked at estimating\n\n100\n00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:24.140\nour stories, and estimating how long it's\ngoing to take us to complete a story.\n\n101\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.309\nAnd, of course,\nthe product owner is responsible for\n\n102\n00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:27.810\nthat type of communication.\n\n103\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.295\nNow if you look back at a previous\nepisode, you'll see that we actually\n\n104\n00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:35.902\nspirited somebody into our\nepisode to help us with that.\n\n105\n00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:37.126\nCuz we had kind of a dilemma,\n\n106\n00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:40.090\ncuz we really weren't agreeing, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn't see eye to\n\n107\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.520\neye on our estimations.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n108\n00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.330\nand so that's a communication method,\nbecause that was a meeting.\n\n109\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.208\nAnd it might only have been a meeting\nbetween the three of us, but\n\n110\n00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:50.125\nthat was a meeting.\n\n111\n00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:54.176\nSo all of those chip into our day,\nchip into our productive day,\n\n112\n00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:59.232\nbecause it's a distraction, but\nit's still something that needs to happen.\n\n113\n00:05:59.232 --> 00:06:00.691\nSo when we communicate,\n\n114\n00:06:00.691 --> 00:06:04.516\nlet's think about all of the things\nthat we should communicate.\n\n115\n00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:09.361\nAnd we should be able to identify\nwhat needs communicating and\n\n116\n00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:12.260\nwhat doesn't need communicating.\n\n117\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.177\nJust earlier on before we started\nthis session, we were actually having\n\n118\n00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:20.160\na discussion about communication and\nabout communication tools.\n\n119\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.410\nAnd it's really important that, for any\ngiven project, we have the most efficient\n\n120\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.291\ncommunication tool that's available to us.\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, does that mean\n\n121\n00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:34.330\nhaving the newest tool available?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n122\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.070\n&gt;&gt; The coolest, most fandangled,\n\n123\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.210\nshiny tool?\n&gt;&gt; No, we're in IT, and\n\n124\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.528\nI know that the temptation there is,\n\n125\n00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:47.920\nbecause we're in IT,\nwe've gotta have the latest gadget, right?\n\n126\n00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.367\nWe've gotta have the shiny toy, and\nyeah, I fall victim to that as well.\n\n127\n00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:52.946\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:54.671\n&gt;&gt; But the fact of the matter is\n\n129\n00:06:54.671 --> 00:06:58.273\nthe shiny toy might not be as\nintuitive as you think it is.\n\n130\n00:06:58.273 --> 00:07:00.851\nAnd if you've got 15 shiny toys, and\n\n131\n00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:05.318\nyou've got to a different shiny toy for\neach particular activity.\n\n132\n00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:07.720\nHow do you know which\none you've got to go to?\n\n133\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.407\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n134\n00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:10.630\n&gt;&gt; Is that really efficient?\n\n135\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.930\n&gt;&gt; That's the key word here.\n\n136\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.538\n&gt;&gt; Right, or\n\n137\n00:07:12.538 --> 00:07:16.191\nis it just a case of we're buying\nshiny toys because we want shiny\n\n138\n00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:17.800\ntoys?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n139\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, you've got\n\n140\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.950\nto think about this from\na project perspective.\n\n141\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.428\nAnd the project manager's got\nto make these decisions as well.\n\n142\n00:07:24.428 --> 00:07:29.305\nOr rather, it might be a program manager\nthat's making these decisions on behalf\n\n143\n00:07:29.305 --> 00:07:31.865\nof the entire project management office.\n\n144\n00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:35.681\nWe will have a tool that will\nbe efficient and effective so\n\n145\n00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:40.381\nthat it will actually help us communicate,\nbut it will be efficient.\n\n146\n00:07:40.381 --> 00:07:43.900\nWe're all used to standard tools\nlike shared calendars, for instance.\n\n147\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.322\nOr we're used to emails and\ninstant messaging.\n\n148\n00:07:46.322 --> 00:07:52.894\nBut then there are lots of new tools\nthat allow us to share documentation,\n\n149\n00:07:52.894 --> 00:07:57.136\nand that allow us share files and\nto share code.\n\n150\n00:07:57.136 --> 00:08:02.740\nBut then, is learning that new\ntool gonna be unproductive time?\n\n151\n00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.592\nBecause previous, you were just\nusing a shared drive on a server.\n\n152\n00:08:06.592 --> 00:08:09.600\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda funny that\n\n153\n00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.560\nthis does fall back to\nunderstanding your audience too.\n\n154\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.808\nBecause really knowing your\nenvironment is key here, also.\n\n155\n00:08:16.808 --> 00:08:19.360\nIt's kind of interesting.\n\n156\n00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.718\nThe marketing team went and\n\n157\n00:08:20.718 --> 00:08:23.741\nspoke to the University here in\nGainesville a few weeks ago.\n\n158\n00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:28.290\nAnd the students, so\nthey're of the younger generation, right?\n\n159\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.712\nAnd they just could not believe\nhow much we, as a company,\n\n160\n00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:36.971\nwere underutilizing Instagram\nas a form of marketing.\n\n161\n00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:40.514\nAnd for me,\nwhen I first heard that, I thought,\n\n162\n00:08:40.514 --> 00:08:43.807\nwell isn't Instagram\na way to share photos?\n\n163\n00:08:43.807 --> 00:08:47.308\nBut it's developed into so\nmuch more than that.\n\n164\n00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:50.987\nAnd for the younger generation,\nthey're on it all the time.\n\n165\n00:08:50.987 --> 00:08:56.883\nSo it really just depends.\n&gt;&gt; And when we talk about projects,\n\n166\n00:08:56.883 --> 00:09:01.749\nI expect our project team to be fairly\ntechnically savvy, should I say.\n\n167\n00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:05.373\nSo I expect them to know about\nwhat tools are available to them.\n\n168\n00:09:05.373 --> 00:09:10.760\nAnd I also expect them to be able to\nlearn how to use those tools as well.\n\n169\n00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.105\n&gt;&gt; But learning does take time.\n\n170\n00:09:12.105 --> 00:09:13.611\n&gt;&gt; But learning takes time and\n\n171\n00:09:13.611 --> 00:09:18.197\nthen that is time that's detracted from\nthe development work of the actual project\n\n172\n00:09:18.197 --> 00:09:18.732\nitself.\n\n173\n00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:22.513\nAnd then we've also got to think as well,\nwhen we're developing, and\n\n174\n00:09:22.513 --> 00:09:25.970\nI know that we've spoken about\nthis in previous episodes.\n\n175\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.448\nWhen we're developing new software,\n\n176\n00:09:28.448 --> 00:09:32.585\nwe've also got to think about who\nthe users of that software are.\n\n177\n00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:36.315\nAnd whilst it might be okay for\nthe students at the university.\n\n178\n00:09:36.315 --> 00:09:40.967\nThese young whiz kids who are sort of 19,\n20 years old, who might think that yeah,\n\n179\n00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:44.696\nthis is absolutely fantastic, and\nInstagram is absolutely great.\n\n180\n00:09:44.696 --> 00:09:48.932\nBut here at ITProTV we've gotta\nthink about our audience, too.\n\n181\n00:09:48.932 --> 00:09:53.308\nAnd while Instagram might be great for\nsort of 16, 17 year olds,\n\n182\n00:09:53.308 --> 00:09:57.393\nwe've also gotta think about\nthe rest of our audiences as well.\n\n183\n00:09:57.393 --> 00:10:03.055\nSo we've gotta find appropriate tools and\nwe've gotta program the appropriate\n\n184\n00:10:03.055 --> 00:10:07.980\nsoftware that meets our demographic and\nthat meets our market space.\n\n185\n00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.561\nWhich is something that we'd\nrefer to in sales as well.\n\n186\n00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:15.370\nWhich would be who are we aiming at and\nwhat is our market space?\n\n187\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.523\nWhere are our opportunities?\n\n188\n00:10:17.523 --> 00:10:21.061\nBut right now, we're talking about\ncommunicating within a project and\n\n189\n00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:24.310\nwe're talking about communicating\njust outside of the project.\n\n190\n00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.044\nSo communicating with our customers.\n\n191\n00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:31.022\nAnd the slide that's been in sort of\nfront of you for a little while now,\n\n192\n00:10:31.022 --> 00:10:35.020\nit really looks at the sort of things\nthat we might want to communicate.\n\n193\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.410\nBut it's up to you what you communicate.\n\n194\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.246\nOne thing that I do like about this\nparticular slide that I want to really\n\n195\n00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:45.970\npoint out to you we're is\ncommunicating accomplishments.\n\n196\n00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.960\nAnd we'll do that a lot.\n\n197\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.078\nAnd we want to communicate\naccomplishments.\n\n198\n00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:55.120\nWhy do you think we\ncommunicate accomplishments?\n\n199\n00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.773\n&gt;&gt; I think it just creates a sense\n\n200\n00:10:56.773 --> 00:10:57.437\nof morale.\n\n201\n00:10:57.437 --> 00:11:04.812\nAnd something that at the end of, from my\nolder training here in project management.\n\n202\n00:11:04.812 --> 00:11:11.008\nFor the closing phase, the older water\nwaterfall style, with the domain process.\n\n203\n00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:13.789\nDuring that last phase in closing,\n\n204\n00:11:13.789 --> 00:11:19.640\nyou should always have some sort of\nclosing to acknowledge a job well done.\n\n205\n00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.065\nBecause it just creates a sense of unity\nand accomplishment and well-being.\n\n206\n00:11:25.065 --> 00:11:28.538\nAnd I think it just keeps that\nmomentum going for the motivation.\n\n207\n00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:29.046\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n208\n00:11:29.046 --> 00:11:32.737\nactually the last point that you\nsaid is really, really important.\n\n209\n00:11:32.737 --> 00:11:36.007\nAnd so when you talked about\nthe waterfall approach there and\n\n210\n00:11:36.007 --> 00:11:38.005\nyou said yes well at the end we can.\n\n211\n00:11:38.005 --> 00:11:39.751\nWe're in Agile, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:42.685\nAnd so we're talking about\nthe end of an iteration here.\n\n213\n00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:45.010\nBut we're also talking about\nthroughout the iteration,\n\n214\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.727\nwe should communicate accomplishments.\n\n215\n00:11:46.727 --> 00:11:50.408\nAnd we should use that standup,\nthe daily standup that we have,\n\n216\n00:11:50.408 --> 00:11:54.790\nto communicate accomplishments as well,\nbecause it builds up momentum.\n\n217\n00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:00.412\nIt actually builds up moral, and it allows\nus to build up and then maintain momentum.\n\n218\n00:12:00.412 --> 00:12:03.330\nSo yes,\nwe should communicate accomplishments.\n\n219\n00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.640\nJust remember, that our standup\nis not a huge marketing tool.\n\n220\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.220\nIt's not something where we're going to\ncommunicate just accomplishments only.\n\n221\n00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.680\nThat's a big mistake,\nwhen it comes to standup by the way.\n\n222\n00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.950\nIn that some project managers or\nscrum masters will prefer to use\n\n223\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.490\nthe standup just to communicate\nwhat we've done well.\n\n224\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.666\nNo, we should use that standup to\ncommunicate our obstacles as well.\n\n225\n00:12:24.666 --> 00:12:28.741\nWhat's facing us that we're not\ntoo sure how we can resolve?\n\n226\n00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:33.316\nBecause the standup is the opportunity for\nall of our colleagues to say, well look,\n\n227\n00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:34.160\nthat's okay.\n\n228\n00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.530\nI know about this, I can help with this.\n\n229\n00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.376\nSo all of these are what we\ncall an information radiator.\n\n230\n00:12:42.376 --> 00:12:43.363\n&gt;&gt; Good because I had no clue\n\n231\n00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:45.437\nwhat you were talking about earlier.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:12:45.437 --> 00:12:48.472\n&gt;&gt; Never heard that term before.\n\n233\n00:12:48.472 --> 00:12:50.229\n&gt;&gt; Now all of these are what we call\n\n234\n00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:51.950\nan information radiator.\n\n235\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.606\nTake a look at that bullet point in\nthe middle there, a Big Visible Chart!\n\n236\n00:12:56.606 --> 00:13:00.536\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In case I didn't see it, right?\n\n237\n00:13:00.536 --> 00:13:03.663\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] so we know information\n\n238\n00:13:03.663 --> 00:13:08.574\nradiators is just a tool that we use for\ncommunication.\n\n239\n00:13:08.574 --> 00:13:14.455\nAnd we've got various information\nradiators, our Big Visible Charts.\n\n240\n00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:17.078\nRemember in Camburn,\nwhen we looked at Camburn and\n\n241\n00:13:17.078 --> 00:13:18.975\nwe talked about our progress chart?\n\n242\n00:13:18.975 --> 00:13:20.284\nAnd Camburn just simply\n\n243\n00:13:20.284 --> 00:13:21.845\nmeans a visible board?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n244\n00:13:21.845 --> 00:13:22.436\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n245\n00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:25.990\nwell that's an information radiator,\nas well.\n\n246\n00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.238\nAn information radiator is something\nthat simply radiates information.\n\n247\n00:13:29.238 --> 00:13:31.820\nIt just gives out information.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n248\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.690\n&gt;&gt; The beauty of information radiators,\n\n249\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.800\nand the beauty of boards, or Big Visible\nCharts, are that they actually show,\n\n250\n00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.590\nat a glance, team progress.\n\n251\n00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.580\nAnd these are something\nthat you don't have\n\n252\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.710\nto formally communicate\nto the rest of the team.\n\n253\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:52.780\nSo that means we don't have to\nhave a meeting to discuss it.\n\n254\n00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.493\nWhat it means is we've got a board.\n\n255\n00:13:54.493 --> 00:13:56.392\nIt says it should be visible for\n\n256\n00:13:56.392 --> 00:13:59.784\neverybody to see.\n&gt;&gt; I should be able to understand what\n\n257\n00:13:59.784 --> 00:14:04.517\nthe message is being conveyed there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and look, take a look at that.\n\n258\n00:14:04.517 --> 00:14:08.102\nAnd I don't know if we can sort\nof go full screen on that?\n\n259\n00:14:08.102 --> 00:14:10.174\nYeah, perfect.\n\n260\n00:14:10.174 --> 00:14:13.588\nSo what we can do,\nis we can take a look at that chart.\n\n261\n00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:18.340\nAnd it will show us the actual\nprogress that we've made.\n\n262\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.365\nWe don't have to have this meeting.\n\n263\n00:14:19.365 --> 00:14:22.744\nWe don't have to talk about\nwhere we've gone so far.\n\n264\n00:14:22.744 --> 00:14:26.507\nI can see straight away that if\nyou are responsible for story B,\n\n265\n00:14:26.507 --> 00:14:28.288\nI know what you've got to do.\n\n266\n00:14:28.288 --> 00:14:31.053\nI know that you've got\nquite a lot in the backlog.\n\n267\n00:14:31.053 --> 00:14:33.697\nAnd I know that you're\nworking on some things, but\n\n268\n00:14:33.697 --> 00:14:37.150\nI also know that it doesn't look\nas though you completed too much.\n\n269\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.125\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n270\n00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:41.875\n&gt;&gt; You've fallen a bit behind, Cherokee,\n\n271\n00:14:41.875 --> 00:14:43.098\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, Jo.\n\n272\n00:14:43.098 --> 00:14:44.770\nStory of my life, right?\n\n273\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.690\nBut you guys saw,\nwell I don't know for sure, but\n\n274\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.030\nif you were watching the other episodes.\n\n275\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.747\nYou saw Rob come in and\nshow us how he prioritizes those stories.\n\n276\n00:14:52.747 --> 00:14:57.510\nBut also in our development,\nnear our development team members,\n\n277\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:03.139\ntheir area, their office space has white\nboards on the walls for this reason.\n\n278\n00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:08.239\nJust to have those BVC,\nBig Visual Charts, to go ahead and\n\n279\n00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:13.700\nkeep this information posted all the time.\n&gt;&gt; You like that acronym, don't you?\n\n280\n00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.589\nYou're gonna use that all the time now,\naren't you?\n\n281\n00:15:15.589 --> 00:15:16.837\n&gt;&gt; I gotta find a way to work\n\n282\n00:15:16.837 --> 00:15:20.860\nit into random conversations though.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You need to work it into random\n\n283\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.659\nconversations and see if any of\nthe guys actually know what it means.\n\n284\n00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:25.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll do that.\n\n285\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the way to test it.\n\n286\n00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.975\nSo other things that we will use,\nwe'll put on our BVC,\n\n287\n00:15:31.975 --> 00:15:38.261\nare things like our burn-down chart and\nalso our project burn-up chart.\n\n288\n00:15:38.261 --> 00:15:42.846\nSo I mean, an iteration burn-down chart,\nif you just look at this.\n\n289\n00:15:42.846 --> 00:15:47.893\nIt just looks to see how much we've done,\nor rather how much we've got left, sorry.\n\n290\n00:15:47.893 --> 00:15:53.270\nSo our burn-down chart there,\nyou see we started off with 400 hours.\n\n291\n00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:57.010\nWe had 400 ideal hours\nthat we had to program.\n\n292\n00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.421\nAnd where we are right now is,\nwe're actually looking,\n\n293\n00:16:00.421 --> 00:16:04.769\nI mean, if you look at the ideal,\nthe ideal by day 20 gets us down to 0.\n\n294\n00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:07.980\nIn other words,\nwe completed everything in the ideal.\n\n295\n00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.170\nBut look at where we actually are.\n&gt;&gt; It looks like we're a little bit\n\n296\n00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.000\nbehind.\n&gt;&gt; We're a little bit behind, yeah.\n\n297\n00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.350\nAnd so the idea of that,\nthat again something that goes onto our\n\n298\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:21.840\nbig visible chart, and that's something\nthat we can use just to monitor progress.\n\n299\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.450\nAnd we should be updating that.\n\n300\n00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.190\nWell, how often do you think\nwe should be updating that?\n\n301\n00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, I would say, minimum,\n\n302\n00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.666\ndaily.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n303\n00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:31.660\nwe wanna update that on a daily basis.\n\n304\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:38.560\nMaybe even twice a day, but\ncertainly never more than that.\n\n305\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.870\nYou don't want to spend time.\n\n306\n00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.320\nYou can't be up there every\nhour just marking little dots,\n\n307\n00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:42.987\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n308\n00:16:42.987 --> 00:16:44.303\n&gt;&gt; That's not gonna work.\n\n309\n00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:48.230\n[LAUGH] And is not gonna be\nan efficient use of your time as well.\n\n310\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.181\nOkay, and then you've also\ngot what we call a project\n\n311\n00:16:51.181 --> 00:16:55.330\nburn-up chart which looks at the-\n&gt;&gt; Transverse of that.\n\n312\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.116\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\n\n313\n00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:58.810\nit looks at how much we've actually done.\n\n314\n00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:04.570\nSo you can see what our plan is, and\nour plan is right at the very top.\n\n315\n00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:11.780\nOur plan is that we should be having\nan ideal number of sort of 300 stories.\n\n316\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.510\nThat's where we should be for\nour particular project.\n\n317\n00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:20.680\nBut where we actually started,\nwe actually started with 0 stories,\n\n318\n00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.570\nand now as we are on to, well,\nI'm gonna say that the bottom there or\n\n319\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:31.000\niteration, as well on to iteration 3,\nwe've had about 200 stories.\n\n320\n00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.256\nThis brings us into, it's an interesting\npoint that you mentioned in a previous\n\n321\n00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:41.896\nepisode, Cherokee, because what this does\nis this shows that the number of stories,\n\n322\n00:17:41.896 --> 00:17:47.650\nwe expect it grow,\nIf we look at the trend.\n\n323\n00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:54.720\nSo trend is the red dotted line, and\nlet's take a look at the actual trend.\n\n324\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.370\nAnd the actual right down the bottom,\nif we carry on with that trend,\n\n325\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.720\nit shows us that we started\noff with 0 iterations.\n\n326\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.880\nBut actually, we're planning,\nby the looks of things,\n\n327\n00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.728\nwe look as though we're gonna\nhave about 350 stories by\n\n328\n00:18:11.728 --> 00:18:16.410\niteration 7, because with every single\n\n329\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:21.930\niteration the number of stories grows.\n&gt;&gt; So we're becoming more efficient\n\n330\n00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:27.140\nper iteration, or as iterations progress.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the plan is that\n\n331\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:33.430\nwe should be hovering around the 300 mark.\n&gt;&gt; But a project in reality doesn't often\n\n332\n00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:38.780\nstart with 300 stories, because what we do\nat the beginning of a project, remember,\n\n333\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.540\niteration zero in a previous episode?\n&gt;&gt; The planning.\n\n334\n00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.210\n&gt;&gt; That's when we do all of our planning.\n\n335\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.180\nAnd with each iteration,\nwe will then look and\n\n336\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:53.250\nwe visit the problem statement again, and\nwe look at the stories that we've got\n\n337\n00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.760\nstill outstanding that we haven't\ncompleted, and also new stories.\n\n338\n00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.790\nRemember, an agile project\nis adaptive to change.\n\n339\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.680\nSo we add in new requirements,\nwe add in new requests.\n\n340\n00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:09.930\nSo we expect our backlog to grow\nin this particular instance.\n\n341\n00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.700\n&gt;&gt; Seems pretty accurate.\n\n342\n00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.545\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, you're grinning there,\n\n343\n00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:15.130\nI like that!\n\n344\n00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.162\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat's exactly what we should be doing,\n\n345\n00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:24.230\nis that we should be planning accurately,\nwe should be expecting.\n\n346\n00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:29.490\nIf we think that this is a project where\nexpectations are going to change or\n\n347\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.550\nrequirements are going to change,\nthen we should be planning for that.\n\n348\n00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.940\nWe should be acknowledging that that's\ngoing to happen rather than say, right,\n\n349\n00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.070\nokay, this is all we want to\ndeliberate at the very start.\n\n350\n00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.220\nAnd then cast it in stone and\nleave it at that.\n\n351\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.260\nThat's the traditional waterfall approach.\n\n352\n00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.280\nSo we have to take responsibility for\neffective and efficient communication.\n\n353\n00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.900\nSo we wanna focus on sort of\ntargeted communications, but\n\n354\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.390\nwe wanna focus on clear, concise and\n\n355\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:03.470\nunambiguous communications that answer\nthose questions, what's in it for me?\n\n356\n00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.300\nIf you're gonna bring me to a meeting,\n\n357\n00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.090\nyou're gonna invite me to a meeting,\nI need to be there for a reason.\n\n358\n00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:14.590\nIf I'm there just to sort of sit in\nthe corner and twiddle my thumbs,\n\n359\n00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.640\nthen that's not a productive\nuse of my time.\n\n360\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.390\nSo all forms of communication,\neven those emails,\n\n361\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.700\nhave got to answer what's in it for me.\n\n362\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.440\nAnd I know I've asked you this before, but\nhow many emails, what percentage of emails\n\n363\n00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.020\ndo you delete without even opening?\n&gt;&gt; Quite a bit.\n\n364\n00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.330\nI know you said you were at 90.\n\n365\n00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.350\nI don't think I'm, maybe for\nthat particular email account, but for\n\n366\n00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:40.040\nwork emails it's going to be less,\nbut it's still rather high.\n\n367\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.614\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so I find, and\n\n368\n00:20:41.614 --> 00:20:46.410\nthis is just me personally, and it's a\nrecommendation that we do make with a lot\n\n369\n00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.152\nof sort of organizations that\ndeal with external customers.\n\n370\n00:20:50.152 --> 00:20:54.920\nWe'll have two different email addresses,\none that's an internal email address.\n\n371\n00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.484\nIt's for all of our work and our internal\ncommunications, and more specifically,\n\n372\n00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:04.570\nsort of for the project communication or\nany internal work issues.\n\n373\n00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.500\nAnd you can do this by just having\ntwo mailboxes within one account, for\n\n374\n00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.490\ninstance, and\n\n375\n00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:14.260\nhaving rules in place so that we can\nfilter certain emails that come in.\n\n376\n00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.400\nIn our internal emails,\n\n377\n00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.370\nwe probably only delete about\n5% of them without reading them.\n\n378\n00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:23.059\nBut external emails,\nwhich tend to be marketing type emails or\n\n379\n00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:26.965\nany other type email, then-\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it gets past the spam filter.\n\n380\n00:21:26.965 --> 00:21:29.574\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's a good chance that a lot\n\n381\n00:21:29.574 --> 00:21:34.870\nof that of it's not caught by a spam\nfilter that you still delete lot of that.\n\n382\n00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:40.769\nSo how effective is that communication?\n&gt;&gt; A lot of time is wasted,\n\n383\n00:21:40.769 --> 00:21:43.489\nMuda, on-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah,\n\n384\n00:21:43.489 --> 00:21:49.050\na lot of time is Muda as we saw\nin Kanban and in Lean as well.\n\n385\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.180\nIt's time wasted.\n\n386\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.110\nBut it's not really,\nbecause we don't open them.\n\n387\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.070\nSo it's time wasted on behalf of those\n\n388\n00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.530\nother organizations that\nhave tried to market us.\n\n389\n00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.951\nWhat it does do, though,\n\n390\n00:22:01.951 --> 00:22:05.909\nis it does irritate us.\n&gt;&gt; It also affects network performance\n\n391\n00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:08.250\ntoo, it can.\n&gt;&gt; It affects network performance.\n\n392\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.560\nIt does affect our performance a little\nbit but it does also as I say,\n\n393\n00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.770\nit irritates us.\n\n394\n00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.669\nAnd if we're feeling irritated,\nhow productive are we?\n\n395\n00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:16.615\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:22:16.615 --> 00:22:17.635\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n397\n00:22:17.635 --> 00:22:20.983\n&gt;&gt; What if I'm irritated right now, Jo,\n\n398\n00:22:20.983 --> 00:22:23.980\nhow do you know?\n&gt;&gt; I could tell, I could tell, yeah.\n\n399\n00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.118\n[LAUGH] But yeah-\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n400\n00:22:26.118 --> 00:22:27.869\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we're irritated by something,\n\n401\n00:22:27.869 --> 00:22:29.531\nwe're not generally very productive.\n\n402\n00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:31.480\nIn fact-\n&gt;&gt; You gotta get your mind right.\n\n403\n00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're\n\n404\n00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.820\nmore likely to decide, you know what?\n\n405\n00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.500\nI'm gonna go and get a coffee\nrather than deal with anything.\n\n406\n00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.599\nAnd that's even more unproductive\ntime out of your day.\n\n407\n00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:47.180\nSo communication, if it's ineffective,\nthen we shouldn't do it.\n\n408\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.640\nThink about Lean principles.\n\n409\n00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.150\nThink about direct conversations as well.\n\n410\n00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.730\nIt's much easier to achieve\na resolution with a conversation.\n\n411\n00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.430\nNow that doesn't mean that\nwe don't write it down.\n\n412\n00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:02.810\nBecause even though we'll say that\nwe'll value collaboration over\n\n413\n00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:06.880\nthings like contract negotiation,\nwe still need to have things written down.\n\n414\n00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.850\nThis is what we agreed.\n\n415\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.362\nSo we should still write things, but\nnevertheless we achieve more with\n\n416\n00:23:12.362 --> 00:23:15.660\nface-to-face communication\nwith just a simple discussion.\n\n417\n00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:21.710\nSo communicate regularly and frequently,\nbut communicate only what is needed.\n\n418\n00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.845\nNow of course, something that's very\nclose to our heart is the daily\n\n419\n00:23:25.845 --> 00:23:26.830\nstand-up meeting.\n\n420\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:32.790\nAnd that daily stand-up is literally\nwhere we discuss exactly what we're\n\n421\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.500\nall going to be doing in that day and what\nwe achieved in the previous day as well.\n\n422\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.120\nSo it involves the core team.\n\n423\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.900\nIt involves the project team.\n\n424\n00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:48.980\nIt doesn't necessarily include the product\nowner, so who should chair that and\n\n425\n00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.522\nmake sure that it runs on time?\n&gt;&gt; Share the daily stand-up?\n\n426\n00:23:52.522 --> 00:23:53.532\n&gt;&gt; No, chair it.\n\n427\n00:23:53.532 --> 00:23:54.762\n&gt;&gt; Chair it, okay.\n\n428\n00:23:54.762 --> 00:23:59.664\nSo that should be the,\nhold on, the one on the top,\n\n429\n00:23:59.664 --> 00:24:00.565\nthe-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n430\n00:24:00.565 --> 00:24:02.237\n&gt;&gt; I'm drawing a blank right now.\n\n431\n00:24:02.237 --> 00:24:03.532\nNot the project manager.\n\n432\n00:24:03.532 --> 00:24:08.355\nBut the, one second, it's there, hold on,\n\n433\n00:24:08.355 --> 00:24:12.230\nscrum master.\n&gt;&gt; I'd fallen asleep,\n\n434\n00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.232\nsorry, what did she say?\n\n435\n00:24:13.232 --> 00:24:15.092\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that was painful to get that out.\n\n436\n00:24:15.092 --> 00:24:17.177\n&gt;&gt; It was, it was very painful from this\n\n437\n00:24:17.177 --> 00:24:18.749\nside as well.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n438\n00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:20.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the scrum master because\n\n439\n00:24:20.765 --> 00:24:23.160\nthe scrum master has\nthat responsibility for\n\n440\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.650\nfacilitating the team efficiency.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n441\n00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.450\n&gt;&gt; So it is the scrum master.\n\n442\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.185\nIt doesn't necessarily have\nto include the product owner.\n\n443\n00:24:31.185 --> 00:24:36.130\nI'd like to\n\n444\n00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:41.850\nsay that only on rare occasions should\nwe really not include the product owner.\n\n445\n00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:47.060\nThe product owner needs to be as\nproductive as anybody else, fair enough.\n\n446\n00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.230\nBut it's only for 15 minutes,\nand if there are any conflicts or\n\n447\n00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:54.750\nany issues amongst the team\nthat require his intervention,\n\n448\n00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.880\nit's much easier to intervene\nat that point in time.\n\n449\n00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.895\nIt should literally just be a 15 minute\nmeeting and we should be standing up.\n\n450\n00:25:02.895 --> 00:25:06.875\nAnd the reason for that is then because if\nwe're sitting down we're more comfortable\n\n451\n00:25:06.875 --> 00:25:11.175\nand then we're more likely to\nsort of go over the 15 minutes.\n\n452\n00:25:11.175 --> 00:25:13.530\nSo, it should be 15 minutes,\n\n453\n00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.040\nno more than that, stood up where\nwe just simply go around the team.\n\n454\n00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.690\nWe discussed what we\naccomplished yesterday, and\n\n455\n00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.960\nthen what we plan on doing today.\n\n456\n00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:27.230\nAnd then if there are any issues or if\nthere are any problems that we can see or\n\n457\n00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:32.020\nany conflicts, you give somebody else the\nopportunity to interrupt and to say, hey,\n\n458\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.320\nlook, I can help you with that.\n\n459\n00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.947\nSo, that's what our daily stand up is, and\nit should just be very short and sweet.\n\n460\n00:25:38.947 --> 00:25:44.152\nSo, in large organizations, and\nwe see this as well ourselves,\n\n461\n00:25:44.152 --> 00:25:48.317\nin large organizations\ninformation radiators, or\n\n462\n00:25:48.317 --> 00:25:51.850\nthose boards, the big visible charts.\n\n463\n00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:54.690\nYou might not be able\nto scale them because\n\n464\n00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.290\nit's okay while we're\nonly on one location.\n\n465\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.370\nBut when we're not only on one location,\nlike with 4,000 miles apart,\n\n466\n00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:05.120\nlike our office in England, the it's\nreally difficult then to scale that.\n\n467\n00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.220\nSo we have to think of other communication\nchannels then traditional ones,\n\n468\n00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.200\nlike,, the ones we mentioned so\nfar, email,\n\n469\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:17.180\ninstant messaging and just simple\npresentations or even something like this.\n\n470\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:17.960\nYou know, nowadays,\n\n471\n00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.020\na lot of organizations will go in for\nwebinars or brown bag sessions.\n\n472\n00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.060\nThey'll also go in for\nwhat we call town hall meetings.\n\n473\n00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.900\nAnd a lot of organizations will\nactually communicate in this way.\n\n474\n00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.510\nWhere if I've got something that I\nwant to communicate to everybody and\n\n475\n00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.680\neverybody is all over the world,\n\n476\n00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:42.210\nthen what I will do is I'll communicate to\nthe core team here what I haven't videod.\n\n477\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.450\nSo then that video is then\nshown to all the teams around\n\n478\n00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:46.810\nthe world.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n479\n00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.930\n&gt;&gt; And that makes most efficient use of my\n\n480\n00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.590\ntime, as well as making most efficient\nuse of everybody else's time.\n\n481\n00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.870\nSo there's no right or wrong way.\n\n482\n00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:00.470\nYou just have to find the way that's\nappropriate for your organization.\n\n483\n00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.710\nWhat you've also gotta do and\n\n484\n00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:07.370\ntalk about planning communication,\nI know that on a Monday morning\n\n485\n00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:12.080\nwhen I open up my email I'm going to get\nan email from one particular person.\n\n486\n00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.080\nAnd I'm gonna get an email\nfrom somebody else and\n\n487\n00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.000\nI'm gonna get an email from Cherokee,\nand that's planned and I expect that.\n\n488\n00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.720\nSo I know that I'm gonna get that email so\nI'm waiting for it and\n\n489\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.420\nI'm going to open it.\n\n490\n00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.360\nIt's a planned communication method.\n\n491\n00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.260\nIf you start off by communicating\nwith the team in a certain way,\n\n492\n00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.960\nthat becomes expected.\n&gt;&gt; So, like just going in and like\n\n493\n00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:43.060\nrandomly switching communication channels,\nis not necessarily the right thing to do?\n\n494\n00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.155\nMight be fun.\n\n495\n00:27:44.155 --> 00:27:46.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, with a previous, and\n\n496\n00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.270\nI mean it might be fun.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just,\n\n497\n00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.790\njust to see people get yeah, crazy.\n\n498\n00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.360\nCuz that's what will happen.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz that's really, really gonna\n\n499\n00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.180\nhelp the efficiency of the project, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n500\n00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.150\n&gt;&gt; If you switch up your communication\n\n501\n00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.130\nmethods, and you don't tell\neverybody you're doing that, then\n\n502\n00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.830\nif all of a sudden I started receiving\na text from you instead of an email,\n\n503\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.180\nI might think to myself,\nthat's not important, it's just a text.\n\n504\n00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.650\nYou can't just switch\ncommunication methods.\n\n505\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, that was sarcasm.\n\n506\n00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.580\nI don't know if I conveyed that\nin my communication very well.\n\n507\n00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.490\n&gt;&gt; No, no,\n\n508\n00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.740\nwhat it was was unproductiveness and\nwe don't like that in a project.\n\n509\n00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.740\n&gt;&gt; Distractions.\n\n510\n00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, it was a distraction.\n\n511\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.120\nSo yeah, we wanna be productive, don't\nswitch up your communication methods.\n\n512\n00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.230\nThink about who you're communicating to,\nwhat language it should be in, but also\n\n513\n00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:43.700\nwhat medium is more important for and more\nrelevant for that particular audience.\n\n514\n00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.500\nSome people like emails.\n\n515\n00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.700\nOther people like instant messaging.\n\n516\n00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.780\nSome people are worried about,\nsay, audit trails for instance,\n\n517\n00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.250\nso they actually want more\nthan just instant messaging.\n\n518\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.870\nBut some people are quite\nhappy with the conversation.\n\n519\n00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:01.741\nThink about the medium and\nthink about the message you're conveying.\n\n520\n00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:06.022\nYou do not want to be notified of,\nsay, a reduction in your hours or\n\n521\n00:29:06.022 --> 00:29:09.470\nmaybe a reduction in your\nsalary by text message.\n\n522\n00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.900\n&gt;&gt; That'd be awful.\n\n523\n00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.800\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n524\n00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.100\nSo think about the medium of\nthe communication because it really is\n\n525\n00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.790\nimportant to the message that\nyou're trying to convey.\n\n526\n00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:23.210\nIf you use a more informal communication\nmethod then it's considered to be a less\n\n527\n00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.190\nimportant message that\nyou're communicating.\n\n528\n00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.538\nSo make sure, and really just to wrap\nthis session up on communication,\n\n529\n00:29:32.538 --> 00:29:35.940\nmake sure that you understand\nwho your audience is.\n\n530\n00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.160\nHow often they want to receive\ntheir communication, and\n\n531\n00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.240\nhow you're gonna communicate.\n\n532\n00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.480\nAnd think about what is actually\ngoing to be the most efficient and\n\n533\n00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.000\nmost effective for\nthe delivery of that increment.\n\n534\n00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:48.750\nAnd, overall, for\n\n535\n00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.020\nthe delivery of the project.\n&gt;&gt; All right, and great,\n\n536\n00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.740\nthank you so much, and Jo, and\nthank you guys for joining us as well,\n\n537\n00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.530\nbut we're gonna sign out.\n\n538\n00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.206\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:06.385\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:08.440\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.100\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.420\nWelcome everyone to your\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.430\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.750\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look\nat how to plan our iteration capacity.\n\n9\n00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.720\nAnd with us today back in\nthe studios we have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.770\nThanks for stopping by Jo.\n\n11\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.010\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm fine thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.900\nHow are you Cherokee?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.940\nWe've spoken quite a bit about\niterations but right, and\n\n14\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.970\nnow on this show we're gonna be\nlooking at them individually, correct?\n\n15\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n16\n00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.080\nWe're gonna be looking at\nindividual iterations.\n\n17\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.020\nBefore, on previous episodes,\nwe looked at working out and\n\n18\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.680\nestimating the amount of effort needed for\nindividual user stories.\n\n19\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.150\nAnd now we have that estimation in place.\n\n20\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.790\nAnd we understand how much each user\nstory is going to take in terms of\n\n21\n00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.400\nideal days and in terms of effort.\n\n22\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.590\nNow what we can do is we can work\nout exactly what's going to go in to\n\n23\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.060\neach iteration.\n\n24\n00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.170\nSo we can divide our power iterations and\n\n25\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.480\nthen we can plan the iteration\nto deliver those user stories.\n\n26\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.150\nBearing in mind that the iteration\nshould last between one and four weeks.\n\n27\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.740\nSo, and we want to deliver\nconsistent number of iterations,\n\n28\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.120\na consistent length of iterations\nthroughout our project.\n\n29\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.940\nSo, we don't want is we looked at\nyesterday, or in a previous episode,\n\n30\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.940\nwe don't want one iteration of one week\nand then another of four weeks and\n\n31\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.070\nthen another iteration of one week.\n\n32\n00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.910\nWe don't want that effect.\n\n33\n00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.630\nWhat we want is to have\nconsistency in our iterations.\n\n34\n00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.830\nSo now what we've got to do is we got\nto take all of our user stories and\n\n35\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.870\nwe've got to say, right, okay,\nwell which ones can we put in where.\n\n36\n00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.350\nBearing in mind,\n\n37\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.240\nthat there could be dependencies between\nsome of our user stories as well.\n\n38\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.490\nAnd again in a previous episode yesterday,\nwe looked at the epic stories and\n\n39\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.990\nwe looked at splitting up user stories and\ndividing said functionality into two.\n\n40\n00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.890\nSo if you want to deliver\nfingerprint capacity or\n\n41\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.960\nfingerprint functionality to a telephone.\n\n42\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.402\nA mobile phone handset.\n\n43\n00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:13.280\nThen you've got to deliver\nboth the software and\n\n44\n00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.920\nyou also got to deliver the hardware\nthat is capable of doing that.\n\n45\n00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.165\nNow, each one of those,\nit's one user story.\n\n46\n00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:25.585\nAnd as much as you want to delivery\nfingerprint capability, but\n\n47\n00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:26.935\nyou have to split it into two.\n\n48\n00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:29.055\nAnd one is dependent on the other.\n\n49\n00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:31.365\nAnd in fact, they're both\nequally dependent on the other,\n\n50\n00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:34.625\nbecause you need to have the software\nin order to use the hardware, but\n\n51\n00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:38.260\nyou need to have the hardware in\norder to be able to use the software.\n\n52\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.310\nAnd that's what we're\nlooking at right now.\n\n53\n00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.770\nWhat we're looking at is\nplanning all of our iterations so\n\n54\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.490\nthat they are of an even length.\n\n55\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.200\nAnd I mean an even length in terms\nof number of ideal days that we use.\n\n56\n00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.060\nSo an even length in terms\nof the length of iteration.\n\n57\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.650\nBut also planning the iterations so\nthat we can manage our dependencies and\n\n58\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.975\nensure that the user stories we put\nin there are actually achievable.\n\n59\n00:03:04.975 --> 00:03:06.740\nThat you can't deliver\none without the other,\n\n60\n00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.280\nin that example that I gave you, but\nsometimes it's a lot more cut and dry than\n\n61\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.440\nthat in that we have to have an operating\nsystem before we can have an app.\n\n62\n00:03:15.735 --> 00:03:19.950\nWe've got to make sure that we get all\nthose dependencies in the right order\n\n63\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.070\nas well.\n\n64\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.966\nSo, think about the fact that Agile\nlooks at self-organizing teams.\n\n65\n00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:28.320\nSelf-organizing teams means, and\n\n66\n00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.130\nplease take a look at previous episodes\nwhere we have explored estimation, and\n\n67\n00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.410\nwe've explored prioritization\nas well of our user stories.\n\n68\n00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.920\nSelf-organizing teams means\nthat we decide between us\n\n69\n00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.330\nexactly what we want to\nput into each iteration.\n\n70\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.020\nSo we're going to say,\nwe can work on both of these together and\n\n71\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.701\nwe can do these in one iteration.\n\n72\n00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.552\nWho is it that has the ultimate decision?\n&gt;&gt; That is going to fall under the scrum\n\n73\n00:03:57.552 --> 00:03:59.240\nmaster's obligation.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n74\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.520\nit's not.\n&gt;&gt; Dang it.\n\n75\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.430\nIs going to be the product owner.\n&gt;&gt; Well okay, so-\n\n76\n00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.392\n&gt;&gt; I mean, yeah,\n\n77\n00:04:05.392 --> 00:04:08.602\nI'm narrowing down my chances here, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n78\n00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:12.120\nthe scrum master is responsible for\nmaking sure that the team work together.\n\n79\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.680\nBut the product owner takes the\naccountability for what the team works on\n\n80\n00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.390\nfor the actual product itself.\n&gt;&gt; So Jo I just have to confess,\n\n81\n00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.060\nI'm not the best with\n&gt;&gt; Memory?\n\n82\n00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.915\n&gt;&gt; No, not memory, I actually,\n\n83\n00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:28.290\n[LAUGH] I can't remember things sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; Seems that\n\n84\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.370\nway to me.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n85\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.730\nit's deciphering those\ninterpersonal skills.\n\n86\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.000\nLike being in IT, I'm good with technical,\nI'm good with black and white,\n\n87\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.140\nsometimes understanding the skill.\n\n88\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.900\nSo I'm thinking, in my mind,\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if I'm the product owner, and\n\n89\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.250\nalso were reforming those teams,\nI'm thinking about things like norming,\n\n90\n00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.540\nstorming and forming those things that\nare naturally occurring with humans.\n\n91\n00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.580\nBut you're thinking more so hey, who has\nthis skill set, who has that skill set and\n\n92\n00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.280\npairing them together, not from the,\nintra-personal aspect.\n\n93\n00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.466\nI just want to clarify cuz I'm\na little awkward at times.\n\n94\n00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:05.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n95\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.237\nSo, think about it this way and\nI'll try and put it as simply as I can.\n\n96\n00:05:09.237 --> 00:05:12.217\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you.\n\n97\n00:05:12.217 --> 00:05:16.780\n&gt;&gt; The scrum master looks at how we work.\n\n98\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.090\nLooks at how we get on.\n\n99\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.690\nAnd the product owner looks at what\n\n100\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.240\nwe work on.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n101\n00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.390\n&gt;&gt; So the product owner is responsible for\n\n102\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.140\nwhat we're doing.\n&gt;&gt; So he or\n\n103\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.880\nshe can assign us based upon that?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n104\n00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:41.000\nSo he or she, the product owner will take\nthe responsibility for what we're doing.\n\n105\n00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.540\nBased on our skill set.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n106\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.230\n&gt;&gt; So the product owner is interested\n\n107\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.830\nin our skills.\n\n108\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.630\nThe product owner is interested in how\nquickly we can achieve a certain outcome.\n\n109\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.710\nAnd the product owner is interested\nin what outcomes we can achieve.\n\n110\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.190\nThat's the product owner.\n\n111\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.880\nSo, and\nhe'll take the ultimate accountability for\n\n112\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.090\nthe functionality of\nthe actual product itself.\n\n113\n00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.140\nThe scrum master make sure that\nthe team works cohesively and\n\n114\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.210\ncollaboratively as a team.\n\n115\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.420\nSo the scrum master makes sure that\nall of the meetings are facilitated.\n\n116\n00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.830\nThe scrum master makes sure\nthat if we've got any conflict.\n\n117\n00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.930\nBecause, quite frankly,\nI can't take any more.\n\n118\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.450\nBut then the scrum master\ngets involved in that.\n\n119\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I do remember you saying that.\n\n120\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.880\nBut just in certain areas,\nalmost the two kind of overlap.\n\n121\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.110\nBut I guess.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n122\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.440\nAnd we have got a previous\nepisode on roles as well\n\n123\n00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.250\nthat we looked at within the Agile\nproject that defines those.\n\n124\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.950\nBut yes, the product owner takes\naccountability for the actual\n\n125\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.190\nproduct itself, so the product owner is\ngoing to have a huge influence on this.\n\n126\n00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.820\nBut it's going to be the scrum master that\ncould potentially come along and say,\n\n127\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.910\nyou know you want this in a four-week\niteration, but I have to tell you now that\n\n128\n00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.320\nCherokee's got two week's vacation\nduring that particular iteration.\n\n129\n00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.380\nSo if you want to put that\nmany user stories in there,\n\n130\n00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.330\nit's not going to be\nachievable in the four weeks.\n\n131\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.220\nSo the scrum master is responsible.\n\n132\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.590\nThink of the scrum master\nas being the HR person.\n\n133\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you know what I was just\n\n134\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.790\nthinking, and\nmaybe in the sense of a PMO for\n\n135\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.350\na project management office if they\nwere in charge of scheduling resources.\n\n136\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.930\nIf you had to pull Cherokee\noff of this project\n\n137\n00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.420\nthis week to go put her on\na different project, right?\n\n138\n00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.821\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the role of the PMO.\n\n139\n00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:38.720\nOr in ITIL terms you might look at\nthat as the design coordinator.\n\n140\n00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.450\nSo it's the role of, it's an HR person.\n\n141\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.400\nIt's somebody who is going to\ndo the interpersonal things.\n\n142\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.027\nWho's going to manage\nthe efficiency of the team.\n\n143\n00:07:51.027 --> 00:07:54.375\nOr as the product donor\ntakes accountability for\n\n144\n00:07:54.375 --> 00:08:00.185\nthe actual product itself, they take\naccountability for what you're producing.\n\n145\n00:08:00.185 --> 00:08:04.296\nSo when it comes to planning the iteration\ncapacity, the product owner will\n\n146\n00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:08.870\nmake the decision as to what's\ngoing to appear in which iteration.\n\n147\n00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.130\nNow we also mentioned that\nthe workload should be achievable.\n\n148\n00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.880\nThe product owner and the scrum master\nhave gotta work together on this.\n\n149\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.840\nBecause the scrum master,\nlike I've already said,\n\n150\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.146\nis going to tell us whether some\npeople go away on vacation.\n\n151\n00:08:23.146 --> 00:08:28.164\nBut also the product owner's gonna say\nwell, this is what skills Cherokee has.\n\n152\n00:08:28.164 --> 00:08:28.767\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n153\n00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:31.860\nthey do have to be close cuz\nsometimes they could overlap.\n\n154\n00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.170\nSay, hey, look, Jo and I, we both have\nthis one particular, I don't know,\n\n155\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.500\nlike Rob was talking about\nthis morning for Haskell.\n\n156\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.890\nSo maybe both you and I code in Haskell.\n\n157\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.520\nBut Jo doesn't like this person or\nI don't like that person and\n\n158\n00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.570\nyou really get along with them.\n\n159\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.739\nSo it's kind of like they have to talk\nabout it and work those out to make\n\n160\n00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:53.646\nthe best decision for the team, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and it's a bit like\n\n161\n00:08:53.646 --> 00:08:59.000\nwe've got somebody that will control\nthe content that we're delivering here.\n\n162\n00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.806\nAnd then we've got somebody else that\nwill control who's working with whom.\n\n163\n00:09:02.806 --> 00:09:04.965\nAnd you put me with Justin and\nwe'll kill each other.\n\n164\n00:09:04.965 --> 00:09:07.348\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:09:07.348 --> 00:09:08.165\n&gt;&gt; That sort of thing.\n\n166\n00:09:08.165 --> 00:09:09.549\nYeah?\n\n167\n00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.312\nDoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just can't work with Justin\n\n168\n00:09:12.312 --> 00:09:16.531\nbecause I laugh the whole time and nothing\ngets accomplished, so they'd be like,\n\n169\n00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:19.183\ndon't put them together.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Justin has got\n\n170\n00:09:19.183 --> 00:09:20.732\nnothing to do with that at all.\n\n171\n00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:28.630\nSo the product owner and the scrum master\nwork together to plan the iteration.\n\n172\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.520\nBut really, it's the product owner\nthat takes that accountability.\n\n173\n00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.790\nSo they're gonna break\ndown the user story and\n\n174\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.010\nwe've already seen about how we can do\nour assessments for our user stories.\n\n175\n00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.690\nBut an assessment.\n\n176\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.710\nWhat was an assessment?\n\n177\n00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.530\n&gt;&gt; Just.\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n178\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.720\nwas an estimation.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n179\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.030\n&gt;&gt; Now we're looking at\n\n180\n00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.070\nthe actual work that's really involved.\n\n181\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.680\nSo this is where we do\nour accurate planning.\n\n182\n00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.670\nSo, of course, the product owner\nis going to be involved in that.\n\n183\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.470\nThe product owner's gonna have to\nhelp us with our accurate planning.\n\n184\n00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.970\nAnd it's here where we identify\nour true dependencies.\n\n185\n00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.935\nIt's here where we look\nat the priority and\n\n186\n00:10:09.935 --> 00:10:13.925\nevaluate the assessment for\nevery single story.\n\n187\n00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:19.295\nAnd what we want to do is we actually\nwant to now elaborate on those\n\n188\n00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:24.605\nestimations and convert them into\nreal days as opposed to ideal days.\n\n189\n00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:27.825\nIdeal days is where we think\n\n190\n00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.620\nour productiveness is going to be.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n191\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Ideal days is what we think, okay,\n\n192\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.390\nwe know we're only productive for\n50% of our time, but\n\n193\n00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:41.150\nnow we've got to convert\nthat into real days.\n\n194\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.082\nAnd that means being\nincredibly objective and\n\n195\n00:10:45.082 --> 00:10:50.336\nthat also means committing to\ndelivering within those days.\n\n196\n00:10:50.336 --> 00:10:53.972\nNow we all know that things\nchange on a daily basis.\n\n197\n00:10:53.972 --> 00:10:54.734\nRight?\nAnd\n\n198\n00:10:54.734 --> 00:10:58.190\nwe all know that unexpected things pop up.\n\n199\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.170\nYou might need to go to the dentist or\nsomething like that.\n\n200\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.630\nSo if you've committed to delivering\nfunctionality within two days,\n\n201\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.470\ngiven that each task should\ntake less than two days,\n\n202\n00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.440\nif you've committed to delivering that,\nand\n\n203\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.840\nthen unfortunately maybe something happens\nand you can't make it into work one day,\n\n204\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.500\nthen that user story is\ngoing to be affected.\n\n205\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.780\nThis is where we commit.\n\n206\n00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.480\nSo this is why we've got a plan for\neach iteration.\n\n207\n00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.660\nNow in Agile, we're talking efficiencies,\n\n208\n00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.620\nwe're talking effectiveness,\nwe're talking lean.\n\n209\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:40.550\nSo we want to make sure that we\nare planning for what needs to be done,\n\n210\n00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.930\nso only those things that should be\nin that iteration, nothing else.\n\n211\n00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.630\nAnd we also wanna make sure that we plan\nto the level of detail that's needed so\n\n212\n00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.650\nthat we can actually develop.\n\n213\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.780\nBut we don't want to over-plan, we don't\nlike to have too much documentation,\n\n214\n00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.990\nwe don't want over-engineer, and\n\n215\n00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:04.720\nwe don't want to include anything that\nis not included in that iteration.\n\n216\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.950\nBut remember, we also called our\niteration's time boxes as well,\n\n217\n00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.720\nas you can see on that\nparticular diagram there.\n\n218\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.670\nSo for every single iteration,\nwe should have a work plan.\n\n219\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:20.680\nAnd that work plan will detail what\nis included in that iteration.\n\n220\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.760\nAnd in that particular work plan,\nthat's when we assign our own issues.\n\n221\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.538\nSo Cherokee,\nyou're gonna own task number one.\n\n222\n00:12:30.538 --> 00:12:33.965\nAnd I will take in ownership\nof task number two.\n\n223\n00:12:33.965 --> 00:12:35.315\nOkay?\nAnd that's what we do.\n\n224\n00:12:35.315 --> 00:12:39.267\nWe'll identify what tasks are needed,\nbearing in mind that for\n\n225\n00:12:39.267 --> 00:12:43.890\nany particular functionality,\nwe might have more than one task.\n\n226\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:49.090\nSo for any user story, so far what we've\ndone is we've estimated the priorities and\n\n227\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.190\nwe've estimated the amount of time for\neach particular story but\n\n228\n00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:57.650\neach particular story will be\nmade up of individual tasks.\n\n229\n00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.460\nSo what we're going to do now,\nlet's say we've got 4\n\n230\n00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:05.450\nuser stories in this iteration, each one\nof those user stories could have 20 tasks.\n\n231\n00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.680\nSo now we've got 80 tasks that we've\ngot to manage in that iteration.\n\n232\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.480\nSo what we're doing is we've divided\nup the work into bite-sized chunks\n\n233\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.565\nthat allows us to balance it.\n\n234\n00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:22.605\nAnd we talk about these big visible jobs.\n\n235\n00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:26.306\nWell, here we go, this is what this\nshould really, really look like.\n\n236\n00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:29.306\nOkay?\nAnd we've got H, M, and L,\n\n237\n00:13:29.306 --> 00:13:34.080\nany idea what that means?\n&gt;&gt; Maybe they're like initials for\n\n238\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.590\na first name,\nwhoever is taking responsibility for\n\n239\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.986\nthat particular task.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n240\n00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:45.829\nmaybe they're sort of priorities of\ntasks of what needs to be done first,\n\n241\n00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:48.912\nlike high, medium, and low.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n242\n00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:55.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I was looking at, if there's\n\n243\n00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.400\nan H in the columns, so I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; It actually tells you on\n\n244\n00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.611\nthe bottom.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n245\n00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:01.895\nWell, see?\nI can't see.\n\n246\n00:14:01.895 --> 00:14:07.096\nSo, I'm like half-blind, but.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the priority is inherited from\n\n247\n00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:12.590\nthe story but we just wanna categorize\nthem into the high, medium, and low.\n\n248\n00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.200\nWhat's the most important?\n\n249\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:20.210\nThere may be, there may be an instance\nwhen we don't complete all of our tasks\n\n250\n00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.730\nand which ones should we work on first.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I also see, then, right\n\n251\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:28.280\nafter you said that, I'm thinking, okay,\nwell, then why are high importance at\n\n252\n00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.390\nthe top of the list, but I see that those\nbeing denoted as dependencies, so that's\n\n253\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.190\nanother thing that we should think about.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n254\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.900\nwe've gotta think about dependencies, too.\n\n255\n00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:43.650\nThe highest task that I have might\nbe dependent on your highest task.\n\n256\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.280\nAnd your highest task\nmight not be completed for\n\n257\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.440\nthree days which means that\nI can't start on mine.\n\n258\n00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.020\nIt's a highest priority but\nI can't do anything about it.\n\n259\n00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.160\nSo I'm gonna work on that medium one.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n260\n00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.420\ncuz you're not just gonna-\n&gt;&gt; If I'm the person on the left, if mine\n\n261\n00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:05.210\nis the task list on the left, then you see\nI've got two Hs that are depending on you.\n\n262\n00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.881\nIf you have the middle, then absolutely\nbecause you're a super duper person.\n\n263\n00:15:08.881 --> 00:15:09.414\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n264\n00:15:09.414 --> 00:15:11.063\nwhy are you giving me all\nthe high priority things?\n\n265\n00:15:11.063 --> 00:15:14.993\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're a super duper person,\n\n266\n00:15:14.993 --> 00:15:18.570\nyour scales are fantastic.\n\n267\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.300\nSo you've got all of the Hs and\n\n268\n00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.980\nyou've prioritized them in that\nway along with the product owner.\n\n269\n00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.990\nHe's helped you to do that.\n\n270\n00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.670\nYou've prioritized them in that way so\n\n271\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:32.500\nI know that I can't do my two\nhighs until you've finished yours.\n\n272\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.784\nSo I'm gonna start working on\nto the next one down which for\n\n273\n00:15:35.784 --> 00:15:37.976\nme is going to be a medium.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n274\n00:15:37.976 --> 00:15:38.518\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n275\n00:15:38.518 --> 00:15:41.468\nAnd so I'm gonna work on those\nuntil you've finished those\n\n276\n00:15:41.468 --> 00:15:44.388\ntwo particular highs and then\n&gt;&gt; The pressure is unreal here.\n\n277\n00:15:44.388 --> 00:15:46.444\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, that's what you get for\n\n278\n00:15:46.444 --> 00:15:47.970\nhaving all of these skills.\n\n279\n00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:48.850\nWhat can I say?\n\n280\n00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.005\nSo that's how we progress through.\n\n281\n00:15:53.005 --> 00:15:57.542\nAnd with every, think about as well and\nwe've got in our boards,\n\n282\n00:15:57.542 --> 00:16:01.750\nwe have got You know, we're gonna to\nbe moving those sticky notes around and\n\n283\n00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.598\nwe're going to right,\nthat's one's finished.\n\n284\n00:16:04.598 --> 00:16:06.986\nThis one's in progress or\nthis one's completed.\n\n285\n00:16:06.986 --> 00:16:10.623\nSo we want to use those\nboards as visibility so\n\n286\n00:16:10.623 --> 00:16:13.974\nthat we can see what's been completed and\n\n287\n00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:19.890\nwe can actually monitor progress\nas we're going through each day.\n\n288\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.280\nAnd if we go to our previous\n\n289\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.650\nepisode where we looked at monitoring\nprogress and we looked at visibility and\n\n290\n00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:32.750\ncommunication then we can put\nthose onto our burn down charts.\n\n291\n00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.510\nThis is exactly how far\nwe've got to go and\n\n292\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:42.105\nour burn up charts which is this\nis exactly how far we've got.\n\n293\n00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:46.934\nNot forgetting that for\nevery single task that we complete,\n\n294\n00:16:46.934 --> 00:16:49.688\nwe have to make sure that it works.\n\n295\n00:16:49.688 --> 00:16:54.138\nSo we have to test all of our tasks,\nwe have to test each iteration.\n\n296\n00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:58.840\nNow you might test your tasks individually\nbut that might not be efficient.\n\n297\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.410\nAnd we wouldn't necessarily recommend\nthat you test each and every task.\n\n298\n00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.640\nBecause especially where there's\ndependencies if I go back to that board.\n\n299\n00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.410\nSo the two that I'm working on\nare dependant on the two that you're\n\n300\n00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:10.930\nworking on.\n\n301\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.830\nBut you may not be able to test\nthe two that you're working on until\n\n302\n00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.030\nI finish mine.\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n303\n00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.350\n&gt;&gt; You know, let's go back\n\n304\n00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.750\nto that finger print thing again.\n\n305\n00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.570\nIf wer're talking about finger\nprint sort of capability,\n\n306\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.420\nI can't test that the functionality\nof my software works until you\n\n307\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.190\nfinish the hardware.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n308\n00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.052\n&gt;&gt; But you can't test that the hardware\n\n309\n00:17:31.052 --> 00:17:31.968\nworks\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n310\n00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.325\n&gt;&gt; Until I finish the software.\n\n311\n00:17:33.325 --> 00:17:36.604\nAll right, so\nthere may be interdependencies there, so\n\n312\n00:17:36.604 --> 00:17:41.248\nwe might not necessarily want to test each\nparticular task in any great debt, but\n\n313\n00:17:41.248 --> 00:17:45.343\nwe still need to check that we have\ndone exactly what we set out to do, and\n\n314\n00:17:45.343 --> 00:17:47.698\nthat we've done it within time as well.\n\n315\n00:17:47.698 --> 00:17:52.594\nAnd also, on that I like the making\neverybody aware of responsibilities that I\n\n316\n00:17:52.594 --> 00:17:58.518\nknow exactly what you're working on, and\nyou know exactly what I'm working on.\n\n317\n00:17:58.518 --> 00:18:03.140\nAgain, our standup meeting's gonna help\nus with that, so we've got no overlap\n\n318\n00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.500\nin any activities at all,\nbecause we're thinking about efficiency.\n\n319\n00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:13.290\nSo we have testing types and the next two\nslides just simply look at the various\n\n320\n00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.490\ntesting types that we have within Agile,\nbut within IT in general.\n\n321\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.280\nIt's up to you what type\nof test you want to use.\n\n322\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.110\nAnd so\nthis list is not particularly exhaustive.\n\n323\n00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.150\nIt's not a definitive\nlist of types of tests.\n\n324\n00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.215\nWe're just saying that the sooner you find\nsomething wrong then the easier it is\n\n325\n00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:37.535\nto fix, or\ncertainly the less costly it is.\n\n326\n00:18:37.535 --> 00:18:40.125\nSo that's more efficiency for us and\n\n327\n00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:42.325\nwe're in an agile environment,\nthat's what we want.\n\n328\n00:18:42.325 --> 00:18:45.595\nAnd we're gonna do\ntesting together as well.\n\n329\n00:18:45.595 --> 00:18:48.395\nThen you have to think about user\ntesting and you have to think about\n\n330\n00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:52.715\ncustomer testing and then you also have\nto think about functionality testing.\n\n331\n00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:53.995\nDoes it actually fail?\n\n332\n00:18:53.995 --> 00:18:55.900\nDoes it give an error message?\n\n333\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.480\nAs well as does it deliver\nwhat the customer wants it to\n\n334\n00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.760\ndeliver?\n&gt;&gt; As well as is it protecting\n\n335\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.280\nthem in a way?\n\n336\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.377\nLike any kind of red team, blue team\nwith the security side of things,\n\n337\n00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:06.507\npen testing.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so\n\n338\n00:19:06.507 --> 00:19:09.400\nthere are various tests.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n339\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.740\n&gt;&gt; And we've gotta,\n\n340\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.270\nit's part of the plan in the iteration,\nyou've gotta plan to test as well.\n\n341\n00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.453\nAnd so you've gotta plan all of the\naspects of the testing that you want to\n\n342\n00:19:19.453 --> 00:19:23.089\ninclude, including the security,\nthe user, the customer,\n\n343\n00:19:23.089 --> 00:19:27.638\nincluding the actual functionality and\ndoes it actually, physically work?\n\n344\n00:19:27.638 --> 00:19:28.996\nYou know\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n345\n00:19:28.996 --> 00:19:29.747\n&gt;&gt; Without any errors.\n\n346\n00:19:29.747 --> 00:19:30.687\nRight?\n\n347\n00:19:30.687 --> 00:19:31.728\nSo that's key.\n\n348\n00:19:31.728 --> 00:19:34.923\nAnd so when you think about\nhow we split up the tasks,\n\n349\n00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:39.090\nthen we should expect our\ntesting to be collaborative.\n\n350\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.350\nCuz we should expect everybody\nto be involved in testing.\n\n351\n00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.360\nNow, I've just got one question for you\nreally, and, you know, a straight yes or\n\n352\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.000\nno will do.\n\n353\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.908\nNot that that's a hint.\n\n354\n00:19:48.908 --> 00:19:53.991\n[LAUGH] Should I test my own programming.\n&gt;&gt; I say no.\n\n355\n00:19:53.991 --> 00:19:56.320\n&gt;&gt; You're right, we don't.\n\n356\n00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.600\nWe'll ask, we talked about in XP in that\n\n357\n00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.380\nparticular episode where we looked at\nthat methodology, we do pair programming.\n\n358\n00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.050\nBut you don't test your own code.\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\n\n359\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.743\n&gt;&gt; It just makes sense because if you test\n\n360\n00:20:08.743 --> 00:20:12.263\nyour own code, I know how my code works.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n361\n00:20:12.263 --> 00:20:13.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n362\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.620\nI have to make sure that you're able to\nuse and somebody else is able to use it.\n\n363\n00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.560\n&gt;&gt; And you also have like a unique bias.\n\n364\n00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.607\nLike of course it's creative,\nof course it worked, but..\n\n365\n00:20:22.607 --> 00:20:25.640\nAnd I'm going to be trying to prove\nthat it's going to work as well.\n\n366\n00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.420\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n\n367\n00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.210\nWe don't test our own code.\n\n368\n00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.950\nAnd our test should be replaceable, and\n\n369\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:38.140\nthis is not just from an efficiency\nperspective, which, yes it is efficiency.\n\n370\n00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.860\nIf I can use that test somewhere else\nthat same test somewhere else then that's\n\n371\n00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.260\ngonna be very efficient.\n\n372\n00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:48.050\nBut I also need to prove functionality,\nwhich means that I\n\n373\n00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.030\ndon't just test once and then go,\nyeah, that's it, it's working.\n\n374\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.070\nI'm going to test a number of times so\n\n375\n00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.710\nthat I can demonstrate that it's working,\nokay?\n\n376\n00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.870\nAnd so, as we've already said,\ntesting should be independent.\n\n377\n00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.640\nIt shouldn't be done by\nthe person that's coded it.\n\n378\n00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:08.210\nIn the same way that we prioritize\nour tasks, we prioritize our testing.\n\n379\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:13.429\nWhich functionality is\nmore important to tests?\n\n380\n00:21:13.429 --> 00:21:17.501\nWhat do we do if a test fails?\n&gt;&gt; You rework.\n\n381\n00:21:17.501 --> 00:21:20.605\nI don't know what the technical term is,\nbut\n\n382\n00:21:20.605 --> 00:21:23.301\nyou gotta go back to the drawing board,\n\n383\n00:21:23.301 --> 00:21:27.880\nsome how maybe added to the next story.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n384\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.460\nSee, she is thinking along\nthe Agile frame of mind now, yeah.\n\n385\n00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.120\nOkay, yeah.\n\n386\n00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.950\nWe noted in a traditional word\nfull of approach here, so\n\n387\n00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.053\nif something fails,\nthen we have to decide.\n\n388\n00:21:39.053 --> 00:21:42.230\nAnd we decide whether we're\ngoing to add it to the backlog.\n\n389\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:47.080\nIn other words, we're going to add\nit into the next user story or\n\n390\n00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.825\nthe next iteration or\ndecide whether we're just going to and\n\n391\n00:21:50.825 --> 00:21:56.340\nthat's going to be a you know,\nwhatever you want to call it and what\n\n392\n00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:02.810\nwe don't do is we don't go back and\nreinvent the wheel.\n\n393\n00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.260\nWe're on a very strict timeline here.\n\n394\n00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.940\nSo if we get as far as developing\nall of the coding, and\n\n395\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.420\nthen we do the testing and\nwe find that there's something wrong.\n\n396\n00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.860\nIf that's the only story that we're\ndelivering in that iteration,\n\n397\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.120\nthen we failed in that iteration.\n&gt;&gt; That sounds so\n\n398\n00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.512\ntragic.\n&gt;&gt; I know right.\n\n399\n00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:30.381\n[LAUGH] Now, be careful cuz I know\nCherokees likely to cry at the drop of\n\n400\n00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:32.999\na hat, so\nI don't wat to make it sound too bad.\n\n401\n00:22:32.999 --> 00:22:38.042\n[LAUGH] But, yeah, we have to acknowledge\nthat's okay, that's where we are right\n\n402\n00:22:38.042 --> 00:22:42.340\nnow, so let's look at our next iteration.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n403\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.061\nSo think about,\nwe wanna make sure that we get it right,\n\n404\n00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:50.674\nfirst of all, then we don't have to\ngo back and do everything again.\n\n405\n00:22:50.674 --> 00:22:54.391\nBut at the end of the day, though we know\nthat sometimes the whole idea of testing\n\n406\n00:22:54.391 --> 00:22:56.612\nis that sometimes tests fails.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n407\n00:22:56.612 --> 00:22:58.482\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes we get error messages, and so\n\n408\n00:22:58.482 --> 00:23:01.860\nwe've got to decide what\nwe're going to do about it.\n\n409\n00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:07.530\nAnd our tests should be specified before\nwe even start to do any development work.\n\n410\n00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.520\nAnd of course, all of our requirements,\nall of our functionality,\n\n411\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.080\nshould be tested for risk, for\nthe probability, the likelihood,\n\n412\n00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.530\nthat vulnerability that\nthe likelihood of any failure.\n\n413\n00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:25.263\nAnd the greatest risks, well, they should\nbe tested first because then we can add\n\n414\n00:23:25.263 --> 00:23:27.607\nin, potentially, resilience, etc.\n\n415\n00:23:27.607 --> 00:23:31.303\nAnd actually that question that\nI just asked you is really\n\n416\n00:23:31.303 --> 00:23:33.310\nabout backlog grooming.\n\n417\n00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:39.293\nAnd that just goes back to, once we\nfinished that particular iteration,\n\n418\n00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:44.020\nthen we go back and we look at\nall of our stories that have yet\n\n419\n00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:48.183\nto be delivered and\nwe may not want to work, [LAUGH].\n\n420\n00:23:48.183 --> 00:23:53.014\nWe may need to add to those stories\nbecause we might have failed in some\n\n421\n00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:55.168\ntests.\n&gt;&gt; But priorities also could have shifted,\n\n422\n00:23:55.168 --> 00:23:56.792\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we also want to,\n\n423\n00:23:56.792 --> 00:24:00.662\nthat's why we call it grooming because we\nalso want to reevaluate those stories that\n\n424\n00:24:00.662 --> 00:24:02.120\nare still there.\n\n425\n00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.100\nBecause what we may have done,\n\n426\n00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.990\ninadvertantly, is we may have\nprogrammed one thing and\n\n427\n00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.880\nthen the user has turned around and said\nwell actually I'm really happy with that.\n\n428\n00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.770\nAnd I don't need this.\n\n429\n00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.120\nSo our user stories may have changed or\nsomething else in the outside world,\n\n430\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.590\nsome other external influence might\nhave changed as well, maybe there's been\n\n431\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:26.360\na security patch released that now means\nthat a particular story is obsolete.\n\n432\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.870\nSo again, we go back and\nwill at the end of each iteration,\n\n433\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.630\nthen we will review and\nwe will perform our back log grooming and\n\n434\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:39.350\nmake sure that what's in our back log Is\nactually still relevant to that project.\n\n435\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.480\nSo now what we've done is we've taken\na look at planning an iteration.\n\n436\n00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.440\nAnd in our next episode, when we come\nback we're going to be looking at after\n\n437\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.013\nthe iteration, reviewing the iteration.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n438\n00:24:53.013 --> 00:24:58.852\nI thought we were gonna have one more\nslide, I know we're not in the waterfall,\n\n439\n00:24:58.852 --> 00:25:02.860\nbut maybe a backlog completion party?\n&gt;&gt; A party?\n\n440\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.663\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n441\n00:25:03.663 --> 00:25:05.015\n&gt;&gt; Are you thinkg about margarittas again?\n\n442\n00:25:05.015 --> 00:25:08.012\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyway.\n\n443\n00:25:08.012 --> 00:25:10.583\n&gt;&gt; We need to have a serious talk at some\n\n444\n00:25:10.583 --> 00:25:11.707\npoint in time.\n\n445\n00:25:11.707 --> 00:25:17.270\nYeah, sorry.\n&gt;&gt; Well, [LAUGH] it's 5:00 somewhere.\n\n446\n00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.820\nRight?\n\n447\n00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.790\nJust kidding.\n\n448\n00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.705\nNo, we are out of time, so\nwe'll go ahead and sign out for this show.\n\n449\n00:25:22.705 --> 00:25:25.043\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n450\n00:25:25.043 --> 00:25:27.760\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n451\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.424\n[MUSIC]\n\n452\n00:25:33.424 --> 00:25:38.414\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.070\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to you\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.960\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.201\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look at,\nwell concluding an iteration, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.432\nwith us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:27.061\nThanks for stopping by, Jo, how are you?\n\n10\n00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:28.791\n&gt;&gt; I am fine, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:29.615\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:30.358\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n13\n00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:33.697\n&gt;&gt; And a little bit later on after this\nepisode, we'll be working at how to get\n\n14\n00:00:33.697 --> 00:00:36.628\nCherokee's teeth fixed so\nshe can actually say Agile concepts.\n\n15\n00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:38.018\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n16\n00:00:38.018 --> 00:00:39.382\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:39.382 --> 00:00:41.910\n&gt;&gt; You'd think after the 40th time I've\n\n18\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.420\nsaid it,\nit'd be just be rolling off my tongue.\n\n19\n00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:46.917\n&gt;&gt; Clearly not.\n\n20\n00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:50.910\nClearly, I have not been doing\nmy job right, yep, okay [LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.732\n&gt;&gt; So we have talked about\niterations quite a bit, right?\n\n22\n00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:57.238\nSo when we're concluding them,\ncoming to the end, right?\n\n23\n00:00:57.238 --> 00:00:58.945\nSo how are we gonna wrap that up?\n\n24\n00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:00.140\nWhat are we looking at here, Jo?\n\n25\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.069\n&gt;&gt; Right, well that's generally\nwhat concluded means, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n26\n00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:07.668\nSo what we're going to be doing is we're\njust gonna be discussing sort of how we\n\n27\n00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:11.574\nmanage the iteration, and how we conclude,\nand how we really wrap things\n\n28\n00:01:11.574 --> 00:01:15.363\nup at the end of the iteration, and\nthen obviously, what do we do next?\n\n29\n00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:15.897\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n30\n00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:20.228\n&gt;&gt; So, we're just gonna take a brief\nlook at how we finish up an iteration.\n\n31\n00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:24.890\nSo let's start off by just taking\na look at our daily rhythm of work.\n\n32\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.970\nNow this is actually just\na recap over our last episode,\n\n33\n00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.240\nwhere we looked at planning the iteration.\n\n34\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.130\nNow we're looking at sort of\nhow we manage that iteration.\n\n35\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.660\nLook at the first step, and I'll mention\nthis because this is something that's\n\n36\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.100\nquite personal to us here at ITProTV,\nbecause we do have a stand-up\n\n37\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.810\nevery single day that allows us, as\na team, to communicate with each other and\n\n38\n00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.090\njust do exactly what a stand-up\nmeeting is supposed to do.\n\n39\n00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.481\nAnd tell everybody what we're\nplanning on for the day,\n\n40\n00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:00.873\nand also highlight any concerns\nthat we might have, and\n\n41\n00:02:00.873 --> 00:02:04.644\ngive everybody just an update\nof what we achieved yesterday.\n\n42\n00:02:04.644 --> 00:02:06.795\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it kind of sets the tone,\nlike hey,\n\n43\n00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:08.450\nthis is the beginning of our work day.\n\n44\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.220\nWe have some time before our\nstand-up to go, grab coffee, or\n\n45\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.230\njust socialize and chat, but then,\nduring that stand-up, it's like,\n\n46\n00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.045\nall right, we're down to brass tacks here.\n\n47\n00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:21.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think,\nthe other thing about having the stand-up,\n\n48\n00:02:21.703 --> 00:02:26.228\nfirst thing of the morning, and it's\nsomething that we definitely recommend,\n\n49\n00:02:26.228 --> 00:02:30.948\nit starts the work day, and it's kind of\nlike you said, you start, you'll get in,\n\n50\n00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:35.337\nand you'll have a coffee, and maybe catch\nup on some of the office [LAUGH] gossip\n\n51\n00:02:35.337 --> 00:02:40.175\nmaybe, any updates, etc., but that's it,\nyour stand-up starts your work day.\n\n52\n00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.932\nAnd so you know that we all do\nthis at 8:30 in the morning,\n\n53\n00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:48.740\nwe've got our 15 minutes, and\nthat's when we then get plunged into work.\n\n54\n00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.870\nThat's when we start our productive time,\nand of course,\n\n55\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.960\nthe concept came from the Agile\nmethodologies purely because, and it works\n\n56\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.960\nreally well, purely because it allows us\nto identify when productive time starts.\n\n57\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.692\nRemember when we were estimating our\nuser stories and when we were estimating\n\n58\n00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:14.786\npriorities, we were estimating our ideal\ndays, and those ideal days are the times\n\n59\n00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:19.986\nor the days when we are productive, and\nwe're not productive 100% of the time.\n\n60\n00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:22.118\nAnd I don't care how much you try and\nconvince me you are,\n\n61\n00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.390\nalthough we know you are\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Although we think we may be,\n\n62\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.965\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:29.095\n&gt;&gt; We like to be, but\nlet's face it, we're not.\n\n64\n00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:31.460\nWe're productive around about how much?\n\n65\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.530\n&gt;&gt; 50%, which, to me, it was kind of\na shock, but I think you're right,\n\n66\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.450\nand I've even seen different\nmethodologies out there, even, you'll\n\n67\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.710\nprobably get a kick out of this Jo,\nbut different browser timers.\n\n68\n00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.484\nI forget the actual methodology\nthat the person invented it.\n\n69\n00:03:50.484 --> 00:03:51.899\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like a clock to me.\n\n70\n00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:56.387\n&gt;&gt; It is a clock, and it's just basically\nsetting, hey, you're gonna work for,\n\n71\n00:03:56.387 --> 00:04:00.281\nI think it's in 15 minute increments,\nor something like that, and\n\n72\n00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:04.703\nthen you have to take a few moments,\nlike five minutes, before your next task,\n\n73\n00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:08.867\njust to get up, move your legs,\nget some circulation, and then proceed.\n\n74\n00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:14.784\n&gt;&gt; There's kind of an argument there,\nisn't it, to both sides of that story\n\n75\n00:04:14.784 --> 00:04:19.121\nreally, because if you need your time\nmicromanaged into that sort of degree\n\n76\n00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:22.670\nthen that tells me you really\nneed to work on time management.\n\n77\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.654\nHowever, in the flip side to that,\nit does allow focus, and\n\n78\n00:04:25.654 --> 00:04:29.692\nit gives you that focus to say, well,\nI'm gonna spend 15 minutes doing this and\n\n79\n00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:31.760\nthen five minutes doing something else.\n\n80\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.270\nNow, of course, when it comes to coding,\nwhich is where we are right now.\n\n81\n00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.223\nWe're in an agile environment,\nwhen it comes to coding,\n\n82\n00:04:39.223 --> 00:04:43.645\nyou can't just simply spend 15 minutes and\nthen walk away, and get up and walk away.\n\n83\n00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:47.654\nAnd what you tend to do is if your\nmicromanaging your time to that degree,\n\n84\n00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:50.154\nyou tend to accumulate\nthose 15 minutes and\n\n85\n00:04:50.154 --> 00:04:54.324\nthen all over sudden you're entitled\nto like a 30 minute break, right?\n\n86\n00:04:54.324 --> 00:04:57.636\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or like focusing so\n\n87\n00:04:57.636 --> 00:04:59.444\nmuch on that one thing.\n\n88\n00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:02.388\nI don't do that, but\nI think every person is so\n\n89\n00:05:02.388 --> 00:05:06.026\ndifferent in just understanding\ntheir own rhythm here.\n\n90\n00:05:06.026 --> 00:05:07.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n91\n00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:10.949\nWe got to acknowledge, we've got to\nbe really objective and acknowledge\n\n92\n00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.786\nthe fact that we're not productive 100% of\nthe day, but the stand-up meeting allows\n\n93\n00:05:15.786 --> 00:05:19.878\nus to communicate to everybody what\nwe're planning on working on that day.\n\n94\n00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:24.260\nIt allows the product owner to potentially\nre-prioritize if they need to.\n\n95\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.070\nBut, it also gives us a committment.\n\n96\n00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.500\nIt gives us a responsibility\nto the rest of our team,\n\n97\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.730\nbecause we have committed to do\nthis throughout the day-to-day.\n\n98\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.240\nSo it really should, and I say should,\nit should give us focus.\n\n99\n00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.310\nIt should allow us to focus on our\nproductive time and allow us to say,\n\n100\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.253\nright, okay, this is what I said I'm going\nto complete by the end of the day today,\n\n101\n00:05:51.253 --> 00:05:52.280\nand we do this.\n\n102\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.636\nWhen we start every morning, we say,\nright, this is what we intend to complete\n\n103\n00:05:56.636 --> 00:06:01.253\ntoday, and this is our productive time,\nand we know when our unproductive time is,\n\n104\n00:06:01.253 --> 00:06:04.785\nand we know then when we've got\nto take additional takes, etc.\n\n105\n00:06:04.785 --> 00:06:09.798\nSo even aside from our stand-up,\nwe're doing effectively pair programming,\n\n106\n00:06:09.798 --> 00:06:14.439\nand so what we are doing is planning our\nentire day between the two of us, and\n\n107\n00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.120\nthis is what we want to\nachieve in that day.\n\n108\n00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.385\nWell, between the three of us,\n\n109\n00:06:18.385 --> 00:06:20.970\ncuz we can't forget our\nwonderful director, Taylor.\n\n110\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you guys don't see him as much,\nbut he's always there.\n\n111\n00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.877\n&gt;&gt; He's always there,\nyeah, and even sometimes,\n\n112\n00:06:27.877 --> 00:06:31.394\nsometimes he leaves us little surprises.\n\n113\n00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:34.738\nBut, and that can only enhance our work,\nby the way.\n\n114\n00:06:34.738 --> 00:06:35.562\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n115\n00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.942\nI mean, that's a great motivator,\nchocolates?\n\n116\n00:06:37.942 --> 00:06:39.900\nTaylor, you're onto something here.\n\n117\n00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nin the bottom right-hand corner there\n\n118\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.820\nyou'll see something that we've\nprobably been familiar with.\n\n119\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.010\nCan you remember what that is?\n\n120\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.440\n&gt;&gt; Bottom right-hand corner, done?\n\n121\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.682\nRight, okay, you could read.\n\n122\n00:06:53.682 --> 00:06:54.680\n&gt;&gt; I remember what that is.\n\n123\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now she can remember.\n\n124\n00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.026\nBut what's the graphic?\n\n125\n00:06:59.026 --> 00:07:01.731\nWhat was that?\n&gt;&gt; That is going to be our Kanban chart.\n\n126\n00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.519\n&gt;&gt; It is a Kanban chart, yeah.\n\n127\n00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:08.290\nYeah, which simply tells us\nwhich tasks we have got to do.\n\n128\n00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.290\nSo which tasks are ready for us to do,\nwhich tasks are we working on right now,\n\n129\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.180\nand which tasks have we completed,\nand so that just a visual,\n\n130\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.890\nit's a very big chart [LAUGH],\nand it's just a visual\n\n131\n00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.680\ninterpretation or representation\nof what we're doing right now.\n\n132\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.322\nWe are all responsible, as individuals\nwe're all responsible for our own tasks,\n\n133\n00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:37.203\nso long if we're using XP, or\nextreme programming, then we will be doing\n\n134\n00:07:37.203 --> 00:07:42.271\nsome pair programming, and so\nwe'll be jointly responsible for any task.\n\n135\n00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:46.299\nIn a previous episode we looked\nat planning our iterations and\n\n136\n00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.629\nwe looked at dependencies as well.\n\n137\n00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:53.838\nSo I'm gonna take responsibility for\nmy task, but if my task is dependent\n\n138\n00:07:53.838 --> 00:07:59.131\non yours, then you also have to take\na certain amount of responsibility for\n\n139\n00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:03.667\nmy task, because I can't start\nmine Until you finished yours,\n\n140\n00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:06.943\nwhich is why the team,\nor us in this instance,\n\n141\n00:08:06.943 --> 00:08:12.930\nwe're collectively responsible for\nmaking sure that we meet all of the goals.\n\n142\n00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.611\nIt's not just down to me to make sure\nthat I make my task because my task is\n\n143\n00:08:17.611 --> 00:08:20.276\nthe final one in that dependency chain.\n\n144\n00:08:20.276 --> 00:08:21.441\nWe're managing ourselves.\n\n145\n00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:25.437\nWe're empowered to manage ourselves, and\n\n146\n00:08:25.437 --> 00:08:30.730\ntherefore we have to ensure\nthat we can manage ourselves.\n\n147\n00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.823\nThat we do actually achieve something and\n\n148\n00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:35.466\nthat we don't spend all\nday standing here talking.\n\n149\n00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:36.463\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's another possibility as well,\nright?\n\n150\n00:08:36.463 --> 00:08:37.437\n&gt;&gt; It could happen.\n\n151\n00:08:37.437 --> 00:08:40.531\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It could and so the scrum master,\n\n152\n00:08:40.531 --> 00:08:43.960\nwhat does the scrum master do, Cherokee?\n\n153\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.850\n&gt;&gt; Makes sure that we get on with it and\nthat we aren't, no.\n\n154\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, no, no,\nyou're right, you're right.\n\n155\n00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm so nervous now.\n\n156\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.685\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, we got it right this time.\n\n157\n00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:55.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This time, this is a first.\n\n158\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.210\nBut we got it right this time, yeah?\n\n159\n00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.510\nSo go on, carry on.\n\n160\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, I mean,\nthey hired us for a reason, Jo.\n\n161\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.930\nWe like to talk and jab.\n\n162\n00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.660\nSo if we're just talking about random\nthings, that's just our personality types,\n\n163\n00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.960\nbut just staying focused and on task here.\n\n164\n00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.962\n&gt;&gt; Which Cherokee clearly didn't do there\nbecause the question I asked was what does\n\n165\n00:09:14.962 --> 00:09:16.016\nthe scrum master do?\n\n166\n00:09:16.016 --> 00:09:19.146\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The scrum master is going to be\n\n167\n00:09:19.146 --> 00:09:20.510\nresponsible for that.\n\n168\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.005\nSo they're gonna take that ownership and\nsay, listen Jo, listen Cherokee,\n\n169\n00:09:25.005 --> 00:09:26.360\nget on with it.\n\n170\n00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.250\n&gt;&gt; Be careful of the word ownership.\n\n171\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.833\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nCuz we should be taking ownership of our\n\n172\n00:09:30.833 --> 00:09:33.805\nown priorities and\nall of our own workload.\n\n173\n00:09:33.805 --> 00:09:36.765\nSo the scrum master is not necessarily-\n&gt;&gt; Responsibility.\n\n174\n00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:38.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they've got an accountability.\n\n175\n00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:39.555\n&gt;&gt; Accountability, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:39.555 --> 00:09:42.650\n&gt;&gt; But we should be taking\nthe responsibility for managing our own\n\n177\n00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:48.195\nworkload and for ensuring that we\nachieve what we set out to achieve.\n\n178\n00:09:48.195 --> 00:09:51.445\nThe scrum master is the person that's\nkind of standing there cracking the whip.\n\n179\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.540\nSounds awful doesn't it?\n\n180\n00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.197\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n181\n00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:57.714\nthe scrum master is the person that's\ngoing to empower us to do what we\n\n182\n00:09:57.714 --> 00:09:58.330\nneed to do.\n\n183\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.300\nAnd actually, and\nwhen I mention cracking the whip,\n\n184\n00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.970\nthat's a really important thing to say.\n\n185\n00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.870\nIn an agile team, we're all empowered\nto get on with our own tasks.\n\n186\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:14.950\nAnd in an agile team,\nwe are managed in a collaborative way.\n\n187\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.950\nSo we shouldn't be managed in\na dictatorial way at all, and\n\n188\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.550\nwe should be empowered.\n\n189\n00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.300\nWe should be allowed and\n\n190\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.280\ngiven that flexibility to be\nable to manage ourselves knowing\n\n191\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.900\nthat by allowing us to manage ourselves,\nthen we will deliver quality work.\n\n192\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.835\nWe know by using sort of time management\ntechniques, we know we've already\n\n193\n00:10:37.835 --> 00:10:42.620\nworked out in the planning phase\nwhen our productive time is.\n\n194\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.230\nSo I know that my productive time\nis first thing in the morning.\n\n195\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.180\nAnd Cherokee and\nI work really well together.\n\n196\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.480\nWe know that our productive time\nis pretty much exactly the same.\n\n197\n00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.670\nAnd so, because of that,\n\n198\n00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.975\nwe can plan to ensure that our\nproductive time is well-utilized.\n\n199\n00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.780\nAnd the scrum master should\nempower us to do that.\n\n200\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.480\nIf the scrum master is standing\nover us with a baseball bat or\n\n201\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.730\nwith a whip, [LAUGH] then\nwe're not gonna be productive.\n\n202\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.820\nAnd we're certainly not\ngonna deliver quality work.\n\n203\n00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n204\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:19.235\n&gt;&gt; Which is why the scrum master,\nwhilst they take overall accountability,\n\n205\n00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:22.510\nthey're not taking\nthe individual responsibilities.\n\n206\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.200\nThat's down to us to manage ourselves.\n\n207\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.073\n&gt;&gt; Right and I think that brings up a\nreally good point that you have there, Jo.\n\n208\n00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:31.119\nBecause I've actually been in that\ndictatorship-type environment versus\n\n209\n00:11:31.119 --> 00:11:32.307\nsomething I see here.\n\n210\n00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:35.110\nAnd you've heard me talk about Tim,\nTim this, Tim that.\n\n211\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.220\nAnd that's because, no, seriously,\nby having a good strong leader is\n\n212\n00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.730\nkey here because when you do empower\nsomeone by leading by example.\n\n213\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.070\nSo instead of having to have your\nweapon of choice to make sure people\n\n214\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.385\nget that work done, right?\n\n215\n00:11:49.385 --> 00:11:51.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you get your work done and\n\n216\n00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.120\nshow them how successful\nyou can be at your job,\n\n217\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.840\nthen they're gonna want to do better.\n\n218\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; At least that's what I've observed.\n\n219\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.700\n&gt;&gt; No, it's very, very true.\n\n220\n00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.170\nYou've got to empower people.\n\n221\n00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.690\nYou've got to allow them to do their\nown tasks and work in their own way.\n\n222\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.050\nEverybody has a unique way of working.\n\n223\n00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.440\nNo two people work exactly the same way.\n\n224\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.530\nAnd projects fail when we try and impose\nour way of working on everybody else.\n\n225\n00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.570\nIt simply doesn't work like that,\nit really, really doesn't.\n\n226\n00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.307\n&gt;&gt; I don't think that everyone in\nthe world got that memo though, Jo.\n\n227\n00:12:24.307 --> 00:12:27.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\nthat's why we're looking at agile right?\n\n228\n00:12:27.749 --> 00:12:31.197\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so it's why we're\nbring that to the forefront here.\n\n229\n00:12:31.197 --> 00:12:34.814\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, five minutes with us and\nthey'll get the memo, no problem at all.\n\n230\n00:12:34.814 --> 00:12:37.851\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What else do we look at then at\n\n231\n00:12:37.851 --> 00:12:39.200\nthe end of a project?\n\n232\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.690\nWell, at the end of a project,\nwe want to make sure\n\n233\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.960\nthat our customers are actually\nhappy with what we have delivered.\n\n234\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.895\nThat first bullet point,\nit really is stating the obvious.\n\n235\n00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:55.105\nAnd I shouldn't have to reiterate that,\nbut the business have gotta say, hey,\n\n236\n00:12:55.105 --> 00:13:00.205\nyeah, this is okay, before we release it,\nnot after we release it.\n\n237\n00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:01.465\nIt's a bit like testing, right?\n\n238\n00:13:01.465 --> 00:13:02.755\nWe test before we release.\n\n239\n00:13:02.755 --> 00:13:06.340\nWe don't test in production\nin the live environment.\n\n240\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.760\nSo we're gonna have a business\nrelationship manager or\n\n241\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.660\na business representative,\nsomebody that works and\n\n242\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:19.270\nacts as a translator and acts as\na go-between between us and the business.\n\n243\n00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.630\nAnd I mentioned the word translator.\n\n244\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.230\nThat's really important.\n\n245\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:28.948\nAnd it goes back to, actually, we were\nhaving a discussion a little while ago\n\n246\n00:13:28.948 --> 00:13:33.973\nabout the fact that the business, I don't\nexpect them to know anything about IT.\n\n247\n00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:39.420\nAnd I don't expect the business\nto understand any terminology.\n\n248\n00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.230\nI don't need them to know any terminology,\nand they don't need to either.\n\n249\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.208\nIt's not efficient for them to do that.\n\n250\n00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:48.695\n&gt;&gt; Right, you said something to\nme in a previous series that we\n\n251\n00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:52.576\nhave shot together that was really\npowerful and it stuck with me.\n\n252\n00:13:52.576 --> 00:13:56.220\n&gt;&gt; But just with that business\nrelationship management, you should be\n\n253\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.140\nable to identify those needs before\nthey even know that there's an issue or\n\n254\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.330\nthat there's a void in their life there.\n\n255\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.490\nRight, a business relationship role,\nhowever you wanna call it,\n\n256\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.780\nwhether you wanna call it a BRM, or\nwhether you want to call it a lead\n\n257\n00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.190\nbusiness representative,\nit doesn't matter what you call them.\n\n258\n00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.910\nThe business relationship role,\nthat person\n\n259\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.890\nshould know the business inside out and\nshould be able to identify what is needed.\n\n260\n00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.990\nAnd when it comes to identifying\nuser stories, they're key for this.\n\n261\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.410\nAnd because what that BRM role will\ndo is they will observe the business.\n\n262\n00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.420\nThey will see how the business work.\n\n263\n00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.280\nThey will understand what it is they need.\n\n264\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.500\nAnd they will see that maybe, just maybe,\n\n265\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.530\nthere life would be a little easier\nif they had some form of biometric\n\n266\n00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.505\nrecognition, which meant that they didn't\nhave to keep remembering a password.\n\n267\n00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:50.805\nBecause when their password\nchanged every single month, and\n\n268\n00:14:50.805 --> 00:14:54.925\nyou have to have a different one for\na two-year period, and\n\n269\n00:14:54.925 --> 00:15:00.200\nyou can't have the same one with just one,\ntwo, three, four, and five after.\n\n270\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.213\nRight, [LAUGH] a password history, they're\nlike nope, you used that three months ago.\n\n271\n00:15:04.213 --> 00:15:07.537\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, exactly, and so the BRM\nshould be able to recognize that look,\n\n272\n00:15:07.537 --> 00:15:11.066\nthis clearly isn't working cuz what we've\ngot are loads of notes that are stuck on\n\n273\n00:15:11.066 --> 00:15:12.824\nthe keyboards and stuck on the screens.\n\n274\n00:15:12.824 --> 00:15:14.477\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we've got so\n\n275\n00:15:14.477 --> 00:15:16.740\nsecure that we've become insecure.\n\n276\n00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ndefeating the purpose at that point.\n\n277\n00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.090\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so the BRM is\nthe person that recognizes this.\n\n278\n00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:28.190\nBut the BRM, I always look at them as\na translator because what they should do,\n\n279\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.280\nand the way that the interactions should\nbe right at the very start of the project\n\n280\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.020\nis Cherokee,\nyou've forgotten your password.\n\n281\n00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.674\nYou've had to have it reset,\nI've noticed, 15 times in the last year.\n\n282\n00:15:38.674 --> 00:15:41.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is partly getting ridiculous.\n\n283\n00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.030\nDo you think I could\nreplace your laptop and\n\n284\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.720\ngive you something that would\nrecognize your fingerprint?\n\n285\n00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.971\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n296\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.310\n&gt;&gt; How about I do this?\n\n297\n00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.100\nWe could do this for you.\n\n298\n00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.645\nAnd it's at that point in time when\nI come back then to development,\n\n299\n00:16:24.645 --> 00:16:27.455\nand I say to development,\nright, we need to do this.\n\n300\n00:16:27.455 --> 00:16:29.600\nThis is the way they work.\n\n301\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.010\nThis is the way the business work.\n\n302\n00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.890\nWe need to do this, and\nwe need to develop this for them.\n\n303\n00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:34.940\nSo it means hard work.\n\n304\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.260\nIt also means some software as well.\n\n305\n00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:42.610\nAnd that's when we start with the problem\nstatement then exploring the vision for\n\n306\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.780\nour project and then looking at\nour individual user's story.\n\n307\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.380\nThat's when that happens.\n\n308\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.350\nAnd then here we are at\nthe end of an iteration.\n\n309\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:56.082\nAnd now I'm the person as the business\nrelationship manager in that business\n\n310\n00:16:56.082 --> 00:16:59.230\nrelationship role where I\nam going to look at this.\n\n311\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.530\nAnd I'm going to say, right,\nokay, the developers did well.\n\n312\n00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.000\nIt works, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.960\nI'm testing it, and it works.\n\n314\n00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:12.380\nAnd it's at that point in time that we\nsay, yes, okay, that is good to go.\n\n315\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.430\nAnd that acceptance is\ncompletely dependent on that\n\n316\n00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.100\nsuccessful review of the solution.\n\n317\n00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.270\nSo it's me.\n\n318\n00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.440\nI sign off that\nthe functionality is fit for\n\n319\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.900\nuse, because the solution meets\nall of the acceptance criteria.\n\n320\n00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.970\nCherokee is only going to\naccept it if it works.\n\n321\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.710\nIf it doesn't work,\n\n322\n00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.135\nwhat do you gonna think of me if I give\nyou something then that just doesn't work?\n\n323\n00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Jo?\n\n324\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.861\n&gt;&gt; It's the first time she's been loss for\nwords.\n\n325\n00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:42.364\nGo on.\n\n326\n00:17:42.364 --> 00:17:43.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n327\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.400\nI'm probably just gonna have\nthat same kind of reaction.\n\n328\n00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.719\nIf I go to log in, and\nI'm like, okay, now what?\n\n329\n00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:53.260\nAt least I could use my\npassword reset before, but\n\n330\n00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.920\nnow I can't even get into this system,\nright?\n\n331\n00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.760\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's exactly what's going\nto happen is that the credibility of IT\n\n332\n00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:07.770\nand, also, my only personal reputation,\nas well, is simply just gonna plummet.\n\n333\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.203\nAnd so we've got to make sure that\nwhat we deliver is working software.\n\n334\n00:18:11.203 --> 00:18:15.399\nIf we don't deliver working software,\nif we don't deliver value to Cherokee,\n\n335\n00:18:15.399 --> 00:18:18.487\nthen Cherokee's start looking\nelsewhere for solutions,\n\n336\n00:18:18.487 --> 00:18:21.716\nbecause she knows that there's\nsomething better out there.\n\n337\n00:18:21.716 --> 00:18:25.900\nAnd so it's up to us then\nto provide that for her.\n\n338\n00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.730\nSo the business acceptance is obtained\nhere within this particular iteration.\n\n339\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.450\nWe don't wait until the end\nof the entire project,\n\n340\n00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:39.260\nbecause there are definitely going to\nbe other iterations in the project.\n\n341\n00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.716\nAnd we don't wait until the entire\nproject, because, of course,\n\n342\n00:18:42.716 --> 00:18:46.850\nwe're releasing, and we're releasing\nmaybe one or two iterations together.\n\n343\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.680\nWell, when we release something,\nit's got to work.\n\n344\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.470\nSo that means that, yes,\nwe've got to sign off with each iteration.\n\n345\n00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.280\nOf course, we have to.\n\n346\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.710\nSo we review the iteration, and\n\n347\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.970\nwe review to make sure that we've\nachieved what we set out to achieve.\n\n348\n00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.470\nWe're going to include Cherokee.\n\n349\n00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.352\nOnce I have verified that,\nyes, it's definitely working.\n\n350\n00:19:08.352 --> 00:19:12.050\nI'm gonna present it to her, and\nI'm going to say, is this okay?\n\n351\n00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:16.540\nNow, the purpose of this review is not\nto get that formal business sign off.\n\n352\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.000\nIt's just for Cherokee to have\nan influence over that and\n\n353\n00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.610\nto identify anything that\nshe may want to have.\n\n354\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.870\nBecause she might turn around to me and\nsay, well, that looks fine, but\n\n355\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.420\ncan we have like facial recognition now?\n\n356\n00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.810\nCuz I hear that there were a lot of\nother gadgets out there that do that, so\n\n357\n00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:32.990\ncan I have that instead?\n\n358\n00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:40.450\nSo it gives Cherokee as the customer\nthe opportunity to bring in,\n\n359\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:46.320\nmaybe, new functionality, or maybe to\nidentify an improvement that she sees.\n\n360\n00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.370\nAnd it really is also to\nassess how effective and\n\n361\n00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.220\nhow efficient that iteration went.\n\n362\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.310\nNow, of course,\n\n363\n00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.050\nthat's something that's internal\nto us within the development team.\n\n364\n00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.690\nIt's not something that Cherokee\nneeds to be aware of at all,\n\n365\n00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.730\nbecause, as far as Cherokee's concerned,\nwe've just done our job.\n\n366\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.000\nAnd then we have a retrospective, and\n\n367\n00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.200\nthe retrospective happens at\nthe end of every iteration as well.\n\n368\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:15.842\nAnd the retrospective just simply\nlooks at how well we worked together.\n\n369\n00:20:15.842 --> 00:20:16.420\nHow well we worked.\n\n370\n00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.610\nHow well we collaborated.\n\n371\n00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.210\nHow efficient and\neffective we are at our estimation.\n\n372\n00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.229\nHow many changes came as\na result of that estimation.\n\n373\n00:20:25.229 --> 00:20:29.203\nBecause if there are too many changes that\ncome as a result of maybe the estimation\n\n374\n00:20:29.203 --> 00:20:30.781\nor as a result of the iteration,\n\n375\n00:20:30.781 --> 00:20:34.070\nthen maybe we didn't plan the iteration\nin the first place right.\n\n376\n00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.910\nSo after every single iteration, we're\ngoing to be conducting the retrospective,\n\n377\n00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.580\nwhich is really gonna allow us to\nevaluate efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n378\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.010\nWho's going to be involved\nin that do you think?\n\n379\n00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.230\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that the scrum master is,\nbecause you're also talking about how\n\n380\n00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.840\nwe worked together, and that's going\nto be those interpersonal skills.\n\n381\n00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.439\n&gt;&gt; If we look at the elements\nthat are on the right hand side,\n\n382\n00:20:58.439 --> 00:21:00.227\nhere, when we talk about practices and\n\n383\n00:21:00.227 --> 00:21:03.823\ncollaboration then, yes, that's\ndefinitely going to be the scrum master.\n\n384\n00:21:03.823 --> 00:21:08.835\nNow, in terms of estimation, I'd expect\nthe product managers to also have, sorry,\n\n385\n00:21:08.835 --> 00:21:12.310\nthe product owner to have\nsome involvement in that too.\n\n386\n00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:16.840\nSo, yes, it's going to be both of them\nthat are involved in the retrospective,\n\n387\n00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.670\nbut the retrospective is\ninternal to the project team.\n\n388\n00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.710\nIt's got absolutely nothing to\ndo with the customer at all.\n\n389\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.010\nIt's just where we look back and\nwe conduct our lessons learned.\n\n390\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.280\nAnd we identify opportunities for\n\n391\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.310\nimprovement out of that,\nas well as out of the review.\n\n392\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.990\nAnd the review is really based on\nthe actual functionality itself.\n\n393\n00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:43.530\nAnd then, lastly, the thing that we want\nto do when we've completed any improvement\n\n394\n00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.260\nis to, well, use our lessons learned.\n\n395\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.690\nIf we've learned some lessons then,\nwhat are we gonna do about it?\n\n396\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:56.010\nAnd that's how we're using that review and\nthat retrospective and\n\n397\n00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:01.590\nthe opportunities that have been\nhighlighted in those two activities.\n\n398\n00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:07.220\nAnd we're going to document\nthose improvement opportunities.\n\n399\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.110\nThose improvement opportunities\ncan come in two ways.\n\n400\n00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.160\nIt can either be additional\nfunctionality or\n\n401\n00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.270\nmaybe changes to the functionality\nthat we have just coded.\n\n402\n00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.960\nOr it could be improvements in\nthe way we're working as well.\n\n403\n00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.900\nBut whatever improvement that we make,\n\n404\n00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.580\ncertainly when it comes to\nimproving the way that we work and\n\n405\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:31.240\nimproving that collaboration, that\nimprovement has to have team consensus.\n\n406\n00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.250\nWe've all got to agree\nthat this is a good idea.\n\n407\n00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.895\nIf it's just one person's idea and\nnobody else agrees,\n\n408\n00:22:36.895 --> 00:22:39.994\nthen we're going back to that\ndictatorship thing again, right?\n\n409\n00:22:39.994 --> 00:22:40.643\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n410\n00:22:40.643 --> 00:22:43.660\n&gt;&gt; So we've all gotta agree\nthat that's a good idea.\n\n411\n00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.690\nAnd the improvement, we don't wait to\nimplement that type of improvement.\n\n412\n00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.600\nIf we're gonna change\nthe way that we've worked,\n\n413\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.063\nwe do that with the next iteration.\n\n414\n00:22:53.063 --> 00:22:56.820\nRemember the values, the Agile values,\n\n415\n00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:02.380\nwe're not too focused on the process and\non the documentation.\n\n416\n00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.610\nWe want to be working, and\nwe want to be efficient, but\n\n417\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:10.690\nthe comprehensive documentation\nthat's not such a focus for us.\n\n418\n00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.350\nWe still need to have documentation,\nand, yes, we still need to have\n\n419\n00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:19.350\na process to implement improvements and\nto identify improvements.\n\n420\n00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.100\nBut we've got that.\n\n421\n00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.490\nWe've got it right in front of us.\n\n422\n00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.110\nThat's what our review and\nour retrospective is.\n\n423\n00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.050\nSo we document that, and\nthen we implement them.\n\n424\n00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.700\nWe don't wait for six months to evaluate\nthem, because then that's not efficient.\n\n425\n00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.490\nSo now what we've done,\nin this particular episode,\n\n426\n00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:40.950\nis we've looked at the conclusion,\nthe end of the iteration.\n\n427\n00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.740\nAnd so\nwhen we come back in our next episode,\n\n428\n00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.380\nwe're still going to be carrying\non with our Agile journey.\n\n429\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.160\nDon't worry, things haven't finished yet.\n\n430\n00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.670\nWe've just finished one iteration.\n\n431\n00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.216\nWe haven't released anything right now.\n\n432\n00:23:52.216 --> 00:23:55.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we're about to talk about\nways we can improve on the next show.\n\n433\n00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.250\nBut also, this will give us a good chance\nto maybe look at things that we've done\n\n434\n00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.780\nwell that we can carry on\nto the next show also.\n\n435\n00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.550\nSo we'll have to-\n&gt;&gt; That's about an improvement, yeah.\n\n436\n00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:09.680\nI mean, improvement doesn't just mean,\nkind of, looking at what went wrong.\n\n437\n00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.070\nBut we also look at what went right,\nand then we can apply that across\n\n438\n00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.830\nthe board to other iterations and\nalso to other teams as well.\n\n439\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.329\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.208\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone,\n\n4\n00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:15.560\nto your\nAgile Project Management Concept Series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.433\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.660\nIn this epidoses, we'll be taking\nlook at our different types\n\n7\n00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.300\nof-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n8\n00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.370\nshe’s forgotten.\n&gt;&gt; I’m trying to decide if I should go\n\n9\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.260\nwith southern or go with the proper.\n\n10\n00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.370\nSo we have additions and impediments.\n&gt;&gt; And, is that the southern bit?\n\n11\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.747\nIs that the one that we\nwere wondering how to say?\n\n12\n00:00:36.747 --> 00:00:39.463\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Impediments, impediments.\n\n13\n00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:41.080\nAnyway you wanna look at it.\n\n14\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.340\nThat's what we're gonna be\ntalking about in this show.\n\n15\n00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.800\n&gt;&gt; I will be doing it in the English way\n\n16\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.980\nand when we'll be discussing additions and\nalso impediments to\n\n17\n00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.671\nour Agile project.\n&gt;&gt; Lovely.\n\n18\n00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:56.244\n&gt;&gt; Let's not go\n\n19\n00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:57.056\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:57.950\n&gt;&gt; Let's not go there.\n\n21\n00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.855\n&gt;&gt; We can do the whole show like this.\n\n22\n00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:01.489\n&gt;&gt; No, please let's not.\n\n23\n00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.361\nLet's get working on\nconcluding the iterations.\n\n24\n00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:05.300\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n25\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.180\n&gt;&gt; Focus.\n\n26\n00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.810\n&gt;&gt; Looking at the additions and\n\n27\n00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.128\nchanges that we might\nwanna make to our project.\n\n28\n00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:13.370\nAnd also,\n[LAUGH] looking at the impediments\n\n29\n00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.660\nthat we might come across in our projects.\n\n30\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.160\nHow about we do that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n31\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds better,\n\n32\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.580\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n33\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] so in previous episodes,\n\n34\n00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.460\nwhat we've looked at\nare iterations themselves.\n\n35\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.660\nAnd we've looked at how\nwe plan an interation.\n\n36\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.080\nWe've looked at how we\nestimate use of stories and\n\n37\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.540\nhow we plan to use the stories and\nprioritize them.\n\n38\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.430\nAnd of course, we then bring that in to\nplanning the iteration and making sure\n\n39\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.690\nthat we convert our ideal days into real\ndays, and then we concluded our iteration.\n\n40\n00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.270\nAnd in conclusion,\nwe did a review of how things went.\n\n41\n00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.380\nAnd then we did a retrospective as well.\n\n42\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.690\nSo now that we've done that,\nwe identified at\n\n43\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.830\nthe end of the iteration that\nwe might have improvements.\n\n44\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.470\nBut that we also might need\nto change our stories, and\n\n45\n00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.730\nwe might need to change\nour project backlog.\n\n46\n00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.290\nSo how do we do that?\n\n47\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.480\nWell, we've got a welcome change.\n\n48\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.140\nBefore we just cover that,\nI just wanna take a look at this.\n\n49\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.620\nThis one is a slide that we\nlooked at in a previous episode\n\n50\n00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.360\nright at the beginning of our series and\nthat's change or\n\n51\n00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.510\nthe difference between a traditional\nWaterfall approach and an Agile approach.\n\n52\n00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.880\nNow, if you 've been with us right all\nthe way through from the beginning of\n\n53\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.040\nthe series, you will see that\nas we started of this series,\n\n54\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.430\nCherokee was very much a lover of\nthe traditional waterfall approach.\n\n55\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.667\nAnd she didn't like scope creep and\nshe doesn't like change.\n\n56\n00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:46.217\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:48.490\n&gt;&gt; There's nothing I can do about that.\n\n58\n00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.750\nThere [LAUGH] really isn't.\n\n59\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.570\nHowever, there is a huge difference\nbetween the traditional waterfall approach\n\n60\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.520\nand the Agile approach.\n\n61\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.561\nBecause the traditional waterfall\napproach, Cherokee is right.\n\n62\n00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.610\nIn a traditional waterfall approach,\n\n63\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.760\nwe will agree on what we're\ndoing right up front.\n\n64\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.850\nAnd that’s not subject to change or at\nleast in a traditional waterfall approach,\n\n65\n00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.180\nit shouldn’t be subject to change.\n\n66\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.830\nThat’s what’s agreed up front,\nthat’s what we’re going to produce, and\n\n67\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.000\nthat’s what we work towards producing.\n\n68\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.160\nWhereas in an Agile environment,\nwe’re producing in increments.\n\n69\n00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.650\nWe’re producing iterations.\n\n70\n00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.920\nAnd so because we’re developing and\n\n71\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.200\nthen releasing in iterations,\nthen there's going to be change.\n\n72\n00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.400\nIt allows us to make changes because\nonce one iteration is finished,\n\n73\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.610\nwe can review that iteration and\nwe can make changes.\n\n74\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.940\nWe can add in new user stories, or\n\n75\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.480\nwe can amend the way that our\ncurrent functionality is.\n\n76\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.610\nSo maybe we've changed something,\nwe don't like it.\n\n77\n00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.890\nSo we can amend it and\nwe can do that in future iteration.\n\n78\n00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.750\nSo we actually actively embrace change and\nmore importantly, we can adopt the change.\n\n79\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.220\nBecause the whole way that we\nare organized really allows us to\n\n80\n00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.890\nbring change in at the end\nof every single iteration.\n\n81\n00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.250\nSo we can accommodate requests for\n\n82\n00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.210\nscope change, we can accommodate\nrequests for functionality change.\n\n83\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.732\nThat doesn't mean that we don't\nhave to evaluate it, because we do.\n\n84\n00:04:20.732 --> 00:04:25.151\nAnd we'll use our backlog as\na vehicle to evaluate change because\n\n85\n00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:29.647\nwe look at our user stories and\nwe look to see what's at standard and\n\n86\n00:04:29.647 --> 00:04:33.370\nwhat the priority is of those stories and\nto evaluate.\n\n87\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.820\nAnd understand the impact of change on\nthose stories and on those priorities.\n\n88\n00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.620\nBut certainly, in this Agile environment,\nwe're going to embrace change.\n\n89\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.405\nYou looked as though you were\nabout to say something there,\n\n90\n00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:49.670\nCherokee.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just listening to all\n\n91\n00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.470\nthe different things and for a change,\nI've got my active ears on and\n\n92\n00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.785\nI'm being quiet.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, fair enough, I like that.\n\n93\n00:04:58.785 --> 00:05:06.790\n[LAUGH] So change,\nI'm being taken aback by that, actually.\n\n94\n00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.630\nChanging means, what does it mean?\n\n95\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.288\nWell, it can mean a change\nto our existing backlog and\n\n96\n00:05:12.288 --> 00:05:14.660\na change to our existing stories.\n\n97\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.931\nBased on maybe what we've\nalready developed, or\n\n98\n00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:20.013\nperhaps based on the feedback that\nwe've had from the customer, or\n\n99\n00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:23.540\nbased on maybe a new requirement\nthat's coming from the customer.\n\n100\n00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.770\nA change can also mean something\nthat's completely different,\n\n101\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.275\nnot something that's been based\non what's happened in the past.\n\n102\n00:05:32.275 --> 00:05:33.660\nBut something that's completely different.\n\n103\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.658\nMaybe we've got a completely\nbrand new requirement.\n\n104\n00:05:37.658 --> 00:05:39.220\nEarlier in a previous episode,\n\n105\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.465\nI discussed the fact that Cherokee\nis my user in this instance.\n\n106\n00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:46.460\nShe's my business customer and\n\n107\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.550\nshe has, well, I've realized that\nshe keeps forgetting her password.\n\n108\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.790\nBut then that's because our\npassword policy is fairly strict.\n\n109\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.520\nAnd we can only use one password,\nyou can't repeat it again for\n\n110\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.740\nanother two years.\n\n111\n00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.160\nAnd you can't just add in\nincrements of one, two, three or\n\n112\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.390\nfour every time you reset your password.\n\n113\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.190\nAnd you've gotta change it every month.\n\n114\n00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.125\nSo what we've done is, so far,\nwe've explored the possibility\n\n115\n00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:16.806\nof giving Cherokee maybe\nsome functionality and\n\n116\n00:06:16.806 --> 00:06:21.489\nthe hardware to use fingerprints\nto use biometrics to log in.\n\n117\n00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:24.090\nAnd that was great, and\nwe worked with that.\n\n118\n00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.200\nAnd then we produced the increments and\n\n119\n00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.800\nwe released it and\neverything's working great.\n\n120\n00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.970\nAnd we're still actually working on\nthat project of implementing biometrics.\n\n121\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.209\nAnd then all of a sudden,\n\n122\n00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:38.514\nwe realize that actually Cherokee\nnow wants facial recognition.\n\n123\n00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:42.820\n[LAUGH] She's needy, that's all I can say.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n124\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.510\n&gt;&gt; But that's an enhancement.\n\n125\n00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.600\nIt's a new feature, but it's still\na part of the project of the biometrics.\n\n126\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.020\nBecause the one story we were working on,\nor\n\n127\n00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.250\nthat I mentioned just then, was the story\nof adding fingerprints just for Cherokee.\n\n128\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.180\nBut what Cherokee didn't realize is that\nthat was a far greater project made up of\n\n129\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.840\nmany user stories, such as adding\nfingerprint recognition to our logging in,\n\n130\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.640\nall of our services,\nincluding all of our mobile apps,\n\n131\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.250\nincluding getting into our front doors,\nincluding all of our security.\n\n132\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:22.010\nSo actually, Cherokee's story was just\none story in quite a number of stories.\n\n133\n00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.540\n&gt;&gt; Like a larger single sign-on.\n\n134\n00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.470\n&gt;&gt; RIght, yes, it was.\n\n135\n00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.960\nAnd now what she's done is she\nhas come to us and said, well,\n\n136\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.380\nokay, the fingerprints are great,\nthey're fine.\n\n137\n00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.240\nBut I've got a new requirement.\n\n138\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.490\nThat's change.\n\n139\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.940\nIt's an improvement, it's an enhancement.\n\n140\n00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.256\nAnd it's also a different requirement.\n\n141\n00:07:44.256 --> 00:07:48.889\nNow as a result of that, what could\nhappen is that as a product team and,\n\n142\n00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:54.217\nbearing in mind that this going to be done\nin conjunction with that business lead or\n\n143\n00:07:54.217 --> 00:07:56.845\nthat business relationship manager But\n\n144\n00:07:56.845 --> 00:08:01.270\nthe product owner may actually turn\naround and say, you know what?\n\n145\n00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.950\nMaybe the fingerprints aren’t needed.\n\n146\n00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.110\nMaybe we can remove fingerprints\nfrom some things and\n\n147\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.420\nmaybe we open the doors, physical\ndoors based on facial recognition.\n\n148\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.110\nSo instead of having fingerprints\nwe do that with facial recognition.\n\n149\n00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.670\nBecause let’s face it, when we come into\nwork on the morning we’ve got laptop bags\n\n150\n00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.600\nand everything else and maybe it's not so\naccessible for us, you know, our thumbs.\n\n151\n00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.080\nMaybe we can't do that as\nwell as opening a door,\n\n152\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.439\nmaybe we should use facial recognition.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n153\n00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:30.675\n&gt;&gt; So we can even,\n\n154\n00:08:30.675 --> 00:08:36.287\nas part of the end of one iteration and\nbefore we move into the next one,\n\n155\n00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:40.474\nwe're gonna take a time to\naccommodate change, and\n\n156\n00:08:40.474 --> 00:08:46.110\nwe might actually remove things,\nor even just reprioritize things.\n\n157\n00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.630\nSo it's generally the business\nthat leads a drive for change.\n\n158\n00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.570\nIt's the business that says,\nyes, this is what I need.\n\n159\n00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:59.080\nIt's not something for the most part\nthat we would recommend unless,\n\n160\n00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.870\nand there are obvious\ninstances where we would\n\n161\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.210\nget involved in actually driving\nchange and recommending change.\n\n162\n00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.900\nAnd that would be maybe\nthe industry's moved on, and\n\n163\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.440\nmaybe the version of the operating\nsystem that we're working on right now\n\n164\n00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.370\nhas just been announced that it is going\nto be retired, in which case then,\n\n165\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.300\nthat might be something\nthat we would use to drive\n\n166\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.830\nchange from that particular announcement.\n&gt;&gt; Or even, I'm thinking like, and\n\n167\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:32.000\nthis is just from experience, I'm like if\nyou're getting those external changes,\n\n168\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.860\nwhich like culminate into almost like hey,\nyou know what?\n\n169\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.470\nWith these additional changes,\nwe might wanna go ahead and\n\n170\n00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.990\ntake a look at this because it\nsounds like you're heading that way.\n\n171\n00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.347\nThis is a little bit more streamlined.\n\n172\n00:09:43.347 --> 00:09:44.910\nLet's go ahead and do it this way.\n\n173\n00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but one thing I will say,\n\n175\n00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:52.542\nbuilding on what you just said there, is\nwe don't actually make changes midstream\n\n176\n00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:54.624\nin an increment.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n177\n00:09:54.624 --> 00:09:55.600\n&gt;&gt; We wait until\n\n178\n00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.469\nthe-\n&gt;&gt; Then we fail.\n\n179\n00:09:56.469 --> 00:10:01.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can fail,\n\n180\n00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.060\nthat's all right, it's not a problem.\n\n181\n00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.430\nBut you don't want to\nmake changes midstream.\n\n182\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.570\nWhat we'll do is we'll wait\nuntil the end of the increment,\n\n183\n00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.330\nand that's when we implement\nthe change to the next iteration, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.370\nWe don't want to make changes midstream.\n\n185\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.760\nIf it's an active iteration,\n\n186\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.440\nas we call it, then we definitely\ndon't wanna make changes to that.\n\n187\n00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:26.480\nSo how do we then, well that next slide\nmentions effecting a change process.\n\n188\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.780\nBut here's a simplified change process,\nand\n\n189\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.230\nthis is how we actually\nimplement a change.\n\n190\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:37.040\nWe simply write the new and changed story,\nthen we estimate that change, and\n\n191\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.408\nthen we prioritize it, and we update\nour iteration and our release plan.\n\n192\n00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:46.395\nSounds simple [LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:48.910\nNothing is ever as simple as it sounds,\nlet's face it.\n\n194\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.820\nDid you notice the evil laugh there?\n\n195\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.643\n[LAUGH] It sounds simple, but\n\n196\n00:10:53.643 --> 00:10:58.710\nyou see a change can impact\nsomething else as well.\n\n197\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.470\nSo, Yes.\n\n198\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:07.680\nWhen we make a change, we want to\ndocument it and then we will re-estimate.\n\n199\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.970\nIf we're changing an existing story\nwe then have to re-estimate and\n\n200\n00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.658\npotentially we prioritize that story.\n\n201\n00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:21.657\nBut if we bring a new story in,\nwell not only do we have to estimate and\n\n202\n00:11:21.657 --> 00:11:29.045\nprioritize that new story, but you might\nhave an adverse effect on other stories.\n\n203\n00:11:29.045 --> 00:11:34.424\nAnd you see this is why right at\nthe very start of this particular\n\n204\n00:11:34.424 --> 00:11:40.212\nseries when we looked at the theories\nof agile project management,\n\n205\n00:11:40.212 --> 00:11:46.706\none of the, I guess, the pillars that we\nlooked at were the fact that we do not\n\n206\n00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:51.710\nplan too far ahead in great\ndetail because things change.\n\n207\n00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.020\nSo we will prioritize and\n\n208\n00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.800\nwe will estimate at a high level for\nthe whole project.\n\n209\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.830\nBut then at the start of each iteration,\n\n210\n00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.840\nthat's when we do our definitive plan and\nwe will then allocate,\n\n211\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:17.480\nwe will convert those ideal days\ninto real days for each iteration.\n\n212\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.350\nAnd we don't waste time planning in great\ndetail the long term because of this,\n\n213\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.990\nBecause of what's in front of you\nright now, Because things change.\n\n214\n00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.580\nAnd so if I've brought something in,\nthere is a good chance that it's going to\n\n215\n00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.600\nhave an impact on what\nI've already planned.\n\n216\n00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.780\nSo if I've got five years of stories\nplanned for my next iteration,\n\n217\n00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.790\nwhich is iteration two, and then I've got\nsix years of stories planned for iteration\n\n218\n00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.715\nthree, and now I've just written an extra\ntwo and I've realized that they're urgent\n\n219\n00:12:49.715 --> 00:12:54.930\nthen I have got to move my user stories\nfrom iteration to an iterational play.\n\n220\n00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.840\nI have got to reprioritize,\nI have got to move them around.\n\n221\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.254\nThis is why we don't plan too far ahead\nin any great detail because of change,\n\n222\n00:13:04.254 --> 00:13:07.016\nbecause we accept that things change.\n\n223\n00:13:07.016 --> 00:13:12.520\nIn the traditional waterfell approach\nwe will try and plan as much as we can.\n\n224\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.110\nBut then that leaves us fairly\ninflexible when it comes to change, and\n\n225\n00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.370\nthis is how we end up with our awful term,\nI hate it, scope creep.\n\n226\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.430\nAnd scope creep is really about\naccepting that something's changed,\n\n227\n00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:32.490\nmaybe the schedule's changed,\nmaybe our backlog's changed, our task,\n\n228\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.160\nwe haven't got through our task\nas quickly as we anticipated.\n\n229\n00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.320\nAnd so we end up with scope creep for\nwhatever reason.\n\n230\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.310\nHere, in an Agile environment, we accept\nthat there's going to be change, so\n\n231\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.580\nwe allow for change.\n\n232\n00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.150\nAnd what we'll say is, well okay then,\n\n233\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:53.150\nwe're only gonna plan at a very high\nlevel overall, over the entire project.\n\n234\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.693\nAnd then, for each iteration,\nonce we've planned each iteration,\n\n235\n00:13:57.693 --> 00:14:02.313\nwhich is only for the next four weeks\nmaximum, that bit's cast in stone\n\n236\n00:14:02.313 --> 00:14:06.861\nbecause we have to know what we're\ngoing to do for the next four weeks.\n\n237\n00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:09.247\nYou can't bungalow along\nfrom week to week.\n\n238\n00:14:09.247 --> 00:14:10.341\n&gt;&gt; Roll the dice, and say,\n\n239\n00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:12.100\nwhat are we doing today.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n240\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.120\nThat's not efficient.\n\n241\n00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.160\nIt really is not going to be\nan efficient way of doing anything, and\n\n242\n00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.850\nit's definitely not going to be effective.\n\n243\n00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.980\nIt is not going to deliver anything that\nis going to be useful because, every day,\n\n244\n00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.170\nwe could something different.\n\n245\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:23.970\nI mean, why not?\n\n246\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.120\nI got bored yesterday, so\nI want to do something else today.\n\n247\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.120\nAll right, no,\nwe don't wanna do that, okay.\n\n248\n00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.460\nSo we've got to accommodate change.\n\n249\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.940\nBut we still have to have a process for\nit.\n\n250\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.140\nAnd although we don't have\ncomprehensive documentation,\n\n251\n00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.350\nyou still gotta manage change.\n\n252\n00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.340\nAnd that process that you've got in\nfront of you right now is so simple.\n\n253\n00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.120\nIt belongs to that so\nto keep it simple approach.\n\n254\n00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.310\nIt's so simple but\nwe still have to manage it.\n\n255\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.438\nIt doesn't just happen in a night or.\n\n256\n00:14:53.438 --> 00:14:55.180\nWe're not just rolling die every morning.\n\n257\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.030\n[LAUGH] That's not gonna happen.\n\n258\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.444\nSo now we've discussed change, I wanna\ndiscuss something else that we looked at\n\n259\n00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:05.694\nright at the very start [LAUGH] certhainly\nit was mentioned at the start of\n\n260\n00:15:05.694 --> 00:15:08.030\nthe episode.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.150\n&gt;&gt; But mentioned in a different way,\n\n262\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.270\nby the way.\n\n263\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:17.640\nI want to discuss something that we would\nconsider to be called an impediment.\n\n264\n00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.955\nHowever\n&gt;&gt; Impediment\n\n265\n00:15:20.955 --> 00:15:22.677\n&gt;&gt; I don't know where that came from, and\n\n266\n00:15:22.677 --> 00:15:24.891\nI'm sorry [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n267\n00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:27.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just wanna say that right\n\n268\n00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:28.200\nnow.\n\n269\n00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.060\nIt hurts my ears.\n\n270\n00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:34.070\nAn impediment is anything\nthat blocks progress.\n\n271\n00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:38.561\nIt's anything that either prohibits\nus from going any further, or\n\n272\n00:15:38.561 --> 00:15:43.207\nanything that just causes an obstacle\nthat we have to try to get round or\n\n273\n00:15:43.207 --> 00:15:45.831\nget over something that slows us down.\n\n274\n00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:50.163\nAnd impediments can be, they can be\nsomething to completely stops us as I've\n\n275\n00:15:50.163 --> 00:15:53.910\nalready said or it can be something\nthat just simply slows us down.\n\n276\n00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.859\nSo including things like dependencies and\nin a previous episode We\n\n277\n00:15:57.859 --> 00:16:01.806\nexplored the fact that I can't get\non with my high priority tasks,\n\n278\n00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:04.784\nuntil Cherokee's finished\nher priority tasks.\n\n279\n00:16:04.784 --> 00:16:07.976\nSo therefore the first thing I'm\ngonna work on is actually a medium\n\n280\n00:16:07.976 --> 00:16:09.220\npriority task.\n\n281\n00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:14.133\nNot because my other tasks are un-high\npriority, but simply because,\n\n282\n00:16:14.133 --> 00:16:16.802\nCherokee's got to finish hers first.\n\n283\n00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:18.620\nAnd so, that's a dependency.\n\n284\n00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.530\nAnd that's one form of impediment.\n\n285\n00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.950\nThere's also impediments such as not\nhaving the right resources available.\n\n286\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.500\nIt mentions technical and\nhuman resources there.\n\n287\n00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.920\nBut it could also be, I mean a resource\nis something like finance, as well,\n\n288\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.880\nnot having the right money available.\n\n289\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.840\nAnd even though we agree\nour resources upfront, or\n\n290\n00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.370\nrather we agree our budget upfront.\n\n291\n00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:44.110\nSometimes in a project, and\nwe haven't explored this at all, but\n\n292\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.380\nsometimes the money is released\nto you in an iterative way.\n\n293\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.274\nIt's not always released upfront.\n\n294\n00:16:49.274 --> 00:16:51.760\nIt's not always available to\nyou right there and then.\n\n295\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.510\nSo that could be an impediment in itself.\n\n296\n00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.450\nOr maybe we've discovered that that\npiece of software that we need to go out\n\n297\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.140\nand buy.\n\n298\n00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.550\nOr the hardware that we need to go out and\nbuy has actually just gone up in price.\n\n299\n00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.440\nOr maybe it's no longer available and\nwe've got to evaluate something else and\n\n300\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.610\nthat costs twice as much as\nwe'd originally budgeted for.\n\n301\n00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:14.540\nAnd then you also got the fact that the\nperson that you had originally scheduled\n\n302\n00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.840\nto perform that particular\ntask is away on vacation.\n\n303\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.770\n&gt;&gt; You could go for days,\n\n304\n00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.850\nresource allocation and\nresource depletion can be a huge thing.\n\n305\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:27.330\nSeasonal, trying to put deposits or\nget machinery or\n\n306\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.010\nwhatever kind of project you're working\non here I guess in software developing.\n\n307\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:36.480\nBut, there are just so many things that\ncould potentially become an impediment.\n\n308\n00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.825\n&gt;&gt; Or even an impediment.\n\n309\n00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:40.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n310\n00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.710\n&gt;&gt; But yes, there's a lot of things, and\n\n311\n00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:48.070\nthis is why we're planning our\niterations between one and four weeks.\n\n312\n00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.200\nAnd so if we've got an iteration, and\nthat's actually an important point.\n\n313\n00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.940\nIf you've got an iteration, and\nyou know in one of your user's stories,\n\n314\n00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.870\nthat you're going to need\na particular piece of hardware.\n\n315\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.750\nBut, that piece of hardware has\ngot an eight week lead time.\n\n316\n00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.430\nThat means you can't\njust start planning for\n\n317\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.280\nthat particular story at\nthe beginning of an iteration.\n\n318\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.920\nCuz you've only got four\nweeks at that iteration.\n\n319\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.790\nSo that means that we gotta be realistic\nabout some of the tasks that we do\n\n320\n00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.630\nin our Agile project.\n\n321\n00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.240\nAnd we have to understand\nsome of the dependencies, and\n\n322\n00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.978\nif we do have a dependency,\n\n323\n00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:30.010\nwith a lead time of 8 weeks or 12 weeks,\nthen we've got to tackle that.\n\n324\n00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.240\nWe've got to do something about that.\n\n325\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.710\nYou can't just ignore it,\nbecause that's always going to delay your\n\n326\n00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.900\nability to conclude your iteration.\n\n327\n00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.210\nYou can't just do that at\nthe beginning of the iteration.\n\n328\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.700\nYou've gotta plan in\nadvance in some instances.\n\n329\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.610\nAnd this is where the waterfall\napproach really comes into its own.\n\n330\n00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.530\nBecause a waterfall approach\nallows us to do that.\n\n331\n00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:58.660\nWhereas I've heard people say,\nif you take Agile too literally,\n\n332\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.090\nthen unfortunately taking it too\nliterally doesn't allow you to do that.\n\n333\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.340\nSo you gotta be careful,\nAgile's not plug and play.\n\n334\n00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.230\nIt's not a prescriptive approach.\n\n335\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:12.036\nAnd so you've got to think of\nthis with with common sense.\n\n336\n00:19:12.036 --> 00:19:13.660\n&gt;&gt; Common sense written down Jo.\n\n337\n00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.420\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n338\n00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.050\nyeah, that's what I like to say.\n\n339\n00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.785\nIt is just common sense written down, but\nstill you got to apply common sense too.\n\n340\n00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:21.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.466\n&gt;&gt; So what else have we got that could be\n\n342\n00:19:23.466 --> 00:19:25.010\nan impediment?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n343\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.070\n&gt;&gt; Well you know,\n\n344\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:31.458\nwe cannot underestimate and when we\nstarted off this series looking at Agile,\n\n345\n00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:33.920\nwe talked a lot about people.\n\n346\n00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.700\nAnd having people with\nthe right skills and\n\n347\n00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.570\nhaving people engaged and\nbringing people on board.\n\n348\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.900\nAnd making sure that we're\ngetting the best out of them.\n\n349\n00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.260\nAnd even acknowledging the fact that 100%\nof their time they're not productive,\n\n350\n00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.860\nthey're only productive\nabout 50% of their time.\n\n351\n00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.180\nWell, okay, but then let's bring in\nmorale, let's bring in motivation.\n\n352\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.880\nAnd if you are not working\nin a collaborative team,\n\n353\n00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:03.360\nwhere you feel empowered and where\nyou're able to get on with your work.\n\n354\n00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.660\nWithout any interruptions,\nwithout any distractions.\n\n355\n00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.905\nIf you're being micromanaged,\nthen you're not going to be\n\n356\n00:20:11.905 --> 00:20:16.870\n100% productive,\neven during your productive times.\n\n357\n00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:20.420\nYou're still not going to be as\nproductive as you need to be.\n\n358\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.394\n&gt;&gt; If you're demoralized,\n\n359\n00:20:23.394 --> 00:20:26.950\nif you're demotivated,\nyou're not gonna give it 100%.\n\n360\n00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:34.370\nAnd this is why over or under engaged\nstakeholders are actually an impediment.\n\n361\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:41.079\nThe last thing I feel like on\na morning when I come in here,\n\n362\n00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:46.042\nis watching Cherokee jumping around.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hold on because I don't\n\n363\n00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:49.267\nhave enough energy for that unless...\n&gt;&gt; Full of energy or\n\n364\n00:20:49.267 --> 00:20:53.230\nfull of caffeine I think.\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting bombarded first thing.\n\n365\n00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.785\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's not conducive to a good\n\n366\n00:20:55.785 --> 00:20:57.160\nproject either.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That would never happen.\n\n367\n00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.801\n&gt;&gt; We have to have I was gonna say,\n\n368\n00:20:58.801 --> 00:21:02.098\nwe have to have a stable project team,\nthat doesn't happen.\n\n369\n00:21:02.098 --> 00:21:05.681\nThat doesn't happen in here.\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm on the flip side of that,\n\n370\n00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:10.640\nI need an IV of caffeine.\n&gt;&gt; We've gotta have a balance there,\n\n371\n00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.870\ncuz having one team member that's\nreally sort of over enthusiastic\n\n372\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.936\n&gt;&gt; And having another team member\n\n373\n00:21:15.936 --> 00:21:16.908\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.916\n&gt;&gt; That's not quite feeling it today,\n\n375\n00:21:18.916 --> 00:21:21.652\nthat's not gonna help\na team production either.\n\n376\n00:21:21.652 --> 00:21:24.320\nAnd yeah, I know it sounds funny,\n&gt;&gt; We're joking but\n\n377\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.203\n&gt;&gt; And good but we can trivialized it but\n\n378\n00:21:26.203 --> 00:21:27.674\nit's still an impediment.\n\n379\n00:21:27.674 --> 00:21:29.843\nWe're thinking about\nthe efficiency of our project.\n\n380\n00:21:29.843 --> 00:21:34.140\nAnd all of these what we might\ncall sort of the soft attributes,\n\n381\n00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.390\nare equally as important as\nthe technical attributes to any project.\n\n382\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.050\nAnd I know that when it\ncomes to Agile methodology,\n\n383\n00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.350\nwe do spend a lot of time\ndiscussing the soft attributes.\n\n384\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.510\nWell, that's because the soft attributes\nare important to the project.\n\n385\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:52.252\nWithout considering the self attribution\nyou're never gonna succeed in your\n\n386\n00:21:52.252 --> 00:21:53.107\nproject, okay?\n\n387\n00:21:53.107 --> 00:21:55.910\nSo think about what your impediments are.\n\n388\n00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:59.225\nWhether there are dependencies,\nor resources or,\n\n389\n00:21:59.225 --> 00:22:04.460\nin the bottom right hand corner there\na test environment could an impediment.\n\n390\n00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:09.360\nOr even a stakeholder or\nmember of the team that might be sick or\n\n391\n00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.820\nmight be on vacation.\n\n392\n00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.840\nThese are all impediments.\n\n393\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.320\nThese are all going to prevent or\n\n394\n00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.420\ncertainly going to delay\nyou from moving forward.\n\n395\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.800\nRemember the team members.\n\n396\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.840\nWe can quite often\nidentify impediments but\n\n397\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.122\nwe might not have it within our\npower to be able to remove them.\n\n398\n00:22:28.122 --> 00:22:31.270\nOr even to be able to bypass them.\n\n399\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.880\nSo if you identify an impediment,\n\n400\n00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:39.010\nthere has to be some way of\ncommunicating that to the team.\n\n401\n00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:43.420\nHow do you think we should do that?\n&gt;&gt; During our morning stand up.\n\n402\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.280\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\n\n403\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.035\nyou either read the rest of this slide.\n\n404\n00:22:46.035 --> 00:22:47.020\n[LAUGH] No,\n\n405\n00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.900\nyou're really good That's what I would do.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what our\n\n406\n00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.260\nmorning standup is for.\n\n407\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.846\nIs when we talked about that\nthe standup in a previous episode,\n\n408\n00:22:56.846 --> 00:23:00.311\nand we've talked about it a few\ntimes in a previous episode.\n\n409\n00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:04.070\nThe standup is there to communicate\nwhat we're doing right now but\n\n410\n00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:08.567\nthe standup is also there to communicate\nany obstacles, and any impediments,\n\n411\n00:23:08.567 --> 00:23:09.940\nas we would call them.\n\n412\n00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.820\nAnd so I guess that's exactly\nwhen we would communicate that.\n\n413\n00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.196\n&gt;&gt; But I'm kind of adding to that,\n\n414\n00:23:15.196 --> 00:23:18.330\nreal quick, because.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n415\n00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.048\n&gt;&gt; Let's just say if it were something\n\n416\n00:23:21.048 --> 00:23:27.388\nthat would, I don't know, if there's any\nkind of like personal element to that,\n\n417\n00:23:27.388 --> 00:23:33.211\nthen I would probably do that aside in\nprivate with the actual scrub master.\n\n418\n00:23:33.211 --> 00:23:37.623\nFor something that I felt like\nmight hurt somebody, then,\n\n419\n00:23:37.623 --> 00:23:42.578\nthen I might decide to take it in private.\n&gt;&gt; But bearing in mind,\n\n420\n00:23:42.578 --> 00:23:44.630\nthat you have to consider this.\n\n421\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:48.085\nThat when we come into the Agile\nproject enviornment we havce to look at\n\n422\n00:23:48.085 --> 00:23:49.578\nthe Agile Project-\n&gt;&gt; Obejectivity of it.\n\n423\n00:23:49.578 --> 00:23:51.856\n&gt;&gt; Objectively, right.\n\n424\n00:23:51.856 --> 00:23:55.746\nAnd we've got to be of\na mindset where we're not,\n\n425\n00:23:55.746 --> 00:23:59.275\nI was gonna say where\nwe're grown up enough.\n\n426\n00:23:59.275 --> 00:24:04.340\nBut we've gotta be of a mindset were we're\nnot going to take things personally.\n\n427\n00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.150\nCuz if you start bringing\nyour emotions into it, again,\n\n428\n00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.490\nyou're affecting\nthe efficiency of the team.\n\n429\n00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.070\nYou're affecting the work\nthat's being done.\n\n430\n00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:17.090\nSo we have to be in a position, and\nI admire your sensitivities, but\n\n431\n00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.680\nwe all have to be in a position where\nwe're looking at the project objectively.\n\n432\n00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.740\nAnd we have to accept that sometimes\nwe're not very good at certain things.\n\n433\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.420\nI accept that sometimes,\nit's been a long time.\n\n434\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.980\nIt's been 20 odd years\nsince I got my MCSE, so\n\n435\n00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.560\nplease don't put anything like\nthat in front me right now.\n\n436\n00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.010\nI'm not the best person for\nthat work, but you are.\n\n437\n00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.430\nSo maybe when it came to be, and\nif we were to think about our roles,\n\n438\n00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:48.370\nI would probably be the Agile coach,\nor the scrum master.\n\n439\n00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:53.435\nYou would be a product owner,\nand that's okay.\n\n440\n00:24:53.435 --> 00:24:56.500\nThere's no right or wrong person to be.\n\n441\n00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.620\nAnd there is no extra kudos\nin any particular role.\n\n442\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.340\nBoth roles are equally as important.\n\n443\n00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.750\nAnd so we've all got to understand\nthat even during stand-up,\n\n444\n00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.220\nwe all play a part in the team.\n\n445\n00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.510\nThere's no hierarchy within the team.\n\n446\n00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.290\nIt's a collaborative team.\n\n447\n00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.210\nAnd that's something\nelse that's important.\n\n448\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.020\nThink about this from the other side.\n\n449\n00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.919\nIf I see you run into the scrum master,\n\n450\n00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:26.935\nwhat [LAUGH] am I gonna think?\n&gt;&gt; What is Cherokee doing?\n\n451\n00:25:26.935 --> 00:25:28.131\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n452\n00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:30.902\nSo it doesn't promote good teamwork.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n453\n00:25:30.902 --> 00:25:32.677\nI could see that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n454\n00:25:32.677 --> 00:25:34.794\nif I see you run into the scrum master-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It's a tough one.\n\n455\n00:25:34.794 --> 00:25:35.696\nLike I said,\n\n456\n00:25:35.696 --> 00:25:40.948\nme with the interpersonal things like\ngive me a computer all day, but yeah.\n\n457\n00:25:40.948 --> 00:25:43.331\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now maybe it's because I'm British and\n\n458\n00:25:43.331 --> 00:25:44.460\nwe're used to being blonde.\n\n459\n00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.690\nAnd you're southern and\nyou're just too polite, right?\n\n460\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.600\nMaybe that's the thing.\n\n461\n00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.940\nBut if I see you go running to\nthe scrum master, I'm gonna be curious.\n\n462\n00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.190\nThat's not gonna do much for\nour team dynamic.\n\n463\n00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:01.500\nIt's important that within any Agile team\nthat we have a really good team dynamic.\n\n464\n00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.030\nAnd I know that we addressed this\nin one of our previous episodes.\n\n465\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.216\nBut it really is key that the team\nis able to collaborate and\n\n466\n00:26:09.216 --> 00:26:10.719\nthe team is able to be open.\n\n467\n00:26:10.719 --> 00:26:14.067\nAnd we talked about openness and\nwe talked about transparency.\n\n468\n00:26:14.067 --> 00:26:20.470\nAnd so we have to be able to discuss\nimpediments [LAUGH] in an objective way.\n\n469\n00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:25.455\nAnd sure, if we need to take that away\nfrom the stand-up and if we need to say,\n\n470\n00:26:25.455 --> 00:26:29.367\nokay, if the scrum master at\nsome point in time needs to say,\n\n471\n00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:33.390\nI need to address that with\nthe two of you, then that's okay.\n\n472\n00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:39.440\nBut we shouldn't feel as though\nwe're not able to be open and\n\n473\n00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.710\ntransparent with our team.\n\n474\n00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.010\nBecause that, in itself, is an impediment.\n\n475\n00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.223\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's her\n\n476\n00:26:45.223 --> 00:26:46.051\n[INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n477\n00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:46.898\n&gt;&gt; Now listen,\n\n478\n00:26:46.898 --> 00:26:50.602\ntomorrow's stand-up let's\nsee what happens, guys.\n\n479\n00:26:50.602 --> 00:26:51.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not going.\n\n480\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.830\nI'm not going.\n\n481\n00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:53.610\nI'm staying here.\n\n482\n00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.330\nI'm being late tomorrow now.\n\n483\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.422\nWell, we've gotta make sure that we do.\n\n484\n00:26:59.422 --> 00:27:02.840\nWe've gotta be most efficient, we've\ngotta be the most efficient for the team.\n\n485\n00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.200\nSo what we've gotta make sure that\nwe do is remove any impediments.\n\n486\n00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.407\nAnd if I think that you can remove\nthe impediment better than I can,\n\n487\n00:27:11.407 --> 00:27:13.072\nthen I'm going to say it.\n\n488\n00:27:13.072 --> 00:27:15.550\nBut if I believe that you\nare causing the impediment,\n\n489\n00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.428\nthen I'm gonna say that as well.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n490\n00:27:17.428 --> 00:27:18.189\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n491\n00:27:18.189 --> 00:27:22.099\nit really depends on what\nthe impediment is too.\n\n492\n00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:24.660\nBecause it'll tell you there\nthat the project manager or\n\n493\n00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.890\nthat scrum master is responsible for\nremoving the impediment.\n\n494\n00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:32.850\nIf the impediment happens to be something\ntechnical, if it's something to\n\n495\n00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.650\ndo with functionality, would,\nand this is a question for\n\n496\n00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.020\nyou, would the product owner be involved?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n497\n00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, it depends.\n\n498\n00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.812\nCuz the product owner is responsible for\nthe product.\n\n499\n00:27:46.812 --> 00:27:52.570\nIf there's likely to be some impediment,\ntechnically speaking\n\n500\n00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:59.100\nthat impediment, it's not going to be\nan impediment to the coding, is it?\n\n501\n00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.130\nIt's actually gonna be an impediment\nto caused by the operating system or\n\n502\n00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:08.560\ncaused by the fact that maybe we can't get\nthe hardware in on time, for instance.\n\n503\n00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.000\nSo not always.\n\n504\n00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.710\nThe product owner's only gonna be\ninvolved in that if it actually affects\n\n505\n00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:19.670\nthe product that's being released,\ni.e., if the impediment is caused by\n\n506\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:23.850\nthe product that's being released.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n507\n00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:24.671\n&gt;&gt; There's a thought.\n\n508\n00:28:24.671 --> 00:28:29.530\n[LAUGH] Impediments have gotta be\nvisible across the whole team,\n\n509\n00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:34.070\nbearing in mind that our\nteam could consist of, well,\n\n510\n00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.330\nit should consist of everybody\nthat's involved on the project.\n\n511\n00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.810\nAnd so our stand-ups would consist of\neverybody that's involved on the project.\n\n512\n00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:45.455\nSo we should all be aware of them\nbecause one of us might have a solution.\n\n513\n00:28:45.455 --> 00:28:52.580\n[LAUGH] If you and I aren't getting\non together, and I happen to mention,\n\n514\n00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.900\nI've gotta work with Cherokee today in our\nstand-up meeting, then it might well be\n\n515\n00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:02.380\nthat Ronnie sorta jumps in and says, I'll\ntell you what, I'll work with you, Jo.\n\n516\n00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.860\nBecause then that sort of\nremoves you from harm's way.\n\n517\n00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.680\n&gt;&gt; Is this a clue?\n\n518\n00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.610\nIf you guys see Ronnie in the next show,\n\n519\n00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:13.164\nthen you'll understand.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, exactly.\n\n520\n00:29:13.164 --> 00:29:19.150\n[LAUGH] I might just do that\njust deliberately, but yeah.\n\n521\n00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:23.383\nSo that's stand-up allows\nus to communicate that.\n\n522\n00:29:23.383 --> 00:29:25.261\nWe've gotta employ tact, all right?\n\n523\n00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:27.710\n[LAUGH] And we've gotta make sure\nwe are all part of the team.\n\n524\n00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.640\nWe do have to be objective.\n\n525\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.450\nUltimately, what we should all\nbe aiming for, and whether we're\n\n526\n00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.880\nbringing in a new change all whether we're\nactually trying to remove an impediment,\n\n527\n00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.630\nwhat we're aiming for\nis the delivery of value to the customer.\n\n528\n00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:45.080\nAnd we're aiming for\nthe addition of change.\n\n529\n00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.990\nWe're aiming to bring change in and\nat the same time remove impediments.\n\n530\n00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.690\nBut ultimately,\nwhat we've gotta do is deliver value for\n\n531\n00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.983\nour customer.\n&gt;&gt; That's key, because they're ones with\n\n532\n00:29:55.983 --> 00:29:58.779\nthat perceived value, so.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, yeah, and\n\n533\n00:29:58.779 --> 00:29:59.808\non that note-\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n534\n00:29:59.808 --> 00:30:03.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I will stop right there.\n\n535\n00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:03.890\nLet's go ahead and sign out.\n\n536\n00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.050\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n537\n00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.940\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n538\n00:30:10.940 -->

00:00:12.462\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT ProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome\n\n4\n00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:15.610\neveryone to\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.710\nI am your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.650\nIn this episode we'll be taking\na look at third party interfaces.\n\n7\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.510\nAnd back with us in studios\ntoday we have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.230\nthank you so much for joining us Jo.\n\n9\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.110\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm great thank you Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.760\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n11\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.940\nThanks for asking.\n\n12\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.430\nSo Jo what will be looking at\n\n13\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.330\nin this episode?\n&gt;&gt; What we're going to be looking at is\n\n14\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.090\nnone of the technical details, and\nI know that's what makes you excited, but\n\n15\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.320\nunfortunately not today.\n&gt;&gt; I know you say the term interface and\n\n16\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.630\nmy mind starts to go like components and\nrouter configuration,\n\n17\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.060\nbut none of that, right?\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're not actually\n\n18\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.570\nbuilding anything right here, what we're\ndoing is we're managing the project.\n\n19\n00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.650\nAnd so, in this particular episode,\n\n20\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.560\nwhat we're going to look at\nare the interfaces that we have to manage,\n\n21\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.810\nnot the ones that we have to build.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n22\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.529\n&gt;&gt; So what we're gonna be doing is we're\n\n23\n00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:07.960\ngonna be looking at interfaces or, rather,\nyou might want to call them relationships\n\n24\n00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.190\nfor instance, and that's relationships\nwith maybe other vendors,\n\n25\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.700\nor third parties, suppliers, that\nare using different methodologies to you.\n\n26\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.910\nOr maybe even different projects within\nyour own sort of organization and\n\n27\n00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.230\nwith your own development teams that\nare using different approaches to you,\n\n28\n00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.820\nhow do you actually\ninteract with these people?\n\n29\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.090\nSo that's what's on the agenda for\nthis particular episode.\n\n30\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.520\nIs just looking at\nrelationship management,\n\n31\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.720\nthat's really what we're doing.\n\n32\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.595\nSo lets take a look at our first slide\nthen that we have in front of us.\n\n33\n00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:43.860\nThere's no guarantee that the way that\nyou work is gonna be exactly the same\n\n34\n00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.950\nas the way that your suppliers, your third\nparties, or even your customers work.\n\n35\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.310\nThey might work in\na slightly different way.\n\n36\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.400\nAnd whilst what we're trying to\ndo here in agile is we are trying\n\n37\n00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.330\nto deliver value to our customers, and\nI say trying, but we should be doing\n\n38\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.160\na little bit more than just trying,\nbecause we should be delivering value.\n\n39\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.430\nIf we're not, then we shouldn't\nbe doing anything, let's face it.\n\n40\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.000\nSo we wanna deliver value to the\ncustomers, but if well, if our customers\n\n41\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.840\nwork at a slightly different way, or\nif our suppliers work a slightly different\n\n42\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.960\nway, then that's going to cause\nproblems for us, potentially.\n\n43\n00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.840\nLet's just imagine this and, well, I could\nsay let's get a little bit technical,\n\n44\n00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.110\nbut I know that you're going to\nout techie me, anyway, Cherokee.\n\n45\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.160\nSo maybe let's not get too technical.\n\n46\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.270\nBut let's just say that we are,\nI know that in previous episodes\n\n47\n00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.700\nwe've been looking to at the concept\nof maybe adding in some biometrics and\n\n48\n00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.800\nfingerprint scanning, right maybe,\ninto our sign-on services.\n\n49\n00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.530\nAnd so let's just say that\nwe're trying to do this.\n\n50\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.708\nWe've already explored in previous\nepisodes the fact that we've\n\n51\n00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:54.345\ngot user stories and we've got two\nuser stories, part of one epic story.\n\n52\n00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:58.520\nOne epic story is to,\ncan you remember what it is?\n\n53\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was to use fingerprint\n\n54\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.770\nrecognition to utilize single sign-ons for\nall of our applications and\n\n55\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.220\nenvironment.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n56\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.295\nperfect, that was actually the vision.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, something like that.\n\n57\n00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:14.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But no,\n\n58\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.940\nno, the epic story was actually two\nutilize the fingerprint scan in.\n\n59\n00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.770\nSo in other words to, not necessarily\nthe single sign-on but to actually,\n\n60\n00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.130\nthe first story, the epic story,\nwas to bring in fingerprint scanning.\n\n61\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.630\nThe single sign on bit\nwas kind of our vision.\n\n62\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.900\nBecause that's what the project's\ngoing to do as a whole.\n\n63\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.330\nBut we've got to think in iteration.\n\n64\n00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.100\nSo we've got to break it down.\n\n65\n00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.980\nSo the first story really which is\nactually turns out to be an epic story.\n\n66\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.130\nBut that first story was about having\nfingerprint recognition on our hardware.\n\n67\n00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.975\nAnd that consisted then of two stories.\n\n68\n00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:58.250\nCuz we had to break that down, and\nthe two stories were the software,\n\n69\n00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.920\nwe've gotta get the software and\nwe've gotta get the hardware.\n\n70\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.010\nNow for the most part we\nare developers I would expect us\n\n71\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.310\nas developers to be developing\nthe software and that's what we do.\n\n72\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.620\nBut then the other story is for-\n&gt;&gt; The hardware.\n\n73\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.610\n&gt;&gt; The hardware, right.\n\n74\n00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.660\nWhen was the last time you\nbuilt your own hardware?\n\n75\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.965\nI know you're gonna say yesterday.\n\n76\n00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:23.710\n[LAUGH] When was the last time you\nbuilt your own hardware, Cherokee?\n\n77\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.988\n&gt;&gt; Actually, it has been a while.\n\n78\n00:04:25.988 --> 00:04:27.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] so\n\n79\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.880\nwe don't tend to do that,\nunless we're sort of part of the big\n\n80\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.530\ncorporations ourselves, then we really\ndon't tend to build our own hardware.\n\n81\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.000\nAnd even then, If you were part\nof a big organization, like HP or\n\n82\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.830\nDell, then actually, the group that\ndevelops the software is completely\n\n83\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.996\nseparate business from the group.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was about to say they usually\n\n84\n00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.584\nhave different divisions for that.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n85\n00:04:50.584 --> 00:04:55.430\nyou're reliant on completely what you\nmight consider to be a third party.\n\n86\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.920\nThey may be somewhere in the same\norganization, but they're still going to\n\n87\n00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.500\nbe a third party because they're\ngonna be developing the hardware.\n\n88\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.100\nAnd that epic story, which is the\ncombination of both of those user stories,\n\n89\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.770\nthat epic story is not\ngoing to be complete, or\n\n90\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.960\nit's not gonna be considered done until\nthe functionality's been provided.\n\n91\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.540\nAnd the functionality consists\nof those two stories.\n\n92\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.210\nOkay, so we laid the ground work for\nthat, right?\n\n93\n00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.907\nWe've set our scene, now we're in\na position where we're working in one way\n\n94\n00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:32.414\nwe're working in to an agile methodology\nin our particular development environment.\n\n95\n00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:36.350\nBut the other division the one that\nis working on a hardware isn't.\n\n96\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.420\nThey are working to a traditional\nwaterfall approach.\n\n97\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.050\nBecause it was hard to manufacture then\n\n98\n00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.830\ngenerally you can't build\na laptop piece by piece, right?\n\n99\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.500\nYou gotta build the whole thing.\n\n100\n00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.140\nSo maybe it would make sense for them to\nactually work to a waterfall approach.\n\n101\n00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.280\nSo how do we integrate?\n\n102\n00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.555\nAnd no, that wasn't the question,\ndon't worry.\n\n103\n00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:58.400\n[LAUGH] Cuz that wasn't the big challenge.\n\n104\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.080\nBut there is no right or wrong way.\n\n105\n00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.050\nAnd you might say,\n\n106\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.550\nwell that took a long time to get to the\nfact that there's no right or wrong way.\n\n107\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.160\nWell we've gotta make sure that\nour interactions are still agile\n\n108\n00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.330\nbecause working with somebody that's\nnot on the same methodology as us,\n\n109\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.250\nwell that brings in risk.\n\n110\n00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.740\nIt certainly brings in complications,\nbut it's most definitely brings in risk.\n\n111\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.473\nSo we will, I was gonna say tackle,\nbut I don't like use the word tackle.\n\n112\n00:06:26.473 --> 00:06:27.056\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:06:27.056 --> 00:06:29.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It kinda sounds a bit severe.\n\n114\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.730\nBut we'll approach that risk in\nthe same way that we approach any risk.\n\n115\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.280\nAnd as part of our agile\nproject we do risk management.\n\n116\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.070\nAnd so we have to think\nabout the risks that we have\n\n117\n00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.030\nin dealing with that particular vendor.\n\n118\n00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.550\nAnd the risks that we have, or\nrather the constraints that we have.\n\n119\n00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.280\nTake a look along the bottom there.\n\n120\n00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.630\nWe've got a defined budget.\n\n121\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.380\nWe've got a schedule.\n\n122\n00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.805\nOr a schedule, as Cherokee might say.\n\n123\n00:06:55.805 --> 00:06:59.910\n[LAUGH] We've gotta be able\nto keep our end goal, right,\n\n124\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.980\nthat iteration, that epic story.\n\n125\n00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.990\nWe've gotta be able to keep that in mind.\n\n126\n00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.150\nBut we've also got, probably,\n\n127\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.090\ncontractual obligations as well\nwith that particular third-party.\n\n128\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.350\nAnd then we've got the risk of the,\nthese are all constraints, but\n\n129\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.350\nthese are all risks as well,\nthat we need to analyze.\n\n130\n00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.660\nBecause you see, it's really, really easy,\nif you're dealing with a third party,\n\n131\n00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.140\nit's really easy for\nthem to go over the budget.\n\n132\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.920\nIt's really easy for them to stretch\nout their schedule, or schedule.\n\n133\n00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.300\n[LAUGH] And it not have any effect, or\nit have a major effect on our project.\n\n134\n00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.280\nIt doesn't have any effect on their\nproject, but it will have a major effect\n\n135\n00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.980\nto on ours, and it will have\na major effect on that epic story.\n\n136\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.870\nSo we have to manage that risk.\n\n137\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.834\nManaging the risk that means\nidentifying the risk and\n\n138\n00:07:49.834 --> 00:07:53.633\nthen working out what we\ncan do with that risk.\n\n139\n00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:58.998\nAnd I'm but in this sort of real high\nlevel here working out what we can do and\n\n140\n00:07:58.998 --> 00:08:01.739\nthen decided what we're going to do.\n\n141\n00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:05.310\nBut what do you do if you don't\nhave any influence over that?\n\n142\n00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.360\nCan you just accept it?\n\n143\n00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.720\nOr are there other things that you can do?\n\n144\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.010\nWhat about one of the things that we do\nwith risk management, is share the risk.\n\n145\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.939\nLet's think about how we could\nhave applied that to our project,\n\n146\n00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:19.800\nactually really easy.\n\n147\n00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.360\nBecause we are responsible for\nthe software, but\n\n148\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.320\nthe only user story is being built by,\nwell, somebody else.\n\n149\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.780\nSo maybe instead of giving it to just\none vendor, maybe we give it two.\n\n150\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.580\nAnd maybe we say to Dell,\nokay, can you go away, and\n\n151\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.240\ndevelop the hardware that will do this?\n\n152\n00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.320\nAnd then, we might say to HP or\nto Apple, can you go away, and\n\n153\n00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.370\ndevelop hardware that can do this?\n\n154\n00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.460\nWhich means that we're\nactually sharing the risk.\n\n155\n00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.820\nWe have transferred, well,\nwe still own that risk,\n\n156\n00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.040\neven though the actual performing\nof these activities, well,\n\n157\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.230\nwe've transferred to somebody else,\nbut we've shared it.\n\n158\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.700\nAnd we've shared it across vendors.\n\n159\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.570\nWhat we have to do is make sure\nthat we manage our project within\n\n160\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.160\nour defined constraints.\n\n161\n00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.020\nAnd if we think that our vendors or our\nthird parties are going to influence that\n\n162\n00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:15.510\nbecause of the way that they work,\nthen we have got to manage that.\n\n163\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.220\nThey're our constraints, and\nthey're our deliverables.\n\n164\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.477\nSo we've gotta manage as best as we can.\n\n165\n00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:24.399\nA Waterfall approach to\na project is very likely, and\n\n166\n00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:29.279\nI'm not gonna say 100% of the time,\nbut it's really likely to\n\n167\n00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:33.744\nsuffer from Cherokee's favorite two words,\nscope creep.\n\n168\n00:09:33.744 --> 00:09:39.210\n[LAUGH] Right, it's really likely\nto go over in its schedule.\n\n169\n00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.022\nIt's really likely to go over in budget,\nand\n\n170\n00:09:42.022 --> 00:09:46.170\nthat $500 laptop that they promised you\nthat they were going to get to you,\n\n171\n00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.090\nis now been released, and\nit's going to cost $1,000 instead.\n\n172\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.930\nThat's going to effect\nour project severely.\n\n173\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:59.790\nSo we want to be able to,\nwell manage that risk as best we can.\n\n174\n00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.670\nSo we want to ensure that even though we\ndon't like, we like collaboration, and\n\n175\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.120\nwe value that over things like contracts,\n\n176\n00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.750\nwe still need to have some\ncontract publications in place.\n\n177\n00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.370\nWe are dealing with third parties.\n\n178\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.540\nAnd when you're dealing with a third\nparty, you should always have a contract.\n\n179\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.595\nEven though we want to\nemphasize collaboration,\n\n180\n00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:28.016\nyou don't go into partnership with\nsomebody without having some form of\n\n181\n00:10:28.016 --> 00:10:31.860\nagreement in place, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n182\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Well, I would think so.\n\n183\n00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.540\nIt would make common sense.\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever seen\n\n184\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.780\nJudge Judy?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n185\n00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.751\n&gt;&gt; If you don't have a contract.\n\n186\n00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:41.981\nThen it didn't happen,\naccording to her, so.\n\n187\n00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:42.566\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n188\n00:10:42.566 --> 00:10:45.040\n[LAUGH] That's one of my guilty pleasures.\n\n189\n00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.933\nYeah, yeah, she'll tell it as it is,\n\n190\n00:10:47.933 --> 00:10:48.696\nas well.\n&gt;&gt; She does.\n\n191\n00:10:48.696 --> 00:10:49.536\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] She should have been\n\n192\n00:10:49.536 --> 00:10:50.036\nborn British.\n\n193\n00:10:50.036 --> 00:10:52.900\nShe's an honorary Brit, all right,\nthat's what I'm going to say.\n\n194\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.590\nSo we're going to get into,\nI mean, take a look at it,\n\n195\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.480\nwe're talking about collaboration here,\nand that word's mentioned here as well.\n\n196\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.860\nWe've got to have that collaboration with\nour third party, and with our vendor.\n\n197\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.020\nRight at the very start of our project,\n\n198\n00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.040\nwe need to sit down with our third party,\nand with our vendor.\n\n199\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.760\nAnd the last bullet point there,\ntalks about educating them\n\n200\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.790\nin our project methodology, but\nit’s actually more important than that.\n\n201\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.870\nWhat we've got to do is,\nwe've gotta sit down with them, and\n\n202\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.330\nwe've gotta explain the way that we work,\nbut\n\n203\n00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.480\nthen they've have got to explain\nto us the way that they work.\n\n204\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.330\nWe've gotta come to some agreement.\n\n205\n00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:39.240\nIf we don't come to an agreement, we're\neither not going to achieve our goals at\n\n206\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.620\nall, that's one possibility, and\nwe're not going to meet that\n\n207\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:47.205\nparticular user story in terms of that\nhardware, so that's one possibility.\n\n208\n00:11:47.205 --> 00:11:50.665\nEither that, or we're going to have\na strange relationship, and it's gonna be\n\n209\n00:11:50.665 --> 00:11:55.635\na relationship that's a lot of toing and\nfroing, and a lot of fighting.\n\n210\n00:11:55.635 --> 00:11:57.935\nAnd sort of,\nyou promised this by this date,\n\n211\n00:11:57.935 --> 00:12:00.845\nyou didn't deliver it,\nthat's effected our budget.\n\n212\n00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:04.165\nAnd then, and then, you could put\nthings in like penalties, and\n\n213\n00:12:04.165 --> 00:12:05.865\nincentives into your contract.\n\n214\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.000\nAll of those,\nthose situations that I've just\n\n215\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.350\ndescribed there will actually destroy\ntrust rather than build trust up.\n\n216\n00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.910\nThey will destroy the collaborative\nnature of your development teams\n\n217\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.050\nrather than build that up.\n\n218\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:26.970\nSo this is why we value collaboration\nover contractual obligations,\n\n219\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:27.850\nyou put penalties, and\n\n220\n00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.760\nincentives in your contract, and then,\nyou start cracking the whip, as it were.\n\n221\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.620\nHow motivated do you think these people\nare to help you, and how likely are they\n\n222\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.085\nto try, and bend the rules slightly\njust to accommodate your requirements?\n\n223\n00:12:42.085 --> 00:12:43.240\nThey're more likely to try,\n\n224\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.240\nand do everything exactly\nas it says in the contract.\n\n225\n00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.870\nYou were gonna make a point there.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n226\n00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.430\nthe example that you were giving\njust sounded so real, so likely.\n\n227\n00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.490\nAnd you said I wasn't allowed to\nbore you with the technical details,\n\n228\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.029\nthough.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n229\n00:12:58.029 --> 00:12:59.030\n&gt;&gt; So I was like, I don't know if I\n\n230\n00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.590\nshould say anything.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n231\n00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:01.299\n&gt;&gt; Go on bore me,\n\n232\n00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:02.490\ngo on.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so,\n\n233\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.380\nwith the $500 laptop that we had asked\nfor, and you wanted biometric log on.\n\n234\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.570\nBut if you wanted to add that facial\nrecognition, and we see weird things,\n\n235\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.610\nlike if you're utilizing like a Microsoft\nupgrading system with something like\n\n236\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.698\nHello for Business.\n\n237\n00:13:16.698 --> 00:13:21.550\nThat facial recognition's only gonna work\nwith certain types of array cameras for\n\n238\n00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.380\nthat high definition.\n\n239\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.963\nSo that type of camera is gonna be more\nthan just your stock or average or\n\n240\n00:13:25.963 --> 00:13:29.027\nmaybe they didn't even have\na integrated camera on there.\n\n241\n00:13:29.027 --> 00:13:30.627\n&gt;&gt; Just things like that,\n\n242\n00:13:30.627 --> 00:13:35.110\nthese situations do happen,\nthat's all I'm trying to say here.\n\n243\n00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.960\n&gt;&gt; No, you're right.\n\n244\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.540\nBecause you see, one of the things\nwe explored in a previous episode,\n\n245\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.110\nwe've already explored change, and how\nwe bring change into our Agile project.\n\n246\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.950\nAnd the fact is, that user stories change,\n\n247\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.890\nuser requirements change,\nthey evolve over time.\n\n248\n00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.210\nThat's the whole reason why\nwe want to utilize an Agile\n\n249\n00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:58.050\nproject methodology is because\nthey evolve over time.\n\n250\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:02.479\nAnd so, it's perfectly feasible that what\nstarted off as a story that looked at\n\n251\n00:14:02.479 --> 00:14:05.588\nbiometrics, and\nlooked at fingerprint recognition,\n\n252\n00:14:05.588 --> 00:14:09.421\nthat could in a few months time,\nonce we've provided that perhaps,\n\n253\n00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:12.591\nthey could turn around and\nsay well do you know what,\n\n254\n00:14:12.591 --> 00:14:16.795\nmaybe we can skip the fingerprints,\nand let's go to facial recognition.\n\n255\n00:14:16.795 --> 00:14:21.206\nWhich is absolutely fine,\nit's okay for them to do that.\n\n256\n00:14:21.206 --> 00:14:23.904\nBut how,\nwhat was the word I'm going to use,\n\n257\n00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:28.105\nI was going to use the word pliable,\nbut that's kinda the wrong word.\n\n258\n00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:33.552\nHow understanding are your suppliers going\nto be, and your third parties going to be,\n\n259\n00:14:33.552 --> 00:14:38.810\nif you've got a contract that you\nare using to beat them over the head with?\n\n260\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.900\nIf you are using penalties, and\nincentives, and telling them you must\n\n261\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.600\ndeliver this particular piece of\nfunctionality by this time, and then,\n\n262\n00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.370\nall of a sudden you turn around,\nand say by the way, no forget that,\n\n263\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.930\nwe want to go with the facial recognition,\nright?\n\n264\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.950\nThey're kinda not gonna be understanding.\n\n265\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.150\nAre they gonna be willing\nto change their contract?\n\n266\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.180\nI don't think so.\n\n267\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.690\nAre they even gonna be willing\nto bend things slightly?\n\n268\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.791\nNo, probably not.\n\n269\n00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:08.880\nThey're gonna want to stick to\nthe letter of that contract.\n\n270\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.590\nThat doesn't make for\n\n271\n00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:15.320\na very good relationship, which is why\nright at the very start of any project,\n\n272\n00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.620\nyou have got to sit down, and build\na relationship with your third party,\n\n273\n00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.250\nwith your vendor, with your supplier,\nit has to be done.\n\n274\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.120\nYou have to explain to them\nthe way that you're working, and\n\n275\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.710\nyou have to listen to the way\nthat they're working as well.\n\n276\n00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.660\nAnd what you have to do is work out\nhow you're going to work together.\n\n277\n00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.790\n&gt;&gt; This is another side note here.\n\n278\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.678\nAnd I'm just thinking because another\nperfect example that Jo is using\n\n279\n00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:50.490\nwhen you're talking about hey, you're\nusing one methodology, I'm using another.\n\n280\n00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:56.060\nThis is such a real situation that if\nyou guys watched any of our other shows,\n\n281\n00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:01.806\nyou know that another subject area\nexpert we have, Dr. Terra Vanzant Stern,\n\n282\n00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:06.682\nshe Actually created a certification\nthat looks at the most core,\n\n283\n00:16:06.682 --> 00:16:09.382\nand common industry standards, and\n\n284\n00:16:09.382 --> 00:16:13.997\ngroups them together to help\nfacilitate these different silos\n\n285\n00:16:13.997 --> 00:16:19.010\nthat we have going on here.\n&gt;&gt; We have, in sort of,\n\n286\n00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.430\nfrom an AXELOS perspective,\nwe've looked at, for many years now,\n\n287\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:28.220\nwe've looked at project management,\nand ITIL, and management of risk.\n\n288\n00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.930\nAnd whilst they have always\nbeen separate certification,\n\n289\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.550\nwe've never tried to address\nthem completely separately,\n\n290\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:41.960\nbecause we've always acknowledged they all\nhave a part in our IT service provider.\n\n291\n00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.610\nAnd that they all have a part in\ntheir ability to deliver services.\n\n292\n00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.856\nAnd whether that be the development\nof a service, that service,\n\n293\n00:16:48.856 --> 00:16:53.120\nif you're developing it, you've got to\nbe able to manage risk on that service.\n\n294\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.240\nSo that brings in MOR, which is\nthe management of risk qualification,\n\n295\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.390\nand the certification, and study there.\n\n296\n00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.159\nAnd then, that brings in that\nmethodology into project management, or\n\n297\n00:17:05.159 --> 00:17:06.940\nPrince2, as AXELOS has.\n\n298\n00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:12.320\nAnd then, that brings Prince2 or project\nmanagement, then releases a product,\n\n299\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.300\nand transitions it into the operating\nenvironment, which is where we have ITIl.\n\n300\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.060\nAnd now we have DevOps that\nkind of helps with that bridge.\n\n301\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:25.400\nNone of these methodologies, none of these\nframeworks should be used in isolation.\n\n302\n00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.773\nWe should work more on our relationships,\nand it's true in IT.\n\n303\n00:17:29.773 --> 00:17:34.302\nI'll be honest with you, we should be\nbetter at relationship management,\n\n304\n00:17:34.302 --> 00:17:38.920\nwhether it's with the interfaces with\nour third parties, and our vendors.\n\n305\n00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:44.720\nWell, we kind of assume that a piece of\npaper's gonna solve that, and it's not.\n\n306\n00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.558\nOr whether it's between\nproject management, and\n\n307\n00:17:47.558 --> 00:17:49.210\nservice management or ITIl.\n\n308\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.206\nAnd we assume again, that we can\njust hand something over, here,\n\n309\n00:17:52.206 --> 00:17:54.970\nI've finished with it,\nI'm gonna give it to you.\n\n310\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.430\nBut what about, here,\nI've finished with it, do you like it?\n\n311\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.360\nCan you use it?\n\n312\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.990\nIs it okay for you?\n\n313\n00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.380\nLet me help you through the first few\nmonths, and let me make sure that\n\n314\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.880\neverything's working before I let\nthe guys out there help with support.\n\n315\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.260\nIt all makes common sense,\nit all makes perfect sense, and\n\n316\n00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.210\nI always say that these methodologies are\ncommon sense written down, and they are.\n\n317\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.772\nAnd this is another one of these where\nit's just common sense written down.\n\n318\n00:18:18.772 --> 00:18:20.412\nAnd I'll quite often,\n\n319\n00:18:20.412 --> 00:18:25.337\nwhen I'm teaching classes sort of\noutside in a physical environment,\n\n320\n00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:31.000\nI will say to people, sometimes we're\ngonna seem like we're just having a chat,\n\n321\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.536\nas we are now, and yet everything\nthat we do we could be tested on.\n\n322\n00:18:35.536 --> 00:18:40.940\nBut everything we talk about is so\nimportant in that working environment.\n\n323\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.220\nBecause if we don't address\nthese sort of issues,\n\n324\n00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.000\nthen you're not going to deliver\nany value to your business at all.\n\n325\n00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.510\nAnd the business will go,\nand find somebody who will.\n\n326\n00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:55.240\nSo whilst this might seem\nfairly unimportant, it's not.\n\n327\n00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:00.510\nA breakdown in the communication between\nus as a development organization,\n\n328\n00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.940\nand that third party, a breakdown,\n\n329\n00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.960\nthat there's an arrow there that talks\nabout trust, and cooperation as well.\n\n330\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.530\nThat breakdown in communication\nmeans that project will fail\n\n331\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.380\nbecause the iteration will fail.\n\n332\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.060\nWhich means, in this instance,\nthat the epic story will fail, and\n\n333\n00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.720\nif the epic story fails, then\n\n334\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.050\nthat's going to effect the entire project\ncuz the entire project was scaled up.\n\n335\n00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:28.259\nIt was to bring in biometrics for\na single sign on across the board.\n\n336\n00:19:28.259 --> 00:19:33.270\nWell, if we can't even get a thumbprint\nworking, then that's not going to happen.\n\n337\n00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:39.750\nWe do have some defined inconsistencies\nthat we know between Agile,\n\n338\n00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.250\nand the Waterfall approach.\n\n339\n00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.700\nAnd of course, there's an assumption that\n\n340\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.740\nour third parties are on\na Waterfall approach.\n\n341\n00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.010\nNot all of our third parties are, but\ncertainly when it comes to dealing with\n\n342\n00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:53.950\nhardware, I would say a lot of our\nhardware manufacturers are definitely on\n\n343\n00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:59.200\na Waterfall approach, just because of\nthe nature of the beast as it were.\n\n344\n00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.460\nSo you'll see that when it comes to\npeople, Agile have got fewer roles,\n\n345\n00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.960\nand shared responsibilities.\n\n346\n00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.980\nWhere a Waterfall approach,\nwe've got defined roles.\n\n347\n00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.990\nWe've got defined processes\nin a Waterfall approach, and\n\n348\n00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.640\nthey tend to take longer to get through.\n\n349\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.750\nWhereas, Agile processes\nare very efficient.\n\n350\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:26.080\nWe use process models to get us to the end\nresult as quickly as we possibly can.\n\n351\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.180\nThe product in a Waterfall approach,\n\n352\n00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.620\nI like the terminology of\nthe big reveal at the end.\n\n353\n00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.480\nSometimes it's not a big reveal.\n\n354\n00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.975\nSometimes it's quite scary.\n\n355\n00:20:34.975 --> 00:20:39.739\n[LAUGH] You're not gonna get that\nlevel of fear with an Agile approach\n\n356\n00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:43.530\nbecause your gonna release in increments.\n\n357\n00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.330\nBut when it comes to hardware,\nlet's face it, you don't see cell phone\n\n358\n00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.290\nmanufacturers, you don't see Apple\nreleasing in increments, right?\n\n359\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.770\nYou don't get this piece\nof the phone one day, and\n\n360\n00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.750\nanother piece the next day, right?\n\n361\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.560\nYou get the big reveal once a year.\n\n362\n00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.090\nAnd then, of course,\n\n363\n00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.830\nthe documentation in a Waterfall\napproach is incredibly comprehensive.\n\n364\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.753\nDocumentation in an Agile environment\nis just enough documentation.\n\n365\n00:21:08.753 --> 00:21:12.766\nAnd you might say well, that doesn't\nsort of meet all of the criteria, but\n\n366\n00:21:12.766 --> 00:21:13.475\nyes it does.\n\n367\n00:21:13.475 --> 00:21:14.980\nThat's why it's called just enough.\n\n368\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.970\nIf it didn't meet all of the criteria\nit would be called not enough.\n\n369\n00:21:20.062 --> 00:21:22.960\nI mean, what else can I say to that?\n\n370\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.220\nSo there are inconsistencies there.\n\n371\n00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:30.330\nAnd if you're working with a Waterfall\napproached supplier, or vendor, then\n\n372\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.050\nthey may be bringing you documentation\nthat you're going to have to wade through.\n\n373\n00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.250\nThat's not going to help\nwith your Agile project.\n\n374\n00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.910\nSo an example would be, simply got to, we\nbuild up the trust in the collaboration,\n\n375\n00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.400\nand we go to our vendor and\nwe say to them, your documentation,\n\n376\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.940\nit's absolutely fantastic, but\nI need something lightweight.\n\n377\n00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.590\nI need kinda the quick reference guide,\nthat's what I need.\n\n378\n00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.800\nSo can you give it to\nme in post card size?\n\n379\n00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.180\nCan you give me a quick reference guide,\nand that'd be perfect.\n\n380\n00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:05.103\nAnd yes, sure, I can reference all\nof that documentation if I need to.\n\n381\n00:22:05.103 --> 00:22:08.756\nBut for now I just need the quick\nreference guide or the handbook,\n\n382\n00:22:08.756 --> 00:22:10.560\njust the slimmed down version.\n\n383\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.660\nSo there can be compromise reached,\nwe can achieve collaboration.\n\n384\n00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.200\nYou've just gotta know what\nyou're looking for, that's all.\n\n385\n00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.460\nSimple as that.\n&gt;&gt; And knowing is half the battle,\n\n386\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:22.970\nisn't it, Jo?\n\n387\n00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.140\nBut what's the other half,\nhow do we tackle this?\n\n388\n00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.770\nYou've given us one example,\nhey, compromising,\n\n389\n00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:32.450\nbut any other suggestions here?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, in terms of suggestions,\n\n390\n00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.980\nmake sure that you plan for\nwhat you're actually going to do.\n\n391\n00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.230\nJust ignoring it, and\npretending that it's not going to happen,\n\n392\n00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.270\nand thinking to yourself,\nit's alright, we'll get on great.\n\n393\n00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.440\nInvariably doesn't happen.\n\n394\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.110\nIt's like when you're planning on\ngoing to that family function, and\n\n395\n00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.390\nyou think to yourself, it's all right,\neverybody's gonna get on great.\n\n396\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.721\nI'll just not say anything, and\nI'll just hide in the corner.\n\n397\n00:22:55.721 --> 00:22:56.657\n&gt;&gt; And we'll all get on really,\n\n398\n00:22:56.657 --> 00:22:57.630\nreally well, right?\n\n399\n00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.885\nWhen does it ever work out just like that,\nright?\n\n400\n00:22:59.885 --> 00:23:05.399\n[LAUGH] Yeah, it's just exactly\nthe same as that plan, right?\n\n401\n00:23:05.399 --> 00:23:09.761\nDon't bury your head in the sand, and\nthink that everything's gonna be okay.\n\n402\n00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:12.811\nThe use of penalties, and incentives,\n\n403\n00:23:12.811 --> 00:23:17.940\nI can't tell you not to do it\nbecause I know you're gonna do it.\n\n404\n00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.540\nAnd as much as I'd like to tell you,\ndon't use penalties, and incentives.\n\n405\n00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.160\nBecause if you frighten people, if you're\nusing sort of a big stick to beat people\n\n406\n00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.960\nup with, then you're not gonna\nget the best out of them.\n\n407\n00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.300\nSo be flexible.\n\n408\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.130\nFlexibility's really important.\n\n409\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:37.560\nFlexibility is something that we mentioned\nway back in one of the first episodes that\n\n410\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:42.910\nwe filmed in Agile, where we looked at\nsort of Agile being a flexible approach.\n\n411\n00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.500\nAnd we have to have a flexible\napproach to dealing with our vendors.\n\n412\n00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.380\nUnderstand, there's some\nthings that they can't change.\n\n413\n00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.871\nThey can’t change the fact that they’re\ngoing to release that laptop all in one\n\n414\n00:23:55.871 --> 00:23:56.522\ngo, right?\n\n415\n00:23:56.522 --> 00:23:59.807\nThey’re not gonna give you one bit, and\nthen, another bit, and then, another bit,\n\n416\n00:23:59.807 --> 00:24:01.337\nbecause that would be like a DIY laptop,\n\n417\n00:24:01.337 --> 00:24:01.972\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:24:01.972 --> 00:24:03.453\n&gt;&gt; That’s not going to happen.\n\n419\n00:24:03.453 --> 00:24:07.846\nSo understand that they can be\nflexible with some things, but\n\n420\n00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:10.860\nthen we have to reach that compromise.\n\n421\n00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.680\nAnd if you don't have\nthe relationship with them,\n\n422\n00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.240\nthen you're not gonna\nreach that compromise.\n\n423\n00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.470\nAnd then communicate with them.\n\n424\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.960\nSo set those expectations and understand\nwhere there are flexibilities, but\n\n425\n00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.780\nthen communicate with\nthem on a regular basis.\n\n426\n00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.925\nWe did an episode on\ncommunication planning, and\n\n427\n00:24:27.925 --> 00:24:30.830\nthat's really important,\nplan your communication.\n\n428\n00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.817\nAnd the minute you see something not\ngoing the way that you need it to go,\n\n429\n00:24:34.817 --> 00:24:39.580\nwhether it's on your side or\nwhether it's on their side, communicate.\n\n430\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.970\nTell them that something is not\nworking out the way it should.\n\n431\n00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.220\nAnd then work out a plan together,\nand all of these\n\n432\n00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.510\nactivities should be activities that\nare in your backlog, definitely so.\n\n433\n00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.370\nEverything that we do,\nI mean all of our communication plan and\n\n434\n00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:59.480\netc., there are activities\nthat we need to document.\n\n435\n00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.960\nBut more importantly, if they're defined,\n\n436\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.350\nthen you will undertake\nthem in a structured way.\n\n437\n00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:11.400\nAnd it will keep it on your radar as well,\nand then, of course,\n\n438\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.140\nbring our vendors into testing as well.\n\n439\n00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:19.430\nI mean, when we're testing the solution,\nwhen we're testing the epic story,\n\n440\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.580\nwe bring them into testing.\n\n441\n00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.500\nYou think that that's fairly obvious, but\n\n442\n00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.610\nwhat about when you're\ntesting the software?\n\n443\n00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.630\nBecause you've gotta have\nsomething to test the software on.\n\n444\n00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.290\nSo it's at that point in time, even if\nyou've finished your first user story, and\n\n445\n00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:38.380\nyou've got your software ready, you're\nnot gonna be able to test it until you've\n\n446\n00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:44.040\ngot at least a beta test of\nthat piece of hardware itself.\n\n447\n00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.200\nAnd so you've gotta work with your\nsupplier and your vendor, and\n\n448\n00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.870\nyou've gotta say, okay,\nI think I've got the software ready.\n\n449\n00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.246\nWhat have you got that I could test it on?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how are you doing?\n\n450\n00:25:53.246 --> 00:25:55.738\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, can I test it on something,\n\n451\n00:25:55.738 --> 00:25:56.318\nplease?\n\n452\n00:25:56.318 --> 00:25:58.898\nBecause then at least that\nway I know whether it's okay,\n\n453\n00:25:58.898 --> 00:26:01.240\nwhether I'm headed in the right direction.\n\n454\n00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.210\nOr whether, maybe,\nI need to adjust my user stories and\n\n455\n00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.270\nadd something else into the backlog.\n\n456\n00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.670\nWork with your vendor.\n\n457\n00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:10.820\nTreat your vendor and\n\n458\n00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:14.520\nyour supplier as just another\nmember of the development team.\n\n459\n00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.525\nIf you wanna invite them to stand ups,\nthen invite them to stand ups.\n\n460\n00:26:18.525 --> 00:26:22.470\nAnd they might not wanna come every time,\nbut you never know, invite them.\n\n461\n00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.500\nGive them an input into what\nit is that you´re doing.\n\n462\n00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.210\nObviously, be wary of security,\n\n463\n00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.320\nand there might be certain things that\nyou don't wanna discuss with them.\n\n464\n00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.560\nBut invite them,\nhave them in as part of your project.\n\n465\n00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.870\nUltimately, it's your relationship,\n\n466\n00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:40.600\nit's that way of working that we have,\nthat is collaborative.\n\n467\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.630\nIt's that relationship that will\ndetermine, especially in this instance,\n\n468\n00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.670\nwhether you're going to\nactually achieve dumbness.\n\n469\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.630\nYou're not, if you don't have that\nrelationship in place with your vendor.\n\n470\n00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:54.620\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, so much, Jo, for\n\n471\n00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.100\nyour time today, and thank you for\n\n472\n00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.890\nexplaining how we're gonna be\nintegrating with those third parties.\n\n473\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.740\nAnd thank you for your time as well, but\nwe're gonna go head and sign out for\n\n474\n00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.640\nthis show.\n\n475\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.200\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n476\n00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.692\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n477\n00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:13.459\n[MUSIC]\n\n478\n00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:16.780\nThank you for watching

00:00:11.944\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT ProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:15.605\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\nAgile Project Management Concepts series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:17.615\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:20.935\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at how we can actually be\n\n7\n00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:26.045\ndelivering the release, if I can say that,\ndeliver this information to you.\n\n8\n00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:30.475\nAnd of course, you know it, we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock back in studios with us today.\n\n9\n00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:31.615\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:33.225\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:33.805\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:36.090\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, thank you for asking.\n\n13\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.900\nSo we've been at this for quite a while.\n\n14\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.430\nWe've been talking about\ndifferent iterations, and concepts\n\n15\n00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.180\nthat are bringing us to this culmination,\nthis delivery so to speak, right?\n\n16\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know what you're thinking.\n\n17\n00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.590\nYou're thinking about that margarita.\n\n18\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.560\nYou know that initial\nproject vision that we have.\n\n19\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.730\nRight on one of our previous episodes,\nright?\n\n20\n00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.326\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; That's what she's thinking.\n\n21\n00:00:57.326 --> 00:01:00.610\nShe thinks I don't know this right.\n\n22\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.640\nBut yes we are,\nwe're on our penultimate episode.\n\n23\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.040\nWe are just about to finish\nwith our Agile concepts show.\n\n24\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.429\nAnd we are sort of just\ntying up the loose ends now,\n\n25\n00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.435\nready to deliver that project in its\nentirety, to complete the project,\n\n26\n00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:21.713\nto achieve doneness, as it were,\nand to prepare ourselves for\n\n27\n00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:26.400\nthe Agile foundation test,\nif that's what you want to do.\n\n28\n00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.370\nOf course, if your ambition has been just\nto gain a little bit more understanding\n\n29\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.370\nabout Agile, and Agile concepts,\nthen I hope that we have achieved that for\n\n30\n00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.010\nyou throughout our episodes.\n\n31\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.720\nAnd don't forget to download all of\nthe material that's available to you,\n\n32\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.200\nthat accompany all of\nour episodes as well.\n\n33\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.110\nSo as Cherokee's already said,\n\n34\n00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.850\nwe are going to be looking at\nplanning a release in its entirety.\n\n35\n00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.060\nSo, so far in all of our previous episodes\nwe started right the way at the beginning,\n\n36\n00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.920\nand we looked to the concepts of Agile.\n\n37\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.630\nWe looked at what Agile stand for,\nthe principles of Agile, and\n\n38\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.940\nalso, our values, and\nwe've looked at the pillars of Agile.\n\n39\n00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.800\nSo and the manifesto itself our values.\n\n40\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.320\nSo we looked at the iterative\napproach to a project through Agile.\n\n41\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.978\nAnd that's where we get this term\niterations that Cherokee just mentioned.\n\n42\n00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:23.060\nSo we release\n\n43\n00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.390\nin an iterative manner in the same way\nthat we develop in an iterative manner.\n\n44\n00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.310\nBut if you remember from\nour previous episodes,\n\n45\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.840\nwe can actually join many iterations\ntogether to form one release.\n\n46\n00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.880\n&gt;&gt; Epic release.\n\n47\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.150\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; Epic release.\n\n48\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.180\n&gt;&gt; An epic release, right.\n\n49\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.341\n&gt;&gt; I've been paying attention Jo.\n\n50\n00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:43.362\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was an epic story,\n\n51\n00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:46.342\nyou weren't paying that much attention,\nwere you?\n\n52\n00:02:46.342 --> 00:02:47.968\n&gt;&gt; Okay, half way there.\n\n53\n00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:49.578\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all right,\n\n54\n00:02:49.578 --> 00:02:51.150\nwe'll let her off this time.\n\n55\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.630\n[LAUGH] So yeah, what we're doing\nis we're going to, perhaps,\n\n56\n00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.550\njoin two or three iterations together,\nand then, release them as one release.\n\n57\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.050\nWe might release individual\niteration itself,\n\n58\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.230\nbut that's probably not the most\nefficient way of approaching this.\n\n59\n00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.080\nWhy do you think we wouldn't do that?\n\n60\n00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.930\n&gt;&gt; Why wouldn't we release\non a per iteration basis?\n\n61\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.540\nThat's a good question Jo.\n\n62\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.920\nFrom a software perspective because as you\nmentioned earlier in the previous show\n\n63\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.750\nabout hardware, you probably would want\nto have some kind of product unveiling.\n\n64\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.863\nBut from a software perspective,\nokay, I remember,\n\n65\n00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:41.760\nI think this is going to be not as a big\nof a disturbance to an environment.\n\n66\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly the reason why.\n\n67\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.930\nIt's not really about a disturbance to us.\n\n68\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.920\nIt's about delivering\nvalue to the customer, and\n\n69\n00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.220\nthat's what we want to achieve is\nto deliver value to the business.\n\n70\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.940\nIf you're being disturbed every\nsingle week, you know for\n\n71\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.550\na fact that you're gonna get really\nfed up with it really quick.\n\n72\n00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.110\nIt's gonna get old very, very quickly.\n\n73\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.690\nSo it's really about disturbance.\n\n74\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.590\nAnd we've talked about in previous\nepisodes about ensuring that the number of\n\n75\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.180\nincrements that we have or\n\n76\n00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.990\nrather the length of the increments\nthat we have is fairly consistent.\n\n77\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.240\nSo we don't want an increment of one week,\nand then,\n\n78\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.710\nan increment the last four weeks, and\nthen, an increment the last one week.\n\n79\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.450\nWe'd rather have sort of three episodes or\nthree, so\n\n80\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.510\nthree iterations of two weeks in length,\nfor instance.\n\n81\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.170\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, Jo.\n\n82\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.805\nI've been thinking about our episodes\nas little mini iterations here.\n\n83\n00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nthat's exactly what they are.\n\n84\n00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.320\nSo you might not want to do that.\n\n85\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.390\nBecause if you're releasing every two\nweeks, well, I don't know about you,\n\n86\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.390\nbut as a user I'm gonna\nget pretty fed up with it.\n\n87\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.750\nSo what we might want to do,\nand what would make sense,\n\n88\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.730\nis work out what our users really need,\nand we do that by prioritizing, and\n\n89\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.880\nwe do that right at the very\nstart of the project.\n\n90\n00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.440\nBut of course, we work out the detail\npriorities at the start of each increment,\n\n91\n00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.320\nbut we might want to work out\nwhat the priorities are in our\n\n92\n00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.170\nuser stories, and then,\nwe might want to bundle them together.\n\n93\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.130\nSo for instance,\n\n94\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.858\nin previous episodes we looked at\nthe dependencies between stories.\n\n95\n00:05:11.858 --> 00:05:17.260\nAnd we also looked at in previous episodes\nthe fact that we are implementing,\n\n96\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.230\ndidn't you know?\n\n97\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.580\nWe're actually implementing\nnew functionality.\n\n98\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.280\nWe're implementing the think\nprint recognition, aren't we?\n\n99\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.570\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so one depends on the other.\n\n100\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.520\nAnd the fact is that the software depends\nentirely on the hardware, but of course,\n\n101\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.040\nbeing able to demonstrate that\nthe hardware works also depends on\n\n102\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.600\nthe software too.\n\n103\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.200\nNow, they may be in different iterations,\nthey probably will be.\n\n104\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.880\nWe're probably going to get\nthe software finished before we have\n\n105\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.800\nthe hardware available to us.\n\n106\n00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.970\nSo if they're in different iterations,\nwe're going to bundle those iterations,\n\n107\n00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.210\nand release them together.\n\n108\n00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.170\nWe're certainly not going\nto release them separately,\n\n109\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.950\nwhat would be the point of that?\n\n110\n00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.120\nYou can't use it.\n\n111\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.950\nAnd then it goes against Agile principles\nof only delivering what you need, and\n\n112\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.220\nnot delivering additional\nfunctionality that you don't need.\n\n113\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.641\nSo you don't deliver\nsomething that can't be used.\n\n114\n00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:05.750\nThere's no sense in that.\n\n115\n00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.120\nSo we've got to make sure that\nwhen we plan our iterations,\n\n116\n00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.350\nwe also plan our releases as well.\n\n117\n00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.570\nSo we understand what we're going\nto release where, and when, and\n\n118\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.940\nwhat's it going to be\nincluded in that release.\n\n119\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.700\nSo what's included in that release?\n\n120\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.870\nOur iterations, and so, with each\nindividual iteration, the team and\n\n121\n00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.345\nthe product owner, the product owner\nbecause they're responsible for the?\n\n122\n00:06:32.345 --> 00:06:33.866\n&gt;&gt; Product.\n\n123\n00:06:33.866 --> 00:06:39.790\n&gt;&gt; Right, they're responsible for the\nfunctionality of the working product, yes.\n\n124\n00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.450\nSo the team, and the product owner will\nactually review the functionality that's\n\n125\n00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.990\nrequired to be delivered at\nthe end of that iteration.\n\n126\n00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.300\nAnd then, as it already says there,\nnot every iteration ends with a release.\n\n127\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.170\nAnd in fact,\nin this particular diagram here,\n\n128\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.470\nyou've got three iterations there or\nthree increments, and they're released.\n\n129\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.270\nThey're bundled together,\nand released together.\n\n130\n00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.850\nSo bearing in mind,\nwe're thinking about efficiency.\n\n131\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.235\nAnd I keep putting Cherokee on the spot,\nI know.\n\n132\n00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:11.833\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Keep in mind\n\n133\n00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:15.740\nthat we're thinking about efficiency here,\nwhen do you think we're going to test?\n\n134\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.880\n&gt;&gt; Prior to release.\n\n135\n00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's kind of just a catchall,\nisn't it?\n\n136\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.910\n&gt;&gt; Like more specifically?\n\n137\n00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n138\n00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.560\n&gt;&gt; Well shoot, since we're on such\na short timeline, I would say with\n\n139\n00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.810\nenough time to give yourself for rework.\n\n140\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.030\nBut we don't wanna be really doing that\nhere in our iterations cuz we have\n\n141\n00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.600\nthe option to fail.\n\n142\n00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.460\nSo in a small window there,\nI would assume.\n\n143\n00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.660\n&gt;&gt; I hope you've been paying attention.\n\n144\n00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.908\nThis is all I'm saying, I hope you've been\npaying attention to our previous episodes\n\n145\n00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:54.306\ncuz it's quite obvious\nthat somebody hasn't.\n\n146\n00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:56.887\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just going to leave that one there.\n\n147\n00:07:56.887 --> 00:07:59.360\nWe want to fail fast.\n\n148\n00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.591\nYep, failing fast, failing early means\nthat we can rectify any situation early,\n\n149\n00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:09.431\nwhich means that we actually\ntest each increment.\n\n150\n00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:12.093\n&gt;&gt; Right [CROSSTALK] before you can test,\nso-\n\n151\n00:08:12.093 --> 00:08:14.355\n&gt;&gt; We have to then test the iteration.\n\n152\n00:08:14.355 --> 00:08:16.088\nWe have to complete the iteration.\n\n153\n00:08:16.088 --> 00:08:18.670\nWe test that it's done-\n&gt;&gt; So basically,\n\n154\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.310\nas soon as possible\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n155\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.297\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna test as soon as possible\n\n156\n00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:23.900\nand we test each iteration.\n\n157\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.790\nNow if these iterations are codependent.\n\n158\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.650\nAnd we're talking about the functionality\nof fingerprint software and\n\n159\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:32.980\nfingerprint hardware.\n\n160\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.860\nThen we're gonna have to\ntest them both together.\n\n161\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.630\nYou can't just test one in isolation,\nright?\n\n162\n00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.220\nSo we have to test them both together.\n\n163\n00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:44.664\nSo yes in that instance we test the\nrelease but we test as soon as possible.\n\n164\n00:08:44.664 --> 00:08:49.060\nWe wanna fail fast rather\nthan wait until the very end.\n\n165\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.985\nIf you test at the very\nend you never know.\n\n166\n00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:53.942\nYou might have to go right the way\nback to the drawing board,\n\n167\n00:08:53.942 --> 00:08:58.160\nright the way back to the first iteration,\nin order to be able to rectify something.\n\n168\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.899\nWell just think of all that wasted time,\nor more importantly,\n\n169\n00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:01.940\nall that wasted money.\n\n170\n00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.480\nSo we wanna test the student\nas we possibly can.\n\n171\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.270\nNow when it comes to actually\nplanning the release.\n\n172\n00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.637\nI want you to think about your\nrelationships between your third parties\n\n173\n00:09:13.637 --> 00:09:19.470\nand relationships between, say, other\ndevelopment teams within the organization.\n\n174\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.170\nAnd I just really want you to,\n\n175\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.510\nwe've already covered this in a previous\nepisode where we looked at relationships.\n\n176\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.410\nAnd we covered this again right\nthe way back at the beginning\n\n177\n00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.920\nwhen we looked in our\nfirst couple of episodes.\n\n178\n00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.640\nAnd we looked at the difference\nbetween the Agile project and\n\n179\n00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.400\nthe Waterfall projects, project, even.\n\n180\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.820\nAnd so the Waterfall project,\nwell as you can see,\n\n181\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.590\nthey actually managed to plan their\nreleases to occur less frequently.\n\n182\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.300\nIn an Agile environment, we're actually\ndelivering product a lot more frequently.\n\n183\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.660\nAnd we both should be delivering value.\n\n184\n00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.680\nWe should both be doing\nthat most definitely.\n\n185\n00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.885\nHowever, the Waterfall approach\nfocuses on the entire solution,\n\n186\n00:10:01.885 --> 00:10:07.860\nwhereas the Agile approach focuses\non value for each iteration.\n\n187\n00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.330\nAnd it's the same with training.\n\n188\n00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.570\nIn an Agile environment we train for\neach iteration,\n\n189\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.545\nso we train for\nthat particular functionality.\n\n190\n00:10:15.545 --> 00:10:19.430\nWhereas in a Waterfall approach\nwe train for an entire solution.\n\n191\n00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.996\nI can tell you now the reason you're here,\n\n192\n00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:28.544\nwithout a shadow of a doubt,\nthe reason that you are here is because\n\n193\n00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:33.910\nyou want your training\ndelivered in bite-sized chunks.\n\n194\n00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.000\nYou want your training delivered\nin 30 minute chunks or\n\n195\n00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.160\nmaybe even a little bit less than that\nbecause it fits in with your schedule.\n\n196\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.030\nIt fits in with your career goals and it\nfits in with your personal life as well.\n\n197\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.880\nIf you think about this, what we're\ndoing is we're delivering training in\n\n198\n00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.860\nan Agile way,\naccording to an Agile methodology.\n\n199\n00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.300\nCherokee's already said\nshe considers this to be,\n\n200\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.850\nthis entire series, to be one big project.\n\n201\n00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.960\nAnd you could think of it like\nthat when delivering iterations.\n\n202\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.696\nA traditional training course may last,\nand\n\n203\n00:11:06.696 --> 00:11:11.304\ncertainly this particular training course,\nwhen delivered as a course and\n\n204\n00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:14.620\nnot a series of episodes,\nthat would last three days.\n\n205\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:21.790\nHow many people nowadays,\nwe've got so many calls on our time.\n\n206\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:27.300\nHow many people want to take three days\nout as a whole to attend a training class?\n\n207\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.767\nAnd so when you think about this,\nthe Agile approach to training,\n\n208\n00:11:32.767 --> 00:11:37.095\nwell that's the reason why you're here,\nbecause we know that it works.\n\n209\n00:11:37.095 --> 00:11:41.170\nNow, we're not disrespecting the\ntraditional approach to training either.\n\n210\n00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.355\nBecause the traditional approach to\ntraining also works in a Waterfall\n\n211\n00:11:45.355 --> 00:11:47.040\napproach.\n\n212\n00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.940\nBut there is a place for both.\n\n213\n00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.840\nSo yes, train by functionality,\ntrain by iteration.\n\n214\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.430\nAgile is all about the iteration and\n\n215\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:03.220\nit's all about the releasing of each\niteration or the bundles of iteration.\n\n216\n00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.390\nWhereas the Waterfall approach\ndoes things on a bigger scale.\n\n217\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.150\nAgile allows the capture of feedback\n\n218\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:15.340\nat much more of a granular detail\nthan the Waterfall approach does.\n\n219\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:20.330\nBecause the Waterfall approach, well,\nby the time you have released the entire\n\n220\n00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.970\nsolution to your audience and\nto your customer.\n\n221\n00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.860\nWell, you might come back with s\nsnagging list from the customer.\n\n222\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.690\nBut a lot of those small items,\n\n223\n00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.850\na lot of those small little\nniggly points might get lost.\n\n224\n00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.820\nSo just think, as far as we're in\nan Agile perspective right now.\n\n225\n00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.220\nWe're in an Agile methodology,\nso we love the Agile approach.\n\n226\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.520\nBut just remember, especially if you\nare coordinating your approaches\n\n227\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.170\nwith other teams who might be\nutilizing a Waterfall approach.\n\n228\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.180\nYou're gonna have to have some\ncollaboration in there somewhere.\n\n229\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.880\nSo let's look then at releasing\nthese iterations, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.030\nRelease iteration, well that's actually,\n\n231\n00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:13.110\nit's an iteration all on its own where\nwe actually perform the release.\n\n232\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.360\nThis is not a scrum concept.\n\n233\n00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.670\nThis is just an Agile concept as a whole.\n\n234\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.100\nRemember way back in one of our previous\nepisodes we looked at Iteration Zero.\n\n235\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.220\nCan you remember what\nhappen in Iteration Zero?\n\n236\n00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.070\n&gt;&gt; Planning.\n\n237\n00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.420\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\neven though it wasn't an iteration\n\n238\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.920\ntechnically because we\nweren't releasing anything.\n\n239\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.790\nWe still gave it a title of a iteration\nbecause we were doing some work,\n\n240\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.210\nso therefore it was a chunk of work.\n\n241\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.860\nSo we called in iteration.\n\n242\n00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.820\nWe might do exactly\nthe same with each release.\n\n243\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.950\nAnd we might actually plan each\nrelease as an iteration in itself.\n\n244\n00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.270\nSo we would say okay,\nwe've got iteration one, two, three and\n\n245\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.090\nthen release iteration.\n\n246\n00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:01.510\nAnd then iteration four, five,\nsix, and then a release iteration.\n\n247\n00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.330\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense because\nthings that I've released,\n\n248\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.900\nas far as technical deployments,\nthat in itself can be a task.\n\n249\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.618\nSo you wana provide and allow for that.\n\n250\n00:14:11.618 --> 00:14:14.990\n&gt;&gt; Well especially, considering\nthe mechanisms that we release, so\n\n251\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.596\nwe can release in a big bang way.\n\n252\n00:14:16.596 --> 00:14:20.456\nIf you release in a big bang way generally\nthings got virus protection you're going\n\n253\n00:14:20.456 --> 00:14:22.200\nto release in a big bang way.\n\n254\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.615\nYou're releasing to absolutely\neverybody all at the same time.\n\n255\n00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:32.399\nYou've got to allow yourself time to then\ndeal with any feedback that may come back.\n\n256\n00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:37.780\n,And to ensure that that release has,\nwell, bedded itself into the environment.\n\n257\n00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.160\nBut if you're releasing\nin say a phase manner.\n\n258\n00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.250\nSo you're releasing to maybe\none business unit at a time or\n\n259\n00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:50.680\none team at a time, then again you've\ngot to allow that release to take place.\n\n260\n00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.130\nAnd that release in itself could\ntake four weeks to take place.\n\n261\n00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:57.380\nSo it's an iteration in duration.\n\n262\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.360\nBut there is no actual\ndevelopment work that's done.\n\n263\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.905\nSo when it says no new\nfunctionalities delivered,\n\n264\n00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:04.830\nthere's no development work done.\n\n265\n00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.481\nIt's just that we're\ndoing a piece of work, so\n\n266\n00:15:07.481 --> 00:15:09.810\nwe consider it to be an iteration, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:14.940\nIt tells you to use it responsibly,\ndon't try and mix it up.\n\n268\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.130\nThat's what it meaning.\n\n269\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.280\nDon't try and confuse it.\n\n270\n00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.030\nIf you have a release iteration,\n\n271\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:25.270\nmake sure that all you're doing during\nthat iteration is just the release.\n\n272\n00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.020\nYou're not tweaking.\n\n273\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.160\nYou're not making any changes.\n\n274\n00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.970\nIt could potentially cause damage and\n\n275\n00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.110\ninterfere with what we've\ndone in previous iterations.\n\n276\n00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.370\nThat's not what your doing.\n\n277\n00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:47.437\nIf something goes wrong during\nthe release, what do we do?\n\n278\n00:15:47.437 --> 00:15:50.250\nI know we've spoken about\nthis in a previous episode.\n\n279\n00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.050\nWhat do we do if something goes wrong?\n\n280\n00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.790\n&gt;&gt; We accept it.\n\n281\n00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.480\nWe fail fast, then we move on.\n\n282\n00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.580\nOkay, but that's not quite\ntechnically saying what we do.\n\n283\n00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.231\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n284\n00:16:02.231 --> 00:16:05.319\n&gt;&gt; What we do is, I mean,\nCherokee's right.\n\n285\n00:16:05.319 --> 00:16:07.420\nThere's nothing wrong in what she said.\n\n286\n00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.342\nI like what she said about accept it.\n\n287\n00:16:09.342 --> 00:16:15.350\nIf something goes wrong we accept it,\nand that then becomes a new user story.\n\n288\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.646\nRemember, it goes into the backlog.\n\n289\n00:16:16.646 --> 00:16:18.309\n&gt;&gt; Backlog, got it.\n\n290\n00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:19.463\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n291\n00:16:19.463 --> 00:16:24.501\nwhat we'll do is then that\nbecomes a new challenge.\n\n292\n00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:26.320\nIt goes on to the backlog and\n\n293\n00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.366\nthen that might be factored\ninto the next iteration, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:30.366 --> 00:16:34.226\nSo yes, you accept it, and\nwe do want to fail first.\n\n295\n00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:37.781\nBut a release is all about\ngetting functionality out there.\n\n296\n00:16:37.781 --> 00:16:41.844\nAnd if that functionality then doesn't\nwork, if we've got a challenge,\n\n297\n00:16:41.844 --> 00:16:43.789\nthen it goes back into the backlog.\n\n298\n00:16:43.789 --> 00:16:45.582\nWe don't try and amend that release.\n\n299\n00:16:45.582 --> 00:16:49.361\nOtherwise, that release could\npotentially not just last two weeks,\n\n300\n00:16:49.361 --> 00:16:51.612\nit could last seven weeks, eight weeks.\n\n301\n00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:52.534\nYou waved at me.\n\n302\n00:16:52.534 --> 00:16:57.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a question because I\ntalked to you about having projects and\n\n303\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.836\ndeploying them in the past.\n\n304\n00:16:58.836 --> 00:17:04.497\nSo training, that's almost always\na big portion of this release,\n\n305\n00:17:04.497 --> 00:17:06.993\nand how does that fit in here?\n\n306\n00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:12.367\nSo is that going to be probably a prior\niteration prior to that actual release?\n\n307\n00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:16.199\nBecause you are saying, hey, look,\nwe need to just reserve this iteration,\n\n308\n00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:18.653\nthe release iteration,\nfor the release itself.\n\n309\n00:17:18.653 --> 00:17:20.152\nIs that including training?\n\n310\n00:17:20.152 --> 00:17:23.935\n&gt;&gt; Right, well you're saying that, I mean,\nthe question that you asked was about,\n\n311\n00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:25.840\ndo we do the training before the release?\n\n312\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.907\nWell, if we did that, I mean,\nwhat happens before the release?\n\n313\n00:17:28.907 --> 00:17:32.713\nThe development, so\ntraining is actually part of the release.\n\n314\n00:17:32.713 --> 00:17:34.635\nTraining is a release activity.\n\n315\n00:17:34.635 --> 00:17:37.402\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And release management,\n\n316\n00:17:37.402 --> 00:17:42.187\nas it were as process,\nowns the training activities.\n\n317\n00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:46.837\nSo training has to be part of the release,\nwhich is why we'd recommend,\n\n318\n00:17:46.837 --> 00:17:50.117\neven though it doesn't\nactually appear in Scrum,\n\n319\n00:17:50.117 --> 00:17:54.715\nwe would recommend that you treat\nthe release as a separate iteration.\n\n320\n00:17:54.715 --> 00:17:58.451\nBecause there are activities that\nhave to happen during that iteration.\n\n321\n00:17:58.451 --> 00:18:01.405\nIt's not just a case of saying,\nhere's some software, go on.\n\n322\n00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:04.154\n&gt;&gt; Have fun with this.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah, right, go on have fun.\n\n323\n00:18:04.154 --> 00:18:07.013\nBut I know that we do that with our cell\nphones cuz we both agreed that not one of\n\n324\n00:18:07.013 --> 00:18:07.828\nus reads the manual.\n\n325\n00:18:07.828 --> 00:18:09.402\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n326\n00:18:09.402 --> 00:18:10.048\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n327\n00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:12.289\nbut that's not what\na release should be about.\n\n328\n00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:16.594\nA release should be about deployment and\ntraining as well.\n\n329\n00:18:16.594 --> 00:18:19.572\nAnd also with the release,\ndon't forget we have the DevOps or\n\n330\n00:18:19.572 --> 00:18:23.427\nthe early-life support where we have\ngot that little bedding-in period too.\n\n331\n00:18:23.427 --> 00:18:27.776\nSo this is why we wanna treat\na release as a separate iteration.\n\n332\n00:18:27.776 --> 00:18:32.038\nBecause if we've got say three or\nfour iterations in that release,\n\n333\n00:18:32.038 --> 00:18:37.224\nsomebody somewhere is gonna need training\nin something no matter how small it is.\n\n334\n00:18:37.224 --> 00:18:40.312\nAnd it may just be say service\npacks that you're updating or\n\n335\n00:18:40.312 --> 00:18:44.329\nit may be security patches that you're\nrolling out, but somebody somewhere\n\n336\n00:18:44.329 --> 00:18:48.190\nneeds to know about these even if it\njust means reading the release notes.\n\n337\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.352\nThey've gotta take the time to do it.\n\n338\n00:18:50.352 --> 00:18:54.660\nAnd that reminds me, I've just mentioned\nthey're reading the release notes,\n\n339\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.508\nsomeone's gotta write them too.\n\n340\n00:18:56.508 --> 00:19:02.293\nSo all of that should take place in\nthat release iteration because that's a,\n\n341\n00:19:02.293 --> 00:19:04.436\nremember the term time box?\n\n342\n00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:09.619\nYeah, it's a time boxed, well,\nnumber of hours that we set aside\n\n343\n00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:15.190\njust to do release activities,\nwhich is why we think it's a good idea.\n\n344\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.967\nIt just makes sense to do that,\nto treat it separately.\n\n345\n00:19:17.967 --> 00:19:20.154\nSo what we're doing is\njust release activities.\n\n346\n00:19:20.154 --> 00:19:23.403\nWe're not actually doing any\nprogramming and any development work.\n\n347\n00:19:23.403 --> 00:19:26.624\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're compiling release notes.\n\n348\n00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.064\nWe are doing any training.\n\n349\n00:19:28.064 --> 00:19:31.671\nAnd we're doing the actual\ndeployment itself as well.\n\n350\n00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:36.056\nAnd now I've already mentioned defects,\nsomething that's gone wrong.\n\n351\n00:19:36.056 --> 00:19:40.212\nIt doesn't meet its requirement,\nshould we say?\n\n352\n00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:41.616\nSo then what do we with it?\n\n353\n00:19:41.616 --> 00:19:45.832\nWell as it says, we capture it as a story\nand then it goes into the backlog,\n\n354\n00:19:45.832 --> 00:19:49.711\nand it's prioritized with all of\nthe other stories in the backlog.\n\n355\n00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:54.918\nNow one thing I do want to mention on this\nthough is because at the end of every,\n\n356\n00:19:54.918 --> 00:19:58.540\ndo you remember when we were\nlooking at our burn down?\n\n357\n00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.415\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yep.\n\n358\n00:19:59.415 --> 00:20:01.823\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nwe were looking at the burn up as well.\n\n359\n00:20:01.823 --> 00:20:04.262\nAnd we we're looking at how\nmany stories we had and\n\n360\n00:20:04.262 --> 00:20:07.756\nthroughout the life of a project\nsometimes the number of stories grow.\n\n361\n00:20:07.756 --> 00:20:08.338\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n362\n00:20:08.338 --> 00:20:11.476\n&gt;&gt; This is why, and\nit's not just about changes.\n\n363\n00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:13.848\nIt's not just about customers\ncoming to us and said, hey,\n\n364\n00:20:13.848 --> 00:20:15.610\nlook, can I have some more functionality?\n\n365\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.968\nIt's also because of this.\n\n366\n00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:21.659\nIf something doesn't work,\nthen we create a backlog story.\n\n367\n00:20:21.659 --> 00:20:25.374\nAnd we add it till we create a defect\nstory and we add it to the backlog.\n\n368\n00:20:25.374 --> 00:20:29.099\nBut then we've gotta go away and\nreprioritize everything else.\n\n369\n00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:32.705\nBecause the full stories that we'd\nplan for that next release all of\n\n370\n00:20:32.705 --> 00:20:36.765\na sudden we can't do cuz we've got this\ndefect that we've got to deal with.\n\n371\n00:20:36.765 --> 00:20:42.217\n&gt;&gt; Right and then in different projects,\nI was gonna say different environments or\n\n372\n00:20:42.217 --> 00:20:45.755\nfields, defects there\nare different allowances.\n\n373\n00:20:45.755 --> 00:20:49.238\nBut even within individual projects\nthere are different allowances.\n\n374\n00:20:49.238 --> 00:20:52.804\nLike talk about the difference\nbetween a hair cut and\n\n375\n00:20:52.804 --> 00:20:57.515\nhaving a defect versus having some\nkind surgery and having a defect.\n\n376\n00:20:57.515 --> 00:21:00.367\nSo it's gonna be different for each one.\n\n377\n00:21:00.367 --> 00:21:02.134\n&gt;&gt; We base it on impact.\n\n378\n00:21:02.134 --> 00:21:03.930\n&gt;&gt; The priority's gotta\nbe based on impact.\n\n379\n00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.118\nAnd what you just said there about having\na bad haircut versus having bad surgery,\n\n380\n00:21:08.118 --> 00:21:09.646\nI mean, think of the impact.\n\n381\n00:21:09.646 --> 00:21:12.337\nHaving bad surgery,\nwe need that fixed in right now.\n\n382\n00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:15.559\nIf you have a bad haircut, quite often\nyou just gotta sort of look at it.\n\n383\n00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:16.081\n&gt;&gt; Deal with it.\n\n384\n00:21:16.081 --> 00:21:16.596\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look at it.\n\n385\n00:21:16.596 --> 00:21:18.259\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, look at himself for\n\n386\n00:21:18.259 --> 00:21:20.416\na few weeks and go, no,\ndid that really happen?\n\n387\n00:21:20.416 --> 00:21:23.215\nBut at the end of the day,\nit's not life-threatening,\n\n388\n00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:25.792\nwhereas a defect in surgery\nis life-threatening.\n\n389\n00:21:25.792 --> 00:21:29.719\nIf somebody makes a mistake there,\nyeah, that's an issue, all right?\n\n390\n00:21:29.719 --> 00:21:30.694\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yes,\n\n391\n00:21:30.694 --> 00:21:35.269\nyour defects, we'll prioritize them in\nthe same way that we prioritize all of our\n\n392\n00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:39.465\nother stories because our defects,\nquite simply, need to be dealt with.\n\n393\n00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:42.507\nYou can't just sort of brush\nthem under the carpet and\n\n394\n00:21:42.507 --> 00:21:45.288\nhope that they never get\nseen because they will.\n\n395\n00:21:45.288 --> 00:21:47.366\nSo we have to be honest about them.\n\n396\n00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:48.578\nWe have to document them.\n\n397\n00:21:48.578 --> 00:21:52.800\nAnd then we deal with them in the same way\nthat we deal with all of the other stories\n\n398\n00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.149\nthat we have, our customer requirements.\n\n399\n00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:58.631\nBut what we have to understand is that,\nas we get a defect,\n\n400\n00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:03.056\nthen that will mean prioritizing or\nreprioritizing other user stories.\n\n401\n00:22:03.056 --> 00:22:07.035\nAnd I'm not even gonna say that may\nmean reprioritizing other stories.\n\n402\n00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:10.313\nIt's not a may,\nwe will have to do that task.\n\n403\n00:22:10.313 --> 00:22:13.913\nSo when we highlight a defect,\nit has to be documented,\n\n404\n00:22:13.913 --> 00:22:18.293\nand then we have to go back and\nrevisit all of our priorities, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:18.293 --> 00:22:21.502\nSo as far as our agile\nproject is concerned,\n\n406\n00:22:21.502 --> 00:22:24.817\nwe're pretty much at\nthe end of our project.\n\n407\n00:22:24.817 --> 00:22:27.119\nNow we are planning our release.\n\n408\n00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:32.084\nAnd we're ready to release all of our\nsoftware, or release the iterations that\n\n409\n00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:36.767\nwe've decided we're going to release\nin this particular moment in time.\n\n410\n00:22:36.767 --> 00:22:40.512\nWhat's next really is just for\nus to close out our project.\n\n411\n00:22:40.512 --> 00:22:43.118\nAnd that we're gonna look\nat in the next episode.\n\n412\n00:22:43.118 --> 00:22:45.800\nRight, Jo, what was the word that you\nused at the beginning of this show?\n\n413\n00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.310\nIt's definitely a British thing\nbecause our British mate from across\n\n414\n00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:54.140\nthe pond there, Pete,\nsaid it also, not paramount, no?\n\n415\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:54.886\n&gt;&gt; Penultimate.\n\n416\n00:22:54.886 --> 00:22:56.793\n&gt;&gt; Penultimate, I like that.\n\n417\n00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:57.366\nThat's a good word.\n\n418\n00:22:57.366 --> 00:22:58.463\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It means the one before last.\n\n419\n00:22:58.463 --> 00:22:59.148\n&gt;&gt; The one before the last.\n\n420\n00:22:59.148 --> 00:23:00.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n421\n00:23:00.166 --> 00:23:00.981\n&gt;&gt; I knew the definition, but\n\n422\n00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:02.334\nI just couldn't remember\nwhat the term was.\n\n423\n00:23:02.334 --> 00:23:04.432\nSo yes, thank you for that, Jo.\n\n424\n00:23:04.432 --> 00:23:05.506\nEverything has been great so far.\n\n425\n00:23:05.506 --> 00:23:07.185\nAnd I look forward to our last show and\n\n426\n00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:09.469\nnot just because we're\ngonna get rid of you, Jo.\n\n427\n00:23:09.469 --> 00:23:10.432\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm looking\n\n428\n00:23:10.432 --> 00:23:13.976\nforward to some more great information\nthat you're ready to bring.\n\n429\n00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:16.511\nHopefully, you'll be able to stay with us,\nand we can go ahead and\n\n430\n00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:17.522\nsign out of this show now.\n\n431\n00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:18.954\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n432\n00:23:18.954 --> 00:23:19.983\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n433\n00:23:19.983 --> 00:23:22.658\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n434\n00:23:22.658 -->

and\n\n8\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.720\nclose out a project.\n\n9\n00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.100\nAnd of course with us today in\nstudios we have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.660\nThank you so much for\njoining us today, Jo.\n\n11\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.890\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.920\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n13\n00:00:29.920

00:00:37.228\nSometimes, but\nI'm not telling you about that.\n\n17\n00:00:37.228 --> 00:00:39.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But speaking-\n\n18\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.400\n&gt;&gt; No, of course I don't.\n\n19\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.572\nThat is absolutely nominal.\n\n20\n00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:43.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n21\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.230\nI'm just messing with you.\n\n22\n00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.120\nAnd speaking of closing out\nwe're getting close to a project\n\n23\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.550\nclose out ourselves, correct?\n\n24\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.540\n&gt;&gt; Were we speaking of closing out.\n\n25\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.340\n&gt;&gt; I was.\n\n26\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay then, fair enough [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.350\n&gt;&gt; Then yeah, we are.\n\n28\n00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.750\nIn this episode we are actually looking\nat all of our close out activities\n\n29\n00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.840\nbecause in all of our previous episodes.\n\n30\n00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.420\nWe have looked at the startup\nof an Agile project.\n\n31\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.860\nWe've looked at the delivery\nof our iterations and\n\n32\n00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.944\nthe delivery of our releases.\n\n33\n00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:14.183\nWe've looked at what to do\nwhen there are defects,\n\n34\n00:01:14.183 --> 00:01:17.735\nhow to work with people that aren't quite\nworking on the same methodology as us.\n\n35\n00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:19.090\nAnd now, guess what?\n\n36\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.720\nWe've delivered everything.\n\n37\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.730\nWhich if I remember rightly,\naccording to one of our previous episodes,\n\n38\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.520\nthat means that you just about to get\na margarita in your hand, is that right?\n\n39\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.740\n&gt;&gt; I think I earned that, right?\n\n40\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.780\n&gt;&gt; What, for working with me,\nis that what you're saying?\n\n41\n00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.270\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I have a confession, Jo.\n\n42\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.472\nI don't even drink,\nI don't even drink margaritas.\n\n43\n00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:40.770\n&gt;&gt; You don't drink margaritas.\n\n44\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.490\nWell, I've got a confession too,\nI don't like them either.\n\n45\n00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.150\n&gt;&gt; I'll take the beach part though still,\nif you're still good with that.\n\n46\n00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay we can head to beach.\n\n47\n00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good, yeah,\n\n48\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.570\nas long as it's not raining out there,\nwe can head to the beach.\n\n49\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.332\nEven if it's raining as long as it's\na decent temperature we're okay.\n\n50\n00:01:58.332 --> 00:01:58.969\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n51\n00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah let's wrap\nthis project up then shall we?\n\n52\n00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.450\nDon't forget though this\nisn't our final episode.\n\n53\n00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.650\nWhat you do have after this episode is\nyou do have the opportunity to review\n\n54\n00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.320\nour additional materials.\n\n55\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.520\nThe supplementary information\nthat you can download.\n\n56\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.760\nAnd also take the sample test paper,\nwhich will give you preparation for\n\n57\n00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.790\nyour VCS Agile Foundation certification.\n\n58\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.380\nSo let's take a look then at what\nwe do at the end of our project.\n\n59\n00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.767\nWell, you can't just kind of tick\na box and then just walk away, right?\n\n60\n00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:39.740\nNow different to our waterfall project,\nthis is where we release.\n\n61\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.880\nWe release,\nwe check that everything is working okay,\n\n62\n00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.800\nwe have that early life support period\nwhere we do the hand holding with our\n\n63\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.540\nsupport teams, and\nthen we kind of walk away.\n\n64\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.530\nWell, here, we don't really do that,\n\n65\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.520\nbecause you see,\nwe've already done the releases.\n\n66\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.380\nWe've been doing those\nreleases iteratively.\n\n67\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.970\nAnd even though we don't really say\nevery time we have an iteration,\n\n68\n00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.150\nevery time we complete an iteration,\nwe still do iterative releases.\n\n69\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.845\nSo it's slightly different to\nthe waterfall approach, but,\n\n70\n00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:18.027\nand here where the similarities start,\nis we've still got to be able to\n\n71\n00:03:18.027 --> 00:03:22.439\ndemonstrate that we have achieved what\nwe have supposed to have achieved.\n\n72\n00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.230\nAnd that we have also\nachieved value delivery.\n\n73\n00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.166\nValue delivery's quite often\nexpressed in customer terms.\n\n74\n00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:33.300\nWell, that is, money, yeah?\n\n75\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.720\nIt's a return on investment.\n\n76\n00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.720\nNow we know that returns on\ninvestment are not always financial.\n\n77\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.450\nAnd so\nyou could also have statements for VOI,\n\n78\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.910\nas well as ROI,\nVOI meaning a value on investment return.\n\n79\n00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.520\nWhen a value on investment return is\na return that is not financially related.\n\n80\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.930\nSo it could be adherence to regulations,\nfor instance.\n\n81\n00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.950\nThat would be a value return.\n\n82\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.850\nOr maybe just getting to market first,\nthat would be a value return as well.\n\n83\n00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.280\n&gt;&gt; Would time fall into that category?\n\n84\n00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.330\nIf I were investing time\ninto this training series?\n\n85\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.830\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah,\nthat would be a value return.\n\n86\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.890\nLet’s think about it if you were investing\ntime into this particular series\n\n87\n00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.530\nthen you might achieve an accreditation.\n\n88\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.790\nHopefully you will.\n\n89\n00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.510\nBut you will definitely have achieved new\nknowledge, new skills, which hopefully\n\n90\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.100\nwill then translate into you being more\nproductive in your work environment.\n\n91\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.990\nBut also you being more salable, and\nyou having more skills on your resume.\n\n92\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.860\nNow hopefully eventually\nthe value on investment\n\n93\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.000\nwill also deliver a financial\nreturn on that investment.\n\n94\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.212\n&gt;&gt; You know, that's the goal, Jo.\n\n95\n00:04:43.212 --> 00:04:46.902\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Cuz you need\nto get a raise out of it.\n\n96\n00:04:46.902 --> 00:04:48.690\nBut no, that wasn't a guarantee.\n\n97\n00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.130\nOkay, don't take that the wrong way.\n\n98\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.140\nNobody's getting raise today.\n\n99\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.410\nBut you know if you build\nup your skills then\n\n100\n00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.360\nthere's a really good chance that\nyou will become more marketable and\n\n101\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.490\ntherefore you will become more\nvaluable to your organization.\n\n102\n00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.510\nAnd yeah you might actually get\nsomething out of it in financial terms.\n\n103\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.110\nEverything that we do is to improve.\n\n104\n00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.480\nAnd so even when we take a training class,\nor when we're delivering a new project,\n\n105\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.040\nwe're delivering new features,\nwe do it to improve.\n\n106\n00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.060\nBut we have to be able to\ndemonstrate that improvement.\n\n107\n00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.580\nWe have to demonstrate that we have\nachieved what we set out to achieve.\n\n108\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.980\nAnd so in Agile terms, what that means is,\n\n109\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.419\nwe've got to verify that we\nhave met all of our stories,\n\n110\n00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.912\nwe've delivered our stories, and\nwe satisfied our done criteria.\n\n111\n00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:43.340\nDo you remember what MosCoW stood for?\n\n112\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.980\n&gt;&gt; Must haves, should haves, could haves,\nlook, I'm missing a few in there,\n\n113\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.935\nbut along those lines-\n&gt;&gt; There's only so many letters, right?\n\n114\n00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Must have,\n\n115\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.500\nthat's our must have features.\n\n116\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.000\nShould have, what it should have,\nbut we won't cry if it doesn't.\n\n117\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.180\nWhat it could have, which is kind of like,\n\n118\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.480\nhow nice to have them,\nwe're okay with that.\n\n119\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.880\nAnd then won't have right now or\nwould like in the future.\n\n120\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.160\nI've seen it written both ways and\nthey both mean pretty much the same thing.\n\n121\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.970\nNow, let's think about lean principles.\n\n122\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.000\nSo there's a danger.\n\n123\n00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.929\nAnd the danger is that when\nwe are first establishing our\n\n124\n00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:37.950\nMosCoW list then we categorize trying to\ncategorize everything as a must have.\n\n125\n00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.420\nBecause you see, as far as a lean is\nconcerned, we only deliver what's needed.\n\n126\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.200\nWe don't deliver excess functionality.\n\n127\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.110\nSo as far as lean is concerned, you might\neven think to yourself, well, that means\n\n128\n00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.240\nwe exclude the should-haves and the\ncould-haves, and the won't-have right now.\n\n129\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.240\nAnd so because people think like that,\nand because people will\n\n130\n00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.650\nautomatically think that this is\nwhat happens in an Agile project.\n\n131\n00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:12.320\nThen all of the wants, they then tend to\ncategorize that [CROSSTALK] must haves.\n\n132\n00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.063\nRight.\n\n133\n00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:18.424\nSo we've got to be really careful, and\nthat's something that when it comes\n\n134\n00:07:18.424 --> 00:07:23.410\nto quantifying whether we're done,\nand quantifying the doneness.\n\n135\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.250\nObviously, right at\nthe start of the project.\n\n136\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.350\nRight at the start of the project,\nnot at the start of each iteration, but\n\n137\n00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.640\nright at the start of the project,\nwe verified our problem statements, and\n\n138\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.320\nwe also looked at our user stories,\nsure, we added on to those user stories.\n\n139\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.390\nAnd possibly because of defects as well.\n\n140\n00:07:41.832 --> 00:07:45.290\nBut nevertheless, we've got to be\nreally careful in our categorization.\n\n141\n00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.000\nAnd we have got to be realistic.\n\n142\n00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.740\nAnd what you see left in that backlog\nsection there on that particular screen.\n\n143\n00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.524\nThey could be those items\nthat have fallen into our,\n\n144\n00:07:58.524 --> 00:08:03.170\nyou should could haves or\nshould haves or want to have right now.\n\n145\n00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.719\nBut you've got to decide,\nat the end of a project,\n\n146\n00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:08.700\nwhat you're going to do with\nanything that's remaining.\n\n147\n00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.390\nI guarantee that there will be\nstories that are remaining.\n\n148\n00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.580\nThere will be stories that\nhaven't quite finished.\n\n149\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.250\nSo what do you do about it?\n\n150\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.630\nYou haven't delivered those stories.\n\n151\n00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.760\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n152\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.310\nAnd it all comes down to\nthe correct categorization.\n\n153\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.590\nAnd you've got to remember right at\nthe beginning that not everything\n\n154\n00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.290\nis a must have.\n\n155\n00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.770\nSome things we can transfer to operations,\nespecially if there\n\n156\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.990\nare things like technical issues\nthat just need addressing.\n\n157\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.510\nMaybe we'll hand those off to operations.\n\n158\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.405\nBut by the way, we're not just\ngonna throw them over the fence.\n\n159\n00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:45.740\nWe don't just turn to our operations and\nsay, all right, that's it,\n\n160\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.500\nthen we're done with that,\nthat's it, over to you.\n\n161\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.910\nNo, no,\nthat's never gonna be best practice.\n\n162\n00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.380\nWe have to make a decision, and\n\n163\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.450\nit has to be a decision in line\nwith what the customer values.\n\n164\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.930\nAnd sometimes, we might not actually\nsign off on our project, or\n\n165\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.310\nclose out of our project until we've\ndelivered yet another iteration.\n\n166\n00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.720\nBut some of these stories, we might not\nactually be able to deliver on anyway,\n\n167\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.390\nbecause think about our dependencies and\nour third-party providers.\n\n168\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.829\nWe might be completely dependent on them,\nand\n\n169\n00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:19.215\nwe might not be able to\ndeliver on that story.\n\n170\n00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:23.030\n&gt;&gt; From a personal note, I'm just\nlike sitting over here thinking, man,\n\n171\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.736\nI'm going through this\nhome renovation process.\n\n172\n00:09:25.736 --> 00:09:30.330\nYou should see my backlog\nof want to haves, Jo.\n\n173\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the reason I can't deliver is\n\n174\n00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.950\na budget constraint.\n\n175\n00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.340\nSo I totally get it there.\n\n176\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.852\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say, how does that\nrelate to the budget then right now?\n\n177\n00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:42.653\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well.\n\n178\n00:09:42.653 --> 00:09:46.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I have a backlog\nof wants in a lot of areas, but\n\n179\n00:09:46.677 --> 00:09:52.164\nas far as the budget's concerned, yeah,\nthe two don't go together right now.\n\n180\n00:09:52.164 --> 00:09:55.411\n[LAUGH] So also what we're going to do\nthen, while we're talking about budget,\n\n181\n00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.840\nis we've got to close out the budget.\n\n182\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.220\nAnd we've got to actually look.\n\n183\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.530\nWe've really, really got to look\nat how much we've spent versus\n\n184\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.570\nhow much we expected to spend.\n\n185\n00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:10.522\nSo IT financial management, I mean, they\nbelong in our service management arena.\n\n186\n00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:13.132\nIT financial management,\nthough, will help us with that,\n\n187\n00:10:13.132 --> 00:10:16.035\nbecause they control all of our\nbudgets and all of our accounting.\n\n188\n00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:19.310\nThen you'll see that in this\nparticular chart, look at this,\n\n189\n00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:24.158\nthe projected budget was $3,000 or\njust over $3,000 and we only spent.\n\n190\n00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:26.985\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, $2,750.\n\n191\n00:10:26.985 --> 00:10:27.878\nHow often does that happen?\n\n192\n00:10:27.878 --> 00:10:28.995\n&gt;&gt; Not very.\n\n193\n00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:32.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right let's look at this,\n\n194\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.160\nlet's put our realistic hat on here.\n\n195\n00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.120\nIt can happen.\n\n196\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.630\nThere's nothing wrong with that,\nnothing wrong at all.\n\n197\n00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.310\nIf there's too much of a gap,\nthough, either way.\n\n198\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:50.630\nIf we've completely, if we've overspent\nby, say, double what we projected,\n\n199\n00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.970\nor maybe we underspent by, say, I mean,\n\n200\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:00.520\nwe've got $3,000 there that was projected,\nif we've only spent $1,000, for instance.\n\n201\n00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're going to really\nthink about retiring that person, or\n\n202\n00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.188\nwhoever was in charge of the budget for\nthe next project.\n\n203\n00:11:08.188 --> 00:11:09.695\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we have a lot of,\n\n204\n00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:12.850\nit just brings up a lot of questions,\nlike what went wrong?\n\n205\n00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.504\nWhat didn't we do?\n\n206\n00:11:14.504 --> 00:11:16.139\nWhy were we so off on this?\n\n207\n00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:20.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's down to bad planning,\nit's down to bad planning.\n\n208\n00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:26.230\nThings do change, and I'm fully aware that\nprices on things like licenses change.\n\n209\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.480\nPrices on our hardware changes,\nand things do change.\n\n210\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.810\nAnd yes, we always wanna put in\nsome contingency into our budget.\n\n211\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:41.630\nBut if we are so far out,\nif we're out by 50%,\n\n212\n00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:47.250\nthen that means that we've really not\ndone our estimating very well at all.\n\n213\n00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.320\nBearing in mind that our budget\nshould be our overall project budget.\n\n214\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.014\nIt should include all of our resources,\nand labor costs, et cetera,\n\n215\n00:11:54.014 --> 00:11:57.976\nas well as the hardware and any software\nthat we've had to purchase, too.\n\n216\n00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:02.966\nSo if we're way out,\nthen that's down to bad planning.\n\n217\n00:12:02.966 --> 00:12:07.643\nAnd maybe our financial person who was\nmanaging the finances for the budget, for\n\n218\n00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:11.907\nthe project, maybe they need a little\nbit more training in estimating and\n\n219\n00:12:11.907 --> 00:12:13.660\nin managing a budget as well.\n\n220\n00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.430\nSo also part of the close-out then\nof the project is that transition\n\n221\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:24.420\nto operational teams, and this is\nwhere I want to use the word devops.\n\n222\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.640\nThis is where I also want to emphasize\nin that last bullet point, transition.\n\n223\n00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.150\nThis is not where we throw\nit all over the fence and\n\n224\n00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.110\nwe leave it to our service management\nguys to pick up the pieces.\n\n225\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're not just wiping\nour hands of the situation.\n\n226\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.760\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.\n\n227\n00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.642\nAnd I have to say that this is\nsomething that, in an ideal\n\n228\n00:12:50.642 --> 00:12:55.100\nworld, that's something\nthat shouldn't happen.\n\n229\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.820\nBut nowadays in an IT world as well,\nit's something that we've become more and\n\n230\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.910\nmore aware of.\n\n231\n00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.940\nIt's something that we will,\nwe use terms like devops now,\n\n232\n00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.510\nwhich it's been a term that's been\naround for a long, long time.\n\n233\n00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.960\nBut it's actually something that's\nbeginning to sort of pick up pace now\n\n234\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.440\nin our IT environment.\n\n235\n00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.110\nThis is about transition.\n\n236\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.100\nIt's all about actually\nhanding something over and\n\n237\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.180\nthen saying, are you okay with that?\n\n238\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.286\nAnd by the way, I'm gonna be here for\nthe next few weeks.\n\n239\n00:13:26.286 --> 00:13:30.601\nYou know, when we hand over,\nwhen we finish recording and\n\n240\n00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:37.440\nwe hand over an entire series to you, and\nthen it's available for you to watch.\n\n241\n00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.380\nYou will never hear us turn around and\nsay, none of us,\n\n242\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.290\nyou'll never hear us turn around and\nsay, all right, that's it.\n\n243\n00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.510\nHere's your show, watch it,\nhope you enjoy it.\n\n244\n00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.910\nWe always give you the opportunity\nto catch up with us via the forum,\n\n245\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.960\nvia the chat,\nto catch up with us in any other way so\n\n246\n00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.500\nthat we can give you any feedback.\n\n247\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:04.300\nSo that you can answer any question,\nand we'll help you with that question.\n\n248\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.052\nEven if that question is something to do\nwith the way that you do things right now\n\n249\n00:14:09.052 --> 00:14:13.373\nand is not necessarily directly\nrelated to what's in the content, but\n\n250\n00:14:13.373 --> 00:14:16.991\nmight be a question on how you\napply what's in the content.\n\n251\n00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:19.331\nWe're always going to be available.\n\n252\n00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:21.645\nThat's part of that transition.\n\n253\n00:14:21.645 --> 00:14:27.188\nWe're handing this over to you,\nwe're handing over the knowledge to you.\n\n254\n00:14:27.188 --> 00:14:29.683\nBut we're not just gonna run\naway as fast as we can and\n\n255\n00:14:29.683 --> 00:14:31.340\nhope that you never call us again.\n\n256\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.060\nWe want you to be able to use it.\n\n257\n00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.160\nWhat's the point in you learning\na new skill if you can't use it?\n\n258\n00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.220\nSo the emphasis here has\nto be on transition.\n\n259\n00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.780\nNow what's different with the agile\nenvironment to the traditional waterfall\n\n260\n00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.620\napproach is that transitions happen\nwith every single iteration.\n\n261\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.795\nSo every single episode that you have\nwatched, you've learnt a little bit more,\n\n262\n00:14:54.795 --> 00:14:55.781\nhopefully.\n\n263\n00:14:55.781 --> 00:15:00.290\n[LAUGH] So hand-over itself\nshould be a mere formality.\n\n264\n00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.130\nWhen we close out our very,\nvery last episode,\n\n265\n00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.887\nwhen you have done your sample paper and\nwe've finished our very last episode,\n\n266\n00:15:07.887 --> 00:15:11.730\nthat hand-over, that completion\nshould be a mere formality.\n\n267\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.860\nBut you'll still hear me say to you, if\nyou've got any questions come back to us,\n\n268\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.710\nbecause we don't just simply\nthrow it over the fence.\n\n269\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.718\nWhat it really means is that\nwhen the project is closed,\n\n270\n00:15:22.718 --> 00:15:25.480\nwe're just not developing anything more.\n\n271\n00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.180\nIt doesn't mean that we're not\ngonna help with anything else.\n\n272\n00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.410\nIt just means that we're not\ndeveloping any new functionality, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.030\nSo we never just sort of\nthrow it over the fence.\n\n274\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.610\nWhat we will do is we\nwill do an assessment,\n\n275\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:46.050\na benefits realization exercise,\nto see whether we have\n\n276\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.650\nachieved what we're supposed to achieve\nin terms of ROI and in terms of VOI.\n\n277\n00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.800\nSo I have a question for you.\n\n278\n00:15:55.147 --> 00:15:58.132\nI know, I get that look on my face,\nand she looks at me like, no.\n\n279\n00:15:58.132 --> 00:15:58.643\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n280\n00:15:58.643 --> 00:16:00.375\nOf course, she does, right?\nYeah.\n\n281\n00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:07.661\nAfter close out, when do you think you\nshould do the realisation assessment?\n\n282\n00:16:07.661 --> 00:16:10.387\n&gt;&gt; After close out.\n\n283\n00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:12.358\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I already said that.\n\n284\n00:16:12.358 --> 00:16:15.983\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; If there's any like trickery going on\n\n285\n00:16:15.983 --> 00:16:16.554\nhere.\n\n286\n00:16:16.554 --> 00:16:22.122\nSo let's see, it's probably on the screen,\nbut you know we can't see that far.\n\n287\n00:16:22.122 --> 00:16:24.944\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when she look for that answer,\n\n288\n00:16:24.944 --> 00:16:26.440\nI'm gonna get Taylor to hide it.\n\n289\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.228\n&gt;&gt; It needs to be during, see,\n\n290\n00:16:28.228 --> 00:16:29.885\nI'm like falling-\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Taylor.\n\n291\n00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:33.916\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm falling back into the\nwaterfall style because that would be in\n\n292\n00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:35.030\nour closing phase.\n\n293\n00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.277\nWe don't have a closing phase here, so\n\n294\n00:16:39.277 --> 00:16:43.663\nto speak so maybe in our last iteration?\n\n295\n00:16:43.663 --> 00:16:45.630\n&gt;&gt; That was a big sigh, I know.\n\n296\n00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.756\nNo, that's why Taylor,\nI got Taylor to hide this actually.\n\n297\n00:16:49.756 --> 00:16:51.163\nThank you Taylor.\n\n298\n00:16:51.163 --> 00:16:53.241\n[LAUGH] Benefits realization.\n\n299\n00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:59.520\nHow can you realize benefits\nwhen you're deploying a service?\n\n300\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.850\nWhich is what you've mentioned and\neven in a waterfall approach,\n\n301\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.980\nwe don't do benefits realization right\nat the very, very end of the project.\n\n302\n00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.617\nBenefits realization is something\nthat can actually take place over\n\n303\n00:17:09.617 --> 00:17:10.393\na matter of months.\n\n304\n00:17:10.393 --> 00:17:11.331\n&gt;&gt; The continuous monitoring.\n\n305\n00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:15.309\n&gt;&gt; Right, because quite often we\ndon't know that we've achieved\n\n306\n00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:20.010\na return until maybe our next\nyear's sales figures have come in.\n\n307\n00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.644\nSo it can take place weeks or\nmonths after go live,\n\n308\n00:17:23.644 --> 00:17:26.594\nbut it should be an iterative exercise.\n\n309\n00:17:26.594 --> 00:17:30.330\nAnd it should allow for\nbenefits to be realized.\n\n310\n00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.585\nIt's not something that\nwe can do immediately.\n\n311\n00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:35.663\nI'm not going to, it's not like\ngiving you a new cellphone and\n\n312\n00:17:35.663 --> 00:17:37.940\nthen say, okay,\ndo you like your cellphone?\n\n313\n00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.652\nAnd you say, but\nI haven't even opened the box yet.\n\n314\n00:17:40.652 --> 00:17:45.595\n&gt;&gt; And even in things like security and\nIT, and that is so hard for individuals\n\n315\n00:17:45.595 --> 00:17:50.299\nto see a lot of the times because it's\nnot always what are you getting but\n\n316\n00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:53.160\nit's sometimes what are you not getting?\n\n317\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.671\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; What are you preventing here?\n\n318\n00:17:54.671 --> 00:17:56.341\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what are you saving?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n319\n00:17:56.341 --> 00:18:01.982\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you, deploying a new release for\nyour service test software for instance.\n\n320\n00:18:01.982 --> 00:18:07.095\nAnd what we're actually doing is,\nwe're trying to reduce the number of calls\n\n321\n00:18:07.095 --> 00:18:12.380\ninto the service desk by increasing\nthe number of FAQ area of the website.\n\n322\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.489\nWell, in which case then, you need to\nmonitor that over a period of time and\n\n323\n00:18:16.489 --> 00:18:20.144\nthen to have a comparison for\nwhat it was like before the project And\n\n324\n00:18:20.144 --> 00:18:22.059\nthat's what we're trying to do.\n\n325\n00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:25.245\nWe have to do that comparison\nto what life was like before,\n\n326\n00:18:25.245 --> 00:18:27.230\nin other words our baseline.\n\n327\n00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.777\nAnd then we bring in our project cost.\n\n328\n00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:33.897\nAnd then we work out whether\nwe've actually saved any money or\n\n329\n00:18:33.897 --> 00:18:36.320\nwhether we've realized the benefits.\n\n330\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.857\nSo it's not something that you're\ngoing to see straight away.\n\n331\n00:18:38.857 --> 00:18:42.607\nI can't give you a cell phone and then ask\nyou five minutes after you've turned it on\n\n332\n00:18:42.607 --> 00:18:44.710\nwhether you like and\nwhether you can use it.\n\n333\n00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna take a few months for\n\n334\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.358\nyou to learn how to use it and\nlearn all the features.\n\n335\n00:18:48.358 --> 00:18:50.932\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we really put it to\nthe test, do all sorts of things.\n\n336\n00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:53.808\nRun that battery life down,\ndrop it a few times.\n\n337\n00:18:53.808 --> 00:18:54.924\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n338\n00:18:54.924 --> 00:18:57.503\nI managed that one really well, actually.\n\n339\n00:18:57.503 --> 00:19:00.396\nYeah, so benefits realization,\n\n340\n00:19:00.396 --> 00:19:05.585\nit's not always the responsibility\nof the project team.\n\n341\n00:19:05.585 --> 00:19:09.575\nBecause quite often,\nonce we release something,\n\n342\n00:19:09.575 --> 00:19:12.730\nonce we walked away and\nclose out that project,\n\n343\n00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.450\nthe benefits might not be realized for\nanother six months to a year.\n\n344\n00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.669\nSo it might not be\nthe project team doing it.\n\n345\n00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:23.262\nIt might be sort of financial management\nteam, part of our operations of our\n\n346\n00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:28.770\nservice management environment that\nare completing the benefits realisation.\n\n347\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.280\nIt's not always the project team.\n\n348\n00:19:31.402 --> 00:19:35.480\nAnd the best practice way, we should\nbe conducting benefits realization\n\n349\n00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.980\nwhen we produce each release.\n\n350\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.930\nWe should be saying, okay, is this release\nachieving what it's supposed to achieve?\n\n351\n00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.550\nAnd that's a taking it up,\nthat's great, but\n\n352\n00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.810\nit still doesn't tell us whether\nwe're actually realizing our benefit.\n\n353\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.090\nSo we do have to monitor that.\n\n354\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:59.960\nSo the project manager or the scrub master\nwill prepare the plan for realization.\n\n355\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.820\nAnd they also prepare these KPIs,\nthe Key Performance Indicators,\n\n356\n00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.340\nthat will allow us to monitor on\nan ongoing basis how performance.\n\n357\n00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.520\nBut the project manager or\n\n358\n00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.940\nthe scrub master doesn't always\ncalculate that realisation.\n\n359\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.656\nUltimately, what we've got to ensure and\nthis is gonna be\n\n360\n00:20:20.656 --> 00:20:25.948\nthe last thing I'm gonna tell you\nas far as episodes of concerns,\n\n361\n00:20:25.948 --> 00:20:31.359\nwe've got to make sure that every\nsingle project delivers value.\n\n362\n00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:35.905\nAnd we can only ensure that every\nproject ensures value if we can measure\n\n363\n00:20:35.905 --> 00:20:39.260\nwhether value has actually been achieved.\n\n364\n00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.649\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's definitely true and\n\n365\n00:20:40.649 --> 00:20:42.601\nsometimes it is difficult\nto measure that value.\n\n366\n00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:46.093\nEspecially when you're\ndealing with a customer base.\n\n367\n00:20:46.093 --> 00:20:48.434\nYou don't have a direct communication and\n\n368\n00:20:48.434 --> 00:20:52.075\nthings like surveys can be super\nhelpful in situations like this or\n\n369\n00:20:52.075 --> 00:20:56.240\nany other kind of performance\nmonitoring tools and metrics like that.\n\n370\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.409\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nbe careful when it comes to surveys.\n\n371\n00:20:58.409 --> 00:21:01.690\nRemember what we discussed in\nprevious episodes as well.\n\n372\n00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.436\nSurveys do have value.\n\n373\n00:21:05.436 --> 00:21:09.990\nBut what a survey will give you is\nwhat the customer wants to tell you.\n\n374\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.486\nAnd so, remember the get off your bum\napproach that we discussed in previous\n\n375\n00:21:14.486 --> 00:21:15.195\nepisodes.\n\n376\n00:21:15.195 --> 00:21:16.834\nAnd actually observe directly.\n\n377\n00:21:16.834 --> 00:21:18.640\nGo and see what's going on.\n\n378\n00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.947\nBecause unfortunately,\nwhen you conduct a survey, it's a bit-\n\n379\n00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.550\n&gt;&gt; There may be a disconnect there.\n\n380\n00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.060\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a bit like if you're\nsitting there in a restaurant with your\n\n381\n00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.970\nfamily or your with some friends and\nthe waitress comes up to you and\n\n382\n00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.710\nsay is everything all\nright with your meal?\n\n383\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.716\nInvariably we always turn around and\nsay yes, even though it's not, don't we?\n\n384\n00:21:36.716 --> 00:21:37.332\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n385\n00:21:37.332 --> 00:21:38.519\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n386\n00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:40.684\nYeah, and we're all guilty of it.\n\n387\n00:21:40.684 --> 00:21:41.184\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We all do it.\n\n388\n00:21:41.184 --> 00:21:42.262\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And they walk away,\n\n389\n00:21:42.262 --> 00:21:43.047\nand you're like,\n\n390\n00:21:43.047 --> 00:21:45.452\nman this quesadilla tastes like cardboard.\n[LAUGH]\n\n391\n00:21:45.452 --> 00:21:47.544\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not coming back there again.\n\n392\n00:21:47.544 --> 00:21:48.910\nAnd that's the problem,\n\n393\n00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.850\nis that we don't actually fill out\nsurveys with any degree of truth.\n\n394\n00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:56.454\nSometimes, we will tend to fill out\na survey if we're really, really,\n\n395\n00:21:56.454 --> 00:21:57.350\nreally annoyed.\n\n396\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.667\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or we're really, really,\n\n397\n00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:00.620\nreally impressed.\n\n398\n00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.490\nIf we're sorta one extreme to the other.\n\n399\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.920\nIf not, we're just kinda cut it down\nthe middle and just take down the middle.\n\n400\n00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.916\nSo surveys, and even then, you know,\n\n401\n00:22:08.916 --> 00:22:12.251\nyou'll get about 20% of surveys\nthat are actually returned.\n\n402\n00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:17.550\nSo, surveys themselves, and I just wanted\nto mention that as you brought that in.\n\n403\n00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.846\nThey can be valuable but we've got to\ntake them as objectively as we can.\n\n404\n00:22:21.846 --> 00:22:25.970\n&gt;&gt; So finding some kind of metric or\nPKI that works for your organization.\n\n405\n00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.856\n&gt;&gt; KPI even, yeah.\n\n406\n00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:31.134\n&gt;&gt; I did that in between talking in shows,\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n407\n00:22:31.134 --> 00:22:33.342\nYeah, they're like why is\nshe talking about that?\n\n408\n00:22:33.342 --> 00:22:36.478\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; KPI, Key Performance Indicator.\n\n409\n00:22:36.478 --> 00:22:39.506\nListen, too many acronyms and IT guys.\n\n410\n00:22:39.506 --> 00:22:42.785\nWe already know this\n&gt;&gt; And not enough margaritas, perhaps.\n\n411\n00:22:42.785 --> 00:22:45.947\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Any who, Jo do you have any\nfinal thoughts or anything else that\n\n412\n00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:49.320\nyou'd like to convey before we go\nahead and close out this episode?\n\n413\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.\n\n414\n00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:53.217\nI've always got some\nfinal nuggets of wisdom.\n\n415\n00:22:53.217 --> 00:22:55.264\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Great tid bits, yeah.\n\n416\n00:22:55.264 --> 00:22:59.762\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at this point in time,\nin your next very, very small episode,\n\n417\n00:22:59.762 --> 00:23:04.571\nyou are going to be invited to download\nall of the material that accompanies\n\n418\n00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:06.279\nthis particular series.\n\n419\n00:23:06.279 --> 00:23:10.699\nAnd then undertake the exercises that\nthere are at the end of every single\n\n420\n00:23:10.699 --> 00:23:11.650\nepisode.\n\n421\n00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.820\nSo please feel free to do that.\n\n422\n00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.540\nAnd if you do have any questions,\nthen come back to us.\n\n423\n00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.585\nWe're here, we're

think\nyou might find them a challenge.\n\n428\n00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.662\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No but in all seriousness,\nthank you so much for\n\n429\n00:23:34.662 --> 00:23:37.971\neverything you've brought to\nthe table here, we appreciate that.\n\n430\n00:23:37.971 --> 00:23:41.720\nI appreciate you guys hanging with us but\nnow's the time for us to sign out.\n\n431\n00:23:41.720 -->

right now, what we're doing\nin this particular episode,\n\n4\n00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.950\nthis is our final episode for\nour Agile Project Management Concept show.\n\n5\n00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.300\nAnd in this particular episode, what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to overview\n\n6\n00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.020\nthe Agile foundation certification,\na sample paper.\n\n7\n00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.940\nThat's the one that you downloaded from\nthe website with your course materials.\n\n8\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.145\nAnd, hopefully, the one that you\nhad a chance to take a look at.\n\n9\n00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:39.311\nAnd you've gone through, and\nthen I'm gonna go through it with you and\n\n10\n00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:42.446\nsee if we can iron out any\nquestions that you may have.\n\n11\n00:00:42.446 --> 00:00:48.112\nNow, don't forget, the questions that you\nhave in the sample paper are based on both\n\n12\n00:00:48.112 --> 00:00:53.565\nour episodes and also the supplementary\nmaterial that you have downloaded.\n\n13\n00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:54.965\nSo all of those course notes,\n\n14\n00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:58.280\nthe additional material that\nyou have in front of you.\n\n15\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.690\nNow, hopefully,\n\n16\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.250\nwe should be in a position where you'd be\nable to pass the exam with flying colors.\n\n17\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.420\nYour real exam when you come to take it,\nyou will need to take,\n\n18\n00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.710\nor you'll need to achieve,\nsorry, 28 out of 40,\n\n19\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.400\n40 questions,\nin order to be able to pass the exam.\n\n20\n00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.140\nIt's a multiple choice exam.\n\n21\n00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.465\nIt's simple multiple choice\nonly one right answer, and\n\n22\n00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:26.600\nyou'll need to get 28\nout 40 in order to pass.\n\n23\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.620\nNow this sample paper that you have, well,\nthe sample paper's only 20 questions.\n\n24\n00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.310\nAnd so you only need to get 14 out of\nthose 20 in order to be able to pass.\n\n25\n00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.100\nSo let's see how you did, shall we?\n\n26\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.990\nSo here we have it then.\n\n27\n00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.600\nAs if by magic in front of you,\nwe've got a sample paper A,\n\n28\n00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.910\nwhich is the one that you\nshould have downloaded.\n\n29\n00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.010\nAnd you will see that it tells you\nthat it's a specimen paper only.\n\n30\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.570\nAnd it's 20 questions, and the pass mark\nis 14 out of 20, as I've already said.\n\n31\n00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.761\nSo let's take a look at\nthese questions then.\n\n32\n00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:04.370\nSo let’s start with question number 1.\n\n33\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.360\nWhy is 7 plus or\nminus 2 an optional size of an Agile team?\n\n34\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.090\nWell, we know that Agile\nteams need to be kept small.\n\n35\n00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.580\nAnd we know that Agile teams,\nif they get too large, well, the stand up\n\n36\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.643\ncan be quite cumbersome, and could\npotentially take longer than 15 minutes.\n\n37\n00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:26.880\nAnd we also know that there's\ngoing to be less collaboration\n\n38\n00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.710\nif you've got a larger team.\n\n39\n00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.160\nSo the reason why we do that is to ensure\neffective communication and collaboration.\n\n40\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.320\nIt's not about fitting\neverybody in to an entire room.\n\n41\n00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.020\nAlthough, we do like to have people in\nthe same room where possible.We also\n\n42\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.530\naccept that you know common practices,\nnowadays, such as remote working and using\n\n43\n00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.370\ntools like Skype and FaceTime, well, they\ncan help achieve exactly the same results.\n\n44\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.890\nAnd it's not about control.\n\n45\n00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.555\nBecause don't forget,\nas far as Agile is concerned,\n\n46\n00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:02.354\nwe're really not controlling the team.\n\n47\n00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:04.980\nThe team are empowered\nto act on themselves.\n\n48\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.980\nSo it really is to ensure effective\ncommunication and collaboration.\n\n49\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.360\nIt's not a hard or fast rule.\n\n50\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.360\nIt's just the case of\nthat's what we prefer,\n\n51\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.160\nand that's why we use the word optimal.\n\n52\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.366\nSo now on question 2, we're actually\ntaking a look at the values,\n\n53\n00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:22.762\nthe Agile manifesto.\n\n54\n00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:26.031\nAnd one of those values\nare producing work and\n\n55\n00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:29.940\nsoftware over comprehensive documentation.\n\n56\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.560\nAnd the answer to that, you'll find,\nway back in one of our opening episodes,\n\n57\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.560\nin this particular series, where we\nlooked at the Agile manifesto, and\n\n58\n00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.850\nwe looked at the principles\nof Agile as well.\n\n59\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.737\nSo the Agile manifesto, well, we know that\nAgile is a framework, it's a methodology.\n\n60\n00:03:50.737 --> 00:03:55.697\nAnd, well, it consists of many\nmethodologies, including Lean and\n\n61\n00:03:55.697 --> 00:04:00.580\nScrum and Kanban and XP, and\nwe know that we welcome change.\n\n62\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.610\nUnlike the traditional waterfall approach,\nwhere change is not particularly welcome,\n\n63\n00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.228\nwe know that in an Agile approach,\nwe want to welcome change.\n\n64\n00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:12.580\nSo what does the Agile manifesto say that\nwe should do with changing requirements?\n\n65\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.950\nWell, welcome them.\n\n66\n00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.530\nSo it's going to be A or B, but then the\ntop one says, except in late development.\n\n67\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.600\nWell, bearing that some change actually\noccurs as a result of testing or\n\n68\n00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.920\nmaybe fail-testing,\nthen that wouldn't make A appropriate.\n\n69\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.620\nAnd when we talk about late development\nin Agile iteration, it's between one and\n\n70\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.720\nfour weeks.\n\n71\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.530\nSo late development really kind\nof means that last week, but\n\n72\n00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.560\nwe welcome change any time.\n\n73\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.561\nSo B is the answer to this one, welcoming\nchanges even in late development.\n\n74\n00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:52.560\nOur next question, question number 4,\nis the role of a ScrumMaster.\n\n75\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.110\nNow, we have two roles that\nwe have identified, well,\n\n76\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.680\nI guess three if you count\nthe Agile team itself, but\n\n77\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.390\nwe've got two main roles that\nwe've identified in an Agile team.\n\n78\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.538\nAnd that is the role of the product owner.\n\n79\n00:05:07.538 --> 00:05:11.900\nAnd the product owner takes ownership and\naccountability for\n\n80\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.630\nthe functionality and for\nthe product itself, for the software.\n\n81\n00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.710\nAnd we also have the role\nof the ScrumMaster.\n\n82\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.880\nAnd the ScrumMaster's job is\nto take accountability for\n\n83\n00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.960\nthe smooth running of the team, for\n\n84\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.200\nall of those interpersonal issues and\nall of the scheduling issues, etc.\n\n85\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.130\nSo as we said,\nthe smooth running of the team.\n\n86\n00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.520\nNow I know that my co-host, Cherokee,\nin some of our previous episodes,\n\n87\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.940\nif you've looked back on those episodes\nbefore you've done this review,\n\n88\n00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.100\nshe struggles sometimes with the\nresponsibilities of the product owner and\n\n89\n00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.340\nthe ScrumMaster.\n\n90\n00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.020\nAnd don't worry, because everybody does.\n\n91\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.820\nIt can be a very, very fine line.\n\n92\n00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.760\nAnd you've really go to get your\nhead around it before you can fully\n\n93\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.850\nunderstand it.\n\n94\n00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.490\nAnd that might take some doing.\n\n95\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.610\nSo if you do have any\nquestions about that then\n\n96\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.920\nfeel free to drop us\na message in our forum.\n\n97\n00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.207\nAnd I'll be happy to help you with\nany queries that you might have.\n\n98\n00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:12.675\nSo the role of the ScrumMaster\nis to remove impediments.\n\n99\n00:06:12.675 --> 00:06:14.781\nIt's not to hold the vision.\n\n100\n00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.463\nThe vision is for the entire project, and\n\n101\n00:06:17.463 --> 00:06:22.490\nthe ScrumMaster is the relevant\nScrumMaster for that iteration.\n\n102\n00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.810\nAnd determining who does the work,\nwell, that's done by skills, and\n\n103\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.330\nthat's actually done by the team itself.\n\n104\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.913\nAnd in terms of the skils where the\nproduct owner will help with the skills.\n\n105\n00:06:32.913 --> 00:06:37.885\nAnd signing off the work is done, well,\nthe dumbness, as we call it of work,\n\n106\n00:06:37.885 --> 00:06:42.860\nwould be signed off by the business\nrelationship manager or the lead business\n\n107\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.316\nrepresentative, because, after all,\nwe're delivering value to the customer.\n\n108\n00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:50.733\nSo let's take a look at number 5, then.\n\n109\n00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:53.150\nWhat do you remember\nabout question number 5?\n\n110\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:00.136\nAgain, our three pillars were found in\none of our opening episodes to Agile.\n\n111\n00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:04.609\nAnd that was the episode where we\nlooked at the Agile principles, and\n\n112\n00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:07.232\nwhere we looked at the Agile manifesto,\n\n113\n00:07:07.232 --> 00:07:11.430\nand where we also looked at\nthe three pillars of Agile.\n\n114\n00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:17.838\nAnd those three pillars were inspection,\ntransparency and adaptation.\n\n115\n00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:20.860\nSo it's all about being transparent\nin everything that we do.\n\n116\n00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.840\nSo that we can inspect\neverything that we do,\n\n117\n00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.090\nand then we can adapt whatever\nis not quite working.\n\n118\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.590\nAnd then we're transparent in monitoring\nthat, and, well, it's a cycle.\n\n119\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.400\nYeah, we're transparent in monitoring\nthat, and then we inspect and we adapt.\n\n120\n00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.160\nAnd these are our three pillars of Agile.\n\n121\n00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.610\nControl is not a pillar of Agile,\nbecause, of course,\n\n122\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.620\nwe let the team control themselves.\n\n123\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.547\nTheir aim is to deliver\nvalue to the customer.\n\n124\n00:07:51.547 --> 00:07:56.553\nAnd so we empower them to be able\nto deliver that value in a way\n\n125\n00:07:56.553 --> 00:08:02.576\nthat they deem to be the most efficient,\nas well as the most effective.\n\n126\n00:08:02.576 --> 00:08:04.235\nSo let's take a look at number six then.\n\n127\n00:08:04.235 --> 00:08:09.064\nThe number six, well, now that is\na phrase that you'd expect to find\n\n128\n00:08:09.064 --> 00:08:13.510\nelsewhere in IT methodologies and\nframeworks, such as ITIL.\n\n129\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.370\nWe talked about recourse analysis.\n\n130\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.240\nWell we know in ITIL world,\n\n131\n00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.550\nrecourse analysis is something that is\nassociated with problem management.\n\n132\n00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.680\nTrying to find out why something happened.\n\n133\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.940\nNot necessarily just fixing it,\nbut finding out why it happened.\n\n134\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.742\nWhen would we want to do that?\n\n135\n00:08:31.742 --> 00:08:36.480\nWell you're going to find the answer to\nthis actually laid out in the additional\n\n136\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.582\ninformation that you've downloaded\nfrom your series material.\n\n137\n00:08:41.582 --> 00:08:44.520\nBut you're also gonna find\nthis out with common sense.\n\n138\n00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.050\nWhen would you try and\nfind out why something went wrong?\n\n139\n00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.070\nWell, you try and\nfind out during a retrospective session,\n\n140\n00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.860\nto identify why something went wrong.\n\n141\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.990\nYou're not going to use it\nduring a planning stage,\n\n142\n00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.050\nbecause root cause analysis is about\nfinding out why something went wrong.\n\n143\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.200\nSomething shouldn't be going\nwrong in a planning stage.\n\n144\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.260\nTo say it's never used in agile\nenvironments is not true.\n\n145\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.520\nAnd one of the myths that we've really\ngot to overcome when it comes to\n\n146\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.220\nmethodologies, is that there is a\ndisconnect between project management and\n\n147\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.400\nservice management, because there isn't.\n\n148\n00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.510\nAnd the two should be working together,\nthere should be synergy between them.\n\n149\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.030\nThis is where the term DevOps\noriginally comes from, it's the synergy\n\n150\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:32.410\nbetween project management and\nour service management environment.\n\n151\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:37.108\nSo to say that we would never ever\ncross any of these methodologies,\n\n152\n00:09:37.108 --> 00:09:39.770\nthat's completely wrong.\n\n153\n00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.018\nSo, where do we use root cause analysis?\n\n154\n00:09:42.018 --> 00:09:46.935\nWhat do we try to find out what went wrong\nduring a demonstration to end users.\n\n155\n00:09:46.935 --> 00:09:51.638\nAbsolutely not, and if you were in that\nposition where that's what you were doing,\n\n156\n00:09:51.638 --> 00:09:55.427\nI would really say you're in the wrong\nposition at that point in time.\n\n157\n00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:59.287\nAnd at that point in time, you probably\nneed to be ending the demonstration.\n\n158\n00:09:59.287 --> 00:10:01.467\nSo yeah,\nwe don't do it in front of the users.\n\n159\n00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:05.867\nThis is where we look at how things went,\ndoing the retrospective, and\n\n160\n00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:07.577\nthen we'll do our recourse analysis.\n\n161\n00:10:08.967 --> 00:10:13.230\nSo the three Cs of the user story,\nif you remember,\n\n162\n00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:19.650\na user story is all about\nfinding out what the user wants.\n\n163\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.740\nAnd we do that through conversation,\nwe do that through talking to the users.\n\n164\n00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.690\nAnd then of course, if you remember,\nwe write it down on cards.\n\n165\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.630\nAnd of course we confirm with our\nusers that, well, this is their story,\n\n166\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.130\nthis is exactly what they want.\n\n167\n00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.280\nControl is not part of the user's story.\n\n168\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.320\nWe're not trying to control the users.\n\n169\n00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.680\nWe're trying to document what they need.\n\n170\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.160\nSo the question asked of you is, which\none of these is not part of the three Cs.\n\n171\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.670\nWell, B is the right answer to that.\n\n172\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.980\nSo what about refactoring?\n\n173\n00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.840\nWhat does refactoring do?\n\n174\n00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.070\nRefactoring is just about making\nsomething more efficient.\n\n175\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.800\nMaking something more effective.\n\n176\n00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.700\nSo it really is, it's not about removing\nany defect, it's just about making it\n\n177\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.820\nwork better, which is big,\nit's just improving the quality.\n\n178\n00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.350\nWe're not gonna alter the behavior,\nwe're not gonna alter the result.\n\n179\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.740\nWe're actually just improving the quality.\n\n180\n00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.650\nNow, the next one, number nine.\n\n181\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.540\nNumber nine looks at this Cone of\nUncertainty that again is found in your\n\n182\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.020\nsupplementary material,\nthe material that you've downloaded.\n\n183\n00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.705\nAnd of course the Cone of Uncertainty You\nwill see the diagram in there, and\n\n184\n00:11:34.705 --> 00:11:39.985\nit simply refers to the fact that,\nthe farther in the distance you are from\n\n185\n00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:45.163\nyour end result, then the more\nambiguous that result should be.\n\n186\n00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:49.380\nSo, the further away\nyou are from delivery,\n\n187\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.020\nthe less detailed your plan should be.\n\n188\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.480\nAnd we've talked about this right\nthe way throughout all of our episodes,\n\n189\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.780\nabout the fact that we don't\nplan the long term in detail.\n\n190\n00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:06.030\nSo the closer that you get to\nyour specific goal, then the more\n\n191\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:11.090\ndetailed your plan should be, and\nthe more detailed your design should be.\n\n192\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:17.200\nSo the further away you are,\nthen the more ambiguous those designs are,\n\n193\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.890\nwhich is why we call it a cone, because\nthat's basically what it looks like.\n\n194\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.990\nIs that we become more specific\nthe closer to our end goal.\n\n195\n00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.070\nWhich is why A is your right answer.\n\n196\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:33.250\nYour high level, your epic stories, the\nbig picture, contains limited knowledge.\n\n197\n00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:40.580\nSo we cannot predict\naccurately at that high level,\n\n198\n00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.790\nexactly what effort is going to be needed.\n\n199\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.520\nBut as we get closer to our end goal,\nthen the closer we get,\n\n200\n00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.570\nthe more detailed our\nrequirements should be.\n\n201\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.040\nSo number 10,\nthen Which of these describe Scrum?\n\n202\n00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.390\nWell we know that Scrum is a methodology.\n\n203\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.810\nAgain we mentioned this right at the very\nbeginning at one of our earlier episodes.\n\n204\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.130\nScrum is one of\nthe methodologies of Agile,\n\n205\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:13.220\nand Scrum also gives us\nthe Scrum master as well.\n\n206\n00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.000\nSo it is an Agile framework for\nproject management.\n\n207\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.800\nIt is not just about product development,\nit's about managing a project.\n\n208\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.810\nSome projects don't actually develop,\n\n209\n00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:32.320\nsome projects don't do anything new,\nthey change what's already there.\n\n210\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.460\nSo just remember,\nthis is about project management,\n\n211\n00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.600\nit's an approach to project management.\n\n212\n00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.630\nAnd it's not just about\nproduct development.\n\n213\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.960\nAnd in fact, we even looked at this in,\nit was probably about our fourth episode\n\n214\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.580\nin this particular series, where we looked\nat the fact that actually the Agile\n\n215\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.000\nprinciple, of doing one thing at a time,\none step at a time.\n\n216\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.710\nCan be applied to anything,\nnot just product development.\n\n217\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.540\nSo it's about managing\nany type of project.\n\n218\n00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.630\nSo the MoSCoW prioritization,\nif you remember MoSCoW stood for,\n\n219\n00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.450\nmust have, should have,\ncould have, and would like.\n\n220\n00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:16.970\nAnd that was something that we utilized\nwhen assessing user priorities.\n\n221\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.490\nWhat is it that the users must have?\n\n222\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.090\nWhat's a typical problem with this?\n\n223\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.265\nWell of course,\nit's that they want everything, right?\n\n224\n00:14:23.265 --> 00:14:27.210\n[LAUGH] That they put everything\ninto the must have category.\n\n225\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:31.040\nAnd nothing's in the should have, or the\ncould have, or the won't have right now,\n\n226\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.910\nor would like in the future,\neverything appears in must have.\n\n227\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.400\nAnd yeah,\nthat's just one of the typical problems.\n\n228\n00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.150\nAnd we've gotta balance that out,\nas project managers, as scrum masters, or\n\n229\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.940\nas even product owners, we've got to\nbalance that out and ensure that,\n\n230\n00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.180\nthe things that appear in the must have\nare those things that we must have, and\n\n231\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.780\nnot the nice to have, which should\nappear maybe in the should have, or\n\n232\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.750\neven in the could have.\n\n233\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.160\nSo what about a general benefit of Agile,\nthen.\n\n234\n00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.360\nWell a general benefit of Agile is that\nregular interaction with a customer.\n\n235\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.780\nWhich means that we should have increased\ncustomer satisfaction, because not only\n\n236\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.880\ndo they have regular interaction but\nthey also see regular results.\n\n237\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.760\nThese are results that\nare released on a regular basis,\n\n238\n00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.240\non an iterative basis,\nat the most, every four weeks.\n\n239\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.330\nSo a benefit is A,\nincrease customer satisfaction.\n\n240\n00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:33.150\nIt's not about fewer developers,\nbecause we may even need more developers\n\n241\n00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.900\nif we're doing a lot of work,\nin that four week period for instance.\n\n242\n00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.230\nAgile won't give you benefit, and with any\nframework and it doesn't matter whether\n\n243\n00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.050\nit's an Agile framework or\nwhether it's a waterfall framework.\n\n244\n00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.050\nIf it's managed badly and\nif the team don't know their part and\n\n245\n00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.420\ndon't understand their responsibilities,\nit's not gonna give any benefit at all.\n\n246\n00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.589\nSo Agile's not going to\ngive instant benefit,\n\n247\n00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:59.293\nit is not something that's automatic.\n\n248\n00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:02.943\nAnd whilst we don't like comprehensive\ndocumentation, and we don't like\n\n249\n00:16:02.943 --> 00:16:07.610\ncomprehensive, and elaborate processes,\nthat doesn't mean that we don't have them.\n\n250\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.370\nSo to say that we don't do any planning\nwould be a huge big mistake as well.\n\n251\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.090\nBecause if you don't plan anything,\nthen what are you going to get?\n\n252\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.590\nChaos.\n\n253\n00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:20.910\nSo Kanban, we know that Kanban was another\n\n254\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.500\nAgile methodology that\nlooked at the story boards.\n\n255\n00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.530\nAnd in fact, Kanban means visual board.\n\n256\n00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.852\nSo which of these are prescribed\nby the Kanban method?\n\n257\n00:16:30.852 --> 00:16:36.550\nWell, the product owner,\nthat comes from the Scrum methodology.\n\n258\n00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.557\nThe development team,\nthat's just something that is accepted\n\n259\n00:16:40.557 --> 00:16:44.290\nwithin waterfall projects that\nwe have a development team.\n\n260\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.520\nSo actually,\nneither of those are part of Kanban,\n\n261\n00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.150\nneither of those are specified in Kanban,\nremember?\n\n262\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.540\nRead the full question.\n\n263\n00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.530\nA lot of that acronym by the way,\nhave you heard it, RTFQ?\n\n264\n00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.490\nRead the full question, don't you go\nadding your own letters into that.\n\n265\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:06.430\nRead the full question,\nonly answer what's being asked of you.\n\n266\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.320\nDon't answer what you think you've read,\nanswer what you've really read.\n\n267\n00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.760\nBe careful cuz Kanban doesn't exclude\n\n268\n00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.440\nthose particular roles, but\nKanban doesn't prescribe those roles.\n\n269\n00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.980\nSo number 14 then, daily stand-up.\n\n270\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.252\nWe know that we should\ndo that every morning.\n\n271\n00:17:27.252 --> 00:17:30.202\nThe scrum team realizes they\ncan't complete the stories,\n\n272\n00:17:30.202 --> 00:17:32.160\nwhat should they do next?\n\n273\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.700\nThey simply negotiate with the product\nowner cuz he's responsible for\n\n274\n00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.430\nthe functionality, and try, and\n\n275\n00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.520\nnegotiate the scope of some of\nthe lowest priority stories.\n\n276\n00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.660\nCan we move them to another iteration?\n\n277\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.370\nSimple as that.\n\n278\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.890\nIf we don't think that we can do it,\nwe shouldn't be trying it, and\n\n279\n00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.888\nthen only delivering half of product.\n\n280\n00:17:54.888 --> 00:17:57.870\nWe should move those,\nmove them into the backlog, and\n\n281\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.690\nmove them into another iteration.\n\n282\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.778\nAnd it's the product owner\nthat takes accountability for\n\n283\n00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:04.611\ndelivering that functionality.\n\n284\n00:18:06.147 --> 00:18:10.310\nSo what advantage does Agile\nhave over Waterfall projects?\n\n285\n00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.450\nWell, change, we welcome change,\nsimple as that.\n\n286\n00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.350\nSo to say that it doesn't use any\nplanning, we've already talked about that.\n\n287\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.970\nAnd to say that it can cope with chaos,\nno, we still got to have planning.\n\n288\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:27.699\nAnd about the documentation, no,\nwe still gotta have some documentation,\n\n289\n00:18:27.699 --> 00:18:30.257\njust not comprehensive documentation.\n\n290\n00:18:30.257 --> 00:18:33.734\nSo the answer here is, B.\n\n291\n00:18:33.734 --> 00:18:38.562\nCSI that's in number 16,\nis actually a term that\n\n292\n00:18:38.562 --> 00:18:43.180\ncomes from the Agile methodology or\nframework.\n\n293\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:48.500\nAnd in Agile, we refer to CSI as\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n294\n00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.120\nIt's the term for ongoing improvement.\n\n295\n00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.490\nSo number 17 then,\n\n296\n00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.820\nwhich of these is not a stage of\nTuckmans model of group development?\n\n297\n00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:04.191\nWell, this is one that Cherokee mentioned\nin one of our previous episodes.\n\n298\n00:19:04.191 --> 00:19:09.640\nIn one of our previous episodes even,\nand this is starting,\n\n299\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.790\nwe have forming, storming, performing,\nbut we don't have starting.\n\n300\n00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.840\nThat's not one of those.\n\n301\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.220\nSo the answer here is B.\n\n302\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.120\nSo let's get on to number 18 then.\n\n303\n00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.670\nNumber 18, what would be\nthe response to a Test Manager\n\n304\n00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.500\nwho insists that it's gonna take too\nmuch time to test continuously, and\n\n305\n00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.120\nit'll be better to test at\nthe end of the project?\n\n306\n00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.520\nWhat advice would you give?\n\n307\n00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.010\nNo, you're not going to take\nthe baseball bat out at him, all right?\n\n308\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.345\nThat's not an option.\n\n309\n00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.960\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nI know that it might be tempting, and\n\n310\n00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.920\nit might also be tempting to stand there,\nand look at him, and go, seriously?\n\n311\n00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.835\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's not the answer either.\n\n312\n00:19:47.835 --> 00:19:50.465\nFor the start off,\nwe're not going to accept it, are we?\n\n313\n00:19:50.465 --> 00:19:51.725\nWe can't accept it.\n\n314\n00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:55.989\nIt goes against all of our Agile\nprinciples, but it's true,\n\n315\n00:19:55.989 --> 00:19:59.106\nif you tested the answer,\nsorry, B is true.\n\n316\n00:19:59.106 --> 00:20:03.554\nIf you test at the end of the project,\nyou might have to go back, and\n\n317\n00:20:03.554 --> 00:20:06.532\ndo absolutely everything again.\n\n318\n00:20:06.532 --> 00:20:08.780\nSo we're not gonna test at\nthe end of the project.\n\n319\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.690\nAnd testing just those important features,\nbut\n\n320\n00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.540\nit might be one of the small features\nthat might actually cause that\n\n321\n00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:21.040\nparticular retaliation to fail, and might\nactually cause the entire project to fail.\n\n322\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.770\nIt could set the project back by months,\npotentially.\n\n323\n00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.100\nSo we're not gonna do that.\n\n324\n00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.850\nAs I've said, it goes against\neverything that Agile stands for.\n\n325\n00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:30.890\nWe're not gonna do that.\n\n326\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.600\nSo we're gonna explain to them,\nnot with the baseball bat mind, but\n\n327\n00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.350\nwe're gonna explain to them that\nthe cost of finding defects is huge.\n\n328\n00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:45.470\nSo we're gonna do the testing on\na continual basis with each iteration.\n\n329\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.580\nSo let's take a look at number 19 then.\n\n330\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:54.240\nWhich of these would not be one of\nthe Lean Muda, or as we know them, wastes?\n\n331\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.530\nWe know that Muda is the Japanese word for\nwaste.\n\n332\n00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.653\nWe also mention it Kanban too.\n\n333\n00:20:58.653 --> 00:21:02.670\nWell, we know that partially\ndone work is a waste.\n\n334\n00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.920\nYeah, we know that.\n\n335\n00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.700\nWhy did you do it if you can't\nbe bothered to finish it or\n\n336\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.130\nif there's not enough time to finish it?\n\n337\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.130\nWe know that extra features, features\nthat are never ever going to be used,\n\n338\n00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.545\nwhy on Earth are you doing them?\n\n339\n00:21:14.545 --> 00:21:17.270\nOkay, that is just a waste.\n\n340\n00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:22.240\nAnd then relearning or doing something\nagain, that's just duplication, isn't it?\n\n341\n00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.170\nSo that's a waste, of course it is.\n\n342\n00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.240\nSo then that brings us to\nexploratory testing, and\n\n343\n00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.340\nwe know that we've got to test, and\nthere's never ever a wastage in testing.\n\n344\n00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.060\nSo we always want to test, that's never\ngoing to be a waste of your time.\n\n345\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.807\nSo the answer there has got to be D.\n\n346\n00:21:37.807 --> 00:21:41.358\nSo now, let's go one to number 20,\nour last question of this\n\n347\n00:21:41.358 --> 00:21:44.310\nparticular sample paper\n&gt;&gt; So what\n\n348\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.880\nwould be a concern if business users are\nnot actively engaged with the developers?\n\n349\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.750\nWell, if there's no communication there,\nthen there's a huge concern.\n\n350\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.530\nCuz the developers could\ndevelop what they want, and\n\n351\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.630\nthe customers are probably not\nlikely to get what they want.\n\n352\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:03.740\nRemember, we're here to\ndeliver value to the business,\n\n353\n00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.530\nand to deliver value to the customers.\n\n354\n00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.190\nWe're not here to deliver what we want or\ndo what we wanna do.\n\n355\n00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.180\nWe're here to do what's right for\nthe business.\n\n356\n00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.900\nSo what would be a concern?\n\n357\n00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.450\nWell, it could be that we\ndeveloped the wrong products.\n\n358\n00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.520\nIt could be that the products don't\nmeet any of the requirements that\n\n359\n00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.600\nthe customers have.\n\n360\n00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.460\nAnd it's certainly going to nurture or\nfoster an environment of mistrust.\n\n361\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.630\nSo all of the above is the only\nanswer that it really could be for\n\n362\n00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.010\nthis particular question.\n\n363\n00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:35.560\nSo that's
