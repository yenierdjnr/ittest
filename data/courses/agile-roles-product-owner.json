[CROSSTALK].\n\n3\n00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.415\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.858\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome and\n\n5\n00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:16.790\nthank you joining us here\nat your Agile Roles series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.710\nSpecifically focusing in\non that product owner.\n\n7\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.820\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.460\nAnd today in studios we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock to bring an introduction and\n\n9\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.884\nreally get us started and\nset some ground level expectations for us.\n\n10\n00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:33.920\nSo how you doing to day, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.710\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing really well.\n\n12\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.580\nI've been with you in this\nAgile journey so far.\n\n13\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.110\nWe're taking a look at\nindividual roles and so\n\n14\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.370\nnow we're going to be\nlooking at our product owner.\n\n15\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.790\nAnd boy, you have made sure that I know\nthe difference between scrum master,\n\n16\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.340\na product owner, but I think we're gonna\nspend some time really defining that\n\n17\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.080\nin this show, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n18\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.330\nwe've looked at in our other series,\nwe've looked at fundamentals of Agile and,\n\n19\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.890\nby the way,\nwe're not gonna be covering that.\n\n20\n00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.130\nWe've also looked at Agile testing and\nAgile scrum master, and in\n\n21\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.200\nthis particular series, we're gonna look\nat the specific role of product owner.\n\n22\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.126\nAnd yeah, you're right, I know-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:14.402\n&gt;&gt; I've beaten you to death\n\n24\n00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:16.834\nwith the difference between\na product owner and\n\n25\n00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:17.980\na scrum master.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n26\n00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.340\nit's really important to be able to define\nand differentiate between those roles.\n\n27\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n28\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.000\nAnd so what we'll do is just like\nthe start of every single sort of Agile\n\n29\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.950\nseries.\n\n30\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.055\nThis particular episode, our first episode\nis just gonna be a very very quick recap\n\n31\n00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:34.455\nover the principles of Agile and\n\n32\n00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:38.775\nthe Agile manifesto, just to get everybody\nin the mood for the series without having\n\n33\n00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:41.485\nto go over into any of the other series.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n34\n00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:42.905\n&gt;&gt; Right now we're just going to do\n\n35\n00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:46.615\na really really quick sort of\nintroduction into what Agile is and\n\n36\n00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:51.230\nwhere it comes from,\nreally what the methodology is all about.\n\n37\n00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.030\nAnd then, in subsequent episodes,\n\n38\n00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.110\nwe're gonna be looking at the specific\nrole of the product owner, and\n\n39\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.950\nwhat the product owner has responsibility\nfor, and what the product owner doesn't\n\n40\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.100\nhave responsibility for, and\nwhat is the scrum master actually does.\n\n41\n00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.120\nI mean, you might think of these roles\nas being sort of, well, fairly flexible.\n\n42\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.659\nThat's exactly what Agile is all about it,\nit's about flexibility, but\n\n43\n00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.490\nwe do have some defined\nresponsibilities within these roles.\n\n44\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.970\nIn other words, we have to know who to go\nto if we've got a query about something.\n\n45\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.510\nAnd so\nthat's what we're gonna be covering.\n\n46\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.660\nWe've got a couple of series,\none on product owners, as I said, and\n\n47\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.560\nwe've got the one on scrum master as well\nwhere we'll just be looking at those\n\n48\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160\nresponsibilities.\n&gt;&gt; You know, Joe, I had to do a little\n\n49\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.870\nbit more research after you left when we\nconcluded that last series that we had\n\n50\n00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.290\ntalked about, the Agile fundamentals.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n51\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.660\n&gt;&gt; I was curious, I'm like okay, so\n\n52\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.450\nyou had said look,\nthis is a manifesto for Agile\n\n53\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.670\nthat was created by these individuals,\nI had to do a little research.\n\n54\n00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.625\nAnd I thought that is so cool,\nlike 17 people just getting together to\n\n55\n00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:57.885\ncome up with these ideas, and\nthen people actually listen to them.\n\n56\n00:02:57.885 --> 00:03:02.050\nSo I'm working on, Jo, maybe we can\ncome up with something in the future,\n\n57\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.200\nlike sit in the mountains like in Utah,\nor maybe even Colorado.\n\n58\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Can we not do Hawaii?\n\n59\n00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:09.124\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Hawaii.\n\n60\n00:03:09.124 --> 00:03:13.584\nAnd we're going to come up with\nsome great, wonderful thing.\n\n61\n00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:14.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yea, well,\n\n62\n00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.734\nthis is not the first time\nthat this has happened either,\n\n63\n00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:21.870\nthis is one of the ways that we actually\ncome up with our methodologies in IT.\n\n64\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.359\nAnd in terms of IT governance,\nwe've got methodologies such as VeriSM,\n\n65\n00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.636\nwhich is a methodology\nlooking at expanding\n\n66\n00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:35.430\nservice management into\nthe wider ranging organization.\n\n67\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.353\nWe've got methodologies such as ITIL,\nnow, ITIL again,\n\n68\n00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:43.990\nvery similar to Agile, ITIL didn't\ncome from one particular place.\n\n69\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.230\nThat came from a group of academics\ngetting together, producing white papers.\n\n70\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.640\nAnd I always say, and\nI had this conversation just a little\n\n71\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.970\nwhile ago before we started this episode,\nthis is just common sense written down.\n\n72\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.363\nEverything that we talk about,\nand this type of governance,\n\n73\n00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:06.423\nthis governance sort of arena,\nit's all common sense.\n\n74\n00:04:06.423 --> 00:04:11.387\nBut you'll be surprised how much of it we\ndon't apply, or how much of it we don't\n\n75\n00:04:11.387 --> 00:04:15.986\nthink about because we're too busy\nthinking in the depths of the code, and\n\n76\n00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:20.001\nwe don't actually think about\nthe governance of our services and\n\n77\n00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:21.860\nhow we deliver our services.\n\n78\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.710\nSo yeah, we could come up with something.\n\n79\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.740\nAnd Hawaii sounds fantastic to me.\n\n80\n00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.201\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n81\n00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.083\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, what are some\n\n82\n00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:30.740\nof the methodologies that we'll\nsee being utilized here in Agile?\n\n83\n00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing that we gotta\n\n84\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.950\nremember is that Agile is not\nactually a methodology in itself.\n\n85\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.034\nAgile is not a single approach, it's\na group of methodologies, it's really,\n\n86\n00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:46.770\nreally sort of a pragmatic,\nwhat it says there, pragmatic mindset.\n\n87\n00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.990\nIt's all about a flexible\napproach to problem, to problem,\n\n88\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.070\nto project management,\neven not to problem management, and\n\n89\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.640\nyou'll see here we've got\na group of methodologies there.\n\n90\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.450\nAnd this is not a definitive list.\n&gt;&gt; Comprehensive list-\n\n91\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are lots and\n\n92\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.470\nlots of other methodologies that\nmay land themselves into Agile.\n\n93\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.720\nAgile basically means, well,\npretty much what it says, that it's agile,\n\n94\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.200\nit's flexible.\n\n95\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.360\nAnd it's really about delivering\nproduct in a continuous,\n\n96\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.230\ncontinual manner, that's what it's about.\n\n97\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.610\nIt's not a waterfall approach.\n\n98\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.972\nIf it was traditional waterfall\napproach to product delivery and\n\n99\n00:05:29.972 --> 00:05:35.440\nto project managements, then we have a set\ntime period, which is in our generally\n\n100\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.067\nsomewhere from six months to two, three\nyears even, I've seen projects last for,\n\n101\n00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:46.780\nwhere we start off at the beginning with\ndefining what it is that our users want.\n\n102\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.640\nAnd then we go through the entire build,\nand we go through the entire build in\n\n103\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.059\na very chronological way, and\nthen we start to, as we've developed,\n\n104\n00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:02.155\nwe then test, and then once we've tested,\nthen we deploy, and then once we deploy,\n\n105\n00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:07.935\nwe have a period of hand holding, and\nthen we walk away as a project team.\n\n106\n00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:09.881\nAnd that's it, that project is signed off.\n\n107\n00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:16.670\nWell, waterfall approach works very very\nwell for very large implementations,\n\n108\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.940\nbut you see, right at the very beginning\nis when we have that user interaction, and\n\n109\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.297\nthen they see nothing\npotentially until very end.\n\n110\n00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.830\nSo Agile looks at this slightly\ndifferently, and Agile will say well,\n\n111\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.860\nokay, we've got to build up momentum,\nwe've got to allow for\n\n112\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.920\nchange, which is something that waterfall\nprojects traditionally don't, and\n\n113\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.810\nwe've got to be visible.\n\n114\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.710\nBecause we've got to deliver\nvisible benefits, but\n\n115\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.320\nwe've got to deliver\nbenefits on a regular basis.\n\n116\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.150\nAnd the one thing that we\nknow is that things change.\n\n117\n00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.620\nI mean, if we started off,\ncan you imagine, just a complete aside,\n\n118\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.270\ncan you imagine if you've got a cell phone\nand then you had to wait three years\n\n119\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.775\npotentially for your next cell phone?\n&gt;&gt; Can I imagine it?\n\n120\n00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:01.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.380\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n122\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.280\nI try to get as much as\nI can out of my phones.\n\n123\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.781\nBut I'm probably an exception,\nI'm a little cheap when it comes to those.\n\n124\n00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.701\n&gt;&gt; Well, look, but okay..\n\n125\n00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:11.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.500\n&gt;&gt; You can be cheap when it comes to\n\n127\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.390\nthose, I can tell you now, right, by the\ntime the next one is announced next year,\n\n128\n00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.391\nI'm there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:19.345\n&gt;&gt; I am there!\n\n130\n00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:21.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, then I know who to come to.\n\n131\n00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.905\nI'll buy all your old phones.\n\n132\n00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:24.390\nHow about that, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n133\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.420\nImpatience, that's what this is,\nit's just complete impatience..\n\n134\n00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.640\nBut I'm hungry for the latest technology.\n\n135\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.220\nI'm hungry for new things,\nI want new features.\n\n136\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.940\nAnd I'm not the only one, by the way.\n&gt;&gt; I know, like I said,\n\n137\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.255\nI think here, in our environment I'm\nthe exception to that and that's because-\n\n138\n00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n139\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.060\n&gt;&gt; My budget, really.\n\n140\n00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.890\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'm not the only one,\n\n141\n00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.780\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna walk out of this studio\n\n143\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.399\nand ask everybody right now, and\nI'll tell you who's trying to.\n\n144\n00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:54.541\nYeah, I'm always hungry for\nnew technology.\n\n145\n00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:58.561\nAnd so are our users as well,\nand so is our organization.\n\n146\n00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:03.391\nAnd it's true to say, and I know that this\nis gonna sound a bit like a story sort of\n\n147\n00:08:03.391 --> 00:08:08.011\nthing, but it's true to say that Over\nthe past few years the rate of technology\n\n148\n00:08:08.011 --> 00:08:12.090\nchange, well, it's become more rapid,\nit has increased.\n\n149\n00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.669\nAnd so our organizations\nexpect more functionality, and\n\n150\n00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:19.917\nthey expect functionality to be\navailable to them when they want it.\n\n151\n00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:23.720\nAnd they expect it to be available now,\nnot in three years time.\n\n152\n00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.070\nIn three years time, or\nin two years time, even.\n\n153\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.530\nMy needs changed.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n154\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.400\nit's Moore's law.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n155\n00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.780\n&gt;&gt; And we've exceeded his predictions\n\n156\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.962\nyears ago.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n157\n00:08:34.962 --> 00:08:36.642\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:08:36.642 --> 00:08:39.100\n&gt;&gt; Agile allows for that, and\n\n159\n00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.050\nthat's why we have agile as an approach\nto project management, because with that\n\n160\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:50.300\ncontinuous delivery, then what we're\ndoing is we are delivering features.\n\n161\n00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.540\nSo we're giving our users what they\nwant in that point in time, but\n\n162\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.750\nalso we're allowing them to say, okay,\nI like that, but can I have it this way?\n\n163\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.240\nAnd when you think about\nthe way we get our cellphones,\n\n164\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:09.010\nthe way that for instance,\nthat's exactly how we do this now.\n\n165\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.940\nWe update our operating systems.\n\n166\n00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.975\nAnd we update our app.\n\n167\n00:09:11.975 --> 00:09:14.070\nSo probably a monthly basis.\n\n168\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.120\nAnd we expect to seeing new\nfunctionality when we do that.\n\n169\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.760\nAnd that's an Agile approach.\n\n170\n00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.840\nSo Agile is really sort of pragmatic.\n\n171\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.590\nAnd by pragmatic, I mean,\nit's kind of matter of fact.\n\n172\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.460\nIt's very, it's common sense.\n\n173\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.806\nAnd we just have to accept\nthe fact that things change.\n\n174\n00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:34.860\nAnd so we've got to adapt to that.\n\n175\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.490\nAnd we've got to be able\nto accommodate change.\n\n176\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.430\nWe've got to be able to accommodate\nchanging customer desires, and\n\n177\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.220\nchanging customer needs as well.\n\n178\n00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.080\nWhich is why we have to have\nthat flexible approach.\n\n179\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.980\nIt now is by all the reasons\nwe've just talked about.\n\n180\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.900\nIt's difficult to predict what a\ncustomer's going to want in a year's time.\n\n181\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.941\nThey don't have a year to wait.\n\n182\n00:09:57.941 --> 00:10:01.516\nSo we have to have what we\ncall a flexible approach\n\n183\n00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:06.280\nthat allows us to adapt as we learn or\nrather adapt as we grow.\n\n184\n00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.837\nAnd adapt as we move through\nthe project progresses.\n\n185\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.840\nNow, I also wanna bring into\nthe bottom bullet point there that\n\n186\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.950\nI've just mentioned\nabout self-organization.\n\n187\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.870\nWe talk about collaboration a lot in\nAgile, and self-organization is really,\n\n188\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.930\nreally key.\n\n189\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.202\nBecause self-organization is\nabout that collaboration,\n\n190\n00:10:27.202 --> 00:10:29.389\nit's about the team working together.\n\n191\n00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:32.088\nIt's not having a strict hierarchy and\n\n192\n00:10:32.088 --> 00:10:35.456\nit's also not being micro-managed,\nas well.\n\n193\n00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:38.160\nPeople don't perform well when\nthey're being micro-managed.\n\n194\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.910\nIf I've got somebody over\nmy shoulder the whole time.\n\n195\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.600\nAnd watching everything that I do,\nI'm not gonna perform particularly well.\n\n196\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.720\nBecause I'm gonna spend too much time\nworrying about what's being thought of me,\n\n197\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.060\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Right, and personally, I feel like for\n\n198\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.300\nme, and I feel like I've observed\nthis in numerous situations,\n\n199\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.610\nwhere the person that's not micromanaged.\n\n200\n00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.100\nIs going to give a little more.\n\n201\n00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.740\nA little bit extra than what they,\nif they have that freedom.\n\n202\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.630\nThan if they were micro managed.\n&gt;&gt; I want to bring\n\n203\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.190\ninto this conversation actually\nthe working from home.\n\n204\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.920\nThere's a big.\n\n205\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.852\nAnd this by the way,\nis kind of outside of Agile.\n\n206\n00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:19.606\nI'm gonna talk about\nthis in a little while.\n\n207\n00:11:19.606 --> 00:11:23.649\nWe'll talk about in another episode we'll\ntalk about teams and their location.\n\n208\n00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:29.710\nBut there is a misconception that working\nfrom home people actually do less.\n\n209\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.950\nWell guess what, people actually do\nmore when they're working from home.\n\n210\n00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:38.310\nWhen you're working in your office,\nyou come in and you will, you'll\n\n211\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.460\nit's almost like be in micromanage you\ncome in and you come in maybe 08:30 AM and\n\n212\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.670\nyou leave at 1630 or 1700 and\nyou do your day's work.\n\n213\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.570\nWhen you're working from home, sure,\nyou might take five minutes to go and put\n\n214\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.640\nthe washing machine on or to go and grab\nyourself some toast or make a cup tea.\n\n215\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.112\nI have been in the studio and\nthat okay [LAUGH].\n\n216\n00:11:59.112 --> 00:12:02.899\nAll right, you might grab five\nminutes here and there to do that.\n\n217\n00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:04.498\nBut when you are working from home and\n\n218\n00:12:04.498 --> 00:12:08.380\nyou hate your laptop because of the emails\nyou go and you will seat on your laptop.\n\n219\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.900\nAnd it doesn't matter what time of day or\nnight that is.\n\n220\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.930\nAnd I wonder,\nI know I am guilty of this as well.\n\n221\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.130\nI'll be sitting in front of the TV\non a night, checking my emails and\n\n222\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.870\nthings like that.\n\n223\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.670\nSo you're actually more productive\n\n224\n00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.330\nworking from home than you are when\nyou're in the office being micro managed.\n\n225\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.070\nAnd this is why we talk\nabout self-organization.\n\n226\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.750\nYou don't have to work between\nthe hours of eight and 1700.\n\n227\n00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.910\nYou work between the hours that\neverybody else in the team is working.\n\n228\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.390\nAnd if everyone else in the team, you\nknow, is decided that they want to have\n\n229\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.230\na meeting at 9:00 PM at night and that's\na good time for everybody then why not?\n\n230\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.140\nWe talk about self-organization and\nalso that collaboration means that we\n\n231\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.470\nunderstand where different\nskills lay as well.\n\n232\n00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.350\nYour skills are way more\ntechnical than my skills.\n\n233\n00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.853\nMy technical skills are in the dim and\ndistant past.\n\n234\n00:13:03.853 --> 00:13:08.869\nAnd so if I had something that was\nspecifically technical in an arena\n\n235\n00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:15.070\nthat you outperformed in, then I would\nask you if you would help with that.\n\n236\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.810\nBut in the same light, you know, and\n\n237\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.080\nhoping that you'd come to me if it was\nsomething else to do with governance or\n\n238\n00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.510\nstrategies or maybe something.\n&gt;&gt; Interpersonal skills\n\n239\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.920\nto help with my awkwardness.\n\n240\n00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.480\nBe like Joe what do you think?\n&gt;&gt; You know-\n\n241\n00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.500\n&gt;&gt; Should I leave the review?\n\n242\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.880\nThe five star review?\n\n243\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.190\nBe honest.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, I would.\n\n244\n00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.008\nI just need to inject a bit of Britishness\nthere, that's all it needs, right?\n\n245\n00:13:37.008 --> 00:13:41.340\nSay it as it is [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You know, but I've had this discussion\n\n246\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.471\nwith people before Joe, and I do think\nthat it's perfect for some people, but\n\n247\n00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:49.287\nthere are those people that I even\nknow personally that they say, look,\n\n248\n00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:52.252\nI don't have the self discipline,\nI kind of need that.\n\n249\n00:13:52.252 --> 00:13:56.349\nSo I think also you have to be honest with\nyourself when your thinking about this\n\n250\n00:13:56.349 --> 00:13:57.630\ntoo.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n251\n00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.328\nI mean some people,\nif they're left to organize themselves,\n\n252\n00:14:01.328 --> 00:14:03.718\nyou'll find that they'll do nothing.\n\n253\n00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:07.140\nAnd you'll get others in the team\nthat will do all of the work.\n\n254\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.370\nYes, there has to be somebody, but\nthen that's why we have a scrum master.\n\n255\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.430\nThat is exactly what\nthe scrum masters role it is.\n\n256\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.670\nTo make sure even though,\n\n257\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.530\nyou are kind of left to your own devices,\nthe work is still being produced and\n\n258\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.520\nthat is exactly why we still have\npeople though in a leadership role.\n\n259\n00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.080\nBut these\n\n260\n00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.820\npeople shouldn't be micromanaging.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n261\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.578\n&gt;&gt; So let's just\n\n262\n00:14:28.578 --> 00:14:30.730\ntake a quick recap then if that's okay.\n\n263\n00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.280\nOver the Agile Manifesto and\njust really what that means and\n\n264\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.690\nwhat it is that we are working towards?\n\n265\n00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.680\nThe Agile Manifesto,\nI like to call them ethics.\n\n266\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.237\nWe officially call them values,\nbut I like to call them ethics.\n\n267\n00:14:45.237 --> 00:14:51.240\nAnd it really is just looking at\nwhere we're focusing our efforts.\n\n268\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.720\nWhere we're focusing, or\nwhere we put value, really.\n\n269\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.610\nAnd we put value over individuals,\ninteractions, over processes and tools.\n\n270\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.380\nNow forget the myth that in Agile we\ndon't have any processes, because we do.\n\n271\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:11.070\nBut that processes should be efficient,\nand they should also be flexible as well.\n\n272\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.990\nWhen we bring in a tool,\nthe tool should facilitate the process.\n\n273\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.740\nYou don't change your process\nto accommodate your tool.\n\n274\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.630\nAgain, something that I see all the time.\n\n275\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.410\nWe're all aboard on this tool, and\nthis tool's gonna fix everything.\n\n276\n00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.240\nNo, it's not, absolutely not.\n\n277\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.840\nThe tool has to be able to deliver\nthe process that you want it to deliver.\n\n278\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.090\nYou have to buy a tool in order to\nuse it as that particular tool.\n\n279\n00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.930\nYou wouldn't buy a rubber hammer or\n\n280\n00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.190\na mallet to knock a nail into the wall,\nright?\n\n281\n00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.770\nYou have to work out what you\nwant first and then you go and\n\n282\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.760\nbuy the appropriate tool.\n\n283\n00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.075\nYou don't go buy the tool and think, well\nokay, now I need to find some rubber nails\n\n284\n00:15:57.075 --> 00:15:59.470\ncuz it's the only thing that's\ngonna knock you to the wall, right?\n\n285\n00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.064\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:16:00.064 --> 00:16:01.843\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n287\n00:16:01.843 --> 00:16:02.851\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n288\n00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:07.340\nI'm corporal when it comes to, I feel\nlike I've seen a rubber hammer before but\n\n289\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.086\nit might be for like precious.\n\n290\n00:16:09.086 --> 00:16:10.507\nSurfaces.\n\n291\n00:16:10.507 --> 00:16:11.083\n&gt;&gt; Mallet.\n\n292\n00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:12.136\n&gt;&gt; Mallet?\n&gt;&gt; Camping.\n\n293\n00:16:12.136 --> 00:16:12.712\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n294\n00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:14.017\n&gt;&gt; Camping, hammering pegs into\n\n295\n00:16:14.017 --> 00:16:15.400\nthe ground.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n296\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.732\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] been camping, clearly.\n\n297\n00:16:17.732 --> 00:16:20.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've been camping but\n\n298\n00:16:20.075 --> 00:16:22.396\nI prefer to glamp now.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n299\n00:16:22.396 --> 00:16:26.845\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why doesn't that surprise me?\n\n300\n00:16:26.845 --> 00:16:28.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:29.479\n&gt;&gt; Any who.\n\n302\n00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:30.695\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n303\n00:16:30.695 --> 00:16:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Product owner, Agile.\n\n304\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n305\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.310\nSo, tools.\n\n306\n00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.710\nBuy the right tools for the job.\n\n307\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:36.816\nAnd if you're glamping,\n\n308\n00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:38.274\njust forget it really.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:16:38.274 --> 00:16:40.034\n&gt;&gt; You don't need anything at\n\n310\n00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:42.440\nthat point in time [LAUGH].\n\n311\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.843\nOur processes have to be efficient.\n\n312\n00:16:46.843 --> 00:16:50.690\nThat's not to say we don't want them,\nthey just have to be efficient.\n\n313\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.180\nBut we value individuals,\n\n314\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.300\nwe value the way that they work,\nover our processes and over those tools.\n\n315\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.440\nBecause sometimes we just end up with the\nwrong tools and that's not what we want.\n\n316\n00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.410\nSo value people, value their skills,\nvalue their interactions.\n\n317\n00:17:09.348 --> 00:17:12.770\nAnd we're focusing on efficiency here,\n\n318\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:18.960\nI don't want you to spend your\nentire day filling out paperwork.\n\n319\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.910\nWhat I want you to do is to be productive\nfor your entire day, and filling out\n\n320\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.770\npaperwork and documentation does not\nmean that you're a productive person\n\n321\n00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.220\nbecause you're going to be developing\nnothing over that period in time.\n\n322\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.870\nYou're just going to be\nfilling out paperwork.\n\n323\n00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.070\nAnd again, let's look at the next one,\n\n324\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.350\nworking software over\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n325\n00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.360\nIt's not that we don't want documentation,\nbut we want to keep it simple, and\n\n326\n00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.970\nwe want to keep it relevant.\n\n327\n00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:46.180\nWe are the worst in IT at producing\ndocumentation, just for the sake of\n\n328\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.660\ndocumentation, just because we can and\nthat's not what we do in here in Agile.\n\n329\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:58.575\nNow, I like this one as well,\nthis one really hammers it home.\n\n330\n00:17:58.575 --> 00:18:03.252\nHow many times have you taken a look\nat a contract or an agreement, and\n\n331\n00:18:03.252 --> 00:18:08.589\nsaid well it's not in that agreement,\nso I'm not going to do that, right?\n\n332\n00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:13.800\nWe value customer collaboration\nover contract negotiation.\n\n333\n00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.170\nIt's not about what's\nwritten on a piece of paper,\n\n334\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.000\nit's about having a relationship\nwith your customer.\n\n335\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.780\nI don't care what's written in that piece\nof paper, what I actually want is for\n\n336\n00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.660\nus to be able to work together as a team.\n\n337\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.730\nNow, Cherokee, you had a situation quite\nrecently, where you were expecting\n\n338\n00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.430\nsomething to be delivered, and\nit says in the piece of paper,\n\n339\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.820\nright, well, it's going to be\ndelivered between this time and\n\n340\n00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.900\nsomebody's going to call you at this time.\n\n341\n00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.330\nAnd this is exactly what's in\nthe contract, but at the end of the day\n\n342\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.210\nwhat's in the contract doesn't\ndeliver good customer service,\n\n343\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.300\nit doesn't deliver a good product.\n\n344\n00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.800\nIt's the attitude,\n\n345\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.110\nit is the performance of the person\nwhen they eventually get there.\n\n346\n00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.070\nIt is how helpful they are, and\n\n347\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.510\nhow willing they are to work with you and\nyour schedules.\n\n348\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.563\nThat's what delivers value.\n\n349\n00:19:04.563 --> 00:19:08.220\nIt's not what's written in the contract\nthat delivers value, right?\n\n350\n00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.938\nSo again we'll always say build\na relationship with your customer and\n\n351\n00:19:11.938 --> 00:19:14.340\nbuild a relationship with your colleagues.\n\n352\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.220\nThat's most more valuable than\nhaving something written down.\n\n353\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.670\nIf you have something written down and\nyou're sticking to it rigidly then you\n\n354\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.070\nare not gonna be the only person\nwho is sticking to it rigidly and\n\n355\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.100\nthere is no flexibility there at all.\n\n356\n00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.740\nAnd then responding to change\nover following a plan.\n\n357\n00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:39.570\nWe value responding to change more than\nthe plan itself, because change happens.\n\n358\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.160\nAnd a plan is only ever as\ngood as the next few hours, or\n\n359\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.890\nmaybe the next few weeks.\n\n360\n00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.520\nBecause our circumstances change.\n\n361\n00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.960\nI've already mentioned,\nwe're in the 21st century now.\n\n362\n00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.410\nAnd things change in the 21st\ncentury very, very quickly.\n\n363\n00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.840\nAnd we've gotta be able\nto accommodate that.\n\n364\n00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:02.136\nSo these values were based on our\nAgile Manifesto, or our principles rather.\n\n365\n00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:06.278\nThe values of the manifesto,\nthese were based on our principles.\n\n366\n00:20:06.278 --> 00:20:10.980\nAnd we spent a lot of time going over\nthese in our fundamental series so\n\n367\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.520\nI really just wanna really just\nhighlight these to you right now and\n\n368\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.700\nI just wanna highlight what's in\npurple right now, if you want to\n\n369\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.320\nunderstand a little bit more,\ntake a look at our fundamental series.\n\n370\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.370\nBut we're looking at satisfying\nthe customer, we're looking at changing\n\n371\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.980\nrequirements, adapting to change, and\ndelivering software on an iterative basis.\n\n372\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.120\nA repeatable basis, frequently.\n\n373\n00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.600\nWe're looking at collaboration, working\ntogether, and we want people motivated.\n\n374\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.120\nAnd that's another reason why you\ndon't want to stick to contracts.\n\n375\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.471\nYou don't want to have to micro-manage.\n\n376\n00:20:44.471 --> 00:20:46.896\nBecause if you're micro-managing them and\n\n377\n00:20:46.896 --> 00:20:50.992\nyou're making them stick to contracts\nthey're not going to be motivated.\n\n378\n00:20:50.992 --> 00:20:54.145\nAnd they're certainly\nnot gonna give you 100%.\n\n379\n00:20:54.145 --> 00:20:59.080\nI like the bottom one,\nface to face conversation.\n\n380\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.160\nIt goes back to we don't want\nthe comprehensive documentation.\n\n381\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.240\nDocumentation's gotta be relavant,\nbut it's got to be clear, concise and\n\n382\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.630\nunambiguous.\n\n383\n00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:09.960\nBut you know what?\n\n384\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.530\nI perceive more value in\na face to face conversation.\n\n385\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.660\nI can get more out of you in\na face to face conversation\n\n386\n00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.500\nbecause I see your body language,\nI understand what you're thinking.\n\n387\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.834\nWell, maybe not, all right.\n&gt;&gt; I might not be the best candidate for\n\n388\n00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:25.364\nthis.\n\n389\n00:21:25.364 --> 00:21:27.542\n[LAUGH] Poor Jo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:31.550\nOkay, maybe I don't quite understand, but\nI get to see your body language right?\n\n391\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.380\nAnd I get to sort of follow\nalong with where you're going.\n\n392\n00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.900\nFace to face conversation delivers\nmore results than a string of emails.\n\n393\n00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.452\nThat email tennis that sometimes play\nwith the backwards and forwards and\n\n394\n00:21:45.452 --> 00:21:51.330\nit's please no, pick up the phone or\nlet's have a face to face conversation.\n\n395\n00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:55.528\nIn ITIL terms, not Agile, in ITIL terms,\n\n396\n00:21:55.528 --> 00:21:59.971\nI refer to it as getting off your bum,\nright?\n\n397\n00:21:59.971 --> 00:22:02.490\nSo get off your bum, go and\nsee what's happening.\n\n398\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.800\nThey call it observing directly but\nI like to say just get off your bum.\n\n399\n00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:11.010\nGo see, you'll achieve a lot\nmore by doing it that way.\n\n400\n00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:15.640\nAnd then working software,\nworking software is what we want, and\n\n401\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.330\nwe want sustainable development.\n\n402\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:23.730\nSo what we want to achieve is development\nthat is sustained over a period of time.\n\n403\n00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.900\nWhat we don't want is development here,\nand then nothing for\n\n404\n00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.630\nanother six months, and\nthen it all goes quiet again, and\n\n405\n00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.750\nthen maybe four months later\nwe'll deliver something.\n\n406\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.420\nWe want sustainable development.\n\n407\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.218\nWe want technical excellence and\nwe want good design.\n\n408\n00:22:41.218 --> 00:22:44.271\nIf you get it right in\nthe first place and, in fact,\n\n409\n00:22:44.271 --> 00:22:48.764\njust before our episode today I was\ntalking about this with Zach actually.\n\n410\n00:22:48.764 --> 00:22:53.790\nIf you get it right in the first place,\nthen you don't have to make changes.\n\n411\n00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:59.330\nWe've had in previous series, where we've\nlooked at sort of both Agile and ITIL,\n\n412\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.060\nwe've talked about the question about how\ndo you know if somebody's color blind?\n\n413\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.770\nOkay, all right, I know you're thinking to\nyourself, what's that got to do with it?\n\n414\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.690\nIf we're designing a service, you have\nto understand who your user is, and\n\n415\n00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.350\nwe'll come into that in\nan episode a little bit later.\n\n416\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.550\nBut you have to understand\nwho your user is.\n\n417\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.240\nIf you don't know who your user is and\nyou don't know how they work,\n\n418\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.890\nthen how can you ensure that you design\na service that fits their needs?\n\n419\n00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.470\nWhat you'll do is you'll\ndesign what you think is good,\n\n420\n00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.850\nbut then it won't deliver quality.\n\n421\n00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.961\nIt won't be a good design.\n\n422\n00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:39.810\nYou have to get to know your user first.\n\n423\n00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:44.175\nAnd you deliver, in number ten,\nwhat you need to deliver.\n\n424\n00:23:44.175 --> 00:23:51.060\nNothing else talks about\nmaximizing the work not done.\n\n425\n00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.711\nStop trying to over-deliver and just\nremember that anything that you deliver\n\n426\n00:23:55.711 --> 00:24:00.225\nover and above what you promised is\nprobably superfluous to requirements.\n\n427\n00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:03.860\nIt's probably not gonna get used and\nit's a wasted effort.\n\n428\n00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.277\nAnd we've already talk about\nself-organizing teams.\n\n429\n00:24:07.277 --> 00:24:11.428\nAnd I also want to bring in number\n12 there about team reflection, and\n\n430\n00:24:11.428 --> 00:24:14.487\nabout getting the team\ntogether on a regular basis.\n\n431\n00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:18.318\nWe'll talk about daily stand ups\na little bit later in another episode.\n\n432\n00:24:18.318 --> 00:24:24.342\nBut having our team look back at the end\nof the day on how things have handout and\n\n433\n00:24:24.342 --> 00:24:27.039\nwhat's actually being achieve.\n\n434\n00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:30.819\nAnd then what we could\ndo better next time.\n\n435\n00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:36.787\nSo as 3 pillars of Agile and again,\ngo back to fundamentals series and\n\n436\n00:24:36.787 --> 00:24:40.745\nyou'll find that this\nbeen explained to you.\n\n437\n00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:45.854\nAs 3 pillars of Agile\ntransparency inspection and\n\n438\n00:24:45.854 --> 00:24:51.808\nadaptation, you get what you\ninspect not what you expect.\n\n439\n00:24:51.808 --> 00:24:55.034\nGo and see it goes back again\nto getting off your bum and\n\n440\n00:24:55.034 --> 00:24:57.053\ngoing to see what's happening.\n\n441\n00:24:57.053 --> 00:24:59.977\nAnd so\nwe wanna ensure that we are transparent,\n\n442\n00:24:59.977 --> 00:25:03.130\nthat our entire development\nteam is transparent.\n\n443\n00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.757\nNow from a product owner's\nperspective that's very important.\n\n444\n00:25:06.757 --> 00:25:10.501\nBecause the product owner is the person\nthat is responsible for the product.\n\n445\n00:25:10.501 --> 00:25:14.591\nAnd so therefore they have got to\nmake sure that the team is actually\n\n446\n00:25:14.591 --> 00:25:17.965\ndelivering what they're\nsupposed to be delivering.\n\n447\n00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:23.191\nAnd so transparency is really important\nfor a product manager, product owner.\n\n448\n00:25:23.191 --> 00:25:27.298\nBecause the product owner has go to\nsee what is being developed, and\n\n449\n00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:29.904\nhas got to make adjustments if necessary.\n\n450\n00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:33.405\nBear it in mind that with each iteration,\n\n451\n00:25:33.405 --> 00:25:37.720\nwith each sprint you've\nonly got up to four weeks.\n\n452\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.242\nThere's some Agile myths here and\nwe've already really covered those,\n\n453\n00:25:41.242 --> 00:25:45.121\nabout Agile doesn't require documentation\nand it doesn't require planning.\n\n454\n00:25:45.121 --> 00:25:49.226\nYes it does, just keep it simple.\n\n455\n00:25:49.226 --> 00:25:53.358\nUser stories, we're going to get into\nuser stories in a later episode but no,\n\n456\n00:25:53.358 --> 00:25:55.375\nthis shouldn't all be the same size.\n\n457\n00:25:55.375 --> 00:25:59.697\nEvery single user story is going to\nbe different and it should be unique.\n\n458\n00:25:59.697 --> 00:26:03.842\nWhich means that every single sprint\nis going to be a different length.\n\n459\n00:26:03.842 --> 00:26:08.516\nWe say between one and four weeks for\nevery single sprint but\n\n460\n00:26:08.516 --> 00:26:12.455\nit could be one week and\nit could be for one sprint.\n\n461\n00:26:12.455 --> 00:26:17.126\nAnd the next one could be four weeks, and\nthen the next one could be two weeks.\n\n462\n00:26:17.126 --> 00:26:19.449\nThat's down to the scrum master to manage,\nbut\n\n463\n00:26:19.449 --> 00:26:22.886\nthe product owner's the person that\ndecides what goes in the sprint.\n\n464\n00:26:22.886 --> 00:26:26.036\nAll we know is,\nthat whatever goes in the sprint,\n\n465\n00:26:26.036 --> 00:26:29.647\nwe've gotta be able to achieve\nthat in that time period.\n\n466\n00:26:29.647 --> 00:26:33.737\nWhatever the time period is,\nit's got to be achievable.\n\n467\n00:26:33.737 --> 00:26:38.349\nAnd here on this particular\nslide you've got an overview of\n\n468\n00:26:38.349 --> 00:26:40.386\nan actual sprint itself.\n\n469\n00:26:40.386 --> 00:26:46.168\nAnd you will see that the product owner is\nthe person that prioritizes the backlog,\n\n470\n00:26:46.168 --> 00:26:47.167\nthen we plan.\n\n471\n00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:50.211\nAnd the team then actually starts\nto do the development work.\n\n472\n00:26:50.211 --> 00:26:53.231\nAnd every day we have\nour daily scrum meeting.\n\n473\n00:26:53.231 --> 00:26:56.893\nAnd we also at the end of\nthe sprint well we'll do a review.\n\n474\n00:26:56.893 --> 00:27:02.030\nAnd we'll complete the sprint itself and\nthen we will either release at\n\n475\n00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:07.602\nthat point in time or we'll not we'll\nshelve that until the actual release.\n\n476\n00:27:07.602 --> 00:27:11.039\nAnd we do the retrospective,\nwe look back and we see what's gone wrong.\n\n477\n00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:14.799\nAnd when right and\nwe apply that to our next point.\n\n478\n00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:19.665\nSo in out next episodes then what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to expand\n\n479\n00:27:19.665 --> 00:27:20.990\nthose activities.\n\n480\n00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.673\nThe activities of the product\nowner actually completes and\n\n481\n00:27:24.673 --> 00:27:26.742\nthat they're responsible for.\n\n482\n00:27:26.742 --> 00:27:29.953\nAnd hopefully we'll see you\nback in the next episode.\n\n483\n00:27:29.953 --> 00:27:31.653\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you for that overview and\n\n484\n00:27:31.653 --> 00:27:34.963\nintroduction into our series here Jo,\nand thank you for joining us as well.\n\n485\n00:27:34.963 --> 00:27:38.127\nBut for now we'll sign out,\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n486\n00:27:38.127 --> 00:27:39.039\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n487\n00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:41.847\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:09.303\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n4\n00:00:09.303 --> 00:00:12.998\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone\n\n5\n00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:15.720\nto our Agile Roles Product Owner series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.620\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.780\nAnd ironically enough,\n\n8\n00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.430\nin this episode we're going to\nbe looking at the product owner.\n\n9\n00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.500\nAnd of course, with us today back\nin studios we have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.450\nHow's it going, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.086\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing just wonderful, thanks for\n\n12\n00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:32.603\nasking.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n13\n00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:35.410\nwhy is that ironic?\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n14\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.100\nit is what it is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.150\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly what we\n\n16\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.888\nsaid we would be covering, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n17\n00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:40.810\nIt is, yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.490\nIn this particular episode, exactly what\nCherokee's just said, we are actually\n\n19\n00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.670\nlooking at the roles and responsibilities\nof the product owner themselves.\n\n20\n00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.150\nSo we're actually gonna be looking\nat the characteristics of a product\n\n21\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.520\nowner as well.\n\n22\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.340\nAnd who a product owner should be, and\n\n23\n00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.230\nwhat they should be doing.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n24\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.140\n&gt;&gt; So I guess we'll get started then,\n\n25\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.310\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan.\n\n26\n00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.380\n&gt;&gt; What do you think of then?\n\n27\n00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.750\nSo I'm gonna be asking you quite\na few questions during this, so-\n\n28\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.394\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be\n\n29\n00:01:07.394 --> 00:01:08.190\na doozy, I think.\n\n30\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I can feel it.\n\n31\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what a product owner\n\n32\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.520\nshould do, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n33\n00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.072\n&gt;&gt; Or at least we think we\n\n34\n00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.200\nknow what a product owner should do.\n&gt;&gt; I think I know, yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.733\n&gt;&gt; So who do you think\n\n36\n00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:20.290\nshould be a product owner?\n&gt;&gt; Like their characteristics?\n\n37\n00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.220\nYou just mentioned, so\n\n38\n00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.420\nwhat kind of characteristics, or-\n\n39\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.957\n&gt;&gt; No, who-\n&gt;&gt; Who specifically.\n\n40\n00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:23.700\n&gt;&gt; Who specifically, yeah.\n\n41\n00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.644\nWho do you think should do it?\n&gt;&gt; I think it should be-\n\n42\n00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:29.413\n&gt;&gt; Should be a project manager?\n\n43\n00:01:29.413 --> 00:01:31.402\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n44\n00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:31.958\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n45\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:32.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\n\n46\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.410\nI think that a product owner should\nbe someone who knows the products.\n\n47\n00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.564\nSomeone who may have\nsome kind of loyalty or\n\n48\n00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:48.060\ndeep-seated interest in the product.\n&gt;&gt; Do they need to be a technical person?\n\n49\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.041\n&gt;&gt; I think so,\n\n50\n00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:49.634\nyeah.\n\n51\n00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:50.966\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n52\n00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n53\n00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:53.850\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n54\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.678\n&gt;&gt; No no.\n\n55\n00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:55.193\n&gt;&gt; Well, how-\n\n56\n00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:55.797\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n57\n00:01:55.797 --> 00:01:56.466\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n58\n00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.710\n&gt;&gt; No, it should be somebody who is\n\n59\n00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.450\nempowered to own the product because it\nsays that there on behalf of the company.\n\n60\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.600\nIn other words,\nit doesn't have to be a technical person.\n\n61\n00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.560\nIt's somebody who is, and\nwe'll look in some subsequent episodes,\n\n62\n00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.060\nwe'll look at user stories and\nwe'll look at defining user stories.\n\n63\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.010\nIt's somebody who makes a decision as\nto what the product should look like,\n\n64\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.150\nand to what functionality\nshould be included and\n\n65\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.370\nwhat functionality is excluded, and\nwhat are their priorities like, etc.\n\n66\n00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.630\nSo it doesn't necessarily have\nto be a technical person.\n\n67\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.642\nAnd in fact,\nthere is a danger if we bring in\n\n68\n00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:37.380\na technical person.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna have to explain\n\n69\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.020\nthis one to me.\n\n70\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.625\nI don't see what could\n\n71\n00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:42.065\nbe wrong with being a technical person.\n\n72\n00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:42.635\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n73\n00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:44.095\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look.\n\n74\n00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:45.555\n&gt;&gt; I'm a biased at all so.\n\n75\n00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:46.843\n&gt;&gt; I wish we could do a rerun,\n\n76\n00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:47.455\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:49.205\n&gt;&gt; We did an episode not all that long\n\n78\n00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:53.775\nago, we did this episode on,\nit was on Agile.\n\n79\n00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:58.385\nAnd I asked you, and\nI've done this episode with you before,\n\n80\n00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:02.245\nI've done something similar with you\nbefore where I've asked you to tell me how\n\n81\n00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:03.980\nyou send an email.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n82\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.190\n&gt;&gt; How would you send an email, Cherokee?\n\n83\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\n\n84\n00:03:08.795 --> 00:03:12.481\nif you don't know how to send an email,\nor you haven't seen the last few shows,\n\n85\n00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:15.014\nor the other shows we've done, so-\n&gt;&gt; Just give me the same answer that you\n\n86\n00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:16.960\nnormally [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; The same answer.\n\n87\n00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.130\nI would basically just say that I'm gonna\ngo ahead and fire up my email application,\n\n88\n00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.440\nlook for that Compose Message, fill in\nthe Sender line, fill in my message.\n\n89\n00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.950\nHit Send and just go on with my merry day.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, that's Cherokee's answer.\n\n90\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.530\nAnd so what Cherokee is saying there is\nthat she, like she said, she's just gonna\n\n91\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.870\nopen up email, she's gonna type in\nan email, and then she's gonna press Send.\n\n92\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.450\nBut that's great.\n\n93\n00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.960\nNow, we've got a problem with this though,\nhaven't we?\n\n94\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.214\nIt is a huge amount of assumptions in\n\n95\n00:03:50.214 --> 00:03:50.967\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n96\n00:03:50.967 --> 00:03:52.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A huge amount of assumptions.\n\n97\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.180\nAnd the thing is that if Cherokee's\ntalking to another person in IT,\n\n98\n00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.700\nthey're probably going to\nassume exactly the same thing.\n\n99\n00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.440\nAnd so two IT people talking together\nwill talk the same language.\n\n100\n00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.990\nAn IT person and\n\n101\n00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.470\na business person however,\ntalk a completely different language.\n\n102\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.411\nSo what I wanna know then, as a business\nperson, is I wanna send an email, and I've\n\n103\n00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:24.060\njust opened up my laptop, what do I do?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n104\n00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.040\n&gt;&gt; And Cherokee says to me well,\n\n105\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.710\nfind your email.\n\n106\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.670\nWhich one's my email?\n&gt;&gt; No, seriously,\n\n107\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.495\nand even being in education or\nin training, and I have to\n\n108\n00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:40.280\npay attention to that, because I've\nhad a situation where I had a student.\n\n109\n00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.945\nThis was years ago, but\nway before touch screens were a thing,\n\n110\n00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:48.645\nand one of my students, I said,\nyou gotta click on the icon.\n\n111\n00:04:48.645 --> 00:04:50.455\nAnd they were literally\nclicking on the screen.\n\n112\n00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:50.985\n&gt;&gt; Pressing the screen, yeah.\n\n113\n00:04:50.985 --> 00:04:51.685\n&gt;&gt; And this was, like i said,\n\n114\n00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:58.087\nway before touch screens or even a little\nidea, so you can't take that for\n\n115\n00:04:58.087 --> 00:05:03.367\ngranted, and I do sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is typical of IT.\n\n116\n00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:06.887\nAnd so you'll get the questions\nabout well, which one's my email?\n\n117\n00:05:06.887 --> 00:05:11.058\nAnd you said click on my email,\nor I load or\n\n118\n00:05:11.058 --> 00:05:15.200\nfire up my email, how do I do that?\n\n119\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.700\nHow do I fire up?\n\n120\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.810\nWhat does fire up mean?\n\n121\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.970\nI click on my email icon, how many times?\n\n122\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.874\nI know people that will click,\nclick, click, click, click, click,\n\n123\n00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:26.220\nclick until something happens.\n\n124\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.460\nBy which time they've opened so\n\n125\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.200\nmany clicks that they've sent 15\nemails and haven't even realized it.\n\n126\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.993\nAnd they don't know who to.\n&gt;&gt; We call that getting click happy.\n\n127\n00:05:35.993 --> 00:05:36.979\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n128\n00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:37.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.370\n&gt;&gt; The fact is that an IT person can not,\n\n130\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.670\nthey find it very, very difficult,\nand invariably they can not articulate\n\n131\n00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.699\nall of those, we call them the moments of\ntruth, the entire customer experience.\n\n132\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.150\nAnd so having that very technical person\nin the role of the product owner leads to,\n\n133\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.912\nI wouldn't say mistakes, but\nI would definitely say misinterpretation.\n\n134\n00:06:04.912 --> 00:06:09.720\nIt leads to assumptions, And\n\n135\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.440\nit leads to users not being able to use\nthe product in the way that they want to,\n\n136\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.510\nor not being able to make\nthe best use of the product.\n\n137\n00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.200\nPut it that way, okay.\n\n138\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.140\nSo having somebody technical is\nnot necessarily the best idea.\n\n139\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.850\nAnd yet, we do that quite often.\n\n140\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.750\nWe'll have somebody technical in that\nrole of product owner because we think\n\n141\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.130\nthey need to be a programmer.\n\n142\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.520\nBut they don't.\n\n143\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.700\nWhat they need to be able to do is they\nneed to be able to interpret what you've\n\n144\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.620\njust said and put it into a way that they\ncan then give it to the programmer and\n\n145\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.940\nsay you have to do it this way.\n\n146\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.500\nBecause this is how the user works.\n\n147\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.210\nSo the product owner is not\nnecessarily a technical person.\n\n148\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.990\nAnd in fact, I'd rather they\nweren't a technical person.\n\n149\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.580\nThat's quite controversial, isn't it?\n\n150\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.350\nThey're responsible for\nthe product's success ultimately, but\n\n151\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.880\nit's quite controversial to say that\nactually the person that's responsible for\n\n152\n00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.510\nwhat we're delivering has\nnothing to do with IT.\n\n153\n00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.970\nI'm not saying they shouldn't\nhave anything to do with IT, but\n\n154\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.140\nwhat I'm saying is the-\n&gt;&gt; Well, ultimately, and my thinking\n\n155\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.550\nis just because if they're responsible for\nit, and push comes to shove, and\n\n156\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.630\nyou're nearing, encroaching that deadline.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n157\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.260\n&gt;&gt; How am I going to garner or\n\n158\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.220\ngain years worth of\nexperience in four weeks?\n\n159\n00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.920\nOr at that point in time,\nit's probably a lot less\n\n160\n00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.400\nif you're coming up to that deadline, so.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n161\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.110\nyou mentioned about\ncoming up to a deadline.\n\n162\n00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.378\nAnd it's funny because when\nyou've got a deadline like that,\n\n163\n00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:45.725\nyou want somebody as a product\nowner who is able to say all right,\n\n164\n00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:49.931\nwe still need this program, so\nI need these people to do that.\n\n165\n00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:50.680\nOr do we?\n\n166\n00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.300\nBecause actually,\nwhose job is it to say that?\n\n167\n00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.742\nBe a Scrum Master.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so\n\n168\n00:07:58.742 --> 00:08:03.580\nyour Scrum Master needs to\nbe able to manage the team.\n\n169\n00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.140\nAnd your Scrum Master needs to be able\nto understand what the team is doing.\n\n170\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.410\nBut the product owner doesn't necessarily\n\n171\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:16.030\nhave to know who's got what skills,\nand what is technically possible.\n\n172\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.065\nThe product owner makes the decisions.\n\n173\n00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:22.291\nIt's quite a controversial statement and\n\n174\n00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:26.615\nit's usually at this point in time when\nyou're in a classroom and everybody goes,\n\n175\n00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:27.291\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:29.230\n&gt;&gt; There's a new one, but yeah.\n\n177\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.550\nSo, the product owner\nthen is the person that,\n\n178\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.900\nwell, would define the product itself.\n\n179\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.030\nThey take responsibility for\nthe success and\n\n180\n00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.930\nthey define the vision of the product,\nexactly what the product should do.\n\n181\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:49.558\nAnd then they develop the roadmap for\nthe product delivery.\n\n182\n00:08:49.558 --> 00:08:54.024\nAnd they are the person that will\nmake the decision as to what user\n\n183\n00:08:54.024 --> 00:08:58.998\nstories are the most important,\nwhich ones get the highest priority.\n\n184\n00:08:58.998 --> 00:09:03.845\nAnd so they will work with the Scrum\nMaster to divide up the user stories\n\n185\n00:09:03.845 --> 00:09:04.920\ninto sprints.\n\n186\n00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.063\nSo that we have enough stories in each\nsprint to be able to keep us busy for\n\n187\n00:09:10.063 --> 00:09:14.626\nthe duration of that sprint, but\nwe don't try and do too much.\n\n188\n00:09:14.626 --> 00:09:17.949\nBecause again that's something\nthat we're quite often\n\n189\n00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:21.850\nguilty of is overestimating\nour competence as it were.\n\n190\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.630\nI'm not saying that we're incompetent, but\nwe've got to remember that there's gotta\n\n191\n00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.130\nbe time for testing, and\nwe've looked at that in a separate series.\n\n192\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:34.600\nSo, the product owner\nunderstands each user story,\n\n193\n00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.940\nwhich is an item in the backlog,\nit's a user story and it's business value.\n\n194\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.838\nI wonder how many technical people\nunderstand the business value of any\n\n195\n00:09:44.838 --> 00:09:45.744\nuser story.\n\n196\n00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:51.530\nAgain, this is why they don't\nnecessarily have to be an IT person.\n\n197\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.370\nThey don't necessarily have\nto be a technical person.\n\n198\n00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.150\nThey work with the development team but\nthey don't have to be a developer.\n\n199\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.930\nThey're managing stakeholder needs,\nthey're managing their expectations.\n\n200\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:12.177\nThey need to understand what it is that\nwe're developing, and they need to be able\n\n201\n00:10:12.177 --> 00:10:17.445\nto articulate this to the business and\nthen articulate it to other stakeholders.\n\n202\n00:10:17.445 --> 00:10:20.089\nThese are my priorities,\nhave I got them right?\n\n203\n00:10:20.089 --> 00:10:22.980\nThis is what you need developing first,\nright?\n\n204\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.550\nBut then the Scrum Master is the person\nthat actually manages the team and\n\n205\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.820\nmakes sure we've got the right level\nof skills to be able to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.417\nThere's only one product owner for\nany project, and\n\n207\n00:10:36.417 --> 00:10:41.684\nthat product owner is the person\nthat's responsible for\n\n208\n00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:45.868\nall of the user's stories for\nthat project.\n\n209\n00:10:45.868 --> 00:10:50.737\nSo you might have 100 user stories,\nyou might have just 20 user stories.\n\n210\n00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:52.105\nIt depends on the project and\n\n211\n00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:55.350\ndepends on what the project is\nactually trying to deliver.\n\n212\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:11:01.245\nBut that product owner, that one product\nowner is responsible for that product,\n\n213\n00:11:01.245 --> 00:11:06.124\nand therefore for that project,\nfor the duration of that project.\n\n214\n00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:09.874\nSo now that we've sort\nof revealed [LAUGH],\n\n215\n00:11:09.874 --> 00:11:11.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n216\n00:11:11.558 --> 00:11:13.896\n&gt;&gt; Who our product owner should be, and\n\n217\n00:11:13.896 --> 00:11:17.366\nnot necessarily the first\nperson that you thought of,\n\n218\n00:11:17.366 --> 00:11:20.393\nlet's take a look at what they do.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n219\n00:11:20.393 --> 00:11:21.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n220\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.328\n&gt;&gt; So, what they do,\n\n221\n00:11:22.328 --> 00:11:26.829\nwell we've already said this, they\nare responsible for the product vision.\n\n222\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.710\nAnd we've already mentioned that they have\nto collaborate with the stakeholders and\n\n223\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.580\nthey have to articular\nstakeholder expectations.\n\n224\n00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.190\nThat means though, that does mean that\neven though we'll say it should be\n\n225\n00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.210\na business leader, they have to be\nable to communicate with the business.\n\n226\n00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.200\nThey also have to be able to communicate\nthough with technical people too.\n\n227\n00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.200\nThere's some really, really good\npeople in IT that are able to do that,\n\n228\n00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.220\nand we have roles such as business\nrelationship management roles that\n\n229\n00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.990\nare very,\nvery good at taking user requirements and\n\n230\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.170\ntranslating them into\ntechnical requirements.\n\n231\n00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.760\nAnd we also have roles,\npeople on the service desk are really,\n\n232\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.370\nreally good at that translation as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always tell, especially with\n\n233\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.390\npeople who are just getting started in IT,\nthat is an amazing job to have.\n\n234\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.866\nIf you can financially find a situation\nthat works for you, take it.\n\n235\n00:12:17.866 --> 00:12:20.230\nYou're getting so\nmuch varied experience, and\n\n236\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.262\njust understanding how that organization\nworks, it's a great way to get your foot\n\n237\n00:12:24.262 --> 00:12:26.670\nin the door.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n238\n00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:31.560\nyou wouldn't believe it I guess,\nbut the amount of service desk\n\n239\n00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.900\nanalysts that I've come across that have\nended up coming into a product owner role.\n\n240\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.263\nAnd you might to yourself but hang on a\nminute, this one's a management role, and\n\n241\n00:12:40.263 --> 00:12:41.891\nthis is a service desk role [CROSSTALK].\n\n242\n00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:46.402\nBut no it works perfectly because the\nservice desk analyst for a start they have\n\n243\n00:12:46.402 --> 00:12:51.080\nto be able to manage their own time, and\nthey have to be able to work as a team.\n\n244\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.074\nSo the collaboration is not\nsomething that is alien to them.\n\n245\n00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:54.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n246\n00:12:54.582 --> 00:12:58.199\nI mean there are direct performance\nmetrics that can say hey look, Cherokee\n\n247\n00:12:58.199 --> 00:13:01.984\nclosed X amount of tickets, Joe closed X\namount This is how the outcomes where,\n\n248\n00:13:01.984 --> 00:13:04.440\nthis is what the customer\nsaid at the end of the day.\n\n249\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.680\nWere they satisfied with the outcome?\n\n250\n00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.063\nIt is a direct reflection\non that individual.\n\n251\n00:13:09.063 --> 00:13:12.670\nSo you see people that get\nthe inter-level help desk positions,\n\n252\n00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.210\nthey can move up real quickly.\n\n253\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.570\nBecause if you're over performing and\ndoing above what's required,\n\n254\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.620\npeople can obviously directly see that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n255\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.360\nservice tech analysts,\nI mean that's a really good generic role.\n\n256\n00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.472\nIt's a good all round role, but it also\nemphasizes the, you get exposure to all\n\n257\n00:13:32.472 --> 00:13:37.370\nof the technical side to IT and you also\nget exposure to the business as well.\n\n258\n00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.674\nAnd so you have a better high level\nperspective of IT and how much value\n\n259\n00:13:42.674 --> 00:13:48.083\nIT is delivering to the business,\nbetter than any other role than IT.\n\n260\n00:13:48.083 --> 00:13:51.608\nAnd the only one that comes close is that\nof business relationship management.\n\n261\n00:13:51.608 --> 00:13:54.499\nBut even the roles of business\nrelationship management or\n\n262\n00:13:54.499 --> 00:13:56.387\nbusiness partner if you call it that,\n\n263\n00:13:56.387 --> 00:13:59.165\nthey're looking at this from\na customer perspective.\n\n264\n00:13:59.165 --> 00:14:02.893\nSo they're still looking at this\nfrom a management perspective,\n\n265\n00:14:02.893 --> 00:14:06.740\nwhereas the service tech analyst\nis looking it from the ground.\n\n266\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.730\nThey're looking at this\nfrom a user perspective.\n\n267\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.550\nSo, service tech analyst can\nactually make very very good\n\n268\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.120\nproduct owners because they\nunderstand both sides.\n\n269\n00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.710\nAnd they're used to working with a team,\nand they're used to collaboration as well.\n\n270\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.820\nA product owner does not have\nto be a management role.\n\n271\n00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:35.130\nSure it's what we would call\na leadership role within the project,\n\n272\n00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.980\nbut it doesn't have to\nbe a management role.\n\n273\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.280\nAnd not responsible for\nsort of interpersonal management.\n\n274\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.140\nThey're not responsible for\nappraisals and for one to ones and\n\n275\n00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.390\nthat sort of thing, they are actually\nresponsible for that product.\n\n276\n00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.340\nSo what they're gonna do as well is\nthey're going to maintain the product\n\n277\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:56.990\nbacklog.\n\n278\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.850\nAnd that product backlog is obviously how\nmany stories we've got left to complete.\n\n279\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.920\nAnd again,\n\n280\n00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.280\nthis is an organizational role with\nan understanding of the product itself.\n\n281\n00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.722\nAnd they also managed the road map,\nthat's the plan.\n\n282\n00:15:11.722 --> 00:15:14.992\nWhat are we gonna do in the next story or\nin the next release?\n\n283\n00:15:14.992 --> 00:15:17.750\nAnd what are we gonna do in\nthe next iteration, etc.?\n\n284\n00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.230\nThey will manage that.\n\n285\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:25.810\nAgain an organizational perspective is\nneeded in order to be able to do that and\n\n286\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:30.456\nplanning a release, again, it's an\norganizational perspective that's needed.\n\n287\n00:15:30.456 --> 00:15:33.680\nNow, bear in your mind though that\na release consists of more than on\n\n288\n00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.505\niteration, or more than one sprint.\n\n289\n00:15:35.505 --> 00:15:37.785\nAnd they do actually collaborate,\n\n290\n00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:42.497\nnot just with our external stakeholders,\nlike our customers and users,\n\n291\n00:15:42.497 --> 00:15:46.457\nbut also with the Scrum Master and\nthe rest of the team as well.\n\n292\n00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:48.855\nBut of course our stand\nup meetings on a morning,\n\n293\n00:15:48.855 --> 00:15:50.795\nI expect our product owner to be there.\n\n294\n00:15:50.795 --> 00:15:55.625\nOur product owner's the person that's\ngoing to highlight if there are any\n\n295\n00:15:55.625 --> 00:16:00.238\nissues, if there are any sort of\nPoints of contention, should we say?\n\n296\n00:16:00.238 --> 00:16:05.990\nAnd they are ultimately gonna be the one\nthat makes the decision over the product.\n\n297\n00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.610\nAnd this is one of the reasons\nwhy I think that we misconceive\n\n298\n00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.500\nthat product owner should\nbe a technical role or\n\n299\n00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.290\nit should be a management role\nbecause they're making decisions.\n\n300\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.000\nJust because they're making decisions\ndoesn't mean that they have to be\n\n301\n00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.980\na management role, when the decision\nthat they're making is a decision\n\n302\n00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:29.150\nbased on technical requirements,\nand it's based on functionality.\n\n303\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.459\nYou still don't have to have a IT person.\n\n304\n00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.870\nAnd they respect the boundaries\nof that sprint and they respect\n\n305\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:42.260\nthe responsibilities of the scrowmaster\nand the responsibilities of the team.\n\n306\n00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.800\nRemember, we're in a team and\n\n307\n00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.190\nwe're working on pretty much a flat\nstructure because we work on the basis of\n\n308\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:53.010\ncollaboration, self organizing\nteams within Agile.\n\n309\n00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.120\nOkay, so we've got to trust them.\n\n310\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.310\nSo what sort of person do we need then?\n\n311\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.860\nWe've talked about maybe\na status desk analyst, and\n\n312\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.550\nwe've talked about our business partner or\nbusiness relationship manager.\n\n313\n00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.340\nWhat sort of person do we need?\n\n314\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.520\nWell we need somebody that can lead.\n\n315\n00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.163\nNot necessarily somebody that can manage\nremember in previous episodes and,\n\n316\n00:17:12.163 --> 00:17:16.118\nin fact, I think I've flogged that\nhorse to death, to be honest.\n\n317\n00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:19.820\n[LAUGH] What I'd like to think so\nin all of our other episodes.\n\n318\n00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:25.650\nWe don't wanna micromanage,\nwe never wanna micromanage within Agile.\n\n319\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.330\nWe want to ensure that the team\nis working together, and\n\n320\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.910\nthat they're self organizing.\n\n321\n00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.820\nBut nevertheless, they need direction.\n\n322\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.120\nAnd the direction that they need for\n\n323\n00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.140\na product owner is that toleration\nof what to be working on next.\n\n324\n00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:46.360\nAnd the decisions that are to be made\non exactly what the priority should be.\n\n325\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.500\nAnd if something goes wrong something\ndoesn't quite turn out the way it's\n\n326\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.370\nsupposed to or the way it was\nplanned then what do we do then?\n\n327\n00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:01.170\nSo the product owner's gotta be available,\nit says within reason, cuz sometimes,\n\n328\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.080\ndepending on the actual\nsize of the project itself,\n\n329\n00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.390\nthe product owner doesn't\nhave to be a full-time role.\n\n330\n00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.890\nIt doesn't have to be somebody\nthat's there all the time.\n\n331\n00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.070\nThey could be doing other things.\n\n332\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.060\nIt depends on the scale.\n\n333\n00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.060\nAnd I will be perfectly honest with you.\n\n334\n00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.740\nMore often than not I see\ndedicated product owners.\n\n335\n00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.050\nI don't see a product owner that's sharing\na role with something else that it's\n\n336\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.190\ndoing something else.\n\n337\n00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.970\nThey've gotta know about the product.\n\n338\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.840\nOf course, they have to know about that.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n339\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.113\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I think that's\nlike the main thing about this,\n\n340\n00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:37.540\nthe main role here.\n&gt;&gt; And I love the word humility.\n\n341\n00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.140\nWe've been talking about this quite a lot,\n\n342\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.130\nactually, for\none of our previous episodes.\n\n343\n00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:51.090\nAnd quite a lot what we've been\ngoing through certain things\n\n344\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.010\nhere within our organizations\nabout humility and\n\n345\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.450\nabout respect in other people's skills.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n346\n00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.330\nAnd I think, for a product owner\nto be incredibly successful,\n\n347\n00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.540\nwe have to make sure that we\nrespect other peoples' skills.\n\n348\n00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.860\nAs a product owner,\nI may know a product really, really well,\n\n349\n00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:15.190\nbut especially if I'm from the business,\nI don't know how to design that product?\n\n350\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.510\nYou know what?\n\n351\n00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.110\nI'm gonna leave that to Cherokee\nbecause she knows how to do that.\n\n352\n00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.860\nAnd I understand that\nI know more than you.\n\n353\n00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.653\nAlso that you know more than me,\nsee that was me being humble there,\n\n354\n00:19:26.653 --> 00:19:27.540\ndid you notice that?\n\n355\n00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.175\nI said I know more than you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:19:30.175 --> 00:19:31.700\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna respect\n\n357\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.160\nthat you know more than\nme on certain things.\n\n358\n00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.380\nThat's why we work as a collaborative\nteam, understanding that some people know\n\n359\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.930\nmore than we do in certain areas, and\nthat's exactly how a team should work.\n\n360\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.700\nAnd even the leader, the product owner,\nthat leadership role,\n\n361\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.272\nthey're exactly the same.\n&gt;&gt; I think that's just a great life\n\n362\n00:19:53.272 --> 00:19:53.898\nlesson also.\n\n363\n00:19:53.898 --> 00:19:57.720\nI mean I tell my kids all the time,\nlike knowing your limitations,\n\n364\n00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.611\nit's okay to not be able to do\neverything and understanding that and\n\n365\n00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:05.020\nadmitting to it, when that's the case.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n366\n00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.802\nthen I guess you're talking to the queen\nof sort of don't overestimate and don't.\n\n367\n00:20:08.802 --> 00:20:10.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.940\n&gt;&gt; Praise when do praise is due, right?\n\n369\n00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.112\nAnd that's it.\n[LAUGH] Yeah, let's not pretend we can do\n\n370\n00:20:16.112 --> 00:20:18.720\nthings that we can't, all right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n371\n00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.990\n&gt;&gt; So responsibility,\n\n373\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.300\nI expect that person to understand and\nto have some responsibility.\n\n374\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.526\nIf the don't, then they really\ndon't need to be in that position.\n\n375\n00:20:32.526 --> 00:20:38.340\nEverybody needs to have a sort of modicum\nresponsibility for their own work.\n\n376\n00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.930\nThat's again part of that flat structure,\n\n377\n00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.660\nit's part of that working\ntogether as a team.\n\n378\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.338\nKnowledgeable about history doesn't mean\nthat they understand about the Romans,\n\n379\n00:20:47.338 --> 00:20:47.867\nall right?\n\n380\n00:20:47.867 --> 00:20:50.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because you know what?\n\n381\n00:20:50.246 --> 00:20:54.490\nWhatever the Romans have done for us, and\nif you're a Monty Python fan you'll know\n\n382\n00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.640\nexactly where that line came from, [LAUGH]\nand whatever the Romans have done for\n\n383\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.230\nus, well, it's got nothing to\ndo with the product right now.\n\n384\n00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.910\nWhen we're knowledgable about\nthe history of the organization and\n\n385\n00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:10.970\nunderstanding what direction\nthe organization is heading towards and\n\n386\n00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.105\nalso knowledgeable about\nthe history of the product itself.\n\n387\n00:21:14.105 --> 00:21:17.155\nAnd so where it's come from,\nand looking to the future,\n\n388\n00:21:17.155 --> 00:21:19.305\nwhere we expect it to evolve.\n\n389\n00:21:19.305 --> 00:21:22.325\nSo I also like to use\nthe word evolution as well,\n\n390\n00:21:22.325 --> 00:21:24.985\nknowledgeable about evolution, okay?\n\n391\n00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:29.214\nAnd again, when we talk about service\ndesk analysts here, you know,\n\n392\n00:21:29.214 --> 00:21:32.806\nour service desk analysts\nare very good at communication.\n\n393\n00:21:32.806 --> 00:21:36.325\nDont' expect me to say\nthe word communicative.\n\n394\n00:21:36.325 --> 00:21:39.209\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That looks like it hurt Joe.\n\n395\n00:21:39.209 --> 00:21:41.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, once, once.\n\n396\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.680\nThat's all you get, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.500\nAnd on collaborative, and then again,\n\n398\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.930\nif you are able to be communicative\nlook at that, if you are communicative,\n\n399\n00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:57.110\nyou should be able to be\ncollaborative It's working together.\n\n400\n00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.730\nBut working together means being able\nto communicate with everybody else in\n\n401\n00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.090\nyour team.\n\n402\n00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.180\nAnd of course, flexibility.\n\n403\n00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:10.400\nThat's what we're really looking for in a\nproduct donor because well things change.\n\n404\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.756\nSimple as that.\n\n405\n00:22:11.756 --> 00:22:14.450\n[LAUGH] Fun and reasonable.\n\n406\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.026\nDo you know what?\n\n407\n00:22:16.026 --> 00:22:21.294\nI hate those working environments\nwhere everybody's really staid and\n\n408\n00:22:21.294 --> 00:22:25.595\neverybody's really sorta strict and\nformal and rigid.\n\n409\n00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:29.698\nYeah, I'm not like that at all\nin case you haven't guessed.\n\n410\n00:22:29.698 --> 00:22:31.117\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, me either.\n\n411\n00:22:31.117 --> 00:22:34.885\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] People can relax in employment.\n\n412\n00:22:34.885 --> 00:22:38.765\nIf people can relax in their tasks\nthen you actually get more done.\n\n413\n00:22:38.765 --> 00:22:43.890\nAnd so we wanna make sure that\nas part of the agile team,\n\n414\n00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:48.850\nand as part of the project,\nwe wanna ensure that well work gets done.\n\n415\n00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:54.310\nAnd so\nmake the learning environment as conducive\n\n416\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.320\nas you possibly can To\nthat collaborative nature.\n\n417\n00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.830\nAnd if it means that everybody goes and\nstarts building houses with Lego bricks or\n\n418\n00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.310\nsomething that you know what?\n\n419\n00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.360\nThat's great.\n\n420\n00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.020\nLet's have a competition to see\nhow quickly we can build a two\n\n421\n00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.800\nstory house out of Lego bricks.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's kind of funny,\n\n422\n00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.070\ncuz this looks like a page right out Tim,\nthe owner of ITProTVs book.\n\n423\n00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.622\nCuz he always says, have fun, responsibly.\n\n424\n00:23:16.622 --> 00:23:19.963\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, that's exactly it,\n\n425\n00:23:19.963 --> 00:23:21.490\nexactly.\n\n426\n00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.870\nSo the team itself then, who do I expect\nto see within my development team?\n\n427\n00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.100\nWell I expect to see.\n&gt;&gt; Who's that?\n\n428\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.848\n&gt;&gt; That's my business analyst,\n\n429\n00:23:29.848 --> 00:23:31.234\nwhat's that?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n430\n00:23:31.234 --> 00:23:32.939\n&gt;&gt; You know what we need to do,\n\n431\n00:23:32.939 --> 00:23:35.163\nwe need to get some photos in there,\n\n432\n00:23:35.163 --> 00:23:36.060\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n433\n00:23:37.422 --> 00:23:38.371\n&gt;&gt; Okay, hat's Zach,\n\n434\n00:23:38.371 --> 00:23:41.150\nwith a bit of hair going.\n&gt;&gt; Zach, our buisness analyist.\n\n435\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.963\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've also got a developer there,\n\n436\n00:23:43.963 --> 00:23:46.718\nthat kind of looks like Albert doesn't it?\n\n437\n00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:50.390\nYeah, yeah, and\nwe've got another developer there as well.\n\n438\n00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.418\nWe've got three developers.\n\n439\n00:23:52.418 --> 00:23:56.560\nOne of them's developing something\nslightly different by the looks of things.\n\n440\n00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.336\nAnd then we've got a QA person as well.\n\n441\n00:23:59.336 --> 00:24:01.426\nShe looks very happy in her job for\na QA person.\n\n442\n00:24:01.426 --> 00:24:02.463\n&gt;&gt; She looks ready to,\n\n443\n00:24:02.463 --> 00:24:05.086\nyeah, she looks ready to\nreally just like send them\n\n444\n00:24:05.086 --> 00:24:06.195\nback.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n445\n00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:07.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This doesn't meet my standards.\n\n446\n00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so then we've got somebody,\n\n447\n00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.460\nlook at that, ersponsible for\n\n448\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.650\nthe user experience.\n&gt;&gt; He's super excited too.\n\n449\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:17.530\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n450\n00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.378\nYeah, that's worrying, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n451\n00:24:20.378 --> 00:24:22.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm scared, [LAUGH] I'm scared.\n\n452\n00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.720\nAnd then we've got our leadership, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.760\nWe've got our scrum master and our product\nowner, she's looking way too relaxed for\n\n454\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.415\nproduct owner.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n455\n00:24:31.415 --> 00:24:34.568\nshe needs like her mascara running and\nher hair all disheveled.\n\n456\n00:24:34.568 --> 00:24:35.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n457\n00:24:35.276 --> 00:24:36.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n458\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.150\n&gt;&gt; It's the scrum master that I'm more\n\n459\n00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.420\nworried about,\nshe's looking way too happy.\n\n460\n00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.717\nNormally when I see a scrum master, right?\n\n461\n00:24:42.717 --> 00:24:47.023\nIt's kind of you know, like you say,\nthe hair's all disheveled, a bit like me.\n\n462\n00:24:47.023 --> 00:24:48.096\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n463\n00:24:48.096 --> 00:24:48.795\n&gt;&gt; Stressed.\n\n464\n00:24:48.795 --> 00:24:49.718\n&gt;&gt; What do you want?\n\n465\n00:24:49.718 --> 00:24:53.472\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we say here that our development\n\n466\n00:24:53.472 --> 00:24:59.840\nteam is about 6 to 9 people, it really\ndepends on the size of the project.\n\n467\n00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.500\nBut for each particular sprint,\n\n468\n00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.100\nyou don't want to be producing too\nmuch in each particular sprint.\n\n469\n00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.780\nThis goes back to what we were saying in\nprevious episodes when we were looking\n\n470\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:18.540\nat our agile fundamentals actually, about\nmaking sure we've got the right amount of\n\n471\n00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:24.130\ndevelopment work in each iteration and\nin each sprint.\n\n472\n00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.150\nAnd thinking about who our users are,\nand how quickly and\n\n473\n00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.270\nhow often do they want change,\nand how much change do they want?\n\n474\n00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.445\nIf my operating system is updating\nevery single week, and there's a lot\n\n475\n00:25:38.445 --> 00:25:43.700\nof updates every single week,\nI'm gonna get very fed up very quickly.\n\n476\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.927\nBut if my operating system updates\nonce every three months, so\n\n477\n00:25:47.927 --> 00:25:50.660\nwe do release once every three months.\n\n478\n00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.480\nAnd it's a huge big release,\nthen I'm gonna\n\n479\n00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.180\nfind that inconvenient because it's\ngoing to be an interruption to my work.\n\n480\n00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.100\nWhich means that from us\nin a agile environment,\n\n481\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.327\nin a development environment,\nwe can't develop too much and\n\n482\n00:26:07.327 --> 00:26:12.220\nrelease it too frequently,\nbecause that's gonna be too disruptive.\n\n483\n00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.026\nSo, we've gotta get that balance\nright between having visible\n\n484\n00:26:17.026 --> 00:26:20.470\nfunctionality, but not too much change.\n\n485\n00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.760\nWe need to have change, but not too much.\n\n486\n00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.710\nWhich is why development team\nis usually about 6 to 9 people,\n\n487\n00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:30.984\nbecause you don't want to produce too\nmuch in each sprint or at each release.\n\n488\n00:26:30.984 --> 00:26:35.340\nThat's gonna be too much for\nthe organization to be able to take.\n\n489\n00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.590\nWe know that the product\nowner is empowered by,\n\n490\n00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.585\nwell, by the organization as a whole.\n\n491\n00:26:44.585 --> 00:26:48.502\nHe's the only person responsible for\nmanaging that backlog,\n\n492\n00:26:48.502 --> 00:26:53.990\nbecause the backlog, well that\ncontains all of the user stories and\n\n493\n00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:57.100\ntheir prioritization on the functionality.\n\n494\n00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.372\nAnd the Scrum Master,\nthe Scrum Master is the person that\n\n495\n00:27:01.372 --> 00:27:05.030\nmanages all of the interpersonal stuff,\nyeah?\n\n496\n00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.650\nThey are they doing the man\nmanagement of the team.\n\n497\n00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.810\nUltimately, a strong agile\nteam is a team that is\n\n498\n00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:19.710\nself organizing, that motivates\nthemselves, they're committed to success.\n\n499\n00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.060\nAnd they believe, and\n\n500\n00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.260\nthey probably can, they should\nbe able to resolve any problem.\n\n501\n00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.440\nBut they're empowered to\nresolve the problem and\n\n502\n00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.610\nthey work together to resolve problems.\n\n503\n00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.787\nAnd the decisions that they\nmake are their decisions, okay?\n\n504\n00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:41.040\nFor an agile team, it's consensus driven,\nit is not hierarchically driven.\n\n505\n00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:46.420\nIt's consensus driven, so\ndecisions are made within the team itself.\n\n506\n00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:51.620\nWhich means that we have to have [LAUGH]\nconstructive disagreement, no arguing,\n\n507\n00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.437\nbut healthy debate, that's fine.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n508\n00:27:54.437 --> 00:27:55.845\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, no arguing.\n\n509\n00:27:55.845 --> 00:28:00.874\nThe thing is, we have to recognize\nthat when it comes to an agile team,\n\n510\n00:28:00.874 --> 00:28:03.960\nan A team really, for good team dynamics.\n\n511\n00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.720\nYou're gonna get people that don't\nnecessarily agree, or that don't,\n\n512\n00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.560\nI wouldn't say that don't get on,\nbut that do things differently.\n\n513\n00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.870\n&gt;&gt; I find this, and I actually enjoy it.\n\n514\n00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:17.420\nBecause when you have people who\nare passionate about what they do,\n\n515\n00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.170\nthey're gonna feel strongly about it.\n\n516\n00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.270\nAnd not everyone has the same views,\nand that's okay.\n\n517\n00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.560\nBecause you know what, Jo?\n\n518\n00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:28.070\nYou may explain something to me in a way\nI never thought about that before.\n\n519\n00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, but the thing is as well,\n\n520\n00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:35.090\nyour view point might be slightly\ndifferent to my view point.\n\n521\n00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.476\nThat doesn't mean that mine's right and\n\n522\n00:28:36.476 --> 00:28:37.402\nyour's is wrong.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n523\n00:28:37.402 --> 00:28:38.460\n&gt;&gt; Or that your's is right and\n\n524\n00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.640\nmine's wrong.\n\n525\n00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.160\nIt will mean that actually you're able to,\nas you say,\n\n526\n00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.480\nopen up something completely new to me.\n\n527\n00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.570\nAnd that might be a perspective that\nI've never thought about before,\n\n528\n00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.420\nbecause your experiences\nare completely different to mine.\n\n529\n00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.570\nAnd so we have to learn from each other.\n\n530\n00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.205\nSometimes, sure,\nthe product owner's got to step in and\n\n531\n00:28:56.205 --> 00:29:00.480\nhas got to make a decision on what's going\nto happen for the actual product, and\n\n532\n00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.190\nwhat's the best thing for\nthe product itself.\n\n533\n00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.502\nBut we want to have\ndifferent perspectives,\n\n534\n00:29:04.502 --> 00:29:06.049\nthat's the sign of a good team.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n535\n00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:09.240\nI can tell you like personally,\nI can attest to this.\n\n536\n00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.317\nI have worked with people who were\ncomplacent, who are just kind of like\n\n537\n00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:13.855\n[NOISE], whatever, you know?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n538\n00:29:13.855 --> 00:29:15.743\n&gt;&gt; And then I worked with people who I\n\n539\n00:29:15.743 --> 00:29:18.790\nhave butted heads with, but\nI honestly prefer that.\n\n540\n00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.557\nBecause at least they care,\nat least they will explain to me, and\n\n541\n00:29:22.557 --> 00:29:25.510\nthen that's the thing too,\nis arguing sensibly.\n\n542\n00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:29.670\nBecause if you can provide facts and\nexplain why you feel the way you do,\n\n543\n00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:33.290\nthen I totally am okay with it, even if\nit's completely different with myself.\n\n544\n00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:37.559\nBut I would take that person any day over\nthe complacent individual who could care\n\n545\n00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:39.901\nless.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's funny because, and\n\n546\n00:29:39.901 --> 00:29:43.570\nI mentioned different people\nbringing different perspectives.\n\n547\n00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:48.902\nBut also, you've got different people that\nhave not just a different view point but\n\n548\n00:29:48.902 --> 00:29:51.170\na different way of working as well.\n\n549\n00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.115\nAnd sometimes your way of working\nis great in one situation but\n\n550\n00:29:54.115 --> 00:29:57.900\nmy way of working might be actually\nbetter in another situation.\n\n551\n00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.261\nAnd I might be bringing in\nthe user perspective, and\n\n552\n00:30:00.261 --> 00:30:02.740\nI might be saying well look,\nI know what you want to do.\n\n553\n00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.836\nAnd I know that it make sense\nto do it in this way, and\n\n554\n00:30:05.836 --> 00:30:09.690\nI know that this is the story\nthat you want to deliver first.\n\n555\n00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.050\nBut unfortunately this is the priority for\nthe users.\n\n556\n00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.130\nAnd that's what we've\ngot to deliver first,\n\n557\n00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:19.000\nespecially because we've got to\ndeliver visible improvement.\n\n558\n00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.280\nAnd so we've all got a perspective,\n\n559\n00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.120\nand we've all got valuable input, and that\nis the key to a successful agile team,\n\n560\n00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.620\nis acknowledging that\neverybody's input is valuable.\n\n561\n00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.750\nAs long as they have an input,\n\n562\n00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:38.040\nif you've got somebody that's completely\ncomplacent and they don't have that input,\n\n563\n00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.580\nthen they're not contributing to the team.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n564\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.228\n&gt;&gt; You want people that are contributing\n\n565\n00:30:43.228 --> 00:30:44.120\nto the team.\n\n566\n00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.600\nAnd even if it's contributing\na different perspective, that's okay.\n\n567\n00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.880\nCuz sometimes we all have to recognize\nthat our perspective is not necessarily\n\n568\n00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.570\nthe right one.\n\n569\n00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.490\nSo the product owner then,\nthey're responsible for\n\n570\n00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.760\nmaking decisions about\nthe actual product themselves.\n\n571\n00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:06.960\nBut they can only do that with\na strong agile team underneath them.\n\n572\n00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.572\nAnd of course what they'll do is they\nare the people that are responsible for\n\n573\n00:31:11.572 --> 00:31:15.260\ndefining the user story and\nprioritizing the user stories.\n\n574\n00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:20.232\nAnd also they're the people\nthat are responsible for,\n\n575\n00:31:20.232 --> 00:31:25.340\nwell, the inclusion of user\nstories as well, you know?\n\n576\n00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.710\nWhat's going to be included,\nwhat's not going to be included.\n\n577\n00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:34.200\nSo in our next episode we're going to look\nmore at user personas and user stories.\n\n578\n00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.340\nBut for now, we've looked at\nthe person that we need for\n\n579\n00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.966\nour product owner role and\nin our next episode we'll look at, well,\n\n580\n00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:45.410\nexactly what they do.\n&gt;&gt; Great Jo, so I feel like I'm\n\n581\n00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:49.620\nready to go ahead and understand all\nthese different capabilities, but\n\n582\n00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.300\nwe're not quite,\nwe're gonna be looking at personas,\n\n583\n00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.890\nand what was the other thing?\n&gt;&gt; Stories.\n\n584\n00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.620\n&gt;&gt; Stories and personas, all right.\n\n585\n00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.640\nSounds like a plan, thank you for\njoining us, hope to see you next time.\n\n586\n00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.150\nFor now, we'll sign out,\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n587\n00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:01.170\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n588\n00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.720\n&gt;&gt; Bye.\n\n589\n00:32:02.720 -->

Francisco,\nCalifornia with [CROSSTALK].\n\n3\n00:00:06.517 --> 00:00:08.275\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:13.300\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your\n\n5\n00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.150\nagile product owner series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.220\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.800\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat personas and stories and of course,\n\n8\n00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.340\nyou know it, with us today,\nback in studios, we have Mrs. Joe Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.210\nHow's it going Joe?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.800\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing lovely,\n\n11\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.250\nand we are not gonna be talking\nabout what, like personas,\n\n12\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.660\nas far as any kind of what the personality\nis, or image is we are trying to create.\n\n13\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.406\nAre we?\n&gt;&gt; I hope not, [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.466\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.410\n&gt;&gt; We are you know kind\n\n16\n00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.615\nof.\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n17\n00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:44.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n18\n00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.230\nkind of we are gonna be talking\nabout the users, well their persona.\n\n19\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.260\nWho they are?\n\n20\n00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.460\nHow they work?\n\n21\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.160\nAnd the sort of tasks that they do and\nthe way that they do those tasks as well.\n\n22\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.940\nAnd the sort of things that they\nlike to see, believe it or not.\n\n23\n00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.583\nSo yeah, we're gonna actually find\nout a lot about the user personality.\n\n24\n00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:05.157\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great,\n\n25\n00:01:05.157 --> 00:01:06.586\nwhere are we gonna start?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n26\n00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:10.712\nwe're gonna start off at the beginning\nof the project, I guess.\n\n27\n00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:16.610\nAnd at the beginning of a project,\nwe have what we call a planning hierarchy.\n\n28\n00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.070\nAnd at the beginning of a project,\nwe will have a vision for that project.\n\n29\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.578\nAnd that vision,\nwe will then split into features.\n\n30\n00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:28.170\nAnd we know, you know the usual features\nthat you have within any sort of\n\n31\n00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.050\nproduct, or with any particular app.\n\n32\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.181\nSo there are certain applications\nthat will, what their feature is,\n\n33\n00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.661\nmaybe word processing.\n\n34\n00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:42.858\nOr their vision is word processing, but\n\n35\n00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:47.191\none of their feature will be\nto compile new documents.\n\n36\n00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:50.414\nAnd another feature will be to edit\nexisting documents that have been\n\n37\n00:01:50.414 --> 00:01:51.325\nsent to you.\n\n38\n00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:55.395\nAnd then, underneath that we have our epic\nstories and we know what our epics are,\n\n39\n00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:59.587\nour epic stories, we've discussed\nthese in our fundamental series.\n\n40\n00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:01.647\nAnd our epic stories are basically,\n\n41\n00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:07.147\na whole story that we're going to\nsplit into individual user's stories,\n\n42\n00:02:07.147 --> 00:02:12.567\ninto individual chunks that we can\nactually program within each iteration.\n\n43\n00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.937\nAnd so, within each epic story,\n\n44\n00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:20.390\nyou're going to have maybe we're\nanywhere from two to four,\n\n45\n00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.440\nsix, seven maybe stories\nunderneath each epic.\n\n46\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.050\nNow obviously for this particular graphic,\n\n47\n00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.560\nI can't fit that many in, but\nnevertheless, you get the gist of it.\n\n48\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.060\nWithin each epic,\nwe're going to have multiple user stories.\n\n49\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.530\nAs a product owner, your responsibility\nis actually to define the user stories,\n\n50\n00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.460\nand so\nwe always start off with this cascade.\n\n51\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.060\nUnderstanding exactly what it is that\nthe organization wants to achieve, and\n\n52\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.060\nthen we then split that into features,\nand then into epics, and\n\n53\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.990\nthen into individual stories.\n\n54\n00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.600\nHowever, I'm gonna go back to a question\nthat I ask you way too many times, and I\n\n55\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.268\nasked you this in the previous episode as\nwell, which is how do you send an email?\n\n56\n00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:07.528\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n57\n00:03:07.528 --> 00:03:09.165\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not gonna go over this again,\n\n58\n00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:12.660\nall right, because Cherokee's answered\nthis question way too many times now.\n\n59\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.300\nShe doesn't need to answer again, but\nwe've already established in previous\n\n60\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.230\nepisodes that the way that\nCherokee sends an email.\n\n61\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.690\nWell, it's different to the way she\ndescribes to me how she sends an email.\n\n62\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.517\nBecause actually what she does is\ndifferent to what she says she does.\n\n63\n00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:35.536\nI know, it's an IT thing I think,\nwe'll all like that.\n\n64\n00:03:35.536 --> 00:03:36.679\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n65\n00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:37.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're just not very\n\n66\n00:03:37.202 --> 00:03:38.600\ngood at describing things.\n\n67\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.566\nBut ultimately,\nthere's something else that's involved\n\n68\n00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:48.430\nin that as well, and\nit's who you are that also describes or\n\n69\n00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.145\nthat also denotes the way you work,\nas well.\n\n70\n00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:56.602\nI'm going to give you an example, and\nI'm going to go back a few years ago and\n\n71\n00:03:56.602 --> 00:04:00.560\na long, long time ago,\nI used to have somebody who worked for me.\n\n72\n00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.540\nShe is absolutely the wonderful,\n\n73\n00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.950\nwonderful person,\nshe really was a very long time ago.\n\n74\n00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.510\nAnd she used to do everything by rote,\nyou would say.\n\n75\n00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.000\nSo she would do everything, she would\nwrite absolutely everything down.\n\n76\n00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.900\nAnd she was the sort of person\nthat she was absolutely brilliant.\n\n77\n00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.040\nShe would do anything for you,\nas long as she had it written down.\n\n78\n00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.290\nThe instructions were written\ndown step by, step by, step.\n\n79\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.280\nNow, you and\nI are able to work out well I'd hope so.\n\n80\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.100\nAnd you and\nI are probably able to work out.\n\n81\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.100\nThat if I click on OK or\nif I click on Accept, it's\n\n82\n00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.830\nexactly the same as hitting Enter, yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n83\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.830\n&gt;&gt; This person couldn't do that.\n\n84\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.130\nWe'll call her Mary, okay.\n\n85\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.380\nMary couldn't do that.\n\n86\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.670\nBut more importantly than that,\nit wasn't that Mary couldn't do that.\n\n87\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.730\nIt's that Mary would say to me,\nI don't like to make assumptions, and\n\n88\n00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:08.120\njust because it might make sense to you,\nit doesn't make sense to me.\n\n89\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.010\nAnd if I hit Enter when you've told me\nI've got to click on OK, if I hit Enter,\n\n90\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.320\nsomething different might happen.\n\n91\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.720\nAnd I won't know how to get out of that.\n\n92\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.760\nAnd so, Mary didn't like to make\nthat assumption, and she didn't\n\n93\n00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.750\nlike to draw the conclusion that hitting\nEnter is the same as pressing OK.\n\n94\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.430\nNow, you and I would probably work very\nsimilarly in that we'd try it anyway.\n\n95\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.619\nWe'd just do it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:37.902\n&gt;&gt; And if something happened, we'd go, no,\n\n97\n00:05:37.902 --> 00:05:40.034\nI gotta fix it,\nI'll learn even more, [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:05:40.034 --> 00:05:41.623\n&gt;&gt; That's my thinking behind something.\n\n99\n00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:42.388\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n100\n00:05:42.388 --> 00:05:48.355\nthis is when Backspace comes in or Cancel,\n[LAUGH] Go to the previous page, Escape.\n\n101\n00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:50.185\nAll of the ones that we normally try,\n\n102\n00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:52.500\nall of that would happen\nat that point in time.\n\n103\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.020\nMy function keys,\nonce we've realized we've made a mistake.\n\n104\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.190\nBut Mary didn't like to do that.\n\n105\n00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.930\nAnd so, this is why we have\nto then draw a user persona.\n\n106\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.072\nBecause the User Persona will\ntell us who that person is.\n\n107\n00:06:11.072 --> 00:06:14.646\nSo exactly it says on this particular\nslide in front of us then we have to\n\n108\n00:06:14.646 --> 00:06:16.310\nunderstand the person.\n\n109\n00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.640\nYou've got to design for\nthe customer experience.\n\n110\n00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.140\nAnd you'll notice that\nwe call that the CX.\n\n111\n00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.490\nAnd I know that I mentioned\nthis in previous episodes.\n\n112\n00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.030\n&gt;&gt; Before, but\n\n113\n00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.310\nthat CX has got to be explicitly designed.\n\n114\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.561\nWe should have for every single project,\n\n115\n00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:39.480\nand you may even wanna take this down\nto individual user stories, as well.\n\n116\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.400\nYou should have a User Persona defined.\n\n117\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.941\nBe careful, we're not getting\ninto the realms of kind of say,\n\n118\n00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.590\nwell, we're designing for Joe.\n\n119\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.970\nShe's a little bit overweight,\nshe likes to sit down a lot.\n\n120\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.940\nShe's not exactly getting the exercise.\n\n121\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.223\nYeah, that's not the right\nkind of user persona,\n\n122\n00:07:01.223 --> 00:07:03.359\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n123\n00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:05.120\n&gt;&gt; What, [LAUGH]?\n\n124\n00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.091\n&gt;&gt; I'm just taking it all in here,\n\n125\n00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:09.680\nCaroline.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just be careful what you say.\n\n126\n00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.490\nRemember that the User Persona,\n\n127\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.550\nwe've gotta get a bit of the personality\nof the person into that user persona.\n\n128\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.480\nWe've got to know the person.\n\n129\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.800\nAnd we've got to know\nthe way they operate.\n\n130\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.810\nWhat we will tend to do when it comes to\na user persona is we will not design for\n\n131\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.580\na specific person.\n\n132\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.390\nBut we will give our persona a name.\n\n133\n00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.350\nSo what we might do instead\nof designing for Cherokee.\n\n134\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.950\nAnd Cherokee likes intuitive software.\n\n135\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.340\nAnd Cherokee likes software\nthat is really easy to use.\n\n136\n00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.490\nAnd that she doesn't have to read\nthe manual, cuz she's an IT person, and\n\n137\n00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.547\nwe don't read manuals.\n\n138\n00:07:47.547 --> 00:07:51.460\nSo, [LAUGH] what I might do,\nand what I should do,\n\n139\n00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.235\nis I will create the User Persona.\n\n140\n00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:59.698\nAnd I will say, okay,\nUser Persona for Fred.\n\n141\n00:07:59.698 --> 00:08:05.310\nFred is an intuitive person, Fred is\na person who doesn't like to read manuals.\n\n142\n00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.630\nFred is a person that wants\nthe software to be able to\n\n143\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.240\nwork everything out in the background.\n\n144\n00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.560\nFred cannot explain absolutely\neverything that Fred does.\n\n145\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.549\nYeah, cuz we know this one, right?\n\n146\n00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:21.193\n[LAUGH] But\nFred is a highly intelligent IT person and\n\n147\n00:08:21.193 --> 00:08:24.590\nis able to figure things out for himself.\n\n148\n00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.760\nAnd Fred also likes to experiment and\nhypothesize.\n\n149\n00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.870\nSo if Fred does end up down a rabbit\nhole or in the wrong place,\n\n150\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:38.440\nthen Fred will work his way back to\ngetting to where he started from.\n\n151\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.630\nThat's a user persona.\n\n152\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.156\nWe're not necessarily\npicking out individuals, but\n\n153\n00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:46.511\nwe want to use our persona for each story.\n\n154\n00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:49.908\nThat can be quite a challenge,\nbecause in itself,\n\n155\n00:08:49.908 --> 00:08:54.810\neach story is going to be applicable\nto more than one person, generally.\n\n156\n00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.947\nGenerally each piece of\nfunctionality that we design and\n\n157\n00:08:58.947 --> 00:09:01.250\nthat we develop is applicable\nto more than one person.\n\n158\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.310\nWe [LAUGH] don't just design for\none individual.\n\n159\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:11.039\nSo actually defining the user persona\nis quite a complex task to do.\n\n160\n00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:16.593\nBecause we have to take the personality\nof everybody that's going to be using\n\n161\n00:09:16.593 --> 00:09:21.830\nthat software and combine it together\nin maybe one or two user personas.\n\n162\n00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.430\nIt goes back to what I've been saying\nin a lot of previous episodes,\n\n163\n00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.750\nwhere you cannot, as we said here,\n\n164\n00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:35.200\nyou cannot design the software unless\nyou know who you're designing for.\n\n165\n00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.110\nNow, we will normally have discussions\nat this point in time about\n\n166\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.210\nbeing color blind and about who's being\ncolorblind, or who is colorblind?\n\n167\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.960\nAnd you've got to design for that.\n\n168\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.680\nAnd somebody said to me earlier, and\nprior to this particular episode,\n\n169\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.950\nwhen I mentioned about designing for\nour customer experience and designing\n\n170\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.820\nthose interaction points, the moments of\ntruth, and they said but then I'm color\n\n171\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.920\nblind and I look at accessibility, and\nI have to go into accessibility options.\n\n172\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:13.090\nAnd my point to that is if it's something\nthat's in accessibility options,\n\n173\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.550\nis it there because it has been designed\nincorrectly in the first place?\n\n174\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.020\nAnd what we've done is\nwe've put in an add-on.\n\n175\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.170\nBecause, if you understand your customer,\nand\n\n176\n00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.725\nif you understand the moments of truth,\nand you understand the persona,\n\n177\n00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:34.650\nthen you shouldn't need to\nturn on accessibility options,\n\n178\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:39.590\nbecause you would've already designed\nthe software to meet their needs.\n\n179\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:45.214\nAnd if they're color blind, then you\ndesign that software without any red or\n\n180\n00:10:45.214 --> 00:10:50.854\ngreen in it, or without any reason to\nhave to differentiate between the two.\n\n181\n00:10:50.854 --> 00:10:57.442\nThe user persona is incredibly important,\nincredibly important.\n\n182\n00:10:57.442 --> 00:11:02.046\nAnd it's only when we've got the user\npersona, that we understand the user,\n\n183\n00:11:02.046 --> 00:11:05.830\nthat we then go and\nwe then define the user stories.\n\n184\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.370\nAnd there's gonna be more\nthan one story per epic, and\n\n185\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.100\ndefinitely more than\none story per feature.\n\n186\n00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.659\nAnd of course, we'll get into prioritizing\nthe user stories in a little while.\n\n187\n00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:20.052\nBut a user story is a way of\ncapturing the stakeholder,\n\n188\n00:11:20.052 --> 00:11:24.900\nthe user requirements,\nand it's documented.\n\n189\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:30.330\nAnd it really just describes how a user\nis going to use that particular solution.\n\n190\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.270\nSo it has to have enough detail in it for\nus in IT,\n\n191\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.280\nin development,\nto be able to understand their needs.\n\n192\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.410\nBut we're not designing\na solution right now,\n\n193\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:45.080\nwhat we're doing is just saying in this\nuser story, this is what they want to do.\n\n194\n00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.540\nAnd the product owner takes that\naccountability for clarifying the user\n\n195\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.930\nstory to the developers,\nif the developers have any questions.\n\n196\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:00.820\nBut it's the user story that allows us to,\nit's got enough information\n\n197\n00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.460\nto allow us to be able to estimate how\nlong it's going to take to develop.\n\n198\n00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.950\nYou looked as though you had a question.\n&gt;&gt; No I'm just, I'm a little sponge.\n\n199\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.440\nI'm soaking it all in.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] She's soaking it all in.\n\n200\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.220\nRight, so\nwhat should be a user story then?\n\n201\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.180\nWell, whatever you need, really,\nto be able to design a solution,\n\n202\n00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.100\nand to be able to design a product.\n\n203\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.310\nBut the user story is\nnot a design document.\n\n204\n00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.220\nThe user story is something\nthat's incredibly small and\n\n205\n00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.040\nshould fit on a postcard.\n\n206\n00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.610\nThat's my user story.\n\n207\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.586\nI know some people who write user stories\nand they'll fit it on a Post-it note.\n\n208\n00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.144\nIt depends on the size\nof the Post-it note-\n\n209\n00:12:42.144 --> 00:12:42.689\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:12:42.689 --> 00:12:43.467\n&gt;&gt; To be perfectly honest.\n\n211\n00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:44.105\n[LAUGH] Okay?\n\n212\n00:12:44.105 --> 00:12:49.398\nBecause it should contain sort of the user\ninterface and any third-party services,\n\n213\n00:12:49.398 --> 00:12:53.910\nor we should consider all of this in\nour user stories, so not contained.\n\n214\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.040\nAnd an example though should be very,\nvery high-level here.\n\n215\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.800\nAs a retail customer, I need to be able to\norder and buy food from wherever I am so\n\n216\n00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.695\nI can have food delivered to my home\nwithout having to drive to the shop.\n\n217\n00:13:05.695 --> 00:13:06.640\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n218\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.270\n&gt;&gt; That's my user story,\n\n219\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.740\nthat's what they want to achieve.\n\n220\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.020\nThis is not a design document,\nit shouldn't be a design document.\n\n221\n00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.530\nBut it should give enough\ninformation to the developer, so\n\n222\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:24.170\nthat the developer can then\ndesign a solution for this.\n\n223\n00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:29.620\nAnd so my user story, well, we get\nto it by conversation with the user.\n\n224\n00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.160\nAnd we write it on what\nwe say a post card, but\n\n225\n00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.370\nthen we confirm the user\nstory with the user.\n\n226\n00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:43.590\nIt's not agreed until it's been\nconfirmed with the user, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.560\nIt's just not agreed.\n\n228\n00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.059\nOnce it's been confirmed with the user,\nthen, as I said, we write it on the cards\n\n229\n00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:53.433\nor we write it up on a Post-it note, and\nthat's when it's stuck on the board.\n\n230\n00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.420\nThe stories that we need to create.\n\n231\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.920\nAnd of course, creating a user story\nis not just down to one person.\n\n232\n00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.860\nCreating a user story is actually\nsomething that is done by\n\n233\n00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.940\nthe project team themselves.\n\n234\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.664\nSo it's done by our development team,\nso the product owner can do that,\n\n235\n00:14:14.664 --> 00:14:18.613\nthe designer can do that,\na product owner proxy can do that,\n\n236\n00:14:18.613 --> 00:14:24.191\nwe can delegate that to somebody, or even\nmaybe our business relationship manager or\n\n237\n00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:26.917\nour business analyst can help with that.\n\n238\n00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:32.438\nBut what we should be doing is, I've\nalready mentioned the word collaboration,\n\n239\n00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:37.820\nand doing this together as a team,\na user story should be written as a team.\n\n240\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.690\nIt should be a collaborative story, and\n\n241\n00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.530\nit's not something that one\nperson can just dictate.\n\n242\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.040\nIf we think back to a previous episode,\nand in previous episode, in fact,\n\n243\n00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.980\nit was our last episode where we talked\nabout the fact that we all have different\n\n244\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.280\nperspectives, and that we all have\ndifferent requirements as well.\n\n245\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.110\nAnd let me take you back to Mary.\n\n246\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.820\nAnd Mary has got very,\nvery specific requirements.\n\n247\n00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.570\nNow, if I go back to that particular,\nand let me just jump around a bit,\n\n248\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.280\nif go back to this, as a retail\ncustomer I need to be able to order and\n\n249\n00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.400\nbuy food from wherever I am so\nthat I can have food delivered to my home\n\n250\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.480\nwithout having to drive to the shop or\nto the store.\n\n251\n00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.100\nNow, if I think about Mary, then I think\nwell, Mary needs to be able to order and\n\n252\n00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.070\nbuy food from wherever they are.\n\n253\n00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.440\nNow, just think,\nMary will need instructions,\n\n254\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.140\nnot only how to load up the app that\nwe're giving her, but from wherever I am,\n\n255\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.080\nthat generally means on a mobile phone or\non a cell phone,\n\n256\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.570\na mobile device,\nwhich means some form of app.\n\n257\n00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.250\nMary won't just need instructions for\nthe app, Mary will need instructions for\n\n258\n00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.010\nthe entire phone as well.\n\n259\n00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:48.270\nSo when you turn on your phone,\nso turn on your phone like this.\n\n260\n00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.495\nAnd then load the app by clicking here,\nand\n\n261\n00:15:51.495 --> 00:15:55.714\nthen go into the app and\nclick on this particular point.\n\n262\n00:15:55.714 --> 00:16:00.664\nWhereas, if I'm designing this\nparticular story for you,\n\n263\n00:16:00.664 --> 00:16:03.389\nWe won't need any of that at all.\n\n264\n00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:08.240\nWe'll simply say use this app and\nhere's your instructions within the app.\n\n265\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.930\nSo a user persona is really,\nreally important.\n\n266\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:19.390\nSo can I ask you, then do you think that\nyou could have more than one persona\n\n267\n00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.190\nper story?\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n268\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\n\n269\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.240\ncuz we're gonna have different\nuser groups that could be\n\n270\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.910\nusing each particular story.\n&gt;&gt; And I mean, if you think about\n\n271\n00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:34.420\nmaybe two of the most common types,\nwould be B2B, and B2C user groups.\n\n272\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.390\nFor a lot of organizations,\nthey already have those acronyms defined.\n\n273\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.140\nAnd that's something\nthat we can relate to.\n\n274\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.620\n&gt;&gt; Right, so does then,\n\n275\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.510\nif we have got different user stories.\n\n276\n00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.970\nLet's say we've got two user stories.\n\n277\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.310\nI've got Mary, and\nI've got you as my user stories.\n\n278\n00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.840\nDoes that change the functionality at all?\n&gt;&gt; It shouldn't.\n\n279\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.697\nWe should be able to do the same things.\n\n280\n00:16:56.697 --> 00:16:58.107\nWait, hold on, let me think about this.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:16:58.107 --> 00:17:00.732\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to put this in ITProTV\n\n282\n00:17:00.732 --> 00:17:06.095\nperspective, and our B2B customers\nare different than our B2C.\n\n283\n00:17:06.095 --> 00:17:12.200\nBecause our B2C are normally independent,\nand they're looking to learn on their own.\n\n284\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.980\nSo they're more interested in things like\npractice labs or the practice test or\n\n285\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.650\nany kind of additional study material.\n&gt;&gt; So are you talking about different\n\n286\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.390\nstories there?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, am I?\n\n287\n00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:27.020\nBecause well the same functionality,\nlike to have a login and a user account.\n\n288\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.580\nAnd then-\n&gt;&gt; Is this the same functionality though?\n\n289\n00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.916\nBecause you just said that they're\ninterested in different things.\n\n290\n00:17:31.916 --> 00:17:33.131\n&gt;&gt; Hm, I know-\n\n291\n00:17:33.131 --> 00:17:34.748\n&gt;&gt; So is it the same functionality?\n\n292\n00:17:34.748 --> 00:17:37.193\nIt's not.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n293\n00:17:37.193 --> 00:17:40.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And this is the sort of thing\n\n294\n00:17:40.081 --> 00:17:46.900\nthat a product owner has got to help\nthe team to figure out, because it's not.\n\n295\n00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.130\nIt's different functionality.\n\n296\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.561\nYou're talking about going into\ndifferent functionalities.\n\n297\n00:17:50.561 --> 00:17:54.813\nYou've just said that a lot\nof our B2B customers want\n\n298\n00:17:54.813 --> 00:17:57.044\nto get into practice labs.\n&gt;&gt; B2C.\n\n299\n00:17:57.044 --> 00:17:58.465\n&gt;&gt; Right our B2C.\n\n300\n00:17:58.465 --> 00:17:59.062\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n301\n00:17:59.062 --> 00:18:00.813\n&gt;&gt; Clients want to get into practice labs.\n\n302\n00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:02.045\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n303\n00:18:02.045 --> 00:18:03.648\n&gt;&gt; And what do our B2B customers?\n\n304\n00:18:03.648 --> 00:18:04.873\nWhat do they want to get into,\n\n305\n00:18:04.873 --> 00:18:06.145\njust the content?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n306\n00:18:06.145 --> 00:18:10.735\nthe actual users probably\nwant to be in there, also.\n\n307\n00:18:10.735 --> 00:18:15.449\nBut a lot of the customers are going to\nlook at things like the supervisor portal.\n\n308\n00:18:15.449 --> 00:18:16.986\nDid Cherokee actually watch the videos?\n\n309\n00:18:16.986 --> 00:18:22.279\nThat maybe her boss is asking, and I'm\ntalking about myself in third person and\n\n310\n00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:23.936\nI hate that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.064\n&gt;&gt; But the supervisors,\n\n312\n00:18:25.064 --> 00:18:27.967\nor we call it our ProPortal now,\nbut they like to look in and\n\n313\n00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:30.894\nmonitor progress to make sure\nthat their employees have.\n\n314\n00:18:30.894 --> 00:18:33.960\nSay, if they're the customer, and\nthey're paying for those users,\n\n315\n00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.940\nto make sure that they are following\nup with what they were assigned.\n\n316\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.230\n&gt;&gt; But that's different functionality.\n\n317\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, true.\n\n318\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.470\n&gt;&gt; So that's a different story, and\n\n319\n00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.340\nthis is confusing.\n\n320\n00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.250\nAnd I'm not gonna pretend that it's easy,\nand\n\n321\n00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:50.280\nthis why we take the time to elaborate on\nthis because we've gotta get it right.\n\n322\n00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.530\nBecause from a development prospective,\n\n323\n00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.150\nI'm developing two different things.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n324\n00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm developing labs,\n\n325\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.370\nand I'm developing a ProPortal.\n\n326\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.630\nI'm developing two different things, so in\nthat instance that you've just given me,\n\n327\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.690\nin that example, we're talking\nabout different user personas.\n\n328\n00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.820\nBut we're also talking about\ndifferent stories, as well.\n\n329\n00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.910\nNow, the example that I gave you,\n\n330\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:17.600\nwhich was the home shopping example\nwhere I had you, and I had Mary.\n\n331\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.556\nI'm talking about one story for\ntwo different personas.\n\n332\n00:19:21.556 --> 00:19:22.234\n&gt;&gt; I think Mary,\n\n333\n00:19:22.234 --> 00:19:23.709\nand I both want our groceries.\n\n334\n00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:26.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n335\n00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.220\nYou both want to get your food, so\nyou both want to be able to eat,\n\n336\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.396\nbut you just want to\ndo it a different way.\n\n337\n00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:37.850\nSo the user's story still exactly the same\nbecause we're still developing the same\n\n338\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.360\nfunctionality.\n\n339\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.400\nBut what we're going to do\nis when we do the testing,\n\n340\n00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.870\nwhen we do the user acceptance testing.\n\n341\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.180\nAnd then please go back to our episode or\nour series on Agile testing.\n\n342\n00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.780\nBut when we do the user testing, then the\nuser acceptance testing will be different\n\n343\n00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.980\ndepending on the user persona.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n344\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.480\n&gt;&gt; This is why personas are really\n\n345\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.210\nimportant.\n\n346\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.430\nBecause if we don't have\nthe personas defined,\n\n347\n00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.690\nthen what will happen is\nwe'll just test one thing.\n\n348\n00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.150\nAnd we'll test the way that Cherokee does\nit cuz we're in IT, and it's easy for\n\n349\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.930\nus to test it that way because-\n&gt;&gt; Just cuz I'm standing right here,\n\n350\n00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:14.525\nand yeah.\n\n351\n00:20:14.525 --> 00:20:17.868\n[LAUGH] Yeah and\nshe has to hear me complain, yeah.\n\n352\n00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:20.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right, so we're going to\n\n353\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.680\nbe testing just the way that Cherokee\nwants to use it because we're in IT.\n\n354\n00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.980\nAnd that's the way that would use it,\nand that's the way that we would test.\n\n355\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:34.752\nSo if we didn't have Mary's user persona\ndefined, we would never test it.\n\n356\n00:20:34.752 --> 00:20:38.997\nAnd because we would never test it,\nthen that would make it difficult for\n\n357\n00:20:38.997 --> 00:20:42.700\nMary to then use the product\nbecause she wouldn't know how to.\n\n358\n00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.380\nAnd that is exactly the same as when we\nwere talking about being colorblind and\n\n359\n00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.360\nthen having to add in\naccessibility options.\n\n360\n00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.950\nBecause we didn't think about the user\npersona right at the very beginning.\n\n361\n00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.550\nSo these are why our user personas are so\nimportant to our user stories,\n\n362\n00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.130\nbut we have to be able to differentiate\nbetween the user personas and\n\n363\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:09.010\nthe functionality within the user stories.\n\n364\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:14.790\nBecause if the functionality is different,\nthen that's a different user story.\n\n365\n00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.230\nKinda makes sense, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n366\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.935\nit does.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n367\n00:21:18.935 --> 00:21:20.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.370\n&gt;&gt; So our user stories,\n\n369\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.520\nthen, are created by\nlots of different people.\n\n370\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.060\nAnd it has to be done\ncollaboratively before we can\n\n371\n00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.460\nactually define and agree the user story.\n\n372\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.990\nSo let's take a look then\nat our acceptance criteria.\n\n373\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.980\nBecause you see, what we've done by\ndefining the user story is we've also\n\n374\n00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.260\ndefined the acceptance criteria.\n\n375\n00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:49.230\nThen, the acceptance criteria\nwas what we want to see.\n\n376\n00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:55.380\nNow, the acceptance criteria for\nthat particular example that I gave you,\n\n377\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:01.510\nthat acceptance criteria is for online\nshopping or rather for mobile shopping.\n\n378\n00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:06.130\nBut it describes the features\nin the acceptance criteria.\n\n379\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:10.440\nAnd the story must be included to be\naccepted by the user, and of course,\n\n380\n00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.330\nwe're gonna have differing, well,\nwe gonna have the same functionality.\n\n381\n00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:20.620\nBut we're gonna have a different way\nof working with those two user stories.\n\n382\n00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.110\nAnd so we generally put that on\nthe back of the user story card.\n\n383\n00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.940\nYou could log that somewhere differently,\nbut we generally put it on the back of\n\n384\n00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.710\nthe user story card because that's\nwhat we have to test as well.\n\n385\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.430\nSo you'd pick up the card with the actual\nstory, and you look at the back and say,\n\n386\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.300\nwow, well that's what I'm gonna test.\n\n387\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.554\nThat's what's going to tell me\nwhether I'm actually successful,\n\n388\n00:22:41.554 --> 00:22:44.060\nwhether this story is completed or not.\n\n389\n00:22:46.905 --> 00:22:51.955\nSo, remember, that a good story, well,\nwe've got to invest in a good story.\n\n390\n00:22:51.955 --> 00:22:58.405\nAnd again, we covered this when we\nlooked at our fundamentals series.\n\n391\n00:22:58.405 --> 00:23:03.085\nA good user story should be\nindependent of other user stories.\n\n392\n00:23:03.085 --> 00:23:07.675\nSo we should be able to identify\nthe functionality just for\n\n393\n00:23:07.675 --> 00:23:11.190\nthat user story, but\nit should also be negotiable.\n\n394\n00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.280\nA user story is the end result.\n\n395\n00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.640\nIt's not the design.\n\n396\n00:23:17.864 --> 00:23:20.070\nThe design needs to be flexible.\n\n397\n00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.705\nThe end result should be fairly flexible,\n\n398\n00:23:23.705 --> 00:23:26.420\nbearing in mind that things\nare going to change.\n\n399\n00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.920\nBut we may decide that within\n\n400\n00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.150\na particular piece of functionality\nthat we might deliver one user story.\n\n401\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.760\nAnd then maybe in a subsequent\niteration or a subsequent sprint,\n\n402\n00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.130\nwe might actually deliver another\nuser story that's fairly similar.\n\n403\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.408\nOr we may overwrite that\nprevious user story.\n\n404\n00:23:43.408 --> 00:23:47.440\nUltimately, the story's gotta be\nvaluable to the customer and not to us.\n\n405\n00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.250\nIt's not what we want to deliver.\n\n406\n00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.859\nIt's what they want to see, and\nit's how they want to use it.\n\n407\n00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:59.904\nIt's got to be a story that we can\ndeliver within a set period in time,\n\n408\n00:23:59.904 --> 00:24:06.485\nso this is why we talk about small, and\nwe talk about estimate at whatever.\n\n409\n00:24:06.485 --> 00:24:08.195\nWe gotta be able to estimate it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n410\n00:24:08.195 --> 00:24:10.868\n&gt;&gt; Estimable, that sounds.\n\n411\n00:24:10.868 --> 00:24:12.580\n&gt;&gt; Estimatable?\n\n412\n00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.470\n&gt;&gt; Estimatable?\n\n413\n00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.570\nEstimable is kind of probably\nwhat we'd use at English.\n\n414\n00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.470\nThat's what we use in English but\nestimatable.\n\n415\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.328\nYeah, all right, I'm okay, I'm good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n416\n00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:24.432\n&gt;&gt; I'm good without one as well.\n\n417\n00:24:24.432 --> 00:24:28.030\nIf that's so easier to say,\nput it that way.\n\n418\n00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.415\nWe've got to be able to estimate.\n\n419\n00:24:29.415 --> 00:24:32.320\n[LAUGH] And the length of the user story.\n\n420\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.280\nAnd like I said, it's got to be small.\n\n421\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.820\nIt's got to fit within an iteration.\n\n422\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:40.790\nAnd an iteration is well,\nbetween one and four weeks.\n\n423\n00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.160\nNothing more than that, okay?\n\n424\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.660\nAnd the user story.\n\n425\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.510\nWell, you better be able to test it.\n\n426\n00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:52.780\nHave we actually delivered what\nwe are supposed to deliver?\n\n427\n00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.760\nBecause that's the ultimate test,\nisn't it?\n\n428\n00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.900\nHave we achieved what\nwe set out to achieve?\n\n429\n00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.110\nAnd then, of course,\nwe've got these Epic stories.\n\n430\n00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.085\nAnd the Epic stories, which we covered\nright to the very beginning of this\n\n431\n00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:09.050\nepisode is usually made up of\nmore than two user stories, okay?\n\n432\n00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.660\nAnd what we do is we delivery\nthat in more than one increment.\n\n433\n00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.550\nSo we deliver that in\nindividual user stories.\n\n434\n00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.610\nSo it's a story that's got\nto be slipt basically.\n\n435\n00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.590\nIt's too big and it has to be split.\n\n436\n00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.820\nSo before we leave for this particular\nepisode and we are gonna come back in\n\n437\n00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:32.040\na part two and carry on with our\nuser stories but before we leave,\n\n438\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.870\nI really just wanna reinforce\nthe importance of the user persona.\n\n439\n00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:42.440\nAnd it's not something that we\ngenerally consider too much within IT.\n\n440\n00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.500\nBut it goes back to everything\nthat I say about development and\n\n441\n00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.530\neven in support environment as well,\nit's about understanding your business and\n\n442\n00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.310\nunderstanding your customer.\n\n443\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.510\nAnd unless you actually\nunderstand who your business and\n\n444\n00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:59.910\nyour customer are, then you're really not\ngonna be able to deliver the functionality\n\n445\n00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.540\nthat's valuable to them and the\nfunctionality that truly meets their need.\n\n446\n00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.450\nYou're only going to be able to deliver\nfunctionality that meets just a portion of\n\n447\n00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.970\ntheir need.\n\n448\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.710\nSo, users pesona is a something\nthat should not be overlooked.\n\n449\n00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:16.180\nAnd yet, I see this all\nthe time in organizations where\n\n450\n00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.510\nthey have users stories.\n\n451\n00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:21.240\nBut when I ask to see,\nespecially when I'm doing assessments and\n\n452\n00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.980\nI ask to see what they're users\npersona's are, they can't produce them.\n\n453\n00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.000\nBecause they've all overlooked that.\n\n454\n00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.650\nBut as we've seen, we can have\nvarious user personas for one story.\n\n455\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:37.170\nAnd we have to be able to articulate all\nof our user personas because we've got to\n\n456\n00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.270\ndeliver a solution that meets them all.\n&gt;&gt; You've\n\n457\n00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.250\ndefinitely given me\nsomething to think about.\n\n458\n00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.140\nI had to re-work all that Jo.\n\n459\n00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.850\nBut nope, that's what we're here for.\n\n460\n00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.810\nThank you and thank you for\njoining us as well.\n\n461\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.200\nBut like she said,\nwe do have additional content to cover, so\n\n462\n00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.800\nyou don't want to miss that.\n\n463\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.130\nFor this show, we will sign out.\n\n464\n00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.410\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n465\n00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.183\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

You're watching IT PRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.440\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your\nAgile Product Owner Series,\n\n6\n00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.430\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.140\nIn this episode we'll be picking back up\nwith a part two where we continue to look\n\n8\n00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.490\nat user personas and stories.\n\n9\n00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.190\nAnd you know it, with us back in studios,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.140\nHow's it going, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.890\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.630\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.329\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing really well.\n\n14\n00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.270\nWe started talking about\ndifferent personas.\n\n15\n00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.725\nYou had to kind of sort me, and\n\n16\n00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.773\npush me in the right direction\nto make sure I understood that.\n\n17\n00:00:37.773 --> 00:00:40.180\nBut now that we're here,\nwhat do we have left to cover?\n\n18\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.626\nRight, well we're just gonna really\ncarry on with that particular theme that\n\n19\n00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.413\nwe started off in our previous episode.\n\n20\n00:00:45.413 --> 00:00:47.430\nLooking at the user personas and\n\n21\n00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.802\nlooking more importantly\nnow at the user of stories.\n\n22\n00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:55.937\nIn our last episode we looked at the user\npersonas and we defined user personas.\n\n23\n00:00:55.937 --> 00:01:00.925\nAnd of course we had that sort of\nrevelation that the user personas don't\n\n24\n00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:04.464\nnecessarily directly relate\nto the user stories.\n\n25\n00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:08.703\nAnd you can have more than one\nuser persona for each user story.\n\n26\n00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:13.148\nBecause even though the user story\nrefers to the end result, and\n\n27\n00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:15.792\nwhat it is you're trying to deliver.\n\n28\n00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:20.187\nThe user persona, that's about the people\nthat are going to be using that particular\n\n29\n00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:21.540\npiece of functionality.\n\n30\n00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.380\nAnd of course, we might have\ntwo completely different users.\n\n31\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.642\nAs we mentioned in the last episode,\nwe've got Mary.\n\n32\n00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:32.743\nMy friend Mary, who likes to have\nthings written explicitly for her,\n\n33\n00:01:32.743 --> 00:01:34.004\nevery single thing.\n\n34\n00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:35.376\n&gt;&gt; Step by step.\n\n35\n00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:39.760\n&gt;&gt; Step by step, yeah, and she's\ngotta follow everything step by step.\n\n36\n00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.900\nWhereas you,\nyou're more of an intuitive user.\n\n37\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.420\nAnd therefore, you don't need everything\nwritten down, you wanna work it out for\n\n38\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.770\nyourself because you, like me,\ndon't wanna read the manual, right?\n\n39\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.468\n[LAUGH] We wanna do it ourselves.\n\n40\n00:01:51.468 --> 00:01:54.690\nAnd if it goes wrong, we'll pick up the\npieces afterwards, that's how we learn.\n\n41\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.890\nSo we've got different users, but\nfor exactly the same functionality.\n\n42\n00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.690\nAnd so the user persona, whilst we\nneed to have the user personas for\n\n43\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.590\nour stories then we\nalso need to accept and\n\n44\n00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.880\nacknowledge that we may have more\nthan one user persona for each story.\n\n45\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.960\nAnd don't try and fit everybody into one\nbox because it simply just doesn't work,\n\n46\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.440\nwe can't do that.\n\n47\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.750\nSo, the first thing that really I've\ngot in front of you and don't forget,\n\n48\n00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.220\nall of this material that you can\nsee on the screen is downloadable.\n\n49\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.560\nYour course notes are all downloadable\nwith the Azure series itself.\n\n50\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.860\nSo, you can log on and\ndownload all of this material.\n\n51\n00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.410\nAnd these are just some samples,\njust some examples of user stories and\n\n52\n00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.570\nuser stories, if we remember and\nlet me just go back to the formula here.\n\n53\n00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.353\nA user story starts off with as a user or\n\n54\n00:02:48.353 --> 00:02:52.619\nas a customer, I need a specific feature.\n\n55\n00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:59.540\nSo that I can I know achieve some specific\ngoal or benefit, and that's my user story.\n\n56\n00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.810\nAnd so we've got more examples here.\n\n57\n00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.810\nAs a banking customer,\nI wanna be able to view my or\n\n58\n00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.435\nview online my available checking\naccount so that I can manage my account.\n\n59\n00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:15.700\nOr as frequent flyer, I wanna use my own\nmiles so I can upgrade my boarding status.\n\n60\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.468\nWould not be nice, it's never.\n\n61\n00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:18.980\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was just thinking,\nI've never been able to do that.\n\n62\n00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.134\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's never available I wanna\n\n63\n00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:21.900\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n64\n00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.488\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\nMy,\n\n65\n00:03:22.488 --> 00:03:27.209\nthere's one airline that will actually,\nthey do things a little bit differently,\n\n66\n00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.680\nand they do it by check in.\n\n67\n00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.049\n&gt;&gt; So I like to fly with them cuz\nat least I get a fighting chance,\n\n68\n00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.037\nI'm like I'm going to check\nin right at that moment.\n\n69\n00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:37.685\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've got one airline that automatically\n\n70\n00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.520\nupgrades me every time I fly.\n\n71\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.324\nI've never been upgraded in my life, but\n\n72\n00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:43.930\napparently they're\nautomatically upgrading me.\n\n73\n00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.160\nWhat it means is I go on a list generally\nabout number 30 of three seats that they\n\n74\n00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.812\ngot free, that's an upgrade, right.\n\n75\n00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:52.707\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This isn't first class right?\n\n76\n00:03:52.707 --> 00:03:57.296\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No I wished yeah, maybe if\nthere's anybody watching out there\n\n77\n00:03:57.296 --> 00:04:02.371\ninternational flights, yeah,\nback to England, bet that would be great.\n\n78\n00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:05.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyways,\n\n79\n00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.550\n&gt;&gt; We've got another one there,\n\n80\n00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.940\nyou know it's a furniture maker.\n\n81\n00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.970\nSo as a particular person, as a user,\nI need, this is what I want to do.\n\n82\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.310\nSo that I can achieve this.\n\n83\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.270\nSo that I can make the most\neconomical decision for my customers.\n\n84\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.660\nBut these are just my user stories.\n\n85\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.990\nThese are my example user stories,\njust some samples there.\n\n86\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.400\nDon't forget the user personas\nare going to be completely different.\n\n87\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.861\nThink about as a frequent flyer I\nwanna be able to use my own miles so\n\n88\n00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:39.224\nI can upgrade my boarding status.\n\n89\n00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:43.205\nSome frequent flyers, well, some\nfrequent flyers like you've just said,\n\n90\n00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:45.690\nyou wanna check in 24 hours in advance.\n\n91\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.010\nSome frequent flyers don't check in until\nan hour before the flight takes off.\n\n92\n00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:54.820\nThey're still using exactly\nthe same functionality and\n\n93\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.040\nthey still want to\nachieve the same outcome.\n\n94\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.502\nBut the way that they use that\nparticular functionality or\n\n95\n00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:03.530\nthat service is gonna be\ncompletely different.\n\n96\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.253\nSo you have two different personas, you\nhave the person that does everything in\n\n97\n00:05:08.253 --> 00:05:11.510\nadvance and wants to do\neverything as soon as they can.\n\n98\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.445\nSo 24 hours before the flight takes off\nthey're gonna use their mobile app to\n\n99\n00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:16.280\ncheck in.\n\n100\n00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.550\nAnd then you've got the person\nwho's more than like me [LAUGH].\n\n101\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.405\nArrives at the airport with literally just\nseconds to spare, having not checked in or\n\n102\n00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:27.735\nanything like that and\nthen tries to run through security.\n\n103\n00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:28.773\nThat's yeah [LAUGH].\n\n104\n00:05:28.773 --> 00:05:29.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n105\n00:05:29.924 --> 00:05:31.885\nwe all wanna achieve the same thing,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:35.850\nWe all want to use our miles to\nupgrade our boarding status.\n\n107\n00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.350\nOr rather upgrade the seat\nthat we're seating on.\n\n108\n00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.335\nMaybe get that nice glass\nof champagne you know.\n\n109\n00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:44.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So your user of personas\n\n110\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.180\nare completely different as we've\nalready said in the previous episode,\n\n111\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.629\ncompletely different to the user stories\n&gt;&gt; And whilst they should be linked to\n\n112\n00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.270\nthe user stories, we will have more\nthan one persona per user story.\n\n113\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.811\nSo with our user stories and\nwith our user personas,\n\n114\n00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:04.077\nwe should actually work as a team\nto ensure that we've captured\n\n115\n00:06:04.077 --> 00:06:09.150\nabsolutely everything in the stories and\nin the personas as well.\n\n116\n00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.252\nNow, sure when we think about the episode\nthat we're in and we think about\n\n117\n00:06:13.252 --> 00:06:17.904\nthe series that we're currently talking\nabout which is that of the product owner.\n\n118\n00:06:17.904 --> 00:06:23.117\nThe product owner really has\na responsibility to make sure, ensure\n\n119\n00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:29.350\nthat we have user stories and ensure that\nwe have articulated the user personas.\n\n120\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.470\nI mentioned right at the very\nvery end of our last episode that\n\n121\n00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.380\nyou shouldn't forget your user\npersonas cuz that's really important.\n\n122\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.249\nGo back to this example about flying.\n\n123\n00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:45.341\nIt's really important that you\nunderstand that some people check in at\n\n124\n00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:46.119\nthe last minute.\n\n125\n00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:50.582\nIt's also important that you understand\nthat some people check in as soon as check\n\n126\n00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:52.195\nin becomes available.\n\n127\n00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:55.813\nAnd there's no right and wrong way\nof doing this, it's just that, and\n\n128\n00:06:55.813 --> 00:06:59.865\nthat's another thing is, you shouldn't\njudge people on their persona.\n\n129\n00:06:59.865 --> 00:07:04.200\nThat it's just their persona,\nand you have to accommodate that.\n\n130\n00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.042\nSome people might say that the way I\napproach flying is the wrong thing to do.\n\n131\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:10.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I was thinking, Joe,\nhave you been judging my persona?\n\n132\n00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:17.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, I'm more judging my\npersona actually, this is what it is.\n\n133\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.260\nDoing everything at the last minute\nis generally not a great idea.\n\n134\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.647\nBut for some people,\nit's just the way we roll, all right.\n\n135\n00:07:24.647 --> 00:07:27.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I swear when I stand here\n\n136\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.810\ntalking about planning and\n\n137\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.040\ntalking about preparing that I probably\nshould do little bit more myself.\n\n138\n00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.890\nSo making sure that all team\nmembers are involved in actually\n\n139\n00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:45.110\ncrafting these stories and\ncrafting the user personas as well.\n\n140\n00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.625\nAnd then everybody is aware of how many\nstories are being added to the backlog and\n\n141\n00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:50.212\nwhat the size of those stories are.\n\n142\n00:07:50.212 --> 00:07:53.682\nWe're gonna talk about\nthat in a little while,\n\n143\n00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:58.562\nwe'll talk about sizing stories and\nestimating stories as well.\n\n144\n00:07:58.562 --> 00:08:01.700\nOne thing that we've gotta\nbe careful of and again,\n\n145\n00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.209\na product tone is gonna take\nthe responsibility for this.\n\n146\n00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:08.215\nWell, actually, they're gonna take\nthe accountability for this and\n\n147\n00:08:08.215 --> 00:08:10.490\nthe team are gonna work\nthis out themselves.\n\n148\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.890\nWe don't want sort of duplicate or\noverlapping stories.\n\n149\n00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.840\nNow, I avoided the use of\nthe word redundant, because\n\n150\n00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.120\nredundant means slightly different things\ndepending on where you are in the world.\n\n151\n00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:28.350\nAnd redundant, and we talk about redundant\nsystems, which are duplicate systems.\n\n152\n00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.630\nBut when we talk about redundancy,\ncertainly in England,\n\n153\n00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.780\nthen that means something\nthat's not necessarily needed.\n\n154\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.680\nAnd so yeah,\nwe gotta be careful with that.\n\n155\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.540\nSo I wanna use the word duplicate.\n\n156\n00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.850\nAvoiding duplicate stories or\noverlapping stories.\n\n157\n00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.270\nIf you got a story that\noverlaps with another story,\n\n158\n00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:52.960\nif it's not part of one ethic story then\nwhat you're doing is you are designing and\n\n159\n00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.530\nthen developing that particular\npiece of functionality twice.\n\n160\n00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.470\nThere's a danger to that.\n\n161\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.110\nNot so\nmuch that it's wasted effort which it is.\n\n162\n00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.950\nBut also, the one way that you\ndeveloped it, it might be completely\n\n163\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.510\ndifferent contentious to\nthe next way that you develop it.\n\n164\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.540\nAnd that could have a problem and it could\nhave a knock-on effect because if you\n\n165\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.030\ndesign, if you develop something after\nyou've already previously developed it,\n\n166\n00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.688\nthen you might stop the previous\nfunctionality from working.\n\n167\n00:09:21.688 --> 00:09:26.160\nSo we've gotta make sure that\nour stories are very explicit,\n\n168\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.150\nbut more important than that,\nthe way that we design and\n\n169\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.980\nthe way that we develop, is very planned.\n\n170\n00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.970\nShould we say,\nI don't want to say constraint, and\n\n171\n00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.150\nI don't want to say rigid, but\nI'd rather use the word sort of plans.\n\n172\n00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.090\nSo that we understand what\nappears in what story.\n\n173\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.870\nEspecially where we got an epic story and\nwe've got lots of stories underneath.\n\n174\n00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.100\nMake sure you understand what you're\ndoing, as part of each story.\n\n175\n00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.386\nThat's really important, otherwise,\nyou just gonna end up with chaos and\n\n176\n00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:05.680\nthen you think that conflicts,\nthen we want to sit down again as a team.\n\n177\n00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.730\nAnd try and reconcile those stories and\n\n178\n00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.340\nmake sure that we understand what we're\ngoing to do as part of each story.\n\n179\n00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.320\nThat happens more\nfrequently than you think.\n\n180\n00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.730\nYou might expect that if we're a team and\nwe're working together, and\n\n181\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.490\nwe're working really, really well,\nthen that doesn't happen because you're\n\n182\n00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.650\ngonna concentrate on one area, and\nI'm gonna concentrate in another area.\n\n183\n00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.470\nBut that's not always\nthe way that it works.\n\n184\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.294\n&gt;&gt; Well, we heard it this morning\nin our stand-up meeting, right?\n\n185\n00:10:31.294 --> 00:10:34.990\nJoe with Cameron and he said, look,\nI finished my story early, so\n\n186\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.082\nI'm gonna go ahead and help out two\nother teammates to see if they need help\n\n187\n00:10:39.082 --> 00:10:40.810\nwith their particular story.\n\n188\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.040\nSo just being available if\nsomeone needs you also, hey,\n\n189\n00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.014\nI did finish on time what do you say,\nJoe, do you need my help?\n\n190\n00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:52.040\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah, and that's what we've\ngot to do as part of our Agile team,\n\n191\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.970\nwe've gotta be collaborative, but\nwe've also gotta make sure that\n\n192\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.250\nwe're collaborating and\nwe're not duplicating work.\n\n193\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.500\nSo Cameron in our Daily Standup today,\n\n194\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.145\nCameron said, look,\nI finished my user story.\n\n195\n00:11:04.145 --> 00:11:08.100\nWhat it doesn't mean is necessarily that\nhe has finished the development of that\n\n196\n00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.810\nstory.\n\n197\n00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.790\nAlthough he might have done in that\ninstance, but what he means is right,\n\n198\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.300\nokay, I've defined this\nparticular user story.\n\n199\n00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.580\nI'm gonna go and help you with\ndefinition of that user story.\n\n200\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.565\nDon't forget what we're talking about\nright now at this particular moment in\n\n201\n00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:25.340\ntime is just the definition\nof the user story.\n\n202\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.380\nIt's that articulation of the user's\nstory rather than the actual development.\n\n203\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.170\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n204\n00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.450\n&gt;&gt; And so whilst he's saying that it\ncould be in the context of development,\n\n205\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.650\nI'm finished my development so\nnow I'm able to help you with yours.\n\n206\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.820\nHe could also be saying that in the\ncontext of right, I've articulated mine.\n\n207\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.109\nNow I'm gonna help you articulate yours.\n\n208\n00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.700\nSo let's think about this, a sprint.\n\n209\n00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.620\nBetween one or four weeks,\nwhen does this happen?\n\n210\n00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.770\nWhen do we define our user stories?\n\n211\n00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.390\nThat's supposed to be our timeline.\n\n212\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.590\n&gt;&gt; It has to be before\nthe one to four weeks.\n\n213\n00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:08.130\n&gt;&gt; It's before the sprints, because right\nat the very beginning of the project,\n\n214\n00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.350\nwe have to define our user's stories and\n\n215\n00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.430\nthen we divide those\nstories up into the sprint.\n\n216\n00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.572\nSo the product done will work out which\nstories are gonna fit in with sprint and\n\n217\n00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:19.560\nwhere our dependencies lie as well.\n\n218\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.900\nAnd of course our prioritization too.\n\n219\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.930\nSo this happens before the sprint.\n\n220\n00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.700\nThe planning is done up front.\n\n221\n00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.860\nSo this is not part of your one to four\nweek, this is part of your planning,\n\n222\n00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.010\nthis is what happens before that.\n\n223\n00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.430\nSo we should all know what our\nusers stories are before we\n\n224\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.400\nstart each iteration.\n\n225\n00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.110\nDon't forget, and go back to,\nif you want to, to, you know,\n\n226\n00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.090\nquestion more about the timeline,\ngo back to our agile fundamental series.\n\n227\n00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:57.655\nAnd you'll see there that we also have\nto at the end of every sprint that we do\n\n228\n00:12:57.655 --> 00:13:02.390\na review of our sprint and we do our\nretrospective of what went wrong, etc and\n\n229\n00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.640\nwhich stories are still outstanding.\n\n230\n00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.815\nYou never ever finish\nan iteration with half a story,\n\n231\n00:13:08.815 --> 00:13:12.290\nyou'll agree then to put that\nstory back on the board and\n\n232\n00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.250\nthen it goes into another iteration\nas it's back on the board, right?\n\n233\n00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.640\nSo this is done in collaboration\nbefore we've actually mapped out.\n\n234\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.710\nAnd we look at this in another\nepisode before we've mapped out\n\n235\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.839\nwhich stories fit into which sprint.\n\n236\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.990\nWhat we gotta make sure,\nas part of this planning,\n\n237\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.830\nis that the entire team\nunderstands what the user needs.\n\n238\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.400\nAnd this is a good time, by the way,\nwhen we're mapping out user stories.\n\n239\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.900\nThis is a good time to then hone your\nskills as an agile team to actually\n\n240\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:49.180\nconsider what skills are needed, in order\nto be able to produce each story and\n\n241\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.440\nto produce the functionality for\neach story.\n\n242\n00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.720\nNow's the time to raise your hand and say,\nhey, look, I think we need to do this, or\n\n243\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.430\nI think I need to learn this, or maybe\nyou're the best person to help with this.\n\n244\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.730\nThat's when we'll do\nthis during the planning.\n\n245\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.790\nYou don't want to be doing too much of\nthat during the development cuz we haven't\n\n246\n00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.296\ngot a lot of time.\n\n247\n00:14:08.296 --> 00:14:11.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorry, Jo, I'm just laughing.\n\n248\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.250\nI'm thinking about a movie\nI watched last night.\n\n249\n00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.890\nI know, [LAUGH] but\nI'm listening to you also but it was,\n\n250\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.490\nI don't know if anyone's seen it, Jumanji.\n\n251\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.120\nAnd that's exactly where these\nteams get thrown into this game,\n\n252\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.883\nI don't know if you've ever seen\nthe old Jumanji, but [CROSSTALK].\n\n253\n00:14:26.883 --> 00:14:27.920\n&gt;&gt; I've seen Jumanji.\n\n254\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so they play this crazy game.\n\n255\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.800\nBut they all have to work together and\neach one gets assigned to skill set.\n\n256\n00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.780\nAnd one of the clues was basically where\nsomeone had, they thought it was where\n\n257\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.420\nthey had to stare down to a staring\ncontest with some type of snake,\n\n258\n00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.720\nmaybe a boa constrictor or something.\n\n259\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.509\nAnd this girl is like,\nI'm awesome at that.\n\n260\n00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:55.590\n[LAUGH] Anyway,\nshe wasn't awesome at staring\n\n261\n00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.690\ncontest with a snake but\n[LAUGH] she thought she was.\n\n262\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.160\n&gt;&gt; I'm not too sure how you find out\nwhether you're awesome at staring\n\n263\n00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.750\na snake down.\n\n264\n00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.540\n&gt;&gt; I like just staring contests in\ngeneral and then she thought, well,\n\n265\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.368\nif I'm gonna do a staring contest,\nI must be good.\n\n266\n00:15:08.368 --> 00:15:13.160\nBut yes [LAUGH] that's the long way\nabout thinking who you should gets to\n\n267\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.690\nbuild those seats or\nthose individual going [LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.640\n&gt;&gt; I wonder.\n\n269\n00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.720\nWhat a change.\n\n270\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it ties back in right?\n\n271\n00:15:19.645 --> 00:15:20.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n272\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.790\nit does I'm also using\nexamples that's okay.\n\n273\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.994\n[LAUGH] Are you saying that, this is\nnow something we should be doing for\n\n274\n00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:30.120\nteam building exercising that [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n275\n00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.950\nWhy?\nMaybe we should take like a field trip to\n\n276\n00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.710\nHollywood and see how they do it?\n\n277\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:34.936\n&gt;&gt; But I'm okay with that.\n\n278\n00:15:34.936 --> 00:15:36.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm okay with the field trip to\n\n279\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.110\nstudios.\n\n280\n00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.820\nI'm not going anywhere near the snakes.\n\n281\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.735\nNot intentionally anyway.\n\n282\n00:15:41.735 --> 00:15:45.375\n[LAUGH] Let's get back to our stories and\nfor a moment.\n\n283\n00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:47.598\n[LAUGH] I know the type of story.\n\n284\n00:15:47.598 --> 00:15:50.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And let's just consider that and\n\n285\n00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.729\nthis should go without really saying\nanything, I shouldn't have to mention\n\n286\n00:15:55.729 --> 00:16:00.072\nthis, but nevertheless,\nsometimes I do, think about relevance.\n\n287\n00:16:00.072 --> 00:16:03.728\nRelevance to the influences who\nis the vision on the scope,\n\n288\n00:16:03.728 --> 00:16:08.810\nevery user story has to be relevant to\nthe vision of this particular project.\n\n289\n00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:17.022\nIf the project that we're working on is\nto implement a home shopping experience,\n\n290\n00:16:17.022 --> 00:16:21.069\nor a home grocery shopping experience,\n\n291\n00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:26.080\nthen the story should be\nrelevant to that vision.\n\n292\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.237\nWe shouldn't be compiling stories\nthat have got something to do with\n\n293\n00:16:30.237 --> 00:16:32.171\nbooking a train ticket online,\n\n294\n00:16:32.171 --> 00:16:36.560\nfor instance, that's not relevant\nto this particular project.\n\n295\n00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.600\nSo the user stories have got\nto be relevant to the vision.\n\n296\n00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.340\nThat's why I said it\nshould go without saying,\n\n297\n00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.390\nreally, cuz it should make perfect sense.\n\n298\n00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.003\nBut nevertheless,\nI've seen some stories that I've got very,\n\n299\n00:16:48.003 --> 00:16:50.629\nvery tenuous links to the vision and\nI thought,\n\n300\n00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:54.520\nyou just put that in there because\nyou wanted to really, didn't you?\n\n301\n00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.684\n[LAUGH] Don't expect to have\na definitive set of stories up front,\n\n302\n00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.419\nthat's another important point.\n\n303\n00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:03.855\nAnd it was something that we did\ncover in our fundamentals class,\n\n304\n00:17:03.855 --> 00:17:05.558\nbecause things change.\n\n305\n00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:07.567\nThat's the reason why we\nhave an agile project,\n\n306\n00:17:07.567 --> 00:17:09.720\nbecause we understand that things change.\n\n307\n00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.617\nSo our stories are going to change\nover time, and that's all right.\n\n308\n00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:19.590\nWe're gonna to bring in new stories over\nthe life of the project, and that's okay.\n\n309\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:24.122\nSo don't think that what you have\nright now is cast in stone and\n\n310\n00:17:24.122 --> 00:17:29.920\nthat it should always be this set\nof user stories and nothing else.\n\n311\n00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.728\nNo, that's not the case, and that set of\nuser stories is fine for right now, but\n\n312\n00:17:34.728 --> 00:17:37.909\nat the end of it each sprint,\nat the end of iteration,\n\n313\n00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:41.050\nwe're going to do a retrospective.\n\n314\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.550\nAnd we're going to reevaluate the stories\nthat we still have outstanding and\n\n315\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.330\nwe're also gonna make sure\nthat they're still relevant.\n\n316\n00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.250\nAnd therefore these things may change.\n\n317\n00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:55.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, they certainly do,\non an insanely rapid pace sometimes.\n\n318\n00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n319\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.635\n&gt;&gt; Just before the show we\nwere talking about all this,\n\n320\n00:17:58.635 --> 00:18:01.771\nat least I was talking about it, Jo may or\nmay not have been listening, but.\n\n321\n00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:03.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just said,\n\n322\n00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:08.084\nI can barely keep up with even just day\nto day tasks sometimes with the way\n\n323\n00:18:08.084 --> 00:18:11.511\ncompanies are constantly\nchanging everything.\n\n324\n00:18:11.511 --> 00:18:13.660\nAnd I-\n&gt;&gt; I was listening.\n\n325\n00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.429\nI was just rolling my eyes but\nit was going in, kind of.\n\n326\n00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:20.733\n&gt;&gt; Like some people, I feel bad for\nthem because it's more difficult for\n\n327\n00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:22.470\nothers to just keep up with all this.\n\n328\n00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.405\nWe gotta just be open and\nadapt to all that change.\n\n329\n00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:26.381\n&gt;&gt; We do, we do.\n\n330\n00:18:26.381 --> 00:18:28.433\nAnd this is why we have\nagile projects now,\n\n331\n00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:30.750\nit's because we have to adapt to change.\n\n332\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.270\nAnd actually what you said,\nand I was listening.\n\n333\n00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n334\n00:18:35.112 --> 00:18:37.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I promise I was listening.\n\n335\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.940\nWhat you said makes perfect sense\nin this agile environment because\n\n336\n00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.010\nI mentioned user personas before.\n\n337\n00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.390\nAnd what Cherokee had actually\nsaid earlier on was that\n\n338\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.530\nsome people struggle with technology.\n\n339\n00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.350\nAnd some people that are not exposed\nto technology on a daily basis, and\n\n340\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.980\nthere are people that aren't,\nthen they'll struggle with technology.\n\n341\n00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.900\nAnd simple things,\n\n342\n00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.910\nlike maybe paying bills,\nwork differently to how it used to work.\n\n343\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:08.430\nAnd again, from an agile perspective when\nyou are the person that's responsible for\n\n344\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.640\ndeveloping that particular\nfunctionality and\n\n345\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.670\ndeveloping that software, you've gotta\nthink about all of your user personas.\n\n346\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.740\nAnd guess what?\n\n347\n00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.460\nRight at the very\nbeginning of the project,\n\n348\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.160\nyou may not know all\nof your user personas.\n\n349\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.170\nAnd it may be because you're getting\nfeedback from your customers that actually\n\n350\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:30.070\ngives you more information to create\nanother type of user persona.\n\n351\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.540\nAnd, again, that's okay.\n\n352\n00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.370\nWe're in an agile environment,\nwe can do that.\n\n353\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.370\nStill be the same stories, perhaps, but\n\n354\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:41.150\nmaybe we've got one more user persona\nthat we didn't realize that we had.\n\n355\n00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.400\nAnd that's really important,\n\n356\n00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.840\nis that in that agile environment,\nwe accommodate change.\n\n357\n00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.830\nSo when it comes to user stories,\nand we spent quite a bit of time.\n\n358\n00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:56.208\nAnd in fact, you should really go back to\nour agile fundamentals course, because we\n\n359\n00:19:56.208 --> 00:20:01.830\nlooked at prioritizing and estimating user\nstories in our agile fundamentals course.\n\n360\n00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.005\nAnd we had some trick photography,\n\n361\n00:20:04.005 --> 00:20:07.460\nwe had some magic that\nhappened during that class.\n\n362\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:12.082\nSo I'm gonna ask you to go back to\nthat because we explain it in more\n\n363\n00:20:12.082 --> 00:20:13.183\ndetail there.\n\n364\n00:20:13.183 --> 00:20:15.217\nBut what we want to do, and\n\n365\n00:20:15.217 --> 00:20:19.109\nthe responsibility lies\nwith the product owner.\n\n366\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.828\nAnd that responsibility is for sizing or\n\n367\n00:20:24.828 --> 00:20:27.876\nestimating the stories.\n\n368\n00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:33.955\nThis is not the same as prioritizing,\nprioritizing is completely different.\n\n369\n00:20:33.955 --> 00:20:37.831\nPrioritizing is where we assign\na priority to each story.\n\n370\n00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:39.885\nSo maybe we've got 100 stories and\n\n371\n00:20:39.885 --> 00:20:44.745\nwe say, okay then, right, well, this story\nis priority one, this one's priority two,\n\n372\n00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:49.355\nthis is priority three,\nbased on the urgency that is required.\n\n373\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:56.800\nWhereas the sizing or estimating of\nthe story is based on the amount of\n\n374\n00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:03.850\neffort that it is going to take\nto deliver that particular story.\n\n375\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.584\nSo we look at this as\nthe relative size of the story.\n\n376\n00:21:08.584 --> 00:21:12.710\nI don't like the use of the word bigness,\nbut I guess bigness works.\n\n377\n00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.390\nIt's based roughly on\nthe Fibonacci sequence and\n\n378\n00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.380\nI'm glad our directors increased\nthis up to full size for us,\n\n379\n00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.760\nbecause you'll see everything is\nover on the right-hand side there.\n\n380\n00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:28.036\nAnd the Fibonacci sequence is actually\njust the sum of the two numbers before it,\n\n381\n00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:32.016\nso 1 add 1 equals 2, and\nthen 2 add 1 equals 3.\n\n382\n00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:38.813\nAnd then 3 add 2 equals 5, and\n5 add 3 equals 8 and 8 add 5 equals 13.\n\n383\n00:21:38.813 --> 00:21:39.959\nYeah, you get the jist?\n\n384\n00:21:39.959 --> 00:21:42.584\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're okay with that?\n\n385\n00:21:42.584 --> 00:21:46.950\nGood, so it's roughly based\non the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n386\n00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:54.080\nAnd the idea is that it's supposed\nto avoid arguments over which\n\n387\n00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.242\nstory is going to take\nthe longest to achieve.\n\n388\n00:21:59.242 --> 00:22:02.235\nIt doesn't necessarily avoid arguments,\nbut\n\n389\n00:22:02.235 --> 00:22:07.618\nas I've already said in previous episodes,\nwe should be working together as a team,\n\n390\n00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:10.715\nso we all be valuing\neach other's perspective.\n\n391\n00:22:10.715 --> 00:22:16.690\nBut we should be doing this in order\nto estimate how long it's going to or\n\n392\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.310\nhow big each particular story is.\n\n393\n00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.800\nAnd that will lead us then to estimate\nhow long its going to take to\n\n394\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.780\ncomplete each story.\n\n395\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.330\nWe have to bear in mind that\nin every single iteration,\n\n396\n00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:35.620\nwe only have a duration of between one and\nfour weeks for each iteration.\n\n397\n00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.494\nSo if you were to say, for instance,\n\n398\n00:22:37.494 --> 00:22:40.458\nthat we've got a story that we\nthink is going to take off and\n\n399\n00:22:40.458 --> 00:22:43.923\nwe might use ideal days and\nwe'll talk about that in a little while.\n\n400\n00:22:43.923 --> 00:22:48.838\nBut if you think that you've got\na story that might take you three\n\n401\n00:22:48.838 --> 00:22:52.388\nweeks to complete,\nare you now going to try and\n\n402\n00:22:52.388 --> 00:22:56.870\nbring another two-week story\ninto that same iteration?\n\n403\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.123\nThere's no right or\n\n404\n00:23:00.123 --> 00:23:03.993\nwrong answer to that cuz it depends\non how many developers you've got.\n\n405\n00:23:03.993 --> 00:23:07.972\nBut I would say be very, very careful\nbecause when you say that it's gonna take\n\n406\n00:23:07.972 --> 00:23:10.760\nthree weeks to complete,\ndoes that include testing?\n\n407\n00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:17.074\nProbably not, and\nyou gotta test before you can measure any\n\n408\n00:23:17.074 --> 00:23:20.869\nparticular functionality for\nits dominance.\n\n409\n00:23:20.869 --> 00:23:24.840\nSo it has to be tested, which will\ntake that three weeks into probably\n\n410\n00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.000\nfour weeks whilst we accommodate\nthe testing as well.\n\n411\n00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.222\nSo the product owner has\nthe responsibility for\n\n412\n00:23:33.222 --> 00:23:37.105\nensuring that this happens\nalong with the prioritization.\n\n413\n00:23:37.105 --> 00:23:41.414\nBut remember from a previous episode\nwhen we looked at the characteristics of\n\n414\n00:23:41.414 --> 00:23:45.385\nthe product owner and we looked at\nwho the product owner would be?\n\n415\n00:23:45.385 --> 00:23:50.360\nIt's not necessary somebody with\na technical background, or not a hugely\n\n416\n00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.510\ntechnical background anyway, it could\nbe somebody with a business background.\n\n417\n00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:58.413\nIt should certainly be somebody\nthat understands the business and\n\n418\n00:23:58.413 --> 00:24:01.069\nunderstands what it is\nthe users want to see.\n\n419\n00:24:01.069 --> 00:24:06.266\nThat means that when it comes to\nestimating, when it comes to sizing\n\n420\n00:24:06.266 --> 00:24:11.738\nthe stories, the product owner's role\nis to make sure that the stories\n\n421\n00:24:11.738 --> 00:24:16.680\nare sized and is to assist with\nthe prioritization of the story.\n\n422\n00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:23.350\nBut the product owner may not be in\na position to advise on the sizing,\n\n423\n00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.400\nbecause the product owner may\nnot be a technical person.\n\n424\n00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.750\nSo for this particular episode,\nfor our part two on user\n\n425\n00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:38.750\nstories then I want you to, as I've\nalready mentioned, go back into our\n\n426\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:45.160\nepisode in one of our previous\nseries on agile fundamentals.\n\n427\n00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.086\nYeah, and you will see how\nwe have used the magic of-\n\n428\n00:24:49.086 --> 00:24:50.076\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n429\n00:24:50.076 --> 00:24:55.299\n&gt;&gt; Of film [LAUGH] to bring\nin some examples for you.\n\n430\n00:24:55.299 --> 00:24:57.454\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat was pretty cool cuz like you said,\n\n431\n00:24:57.454 --> 00:25:01.049\nand even if that product owner doesn't,\nthe way that we talked about doing it\n\n432\n00:25:01.049 --> 00:25:03.845\ninvolves the actual developers\nto help give their inputs.\n\n433\n00:25:03.845 --> 00:25:07.907\nSo that technical experience is\ncompensated for by the actual developers.\n\n434\n00:25:07.907 --> 00:25:11.165\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'd expect the developers\nto be able to do this.\n\n435\n00:25:11.165 --> 00:25:13.352\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is the product owner is the person\n\n436\n00:25:13.352 --> 00:25:14.899\nthat makes sure it happens, but\n\n437\n00:25:14.899 --> 00:25:18.240\nthe developers are people\nthat actually perform that.\n\n438\n00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.630\nSo in our next episode when we come back,\nwe're going to be looking\n\n439\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:25.850\na little bit more at planning and most\nspecifically our five levels of planning.\n\n440\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, thank you so\nmuch for being here and thank you for\n\n441\n00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:29.040\nbeing here as well.\n\n442\n00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.540\nBut for now, let's sign out.\n\n443\n00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.961\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n444\n00:25:31.961 --> 00:25:32.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n445\n00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.702\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n446\n00:25:35.702 --> 00:25:41.181\n[MUSIC]\n\n447\n00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:44.272\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

including\n\n9\n00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.080\nvision, as well as road maps.\n\n10\n00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.180\nAnd with us today back in studio is, we\nhave the ever so exciting Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.410\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n12\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.808\n&gt;&gt; She must have not a lot to\ndo today if this is exciting.\n\n13\n00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:34.410\n&gt;&gt; I just had a cupcake, so\nthis is what happens, yeah.\n\n14\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.051\n&gt;&gt; Sugar, sugar.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] like [SOUND] and\n\n15\n00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:37.240\nthen it's gonna crash.\n\n16\n00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.030\nSo, this should be a really\ninteresting episode.\n\n17\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.888\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cherokee for having me.\n\n18\n00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:49.400\n&gt;&gt; No but this is kind of interesting\nbecause we're talking about\n\n19\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.090\nfive levels of planning and.\n\n20\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but you are the only person\nthat I know that's had to plan how to\n\n21\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.960\neat a cupcake.\n\n22\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.025\nAnd I am not joking at this point in time.\n\n23\n00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:02.736\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Somebody I know, not too far away, has\n\n24\n00:01:02.736 --> 00:01:06.001\njust had to look up a life hack on how to\n&gt;&gt; I didn't look it up,\n\n25\n00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.420\nI already have it in here.\n\n26\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.635\n&gt;&gt; How to eat a cupcake.\n\n27\n00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What have we evolved into?\n\n28\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.620\nI ask myself.\n\n29\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.580\n[LAUGH] So while we're planning,\nhow about we plan our project then?\n\n30\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.740\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWhere do we start?\n\n31\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.730\nLevel one?\n\n32\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.770\nLevel five?\n\n33\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'd like to go in\nstraight in at level five but\n\n34\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.240\nit's not really gonna be practical, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.260\nIt's generally the way\nI want to do things.\n\n36\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.040\nBut no,\nnot when it comes to our project, no.\n\n37\n00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.920\n&gt;&gt; There are all sorts of\ndifferent approaches about things.\n\n38\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.470\nI don't even remember certain things\nlike split horizon, no that's something,\n\n39\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.300\na different technology.\n\n40\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.230\nBut split middle, where they start at\nthe middle and work your way either up or\n\n41\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.140\ndown and different types of-\n&gt;&gt; We're going to start at the high level\n\n42\n00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.545\nand then get more detailed.\n\n43\n00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:44.275\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n44\n00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:48.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's keep it simple, we like\nthat in Agile, we like to keep it simple,\n\n45\n00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:49.825\nso let's keep it simple.\n\n46\n00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:50.595\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n47\n00:01:50.595 --> 00:01:54.805\n&gt;&gt; Let's start off at the high level and\nthen let's work our way down and\n\n48\n00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:59.827\nthen as we get more detailed than we\ncan get more detailed in that planning.\n\n49\n00:01:59.827 --> 00:02:03.787\nAnd actually, while we're talking about\nthat, it's one of the things that I want\n\n50\n00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:07.057\nto mention, when it comes to Agile,\nnow, this is something that really\n\n51\n00:02:07.057 --> 00:02:10.377\nkind of encroaches into\nthe realm of the scrub master.\n\n52\n00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:13.917\nBut we might as well talk about it now,\nwhile we're talking about planning\n\n53\n00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:19.040\niterations and planning our user stories\nand which to include and which iteration.\n\n54\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.920\nYou plan a short term in detail, then you\nplan the long term at a higher level.\n\n55\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.670\nAnd you do that because quite simply,\n\n56\n00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.860\neach iteration depends on\nthe success of the last.\n\n57\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.440\nOr rather each iteration depends\non the progress of the last.\n\n58\n00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.810\nSo, if we're planning a huge long project.\n\n59\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.390\nWe certainly not going to plan two years\nin advance, not to any great detail.\n\n60\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.560\nBecause if we do that, we know that\nthe things are going to change.\n\n61\n00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.460\nThis is an Agile environment and\nwe welcome change.\n\n62\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.960\nSo therefore we plan the iteration and we\ndon't plan anything else in great detail.\n\n63\n00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.350\nWe'll have a high-level plan but\nnothing else in great detail.\n\n64\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.620\nYou looked as though you had a question?\n\n65\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.518\n&gt;&gt; And just something to add to that,\nthat I had heard recently,\n\n66\n00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:08.040\nthat I thought was pretty wise.\n\n67\n00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.660\nAnd it kind of goes with\nwhat you're saying, here.\n\n68\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm worried.\n\n69\n00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.070\n&gt;&gt; Are you worried?\n\n70\n00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.392\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nyou can see I'm worried but yeah, go on.\n\n71\n00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:16.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it was a specific situation,\n\n72\n00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.400\nwhere one of my co-workers had said that\nthey didn't jump on top of a project right\n\n73\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.410\naway, simply because in their past\nexperiences, it was not always that that\n\n74\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.110\nproject would still be as important or\nperhaps even exist in a couple of days or\n\n75\n00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.230\neven a week from the time that\nis was originally talked about.\n\n76\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.380\nBecause there wasn't any like serious\naction, item attached to it like hey,\n\n77\n00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.350\nwe need this by this particular\ndeadline and sure enough, by that,\n\n78\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.660\nwithin a couple of days, it wasn't\neven a project that would've existed,\n\n79\n00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.110\nso or a task that would have existed.\n\n80\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.030\nSo it would have been wasted time for\n\n81\n00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.001\nthem to really focus in on something\nthat wasn't even an issue at that.\n\n82\n00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:00.440\n&gt;&gt; And\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense.\n\n83\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.715\n&gt;&gt; No, it makes perfect sense,\nI understand what she is saying.\n\n84\n00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:07.660\n[LAUGH] But yeah,\nit does make perfect sense.\n\n85\n00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.550\nWith, when you look at the traditional\nwaterfall type approach,\n\n86\n00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.960\nwhen you look at PMI or PMP and you look\nat traditional approaches like Prince 2,\n\n87\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.500\nas well, then we're looking at\na project that has a long lifespan.\n\n88\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.030\nAnd because it has a long lifespan,\n\n89\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.180\ninvariably what happens is we\nend up investing money up front.\n\n90\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.030\nAnd we end up investing in the planning\nand in getting the project team together\n\n91\n00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.040\nand in doing all of the admin,\nthe documentation, etc.\n\n92\n00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.630\nAnd maybe we have to go out to tender,\nwe have to issue an ITT,\n\n93\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.260\nan Invitation To Tender for our suppliers\nand we do evaluations on suppliers, etc.\n\n94\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.310\nAnd we do a lot of that upfront.\n\n95\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.130\nA lot of this is a lot of work upfront and\nso, that's a lot of investment upfront.\n\n96\n00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.270\nWhen you invest upfront, traditionally,\nyou don't particularly like to change as\n\n97\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.990\nyou then go through the project because\nyou've already invested this work in\n\n98\n00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.020\nthe planning, you've already\ninvested this work in the design.\n\n99\n00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.720\nAnd now you don't wanna make changes\ncuz that's going to cost more money.\n\n100\n00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.790\nAnd so,\n\n101\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.658\nthat why we end up in this situation where\nwith the traditional water fall approach,\n\n102\n00:05:15.658 --> 00:05:20.970\nyou'll find that organizations are very\nwary about actually investing money.\n\n103\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.250\nSo, somebody comes up with an idea,\nit seems like a great idea.\n\n104\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.290\nThe business case is submitted and\nthe evaluation is done and\n\n105\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.260\nthen it's considered to\nbe not too important.\n\n106\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.030\nAnd maybe not too important actually\nmeans, we dont have the money for it.\n\n107\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.630\nThe traditional agile approach will take\na look at the project as a whole but\n\n108\n00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.200\nbecause we actually split out the project\ninto chunks, it means that the money that\n\n109\n00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.850\nwe've got for the project, well for\na start, we can divide that up into\n\n110\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.370\nthe chunks and into the chunks\nare sort of development but also,\n\n111\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.280\nwe acknowledge the developments going to\nchange and we acknowledge that our plans\n\n112\n00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.390\nare going to change, so we don't invest so\nheavily in all of the planning upfront.\n\n113\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.070\nWhat we actually do is we plan for\neach iteration upfront but\n\n114\n00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.300\nwe only plan for the entire length\nof the project at high level.\n\n115\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.540\nWith the traditional water fall approach,\nwe're more prone to try and\n\n116\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.870\nplan for the entire project in detail.\n\n117\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.300\nAnd we produce the Gantt charts and\n\n118\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.750\neverything else with all\nof the estimated end dates.\n\n119\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.290\nHow many times do you know of a project,\na traditional water fall approach\n\n120\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.420\nproject that's actually\ndelivered on time and to budget?\n\n121\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.800\nI know that there are some out there.\n\n122\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.800\nAnd don't get me wrong, it does happen.\n\n123\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.440\nBut it's very few and far between.\n\n124\n00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.210\nMore often than not,\nwe expect a project to overrun.\n\n125\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.010\nWe even add contingency into our projects,\nespecially for this,\n\n126\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.150\nin both time and with money as well.\n\n127\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.300\nWith a natural approach, we are looking at\n\n128\n00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.035\neach iteration in detail but\nwe're not planning out too far ahead and\n\n129\n00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:05.255\nonce we have an overview of\nthe amount of money that we need.\n\n130\n00:07:05.255 --> 00:07:08.110\nOnce we have a high level of\ndescription of what we need.\n\n131\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.350\nBecause we are dividing\nit into user stories.\n\n132\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.982\nWe're able to achieve something\nin a short period of time.\n\n133\n00:07:16.982 --> 00:07:21.800\nAnd sometimes, that momentum builds up and\nthe visibility happens.\n\n134\n00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.450\nAnd therefore,\nwe get the committment from the business.\n\n135\n00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.280\nThe one thing that the business\ndoesn't want to do and\n\n136\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.840\nthis happens with that\ntraditional waterfall approach,\n\n137\n00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.720\nis invest all this money up front and\nthen see nothing for the next two years.\n\n138\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.080\nThey don't wanna do that.\n\n139\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.850\nAnd so, with Agile, we have\na completely different approach and\n\n140\n00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:39.890\na completely different mindset.\n\n141\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.180\nSo, I completely understand\nhow that would happen and\n\n142\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.970\nwe're avoiding that completely here.\n\n143\n00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:47.840\n&gt;&gt; I get everything.\n\n144\n00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.170\nThere's one thing that I.\n\n145\n00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.160\nYou said Tindr.\n\n146\n00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.181\nIs that an acronym?\n\n147\n00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:53.379\nOr is that a British word?\n\n148\n00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:55.247\nI need some help here.\n\n149\n00:07:55.247 --> 00:07:59.635\nBecause tinder is an American context.\n\n150\n00:07:59.635 --> 00:08:03.122\nNot like dollars but there's also an app.\n\n151\n00:08:03.122 --> 00:08:04.086\nIt's like a dating app.\n\n152\n00:08:04.086 --> 00:08:07.079\nAnd it's- And I don't think\nthat's what you're talking about.\n\n153\n00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:10.158\n&gt;&gt; My goodness, that's Tinder not tender.\n\n154\n00:08:10.158 --> 00:08:11.936\n&gt;&gt; Tinder.\n\n155\n00:08:11.936 --> 00:08:12.575\nTender.\n\n156\n00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.343\nI can't believe you're\nhaving this conversation.\n\n157\n00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:15.869\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n158\n00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:20.472\n[LAUGH] I don't know why they're\ngoing from there, really?\n\n159\n00:08:20.472 --> 00:08:22.379\nInvitation to Tender, right?\n\n160\n00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:23.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what does that mean?\n\n161\n00:08:23.278 --> 00:08:27.232\n&gt;&gt; An ITT is when you go out to\ndifferent suppliers [LAUGH] and\n\n162\n00:08:27.232 --> 00:08:29.263\ndifferent organizations.\n\n163\n00:08:29.263 --> 00:08:32.909\nI know, look, put it this way, if you're\nasking the question there's somebody there\n\n164\n00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.301\nthat is asking the question too.\n\n165\n00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:38.102\nIf an invitation to tenders where\nyou got different suppliers.\n\n166\n00:08:38.102 --> 00:08:42.945\nAnd you ask them to bid to\nsupply you with certain-\n\n167\n00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:44.281\n&gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha.\n\n168\n00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:49.414\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's hardware or it's software,\nso you'd issue an ITT, an Invitation\n\n169\n00:08:49.414 --> 00:08:54.101\nto Tender just to say sometimes recall\nit in RFP, Request For Proposal.\n\n170\n00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:57.379\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Where we'd go out and we'd just simply\n\n171\n00:08:57.379 --> 00:09:03.415\nsay okay, we are going to invite you and\nto bid for this particular piece of work.\n\n172\n00:09:03.415 --> 00:09:05.937\nIt's very, very common in public sector.\n\n173\n00:09:05.937 --> 00:09:09.852\nSo in government environments,\nwell, it's not just very common,\n\n174\n00:09:09.852 --> 00:09:11.885\nit's mandatory in public sector.\n\n175\n00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.841\nBecause we are using tax payers money,\ntherefore we have to demonstrate that we\n\n176\n00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:19.161\nused tax payers money wisely and\nthat we've used it impartially.\n\n177\n00:09:19.161 --> 00:09:21.469\nSo it's a mandatory requirement.\n\n178\n00:09:21.469 --> 00:09:26.180\nAnd it gets very difficult when you are\ndoing that in a waterfall project because\n\n179\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.538\nyou know what the tended process itself\ntakes up to 2 years to go through in\n\n180\n00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:32.245\ngovernment environments.\n\n181\n00:09:32.245 --> 00:09:35.726\nThis is how we end up in government\nenvironments with contracts that\n\n182\n00:09:35.726 --> 00:09:36.651\nare negotiated.\n\n183\n00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:39.120\nNone of that, this kind in the side but\n\n184\n00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.761\nthis is how we end up with contracts\nthat are negotiated for five years.\n\n185\n00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:49.286\nWith specific surprise in government\nbecause the tend to processes itself,\n\n186\n00:09:49.286 --> 00:09:51.512\nwell it actually-\n&gt;&gt; Quite cumbersome.\n\n187\n00:09:51.512 --> 00:09:56.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very, very cumbersome and it\nreally is a case of crossing every T and\n\n188\n00:09:56.827 --> 00:10:02.236\ndotting every single I, because we have\nto demonstrate complete impartiality.\n\n189\n00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:06.999\nWhen we are selecting\na supplier within government.\n\n190\n00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:09.704\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it's really difficult but\n\n191\n00:10:09.704 --> 00:10:14.621\nit's all about tendering for something and\ncan we just please stay away from,\n\n192\n00:10:14.621 --> 00:10:16.836\nyeah,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:10:16.836 --> 00:10:18.714\n&gt;&gt; Let's pretend that never happened.\n\n194\n00:10:18.714 --> 00:10:21.198\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right Joe.\n\n195\n00:10:21.198 --> 00:10:22.340\n&gt;&gt; Let's get us to show some planning.\n\n196\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.720\n&gt;&gt; it's our secret, right?\n\n197\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.214\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah, or maybe not now.\n\n198\n00:10:26.214 --> 00:10:29.358\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go on to planning then I'll\n\n199\n00:10:29.358 --> 00:10:30.213\napologize, shall we?\n\n200\n00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:34.785\nIn planning some agile is opposed to\nplanning on our waterfall project.\n\n201\n00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:39.307\nSo we learnt to split our agile\nplanning into five labels.\n\n202\n00:10:39.307 --> 00:10:43.918\nAnd as I've said to you, we keep\neverything at a high level at the time\n\n203\n00:10:43.918 --> 00:10:48.541\nthe short term and we've got five\nlevels of planning with our Agile.\n\n204\n00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.501\nAnd you'll see on the slide that\nyou've got in front of you,\n\n205\n00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:55.581\nby now as if by magic look at that, you're\nmissing a little bit of a quarter of this.\n\n206\n00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:58.493\nSo Taylor our director, look, see,\n\n207\n00:10:58.493 --> 00:11:02.407\nhe knows what I want before I even ask for\nit, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:02.407 --> 00:11:05.452\nWhat's in front of you at the moment then,\nis a five levels.\n\n209\n00:11:05.452 --> 00:11:10.850\nVision, Roadmap, Release,\nAsprint and Daily planning.\n\n210\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.607\nSo you see the division\nsort of high level, and\n\n211\n00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:16.661\nwe're planning that\n6-12 months in advance.\n\n212\n00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:17.919\nAnd look at that, it's,\n\n213\n00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:21.764\nit's asking you what type of planning\nthat you're going to do for your vision.\n\n214\n00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:24.105\nAnd we call this an elevator pitch for\nour vision.\n\n215\n00:11:24.105 --> 00:11:25.616\nDo you know what an elevator pitch is?\n\n216\n00:11:25.616 --> 00:11:26.589\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n217\n00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:29.325\n&gt;&gt; would you want to\nexplain it to everybody?\n\n218\n00:11:29.325 --> 00:11:33.075\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just a short,\n\n219\n00:11:33.075 --> 00:11:37.974\n[CROSSTALK] I'm not a sales person.\n\n220\n00:11:37.974 --> 00:11:40.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hold on now, I got this, I got this.\n\n221\n00:11:40.144 --> 00:11:43.558\nIt's a short explanation about, it can\neither be about you as an individual as\n\n222\n00:11:43.558 --> 00:11:46.734\nan individual if you're like\nan independent contractor or something.\n\n223\n00:11:46.734 --> 00:11:50.654\nBut if you work for company, it should\njust be like a quick, I don't know\n\n224\n00:11:50.654 --> 00:11:55.026\nthe time on it maybe 60 seconds, maybe\na minute and a half but it's the time that\n\n225\n00:11:55.026 --> 00:11:56.985\nyou will stuck in an elevator-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n226\n00:11:56.985 --> 00:11:58.109\n&gt;&gt; Going to the different floors.\n\n227\n00:11:58.109 --> 00:11:58.755\n&gt;&gt; Yep, perfect.\n\n228\n00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:01.431\n&gt;&gt; And you need to explain\nwhat your business does and\n\n229\n00:12:01.431 --> 00:12:04.757\nyou need to make it like exciting but\nin a short amount of time.\n\n230\n00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:08.602\n&gt;&gt; Right, so in this context then\nit's pretty much exactly the same.\n\n231\n00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:12.451\nIt's gotta be something that's\nreally short, really succinct, so\n\n232\n00:12:12.451 --> 00:12:14.288\nthey're directed to the point.\n\n233\n00:12:14.288 --> 00:12:18.147\nBut it's not a sales pitch, so\nit doesn't have to sound dynamic and\n\n234\n00:12:18.147 --> 00:12:20.865\nit doesn't have to come\nwith the huge fan fare.\n\n235\n00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:24.325\nIt really is just a vision for\nthe project.\n\n236\n00:12:24.325 --> 00:12:26.653\nBut it's just really, really high level,\njust the vision for the project.\n\n237\n00:12:26.653 --> 00:12:28.232\nThis is what we are going to do.\n\n238\n00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:32.874\nAnd in the previous episode, we looked\nat an example of delivering an app\n\n239\n00:12:32.874 --> 00:12:37.820\nthat would or creating an app that would\nallow end users customers to log on and\n\n240\n00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.341\nbuy their groceries,\ntheir shopping online, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:44.292\nSo that's it, and that's our vision.\n\n242\n00:12:44.292 --> 00:12:46.573\nNow, our vision is gonna\nbe very high level.\n\n243\n00:12:46.573 --> 00:12:51.628\nBut you've also, in your vision, you have\nto state what it is you want to achieve,\n\n244\n00:12:51.628 --> 00:12:54.390\nand you have to state\nwho is going to benefit.\n\n245\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:59.321\nIn other words, you have to in that\nparticular pitch there, you have\n\n246\n00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:04.254\nto say well, what are the benefits\nto this particular new feature and\n\n247\n00:13:04.254 --> 00:13:07.291\nnew product\n&gt;&gt; Like why would I wanna use that one?\n\n248\n00:13:07.291 --> 00:13:11.665\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so you gotta really\nout loud who's going to benefit.\n\n249\n00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:17.382\nAnd also you want a very high level\npotential return on investment.\n\n250\n00:13:17.382 --> 00:13:20.131\nAnd I think about one that\nI did not that long ago,\n\n251\n00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:22.557\nliterally within the past couple of days.\n\n252\n00:13:22.557 --> 00:13:29.811\nWhen we are doing some marketing\nwork on some of our series here.\n\n253\n00:13:29.811 --> 00:13:32.661\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And I have to, [LAUGH] yeah, I know,\n\n254\n00:13:32.661 --> 00:13:34.284\nme, me of all people.\n\n255\n00:13:34.284 --> 00:13:36.504\nI have to write a very\nquick elevator pitch for\n\n256\n00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:39.602\none of the series that we have here and\nit literally is just hey,\n\n257\n00:13:39.602 --> 00:13:42.480\nlook, here's some benefits\nof this particular series.\n\n258\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.516\nThis is what you're going to\nget if you watch this series.\n\n259\n00:13:45.516 --> 00:13:47.369\nAnd that's what we mean by elevator pitch.\n\n260\n00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:51.358\nSomething that's literally gonna\nlast couple of seconds and\n\n261\n00:13:51.358 --> 00:13:53.281\nit shouldn't be technical.\n\n262\n00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:55.963\nThat's a pitfall that we fall into in IT.\n\n263\n00:13:55.963 --> 00:13:57.644\nIt shouldn't be technical,\n\n264\n00:13:57.644 --> 00:14:01.283\nit should be something that\nsenior management can understand.\n\n265\n00:14:01.283 --> 00:14:03.926\nAnd then underneath that\nwe have our roadmap,\n\n266\n00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:07.598\nand our roadmap is, how long we\nexpect that project to last for?\n\n267\n00:14:07.598 --> 00:14:13.515\nAnd so, what chunks can we\nsplit that project into?\n\n268\n00:14:13.515 --> 00:14:15.911\nHow long is it going to last for roughly?\n\n269\n00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:18.972\nAnd what chunks can we\nsplit the project into?\n\n270\n00:14:18.972 --> 00:14:24.054\nNow, you'll notice that happens sort\nof between this is one to three months,\n\n271\n00:14:24.054 --> 00:14:26.678\nthat really is like, is it like expiry.\n\n272\n00:14:26.678 --> 00:14:30.931\nSo you don't wanna plan your road map\nany more than three months in advance.\n\n273\n00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:35.363\nPlanning for one month in advance,\nthat's generally something that we do for\n\n274\n00:14:35.363 --> 00:14:37.927\nrelease, that's probably to much detail.\n\n275\n00:14:37.927 --> 00:14:42.159\nSo I would usually recommend that your\nroadmap planning despite the fact that\n\n276\n00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:46.864\nyou've put your high level goal that will\ngo into sort of 12 months into the future.\n\n277\n00:14:46.864 --> 00:14:52.936\nThat's your vision, three months,\nthat's a good time frame for your roadmap.\n\n278\n00:14:52.936 --> 00:14:55.920\nAnd then underneath we've got our release.\n\n279\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.540\nAnd planning for our release involves\nnot just the product owner, but\n\n280\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.601\nalso the scrub master as well, because\nhe's gonna organize the team, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:03.601 --> 00:15:08.029\nAnd that is really working\nout exactly what users\n\n282\n00:15:08.029 --> 00:15:12.569\nstories are going to be\nincluded in each release.\n\n283\n00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:17.111\nNow, and each iteration which\nis included in each release, so\n\n284\n00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:19.928\nwhat iterations are gonna be included?\n\n285\n00:15:19.928 --> 00:15:24.196\nNow, that has to be in greater detail.\n\n286\n00:15:24.196 --> 00:15:26.643\nWe're getting into the short\ntime frames now, so\n\n287\n00:15:26.643 --> 00:15:28.572\nwe're talking about greater detail.\n\n288\n00:15:28.572 --> 00:15:34.029\nAnd we really, really want to know,\nfrom a stability perspective,\n\n289\n00:15:34.029 --> 00:15:38.450\nwe want to know, what we're doing for\nthe next month and\n\n290\n00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.667\nwe want to know what's in this release.\n\n291\n00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:46.122\nAnd then, with each iteration, with\neach sprint, as we want to call it here,\n\n292\n00:15:46.122 --> 00:15:49.842\nwith each iteration then,\nwe've got a plan for each iteration.\n\n293\n00:15:49.842 --> 00:15:52.841\nAnd again, that's the product owner,\nand the scrub master.\n\n294\n00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:56.928\nThe scrub masters gotta find\nthe resources, and the product owner is\n\n295\n00:15:56.928 --> 00:16:01.451\nthe person that has to say yes, okay,\nthese are what stories are included.\n\n296\n00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:06.026\nAnd then every day, and\nwe all know this, we've seen this right\n\n297\n00:16:06.026 --> 00:16:11.277\nthe through all of our classes and\nwe see it here as well, working as we do,\n\n298\n00:16:11.277 --> 00:16:16.190\nwe have every day, our daily 15\nminute stand up as we call it.\n\n299\n00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.930\nAnd our stand up is literally\nwhere we go around the room and\n\n300\n00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:26.870\njust find out exactly how everybody is\nplanning on spending the rest of that day.\n\n301\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.535\nIf they've got any particular\nproblems that they need to overcome.\n\n302\n00:16:31.535 --> 00:16:35.810\nAnd maybe working together,\nhow we can collaborate with each other.\n\n303\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.610\nAnd sometimes, remember we gotta\nbe fun about, this as, well, yeah,\n\n304\n00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.170\nsometimes we have a bit of a laugh too.\n\n305\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.020\n&gt;&gt; Usually at my expense.\n\n306\n00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.970\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't this morning.\n\n307\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:45.888\nI think it was at mine.\n\n308\n00:16:45.888 --> 00:16:50.721\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, so\n\n309\n00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:55.431\nlet's take a look then, in this particular\nepisode we're just gonna spend a bit of\n\n310\n00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:59.890\ntime looking at our vision, planning\nour vision, and planning our roadmap.\n\n311\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.720\nNow remember, these are quite high level.\n\n312\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.690\nSo you're talking 12 months out.\n\n313\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.290\nAnd you're talking three months out.\n\n314\n00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.950\nSo what is our vision?\n\n315\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.630\nRemember our elevator pitch.\n\n316\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:15.520\nSo our vision then, well it's just lays\nout that picture of the future and\n\n317\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.700\ndescribes the customers and\nwhat their needs are and\n\n318\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.273\nhow we want to meet their needs.\n\n319\n00:17:22.273 --> 00:17:24.680\nNot in a detailed way.\n\n320\n00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.545\nIt's a vision, it's a high level.\n\n321\n00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:29.746\nSo how we're going to meet\nthose needs going forward.\n\n322\n00:17:29.746 --> 00:17:33.802\nBut it is just high level it's just,\nI like the word essence,\n\n323\n00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:39.110\nit's just the essence of the product,\nit's nothing in any great detail.\n\n324\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.550\nAnd it just guides the team.\n\n325\n00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.800\nAnd we've gotta ensure\nthat the stakeholders\n\n326\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.280\nare on board with this as well.\n\n327\n00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.160\nWhich is why we talk about\nhaving an elevator pitch.\n\n328\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.510\nBecause even though we're not selling\nanything, this is really part of hey,\n\n329\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.760\nlook, this is what we're doing, okay?\n\n330\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.991\nThis is what we want to do and\nthis is what we want.\n\n331\n00:17:57.991 --> 00:17:59.450\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and get that buy in.\n\n332\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly that.\n\n333\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.577\nAnd if we get it right,\nit should motivate, it should inspire.\n\n334\n00:18:06.577 --> 00:18:11.348\nI'm not sure about the word\ninspire [LAUGH] I think sometimes\n\n335\n00:18:11.348 --> 00:18:14.888\nthat can be a little\nbit too inspirational.\n\n336\n00:18:14.888 --> 00:18:16.702\n[LAUGH] I think that can be\na little bit aspirational-\n\n337\n00:18:16.702 --> 00:18:18.333\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I think it depends on\n\n338\n00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:21.094\nwhat it is you're doing\nthough because like for us,\n\n339\n00:18:21.094 --> 00:18:25.361\nI feel inspired a lot of times whenever\nwe're talking about what we're doing and\n\n340\n00:18:25.361 --> 00:18:28.648\nwhat we're gonna be doing, but\nmaybe not in every industry.\n\n341\n00:18:28.648 --> 00:18:31.310\n&gt;&gt; I think also it's\na cultural thing as well.\n\n342\n00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:36.232\nWe've been talking today\nabout the way that I'm mean.\n\n343\n00:18:36.232 --> 00:18:42.110\n[LAUGH] I'm cruel and harsh and\nevil and mean, and I'm okay with that.\n\n344\n00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.770\nAnd I think that it is very\nmuch a cultural thing.\n\n345\n00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:50.640\nI don't think that us Brits do very,\nvery well at the motivational speeches and\n\n346\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.860\nthe rallying cries and\nthat sort of thing, you know.\n\n347\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.225\nWe kind of, just tell us as it is right,\nthat's all we wanna know.\n\n348\n00:18:57.225 --> 00:18:59.122\nSo I think there's something along.\n\n349\n00:18:59.122 --> 00:19:00.495\n&gt;&gt; A different culture that's here,\nthat's all.\n\n350\n00:19:00.495 --> 00:19:01.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.\n\n351\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.675\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n352\n00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:06.815\n&gt;&gt; And that's quite important for\nus to know when we are defining a vision.\n\n353\n00:19:06.815 --> 00:19:10.667\nBut if you're managing a project,\nknow who your team are.\n\n354\n00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:14.539\nYou have to understand that you're\ngonna have a difference in skills, but\n\n355\n00:19:14.539 --> 00:19:18.910\nyou're also gonna have, in the same way\nthat you've got different user personas.\n\n356\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.880\nYou're gonna have different personas,\ndifferent personalities within your team.\n\n357\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.535\nAnd so understand who your team are and\nwhat they respond well to and\n\n358\n00:19:26.535 --> 00:19:28.150\nwhat motivates them.\n\n359\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.537\nAll right, ham in a rousing speech\nevery day about how we're going to,\n\n360\n00:19:32.537 --> 00:19:35.159\nI don't know, we're-\n&gt;&gt; Do you like TED talks?\n\n361\n00:19:35.159 --> 00:19:36.549\n&gt;&gt; Conquer the world.\n\n362\n00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:37.730\nNo, not especially.\n\n363\n00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.519\n&gt;&gt; Okay, see I love TED talks, so.\n\n364\n00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:41.189\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n365\n00:19:41.189 --> 00:19:42.461\nIt is a cultural thing.\n\n366\n00:19:42.461 --> 00:19:49.820\nYeah, I'm not saying\nthat we don't use those.\n\n367\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.080\nI'm not saying that we don't watch those.\n\n368\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.840\nBut certainly, we are driven by fact\nmore than anything else, show me.\n\n369\n00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.850\nAnd in fact, you'll find me that\nif I'm managing a project or\n\n370\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.380\neven when it comes to maybe implementing\nthe framework like Agile or\n\n371\n00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.830\nimplementing ITIL, then I'll be the first\none to stand there going, show me.\n\n372\n00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:11.870\nI don't wanna hear about it.\n\n373\n00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.900\nI don't wanna hear about what\nyou're going to do, show me.\n\n374\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.570\nAnd we had evidence of that actually\nin our stand up this morning.\n\n375\n00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.183\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n376\n00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:20.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and again, it was by a Brit.\n\n377\n00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:24.633\nSo [LAUGH] which was stop with\nthe motivational stuff and\n\n378\n00:20:24.633 --> 00:20:27.514\nlet's get to the facts and figures.\n\n379\n00:20:27.514 --> 00:20:30.634\nSo yeah,\nI think some of that is a cultural thing.\n\n380\n00:20:30.634 --> 00:20:32.930\nI don't want somebody to inspire me,\n\n381\n00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.750\nI just want somebody to show me\nthat they're doing something.\n\n382\n00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.649\nBut the vision should be clear and stable.\n\n383\n00:20:40.649 --> 00:20:44.182\nShort and sweet is definitely\nwhat it should be, okay?\n\n384\n00:20:44.182 --> 00:20:49.430\nClear, concise and to the point,\nand it should be everywhere.\n\n385\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.191\nEverybody should be aware of it.\n\n386\n00:20:53.191 --> 00:20:56.840\nYou failed in your iJob by the way and\nyour iJob project management if I have to\n\n387\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.760\nsay to somebody, where do I find\nthe vision for this particular project?\n\n388\n00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.940\nIt should be absolutely everywhere,\nit should be on all, what we call,\n\n389\n00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.280\nour information radiators or\nour Kanban boards.\n\n390\n00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.460\nAnd so our vision needs to consider\nwho our customers are and what market\n\n391\n00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.580\nsegment we're going into and what it is\nthat we're actually trying to achieve.\n\n392\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.150\nAnd we have examples here in\nfront of us of sample visions.\n\n393\n00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:25.627\nAnd these are by people that\nhopefully everybody's heard of.\n\n394\n00:21:25.627 --> 00:21:30.694\nThese are visions for\na lot of our large organizations here,\n\n395\n00:21:30.694 --> 00:21:36.492\na PC in every room running Microsoft,\nthat was Bill Gates' vision.\n\n396\n00:21:36.492 --> 00:21:42.426\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, gosh and so I'm tunneling myself\nright now because I'm blacking out and\n\n397\n00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:45.264\nthinking about what our vision is, but\n\n398\n00:21:45.264 --> 00:21:49.740\nthey have updated their vision\nseveral times over the years.\n\n399\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:55.350\nBut their current vision and our current\nvision are actually pretty similar,\n\n400\n00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.652\ncuz I remember looking at them.\n\n401\n00:21:57.652 --> 00:21:59.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's what we want with a vision.\n\n402\n00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.320\nWe want a vision for\na project that's gonna be very high level.\n\n403\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.666\nAnd we say short and sweet, short,\nsweet to the point really, but\n\n404\n00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:09.830\nsomething that people can remember.\n\n405\n00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:15.766\nIf you look at Amazon's vision to be\nthe earth's most customer-centric company,\n\n406\n00:22:15.766 --> 00:22:18.608\nbuilding a place where people can come,\n\n407\n00:22:18.608 --> 00:22:23.480\nit's not necessarily what I'd call short,\nsharp and to the point.\n\n408\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.580\nNow, I'm not saying that this\nis a terrible vision at all\n\n409\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.930\nbecause if it inspires then maybe\nit's not a terrible vision.\n\n410\n00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.280\nHowever, people should remember it.\n\n411\n00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.470\nAnd if it's too long,\npeople aren't going to remember it.\n\n412\n00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.430\nAnd it should be visible everywhere also.\n\n413\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.210\nAnd then from the vision,\nthen we develop a road map.\n\n414\n00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.490\nAnd that road map is our three-month goal.\n\n415\n00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:51.284\nThat's the attribute,\nfunctional and non-functional,\n\n416\n00:22:51.284 --> 00:22:54.210\nfor the next three months, okay?\n\n417\n00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.600\nIt's relevant for three months.\n\n418\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.360\nAnd in terms of the roadmap,\nwe may want to plan that roadmap for\n\n419\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.170\na little bit longer than three months, but\n\n420\n00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.940\nwe're only going to plan\nthe next three months in detail.\n\n421\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.620\nWhich is why we say it's\nrevisited frequently, and\n\n422\n00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:14.229\nit's updated to reflect the changing\nneeds frequently, okay?\n\n423\n00:23:14.229 --> 00:23:19.788\nYour roadmap is, well, for\nthree months, nothing more than that.\n\n424\n00:23:19.788 --> 00:23:23.330\nBut you will have the high\nlevel which is longer term.\n\n425\n00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:29.048\nSo your vision, and underneath in\nyour roadmap we wanna have our vision\n\n426\n00:23:29.048 --> 00:23:34.120\nmapped out and we also want to\nhave our features mapped out too.\n\n427\n00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.079\nYour backlog and the planning for\nyour releases, well,\n\n428\n00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:43.439\nwe will have the epics possibly mapped\nout at a higher level in that roadmap and\n\n429\n00:23:43.439 --> 00:23:47.480\nwhat users' stories will\ncome within each epic.\n\n430\n00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.697\nBut again, we're only planning for\nthe next three months.\n\n431\n00:23:51.697 --> 00:23:56.098\nSo here in our next slide, and we'll\nkeep this one on full screen just for\n\n432\n00:23:56.098 --> 00:23:57.119\na little while.\n\n433\n00:23:57.119 --> 00:23:58.560\nYou'll see here our roadmap.\n\n434\n00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.556\nSo you'll see We've got\nour vision at the top.\n\n435\n00:24:02.556 --> 00:24:07.106\nAnd then we've got underneath that\nwe've got our epic stories, and\n\n436\n00:24:07.106 --> 00:24:11.968\nour epic stories are we want to have\na one stop shop for finding new homes and\n\n437\n00:24:11.968 --> 00:24:17.140\none epic story is hose that are for\nsale, those that are recently sold, etc.\n\n438\n00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.990\nSo we've got our epic stories and\n\n439\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.720\nthen underneath that,\nthese are the individual stories.\n\n440\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.410\nNow there's something\nwrong with those stories.\n\n441\n00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:30.890\nRemember what the story has to do, a story\nhas to explain who our customer is.\n\n442\n00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.620\nIt has to explain what\nthey want to achieve and\n\n443\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.200\nit have to explain how\nthey'll do that as well.\n\n444\n00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.530\n&gt;&gt; So these are just sort of very,\nvery high level descriptions,\n\n445\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:48.220\nthat's not actually a full story mapped\nout because we're going to find them on.\n\n446\n00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.320\nAnd so for that roadmap for\nthe next three months,\n\n447\n00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.910\nwhat we're going to do is that we're\ngoing to take those stories, and\n\n448\n00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:03.760\nwe're going to prioritize which epic\nstory we're going to look at first.\n\n449\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.335\n&gt;&gt; So you saw the epic stories\nin the previous slide.\n\n450\n00:25:06.335 --> 00:25:08.590\n[LAUGH] And then look at these.\n\n451\n00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.220\nSome of these techniques\nare quite amusing.\n\n452\n00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:16.635\nThese aren't, by the way, techniques,\nthese are what normally happens.\n\n453\n00:25:16.635 --> 00:25:21.710\nLike the sky is falling or\nthe squeaky wheel gets the grease or\n\n454\n00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.159\nthe larger the title, in other words,\nthe VIP bit, the higher priority.\n\n455\n00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.790\nHe who shouts loudest,\nas I like to call it.\n\n456\n00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.721\nAnd then there's also\nthe firefighting mode as well,\n\n457\n00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:37.188\nwhich is prioritization because that's\ngone wrong and it's had the most impact.\n\n458\n00:25:39.843 --> 00:25:42.063\nWhilst I can turn around to you and\n\n459\n00:25:42.063 --> 00:25:46.695\nthen I can preach at you until the cows\ncome home, as my mom would say.\n\n460\n00:25:46.695 --> 00:25:48.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where have they been?\n\n461\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.385\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nthat was always my question as well.\n\n462\n00:25:51.385 --> 00:25:56.473\n[LAUGH] But anyway,\nwhilst I can preach at you until then,\n\n463\n00:25:56.473 --> 00:26:03.282\nit doesn't matter how much I say to you,\ndon't use any of these, you will.\n\n464\n00:26:03.282 --> 00:26:05.790\nThis happens, you will.\n\n465\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:12.110\nSo what we should be prioritizing on\nis based on either our MoSCoW model,\n\n466\n00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.900\nwhich is MUST have this and\nSHOULD have that and COULD have this.\n\n467\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.190\nAnd then you got the Kano model which\nis very similar which is a must have\n\n468\n00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:25.250\nfeatures and then the satisfies,\nI'd like more of those.\n\n469\n00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.300\nIn fact, the more the better.\n\n470\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.710\nThe excitement features as well.\n\n471\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.196\n&gt;&gt; The lighters, I always liked that word.\n\n472\n00:26:30.196 --> 00:26:30.738\nIt's such a fun word.\n\n473\n00:26:30.738 --> 00:26:36.160\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I like exciters, I like excitement.\n\n474\n00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n475\n00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.170\n&gt;&gt; And then you got\nthe dissatisfiers which is no,\n\n476\n00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.290\nI definitely don't want those.\n\n477\n00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n478\n00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.900\nAnd then you've got business value,\n\n479\n00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.520\nwhich is similar with what we looked at\nin the previous one, which was similar to\n\n480\n00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.640\nhe who shouts loudest, as I like to\ncall it or may be the firefighting one.\n\n481\n00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.830\nAnd then of course,\nyou've got technology risk,\n\n482\n00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:59.900\nprioritized based on the technology risk\nthat's associated in implementing it.\n\n483\n00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.050\nIn other words, remember Fail Fast?\n\n484\n00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n485\n00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:09.620\n&gt;&gt; So in that instance then,\nit's the requirement with the highest risk\n\n486\n00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.940\nwe want to implement first\nbecause we wanna Fail First.\n\n487\n00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.590\nSo want to get that one out\nof the way way first and\n\n488\n00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.030\nthen if anything happens,\nthen we can do some about that.\n\n489\n00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.060\nSo before we move into\nthen our release planning,\n\n490\n00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.370\nthis is what we've got to\ndo at a roadmap level and\n\n491\n00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:32.420\nthis is going to be done not\njust by the product owner.\n\n492\n00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:37.440\nBecause the product owner is responsible\nfor ascertaining what should appear in\n\n493\n00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.040\neach release but\nalso about the SCRUM master as well\n\n494\n00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.460\nbecause the SCRUM master has gotta get the\nresources together to be able to do that.\n\n495\n00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:50.430\nSo we've looked at our vision and\nwe've looked at our roadmap and\n\n496\n00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:54.660\nwhen we come back in our next episode,\nwe're going to start looking at planning\n\n497\n00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.660\nour releases and planning our iterations\n&gt;&gt; Sounds look a plan, Jess.\n\n498\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.170\nThank you so much for being here with us\n&gt;&gt; Was that supposed to be a joke?\n\n499\n00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.640\nSounds like a plan?\n\n500\n00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.300\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; (Laugh)\n\n501\n00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.550\n&gt;&gt; But it could be taken like that\n\n502\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.670\n&gt;&gt; I thought that was deliberate,\n\n503\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.415\nI was just going to say how\nimpressed I was, but hey.\n\n504\n00:28:11.415 --> 00:28:12.894\n&gt;&gt; Jo's so punny/\n\n505\n00:28:12.894 --> 00:28:14.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Got it?\n\n506\n00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.460\nThat was a joke.\n\n507\n00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.605\n&gt;&gt; That was terrible.\n\n508\n00:28:16.605 --> 00:28:17.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n509\n00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.190\n&gt;&gt; It's time to go.\n\n510\n00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.860\n&gt;&gt; This is why I don't do jokes.\n\n511\n00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.450\nWe're gonna sign out guys.\n\n512\n00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.810\nI'm been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n513\n00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:23.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n514\n00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.281\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n515\n00:28:25.281 -->

00:00:08.438\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:13.426\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to\n\n5\n00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:16.060\nyour Agile Product Owner series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.070\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.880\nWe've been looking at the five levels of\nplanning and in this show specifically,\n\n8\n00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.090\nwe'll be taking a look at our release.\n\n9\n00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.090\nAnd with us today back in studios,\nwe have Ms. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.170\nHow is going today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you,\n\n11\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.739\nCherokee, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing all right, thanks for asking.\n\n12\n00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.445\nI'm slowly coming down\noff of my sugar cupcake\n\n13\n00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:41.205\nhigh that I was on from the last show.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was too much sugar,\n\n14\n00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:42.821\ntoo much sugar for the last show.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:44.874\n&gt;&gt; I don't think she can even remember\n\n16\n00:00:44.874 --> 00:00:48.480\nthe last episode.\n&gt;&gt; It was just like a whirlwind and\n\n17\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.270\nthose first couple of levels,\nthey were actually vision and\n\n18\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.648\nroad map.\n&gt;&gt; Okay now I'm impressed and perhaps we\n\n19\n00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:57.762\nshould be giving her more sugar.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:57.762 --> 00:00:59.055\n&gt;&gt; Because you're right,\n\n21\n00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:02.998\nthe first couple of levels where our\nvision and our road map, and then in this\n\n22\n00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:07.160\nparticular episode we're going to\nbe looking at our release planning.\n\n23\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.650\nAnd then in subsequent episodes,\nwe're gonna further into planning for\n\n24\n00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.590\nthe iterations.\n\n25\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.800\nAnd of course our daily planning,\nwhich is our daily stand up.\n\n26\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.060\nBut for this, we're just gonna look\nat the planning for a release.\n\n27\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.590\nSo in our last episode, previous episode,\nwe looked at the vision,\n\n28\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.170\nthat high level elevator pitch vision.\n\n29\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.915\nAnd by the way, we call that\na lift all right, it's a lift.\n\n30\n00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:33.885\nBut then that wouldn't sound right,\nactually, I like the term elevator pitch,\n\n31\n00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:36.053\nrather than a lift pitch.\n&gt;&gt; A lift pitch, yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:36.053 --> 00:01:37.875\n&gt;&gt; Kinda sounds clumsy, right?\n\n33\n00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:41.670\n[LAUGH] So we looked at our\nelevator pitch and our vision, and\n\n34\n00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.150\nthen we looked at our road map,\n\n35\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.822\nwhich was our three month out plan And\nhere now we're looking at a release plan.\n\n36\n00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:54.554\nAnd a release plan is something that,\nwell remember what release is,\n\n37\n00:01:54.554 --> 00:01:56.769\nwe looked at this in previous episodes and\n\n38\n00:01:56.769 --> 00:02:00.082\nwe also looked at this in our\nITIL fundamental series as well.\n\n39\n00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:05.125\nAnd a release of course is,\nit's what you release to the businesses,\n\n40\n00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.850\nwhat you release to the user.\n\n41\n00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.960\nSo it's what the user sees and\na release can contain one or\n\n42\n00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.870\nmore iterations and\nsometimes we might wait to have maybe\n\n43\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.880\nthree iterations before we\nactually perform a release.\n\n44\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.750\nWhich means that if each iteration\nis say four weeks, then that\n\n45\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.180\nrelease could take three months\nitself to actually be implemented.\n\n46\n00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.180\nThe goal of the release plan though,\n\n47\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.920\ncuz we gotta plan it before we do it,\nis to actually prioritize the features and\n\n48\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.797\ncomplete the estimates and\nplan for our releases.\n\n49\n00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:45.610\nYou see I've already mentioned that\na release contains multiple iterations or\n\n50\n00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.170\nsprints, if you want to call them that.\n\n51\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.150\nBut who's to say what's\ngoing to be in each sprint?\n\n52\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.160\nAnd who's to say what that\nrelease is going to look like?\n\n53\n00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.590\nWell, this is done at\nthe beginning remember?\n\n54\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.570\nIn our previous episode we had to\nprioritize our user's stories and\n\n55\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.140\nwe had to also estimate exactly\nhow long it was going to take.\n\n56\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.528\nWell all right,\nyou can't estimate exactly.\n\n57\n00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:12.900\nBut you had to estimate how long it was\ngoing to take to perform each user's\n\n58\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.920\nstory.\n\n59\n00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.520\nAnd it's the product owner who\nthen at that point in time,\n\n60\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.480\nthey will then decide which stories\nare going to appear in which iteration.\n\n61\n00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.530\nAnd then of course at the end of each\niteration, and we'll look at this\n\n62\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.270\nin a little while, but we conduct\na review at the end of the iteration.\n\n63\n00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.890\nAnd that review will allow us\nto see what's been completed,\n\n64\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.120\nwhat hasn't been completed and then what\nwe should include in the next iteration.\n\n65\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.050\nOur release plan then really lists out\n\n66\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.230\nwhat iterations should be\nin each individual release.\n\n67\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.130\nSo what piece of functionality\nam I going to deliver?\n\n68\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.710\nThat's what should be in our release plan.\n\n69\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.600\nSo the release states,\nit says that if they're fixed,\n\n70\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.440\nplan out what features will be\nincluded based on the team's velocity.\n\n71\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.860\nVelocity, well we know\nthat that means speed.\n\n72\n00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.000\nBut it's based on what we think\n\n73\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.600\nthe team can develop in that period\nof time, based on what we think\n\n74\n00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.364\nthe team can develop for each iteration.\n&gt;&gt; I remember,\n\n75\n00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:28.163\nthat's the time when I found out that\nI wasn't as productive as I thought I\n\n76\n00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:29.460\nwas.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n77\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.177\n&gt;&gt; Or ideal days when I learned that term.\n\n78\n00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:32.861\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\n\n79\n00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:36.139\nwe'll look at this when we\nlook at iteration planning and\n\n80\n00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.598\nplanning out those ideal days and what\nwe can do to help with those ideal days.\n\n81\n00:04:40.598 --> 00:04:44.253\nBut in a nut shell, we looked at\nour productive time and our not so\n\n82\n00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:48.722\nproductive time and we look to do a lot\nof our development work in our productive\n\n83\n00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:52.680\ntime because that's when we're\nbeing productive funnily enough.\n\n84\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.313\nAnd then our not productive time we\nshouldn't beat ourselves up about the fact\n\n85\n00:04:56.313 --> 00:04:58.510\nwe're not productive during that time.\n\n86\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.472\nWe should just make sure that we don't\nactually do any development during that\n\n87\n00:05:03.472 --> 00:05:08.650\nnon productive time, because we may end\nup redoing it and that's not efficient.\n\n88\n00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.396\nSo here is where we gotta be honest.\n\n89\n00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:16.021\nWhen it comes to release planning and\nwhen it comes to working out velocity and\n\n90\n00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.367\nwhen it comes to working out what\nwe're gonna include in each release,\n\n91\n00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:20.567\nwe've gotta be honest.\n\n92\n00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:25.607\nWe've really got to look at\nwhat a team is capable of.\n\n93\n00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:28.120\nWe've estimated user stories.\n\n94\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.070\nWe've estimated how much development work\nit should take, if they were ideal days.\n\n95\n00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.413\nAnd an ideal day is a day where\nwe do eight hours worth of\n\n96\n00:05:38.413 --> 00:05:40.055\nsolid development work.\n\n97\n00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:43.325\nThat's eight hours worth of solid\ndevelopment work without any\n\n98\n00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:45.390\ninterruptions during that eight days.\n\n99\n00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.882\nThat means no going and\ngetting a cup of tea nor a coffee or\n\n100\n00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:50.752\nwhatever else that you want.\n\n101\n00:05:50.752 --> 00:05:53.812\nIt means no taking a lunch break,\nit means no answering your telephone or\n\n102\n00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.840\nanything else that you have to do.\n\n103\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.320\nWell how often does that happen\nin real life, it doesn't.\n\n104\n00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.400\nSo we have to know what it is we\nare going to deliver in each release and\n\n105\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.390\nwe have to be honest in our estimations.\n\n106\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.220\nAnd be honest as to what we can seriously\nachieve within a certain time span.\n\n107\n00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.480\nSo when we start off with our release\nplan, we generally know the scope.\n\n108\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.585\nAnd I even tell you there,\nsome of the features are fixed.\n\n109\n00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:29.311\nAnd estimate well,\nwe're gonna have to map out a release\n\n110\n00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:34.050\nplan based on how quickly we\ncan produce those features.\n\n111\n00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.142\nSo we can start off with two approaches.\n\n112\n00:06:36.142 --> 00:06:40.970\nWe can either say okay, we're gonna really\nsay every two months in which case then we\n\n113\n00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.405\nhave to work out exactly what\nwe can fit in every two months.\n\n114\n00:06:44.405 --> 00:06:48.130\nOr we say, right I'm gonna\nrelease based on feature and\n\n115\n00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.775\nI'm gonna release once\nthis feature is complete.\n\n116\n00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:55.684\nIn which case, then we have to go back and\nestimate how productive the team is and\n\n117\n00:06:55.684 --> 00:07:00.172\nsee how long it's going to take to\ncomplete those particular features.\n\n118\n00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:04.650\nThere's no right or wrong way, you can do\nyour estimations whichever way you want.\n\n119\n00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.440\nYou can either estimate\nbased on feature or\n\n120\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.250\nyou can estimate based on date and\nthis is when we will release.\n\n121\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.490\nIt's entirely up to you as to which way\nyou do that, but you do have to do it.\n\n122\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.150\nYou have to use a rough estimate.\n\n123\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.361\nSo when you're reviewing features,\n\n124\n00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:25.268\nyou have to use a rough estimate as\nto how long it's going to take you.\n\n125\n00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:28.097\nSo what I mean,\nwe use things like T-shirt sizes.\n\n126\n00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:29.184\nIs it a small?\n\n127\n00:07:29.184 --> 00:07:30.770\nIs it medium?\n\n128\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.605\nIs it large?\n\n129\n00:07:31.605 --> 00:07:36.226\nAnd by the way, the numbers that are in\nthere, you'll devise the numbers, not me.\n\n130\n00:07:36.226 --> 00:07:42.377\nYou devise those and we've got say 20,\n40, 60in terms of man out.\n\n131\n00:07:42.377 --> 00:07:46.037\nWe've also gotta plan for the unknowns.\n\n132\n00:07:46.037 --> 00:07:50.209\nThat's the telephone calls,\nthat's the call into the meeting,\n\n133\n00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:54.679\nthat's being dragged off to somewhere\nelse to have a conversation with\n\n134\n00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:58.939\nsomebody because you need\nclarification about a certain feature.\n\n135\n00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:03.164\nThat's the fact that no you've suddenly\ngot 100 e-mails or somebody's Come and\n\n136\n00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:05.750\ntapped you on the shoulder and\nsaid as they do with me?\n\n137\n00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:11.504\nCould you actually finish those\ndescriptions please, for those episodes?\n\n138\n00:08:11.504 --> 00:08:13.803\nAll of those unknowns that\nyou weren't expecting,\n\n139\n00:08:13.803 --> 00:08:17.000\nthat you think to yourself well,\nI've already got 101 things to do.\n\n140\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.220\nHow I'm I gonna do that?\n\n141\n00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.000\nAll of those need to be estimated.\n\n142\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.350\nSo plan for those unknowns,\nit's gonna happen.\n\n143\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.320\nAnd this is when we get into those ideal\ndays that Cherokee was talking about.\n\n144\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.690\nAnd looking at,\nnot just when's our productive time, but\n\n145\n00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.380\nreally strictly, how many hours\na day do we expect to be productive?\n\n146\n00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.177\nI can't answer that for you.\n\n147\n00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:43.884\nWhen I think about how many hours\na day we expect to be productive, and\n\n148\n00:08:43.884 --> 00:08:48.428\nI wonder how many hours a day are spent\nactually tying up all of those\n\n149\n00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:52.020\nloose ends that just come\nalong during the day.\n\n150\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.990\nAnd how productive are we really?\n\n151\n00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.720\nThe idea is that we want the team\nto keep a sustainable pace.\n\n152\n00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.820\nSo, we want to have sustained\ndevelopment throughout that time.\n\n153\n00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.330\nSo, from the start of our first situation,\nright away through to\n\n154\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.780\nour actual release state, we wanna\nensure that the development is steady.\n\n155\n00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.290\nDon't forget testing as well.\n\n156\n00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.850\nWe've got to ensure that we do\ntesting too within that time span.\n\n157\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.970\nWe've got to release frequently,\nit's not just a one off thing.\n\n158\n00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.190\nAnd that's what we call\na Waterfall approach, right?\n\n159\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.300\nWe released frequently.\n\n160\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.010\nSo it might be after every iteration.\n\n161\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.480\nI wouldn't recommend that.\n\n162\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.560\nIt might be after every\ntwo to three iterations.\n\n163\n00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.774\nI certainly wouldn't want you to\nbe releasing after every six or\n\n164\n00:09:39.774 --> 00:09:42.966\nseven iterations because again,\nthat's a waterfall approach and\n\n165\n00:09:42.966 --> 00:09:44.988\nyou're not really building up momentum.\n\n166\n00:09:44.988 --> 00:09:48.755\nAnd if you've had seven or\neight iterations in three months,\n\n167\n00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:52.170\nthen that's really going some,\nthat's all I can say.\n\n168\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.980\nEither well done, or my goodness,\nhow are you coping with the chaos?\n\n169\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.740\nI'm not too sure which that would be.\n\n170\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.753\nBut remember, we have to understand\nwhat a definition of done means.\n\n171\n00:10:04.753 --> 00:10:08.718\nIn other words, when do we sign\noff on that particular release and\n\n172\n00:10:08.718 --> 00:10:10.530\nsay yes, that's good to go.\n\n173\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.580\nSo we plan all of that,\nboth our technical teams,\n\n174\n00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.220\nin other words our development teams,\nbut also the business team as well.\n\n175\n00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.920\nGo back to the episode where we were\nlooking at the product owner and\n\n176\n00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.160\nwho the product owner should be, and\nyou'll see that the product owner\n\n177\n00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.600\nshould be somebody with a good\nunderstanding of the business.\n\n178\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:35.060\nAnd our score master is gonna help us with\ndeciding exactly who has what skills and\n\n179\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.510\nhow quickly they can do\ndevelopment work as well.\n\n180\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.805\nSo between the two, you should be able\nto come up with a rough estimate,\n\n181\n00:10:42.805 --> 00:10:45.169\nbut you should also get the business and\n\n182\n00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:48.698\nany other technical stuff\ninvolved wherever you need to.\n\n183\n00:10:48.698 --> 00:10:54.440\nThe backlog management,\nour backlog is our list of things to do.\n\n184\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.220\nWe've got there, we've got stories, we've\ngot defects that may come from a backlog.\n\n185\n00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.490\nWe've got nonfunctional requirements\nthat may be on our backlog as well.\n\n186\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.730\nA backlog is our list of things to do,\nso simple as that.\n\n187\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:16.570\nNow with every single iteration,\na backlog will change.\n\n188\n00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.680\nBecause with every single iteration,\nit doesn't matter how well we\n\n189\n00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.680\nplan that iteration, there are going\nto be defects that come out of testing.\n\n190\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.560\nThere are going to be nonfunctional\nrequirements that may be difficult to\n\n191\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.260\nestimate for instance.\n\n192\n00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.930\nAnd with every single iteration,\nas much as we like to plan for\n\n193\n00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.970\neach iteration and\nwe'd like to get it right, and\n\n194\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.970\nwe'd like to deliver absolutely\neverything that we set out to deliver,\n\n195\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.370\nthere has to be an understanding\nin Agile that we don't do that.\n\n196\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.345\nI'm not saying that every\nsingle iteration is wrong.\n\n197\n00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:50.510\n[LAUGH] I'm not saying that we never\ndo anything in any iteration, or\n\n198\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.810\nwe never achieve our goals, but\nwhat I'm saying is that we're realistic.\n\n199\n00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.450\nThat's agile.\n\n200\n00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.690\nAgile means that we are adaptable and\nso we're realistic.\n\n201\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.590\nAnd with every iteration,\nwe have to revisit our backlog, and\n\n202\n00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.770\nthen we have to prioritize again or\nreprioritize.\n\n203\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.130\nThe other thing, when it comes to\nbacklog management is that, and\n\n204\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.970\nthis is something that we don't have\nto think about too, it's insuring\n\n205\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.560\nthat we've actually got enough stories for\nthe development team to work on.\n\n206\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.130\nYou don't want your development team\nsitting there twiddling their thumbs.\n\n207\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.130\nAnd I wonder how often that happens\nactually that we run out of stories.\n\n208\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.170\nWhat do you think we should\ndo if we run out of stories?\n\n209\n00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.270\n&gt;&gt; I don't know but I think\n\n210\n00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.550\nthat if that happened here at ITProTV,\nthey should probably go on a field trip\n\n211\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.152\nbecause those guys, they worked so well.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:12:45.152 --> 00:12:46.026\n&gt;&gt; Like they work all the time.\n\n213\n00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:49.510\nI don't ever see them twiddling.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.925\n&gt;&gt; Maybe they're just really,\n\n215\n00:12:50.925 --> 00:12:52.792\nreally good at pretending to work, but\n\n216\n00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:55.611\nI don't think that's the case.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well I do see\n\n217\n00:12:55.611 --> 00:12:58.890\nTim wandering around\nwith his fidget spinner.\n\n218\n00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.090\nMaybe that's what it is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n219\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.010\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's just that he's not\n\n220\n00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.971\ngot enough to do.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n221\n00:13:02.971 --> 00:13:05.370\nno I say field trip.\n&gt;&gt; You say field trip?\n\n222\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:06.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead and\n\n223\n00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.650\nget their creativity and tension released,\ntake them to go putt putt golf or\n\n224\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.780\nsomething, I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; No\n\n225\n00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.863\ngive him another story today.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:13:14.863 --> 00:13:16.609\n&gt;&gt; We've gone back to this culture thing\n\n227\n00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:20.883\nagain, but we've not good enough to do.\n&gt;&gt; I wanna reward them, yeah [LAUGH] you\n\n228\n00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:24.680\nguys did all your work, yay.\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, give him another story to\n\n229\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.380\ndo, that's what they're being paid to do,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.428\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can tell who's the nice one\n\n231\n00:13:29.428 --> 00:13:33.070\naround here can't you, and\nit's not me, funnily enough.\n\n232\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:38.870\n[LAUGH] So we have to establish\nsome estimation techniques for\n\n233\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.270\nestimating the length of our\nstories in the amount of\n\n234\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.520\neffort that's going to go\ninto developing our stories.\n\n235\n00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.880\nWe wanna focus on being accurate, but\n\n236\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.590\nwe don't wanna be too precise\nright at the very, very beginning.\n\n237\n00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:02.390\nSo we want to ensure that we\nget the functionality accurate,\n\n238\n00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:07.750\nbut we can't be exactly precise about the\namount of time that it's going to take.\n\n239\n00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.090\nRemember that for any given project,\nespecially the very beginning of\n\n240\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.640\na project, and that team is evolving,\nit's evolving as a team.\n\n241\n00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.850\nAnd they're not going to be as efficient\nright at the start of the project, as they\n\n242\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.500\nare sort of six months down the line\nwhen they've been working together for\n\n243\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.730\nsix months.\n\n244\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.020\nSo they're not going to be as\nefficient right at the very start.\n\n245\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.020\nSo while she can be accurate with\nyour functionality requirements,\n\n246\n00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.980\nwe can't necessarily be precise with our\ntiming because we have to accept that\n\n247\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.470\nwe've got to give the team\nchance to work together.\n\n248\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.158\nSo we have to embrace that concept\nthat we learn as we go along.\n\n249\n00:14:46.158 --> 00:14:49.310\nAnd that can be a difficult\nconcept to get your head around.\n\n250\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.190\nEspecially in IT,\nbecause we expect everything to work.\n\n251\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.900\nAs it should do, right from the word go,\nand that doesn't happen.\n\n252\n00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:03.050\nTeams have got to learn to work together,\nand if you want a team to perform well,\n\n253\n00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.200\nyou have to give them the chance\nto be able to do that.\n\n254\n00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.930\nIt's more important to have everybody\non the same page as we would say,\n\n255\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.670\nto have that common understanding\nof the work then it is to get\n\n256\n00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:21.080\nit down to its precise number of hours for\n\n257\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.260\nevery single story and for\nevery single piece of work.\n\n258\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.670\nBecause if we've got a common\nunderstanding then there's more chance of\n\n259\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.702\ncollaboration.\n\n260\n00:15:30.702 --> 00:15:35.500\nIn our stand up this morning Cameron said,\nthat he was working on one particular\n\n261\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.150\nstory and he'd finished that and said, now\nhe was going to work on something else.\n\n262\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.810\nAnd that's because he has an understanding\nof the work as a whole is requires for\n\n263\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.730\nthat iteration.\n\n264\n00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.140\nAnd because he's got that understanding,\nhe's able to say, right,\n\n265\n00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.910\nI'm going to go and help out.\n\n266\n00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.724\nAnd again, that's the purpose of\nthe stand up, to be able to do that.\n\n267\n00:15:54.724 --> 00:15:57.867\nIf he didn't have that understanding\nof all of the work and\n\n268\n00:15:57.867 --> 00:16:01.666\nof the approximate size of all of\nthe work, then he wouldn't do that.\n\n269\n00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:03.944\nHe might actually decide to\ntake a day off and go and\n\n270\n00:16:03.944 --> 00:16:05.797\nhave some sort of adventure, instead.\n\n271\n00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:09.597\nBut he realizes that it's the team\nas a whole that's got to produce,\n\n272\n00:16:09.597 --> 00:16:11.114\nit's not just down to him.\n\n273\n00:16:11.114 --> 00:16:15.438\nAnd so it's never going to be, within any\nAgile team, it's never going to be one\n\n274\n00:16:15.438 --> 00:16:20.143\nperson saying, well right, these are my\nlist of responsibilities, I've done them,\n\n275\n00:16:20.143 --> 00:16:22.320\nthat's it, I'm finished for the day.\n\n276\n00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.790\nIt's not the project manager's job,\n\n277\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.130\nit's not the product owner's job\nto direct product execution.\n\n278\n00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.650\nIn other words, no micromanaging, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.443\nDefinitely not.\n\n280\n00:16:34.443 --> 00:16:39.251\nSo we wanna think about when we\ntalk about estimating effort,\n\n281\n00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:43.318\nwe wanna think about story points or\nideal days, and\n\n282\n00:16:43.318 --> 00:16:48.430\nour ideal days are how productive\nwe are as a team in our ideal day.\n\n283\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.120\nIn other words,\nwhen are we at our most productive?\n\n284\n00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.450\nWhere our story points take our velocity\nand say, how much can we do in a day?\n\n285\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.510\nHow many story points\ncan we execute in a day?\n\n286\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.050\nOr how long does it take\nthe story point to be executed?\n\n287\n00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.060\nSo from one approach we're\nlooking at the story itself, and\n\n288\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.220\nwe're saying this story is\ngoing to take us five days.\n\n289\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.136\nFrom the other approach, I'm looking\nat a person and I'm saying, okay,\n\n290\n00:17:14.136 --> 00:17:17.740\nI'm productive for three hours of the day,\nthat'd be about right,\n\n291\n00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.743\nactually, three hours.\n&gt;&gt; How long was my cupcake high?\n\n292\n00:17:20.743 --> 00:17:23.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's her idea there,\n\n293\n00:17:23.629 --> 00:17:29.124\nthat's 35 minutes, I think we were on.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just keep\n\n294\n00:17:29.124 --> 00:17:33.879\nthe cupcakes coming, we'll be just fine.\n&gt;&gt; So think also about,\n\n295\n00:17:33.879 --> 00:17:35.725\nwhat about your contingency?\n\n296\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.690\nWe have to build in contingency\ninto our estimates and\n\n297\n00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:45.670\neven though we know that Cherokee's\nideal day consists of 35 minutes and\n\n298\n00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.480\nonly after she's had a cupcake.\n\n299\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.630\nIt was a lemon,\nit looked very nice, by the way.\n\n300\n00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.140\nI did have a piece.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know,\n\n301\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.940\nI think I'm just gonna come up with a\nwriter like Mariah Carey where she's like,\n\n302\n00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.790\nI will only perform if I get green M&amp;Ms.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n303\n00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.655\n&gt;&gt; What do you think they'll do with\n\n304\n00:18:02.655 --> 00:18:03.246\nmy list?\n\n305\n00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:06.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do you really want an answer\n\n306\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.890\nto that?\n\n307\n00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.790\nOkay then, green M&amp;Ms it is.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n308\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:10.722\ndon't know.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n309\n00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:11.706\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n310\n00:18:11.706 --> 00:18:14.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Building our contingency,\n\n311\n00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.200\nnot just cupcakes, all right.\n\n312\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.970\nBut our contingency is what to\ndo if things don't go right or\n\n313\n00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.130\nthings don't go according to plan.\n\n314\n00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.000\nIt's not what to do if things go wrong.\n\n315\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.959\nContingency is all about what to\ndo when the unexpected happens.\n\n316\n00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:35.701\nA must haves should account for sort of\n60% of whatever the work that we do but\n\n317\n00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:40.830\nwe also have to have contingency\nin our requirements, as well.\n\n318\n00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.330\nAnd contingency is what to do\nwhen things don't go quite right.\n\n319\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.310\nAnd so\nwe build those into our estimations.\n\n320\n00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.570\nSo we understand that maybe if our ideal\nday, our most productive time of the day,\n\n321\n00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:57.060\nsay we've got six hours out of\nan eight hour day is our ideal day,\n\n322\n00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.700\nthen at least one hour of that\nshould be spent In contingency.\n\n323\n00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.120\nIn other words, we assume that five\nhours is going to be productive and\n\n324\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.620\nthat one hour,\nwe're probably going to be picking up\n\n325\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.850\nthe pieces from something\nthat didn't quite go so well.\n\n326\n00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.050\nEvery single team member\nshould take responsibility for\n\n327\n00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.080\nproducing their own estimates.\n\n328\n00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.310\nBut it's produced in collaboration\nwith the entire organization,\n\n329\n00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.530\nor more importantly,\nactually, with the customers.\n\n330\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.380\nAnd so, our assumptions and\n\n331\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.570\nour risks should also be recorded\nwhen we're producing those estimates.\n\n332\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.540\nAnd the product owner, because\nthey've got that business experience,\n\n333\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.880\nthey're gonna help us with that.\n\n334\n00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.060\nThey should really,\nreally be helping us with that estimation.\n\n335\n00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.590\nBecause they understand also\nwhat the prioritization is and\n\n336\n00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:52.980\nwhat our business is expecting and\nhow our team should be performing or\n\n337\n00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.330\nshould be developing in order to\nmeet the needs of the organization.\n\n338\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:04.160\nWhatever estimation approach you use,\nand it doesn't matter which one you use,\n\n339\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.640\nand typically would use a combination.\n\n340\n00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.210\nBut then,\nit's got to be done with the team.\n\n341\n00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.360\nAnd it's gonna be based on previous\nprojects and we call it time boxes or\n\n342\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.990\niterations or sprints.\n\n343\n00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:21.030\nIt's gonna be based on\nhow we performed before.\n\n344\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.018\nSo go back to what I was saying\njust a little while ago.\n\n345\n00:20:24.018 --> 00:20:28.960\nIn that, a team that has\nnot worked together before,\n\n346\n00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.200\nthe estimation's probably\ngonna be way out.\n\n347\n00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.815\nBut a team that has worked together\nbefore, we have to give them chance to\n\n348\n00:20:35.815 --> 00:20:39.390\nevolve and actually the longer\nwe work together as a team,\n\n349\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.120\nthe more accurate we\nare in our estimations.\n\n350\n00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.445\nSo use workshops to help us,\ncertainly at the beginning of a project,\n\n351\n00:20:47.445 --> 00:20:51.190\nwe only use workshops to\nhelp us in our planning.\n\n352\n00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.620\nBut at the start of iterations,\n\n353\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:59.150\nthen we will ensure that we\nrevisit those estimations again.\n\n354\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.130\nJust to make sure that they're accurate.\n\n355\n00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.910\nSo that we're not hit\nby anything unexpected,\n\n356\n00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.230\nthat we've got contingency built in.\n\n357\n00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.010\nAnd then when it comes to\nthe end of the iteration,\n\n358\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.725\nwe've actually delivered what we\nsaid we were going to deliver.\n\n359\n00:21:11.725 --> 00:21:15.575\nOrdinarily we'd use\na combination of things.\n\n360\n00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:19.175\nWe've got various approaches\nto sort of prioritize it.\n\n361\n00:21:19.175 --> 00:21:22.725\nAnd these are some things that\nare recognized throughout the industry.\n\n362\n00:21:22.725 --> 00:21:27.545\nKano analysis or expert opinions or\ntheme screening.\n\n363\n00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:28.595\nBut you know what?\n\n364\n00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.181\nYou're not really going to\nbe bound by any of these\n\n365\n00:21:33.181 --> 00:21:33.970\nthings.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n366\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.719\ncuz if you have something that works for\n\n367\n00:21:35.719 --> 00:21:38.422\nyou, then use it because this\nis really like just whatever it\n\n368\n00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:40.980\ntakes to get it done.\n&gt;&gt; Is that really bad that she's finishing\n\n369\n00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.160\nmy sentences now?\n\n370\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.490\nThat's terrible, isn't it?\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n371\n00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.400\nwe are like on that level now, Jo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:47.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n373\n00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n374\n00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:51.220\n&gt;&gt; I think it's bad especially for you\n\n375\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.567\nguys watching like when you are actually\nunderstanding what I am saying because,\n\n376\n00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:57.940\nyeah, mm-hmm.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n377\n00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.840\n&gt;&gt; Especially when it's those crazy\n\n378\n00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.930\nstories and you are like, okay,\n\n379\n00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.955\nI do see how it fits together, but.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes with the crazy\n\n380\n00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:05.830\nstories though, we don't quite\nunderstand how it fits together.\n\n381\n00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not always.\n\n382\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.993\nOkay so right now what we've got on\nthe screen in front of us is this Cone of\n\n383\n00:22:12.993 --> 00:22:15.670\nUncertainty, and\nthis just goes back to common sense.\n\n384\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.590\nAnd I always say this about Agile and\nI say this about any other methodology,\n\n385\n00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.930\nit's just common sense written down.\n\n386\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:28.040\nThe further out from the project\nend that we are, or the further\n\n387\n00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:33.990\nout from the release that we are, the more\nvague your estimation is going to be.\n\n388\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.880\nSimple as that, and\nas you get closer to your end date,\n\n389\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.130\nthen the more detailed\nyour estimation would be.\n\n390\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.150\nAnd the more accurate\nyour estimation would be.\n\n391\n00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.560\nSo we've got plus or\nminus there, or give or take.\n\n392\n00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.780\nYeah, we could be wrong either way,\nthe further out we are.\n\n393\n00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.447\nSo the project schedule when we first\nstart with our initial project or\n\n394\n00:22:56.447 --> 00:22:59.621\nproduct definition,\nwe're gonna be way out.\n\n395\n00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:03.466\nWe could overestimate or\nwe could underestimate, but the further we\n\n396\n00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:07.790\nget along that iteration, then the more\naccurate our estimation should be.\n\n397\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.930\nAnd certainly the further we get\nalong the project as a whole.\n\n398\n00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.440\nAnd the more accurate our\nestimations should be.\n\n399\n00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.010\nRemember our DEEP backlogs, okay.\n\n400\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:23.500\nOur DEEP backlogs, this is looking at our\nbacklog, remember, our list of stories?\n\n401\n00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.700\nOur DEEP backlogs, we looked at\nthis in our fundamental series.\n\n402\n00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.590\nIt means details appropriately, every\nsingle estimation and every single story\n\n403\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.430\nshould be detailed appropriately,\nthe appropriate level of detail.\n\n404\n00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:45.440\nRemember our agile principles,\nremember what agile really stands for,\n\n405\n00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.900\nour values, in that we don't want\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n406\n00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.980\nWe do want the right level of detail and\n\n407\n00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.410\nwe want to ensure that we\nhaven't done too much work.\n\n408\n00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.960\nRemember, maximize the amount\nof work that's not done yet.\n\n409\n00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.840\nSo detail to the appropriate level.\n\n410\n00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.030\nWe want to estimate all of our\nwork before we actually do that.\n\n411\n00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.580\nSo we've got an accurate idea of, well,\n\n412\n00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.120\nI used the word accurate and estimate\nagain together, but, ultimately we need to\n\n413\n00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.940\nhave an idea as to when we are going to\nbe finished with each individual story.\n\n414\n00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.320\nAnd we should evolve,\nwe use E for emergent, but\n\n415\n00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.690\nI like to use evolving, okay.\n\n416\n00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.900\nBecause all of our period of time\nthroughout that project, we are evolving.\n\n417\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.000\nAs we, well,\n\n418\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.760\nas we become more adept at being able to\nestimate and obviously being able to plan.\n\n419\n00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.370\nAnd all of our backlogs\nshould be prioritized.\n\n420\n00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:47.900\nAnd if we prioritize, then that will also\nhelp us with our estimation, as well.\n\n421\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.932\nThe last thing that you want\nto do is underestimate.\n\n422\n00:24:50.932 --> 00:24:54.545\nDon't underestimate anything\nthat's a priority one,\n\n423\n00:24:54.545 --> 00:24:58.080\nif it's a priority one then we wanna\nmake sure that we've run into,\n\n424\n00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.130\nwe've run some contingency into that.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n425\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.470\n&gt;&gt; So in this particular episode,\n\n426\n00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:08.810\nthen what we did was we looked at\nrelease planning process itself and\n\n427\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:14.090\nwe've got a quick slide there just to\nshow you a recap of the planning process.\n\n428\n00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:18.720\nThat's something that again is available\nin your notes and you can download that.\n\n429\n00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.350\nAnd in our next episode, what we're going\nto do is we're going to come back and\n\n430\n00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:27.250\nwe are going to be looking at\nour iterations or our sprints or\n\n431\n00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.570\nour time boxes, however you wanna call it.\n\n432\n00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.830\nWe're gonna be looking at\nplanning each iteration.\n\n433\n00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, ready to go ahead and\n\n434\n00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.820\nlevel up, Jo.\n\n435\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.192\nHow was that?\n&gt;&gt; Dear [CROSSTALK].\n\n436\n00:25:37.192 --> 00:25:38.549\n&gt;&gt; The last episode you're like,\n\n437\n00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:39.410\nhey was that a joke?\n\n438\n00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.800\nSo I thought maybe I should have a joke.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n439\n00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.110\nlet's not.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n440\n00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.906\n&gt;&gt; Let's not do that.\n\n441\n00:25:43.906 --> 00:25:44.573\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n442\n00:25:44.573 --> 00:25:45.667\n&gt;&gt; Okay, ever.\n\n443\n00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:46.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ever!\n\n444\n00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.920\nAll right, thank you so much for\nbeing with us but we are gonna sign out.\n\n445\n00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.240\nI've been your host Cherokee

00:00:08.467\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:12.936\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone,\n\n5\n00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:14.860\nto your Agile Product Owners' Series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.790\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.909\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ntaking a look at our levels and\n\n8\n00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.293\nspecifically we are now\nat the iteration level.\n\n9\n00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:24.295\nAnd of course you know we have Mrs.\n\n10\n00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:27.412\nJo Peacock back in studios\nto help us with this topic.\n\n11\n00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:30.400\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.770\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.130\nI'm really excited to keep up.\n\n14\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.050\nWe're almost there.\n\n15\n00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.440\nWe've got just a few more,\ncouple more levels, right?\n\n16\n00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.350\nWhat level are we on here, now?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're on level four now, and\n\n17\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.560\nactually, we're going to do level four and\nfive together.\n\n18\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.660\nLevel four is the iteration.\n\n19\n00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.890\nAnd level five, are our daily, sort of,\ndaily stand-ups, our daily planning,\n\n20\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.350\nthat we do every morning.\n\n21\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.720\nAnd we're gonna actually\ncover those together.\n\n22\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.440\nIt makes sense just to,\nour daily stand-up, our daily planning,\n\n23\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.890\nis part of our iteration.\n\n24\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.190\nAnd there doesn't seem any\nsense in separating them.\n\n25\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.490\nI mean, you can.\n\n26\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.360\nBut for\nthe purpose of these particular episodes,\n\n27\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.960\nthere's absolutely no point at all.\n\n28\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.670\nSo we're going to cover them together.\n\n29\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.960\nSo of course, in level one,\nwe looked at preparing for\n\n30\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.070\nour vision and planning for our vision.\n\n31\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.071\nAnd can you remember how long\nwe planned our vision and\n\n32\n00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:21.874\nour events?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n33\n00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:22.987\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:22.987 --> 00:01:23.819\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:26.203\n&gt;&gt; Well, that would have been 12 of\n\n36\n00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:29.501\nmonths, wasn't it, Cherokee?\n&gt;&gt; I do, okay.\n\n37\n00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:30.191\n&gt;&gt; You remember,\n\n38\n00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:33.426\nright, that was our elevator pitch.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n39\n00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.686\n&gt;&gt; 12 months, got it.\n\n41\n00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:37.001\n&gt;&gt; 12 months, yeah,\n\n42\n00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:41.823\nthat was a real high level plan and then\nwe had our roadmap underneath that, and\n\n43\n00:01:41.823 --> 00:01:44.690\nof course, we planned that for\nthree months.\n\n44\n00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.923\nThere we go, see look,\nshe did really well with that.\n\n45\n00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:52.347\nAnd then of course, our release and how\nlong in advance did we plan our release\n\n46\n00:01:52.347 --> 00:01:53.549\nfor?\n&gt;&gt; One month.\n\n47\n00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.805\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n48\n00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:56.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See?\n\n49\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.950\nShe's remembered so much!\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I know you guys have too, so\n\n50\n00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.100\nthis is perfect for just a review for us.\n\n51\n00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.837\nThat's all.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so now,\n\n52\n00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:08.166\nwe plan our iterations and\nour iterations are going to be a sprint,\n\n53\n00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.000\nas you might call them.\n\n54\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.270\nEven a time box.\n\n55\n00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.151\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; See, look I'm preparing you here,\n\n56\n00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:15.794\nI'm giving you a chance to-\n&gt;&gt; I know this, I mean, she would\n\n57\n00:02:15.794 --> 00:02:19.398\nprobably wack me if I got this one wrong.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So?\n\n58\n00:02:19.398 --> 00:02:20.160\n&gt;&gt; One to four weeks.\n\n59\n00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.137\n&gt;&gt; Hey, all right, okay, yeah,\n\n60\n00:02:22.137 --> 00:02:26.690\nI'm impressed now, but\nI'm impressed very, very easily.\n\n61\n00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.990\nSo our iteration then,\none to four weeks in duration,\n\n62\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.880\nthat's got to include testing as well.\n\n63\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.760\nNow, I know that in another series we took\na look more specifically at Agile testing,\n\n64\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.814\nthe types of tests that we do.\n\n65\n00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:46.030\nBut I wanna talk about this now, because\nwhen we're planning for our iteration,\n\n66\n00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.412\nyou've not just got to plan for\ndevelopment,\n\n67\n00:02:48.412 --> 00:02:51.210\nyou've also got to plan to test, too.\n\n68\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.000\nNow the longer the iteration lasts for,\nthat would generally mean the more\n\n69\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.867\nyou're gonna get into that iteration,\nand therefore the bigger the test,\n\n70\n00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:04.690\nand that means the more time\nit's gonna take to do the test.\n\n71\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.680\nSo when it comes to iteration planning,\nyou're not just planning the development\n\n72\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.140\nwork, you're also planning\nthe testing as well.\n\n73\n00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.858\nNow, we've also gotta get why\nwe're talking about this.\n\n74\n00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:20.480\nI wanna think about the relationships\nbetween the iterations and the release.\n\n75\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.980\nAn iteration is what we develop.\n\n76\n00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.370\nIt's a chunk of development work,\nshould we say.\n\n77\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.267\nThe release is what we release\nto the end user to the business.\n\n78\n00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:38.600\nWe don't release the minute we\nfinish development, necessarily.\n\n79\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.531\nIf an iteration is every week or maybe\nevery two weeks, then we may not, may,\n\n80\n00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:52.950\nwe may not release to the user environment\nand to the customer every two weeks.\n\n81\n00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.050\nWe may choose to bundle two or\nthree iterations together and\n\n82\n00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.570\nthen maybe we release every three months.\n\n83\n00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.570\nThere are no set rules, it really is\ndependent on the project, it depends\n\n84\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.500\non what it is that you are developing but\nalso depends on your user environment.\n\n85\n00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:14.210\nAnd I know that we've spoken in previous\nepisodes about getting that planning\n\n86\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.600\nright and getting your timing\nright because you simply\n\n87\n00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.950\nneed to understand who your users are and\nunderstand what they will accommodate.\n\n88\n00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.070\nAnd that goes back to\ndefining the use of personas,\n\n89\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.390\nunderstanding what it is\nyour users accommodate.\n\n90\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.000\nNow, we had two user personas that we\ntalked about in previous episodes.\n\n91\n00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.790\nWe've got Mary and we've got Cherokee.\n\n92\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.088\nAnd Mary, of course, is a person if you\nremember from our previous episodes,\n\n93\n00:04:39.088 --> 00:04:43.423\nshe likes to have things sort\nof written down step-by-step and\n\n94\n00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:46.091\nshe likes to do things very precisely.\n\n95\n00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:49.971\nWhereas Cherokee,\nas another user persona, well,\n\n96\n00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:56.275\nCherokee likes things to be intuitive, but\nshe like to figure things out for herself.\n\n97\n00:04:56.275 --> 00:04:59.275\nShe doesn't need step-by-step procedures.\n\n98\n00:04:59.275 --> 00:05:03.982\nSo if we're thinking about sort of, I know\nwe're gonna be talking about Cherokee in\n\n99\n00:05:03.982 --> 00:05:05.520\nthe third person now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n100\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.231\n&gt;&gt; But anyway,\n\n101\n00:05:06.231 --> 00:05:09.410\nbut if we were to think about\nthose two user personas.\n\n102\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.224\nI mean, let's think about about how\noften we should release to those\n\n103\n00:05:14.224 --> 00:05:15.890\nparticular personas.\n\n104\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.646\nSo Mary, she likes things written down,\n\n105\n00:05:18.646 --> 00:05:22.112\nshe likes to make sure that\neverything is precise and\n\n106\n00:05:22.112 --> 00:05:27.070\nshe likes to get it right, but she likes\nto stick to her way of doing things,\n\n107\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.910\nhow often do we release to Mary?\n&gt;&gt; I think less than Cherokee,\n\n108\n00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.699\nbecause Mary seems like someone who gets\ncomfortable in a pattern or some kind of\n\n109\n00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.980\njust like constant, they don't like to\nbe bothered with that sort of thing.\n\n110\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.520\nAnd Cherokee is a little\nmore apt to change.\n\n111\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n112\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.218\nThis is what and by the way, you'll\nsee that the conversations that we're\n\n113\n00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:55.572\nhaving right now are the conversations\nthat I expect you to have in\n\n114\n00:05:55.572 --> 00:05:59.792\nyour environment when you're\ndiscussing release planning.\n\n115\n00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:03.342\nAnd when you're discussing what's\ngoing to be in iterations, as well.\n\n116\n00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:05.820\nSo let's carry on then.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n117\n00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.120\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying that Mary,\n\n118\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.120\nwe wouldn't release to as frequently,\n\n119\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.604\nbecause Mary doesn't accommodate change.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mary probably wouldn't be\n\n120\n00:06:13.604 --> 00:06:16.964\nable to deal with issues that\nmay come from those disruptions.\n\n121\n00:06:16.964 --> 00:06:20.143\nWhereas if I have my\ntechnical side of things,\n\n122\n00:06:20.143 --> 00:06:25.361\nI would be able to overcome them if they,\nthe releases were more frequent and\n\n123\n00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:28.230\nmaybe they were a little bit cumbersome.\n\n124\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.648\nI mean, I've dealt with releases\nbefore that weren't the greatest.\n\n125\n00:06:31.648 --> 00:06:35.513\nSo maybe just wait and\nbundle those as a package for Mary.\n\n126\n00:06:35.513 --> 00:06:40.390\nAnd I'm able to be more swift about\ndealing with those new releases.\n\n127\n00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\n\n128\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.980\nI see where you're coming from.\n\n129\n00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.250\nBut if I bundle everything together,\nthen surely then the disruption\n\n130\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.520\nto Mary is gonna be greater.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n131\n00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.844\n&gt;&gt; So she might not be able\n\n132\n00:06:53.844 --> 00:06:57.348\nto handle that amount of disruption.\n&gt;&gt; What is Mary able to handle?\n\n133\n00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:00.543\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She may prefer things in smaller\n\n134\n00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:04.040\nchunks.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, I don't know.\n\n135\n00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.760\n&gt;&gt; And it could be that Cherokee,\n\n136\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.410\nwho is more adaptable, and Cherokee who\n\n137\n00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.640\nis more willing to embrace change and\nwilling to embrace new ideas.\n\n138\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.609\nThat she's willing to accommodate\nmore frequent updates, because to her\n\n139\n00:07:20.609 --> 00:07:25.275\na more frequent update is just something\nthat, yeah, it works like this now.\n\n140\n00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:30.765\nThat's great, You see, there are two\nsides to every story, and this\n\n141\n00:07:30.765 --> 00:07:34.132\nis why I wanted us to have this debate.\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, and\n\n142\n00:07:34.132 --> 00:07:35.907\nwe know this is not scripted.\n\n143\n00:07:35.907 --> 00:07:37.947\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH] but\n\n144\n00:07:37.947 --> 00:07:42.754\nthis is a debate that you have\nto have in your environment.\n\n145\n00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:47.980\nThis is a real debate that has to happen\nin project planning all the time and\n\n146\n00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.128\nyou can only do this if you\nunderstand your user personas.\n\n147\n00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:56.841\nAnd we looked in previous episodes, the\norganization that doesn't understand their\n\n148\n00:07:56.841 --> 00:08:00.830\nuser personas, that doesn't even\ndocument their user personas.\n\n149\n00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.600\nSo this conversation would never\nhappen in some organizations.\n\n150\n00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.893\nSo if this conversation doesn't happen,\n\n151\n00:08:07.893 --> 00:08:11.600\nthen how do we schedule when\nwe're going to release, right?\n\n152\n00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.171\nHow do actually decide what's\ngoing to be in each iteration.\n\n153\n00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:19.594\nYou can only do that if you\nreally understand your users.\n\n154\n00:08:19.594 --> 00:08:23.596\nAnd now we got ourselves into a bit of\na dilemma because we've got two different\n\n155\n00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:24.590\nuser types.\n\n156\n00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.650\nBoth with exactly the same functionality.\n\n157\n00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:32.610\nRemember we're talking about our online or\nmobile shopping experience.\n\n158\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.650\nSo we've got this particular app\nthat we want to release, and\n\n159\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.030\nwe want to really sit in an iterative way.\n\n160\n00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.143\nSo we're gonna release, we're gonna add\nin new functionality with every single\n\n161\n00:08:42.143 --> 00:08:45.073\nrelease, not necessarily\nwith every single iteration.\n\n162\n00:08:45.073 --> 00:08:48.660\nWe're not releasing new\nfunctionality with every iteration.\n\n163\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.540\nSo we're going to be doing that,\nbut we've gotta make sure\n\n164\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:59.100\nthat we add in functionality and we add in\nvalue for both Mary and for Charis Cain.\n\n165\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.600\nSo how do we do that?\n&gt;&gt; Well, for\n\n166\n00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.780\nme, I feel like I don't know enough about\nMary so, I would want more information.\n\n167\n00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.690\nAny kind of maybe statistics or\n\n168\n00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.020\nsome kind a customer feedback that would\ngive me a little bit more insight.\n\n169\n00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.155\nBecause right now, I know I can't\nmake the best decision with what I\n\n170\n00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:16.722\nhave.\n&gt;&gt; Right, but then at the same time, we're\n\n171\n00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:20.615\nstill going to end up with that dilemma,\neven if you need more information.\n\n172\n00:09:20.615 --> 00:09:22.476\nYou're gonna find out more information,\n\n173\n00:09:22.476 --> 00:09:24.860\nyou're probably then\ngoing to spend some time.\n\n174\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.990\nAnd don't forget this is all gonna\nbe done within the iteration itself.\n\n175\n00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.310\nSo if you're gonna spend some time\ngetting to know your user, well,\n\n176\n00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.805\nI said don't forget it gonna\nbe done in the iteration.\n\n177\n00:09:35.805 --> 00:09:39.830\nYou're gonna have some interaction\nwith the user during that iteration.\n\n178\n00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.440\nBut a lot of the user persona\nis going to be developed\n\n179\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.376\nright to the very beginning\nby the product donor.\n\n180\n00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:51.318\nBut nevertheless where at that point now\nwhere we know that is what we want to do.\n\n181\n00:09:51.318 --> 00:09:54.419\nWe've all ready agreed on our vision and\nwe've all ready done some really spanning.\n\n182\n00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:59.222\nAnd now we really want to know exactly\nwhat we could include in every interation\n\n183\n00:09:59.222 --> 00:10:01.130\nin order for it to be released.\n\n184\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.190\nSo now we're gonna look at\nthose few user personas.\n\n185\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.486\nAnd Cherokee just ascertained that we\ndon't have enough information in that\n\n186\n00:10:07.486 --> 00:10:08.800\nuser persona.\n\n187\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.130\nSo she's gonna have to\nspend some time with Mary\n\n188\n00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.775\nto find out [CROSS-TALK] to find\nout exactly how Mary works.\n\n189\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.980\nSo what went wrong?\n&gt;&gt; With what?\n\n190\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, something went wrong, didnt it?\n\n191\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.416\nBecause we're now in a position\nwhere we should be in\n\n192\n00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:28.315\nan iteration.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n193\n00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:30.910\nwe should be developing.\n&gt;&gt; We should already have had our user\n\n194\n00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.830\nperson as defined ahead of time.\n&gt;&gt; We should have had them defined enough.\n\n195\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.324\nWe should have had them developed.\n\n196\n00:10:36.324 --> 00:10:41.244\nThey should have been defined\nto a specific enough state that\n\n197\n00:10:41.244 --> 00:10:45.850\nyou shouldn't be asking those questions.\n&gt;&gt; During the iteration.\n\n198\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what went wrong.\n\n199\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.810\nSee that's part of your product owners\nresponsibilities to make sure that this\n\n200\n00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:57.610\nuser persona are so\nwell articulated that if the developer\n\n201\n00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.060\nhas got any questions, the questions\nare answered in the user persona or\n\n202\n00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.790\nthe questions can be answered\nby the product owner.\n\n203\n00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.510\nIf I'm playing the role of product\nowner in this particular scenario that\n\n204\n00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.500\nwe're talking about now,\nyou're coming to me with questions and\n\n205\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.050\nyou'll say, well,\nI don't know how Mary works.\n\n206\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.560\nBut right now, I know straight away that\nmany of you have asked that question.\n\n207\n00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.065\nI know straight away that this\niteration is not going to produce\n\n208\n00:11:23.065 --> 00:11:26.897\nthe user story that I thought\nit was going to produce.\n\n209\n00:11:26.897 --> 00:11:28.869\nBecause if you are asking\nthat question and\n\n210\n00:11:28.869 --> 00:11:32.530\nthat to me says that you're gonna\nstay next day or two, right?\n\n211\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.710\nSitting with Mary,\ngetting off your bum as I like to say,\n\n212\n00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.430\ngoing out with Mary observing directly and\nseeing how Mary works.\n\n213\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.620\nThat's two days worth of development\nwork that you're not going to be doing,\n\n214\n00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:48.265\nwhich means that that's\nsomething that I haven't done.\n\n215\n00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:51.805\nIt's something that, well, I missed.\n\n216\n00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:56.175\nBecause right at the very beginning,\nI should have defined that use of persona.\n\n217\n00:11:56.175 --> 00:12:00.785\nI should have articulated it with such\na great detail that you shouldn't\n\n218\n00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:01.945\nbe asking those questions.\n\n219\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.330\nThis is worth spending time discussing\nbecause this is something that happens\n\n220\n00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.900\non a day to day basis in\nevery single project.\n\n221\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.659\nBut yet it's something that's overlooked\nbecause quite frankly when you\n\n222\n00:12:16.659 --> 00:12:21.717\nlook at any Agile textbook, when you look\nat any sort of scrum textbook or DSDM or\n\n223\n00:12:21.717 --> 00:12:26.624\nLean textbook, it just simply says ensure\nthat you define the user persona or\n\n224\n00:12:26.624 --> 00:12:29.141\nensure you know who you're user with.\n\n225\n00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:31.504\nAnd that's it.\nOne sentence can sum that up.\n\n226\n00:12:31.504 --> 00:12:38.177\nAnd yet if you don't it, then that's two\ndays worth of work that's lost, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:38.177 --> 00:12:40.193\nBut hang on a minute,\nthat's two days of worth of work for\n\n228\n00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:41.570\none developer that's lost.\n\n229\n00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.490\nSo what about in the next iteration where\nthere's another developer that's got\n\n230\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.200\nexactly that same question, and another\ndeveloper that's got that same question.\n\n231\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.250\nWe've got six to nine\ndevelopers per project,\n\n232\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.550\nthat's a lot of days\nthat's gonna be wasted.\n\n233\n00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.820\nOr because of that one sentence that says,\nwork out who your users are.\n\n234\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.650\nSo it's really important that we do that.\n\n235\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:06.000\nAnd that's why I wanna spend time\ntalking about this right now, because\n\n236\n00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.920\nthis is a dilemma that we all have.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't wanna go ahead, and\n\n237\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.161\nspend your time, and create.\n\n238\n00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:15.523\nPotentially, you could lose a lot more\ntime with this because if you develop\n\n239\n00:13:15.523 --> 00:13:19.272\na product that misses the mark,\nthen you're gonna have to go back\n\n240\n00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:23.291\nto the drawing board and who knows,\nat least potentially for weeks for\n\n241\n00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:27.538\nthe particular iteration.\n&gt;&gt; We spend a lot time in IT assuming.\n\n242\n00:13:27.538 --> 00:13:31.208\nAnd we assume that people know how\nto use certain things because, well,\n\n243\n00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:35.100\nthey must already have the email,\nso they must know how to use email.\n\n244\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.277\nBut some people don't.\n\n245\n00:13:36.277 --> 00:13:38.480\nIt's not intuitive to some people.\n\n246\n00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.610\nAnd so you can't just assume that\nyou're gonna give somebody an app and\n\n247\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.460\nthey're gonna know how to use or they're\ngonna be able to figure out how to use it.\n\n248\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.429\nYou just can't make that assumption, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:51.009\nAnd technically it'll be eight weeks.\n&gt;&gt; Technically would be\n\n250\n00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:51.646\neight-\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n251\n00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:56.314\nif I did have a four week iteration and I\nwouldn't just be losing my week that I had\n\n252\n00:13:56.314 --> 00:14:00.076\nspent pre-planning, but\nnow I have to go back and rework it, so\n\n253\n00:14:00.076 --> 00:14:02.060\ntechnically right weeks.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n254\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.730\nYeah cuz it's gonna be that particular\nstory is gonna be then put into another\n\n255\n00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.980\niteration.\n\n256\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.919\nBut then if you you've got a question\nabout that one story, then so\n\n257\n00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:14.714\nsomebody else that probably got a question\nabout there on the story, too, because-\n\n258\n00:14:14.714 --> 00:14:15.967\n&gt;&gt; It's just like a snow but\n\n259\n00:14:15.967 --> 00:14:19.595\ncrazy snow ball effect.\n&gt;&gt; Right, all because the product manager\n\n260\n00:14:19.595 --> 00:14:24.220\nor product owner, that would be me,\ndidn't do their job.\n\n261\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.310\nOverlooked something,\ndidn't think it was important.\n\n262\n00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.733\nThat's generally what happens is\nwe don't think it's important,\n\n263\n00:14:31.733 --> 00:14:36.700\nit's just one sentence and we don't\nthink that we need to accommodate that.\n\n264\n00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:42.701\nSo what then happens in an iteration and\nin a release?\n\n265\n00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:47.320\nSo release as we know is made up\nof multiple iterations or sprints.\n\n266\n00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.510\nOld time boxes if you want to call\nthem that, so what actually happens?\n\n267\n00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.070\nWell, we've got a quick graphic\nright in front of you there,\n\n268\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.250\nand you'll see just\nthe frame mark at a glance.\n\n269\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.940\nYou've seen this one before.\n\n270\n00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.258\nThere is me, there is my product owner\nthere in that left hand corner, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:04.258 --> 00:15:09.390\nAnd the product owner has\nthe responsibility for that backlog.\n\n272\n00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.731\nAnd they will have at the beginning of\nthat iteration, they will have a planning\n\n273\n00:15:14.731 --> 00:15:20.241\nmeeting that will plan exactly what's\ngoing to be in that particular iteration.\n\n274\n00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:25.225\nAnd we will break our tasks and\nstories maybe whole stories or\n\n275\n00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:29.400\nmaybe just individual tasks for the team.\n\n276\n00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.840\nWe'll break that out.\n\n277\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.120\nAnd that goes into that sprint or\n\n278\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.386\nthat iteration which lasts\nevery one to four weeks.\n\n279\n00:15:36.386 --> 00:15:41.619\nAnd the velocity and the capacity\nof that particular sprint, and\n\n280\n00:15:41.619 --> 00:15:47.057\nwe'll talk about that in a second,\nis managed by the scrum master.\n\n281\n00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:49.480\nBecause the scrum master\nis responsible for\n\n282\n00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.895\nmaking sure that the team works\nas they're supposed to work.\n\n283\n00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:59.022\nEvery day, every morning generally\nwe'll have that daily scrum meeting,\n\n284\n00:15:59.022 --> 00:16:01.613\nthat's that stand up\nas we like to call it.\n\n285\n00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:05.220\nAnd that happens every single day.\n\n286\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.794\nWithout a shadow of a doubt,\nI'm gonna put Cherokee on the spot again,\n\n287\n00:16:08.794 --> 00:16:10.411\njust because I like doing this.\n\n288\n00:16:10.411 --> 00:16:15.580\nHow long should a stand-up meeting last?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with 15 minutes,\n\n289\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.357\nfinal answer.\n\n290\n00:16:16.357 --> 00:16:17.031\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n291\n00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:18.300\nWell you know-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n292\n00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.316\n&gt;&gt; I put her on the spot, and\n\n293\n00:16:19.316 --> 00:16:22.870\nI know I'm not really putting her on the\nspot because we have one every morning.\n\n294\n00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.157\nAnd we know that we've gotta\nkeep it to under 15 minutes.\n\n295\n00:16:26.157 --> 00:16:30.658\nBut really, your daily stand-up meeting\nis a way of planning for the day.\n\n296\n00:16:30.658 --> 00:16:35.922\nIt's where everybody within\nthe team gets together, stands up,\n\n297\n00:16:35.922 --> 00:16:39.910\nthat's why it's called a stand-up meeting.\n&gt;&gt; Figure.\n\n298\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n299\n00:16:40.475 --> 00:16:41.113\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:16:41.113 --> 00:16:42.721\n&gt;&gt; We do that for\n\n301\n00:16:42.721 --> 00:16:45.918\na reason.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, more attentiveness?\n\n302\n00:16:45.918 --> 00:16:46.794\nAttentiveness?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n303\n00:16:46.794 --> 00:16:50.335\nit's to keep it short.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so people can get comfortable.\n\n304\n00:16:50.335 --> 00:16:53.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly why we do it.\n\n305\n00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.301\nIf you sit people around a desk-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n306\n00:16:55.301 --> 00:16:57.360\n&gt;&gt; They're likely to get comfortable.\n\n307\n00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.006\nAnd it's gonna go on for\nmore than 15 minutes.\n\n308\n00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:03.601\nIf we stand up, and we literally just go\naround the room, nobody wants to stand for\n\n309\n00:17:03.601 --> 00:17:06.737\nlonger than 15 minutes.\n&gt;&gt; I feel like this should also be\n\n310\n00:17:06.737 --> 00:17:08.910\na stretching time for us in the morning.\n\n311\n00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:13.040\nI don't know why, but I do feel the urge\nsome mornings to stretch while we're doing\n\n312\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.344\nthis.\n&gt;&gt; Well you know some cultures do that.\n\n313\n00:17:15.344 --> 00:17:16.245\n&gt;&gt; I mean hey,\n\n314\n00:17:16.245 --> 00:17:17.900\nmight as well.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n315\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.951\nsome cultures will actually do exercises\nwith the staff before their day.\n\n316\n00:17:22.951 --> 00:17:26.450\nSo you wanna start that,\nthen you go for it.\n\n317\n00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.604\nI might just be in the cafeteria\nwhile you're doing\n\n318\n00:17:29.604 --> 00:17:30.546\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:17:30.546 --> 00:17:33.320\n&gt;&gt; Just saying.\n\n320\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.958\nSo we've got our daily stand-up meeting.\n\n321\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:40.058\nAnd our daily stand-up meeting is\nliterally where we stand up, and we go\n\n322\n00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:46.030\naround the room and we just tell everybody\nthis is what our plans are for the day.\n\n323\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.021\nAnd we do that for number of reasons,\n\n324\n00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:51.040\nmainly because if somebody\nelse wants a bit of our time,\n\n325\n00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.233\nthen that's their time to stand up and\nsay hey look, can I have five minutes?\n\n326\n00:17:55.233 --> 00:17:59.498\nAlso, if somebody's experiencing any\nproblems, then it gives opportunity for\n\n327\n00:17:59.498 --> 00:18:02.840\nsomebody else to say hey look,\nI can help you with that.\n\n328\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.873\nAnd also, we really wanna\ncommunicate success as well,\n\n329\n00:18:06.873 --> 00:18:09.064\nthis is what we've achieved.\n\n330\n00:18:09.064 --> 00:18:11.916\nThe Scrum Master will also have access.\n\n331\n00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:16.714\nIn the top right-hand corner there,\nyou'll see that the Scrum Master has\n\n332\n00:18:16.714 --> 00:18:21.055\naccess to the burndown and\nburnup charts which you basically just,\n\n333\n00:18:21.055 --> 00:18:24.352\na burndown charts is how\nmuch we've got left to do.\n\n334\n00:18:24.352 --> 00:18:30.194\nSo hopefully we should be burning down on\nour progress with what we've got left.\n\n335\n00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:32.864\nAnd our burnup is how\nmuch have we achieved.\n\n336\n00:18:32.864 --> 00:18:33.925\n&gt;&gt; The opposite of that.\n\n337\n00:18:33.925 --> 00:18:35.066\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's completely\n\n338\n00:18:35.066 --> 00:18:36.102\nthe opposite, okay.\n\n339\n00:18:36.102 --> 00:18:40.526\nAnd then of course at the end of\nthe sprint, then we're going to\n\n340\n00:18:40.526 --> 00:18:45.454\nconduct a review just to make sure\nthat everything is completed before\n\n341\n00:18:45.454 --> 00:18:50.770\nwe finish that particular sprint,\nor that particular iteration.\n\n342\n00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.628\nAnd then after we've completed that,\n\n343\n00:18:52.628 --> 00:18:56.527\nthen we conduct that retrospective that\njust really looks at well, how did we do.\n\n344\n00:18:56.527 --> 00:18:58.660\nWhat did we do well.\n\n345\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:03.795\nWhat can we apply to our next iteration,\nand what did we not do so well.\n\n346\n00:19:03.795 --> 00:19:08.820\nRemember that over time,\nour team will evolve.\n\n347\n00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.559\nAnd over time,\nour teamwork will get better.\n\n348\n00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:16.470\nAnd our, well what we call capacity,\nwill increase.\n\n349\n00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.286\nAnd our velocity should\nhopefully improve as well.\n\n350\n00:19:19.286 --> 00:19:23.546\nSo something that we might develop\nright at the beginning of a project,\n\n351\n00:19:23.546 --> 00:19:27.450\nit might take us four weeks to\nactually develop one story.\n\n352\n00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.514\nThen by the time that team has been\ntogether six months, it might only take us\n\n353\n00:19:31.514 --> 00:19:35.644\na week to develop that story because\nwe understand each other's skills, and\n\n354\n00:19:35.644 --> 00:19:39.033\nwe've also learned as we've gone along,\nso we've evolved.\n\n355\n00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:40.830\nI expect that to happen.\n\n356\n00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.906\nProjects fail, and Agile projects fail.\n\n357\n00:19:44.906 --> 00:19:49.076\nAnd as a product owner,\nand you're responsible for\n\n358\n00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:52.568\ndelivering the actual product itself.\n\n359\n00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:57.286\nSo you wanna make sure that quality\nis there right away from the start.\n\n360\n00:19:57.286 --> 00:20:01.789\nIf you're going to ensure that\nquality is there right from the start,\n\n361\n00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:04.560\nyou can't be too ambitious.\n\n362\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.025\nYou and the Scrum Master have gotta\nwork out between the two of you,\n\n363\n00:20:09.025 --> 00:20:13.591\na realistic schedule for\neach iteration right from the very start.\n\n364\n00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:15.540\nAnd you just accept.\n\n365\n00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:20.757\nYou have to accept that at the beginning\nof a project, you are not going to be as\n\n366\n00:20:20.757 --> 00:20:26.319\nproductive as a team as you will be three\nmonths, and six months into the project.\n\n367\n00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:30.110\nBecause quite simply, you're gonna have\nnew team members working together.\n\n368\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.315\nAnd even if it's still existing\nteam members working together,\n\n369\n00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.424\nthey're going to be learning new skills.\n\n370\n00:20:35.424 --> 00:20:40.540\nAnd so you're not going to\nhave a fully cohesive team.\n\n371\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.316\nAnd you're certainly not going\nto have an efficient team,\n\n372\n00:20:43.316 --> 00:20:45.658\nbecause they're going to\nbe learning as they go.\n\n373\n00:20:45.658 --> 00:20:50.596\nSo the key here when you're planning\nyour individual iterations at\n\n374\n00:20:50.596 --> 00:20:54.560\nthe start of the project,\ndon't expect too much.\n\n375\n00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.595\nYou shouldn't do that, okay?\n\n376\n00:20:56.595 --> 00:21:01.148\nBe realistic about this because that way,\nyou can manage expectations, and\n\n377\n00:21:01.148 --> 00:21:03.970\nyou can manage user expectations as well.\n\n378\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.037\nThere's nothing worse with our users and\n\n379\n00:21:06.037 --> 00:21:09.826\nwith our customers than promising\nsomething, and then underdelivering.\n\n380\n00:21:09.826 --> 00:21:13.440\nWhat we want to do is kind of\nunderpromise and overdeliver.\n\n381\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.885\nThat's what not only builds up momentum,\nbut\n\n382\n00:21:15.885 --> 00:21:18.774\nit's what also sets customer\nconfidence in us, too.\n\n383\n00:21:18.774 --> 00:21:21.517\nAnd that's really what we want to do,\n\n384\n00:21:21.517 --> 00:21:25.920\nwe wanna deliver value to our\ncustomers and to our end users.\n\n385\n00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.825\nSo when you're planning your iteration,\nwell, at the beginning of each iteration,\n\n386\n00:21:30.825 --> 00:21:34.804\nthe product owners as we've said,\nand the team, collaboratively.\n\n387\n00:21:34.804 --> 00:21:41.390\nRemember, we value collaboration\ncollaboratively as a self-organizing team.\n\n388\n00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:46.767\nWe will work out what stories are going\nto be in each iteration, and what we\n\n389\n00:21:46.767 --> 00:21:52.263\ncan do at the beginning of that iteration,\nthis is what we plan to achieve.\n\n390\n00:21:52.263 --> 00:21:56.720\nThis is not something that the project\nowner just arbitrarily decides.\n\n391\n00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.850\nThe product owner doesn't say,\nthis is what you're doing.\n\n392\n00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.742\nIt's really down to you to say,\nI don't think we can do this, or\n\n393\n00:22:03.742 --> 00:22:05.770\nI need more information.\n\n394\n00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.868\nAs in the case of what we just discussed,\n\n395\n00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:10.663\nI need more information in\norder to be able to do that.\n\n396\n00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:13.360\nI'm gonna have to go and\nsit with Mary for a couple of days.\n\n397\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.168\nAnd so this gives us\nthe opportunity of the planning for\n\n398\n00:22:18.168 --> 00:22:20.696\nthe stories to be reviewed by Cherokee.\n\n399\n00:22:20.696 --> 00:22:24.122\n[LAUGH] And for\nher to ask questions of me.\n\n400\n00:22:24.122 --> 00:22:27.271\nAnd for me to realize that\nactually I was at fault here,\n\n401\n00:22:27.271 --> 00:22:30.090\nand I didn't clarify\nthe user story correctly.\n\n402\n00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.320\nAnd so, or sorry, I didn't clarify\nthe user persona correctly.\n\n403\n00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.334\nAnd so now what I've gotta do is\ngo back and revisit the persona.\n\n404\n00:22:37.334 --> 00:22:42.201\nAnd so what I would probably do to get\nmyself out of this hole in this case\n\n405\n00:22:42.201 --> 00:22:46.242\nis I would accept that if you\ndidn't know who Mary was, and\n\n406\n00:22:46.242 --> 00:22:51.438\nyou didn't know exactly how she worked,\nand you needed to do something for\n\n407\n00:22:51.438 --> 00:22:55.600\nher, then what I would do is I\nwould ask you to observe Mary.\n\n408\n00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.282\nBut at the same time,\nI would be amending that user persona.\n\n409\n00:22:59.282 --> 00:23:03.252\nAnd I may well ask you,\nremember about shared skills and\n\n410\n00:23:03.252 --> 00:23:04.593\ncollaboration?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n411\n00:23:04.593 --> 00:23:06.664\n&gt;&gt; I'll probably ask you to amend the user\n\n412\n00:23:06.664 --> 00:23:08.104\npersona at the same time.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n413\n00:23:08.104 --> 00:23:09.931\n&gt;&gt; Because the one thing that we know\n\n414\n00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:13.193\nabout Mary is if Mary's feeling\nslightly uncomfortable,\n\n415\n00:23:13.193 --> 00:23:17.565\nor if Mary's feeling slightly less than\nconfident, she's probably not gonna\n\n416\n00:23:17.565 --> 00:23:21.638\nappreciate five people standing\naround her watching what she's doing.\n\n417\n00:23:21.638 --> 00:23:22.189\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:23:22.189 --> 00:23:23.881\n&gt;&gt; So maybe I'll leave that to you.\n\n419\n00:23:23.881 --> 00:23:25.651\nThere you go.\n&gt;&gt; I'm okay with it,\n\n420\n00:23:25.651 --> 00:23:26.760\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; See, look at that.\n\n421\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.487\nHand it off, right?\n\n422\n00:23:27.487 --> 00:23:31.510\n[LAUGH] But this is the opportunity\nwhere we discuss this.\n\n423\n00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.660\nWe don't discuss this.\n\n424\n00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.430\nThis is not something that\nshould come up in a stand-up,\n\n425\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.569\nsort of halfway through that users story-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n426\n00:23:38.569 --> 00:23:40.195\n&gt;&gt; When Cherokee just says to me,\n\n427\n00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:42.270\nwell I don't know who my users are,\nreally.\n\n428\n00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.194\n&gt;&gt; That's not failing fast.\n\n429\n00:23:43.194 --> 00:23:44.939\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, fail fast.\n\n430\n00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:50.856\nHighlight any problems, any issues,\nright at the very beginning.\n\n431\n00:23:50.856 --> 00:23:56.218\nAnd so what we do is attain,\nright at the beginning of the iteration,\n\n432\n00:23:56.218 --> 00:23:59.639\nis that we're going to\ntask out each story,\n\n433\n00:23:59.639 --> 00:24:04.355\nthen we're going to assign those\nideal days To each task, so\n\n434\n00:24:04.355 --> 00:24:09.690\nthat we know exactly how long\nit's going to take us to deliver.\n\n435\n00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:14.110\nNow, notice we're not talking\nabout estimation anymore.\n\n436\n00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.380\nI am using the word exact.\n\n437\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.630\nAnd I know in previous episodes,\n\n438\n00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:21.220\nI used the word estimate and exact in\nthe same sentence, but I try not to.\n\n439\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.570\nBut in this case now, what we're doing is\nwe're exactly planning out our ideal days.\n\n440\n00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.140\nThis is where we're allocating our time.\n\n441\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.990\nThis is where we're doing, basically, time\nmanagement because what we're doing is\n\n442\n00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:37.120\nwe're planning for\nthe next maybe one week or two weeks.\n\n443\n00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.800\nWhich means we should be in\na position where we can ascertain\n\n444\n00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.580\nexactly how long it's going to take us\nto do something, based on our skills.\n\n445\n00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.420\nRight at the start of the iteration\nis when you say to me,\n\n446\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.740\nI don't have enough information or I don't\nhave enough skills to be able to do that.\n\n447\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.670\nAnd so it's at that point in\ntime where we'll say, well,\n\n448\n00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.360\nwe can't estimate,\nwe cannot assign ideal days for\n\n449\n00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.160\nthat because you don't have enough\ninformation or enough skills.\n\n450\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.565\nSo that's where you're gonna have to\ngo away and find that information, and\n\n451\n00:25:06.565 --> 00:25:10.314\nthat user's story's gonna be parked or\nshelved for the moment.\n\n452\n00:25:12.307 --> 00:25:17.251\nSo iteration planning then,\nthat's over when we have,\n\n453\n00:25:17.251 --> 00:25:21.520\nthe wording on this one's slightly funny.\n\n454\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.595\nAnd what I don't mean is,\nwhen we've actually done it [LAUGH] but\n\n455\n00:25:25.595 --> 00:25:30.060\nwhen the team has reached their\nthreshold for velocity and capacity.\n\n456\n00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:36.640\nSo in other words, we have a set threshold\nfor velocity and capacity within the day.\n\n457\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.935\nSo we will say that, okay,\nif this is per week, for instance.\n\n458\n00:25:41.935 --> 00:25:44.760\nWe've got six developers per week.\n\n459\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.650\nWe've got six developers with us.\n\n460\n00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:51.230\nAnd so how many ideal hours\ndo you think we get in a day?\n\n461\n00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.848\n&gt;&gt; With six individuals?\n\n462\n00:25:53.848 --> 00:25:55.790\nHow many hours?\n[CROSSTALK] Okay, one person,\n\n463\n00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.827\nI know this because I was\na little bit shocked too.\n\n464\n00:25:58.827 --> 00:26:03.010\nIf it were like an eight hour\nworkday then it's 50% of your time.\n\n465\n00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.819\nSo four hours but I'm omitting, well,\nI didn't omit the lunch break so\n\n466\n00:26:06.819 --> 00:26:11.327\nmaybe if you have an hour or 30 minutes\nfor lunch, you'd wanna subtract that also.\n\n467\n00:26:11.327 --> 00:26:14.624\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's give us four hours,\n\n468\n00:26:14.624 --> 00:26:15.560\nyeah?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n469\n00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.140\n&gt;&gt; Four ideal hours.\n\n470\n00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.520\nSo that's basically half a day.\n\n471\n00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.874\nSo if we have got six people,\nsix developers,\n\n472\n00:26:22.874 --> 00:26:27.100\nthen really what we're getting is,\nfor every single day of the week\n\n473\n00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.093\nwe're only getting three days' worth,\nor three ideal days.\n\n474\n00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:38.684\nSo what we've gotta do is over a week,\nI don't know, how's your math?\n\n475\n00:26:38.684 --> 00:26:43.322\n[LAUGH] Three fives, 15?\n&gt;&gt; 15.\n\n476\n00:26:43.322 --> 00:26:45.436\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so there we go.\n\n477\n00:26:45.436 --> 00:26:47.329\nSo it's not that bad, not yet.\n\n478\n00:26:47.329 --> 00:26:51.573\nAnyway, we're gonna have a week long\niteration this time, just saying.\n\n479\n00:26:51.573 --> 00:26:52.701\nAll right, so\n\n480\n00:26:52.701 --> 00:26:56.012\nwe got 15 ideal days in that one week.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n481\n00:26:56.012 --> 00:26:57.990\n&gt;&gt; Over six developers.\n\n482\n00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.180\nSo now what we've gotta do is\nwe've gotta work out how much\n\n483\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:06.180\ncapacity we can deal with in that 15 days.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n484\n00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.290\n&gt;&gt; So what we can produce in that 15 days.\n\n485\n00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:13.000\nAnd that, of course,\nit depends on our velocity.\n\n486\n00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.310\nAnd our velocity is our speed,\nhow quickly we develop.\n\n487\n00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:22.100\nSo only whole stories,\nwe can only count whole stories.\n\n488\n00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.320\nSo if we look at our stories and we say,\nright okay, we'll we've got 5 stories,\n\n489\n00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.350\nwe've got 15 days,\nthat's 3 days per story.\n\n490\n00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:34.410\nI can either give it to just\na certain number of developers or\n\n491\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.440\nI can give it to all of the developers and\n\n492\n00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.570\nall of the developers can contribute\nto each individual story.\n\n493\n00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:46.748\nBut we may, in fact we should,\nadd in contingency into that as well.\n\n494\n00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:50.496\nAnd what we've gotta make\nsure is that we're going to\n\n495\n00:27:50.496 --> 00:27:54.450\ncomplete the story by the end\nof the iteration and test.\n\n496\n00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.330\nSo even though we'd said\nwe'd got 15 ideal days and\n\n497\n00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.760\ntherefore we should be able\nto maybe fit in 3 stories,\n\n498\n00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.540\nwe haven't included testing and\n\n499\n00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.810\nwe haven't included any contingency.\n&gt;&gt; What about unknowns?\n\n500\n00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.149\nDo we need to include those also?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n501\n00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:13.830\nwell that would be into our contingency.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n502\n00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:14.890\n&gt;&gt; So now,\n\n503\n00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:19.400\nwhat I want to do then as a product owner,\nI want to make sure.\n\n504\n00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.430\nAnd by the way, I'm working with\nthe scrum master on this one.\n\n505\n00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.630\nI want to make sure then that\n\n506\n00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.550\nI have completed stories at\nthe end of the iteration.\n\n507\n00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.019\nSo I'm not gonna say to you,\nI'd like you to do three stories.\n\n508\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:39.210\nBecause it might not get done, because we\nhaven't accommodated for the unknowns and\n\n509\n00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:44.980\nfor the contingency and we haven't\naccommodated for any testing as well.\n\n510\n00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.800\nSo I might say, right,\nokay I'd like two days,\n\n511\n00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.160\nI think that we can do two\nstories in that particular week.\n\n512\n00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.040\nBut the scrum master should know the team.\n\n513\n00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.290\nAnd the scrum master,\nwho's the person that's responsible for\n\n514\n00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:03.400\nall of the organization, I expect\nthe scrum master to be looking at me and\n\n515\n00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:08.623\nsay, well, actually, you know Cherokee\nsays she works four hours a day,\n\n516\n00:29:08.623 --> 00:29:10.345\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; I've seen her work.\n\n517\n00:29:10.345 --> 00:29:10.957\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n518\n00:29:10.957 --> 00:29:13.343\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n519\n00:29:13.343 --> 00:29:16.280\n&gt;&gt; Don't they use, no, it's not happening.\n\n520\n00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.615\nOr he might turn around and say, you know\nthat Cherokee, she works ten hours a day,\n\n521\n00:29:19.615 --> 00:29:23.383\nactually, and we'll get six hours\nproductive time out of her.\n\n522\n00:29:23.383 --> 00:29:27.137\nSo the scrum master is going to be\nthe person that based on sort of past\n\n523\n00:29:27.137 --> 00:29:28.082\nperformance.\n\n524\n00:29:28.082 --> 00:29:32.717\nThat is actually going to advise exactly\nwhat the ideal days are that he can\n\n525\n00:29:32.717 --> 00:29:33.880\nget out of the team.\n\n526\n00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:39.470\nAnd exactly what the capacity is\nthat we can expect from the team.\n\n527\n00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:43.868\nAnd it's at that point in time when the\nscrum master and the product owner will\n\n528\n00:29:43.868 --> 00:29:47.940\nsit down and say, okay then,\nthis is what we think that we can achieve.\n\n529\n00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.540\nBut I said something wrong there,\ndidn't I?\n\n530\n00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.310\nDid you pick it up?\n\n531\n00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.804\nCuz I did it deliberately.\n&gt;&gt; No, think that we can achieve?\n\n532\n00:29:56.804 --> 00:29:59.260\n&gt;&gt; No, no, it's not.\n\n533\n00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.570\nit's always gonna be a think,\nbecause we are in IT and\n\n534\n00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.190\nhow long is a piece of string, right?\n\n535\n00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:08.314\nWe can't guarantee anything in IT cuz\nwe don't know about the unknowns.\n\n536\n00:30:08.314 --> 00:30:12.557\nBut it's not this scrum master and\nthe product owner that set it,\n\n537\n00:30:12.557 --> 00:30:16.988\nit's done collaboratively within\nthe self-organizing team.\n\n538\n00:30:16.988 --> 00:30:22.598\nThe scrum master and\nthe product owner simply will advise.\n\n539\n00:30:22.598 --> 00:30:27.880\nIt's a self-organizing team\nthat will actually work\n\n540\n00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:33.175\nout what they can achieve\nwithin any given iteration.\n\n541\n00:30:33.175 --> 00:30:37.730\nSo on that little note,\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\n\n542\n00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:42.820\ngoing to call it a session for\nthis particular episode.\n\n543\n00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.002\nAnd then when we come back we're\ngoing to carry on with planning out\n\n544\n00:30:47.002 --> 00:30:49.824\niteration in a part two.\n&gt;&gt; Are we going to have to do more\n\n545\n00:30:49.824 --> 00:30:50.370\nmath, Jo?\n\n546\n00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.820\nI saw the term velocity and\n\n547\n00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.752\nI remember how that all works out.\n&gt;&gt; We may well have to, because in our\n\n548\n00:30:56.752 --> 00:31:02.240\nnext episode we're gonna start looking\nat setting the ideal hours and the ideal\n\n549\n00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.860\ndays and how many stories we can get in\nthe ideal days and expanding on that.\n\n550\n00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.888\nSo yeah, we may need a calculator for\nthis one, right?\n\n551\n00:31:10.888 --> 00:31:12.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right Jo, thanks for\n\n552\n00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.100\ngiving me the heads up but I think we are\nout of time for this show, we'll sign out.\n\n553\n00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.510\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n554\n00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.279\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n555\n00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:27.624\n[MUSIC]\n\n556\n00:31:27.624 --> 00:31:31.235\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.240\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.618\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:14.463\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to you\nagile product owner series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.463 --> 00:00:16.240\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.562\nSo here we are, we're into part two.\n\n8\n00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:22.472\nWe continue to look into this five\nlevels of planning and we're still gonna\n\n9\n00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:25.713\nbe looking at that iteration and\nalso our stand up face level.\n\n10\n00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.906\nAnd with us today back in studios,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n11\n00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:29.847\nThanks for joining us, Jo.\n\n12\n00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:30.462\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:31.265\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely great.\n\n14\n00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:32.066\nThank you, Cherokee.\n\n15\n00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:32.680\nHow are you?\n\n16\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.481\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n17\n00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:37.662\n&gt;&gt; How would you reply if I said\nactually I'm not feeling so great today?\n\n18\n00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:40.378\n&gt;&gt; Like why do I have to\nhost with you Cherokee?\n\n19\n00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:46.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] yeah, again,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, but seriously we do,\n\n20\n00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:51.644\nwe are getting closer and the last\none is that we're getting close but\n\n21\n00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:55.965\nI think this may be the episode for\nus to finish our levels.\n\n22\n00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:57.242\n&gt;&gt; It is, yes.\n\n23\n00:00:57.242 --> 00:01:01.259\nSo this is our final episode in planning.\n\n24\n00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:05.590\nWe're planning our project and for\nplanning we're now at iteration level.\n\n25\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.856\nWe had a part one.\n\n26\n00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:07.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:12.589\n&gt;&gt; Where we just looked at, we looked at\nvery briefly we looked at, so the planning\n\n28\n00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:17.611\niteration and stories and ideal days and\nwe looked at velocity very briefly.\n\n29\n00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.105\nBut really we spend a lot of time\ndiscussing what happens when things\n\n30\n00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:21.664\ngo wrong.\n\n31\n00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:25.791\nSo, for instance, if you don't understand\na user persona, then it doesn't\n\n32\n00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:30.307\nmatter how well you plan, you're never\nactually going to deliver quality product.\n\n33\n00:01:30.307 --> 00:01:34.440\nAnd what we really wanna do is we\nwanna aim to deliver quality product.\n\n34\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.234\nSo let's jump straight back\nin then without part two,\n\n35\n00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:43.105\nwhich is where we're going to be\nwrapping up planning our iteration.\n\n36\n00:01:43.105 --> 00:01:47.241\nAnd I stand up feast bird,\nit's our daily plan for,\n\n37\n00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.917\nas part of planing\nthe actual project itself.\n\n38\n00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:54.977\nBut we can wrap that in with our\niteration planning because it's something\n\n39\n00:01:54.977 --> 00:01:56.532\nthat will happen every day.\n\n40\n00:01:56.532 --> 00:02:00.603\nAnd of course, we explained about\nthe daily stand up in our last episode and\n\n41\n00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:04.104\nwe've explained about that in\nour fundamental series as well.\n\n42\n00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:07.948\nSo the daily stand up shouldn't be\nany surprise to anybody, it's very,\n\n43\n00:02:07.948 --> 00:02:11.117\nvery brief, bu it's a really,\nreally useful tool as well.\n\n44\n00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:15.842\nSo let's jump straight in then, let's\ncarry on from where we were earlier on,\n\n45\n00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:17.966\nwhen we finished our last episode.\n\n46\n00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:21.869\nAnd in our last episode,\nwe were talking about planning for\n\n47\n00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:24.454\nvelocity and planning for ideal days.\n\n48\n00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:27.313\nSo planning for velocity, you will see, so\n\n49\n00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:31.792\nwhat we have in front of us right now,\nin that right hand side, well,\n\n50\n00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:36.309\nthese could be our story cards, or\nthey could be our post-it notes.\n\n51\n00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:38.190\nThey look like post-it notes\nto me I don't know about you.\n\n52\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.851\n&gt;&gt; They do\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] and\n\n53\n00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:44.575\nwhat we're gonna do is we write out our\nstory on a card or on a post-it note.\n\n54\n00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:46.375\nThats where your story is written.\n\n55\n00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.227\nAnd then what we will\ndo is we will assign,\n\n56\n00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:51.924\nthis is a side from priority by the way.\n\n57\n00:02:51.924 --> 00:03:00.472\nWe will assign a velocity\nnumber to that story.\n\n58\n00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.064\nThis is a side from priority and\n\n59\n00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:07.051\nthat velocity number is\nhow many days we think or\n\n60\n00:03:07.051 --> 00:03:12.346\nhow many hours we think it's going\nto take to write that story.\n\n61\n00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:16.649\n&gt;&gt; Right, that was loosely based on a\nFibonacci process with the calculation of\n\n62\n00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:17.453\nthe numbers.\n\n63\n00:03:17.453 --> 00:03:20.146\n&gt;&gt; No, that's for prioritization.\n\n64\n00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:20.808\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n65\n00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:23.467\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nthat will always be the best in sight.\n\n66\n00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:25.568\n&gt;&gt; With all these numbers,\nI don't know if it's numerology or, yeah.\n\n67\n00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:27.862\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so no,\n\n68\n00:03:27.862 --> 00:03:32.140\nwhat we want to do is we're gonna\nbase this on what we call ideal days.\n\n69\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.080\nSo our story points are how\nmuch effort is going to\n\n70\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.396\ntake us to actually deliver\nthat particular story.\n\n71\n00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:43.327\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n72\n00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:47.855\n&gt;&gt; So, for instance, the estimate, you\ncan see that just in the right hand side,\n\n73\n00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:51.641\nwe got one that's got three points,\none that's got five points,\n\n74\n00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:52.873\none that's got one.\n\n75\n00:03:52.873 --> 00:03:56.153\nSo our estimated velocity for\nthis situation,\n\n76\n00:03:56.153 --> 00:04:00.007\nif this is what we want to\nfinish in the first situation,\n\n77\n00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:05.017\nwe'll see that we put 28 story points for\nthat particular iteration.\n\n78\n00:04:05.017 --> 00:04:09.659\nAnd the estimated velocity\nis exactly what we want to\n\n79\n00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.887\nachieve in that particular iteration,\nokay?\n\n80\n00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:21.409\nAnd then what we'll do is we'll\ndetermine what our ideal day is.\n\n81\n00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.919\nAnd we've already discussed this\nin our previous episode but\n\n82\n00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.342\nwe'll go over it again.\n\n83\n00:04:26.342 --> 00:04:31.873\nBecause you'll see that with a team\nof six people and one @ half-time,\n\n84\n00:04:31.873 --> 00:04:38.325\nif we could a four week iteration,then we\ngot 50% of the time that we don't look.\n\n85\n00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:42.673\nAnd so our estimated velocity\nis the number of people times by\n\n86\n00:04:42.673 --> 00:04:47.617\nthe number of weeks times by\nthe number of days but then times 0.5,\n\n87\n00:04:47.617 --> 00:04:52.152\ncuz we're only 50% productive,\nas we already worked out.\n\n88\n00:04:52.152 --> 00:04:55.426\nAnd that gives us our 55 ideal days.\n\n89\n00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:59.497\nNow, we did exactly the same in our\nlast episode, only in our last episode,\n\n90\n00:04:59.497 --> 00:05:01.544\nI asked you to get the calculator out.\n\n91\n00:05:01.544 --> 00:05:02.590\n&gt;&gt; I got a calculator.\n\n92\n00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.794\n&gt;&gt; Right, but now it's in front of you,\nnow you don't need it now.\n\n93\n00:05:05.794 --> 00:05:06.885\n&gt;&gt; Dodged a bullet there, Jo.\n\n94\n00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:11.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nwe know that our estimated velocity then,\n\n95\n00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.267\n55 ideal days over a four week period.\n\n96\n00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:16.417\nYou know what?\n\n97\n00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:19.986\nWhen you got six people, five and a half\npeople, cuz one of them is half-time,\n\n98\n00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.141\nwell, that doesn't sound\nlike a huge amount.\n\n99\n00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:27.092\nWell, what we've gotta do is we've got\nbe able to work out exactly how much\n\n100\n00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:31.588\nwe can fit in to that iteration and\nwe've gotta do that accurately.\n\n101\n00:05:31.588 --> 00:05:32.993\nSo we've got to be honest.\n\n102\n00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:37.343\nAnd that's something that I have\nsaid to you in previous episodes but\n\n103\n00:05:37.343 --> 00:05:41.330\nalso I have said this to you in\nour fundamentals series as well.\n\n104\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.850\nWe're gonna be really honest\nabout what we can achieve.\n\n105\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.974\nAnd we all like to think\nthat we're gonna be working\n\n106\n00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:53.870\nat 100% sort of effort 100% of the time.\n\n107\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.327\nAnd let's face it,\nwe like our managers to think that, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:59.327 --> 00:06:00.024\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n109\n00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:00.628\n&gt;&gt; We know that.\n\n110\n00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n111\n00:06:02.682 --> 00:06:06.678\nwe're managing a project here, so\nwe've gotta be really honest with this.\n\n112\n00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:11.421\nAnd we've gotta be honest with\nthe fact that we can't always achieve\n\n113\n00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.145\nwhat we want to achieve.\n\n114\n00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:20.750\nAnd even though we like to think that\nwe work all day every day, you don't.\n\n115\n00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.434\nStop trying to kid yourself.\n\n116\n00:06:22.434 --> 00:06:25.152\n[LAUGH] You don't, I mean I know I don't.\n\n117\n00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:28.356\nI'd like to think that I spend\nall day every day working.\n\n118\n00:06:28.356 --> 00:06:30.852\nTaylor, our director,\nwill tell you otherwise.\n\n119\n00:06:30.852 --> 00:06:32.625\n[LAUGH] Because Taylor, our director,\n\n120\n00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:35.914\nwill tell you about the conversations\nthat we have in between episodes.\n\n121\n00:06:35.914 --> 00:06:39.258\nWhich has absolutely\nnothing to do with work.\n\n122\n00:06:39.258 --> 00:06:42.017\nSo we've got to accept that for\n\n123\n00:06:42.017 --> 00:06:46.911\na lot of our day,\nwell 50% of it which is quite a lot.\n\n124\n00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:52.899\nA lot of our day is not productive and our\nproductive time is 50% productive time and\n\n125\n00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.909\nto be fair, that's a really good figure.\n\n126\n00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:00.835\nSo with that in mind,\nthat's when we work out exactly how much,\n\n127\n00:07:00.835 --> 00:07:05.034\nwe know how much effort is needed for\neach iteration and\n\n128\n00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:07.879\nwe know how many days now we've got.\n\n129\n00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:12.352\nAnd so now we say, right, okay,\nwell, in realistically, in 55 days,\n\n130\n00:07:12.352 --> 00:07:16.186\nwhich is what we have in front of us now,\nhow much can we achieve?\n\n131\n00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:19.862\nAnd how much can we achieve we go back and\nwe say right,\n\n132\n00:07:19.862 --> 00:07:23.319\nwell we need 28 days to\nachieve that iteration.\n\n133\n00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.869\nWe've also got to add in,\n\n134\n00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:29.388\nwe've also got to add in that test in as\nwell and we got to add in contingency.\n\n135\n00:07:29.388 --> 00:07:34.474\nSo actually that's probably\na really good sort of\n\n136\n00:07:34.474 --> 00:07:39.688\nfigure to stop at and\nwe'll stop at those stories.\n\n137\n00:07:39.688 --> 00:07:41.659\nThe other thing we don't want to do and\n\n138\n00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:45.365\nI'm just gonna go about to that picture\non the right hand corner there.\n\n139\n00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:50.433\nYou'll see that we've got six\nstories in that iteration.\n\n140\n00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:51.948\nSix stories for an iteration,\n\n141\n00:07:51.948 --> 00:07:55.688\nbearing in mind that we don't release\nat the end of every single iteration.\n\n142\n00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:58.764\nSix stories is probably enough for\nan iteration.\n\n143\n00:07:58.764 --> 00:08:02.927\nBecause if we were to release,\nlet's say every three iterations and\n\n144\n00:08:02.927 --> 00:08:05.813\nwe were to have six stories\nin each iiteration.\n\n145\n00:08:05.813 --> 00:08:08.642\nThat's 18 stories, that's 18 pieces of\n\n146\n00:08:08.642 --> 00:08:12.712\nfunctionality that we would be\nreleasing at any one point in time.\n\n147\n00:08:12.712 --> 00:08:14.513\nThat's more than enough.\n\n148\n00:08:14.513 --> 00:08:19.350\nIf we're going to be releasing every\nthree months, that's more than enough.\n\n149\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.770\nThink back to our previous episode and\nthink back to who our user personas are.\n\n150\n00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.410\nAnd how much they can accommodate,\n\n151\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.610\nhow much change they can\nphysically accommodate.\n\n152\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.070\nAnd you'll find that,\n\n153\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.610\nthey can't necessarily\naccommodate all of that change.\n\n154\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.820\nAnd so we don't want to overwhelm them.\n\n155\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.880\nWe want to add value to their environment.\n\n156\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.380\nWe don't want to overwhelm them.\n\n157\n00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.420\nSo for each iteration then we gather\nthe requirements from the customers, and\n\n158\n00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.770\nwe do this as a self-organizing team.\n\n159\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.560\nWe do this collaboratively, and\nwe hold our daily stand up meeting,\n\n160\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.695\nthat 15-minute meeting,\nwhere we coordinate all of our activities.\n\n161\n00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:01.713\nWhere we simply go around the room and\n\n162\n00:09:01.713 --> 00:09:04.920\nwe just tell everybody what\nwe've got planned for today.\n\n163\n00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.350\nAnd it gives other people opportunity\nto kind of chip in and offer to help.\n\n164\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.970\nOr maybe to express any\nconcerns that they may have,\n\n165\n00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.755\nor to highlight any sort of issues\nthat they may have as well.\n\n166\n00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:21.080\nThat somebody else might\nbe able to help with.\n\n167\n00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.870\nAnd what we've got to do throughout that\niteration is, we have got to design and\n\n168\n00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:31.100\nbuild the production-ready solution.\n\n169\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.437\nSo we know what done means because we\nwork out the definition of done for\n\n170\n00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:40.243\neach user's story when we\ndefine the user story.\n\n171\n00:09:40.243 --> 00:09:45.576\nAs what we have to achieve at the end of\nthe iteration is we have to ensure that\n\n172\n00:09:45.576 --> 00:09:50.948\nthe user stories that we set out to\nachieve have met the definition of done.\n\n173\n00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:54.005\nIn other words, we've done what\nwe said we were going to do,\n\n174\n00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:58.190\nwe've delivered the functionality that\nwe said we were going to deliver.\n\n175\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.100\nYou're looking at me, Cherokee.\n\n176\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.656\nI can see it out of the corner of my eye,\n\n177\n00:10:02.656 --> 00:10:05.920\nI had a feeling that you were\ngoing to say something there.\n\n178\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.848\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n179\n00:10:07.848 --> 00:10:10.204\n&gt;&gt; She's smiling though, I'm scared.\n\n180\n00:10:10.204 --> 00:10:11.042\n&gt;&gt; I'll give it a minute.\n\n181\n00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:16.642\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So for each iteration, you've\ngot to remember that once we started\n\n182\n00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:21.698\nthat iteration, whilst here we\nare in Agile, we accept change and\n\n183\n00:10:21.698 --> 00:10:26.810\nin fact we welcome change right\nup until the last minute.\n\n184\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.838\nOnce we are in an iteration,\nthat's it we're in an iteration.\n\n185\n00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:33.624\nThe user's stories don't change.\n\n186\n00:10:33.624 --> 00:10:38.830\nOnce we've decided what we're going\nto achieve, that doesn't change.\n\n187\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.795\nIf we want to accommodate change,\n\n188\n00:10:41.795 --> 00:10:45.898\nwe accommodate it at\nthe end of that iteration.\n\n189\n00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:50.257\nWe've got a very definite, well,\nwe call it a time box, for the iteration,\n\n190\n00:10:50.257 --> 00:10:52.621\nthat's between that one and four weeks.\n\n191\n00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:57.268\nAnd last, we like to accommodate change\nin Agile, as I've already said and\n\n192\n00:10:57.268 --> 00:10:59.385\nwe like to be as flexible as we can.\n\n193\n00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:03.921\nFunnily enough,\nonce we're in each iteration,\n\n194\n00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:08.242\nthat iteration is time boxed and\nit is secured.\n\n195\n00:11:08.242 --> 00:11:10.857\nAnd that iteration does not change.\n\n196\n00:11:10.857 --> 00:11:12.640\nThe development team doesn't change.\n\n197\n00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.310\nThe goals don't change.\n\n198\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.470\nThe quality doesn't get reduced or\nit doesn't change.\n\n199\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.500\nSo basically it's locked down.\n\n200\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.900\nNow I don't like to use those sort of\nwords cuz they sound really restrictive.\n\n201\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.687\nAnd when it comes to Agile,\n\n202\n00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:30.503\nit's a flexible way of\napproaching project management.\n\n203\n00:11:30.503 --> 00:11:34.360\nAnd so I really really don't\nlike to be that rigid.\n\n204\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.910\nHowever, nevertheless,\n\n205\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:42.850\nonce we're in that particular time\nbox then we don't change anything.\n\n206\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.210\nThat's when we get rigid.\n\n207\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:50.290\nWe can clarify the scope but\nthat's the scope of the project, and\n\n208\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.800\nat the end of each iteration then we're\ngonna get that feedback that says,\n\n209\n00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.650\nhey look, this is what we achieved and\nthis is what we didn't achieve.\n\n210\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.890\nAnd so,\nthis is when we accommodate change and\n\n211\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.388\nthis is when we reevaluate the back log.\n\n212\n00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:06.781\nOnce we are in the iteration, we're in\nthe iteration and nothing is changed.\n\n213\n00:12:06.781 --> 00:12:08.020\n&gt;&gt; That's not the time to do it.\n\n214\n00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.130\n&gt;&gt; RIght, that's not the time to do it.\n\n215\n00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:14.390\nIf you decide during that\niteration that you cannot achieve\n\n216\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.150\nthat particular user's story for\nwhatever reason,\n\n217\n00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.440\nthen that story is not just ditched,\nit's not just thrown away.\n\n218\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.097\nIt's shelved and then at the end\nof the iteration we discuss it and\n\n219\n00:12:26.097 --> 00:12:28.130\nwe add it back to the backlog.\n\n220\n00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:34.682\nRemember, the backlog is our term for\nthat list of stories that we've go to do.\n\n221\n00:12:34.682 --> 00:12:37.605\nSo the backlog, well,\nthat still stays there.\n\n222\n00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:39.125\nIt still stays there on the board.\n\n223\n00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:42.065\nRemember our Kanban board or\nour information radiator.\n\n224\n00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:45.025\n&gt;&gt; It's like that's something\nthat like never goes away.\n\n225\n00:12:45.025 --> 00:12:47.824\n&gt;&gt; But that's there.\n\n226\n00:12:47.824 --> 00:12:50.075\nYour stories will stay on the board.\n\n227\n00:12:50.075 --> 00:12:51.730\nThat's not a problem.\n\n228\n00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.690\nBut what we're doing is we're basically,\nif you might wanna think about this,\n\n229\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.684\nwe're basically saying right, okay.\n\n230\n00:12:57.684 --> 00:13:00.543\nAt this particular time,\nif you remember the Kanban board,\n\n231\n00:13:00.543 --> 00:13:04.412\nwe had the stories that we've got to do,\nand then the stories we're working on and\n\n232\n00:13:04.412 --> 00:13:06.790\nthe stories that we've completed.\n\n233\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.344\nSo we've now, at the moment we're in\nthe middle if this iteration and so\n\n234\n00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:13.618\nwe're working on the middle bit and\nwe've got those six stories.\n\n235\n00:13:13.618 --> 00:13:15.400\nThose six stories stay there.\n\n236\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.270\nThey stay there until the end of\nthe iteration when we either move them to\n\n237\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.430\ndone, or we move them back to still to do.\n\n238\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.300\nSo the stories stay there,\nthat's what we're working on.\n\n239\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.470\nAnd that doesn't change.\n\n240\n00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.490\nThat middle piece of the board\ndoesn't change until the very end.\n\n241\n00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:38.150\nAnd it's at the very end where we will\nreevaluate what we've actually achieved.\n\n242\n00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.420\nAnd then we look at the,\nwe look at adding it to the backlog again.\n\n243\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.940\nAnd this is what we call\nour backlog refinement.\n\n244\n00:13:46.042 --> 00:13:51.780\nSo on, we refine the user's stories in\npreparation for the next iteration.\n\n245\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.270\nSo we look back up, well,\nwhat did we do and what didn't we do?\n\n246\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:03.660\nReviewing each new user's story well,\nin time for the next iteration.\n\n247\n00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.130\nSo this is this is part of our,\n\n248\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.840\nthis is one of these things is part\nof planning for the next iteration.\n\n249\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.240\nSo it's part of planning, but\n\n250\n00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.680\nit's also part of the review\nof the last iteration as well.\n\n251\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.041\nSo it's that decision at\nthe end of one iteration, okay,\n\n252\n00:14:17.041 --> 00:14:21.774\nwhat didn't we do, what did we do and what\nare we gonna put back into our backlog and\n\n253\n00:14:21.774 --> 00:14:24.263\nwhat does our backlog look like right now?\n\n254\n00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:29.830\nAnd what's in our next iteration and\nthat allows us then to size those stories.\n\n255\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.651\nWell, it says accordingly there, but\n\n256\n00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:35.020\nthat's what allows us to\nthen size the new stories.\n\n257\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.942\nAnd you know what?\n\n258\n00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:40.431\nWe might resize stories as well, because\nwe might have decided at the beginning\n\n259\n00:14:40.431 --> 00:14:45.260\nof our iteration and I'm gonna jump back\nhere while we're still on full screen.\n\n260\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:49.705\nWe might decide actually that, that one\nthere that's got 13 points, you know what?\n\n261\n00:14:49.705 --> 00:14:51.578\nThat should have had about 26 points.\n\n262\n00:14:51.578 --> 00:14:53.076\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because we took a look at it\n\n263\n00:14:53.076 --> 00:14:54.983\nand realize that there's\nno way we're gonna do\n\n264\n00:14:54.983 --> 00:14:55.683\nthat,-\n&gt;&gt; More involved.\n\n265\n00:14:55.683 --> 00:14:57.520\n&gt;&gt; And everything else.\n\n266\n00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.180\nSo that's when at that point in\ntime at the end of that iteration,\n\n267\n00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.620\nwe realize that we couldn't achieve that\nso we're gonna resize that story and\n\n268\n00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.440\nit goes back into the backlog.\n\n269\n00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.250\nAnd it may well get added to\nan iteration all on its own.\n\n270\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.910\nThen that's all right,\nthat's exactly what we do.\n\n271\n00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:21.010\nBut only those stories that\nare ready are the ones that\n\n272\n00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.500\nwe would discuss in our planning session.\n\n273\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.060\nWhat we mean by that is that\nwhen we're planning for\n\n274\n00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.421\na new iteration,\nsometimes we have to refine stories.\n\n275\n00:15:33.421 --> 00:15:36.867\nIf you remember in our\nprevious episode and\n\n276\n00:15:36.867 --> 00:15:42.440\nwe discussed the fact that we didn't\nhave our user persona defined.\n\n277\n00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.900\nWhich meant that because we\ndidn't have that defined,\n\n278\n00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.790\nwe actually really couldn't\nprogress with that user's story.\n\n279\n00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:48.490\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n280\n00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.681\n&gt;&gt; Which means that actually\nthat user's story wasn't ready.\n\n281\n00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:52.714\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n282\n00:15:52.714 --> 00:15:53.596\n&gt;&gt; We thought it was.\n\n283\n00:15:53.596 --> 00:15:55.156\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But it wasn't.\n\n284\n00:15:55.156 --> 00:15:57.089\nSo we shelved it.\n\n285\n00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:59.914\nAnd then what we'll do is\nwe'll refine that story.\n\n286\n00:15:59.914 --> 00:16:05.260\nSo in time for the next review and\nthe next planning, the backlog refinement,\n\n287\n00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:10.444\nonce that particular iteration has ended,\nwe'll make sure that that story\n\n288\n00:16:10.444 --> 00:16:15.720\nhas been refined to the point where it's\nready to go into the next iteration.\n\n289\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.890\nSo only the stories that are ready\nshould go into an iteration,\n\n290\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.350\nif it's not ready then it can't be\ndeveloped, it's just as simple as that.\n\n291\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.020\n&gt;&gt; I know we've talked about it before\njust ready could also mean maybe\n\n292\n00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.255\nit's a dependency of some\ndifferent story and so,\n\n293\n00:16:31.255 --> 00:16:35.045\nthat's another common reason\nwhy it wouldn't be ready.\n\n294\n00:16:35.045 --> 00:16:38.748\n&gt;&gt; Right, and a lot of these, especially\nwhen we look at mobile apps which is\n\n295\n00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.818\nthe one that we're discussing right now,\nthis mobile app.\n\n296\n00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:44.376\nThere can be a dependency on a version,\n\n297\n00:16:44.376 --> 00:16:48.495\non a particular version of\nthe operating system for instance.\n\n298\n00:16:48.495 --> 00:16:52.628\nNow we'll always tell you,\nwe're in a development environment and so,\n\n299\n00:16:52.628 --> 00:16:56.042\nwe'll always say that we should\nbe planning for the future.\n\n300\n00:16:56.042 --> 00:17:00.440\nAnd any software development\norganization that plans to develop for\n\n301\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.762\nthis present version of the operating\nsystem especially the mobile\n\n302\n00:17:04.762 --> 00:17:08.421\noperating system is probably\ngonna be behind the times.\n\n303\n00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:12.350\nCuz by the time it gets released,\nthe operating system is been updated.\n\n304\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.138\nSo we have to work with\nsoftware manufacturers,\n\n305\n00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:19.762\nwe have to work with how do I manufacture\nthis to ensure that what we're releasing\n\n306\n00:17:19.762 --> 00:17:21.536\nis kept up-to-date as well.\n\n307\n00:17:21.536 --> 00:17:27.896\nYeah, that is current, it's kept\nup-to-date and we're ahead of the curve,\n\n308\n00:17:27.896 --> 00:17:32.383\nI know that in a lot of organizations or\nwith a lot of apps,\n\n309\n00:17:32.383 --> 00:17:37.362\nwe've had instances in the past\nwhere apps have been created.\n\n310\n00:17:37.362 --> 00:17:41.583\nAnd they worked for a week or two and then\nthe operating system was upgraded, and\n\n311\n00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:45.270\nthen they don't work anymore and\nso, you need to do updates to that.\n\n312\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.116\n&gt;&gt; Especially with the Androids,\nbeing that opensource coding.\n\n313\n00:17:49.116 --> 00:17:54.160\nIt's like yeah, all those sweets,\nKitKat, Vanilla.\n\n314\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.585\nYeah, who knows,\nlollipop all those yummy things.\n\n315\n00:17:56.585 --> 00:17:57.619\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n316\n00:17:57.619 --> 00:18:03.280\nthere are a lot of releases of those OS's\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah a lot of releases and it's\n\n317\n00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.880\nreally difficult to catch up to keep up\nwith them as a software, sort of if you're\n\n318\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.410\na software house or you're developing\nsoftware, you're developing apps.\n\n319\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.320\nEspecially in-house apps\nwithin your organization,\n\n320\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.910\nyou've gotta get access to that source\ncode long before anybody else does.\n\n321\n00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.610\n&gt;&gt; And I mean with something like that,\n\n322\n00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:25.000\nwith the amount of releases that you see\nwith those opensource operating systems,\n\n323\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.530\nI almost have to decide hey look,\nam I gonna support all of these platforms?\n\n324\n00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.150\nAm I gonna pick and choose the most\npopular one, something like that?\n\n325\n00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.310\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of organizations do that,\nthey'll choose the most popular one.\n\n326\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:42.010\nAnd certainly when I look at the most\nhighly functioning organization,\n\n327\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.620\nwhen you talk about the smooth\nto medium enterprises.\n\n328\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.360\nIf I look at highly functioning\norganizations, then they tend to,\n\n329\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.470\nwhat they will do is,\nthey will say, well yes,\n\n330\n00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:55.460\nwe're going to create apps just for\nthese particular platforms.\n\n331\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.380\nBut then what they will do is\nthey'll ensure that the staff\n\n332\n00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.980\nonly have those particular\nplatforms available.\n\n333\n00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.218\nSo they'll provide their cell phones and\nthey'll provide their tablets and\n\n334\n00:19:04.218 --> 00:19:05.420\ntheir laptops, etc.\n\n335\n00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.295\nSo what they're only having to\nrelease software just for that.\n\n336\n00:19:09.295 --> 00:19:12.388\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a heck of a lot easier\nto manage a more uniform system or\n\n337\n00:19:12.388 --> 00:19:14.612\nenvironment, believe me I know,\nthan saying,\n\n338\n00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.160\nhey, we'll support\neverything under the sun.\n\n339\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.020\nBut the truth of the matter is a lot\nof companies these days are saying,\n\n340\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:26.750\nyou know it is funny, they even changed\nthe acronym, it used to be BYOD, not BYOB.\n\n341\n00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.640\n&gt;&gt; But now, it's CYOD and\na lot of companies and\n\n342\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.900\ninstead of bring of your own device,\nit's choose your own device.\n\n343\n00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.750\nIf there's anything allowing you\nto take those devices you make for\n\n344\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.980\ncomfortable with at home and\nthen provision them for enterprise use.\n\n345\n00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.082\nSo being able to support all\nthat can be quite a challenge.\n\n346\n00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's not just a challenge\nfor sort of large manufacturers or for\n\n347\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.960\nlarge software houses, it's a challenge\nfor smaller organizations as well.\n\n348\n00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.510\nWe have the ability now to create apps.\n\n349\n00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.433\nWe all have the ability, and\nyou talk about opensource software.\n\n350\n00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:05.715\nWe've all got that ability to\ncreate apps and to create software,\n\n351\n00:20:05.715 --> 00:20:09.842\nwhich means, wow,\nthere's a lot more diverse range, apps and\n\n352\n00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:12.097\nthings around that-\n&gt;&gt; Or variable, yeah.\n\n353\n00:20:12.097 --> 00:20:15.399\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\ndevelopment itself is really tricky and\n\n354\n00:20:15.399 --> 00:20:18.987\nyou'd like to think that as we\nmove forward in technology,\n\n355\n00:20:18.987 --> 00:20:23.670\nthe development would get easier and\nit does in certain respects.\n\n356\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.395\nIt does get a lot easier, I mean when\nI first started off, coding years and\n\n357\n00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.717\nyears and years ago.\n\n358\n00:20:29.717 --> 00:20:34.365\nWe had in one or two languages and they\nwere really difficult languages to learn.\n\n359\n00:20:34.365 --> 00:20:38.925\nThen you spent a lot of time sort of,\nroot source and\n\n360\n00:20:38.925 --> 00:20:42.325\ncoding data sets and, my goodness,\nI remembered that a long,\n\n361\n00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:48.400\nlong time ago when I was writing in\nJCL but that was a long time ago.\n\n362\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.960\nNow it's a lot easier,\nwe've got nice graphical interfaces, etc.\n\n363\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.980\nBut it means that we've got\na more diverse range of\n\n364\n00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.850\nproducts that are available to us.\n\n365\n00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.826\nAnd a more diverse range\nof operating systems and\n\n366\n00:21:01.826 --> 00:21:04.447\nwe've actually got to learn so much more.\n\n367\n00:21:04.447 --> 00:21:07.790\n&gt;&gt; Now even languages, I saw this joke\ncaught in the internet the other day.\n\n368\n00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.852\nIt was, well wasn't the other day,\nit was probably awhile ago.\n\n369\n00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:15.269\nBut it was a job posting that\nsomeone had screenshot and\n\n370\n00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:21.233\nthe language that they were requesting\nhad X amount of years experience.\n\n371\n00:21:21.233 --> 00:21:26.164\nI don't remember but for that particular\nlanguage, it hasn't even been alive or\n\n372\n00:21:26.164 --> 00:21:28.890\nhadn't been developed for that many years.\n\n373\n00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:33.210\nSo what the human resource or\nwhat the job posting was asking for\n\n374\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.890\ncouldn't even exist, so\nit's kind of interesting.\n\n375\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I still nowadays because I've\ngot things that I may not taken things off\n\n376\n00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:46.200\nmy resume from a long time ago because\nthe skills that I had many years ago.\n\n377\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.390\nI now get people sort of head taunting and\nsay, could you come and\n\n378\n00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.240\nhelp out with this because we can't find\nanybody with these skills and it's like,\n\n379\n00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.510\nwell yeah, maybe I could have done 20\nyears ago but I can't do that now, right?\n\n380\n00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.130\nIt's gonna take me a little bit of\ntime to brush up on those skills,\n\n381\n00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.730\nbut thanks for thinking of me.\n\n382\n00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:09.180\nSo at the end of the iteration, then what\nwe're going to do is we're going to, well,\n\n383\n00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.170\nperform a review.\n\n384\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.430\nAnd I don't know whether you\nremember we talked, we've\n\n385\n00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:20.640\nhad a few stand up meetings recently,\nwhere we've talked about ceremonies.\n\n386\n00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and our iteration review,\n\n387\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.070\nat the end of our iteration, well,\n\n388\n00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.810\nwe'll have ceremonies before we release\njust to say hey look, this is done.\n\n389\n00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.170\nThis is our definition of done,\nisn't it great?\n\n390\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.520\nYeah, and our ceremony is really just\na sort of congratulate to reset of well\n\n391\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.230\ndone, yes we've achieved this,\nso it's a sense of achievement.\n\n392\n00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.270\nAnd this is what this is,\nit's an opportunity for\n\n393\n00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.780\nthe team to demonstrate\nwhat they've achieved.\n\n394\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.960\nAnd so\nwe will include stakeholders in this.\n\n395\n00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.253\n&gt;&gt; And I think this is also good place to\nbe able to, Jo you keep saying, hey look,\n\n396\n00:22:53.253 --> 00:22:57.809\nat the beginning of the project, I'm going\nto have a bit of a learning curve there,\n\n397\n00:22:57.809 --> 00:22:58.873\nbut as I progress.\n\n398\n00:22:58.873 --> 00:23:03.618\nSo during these ceremonies, over time we\ncan see, okay, which teams work together,\n\n399\n00:23:03.618 --> 00:23:07.920\nwhich ones are going to be more efficient,\nor how long certain tasks may take.\n\n400\n00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.473\nSay okay, this individual's really\ngreat at X or this one's great at Y.\n\n401\n00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:15.809\nAnd during these ceremonies, this is\nwhere they can go over how many hours or\n\n402\n00:23:15.809 --> 00:23:19.010\nhow many story points,\nwhatever metric that they use.\n\n403\n00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:23.820\nBut then, they can kind of get a measure\nof their velocity, really, I guess.\n\n404\n00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.557\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI mean look at that last bullet point,\n\n405\n00:23:25.557 --> 00:23:28.462\nit says about assessing the iteration for\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n\n406\n00:23:28.462 --> 00:23:30.490\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're doing and\n\n407\n00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.244\nwhat you expect to see over a period\nof time with the project type,\n\n408\n00:23:34.244 --> 00:23:38.019\nexpect to see both the efficiency and\neffectiveness improving.\n\n409\n00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:43.387\nI don't actually expect that, I don't\nexpect the efficiency to remain stagnant,\n\n410\n00:23:43.387 --> 00:23:47.632\nand I don't expect the effectiveness\nto remain stagnant either.\n\n411\n00:23:47.632 --> 00:23:52.138\nI expect it at the beginning of\na project in that first iteration, and\n\n412\n00:23:52.138 --> 00:23:55.260\nthen it doesn't matter\nhow much we plan for it.\n\n413\n00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.733\nThere are gonna be things that we might\nnot deliver to as higher quality as we\n\n414\n00:23:59.733 --> 00:24:01.588\nwould like to have delivered.\n\n415\n00:24:01.588 --> 00:24:04.011\nOr maybe there are things that\nwe didn't quite get right.\n\n416\n00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:08.846\nAnd at the beginning of a project,\nwe shouldn't, and I've said this before,\n\n417\n00:24:08.846 --> 00:24:13.539\nand I'll say this again, when you're\nplanning your first few iterations,\n\n418\n00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:16.810\nyou should not be trying\nto overload that iteration.\n\n419\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.710\nYou should be completely honest with the\namount of ideal days that you can achieve.\n\n420\n00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.730\nBut also, you should weigh heavily\non the side of contingency,\n\n421\n00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:31.420\nbecause the unknowns are a lot\ngreater at the beginning of a project.\n\n422\n00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.180\nAnd remember, we looked at that sort of\nkind of uncertainty in one of our previous\n\n423\n00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.310\nepisodes, where we said\nestimation is always really,\n\n424\n00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.480\nreally vague at\nthe beginning of a project.\n\n425\n00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.440\nAnd as we move further down\nthe timeline of the actual project,\n\n426\n00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.870\nas we progress further into the project,\nthen our estimations become more and\n\n427\n00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.930\nmore accurate, and\nthat's what I'd expect to see.\n\n428\n00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:57.800\nSo we use this particular tool,\nthis particular review as a vehicle\n\n429\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.762\nto help us with planning for\nour next iteration.\n\n430\n00:25:02.762 --> 00:25:09.910\nAnd please, and I'm begging at this\npoint in time, but I am gonna beg.\n\n431\n00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:15.005\nThe iteration review, I hate it,\nI absolutely hate it when I see\n\n432\n00:25:15.005 --> 00:25:20.730\nthese reviews being used as a vehicle\nto apportion blame or to point fingers.\n\n433\n00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:27.350\nThis is not about blaming somebody or\nsomething when something goes wrong.\n\n434\n00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.960\nThis is about understanding that\nif something has gone wrong,\n\n435\n00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.930\nthen it's probably down to\neither inadequate planning or\n\n436\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.760\nthe fact that we didn't add\nsomething into the contingency.\n\n437\n00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.620\nAnd therefore, we've gotta plan for\nit better next time.\n\n438\n00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.116\nThis is not about apportioning blame,\nthis is not about pointing fingers, and\n\n439\n00:25:47.116 --> 00:25:48.604\nI want to emphasize that.\n\n440\n00:25:48.604 --> 00:25:51.460\nThis is not what the review is about.\n\n441\n00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:56.120\nAnd the amount of people that will say\nto me, when I'm talking about this and\n\n442\n00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.279\nI'm doing sorta project\nmanagement consulting, and\n\n443\n00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:02.330\nthey'll say,\nI wish you could tell our team that.\n\n444\n00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:07.230\nAnd yes, I am telling you,\nI'm telling all of you that, all right,\n\n445\n00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:12.550\nthe review should not be used as a vehicle\nto point fingers, definitely not.\n\n446\n00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.840\nSo at the end of this review,\nor as part of this review,\n\n447\n00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.520\nwe should be defining\nthat definition of done.\n\n448\n00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.820\nAnd we should be approving\nthe definition of done, and\n\n449\n00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.670\nit's approved by the product owner.\n\n450\n00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.500\nWe've got the accountability there,\nbut the team,\n\n451\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.990\nbecause they're working collaboratively,\nthen the team should be defining or\n\n452\n00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:37.520\nshould be accepting done together,\nas a team.\n\n453\n00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.410\nAnd don't forget,\nwe talk about evolution here.\n\n454\n00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:45.220\nThe definition of done is an evolutionary\nprocess as well, because we\n\n455\n00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.820\nmight not necessarily be specific enough\nright at the very beginning of a project.\n\n456\n00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:54.042\nAnd as we move throughout the project,\nwith each iteration,\n\n457\n00:26:54.042 --> 00:26:58.080\nour definition of done might get more and\nmore specific.\n\n458\n00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.080\nOr we might find that\nthe converse happens, and\n\n459\n00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.280\nat the beginning of a project, we're\ntoo specific, we're expecting too much.\n\n460\n00:27:07.364 --> 00:27:12.410\nAnd so as the project progresses,\n\n461\n00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:17.250\nthen at that point in time, we become\nless specific because we realize that,\n\n462\n00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.780\nactually, we're trying\nto achieve too much.\n\n463\n00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.275\nAnd that definition of\ndone is going to exist for\n\n464\n00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:28.275\nindividual tasks, individual pieces\nof coding, for the user stories, for\n\n465\n00:27:28.275 --> 00:27:31.505\nthe sprints or iterations,\nand for a release as well.\n\n466\n00:27:31.505 --> 00:27:37.615\nYou have to ensure that your release is\nready before you actually release it.\n\n467\n00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.070\nAnd so lastly, for\nthis particular episode,\n\n468\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.640\nwe're just gonna look at\nthe retrospective here, and\n\n469\n00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.640\nthe team retrospective, well, this is\nat the end of every single iteration.\n\n470\n00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.854\nWe simply look back, and\nwe consider what's working well,\n\n471\n00:27:55.854 --> 00:28:00.159\nwhat's not working so\nwell, what we can change.\n\n472\n00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:06.731\nBut the retrospective\nis not product-based.\n\n473\n00:28:06.731 --> 00:28:08.300\n&gt;&gt; Team based.\n&gt;&gt; This is the bit that I like.\n\n474\n00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:08.936\n&gt;&gt; Hold on.\n\n475\n00:28:08.936 --> 00:28:09.513\n&gt;&gt; Look at this.\n\n476\n00:28:09.513 --> 00:28:10.890\n&gt;&gt; Does not attend.\n\n477\n00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.690\n&gt;&gt; Because yeah, we're talking about the\nproduct owner here, and the product owner\n\n478\n00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:21.620\ndoesn't attend the retrospective,\nyou know why?\n\n479\n00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.280\n&gt;&gt; Because the scrum master's\nresponsible for the team, and\n\n480\n00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.770\nit's a team retrospective.\n\n481\n00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.670\n&gt;&gt; Let's face it.\n\n482\n00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.931\n&gt;&gt; The product owner's\nworking on something else.\n\n483\n00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:33.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No it's got nothing to do with that.\n\n484\n00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.900\n&gt;&gt; I'm being honest here.\n\n485\n00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.295\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we've gotta be open and honest.\n\n486\n00:28:37.295 --> 00:28:41.040\nAnd the product owner's responsible for\nthe product.\n\n487\n00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.978\nSo if I was product owner and you were\nscrum master, if I was product owner,\n\n488\n00:28:45.978 --> 00:28:51.260\nI'm gonna be eager to get functionality.\n\n489\n00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:55.230\nI'm gonna be eager to\nachieve functionality, yes?\n\n490\n00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.530\n&gt;&gt; So sometimes you might\nbe pushing me too hard?\n\n491\n00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.333\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I might be\npushing you too hard.\n\n492\n00:28:58.333 --> 00:28:59.912\n&gt;&gt; So now this is my safe zone, so\n\n493\n00:28:59.912 --> 00:29:02.658\nI can tell the scrum master\nthat Jo is too hard on me?\n\n494\n00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:05.739\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, but\nwhat about the instances where the product\n\n495\n00:29:05.739 --> 00:29:09.062\nowner has got one priority at\nthe beginning of the iteration, and\n\n496\n00:29:09.062 --> 00:29:13.200\nthen decides to try and change the\npriority in the middle of the iteration?\n\n497\n00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.724\nAnd even though we say,\nno, that shouldn't happen,\n\n498\n00:29:16.724 --> 00:29:19.490\n[LAUGH] you've never met me,\n[LAUGH] but no.\n\n499\n00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:23.310\n&gt;&gt; It happens a lot, even not just with\nagile methodology, but across the board,\n\n500\n00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.790\nlooking at different project management.\n\n501\n00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:30.290\n&gt;&gt; We looked at, in a previous episode,\ndidn't we, about prioritization, and\n\n502\n00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:34.200\nhe who shouts loudest gets the highest\npriority, and sometimes that can happen.\n\n503\n00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.380\nSomebody will come in\nfrom the organization.\n\n504\n00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.040\nBut I want this now.\n\n505\n00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.870\nAll right, and that's when\nthe product owner starts panicking.\n\n506\n00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.110\n&gt;&gt; Veruca Salt from Willy Wonka,\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\n507\n00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:49.569\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, yes, that's not me,\nby the way, [LAUGH] but\n\n508\n00:29:49.569 --> 00:29:53.221\nDaddy, I want a gold nugget,\nand I want it now.\n\n509\n00:29:53.221 --> 00:29:53.907\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n510\n00:29:53.907 --> 00:29:56.658\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's not gonna happen, but\n\n511\n00:29:56.658 --> 00:29:57.542\nI do have the accent.\n\n512\n00:29:57.542 --> 00:29:59.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n513\n00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.333\n&gt;&gt; I can act spoiled when I want to.\n\n514\n00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:06.311\n[LAUGH] But yeah, the product owner\ndoesn't actually attend this,\n\n515\n00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:10.677\nbecause this is the team's\nopportunity to highlight any,\n\n516\n00:30:10.677 --> 00:30:13.690\nI don't wanna say personal issues.\n\n517\n00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:17.720\nBut that's really what it is, to highlight\nany issues that the product owner may not\n\n518\n00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.800\nbe able to see from\nan impartial perspective.\n\n519\n00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n520\n00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.470\n&gt;&gt; The product owner may not be\nobjective about certain things.\n\n521\n00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:31.220\nAnd so\nthis is the team's opportunity to discuss\n\n522\n00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:38.530\nwhat didn't quite work, and maybe\nsomething the product owner can do better.\n\n523\n00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.870\nSo this is the last thing that\nwe do in every iteration.\n\n524\n00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:45.510\nAnd it literally is just the team\nthemselves with the scrum master,\n\n525\n00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:51.350\nwhere we sit down, and we just discuss,\nwell, what could be done better next time.\n\n526\n00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:55.630\nAnd actually, what worked really well, and\nwhat we can apply to our next iteration.\n\n527\n00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:01.220\nSo that's part of all of our planning,\nand all of our planning is now complete.\n\n528\n00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:06.330\nAnd so now we've done the iteration, and\nactually, the iteration is now complete.\n\n529\n00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.838\nSo what we're gonna look at in our\nnext episode, because that's it,\n\n530\n00:31:09.838 --> 00:31:11.330\nwe've finished [INAUDIBLE].\n\n531\n00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:12.603\n&gt;&gt; Our leveling now, all right.\n\n532\n00:31:12.603 --> 00:31:14.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nnow we're gonna look at our metrics, and\n\n533\n00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.970\nwe're gonna look at what we measure.\n\n534\n00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:20.420\nNow, I also want to just remind you that,\nof course,\n\n535\n00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.920\nwe do like documentation in ITIL,\nin agile even.\n\n536\n00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.907\nWe do like documentation in agile, but\n\n537\n00:31:26.907 --> 00:31:29.750\nwe don't want comprehensive documentation,\nright?\n\n538\n00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:33.942\nWe're not using documentation or\nreporting as a weapon, [LAUGH] right?\n\n539\n00:31:33.942 --> 00:31:37.860\nWe are using it just as a tool\nto facilitate our progress.\n\n540\n00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.130\nSo with that in mind, in our next episode,\n\n541\n00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.550\nwe're gonna talk a little bit\nmore about what we measure.\n\n542\n00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Jo,\nthank you so much for being with us.\n\n543\n00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.560\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\nbut we need to go ahead and sign out.\n\n544\n00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.110\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n545\n00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n546\n00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.751\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n547\n00:31:54.751 --> 00:32:00.178\n[MUSIC]\n\n548\n00:32:00.178 --> 00:32:03.713\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:04.964\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:09.341\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n5\n00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:13.910\nwatching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to your agile product\n\n6\n00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.020\nowner series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.080\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.970\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be taking a look at metrics.\n\n9\n00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.040\nAnd with us today in the studio\nis we have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.766\nHow's it going, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.880\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n12\n00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.460\nI'm kind of curious, metrics?\n\n13\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.620\nNow, I know that metrics are used for,\nwell, a lot of different things.\n\n14\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.451\nA lot of times for\nadhering to service level agreements, and\n\n15\n00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:38.230\nmaking sure we're performing, like our,\n\n16\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.184\nif I can even think of this.\n&gt;&gt; That\n\n17\n00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:40.880\nwould be KPIs.\n\n18\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.863\n&gt;&gt; KPIs.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n19\n00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:45.721\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, I always transpose it into PKI for\n\n20\n00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:50.099\npublic key infrastructure,\nand those two, sorry.\n\n21\n00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.668\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n22\n00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:51.209\n&gt;&gt; Not that.\n\n23\n00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:52.909\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what to say to that.\n\n24\n00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:53.628\n&gt;&gt; KPIs.\n\n25\n00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:54.877\n&gt;&gt; But KPIs, key performance\n\n26\n00:00:54.877 --> 00:00:55.685\nindicators.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n27\n00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:56.280\nare we gonna be looking at that?\n\n28\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.360\n&gt;&gt; Not really, no.\n\n29\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.140\n&gt;&gt; No?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n30\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so metrics then.\n\n31\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Somewhere in an agile environment, and\n\n32\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.716\nin an agile environment that\nwe like to keep things agile.\n\n33\n00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:12.480\nJust remember, now, we were talking\njust a little while ago about our\n\n34\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.290\nfour principles, weren't we, of agile?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.990\n&gt;&gt; And we don't\n\n36\n00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.880\nparticularly like\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n37\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.120\nBut we definitely don't want\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n38\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.035\nWe also have a, not so much a rule,\na principal that we follow when it\n\n39\n00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:33.322\ncomes to documentation, and\nwhen it comes to reporting, especially.\n\n40\n00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:35.772\nAnd that is, if you can't make\na decision from the report,\n\n41\n00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:38.420\nthen you have to ask yourself why\nare you producing that report?\n\n42\n00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.120\nI mention that because in IT,\nall the world over, and\n\n43\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.660\nit's not just in project management,\n\n44\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.100\nit's also in service management as well,\nand other aspects of IT.\n\n45\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.850\nIn IT in general, we find that we\nproduce a lot of pretty pictures.\n\n46\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.690\nA lot of pretty pictures just for\nthe sake of having pretty pictures.\n\n47\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.334\nAnd I always ask clients all the time,\nI'll go in there and I'll say,\n\n48\n00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:05.348\nwhy are you producing these 500 reports?\n\n49\n00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:09.690\nWho is reading these 500 reports, and what\nare they doing about these 500 reports?\n\n50\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.025\nBecause if they're not taking any action,\nif you can't make\n\n51\n00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:16.910\na decision from that report,\nthen why on Earth are you producing it?\n\n52\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.740\nIt's just a metric just for\nthe sake of having metrics.\n\n53\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.210\nAnd as much as we like to try and\nprove things,\n\n54\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.340\nmaybe to ourselves,\nyou still gotta ask the question why.\n\n55\n00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.030\nIs it valuable?\n\n56\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.550\nIt's not efficient, and\nthis is agile, isn't it?\n\n57\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.470\nAgile is a look at efficiency.\n\n58\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.740\nIt is not efficient to produce\na report just for the sake of it,\n\n59\n00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.858\nyou're wasting time and effort.\n\n60\n00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:43.400\nSo here in agile then, we're not really\nconcerned with producing reports just for\n\n61\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.898\nthe sake of producing reports.\n\n62\n00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:49.320\nAnd some of the documentation that you\nmight find in a traditional waterfall\n\n63\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.920\ntype project,\nyou're not going to find here in agile.\n\n64\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.290\nNo, that's not to say we don't have\nany documentation because we do.\n\n65\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.215\nBut really, the sort of reports that we\nwant to produce are reports that well,\n\n66\n00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:06.740\nthat allow us to ascertain just how\nfar we've gone with our project,\n\n67\n00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.430\nhow far we've gone with our progress.\n\n68\n00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.480\nSo I'm taking it that you\nunderstand what a Gantt chart\n\n69\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.248\nis.\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n70\n00:03:13.248 --> 00:03:13.947\n&gt;&gt; You do?\n\n71\n00:03:13.947 --> 00:03:18.384\nRight, and you understand what a Gantt\nchart is if you're watching a agile\n\n72\n00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:23.247\nproject management series, then you have\nclearly got some understanding of what\n\n73\n00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:25.095\nproject management is about.\n\n74\n00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:30.104\nAnd so that Gantt chart is at a glance\nview of eactly what we've got planned,\n\n75\n00:03:30.104 --> 00:03:33.314\nand exactly how far we've got to go.\n&gt;&gt; Where we are.\n\n76\n00:03:33.314 --> 00:03:35.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's where we are right now.\n\n77\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.955\nSo do you think the Gantt chart is\nappropriate for an agile environment?\n\n78\n00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:41.865\n&gt;&gt; No, uh-uh, yeah, no.\n\n79\n00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:45.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n80\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna try to defend my answer,\n\n81\n00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.706\nI don't know if it's the correct answer,\nbut-\n\n82\n00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:49.370\n&gt;&gt; Go on then.\n\n83\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.815\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so maybe because we are swiftly\n\n84\n00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:57.228\nmoving and\na Gantt chart is really planned out for\n\n85\n00:03:57.228 --> 00:04:03.200\nlonger periods of time, and I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; There's no right or wrong.\n\n86\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.464\nSo I can, or\nit was kind of a trick question, and\n\n87\n00:04:05.464 --> 00:04:08.251\nI'm being really mean to\nCherokee right now, aren't I?\n\n88\n00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:09.625\nIt's a trick question.\n\n89\n00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:13.695\nBut let's think about the reason\nwhy you're producing the Gantt\n\n90\n00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:14.470\nchart.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n91\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.560\n&gt;&gt; Like you said,\n\n92\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.040\nthe Gantt chart is sort of traditionally\nused for a set period of time, isn't it?\n\n93\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.830\nFor a long period of time,\nfor a waterfall approach.\n\n94\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.290\nAnd it's used to ascertain\nhow far we've got,\n\n95\n00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.141\nwhere we are right now in our projects.\n&gt;&gt; And it's an at a glance,\n\n96\n00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:36.640\na high level view, that can be drilled\ninto, to see exactly where we are.\n\n97\n00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.430\nBut generally, we look at it with an at\na glance view to see how far we've come.\n\n98\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.280\nIs it really appropriate for\nan agile environment?\n\n99\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.490\nOr is it considered to be just\n\n100\n00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.689\nexcess documentation?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha, so if we're using it\n\n101\n00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.718\nproductively, then it's acceptable.\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and that's what I mean.\n\n102\n00:04:57.718 --> 00:05:01.490\nI wasn't deliberately tripping you up, but\nit's a question that I get asked a lot.\n\n103\n00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.760\nIs it appropriate?\n\n104\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.860\nAnd the answer is it\ndepends on how you use it.\n\n105\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.960\nIf you use it in a way that\nyou're keeping it simple,\n\n106\n00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.900\nthat's one of the things that\nwe like to do within agile.\n\n107\n00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.660\nIf you keep it simple, and\nit is just in that an at a glance view,\n\n108\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.040\nit is a useful planning tool.\n\n109\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.050\nBut you've really, really got to\nbe careful with a Gantt chart,\n\n110\n00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.750\nbecause with a Gantt chart\nthere's this tendency,\n\n111\n00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.950\nthere's this desire to get\ndeeper into the project.\n\n112\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.380\nAnd don't forget,\nwe're only planning in detail.\n\n113\n00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.150\nWe're only planning that deep in one,\n\n114\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.300\ntwo, three, four-week chunks,\nnothing more than that.\n\n115\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.660\nAnd so you're just planning that\nlittle time box as we like to call it.\n\n116\n00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.274\nSo should you produce a Gantt chart?\n&gt;&gt; And I'm thinking about it more, and\n\n117\n00:05:44.274 --> 00:05:48.156\nI'm thinking maybe it can actually help\nyou be more effective if you're utilizing\n\n118\n00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:52.036\nmaybe a software like Microsoft Project or\nsomething, and it's keeping track and\n\n119\n00:05:52.036 --> 00:05:56.110\nkeeping records of things without actually\ncreating individual documents for that.\n\n120\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.498\nYou create your Gantt chart and\nuse that and\n\n121\n00:05:58.498 --> 00:06:02.540\njust add your notes in as you go so\nit's actually a little more an all in one\n\n122\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.283\nplace?\n&gt;&gt; It can be, but MS project could\n\n123\n00:06:05.283 --> 00:06:08.988\nbe perceived as being fairly cumbersome.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n124\n00:06:08.988 --> 00:06:10.760\n&gt;&gt; It is, it can be fairly cumbersome.\n\n125\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.300\nThere are lots of tools that\ncan help you on the web.\n\n126\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.200\nThere are lots of sort of cloud-based\ntools now that can help you,\n\n127\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.950\nthat are a little bit more simple to use,\nand\n\n128\n00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.790\nthat are more of sort of a high level,\nfrom a high level perspective.\n\n129\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.655\nAnd there are tools out there that will\nhelp with an agile sort of project as well\n\n130\n00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:32.307\nthat are specifically geared for\nthe agile project.\n\n131\n00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:33.387\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n132\n00:06:33.387 --> 00:06:35.135\n&gt;&gt; So we're not gonna say yes or no,\n\n133\n00:06:35.135 --> 00:06:37.882\nthat you should be using a Gantt chart or\nMS Project,\n\n134\n00:06:37.882 --> 00:06:40.470\nwhich produces the Gantt charts, or not.\n\n135\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.814\nIt's entirely up to you.\n\n136\n00:06:41.814 --> 00:06:45.018\nBut you've just gotta be really, really\ncareful that you're not getting ahead\n\n137\n00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:47.140\nof yourself with all\nof that documentation.\n\n138\n00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.840\nIt is so easy to fall into the trap\nof producing too much documentation.\n\n139\n00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.450\nWe're in IT,\n\n140\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:57.050\nand it seems to me that sometimes we\nadopt this culture of more is better.\n\n141\n00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.890\nAnd that's not the case.\n\n142\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.184\nIt really isn't.\n\n143\n00:07:00.184 --> 00:07:04.060\nIn fact, less is better certainly,\nfrom an agile perspective.\n\n144\n00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.310\nWe've just got to make sure we've\ngot all of the information.\n\n145\n00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.780\nSo with that said then,\nwhat kind of reports are we producing?\n\n146\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.280\nWell, in an agile environment,\nwhat we should be measuring.\n\n147\n00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.260\nAnd these are just ideas by the way,\nthese are not cast in stone,\n\n148\n00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.030\nit is entirely up to you.\n\n149\n00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.569\nBut what we should be measuring\nis our burndown, okay?\n\n150\n00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.823\nAnd our burndown and\nour burn up chart, well,\n\n151\n00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:33.380\nour burndown is how much have we\nachieved in that particular iteration.\n\n152\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.910\nAnd then our burn up chart is well,\nit's just the complete opposite.\n\n153\n00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.890\nOur burn up chart is really how much\nhave the project have we achieved.\n\n154\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.110\nSo no, let me rephrase this.\n\n155\n00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.642\nOur burndown chart is how\nmuch we've got left and\n\n156\n00:07:47.642 --> 00:07:50.441\nour burn up chart is how\nmuch we've achieved, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:55.511\nSo our burn up chart should increase\nover time, whereas, our burndown chart\n\n158\n00:07:55.511 --> 00:08:00.360\nshould come down over time because\nthat's how much that we've got left.\n\n159\n00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.850\nWe should also be able to ascertain at\na glance the value that's been delivered.\n\n160\n00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.860\nIt mentions there in terms of financial or\nstory points.\n\n161\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:17.340\nNow in your burn down charts, you will\nsee how many stories could be delivered.\n\n162\n00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.930\nAnd you'll see that in our burn up charts\nwe'll see how many have been delivered.\n\n163\n00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.440\nIn our burn down charts, we'll see\nhow many we've got left to deliver.\n\n164\n00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.602\nBut at no point in time during\nthose burn up and burn down charts,\n\n165\n00:08:31.602 --> 00:08:35.930\nare we actually measuring the business\nof value that's been delivered.\n\n166\n00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.610\nAnd value's an interesting one\nbecause it mentions they're financial.\n\n167\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.990\nThe story points appear in our burn up and\nburn down charts,\n\n168\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.740\nthat's how many stories we've got left.\n\n169\n00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.500\nAnd also what story points we've got left,\nas well.\n\n170\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.079\nBecause, remember, from previous episodes,\nsome stories have more than one point.\n\n171\n00:08:53.079 --> 00:08:55.370\nIn fact,\nmost of them have more than one point.\n\n172\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.610\nBut we've also got to find a way to\nmeasure the value that's been delivered.\n\n173\n00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.160\nNow it mentions financial there.\n\n174\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.230\nFinancial being that return on investment,\n\n175\n00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.570\nand that's a return on investment that\nwe will find in our business case.\n\n176\n00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.561\nWe've estimated in our pre-production ROI,\nand\n\n177\n00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:21.965\nwe've estimated just exactly how much,\nor pre-project ROI, we've estimated\n\n178\n00:09:21.965 --> 00:09:27.742\nhow much we expect to get in terms of\na financial return from that project.\n\n179\n00:09:27.742 --> 00:09:31.047\nAnd then we calculated\nthe end of the project,\n\n180\n00:09:31.047 --> 00:09:36.490\npost-project ROI which is how much we\nactually have witnessed as a return.\n\n181\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.220\nSo how much we actually have\ngot back from that project.\n\n182\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.348\nBut that's not something\nthat we measure immediately.\n\n183\n00:09:44.348 --> 00:09:49.978\nWell you don't measure ROI the minute\nyou've implemented a new feature,\n\n184\n00:09:49.978 --> 00:09:52.490\nbecause-\n&gt;&gt; How can you get the information,\n\n185\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.870\nthe return, if it's just been implemented?\n\n186\n00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.076\nUsually, you have to go ahead and\nmonitor it for a little while.\n\n187\n00:09:58.076 --> 00:09:59.951\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for a period of months and\n\n188\n00:09:59.951 --> 00:10:03.320\nsometimes even years before\nyou get the true ROI.\n\n189\n00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.768\nAnd the problem with ROI,\nit's not a good measure of value anyway.\n\n190\n00:10:08.768 --> 00:10:11.470\nJust because you're making\na financial return on something,\n\n191\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:16.260\ndoesn't mean that your customers actually\nlike to use it and value is perceived.\n\n192\n00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.830\nSo when we talk about business value\ndelivered, it shouldn't just be in terms\n\n193\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:25.240\nof, and we jumped over there so\nI'll just jump back.\n\n194\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.760\nIt shouldn't just be terms in of business\nbut I can't even get my teeth in today.\n\n195\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.830\n[LAUGH] So our business value should\nnot measured just in terms of finances.\n\n196\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.258\nIt's not just about that pound sign or\nthat dollar sign.\n\n197\n00:10:40.258 --> 00:10:42.650\nIt's also about perceived value.\n\n198\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.290\nThat's an interesting one.\n\n199\n00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.213\nHow do we measure that?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think that that's\n\n200\n00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:48.471\na difficult task.\n\n201\n00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:53.348\nYeah, you need to be some\nkind of full-time analyst or\n\n202\n00:10:53.348 --> 00:10:55.610\nsome-\n&gt;&gt; Customer feedback.\n\n203\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n204\n00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.110\n&gt;&gt; Feedback surveys.\n\n205\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.410\nWe know that surveys aren't\ncompleted all that often.\n\n206\n00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.728\nI mean, I'll be honest with you.\n\n207\n00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:07.060\nThere's about 20% of surveys sort of\nindustry-wide that are actually completed,\n\n208\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.550\nand not a lot of surveys are completed.\n\n209\n00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.090\nAnd so\nit's up to us to make sure that when we\n\n210\n00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:17.660\nsurvey our customers we do it in a way\nthat is actually valuable to them.\n\n211\n00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.110\nAnd that we can demonstrate\nwhy we're doing it.\n\n212\n00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.280\nRemember, well, I say remember.\n\n213\n00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:29.000\nWe've actually covered in a few\nseries that we've done so far.\n\n214\n00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.241\nWe've looked at organizational\nchange management.\n\n215\n00:11:31.241 --> 00:11:35.675\nAnd we've looked at actually what we call\nKotter's eight steps to organizational\n\n216\n00:11:35.675 --> 00:11:36.560\nchange.\n\n217\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.450\nAnd one of those eight steps,\nthe first one is actually creating a need.\n\n218\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.720\nIf you wanna get somebody to do something\nfor you, you have to explain why.\n\n219\n00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.280\nYou have to create a need,\nyou have to create a desire in them to\n\n220\n00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.200\nwant to do that activity,\nno matter what that activity is.\n\n221\n00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.180\nAnd it's exactly the same with surveys,\n\n222\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.830\nyou've got to think\nabout this the same way.\n\n223\n00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.458\nYou've got to create a need.\n\n224\n00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:03.726\nIf you want a customer\nto fill out a survey,\n\n225\n00:12:03.726 --> 00:12:06.540\nthen you need to explain what's in it for\nthem.\n\n226\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.330\nYou should always ask that question,\ncreate that need,\n\n227\n00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.740\nwhat am I gonna get out\nof filling that survey?\n\n228\n00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.400\nIf I'm not gonna get anything out of it,\nthen I'm not gonna fill it out.\n\n229\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.378\n&gt;&gt; Right, and sometimes online I'll see,\n\n230\n00:12:16.378 --> 00:12:18.610\nget a 20% off coupon or\n\n231\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.910\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; The stores are doing now.\n\n232\n00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.915\nI mean,\nyou go into a lot of clothing stores now.\n\n233\n00:12:22.915 --> 00:12:24.240\n&gt;&gt; Free appetizer if you\n\n234\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.590\nfill out the customer service survey for\nall the restaurants as well.\n\n235\n00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.894\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, and so restaurants and\n\n236\n00:12:30.894 --> 00:12:33.270\nclothing stores and things like that.\n\n237\n00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.260\nThey're now doing that sort of thing.\n\n238\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.256\nHere's a link to a survey,\nif you fill this out,\n\n239\n00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:40.149\nwe'll give you 10% off your next purchase,\nsomething like that.\n\n240\n00:12:40.149 --> 00:12:43.643\nIf you fill this out, we'll give\nyou 10% off your next purchase, and\n\n241\n00:12:43.643 --> 00:12:45.603\nwe'll also bombard your email inbox-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n242\n00:12:45.603 --> 00:12:48.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] With loads of emails.\n\n243\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.038\n&gt;&gt; That's not something we'd recommend\n\n244\n00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:51.566\neither.\n\n245\n00:12:51.566 --> 00:12:55.549\nIf you're gonna ask somebody to fill out\na survey, don't bombard them with loads of\n\n246\n00:12:55.549 --> 00:12:59.270\nemails because that really is going to\ndiminish the value that's perceived.\n\n247\n00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.085\nCuz, again, what they're doing there is\nthey're putting that in financial terms\n\n248\n00:13:03.085 --> 00:13:06.670\nfor you and said, hey,\nlook there's a cash value to this.\n\n249\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.000\nBut then there's also\na downside to this as well,\n\n250\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.070\nin that you're gonna start\ngetting marketing emails.\n\n251\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.140\nSo just think,\nbe sensible when it comes to surveys.\n\n252\n00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.810\nBecause the more cumbersome\nthat the survey is, and\n\n253\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.470\nthe more irritating the survey\nis to the customer to fill out,\n\n254\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.190\nthen the less likely it is that\nthey're actually going to fill it out.\n\n255\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:30.530\nSo you can also measure progress of\nyour project by way of defect count.\n\n256\n00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:36.030\nIn other words, how many defects have\nbeen identified from each iteration,\n\n257\n00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.800\nand what the outstanding count is,\nand how many have been resolved?\n\n258\n00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.240\nThat's one way of measuring progress.\n\n259\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.010\nAt the end of each iteration though,\ndon't forget, we are taking or\n\n260\n00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:51.100\nmaking a decision as to what defects\nare going to be resolved, and what defects\n\n261\n00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.270\nare going to be left for either\nanother iteration or left completely.\n\n262\n00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.390\nAnd in fact,\nnow there's no longer a need and so\n\n263\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.210\nwe're not going to resolve\nthat defect at all.\n\n264\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.590\nAnd that's the same\nwith major impediments.\n\n265\n00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:07.150\nNow generally with a major impediment\nas opposed to just a defect,\n\n266\n00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.630\na defect is generally something small and\nfunctional that's gone wrong.\n\n267\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:16.680\nA major impediment is something that's\npotentially going to stop the project\n\n268\n00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.500\nfrom progressing any further.\n\n269\n00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.880\nI'd expect a major\nimpediment to be resolved,\n\n270\n00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.690\nbecause you really simply cannot\nprogress until it is resolved.\n\n271\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.167\nThat said I've known some major\nimpediments that are kind of shelved for\n\n272\n00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:35.078\nanother few iterations.\n\n273\n00:14:35.078 --> 00:14:35.743\nThat's up to you.\n\n274\n00:14:35.743 --> 00:14:37.441\nYou've got to make the decision on that,\nbut\n\n275\n00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:39.010\nwe should certainly be measuring those.\n\n276\n00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.240\nI mean,\nthe aim is to have zero major impediments.\n\n277\n00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.025\nBut I've never yet\ncome across a project that hasn't.\n\n278\n00:14:44.025 --> 00:14:46.992\n[LAUGH] So that's an aim.\n\n279\n00:14:46.992 --> 00:14:51.350\nAnd I aways like the last bullet\npoint when it comes to metric.\n\n280\n00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.100\nI aways like this.\n\n281\n00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.410\nThis is what I call\nthe toddler way of doing\n\n282\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:56.960\nmetrics.\n&gt;&gt; The whys.\n\n283\n00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.522\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n284\n00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:58.079\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n285\n00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:58.702\n&gt;&gt; The five whys.\n\n286\n00:14:58.702 --> 00:14:59.202\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n287\n00:14:59.202 --> 00:14:59.702\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n288\n00:14:59.702 --> 00:15:00.342\n&gt;&gt; Why is this happening?\n\n289\n00:15:00.342 --> 00:15:01.033\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n290\n00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then,\n\n291\n00:15:02.461 --> 00:15:06.932\nso well, because of the why?\nWell, because of, but why?\n\n292\n00:15:06.932 --> 00:15:07.743\nWe use this technique\n\n293\n00:15:07.743 --> 00:15:10.535\nin problem managements as well,\nwhen we're trying to find out whats gone\n\n294\n00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:11.327\nwrong.\n&gt;&gt; The root\n\n295\n00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:11.910\ncause\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n296\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:12.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n297\n00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:16.262\nactually the first time I was ever\nintroduced to this techinque, I failed\n\n298\n00:15:16.262 --> 00:15:18.407\nbecause I was called out in a classroom.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:15:18.407 --> 00:15:20.637\n&gt;&gt; And the instructor was asking me and\n\n300\n00:15:20.637 --> 00:15:25.110\nI was like trying to solve the problem\nwith each one of those questions.\n\n301\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.310\nShe's like, no, you can only ask why.\n\n302\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.160\nYou can only ask why.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.473\n&gt;&gt; And I'm like [SOUND] this is so\n\n304\n00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:33.347\nweird for me, I want to solve a problem.\n\n305\n00:15:33.347 --> 00:15:36.718\nBut she's like, no, you have to ask why.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n306\n00:15:36.718 --> 00:15:39.080\nyou have to go down to five levels-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n307\n00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.292\n&gt;&gt; Before you can actually get to\n\n308\n00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:40.977\nthe root cause.\n\n309\n00:15:40.977 --> 00:15:43.826\nWell there are other techniques\nthat are used in problem\n\n310\n00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:44.610\nmanagement-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n311\n00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.497\n&gt;&gt; To get to root\n\n312\n00:15:45.497 --> 00:15:46.117\ncause.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n313\n00:15:46.117 --> 00:15:47.633\n&gt;&gt; Ishikawa diagrams, or\n\n314\n00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:50.367\nfishbone analysis, or Pareto analysis.\n\n315\n00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:54.028\nThere's quite a lot of other\ntechniques that we use.\n\n316\n00:15:54.028 --> 00:15:58.760\nThis one is really about finding out\nReally find out whether we want to\n\n317\n00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.238\nmeasure something.\n\n318\n00:16:00.238 --> 00:16:03.715\nAnd, actually, that's quite\na good technique to use is, well,\n\n319\n00:16:03.715 --> 00:16:05.840\nwhy do we want to take this measurement?\n\n320\n00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.110\nRemember what I said, you should be able\nto do something with that measurement.\n\n321\n00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.560\nSo, why do we want to take it.\n\n322\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.459\nWell, generally, it's because,\nwell, I want to measure progress.\n\n323\n00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:16.080\nOkay, but\nwhy do we wanna measure progress?\n\n324\n00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.490\nWhy do we want to measure\nthis particular progress?\n\n325\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.340\nAnd we can go down five levels.\n\n326\n00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.060\nAnd if we can answer each one of those\nfive levels, I wouldn't say successfully,\n\n327\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.690\nbut if we can answer them to a point\nwhere actually that makes sense,\n\n328\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:29.420\nthen that's good.\n\n329\n00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.310\nWe should be taking that measurement.\n\n330\n00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.727\nIf we can't, then you've got\nto actually say to yourself,\n\n331\n00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.611\nthen why am I taking this metric?\n\n332\n00:16:36.611 --> 00:16:37.655\nDo I really need it?\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n333\n00:16:37.655 --> 00:16:39.510\njust because that's how\nwe've always done it?\n\n334\n00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.074\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n335\n00:16:40.074 --> 00:16:44.460\njust because that's how we've always done\nit, it's never a good way to start with\n\n336\n00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.702\nanything.\n&gt;&gt; I know, but\n\n337\n00:16:45.702 --> 00:16:47.410\nI've heard that one a few times.\n\n338\n00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.800\nSo that's why, and\n\n339\n00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.952\nI know other people have too.\n&gt;&gt; And, in fact, I mentioned about\n\n340\n00:16:52.952 --> 00:16:58.590\nKotter's 8 steps and transformational\nchange, resistance management.\n\n341\n00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.160\nAnd in our next episode,\n\n342\n00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.770\nactually, we're going to look at\nleadership in our next episode.\n\n343\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.282\nAnd that's one of the things that\nwe're going to pay attention to is\n\n344\n00:17:07.282 --> 00:17:08.520\nKotter's 8 steps.\n\n345\n00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.460\nAnd we're gonna look at\nsources of resistance.\n\n346\n00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.039\nAnd I can tell you now that one of\nthe biggest sources of resistance is,\n\n347\n00:17:14.039 --> 00:17:16.659\nquite simply, but\nwe've always done it that way.\n\n348\n00:17:16.659 --> 00:17:18.850\nYeah, I don't care.\n\n349\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.619\n[LAUGH] And\nI know that sounds mean, right, but\n\n350\n00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:24.960\nno, again we're going back\nto the what's in it for me.\n\n351\n00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.360\nAnd so if somebody is saying to you, but\nwe've always measured this, or we've\n\n352\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.760\nalways done things this way, then what\nwe've got to do is answer the question,\n\n353\n00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.930\nwell, what's in it for me, or\nrather, what's in it for them?\n\n354\n00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.590\nAnd this is what we're going to measure,\nand this is the reason why.\n\n355\n00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.600\nJustify why you're making those decisions.\n\n356\n00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.440\nSo one thing that I really\nwanna pay attention to is\n\n357\n00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.220\nthis iteration velocity chart that\nyou have in front of you here.\n\n358\n00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:55.080\nYou will see that in the pale blue there,\nyou've got what we have committed to.\n\n359\n00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.565\nAnd in the, well,\nI'd call that the royal blue, but\n\n360\n00:17:58.565 --> 00:18:03.220\nit's in a darker blue,\nyou've got what's actually been completed.\n\n361\n00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.502\nAnd then you've got the line,\nwhich is kind of the average over time.\n\n362\n00:18:08.502 --> 00:18:12.600\nWe wanna aim for\nconsistency across all of our iterations.\n\n363\n00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.540\nAnd we've already said this, and\nI've mentioned this previously.\n\n364\n00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.286\nYou wanna aim for consistency.\n\n365\n00:18:17.286 --> 00:18:21.534\nWhat you will notice here though\nis that in sprint number 4, or\n\n366\n00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:26.000\niteration number 4,\nwe actually got our planning right.\n\n367\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.666\nBut we did it in the first sprint as well,\nbut look at the rest of them.\n\n368\n00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:33.610\n[LAUGH] No, 8, not too bad.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n369\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.990\nthat looks accurate.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n370\n00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:39.820\nthe rest of them, I mean if I look at 2\nand I look at 5, well, actually yeah,\n\n371\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.220\nand seven, too, I'm holding my\nhead in my hands and thinking,\n\n372\n00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.376\nI'm not very good at planning, am I?\n&gt;&gt; Really, cuz I'm thinking,\n\n373\n00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:49.991\nthey're only a few points off.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n374\n00:18:49.991 --> 00:18:55.920\nmaybe they're only a few points off, or a\nfew stories off, but is that good enough?\n\n375\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.768\nIs that really effective planning?\n\n376\n00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:05.399\nNo, it's not, cuz what's happened\nto all of those spare stories now?\n\n377\n00:19:05.399 --> 00:19:07.605\nWhere are they?\n&gt;&gt; They're hiding under the bed, Jo.\n\n378\n00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:09.945\nYou're going to find them\nwhen you clean the room.\n\n379\n00:19:09.945 --> 00:19:10.925\n&gt;&gt; Right, actually,\n\n380\n00:19:10.925 --> 00:19:14.170\nit's not as bad as it looks,\nto be perfectly honest.\n\n381\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.455\nYeah, who says I clean rooms.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:18.876\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not actually as bad as it\n\n383\n00:19:18.876 --> 00:19:23.558\nlooks, because what happens is that,\nlet's say sprint number 2,\n\n384\n00:19:23.558 --> 00:19:27.271\nwe've got two stories that\ndidn't get completed, or\n\n385\n00:19:27.271 --> 00:19:31.105\nit's two story points that\ndidn't get completed.\n\n386\n00:19:31.105 --> 00:19:35.095\nThat's handed onto the next iteration,\nperhaps, right?\n\n387\n00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:36.455\nThere's an assumption there.\n\n388\n00:19:36.455 --> 00:19:39.245\nAnd so therefore, actually,\nwhat we've managed to do is\n\n389\n00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:43.135\nthe next iteration in sprint 3,\nwe've taken that backlog down to one.\n\n390\n00:19:43.135 --> 00:19:47.045\nAnd in the subsequent iteration in sprint\n4, we've wiped out the backlog now,\n\n391\n00:19:47.045 --> 00:19:52.420\nbecause the extra one was added on\nto the expected for the next month.\n\n392\n00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.010\nYeah, so it's not as bad as it seems.\n\n393\n00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.370\nBut what I am seeing is\nthat we were really,\n\n394\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.900\nreally good at planning at\nthe start of our project.\n\n395\n00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.810\nIn that first iteration,\nwe planned really well, but\n\n396\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.440\nthe second and the third,\nwe didn't plan so well.\n\n397\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.070\nI mentioned in previous episodes\nabout a team evolving, and\n\n398\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.310\nit evolves over the life of the project.\n\n399\n00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.290\nAnd what I also expect is our estimations\nto get better and more accurate over\n\n400\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:24.950\nthe life of the project, as well, because\nthe team starts to work better together.\n\n401\n00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:29.920\nIt's a better team, because they're\nevolving their collaboration mechanisms.\n\n402\n00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.183\n&gt;&gt; Gotten in the groove.\n\n403\n00:20:31.183 --> 00:20:32.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, gotten in their groove,\n\n404\n00:20:32.817 --> 00:20:35.850\nstarted to get on with each\nother a bit more, should we say.\n\n405\n00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.740\nBut that could also have\na detrimental effect,\n\n406\n00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.870\nbecause they might not be getting\non with each other at all.\n\n407\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.980\nYeah, but look at the planning here,\n\n408\n00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.030\nI mean, if I was product owner,\nI'd be quite disappointed.\n\n409\n00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:53.012\nMe and the Scrum master would be having\nsome talks at this point in time.\n\n410\n00:20:53.012 --> 00:20:53.720\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah,\n\n411\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.030\nI mean they were spon on for\nthat first sprint.\n\n412\n00:20:56.030 --> 00:21:00.450\nAnd like we spoke about, you would expect\na little bit of variation or deviation\n\n413\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.002\nthere and then get more accurate.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n414\n00:21:03.002 --> 00:21:04.114\nthat really didn't happen.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n415\n00:21:04.114 --> 00:21:04.916\nthat didn't happen.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n416\n00:21:04.916 --> 00:21:08.082\nthat's exactly what's supposed to\nhappen is that the planning and\n\n417\n00:21:08.082 --> 00:21:10.540\nthe prediction should get\nmore accurate over time.\n\n418\n00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.570\nThat estimation should get more accurate.\n\n419\n00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:16.610\nAnd, in fact,\nwe kinda got accurate by sprint number 4.\n\n420\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.451\nAnd then we went on the sprint number 5,\nand what on Earth happened?\n\n421\n00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:25.160\n[LAUGH] Because, yeah, we achieved a lot,\nbut we didn't achieve what we expected,\n\n422\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.450\nso we're not planning particularly\nwell at that point in time.\n\n423\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.110\nSure, we're trying to catch up,\nand that's what it looks like.\n\n424\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.250\nI look at number 5 and I say, we've been\ntrying to catch up at that point in time,\n\n425\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.520\nbecause the last sprint we\ndidn't achieve so much.\n\n426\n00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.090\nWe're only really interested,\n\n427\n00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.308\nin terms of delivery,\nwe're only interested in the average.\n\n428\n00:21:45.308 --> 00:21:51.130\nBut from a product owner's perspective,\nand also a Scrum master's perspective,\n\n429\n00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:55.750\nI'm interested in planning, and\nI'm interested in accurate estimation.\n\n430\n00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.450\nAnd I know I keep using those two words\ntogether in the same sentence, and\n\n431\n00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.310\nyou might think that they don't fit, but\n\n432\n00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.100\nI wanna get my estimation as accurate as\npossible over the life of the project.\n\n433\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.070\nIt should be improving,\nand it's really not.\n\n434\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.920\nIf I look at that, it's really not.\n\n435\n00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.850\nSo there's something going wrong, and\nthat's something that needs addressing.\n\n436\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:19.480\nAnd this is one of the reasons why I\ndo need to ensure that I am taking\n\n437\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.240\nsome reports.\n\n438\n00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.760\nSure, I don't wanna be doing reporting for\nthe sake of doing reporting.\n\n439\n00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.040\nBut this is a perfect example of\nreporting that is really needed.\n\n440\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:37.080\nThis is not necessarily a burn down or\na burn up chart.\n\n441\n00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.240\nThis is not necessarily about progress.\n\n442\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.600\nThis particular chart is about planning,\nand\n\n443\n00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.820\nthis is telling me that\nour planning is not great.\n\n444\n00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.260\nAnd that we've got to improve.\n\n445\n00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.220\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n446\n00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.796\nAnd we've got other, sort of,\nsamples of reports here, just on, and\n\n447\n00:22:54.796 --> 00:22:58.170\nagain, this is downloadable\nin your information.\n\n448\n00:23:00.635 --> 00:23:03.783\nAnd all of these slides, by the way,\nthat you've seen in all of our episodes,\n\n449\n00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:05.185\nall downloadable for you.\n\n450\n00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:10.655\nThese are just samples of charts that\nyou might have within your project.\n\n451\n00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:15.795\nUltimately, the only thing that I\nwill tell you is that when it comes\n\n452\n00:23:15.795 --> 00:23:21.150\nto measurements, you need to be able\nto make a decision from that metric.\n\n453\n00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.400\nAnd if you can't make\na decision from that metric,\n\n454\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.090\nthen you have to ask yourself,\nwhy, why am I taking that?\n\n455\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:32.280\nSo that's just sort of a few\nthoughts on Agile metrics there.\n\n456\n00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.520\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\nwe're going to be looking in a lot more\n\n457\n00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:41.910\ndepth at what I'd already mentioned about\nKotter's 8 steps and also about leadership\n\n458\n00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.950\nin general from an Agile perspective.\n&gt;&gt; All right, great.\n\n459\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.390\nThank you so much for your time today,\nJo, and thank you for your time as well.\n\n460\n00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.340\nBut we're out of time, so let's sign out.\n\n461\n00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.900\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n462\n00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.246\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n463\n00:23:55.246 --> 00:24:00.895\n[MUSIC]\n\n464\n00:24:00.895 -->

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:08.239\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.940\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.420\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone, to your\nAgile Product Owner series, I'm your host,\n\n6\n00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.000\nCherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.660\nAnd according to our lower third,\nin this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.230\nwe're gonna be looking at\nLeadership Behaviours.\n\n9\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.720\nAnd you know Jo, Mrs.\nJo Peacock in studio is with me today,\n\n10\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.370\nis going to be the one to make\nsure I'm saying this correctly or\n\n11\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.830\nmaking fun of me, either of the two, we're\nhere to talk about leadership behaviors.\n\n12\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.810\n&gt;&gt; Well I just want to give a big shout\nout actually to our director, Taylor.\n\n13\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.815\nYou see, this is Taylor's doing.\n\n14\n00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:46.610\nHe decided, probably because of my\ninsistence, that we actually spelled\n\n15\n00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.980\nthe lower third correctly,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.830\n&gt;&gt; So the bar underneath\n\n17\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.345\nwe've got the English spelling\nof the word behavior that's so-\n\n18\n00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:58.205\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] in English but yes,\n\n19\n00:00:58.205 --> 00:00:58.977\n[LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:00.783\n&gt;&gt; So\nnow we're educating Cherokee [LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:03.335\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nI'm getting educated here.\n\n22\n00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:04.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you know what, so\n\n23\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.070\nare you, because in this show we're gonna\nbe looking at leadership qualities.\n\n24\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.960\nAnd this is is pretty cool because\nyou said in an earlier episode Jo,\n\n25\n00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.220\nthat there's a difference\nbetween managers and leaders.\n\n26\n00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.060\nSo I'm kind of curious to see what\nreally defines and makes a leader here.\n\n27\n00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.110\n&gt;&gt; We're actually going to be talking\nabout what we call servant leadership.\n\n28\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.940\nAnd servant leadership is,\n\n29\n00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.320\nwell it's, there's a difference\nbetween management and a leader and\n\n30\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.130\nwe don't like to refer to our leadership\nwithin an agile team as having\n\n31\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.790\nany sort of authority should we say,\nit's just a responsibility.\n\n32\n00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.420\nAnd you know, it's funny because\npersonally I always had to,\n\n33\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.120\nI've always had this personal ethic and\nI've always said to people,\n\n34\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.150\nwe all just have different skills and\nit's not about hierarchy,\n\n35\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.830\nit's just a simple fact that\nwe all have different skills.\n\n36\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.070\nWe all know how to do certain things and\nthere is a lot of things that I couldn't\n\n37\n00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.410\ndo and there's a lot of people that\ncouldn't do the job that I do.\n\n38\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.300\nSo we've all just got a completely\ndifferent suite of skills and\n\n39\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.230\nin Agile we recognize that.\n\n40\n00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.300\nWe don't actually want to\nassert any authority at all,\n\n41\n00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.890\nwe recognize that we've\ngot servant leaders.\n\n42\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.700\nIn other words, we've got people who\nare performing certain roles that\n\n43\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.010\nordinarily people might think of as being\na management role and being a senior role.\n\n44\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.700\nAnd what we're saying is,\nit doesn't have to be a senior role.\n\n45\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.873\nHere we are in Agile and we're looking\nat product owner, specifically,\n\n46\n00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:41.774\nand what I've said in previous episodes\nis the fact that the product owner\n\n47\n00:02:41.774 --> 00:02:45.829\nis somebody who has to take\naccountability for the product.\n\n48\n00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.828\nAnd it's somebody who has to understand\nthe product, they have to understand\n\n49\n00:02:49.828 --> 00:02:53.342\nthe business, they have to understand\nwhat the business wants, and\n\n50\n00:02:53.342 --> 00:02:57.159\nwe looked in a previous episode at\nthe possibility that that person might be\n\n51\n00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.430\nsomebody from the business or might even\nbe somebody from say, the service desk.\n\n52\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.360\nFor instance, the service desk analyst.\n\n53\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.220\nAnd I could tell by the look in your face,\nyou're kind [LAUGH] by the look,\n\n54\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.990\nI could tell, you're kind of surprised\nby what I said at that point in time,\n\n55\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.120\nbecause you'd considered what service\ndesk analyst performing this role,\n\n56\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.750\na product owner,\nsurely that's a senior role.\n\n57\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.750\nBut a product owner is a role, it's\nsomebody that looks after the product.\n\n58\n00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.630\nAnd they're going to be making\ndecisions on the product, based on what\n\n59\n00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.620\nthe development team have said to them,\nand also what the business want to see.\n\n60\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.980\nSo it's gotta be somebody that\nunderstands the business, so\n\n61\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.280\nthis is a coordination role.\n\n62\n00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.560\nThis is not a senior management role,\nit's a coordination role.\n\n63\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.730\nSo we refer to them as a servant leader,\nbecause their job is not there to manage,\n\n64\n00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.740\ntheir job is not there to dictate,\ntheir job there is to coordinate and\n\n65\n00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.520\nto take information from\nthe rest of the team.\n\n66\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.999\nAnd to actually coordinate\nthat information and\n\n67\n00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.710\nthen to assimilate that and\nsay well okay, this is what I think.\n\n68\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.520\nBut ultimately the product owner doesn't\nmake any decisions without coordinating,\n\n69\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.890\ncollaborating with the rest of the team.\n\n70\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.920\nAnd it's exactly the same for\nthe scrum master,\n\n71\n00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.350\nI don't expect the scrum master to be\nsomebody that is a senior manager.\n\n72\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.160\nI expect it to be somebody that\nhas the ability to maybe mediate\n\n73\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.930\nwhenever there is conflict cuz you know,\nsometimes in teams it happens.\n\n74\n00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.530\n&gt;&gt; It does happen.\n\n75\n00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so I expect the scrum\nmaster to be somebody that mediates.\n\n76\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.120\nI expect the scrum master again to\nbe somebody that can direct and\n\n77\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.680\nthat can look at things from\nan objective perspective.\n\n78\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.480\nBut, we don't have to\nhave senior managers.\n\n79\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.330\nAnd I think that that is a great\nmix when it comes to any project.\n\n80\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.990\nSo when it comes to certainly Agile, that\nwe need to have this hierarchy laid out.\n\n81\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.500\nBecause yes we need to have an org chart\nor we need to need to understand roles and\n\n82\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.190\nresponsibilities, but it doesn't\nnecessarily have to be in a hierarchy.\n\n83\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.980\nIt's just a role.\n\n84\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.020\nIt's a set of responsibilities.\n\n85\n00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.860\nThen it's perfectly feasible\nthat our developers,\n\n86\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.120\nwell each of them have their own role and\nthey have their own skills.\n\n87\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.640\nNow product owner has their own skills,\nand they perform their own role.\n\n88\n00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.360\nBut it doesn't mean that one\nis more senior than the other.\n\n89\n00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.680\nAnd so I want you to bear\nthat in mind as we go into,\n\n90\n00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.640\nyou go into your Agile projects,\nwe're all sort of equal and\n\n91\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.310\nthat we all just do different roles\nwithin the project, that's all.\n\n92\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.600\nA leader is somebody that leads us,\nsomebody that advises,\n\n93\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.740\nit's somebody that guides.\n\n94\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.830\nIt's not somebody that walks\naround with a baseball bat.\n\n95\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.950\nI mean I don't know about you.\n\n96\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.140\nWhen I was in school we were\nfrightened silly by we used to have-\n\n97\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.520\n&gt;&gt; A school master or something?\n\n98\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we used to have\na what we call a headmaster,\n\n99\n00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.750\nwhich is what you'd call\na principal I think, here.\n\n100\n00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.610\nAnd our headmaster used to\nwander around with a cane.\n\n101\n00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I went to private school and\n\n102\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.382\nin public school that type of thing wasn't\nallowed, but it was allowed at my school.\n\n103\n00:06:15.382 --> 00:06:18.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It was allowed when I\n\n104\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.300\nwas a kid, yeah definitely.\n\n105\n00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.980\nAnd that's kind of more of a dictatorship.\n\n106\n00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.790\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n&gt;&gt; Than anything else.\n\n107\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.060\nAnd we don't want to encourage that,\nwe want to encourage a leadership\n\n108\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.540\nstyle that is a lot more open and\nthat really is leading and\n\n109\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.590\ndirecting rather than dictating.\n\n110\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:46.240\nSo really a leader has to be able to lead,\ngiven whatever the circumstances may be.\n\n111\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.470\nAnd a leader has to be somebody that's\nadaptable to those circumstances.\n\n112\n00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.810\nSo an Agile leader is somebody with\na high degree of learning agility.\n\n113\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.360\nIn other words they've gotta be adaptable,\nso they've got to be able to learn.\n\n114\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.310\nIt's gotta be somebody that\ncan adapt to situations and\n\n115\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:10.770\nit's gotta be somebody that well,\ntells you, they're self aware,\n\n116\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.030\nthat has mental agility and that has\npeople agility that can work with people\n\n117\n00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.700\nand that can accommodate change but\nis also results-driven.\n\n118\n00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.700\nAnd this is why,\nas crazy as it may seem to some of you,\n\n119\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.150\nthe role of the product owner for\ninstance, if it's undertaken,\n\n120\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.640\nif you think of the service desk and\nthe service desk environment,\n\n121\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.690\nif that role's undertaken by somebody\nin an operational environment,\n\n122\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.060\nsomebody like a service desk analyst or\nlike a service desk manager,\n\n123\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.330\nyou'll see that the service desk analyst,\nor the service desk manager,\n\n124\n00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.650\nhas got that change agility because\nevery single phone call that they take-\n\n125\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.270\n&gt;&gt; They have to be, yeah.\n\n126\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.530\n&gt;&gt; Is completely different.\n\n127\n00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.617\nThey're driven by results because\nordinarily they'll be, they'll have key\n\n128\n00:07:52.617 --> 00:07:56.460\nperformance indicators and targets for\nanswering calls and for resolving\n\n129\n00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.608\nincidents And they got the People Agility\nbecause they're using to dealing with\n\n130\n00:08:00.608 --> 00:08:05.000\ndifferent people every time they pick\nup the phone, it's a different person.\n\n131\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.390\nAnd that's that Mental Agility as well,\n\n132\n00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.500\nto be switching from one support\ncall to another support call for\n\n133\n00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.160\na different service to another\nsupport call for a different service.\n\n134\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.860\nAnd they have to be completely aware\nas to how they are being responded to.\n\n135\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.430\nIn other words,\nevery time I pick up the phone,\n\n136\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.620\nif the person at the other end of the\nphone doesn't like me or maybe, and this\n\n137\n00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.600\nhappens with me because obviously I've got\nan accent but I live here in the states.\n\n138\n00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.190\nAnd it happens to me quite often that\nI'll get on the phone to somebody and\n\n139\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.890\nthey don't understand me.\n\n140\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.110\nSo I have to have that self\nawareness to know that\n\n141\n00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.030\nactually this person doesn't\nunderstand what I'm saying.\n\n142\n00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:52.965\nSo I need to speak clearer or\nI need to adjust my behavior accordingly.\n\n143\n00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:57.461\nAnd that's exactly what we expect\na product owner to be able to do,\n\n144\n00:08:57.461 --> 00:09:02.438\nto have that self awareness to say,\nokay, I'm not being understood, so\n\n145\n00:09:02.438 --> 00:09:05.522\ntherefore I need to\nadjust what I'm saying.\n\n146\n00:09:05.522 --> 00:09:09.450\nOr maybe I need to clarify\nwhat I'm saying, or\n\n147\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:15.311\nmaybe I need to go back and\nrevisit the point that I'm trying to make.\n\n148\n00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:21.090\nBecause maybe that's not the important\npoint, maybe I need to re-prioritize.\n\n149\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.850\nYour product owner is a translator.\n\n150\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.630\nAgain, another reason why I bring\nthe service desk into this, and\n\n151\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.660\nour business relationship\nmanagement type role,\n\n152\n00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.530\nbecause the product owner is somebody that\nwill translate the business requirements\n\n153\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.970\ninto IT speak into an IT language.\n\n154\n00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.940\nSo it has to be somebody\nthat is able to do that.\n\n155\n00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.380\nAgain, we talk about that mental agility.\n\n156\n00:09:48.428 --> 00:09:53.706\nI just wanna take a look because\nthe sort of skills that an Agile leader\n\n157\n00:09:53.706 --> 00:10:00.167\nneeds because the Agile environment is one\nwhere we are accommodating change a lot.\n\n158\n00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:02.854\nAnd we welcome change.\n\n159\n00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:07.972\nI've gotta be politically correct\nhere when I say this, but\n\n160\n00:10:07.972 --> 00:10:13.050\nI have come across some project managers\nthat do not want to accommodate change.\n\n161\n00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.405\nOnce we have, especially in\na traditional waterfall approach,\n\n162\n00:10:18.405 --> 00:10:21.470\nonce we have agreed on\nthat acceptance criteria,\n\n163\n00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.652\nthe service acceptance criteria that sa,s\nright this is what we're going to deliver.\n\n164\n00:10:25.652 --> 00:10:29.790\nOnce we've agreed on that, I have come\nacross in my time some project managers\n\n165\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.710\nthat have said, right that's it,\nI'm not moving.\n\n166\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.710\nI don't want to accommodate change,\n\n167\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:41.590\nI'm not actually moving from that\nparticular set of requirements.\n\n168\n00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.190\nThat's not what we want in an Agile\nleader, because in an Agile leader is\n\n169\n00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.650\ngotta be somebody who says yeah\nthat's great, we'll consider that.\n\n170\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.250\nLet's sit down and work out why\nyou need it and let's sit down and\n\n171\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.860\nwork out if that's exactly what you need.\n\n172\n00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.040\nThat's what an Agile leader\nneeds to be able to do.\n\n173\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.930\nSo as I've said,\nit's gotta be somebody who\n\n174\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:04.370\nhas that ability to translate\nthe customer needs into something for IT.\n\n175\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.110\nSo, let's take a look at those\nleadership qualities and\n\n176\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.960\nyou'll see that actually what's least\nimportant, is that technical expertise.\n\n177\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.820\nWhat's more important is that\nability to motivate people and\n\n178\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.600\nto work well across all the cultures and\nto facilitate change.\n\n179\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.680\nWorking well across all the cultures means\nworking in the business environment and\n\n180\n00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.120\nworking in the IT environment as well.\n\n181\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.277\nIt's about motivating people,\nit's about leading,\n\n182\n00:11:36.277 --> 00:11:39.200\nnot dictating, it's about leading.\n\n183\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.041\nAnd we've got another\nparticular slide that,\n\n184\n00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:45.457\nwhich is our next slide once\nwe're on a full screen here.\n\n185\n00:11:45.457 --> 00:11:50.350\nAnd you'll see that other attributes that\nthey need are things like tolerance.\n\n186\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:55.925\nI love tolerance, sometimes called a thick\nskin, and that's [LAUGH] something again,\n\n187\n00:11:55.925 --> 00:11:58.980\nthat service desk analysts will\ntend to have quite a lot of.\n\n188\n00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.470\nBut they need to be creative in the way\nthat they're thinking for a product owner.\n\n189\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.980\nThey need to have critical\nthinking as well though,\n\n190\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.600\nbecause we need to look at something-\n&gt;&gt; That's it, problem solving.\n\n191\n00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, problem solving, but also\nasking questions like, is that feasible?\n\n192\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:19.148\nEmotional resilience, again, is something\nelse that you'll find on a service desk is\n\n193\n00:12:19.148 --> 00:12:25.370\nthat ability to not take [LAUGH]\nthings personally, it's not really you\n\n194\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.730\nthey're shouting at,\nit's just their frustration.\n\n195\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That they're expressing.\n\n196\n00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:37.510\nSo all of these attributes, they're\nreally, really important when it comes to\n\n197\n00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:42.060\nleading in an Agile environment,\nAgile means change.\n\n198\n00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.260\nI wanna go back one slide though,\nwhile we're doing,\n\n199\n00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.750\nin that left hand corner right?\n\n200\n00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.578\nAt the bottom there, it says least\nimportant is technical expertise.\n\n201\n00:12:51.578 --> 00:12:54.160\nAnd actually bringing in the numbers,\n\n202\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.179\nin other words the KPIs and\nadhering to the KPIs.\n\n203\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.320\nWhy do you think,\n\n204\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.390\nI'm gonna put you on the spot now-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n205\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.770\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, cuz I like doing this.\n\n206\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.220\n&gt;&gt; Why do you think\n\n208\n00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.310\nthe technical expertise\nis the least important?\n\n209\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.072\n&gt;&gt; Because there are other individuals\nwho should be handling that and\n\n210\n00:13:12.072 --> 00:13:14.956\nlooking at leadership,\nI couldn't agree more.\n\n211\n00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:18.758\nAnd I don't know if this is\nthe right answer or not, but\n\n212\n00:13:18.758 --> 00:13:22.811\nat least in our environment,\nand our particular leader,\n\n213\n00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:26.303\nI think our leader does\na great job at motivating.\n\n214\n00:13:26.303 --> 00:13:29.055\nAnd that's kind of what our team,\nour culture,\n\n215\n00:13:29.055 --> 00:13:32.690\nneeds at least like we've\ntalk about in previous shows.\n\n216\n00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.430\nI know personally I thrive on that,\nthat motivation and\n\n217\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.690\nthat inspiration, and that's not something\nthat requires a technical skill set.\n\n218\n00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, what they need to\nhave is a technical bias or\n\n219\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.369\na technical understanding.\n\n220\n00:13:46.369 --> 00:13:50.153\nIt's an understanding of\nthe technical environment,\n\n221\n00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:52.978\nit's an understanding of the language.\n\n222\n00:13:52.978 --> 00:13:55.137\nBecause they have to act as a translator,\n\n223\n00:13:55.137 --> 00:13:58.668\nthe product owner is acting as\na translator from the business to IT.\n\n224\n00:13:58.668 --> 00:14:02.455\nBut they don't have to do the work,\nthey're not doing any developmental work,\n\n225\n00:14:02.455 --> 00:14:05.150\nthe product owner shouldn't be doing that.\n\n226\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.923\nSo you don't actually need\nthat technical expertise,\n\n227\n00:14:08.923 --> 00:14:14.301\nthe other thing about technical expertise\nand something that I say quite a lot,\n\n228\n00:14:14.301 --> 00:14:19.950\nin quite a few classrooms in my time\nis technical expertise can be learned.\n\n229\n00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:20.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n230\n00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.528\n&gt;&gt; The ability to get on with people and\n\n231\n00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:26.960\ninter-personal skills is not\nsomething that you can learn.\n\n232\n00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.430\nIf I take a look at the other attributes\nthat we looked at on the last slide that\n\n233\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:36.480\nwe had, conviction and courage and\ncuriosity and critical thinking.\n\n234\n00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.305\nCreativity is not something\nthat can be learned.\n\n235\n00:14:39.305 --> 00:14:41.330\nI'll be completely honest with you,\n\n236\n00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.755\nI am not the most creative person\nin the world, well, I am not.\n\n237\n00:14:44.755 --> 00:14:48.780\n[LAUGH] And therefore,\nthis is not something that can be learned,\n\n238\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.980\nyou can't do that.\n\n239\n00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.250\nBut you can learn the technical expertise,\nand\n\n240\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.220\nthe other thing is that the bottom\non there on the left hand corner.\n\n241\n00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.560\nWe're first bringing in numbers,\nit refers to being able to maintain\n\n242\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.310\nKPIs when it comes to\nactually delivering software.\n\n243\n00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:10.580\nIf you have the right person at\nthe helm exactly as you've just said,\n\n244\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.630\nif you've got the right person at\nthe helm, and they are motivating you and\n\n245\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.910\nthey are driving you, then the numbers\nare going to achieve themselves.\n\n246\n00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.760\nIf you've got somebody at the helm,\nsomebody leading you,\n\n247\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.780\nwho is just driven by numbers-\n&gt;&gt; Focused by those numbers, yep.\n\n248\n00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.500\n&gt;&gt; Then all that's gonna happen is\nwe're going to do everything we can to\n\n249\n00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.650\nachieve numbers but the quality-\n&gt;&gt; I've seen it firsthand.\n\n250\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna go down.\n\n251\n00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.850\n&gt;&gt; Drives a business into the ground.\n\n252\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, and\n\n253\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.030\nso we don't want somebody that's\ngonna be focused on numbers.\n\n254\n00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:46.307\nWe don't want somebody who's gonna\nbe focused on the bottom line.\n\n255\n00:15:46.307 --> 00:15:51.191\nWe need somebody who's gonna be focused\non quality, because if you sacrifice\n\n256\n00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:56.229\nthe quality for the numbers, then you're\ngonna end up with demotivated staff.\n\n257\n00:15:56.229 --> 00:15:59.281\nYou're gonna end up with staff who,\nwell, are just not demotivated.\n\n258\n00:15:59.281 --> 00:15:59.926\n&gt;&gt; Disgruntled.\n\n259\n00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:02.330\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, and\nthey could actually be resistant.\n\n260\n00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.835\nAnd we're gonna talk\nabout that in a second.\n\n261\n00:16:03.835 --> 00:16:04.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n262\n00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.648\n&gt;&gt; So the last thing that we need is\nresistance in our staff because if\n\n263\n00:16:08.648 --> 00:16:12.790\nyou've got resistance, then you're not\ngonna get any performance out of them.\n\n264\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.140\nIf you're good at motivating staff and\nyou're good at talking to everybody and\n\n265\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.370\nyou're good at being able to handle and\nfacilitate change,\n\n266\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.020\nthen all of that's gonna\ncome naturally anyway.\n\n267\n00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.380\nSo we call it, and I've already\nmentioned this, servant leadership.\n\n268\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.080\nAnd just in our bottom right hand corner\nthere you'll see that we need somebody\n\n269\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:41.850\nthat's got more of a balance between the\ndelegative style and a free reign style.\n\n270\n00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.993\nIn other words, the free reign style\nis where we let everybody go and\n\n271\n00:16:44.993 --> 00:16:46.051\ndo what they wanna do.\n\n272\n00:16:46.051 --> 00:16:48.980\nAnd obviously, you don't want that.\n\n273\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.100\nBut you've got to empower\nyour team to be able to\n\n274\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.920\ndo what they feel that they need to do.\n\n275\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.037\nYou have to trust them.\n\n276\n00:16:58.037 --> 00:17:03.576\nDelegative means that, basically, and\nit can be perceived as you're just giving\n\n277\n00:17:03.576 --> 00:17:09.290\neverything that you've got to other people\nto do, and you're letting them do that.\n\n278\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.750\nYou wanna get the balance right.\n\n279\n00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.060\nSo you still need to be\ndoing something yourself.\n\n280\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.910\nBut you don't want to give them full\ncontrol because, quite frankly,\n\n281\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.830\nthen what we'll end up with is chaos.\n\n282\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.249\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because everybody will be doing\n\n283\n00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:21.828\ntheir own thing.\n\n284\n00:17:21.828 --> 00:17:25.398\nSo we have to have\nthe balance between the two.\n\n285\n00:17:25.398 --> 00:17:29.649\nBut that's where this\nservant-leadership sits,\n\n286\n00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:32.650\nis right at that end of the spectrum.\n\n287\n00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.310\nNot at the autocratic\nside of the spectrum.\n\n288\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.526\nWhere literally, as I said, you're\nwandering around like my old headmaster,\n\n289\n00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:44.494\nwandering [LAUGH] around with a cane,\nthreatening people that if they don't\n\n290\n00:17:44.494 --> 00:17:48.713\nbehave or if they don't tow the line then\nthis is what's going to happen to them.\n\n291\n00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:53.663\nSo we wanna get to that point\nwhere we have got a leader\n\n292\n00:17:53.663 --> 00:17:58.910\nthat empowers people and motivates people.\n\n293\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.195\nYou were gonna say something just then.\n\n294\n00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:06.145\n&gt;&gt; Well, just going back to I feel\nlike knowing your team or at least\n\n295\n00:18:06.145 --> 00:18:10.115\nspending time with your team so you can\ndelegate appropriately, and making sure\n\n296\n00:18:10.115 --> 00:18:14.400\nthat you have the right people on board\nwill help with that delegation as well.\n\n297\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, definitely.\n\n298\n00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.480\nAnd it is really about\nthe interpersonal skills.\n\n299\n00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.350\nIt's the getting on with people.\n\n300\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.388\nAnd it's been able to lead a team,\nnot manage a team.\n\n301\n00:18:25.388 --> 00:18:26.920\nThere's a difference.\n\n302\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.251\nNow I've already mentioned resistance,\nand I mentioned that once and\n\n303\n00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:34.342\nnow I'm gonna get on to that a little bit.\n\n304\n00:18:34.342 --> 00:18:39.078\nDid you know that one negative voice\ncan undermine the positive attitude of\n\n305\n00:18:39.078 --> 00:18:40.150\n500 people?\n\n306\n00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.220\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n307\n00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:46.639\n&gt;&gt; Right, a good leader is able to\nidentify sources of resistance and\n\n308\n00:18:46.639 --> 00:18:51.979\nis able to overcome those sources\nof resistance within any team.\n\n309\n00:18:51.979 --> 00:18:57.045\nAnd bearing in mind that in an agile team,\nwe are subject to a lot of\n\n310\n00:18:57.045 --> 00:19:03.330\nfrequent change, perhaps, at the end\nof every iteration things might change.\n\n311\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.290\nAnd what we were expecting to do next\nweek might not be what we're gonna be\n\n312\n00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.190\ndoing next week.\n\n313\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.730\nSo we're subject to change.\n\n314\n00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.029\nAnd we may also actually be the ones\nthat are implementing change.\n\n315\n00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:16.561\nAnd so in every organization,\nwe're going to come across, in our team,\n\n316\n00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:18.700\nsome sources of resistance.\n\n317\n00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.130\nAnd what we've got to be able\nto do is handle that resistance.\n\n318\n00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.360\nAnd this is why the leadership is so\nimportant.\n\n319\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.690\nLeadership has to be able to\ndeal with that resistance.\n\n320\n00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.470\nSo what we've got here is on our next\nslide we've got something called,\n\n321\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.450\nit's transformational change methodology.\n\n322\n00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:40.590\nAnd this is actually something that\nwas devised by somebody by the name of\n\n323\n00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:44.200\nJP Cotter, John Cotter,\nwho was an alumni of Harvard,\n\n324\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.700\nand he came up with the eight\nsteps to transformational change.\n\n325\n00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.290\nThis is all about identifying\nsources of resistance,\n\n326\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.150\nreally motivating people to change.\n\n327\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.420\nSo motivating people for\nan agile environment.\n\n328\n00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.185\nAnd you know what, it's the first step\nthat to me is the most important.\n\n329\n00:20:04.185 --> 00:20:09.352\nWhilst they're all important,\nand I'm sorry John,\n\n330\n00:20:09.352 --> 00:20:12.514\nI don't want to [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Step on your toes.\n\n331\n00:20:12.514 --> 00:20:15.711\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm not saying that\nany of these are bad, but\n\n332\n00:20:15.711 --> 00:20:21.140\nthat first step is actually really what I\nwould consider to be the most important.\n\n333\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.930\nAnd it's what organizations\nthat are very good at strategy,\n\n334\n00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.090\norganizations like that will\nbe really good at this.\n\n335\n00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:33.660\nAnd that is that creating the sense of\nurgency, or creating a need for change.\n\n336\n00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:42.922\nI know of a lot of hardware manufactures\nand they are really, really\n\n337\n00:20:42.922 --> 00:20:47.740\ngood at creating that sense of urgency,\nthey're really good at creating the need.\n\n338\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.160\nI mean, I think of myself, okay,\nand I'm gonna hold my hands up.\n\n339\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.860\nAs soon as Apple decide that\nthey're launching something and\n\n340\n00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.190\nthey've got this keynote speech,\nI'm the first one.\n\n341\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.700\nI watch this and I think, my goodness.\n\n342\n00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.280\nI had a need that I didn't even\nknow I had, but now I've got it.\n\n343\n00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.870\nBy the time I've finished watching\nthe end of that keynote, then that's it.\n\n344\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.490\nI'm hooked, I'm there.\n\n345\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.874\nHook, line and sinker, I have the need.\n\n346\n00:21:12.874 --> 00:21:15.667\n&gt;&gt; Jo's sitting over here like,\ntake my money.\n\n347\n00:21:15.667 --> 00:21:17.457\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'm drooling,\n\n348\n00:21:17.457 --> 00:21:19.590\nI'm drooling at that point in time.\n\n349\n00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:23.434\nAnd so here I am, I'm falling for\n\n350\n00:21:23.434 --> 00:21:28.470\nthis because what they're really, really\ngood at is creating that sense of urgency.\n\n351\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.560\nThey've overcome any\nresistance that I may have.\n\n352\n00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.580\nAnd as soon as people that\nare a little bit pessimistic,\n\n353\n00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.300\nthere's always the one that's pessimistic\nsays, do you know how much that's cost?\n\n354\n00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:38.990\nI don't care.\n\n355\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.755\nI don't care.\nI'll take out of mortgage.\n\n356\n00:21:40.755 --> 00:21:43.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll do whatever I need to do\n\n357\n00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.800\nin order to get that piece of technology.\n\n358\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.480\nBecause what they're really good at,\nfor me, is creating a sense of urgency.\n\n359\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.620\nAnd you can only do that, and we've talked\nabout user personas before, you can only\n\n360\n00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:01.080\ndo that by understanding your users and by\nunderstanding what it is that they need.\n\n361\n00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:08.010\nAnd what we need to do is ensure that\nwe are creating that sense of urgency.\n\n362\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.760\nAnd you know, some organizations, and\n\n363\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.900\nI'll use Apple as an example,\nare great at actually creating a need.\n\n364\n00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.920\nThey don't just identify a need,\nthey create one.\n\n365\n00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.720\nAnd then we move through sort of\nforming a guiding coalition and\n\n366\n00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.898\nthen creating a vision and\nthen communicating that vision.\n\n367\n00:22:26.898 --> 00:22:28.380\nThat's that, you remember the vision,\n\n368\n00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.940\nthat's that elevated page\nthat we talked about?\n\n369\n00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n370\n00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.140\n&gt;&gt; And then empowering people.\n\n371\n00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.950\nAnd this is when we get into this\nagile environment because then they're\n\n372\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:43.570\nempowering people to actually embrace the\nchange and to effect the change as well.\n\n373\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.480\nWe're empowering people to do the work.\n\n374\n00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.222\nAnd then we're creating quick winds and\nthis is what agile does at its very best.\n\n375\n00:22:52.222 --> 00:22:57.340\nWe empower our developers to do that work.\n\n376\n00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.040\nAnd then we will create quick wins,\n\n377\n00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.090\nwe will deliver on an iterative basis,\nwe will deliver software.\n\n378\n00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.450\nQuick wins that we then build on,\nas it says there, build on change.\n\n379\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:16.260\nSo we make one release and\nthen we make another release and\n\n380\n00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.770\nthen we make another release.\n\n381\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.000\nAnd so with each iteration we're\nbuilding on that improvement,\n\n382\n00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.250\nwe're building on that change.\n\n383\n00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:29.370\nBut the key to all of this is obviously to\nwell, we like to say, embed the change.\n\n384\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.690\nMake it stick, in other words.\n\n385\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.820\nAnd we'll do that with any improvement and\nany change to our project.\n\n386\n00:23:38.775 --> 00:23:41.219\nCotter is all about these\nparticular eight steps.\n\n387\n00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:44.837\nThey're all about identifying\nsources of resistance and\n\n388\n00:23:44.837 --> 00:23:47.340\nfinding out what drives people.\n\n389\n00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.931\nFinding out what will fulfil that need.\n\n390\n00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:55.010\nWhat will fulfil that sense of urgency?\n\n391\n00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.790\nStep number one,\nwhat is it that these people want?\n\n392\n00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:04.858\nAnd if you understand who your resistance\nis, then you're able to overcome them.\n\n393\n00:24:04.858 --> 00:24:09.547\nEven though it's just a simple step,\nactually this is probably one of\n\n394\n00:24:09.547 --> 00:24:14.010\nthe best tools that I can give to\nany leader in any particular role.\n\n395\n00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.570\nWhether it's a product owner role or\nwhether it's any other role,\n\n396\n00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.980\nbecause that first step is really\njust about understanding your staff,\n\n397\n00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.490\nunderstanding what motivates them and\nthen appealing to that need.\n\n398\n00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.260\nI always talk about communicating\nwith people in their own language.\n\n399\n00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.282\nUnderstanding the language\nthat they speak and\n\n400\n00:24:31.282 --> 00:24:33.716\nmaking sure you communicate\nwith them in that language.\n\n401\n00:24:33.716 --> 00:24:38.980\nThat's part of the leadership that your\nproduct owner has got to be able to do.\n\n402\n00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.950\nWhich is why those roles like\nbusiness relationship management or\n\n403\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:49.080\nyour service desk roles, the roles\nthat communicate with the business\n\n404\n00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.570\nare already going to be very\ngood at communicating, period.\n\n405\n00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:58.550\nAnd therefore these are the roles that\nwould be really good at identifying what\n\n406\n00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:04.770\nthose senses of urgencies are and\nidentifying what drives individual people.\n\n407\n00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:09.500\nAnd that's what makes them really good and\na good fit for\n\n408\n00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.930\nthat type of product owner,\nservant, leadership role.\n\n409\n00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.570\nSo what we've done really in this\nsection is we've just taken a look at\n\n410\n00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.140\nthe sort of person that we need to be,\na product owner.\n\n411\n00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:27.520\nAnd that really concludes our\nseries on product ownership.\n\n412\n00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.550\nAnd I hope that you have\nenjoyed this particular series.\n\n413\n00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.391\nBut please be sure to come back, we do\nhave other series in our agile sort of,\n\n414\n00:25:36.391 --> 00:25:38.292\nwhat do we call it, library.\n\n415\n00:25:38.292 --> 00:25:39.230\n&gt;&gt; Library.\n&gt;&gt; Library!\n\n416\n00:25:39.230 -->
