[CROSSTALK].\n\n3\n00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.415\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.858\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome and\n\n5\n00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:16.790\nthank you joining us here\nat your Agile Roles series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.710\nSpecifically focusing in\non that product owner.\n\n7\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.820\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.460\nAnd today in studios we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock to bring an introduction and\n\n9\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.884\nreally get us started and\nset some ground level expectations for us.\n\n10\n00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:33.920\nSo how you doing to day, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.710\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing really well.\n\n12\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.580\nI've been with you in this\nAgile journey so far.\n\n13\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.110\nWe're taking a look at\nindividual roles and so\n\n14\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.370\nnow we're going to be\nlooking at our product owner.\n\n15\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.790\nAnd boy, you have made sure that I know\nthe difference between scrum master,\n\n16\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.340\na product owner, but I think we're gonna\nspend some time really defining that\n\n17\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.080\nin this show, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n18\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.330\nwe've looked at in our other series,\nwe've looked at fundamentals of Agile and,\n\n19\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.890\nby the way,\nwe're not gonna be covering that.\n\n20\n00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.130\nWe've also looked at Agile testing and\nAgile scrum master, and in\n\n21\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.200\nthis particular series, we're gonna look\nat the specific role of product owner.\n\n22\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.126\nAnd yeah, you're right, I know-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:14.402\n&gt;&gt; I've beaten you to death\n\n24\n00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:16.834\nwith the difference between\na product owner and\n\n25\n00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:17.980\na scrum master.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n26\n00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.340\nit's really important to be able to define\nand differentiate between those roles.\n\n27\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n28\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.000\nAnd so what we'll do is just like\nthe start of every single sort of Agile\n\n29\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.950\nseries.\n\n30\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.055\nThis particular episode, our first episode\nis just gonna be a very very quick recap\n\n31\n00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:34.455\nover the principles of Agile and\n\n32\n00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:38.775\nthe Agile manifesto, just to get everybody\nin the mood for the series without having\n\n33\n00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:41.485\nto go over into any of the other series.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n34\n00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:42.905\n&gt;&gt; Right now we're just going to do\n\n35\n00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:46.615\na really really quick sort of\nintroduction into what Agile is and\n\n36\n00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:51.230\nwhere it comes from,\nreally what the methodology is all about.\n\n37\n00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.030\nAnd then, in subsequent episodes,\n\n38\n00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.110\nwe're gonna be looking at the specific\nrole of the product owner, and\n\n39\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.950\nwhat the product owner has responsibility\nfor, and what the product owner doesn't\n\n40\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.100\nhave responsibility for, and\nwhat is the scrum master actually does.\n\n41\n00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.120\nI mean, you might think of these roles\nas being sort of, well, fairly flexible.\n\n42\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.659\nThat's exactly what Agile is all about it,\nit's about flexibility, but\n\n43\n00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.490\nwe do have some defined\nresponsibilities within these roles.\n\n44\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.970\nIn other words, we have to know who to go\nto if we've got a query about something.\n\n45\n00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.510\nAnd so\nthat's what we're gonna be covering.\n\n46\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.660\nWe've got a couple of series,\none on product owners, as I said, and\n\n47\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.560\nwe've got the one on scrum master as well\nwhere we'll just be looking at those\n\n48\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160\nresponsibilities.\n&gt;&gt; You know, Joe, I had to do a little\n\n49\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.870\nbit more research after you left when we\nconcluded that last series that we had\n\n50\n00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.290\ntalked about, the Agile fundamentals.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n51\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.660\n&gt;&gt; I was curious, I'm like okay, so\n\n52\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.450\nyou had said look,\nthis is a manifesto for Agile\n\n53\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.670\nthat was created by these individuals,\nI had to do a little research.\n\n54\n00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.625\nAnd I thought that is so cool,\nlike 17 people just getting together to\n\n55\n00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:57.885\ncome up with these ideas, and\nthen people actually listen to them.\n\n56\n00:02:57.885 --> 00:03:02.050\nSo I'm working on, Jo, maybe we can\ncome up with something in the future,\n\n57\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.200\nlike sit in the mountains like in Utah,\nor maybe even Colorado.\n\n58\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Can we not do Hawaii?\n\n59\n00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:09.124\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Hawaii.\n\n60\n00:03:09.124 --> 00:03:13.584\nAnd we're going to come up with\nsome great, wonderful thing.\n\n61\n00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:14.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yea, well,\n\n62\n00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.734\nthis is not the first time\nthat this has happened either,\n\n63\n00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:21.870\nthis is one of the ways that we actually\ncome up with our methodologies in IT.\n\n64\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.359\nAnd in terms of IT governance,\nwe've got methodologies such as VeriSM,\n\n65\n00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.636\nwhich is a methodology\nlooking at expanding\n\n66\n00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:35.430\nservice management into\nthe wider ranging organization.\n\n67\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.353\nWe've got methodologies such as ITIL,\nnow, ITIL again,\n\n68\n00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:43.990\nvery similar to Agile, ITIL didn't\ncome from one particular place.\n\n69\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.230\nThat came from a group of academics\ngetting together, producing white papers.\n\n70\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.640\nAnd I always say, and\nI had this conversation just a little\n\n71\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.970\nwhile ago before we started this episode,\nthis is just common sense written down.\n\n72\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.363\nEverything that we talk about,\nand this type of governance,\n\n73\n00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:06.423\nthis governance sort of arena,\nit's all common sense.\n\n74\n00:04:06.423 --> 00:04:11.387\nBut you'll be surprised how much of it we\ndon't apply, or how much of it we don't\n\n75\n00:04:11.387 --> 00:04:15.986\nthink about because we're too busy\nthinking in the depths of the code, and\n\n76\n00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:20.001\nwe don't actually think about\nthe governance of our services and\n\n77\n00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:21.860\nhow we deliver our services.\n\n78\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.710\nSo yeah, we could come up with something.\n\n79\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.740\nAnd Hawaii sounds fantastic to me.\n\n80\n00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.201\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n81\n00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.083\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now Jo, what are some\n\n82\n00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:30.740\nof the methodologies that we'll\nsee being utilized here in Agile?\n\n83\n00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, the first thing that we gotta\n\n84\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.950\nremember is that Agile is not\nactually a methodology in itself.\n\n85\n00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.034\nAgile is not a single approach, it's\na group of methodologies, it's really,\n\n86\n00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:46.770\nreally sort of a pragmatic,\nwhat it says there, pragmatic mindset.\n\n87\n00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.990\nIt's all about a flexible\napproach to problem, to problem,\n\n88\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.070\nto project management,\neven not to problem management, and\n\n89\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.640\nyou'll see here we've got\na group of methodologies there.\n\n90\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.450\nAnd this is not a definitive list.\n&gt;&gt; Comprehensive list-\n\n91\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are lots and\n\n92\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.470\nlots of other methodologies that\nmay land themselves into Agile.\n\n93\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.720\nAgile basically means, well,\npretty much what it says, that it's agile,\n\n94\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.200\nit's flexible.\n\n95\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.360\nAnd it's really about delivering\nproduct in a continuous,\n\n96\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.230\ncontinual manner, that's what it's about.\n\n97\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.610\nIt's not a waterfall approach.\n\n98\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.972\nIf it was traditional waterfall\napproach to product delivery and\n\n99\n00:05:29.972 --> 00:05:35.440\nto project managements, then we have a set\ntime period, which is in our generally\n\n100\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.067\nsomewhere from six months to two, three\nyears even, I've seen projects last for,\n\n101\n00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:46.780\nwhere we start off at the beginning with\ndefining what it is that our users want.\n\n102\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.640\nAnd then we go through the entire build,\nand we go through the entire build in\n\n103\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.059\na very chronological way, and\nthen we start to, as we've developed,\n\n104\n00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:02.155\nwe then test, and then once we've tested,\nthen we deploy, and then once we deploy,\n\n105\n00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:07.935\nwe have a period of hand holding, and\nthen we walk away as a project team.\n\n106\n00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:09.881\nAnd that's it, that project is signed off.\n\n107\n00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:16.670\nWell, waterfall approach works very very\nwell for very large implementations,\n\n108\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.940\nbut you see, right at the very beginning\nis when we have that user interaction, and\n\n109\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.297\nthen they see nothing\npotentially until very end.\n\n110\n00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.830\nSo Agile looks at this slightly\ndifferently, and Agile will say well,\n\n111\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.860\nokay, we've got to build up momentum,\nwe've got to allow for\n\n112\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.920\nchange, which is something that waterfall\nprojects traditionally don't, and\n\n113\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.810\nwe've got to be visible.\n\n114\n00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.710\nBecause we've got to deliver\nvisible benefits, but\n\n115\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.320\nwe've got to deliver\nbenefits on a regular basis.\n\n116\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.150\nAnd the one thing that we\nknow is that things change.\n\n117\n00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.620\nI mean, if we started off,\ncan you imagine, just a complete aside,\n\n118\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.270\ncan you imagine if you've got a cell phone\nand then you had to wait three years\n\n119\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.775\npotentially for your next cell phone?\n&gt;&gt; Can I imagine it?\n\n120\n00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:01.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.380\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n122\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.280\nI try to get as much as\nI can out of my phones.\n\n123\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.781\nBut I'm probably an exception,\nI'm a little cheap when it comes to those.\n\n124\n00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.701\n&gt;&gt; Well, look, but okay..\n\n125\n00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:11.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.500\n&gt;&gt; You can be cheap when it comes to\n\n127\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.390\nthose, I can tell you now, right, by the\ntime the next one is announced next year,\n\n128\n00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.391\nI'm there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:19.345\n&gt;&gt; I am there!\n\n130\n00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:21.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, then I know who to come to.\n\n131\n00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.905\nI'll buy all your old phones.\n\n132\n00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:24.390\nHow about that, Jo?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n133\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.420\nImpatience, that's what this is,\nit's just complete impatience..\n\n134\n00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.640\nBut I'm hungry for the latest technology.\n\n135\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.220\nI'm hungry for new things,\nI want new features.\n\n136\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.940\nAnd I'm not the only one, by the way.\n&gt;&gt; I know, like I said,\n\n137\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.255\nI think here, in our environment I'm\nthe exception to that and that's because-\n\n138\n00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n139\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.060\n&gt;&gt; My budget, really.\n\n140\n00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.890\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'm not the only one,\n\n141\n00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.780\nokay?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna walk out of this studio\n\n143\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.399\nand ask everybody right now, and\nI'll tell you who's trying to.\n\n144\n00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:54.541\nYeah, I'm always hungry for\nnew technology.\n\n145\n00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:58.561\nAnd so are our users as well,\nand so is our organization.\n\n146\n00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:03.391\nAnd it's true to say, and I know that this\nis gonna sound a bit like a story sort of\n\n147\n00:08:03.391 --> 00:08:08.011\nthing, but it's true to say that Over\nthe past few years the rate of technology\n\n148\n00:08:08.011 --> 00:08:12.090\nchange, well, it's become more rapid,\nit has increased.\n\n149\n00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.669\nAnd so our organizations\nexpect more functionality, and\n\n150\n00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:19.917\nthey expect functionality to be\navailable to them when they want it.\n\n151\n00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:23.720\nAnd they expect it to be available now,\nnot in three years time.\n\n152\n00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.070\nIn three years time, or\nin two years time, even.\n\n153\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.530\nMy needs changed.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n154\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.400\nit's Moore's law.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n155\n00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.780\n&gt;&gt; And we've exceeded his predictions\n\n156\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.962\nyears ago.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n157\n00:08:34.962 --> 00:08:36.642\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:08:36.642 --> 00:08:39.100\n&gt;&gt; Agile allows for that, and\n\n159\n00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.050\nthat's why we have agile as an approach\nto project management, because with that\n\n160\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:50.300\ncontinuous delivery, then what we're\ndoing is we are delivering features.\n\n161\n00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.540\nSo we're giving our users what they\nwant in that point in time, but\n\n162\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.750\nalso we're allowing them to say, okay,\nI like that, but can I have it this way?\n\n163\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.240\nAnd when you think about\nthe way we get our cellphones,\n\n164\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:09.010\nthe way that for instance,\nthat's exactly how we do this now.\n\n165\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.940\nWe update our operating systems.\n\n166\n00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.975\nAnd we update our app.\n\n167\n00:09:11.975 --> 00:09:14.070\nSo probably a monthly basis.\n\n168\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.120\nAnd we expect to seeing new\nfunctionality when we do that.\n\n169\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.760\nAnd that's an Agile approach.\n\n170\n00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.840\nSo Agile is really sort of pragmatic.\n\n171\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.590\nAnd by pragmatic, I mean,\nit's kind of matter of fact.\n\n172\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.460\nIt's very, it's common sense.\n\n173\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.806\nAnd we just have to accept\nthe fact that things change.\n\n174\n00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:34.860\nAnd so we've got to adapt to that.\n\n175\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.490\nAnd we've got to be able\nto accommodate change.\n\n176\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.430\nWe've got to be able to accommodate\nchanging customer desires, and\n\n177\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.220\nchanging customer needs as well.\n\n178\n00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.080\nWhich is why we have to have\nthat flexible approach.\n\n179\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.980\nIt now is by all the reasons\nwe've just talked about.\n\n180\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.900\nIt's difficult to predict what a\ncustomer's going to want in a year's time.\n\n181\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.941\nThey don't have a year to wait.\n\n182\n00:09:57.941 --> 00:10:01.516\nSo we have to have what we\ncall a flexible approach\n\n183\n00:10:01.516 --> 00:10:06.280\nthat allows us to adapt as we learn or\nrather adapt as we grow.\n\n184\n00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.837\nAnd adapt as we move through\nthe project progresses.\n\n185\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.840\nNow, I also wanna bring into\nthe bottom bullet point there that\n\n186\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.950\nI've just mentioned\nabout self-organization.\n\n187\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.870\nWe talk about collaboration a lot in\nAgile, and self-organization is really,\n\n188\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.930\nreally key.\n\n189\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.202\nBecause self-organization is\nabout that collaboration,\n\n190\n00:10:27.202 --> 00:10:29.389\nit's about the team working together.\n\n191\n00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:32.088\nIt's not having a strict hierarchy and\n\n192\n00:10:32.088 --> 00:10:35.456\nit's also not being micro-managed,\nas well.\n\n193\n00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:38.160\nPeople don't perform well when\nthey're being micro-managed.\n\n194\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.910\nIf I've got somebody over\nmy shoulder the whole time.\n\n195\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.600\nAnd watching everything that I do,\nI'm not gonna perform particularly well.\n\n196\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.720\nBecause I'm gonna spend too much time\nworrying about what's being thought of me,\n\n197\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.060\nand-\n&gt;&gt; Right, and personally, I feel like for\n\n198\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.300\nme, and I feel like I've observed\nthis in numerous situations,\n\n199\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.610\nwhere the person that's not micromanaged.\n\n200\n00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.100\nIs going to give a little more.\n\n201\n00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.740\nA little bit extra than what they,\nif they have that freedom.\n\n202\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.630\nThan if they were micro managed.\n&gt;&gt; I want to bring\n\n203\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.190\ninto this conversation actually\nthe working from home.\n\n204\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.920\nThere's a big.\n\n205\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.852\nAnd this by the way,\nis kind of outside of Agile.\n\n206\n00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:19.606\nI'm gonna talk about\nthis in a little while.\n\n207\n00:11:19.606 --> 00:11:23.649\nWe'll talk about in another episode we'll\ntalk about teams and their location.\n\n208\n00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:29.710\nBut there is a misconception that working\nfrom home people actually do less.\n\n209\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.950\nWell guess what, people actually do\nmore when they're working from home.\n\n210\n00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:38.310\nWhen you're working in your office,\nyou come in and you will, you'll\n\n211\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.460\nit's almost like be in micromanage you\ncome in and you come in maybe 08:30 AM and\n\n212\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.670\nyou leave at 1630 or 1700 and\nyou do your day's work.\n\n213\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.570\nWhen you're working from home, sure,\nyou might take five minutes to go and put\n\n214\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.640\nthe washing machine on or to go and grab\nyourself some toast or make a cup tea.\n\n215\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.112\nI have been in the studio and\nthat okay [LAUGH].\n\n216\n00:11:59.112 --> 00:12:02.899\nAll right, you might grab five\nminutes here and there to do that.\n\n217\n00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:04.498\nBut when you are working from home and\n\n218\n00:12:04.498 --> 00:12:08.380\nyou hate your laptop because of the emails\nyou go and you will seat on your laptop.\n\n219\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.900\nAnd it doesn't matter what time of day or\nnight that is.\n\n220\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.930\nAnd I wonder,\nI know I am guilty of this as well.\n\n221\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.130\nI'll be sitting in front of the TV\non a night, checking my emails and\n\n222\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.870\nthings like that.\n\n223\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.670\nSo you're actually more productive\n\n224\n00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.330\nworking from home than you are when\nyou're in the office being micro managed.\n\n225\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.070\nAnd this is why we talk\nabout self-organization.\n\n226\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.750\nYou don't have to work between\nthe hours of eight and 1700.\n\n227\n00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.910\nYou work between the hours that\neverybody else in the team is working.\n\n228\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.390\nAnd if everyone else in the team, you\nknow, is decided that they want to have\n\n229\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.230\na meeting at 9:00 PM at night and that's\na good time for everybody then why not?\n\n230\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.140\nWe talk about self-organization and\nalso that collaboration means that we\n\n231\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.470\nunderstand where different\nskills lay as well.\n\n232\n00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.350\nYour skills are way more\ntechnical than my skills.\n\n233\n00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.853\nMy technical skills are in the dim and\ndistant past.\n\n234\n00:13:03.853 --> 00:13:08.869\nAnd so if I had something that was\nspecifically technical in an arena\n\n235\n00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:15.070\nthat you outperformed in, then I would\nask you if you would help with that.\n\n236\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.810\nBut in the same light, you know, and\n\n237\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.080\nhoping that you'd come to me if it was\nsomething else to do with governance or\n\n238\n00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.510\nstrategies or maybe something.\n&gt;&gt; Interpersonal skills\n\n239\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.920\nto help with my awkwardness.\n\n240\n00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.480\nBe like Joe what do you think?\n&gt;&gt; You know-\n\n241\n00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.500\n&gt;&gt; Should I leave the review?\n\n242\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.880\nThe five star review?\n\n243\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.190\nBe honest.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, I would.\n\n244\n00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.008\nI just need to inject a bit of Britishness\nthere, that's all it needs, right?\n\n245\n00:13:37.008 --> 00:13:41.340\nSay it as it is [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; You know, but I've had this discussion\n\n246\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.471\nwith people before Joe, and I do think\nthat it's perfect for some people, but\n\n247\n00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:49.287\nthere are those people that I even\nknow personally that they say, look,\n\n248\n00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:52.252\nI don't have the self discipline,\nI kind of need that.\n\n249\n00:13:52.252 --> 00:13:56.349\nSo I think also you have to be honest with\nyourself when your thinking about this\n\n250\n00:13:56.349 --> 00:13:57.630\ntoo.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n251\n00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.328\nI mean some people,\nif they're left to organize themselves,\n\n252\n00:14:01.328 --> 00:14:03.718\nyou'll find that they'll do nothing.\n\n253\n00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:07.140\nAnd you'll get others in the team\nthat will do all of the work.\n\n254\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.370\nYes, there has to be somebody, but\nthen that's why we have a scrum master.\n\n255\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.430\nThat is exactly what\nthe scrum masters role it is.\n\n256\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.670\nTo make sure even though,\n\n257\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.530\nyou are kind of left to your own devices,\nthe work is still being produced and\n\n258\n00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.520\nthat is exactly why we still have\npeople though in a leadership role.\n\n259\n00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.080\nBut these\n\n260\n00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.820\npeople shouldn't be micromanaging.\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n261\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.578\n&gt;&gt; So let's just\n\n262\n00:14:28.578 --> 00:14:30.730\ntake a quick recap then if that's okay.\n\n263\n00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.280\nOver the Agile Manifesto and\njust really what that means and\n\n264\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.690\nwhat it is that we are working towards?\n\n265\n00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.680\nThe Agile Manifesto,\nI like to call them ethics.\n\n266\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.237\nWe officially call them values,\nbut I like to call them ethics.\n\n267\n00:14:45.237 --> 00:14:51.240\nAnd it really is just looking at\nwhere we're focusing our efforts.\n\n268\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.720\nWhere we're focusing, or\nwhere we put value, really.\n\n269\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.610\nAnd we put value over individuals,\ninteractions, over processes and tools.\n\n270\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.380\nNow forget the myth that in Agile we\ndon't have any processes, because we do.\n\n271\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:11.070\nBut that processes should be efficient,\nand they should also be flexible as well.\n\n272\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:15.990\nWhen we bring in a tool,\nthe tool should facilitate the process.\n\n273\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.740\nYou don't change your process\nto accommodate your tool.\n\n274\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.630\nAgain, something that I see all the time.\n\n275\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.410\nWe're all aboard on this tool, and\nthis tool's gonna fix everything.\n\n276\n00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.240\nNo, it's not, absolutely not.\n\n277\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.840\nThe tool has to be able to deliver\nthe process that you want it to deliver.\n\n278\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.090\nYou have to buy a tool in order to\nuse it as that particular tool.\n\n279\n00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.930\nYou wouldn't buy a rubber hammer or\n\n280\n00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.190\na mallet to knock a nail into the wall,\nright?\n\n281\n00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.770\nYou have to work out what you\nwant first and then you go and\n\n282\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.760\nbuy the appropriate tool.\n\n283\n00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.075\nYou don't go buy the tool and think, well\nokay, now I need to find some rubber nails\n\n284\n00:15:57.075 --> 00:15:59.470\ncuz it's the only thing that's\ngonna knock you to the wall, right?\n\n285\n00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.064\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:16:00.064 --> 00:16:01.843\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n287\n00:16:01.843 --> 00:16:02.851\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n288\n00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:07.340\nI'm corporal when it comes to, I feel\nlike I've seen a rubber hammer before but\n\n289\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.086\nit might be for like precious.\n\n290\n00:16:09.086 --> 00:16:10.507\nSurfaces.\n\n291\n00:16:10.507 --> 00:16:11.083\n&gt;&gt; Mallet.\n\n292\n00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:12.136\n&gt;&gt; Mallet?\n&gt;&gt; Camping.\n\n293\n00:16:12.136 --> 00:16:12.712\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n294\n00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:14.017\n&gt;&gt; Camping, hammering pegs into\n\n295\n00:16:14.017 --> 00:16:15.400\nthe ground.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n296\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.732\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] been camping, clearly.\n\n297\n00:16:17.732 --> 00:16:20.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've been camping but\n\n298\n00:16:20.075 --> 00:16:22.396\nI prefer to glamp now.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n299\n00:16:22.396 --> 00:16:26.845\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why doesn't that surprise me?\n\n300\n00:16:26.845 --> 00:16:28.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:29.479\n&gt;&gt; Any who.\n\n302\n00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:30.695\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n303\n00:16:30.695 --> 00:16:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Product owner, Agile.\n\n304\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n305\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.310\nSo, tools.\n\n306\n00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.710\nBuy the right tools for the job.\n\n307\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:36.816\nAnd if you're glamping,\n\n308\n00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:38.274\njust forget it really.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:16:38.274 --> 00:16:40.034\n&gt;&gt; You don't need anything at\n\n310\n00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:42.440\nthat point in time [LAUGH].\n\n311\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.843\nOur processes have to be efficient.\n\n312\n00:16:46.843 --> 00:16:50.690\nThat's not to say we don't want them,\nthey just have to be efficient.\n\n313\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.180\nBut we value individuals,\n\n314\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.300\nwe value the way that they work,\nover our processes and over those tools.\n\n315\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.440\nBecause sometimes we just end up with the\nwrong tools and that's not what we want.\n\n316\n00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.410\nSo value people, value their skills,\nvalue their interactions.\n\n317\n00:17:09.348 --> 00:17:12.770\nAnd we're focusing on efficiency here,\n\n318\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:18.960\nI don't want you to spend your\nentire day filling out paperwork.\n\n319\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.910\nWhat I want you to do is to be productive\nfor your entire day, and filling out\n\n320\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.770\npaperwork and documentation does not\nmean that you're a productive person\n\n321\n00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.220\nbecause you're going to be developing\nnothing over that period in time.\n\n322\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.870\nYou're just going to be\nfilling out paperwork.\n\n323\n00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.070\nAnd again, let's look at the next one,\n\n324\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.350\nworking software over\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n325\n00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.360\nIt's not that we don't want documentation,\nbut we want to keep it simple, and\n\n326\n00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.970\nwe want to keep it relevant.\n\n327\n00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:46.180\nWe are the worst in IT at producing\ndocumentation, just for the sake of\n\n328\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.660\ndocumentation, just because we can and\nthat's not what we do in here in Agile.\n\n329\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:58.575\nNow, I like this one as well,\nthis one really hammers it home.\n\n330\n00:17:58.575 --> 00:18:03.252\nHow many times have you taken a look\nat a contract or an agreement, and\n\n331\n00:18:03.252 --> 00:18:08.589\nsaid well it's not in that agreement,\nso I'm not going to do that, right?\n\n332\n00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:13.800\nWe value customer collaboration\nover contract negotiation.\n\n333\n00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.170\nIt's not about what's\nwritten on a piece of paper,\n\n334\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.000\nit's about having a relationship\nwith your customer.\n\n335\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.780\nI don't care what's written in that piece\nof paper, what I actually want is for\n\n336\n00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.660\nus to be able to work together as a team.\n\n337\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.730\nNow, Cherokee, you had a situation quite\nrecently, where you were expecting\n\n338\n00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.430\nsomething to be delivered, and\nit says in the piece of paper,\n\n339\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.820\nright, well, it's going to be\ndelivered between this time and\n\n340\n00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.900\nsomebody's going to call you at this time.\n\n341\n00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.330\nAnd this is exactly what's in\nthe contract, but at the end of the day\n\n342\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.210\nwhat's in the contract doesn't\ndeliver good customer service,\n\n343\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.300\nit doesn't deliver a good product.\n\n344\n00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.800\nIt's the attitude,\n\n345\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.110\nit is the performance of the person\nwhen they eventually get there.\n\n346\n00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.070\nIt is how helpful they are, and\n\n347\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.510\nhow willing they are to work with you and\nyour schedules.\n\n348\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.563\nThat's what delivers value.\n\n349\n00:19:04.563 --> 00:19:08.220\nIt's not what's written in the contract\nthat delivers value, right?\n\n350\n00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.938\nSo again we'll always say build\na relationship with your customer and\n\n351\n00:19:11.938 --> 00:19:14.340\nbuild a relationship with your colleagues.\n\n352\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.220\nThat's most more valuable than\nhaving something written down.\n\n353\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.670\nIf you have something written down and\nyou're sticking to it rigidly then you\n\n354\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.070\nare not gonna be the only person\nwho is sticking to it rigidly and\n\n355\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.100\nthere is no flexibility there at all.\n\n356\n00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.740\nAnd then responding to change\nover following a plan.\n\n357\n00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:39.570\nWe value responding to change more than\nthe plan itself, because change happens.\n\n358\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.160\nAnd a plan is only ever as\ngood as the next few hours, or\n\n359\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.890\nmaybe the next few weeks.\n\n360\n00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.520\nBecause our circumstances change.\n\n361\n00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.960\nI've already mentioned,\nwe're in the 21st century now.\n\n362\n00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.410\nAnd things change in the 21st\ncentury very, very quickly.\n\n363\n00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.840\nAnd we've gotta be able\nto accommodate that.\n\n364\n00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:02.136\nSo these values were based on our\nAgile Manifesto, or our principles rather.\n\n365\n00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:06.278\nThe values of the manifesto,\nthese were based on our principles.\n\n366\n00:20:06.278 --> 00:20:10.980\nAnd we spent a lot of time going over\nthese in our fundamental series so\n\n367\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.520\nI really just wanna really just\nhighlight these to you right now and\n\n368\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.700\nI just wanna highlight what's in\npurple right now, if you want to\n\n369\n00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.320\nunderstand a little bit more,\ntake a look at our fundamental series.\n\n370\n00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.370\nBut we're looking at satisfying\nthe customer, we're looking at changing\n\n371\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.980\nrequirements, adapting to change, and\ndelivering software on an iterative basis.\n\n372\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.120\nA repeatable basis, frequently.\n\n373\n00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.600\nWe're looking at collaboration, working\ntogether, and we want people motivated.\n\n374\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.120\nAnd that's another reason why you\ndon't want to stick to contracts.\n\n375\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.471\nYou don't want to have to micro-manage.\n\n376\n00:20:44.471 --> 00:20:46.896\nBecause if you're micro-managing them and\n\n377\n00:20:46.896 --> 00:20:50.992\nyou're making them stick to contracts\nthey're not going to be motivated.\n\n378\n00:20:50.992 --> 00:20:54.145\nAnd they're certainly\nnot gonna give you 100%.\n\n379\n00:20:54.145 --> 00:20:59.080\nI like the bottom one,\nface to face conversation.\n\n380\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.160\nIt goes back to we don't want\nthe comprehensive documentation.\n\n381\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.240\nDocumentation's gotta be relavant,\nbut it's got to be clear, concise and\n\n382\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.630\nunambiguous.\n\n383\n00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:09.960\nBut you know what?\n\n384\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.530\nI perceive more value in\na face to face conversation.\n\n385\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.660\nI can get more out of you in\na face to face conversation\n\n386\n00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.500\nbecause I see your body language,\nI understand what you're thinking.\n\n387\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.834\nWell, maybe not, all right.\n&gt;&gt; I might not be the best candidate for\n\n388\n00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:25.364\nthis.\n\n389\n00:21:25.364 --> 00:21:27.542\n[LAUGH] Poor Jo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:31.550\nOkay, maybe I don't quite understand, but\nI get to see your body language right?\n\n391\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.380\nAnd I get to sort of follow\nalong with where you're going.\n\n392\n00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.900\nFace to face conversation delivers\nmore results than a string of emails.\n\n393\n00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.452\nThat email tennis that sometimes play\nwith the backwards and forwards and\n\n394\n00:21:45.452 --> 00:21:51.330\nit's please no, pick up the phone or\nlet's have a face to face conversation.\n\n395\n00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:55.528\nIn ITIL terms, not Agile, in ITIL terms,\n\n396\n00:21:55.528 --> 00:21:59.971\nI refer to it as getting off your bum,\nright?\n\n397\n00:21:59.971 --> 00:22:02.490\nSo get off your bum, go and\nsee what's happening.\n\n398\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.800\nThey call it observing directly but\nI like to say just get off your bum.\n\n399\n00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:11.010\nGo see, you'll achieve a lot\nmore by doing it that way.\n\n400\n00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:15.640\nAnd then working software,\nworking software is what we want, and\n\n401\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.330\nwe want sustainable development.\n\n402\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:23.730\nSo what we want to achieve is development\nthat is sustained over a period of time.\n\n403\n00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.900\nWhat we don't want is development here,\nand then nothing for\n\n404\n00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.630\nanother six months, and\nthen it all goes quiet again, and\n\n405\n00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.750\nthen maybe four months later\nwe'll deliver something.\n\n406\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.420\nWe want sustainable development.\n\n407\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.218\nWe want technical excellence and\nwe want good design.\n\n408\n00:22:41.218 --> 00:22:44.271\nIf you get it right in\nthe first place and, in fact,\n\n409\n00:22:44.271 --> 00:22:48.764\njust before our episode today I was\ntalking about this with Zach actually.\n\n410\n00:22:48.764 --> 00:22:53.790\nIf you get it right in the first place,\nthen you don't have to make changes.\n\n411\n00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:59.330\nWe've had in previous series, where we've\nlooked at sort of both Agile and ITIL,\n\n412\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.060\nwe've talked about the question about how\ndo you know if somebody's color blind?\n\n413\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.770\nOkay, all right, I know you're thinking to\nyourself, what's that got to do with it?\n\n414\n00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.690\nIf we're designing a service, you have\nto understand who your user is, and\n\n415\n00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.350\nwe'll come into that in\nan episode a little bit later.\n\n416\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.550\nBut you have to understand\nwho your user is.\n\n417\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.240\nIf you don't know who your user is and\nyou don't know how they work,\n\n418\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.890\nthen how can you ensure that you design\na service that fits their needs?\n\n419\n00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.470\nWhat you'll do is you'll\ndesign what you think is good,\n\n420\n00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.850\nbut then it won't deliver quality.\n\n421\n00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.961\nIt won't be a good design.\n\n422\n00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:39.810\nYou have to get to know your user first.\n\n423\n00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:44.175\nAnd you deliver, in number ten,\nwhat you need to deliver.\n\n424\n00:23:44.175 --> 00:23:51.060\nNothing else talks about\nmaximizing the work not done.\n\n425\n00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.711\nStop trying to over-deliver and just\nremember that anything that you deliver\n\n426\n00:23:55.711 --> 00:24:00.225\nover and above what you promised is\nprobably superfluous to requirements.\n\n427\n00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:03.860\nIt's probably not gonna get used and\nit's a wasted effort.\n\n428\n00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.277\nAnd we've already talk about\nself-organizing teams.\n\n429\n00:24:07.277 --> 00:24:11.428\nAnd I also want to bring in number\n12 there about team reflection, and\n\n430\n00:24:11.428 --> 00:24:14.487\nabout getting the team\ntogether on a regular basis.\n\n431\n00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:18.318\nWe'll talk about daily stand ups\na little bit later in another episode.\n\n432\n00:24:18.318 --> 00:24:24.342\nBut having our team look back at the end\nof the day on how things have handout and\n\n433\n00:24:24.342 --> 00:24:27.039\nwhat's actually being achieve.\n\n434\n00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:30.819\nAnd then what we could\ndo better next time.\n\n435\n00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:36.787\nSo as 3 pillars of Agile and again,\ngo back to fundamentals series and\n\n436\n00:24:36.787 --> 00:24:40.745\nyou'll find that this\nbeen explained to you.\n\n437\n00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:45.854\nAs 3 pillars of Agile\ntransparency inspection and\n\n438\n00:24:45.854 --> 00:24:51.808\nadaptation, you get what you\ninspect not what you expect.\n\n439\n00:24:51.808 --> 00:24:55.034\nGo and see it goes back again\nto getting off your bum and\n\n440\n00:24:55.034 --> 00:24:57.053\ngoing to see what's happening.\n\n441\n00:24:57.053 --> 00:24:59.977\nAnd so\nwe wanna ensure that we are transparent,\n\n442\n00:24:59.977 --> 00:25:03.130\nthat our entire development\nteam is transparent.\n\n443\n00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.757\nNow from a product owner's\nperspective that's very important.\n\n444\n00:25:06.757 --> 00:25:10.501\nBecause the product owner is the person\nthat is responsible for the product.\n\n445\n00:25:10.501 --> 00:25:14.591\nAnd so therefore they have got to\nmake sure that the team is actually\n\n446\n00:25:14.591 --> 00:25:17.965\ndelivering what they're\nsupposed to be delivering.\n\n447\n00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:23.191\nAnd so transparency is really important\nfor a product manager, product owner.\n\n448\n00:25:23.191 --> 00:25:27.298\nBecause the product owner has go to\nsee what is being developed, and\n\n449\n00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:29.904\nhas got to make adjustments if necessary.\n\n450\n00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:33.405\nBear it in mind that with each iteration,\n\n451\n00:25:33.405 --> 00:25:37.720\nwith each sprint you've\nonly got up to four weeks.\n\n452\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.242\nThere's some Agile myths here and\nwe've already really covered those,\n\n453\n00:25:41.242 --> 00:25:45.121\nabout Agile doesn't require documentation\nand it doesn't require planning.\n\n454\n00:25:45.121 --> 00:25:49.226\nYes it does, just keep it simple.\n\n455\n00:25:49.226 --> 00:25:53.358\nUser stories, we're going to get into\nuser stories in a later episode but no,\n\n456\n00:25:53.358 --> 00:25:55.375\nthis shouldn't all be the same size.\n\n457\n00:25:55.375 --> 00:25:59.697\nEvery single user story is going to\nbe different and it should be unique.\n\n458\n00:25:59.697 --> 00:26:03.842\nWhich means that every single sprint\nis going to be a different length.\n\n459\n00:26:03.842 --> 00:26:08.516\nWe say between one and four weeks for\nevery single sprint but\n\n460\n00:26:08.516 --> 00:26:12.455\nit could be one week and\nit could be for one sprint.\n\n461\n00:26:12.455 --> 00:26:17.126\nAnd the next one could be four weeks, and\nthen the next one could be two weeks.\n\n462\n00:26:17.126 --> 00:26:19.449\nThat's down to the scrum master to manage,\nbut\n\n463\n00:26:19.449 --> 00:26:22.886\nthe product owner's the person that\ndecides what goes in the sprint.\n\n464\n00:26:22.886 --> 00:26:26.036\nAll we know is,\nthat whatever goes in the sprint,\n\n465\n00:26:26.036 --> 00:26:29.647\nwe've gotta be able to achieve\nthat in that time period.\n\n466\n00:26:29.647 --> 00:26:33.737\nWhatever the time period is,\nit's got to be achievable.\n\n467\n00:26:33.737 --> 00:26:38.349\nAnd here on this particular\nslide you've got an overview of\n\n468\n00:26:38.349 --> 00:26:40.386\nan actual sprint itself.\n\n469\n00:26:40.386 --> 00:26:46.168\nAnd you will see that the product owner is\nthe person that prioritizes the backlog,\n\n470\n00:26:46.168 --> 00:26:47.167\nthen we plan.\n\n471\n00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:50.211\nAnd the team then actually starts\nto do the development work.\n\n472\n00:26:50.211 --> 00:26:53.231\nAnd every day we have\nour daily scrum meeting.\n\n473\n00:26:53.231 --> 00:26:56.893\nAnd we also at the end of\nthe sprint well we'll do a review.\n\n474\n00:26:56.893 --> 00:27:02.030\nAnd we'll complete the sprint itself and\nthen we will either release at\n\n475\n00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:07.602\nthat point in time or we'll not we'll\nshelve that until the actual release.\n\n476\n00:27:07.602 --> 00:27:11.039\nAnd we do the retrospective,\nwe look back and we see what's gone wrong.\n\n477\n00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:14.799\nAnd when right and\nwe apply that to our next point.\n\n478\n00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:19.665\nSo in out next episodes then what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to expand\n\n479\n00:27:19.665 --> 00:27:20.990\nthose activities.\n\n480\n00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.673\nThe activities of the product\nowner actually completes and\n\n481\n00:27:24.673 --> 00:27:26.742\nthat they're responsible for.\n\n482\n00:27:26.742 --> 00:27:29.953\nAnd hopefully we'll see you\nback in the next episode.\n\n483\n00:27:29.953 --> 00:27:31.653\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you for that overview and\n\n484\n00:27:31.653 --> 00:27:34.963\nintroduction into our series here Jo,\nand thank you for joining us as well.\n\n485\n00:27:34.963 --> 00:27:38.127\nBut for now we'll
