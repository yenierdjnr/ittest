your Agile testing series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:16.850\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.250\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at an intro to Agile.\n\n9\n00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.760\nAnd with us today in studios we have Mrs.\nJo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.040\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.960\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n12\n00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.680\nThank you, Cherokee, how are you?\n\n13\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful, Jo.\n\n14\n00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.570\nWe're just starting this new series, so\nthat's always an exciting time for me.\n\n15\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.143\nAnd then really, I've gotta ask you\nthe question I ask you all the time, Jo.\n\n16\n00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:36.177\nWhere are we starting?\n\n17\n00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:38.700\nWhat will we be looking at\nin this particular show?\n\n18\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.304\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were going\nto ask me why am I here.\n\n19\n00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:43.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the question she normally\n\n20\n00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:44.055\nasks me.\n\n21\n00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:45.543\n&gt;&gt; What are you doing here again?\n\n22\n00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:47.102\n&gt;&gt; What are you doing here?\n\n23\n00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:51.780\n[LAUGH] Right, well, as you've already\nsaid, this is a brand new series.\n\n24\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.230\nAnd in this particular series,\nwe'll actually be looking at Agile testing\n\n25\n00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.240\nmethods and the types of testing\nthat we do within an Agile project.\n\n26\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.910\nSo for this particular episode,\nwe're going to be doing a recap over\n\n27\n00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.180\nAgile itself, what Agile is, and we'll\nlook at the principles of Agile as well.\n\n28\n00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.540\nSo this is our first episode, really out\nfirst toe in the water in Agile testing.\n\n29\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.809\nAnd certainly this particular episode\nis really for those that have not yet\n\n30\n00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:22.320\nseen our Agile fundamental series.\n\n31\n00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.080\nAnd it's just a quick\nrecap over that series.\n\n32\n00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great.\nSo even though I was part of that series,\n\n33\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.810\nthis will be also great for\nme just to get a refresher.\n\n34\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.340\nAnyone else that may have watched it and\n\n35\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.790\nthen needs to just kinda\nhave a recap as well.\n\n36\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.200\n&gt;&gt; What she's saying is she's forgotten.\n\n37\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.230\nThat's what she's saying.\n\n38\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.920\n&gt;&gt; We'll see.\n\n39\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.530\n&gt;&gt; But that's okay.\n\n40\n00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.390\nSometimes you don't actually get to watch\none series straight after another and\n\n41\n00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.080\nthat's all right.\n\n42\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.650\nThat's exactly why we do these\nsort of quick recap introduction,\n\n43\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.520\ncuz otherwise, how would you know\nwhat it was we were talking about\n\n44\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.420\na little bit later on in another episode?\n\n45\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.740\nSo that's exactly why we do this.\n\n46\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.032\nSo let's start off with looking at\nAgile itself and what is Agile.\n\n47\n00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:06.030\nWell, you've already heard about Agile or\nyou wouldn't be here if you didn't know\n\n48\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.130\nanything about Agile or\nyou hadn't heard about it.\n\n49\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.760\nAgile is a way of looking and\ndelivering projects and\n\n50\n00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.340\ndelivering software in\nan incremental fashion.\n\n51\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.090\nIt's actually what we call continuous\ndelivery, and Agile allows us to\n\n52\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.270\nmanage a project and to deliver the\nbenefits of a project to the organization\n\n53\n00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.090\nin a way that is delivered on\nan incremental or continual basis.\n\n54\n00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.690\nAnd that's why we call\nit continuous delivery.\n\n55\n00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.380\nWith an Agile project management\nmethodology, your customers,\n\n56\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.990\nyour users are seeing\nbenefits almost immediately\n\n57\n00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.360\non a regular basis on an ongoing or\ncontinual basis.\n\n58\n00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.150\nSo what we do with the Agile project is,\n\n59\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.000\nthe Agile project is split into\nwhat we call stories, user stories.\n\n60\n00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.280\nAnd those stories,\nwe may choose to deliver just one or\n\n61\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.990\nwe may choose to deliver three or\nfour at any one point in time, but\n\n62\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.490\nwe group them into what\nwe call an iteration.\n\n63\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.490\nSometimes, if you're using the Scrum\nmethodology, then we call that a sprint,\n\n64\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.310\nand every iteration lasts between one and\nfour weeks.\n\n65\n00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.790\nSo with each iteration, there you go,\nyou can see it in front of you.\n\n66\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.960\nThere you go, a very,\nvery simple iteration or sprint.\n\n67\n00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.830\nCouldn't be simpler, right?\n\n68\n00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.342\nJust looks like a big loopy arrow.\n\n69\n00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:28.569\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna build on that.\n\n70\n00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.800\n&gt;&gt; And that's the technical term.\n\n71\n00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.360\nJust kidding.\n\n72\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.980\n&gt;&gt; A big loopy arrow, right,\nthat lasts for four weeks.\n\n73\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.010\nSo with every single iteration then, we\nstart off with well, the project itself.\n\n74\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.650\nSo we initiate the project.\n\n75\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.230\nBut what is included here?\n\n76\n00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.310\nRight at the very beginning of\nthe project is the vision, and\n\n77\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.380\nthe goals of the project,\nalso the constraints of the project.\n\n78\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.070\nSo things like, well, budgets,\nthat's a constraint, yeah.\n\n79\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.480\nThe actual deliverable itself,\n\n80\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.740\nbelieve it or not,\nthat could be a constraint as well.\n\n81\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.610\nAny sort of regulations that we may have,\nwhat we might call the utility,\n\n82\n00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.750\nin other words, what it's expected to do.\n\n83\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.090\nAnd also our warranty levels as well,\n\n84\n00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.970\nin other words how we expect to work\nwith that particular end product.\n\n85\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.740\nAnd then we have what we call our cost\ngrading requirements and estimates.\n\n86\n00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.580\nWhen we say cost grading what we mean is,\nwe mean high level.\n\n87\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.940\nWe don't know really until we get\ninto the depths of our project,\n\n88\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.240\nwe don't know exactly how long\neverything is going to take.\n\n89\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.830\nWe don't know exactly how long each\nparticular piece of development work is\n\n90\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.160\ngoing to take.\n\n91\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.920\nIt's what we would say in England is how\nlong is a piece of string measurement?\n\n92\n00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.720\nAnd it really is.\n\n93\n00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.550\nI mean, you ask me how long\nis a piece of string and\n\n94\n00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.990\nI'm going to shrug my shoulders.\n\n95\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.660\nAnd that's exactly where we\nare at this point in time.\n\n96\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.104\nSo we take what we might\ncall here a ballpark figure,\n\n97\n00:04:50.104 --> 00:04:55.240\njust an estimate, which is-\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm trying to rationalize this.\n\n98\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.790\nI'm like,\ncoarse grained versus fine grained.\n\n99\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.648\nI'm going the sandpaper method,\nbut okay, yeah.\n\n100\n00:05:00.648 --> 00:05:04.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, is that where it comes from?\n\n101\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, of course, kind of just\ntakes of the sort of the rough bits.\n\n102\n00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.209\nYeah, we're smoothing out the rough\nbits right now, that's all we got to.\n\n103\n00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:17.396\n[LAUGH] And then what we're going to be\ndoing as part of this planning is we're\n\n104\n00:05:17.396 --> 00:05:22.421\ngoing to be, and take a look at our\nAgile fundamentals class and we'll see\n\n105\n00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:27.550\nhow we actually look at the iteration or\nthe sprint, and planning as well.\n\n106\n00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.120\nAnd what we've decided to\ninclude in each iteration.\n\n107\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.290\nSo there we go,\nwe start off by initiating the project.\n\n108\n00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.911\nAnd then, each iteration,\nno matter what it's made up of,\n\n109\n00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:42.249\nhow many user stories,\nwe have to plan each iteration.\n\n110\n00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:46.210\nBut that's only gonna take between one and\nfour weeks.\n\n111\n00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.823\nThis is not going to take three months or\nthree years.\n\n112\n00:05:49.823 --> 00:05:51.984\nThis is not a waterfall project.\n\n113\n00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:57.259\nThis is literally going to be whatever\nis possible, feasible, viable,\n\n114\n00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:03.229\nwhatever word you wanna use, whatever is\npossible within those wonderful weeks.\n\n115\n00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.658\nIt's really perfectly feasible and viable,\nand whatever else you wanna use as\n\n116\n00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:11.770\nthe word, to deliver an iteration\nwithin two weeks or even within a week.\n\n117\n00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.540\nSo don't think that this can't be a real\nproject because I'm expected to deliver\n\n118\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.350\nsomething every single week.\n\n119\n00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.280\nThis is definitely a real project, but\nwe're delivering in a continual way.\n\n120\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.240\nThat's why we call it continuous delivery.\n\n121\n00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.970\nDuring that particular iteration, and\n\n122\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.130\nwe do this for every single iteration,\nwe have something that's very close to my\n\n123\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.560\nheart because this is something\nthat we do here every single day.\n\n124\n00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.580\nIs that we have our\ndaily stand-up meeting.\n\n125\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.760\nSo and\nnow I'm gonna put Cherokee on the spot.\n\n126\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.210\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, right!\n\n127\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.279\n&gt;&gt; Just because-\n\n128\n00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:47.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like to really.\n\n129\n00:06:47.215 --> 00:06:49.515\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n&gt;&gt; Why not?\n\n130\n00:06:49.515 --> 00:06:51.730\nNow we've already looked\nat stand-up meetings.\n\n131\n00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.000\nWe did this in another series,\nin our Agile fundamentals.\n\n132\n00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.370\nCan you remember then why\nwe did a stand-up meeting?\n\n133\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.351\nOkay, so we want to go ahead and\nlet everyone know\n\n134\n00:07:04.351 --> 00:07:08.735\nabout any accomplishments, obstacles.\n\n135\n00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:09.347\nI'm trying to think.\n\n136\n00:07:09.347 --> 00:07:16.200\nAccomplishments, obstacles, and\nmaybe shout outs or recognition.\n\n137\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.440\nOkay, I'm impressed by that.\n\n138\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n139\n00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know the exact technical\n\n140\n00:07:22.277 --> 00:07:24.830\nterms we might have used, but yeah.\n\n141\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, think of every standup\nmeeting as a planning meeting.\n\n142\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.780\nSo think about what we do here and what\nwe do is we really go around the room and\n\n143\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.990\nwe say right, this is what's\non our agenda for today, yes.\n\n144\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.560\nSo we will tell everybody in a standup\nmeeting what each developer is doing for\n\n145\n00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.010\nthat particular day.\n\n146\n00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.878\nSo in our case we will stand up and\n\n147\n00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:45.727\nwe will say this is what\ncontent I'm producing.\n\n148\n00:07:45.727 --> 00:07:50.706\nBut it's also an opportunity for those in\nthe standup to, as you have already said,\n\n149\n00:07:50.706 --> 00:07:54.830\nhighlight any accomplishments\nwhat we've already achieved.\n\n150\n00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.931\nAlso to highlight any\nobstacles that we might face.\n\n151\n00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:02.051\nBecause this is your opportunity and\nthat's standup meeting for\n\n152\n00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:05.110\nsomebody to turn around and\nsay hey, look, I can help.\n\n153\n00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.910\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n154\n00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.700\n&gt;&gt; And again, in standup meeting we\nwant to reward and recognize too, so\n\n155\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.690\nwe do want to,\nI was gonna say call out anybody but\n\n156\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.370\ngive them the recognition\nthat they deserve.\n\n157\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.940\nNo, this is not a place where we\npoint fingers and apportion blame.\n\n158\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.330\n&gt;&gt; No, and I'm just thinking shout out,\nlike, I don't know.\n\n159\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.790\nDid you ever call up the radio line,\nI wanna give a shoutout to Emily, my bff?\n\n160\n00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.590\nNo?\n\n161\n00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.135\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n162\n00:08:29.135 --> 00:08:32.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying a word.\n\n163\n00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.330\n&gt;&gt; That was like\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n164\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.431\n&gt;&gt; Leave that one there [LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:39.514\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n166\n00:08:39.514 --> 00:08:40.240\n&gt;&gt; Anyhow.\n\n167\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.650\n&gt;&gt; No. No. I think we were\na little bit more reserved.\n\n168\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.400\nI think we would say, hi.\n\n169\n00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna say hi to the person that\n\n170\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.910\nI really, really, really like.\n\n171\n00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.070\nBut I don't want to tell\nthem that's it's me.\n\n172\n00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.900\nCould you please make sure\nthat you disguise my voice.\n\n173\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.130\nThat sort of thing-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n174\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.375\n&gt;&gt; That sounded creepy, right?\n\n175\n00:08:57.375 --> 00:08:59.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, let's move on very,\n\n176\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.500\nvery quickly then.\n\n177\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.940\n[LAUGH] So\nduring that development period then,\n\n178\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.240\nwe're gonna have thee daily standup\nmeetings and those daily standup meetings,\n\n179\n00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.230\nyou'll see what comes out of those\nmeetings is the project status.\n\n180\n00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:14.500\nWe're gonna talk about and look at exactly\n\n181\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.820\nhow we can visualize and how we can\ndemonstrate what our progress is,\n\n182\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.200\nbearing in mind, agile doesn't\nmean no documentation at all.\n\n183\n00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.830\nAnd that's what people think.\n\n184\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.028\nPeople tend to think with agile\nthere's no documentation cuz we're\n\n185\n00:09:28.028 --> 00:09:33.380\nfocused on efficiencies but\nyou've gotta have some visible\n\n186\n00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.300\nmethod to represent the progress\nof the project, you have to.\n\n187\n00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.190\n&gt;&gt; Just eliminating the wasteful\ndocumentation, right Jo?\n\n188\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n189\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.010\nYou have to have the documentation.\n\n190\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.690\nAnd even if it is, the fact that and I've\nseen a lot of organizations that do this.\n\n191\n00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.860\nWe've got our Kanban board,\n\n192\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.750\nwhich is our board that tells us\nwhat we've still got to do for\n\n193\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.390\nthat particular iteration, what's in\nprogress and what's been completed.\n\n194\n00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.910\nAnd I have seen organizations that\nwill use these smart boards now.\n\n195\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.479\nOr even where they'll simply take a photo\nof the board on a daily basis, so\n\n196\n00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:08.314\nmaybe twice today and\nthat's uploaded into the share drive so\n\n197\n00:10:08.314 --> 00:10:12.825\nthat everybody can see exactly what\nthe progress is, if any user story.\n\n198\n00:10:12.825 --> 00:10:16.955\nAnd so there has to be some form of\ndocumentation, keep it informal,\n\n199\n00:10:16.955 --> 00:10:21.440\nkeep it at a high level, it's got to\nbe there and it's got to be efficient,\n\n200\n00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.410\nthat's the main point.\n\n201\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.540\nBut it shouldn't be too bureaucratic,\nit doesn't need to be a 15 page\n\n202\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.680\ndocument everyday because then you need\nto employ three people a day to do it.\n\n203\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.050\n&gt;&gt; Well technically, I was talking\nto someone earlier this morning and\n\n204\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:40.550\nthey were joking around the and they said,\nsomeone had asked, well, what's Agile?\n\n205\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.270\nAnd the response was with\nall the post-its everywhere.\n\n206\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.080\nAnd I'm like, no,\nJo would cringe if she heard you.\n\n207\n00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.470\nAnd they said but, theoretically if you're\ntalking about like you can use post-its,\n\n208\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.640\nI mean,\ncuz it's still the visual aid there.\n\n209\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.180\nWhat was the acronym BVC?\n\n210\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.499\nBig Visual Chart?\n\n211\n00:10:56.499 --> 00:10:59.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, I remember a little bit.\n\n212\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.590\n&gt;&gt; That's definite.\n\n213\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.340\nNo, I'm not gonna cringe,\nas far as post-its or\n\n214\n00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.765\nany other form of sticky\nnote is concerned.\n\n215\n00:11:06.765 --> 00:11:09.310\n[LAUGH] We don't care what brand.\n\n216\n00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:15.140\nWe're gonna talk about and\nwe do in all of our agile courses,\n\n217\n00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.990\nwe'll talk about the use of cards and\nthe use of notes and sticky notes.\n\n218\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:25.330\nYou could use a and in that you can simply\njust get your marker and mark on it.\n\n219\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.970\nThe thing with marking something is that\nthen you don't have that piece of paper.\n\n220\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.150\nYou've got to, it wouldn't necessarily\nbe considered efficient because\n\n221\n00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.700\nyou're duplicating the effort.\n\n222\n00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.210\nWhereas if it's on a posted note, then you\nstick it on the board and then you just\n\n223\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.180\ntake that off and move it somewhere else\nand you don't have to rewrite everything.\n\n224\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.805\nI'm all for saving effort.\n\n225\n00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:48.366\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something to do with my spelling as\n\n226\n00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:50.255\nwell it's much easier\njust to write it once.\n\n227\n00:11:50.255 --> 00:11:52.987\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, the sticky notes,\n\n228\n00:11:52.987 --> 00:11:54.690\nthey're perfect.\n\n229\n00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.740\nThey're absolutely fantastic for this.\n\n230\n00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.430\nBut what we will do,\nis we'll still want a status of that.\n\n231\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.440\nSo even if that's just,\nyou take a picture, total representation.\n\n232\n00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.240\nTake a photo and that gets filed.\n\n233\n00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.710\nSo we can see that throughout\nthese one to four weeks or\n\n234\n00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.770\nwhatever the period of that sprint is,\nwe can see that progress is being made.\n\n235\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.750\nSo yeah.\n\n236\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.080\nWe keep that project status.\n\n237\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.730\nAnd then after we've\ndeveloped the project or\n\n238\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.490\ndeveloped that iteration,\nthen we got to review it.\n\n239\n00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.430\nWe got to make sure that it's right.\n\n240\n00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.190\nWe got to make sure that it delivers\nwhat it's supposed to deliver and\n\n241\n00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.600\nmore importantly, that the iteration\ndelivered, what we set out to deliver.\n\n242\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.080\nSo look, if we said we'd go into deliver\nthree pieces of code in that particular\n\n243\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.140\niteration, then we've actually\ndelivered three pieces of code or\n\n244\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.960\nthat if we've only delivered two pieces of\ncode, well, that's when we review that and\n\n245\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.400\nthen, well, we say okay, well,\n\n246\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.640\nwe'd add that other one to what we\ncall the back plug, if you remember.\n\n247\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.390\nSo we review our restoration\nat this point in time.\n\n248\n00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.050\nAnd then we deliver our\nproduct increments.\n\n249\n00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:07.450\nNow, one thing that you'll notice\nhere is this is building up, that our\n\n250\n00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.140\nproduct increments or our production\nquality product, as it says there.\n\n251\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:18.221\nYou'll notice that in each release\nyou've got more than one increment or\n\n252\n00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:21.270\nmore than one iteration, perhaps.\n\n253\n00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.556\n&gt;&gt; I think I remember that one too.\n\n254\n00:13:23.556 --> 00:13:25.917\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, it’s balance,\n\n255\n00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:28.010\nit really is a balance.\n\n256\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:33.830\nYou have to because the organization\ndoesn’t want to have too much disruption,\n\n257\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:38.500\nyou have to consider how frequently\nyou actually want to release\n\n258\n00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.530\nThis has got nothing to do with\nhow frequently you develop.\n\n259\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n260\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.820\n&gt;&gt; How frequently you develop,\nthat's between one and four weeks.\n\n261\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.460\nAnd what you have in each iteration or\n\n262\n00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.720\nin each sprint, that's entirely\nup to you in terms of volume.\n\n263\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.630\nIf you've only got one developer,\nyou're not gonna have as much\n\n264\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.660\nin that iteration as if you've\ngot 15 developers for instance.\n\n265\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.090\nBut then if you've got 15 developers,\nthen that's a rather large project.\n\n266\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.570\nSo you might actually want to\nreduce each increment down, so\n\n267\n00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:12.140\nthat you're realising those increments and\nthose sprints on a more regular basis.\n\n268\n00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.590\nI know it's difficult to manage.\n\n269\n00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.270\nBut the one thing that we've got\nto be really conscious of is\n\n270\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.619\ndisruption to the organization,\ndisruption to the users.\n\n271\n00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.820\nWe wanna deliver value in a continual way.\n\n272\n00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.930\nSo we want to deliver\nvalue on a regular basis.\n\n273\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.790\nBut come on, you know yourself.\n\n274\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.100\nHow often does your upgraded\nsystem get updated?\n\n275\n00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, now with Windows as a service,\nit happens a lot more than it used to.\n\n276\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.810\nSo quite often.\n\n277\n00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.240\n&gt;&gt; Right and let's be honest,\nbetween you and me,\n\n278\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.395\nhow often do you get\nreally irritated by it?\n\n279\n00:14:45.395 --> 00:14:51.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Look at Joe trying to get\nall of the dirt on me right now.\n\n280\n00:14:51.045 --> 00:14:52.210\n[LAUGH] No, seriously though.\n\n281\n00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.500\nIs that an epic release,\nwhen we bundle those?\n\n282\n00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.650\nKind of like geez.\n\n283\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.940\nDid you ever work with Windows XP,\nwhen we had those service packs.\n\n284\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.974\nSo it's kind of like those epic\nreleases are like service packs, so\n\n285\n00:15:03.974 --> 00:15:04.890\nit's cumulative.\n\n286\n00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.180\nSo here's a bunch of features,\nI'm gonna hand them to you all at once.\n\n287\n00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:12.010\nSo, sometimes if we bundle them, I have\nless disturbances but I'm still getting my\n\n288\n00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.528\nfour fledged features-\n&gt;&gt; There could be a change.\n\n289\n00:15:14.528 --> 00:15:15.182\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:18.060\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Finding the balance there.\n\n291\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.787\n&gt;&gt; And that's the balance\nthat you've got to have.\n\n292\n00:15:19.787 --> 00:15:21.920\nYou know what's so irritating.\n\n293\n00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.140\n&gt;&gt; If you are\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Tell us just Jo.\n\n294\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:25.850\n&gt;&gt; No. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I know, [LAUGH].\n\n295\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.770\nI'm stunned, I'm gonna preach this to a.\n\n296\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.500\nIt's so irritating,\nit really is because if you have\n\n297\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.100\na Windows Service Pack and\nit's maybe once a month.\n\n298\n00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.520\nBut then with each service\npacket it's a huge big change.\n\n299\n00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.640\nSo it makes you really\nreluctant to upgrade.\n\n300\n00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.300\nYou don't wanna upgrade because\nyou don't want the change.\n\n301\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.820\nBut then if you're getting\na release every single week.\n\n302\n00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.783\nIt might only have one or\ntwo things in the but\n\n303\n00:15:52.783 --> 00:15:55.183\nyou still got to take time\nto implement that release.\n\n304\n00:15:55.183 --> 00:15:58.966\nYou still got to reboot, you'd still\ngot to close everything down and\n\n305\n00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:02.050\nmaybe sit there for\n10 minutes and then look up.\n\n306\n00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.299\nWhat's you know on\nthe screen in front of you.\n\n307\n00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:04.982\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Make sure it's still working function.\n\n308\n00:16:04.982 --> 00:16:07.410\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Watch\nthat nice blue screen.\n\n309\n00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As we all know,\n\n310\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.490\nthat not every single update\ngoes as smoothly as anticipated.\n\n311\n00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's why we say\nyou got to get the balance right.\n\n312\n00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.400\nBecause if I'm releasing only one thing,\nif I'm releasing only one iteration and\n\n313\n00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.930\nin that screen in front of you there,\nyou'll see that there are more than this\n\n314\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.830\nthree actually for\neach particular release.\n\n315\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.058\nIf I'm releasing one iteration and\nI'm releasing that every single week,\n\n316\n00:16:34.058 --> 00:16:35.287\njust one iteration.\n\n317\n00:16:35.287 --> 00:16:36.970\nYour users are gonna get fed up.\n\n318\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.090\nBecause there's too many releases.\n\n319\n00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.840\nBut If I'm waiting and\nI'm only releasing one once a month but\n\n320\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.700\nit's a huge big release.\n\n321\n00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.601\nThen it's a huge big release.\n\n322\n00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:47.880\nThen your user is gonna get fed out\nbecause there is too much disruption.\n\n323\n00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.340\nI don't know your users.\n\n324\n00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.680\nI really can't answer that.\n\n325\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.140\nYou know your users and\nyou know what that prepared to accept.\n\n326\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:01.460\nOn the most part, an organization\nthat is really sort of IT savvy And\n\n327\n00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.715\nan organization that is\ncomfortable with IT.\n\n328\n00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:09.700\nThey will generally accommodate more\nfrequent releases that an organization\n\n329\n00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.730\nthat sees IT and\nI'm gonna say this as a necessary evil.\n\n330\n00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.743\nAnd all though you might say, well,\nthat doesn't sound politically correct but\n\n331\n00:17:17.743 --> 00:17:21.233\nyou know what, there are a lot\norganizations out there that still think\n\n332\n00:17:21.233 --> 00:17:22.530\nof IT as a necessary evil.\n\n333\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.340\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n334\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.120\n&gt;&gt; I'm evil.\n\n335\n00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.470\nI'm into that [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The first company that came to my mind\n\n336\n00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:32.340\nwas Microsoft and I know they have this\nterm and it's called eating their own dog\n\n337\n00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.066\nfood and they see releases,\n\n338\n00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:35.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, seriously.\n\n339\n00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.418\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow.\n&gt;&gt; And they see releases all the time and\n\n340\n00:17:37.418 --> 00:17:40.785\nthat's because basically it's like hey,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n341\n00:17:40.785 --> 00:17:43.850\nbeta test in-house before we go ahead and\nroll this out.\n\n342\n00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.210\nSo they're seeing even more\nthan like ITProTView would.\n\n343\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.255\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'm not gonna go as\nfar as eating dog food though.\n\n344\n00:17:51.255 --> 00:17:53.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You haven't seen what my dogs eat.\n\n345\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.200\nI'm gonna go anything.\n\n346\n00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.990\nI'm not gonna go that far.\n\n347\n00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.218\nThey'll eat my food.\n\n348\n00:17:58.218 --> 00:17:59.990\n[LAUGH] Quite happily.\n\n349\n00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.720\nBut yeah, it's exactly that.\n\n350\n00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.590\nToo often, in IT, we can approach things\n\n351\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.960\nfrom a perspective of,\nwe're not the necessary evil, in effect.\n\n352\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.620\nWe're here to help you.\n\n353\n00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.160\nAnd therefore, we are going to help you.\n\n354\n00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.230\nAnd it's not down to us,\nit's not our decision,\n\n355\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.060\nit's about delivering\nvalue to the organization.\n\n356\n00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.330\nIt's not about what's valuable to us and\n\n357\n00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.508\nwhat's valuable to them might\nnot be what's valuable to us.\n\n358\n00:18:28.508 --> 00:18:34.650\nSo, think about your organization,\nthink about what they'd value and\n\n359\n00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.280\nemploy people like business\nrelationship management.\n\n360\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.030\nAnd I don't mean go out and\nhire somebody, I mean use\n\n361\n00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:45.010\nyour business relationship management type\nof role to tell you what your users and\n\n362\n00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.770\nwhat your business are comfortable\nwith and what they want to see.\n\n363\n00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.420\nIf it is a high visibility project,\nif it's a project that\n\n364\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.110\nis going to get them to market\nquicker in any certain product,\n\n365\n00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.370\nthen they're probably gonna\nwant to release rapidly.\n\n366\n00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.950\nThey are probably going to want to\nrelease more frequently, however,\n\n367\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.320\nif they got a really huge product\nlaunch that they are planning for\n\n368\n00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:15.290\nmonth time or so, then they probably\nwant to release a lot more.\n\n369\n00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.330\nBut leave it for that month and\n\n370\n00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.700\nthen release just before that\nparticular keynote speech.\n\n371\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.310\nSo, I mean you think about Apple.\n\n372\n00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.220\nWhat Apple do is they leave it for\nan entire year before they do a keynote\n\n373\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.556\nspeech and then they will\nactually release their product.\n\n374\n00:19:30.556 --> 00:19:35.286\nNo, I'm not saying that releasing\nevery year is, it's great but\n\n375\n00:19:35.286 --> 00:19:39.860\nit depends on the organization and\nit depends on the situation.\n\n376\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.012\nSo, maybe known to the iteration\nreview at the same time,\n\n377\n00:19:44.012 --> 00:19:48.929\nas we're delivering those increments\nin the actual budget itself,\n\n378\n00:19:48.929 --> 00:19:52.280\nin that iteration or from the iterations.\n\n379\n00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.310\nWe're updating the projects status,\nremember what I said about backlogs.\n\n380\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.600\nSometimes, we have user stories\nthat don't get completed.\n\n381\n00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.660\nAnd that's okay, that's all right.\n\n382\n00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.860\nThere's nothing wrong with that and\n\n383\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.340\nthat's something else that\nwe can accommodate much\n\n384\n00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.950\nbetter in an agile type environment than\nwe can in a waterfall type environment.\n\n385\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.480\nIn a waterfall type of environment,\n\n386\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.980\nwe've got a whole list of things that we\nhave to deliver and we have to deliver\n\n387\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:23.090\nthem by a certain period of time\nbecause that's the end of the project.\n\n388\n00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.910\nIn an agile environment, we've got our\nuser stories for this increment and\n\n389\n00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.710\nthen we've got more user stories for the\nnext increment and more user stories for\n\n390\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:31.600\nthe next increment.\n\n391\n00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.510\nAnd that's what we call our backlog.\n\n392\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:38.430\nAnd if for whatever reason,\nwe don't get one finished, okay, well,\n\n393\n00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.930\nwe just move that into the backlog.\n\n394\n00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.300\nAnd we accept that we didn't\nget that one finished.\n\n395\n00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.210\nWe will analyze why we\ndidn't get it finished cuz\n\n396\n00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.970\nthere might be some things\nthat we have to overcome.\n\n397\n00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.050\nThere might have been testing issues for\n\n398\n00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.930\ninstance which is why we're looking\nat that in this particular series.\n\n399\n00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.160\nOr there might have being other issues\nto do with say stuff, scales or\n\n400\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.380\nsomething like that.\n\n401\n00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.100\nSo, we're like Seth that okay,\nwe didn't get that finished now.\n\n402\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.380\nSo let's move that to another.\n\n403\n00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.080\nAnother iteration.\n\n404\n00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:14.830\nAnd so we review our estimations for\nour iterations at this point in time.\n\n405\n00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.315\nWe don't have anything and that's it,\nwe're not touching it again.\n\n406\n00:21:18.315 --> 00:21:20.150\n[LAUGH] No, we failed.\n\n407\n00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.550\nNo, we move it to another iteration while\nwe allocate the right amount of time to be\n\n408\n00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:30.020\nable to deal with that and sometimes,\nwe achieve more quickly and\n\n409\n00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.680\ntherefore we finish an iteration\nsooner that we expected.\n\n410\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:40.210\nSo, really we can in agile\nenvironment be a lot more flexible\n\n411\n00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:45.910\nabout our iterations and about what we\nactually deliver at that point in time.\n\n412\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWe don't have adhere by the book and\n\n413\n00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.710\nthat's what really being agile,\nif you think about the word itself.\n\n414\n00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.110\nThat's what it means, right?\n\n415\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n416\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.420\nYeah.\nThat's exactly it.\n\n417\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.430\nYeah.\nWe've got to be agile.\n\n418\n00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.602\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We got to be flexible.\n\n419\n00:21:58.602 --> 00:21:59.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n420\n00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.885\nWithout doing all the stretching\nhere at ITPro TV.\n\n421\n00:22:02.885 --> 00:22:04.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n422\n00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:04.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n423\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.280\nWe do some crazy things here,\nabsolutely crazy.\n\n424\n00:22:09.532 --> 00:22:12.800\nSo and you'll see that now,\nwhat we've done here is n fact,\n\n425\n00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.290\nunfortunately, it's a little\nbit hidden on that slide but\n\n426\n00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.010\nwhat you'll see is now we've\nmoved on to our next iteration.\n\n427\n00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:23.310\nAnd our next iteration is\nwhat we had planned and\n\n428\n00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.140\nwhat we had planned for the next\nsituation and the subsequent one and\n\n429\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.260\nthe subsequent one and this is just\na cycle that just carries on, okay?\n\n430\n00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.120\nThis is not something that we\ndeliver as a one off exercise and\n\n431\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.950\nthen that's it,\nthis is a cycle that caries on, so\n\n432\n00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.860\nour iterations then will produce\nthe next iteration produces.\n\n433\n00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.750\nThe next set of user stories and\nthe next iteration,\n\n434\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.560\nthe next set of user stories, etc.\n\n435\n00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.330\nNow, unlike a waterfall approach,\nwhere a waterfall approach\n\n436\n00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.220\nto project management is we\ndeliver everything, all at once.\n\n437\n00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.220\nThat's your release.\n\n438\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.700\nAnd your release might be in a phased\nmanner but that's still your release.\n\n439\n00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.920\nWhat we're able to do in this agile\napproach is we're able to say\n\n440\n00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.390\nthis is my release.\n\n441\n00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:12.400\nOnce I've released it, I can now take off,\ncross off, whatever you want to use.\n\n442\n00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.950\nI can now cross off those\npieces' functionality.\n\n443\n00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:21.510\nI can cross off that development work and\nnow I can move on to the next.\n\n444\n00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:25.360\nAnd so I actually see and\nthis is the beauty of an agile project,\n\n445\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.740\nis that I can actually see\nvisible deliverance of value.\n\n446\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.880\nI see visible progress.\n\n447\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.500\nSo from a customer prospective,\nthey see something a lot sooner.\n\n448\n00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.160\nThere's nothing more\ndemoralizing to as customer\n\n449\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.570\nwhen you've promised them something and\nyou've sat down and you fleshed it\n\n450\n00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.050\nout with them exactly what they want and\nthen they don't see anything for a year.\n\n451\n00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.640\nThey've kind of forgotten about\nit at that point in time and then\n\n452\n00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.453\n&gt;&gt; Totally lost faith in you or your team.\n\n453\n00:23:54.453 --> 00:24:00.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not just that because they\nhave, as you've lost your credibility.\n\n454\n00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.335\nBut also functionality changes.\n\n455\n00:24:02.335 --> 00:24:05.786\nI mean, I don't know about you,\nbut I don't keep my cell phone for\n\n456\n00:24:05.786 --> 00:24:07.440\nany longer than a year.\n\n457\n00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.378\nI guess I shouldn't advertise that fact,\ncuz I'm probably-\n\n458\n00:24:10.378 --> 00:24:11.480\n&gt;&gt; Gonna get 500 calls this afternoon.\n\n459\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, I'm the cell phone\nmanufacturer's best customer, I really am.\n\n460\n00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.970\nBut in a year's time I wanna\nsee new functionality.\n\n461\n00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:25.513\nSo if I have come to you, say you were\nmy developer or my project manager and\n\n462\n00:24:25.513 --> 00:24:28.096\nI come to you with a list of requirements.\n\n463\n00:24:28.096 --> 00:24:30.616\nAnd I have said to you hey,\nlook, this is what I want,\n\n464\n00:24:30.616 --> 00:24:34.270\nif you don't come back to me in a year,\ntrust me, I've gone somewhere else.\n\n465\n00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.014\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm impatient, [LAUGH] I really am and\n\n466\n00:24:37.014 --> 00:24:38.900\nI've gone somewhere else.\n\n467\n00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:43.830\nI've already decided that you know\nwhat I've heard nothing from you and\n\n468\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.710\nI don't wanna have to keep\nchasing you up either.\n\n469\n00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.379\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna have to keep\n\n470\n00:24:47.379 --> 00:24:48.480\nmanaging you.\n\n471\n00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.430\nSo with an Agile approach,\ncustomers actually see that deliverable.\n\n472\n00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:57.950\nNow, if we get the communication\nright in our waterfall approach then\n\n473\n00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:02.770\nwe can still achieve a deliverable and\ncustomers can still perceive value.\n\n474\n00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.720\nSometimes though it's not\nas easy as it sounds.\n\n475\n00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.770\nSo that brings me into and\nthis is our last sort of slide for\n\n476\n00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.320\nthis particular episode.\n\n477\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.880\nIt brings me into our Agile team.\n\n478\n00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:21.980\nOur Agile team, you will see that we have\nour product owner and our scrum master.\n\n479\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.910\nThen we have our developers.\n\n480\n00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:28.964\nAnd then we've also got collaboration with\nother teams and management and end users.\n\n481\n00:25:28.964 --> 00:25:32.387\nSo I want to ask you,\nbefore we go any further into the slide,\n\n482\n00:25:32.387 --> 00:25:35.006\nso I'm gonna put Cherokee\non the spot again cuz\n\n483\n00:25:35.006 --> 00:25:38.411\nI love doing this-\n&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering what we should have\n\n484\n00:25:38.411 --> 00:25:42.218\nreally taken headshots from\neveryone here you know at ITProTV.\n\n485\n00:25:42.218 --> 00:25:43.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I put them on\n\n486\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.280\nthere instead of the little\nclip art people.\n\n487\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we should do that.\n\n488\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.210\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] I don't,\n\n489\n00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.610\nI'm not too sure how willing they'd be.\n\n490\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.280\n&gt;&gt; Anyways, get back to business Jo.\n\n491\n00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm just wondering who\nwe'd put in there as the scrum master,\n\n492\n00:25:57.345 --> 00:25:58.086\nI really am.\n\n493\n00:25:58.086 --> 00:25:58.853\n&gt;&gt; Yes of course.\n\n494\n00:25:58.853 --> 00:26:02.930\n&gt;&gt; What's the different between\nthe product owner and a scrum master?\n\n495\n00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.845\n&gt;&gt; Okay this I think I do remember and-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I hammered it into her.\n\n496\n00:26:06.845 --> 00:26:10.735\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we heard this quite\na bit in our Agile fundamentals.\n\n497\n00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:14.103\nSo for the product owner, that's\ngonna be an individual that is taking\n\n498\n00:26:14.103 --> 00:26:16.081\nresponsibility for the actual product.\n\n499\n00:26:16.081 --> 00:26:20.835\nWhereas the scrum master is in charge\nof everything else, more of those\n\n500\n00:26:20.835 --> 00:26:26.088\ninterpersonal relations, so between\nthe team members and things like that.\n\n501\n00:26:26.088 --> 00:26:27.242\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n502\n00:26:27.242 --> 00:26:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n503\n00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly that and in fact we do have\n\n504\n00:26:30.283 --> 00:26:34.418\nanother series looking specifically\nat product owner responsibilities and\n\n505\n00:26:34.418 --> 00:26:38.380\nwhat they should be doing and\nalso what they shouldn't be doing as well.\n\n506\n00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.960\nThe scrum master manages the team.\n\n507\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.070\nThe scrum master makes sure that\nwe've got enough developers.\n\n508\n00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.580\nThe scrum master makes sure\nthat our timelines are right.\n\n509\n00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.970\nThe scrum master makes sure that\nour stories are prioritized and\n\n510\n00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:58.490\nthat now listen, they make sure\nthat our stories our prioritized.\n\n511\n00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.700\nThey don't prioritize the stories,\nthey ensure that they're prioritized.\n\n512\n00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.280\nThe scrum master is managing all\nof the admin side of things,\n\n513\n00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.840\nthe interpersonal side of things.\n\n514\n00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.440\nAnd you'll notice that the scrum master\nhas relationships with management and\n\n515\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.430\nwith other teams as well cuz the scrum\nmaster is responsible for collaboration.\n\n516\n00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.265\nThe product owner makes the decisions\non features to include,\n\n517\n00:27:22.265 --> 00:27:25.320\nthe priority of the user stories.\n\n518\n00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.330\nAnd the product owner\nis also responsible for\n\n519\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:32.650\ndefining the user personas and\nthose user stories.\n\n520\n00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.040\nNow again,\nwe look further in depth of those,\n\n521\n00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.490\nwe look at those in our\nproduct owner series.\n\n522\n00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.063\nBut a product owner is responsible for\nthe product.\n\n523\n00:27:42.063 --> 00:27:47.940\nThe scrum master is responsible for\nall of the admin side of things.\n\n524\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.400\nThey're responsible for management,\naffiliating with management,\n\n525\n00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.910\nmaking sure the communications in place.\n\n526\n00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.880\nI expect the scrum\nmaster if the developers\n\n527\n00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.930\nhaven't been updating the boards that\nwe've got with our little post it notes.\n\n528\n00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:05.380\nI expect the scrum master to be the one\nto say, hey, this hasn't moved,\n\n529\n00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.520\nwhy hasn't this moved,\nwho's working on this?\n\n530\n00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.840\nSo who is it do you think\nthen that leads and\n\n531\n00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.260\nthis is gonna answer the question of\nwho it is that's the scrum master here.\n\n532\n00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.360\nWho is it that leads the stand up?\n\n533\n00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.130\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be the scrum master.\n\n534\n00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:21.930\n&gt;&gt; It is, yes.\n\n535\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.360\nSo the product owner makes\nthe decisions on the product itself and\n\n536\n00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.850\non prioritization, etc.\n\n537\n00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:33.640\nBut the scrum master is the person\nthat actually leads the stand up.\n\n538\n00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.151\nSo now,\nwe know who our scrum master is, right?\n\n539\n00:28:36.151 --> 00:28:36.946\nTim, right.\n\n540\n00:28:36.946 --> 00:28:39.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the owner of ITProTv,\n\n541\n00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.960\nif you haven't figured that out, but\nhe does lead our stand ups in the morning.\n\n542\n00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and of course,\n\n543\n00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.390\nthe product owner though does have\nthat liaison with the customers and\n\n544\n00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.700\nthe end users because they're the people\nthat are defining the requirements.\n\n545\n00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.710\nSo relationships and\n\n546\n00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:57.150\ncollaboration is really really\nimportant in our Agile environment.\n\n547\n00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:01.182\nAnd in our next episode we're going to\nbe looking a little bit further at that\n\n548\n00:29:01.182 --> 00:29:04.395\nbecause we're going to be looking\nat the Agile manifesto and\n\n549\n00:29:04.395 --> 00:29:05.784\nthe principles of Agile.\n\n550\n00:29:05.784 --> 00:29:09.758\nWhich again, is just a quick recap of\nour Agile fundamentals class, but it's\n\n551\n00:29:09.758 --> 00:29:14.230\nimportant that we understand this before\nwe can get into our testing methodologies.\n\n552\n00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.147\n&gt;&gt; I think that was a great intro and\n\n553\n00:29:16.147 --> 00:29:19.065\njust a really nice way to\nhelp freshen my memory.\n\n554\n00:29:19.065 --> 00:29:22.131\nAnd I was kind of surprised, I remembered\nmore than I thought I would Jo, so\n\n555\n00:29:22.131 --> 00:29:23.118\nI'm looking forward.\n\n556\n00:29:23.118 --> 00:29:23.940\n&gt;&gt; I was impressed.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.\n\n557\n00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.370\nLooking forward to\nlearning more from you and\n\n558\n00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.880\nhopefully you'll be able to join us\nas well, but for now let's sign out.\n\n559\n00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.370\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n560\n00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:32.230\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n561\n00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.903\n&gt;&gt; See

going, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.720\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.290\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n13\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.260\nWe looked at the last episode,\nwe looked at the lifecycle of Agile,\n\n14\n00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.900\nwe did some recap,\nI remembered more than I thought I would.\n\n15\n00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.470\nSo what are we going to be\nlooking at here in this show?\n\n16\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.544\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's really well,\nI [INAUDIBLE] last episode.\n\n17\n00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is only the first,\ndon't jinx me going forward here.\n\n18\n00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:49.014\nIt's the only first show.\n\n19\n00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:51.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're going to get a little\nbit more in depth right now.\n\n20\n00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:54.770\nBut yes, I thought you did\nabsolutely exceptional with that.\n\n21\n00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.136\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Clearly,\n\n22\n00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:58.240\nyou've been watching the previous episode.\n\n23\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm waiting for my gold sticker.\n\n24\n00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.241\nThose little stars?\n&gt;&gt; No, don't do that.\n\n25\n00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:04.633\nNo, we're British,\nwe give out Blue Peter badges.\n\n26\n00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:05.713\nYou'll have to Google that.\n\n27\n00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:06.618\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n28\n00:01:06.618 --> 00:01:10.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right then,\nin our last episode, like you said,\n\n29\n00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:15.230\nwe actually looked at Agile itself and\nwe looked at the life of an iteration.\n\n30\n00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.137\nAnd exactly what happens\nduring an iteration, and\n\n31\n00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:21.659\nhow long we would expect an iteration,\nor a sprint, to take.\n\n32\n00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.061\nIt depends on which\nmethodology you're using.\n\n33\n00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:29.880\nAgile is not a methodology,\nAgile is just a term that we use to\n\n34\n00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.370\ndescribe a number of methodologies for\ndelivering projects.\n\n35\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.960\nAnd an Agile method means a project that\n\n36\n00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.918\nis subject to what we\ncall continuous delivery.\n\n37\n00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:46.280\nIn other words a project that is being\ndelivered on an incremental basis.\n\n38\n00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.180\nSo all iterations or sprints are between\none and four weeks in length and\n\n39\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.710\nwe might be releasing every\ncouple of months, for instance.\n\n40\n00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.060\nSo Agile is actually\n\n41\n00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.810\na framework that we would use to\ndescribe a number of methodologies.\n\n42\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.243\nAnd if you want to know more about these\ntypes of methodologies such as Kanban or\n\n43\n00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:08.493\nScrum, which is where we\nget the word sprint from.\n\n44\n00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:13.019\nThen please take a look at\nour Agile fundamental series,\n\n45\n00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.710\nand we can explain a lot\nmore about that there.\n\n46\n00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.690\nBut, what I want to jot to your\nattention first of all, and\n\n47\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.240\nthis is just a recap of fundamentals,\nis our Agile manifesto.\n\n48\n00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.470\nAnd our Agile manifesto is really,\nI guess how, we're going to\n\n49\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.520\nlook at the principles in a moment,\nbut this is what we work towards.\n\n50\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.830\nThese are our ethics, if you want,\nfor use of a better word.\n\n51\n00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.695\nProject management,\nin fact anything within IT,\n\n52\n00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:48.250\ncan get really get bogged down\nin the admin, the red tape.\n\n53\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.460\n&gt;&gt; The bureaucratic side of things?\n\n54\n00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.772\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the bureaucracy,\nall of the paper work, and\n\n55\n00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:57.050\nall the things that we can't stand doing,\nlet's face it.\n\n56\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.560\nI don't like doing people work.\n\n57\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.660\nI'm the world's.\n\n58\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.838\nNo, I shouldn't stand here and\nsay I'm the world's worst, should I?\n\n59\n00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:03.881\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n\n60\n00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.496\nNo, you're not the world's worst, no.\n\n61\n00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:09.872\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, she's found\nsomebody that's worse, marginally.\n\n62\n00:03:09.872 --> 00:03:13.610\nBut we run away from it.\n\n63\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.570\nAnd as IT people,\nwe like to get on and do work, and\n\n64\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.950\nwe've looked, in various other series,\n\n65\n00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.790\nin various other topics, in things like\nITIL and other project management series.\n\n66\n00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.830\nWe looked at the fact that us IT people,\n\n67\n00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.690\nwe're not great at that sort of thing,\nwe like to be left to get on with things.\n\n68\n00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.850\nAnd we don't like the bureaucracy,\nwe really don't.\n\n69\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.320\nAnd so Agile accepts that we\ndon't like the bureaucracy, but\n\n70\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.290\nAgile also accepts we need some control.\n\n71\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.210\nSo we've got an Agile manifesto and\n\n72\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.960\nour manifesto literally are our\nethics to which we work.\n\n73\n00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.890\nAnd we can just take a quick\nlook at those right now.\n\n74\n00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.562\nAnd we see that we value,\nthese are our statement of values,\n\n75\n00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:03.388\nour ethics, we value individuals and\ninteractions over processes and tools.\n\n76\n00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:07.495\nThat doesn't mean that we\ndon't have any processes.\n\n77\n00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:09.190\nAnd it doesn't mean that\nwe don't have any tools.\n\n78\n00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.920\nI mean let's face it, we're in IT.\n\n79\n00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.430\n[LAUGH]\nWe're the people who go out and\n\n80\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.420\nfind the tools as well as built the tools.\n\n81\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.114\nIf there's gonna be a gadget that's gonna\nhelp us achieve something we're the people\n\n82\n00:04:21.114 --> 00:04:22.541\nthat are gonna find out, right?\n\n83\n00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean yes, yeah just look at me,\n\n84\n00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:27.120\nI'll be out there.\n\n85\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.010\nAnything that's new, guaranteed I'll have\nit within the first week [LAUGH] So,\n\n86\n00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.560\nwhat we're saying here is, though, that\nit's not the tools that are important.\n\n87\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.040\nIt's not the processes that are important.\n\n88\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.240\nWe actually value the individuals\nin the interactions over\n\n89\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.580\nthose processes and tools.\n\n90\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.830\nIt's our discussion between the two of us\n\n91\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.810\nthat's more important than\nthe rules that we're following.\n\n92\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.610\nThat's what it's saying.\n\n93\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.420\nIf you and I are talking, and, I mean,\n\n94\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.890\nlet's look at the environment\nthat we're in right now.\n\n95\n00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.000\nIf you and I are talking and\n\n96\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.540\nwe're having an interaction,\nyou're able to get information from me.\n\n97\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.230\nYou're able to ask me a question.\n\n98\n00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.850\nFor those of you that\nare watching out there,\n\n99\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.800\nyou're able to send me\na question via chat.\n\n100\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.520\nYou're able to ask questions and\nto seek clarification.\n\n101\n00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.040\nIf I tied you down to a rigid process and\nsaid this is the way that you do this,\n\n102\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.290\nthen where would your\nopportunity be to ask questions?\n\n103\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.130\nWhere would you get your value?\n\n104\n00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.652\nHave you ever called one of those service\ndesks, one of those call centers and\n\n105\n00:05:33.652 --> 00:05:36.570\nbeen met by somebody on the other end\nof the phone that follows a script?\n\n106\n00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.419\n&gt;&gt; Yes I have.\n\n107\n00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.548\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And how many glasses of wine\ndid you go through before you [CROSSTALK]\n\n108\n00:05:42.548 --> 00:05:43.344\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n109\n00:05:43.344 --> 00:05:47.196\nknowing how a lot of them operate.\n\n110\n00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:51.522\nI know that they have to go through\ncertain troubleshooting methods and\n\n111\n00:05:51.522 --> 00:05:55.720\ndocument that before moving\non to escalate the situation.\n\n112\n00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.130\nAnd I've already tried those\ntroubleshooting methods and\n\n113\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.720\nI'm trying to expedite it.\n\n114\n00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.920\nAnd a lot them stick to the script.\n\n115\n00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.740\nVery seldom do you get someone\nto acknowledge that hey,\n\n116\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.976\nmaybe we should go ahead and\nescalate this caller situation.\n\n117\n00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:14.478\n&gt;&gt; Right, and they are not able to\ndeviate from the script, the ones,\n\n118\n00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:15.714\nhave you turned it off?\n\n119\n00:06:15.714 --> 00:06:21.090\nNo, no, I work in IT, trust me,\nwell you need to turn it off.\n\n120\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.761\nAnd that's because it's in the script.\n\n121\n00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:27.677\nIt's not because they're being sort of-\n&gt;&gt; Right, because it will alleviate\n\n122\n00:06:27.677 --> 00:06:32.270\nmost problems that other\npeople may be facing.\n\n123\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.100\n&gt;&gt; It's in their script, and\nthey've got to follow their script.\n\n124\n00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.340\nWhat we're saying, and\n\n125\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.710\nwe've got to put this in a project\nmanagement perspective as well.\n\n126\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.086\nWhat we're saying here with this Agile\nManifesto is the fact that, okay, it might\n\n127\n00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:47.288\nbe in our process that you've got to\nupdate your Gantt chart every single hour.\n\n128\n00:06:47.288 --> 00:06:49.331\nBut how long are you spending doing that?\n\n129\n00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:55.375\nAnd that's valuable time when we could\nbe discussing a solution, for instance.\n\n130\n00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:59.865\nAnd that's why the next value,\nif we look at our next ethic,\n\n131\n00:06:59.865 --> 00:07:03.255\nwhich is working software over\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n132\n00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.915\nThat's exactly why we value\nthe working software.\n\n133\n00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:07.255\nWhat we wanna see is results.\n\n134\n00:07:09.135 --> 00:07:11.785\nThe word comprehensive,\nthough, should be underlined.\n\n135\n00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:16.920\nBecause we value software over\ncomprehensive documentation.\n\n136\n00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.540\nI am not telling you that we\ndo not document in Agile.\n\n137\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.570\nThis is one of the biggest\nmisconceptions about Agile.\n\n138\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.450\nI will quite often get\npeople that will say to me,\n\n139\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.240\nyou don't like documentation in Agile?\n\n140\n00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.490\nOr we don't do any documentation in Agile.\n\n141\n00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.380\nNo, that's absolute rubbish.\n\n142\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.453\nYes we do, do documentation in Agile.\n\n143\n00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut what we don't do is\nadd in the bureaucracy,\n\n144\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.594\nwe want efficient documentation.\n\n145\n00:07:45.594 --> 00:07:51.146\nLet's take a look at the Kanban board and\nthe use of post-it notes or sticky notes.\n\n146\n00:07:51.146 --> 00:07:55.235\nIf you've got a board, a white board,\nand you've got it split into the three,\n\n147\n00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:59.385\nyou've got it split into the work to do,\nthe stories that are to do, the ones that\n\n148\n00:07:59.385 --> 00:08:03.560\nare currently being done or in progress,\nand the ones that have been completed.\n\n149\n00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.400\nAm I going to document all of that and\n\n150\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.336\nget it into a Gantt chart, and\ntake the time to document that.\n\n151\n00:08:11.336 --> 00:08:14.129\nAnd to then go into my Gantt chart and\n\n152\n00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:17.681\nthen update the status\non a particular task.\n\n153\n00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:20.790\nAnd then assign maybe new release dates or\nsomething?\n\n154\n00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:26.350\nOr am I going to walk up to a board,\ntake that sticky note from one part and\n\n155\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.890\nthen put it into another section,\nwhat am I going to do?\n\n156\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.026\n&gt;&gt; Walk over to the board and\nmove it over.\n\n157\n00:08:34.026 --> 00:08:36.338\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's not because we're lazy,\n\n158\n00:08:36.338 --> 00:08:39.670\nit's just simply because that's\nthe most efficient thing to do.\n\n159\n00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.250\nBut what you can do is you can take\na photo of that board and you can say,\n\n160\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.242\nright, okay, this is my status update.\n\n161\n00:08:49.242 --> 00:08:55.540\nAnd there are so many tools out there now\nthat will do the handwriting recognition.\n\n162\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.096\nAnd they'll convert that into a PDF that\nyou can then attach to something else if\n\n163\n00:09:00.096 --> 00:09:00.850\nyou want to.\n\n164\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.610\nThe simple fact is that\nwe need documentation,\n\n165\n00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.480\nwe need to monitor progress, but\nit shouldn't be bureaucratic.\n\n166\n00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.520\nAnd then we talk about customer\ncollaboration over contract negotiation\n\n167\n00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.510\nas our next value or our ethic.\n\n168\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:20.160\nSo when you think of the word contract,\nwhat's the first thing that you think of?\n\n169\n00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.643\n&gt;&gt; Black and white signature, legally\nbinding, I know you said first thing,\n\n170\n00:09:23.643 --> 00:09:25.886\nI don't know,\nthat was just a number of things.\n\n171\n00:09:25.886 --> 00:09:27.257\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:09:27.257 --> 00:09:28.579\n&gt;&gt; The first thing that you think of with\n\n173\n00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:29.910\na contract, yeah, you're right.\n\n174\n00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.340\nIt's legally binding,\nit's written down very specifically,\n\n175\n00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.940\nand you have to adhere to\nthe terms of the contract.\n\n176\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.327\nIt's rigid, that's the word that\nI would use with a contract, and\n\n177\n00:09:41.327 --> 00:09:45.640\neven when you're negotiating a contract,\nonce it's signed, it's rigid.\n\n178\n00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.570\nSo that's why we value customer\ncollaboration over contract negotiation.\n\n179\n00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.610\nBecause quite simply,\neven if it's written down,\n\n180\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.040\nthink back to that script again,\nthat the call centers use.\n\n181\n00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.890\nIf it's written down and you must follow\nit, because that's in your contract of\n\n182\n00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.790\nemployment, then you're not\ngoing to deviate from that.\n\n183\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.600\nAnd yeah, you might never get\nto the bottom of the issue\n\n184\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.940\nbecause you're not collaborating.\n\n185\n00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.870\nAnd so we want to collaborate with our\ncustomers, we want to have a conversation.\n\n186\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.640\nAnd we don't want to be hindered and\n\n187\n00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.220\nconstrained by contracts, that's not\nto say we cannot have contracts.\n\n188\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.610\nNo, but we value collaborations,\nwe value the interpersonal side of things.\n\n189\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.120\nAnd then responding to change\nover following a plan,\n\n190\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.890\nthis is not to say that we don't\nhave plans, again, we do have plans.\n\n191\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.800\nThings change, life changes,\nthe business changes,\n\n192\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.330\nour organization changes,\nour direction changes.\n\n193\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.800\nWhat we're trying to achieve will change,\nand I don't know how many times.\n\n194\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.570\nProbably countless times that I've heard\nin organizations where somebody has gone\n\n195\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.990\nto the project manager.\n\n196\n00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.976\nGenerally a business relationship manager,\nand have said, okay,\n\n197\n00:11:01.976 --> 00:11:03.630\nthe business has changed direction.\n\n198\n00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.496\nWe've got this merger coming up and\nwe want to implement this.\n\n199\n00:11:06.496 --> 00:11:09.120\nAnd the project manager has\nturned around and said, no,\n\n200\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.480\nyou'll have to wait until\nwe deliver the product.\n\n201\n00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.860\nAnd then you'll have to submit\na request for change, an RFC.\n\n202\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.310\nThat may even be a new project, or\nit may be done as just an update.\n\n203\n00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.924\nBut you'll have to submit this RFC,\nand then we'll get around to it,\n\n204\n00:11:23.924 --> 00:11:26.080\nI've heard that countless times.\n\n205\n00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.230\nAnd that can be something that\nhappens with the waterfall approach.\n\n206\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.756\nI actually like to think that\neven with the waterfall approach,\n\n207\n00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:35.410\nwe should be flexible.\n\n208\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.407\nBut nevertheless, the waterfall\napproaches can be quite rigid, but\n\n209\n00:11:38.407 --> 00:11:39.435\nthey have their place.\n\n210\n00:11:39.435 --> 00:11:43.883\nAnd here in Agile, because we're\nlooking at continual delivery,\n\n211\n00:11:43.883 --> 00:11:49.120\nwe're able to accept change more readily,\nwe're able to accommodate it.\n\n212\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.500\nBecause it can be accommodated\ninto the subsequent iteration or\n\n213\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.950\nthe one after that or\neven the one after that.\n\n214\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.100\nBecause we're able to see change visibly,\n\n215\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.380\nbecause we're using one of those\nboards with all the sticky notes on.\n\n216\n00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.020\nSo these are our values, or you might\nwant to think of them as our ethics.\n\n217\n00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.090\nAnd what we have are the 12\nprinciples of Agile\n\n218\n00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.750\nthat underpin those ethics and\nthose values.\n\n219\n00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.160\nAnd I want you really to concentrate\non what's being highlighted in\n\n220\n00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.350\nthe purple there.\n\n221\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.570\nIt's about satisfying that customer,\nearly and\n\n222\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.060\ncontinuous delivery of valuable software.\n\n223\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:30.250\nWe had a discussion in our last\nepisode where we looked at\n\n224\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.170\nthe value to a customer of\nthe frequency of our delivery.\n\n225\n00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And the frequency of software releases.\n\n226\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.831\nIf you get your software, if you get\na software update every single week,\n\n227\n00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:46.398\nthen you're going to get\npretty annoyed with that.\n\n228\n00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:50.052\nBut if you've got a software update\nevery single month that is huge,\n\n229\n00:12:50.052 --> 00:12:52.390\nyou're going to get annoyed by that, too.\n\n230\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.905\nYou've got to get that balance right.\n\n231\n00:12:54.905 --> 00:12:59.966\nWe've got to welcome a second one that's\na welcoming changing environment,\n\n232\n00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:03.198\nand working changing,\nif I could get my teeth in.\n\n233\n00:13:03.198 --> 00:13:05.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Welcoming changing\n\n234\n00:13:05.554 --> 00:13:10.271\nrequirements, I've already said,\nthings change, you cannot,\n\n235\n00:13:10.271 --> 00:13:12.680\nwe're in the 21st century now.\n\n236\n00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.160\nAnd you can't just simply turn around and\nsay, no,\n\n237\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.030\nwe've got to stick to this rigid plan.\n\n238\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.120\nBecause at the end of the day,\n\n239\n00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.730\nthat's not how IT works, everything in\nIT is geared towards rapid change now.\n\n240\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.300\nEverything changes, our operating\nsystems change on a regular basis.\n\n241\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.980\nOur functionality of any of our\ndevices changes on a regular basis,\n\n242\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.620\nwe've got to think about\nthe customer's competitive advantage.\n\n243\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.080\nAnd it doesn't matter what\ntheir environment is,\n\n244\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.290\neven when we're talking\nabout maybe the military.\n\n245\n00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:49.670\nWhen we're talking about government\ndepartments, we still need to be current.\n\n246\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.700\nWe can't afford to be using\ntechnology that is ten years old,\n\n247\n00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.450\nwe just simply can't, whether it comes.\n\n248\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.031\nI mean,\n\n249\n00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:03.761\nhow would you like it if you're tax was\ncalculated by the government department.\n\n250\n00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:08.030\nWhose services haven't been updated for\nthe last ten, 15 years?\n\n251\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.918\nYou wouldn't feel very comfortable and\nyou'd probably think you were paying too\n\n252\n00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:14.635\nmuch tax, well, I would,\n[LAUGH], I'm sure you would.\n\n253\n00:14:14.635 --> 00:14:15.159\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:18.929\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we have to make\nsure that we're current, and\n\n255\n00:14:18.929 --> 00:14:24.320\nthat our organization is current,\nno matter what that organization is.\n\n256\n00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.413\nI mean,\nimagine you're going to a hospital and\n\n257\n00:14:26.413 --> 00:14:28.200\ntheir IT is 15 years out of date [LAUGH].\n\n258\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.819\n&gt;&gt; Man, [LAUGH].\n\n259\n00:14:29.819 --> 00:14:33.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we've got to make\nsure that we remain current, and\n\n260\n00:14:33.465 --> 00:14:35.980\nthat we welcome changing requirements.\n\n261\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:41.290\nQuite often, when the instances that\nI gave you then in hopsitals and\n\n262\n00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.180\nin government departments.\n\n263\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.010\nWe don't accommodate change very easily,\n\n264\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.410\nbecause that's quite a large thing to do,\nand it's a large undertaking.\n\n265\n00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.440\nBut we're saying, yeah,\n\n266\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.500\nyou need to, and that's why we\ndeliver working software frequently.\n\n267\n00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.040\nIf you don't, simple as that,\n\n268\n00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.690\nyour customers are going to go\nsomewhere else, they really are.\n\n269\n00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.966\nBusinesspeople and\ndevelopers must work together daily.\n\n270\n00:15:08.966 --> 00:15:15.290\nNumber 4, [LAUGH], how many developers do\nyou know that could talk to the business?\n\n271\n00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.190\n&gt;&gt; I will say out of all of\nthe hosts that we are looking for\n\n272\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.150\nhere at ITPRO.TV when we bring\nin subject matter experts.\n\n273\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.850\nThere's always a difficult\ntime finding developers who,\n\n274\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.020\nand it's not because they\nare bad at their job, no.\n\n275\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.120\nWe know a lot of really\nawesome developers, but\n\n276\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.720\nit's just the interaction\nthat they don't care for.\n\n277\n00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.680\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthere is nothing wrong with that.\n\n278\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.036\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; There really isn't anything wrong with\n\n279\n00:15:42.036 --> 00:15:44.283\nthat, and\nI always liken this to languages.\n\n280\n00:15:44.283 --> 00:15:48.130\nAnd our developers talk one language,\nand our business talk another language.\n\n281\n00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.970\nAnd invariably, neither one of them can\ntalk the other's language, [LAUGH].\n\n282\n00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.293\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's true, it's true, and\n\n283\n00:15:53.293 --> 00:15:56.400\nwe can laugh about it, and\nwe do, in IT, we laugh about it.\n\n284\n00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.008\n&gt;&gt; We laugh about everybody,\nourselves included, so yeah.\n\n285\n00:16:00.008 --> 00:16:02.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So our developers,\n\n286\n00:16:02.641 --> 00:16:06.722\nquite often you think I'm not\nputting them in front of a customer.\n\n287\n00:16:06.722 --> 00:16:09.763\nBut we need to have somebody\nthere as a mediator,\n\n288\n00:16:09.763 --> 00:16:13.176\nmaybe in a business partner or\na business relationship\n\n289\n00:16:13.176 --> 00:16:18.190\nmanagement role that can act as that\nmediator between IT and the customer.\n\n290\n00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.850\nSo that they can act as, well,\nnot a mediator, but a translator.\n\n291\n00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.289\nBut the fact is that is if we're\ndelivering software to our business,\n\n292\n00:16:26.289 --> 00:16:31.116\nwe need to be getting off our backside and\ngoing and talking to our business.\n\n293\n00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.628\nIt's as simple as that.\n&gt;&gt; Finding out what they need,\n\n294\n00:16:32.628 --> 00:16:34.361\nwhat they want, what they currently have.\n\n295\n00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:36.850\nIs it gonna be compatible\nwith the new integration?\n\n296\n00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:37.820\nJust things like that.\n\n297\n00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.130\n&gt;&gt; We can't expect our business\nto articulate their needs.\n\n298\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.870\nThey're not going to, but\nthey don't know what they want.\n\n299\n00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.861\nInvariably what they come\nup with is a solution,\n\n300\n00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:47.962\nbecause they don't know\nwhat they what they want.\n\n301\n00:16:47.962 --> 00:16:51.130\nAnd so they come up to us and\nthey're gonna say, I want an iPad.\n\n302\n00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.840\nBut that's not a solution for anything.\n\n303\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.580\nWhat that is is just a knee-jerk reaction\nbecause they don't know what to ask for.\n\n304\n00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.765\nSo we've gotta let our developers\ntalk to our business, and\n\n305\n00:17:04.765 --> 00:17:10.113\nmake sure that they do actually get out\nthere and talk to our business as well.\n\n306\n00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:11.151\nI love number five.\n\n307\n00:17:11.151 --> 00:17:14.408\nBuilding projects around motivated\nindividuals and giving them\n\n308\n00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:17.851\nthe environment and the support they\nneed and then leave them alone.\n\n309\n00:17:17.851 --> 00:17:21.167\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No micromanaging here.\n\n310\n00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:23.162\n&gt;&gt; And it says,\ntrust them to get the job done.\n\n311\n00:17:23.162 --> 00:17:25.570\nI much prefer leave them alone, right?\n\n312\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:29.928\nI think that makes the point a lot clearer\nthan just trust them to get the job done.\n\n313\n00:17:29.928 --> 00:17:33.178\nEmpowering people.\n\n314\n00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:38.075\nI don't know about you, I'm guessing\nyou're pretty much the same as I am.\n\n315\n00:17:38.075 --> 00:17:39.905\nIf I've got somebody micromanaging me.\n\n316\n00:17:39.905 --> 00:17:43.025\nIf I've got somebody who's on\nmy back every five minutes.\n\n317\n00:17:43.025 --> 00:17:46.377\nI'm probably gonna be the one that's\ngonna walk out and say, do you know what?\n\n318\n00:17:46.377 --> 00:17:48.177\nDo it, go on, fine.\n\n319\n00:17:48.177 --> 00:17:49.977\n&gt;&gt; If you want it done\nyour way then do it.\n\n320\n00:17:49.977 --> 00:17:51.207\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Do it yourself.\n\n321\n00:17:51.207 --> 00:17:51.732\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n322\n00:17:51.732 --> 00:17:53.997\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't micromanage people.\n\n323\n00:17:53.997 --> 00:17:58.727\nThat really is the key to\nsuccessful agile projects,\n\n324\n00:17:58.727 --> 00:18:01.767\nis that you'll give somebody a task to do.\n\n325\n00:18:01.767 --> 00:18:02.862\nLeave them.\n\n326\n00:18:02.862 --> 00:18:05.837\nTheir way of working might\nnot be conventional.\n\n327\n00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:10.786\nIt may not be the way that you do things,\nbut what's important is the result.\n\n328\n00:18:10.786 --> 00:18:15.877\nRemember, the documentation,\nit's gotta be there but\n\n329\n00:18:15.877 --> 00:18:21.100\nthe processes themselves,\nthey can be flexible.\n\n330\n00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.460\nSo just because they don't work the same\nway that you do doesn't mean that they're\n\n331\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.290\ndoing it wrong.\n\n332\n00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.260\nTrust, leave them alone.\n\n333\n00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.050\nAnd then the obvious one, number six.\n\n334\n00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.950\nI like to think of this one as\nthe obvious principle, because it is.\n\n335\n00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:41.153\nThe most efficient and\neffective way is to talk to somebody.\n\n336\n00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:42.770\nFace-to-face conversation.\n\n337\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.249\nIt doesn't have to be the same room,\nit could be over the telephone,\n\n338\n00:18:47.249 --> 00:18:49.115\nit could be over video chat.\n\n339\n00:18:49.115 --> 00:18:51.040\nBut face-to-face conversation.\n\n340\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.370\nI'd hate to think how many times I had\nmisread an email or misread a text.\n\n341\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.260\nAnd just looked at it and\nthought, how dare you,\n\n342\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.627\nand then realized that they\ndidn't quite mean it like that.\n\n343\n00:19:02.627 --> 00:19:06.506\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's true.\nThere's so much that can be determined\n\n344\n00:19:06.506 --> 00:19:12.800\nfrom just fluctuation of tone and any kind\nof cadence and pause or lack thereof.\n\n345\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:19.170\nAnd you and\nI kind of had an opportunity to move from,\n\n346\n00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.690\nI don't even know if this is like\na formal thing, but it was more,\n\n347\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.920\nin the past we saw a more structured and\ntraditional type of communication,\n\n348\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.380\nvery formal emails to be exchanged.\n\n349\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.810\nNow I use emojis in my emails.\n\n350\n00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.319\nI don't know if you do,\nJo, because I'm a little-\n\n351\n00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.\n\n352\n00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.230\n&gt;&gt; But I mean, just to convey the tone so\nthat people kind of,\n\n353\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:42.700\nI make sure that they're understanding\nwhat it is I'm trying to say.\n\n354\n00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.670\nI know that's crazy, I would never ever\nthink to put an emoji in a work email but\n\n355\n00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.330\nI've done it and I do it often.\n\n356\n00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.038\n&gt;&gt; I do it all the time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n357\n00:19:50.038 --> 00:19:52.063\n&gt;&gt; And I communicate with CIOs,\n\n358\n00:19:52.063 --> 00:19:57.655\nI communicate with senior executives and\ngovernment sort of ministers and that.\n\n359\n00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.485\nAnd I use emojis all the time.\n\n360\n00:19:59.485 --> 00:20:01.895\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n361\n00:20:01.895 --> 00:20:03.960\n&gt;&gt; Back in my day, because I'm so old.\n\n362\n00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n363\n00:20:05.085 --> 00:20:10.365\nback in my day, you would have been told\nwhen I was sort of first coming into IT.\n\n364\n00:20:10.365 --> 00:20:11.325\nThat's not professional.\n\n365\n00:20:11.325 --> 00:20:11.835\nYou don't do-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n366\n00:20:11.835 --> 00:20:12.880\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n367\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.872\nBut we've gotta start thinking\nabout what's more important.\n\n368\n00:20:16.872 --> 00:20:21.690\nIs it more important to\nadhere to a specific sort\n\n369\n00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.100\nof formality or is it more important\nto get your message across?\n\n370\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.798\nAnd really, what we're interested in\nis actually getting the job done.\n\n371\n00:20:28.798 --> 00:20:32.970\nNow, I mean, sure, you don't wanna be\nusing profanities and things like that.\n\n372\n00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.593\n&gt;&gt; Or sending an entire email in emoji so\n\n373\n00:20:35.593 --> 00:20:38.735\nthey have to decipher\nit like a secret code.\n\n374\n00:20:38.735 --> 00:20:41.625\n&gt;&gt; I've got a 26-year-old that does that.\n\n375\n00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:44.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I have a rule.\n\n376\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.156\nI have a rule.\n\n377\n00:20:46.156 --> 00:20:47.785\nAt least write it in English.\n\n378\n00:20:47.785 --> 00:20:50.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; All of this shorthand and emojis and\n\n379\n00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.180\nstuff like that,\nwhat do you expect me to do with that?\n\n380\n00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.310\nBut ultimately,\ndon't think about the formality,\n\n381\n00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.130\nthink about what's gonna be the most\nefficient to get your message across.\n\n382\n00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.340\nAnd talking to somebody face-to-face\nis gonna be more efficient\n\n383\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.350\nthan reading an email.\n\n384\n00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.210\nAnd let's face it, and\n\n385\n00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:11.700\nI'll talk about this when we look\nat service management as well.\n\n386\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.670\nHave you ever gone to a movie and\nyou've read the book beforehand and\n\n387\n00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.430\nthen you've gone to the cinema and\nwatched the film and you've thought,\n\n388\n00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.780\nwell that's not what is says in the book.\n\n389\n00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's usually a let down [LAUGH].\n\n390\n00:21:22.369 --> 00:21:23.843\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because we have this expectation\n\n391\n00:21:23.843 --> 00:21:25.160\nof what we think it should be.\n\n392\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.730\n&gt;&gt; Because we've read the book and\nwe've put our interpretation on it.\n\n393\n00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.550\nBut the person that's directing or\nproducing the movie,\n\n394\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.030\nthey've read the book and they've put\ntheir interpretation on it as well.\n\n395\n00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:38.415\nAnd that's the problem with the written\nword is, it can be interpreted.\n\n396\n00:21:38.415 --> 00:21:43.447\nFace-to-face communication,\nnot really open to interpretation.\n\n397\n00:21:43.447 --> 00:21:47.085\nSo then let's look at our next six then,\nour principles.\n\n398\n00:21:47.085 --> 00:21:50.700\nWorking software is the primary\nmeasure of progress.\n\n399\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.250\nThis is not just about\nputting ticks in boxes,\n\n400\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.980\nthis is about actually\ndelivering something.\n\n401\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.000\nAnd progress is when you deliver\nsomething, it's a simple as that.\n\n402\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.930\nThis shouldn't need any more explanation.\n\n403\n00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.670\nAnd then we talk about\nsustainable development.\n\n404\n00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.748\nDevelopment is not something\nthat's just a one-off exercise.\n\n405\n00:22:10.748 --> 00:22:13.730\nYou've got to be able\nto sustain that pace.\n\n406\n00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:19.410\nAnd that's why, in an agile project,\nwe measure out our user stories and\n\n407\n00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.830\nwe work out, we estimate exactly how\nlong each story is going to take.\n\n408\n00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.150\nAnd then we deliver\niterations on a regular or\n\n409\n00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:32.780\nsustainable manner,\nin a sustainable format.\n\n410\n00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:38.211\nThinking about your schedule and ensuring\nthat we deliver on a regular basis.\n\n411\n00:22:38.211 --> 00:22:44.716\nAnd then we look at attention to\ntechnical detail and good design.\n\n412\n00:22:44.716 --> 00:22:48.557\nGet it right first time, simple as that.\n\n413\n00:22:48.557 --> 00:22:53.285\nI mean, what else can I say, attention\nto technical detail and good design,\n\n414\n00:22:53.285 --> 00:22:55.370\nget it right first time.\n\n415\n00:22:55.370 --> 00:23:00.280\nBecause then you shouldn't, well, it's not\nefficient to actually have to do it again.\n\n416\n00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.840\nYou shouldn't have to do it again.\n\n417\n00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.550\nAnd I love the simplicity,\nmaximizing the work not done.\n\n418\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.610\nIf you don't need it,\nwhy are you developing it?\n\n419\n00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:15.810\nI don't know about you, I love my gadgets.\n\n420\n00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.350\nI will be the one that will be\nqueuing up outside the Apple Store for\n\n421\n00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.010\nthe latest gadget.\n\n422\n00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.790\nAnd that's only because I can't wait for\nthe Postal Service to actually bring it to\n\n423\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.630\nme, because they're not going to be\nthere at 5 o'clock in the morning.\n\n424\n00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.870\nSo I'll be the one that's queuing\nup outside the Apple Store for\n\n425\n00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.240\nthe latest gadget.\n\n426\n00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.390\nAnd how many of those\nfeatures do I actually use?\n\n427\n00:23:36.629 --> 00:23:39.238\nAbout 20%, maybe?\n\n428\n00:23:39.238 --> 00:23:43.220\nSo these guys have developed all\nof these wonderful features and\n\n429\n00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:48.120\nall of this functionality and\ndo you know what, I'm not gonna use it.\n\n430\n00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.950\nAnd it's exactly the same thing.\n\n431\n00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.550\nThat's what we're talking\nabout with number ten,\n\n432\n00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.930\nmaximizing the amount of work not done.\n\n433\n00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.720\nDon't develop something\nthat's not going to be used.\n\n434\n00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.990\nIf it's not needed, then you shouldn't\nbe putting the amount of effort into it.\n\n435\n00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.560\nSimple as that.\n\n436\n00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.926\nI like number 11, and Justin,\none of our other hosts,\n\n437\n00:24:06.926 --> 00:24:09.873\nJustin and\nI were talking just a little while ago,\n\n438\n00:24:09.873 --> 00:24:14.580\nfunnily enough about self-organizing\nteams and about collaboration.\n\n439\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.800\nAnd about the fact that if you are in\nan environment that is dictatorial,\n\n440\n00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.870\nwhere you've got a very\ndefined hierarchy and\n\n441\n00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.920\nsomebody is managing and giving you\nyour tasks then that's not agile.\n\n442\n00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.970\nAgile is about us organizing ourselves.\n\n443\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.130\nIt's about me saying,\nyou're better at that can you do that and\n\n444\n00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.210\nI'm better at this, so I'll do this so\nwe're all okay with that.\n\n445\n00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.700\nThat's what agile is about.\n\n446\n00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.190\nAnd the regular levels\nif look at number 12,\n\n447\n00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:44.760\nat regular levels then the team\nreflects on how we can improve that.\n\n448\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.284\nSo we are open to the fact that\neven if we're self-organizing,\n\n449\n00:24:48.284 --> 00:24:52.199\nwe're still not gonna be the most\nefficient that we can possibly be, so\n\n450\n00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:54.961\nwe're gonna adjust that\nbehavior accordingly.\n\n451\n00:24:54.961 --> 00:24:58.095\nAnd we're gonna say, you know what,\nthat didn't go too well so\n\n452\n00:24:58.095 --> 00:25:00.520\nlet's do it different next time.\n\n453\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.273\n&gt;&gt; So I might not be in the show for the\nnext episode, is that what you're saying?\n\n454\n00:25:04.273 --> 00:25:07.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what I'm saying is, I'm sorry but\nit's just, Justin next time.\n\n455\n00:25:07.264 --> 00:25:09.159\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What can I say,\n\n456\n00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:11.190\nyeah he's a pretty funny guy.\n\n457\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I don't think we get\nanything covered though.\n\n458\n00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.790\nThis could be a problem.\n\n459\n00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.220\nSo lets look then at out\nthree pillars of Agile.\n\n460\n00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:25.290\nAnd again, I want you to think\nthese in terms of ethics and\n\n461\n00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:30.330\nthink about the fact that well,\nwe go to inspect.\n\n462\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.650\nI will start off with inspection even\nthough that's in the middle because I\n\n463\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.340\nreally like inspection.\n\n464\n00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.250\nInspection is really about you\njust monitoring what we are doing,\n\n465\n00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.360\nand inspecting everything\nthat we do frequently.\n\n466\n00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:48.480\nAnd then making adoptions or\nadaptations base on what we've inspected.\n\n467\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.030\nAnd key to all of this\nis that transparency.\n\n468\n00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:56.390\nTransparency is making sure\nthat we all open and honest.\n\n469\n00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:02.580\nAnd everyone that needs to\ncan see exactly where we are,\n\n470\n00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.730\nwhether with a particular user story and\n\n471\n00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.450\nthat everybody has input into\nthat user story as well.\n\n472\n00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.900\nAnd in our daily stand up meetings\nwe have good place for that too.\n\n473\n00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.350\nBut so are our visual boards,\n\n474\n00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.910\nour count bound boards again\nit all promotes transparency.\n\n475\n00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.480\nSo we looked previously\nin our last episode at\n\n476\n00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:29.050\nthe roles that we have within Agile and\nwe've got two roles within Agile.\n\n477\n00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.240\nWe've got the scrum master and\nthe product owner.\n\n478\n00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.410\nAnd of course, the product owner is\nresponsible for the actual product itself.\n\n479\n00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.330\nThey make the decisions on what\nit is we're going to deliver and\n\n480\n00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.370\nthe scrum master, well, they manage all\nof the interpersonal side of things and\n\n481\n00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.600\nall of the admin and any bureaucracy etc.\n\n482\n00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.970\nBut then we've got all\nthe members of the team as well.\n\n483\n00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:55.230\nSo you've got people like testers,\nyou've got developers themselves.\n\n484\n00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:59.124\nYou've got, I mean, there is a question\nmark there next to the word, all those,\n\n485\n00:26:59.124 --> 00:27:00.705\nbecause you've got customers,\n\n486\n00:27:00.705 --> 00:27:03.602\nyou've got user,\nyou've got external third parties etc.\n\n487\n00:27:03.602 --> 00:27:08.382\nAnd the fact of the matter is that, all of\nthose, all of those have a responsibility\n\n488\n00:27:08.382 --> 00:27:11.790\nfor quality,\nabsolutely every single one of them.\n\n489\n00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:18.440\nAnd so, every single one of these people\nshould be involved in the Agile team.\n\n490\n00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.840\nWe shouldn't think of our\nAgile team as just, well,\n\n491\n00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.550\na select few and\neverybody else is outside of Agile.\n\n492\n00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:31.696\nIf somebody's got an input into a project\nthey're just as responsible for\n\n493\n00:27:31.696 --> 00:27:34.563\nquality as any developer and any tester.\n\n494\n00:27:34.563 --> 00:27:36.675\nAnd that brings us onto the tester role.\n\n495\n00:27:38.498 --> 00:27:41.550\nAnd really this particular slide is\njust sort of a pause for thought.\n\n496\n00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:46.110\nBefore in our next episode,\nwe start looking at Agile testing.\n\n497\n00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:52.030\nAnd really I just want you to think right\nnow about what testers actually do,\n\n498\n00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.950\nand what skill sets they need\nto be able to do their work.\n\n499\n00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.640\nWe could be talking about testing\nof the actual functionality itself,\n\n500\n00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.670\nin which case then they probably\nneed to have a user mindset because\n\n501\n00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.380\nthey're gonna be using it\nfrom a user perspective.\n\n502\n00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:11.150\nBut they may actually be testing specific\ncode in which case then they'll need to be\n\n503\n00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:15.750\ndevelopers, and they'll need\nto have a development mindset.\n\n504\n00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:22.350\nSo we need to think about what skills we\nneed depending on what we want the tester\n\n505\n00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:26.970\nto perform, what test they want to do, and\nalso we their collaboration will be with.\n\n506\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:32.190\nBecause when we talk about who\nshould they collaborate with you've\n\n507\n00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.330\ngot to think about\nexternal people as well.\n\n508\n00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:40.906\nAnd that's important, because we've\ngot a limited number of weeks,\n\n509\n00:28:40.906 --> 00:28:48.041\nwe've got a limited time for every\nsingle sprint or every single iteration.\n\n510\n00:28:48.041 --> 00:28:49.010\nAnd in fact,\n\n511\n00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:54.835\nI was having a conservation with Don\nearlier on today about exactly this.\n\n512\n00:28:54.835 --> 00:29:00.275\nAnd the fact that if you are collaborating\nwith people outside of the organization,\n\n513\n00:29:00.275 --> 00:29:04.565\nwell, you gonna go a limited\nperiod of time within each sprint.\n\n514\n00:29:04.565 --> 00:29:06.940\nSo how you get those people organized?\n\n515\n00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.650\nIf one person is a third party and\nthey're doing some testing and\n\n516\n00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.860\nthen there's another third party\nthat's doing another piece of testing.\n\n517\n00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.140\nAnd you've only got two weeks to\ndeliberate particular iteration,\n\n518\n00:29:19.155 --> 00:29:23.035\nwell that sounds like to me that they\nreally got to get everything organize and\n\n519\n00:29:23.035 --> 00:29:25.285\nthey've really got to be\nworking to your timeline.\n\n520\n00:29:25.285 --> 00:29:29.015\nSo there's still a degree of\nmanagement involve in there.\n\n521\n00:29:29.015 --> 00:29:32.547\nWho do you think is responsible for\nmanaging the testers?\n\n522\n00:29:32.547 --> 00:29:36.227\n&gt;&gt; Managing the testers,\nI'm gonna go with the product owner.\n\n523\n00:29:36.227 --> 00:29:37.453\n&gt;&gt; No, managing the people.\n\n524\n00:29:37.453 --> 00:29:41.207\n&gt;&gt; Managing the people is going\nto be the actual scrub master.\n\n525\n00:29:41.207 --> 00:29:45.927\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the product owner take\nthe accountability for what gets tested.\n\n526\n00:29:45.927 --> 00:29:49.017\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was gonna say that\none's like close there, but\n\n527\n00:29:49.017 --> 00:29:51.451\nI know there's a difference\nbetween the people and the actual.\n\n528\n00:29:51.451 --> 00:29:54.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the scrum master is the\nperson that actually manages the people,\n\n529\n00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.280\nso they get all of the people involved.\n\n530\n00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.888\nNow, I know that in a previous session,\n\n531\n00:29:59.888 --> 00:30:04.050\nwe looked at sort of our daily\nstand ups and our scrum master etc.\n\n532\n00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.943\nWell, giving the scrum master to\nsomebody that is responsible for\n\n533\n00:30:07.943 --> 00:30:12.532\nmanaging collaboration, etc,\nthen sometimes, you don't really want your\n\n534\n00:30:12.532 --> 00:30:17.280\nscrum master to be somebody senior and\nsomebody high up, they don't have to be.\n\n535\n00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.690\nThis is not about hierarchy,\nthis is not about a management position,\n\n536\n00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.490\nit's about somebody who's\nable to organize and\n\n537\n00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.520\nthat's what a scrum master is,\nis somebody who's able to organize.\n\n538\n00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.310\nSo I want us to think just lastly for\nthis particular episode,\n\n539\n00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:36.920\nI want us to think about feedback loops,\nbecause this is critical to testing.\n\n540\n00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.490\nBecause what we do is we test.\n\n541\n00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:44.340\nWe test a product from either a use\nperspective or from a coding perspective.\n\n542\n00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.480\nAnd then we have to give feedback\nto that particular developer.\n\n543\n00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.680\nNow we have discussed in our\nAgile fundamental series,\n\n544\n00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.520\nwe looked at paired development.\n\n545\n00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.850\nAnd the fact that with paid development,\n\n546\n00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.830\nyou never test your own work\nsomebody else test the work for you.\n\n547\n00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.353\nSo, I'll develop you would test,\nyou develop and I would test.\n\n548\n00:31:06.353 --> 00:31:11.253\nAnd that's part of our feedback loop, but\nwe get feed back from personal interaction\n\n549\n00:31:11.253 --> 00:31:15.607\nsuch as a daily scrum, and a team\ninteraction, but we also get feedback from\n\n550\n00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:19.690\nthe automated testing, and\nfrom a lot of out tools as well.\n\n551\n00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:24.100\nAnd so feedback is not just, I don't want\nus to think about this as just being\n\n552\n00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.950\nlimited to a conversation, or\nto an email, or a piece of paper.\n\n553\n00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:34.140\nFeedback is actually given to us\nin a variety of ways including\n\n554\n00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.930\nfrom automated testing too.\n\n555\n00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:39.990\nBecause feedback is just simply\nthe result from the automated testing.\n\n556\n00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.000\nSo for this particular episode,\nand in our last episode,\n\n557\n00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.890\nwhat we've really done is we've just\nrecapped over the Agile fundamentals.\n\n558\n00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.810\nWe've looked at the basics of Agile.\n\n559\n00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.930\nWe've looked at the iteration and\nthe sprints, and\n\n560\n00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.310\nnow we've looked at the Agile manifesto.\n\n561\n00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:00.610\nAnd so now what we're going to do in\na subsequent episode, in our next episode,\n\n562\n00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:04.540\nis we're going to look\nat testing quadrants.\n\n563\n00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:09.270\nWe're going to dip our toe further\ninto the testing water, and\n\n564\n00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.600\nsee where it takes us.\n\n565\n00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.830\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo,\nwell thank you so much for that.\n\n566\n00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:16.410\nWe're inching our way into that water,\nwe can't just go ahead and\n\n567\n00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.520\ndive in head first.\n\n568\n00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.600\nAlthough I know that\nsounds pretty refreshing.\n\n569\n00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.480\nWe're gonna take it step by step.\n\n570\n00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.980\nHopefully, Jo will be here with us,\nand hopefully I will be too.\n\n571\n00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.380\nThe way it was going in that last episode,\nshe said about those changes,\n\n572\n00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.490\nand remind me to make some, but-\n&gt;&gt; Well, we are in an Agile environment,\n\n573\n00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.900\nand we like to accommodate change,\neven at the last minute.\n\n574\n00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.515\n&gt;&gt; You're never never know.\n\n575\n00:32:40.515 --> 00:32:41.494\n&gt;&gt; That's right, guys.\n\n576\n00:32:41.494 --> 00:32:43.170\nBut for now let's sign out.\n\n577\n00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.510\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n578\n00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.146\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Joey Peacock.\n\n579\n00:32:45.146 --> 00:32:47.434\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n580\n00:32:47.434 --> 00:32:53.427\n[MUSIC]\n\n581\n00:32:53.427 --> 00:32:55.945\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.Tv.\n\n",

to your Agile Testing\nseries, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.420\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at the Agile quadrants.\n\n8\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.840\nAnd with us today in studios,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.230\nNow Jo, I know you assured us,\nor assured me, but\n\n10\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.640\ncan we get it verbally in the recording\nthat we're not gonna be doing any\n\n11\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.716\nmath in this episode?\n&gt;&gt; I promise.\n\n12\n00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:32.672\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n13\n00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:33.240\n&gt;&gt; I promise.\n\n14\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.243\n&gt;&gt; I hear quadrants and\n\n15\n00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:35.954\nI start thinking about algebra and\n\n16\n00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:40.448\nthen like these flashbacks.\n&gt;&gt; Right, now I know what you mean.\n\n17\n00:00:40.448 --> 00:00:41.271\nI'm thinking,\n\n18\n00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:45.234\nwhy is she worried about math?\nBut I can promise you that we're not gonna\n\n19\n00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:48.808\nbe doing any math in this episode.\nI can't promise you that we're not\n\n20\n00:00:48.808 --> 00:00:51.549\ngonna be doing any maths in this\nepisode though, but you know.\n\n21\n00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:52.242\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:53.548\n&gt;&gt; No, we're not, all right,\n\n23\n00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:56.420\nno matter which way you call it,\nwhether it's math or maths.\n\n24\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.283\n&gt;&gt; I think we might be\n\n25\n00:00:57.283 --> 00:00:59.362\ndoing some Agile in this episode.\n&gt;&gt; We are,\n\n26\n00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:03.054\nwe're not going to be doing mathematics\nat all, we're not gonna be doing,\n\n27\n00:01:03.054 --> 00:01:05.040\nwhat was it, quadratic equations?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n28\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.885\n&gt;&gt; It's been a long time since I was at\n\n29\n00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:09.198\nschool, [LAUGH] no, we're not,\n&gt;&gt; It's okay.\n\n30\n00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:10.820\n&gt;&gt; No, what we're gonna do in this\n\n31\n00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.368\nparticular episode is we're looking\nat testing, we're carrying on\n\n32\n00:01:14.368 --> 00:01:18.816\nwith the testing series and we're actually\nlooking at the testing quadrants, in other\n\n33\n00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:21.670\nwords we're looking at what we test.\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n34\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.400\nin this particular episode we are going to\nbe just examining exactly what we test and\n\n35\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.130\nthe value of our testing, as well.\n\n36\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.540\nYou can't do anything,\n\n37\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.000\nyou can't achieve anything until\nyou understand why you're doing it.\n\n38\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.760\nAnd this is why we talk\nabout the value of testing.\n\n39\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.000\nIn other words, why are we doing it.\n\n40\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.189\nAnd the one thing that we don't like\nin our job, we like efficiency And\n\n41\n00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.860\nwe like effectiveness and we don't like\nto just do something just because we can.\n\n42\n00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.230\nThat's not something\nthat happens in our job.\n\n43\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.520\nWe are not looking to,\n\n44\n00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.230\nwe are not looking, we know already for\nextensive documentation,\n\n45\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.340\nwe're looking to test and we're looking\nto test for the right reasons, but\n\n46\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.850\nwe're not looking to do testing just for\nthe sake of doing testing.\n\n47\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.200\nSo really the testing quadrants are about\nunderstanding why we actually test.\n\n48\n00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.840\nAnd not necessarily the specifics,\ncuz we can't look at the specifics,\n\n49\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.480\ncuz every single project, every single\npiece of development work is gonna be for\n\n50\n00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.020\nsomething completely different.\n\n51\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.950\nAnd of course we wanna test every\nsingle piece of development work.\n\n52\n00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.030\nSo you've gotta think about\nexactly why you're testing it and\n\n53\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.510\nwe can't outline any specifics\nright here and right now.\n\n54\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.310\nSo, I want us to take a look,\nthen, at our testing quadrants.\n\n55\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.070\nAnd this is gonna look like\na bit of a busy diagram.\n\n56\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.540\nAnd I promised Cherokee before we started\non this that this is not gonna be death\n\n57\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.740\nby PowerPoint.\n\n58\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.660\nNow I know that when you walk into\na classroom and you are studying,\n\n59\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.170\nwhether it be Agile, whether it be\nany other form of project management,\n\n60\n00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.510\nwhether it be service management.\n\n61\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.910\nYou look at it, and the instructor stands\nthere sometimes, and you're asleep.\n\n62\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.983\nLet's face it, yeah,\nI know, you can admit it.\n\n63\n00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:08.164\nAnd I always say, whenever I walk\ninto a classroom I always promise\n\n64\n00:03:08.164 --> 00:03:12.571\nthat that's never gonna happen, and\nthen I put up a slide like this and\n\n65\n00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:15.455\neverybody looks at it and\ngoes what on earth.\n\n66\n00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:20.443\n[LAUGH] We're gonna go through this and\nwe're gonna sort of examine every single\n\n67\n00:03:20.443 --> 00:03:22.600\npiece of this slide.\n&gt;&gt; Breaking it down.\n\n68\n00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.360\n&gt;&gt; We are,\n\n69\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.381\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n70\n00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:29.309\nI what I will encourage you to do is,\nthis is gonna take some understanding so\n\n71\n00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.853\nI'm gonna encourage you to\nwatch this more than once.\n\n72\n00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:33.747\nWatch it again and\n\n73\n00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:37.630\nagain until you really understand\nwhat it is we're trying to achieve.\n\n74\n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.710\nBut use our chart,\n\n75\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.650\nour forum facility if you've got\nany questions at all, we're here.\n\n76\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.230\nAnd we could help with those questions,\nthat's why we're here.\n\n77\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.280\nSo if you do have any\nquestions then please go and\n\n78\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.380\ntalk to us because we will be\nhappy to answer them for you.\n\n79\n00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.760\nMuch better to answer a question\nright now, and I always say this,\n\n80\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.160\nmuch better to answer a question\nright now, upfront and\n\n81\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.200\nit will take me five minutes or\nso to answer your question.\n\n82\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.010\nThan you have to then spend three\ndays potentially un-picking something\n\n83\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.810\nbecause you made an assumption.\n\n84\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.830\nSo please,\nfeel free to get in touch with us.\n\n85\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.388\nAnd let's take a look at these\ntesting quadrants there, and\n\n86\n00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:19.220\nI know that our director, Taylor, is right\nnow gonna blow this up to full screen.\n\n87\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.358\nBecause see, look at that,\nhe's good like that,\n\n88\n00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:22.200\nright [LAUGH]?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.680\n&gt;&gt; He's a star.\n\n90\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.289\nSo we start off in the bottom left hand\ncorner and right in the middle there,\n\n91\n00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.480\nyou've got Quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n92\n00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.645\nThat should be fairly self-explanatory.\n\n93\n00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:38.135\nBut you'll see that underneath this\nyou've got Technology Facing quadrants,\n\n94\n00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:39.825\nyou've got Business Facing quadrants.\n\n95\n00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:42.015\nYou've got Supporting the Team quadrants,\n\n96\n00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:45.285\nyou've got Critiquing\nthe Product quadrants.\n\n97\n00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.485\nWe've also got some banners as well, and\n\n98\n00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:52.325\nthose banners will tell us which can be\nautomated and which should be manual.\n\n99\n00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:56.848\nAnd which we could do with tools as well,\nso let's take a look.\n\n100\n00:04:56.848 --> 00:04:59.981\nBefore we take a look at\neach one in any deck,\n\n101\n00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:03.468\nthat let's just take a look\nat them in sections.\n\n102\n00:05:03.468 --> 00:05:08.222\nSo, you'll see that Quadrant 1 and\nQuadrant 4 are Technology Facing.\n\n103\n00:05:08.222 --> 00:05:11.239\nWhat we're doing then,\nin those quadrants is,\n\n104\n00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:16.109\nwe're actually testing the technology\nitself, we're testing the coding.\n\n105\n00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:18.862\nThat's what we're doing here,\nwe're testing the functionality.\n\n106\n00:05:18.862 --> 00:05:21.867\n&gt;&gt; So it's directly interfacing with all\n\n107\n00:05:21.867 --> 00:05:26.700\nthings technology on that\nparticular side of our box, there.\n\n108\n00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.173\nThose two quadrants.\n&gt;&gt; Those two quadrants there,\n\n109\n00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:31.784\nI expect this type of\ntesting to be automated.\n\n110\n00:05:31.784 --> 00:05:35.955\nIt tells you that it's automated and\nit's testing with tools.\n\n111\n00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:40.395\nSo I expect if we're testing in 1 and\n4, we're testing together,\n\n112\n00:05:40.395 --> 00:05:45.275\nthe technology, and\nI expect that to be mainly automated.\n\n113\n00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:47.465\nBut now if I look at Quadrants 1 and 2,\n\n114\n00:05:47.465 --> 00:05:50.355\nyou'll see that they go\ntowards supporting the team.\n\n115\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.170\nIn my lower left hand quadrant, I'm doing\ncomponent testing, I'm doing unit testing.\n\n116\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.760\nAnd I'm testing the failure.\n\n117\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.610\nI'm testing things like error messages,\nfor instance.\n\n118\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.210\nBut in quadrant 2 then,\nI'm testing the user side of things.\n\n119\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.690\nSo I'm testing whether we're actually\ndelivering what we set out to deliver.\n\n120\n00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.860\nAnd this is why we've got\nthis supporting the team.\n\n121\n00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.640\nBecause really what it's testing\ncollectively, what it's testing is,\n\n122\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.270\nis the team actually\nfunctioning as a team?\n\n123\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.600\nIs it functioning effectively?\n\n124\n00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.420\nWe're not actually testing whether\nit's good or whether it's bad.\n\n125\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.070\nWe're just simply testing whether\nit does what it's supposed to do,\n\n126\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.270\nwhether it actually works.\n\n127\n00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.440\nSo quadrants 1 and 2 combine to\ntest in whether it actually works.\n\n128\n00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.120\nSo in other words, is the team working?\n\n129\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.570\nIs the team working together as a team?\n\n130\n00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.760\nAre they doing what\nthey're supposed to do.\n\n131\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.130\nAnd then if we look at, and I'm gonna\njump on over to the right hand side now.\n\n132\n00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.077\nIf we look at Quadrants 3 and\n\n133\n00:06:54.077 --> 00:06:57.560\n4, what we're actually doing is\nthen critiquing the product.\n\n134\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.070\nIn other words,\n\n135\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.740\nwe're testing what we might want to\nconsider to be the usability of that.\n\n136\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.120\nSo we're testing how it does it.\n\n137\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.108\nWe're testing things like, if we were\nlooking at this from an IT perspective,\n\n138\n00:07:11.108 --> 00:07:12.925\nit talks about ility testing.\n\n139\n00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.680\nSo we're testing availability,\n\n140\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.440\nwe're testing the parameters\nwithin which we wanna work.\n\n141\n00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:26.320\nWe might consider that to be\nthe service level target.\n\n142\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.120\nIn service management,\nwe talk about delivering a service,\n\n143\n00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.070\na product to our organization,\nto our business within target.\n\n144\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.970\nI know that email is gonna be available\nsay 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.\n\n145\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.030\nSo that's my availability target.\n\n146\n00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.736\nOkay, what we're doing is,\n\n147\n00:07:43.736 --> 00:07:47.280\nhere we're critiquing the product\nin these two quadrants.\n\n148\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.445\nIt's because we're actually looking at\nwhether those targets can be achieved and\n\n149\n00:07:52.445 --> 00:07:54.075\nhow they can be achieved.\n\n150\n00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:58.350\nSo we're testing that through\nthe usability side of things because\n\n151\n00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.700\nsometimes, let's face it,\nusers don't always want to do things in\n\n152\n00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.050\nwhat we might call a A structured\nmanner or something that makes sense\n\n153\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.050\nto us because we're in IT, and\nwe know how things should work.\n\n154\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.610\n[LAUGH] And we quite often take shortcuts.\n\n155\n00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.390\nAnd then in our top quadrants,\nour Quadrant 2 and Quadrant 3,\n\n156\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.680\nthese are our business facing Quadrants.\n\n157\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.430\nAnd you'll see that there's\na lot of manual testing there.\n\n158\n00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.180\nI expect you to ask questions.\n\n159\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.490\nThings like, do you like it?\n\n160\n00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.050\nDoes it work for you?\n\n161\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.620\nHow good is that?\n\n162\n00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.900\nAnd what we want to be testing there,\n\n163\n00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.160\nwhether it's not only achieves\na fulfillment of the story, but\n\n164\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.960\nalso how it achieves fulfillment\nof the story as well.\n\n165\n00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.370\nSo these are our Business Facing tests.\n\n166\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.990\nNow, Business Facing tests, in a lot\nof instances are based on subjectivity.\n\n167\n00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.650\nWe're gonna try and make it as objective\nas possible but you know what,\n\n168\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.015\nsometimes we still fail.\n\n169\n00:08:59.025 --> 00:09:02.845\nSometimes we just don't realize and\nwe don't realize\n\n170\n00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:07.035\nsomething that becomes important later\nwhich is why again, we are in our job.\n\n171\n00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:10.395\nWe wanna accept change\nas late as possible.\n\n172\n00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:14.082\nI'm gonna ask you a question, and\nI know that I've asked you this before.\n\n173\n00:09:14.082 --> 00:09:17.974\nDo you know how many people we\nhave here that are colorblind?\n\n174\n00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:20.085\nI don't know, for sure.\n&gt;&gt; I've asked her this before.\n\n175\n00:09:20.085 --> 00:09:22.866\n&gt;&gt; I know, I feel like maybe one person\n\n176\n00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:26.840\nbut I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Right, we don't know and yet\n\n177\n00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.452\nwe can give it, I mean we've got\ndevelopers here that do exactly this,\n\n178\n00:09:31.452 --> 00:09:35.930\nthey work to an agile methodology and\nso they do exactly this.\n\n179\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.090\nAnd it's at this point in time when\nwe're doing our business facing tests\n\n180\n00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.900\nthat quite often we find that, look,\nyou've delivered something for me, and\n\n181\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.842\nthat means absolutely everything, it ticks\nevery single box, but I can't see it.\n\n182\n00:09:47.842 --> 00:09:48.426\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n183\n00:09:48.426 --> 00:09:52.500\n[LAUGH] It didn't have the user\nin mind upon developing that.\n\n184\n00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.100\n&gt;&gt; Right, or\n\n185\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.970\nmaybe we didn't ask the right questions.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.240\n&gt;&gt; We didn't get the story right.\n\n187\n00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.630\nAnd we'll be,\nif we look at the role of the product,\n\n188\n00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.430\nI know we've got another series on that,\nwe'll be looking at user personas and\n\n189\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.950\nthat's something that we might\nwanna pick up in the personas.\n\n190\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.730\nSo we want to be looking at,\nfrom this perspective,\n\n191\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.560\nthe business facing perspective,\ndoes it actually work for\n\n192\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.530\nthem and not does it work as in\na functionality does it work, but\n\n193\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.740\nalso does it really fit in\nwith the way that they work?\n\n194\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.220\nDoes it fit in with their working style,\nas it were.\n\n195\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.210\nSo lets take a look at each one of\nthese in a little bit more depth.\n\n196\n00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.580\nAnd we're gonna start off\nat the very beginning.\n\n197\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.470\nBecause apparently that's a very good\n\n198\n00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.650\nplace to start.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.315\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] So, cue one, bottom left.\n\n200\n00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:38.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I watch too much Sound of Music\n\n201\n00:10:38.485 --> 00:10:39.691\ndon't I?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:40.385\n&gt;&gt; No, it's all right,\n\n203\n00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:42.150\nI can go with that.\n&gt;&gt; I won't sing,\n\n204\n00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.520\nI promise.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.170\n&gt;&gt; But we do have a microphone in\n\n206\n00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.290\nthe corner there, but\nyou wouldn't appreciate that.\n\n207\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.110\nSo yeah,\nwe're gonna start off with Quarter 1.\n\n208\n00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:59.300\nAnd Quarter 1 or Quadrant 1, these\nare our unit tests, our component tests.\n\n209\n00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.930\nSo what we're testing for, here.\n\n210\n00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.300\nThey're technology-focused but\nthey're also supporting our team and\n\n211\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.610\ntelling us whether the team\nis doing their job.\n\n212\n00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.180\nWhat we're testing for\nhere are error messages.\n\n213\n00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.140\nThat's what we're testing for.\n\n214\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.240\nWe're testing and yeah,\nthis should be automated.\n\n215\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.870\nWe're testing to ensure that\nit works without error.\n\n216\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.620\nWe're not testing to ensure that\nit does what it's supposed to do,\n\n217\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.280\nwe're just testing here that\nit works without error.\n\n218\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:33.410\nThe last thing that you want is if you\nare devising a service that's going to,\n\n219\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:38.010\nsay, send or receive email the last thing\nthat you want is every time you send\n\n220\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.880\nan email to come up with an error message\nsaying that this format is not supported.\n\n221\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.810\nOr maybe the fact that this language\nis not supported for instance,\n\n222\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.650\nsomething like that.\n\n223\n00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.840\nAnd just recently I tried to\nupdate a presentation and\n\n224\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.120\ncame up with the same error message,\nthis particular font is not supported.\n\n225\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.790\nSo here, what we're doing here is we're\nlooking at the actual development work and\n\n226\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.950\nwe're testing that it works without error.\n\n227\n00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.640\nAnd then we have Quarter 2.\n\n228\n00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.840\nHey look at that, we're on the next one.\n\n229\n00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.527\nAnd Quarter 2 are our functional tests and\n\n230\n00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:21.452\nour story tests and\nour prototypes and our simulations.\n\n231\n00:12:21.452 --> 00:12:27.798\nSome of these can be automated, but\na lot of these are going to be manual,\n\n232\n00:12:27.798 --> 00:12:32.390\nand I'd expect us to get\nour users involved in this.\n\n233\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.890\nDoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n234\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.100\nIn Quadrant 1,\nwe tested whether it worked without error.\n\n235\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:46.291\nWe tested the error messages and how-\n&gt;&gt; We can go ahead and\n\n236\n00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:49.424\nwrite a script to send out those\nemails and to generate emails and\n\n237\n00:12:49.424 --> 00:12:54.167\nthen that would, instead of just having\nsomeone sit there and send out 100 emails.\n\n238\n00:12:54.167 --> 00:12:57.615\nScript it out and then see if that\nmessage will create an error.\n\n239\n00:12:57.615 --> 00:13:01.325\nBut here, it's a little bit different.\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean, we can do this.\n\n240\n00:13:01.325 --> 00:13:02.965\nIt's part of this type of testing.\n\n241\n00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:04.685\nIt says automated and manual.\n\n242\n00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:08.597\nSo we can do it this way,\nit's not an issue at all and\n\n243\n00:13:08.597 --> 00:13:13.387\nthis why we allow for both, but\nwe shouldn't be doing one, exclusively.\n\n244\n00:13:13.387 --> 00:13:14.398\nSo all of our tests,\n\n245\n00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:16.797\nthey shouldn't all be manual tests.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n246\n00:13:16.797 --> 00:13:18.147\n&gt;&gt; And our testing shouldn't\n\n247\n00:13:18.147 --> 00:13:20.907\nall be automated at this point in time.\n\n248\n00:13:20.907 --> 00:13:24.829\nBecause sometimes, and\nas much as in a waterfall project,\n\n249\n00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:29.614\nin a traditional waterfall project,\nwe wouldn't like to say this, but\n\n250\n00:13:29.614 --> 00:13:32.910\nsometimes the users change their mind.\n\n251\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:39.190\nSometimes what we deliver is not quite\nwhat they had in their imagination.\n\n252\n00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.630\nIt's not quite what they wanted, and\n\n253\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.830\nthey wanted something that's\njust a little bit different.\n\n254\n00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.780\nSo maybe it doesn't actually\nmeet the need of the story.\n\n255\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.110\nSo here, yes, we should be testing\nin some ways, automatically.\n\n256\n00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.240\nBut we should also be testing manually,\nas well.\n\n257\n00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.990\nThis is where we're doing\nthat Business Facing test.\n\n258\n00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.110\nSo the example that you\ndescribed was a simulation test.\n\n259\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.100\nBut we're still gonna be doing some\nsort of independent functional and\n\n260\n00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.720\nprototype testing here.\n\n261\n00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.500\nThen you've got Quarter 3.\n\n262\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.030\nAnd Quadrant 3 is also Business Facing,\nbut\n\n263\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.890\nit's also about critique in the product.\n\n264\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.470\nSo this is very, very subjective.\n\n265\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.980\nAgain, we've got Business Facing and\nwe've got functionality, here.\n\n266\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.820\nAnd this is where we're\nlooking at the scenarios.\n\n267\n00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.760\nSo before,\n\n268\n00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.160\nwhat we were testing in Quadrant 2 is,\ndoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n269\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.270\nDoes it send or receive email?\n\n270\n00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.740\nQuadrant 1 tested how it sent and\nreceived email.\n\n271\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.580\nQuadrant 2 tested, does it send and\nreceive email, and\n\n272\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.620\nQuadrant 3 says, okay,\nbut does it sent and\n\n273\n00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.580\nreceive email in a way that I can work\nwith it from a business perspective?\n\n274\n00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.850\nI want us to do a comparison and\nI want us to compare say Gmail,\n\n275\n00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:03.760\nour free web-based service,\nto Microsoft Outlook, for instance.\n\n276\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.630\nFrom a business perspective, so\nQuadrant 1 is our unit testing.\n\n277\n00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.529\nDoesn't work without error messages.\n\n278\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.345\nGmail, that meets that need, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n279\n00:15:14.345 --> 00:15:14.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay,\n\n280\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.940\nit works without error messages,\nand what about Quadrant 2?\n\n281\n00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.190\nDoes it actually meet\nthe specific effectiveness?\n\n282\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.030\nDoes it send and receive email?\n&gt;&gt; Functional, yes.\n\n283\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.270\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, so we can check that one,\n\n284\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.530\nbut what about usability?\n\n285\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.760\n&gt;&gt; For Gmail?\n\n286\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I would say,\n\n287\n00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.950\nlimited.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n288\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.680\n&gt;&gt; I wanna send a very large file but\n\n289\n00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.910\nI'm limited to x amount of megabytes or\nwhatever their size limitations are these\n\n290\n00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.750\ndays, I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\n\n291\n00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.160\nin terms of when we look at the other\nthings as well cuz we're gonna look at\n\n292\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.290\nsecurity in a moment in Quadrant 4.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n293\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.329\n&gt;&gt; But in terms of how it actually works,\n\n294\n00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:51.472\nas a user.\n\n295\n00:15:51.472 --> 00:15:56.936\nWell, how it actually works is not\nquite the same as does it work, right?\n\n296\n00:15:56.936 --> 00:15:57.952\nAnd yes, it does work.\n\n297\n00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:00.696\nAnd it works without errors and\nit does what it is supposed to do.\n\n298\n00:16:00.696 --> 00:16:03.234\nBut do I like it?\n\n299\n00:16:03.234 --> 00:16:04.745\nThere's a question, right.\n\n300\n00:16:04.745 --> 00:16:06.725\nDo I actually like it?\n\n301\n00:16:06.725 --> 00:16:10.410\nAnd this is where I'd expect, and\nthis is why we've got this as manual.\n\n302\n00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:16.310\nThis is where what I expect to\nsee are things like the feedback.\n\n303\n00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.571\nDon't forget we like feedback.\n&gt;&gt; I can send my email, but\n\n304\n00:16:18.571 --> 00:16:24.000\nI have to send secure email and I don't\nencryption with this service or whatever.\n\n305\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.440\nReally simple little things,\n\n306\n00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.990\nlike you know I couldn't find\nout how to compose an email.\n\n307\n00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.130\nSure, there's the big red button on the\ntop left-hand corner, but you know what I\n\n308\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:38.450\ndidn't see it, cuz I was expecting to see\nit in a menu bar or a ribbon at the top.\n\n309\n00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.513\nThat's where I expect to find this in our\n\n310\n00:16:41.513 --> 00:16:42.650\nquadrant 3.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n311\n00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.139\n&gt;&gt; That's a exploratory testing and\n\n312\n00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:50.200\nthat scenarios, so that's where\nwe're if I'm using my cellphone,\n\n313\n00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.090\nhow do I send an email?\n\n314\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.870\nIf I'm using laptop,\nhow do I send an email?\n\n315\n00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.640\nAnd what about if I'm using\nboth at the same time?\n\n316\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.944\nAll of that, that's what I\nshould be doing in quadrant 3.\n\n317\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.730\nQuadrant 4 is about security,\nit's about availability,\n\n318\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:13.898\nit's about having the capacity,\nit's about doing our load testing.\n\n319\n00:17:13.898 --> 00:17:19.010\nSo quadrant 4 is really about, and I like\nto phrase this slightly differently.\n\n320\n00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.970\nIt's testing it until it breaks,\nthat's what quadrant 4 is doing.\n\n321\n00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.700\nIn the other quadrants, we've tested\nthat it works, right, it's great.\n\n322\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.280\nIn this quadrant we're gonna\ntest how long it works for.\n\n323\n00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.250\nSo is it available when I\nneed to have it available?\n\n324\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.220\nCan I be assured of\ncertain security levels?\n\n325\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.600\nDoes it have the right\nlevel of continuity.\n\n326\n00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.509\nThat's what I'm testing\nhere in quadrant 4.\n\n327\n00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:51.977\nNow, what I should have done here, look at\nthis, I didn't move this on, there we go,\n\n328\n00:17:51.977 --> 00:17:53.160\nnow it's all purple.\n\n329\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.740\nI was wondering.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.440\n&gt;&gt; I think you might be the color blind\n\n331\n00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.737\none, or maybe I am, it's blue or purple\n&gt;&gt; I'm the one that's not with it.\n\n332\n00:17:59.737 --> 00:18:01.694\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:18:01.694 --> 00:18:03.730\n&gt;&gt; I can't see it\n\n334\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.048\n&gt;&gt; I knew there was one here.\n\n335\n00:18:05.048 --> 00:18:06.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But, yeah, so\n\n336\n00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.000\nhere in quadrant 4, then we're testing all\nover the we're testing it till it breaks.\n\n337\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.720\nSo you might want to use words\nlike I mean you've heard of stress\n\n338\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.690\ntesting?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n339\n00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.350\n&gt;&gt; This is where my stress testing lies\n\n340\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.520\nand so, I'm gonna use tools for\n\n341\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.160\nthis one, I'm gonna use simulation\ntool to test load balance in.\n\n342\n00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.930\nTo test the amount of capacity that\nalready has, to test its availability.\n\n343\n00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.990\nYou know with things like Gmail and\nI use that as an example.\n\n344\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.950\nI'm probably going to use simulation\ntest to tested it 2 AM in the morning or\n\n345\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.610\nto test it various times.\n\n346\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.200\nAnd to test this under certain scenarios,\nand\n\n347\n00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.980\nto also test for things like hacking and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n348\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.840\none of my favorite development testing\ntools, there's this, I think originally,\n\n349\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.875\nI forget which university had created it.\n\n350\n00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:53.600\nBut it was part of a project and\n\n351\n00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.220\nthey named it the Fuzz Master.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n352\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.192\n&gt;&gt; And they changed it later on\n\n353\n00:18:57.192 --> 00:19:02.360\nto just a generic term that's\nused industry wide into fuzzing.\n\n354\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.215\nSo fuzzing, yeah, who knew, but-\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know,\n\n355\n00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:09.880\nthere's some organizations that go to\nextreme lengths to test for security\n\n356\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.950\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n357\n00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.476\n&gt;&gt; And there are a lot of organizations,\n\n358\n00:19:12.476 --> 00:19:14.481\nbecause they're regulated organizations,\nand\n\n359\n00:19:14.481 --> 00:19:16.785\nthis still applies in an agile\nenvironment, by the way.\n\n360\n00:19:16.785 --> 00:19:21.356\nEven in a heavily regulated organization,\nyou might choose to bring in professional\n\n361\n00:19:21.356 --> 00:19:21.985\nhackers.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n362\n00:19:21.985 --> 00:19:24.040\n&gt;&gt; And I know that we always said, well,\n\n363\n00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.218\nI don't know about you, but I think of\nthe word hacking, and I immediately,\n\n364\n00:19:28.218 --> 00:19:30.874\nwhenever I think of that word I wanna go,\n[SOUND].\n\n365\n00:19:30.874 --> 00:19:32.605\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; We do that here.\n\n366\n00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:34.948\n&gt;&gt; Did you say some people make you do\n\n367\n00:19:34.948 --> 00:19:35.920\nthat here?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n368\n00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.030\nwe do do that here, I don't do that.\n\n369\n00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.210\nWe bring in external, cuz internal or\nbe biased, Jo, you know that-\n\n370\n00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:42.788\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah.\n\n371\n00:19:42.788 --> 00:19:43.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.340\n&gt;&gt; But again, again, you know,\n\n373\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.347\nif you are using, you brought in\na brilliant point there actually,\n\n374\n00:19:48.347 --> 00:19:50.429\nbecause you're talking about being biased.\n\n375\n00:19:50.429 --> 00:19:53.343\nSometimes, especially for security,\n\n376\n00:19:53.343 --> 00:19:58.750\nyou might wanna use independent\ntesters including independent hackers.\n\n377\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.970\nWell, you know what,\nwe're in a spring burn in this duration.\n\n378\n00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.930\nWe're running hard, up to four\nweeks to perform each iteration.\n\n379\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:09.608\nSo you're gonna have to\nget yourself organized and\n\n380\n00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:14.080\nagain, this is not part\nof a waterfall project.\n\n381\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.289\nWe've got a short, finite period of time,\nso we've got to make sure that our\n\n382\n00:20:19.289 --> 00:20:24.260\nsuppliers, our vendors, our third\nparties are able to accommodate us,\n\n383\n00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.780\nand that they're not gonna impact\non the delivery of our project.\n\n384\n00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.730\nSo let me ask you a question here,\nreally a scenario question.\n\n385\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.180\nIf you have then, we're in our iteration.\n\n386\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.941\nWe're in Week 3 and it's a full\nweek iteration and our third party\n\n387\n00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:49.540\nhaven't come back to us with\nany confirmed dates for\n\n388\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.650\nwhen they're gonna be able to do their\ntesting, for a particular iteration of for\n\n389\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.930\na particular story, what do we do?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna be contacting and\n\n390\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.410\nlooking for a different vendor,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what I would do,\n\n391\n00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.540\nI'll maybe reach out to them one final\ntime and then move on but I don't know.\n\n392\n00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.050\n&gt;&gt; What, in a week?\n\n393\n00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.650\nIn one week?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\n\n394\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.950\nwe're in week three of\na four-week iteration.\n\n395\n00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:10.842\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I mean,\n\n396\n00:21:10.842 --> 00:21:13.176\nyou'll have to pay a premium,\nbut what else are you gonna do?\n\n397\n00:21:13.176 --> 00:21:15.723\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, the first thing that we're\n\n398\n00:21:15.723 --> 00:21:19.331\ngonna do is we're going to park\nthat particular iteration or\n\n399\n00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:21.260\nthat particular story.\n\n400\n00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:21.964\nAnd we're gonna say-\n&gt;&gt; Add it to\n\n401\n00:21:21.964 --> 00:21:23.370\nthe backlog?\n&gt;&gt; Sorry?\n\n402\n00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.160\nAnd add it to the backlog, right.\n\n403\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.360\nWe gotta think about managing our\nproject and then at that point in time,\n\n404\n00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.580\nthat's when we would say, okay,\n\n405\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:35.050\nwhat are we gonna do about that particular\nsupply or that particular contract?\n\n406\n00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.445\nSo they're not talking to us,\n\n407\n00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:39.570\nwe're not getting any confirmation\nfrom them about testing.\n\n408\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.460\nSo this is something that,\nthis is a real world scenario.\n\n409\n00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.249\n&gt;&gt; It can happen,\n\n410\n00:21:43.249 --> 00:21:45.020\nI'm sure it happens quite often.\n\n411\n00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.171\nI know even personally, and\nI told you before the show.\n\n412\n00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:49.118\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:21:49.118 --> 00:21:51.098\n&gt;&gt; I had some, very similar situation.\n\n414\n00:21:51.098 --> 00:21:53.615\n&gt;&gt; Right, and we've got to make sure that\n\n415\n00:21:53.615 --> 00:21:57.060\nwe can accommodate that in\na real world environment.\n\n416\n00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.450\nAnd we don't live in this Utopian ideal.\n\n417\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:06.770\nWe really don't, and when it comes to\nmanaging projects, things go wrong.\n\n418\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.780\nBut the idea with Agile\nis that we manage that.\n\n419\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.100\nAnd this is not a portion of blame,\nit's not about pointing fingers,\n\n420\n00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.270\nthis is not about going out\non some sort of witch hunt.\n\n421\n00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:22.340\nWhat this is about is really accepting\nthe fact that okay, we haven't had\n\n422\n00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:27.500\nany contact from the supplier or the\ncontractor, and we've gotta do something.\n\n423\n00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.800\nWe've got one week left on that iteration.\n\n424\n00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.596\nWe've gotta do something, so what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna part up that user\n\n425\n00:22:33.596 --> 00:22:36.906\nstory and we're gonna add it to\nthe backbone for the next iteration, and\n\n426\n00:22:36.906 --> 00:22:39.748\nit may well be that, yeah,\nwe have to find another supplier.\n\n427\n00:22:39.748 --> 00:22:43.420\nAnd the same can be said,\nfor when testing fails.\n\n428\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.459\nSo we're doing all of these testing\nin all of four quadrants and\n\n429\n00:22:48.459 --> 00:22:49.830\nsomething goes wrong.\n\n430\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.890\nSomething fails this test, again,\nyou're doing exactly the same thing,\n\n431\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:23:00.710\nyou're going to add it to your backlog,\nyou're not going to delay the iteration.\n\n432\n00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.950\nThat's one thing that\nwe should never do in\n\n433\n00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.140\nan Agile environment is\nto delay the iteration.\n\n434\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.276\nWe should always select,\nthis is my cut off point and\n\n435\n00:23:10.276 --> 00:23:13.650\nwe don't like bureaucracy and\nwe don't like contact.\n\n436\n00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.960\nBut we do want to be able to commit\n\n437\n00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.200\nto delivering certain products at\ncertain time so the iteration.\n\n438\n00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.260\nAnd then therefore,\n\n439\n00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:27.300\nthe subsequent release we want to\ndeliver to a specific point in time.\n\n440\n00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.487\nSo we don't delay that,\nif something doesn't work,\n\n441\n00:23:31.487 --> 00:23:34.134\nthen it gets added to the backlog.\n\n442\n00:23:34.134 --> 00:23:38.332\nIf we're not getting the right\nresponse from a supplier,\n\n443\n00:23:38.332 --> 00:23:43.120\nthen again, that story get shelved and\nadded to the backlog.\n\n444\n00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:49.100\nWe don't just wait, that's the one\nthing that we don't do within Agile\n\n445\n00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.330\nfrom a project management perspective,\nit just doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n446\n00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.950\nSo we've looked very briefly\nat testing quadrants.\n\n447\n00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:02.328\nAnd in our next episode, what we're\nactually going to be looking at is\n\n448\n00:24:02.328 --> 00:24:06.571\ncollaboration, and collaboration across\nour development teams, and we're gonna be\n\n449\n00:24:06.571 --> 00:24:10.550\ndelve in further into the collaboration\nwith our suppliers and with our vendors.\n\n450\n00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.190\nBut for now that's it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n451\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.980\nAnd we'll see you in the next episode.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Jo for\n\n452\n00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.090\nnot making me do math and for\nexplaining this Agile Quadrants.\n\n453\n00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.250\nAnd thank you for joining us, but\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n454\n00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.206\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n455\n00:24:26.206 --> 00:24:28.250\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n456\n00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.195\n[MUSIC]\n\n457\n00:24:31.195 --> 00:24:36.525\nThank you for watching

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:14.780\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to\nyour Agile testing series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.780\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.690\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look at\ndevelopment for testing and with us today,\n\n7\n00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.470\nback in studios, we have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.530\nHow's it going today Jo?\n\n9\n00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.850\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.460\nHow are you?\n\n11\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.520\nI'm doing wonderful,\n\n12\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.830\nwe said we were gonna get our toes\nwet in the last couple episodes.\n\n13\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.220\nSo are we like, slowly walking\ninto that really cold water,\n\n14\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.385\nis that what's happening right now?\n\n15\n00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.225\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think yesterday, we dived\nright in well and truly, didn't we?\n\n16\n00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.854\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you remember we looked at those\n\n17\n00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:45.600\ntesting quadrants in\nthat previous episode.\n\n18\n00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.850\nAnd we looked at the various\ntypes of tests that we do.\n\n19\n00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Well, now we look at how we in this\n\n20\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.310\nparticular episode, we're gonna\nlook at how we develop to test.\n\n21\n00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.450\nIt's kind of a bit of\na tongue twister right?\n\n22\n00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.020\nDevelopment for testing.\n\n23\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.430\nBut the idea is that when you\ndeveloping your software,\n\n24\n00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.940\nyou know what you're going to test.\n\n25\n00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.590\nAnd so you develop it to be tested.\n\n26\n00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.730\nKind of make sense, right?\n\n27\n00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n28\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.500\nLike with anything, if you know\na car has to drive on the road,\n\n29\n00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.060\nyou're gonna put the wheels on it.\n\n30\n00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.330\nCars have wheels, you are gonna\nmake sure that the wheels turn.\n\n31\n00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.850\n&gt;&gt; I like that actually, yes,\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n32\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.120\nYou know what the purpose of that\nparticular piece of software is,\n\n33\n00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.800\nor that car is,\nyou know it's got to get you from A to B.\n\n34\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.200\nSo you're going to test\nthe thing's ability to drive.\n\n35\n00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.654\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And your ability to steer it as well.\n\n36\n00:01:33.654 --> 00:01:36.201\nSo this is what we're going to be doing.\n\n37\n00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:40.665\nWe're just going to be looking at\nthe types of tests that we have for\n\n38\n00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:45.065\nall of our software and also how\nwe then develop to do the testing.\n\n39\n00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:49.711\nSo you don't develop something, and\nthis is a common misconception and\n\n40\n00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:53.214\nit happens in IT a lot,\nis that we develop something and\n\n41\n00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:56.830\nthen we think about\nthe testing afterwards.\n\n42\n00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.220\nAnd then that's when we say, right,\nokay, what is it we want to test and\n\n43\n00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.010\nwe might test for usability.\n\n44\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.380\nBut then we don't really know\nhow the user's going to use it.\n\n45\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.870\nBecause if we haven't have that\ncollaboration with the user or we maybe\n\n46\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.060\ndon't understand our users, then we don't\nknow really know exactly what to test for.\n\n47\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.530\nAnd so what we say now is remember\neverything I have always said about agile,\n\n48\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.890\nit's about common sense written down and\nthis exactly what it is.\n\n49\n00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.120\nIt's just like you know you gonna test, so\nlet's develop it so that it can be tested.\n\n50\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.350\nAnd let's develop it so that it does\nmeet the need to the organization.\n\n51\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, I've seen things where\ncompanies have just had bolt ons or\n\n52\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.940\nafterthoughts just kind\nof bandaged on there, and\n\n53\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.770\nit never really works out that well.\n\n54\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.960\nSo just thinking about it from the onset,\nthe planning, and\n\n55\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.740\ngetting it into our sprint or\nour iteration.\n\n56\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.358\nAnd just thinking about it ahead of time.\n\n57\n00:02:56.358 --> 00:02:59.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what we're doing.\n\n58\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.910\nWe're acknowledging really\nthat we're going to test.\n\n59\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.100\nAnd I wonder how many pieces of software\nwe've developed to not even tested.\n\n60\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.700\nI wonder how many pieces of software,\n\n61\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.540\nhow many solutions are just\ndeployed without the testing.\n\n62\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.555\nOr maybe, I don't know about you but\n\n63\n00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:21.005\nI've heard all of this,\nwe test it in the live environment.\n\n64\n00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:22.640\nNo, you don't right.\n\n65\n00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.584\nYou test it before it goes live,\nthere's such a thing as beta testing or\n\n66\n00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:28.115\nhow would you say that now?\n\n67\n00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:30.042\n&gt;&gt; Beta.\n&gt;&gt; Right beta.\n\n68\n00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Testing [LAUGH] right.\n\n69\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.680\nThere's such a thing as beta testing and\n\n70\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.500\nso that's testing it in\nthe live environment.\n\n71\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.960\nAnd you've got testing environments too.\n\n72\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.800\nSo we got to make sure though that when\nwe do the development we consider that\n\n73\n00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.580\nthey're all going to be tests for it.\n\n74\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.458\nSo what I wanna do in the first\ncouple of slides is I really wanna\n\n75\n00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:56.393\nlook at just the difference between sort\nof the developer and the tester role.\n\n76\n00:03:56.393 --> 00:04:00.156\nOne rule, one rule, just one rule that\nI'm going to give on this one, and\n\n77\n00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.950\nthat is that the person that develops\nshouldn't be the person to test it.\n\n78\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.530\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n\n79\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.588\n&gt;&gt; It's simple, cuz if I develop\nsomething, and because I may,\n\n80\n00:04:10.588 --> 00:04:15.636\n[LAUGH] if I develop something and\nI test it then I know what to do.\n\n81\n00:04:15.636 --> 00:04:17.997\nAnd I know not only how\nto make it look good, and\n\n82\n00:04:17.997 --> 00:04:21.691\nit's not that I'm being vain about it but\nknow how to make it look good but\n\n83\n00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:24.540\nI know also how to fix it\nif something goes wrong.\n\n84\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.100\nAnd so there are gonna be a lot of\nthings to get lost in that development.\n\n85\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.650\nBecause, well,\n\n86\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.550\nwe don't necessarily accurately\nreport the results of our testing.\n\n87\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.345\nCuz you tend to sort of like\nyou know just dip into things.\n\n88\n00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:40.545\nNo one try this out,\nno one try that out, and-\n\n89\n00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:42.005\n&gt;&gt; Well if you developed it and\n\n90\n00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:44.975\nit make sense to you, then that's perfect.\n\n91\n00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:46.345\nBut that's not the end user.\n\n92\n00:04:46.345 --> 00:04:50.075\nSo what if I can get some kind of sample\ngroups to go ahead and test this or\n\n93\n00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:54.185\nmaybe appear to go ahead and run through\nit to see if there are things that\n\n94\n00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:57.120\nI didn't think about that you\nmight have thought about.\n\n95\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.140\nBut, you just said that if I developed it,\nit makes sense to me.\n\n96\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.270\nAnd this is exactly the same\nway as we're working right now.\n\n97\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.760\nWhat I'm saying makes\nperfect sense to me [LAUGH].\n\n98\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.310\nYou might not be able to understand\nwhat I'm saying, and you are here-\n\n99\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.530\n&gt;&gt; That's my biggest challenge.\n\n100\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.700\nLike I have Cherokee speak and\nI think Jo is like starting to learn it.\n\n101\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.070\nHopefully you are too.\n\n102\n00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.290\nBut it's a little crazy.\n\n103\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.770\n&gt;&gt; But you're here for\nmy sanity check, right?\n\n104\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.520\nYou are here.\n\n105\n00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.480\nYou're the one that says, yeah,\nI don't know what you're going on about.\n\n106\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.155\nI really don't know what you're saying.\n\n107\n00:05:26.155 --> 00:05:28.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, and Adam says this a lot.\n\n108\n00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.170\nHe's like, all right Cherokee, you gotta\nkeep me honest here because if I'm saying\n\n109\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.550\nsomething that doesn't make sense or\nwhatever, just make sure that they know.\n\n110\n00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.740\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's exactly it.\n\n111\n00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.100\nYou are here to be the person that would\nnormally be asking me the questions.\n\n112\n00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.780\nThat's why you're here and\nI can say exactly what I want to say, but\n\n113\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.420\nat the end of the day,\nif it only makes sense to me, it's no use.\n\n114\n00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.240\nAnd it's the same with development.\n\n115\n00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.330\nIf it only makes sense to the developer or\n\n116\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.070\nif it only works from the developer's\nperspective, then that's not gonna be any\n\n117\n00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.860\nvalue once we get it deployed and\nonce it's in the live environment.\n\n118\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.050\nSo its really important,\nand this is why I've titled\n\n119\n00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.990\nthis slide collaborating with developers,\nit's really important that the test\n\n120\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.780\ncollaborates with the developer, but it's\nalso important that tester is impartial.\n\n121\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.810\nIt's important that the tester\nis somebody that understands\n\n122\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.260\nthe product from a high level.\n\n123\n00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.750\nBut it's also important\nthat the tester is not\n\n124\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.500\nthe person that's doing\nthe development work.\n\n125\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.190\nIt's not somebody with\na biased perspective on it.\n\n126\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.730\nOr someone who really understands cuz\nthey've helped with the development.\n\n127\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.970\nSo if you look at the difference\nthere between the developer role and\n\n128\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.250\ntester role you'll see\nsome fairly obvious ones.\n\n129\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.790\nThe developer works out the story details,\n\n130\n00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.440\nwhereas the tester is going to\nparticipate in that discussion.\n\n131\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.140\nBut you see, let's think about\nthis from a practical perspective.\n\n132\n00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.430\nSo I'm a developer and\nyou're my tester, and\n\n133\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.150\nI'm a developer and\nlet's pretend we've got the user or\n\n134\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.870\nmaybe a product owner in the room,\nand they've given us a story.\n\n135\n00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.090\nWhat am I interested in?\n\n136\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.080\nWell, I'm interested in, okay, how am I\ngoing to be able to deliver that story?\n\n137\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.810\nI'm interested in how am I going\n\n138\n00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.670\nto develop this in a way that\nthey're gonna be able to use it.\n\n139\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.700\nBut yet, you, what you're thinking about\nis well, how am I going to test this?\n\n140\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.740\nHow am I gonna check that it works?\n\n141\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.090\nSo you're thinking about the usability.\n\n142\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.581\nYou're writing down and\nparticipating by asking questions.\n\n143\n00:07:32.581 --> 00:07:37.510\nYou're writing down exactly\nwhat you're gonna need to test.\n\n144\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.830\n&gt;&gt; Like, what does that mean, Jo?\n\n145\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.369\nWhat are you talking about Jo?\n\n146\n00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:43.384\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.420\n&gt;&gt; So, whereas, remember I talked about in\n\n148\n00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.370\none of our previous episodes\nabout customer experience and\n\n149\n00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.440\nabout sort of moments of truth.\n\n150\n00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.565\nAs a tester you're concerned with that.\n\n151\n00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:58.746\nAnd if you thought about the quadrants\nthat we looked at in previous episodes\n\n152\n00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:03.075\nas well, There's a test that you're\nthinking about all of those quadrants.\n\n153\n00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:07.105\nYou're thinking about testing not just\ndoes it just work without any errors,\n\n154\n00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:10.090\nbut does it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n155\n00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.330\nAnd how easy is it to use?\n\n156\n00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.990\nThat's the usability test.\n\n157\n00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:18.510\nAnd also then there's the security\naspect and the sort of the availability\n\n158\n00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.870\naspect and actually,\nis it there when I want it to be there?\n\n159\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, and who are we interfacing with?\n\n160\n00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.500\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's you're looking at that\nand as a developer, I'm not gonna turn\n\n161\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.790\naround and say, I don't care about that,\ncuz that would be wrong, right?\n\n162\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:37.630\nBut as a developer, that's not\ntop of my priority list to test.\n\n163\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:44.829\nI'm interested in designing for that and\nI'm interested in developing for security.\n\n164\n00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:49.650\nBut I'm not gonna know just how\nsecure it is until you've tested it.\n\n165\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.210\nI am not going to be the one,\n\n166\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.098\nif I'm designing something\nthat sits behind a firewall.\n\n167\n00:08:55.098 --> 00:08:58.500\nI'm not gonna be the one that's\ngoing to fire a virus at it to check\n\n168\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.580\nthat it's not gonna fail, that's your job.\n\n169\n00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.698\nAnd your job is possibly to go out\nthere and find a good virus maybe-\n\n170\n00:09:06.698 --> 00:09:07.410\n&gt;&gt; Try to break it.\n\n171\n00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.552\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly what your job is.\n\n172\n00:09:09.552 --> 00:09:13.850\nAnd we used to use terms\nlike sort of stress testing.\n\n173\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.410\nWe should still use those terms.\n\n174\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.380\nThat's what you're gonna do,\nyou're gonna test it till it breaks.\n\n175\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.580\nSo on the slide that you've got in front\nof you there is really just a guide, and\n\n176\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.065\nit's just something that,\nbecause we can't be too specific.\n\n177\n00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:30.180\nCuz we don't know what is that\nyou are personally developing and\n\n178\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.090\nwhat your project is going to achieve.\n\n179\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.810\nBut that is just a guide for\nthe difference between development and\n\n180\n00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.780\ntesting is something\nthat you can refer to,\n\n181\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.280\nyou can download this material and it's\nsomething that you can refer to later on.\n\n182\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.490\nNow, I have spoken in\nprevious episodes and\n\n183\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:53.370\nwe'd looked at our Agile fundamentals\nseries and we talked about pairing.\n\n184\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, working together.\n\n185\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.060\n&gt;&gt; Working together,\nworking in collaboration.\n\n186\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.810\nBut ultimately it's still the same rule.\n\n187\n00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.340\nEven if we're working together,\n\n188\n00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.870\nI'll be developing one aspect,\nyou'll test that aspect.\n\n189\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.770\nYou will develop another aspect and\nI'll test that aspect.\n\n190\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:15.120\nUnderstand that in any team\nwe've got all different skills.\n\n191\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.910\nYour skills are far more\ntechnical than mine.\n\n192\n00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.230\nYour technical skills are far\nmore recent than mine.\n\n193\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.532\nAnd so I understand that that\nwhat's you're going to be doing,\n\n194\n00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:26.498\nis you're gonna be developing that.\n\n195\n00:10:26.498 --> 00:10:29.530\nWhereas my skills may well\nbe more user-focused.\n\n196\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.770\nSo I'm gonna be looking\nat user interfaces and\n\n197\n00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:36.590\nI'm going to be working on designing,\nrather than the developing.\n\n198\n00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.250\nI'm gonna be working on designing\nthe user interfaces and\n\n199\n00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.770\ndesigning those moments of truth and\nthat customer experience.\n\n200\n00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.720\nBut then you'll be testing that, and\nI will be testing your coding, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.803\nSo we have that sort of the collaboration\nand that synergy between us,\n\n202\n00:10:54.803 --> 00:10:58.210\nbut we are really\ncomplimenting each other.\n\n203\n00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:03.710\n&gt;&gt; Right, and hopefully some of your\nskills will rub off on me and vice versa.\n\n204\n00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.690\nI don't know if she wants any of that but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was just gonna say,\n\n205\n00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.070\nI don't think you need any of my skills,\ntrust me.\n\n206\n00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.413\n&gt;&gt; No, but you do see stronger individuals\nwhen you start cross training.\n\n207\n00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:20.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, and what we should be doing\nis looking for a stronger team, really.\n\n208\n00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.090\nIt's not just about improving individuals,\nbut\n\n209\n00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.000\nit's also about having\nthat stronger team and\n\n210\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.620\ngetting the team working more as a team,\nreally, in a more collaborative way.\n\n211\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.440\nIt produces not just a high quality\nproduct, as it says there, but\n\n212\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.360\na high quality sort of team as well.\n\n213\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:44.550\nAnd the teams that don't function very\nwell when it comes to development and\n\n214\n00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.370\nwhen it comes to the testing are the teams\nthat are constantly competing for\n\n215\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.590\nthe number one status.\n\n216\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.220\n&gt;&gt; Praise.\n\n217\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\nwhen you get people that are competing for\n\n218\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.480\npraise, when you get people\nthat are competing for\n\n219\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.110\nthat number one status,\nthat's not a great functioning team.\n\n220\n00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.860\nThat's not a collaborative team at all.\n\n221\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.400\nAnd the best teams or the best Agile teams\nare the ones that are collaborative.\n\n222\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.670\nRemember, all of our Agile principles and\ngo back and look at our\n\n223\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:18.300\nAgile fundamentals series and you will see\nthat we really really value collaboration.\n\n224\n00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.530\nThis is not about having\na distinct hierarchy.\n\n225\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.700\nThis is something that happens\nat a waterfall approach.\n\n226\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:29.020\nThat distinct hierarchy with\neverybody having very clear and\n\n227\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.500\ndelineated responsibilities.\n\n228\n00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.230\nAnd that's not what we're\ntalking about here.\n\n229\n00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.630\nEverybody has their responsibilities, but\n\n230\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.620\nnobody should be restricted\nby those responsibilities.\n\n231\n00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.380\nBecause we should be working\ntogether as a team, and\n\n232\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.520\nI should be able to say to you,\nI can't do this, can you help?\n\n233\n00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.880\nAnd exactly the same, vice versa.\n\n234\n00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.400\nYou should be able to say to me,\nI can't do this, can you help?\n\n235\n00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.164\nOkay, that's not something that's very\nvery easy when you've got a very rigid\n\n236\n00:12:59.164 --> 00:13:02.540\nstructure which you have in\nsome waterfall approaches.\n\n237\n00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.460\nSo let's take a look then at\nthe types of tests that we do.\n\n238\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.880\nBut it's not really the types of test,\n\n239\n00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.320\nit's more about the types\nof development that we do.\n\n240\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.420\nBecause we're developing for\na specific test, so\n\n241\n00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.660\nwe're developing with those tests in mind.\n\n242\n00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:28.747\nThe tests themselves should\nreflect the work in software.\n\n243\n00:13:31.259 --> 00:13:32.620\nDoes that make sense?\n\n244\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.510\nYou kinda looked at me.\n\n245\n00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm like okay,\nso I was just waiting.\n\n246\n00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:39.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll follow-up.\n\n247\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, you gotta test\nthe real-world examples, right?\n\n248\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nlike just simulating the load usage.\n\n249\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.870\nMaybe the functionality and\nsetting up a lab in our pilot environment?\n\n250\n00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:58.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, so your tests should\ncompletely reflect the real world.\n\n251\n00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.462\n&gt;&gt; Like this particular app works\ngreat when one person uses it,\n\n252\n00:14:01.462 --> 00:14:04.087\nbut breaks when ten people\nlog in simultaneously.\n\n253\n00:14:04.087 --> 00:14:05.950\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly that.\n\n254\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:12.170\nBut also think about the userbase\ntest as well where, I quite often\n\n255\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.480\nwill ask a question from somebody when\nwe're doing some coaching or whatever.\n\n256\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.370\nAnd I will say to people when\nwe're looking at sort of\n\n257\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.500\nthe customer experience,\nand I'll ask a question.\n\n258\n00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.550\nSo I'm gonna use you as an example here,\nCherokee.\n\n259\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.420\nSo, Cherokee,\ntell me how you send an email.\n\n260\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.910\n&gt;&gt; We've done this before.\n\n261\n00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.721\nShe didn't like my answers, so\nI don't know if she'll like this.\n\n262\n00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:34.810\n&gt;&gt; I'm probably not going\nto like it either, so.\n\n263\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I would try to find\nmiddle ground, not too technical.\n\n264\n00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.240\n&gt;&gt; How do you find middle\nground on sending an email?\n\n265\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.661\n&gt;&gt; Well, last time I think you said\nmy answer was too technical, so\n\n266\n00:14:44.661 --> 00:14:46.099\nI don't want to be too vague.\n\n267\n00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:47.397\n&gt;&gt; All right, okay.\n\n268\n00:14:47.397 --> 00:14:50.240\n&gt;&gt; So\nI have to find somewhere in the middle,\n\n269\n00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.501\nsomething that the end\nuser would understand.\n\n270\n00:14:53.501 --> 00:14:56.903\nSo hey maybe I'm gonna go ahead and\nlaunch my mail application,\n\n271\n00:14:56.903 --> 00:14:59.366\nwhatever tool I use to use it,\nso launch that.\n\n272\n00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:04.085\nThen go ahead and find the button\nthat says compose or create,\n\n273\n00:15:04.085 --> 00:15:08.534\nsomething like that,\ntype my recipients email address,\n\n274\n00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:14.360\ncompose my message, hit send\n&gt;&gt; What do you reckon?\n\n275\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:14.990\nIs that right?\n\n276\n00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's easy.\n\n277\n00:15:16.677 --> 00:15:18.632\n&gt;&gt; I tried, does this sound right?\n\n278\n00:15:18.632 --> 00:15:25.175\n&gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is that to\n99.9% of people that's right, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:26.265 --> 00:15:31.435\nWell, all right, I'm gonna rephrase that,\nto 99.9% of people,\n\n280\n00:15:31.435 --> 00:15:36.660\nthey understand what you're saying,\nbut that's not it.\n\n281\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.980\n&gt;&gt; Then what is it, Jo?\n\n282\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.562\n&gt;&gt; Well, for\na start we've gotta start off,\n\n283\n00:15:40.562 --> 00:15:43.585\nand this is something\nthat developers overlook.\n\n284\n00:15:43.585 --> 00:15:47.713\nAnd this is why we get testing wrong\nbecause we don't understand what it is\n\n285\n00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:48.785\nthat the users do.\n\n286\n00:15:48.785 --> 00:15:53.371\nSo we've gotta start off with\nbring your laptop, okay.\n\n287\n00:15:53.371 --> 00:15:57.625\nYou got to start off with right now,\nI click in the bottom left hand corner.\n\n288\n00:15:57.625 --> 00:16:02.710\nI might click on the ribbon\nat the bottom of the screen.\n\n289\n00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.371\nAnd I click on this arrow and\n\n290\n00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:08.139\nI don't just click in this icon,\nI double click on this icon.\n\n291\n00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:10.380\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; And then this pops up, and\n\n292\n00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.368\nthen I go into the top\nleft-hand corner and\n\n293\n00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:17.860\nI click on send or I click on compose,\nand then a window opens up.\n\n294\n00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:22.510\nAnd then in the two field,\nthat's when I type in my Address, and\n\n295\n00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.420\nthen in the subject fields, I click again,\nand then I type in the subject.\n\n296\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.008\nAnd then I either press my tab key or\n\n297\n00:16:30.008 --> 00:16:34.482\nI click down into the body of\nthe message and I type the body.\n\n298\n00:16:34.482 --> 00:16:39.980\nThat's a much more deliberate answer.\n\n299\n00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.650\nIt takes a longer time\nto answer in that way.\n\n300\n00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.500\nBut you see as a developer,\nI've got to know everything that you do,\n\n301\n00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.520\nand as a tester I've got to\ntest every single one of those.\n\n302\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.367\nDo you know how infuriating it is,\nas a somebody who,\n\n303\n00:16:55.367 --> 00:17:01.210\nI cried often, I guess I've been\naround IT for way too long now.\n\n304\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:06.127\nI use my Tab key a lot to get\nbetween fields in various things,\n\n305\n00:17:06.127 --> 00:17:08.450\nlike an email for instance.\n\n306\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.187\nDo you know how frustrating\nit is when Tab doesn't work?\n\n307\n00:17:11.187 --> 00:17:16.253\nAnd tab takes me to somewhere else\ncompletely different than I wanted to be,\n\n308\n00:17:16.253 --> 00:17:20.541\nbecause I just thought tab was\ngonna take me into the next field.\n\n309\n00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:22.431\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Is when something in IT doesn't\n\n310\n00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:24.199\nwork the way you thought it would work.\n\n311\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but when something an IT doesn't\nwork the way I thought is was going to\n\n312\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.970\nwork or the way I expected it to work,\ninvariably, it's because\n\n313\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.220\nneither the developer nor the tester\nreally understood the customer experience.\n\n314\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n315\n00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.130\n&gt;&gt; Because we have not documented\nthe customer experience fully.\n\n316\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.623\nThat's really important,\nbecause the customer experience,\n\n317\n00:17:49.623 --> 00:17:54.195\nit's frustrating when software houses,\nthey'll update software or\n\n318\n00:17:54.195 --> 00:17:59.528\nthey update their apps, and then they\nwait until they've had complaints before,\n\n319\n00:17:59.528 --> 00:18:04.955\nthey then come back and say, yeah,\nwe fixed this, because this didn't work.\n\n320\n00:18:04.955 --> 00:18:07.538\nAnd this feature didn't\nwork when we updated and\n\n321\n00:18:07.538 --> 00:18:11.635\nthis feature didn't work when they\nupdated, because the tester missed it.\n\n322\n00:18:12.705 --> 00:18:15.065\nBecause what they missed was\nthe customer experience.\n\n323\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.316\nSo it's really important.\n\n324\n00:18:19.316 --> 00:18:23.512\nThis is key to good development is\nto understand your customer and\n\n325\n00:18:23.512 --> 00:18:26.730\nunderstand the map out\nthe customer experience.\n\n326\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.539\nMap out those interactions,\n\n327\n00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:32.830\nbecause if you don't understand\nthe way your customers work.\n\n328\n00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:37.360\nThen you're not gonna develop a product\nthat's going to work in that way.\n\n329\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.618\nAnd certainly your testing's not\ngoing to be comprehensive either.\n\n330\n00:18:40.618 --> 00:18:43.414\nNow, what your tester\nshould be able to do,\n\n331\n00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:48.099\nyour tester should be able to mimic\nwhat your customer and your user does,\n\n332\n00:18:48.099 --> 00:18:52.105\nas well as be able to test all of\nthe technical functionality and\n\n333\n00:18:52.105 --> 00:18:55.450\ntest that it doesn't\ngenerate any error messages.\n\n334\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.510\nYou looked as though you\nhad a question there.\n\n335\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.176\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm getting it, Jo [LAUGH].\n\n336\n00:19:01.176 --> 00:19:02.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're staying honest here.\n\n337\n00:19:02.688 --> 00:19:08.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so let's take\na look at our first slide then here,\n\n338\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.170\nand we talk about different tests here.\n\n339\n00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.236\nAnd we've got here\ntest-driven development.\n\n340\n00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:19.250\nThis is exactly what I've just said,\nthis is your test-first development.\n\n341\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.550\nSo test it as you're developing,\nbut you're testing,\n\n342\n00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.140\nwhat we're doing here is\nwe're testing the bones.\n\n343\n00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.233\nSo we're testing the coding,\nwe're doing the unit testing.\n\n344\n00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:32.471\nAnd it mentions here, I guess,\nI put in the word inspiration, but\n\n345\n00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:35.900\nit really is a foundation for\nother techniques.\n\n346\n00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.990\nSo we got to test that\nthe code works first.\n\n347\n00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.925\nRemember in our quadrant,\ntesting this was in quadrant one.\n\n348\n00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:42.919\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n349\n00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:48.610\n&gt;&gt; So, we're testing that the code works,\nthat it doesn't give us any errors.\n\n350\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:53.060\nThat it actually just works as\na stand alone piece of code.\n\n351\n00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.070\nAnd then on top of that,\nwe go into then look at\n\n352\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.610\nsort of Acceptance Test-Driven Development\nand Behavior-Driven Development.\n\n353\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:06.770\nAn Acceptance Test-Driven Development\nis developing for the end result.\n\n354\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:11.680\nIt's developing for the effectiveness\nof that particular piece of software.\n\n355\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.780\nSo does it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n356\n00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.363\nDoes it meet the acceptance\ntest requirements?\n\n357\n00:20:16.363 --> 00:20:20.025\nNotice that it doesn't send and\nreceive emails.\n\n358\n00:20:20.025 --> 00:20:24.825\n&gt;&gt; Right and that's something that you and\nthe customer or whomever like intra,\n\n359\n00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:27.962\nwithin your department\nthat's already defined.\n\n360\n00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:32.548\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, so that's something that\nI would expect that your customer\n\n361\n00:20:32.548 --> 00:20:36.919\nhas already said yes, I'm approving,\nthese are my requirements.\n\n362\n00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:41.495\nAnd this is what I'm gonna sign off on,\nas long as these work,\n\n363\n00:20:41.495 --> 00:20:43.620\nI'm gonna sign off on this.\n\n364\n00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.900\nNow, in service management we look at the\ndifference between a customer and a user.\n\n365\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:54.090\nAnd this is a customer acceptance test,\na customer is somebody who pays.\n\n366\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.910\nAnd the reason why we differentiate\nbetween a customer and\n\n367\n00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.820\na user is because the person that pays is\nnot necessarily the person that is going\n\n368\n00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.325\nto be using it all the time.\n\n369\n00:21:04.325 --> 00:21:05.710\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n370\n00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.940\n&gt;&gt; So just because something\nmeets the acceptance testing,\n\n371\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.360\njust because it meets the criteria doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's gonna be any good.\n\n372\n00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.930\nIn the previous episode\nwe took a look at Gmail.\n\n373\n00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.582\nI'm not saying that Gmail is bad at all\nby the way, before we get into that one.\n\n374\n00:21:21.582 --> 00:21:23.802\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I actually happens to like Gmail\n\n375\n00:21:23.802 --> 00:21:25.051\nfor certain things.\n\n376\n00:21:25.051 --> 00:21:28.122\nGmail would pass that\ncustomer acceptance test,\n\n377\n00:21:28.122 --> 00:21:30.750\nbecause it does what it's suppose to do.\n\n378\n00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.600\nIt's send and receive email.\n\n379\n00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.607\nSo it's absolutely fantastic for that.\n\n380\n00:21:35.607 --> 00:21:41.522\nHowever, what it wouldn't necessarily\npass, depending on the criteria,\n\n381\n00:21:41.522 --> 00:21:45.435\nwhat it wouldn't necessarily\npass would be this,\n\n382\n00:21:45.435 --> 00:21:51.660\nwhich would be the behavior driven\ndevelopment or the usability testing.\n\n383\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n384\n00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.770\n&gt;&gt; The usability testing is right, okay,\nwell it does what it's supposed to do, but\n\n385\n00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.840\ndoes it do it in a way that I like it?\n\n386\n00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.150\nSo behavior driven testing is\na little bit more ambiguous and\n\n387\n00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.130\nbehavior driven testing looks at.\n\n388\n00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:12.340\nSo it looks at just one story at a time\nand says, given this particular scenario,\n\n389\n00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.460\nwhen I do this,\nwhen I expect this to happen.\n\n390\n00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:22.027\nSo give another I'm using my cellphone\nwhen I click on new email or\n\n391\n00:22:22.027 --> 00:22:28.120\ncompose new email, then this is\nthe screen that I should be presented.\n\n392\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:33.209\nThat's what my behavior driven testing it,\nnow, all of these\n\n393\n00:22:33.209 --> 00:22:39.753\nyou'll notice that these last three slides\nI have had test driven development.\n\n394\n00:22:39.753 --> 00:22:45.079\nI've got acceptance test-driven\ndevelopment and I've got behavior-driven\n\n395\n00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:51.340\ndevelopment, because as I've already said\nwe should be developing the testing.\n\n396\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.300\nIf we don't develop the tests and\nwe don't develop the software in order for\n\n397\n00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:02.450\nus to be able to test it, then\nthe testing is not going to work, okay?\n\n398\n00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:06.090\nSo we test for, we said,\n\n399\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.280\njust to summarize, we test for\nits functionality.\n\n400\n00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.375\nDoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n401\n00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:15.700\nYeah, so does it do it without failure?\n\n402\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.670\nDoes it do it without error message?\n\n403\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.650\nAnd then does it actually\ngive us the given results?\n\n404\n00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.953\nDoes it deliver email?\n\n405\n00:23:23.953 --> 00:23:26.360\nDoes it send and receive email?\n\n406\n00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.010\nAnd then we have this behavior-driven\ndevelopment and behavior-driven\n\n407\n00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:34.340\ndevelopment is the usability side\nof things, where can I use it?\n\n408\n00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.270\nWhen I want to do this,\ngiven that this is my circumstance,\n\n409\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.731\nwhen I want to do this, can I actually\nget the result that I wanted to get?\n\n410\n00:23:43.731 --> 00:23:48.839\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so looking at our behavior\ndriven development testing so\n\n411\n00:23:48.839 --> 00:23:53.570\nmaybe After I've already passed\nmy acceptance testing and\n\n412\n00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.100\nI know that that's a go.\n\n413\n00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.930\nAnd I'm looking at this,\nI'm saying okay, I can send my email.\n\n414\n00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.370\nThat's already been checked off the list.\n\n415\n00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.393\nBut you know what?\nThere's this really cool little feature\n\n416\n00:24:03.393 --> 00:24:08.030\nfor maybe like, I don't know,\nsome kind of collaborative file sharing.\n\n417\n00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.780\nLike a SharePoint or\na Dropbox type technology.\n\n418\n00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.380\nAnd I find that users start using that or\n\n419\n00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.950\nmaybe that's a feature that\nreally wasn't focused on.\n\n420\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.490\nBut now it's kind of an emphasis.\n\n421\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.940\nSo I wanna make sure\nthat that's also working.\n\n422\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.460\nIs that what you're talking about here?\n\n423\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.610\n&gt;&gt; No, that might be an additional story.\n\n424\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.521\nBecause that sounds to me like\nadditional functionality.\n\n425\n00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:29.735\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n426\n00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:32.540\nAnd that's one thing that we\ndon't do in an Agile project.\n\n427\n00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.194\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In an Agile project,\n\n428\n00:24:34.194 --> 00:24:36.531\nwe don' move the goalposts as I would say.\n\n429\n00:24:36.531 --> 00:24:41.276\nOkay, my user story is my user story and\nif there's additional functionality,\n\n430\n00:24:41.276 --> 00:24:44.626\nthen although we accommodate change and\nwe love change,\n\n431\n00:24:44.626 --> 00:24:48.390\nany new functionality that comes\nin is an additional story.\n\n432\n00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n433\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.968\n&gt;&gt; What we doing here is, we're testing\nthat the original story that we\n\n434\n00:24:52.968 --> 00:24:56.533\nstarted to develop,\nwe're testing that that actually works.\n\n435\n00:24:56.533 --> 00:25:01.000\nAnd that it works in all of my, what I'm\ndoing here is I'm looking at my scenario.\n\n436\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.635\nSo what I'm saying is okay, I've\nlooked at in my acceptance test, well,\n\n437\n00:25:05.635 --> 00:25:09.970\nwhat I'm doing is I'm testing\nthat it sends and receives email.\n\n438\n00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.013\nAnd so the natural place\nto test that it sends and\n\n439\n00:25:13.013 --> 00:25:16.679\nreceives email is here on my laptop,\nso I'm doing that.\n\n440\n00:25:16.679 --> 00:25:21.585\nBut what I'm looking at here in my\nbehavior driven testing is, okay,\n\n441\n00:25:21.585 --> 00:25:26.505\nbut now, does it do it on my cell phone\nand now does it do it on my tablet.\n\n442\n00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:30.395\n&gt;&gt; Network and they're outside of our\norganization and things like that.\n\n443\n00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:33.198\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nI'm testing the same functionality-\n\n444\n00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.450\n&gt;&gt; Same feature got it.\n\n445\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.126\n&gt;&gt; But in different scenarios.\n\n446\n00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:39.812\nSo in this particular\nscenario does it work or\n\n447\n00:25:39.812 --> 00:25:43.830\nmaybe if I keep my caps\nlock on does this work.\n\n448\n00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:48.802\nMaybe things like you get those passwords,\ngood lord.\n\n449\n00:25:48.802 --> 00:25:50.618\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n450\n00:25:50.618 --> 00:25:53.310\nthose passwords that are case\nsensitive drive me mad.\n\n451\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.678\nI mean, and sometimes my PC reminds\nme that I've got my caps lock on and\n\n452\n00:25:57.678 --> 00:25:59.320\nother times it doesn't.\n\n453\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.112\nAnd sometimes these websites will\ntell you that your password,\n\n454\n00:26:04.112 --> 00:26:06.340\nthe field is case sensitive.\n\n455\n00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.160\nAnd sometimes,\nit doesn't even bother telling you.\n\n456\n00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.338\nSo you don't realize until you go to log\nin to that particular website again.\n\n457\n00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:14.980\n[LAUGH] That's frustrating.\n\n458\n00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.544\nBut that's again,\nabout mapping out the customer experience.\n\n459\n00:26:17.544 --> 00:26:24.850\nAnd development that doesn't understand\nthe full customer experience.\n\n460\n00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.590\nThat's what the result is.\n\n461\n00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:27.745\nThat's what you get.\n\n462\n00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:30.520\nIs something that's missed out.\n\n463\n00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:35.420\nSo something where again, going into\na password field where that password\n\n464\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.340\nsimply doesn't bother telling you whether\nthe case sensitivity is important or not.\n\n465\n00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.686\nThat's been overlooked and\n\n466\n00:26:41.686 --> 00:26:45.050\nit's been overlooked because\nit's been an assumption.\n\n467\n00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.187\nAnd it's been an assumption on\nthe part of the development team or\n\n468\n00:26:48.187 --> 00:26:51.450\nassumption on the part of the tester or\nmaybe an assumption on both.\n\n469\n00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.434\nAnd that's another downside\nto the developer and\n\n470\n00:26:54.434 --> 00:26:58.909\nthe tester actually working too closely\nduring the development process,\n\n471\n00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:01.480\nis that you can both\nassume the same thing.\n\n472\n00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.240\nIf I consult you while I'm developing.\n\n473\n00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.484\n&gt;&gt; We may have similar patterns or\n\n474\n00:27:07.484 --> 00:27:13.240\nwork experience that kind of twine us\ntogether and make those same mistakes.\n\n475\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.596\n&gt;&gt; Right and it means that you\ndon't actually test fully.\n\n476\n00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.063\nAnd it's not tested until\nit gets to the customer.\n\n477\n00:27:19.063 --> 00:27:23.433\nAnd then at that point in time that's when\nwe then have to bring in a new iteration\n\n478\n00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:27.087\nto probably amend something that\nwasn't quite developed right or\n\n479\n00:27:27.087 --> 00:27:30.174\nmaybe didn't quite worked\nthe way we expected it to do.\n\n480\n00:27:30.174 --> 00:27:35.390\nMost mistakes are made during this time.\n\n481\n00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:39.780\nMost mistakes in development\nare actually made because testing\n\n482\n00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.590\nwasn't sufficient enough.\n\n483\n00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:48.620\nAnd generally,\nthat is because we wrote down the user\n\n484\n00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:53.370\nstory, we acknowledged and\nwe agreed on the user story,\n\n485\n00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.670\nbut we didn't quite understand\nthe customer experience.\n\n486\n00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:02.040\nWe didn't understand the moments\nof truth and we didn't understand\n\n487\n00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.710\nwhat it is we were actually trying\nto develop and how the user worked.\n\n488\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.470\nAnd in fact, while we've been talking,\n\n489\n00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.370\nsomebody has mentioned in our chatroom\nabout yes you've got to do that.\n\n490\n00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:20.190\nIt does take more time, but you have to\nmap out those exact user moments of truth.\n\n491\n00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.740\nYou have to map out\nthe exact user experience.\n\n492\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.920\nYou cannot rely on assumptions.\n\n493\n00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.040\nAnd the thing is with IT is\nthat we're terrible for it.\n\n494\n00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.390\nWe really do.\n\n495\n00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.420\nCherokee is the worst, as we clearly see.\n\n496\n00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.619\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is twice she's done this now.\n\n497\n00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:39.134\n[LAUGH] But yeah,\nwe've gotta ensure that we understand\n\n498\n00:28:39.134 --> 00:28:44.250\nexactly what our customer and our user\nwant and how they're going to work.\n\n499\n00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:48.440\nAnd so we'll bring in people like business\nrelationship management type roles\n\n500\n00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.880\nthat can help us with that.\n\n501\n00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:56.300\nSo for this particular episode,\nreally the concentration has\n\n502\n00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.590\nbeen on the different types of development\nthat we have to do in order to be able to\n\n503\n00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:06.710\ntest and as I've said,\nwe are developing for testing.\n\n504\n00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:11.680\nSo remember, we have our test driven\ndevelopment where we're testing just\n\n505\n00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.500\nthe code and we're testing that it\ndoesn't have any particular errors.\n\n506\n00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.080\nWe have our acceptance test development,\nwhere we are testing for\n\n507\n00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.960\nthe end result, does it actually\ndo what it's supposed to do.\n\n508\n00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.310\nAnd then we've got our\nbehaviour driven development,\n\n509\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.020\nwhere we're testing various scenarios,\nwe're testing out that usability section.\n\n510\n00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:32.295\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, so\n\n511\n00:29:32.295 --> 00:29:35.373\ndo we have anymore testing to\ncover in this particular episode?\n\n512\n00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:38.428\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're going to test out\nstorytelling in our next episode, but\n\n513\n00:29:38.428 --> 00:29:39.400\nnot in this one no.\n\n514\n00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.280\n&gt;&gt; Storytelling, like circle time,\npick out our favourite book.\n\n515\n00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:42.998\n&gt;&gt; Yeah why not.\n\n516\n00:29:42.998 --> 00:29:45.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think I've got a few,\n\n517\n00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.750\nI'm not too sure which one I want\nto pick out as the, as my favorite.\n\n518\n00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.910\n&gt;&gt; You know nowadays we have Alexa and\nAlexa can read us books,\n\n519\n00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.390\nwe don't even have to read anymore.\n\n520\n00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.543\nCan you imagine how smart we're getting,\nlike with our smartphones and\n\n521\n00:29:57.543 --> 00:29:59.620\nnow our assistants,\nour virtual assistants.\n\n522\n00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.686\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nmy Alexa has got a British male voice.\n\n523\n00:30:03.686 --> 00:30:05.667\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, Alex.\n\n524\n00:30:05.667 --> 00:30:08.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyhow, we'll sign out.\n\n525\n00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.360\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n526\n00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n527\n00:30:16.464 --> 00:30:22.114\n[MUSIC]\n\n528\n00:30:22.114 --> 00:30:25.008\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:14.424\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to\nyour Agile testing series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:16.651\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:18.672\nIn this episode, just as Jo promised,\n\n8\n00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:21.384\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat some storytelling.\n\n9\n00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:24.601\nActually, we're gonna be testing for\nstory telling and\n\n10\n00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:29.171\nwith us today, we were able to go ahead\nand convince her to show up for storytime.\n\n11\n00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:30.441\nI mean testing time.\n\n12\n00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:34.397\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's why I showed up because\nyou were gonna make a mess of that\n\n13\n00:00:34.397 --> 00:00:35.212\none, right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:38.956\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Great, great, I couldn't help myself,\n\n15\n00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:41.328\nstory telling and circle time.\n\n16\n00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:44.663\nI have kids, so that's,\nmy mind travels there, I can't help it Jo.\n\n17\n00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:46.443\n&gt;&gt; Look, I did that deliberately.\n\n18\n00:00:46.443 --> 00:00:48.935\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sorry, but\nI did that deliberately, right?\n\n19\n00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:52.180\n[LAUGH] Yeah, we're gonna be testing for\nstorytelling.\n\n20\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.163\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in Agile stories.\n\n21\n00:00:55.163 --> 00:00:56.710\nWe know what stories are, right?\n\n22\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.524\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n23\n00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.198\n&gt;&gt; So what is the telling part of it?\n\n24\n00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:00.213\nHow does that work together?\n\n25\n00:01:00.213 --> 00:01:01.442\n&gt;&gt; Well, right, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:06.428\nSo stories traditionally start off\nwith once upon a time, I guess, yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:10.663\nThey usually end up with\nhappily ever after.\n\n28\n00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:13.065\nI know, maybe not,\nit depends what stories you read.\n\n29\n00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:14.374\nNot all the stories I read.\n\n30\n00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:18.299\nBut anyway, as far as Agile is concerned,\n\n31\n00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.450\nas far as product\ndevelopment is concerned.\n\n32\n00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.573\nWe use user stories and\nuser stories will tell us what our\n\n33\n00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:33.029\nusers want to see for\na particular piece of functionality.\n\n34\n00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:37.714\nStory telling is actually\nexpanding on that user story.\n\n35\n00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:41.519\nSo let's take a look at,\nI've got an example here over user story.\n\n36\n00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:44.755\nBear in mind that we\nare on testing mode here.\n\n37\n00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:47.190\nSo, here is the user story.\n\n38\n00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.347\nAnd a user story will always\nstart off with as a and\n\n39\n00:01:50.347 --> 00:01:54.507\nthen you define the customer and\nthen, you describe the need and\n\n40\n00:01:54.507 --> 00:01:58.374\nthen you'll say, so\nthat I have money where I need it to be.\n\n41\n00:01:58.374 --> 00:02:00.280\nOkay, so you describe the need and\n\n42\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.255\nthen you describe what it is\nyou want the result to be.\n\n43\n00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:09.261\nSo as a customer, I need to transfer\nmoney, so that it's where it needs to be.\n\n44\n00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.046\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n45\n00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:14.330\n&gt;&gt; Now we've looked at testing quadrants\nin a previous episode and in our last\n\n46\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.965\nepisode, we looked at the test driven\ndevelopment of acceptance tested, etc.\n\n47\n00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:23.412\nAnd now we're gonna look\nfurther at the storytelling and\n\n48\n00:02:23.412 --> 00:02:29.538\nhow all of these types of tests fit in\nwith, you might think of it as scenarios.\n\n49\n00:02:29.538 --> 00:02:33.515\nAs a bank customer,\nI need to transfer money, so\n\n50\n00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:36.916\nthat I've got money where it needs to be.\n\n51\n00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:41.241\nJust think about now then the types\nof transfers that there are.\n\n52\n00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:45.657\nSo you might want to\nschedule a future transfer.\n\n53\n00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:49.196\nYou might want to review\nyour scheduled transfers.\n\n54\n00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:52.763\nYou might want to schedule\nan immediate transfer.\n\n55\n00:02:52.763 --> 00:02:56.793\nYou might want to cancel a transfer,\nyour transfer might be between internal\n\n56\n00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:59.533\naccounts or\nit might be between external accounts.\n\n57\n00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:04.500\nYou might want to ensure\nwhat you definitely want to\n\n58\n00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.594\nensure that it's being completed,\nright, yeah.\n\n59\n00:03:09.594 --> 00:03:13.261\nBut you might want it on a statement or\nyou might not want it on a statement.\n\n60\n00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:14.654\nYou might want it on an email.\n\n61\n00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:16.444\nNow, I'm not too sure about you.\n\n62\n00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:19.484\nBut when I transfer money\nbetween my accounts,\n\n63\n00:03:19.484 --> 00:03:22.227\nI don't want an email\nevery time I do that.\n\n64\n00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:24.624\nI just want a little pop up to say,\nhey, that's been done.\n\n65\n00:03:24.624 --> 00:03:26.750\nThat's great.\n\n66\n00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.135\nWhat we've done,\n\n67\n00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:33.688\nis we've taken the actual user story\nwhich is right at the beginning there.\n\n68\n00:03:33.688 --> 00:03:36.175\nAs the bank customer or so\nright in the middle of the screen.\n\n69\n00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:40.000\nI need to transfer money\nbetween my accounts, so\n\n70\n00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.119\nthat I can validate an icon,\nreconcile my records.\n\n71\n00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.393\nSo I've got money where I need it to be.\n\n72\n00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.482\nThis is my story.\n\n73\n00:03:48.482 --> 00:03:54.290\nWhat I've got here though,\nis what I want to call my epic story.\n\n74\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.984\nAnd do you remember\nwhat an epic story was?\n\n75\n00:03:56.984 --> 00:03:59.640\nIt wasn't just a great story.\n\n76\n00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.379\n&gt;&gt; It was an epic story.\n\n77\n00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.782\nLet me tell you about it, Jo.\n\n78\n00:04:04.782 --> 00:04:07.866\nA bundle or\ncompilation of multiple stories.\n\n79\n00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:08.988\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n80\n00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:11.979\nSo it could be a compilation\nof multiple story, so\n\n81\n00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:15.413\nit could be various scenarios\non exactly the same story.\n\n82\n00:04:15.413 --> 00:04:15.969\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n83\n00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:20.432\n&gt;&gt; So what you've got here and\nthis is why we call this story telling,\n\n84\n00:04:20.432 --> 00:04:24.657\nwhat you've got here is basically\nyou've got an epic story but\n\n85\n00:04:24.657 --> 00:04:28.343\nthey're all, well,\nthey're all on the same thing.\n\n86\n00:04:28.343 --> 00:04:32.227\nSo they're all stories that\nare relating to exactly the same theme.\n\n87\n00:04:32.227 --> 00:04:37.142\nWhich is this original theme of\ntransferring money between accounts.\n\n88\n00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:41.227\nSo that would be the title\nof my epic story.\n\n89\n00:04:41.227 --> 00:04:43.752\nMy storytelling looks at all the, well,\n\n90\n00:04:43.752 --> 00:04:46.649\nyou might want to thinks\nof them as sub stories.\n\n91\n00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:48.576\nThat's not we call them\nin our job by the way.\n\n92\n00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:49.963\nWe just call them individual stories.\n\n93\n00:04:49.963 --> 00:04:53.654\nBut you might want to think of them\nas sub stories to that epic story.\n\n94\n00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:57.701\nSo what you have is one\nstory right infront of you.\n\n95\n00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:01.383\nAnd that is it's about customer and I need\nto transfer money between my accounts.\n\n96\n00:05:01.383 --> 00:05:03.512\nSo I've got money where I need it to be.\n\n97\n00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:07.680\nAnd then I've got all of these sub\nstories scheduled in a future transfer,\n\n98\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.879\nreviewing a schedule transfer, etc.\n\n99\n00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:18.822\nNow, we're in development right now and\nwe're also gonna focus purely on testing.\n\n100\n00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:22.437\nBut I've got a couple of\nthings that I wanna say.\n\n101\n00:05:22.437 --> 00:05:25.300\nHow long is an iteration or sprint?\n\n102\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.180\n&gt;&gt; One to four weeks.\n\n103\n00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.513\n&gt;&gt; One to four weeks, okay.\n\n104\n00:05:27.513 --> 00:05:31.316\nSo, what we've got right in front\nof us now is we've got five?\n\n105\n00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:32.104\nFive stories.\n\n106\n00:05:32.104 --> 00:05:33.638\n&gt;&gt; One, two, three, four, five, yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:35.112\n&gt;&gt; Five sort of sub-stories, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:36.291\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can count, yay.\n\n109\n00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:36.933\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's all right,\n\n110\n00:05:36.933 --> 00:05:37.656\nI had to do that as well.\n\n111\n00:05:37.656 --> 00:05:39.906\nThat's why I-\n&gt;&gt; Storytime and one, two, three.\n\n112\n00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:43.588\n&gt;&gt; That's why I was looking at it,\ngoing [LAUGH] a little bit cross eyed.\n\n113\n00:05:43.588 --> 00:05:46.154\nBut yeah, so we got five stories there.\n\n114\n00:05:46.154 --> 00:05:53.321\nDo you think that we want to put each\none of these into one iteration?\n\n115\n00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:54.961\nDo we put them all in one iteration?\n\n116\n00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:58.705\n&gt;&gt; No, all right, at least I wouldn't and\nI would just be you.\n\n117\n00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:01.713\nDragging things out,\nyou've got other work to do.\n\n118\n00:06:01.713 --> 00:06:06.834\n&gt;&gt; But are you gonna release these then,\nseparately to your customers?\n\n119\n00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:10.238\n&gt;&gt; Hmm, review scheduled transfers.\n\n120\n00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:12.633\nReleased them separately,\nI'm gonna say no.\n\n121\n00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:14.153\nI wanna see it all.\n\n122\n00:06:14.153 --> 00:06:18.023\nI wanna see the holistic package, I wanna\nsee all the features delivered to me.\n\n123\n00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:20.413\nLike I don't wanna get a car with a wheel,\n\n124\n00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:23.824\njust a wheel delivered to me\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I mean if you think about\n\n125\n00:06:23.824 --> 00:06:28.190\nthat common analogy, what you've got,\nis you've got different user stories.\n\n126\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.125\nOne might be the steering wheel,\nthe ability to steer.\n\n127\n00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:33.640\nAnd another one might be its\nability to go along the road, so\n\n128\n00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.861\nyou might have four wheels.\n\n129\n00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:37.509\nOr you're not gonna have a car,\nas you say, with four wheels but\n\n130\n00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:38.352\nno steering wheel.\n\n131\n00:06:38.352 --> 00:06:40.556\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's just not gonna work.\n\n132\n00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:44.532\nNow don't forget, go back to\nyour IGL fundamentals series and\n\n133\n00:06:44.532 --> 00:06:47.834\nwe looked at releases and\nwe looked at iterations and\n\n134\n00:06:47.834 --> 00:06:50.927\na release might contain\na number of iterations.\n\n135\n00:06:50.927 --> 00:06:55.401\nSo once it might seem to you and\nprobably to Cherokee as well,\n\n136\n00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.786\nthat I asked the same question.\n\n137\n00:06:57.786 --> 00:06:58.920\nI didn't-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n138\n00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.804\n&gt;&gt; Because the question that I asked was\ndo you want to really see through these or\n\n139\n00:07:02.804 --> 00:07:06.059\ndo you want to include each one\nof these in just one integration.\n\n140\n00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.884\nAnd then I said, do you wanna release\nthem all at the same time, though.\n\n141\n00:07:08.884 --> 00:07:11.305\nAnd of course,\nan iteration is different to a release.\n\n142\n00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:16.933\nSo what we're gonna do is we're probably\ngoing to maybe do two in each iteration.\n\n143\n00:07:16.933 --> 00:07:19.231\nOr maybe even do five iterations but\n\n144\n00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:23.836\nwe'll wait until they're all ready\nbefore we release them together.\n\n145\n00:07:23.836 --> 00:07:27.141\nThus challenge number one is that for\nthe developmentee and\n\n146\n00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:31.055\ndon't forget we're in agile, so\nwe're working collaboratively.\n\n147\n00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:34.175\nSo there is no one person that is\ngoing to say you're doing this and\n\n148\n00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:35.214\nyou're doing that.\n\n149\n00:07:35.214 --> 00:07:36.862\nFor the development team,\n\n150\n00:07:36.862 --> 00:07:41.961\nwe're gonna work out which story we're\ngoing to cover within which iteration.\n\n151\n00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.165\n&gt;&gt; In our time estimations.\n\n152\n00:07:43.165 --> 00:07:44.073\nI remember that.\n\n153\n00:07:44.073 --> 00:07:45.059\nThat was fun, Jo.\n\n154\n00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:47.942\n&gt;&gt; Right and we've got to do\nour time estimations as well.\n\n155\n00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:52.857\nWho is it that has the ultimate say,\nin what gets included in what iteration?\n\n156\n00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:55.105\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be the product owner.\n\n157\n00:07:55.105 --> 00:07:55.656\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n158\n00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:56.831\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n159\n00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:57.992\n&gt;&gt; That's our product owner.\n\n160\n00:07:57.992 --> 00:08:02.970\nSo we're gonna break these down into\nindividual stories, still part of\n\n161\n00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.801\none epic story but what we're going\nto release is that one epic story.\n\n162\n00:08:09.804 --> 00:08:14.444\nThat's just the development side\nof things that are covered, now,\n\n163\n00:08:14.444 --> 00:08:19.724\nwe've gotta look at the testing, so\nnow we've got five individual stories.\n\n164\n00:08:19.724 --> 00:08:22.508\nFive sub-stories, five individual stories.\n\n165\n00:08:22.508 --> 00:08:25.425\nHowever you want to think of these.\n\n166\n00:08:25.425 --> 00:08:28.239\nSo what sort of testing do we need to do?\n\n167\n00:08:28.239 --> 00:08:31.013\nAnd it says there,\nthere's a prompt at the bottom.\n\n168\n00:08:31.013 --> 00:08:34.701\nFor complete feature testing,\nwhat kind of testing do we need to do?\n\n169\n00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:35.597\nAnd here's a refresher.\n\n170\n00:08:35.597 --> 00:08:36.620\nJust go back here.\n\n171\n00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.527\nRemember, we've got test\ndriven development.\n\n172\n00:08:39.527 --> 00:08:44.388\nWe've got the acceptance test and we've\nalso got our behavior driven development,\n\n173\n00:08:44.388 --> 00:08:45.481\nso behavior test.\n\n174\n00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:48.169\nSo for instance, a test driven,\n\n175\n00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:53.354\nwhile test driven is all focused\non the functionality itself and\n\n176\n00:08:53.354 --> 00:09:00.188\nwhether it generates any error messages\nbut then you've got your acceptance test.\n\n177\n00:09:00.188 --> 00:09:05.257\nSo if your acceptance tests, we're\nlooking at scheduling future transfer or\n\n178\n00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:07.502\nreviewing scheduled transfers.\n\n179\n00:09:07.502 --> 00:09:12.037\nSo we want to test that each\none of these stories delivers\n\n180\n00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:15.422\nexactly what it's supposed to deliver.\n\n181\n00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:17.996\nAnd that's gonna be\ndone at each iteration,\n\n182\n00:09:17.996 --> 00:09:21.260\nno matter how many stories\nwe've got in each iteration.\n\n183\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.405\nWe all going to be testing each story-\n&gt;&gt; Iteration.\n\n184\n00:09:25.405 --> 00:09:27.367\n&gt;&gt; One iteration per story, right.\n\n185\n00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:33.012\n&gt;&gt; So if we did break it up into two per,\nthen we have two testing situations.\n\n186\n00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:37.649\n&gt;&gt; Right,now though because I don't\nlike to keep things simple, right?\n\n187\n00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:39.910\nIt's gonna get a bit complicated.\n\n188\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.549\nBut in agile,\nwe like to keep things simple and\n\n189\n00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:46.419\nthis is gonna get complicated and\nI'm not gonna pretend it's not.\n\n190\n00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.988\nSo now,\nlet's take a look at these stories though.\n\n191\n00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:51.522\nDoes any one of these\nactually work in isolation?\n\n192\n00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.309\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking, I'm thinking.\n\n193\n00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:04.416\nI think there could be a situation.\n\n194\n00:10:04.416 --> 00:10:08.004\nI can think of scenarios\nwhere they tie together.\n\n195\n00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:15.430\nI can't think of a situation where it\nwould be completely independent transfers.\n\n196\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.256\n&gt;&gt; No, no, so\nthere's a challenge as well, so\n\n197\n00:10:19.256 --> 00:10:24.093\nreally all you can do when\nyou're testing an isolation,\n\n198\n00:10:24.093 --> 00:10:29.533\nis all you can do is this test driven,\nthe initial functionality\n\n199\n00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:34.198\nto make sure that it doesn't\nhave any error messages.\n\n200\n00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:36.993\nBut then you're gonna\ntest everything together.\n\n201\n00:10:36.993 --> 00:10:41.484\nBecause you see, let's take a look\nat the stories, if you're gonna\n\n202\n00:10:41.484 --> 00:10:46.527\nschedule a future transfer, you've\ngotta be able to review that transfer.\n\n203\n00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:49.527\nSo that's a on the first\none having it happen and\n\n204\n00:10:49.527 --> 00:10:53.655\nthe third one's a dependency on\nthat first one having happened.\n\n205\n00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:58.128\n&gt;&gt; And definitely the fourth one because\nif you're scheduling an internal transfer,\n\n206\n00:10:58.128 --> 00:11:01.416\nit doesn't specifically say external or\ninternal there so.\n\n207\n00:11:01.416 --> 00:11:06.576\n&gt;&gt; Right, right and you actually\nhave to transfer the money as well.\n\n208\n00:11:06.576 --> 00:11:11.546\nAnd then afterwards, you've gotta see that\nwhat you have done is on the statement or\n\n209\n00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.277\nyou might choose to or\nyou might choose not to.\n\n210\n00:11:14.277 --> 00:11:17.642\nSo none of these actually working\nin isolation, not one of them.\n\n211\n00:11:17.642 --> 00:11:24.009\nSo the only type of testing that\nyou can do is the functionality.\n\n212\n00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:28.226\nEverything else,\nthe acceptance testing and\n\n213\n00:11:28.226 --> 00:11:32.659\nthe behavior-driven testing\nis going to be done\n\n214\n00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:37.102\npretty much hand in hand\nwith the other stories.\n\n215\n00:11:37.102 --> 00:11:39.988\nSo it's not quite as simple as it sounds,\n\n216\n00:11:39.988 --> 00:11:43.542\nwe'd like to keep it simple\nbecause this is agile.\n\n217\n00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:49.344\nWe'd like to keep it simple but\nat the end of the day, you can't always.\n\n218\n00:11:49.344 --> 00:11:52.024\nAnd so\nyou have to acknowledge that sometimes,\n\n219\n00:11:52.024 --> 00:11:54.373\nwhat you might want to do each iteration.\n\n220\n00:11:54.373 --> 00:11:58.582\nAnd you might want to save the development\nand break it down into chunks, into\n\n221\n00:11:58.582 --> 00:12:02.949\neach iteration and you might wanna do the\ntest in for each iteration at the time.\n\n222\n00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:07.301\nBut sometimes you can't, sometimes we have\nto wait until we've got the release ready\n\n223\n00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:08.799\nand then we test the release.\n\n224\n00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:10.794\nWe can still test the functionality.\n\n225\n00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:14.185\nIn other words, we can still test that\nit doesn't have any error messages.\n\n226\n00:12:14.185 --> 00:12:19.829\nBut you still have to test that again,\nonce you've got the entire release ready.\n\n227\n00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:24.915\nYou still have to test the entire\nthing to make sure that\n\n228\n00:12:24.915 --> 00:12:31.121\nit doesn't have any error messages,\nkinda makes sense, I hope.\n\n229\n00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:31.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n230\n00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.043\n&gt;&gt; A little bit more\ncomplicated than just,\n\n231\n00:12:34.043 --> 00:12:38.261\nyou look at it on the screen, that's okay,\nthat makes sense, it's simple.\n\n232\n00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:41.717\nBut actually when we start dissecting\nit and pulling it apart and\n\n233\n00:12:41.717 --> 00:12:45.173\nyou realize that there's a bit\nmore to it then it first appears.\n\n234\n00:12:45.173 --> 00:12:47.694\nAnd this is where some\nof our problems lie.\n\n235\n00:12:47.694 --> 00:12:51.090\nAnd this is where some of our\nfailures occur because well,\n\n236\n00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.320\nwe just don't get the testing right.\n\n237\n00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.604\nWe just don't test enough.\n\n238\n00:12:54.604 --> 00:12:56.394\nAnd we don't think about dependencies.\n\n239\n00:12:56.394 --> 00:13:01.422\nAnd we don't think about how one test\nis going to impact on another test and\n\n240\n00:13:01.422 --> 00:13:04.909\nhow the simple fact is we've\ngotta have all of these\n\n241\n00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.822\nfeatures working together\nbefore that we can test them.\n\n242\n00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:13.700\nOkay, so we've also got something\nthat we call exploratory testing.\n\n243\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.799\nAnd exploratory testing is kind of,\nI like to call this the what if testing.\n\n244\n00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:22.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know what, I was just\nthinking that, I'm like it doesn't seem so\n\n245\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.335\ncrazy because in my mind what I\nwould do is keep at it, keep trying.\n\n246\n00:13:26.335 --> 00:13:29.465\nAnd so, I don't know what exploratory\ntesting is, I never heard of this term,\n\n247\n00:13:29.465 --> 00:13:31.069\nI know you're going to explain it to us.\n\n248\n00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:35.938\nBut it seems like maybe this is\nwhere my mind was travelling to.\n\n249\n00:13:35.938 --> 00:13:42.507\nBeing agile, you should be able to look\nat things and in a not so rigid manner.\n\n250\n00:13:42.507 --> 00:13:48.014\n&gt;&gt; Right, and exploratory test, I like\nto call this what if or let's pretend.\n\n251\n00:13:48.014 --> 00:13:51.128\nWe look at this when we look\nat capacity management.\n\n252\n00:13:51.128 --> 00:13:56.011\nWhen we're planning capacity, we quite\noften do something called modeling and\n\n253\n00:13:56.011 --> 00:14:00.676\nmodeling well, what if we add an extra\n500 people to our infrastructure,\n\n254\n00:14:00.676 --> 00:14:02.349\nwhat impact would that be?\n\n255\n00:14:02.349 --> 00:14:05.228\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so that's when we would use this.\n\n256\n00:14:05.228 --> 00:14:05.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n257\n00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.809\n&gt;&gt; Because we test, we explore and\nthen we analyze and learn,\n\n258\n00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:13.780\nwhat that means is that we're\ntesting various scenarios.\n\n259\n00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.696\nSo you might think about it\nas scenario based testing but\n\n260\n00:14:16.696 --> 00:14:18.816\nwe are testing just various scenarios.\n\n261\n00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:20.954\nWhat if I did this, what if I did that?\n\n262\n00:14:20.954 --> 00:14:25.337\nLet's pretend that this happens,\nthen what will the result be?\n\n263\n00:14:25.337 --> 00:14:30.287\nSo, you might call it hypothetical\ntesting, answering or\n\n264\n00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:33.158\nasking hypothetical questions or\n\n265\n00:14:33.158 --> 00:14:38.513\nasking questions where we simply\ndon't have an answer to them.\n\n266\n00:14:38.513 --> 00:14:42.573\nBut we think of it as exploratory testing,\nit's less pertained and yeah, I like to\n\n267\n00:14:42.573 --> 00:14:46.234\nput it in plain and simple English\ncuz we're still story telling, right?\n\n268\n00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:47.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n269\n00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.614\nDo you remember science fair project?\n\n270\n00:14:49.614 --> 00:14:52.209\nI don't know I just thought about\nthat with those tri-fold boards.\n\n271\n00:14:52.209 --> 00:14:53.182\nDid you guys have those?\n\n272\n00:14:53.182 --> 00:14:55.502\n&gt;&gt; No,\nwe never used to do those at school.\n\n273\n00:14:55.502 --> 00:14:59.079\n&gt;&gt; Explory testing, we have to have\na little hypothesis and everything.\n\n274\n00:15:00.507 --> 00:15:01.179\n&gt;&gt; Ta-da!\n\n275\n00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:04.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now look you know what I'm\n\n276\n00:15:04.144 --> 00:15:04.822\ntalking about.\n\n277\n00:15:04.822 --> 00:15:08.881\n&gt;&gt; No, not everybody does but that looked\nlike something off the Price is Right or\n\n278\n00:15:08.881 --> 00:15:10.060\nsomething like that.\n\n279\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.978\n&gt;&gt; I know, you had to talk about\nyour little experiment and\n\n280\n00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:16.280\nyour tests that you performed\nthen whatever it is you chose so.\n\n281\n00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.896\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Cherokee's preparing for\n\n282\n00:15:17.896 --> 00:15:19.404\nthe hosting aren't you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:15:19.404 --> 00:15:20.430\n&gt;&gt; On one of these gameshows,\n\n284\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.931\nthat's what all that was about.\n\n285\n00:15:21.931 --> 00:15:24.615\n&gt;&gt; Family Feud that would be my,\nif I could choose one,\n\n286\n00:15:24.615 --> 00:15:26.633\nI think that looks like such a fun show.\n\n287\n00:15:26.633 --> 00:15:29.116\n&gt;&gt; I just would want to go\non that just for that noise-\n\n288\n00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:30.014\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:15:30.014 --> 00:15:31.049\n&gt;&gt; When you get something wrong and\n\n290\n00:15:31.049 --> 00:15:34.320\nI'm not going to do that right now-\n&gt;&gt; But I wouldn't be the creepy host\n\n291\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.252\nwho always kisses people,\nyou know what I'm talking about,\n\n292\n00:15:38.252 --> 00:15:42.428\nthey did that in the older versions\non the mouth and stuff I think.\n\n293\n00:15:42.428 --> 00:15:45.490\n&gt;&gt; And on that note,\nlet's carry on with our testing please,\n\n294\n00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.970\nif you don't mind, right?\n\n295\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.280\nAnd then let's quickly jump\ninto non-functional testing.\n\n296\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.685\nSeems to be a good place to be, right?\n\n297\n00:15:53.685 --> 00:15:58.113\nNon-functional testing is about testing\nthat customer experience, again,\n\n298\n00:15:58.113 --> 00:16:00.235\nthe non-functional requirements.\n\n299\n00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:03.633\nSometimes you might think\nof this as nice to have.\n\n300\n00:16:03.633 --> 00:16:09.369\nBut sometimes, it's just, it's a feature\nthat doesn't actually do anything but\n\n301\n00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:12.047\nthen there is a specific requirement.\n\n302\n00:16:12.047 --> 00:16:13.014\nI ask a question.\n\n303\n00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:14.825\nI ask this to Cherokee quite a lot.\n\n304\n00:16:14.825 --> 00:16:19.793\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n\n309\n00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:28.471\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n310\n00:16:28.471 --> 00:16:30.988\n&gt;&gt; Dang it, you know I wanted to ask\nthat at stand up this morning too.\n\n311\n00:16:30.988 --> 00:16:32.427\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking about it and\n\n312\n00:16:32.427 --> 00:16:34.802\nI'm like people are going to\nthink I'm weird if I ask it.\n\n313\n00:16:34.802 --> 00:16:37.402\n[LAUGH] If theres no one color blind but\nI knew you were going to,\n\n314\n00:16:37.402 --> 00:16:39.257\nI had a feeling you were\ngoing to ask me that.\n\n315\n00:16:39.257 --> 00:16:40.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but\nthen they're going to say, hell,\n\n316\n00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.493\nwell she's working with Joan this week,\nso what'd you excpect?\n\n317\n00:16:42.493 --> 00:16:45.336\nWho knows what's going to happen?\n\n318\n00:16:45.336 --> 00:16:48.701\nBut the simple fact is we don't\nbother to find out and we don't.\n\n319\n00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:52.859\nI'm just as much as fault as you are\nbecause I don't know who's colorblind and\n\n320\n00:16:52.859 --> 00:16:54.813\nyou don't know who's colorblind.\n\n321\n00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:57.096\nThat's a nonfunctional requirement.\n\n322\n00:16:57.096 --> 00:17:01.997\nIt doesn't actually serve any functional\npurpose other than the fact that\n\n323\n00:17:01.997 --> 00:17:05.731\nsome people cannot distinguish\nbetween red and green and\n\n324\n00:17:05.731 --> 00:17:09.949\ntherefore if you've got what we\ncall a slam chart or a rag chart.\n\n325\n00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:13.094\nThe red and the green chart to\ndenote performance good and bad,\n\n326\n00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:15.764\nwhat's the point in having a red and\nthe green chart,\n\n327\n00:17:15.764 --> 00:17:18.457\nif people can't distinguish\nbetween red and green?\n\n328\n00:17:18.457 --> 00:17:20.502\nIt doesn't make any sense and so,\n\n329\n00:17:20.502 --> 00:17:24.603\nwe call those sort of requirements\nnon-functionla requirements.\n\n330\n00:17:24.603 --> 00:17:29.476\nThey are not going to add any feature,\nthey are not\n\n331\n00:17:29.476 --> 00:17:34.594\ngoing to add any enhancement\nto the functionality.\n\n332\n00:17:34.594 --> 00:17:38.541\nBut it's something tha is needed,\nit's something that's a requirement and\n\n333\n00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:40.710\nit's something that we should consider.\n\n334\n00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.148\nAnd we should be testing that,\nwe should be testing that okay,\n\n335\n00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:47.925\nif I have devised this in a way there is.\n\n336\n00:17:47.925 --> 00:17:53.042\nIt's not red and the green anymore,\nit might be orange blue and pink or\n\n337\n00:17:53.042 --> 00:17:58.526\nsomething, then If I've done that and\nthen I need to test that that works.\n\n338\n00:17:58.526 --> 00:18:02.609\nSo that's why we have none functional\ntesting just to test those other features.\n\n339\n00:18:02.609 --> 00:18:05.091\nAnd these are not nice to have features,\n\n340\n00:18:05.091 --> 00:18:07.723\ndo not get these mixed\nup with nice to have.\n\n341\n00:18:07.723 --> 00:18:11.497\nCuz sometimes these are just\nas much of a requirement,\n\n342\n00:18:11.497 --> 00:18:14.128\nas the functional requirements are.\n\n343\n00:18:14.128 --> 00:18:18.733\nAnd this is not just about delivering\nsomething that will do something,\n\n344\n00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:23.940\nthis is just about, in this particular\ncase, it's about having the right colors\n\n345\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:29.015\non the screen and that can be just as\nimportant as the functional requirements.\n\n346\n00:18:29.015 --> 00:18:33.363\nSo let's not forget those.\n\n347\n00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.416\nBut what we've done right now, is we've,\n\n348\n00:18:35.416 --> 00:18:39.024\nover the last sort of three episodes,\nwe've looked at testing quadrants and\n\n349\n00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:41.537\nwe've looked at the type of\ntesting that we might do.\n\n350\n00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:46.761\nAnd then here, we've looked at how we test\nfor complete stories, an epic stories,\n\n351\n00:18:46.761 --> 00:18:51.781\nas well as the so and how those particular\ntest applies to each individual story.\n\n352\n00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:55.593\nAnd on next step is we are going\nto explore further the roles and\n\n353\n00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:59.492\nresponsibilities within an agile team and\ndevelopment team.\n\n354\n00:18:59.492 --> 00:19:03.275\nAnd who does what and then all that we\nhave looked at in previous episodes but\n\n355\n00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:05.937\nwe are just going to explore\nthat a little bit further\n\n356\n00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.863\n&gt;&gt; And they all lived happily ever after.\n\n357\n00:19:07.863 --> 00:19:11.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know I couldn't resist Joe.\n\n358\n00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:13.173\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n359\n00:19:13.173 --> 00:19:16.698\nokay you don't need to tell\nthe story that I do, right?\n\n360\n00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Thank you guys so much for\njoining us today but we're gonna sign out,\n\n361\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.082\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose,\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Joe Peacock\n\n362\n00:19:22.082 --> 00:19:23.562\n&gt;&gt;

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:11.555\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:14.239\n&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone to\nyour Agile Testing series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.590\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.030\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat responsibilities in test planning, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.250\nof course, with us today in studios,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n8\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.340\nHow's it going, Jo?\n\n9\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.898\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:27.491\nHow are you?\n\n11\n00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:28.954\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, I'm a little nervous.\n\n12\n00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:33.226\nI feel I might be given some extra\nadditional responsibilities during this\n\n13\n00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:34.933\nshow, is that gonna happen?\n\n14\n00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.223\n&gt;&gt; Well, I could.\n\n15\n00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:37.483\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could, but\n\n16\n00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:40.565\nI'm not too sure whether I really wanna\nadd onto your work load because I'm kind\n\n17\n00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:43.487\nof thinking that we're a little bit-\n&gt;&gt; You don't think I can handle it, Jo?\n\n18\n00:00:43.487 --> 00:00:44.998\n&gt;&gt; No, no, in a word, no.\n\n19\n00:00:44.998 --> 00:00:47.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, but seriously.\n\n20\n00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.213\n&gt;&gt; Look at the concern on my face,\nright, yeah?\n\n21\n00:00:49.213 --> 00:00:51.878\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But in seriousness though,\n\n22\n00:00:51.878 --> 00:00:54.402\nwe are gonna be talking\nabout responsibilities.\n\n23\n00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:59.067\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be really looking at\na very high level of responsibilities in\n\n24\n00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:01.334\nterms of testing and who does what.\n\n25\n00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:05.107\n&gt;&gt; But we're also going to be looking\nat sort of planning for testing.\n\n26\n00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:09.310\nNow, I know that we discussed in previous\nepisodes the types of test that we do.\n\n27\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.833\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n28\n00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:13.915\n&gt;&gt; And we've already talked as well in\nprevious episodes about the fact that we\n\n29\n00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:16.159\ndesign and we develop for it to be tested.\n\n30\n00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.064\nAnd now, we're gonna talk a little bit\nabout how we plan for those tests as well,\n\n31\n00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:24.252\nmaking sure that well,\ntesting is part of our plan.\n\n32\n00:01:24.252 --> 00:01:27.892\nWe talked in a previous episode about\nmaking sure the test is part of\n\n33\n00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:29.330\nthe development.\n\n34\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.740\nBut when we actually plan iteration, we're\ngonna make sure that we plan to allow for\n\n35\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.260\ntesting as well because that's\nsomething else that's really important.\n\n36\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.470\nThis is about ensuring that\nwe've got time for testing.\n\n37\n00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.377\nI wonder how many times the test is\ncut short because we ran out of time.\n\n38\n00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:48.559\n&gt;&gt; I actually I watched a video.\n\n39\n00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:52.868\nYou see these development\nboot camps popping up.\n\n40\n00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:53.924\nIt's kind of in trend, right?\n\n41\n00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:57.838\nSo where they are a crash course and\nyou get these long hours to study.\n\n42\n00:01:57.838 --> 00:02:02.278\nAnd after one of the cohorts,\nthey had kind of a reunion for\n\n43\n00:02:02.278 --> 00:02:06.060\nall of the individuals who participated.\n\n44\n00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.843\nAnd they just went back.\n\n45\n00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:11.554\nAnd they were asking them, what some\nthings that you'd wish someone would\n\n46\n00:02:11.554 --> 00:02:15.180\nhave told you about when you\nentered into the workforce?\n\n47\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.410\nWhen you got your first development job?\n\n48\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.190\nAnd I think across the board they all\nsaid that they weren't prepared for\n\n49\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.252\nthe pressure that was put on them to\nhave continuous product being delivered.\n\n50\n00:02:30.252 --> 00:02:33.750\nAnd sometimes when they're studying and\nlearning about it, they're hearing\n\n51\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.948\nprobably about someone like you\nexplaining about testing to them, Jo.\n\n52\n00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:39.916\nBut they noticed when they\ngot into the workforce,\n\n53\n00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:44.620\nit was more about quantity versus quality\nand they just couldn't believe that.\n\n54\n00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.170\nBut unfortunately,\nthat can happen sometimes.\n\n55\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.561\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's funny because people\noften think that in an agile environment,\n\n56\n00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:53.291\nwe don't do any testing at all.\n\n57\n00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.719\nAnd this completely the opposite.\n\n58\n00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.854\nWe do test and we do a lot of testing.\n\n59\n00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:01.529\nWe got to make sure that\nwe plan to test and\n\n60\n00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.879\nthat we include testing because\nthere's always that pressure.\n\n61\n00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.175\nAnd this pressure on agile team even more\nso that there is a waterfall approach.\n\n62\n00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:14.026\nWith a waterfall approach to project\nmanagement, you've got the delivery right\n\n63\n00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:17.390\nat the very end of the product,\nat the very end of the project, rather.\n\n64\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.853\nAnd you're delivering that product then.\n\n65\n00:03:18.853 --> 00:03:24.090\nAnd so you kinda set a time aside for\nthe testing and you said, right, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.072\nThe last, maybe, months of this particular\nproject is gonna be spent in testing with\n\n67\n00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:30.285\nan agile approach.\n\n68\n00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:34.303\nYou've only got well,\nup to four weeks per iteration.\n\n69\n00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:37.070\nAnd throughout the agile\nfundamentals class and\n\n70\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.238\nthroughout this particular class, I have\nbeen stressing how time bound we are.\n\n71\n00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:45.860\nAnd I have been stressing about the fact\nthat if you're not finished at the end of\n\n72\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.710\nthe iteration,\nthen we put it into the backlog,\n\n73\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.540\nthen it goes into maybe\na subsequent iteration.\n\n74\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.301\nSo given that pressure, you can imagine\nwhat gets cut first, and it's the testing.\n\n75\n00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:00.990\nThe testing that gets cut.\n\n76\n00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.490\nAnd so what I'm telling you is\nthat if you plan for the testing,\n\n77\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.750\nthen it shouldn't get cut.\n\n78\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.920\nThe reason the testing gets cut is\nbecause people don't plan for it.\n\n79\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.130\nAnd then what happens is, and this is\nwhere we end up, in a situation where, and\n\n80\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.450\nI know and in fact, Justin and\nI have done a look in episode.\n\n81\n00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.900\nYou'll see an episode on our course\nlibrary about the difference between\n\n82\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.150\nproject management and service management.\n\n83\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.480\nAnd we looked at this because there's\n\n84\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.415\na perception of two\ndifferent teams within IT.\n\n85\n00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:37.700\nThere's the perception of\nhaving the development team.\n\n86\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.748\nAnd that's our project management team,\nand our service management team,\n\n87\n00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:44.548\nor the business as usual guys,\nour operations guys,\n\n88\n00:04:44.548 --> 00:04:47.114\nthat look after things\non a day-to-day basis.\n\n89\n00:04:47.114 --> 00:04:49.772\nAnd pick up the pieces\nwhen something goes wrong.\n\n90\n00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:55.430\nIf we don't do adequate testing\nhere in the project side,\n\n91\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.270\nthen we end up giving-\n&gt;&gt; Handing a big pile of fun.\n\n92\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.592\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say that, I needed to\nstop her there before she got any further.\n\n93\n00:05:04.592 --> 00:05:11.941\nBut yeah, I mean, we end up handing over\na complete mess to our operations guys.\n\n94\n00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:14.808\nAnd so the service management guys\nhave gotta pick up the pieces.\n\n95\n00:05:14.808 --> 00:05:15.447\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n96\n00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:19.910\n&gt;&gt; And this is where we end up with\nthat perception of two different teams.\n\n97\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.080\nAnd this is where we end\nup with a contention.\n\n98\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.522\nAnd with all of the argument\nthat goes along with it,\n\n99\n00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:26.631\nwhere the operations guys are saying, hey,\n\n100\n00:05:26.631 --> 00:05:30.317\nyou're just throwing products over\nthe fence and then abandoning us with it.\n\n101\n00:05:30.317 --> 00:05:33.475\nAnd the project team is saying, well,\n\n102\n00:05:33.475 --> 00:05:37.793\nyou need to be doing this,\nyou need to be fixing this.\n\n103\n00:05:37.793 --> 00:05:41.671\nThe fact is that all of this could be\nironed out if we've got successful\n\n104\n00:05:41.671 --> 00:05:42.720\ntesting.\n\n105\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.222\nSo we have to ensure.\n\n106\n00:05:44.222 --> 00:05:49.225\nIt's our responsibility really, to ensure\nthat if you're gonna develop a product,\n\n107\n00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:52.510\nwell, you gotta make sure it works, right?\n\n108\n00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.342\nI mean, it doesn't make sense to\ndevelop a product and not test it.\n\n109\n00:05:56.342 --> 00:05:58.365\nBut you're right,\neverybody is under pressure.\n\n110\n00:05:58.365 --> 00:06:02.350\nAnd so testing is the first\nthing that gets moved.\n\n111\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.820\nAnd as you said, people just don't\nrealize that actually, this is important.\n\n112\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.818\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n113\n00:06:07.818 --> 00:06:11.120\n&gt;&gt; And when you're under pressure you just\nthink to yourself, I'm just gonna develop\n\n114\n00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.890\nthis particular product and I'm just gonna\nget it out, I wanna get it to market.\n\n115\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.084\nHow many times though,\nin a real world experience,\n\n116\n00:06:18.084 --> 00:06:23.022\nignoring sort of in our own organizations,\nhow many times out there in the market\n\n117\n00:06:23.022 --> 00:06:27.380\nplace have manufacturers of software\nproviders released software and\n\n118\n00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.887\nthen a couple of weeks later\nreleased the service patch.\n\n119\n00:06:30.887 --> 00:06:34.938\nBecause the software that they released or\nthe functionality that they released run\n\n120\n00:06:34.938 --> 00:06:38.543\nyour battery down on your cellphone,\nor did something absolutely crazy.\n\n121\n00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:40.632\nBecause it wasn't tested fully.\n\n122\n00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:42.130\n&gt;&gt; And it's not just even in software.\n\n123\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.224\nI mean, you look at some\ncellphone manufacturers and\n\n124\n00:06:45.224 --> 00:06:48.377\nthey even blow up on you because of-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:06:48.377 --> 00:06:51.093\n&gt;&gt; So I mean, it's across the board here.\n\n126\n00:06:51.093 --> 00:06:55.652\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it is, and\ntesting's one of the things,\n\n127\n00:06:55.652 --> 00:06:59.435\nit's gonna deliver\nthe success of a project or\n\n128\n00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:03.220\nit's going to deliver failure as well.\n\n129\n00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.030\nAnd think about customer's perception and\ncustomer satisfaction.\n\n130\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.440\n&gt;&gt; Right, once I've lost my reputation,\nhow difficult is it going to be to regain\n\n131\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.980\nthose customers, and a lot cheaper to\nretain them than to try to regain them.\n\n132\n00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, there are a lot of\nmanufacturers, software manufacturers and\n\n133\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.820\nhardware manufacturers that\nhave lost their credibility.\n\n134\n00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.232\nBecause they didn't test and\nbecause they released too early.\n\n135\n00:07:29.232 --> 00:07:33.608\nAnd I've worked with one\nparticular software house in\n\n136\n00:07:33.608 --> 00:07:37.709\nthe past that's exactly\nwhat it happened to them.\n\n137\n00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:41.035\nAnd the perception of\nthat organization was so\n\n138\n00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:46.100\nbad with their existing clients\nthat they were losing clients.\n\n139\n00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.685\nAnd it was very, very difficult for\nthem to get those clients back again.\n\n140\n00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:53.510\nAnd it was all down to the fact\nthat they were rushing the testing.\n\n141\n00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.044\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n142\n00:07:54.044 --> 00:07:57.760\n&gt;&gt; You rush the testing,\nyou don't plan for it, then unfortunately,\n\n143\n00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.051\nthat's what happens.\n\n144\n00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:02.322\nYou don't deliver quality,\nyou deliver a substandard product.\n\n145\n00:08:02.322 --> 00:08:06.196\nAnd when you deliver a substandard\nproduct you lose your costumer loyalty,\n\n146\n00:08:06.196 --> 00:08:10.070\nyou lose your costumer satisfaction and\nyou're not delivering quality and\n\n147\n00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.010\nthat's what we want to do.\n\n148\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.470\nSo even in an agile way,\n\n149\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.680\neven in an agile methodology in delivering\nproducts, testing is still important.\n\n150\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.490\nAnd if testing takes up 50% of the time\nof your iteration and that's okay,\n\n151\n00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.300\nthere's nothing wrong with that, and when\nwe're talking about planning for testing,\n\n152\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.600\nyou don't just allocate five minutes to\nthe testing, you don't just allocate,\n\n153\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.370\nif you've got four weeks you don't\njust allocate one day to testing.\n\n154\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.370\nTesting must be done on a regular basis.\n\n155\n00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.570\nIf you've got four weeks and you know if\nyou want 50% of that time to be spent\n\n156\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.640\ntesting then that's\nexactly what it should be.\n\n157\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.400\nAnd so I just want to we talked about\nresponsibilities at the very beginning.\n\n158\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.060\nI just want to take a look at our Agile\nTeam and who we've got in our Agile Team.\n\n159\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.440\nAnd you'll see that we've\ngot sort of our developers.\n\n160\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.510\nAnd then we've also got\non this particular slide,\n\n161\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.731\nwe've got our product owner and\nour scrum master.\n\n162\n00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.780\nNow, remember the difference between them,\nthe product owner and the scrum master.\n\n163\n00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.020\nThe product owner is responsible for\nthe product itself, and\n\n164\n00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:22.160\nthe scrum master is responsible for\nmanaging the team.\n\n165\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.940\nSo in terms of the testing then,\nthe product owner\n\n166\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.198\nis going to be the person that's\ngonna sign off on the testing,\n\n167\n00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:34.460\nwhereas the scrum master is the person\nthat's going to be managing the team\n\n168\n00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.260\nto make sure that everybody\nis involved in the testing.\n\n169\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:43.130\nSo the team that's doing the testing,\nthe scrum master is going\n\n170\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:48.020\nto be involved in ensuring\nthat everybody is, you know,\n\n171\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.740\nundertaking their responsibilities and\nthe test didn't happen.\n\n172\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.350\nWhereas the product owner is responsible\nfor the content of the testing.\n\n173\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.400\nSo the product owner will\nassume that responsibility.\n\n174\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.530\nIt's part of their responsibility.\n\n175\n00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.674\nSo if you look at the next page,\n\n176\n00:10:04.674 --> 00:10:10.790\nthe product owner is thinking about what's\nacceptable, what is my acceptance level?\n\n177\n00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.779\nYou know,\nwhat are my customer requirements?\n\n178\n00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.100\nWhat is it exactly that\nI should be delivering?\n\n179\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.350\nAnd so the customers,\nthe product owner is responsible for\n\n180\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.620\nthe user stories, making sure\nthat we meet in the user stories.\n\n181\n00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.430\nAnd the product owner is responsible for\nensuring that, you know, we test and\n\n182\n00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.330\nthere are no errors and\nthat it delivers the requirements, but\n\n183\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.920\nalso that we're doing the behavior\ndriven testing as well.\n\n184\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.870\nYou know the scenario based, the what if.\n\n185\n00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.870\nIf I do it like this\nthen what will happen?\n\n186\n00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.360\nSo the product owner takes\nall of that ownership.\n\n187\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.190\nAnd then some projects depending\non the scale of the project.\n\n188\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.100\nYou may also have a test manager.\n\n189\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.050\nDependent on this scale.\n\n190\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.450\nNow what we've got here,\nis you've got in this particular example,\n\n191\n00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.480\nyou've got a very,\nvery large project team.\n\n192\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.970\nAnd in a large project team,\nwe've got here in our Agile Team there,\n\n193\n00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.580\nyou've got a scrum master who may be\nreporting into a project manager.\n\n194\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.180\nYou've got developers who may\nbe on a normal day-to-day basis.\n\n195\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.950\nReporting into the development manager and\nthen you've got a tester and\n\n196\n00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.990\na test manager.\n\n197\n00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:32.010\nThis is a large scale\norganization here and of course,\n\n198\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.790\nremember we work collaboratively\nin an Agile Team so\n\n199\n00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:41.210\nwhilst these roles may be\ndefined in a large organization.\n\n200\n00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.520\nIt may not necessarily be defined\nwe're working collaboratively and so\n\n201\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.370\nit may be that you take responsibility for\ntesting in one particular piece of\n\n202\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.900\nfunctionality or one particular user\nstory and I'll take responsibility for\n\n203\n00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.790\ntesting something else, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.680\nRemember, we're working collaboratively.\n\n205\n00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.530\nBut testing is the huge\npart of the project.\n\n206\n00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:08.220\nIt's a huge part of our, you know, of our\nproject management, of our methodology.\n\n207\n00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:14.860\nSo this particular slide, I just wanna us\nto look really at planning for our test.\n\n208\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.050\nAnd you'll see that in\nthe right here we plan for\n\n209\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.630\ntest at every single level,\nwhen we initiate a project.\n\n210\n00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.460\nI'm gonna go back to what I was\nsaying just a little while ago.\n\n211\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.926\nWhen we initiate a project,\ndo not exclude the testing.\n\n212\n00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:31.720\nYeah, okay,\nI sound pretty angry about that but\n\n213\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.550\nit goes back to what I was saying.\n\n214\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.598\nListen it's not anger, it's passion.\n\n215\n00:12:35.598 --> 00:12:36.231\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n216\n00:12:36.231 --> 00:12:39.190\n&gt;&gt; It goes back to what we\nwere saying earlier on.\n\n217\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.580\nYou can't neglect it, so\nright at the very beginning,\n\n218\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.110\nacknowledge that you're going to test,\nand then think about\n\n219\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.380\nwhat your testing strategy's gonna be and\nwho's going to do it.\n\n220\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.870\nAnd that's at the beginning of\nthe project, not just at each iteration.\n\n221\n00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.970\nAnd then as you plan each iteration,\n\n222\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:03.530\nthen you wanna understand the acceptance\ncriteria for each user story.\n\n223\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.220\nAnd you want to have a plan for testing.\n\n224\n00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:12.700\nRemember, we develop our tests and\nwe develop so that we can test.\n\n225\n00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.670\nSo this is where we start to plan it.\n\n226\n00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:19.080\nAnd then as we develop\nthe increments themselves.\n\n227\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.240\nWell, that's when we actually,\nwell we prepare.\n\n228\n00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.090\nIt says preparing the test cases, but\nthat's when we actually do the tests .With\n\n229\n00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:31.460\neach iteration, as we're developing,\nwe are testing at the same time.\n\n230\n00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.620\nRemember the golden rule though.\n\n231\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.120\nFail fast?\n\n232\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.120\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, that's not the golden rule, Jo?\n\n233\n00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.080\n&gt;&gt; No, we got one rule, one rule.\n\n234\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:39.740\nThat's one rule.\n\n235\n00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.510\nWhat did I say about the one rule?\n\n236\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.250\n&gt;&gt; One rule.\n\n237\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.405\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\nwe like the fail fast approach, yeah.\n\n238\n00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:48.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I only have one rule,\nand I can't remember the one rule.\n\n239\n00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:50.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One rule.\n\n240\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.835\n&gt;&gt; What's the one rule, Jo?\n\n241\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Dear, dear, you can remember it right?\n\n242\n00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.250\n&gt;&gt; No, what's the one rule?\n\n243\n00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.660\n&gt;&gt; One rule, the person that develops it-\n&gt;&gt; Can't test it.\n\n244\n00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay so she does remember it,\njust needs a little of-\n\n245\n00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.480\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know that was the golden rule,\n\n246\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.590\nbut now I know.\n\n247\n00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.825\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's our one rule.\n\n248\n00:14:06.825 --> 00:14:08.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sure, we wanna fail fast and\n\n249\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.160\nwhat we mean by fail fast.\n\n250\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.110\n&gt;&gt; Is that we wanna fail\nas quickly as possible.\n\n251\n00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.630\nSo if something is gonna go wrong we\nwant it to go wrong as early as possible\n\n252\n00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.420\nin our development or\nas early as possible in our testing.\n\n253\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's where I thought you were going.\n\n254\n00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because then it give\nus an opportunity to fix it.\n\n255\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.280\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n256\n00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.420\n&gt;&gt; Remember we're time constrained and\nif we don't fix it by the end of\n\n257\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.740\nthe iteration then it doesn't\ngo into the iteration.\n\n258\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.770\nSo yeah, sure, we wanna fail fast, but\n\n259\n00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.360\nit's not the person that's\ndeveloping that's doing the testing.\n\n260\n00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.730\nYou don't test your own development,\nyour own coding because\n\n261\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.825\napart from it's just not best practice,\nit just doesn't work, right?\n\n262\n00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:50.350\nBecause we all know how\nour own development works.\n\n263\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.005\nWell, apparently.\n\n264\n00:14:52.005 --> 00:14:53.589\n[LAUGH].\n\n265\n00:14:53.589 --> 00:14:54.940\nHopefully.\n\n266\n00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.940\nBut I mean, you know,\napparently I've got to say\n\n267\n00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.980\nyou'd like to hope so but I've known some\ndevelopers that know that's not the case.\n\n268\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.559\nSo when we're planning each iteration,\nI've already said this,\n\n269\n00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:15.310\nI'm not going to say this anymore,\nreally, just plan for tests.\n\n270\n00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.930\nTake a look at some of the previous\nepisodes, take a look at the tests that we\n\n271\n00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:24.316\ndo, but make sure that we incorporate\nthe tests within that one to four weeks,\n\n272\n00:15:24.316 --> 00:15:29.110\nif your iteration is two weeks\nyou've got to include testing time.\n\n273\n00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.750\nOne thing though that I do want to stress,\nand\n\n274\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.280\nthat's this, Lightweight documentation.\n\n275\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.260\nThere's a general misconception,\nsome sort of myth maybe with\n\n276\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.110\nagile that we don't do any documentation\nat all, and that's not the case.\n\n277\n00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.405\nWe do documentation,\nwe just keep it simple, and\n\n278\n00:15:49.405 --> 00:15:55.052\nwe wanna ensure that the documentation\nthat we have is relevant.\n\n279\n00:15:55.052 --> 00:15:58.379\nNone of this documentation just for\nthe sake of having documentation.\n\n280\n00:15:58.379 --> 00:16:02.891\nYou know we're Another thing that we're\nreally guilty of in IT is producing\n\n281\n00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:06.908\na nice, pretty picture just for\nthe sake of it or producing reams and\n\n282\n00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:10.730\nreams of documentation just because\nwe think we should have it.\n\n283\n00:16:11.956 --> 00:16:14.930\nClick [INAUDIBLE] are non-ambiguous\nwhen it come to documentation,\n\n284\n00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:19.680\nit's really simple,\nnothing that is not going to be read.\n\n285\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.360\nI don't know about you,\n\n286\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.210\nare you one of these people that\nwill skim read through something.\n\n287\n00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:24.930\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n288\n00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:25.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am too.\n\n289\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.850\nIf I have to skim read through something,\nthen it's probably not what I would\n\n290\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.630\nconsider to be an efficient or\nlightweight document.\n\n291\n00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if I'm having to skim read\n\n292\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.640\nthrough something, then that means to me\nthat there's a lot of words in there that\n\n293\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.950\nare kind of superfluous.\n\n294\n00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n295\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.650\n&gt;&gt; We don't need them.\n\n296\n00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.860\nSo take out the padding.\n\n297\n00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.240\nThat's what we're saying here.\n\n298\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.820\nJust keep it short, sharp and\nto the point or clear, concise and\n\n299\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.410\nunambiguous bullet points,\nwe love bullet points.\n\n300\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.520\nSay what you've got to say and\nthen that's it,\n\n301\n00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.670\nit doesn't need to be\na huge entire paragraph.\n\n302\n00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.990\nOnly once in my entire career and\nI'm ancient, I accept that.\n\n303\n00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.800\nOnly once in my entire career\nhas somebody come up to me and\n\n304\n00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.299\nsaid, I don't like bullet points,\nI would rather have paragraphs.\n\n305\n00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.810\nI wanna tell you what\nI said to that person.\n\n306\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.720\nI wasn't too impolite.\n\n307\n00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:22.250\nBut once in all of my career has somebody\nsaid I don't like bullet points.\n\n308\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.010\nKeep the documentation relevant.\n\n309\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.580\nIf somebody's gonna skim read through it,\nthen it's not relevant.\n\n310\n00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.170\nIt's not really saying a lot.\n\n311\n00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.040\nIt's just words, we don't need words.\n\n312\n00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.420\nAlso think about whether you\nneed documentation or not.\n\n313\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.650\nIt mentions there about collaboration and\n\n314\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.005\nusing the daily stand-up,\ndo you need to document it?\n\n315\n00:17:44.005 --> 00:17:48.341\nI mean we have a daily,\nthere's a big miss within IT and\n\n316\n00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:51.371\nit's within the businesses as well.\n\n317\n00:17:51.371 --> 00:17:53.868\nIn that whenever you have a meeting\nyou should always document-\n\n318\n00:17:53.868 --> 00:17:54.933\n&gt;&gt; Take minutes and-\n\n319\n00:17:54.933 --> 00:17:55.955\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n320\n00:17:55.955 --> 00:17:57.585\nNow and I say is a big miss.\n\n321\n00:17:58.695 --> 00:18:05.717\nShould you take a minute or should\nyou just note down the action points?\n\n322\n00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:10.319\n&gt;&gt; I think that it kind of depends on\nthe situation beause I want to jump and\n\n323\n00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:14.843\nsay just the action points but\nif there's some kind of environment or\n\n324\n00:18:14.843 --> 00:18:19.601\nsituation where everyone can't be\npresent or maybe you have some kind of\n\n325\n00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:24.301\nstakeholders that like to know,\njust have an idea of what was going on.\n\n326\n00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:28.247\nI'm not sure if they're not completely\nhands-on but if there's some kind of\n\n327\n00:18:28.247 --> 00:18:32.374\ncompliance, regulatory compliance that\nhas to at least show planning phases and\n\n328\n00:18:32.374 --> 00:18:36.017\nthings like that and you can still look,\nwe bought it up at this meeting,\n\n329\n00:18:36.017 --> 00:18:39.065\non this day, we initiated\nthe planning phase or whatever.\n\n330\n00:18:39.065 --> 00:18:45.000\n&gt;&gt; I just kinda want to\nthe 21st century right now.\n\n331\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.190\nYeah, I know, I mean,\njust think about where we are right now.\n\n332\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.100\nWhere are we?\n\n333\n00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.450\nKind of-\n&gt;&gt; A barn?\n\n334\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:51.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can look around.\n\n335\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.390\nI mean, let's face it, Facebook's\neven got a live feature right now.\n\n336\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.430\nYou can record everything, and\neverybody does record everything,\n\n337\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.940\nI get what you're saying about\nit's certain instinances,\n\n338\n00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.340\nif we were in a court of law then\neverything's got to be documented.\n\n339\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.330\nBut nowadays, does it really need\nto be physically documented?\n\n340\n00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.260\nOr does that documentation\nactually refer to the fact\n\n341\n00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.030\nthat we've recorded the meeting, yeah?\n\n342\n00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.560\nSo that if somebody did miss the meeting,\nthey can go back and\n\n343\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.630\nthey can watch the recording,\nfor instance.\n\n344\n00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.970\nDon't automatically go for the obvious.\n\n345\n00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.500\nTechnology's available to us.\n\n346\n00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.540\nWe've got some wonderful tools now.\n\n347\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.340\nDon't always go for the obvious.\n\n348\n00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.520\nIn a previous episode,\nwe talked about progress of a project.\n\n349\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.200\nOr it may be in another series.\n\n350\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.910\nNow that said to you,\nwhen you look at the canvan board and\n\n351\n00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.350\nwe've got post-it notes or\nsticky notes on a canvan board,\n\n352\n00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.660\nthen we should record every\nsingle day where we are.\n\n353\n00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.740\nTake a picture.\n\n354\n00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n355\n00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n356\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.560\nSo don't think about formal documentation.\n\n357\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.110\nLightweight documentaiton.\n\n358\n00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.530\nWe document sure to\nremember what was said but\n\n359\n00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.830\nyou only want to write\ndown what's necessary.\n\n360\n00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.490\nAnd show if there are people missing and\nrecord it.\n\n361\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.970\nIt doesn't have to be written down.\n\n362\n00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.430\nWhy would you?\n\n363\n00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.940\nIt won't be efficient to have somebody\nspend time writing something down,\n\n364\n00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.080\none of the deal would.\n\n365\n00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.178\nThink about where we are.\n\n366\n00:20:24.178 --> 00:20:27.970\n[LAUGH] I'll be the first\nperson to do that.\n\n367\n00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:32.190\nAnd there's somebody asks me a question\nand I will quite often do that.\n\n368\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.780\nIf I get email, questions from people\nabout implementing project management or\n\n369\n00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.570\nimplementing service management,\nyou will find it quite often,\n\n370\n00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.420\nI will record a video reply to that.\n\n371\n00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.610\nJust purely because it's easier for\nme, it's less time consuming for me,\n\n372\n00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.910\nit's more efficient for me and they've got\nsomething that they can refer back to and\n\n373\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.230\nit's less open to interpretation\nthan something that's written down.\n\n374\n00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.742\nI've made her think now.\n\n375\n00:21:00.742 --> 00:21:04.399\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some of us are in this weird place\n\n376\n00:21:04.399 --> 00:21:06.650\nwhere we've over the years,\n\n377\n00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:10.610\nthe transition from this more\nformal situation or settings.\n\n378\n00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.512\nSo, yeah, for me I would have\nrecord the next action items.\n\n379\n00:21:13.512 --> 00:21:18.060\nJust so that we can, at least,\nhave one person in charge and say look,\n\n380\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.010\nmaybe you are the person that\nputs even on the calendar and so\n\n381\n00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:24.270\nnow you gotta just make sure everyone\ngets that notification or something.\n\n382\n00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:28.810\n&gt;&gt; Over the last 30 years We've\ncome full circle in IT and\n\n383\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:34.720\nyears and years and years ago, we started\noff with very, very little documentation.\n\n384\n00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.440\nAnd we do things, we'd have these people,\nthat we know absolutely everything,\n\n385\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.420\nbrings the size of a planet and\nthey knew exactly what they were doing.\n\n386\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.900\nBut they couldn't explain it to us.\n\n387\n00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.380\nAnd you trying to get\nthem to explain to us and\n\n388\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.010\nyou trying get them to document\nanything and they wouldn't.\n\n389\n00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.100\nAnd then we kind of gone circles through\nthe, we have moved through the, or\n\n390\n00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.570\nwe've gotta have a huge\namount of documentation.\n\n391\n00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.890\nAnd now we are coming out the other end\nand say okay, does it actually need to be\n\n392\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:07.920\nin a physical, handwritten document or\ntyped or can it be a video?\n\n393\n00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.530\nSo think about all the mediums\nthat are available to us.\n\n394\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.640\n&gt;&gt; Screenshot.\n\n395\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.470\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n396\n00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, things like that.\n\n397\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.730\n&gt;&gt; And we used to, years ago, we used to\nembed screen shots into Word documents.\n\n398\n00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.010\nBut why do they need to be\nembedded into Word documents?\n\n399\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:26.450\nNowadays what we do is, we'd actually\nrecord something on our laptop and\n\n400\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:31.480\nwe'd actually record moving through\nscreenshots rather than having\n\n401\n00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.310\na formal document with various screenshots\nthat says do this and then do that.\n\n402\n00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.150\nNow we record it.\n\n403\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.190\nSo write down only what's necessary.\n\n404\n00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.380\nAnd even then, ask yourself the question,\nis it necessary or\n\n405\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.450\nshould we just record it?\n\n406\n00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.098\nOne thing that we do have to do,\n\n407\n00:22:49.098 --> 00:22:52.505\nis we have to find a find\na way to track our defects.\n\n408\n00:22:52.505 --> 00:22:57.985\nSo this allows not just me to write\ndown the defects that I found but\n\n409\n00:22:57.985 --> 00:23:02.515\nit allows also you to then see\nwhat defects I found as well.\n\n410\n00:23:02.515 --> 00:23:07.735\nAnd so it allows everybody within\nthe team to take a look at the defect and\n\n411\n00:23:07.735 --> 00:23:12.985\nthen to collaborate on deciding\nwhat we're do with that defect.\n\n412\n00:23:12.985 --> 00:23:15.930\nSo, think about what you gonna do with it.\n\n413\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.350\nAnd again I always say this,\nwhen you're writing anything down.\n\n414\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.520\nIf you're recording anything,\n\n415\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.250\nwhat is your intention, what do you wanna\nget out to that, what is the purpose?\n\n416\n00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.720\nI am I writing down just because it needs\nto be recorded or I am I writing it down,\n\n417\n00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.345\nso that somebody else can pick that up and\ndo something with it.\n\n418\n00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:36.850\nIt mentions here an issue or\ndefect tracking system.\n\n419\n00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.380\nWhatever the defect is,\n\n420\n00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.890\nyou have to make a decision is to\nwhat you're going to do about it.\n\n421\n00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.700\nSo you have to decide as to\nwhether that's gonna be fix or\n\n422\n00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.694\nwhether that's gonna become a feature.\n\n423\n00:23:47.694 --> 00:23:51.188\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That particular piece of software.\n\n424\n00:23:51.188 --> 00:23:55.392\nWhen we all know that there are some\npieces of software, some service packages.\n\n425\n00:23:55.392 --> 00:23:58.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] that are released with these\n\n426\n00:23:58.021 --> 00:24:00.286\nfeatures [LAUGH] as we like to call it.\n\n427\n00:24:00.286 --> 00:24:03.429\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nthink about what you're going to do.\n\n428\n00:24:03.429 --> 00:24:06.480\nUltimately though,\na decision has to be made.\n\n429\n00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.604\nNow, the responsibility of\nthat is on the product owner.\n\n430\n00:24:09.604 --> 00:24:12.970\nBut a decision has to be made\nas to what's going to happen.\n\n431\n00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:18.270\nWith each situation, you've got a very,\nvery limited window to make that decision.\n\n432\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:22.620\nSo it's really important that we keep\ntrack of these defects, and yes,\n\n433\n00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.450\nI'm telling you now to write\nsomething down to get it logged.\n\n434\n00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.550\nAnd that's purely because\nit's efficient to do that.\n\n435\n00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:34.100\nIt's not efficient for me to find a defect\nand then for you to find a defect.\n\n436\n00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.274\nIt's more efficient for\nme to find a defect and\n\n437\n00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:39.923\nthen you can already see that there's\nbeen a defect because I've logged it.\n\n438\n00:24:39.923 --> 00:24:42.800\nSo we're always thinking\nabout efficiency here.\n\n439\n00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.810\nAnd then we should always\nreport on our results.\n\n440\n00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.720\nA couple of words though that are really\nimportant and that is as needed.\n\n441\n00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.570\nAgain, think about\nthe style of the reporting,\n\n442\n00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.380\nthink about who your audience is.\n\n443\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.910\nWhat do they need to see?\n\n444\n00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.050\nAnd how do they need to see it?\n\n445\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.860\nDoes it need to be a formal report?\n\n446\n00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.320\nOr could it be something that's in a daily\nstandup, just feedback from a daily\n\n447\n00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.510\nstandup or what we call the information\nradiators or Kanban board for instance?\n\n448\n00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:19.660\nIs it just the case of moving a post-it\nnote from one position to another?\n\n449\n00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.670\nOr does it have to be a formal report?\n\n450\n00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.480\nIt really depends on who is going to,\n\n451\n00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.630\nwhich is why I say think of the audience\nbecause the language that you use and\n\n452\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:35.290\nthe amount or the depth of the report is\nreally dependent on who your audience is.\n\n453\n00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.490\nBut remember you're remaining efficient\n\n454\n00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.740\nto think about the medium\nthat you're going to use.\n\n455\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.180\nAnd it's the same with the metrics\nfrom our testing as well,\n\n456\n00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.440\nthink about what you're recording and\n\n457\n00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.830\nat what point in time do you acknowledge\nthat actually something has been done.\n\n458\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.262\nWhat I want to see is my defect backlog,\nwell,\n\n459\n00:25:58.262 --> 00:26:01.961\nI want to see it down to zero,\nthat's my backlog.\n\n460\n00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:06.562\nBut I want to see the progress of my test,\nand what that's doing there on\n\n461\n00:26:06.562 --> 00:26:10.477\nthe bottom sorta graph there\nis the programs should really,\n\n462\n00:26:10.477 --> 00:26:16.370\nwhat's left to do should be diminishing\nas we move through each iteration.\n\n463\n00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:21.090\nUltimately what I want to see\nis I want to see progression.\n\n464\n00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.513\nI want to see that testing is progressing,\n\n465\n00:26:24.513 --> 00:26:28.412\nI want to see the number\nof defects decreasing and\n\n466\n00:26:28.412 --> 00:26:33.450\nI want to see that we get to\na position where we make a decision for\n\n467\n00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:39.750\neach iteration based on whether the\nfunctionality has passed the test or not.\n\n468\n00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.440\nIt's as simple as that.\n\n469\n00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.040\nWe do not decide to release if\nwe haven't done any testing or\n\n470\n00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.370\nif we haven't passed the testing.\n\n471\n00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.300\n&gt;&gt; That's a big point.\n\n472\n00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.260\nIt's like, hey, I did all my testing, but\n\n473\n00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:56.520\nthen if it fails,\nI can check it off my box.\n\n474\n00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.950\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah.\n\n475\n00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:01.170\nAnd that's the other thing is just cuz\nyou've done the test doesn't mean you're\n\n476\n00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.220\nsuccessful at doing the test.\n\n477\n00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.840\n[LAUGH] You've got to make sure\nyou do the test and that it works.\n\n478\n00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.390\nThat's when you decide to release.\n\n479\n00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:16.320\nAnd don't forget that at every iteration,\n\n480\n00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.870\nwell, it's a change to how\nthings were previously.\n\n481\n00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:27.000\nAnd so even with our testing, well-\n&gt;&gt; We're testing iteratively?\n\n482\n00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.030\n&gt;&gt; We're testing iteratively, yes.\n\n483\n00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.640\nBut even with our testing we\ncan improve on our testing.\n\n484\n00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.360\nSo maybe with one iteration\nwe may test manually and\n\n485\n00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.920\nthen with the next iteration,\nwe test automatically for instance.\n\n486\n00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.270\nYes, so we always want to ensure\nthat we work in efficiently.\n\n487\n00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:48.399\nUntil we always wanna make\nsure that our testing improve.\n\n488\n00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:53.071\nSo if I now automate my test and while\nI've done it manually this first time,\n\n489\n00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:57.524\nmy next situation I'm gonna automate and\nthen I can use that test to apply\n\n490\n00:27:57.524 --> 00:28:01.977\nthat to other iterations both in the\nfuture and maybe if I wanna go back and\n\n491\n00:28:01.977 --> 00:28:06.504\ntest any previous functionality\nbecause maybe something didn't work,\n\n492\n00:28:06.504 --> 00:28:08.640\nthen I can use that, as well.\n\n493\n00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.140\nWe learn.\n\n494\n00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:15.370\nAnd that's really what I'm gonna say about\ntesting and testing with each situation.\n\n495\n00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.530\nIs with each situation, we learn.\n\n496\n00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.570\nWe should be learning\nfrom previous situations,\n\n497\n00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:27.160\nwe should be learning from what\nwe did in the past, always.\n\n498\n00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:33.930\nSo testing is a huge part\nof the project itself.\n\n499\n00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.470\nBut testing should also be\ndone before we make a decision\n\n500\n00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:43.620\nas to whether we're going release\nin that particular iteration.\n\n501\n00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.810\nAnd so in our next episode, we're\nactually going to look then the delivery\n\n502\n00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.560\nof that particular release so\nthat iteration.\n\n503\n00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.910\n&gt;&gt; Did you say deliviries, Jo?\n\n504\n00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:55.800\nYou know I love deliveries, my favorite\nstore after all is the Internet.\n\n505\n00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.470\nSo I'm really looking\nforward to this next show.\n\n506\n00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.680\nHopefully, you guys we'll join us\nthere but for now, let's sign out.\n\n507\n00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.310\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n508\n00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.285\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n509\n00:29:04.285 --> 00:29:08.954\n&gt;&gt; Have a great

Series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.150\nI'm your host, Cheroke Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.370\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at iteration deliveries, and\n\n8\n00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.230\nof course, with us back in studios today,\nwe have Mrs. Joe Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.610\nHow's it going, Joe?\n\n10\n00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.520\nAbsolutely great, thank you Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.160\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing lovely,\n\n13\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.860\nI have a feeling we're not going to be\ntalking about deliveries and coupons and\n\n14\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.960\ndiscount websites, we're going to be\nlooking at our iteration deliveries.\n\n15\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.690\nIs that correct?\n\n16\n00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.625\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're not waiting for\nthe postman today.\n\n17\n00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, we're actually talking about,\n\n18\n00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.770\nas you say, the delivery.\n\n19\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440\nNo!\nI can't say it now!\n\n20\n00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.147\nThe delivery iterations.\n\n21\n00:00:50.147 --> 00:00:51.170\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n22\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.040\nYeah.\nNone of those nights were, or mornings,\n\n23\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.360\nI should say, you wake up,\nand there's a package.\n\n24\n00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.280\nAnd someone's like, what did you order?\n\n25\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.300\nAnd it was like, I don't remember.\n\n26\n00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.272\nHas that ever happened to you?\n\n27\n00:01:02.272 --> 00:01:04.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think that's\ncalled drunken ordering.\n\n28\n00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:07.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I swear that there's probably\n\n29\n00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.630\na setting on the rooter or\nrouter that you can put on nowadays that,\n\n30\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.700\nif more than one glass of wine,\ndisable router.\n\n31\n00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.220\nMaybe, I don't know.\n\n32\n00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.685\n[LAUGH] But my boss man never\ncomes in at that time of morning,\n\n33\n00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:22.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm lucky if he arise before 5 PM,\n\n35\n00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.990\nanyhow\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n36\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.320\n&gt;&gt; But let's take a look at delivery of\n\n37\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.030\nour iterations, so we're in project\nmanagement, we're in Agile.\n\n38\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.980\nAnd of course in Agile,\nthen we develop in iterations or\n\n39\n00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.860\nsprints if you using Scrome,\nit's exactly the same thing.\n\n40\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.922\nAnd so what we're gonna be talking about\nhere really is what we do when we deliver.\n\n41\n00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:50.320\nIn previous episodes, we've looked\nat our quadrants of testing and\n\n42\n00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.820\nwe've looked at the types\nof testing that we do.\n\n43\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.110\nAnd we've also looked at the person, the\nroles that actually performed the testing,\n\n44\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.540\nand we've looked at planning for\nour tests as well.\n\n45\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.900\nAnd now, what we're going to do is we're\nactually going to deliver the product.\n\n46\n00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.420\nEvery iteration, whether it's actually\nbeen released as an iteration or\n\n47\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.970\nwhether it is being held\nuntil we've got two or\n\n48\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.400\nthree iterations before we release them,\nevery single iteration should really\n\n49\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.190\nrelease a portion of the product that\nis what we call production quality.\n\n50\n00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.040\nIn other words,\n\n51\n00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.440\nevery single iteration should\nrelease what we call a done product.\n\n52\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.390\nNow, if you go back to your Agile,\nso fundamentals, you will remember\n\n53\n00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.460\nthat we have to define what done looks\nlike, well we define that in the story,\n\n54\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.070\nthen we define what the definition\nof done is, what a done it is.\n\n55\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.730\nIn other words,\nwhat the acceptance criteria,\n\n56\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.890\nwhat do we have to satisfy to\nfind this project as complete?\n\n57\n00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.520\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or iteration, not the project,\n\n58\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.700\nyeah the iteration, yeah.\n\n59\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.030\n&gt;&gt; I have to be very careful\nwith my words sometimes.\n\n60\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.411\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean if it\ndefined the project as complete,\n\n61\n00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:05.490\nwe'd all be happy right?\n\n62\n00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.270\nYeah.\n\n63\n00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.530\n&gt;&gt; Very small projects.\n\n64\n00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.152\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n65\n00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:12.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's what defines\nthat iteration as complete and\n\n66\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.010\nso here at the end of the iteration\nthen we've to check that off.\n\n67\n00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.090\nAnd again that's another form of testing.\n\n68\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.690\nIt really is not just a case of\ndoing all the functionality testing.\n\n69\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.040\nBut it's that user acceptance testing.\n\n70\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.970\nWhere we look at,\nwell is it actually done?\n\n71\n00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.190\nNow remember that we are delivering.\n\n72\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.190\nWe are delivering our iterations\nin a continuous delivery way.\n\n73\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.180\nSo we're delivering as much as we\nare developing a user story, and\n\n74\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.010\nthen we're integrating that\nuser story into a release.\n\n75\n00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.630\nNow we might have more than one\nuser story in that release.\n\n76\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.840\nSomething that I want you to just pay\nattention to in this particular slide,\n\n77\n00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.040\nbecause it's a very, very busy slide.\n\n78\n00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.070\nBut in our integration environment,\nwe have got a project baseline and\n\n79\n00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.030\nthen we have a new baseline at the end.\n\n80\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.090\nA baseline is just a snapshot\nof where we're right now.\n\n81\n00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.610\nA baseline line is just really\nour current starting point.\n\n82\n00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.360\nAnd at the end of any iteration,\n\n83\n00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.350\nat the end of any change it just makes\nperfect sense but it's also best practice.\n\n84\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.610\nAt the end of any change\nwe take another baseline.\n\n85\n00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.660\nIt's another snapshot of\nwhere we are right now.\n\n86\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.260\nAnd we can then assess whether\nan improvement has been made.\n\n87\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.060\nThis is not about assessing\nwhether we've actually set out to\n\n88\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.560\nachieve what we were supposed to achieve,\n\n89\n00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.130\nthis is a case of assessing whether\nan improvement has been made.\n\n90\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.400\nHave we changed from\nthe previous faceline?\n\n91\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.630\nSo let's just say, and\nI can't walk around the studio right now.\n\n92\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.270\nBut let's just say,\nthat I started off here and\n\n93\n00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.870\nwhat I wanted to deliver\nwas going to take me there.\n\n94\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.950\nSo what I do is I'll take your baseline,\nSnapchat of where I am right now and then\n\n95\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.750\nat the end of that iteration I'll take\nanother Snapchat and I should be here.\n\n96\n00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.290\nI should have achieved this.\n\n97\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.360\nThis is not about the functionality.\n\n98\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.660\nBut if we don't achieve the functionality\nthat we set out to achieve then we won't\n\n99\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.330\nactually get to that point which means\nthat our baseline will still be back here.\n\n100\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.520\nDoes that makes sense?\n\n101\n00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n102\n00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.380\nYou're baseline for the walking,\nI was just thinking working out at\n\n104\n00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.150\nthe gym the other day the instructor said,\nwhat's your baseline for the mile?\n\n105\n00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.950\nAnd I'm like, I don't know?\n\n106\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.825\nI can finish it.\n\n107\n00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:38.380\n[LAUGH] No, no.\n\n108\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.380\nWe need a clear, and that's important\nin IT as well, a clear, accurate,\n\n109\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.000\nas is picture so\nthat you can measure any kind of progress.\n\n110\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.720\nIf you don't take a baseline,\n\n111\n00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.610\nthen the first measurement that\nyou take is your baseline, okay?\n\n112\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.500\nSo let's say that we are going on\na journey and we are I don't know,\n\n113\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.220\nmaybe we're going it looks sunny out\nthere, let's say we are going out there.\n\n114\n00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.115\n&gt;&gt; It's beautiful out there, yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:58.115 --> 00:06:01.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we just started walking right now\n\n116\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.730\nand then I say to you how far off we go?\n\n117\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.420\nThere's be a lot of looking backwards and\n\n118\n00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.010\nyou'd be I wanna know about this far maybe\nbut we don't have an accurate point.\n\n119\n00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.100\nSo our first measurement then\nbecomes our baseline and\n\n120\n00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.970\nwe can only truly measure from\nthat point onwards, right.\n\n121\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.230\nWhich is why before we implement anything,\nbefore we\n\n122\n00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.500\neven develop any particular code,\nwe've got to have a baseline.\n\n123\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.920\nThat snap shot of what\nthings are like right now.\n\n124\n00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.500\nSo the snap shot of\nwhere we are right now.\n\n125\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.170\nAnd you know, service management is\ngonna help us with that because service\n\n126\n00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.560\nmanagement on a regular basis should be\ntaking baselines of the current situation.\n\n127\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.340\nTaking baselines of what's on\nour infrastructure right now.\n\n128\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.280\nNow, that's not going to help\nhalfway through the project but\n\n129\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.350\nthat is going to help with\nthe beginning of a project.\n\n130\n00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.470\nIn beginning of that project,\nwe take a baseline and\n\n131\n00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.290\nthen as we develop each iteration, we take\nanother baseline until we get to a point\n\n132\n00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.612\nwhere we have developed for iterations and\nmaybe we decided to release.\n\n133\n00:07:05.612 --> 00:07:12.620\nAt that point in time that release goes\nout to the live environment and the point\n\n134\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.430\nin time then the night operations guys a\nservice management guys going to help us.\n\n135\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.540\nAnd I can I take another\nbaseline because they\n\n136\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.484\nare concerned with the impact to the live\nenvironment and they want to make sure\n\n137\n00:07:24.484 --> 00:07:28.560\nthat whatever we do is gonna have\na positive impact to the live environment.\n\n138\n00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.020\nSo, that pointing time then,\nwell they're gonna help us with that.\n\n139\n00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.390\nI'm gonna take a base line and\nthen again as we perform\n\n140\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.290\niteration we're gonna have a project base\nline and then as we do another release\n\n141\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.010\nthen there is another base line\nabout infrastructure to take it.\n\n142\n00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.310\nWhat we wanna do is we always\nwant to be assured that we're\n\n143\n00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.720\nimproving the current situation.\n\n144\n00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.985\nBut then we're also making\nprogress in our project as well.\n\n145\n00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:57.576\nSo we want to have measurements.\n\n146\n00:07:57.576 --> 00:08:02.360\nIn previous episodes, I've looked at the\nfact that we want minimal documentation.\n\n147\n00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.726\nWhat we called light weight documentation.\n\n148\n00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:09.970\nAnd we want to ensure that any\nreports that we take are relevant.\n\n149\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.360\nBut at the same time,\n\n150\n00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.396\nwe've still got to be able to measure\nwhether we're making progress or not.\n\n151\n00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:22.493\n&gt;&gt; Well, you also mentioned previously,\nI think it was the agile fundamental show,\n\n152\n00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:27.457\nbut that our iterations tend to get\nshorter in time because we become\n\n153\n00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:31.400\nmore efficient over\nthe duration of a project.\n\n154\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.763\nSo thinking about what you said there and\n\n155\n00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:37.657\njust thinking about taking these\nbaselines, it's almost as if we\n\n156\n00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:42.189\ncould use this information intelligently\nto forecast for future planning.\n\n157\n00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:46.808\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, most definitely,\nwe should be able to forecast accurately\n\n158\n00:08:46.808 --> 00:08:51.340\nexactly what we're going to achieve\nwithin a certain period of time.\n\n159\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.780\nBearing in mind though sometimes\nwhen we're planning our projects and\n\n160\n00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.650\nwhen planning iterations,\nwe don't really quite know how long it's\n\n161\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.720\ngonna take to do something\nuntil we start to do it.\n\n162\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.700\nAnd it's the same when we look at sort of\nproblem management and defect management.\n\n163\n00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.520\nIf you're trying to fix\nsomething that's gone wrong,\n\n164\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.790\ninvariably you don't know how long it's\ngonna take you to fix until you've\n\n165\n00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.350\nactually found out what the problem is.\n\n166\n00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.024\nAnd once you've found out what the problem\nis you can generally fix it like that.\n\n167\n00:09:16.024 --> 00:09:20.476\nAnd that's always a concern of mine when\nsomebody says to me how long is it going\n\n168\n00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:21.320\nto take?\n\n169\n00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.280\nWell, if I knew that then\nwe wouldn't have a problem.\n\n170\n00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:29.490\n[LAUGH] So it's a really difficult\nanswer to give a user, I know.\n\n171\n00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:34.560\nAnd users don't understand when we come\nup with that, when we respond with that.\n\n172\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.055\nBut ultimately, if I knew what the problem\nwas, if I knew what the defect was,\n\n173\n00:09:40.055 --> 00:09:44.136\nthen it wouldn't be there because\nI would have fixed it and\n\n174\n00:09:44.136 --> 00:09:47.155\ntherefore I don't know, simple as that.\n\n175\n00:09:47.155 --> 00:09:52.141\nSo, up until now, I've talked about best\npractice and I've talked about the fact\n\n176\n00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:57.330\nthat we should always test before we put\nit into the live environment, right?\n\n177\n00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.420\nYeah, it makes sense!\n\n178\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.318\nIt doesn't always work like that though,\ndoes it?\n\n179\n00:10:01.318 --> 00:10:02.754\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n180\n00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:05.442\n&gt;&gt; And so what we should have, and we have\n\n181\n00:10:05.442 --> 00:10:10.902\nto accept that this is going to happen\nis on sort of post development testing.\n\n182\n00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:16.340\nUp until now, and on previous episodes\nwe've looked at planning for our testing.\n\n183\n00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.800\nWe've looked at developing so\nthat it can be tested.\n\n184\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.830\nBut we've also got to test after\nwe've completed the development.\n\n185\n00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.600\nBecause as we've seen in previous\nepisodes, sometimes we have to wait for\n\n186\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.490\none or two iterations,\nand we've had to wait for\n\n187\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.710\nmaybe an epic story to be finished\nbefore we can actually fully test.\n\n188\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.562\nSo that would be our\npost development test,\n\n189\n00:10:38.562 --> 00:10:43.110\nincluding our sort of our user\nacceptance testing as well.\n\n190\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.240\nSo yes, we should still be testing\nas part of each iteration.\n\n191\n00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.448\nBut we should also ensure that we test at\nthe very end before we release as well So\n\n192\n00:10:52.448 --> 00:10:57.078\nas we wrap up each iteration,\nwe test the functionality.\n\n193\n00:10:57.078 --> 00:11:04.160\nThe product owner takes responsibility for\nthat and we perform that retrospective.\n\n194\n00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.880\nNow if you don't know anything about\nthe retrospective, take a look at our job\n\n195\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.830\nfundamentals series and you'll see that\nwe covered retrospectives in there,\n\n196\n00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.700\nwhich is where we simply\nlooked back at the iteration.\n\n197\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.850\nAnd exactly what Cherokee said,\nwe want to then use that information\n\n198\n00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.540\nto then help us with our next iteration.\n\n199\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.470\nSo in other words allowing us\nto become more efficient and\n\n200\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.880\nactually more effective as well.\n\n201\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:35.040\nNow at this point in time it tells us that\nthe user acceptance text is optional.\n\n202\n00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.675\nNow of course we've got\ncustomer acceptance testing and\n\n203\n00:11:38.675 --> 00:11:40.354\nwe've got user acceptance testing.\n\n204\n00:11:40.354 --> 00:11:44.199\nAnd our customers are, well,\nthey're the people that are paying, so\n\n205\n00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:47.330\nthey wanna make sure that we\ndeliver the functionality.\n\n206\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.230\nThat it does send and receive email.\n\n207\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.820\nWhere the user acceptance testing\nis interested in how it sends and\n\n208\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.760\nreceives email.\n\n209\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.240\nIt's listed this is optional here, and\n\n210\n00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.840\nthis is not because we don't\never wanna go back to the user.\n\n211\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.710\nAll right, we do.\n\n212\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:06.618\nBut it goes to the saying, this sort of,\nI guess brings in that same\n\n213\n00:12:06.618 --> 00:12:12.070\ndiscussion when we had the discussion\nabout how often we should release.\n\n214\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.280\nIf we release every single week,\nwe get use this the fed up, right?\n\n215\n00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.122\nAnd if we release though only say once\nevery six months and it's a huge big\n\n216\n00:12:23.122 --> 00:12:28.270\nrelease, then they get fed up because\nthey've had all of that destruction.\n\n217\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.470\nIs exactly the same with the testing.\n\n218\n00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:36.020\nIf we test at the end of every iteration,\nthen we're constantly sort of,\n\n219\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.990\nhey, can you test this, can you test\nthis for me, can you test that for me.\n\n220\n00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.150\nThey're gonna get fed up with that.\n\n221\n00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.680\nBut then if we say to them, okay, well,\nin six months time, which by the way,\n\n222\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.380\nsix months is not an option\nin an agile project.\n\n223\n00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.550\nBut if we said to them, in six month's\ntime, I'd like you to set aside\n\n224\n00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.270\na whole week to do some testing for us,\nthat's not gonna be an option either.\n\n225\n00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.530\nThey not gonna be happy with that, that's\ngonna cost them too much disruption.\n\n226\n00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.875\nSo we're not saying that you should use\na test at the end of every iteration.\n\n227\n00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.550\nBut I'm also not gonna say that you\nshould use a test after five releases.\n\n228\n00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:19.974\nUltimately, you should be using\na testing at least every release.\n\n229\n00:13:19.974 --> 00:13:25.600\nThe release should be tested by the users\nbefore it goes into the live environment.\n\n230\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.720\nSo maybe not at the end\nof every iteration, but\n\n231\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.220\nyou should definitely be user\nto testing before each release.\n\n232\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.770\nMake sense?\n\n233\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.000\nWell, I hope it does anyway, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.520\nSo we have to make a decision\nwith every single iteration,\n\n235\n00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.150\nwe have to make that decision as\nto when we're going to release.\n\n236\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.300\nAnd that's based on those two\ncriteria in front of you.\n\n237\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.484\nIt's the functionality.\n\n238\n00:13:51.484 --> 00:13:52.940\nIt says okay.\n\n239\n00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.923\nBut does it do what it's suppose to do,\nright?\n\n240\n00:13:55.923 --> 00:13:56.780\nAs simple as that.\n\n241\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.044\nBut it doesn't do it in\na way that our customers and\n\n242\n00:14:00.044 --> 00:14:02.470\nour users are gonna be happy with it.\n\n243\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.471\nIn other words it is the quality good.\n\n244\n00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:09.860\nWe also have to test, this is important.\n\n245\n00:14:10.882 --> 00:14:13.170\nAnd it's something that we\nhaven't covered right now.\n\n246\n00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:18.209\nBut we also, up to until now,\nwe also have to test the releases itself.\n\n247\n00:14:18.209 --> 00:14:22.510\n[LAUGH] That's how release mechanism work.\n\n248\n00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.250\nI wonder how many times\nprojects have failed and\n\n249\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.965\nI know some that have failed\nbecause we've gone to do release.\n\n250\n00:14:29.965 --> 00:14:33.270\nWe kinda hit the button to\nsay yes release it now and\n\n251\n00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:37.510\nthen nothing has happened, because we\ndidn't bother testing the release.\n\n252\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:43.568\nOr maybe the release has gone out and\nit fails, and we need to revert back.\n\n253\n00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:47.090\nWell, we need to invoke our\ncontingency measures or\n\n254\n00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.500\nremedial action as you\nmight want to call it.\n\n255\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.430\nAnd remedial action is not\nnecessarily reversion.\n\n256\n00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.330\nIt doesn't necessarily mean,\nhey look, let's back it out.\n\n257\n00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.680\nIt could be something like do it again or\ndo nothing.\n\n258\n00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.744\nLet's face it, if you're releasing an\nupdate in your virus protection software,\n\n259\n00:15:04.744 --> 00:15:07.850\nyou're certainly not gonna back\nthat out if the release fails.\n\n260\n00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.450\nSo you might think about\ndoing something else.\n\n261\n00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.900\nSo when it talks about\nrelease back out testing,\n\n262\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.910\nit's testing the remediation plan.\n\n263\n00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.710\nSo testing what you're\ngoing to do if it fails.\n\n264\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.360\nThey have to be tested, too.\n\n265\n00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.310\nIt's not just about test and release, it's\nnot just about testing the functionality.\n\n266\n00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:31.360\nIt's about testing whether you can\nactually release and whether it works.\n\n267\n00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.930\nAnd then you also need to be able to,\nit says activity verification and\n\n268\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.780\nyou need to check that it\nis actually being released.\n\n269\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.270\nSo while you're doing the release, you\nneed to check that it is definitely going\n\n270\n00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.290\nout that is progressing in the way\nit's supposed to be progressing.\n\n271\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.323\nI like the look on\nCherokee's face right now.\n\n272\n00:15:51.323 --> 00:15:54.155\nShe is deep in thought, and\n\n273\n00:15:54.155 --> 00:15:58.846\nthat's a good thing [LAUGH] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well she kind of looked deep\n\n274\n00:15:58.846 --> 00:15:59.500\nin thought.\n\n275\n00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.550\n&gt;&gt; Well no, I'm just wondering what\ndoes my deep in thought face look like?\n\n276\n00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.450\nBut it's okay, all right.\n\n277\n00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.420\n&gt;&gt; No, it was-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was a deep in thought face.\n\n279\n00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.180\nI was impressed.\n\n280\n00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.510\nAnd now you said that, and\nnow I'm not impressed anymore.\n\n281\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.300\nBut I was.\n\n282\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.671\nI was really impressed.\n&gt;&gt; I did my pondering look.\n\n283\n00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:18.928\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go, see, that works.\n\n284\n00:16:18.928 --> 00:16:22.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've already mentioned\n\n285\n00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.360\nthat user acceptance testing, and\n\n286\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.200\nI've already said that this is optional\nas well, but it has to be done.\n\n287\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.610\nI'm not gonna say anything more to that.\n\n288\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.420\nIt has to be done prior\nto the release date, and\n\n289\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.760\nwhat we're testing is what we've\ngot available in each iteration.\n\n290\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.537\nWe do not, we do not test what's\ncurrently in development,\n\n291\n00:16:41.537 --> 00:16:44.639\nyou test what's ready to be released.\n\n292\n00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:49.050\nNot what Cherokee's working on right now,\nthat doesn't go out to the users.\n\n293\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:50.780\nWhy not?\n\n294\n00:16:52.795 --> 00:16:58.135\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe should be testing during the iteration.\n\n295\n00:16:58.135 --> 00:17:02.295\n&gt;&gt; Right, but why wouldn't the users\nwanna get involved in that though,\n\n296\n00:17:02.295 --> 00:17:04.455\nor why wouldn't we?\n\n297\n00:17:04.455 --> 00:17:05.075\nLet's be more accurate about that.\n\n298\n00:17:05.075 --> 00:17:05.682\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n299\n00:17:05.682 --> 00:17:09.255\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You want\nthe users involved in that?\n\n300\n00:17:10.276 --> 00:17:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Just stay on target, Jo,\n\n301\n00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:21.055\njust because there's gonna be\na lot of chatter I guess and\n\n302\n00:17:21.055 --> 00:17:25.325\nmaybe to distract us from our focus.\n\n303\n00:17:25.325 --> 00:17:30.340\nBut I feel like we should still\nprovide a venue for them to\n\n304\n00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:37.460\naddress any concerns that they may have,\nbut then those concerns get prioritized.\n\n305\n00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.090\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's what this is for,\nthe user acceptance test is for\n\n306\n00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.570\nthem to address any\nconcerns that they have.\n\n307\n00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.920\nWe don't want them involved in\nthe development testing for\n\n308\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.490\na couple of reasons.\n\n309\n00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.660\nOne is that, yes,\nit's a distraction for us.\n\n310\n00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.930\nAnd bear in mind that we've got a really,\nreally short time frame to develop.\n\n311\n00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:00.660\nBut the other is because you might\nbe mismanaging their expectations.\n\n312\n00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:06.630\nEspecially if you are testing some new\nfunctionality, and you've sort of gone to\n\n313\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.000\nthem and said hey look, I really want you\nto test this functionality for me please.\n\n314\n00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.580\nI'm in the middle of developing it.\n\n315\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.180\nAnd they get onto it and\ngo wow, this looks great.\n\n316\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.200\nYes, can't wait for this.\n\n317\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.180\nAnd they're testing it, and there's some\nerrors with it, there's some problems.\n\n318\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.195\nAnd they say well, it's got these\nissues but when these are ironed out,\n\n319\n00:18:22.195 --> 00:18:23.242\nit's gonna work great.\n\n320\n00:18:23.242 --> 00:18:25.780\nAnd then all of a sudden in\nthe next release it doesn't appear.\n\n321\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.730\nAnd it doesn't appear because what's\nhappened, is as a result of their testing,\n\n322\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.562\nwe've realized that we've gotta go\nright back to the drawing board,\n\n323\n00:18:34.562 --> 00:18:36.330\nwe've gotta start from square one.\n\n324\n00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.829\nAnd it's not gonna be available for\nanother two releases.\n\n325\n00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.140\nWe've mismanaged their expectations.\n\n326\n00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:47.494\nSo that's one, the main reason\nreally why we don't do that and,\n\n327\n00:18:47.494 --> 00:18:50.782\nyes the disruption to us\nis really important, but\n\n328\n00:18:50.782 --> 00:18:54.795\nthe fact is we don't want to\nmismanage their expectations.\n\n329\n00:18:54.795 --> 00:18:56.795\nYou don't want to miss\nset their expectations.\n\n330\n00:18:56.795 --> 00:19:00.700\nIt use to be, and\n\n331\n00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.280\nthis is one of the dangers of the\nwaterfall approach to project management.\n\n332\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.680\nIs that the users will quite often\n\n333\n00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.398\ngive us their expectations\nright at the very beginning.\n\n334\n00:19:10.398 --> 00:19:15.335\nAnd if there's not a successful amount\nof communication between the users and\n\n335\n00:19:15.335 --> 00:19:20.115\nproject team, then what kinda happen is\nthat we get this, what we call an inflated\n\n336\n00:19:20.115 --> 00:19:25.765\npeak of expectations, where we tell the\nusers that this is what's going to happen.\n\n337\n00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:28.505\nAnd they're all further here\nsomewhere imagining something.\n\n338\n00:19:28.505 --> 00:19:31.169\nBut in the meantime the project team\nare heading off down this road.\n\n339\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.307\nAnd then what's delivered\nis not what's expected.\n\n340\n00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:39.197\n&gt;&gt; And they might have already told\ntheir buddies about these great new\n\n341\n00:19:39.197 --> 00:19:42.692\ncool features, and\nit just kind of like balloons the issue.\n\n342\n00:19:42.692 --> 00:19:47.242\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah, so that's one of\nthe reasons why we wanna make sure that\n\n343\n00:19:47.242 --> 00:19:52.390\nwhat we've got is what we call maybe\nthe minimal viable product, the MVP.\n\n344\n00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.615\nWe've got something that\nwe are going to show them.\n\n345\n00:19:55.615 --> 00:19:59.371\nThat something that we are ready\nto deliver to them and\n\n346\n00:19:59.371 --> 00:20:05.309\nthey are testing just to make sure that,\nyes, it's good, it's what they accept.\n\n347\n00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:07.335\nThat's a very thoughtful look again now.\n\n348\n00:20:07.335 --> 00:20:09.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I better be careful,\n\n349\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.905\nI don't think I'm allowed to\nthink too much around here.\n\n350\n00:20:12.905 --> 00:20:15.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Its scary.\n\n351\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.330\n&gt;&gt; Just kidding, Jo,\nI love learning stuff from you.\n\n352\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.770\nI remember most of it.\n\n353\n00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.666\n&gt;&gt; You do actually, I'm very impressed.\n\n354\n00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:25.503\nI am, I'm seriously impressed,\nshe does remember most of it.\n\n355\n00:20:25.503 --> 00:20:28.717\nSo just think about\nbringing in all the teams.\n\n356\n00:20:28.717 --> 00:20:32.327\nWe've already spoken about\ncollaboration when it comes to Azure,\n\n357\n00:20:32.327 --> 00:20:35.758\nwe don't necessarily want to keep\ntesting within our own team.\n\n358\n00:20:35.758 --> 00:20:40.253\nWe have to accept that sometimes other\npeople have got more skills than we have.\n\n359\n00:20:40.253 --> 00:20:44.517\nAnd if I was developing something\nto do with Microsoft, for instance,\n\n360\n00:20:44.517 --> 00:20:48.353\nI'm gonna give it to straight to\nCherokee and ask her to test it,\n\n361\n00:20:48.353 --> 00:20:52.428\ncuz she's got way more skills than\nI have in that particular arena.\n\n362\n00:20:52.428 --> 00:20:57.439\nSo, think about your collaboration and\nremember when you are testing make\n\n363\n00:20:57.439 --> 00:21:02.780\nsure that we test the whole thing,\nthat you're not just testing an isolation.\n\n364\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.320\nCuz if you test each feature in isolation,\n\n365\n00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.490\ngo back to our previous\nepisode that we looked at it.\n\n366\n00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.300\nIt's a bit like testing\neach story in isolation.\n\n367\n00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:15.160\nYou have to test the whole epic story,\nand see that it all works together.\n\n368\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.680\nAnd then, once we've released, we have\nto think about what we are going to do\n\n369\n00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.910\nwith any sort of bug fixes or\nany other hot fixes.\n\n370\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.006\nWhat comes out of the user\nacceptance testing?\n\n371\n00:21:28.006 --> 00:21:32.899\nDo we want to just accept it and say,\nokay that's a bug, it's gonna go into our\n\n372\n00:21:32.899 --> 00:21:38.280\nnext iteration, or into our next release,\nbut I'm still going to release?\n\n373\n00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.160\nOr does it come to a stop and\nwe say right, that's a bug,\n\n374\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.080\nwe can't release with that bug, so now\nwe're gonna bring in a new iteration that\n\n375\n00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:51.360\nis going to address that and then we'll\nrelease everything once it's all working?\n\n376\n00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.420\nThat decision is up to you,\nI can't make that decision for you.\n\n377\n00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:03.970\nSome bugs, some defects, are very minor so\nwe choose to release with that and\n\n378\n00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.930\nwe actually release a known\nerror laced with our software.\n\n379\n00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.720\nAnd we say right, this our error is.\n\n380\n00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.770\nThis is what we've got\nas stand-in right now.\n\n381\n00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.460\nAnd that's gonna be fixed\nin the next release.\n\n382\n00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.070\nSometimes, and\nI've worked with software houses where\n\n383\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.508\nwhat's actually happened has been\na knockout effect, and so the next time,\n\n384\n00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:28.210\nyes, we fix that first bug,\nbut then we create three more.\n\n385\n00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:32.632\nAnd then we fix those three, and then in\nthe next release we create five more for\n\n386\n00:22:32.632 --> 00:22:33.309\ninstance.\n\n387\n00:22:33.309 --> 00:22:37.635\nSo it may be that that's not an approach\nthat you want to take, that's up to you.\n\n388\n00:22:37.635 --> 00:22:42.130\nIt's your environment, you know your\nenvironment and there is no right or\n\n389\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.340\nwrong with that.\n\n390\n00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.160\nThere's only one exception to that and\n\n391\n00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.770\nthat would be in case of\nregulatory requirements.\n\n392\n00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:54.620\nIf certain functionality, especially\nif in your arena you are maybe in-\n\n393\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.610\n&gt;&gt; Security?\n\n394\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:03.480\n&gt;&gt; Healthcare, or security, or maybe you\nare in financial arena for instance.\n\n395\n00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.060\nIf there are regulator requirements and\nyou have to meet a certain amount of, say,\n\n396\n00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:14.230\nsecurity, or thinking about\nthe data protection for instance,\n\n397\n00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:19.500\nthen there is no waiting,\nyou have to fix it.\n\n398\n00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.520\nYou can't release until you've fixed it.\n\n399\n00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.360\nAnd sometimes new regulations come into\nforce because of certain events that may\n\n400\n00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:32.310\nhave happened in the outside world\nthat you have no control over.\n\n401\n00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.620\nThings like viruses.\n\n402\n00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.630\nViruses get released,\nget developed over a weekend, or\n\n403\n00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.530\nreleased over a weekend,\nyou have no control over that.\n\n404\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.199\nYou have to update your virus protection.\n\n405\n00:23:42.199 --> 00:23:47.092\nWhether there are issues with it,\nwhether we end up with error messages when\n\n406\n00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:50.921\nwe update, the fact of the matter\nis we still got to update.\n\n407\n00:23:50.921 --> 00:23:53.338\nSo think of regulatory requirements,\n\n408\n00:23:53.338 --> 00:23:56.560\nit is the only exception\nTo that particular, well,\n\n409\n00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.630\nthe last slide that topically we've talked\nabout where you might choose to wait.\n\n410\n00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.430\nIn this instance you can't.\n\n411\n00:24:06.522 --> 00:24:12.380\nSo, what we have in our downloadable\nmaterial for you is we do have some\n\n412\n00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:17.450\ninformation for you, just a few further\nslides, that looks at test environments.\n\n413\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:21.760\nAnd we're not actually going to cover\nthose in a separate episode because\n\n414\n00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.340\ntest environments are something\nthat is completely subjective.\n\n415\n00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:31.453\nIt really is, your test environment\nis completely unique to you.\n\n416\n00:24:31.453 --> 00:24:35.395\nThe one thing that I will say to you about\na test environment is that your test\n\n417\n00:24:35.395 --> 00:24:39.760\nenvironment must mimic, as closely\nas possible, your live environment.\n\n418\n00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.195\nOtherwise you're not really giving\na true test, you're not testing\n\n419\n00:24:45.195 --> 00:24:50.820\nin a way that the users are going to\nbe using that particular product.\n\n420\n00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.530\n&gt;&gt; And that sometimes can be a challenge\nbecause building up an entire\n\n421\n00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.790\nduplicate network or whatever it is, yeah.\n\n422\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.060\nSo it sounds like a small,\nit has to be the same.\n\n423\n00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.670\nYeah, well what does that involve?\n\n424\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.405\n&gt;&gt; The amount of people that\nhave said to me in the past.\n\n425\n00:25:05.405 --> 00:25:08.366\nYeah, our test environment is exactly\nthe same as our live environment.\n\n426\n00:25:08.366 --> 00:25:13.929\nAnd I kinda look at them and\nI want to say, all right.\n\n427\n00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:18.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] And you don't want to be\ncondescending or whatever, but it's so\n\n428\n00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.920\ndifficult to get a test environment\nthat's exactly the same.\n\n429\n00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.710\nAnd the fact is that even if your\ntest environment is identical,\n\n430\n00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.600\nthink of the amount of money that it's\ngonna cost to have a test environment\n\n431\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.040\nthat's identical to your live environment.\n\n432\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.630\nThat's gonna cost a huge amount of money.\n\n433\n00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.864\nAs well as that though, you haven't got\nthe same users on your test environment\n\n434\n00:25:36.864 --> 00:25:38.517\nthat you have on your live environment.\n\n435\n00:25:38.517 --> 00:25:43.159\nAnd even though you can simulate that, and\nwe use a lot of simulation tools to help\n\n436\n00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:46.708\nus with testing, you may be able\nto simulate some things, but\n\n437\n00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:49.460\nyou can't simulate people like me,\ntrust me.\n\n438\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.699\n&gt;&gt; Julie from accounting or\nsomething like that, you never know,\n\n439\n00:25:51.699 --> 00:25:54.363\nI don't know I just picked that name,\nwe don't have a Julie in accounting.\n\n440\n00:25:54.363 --> 00:25:57.627\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah you can't simulate me,\n\n441\n00:25:57.627 --> 00:25:59.168\ntrust me, all right?\n\n442\n00:25:59.168 --> 00:25:59.929\nThere is no-.\n&gt;&gt; Or Jo,\n\n443\n00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:00.789\nyeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n444\n00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:05.250\nthere's no simulation tool that's going\nto mimic the way I deal with things.\n\n445\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:10.070\nSo, even though you might think\nthat you're testing environment is\n\n446\n00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:15.730\nthe same as your live environment,\nit's not and it's not gonna be there.\n\n447\n00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.990\nAll right, it's not gonna get that and,\naccept it.\n\n448\n00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:22.600\nThere's nothing wrong with that but\nyou've just gotta accept it.\n\n449\n00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.680\nSo when you're building your test\nenvironment, understand its parameters.\n\n450\n00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.720\nWe do let ourselves down sometimes\nin IT when we can't be honest.\n\n451\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.910\nYou mentioned that word, honest,\nactually in a previous episode.\n\n452\n00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.403\nOr before we started recording a previous\nepisode you said something about\n\n453\n00:26:39.403 --> 00:26:40.130\nbeing honest.\n\n454\n00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.201\nWe're sometimes not in IT.\n\n455\n00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:48.437\nAnd we like to think that we infallible,\nand we like to think that we've\n\n456\n00:26:48.437 --> 00:26:53.166\ngot everything prefect, and\nthat everything is going to work.\n\n457\n00:26:53.166 --> 00:26:54.127\nBut this is IT and\n\n458\n00:26:54.127 --> 00:26:58.610\nI always say to people you can't guarantee\nanything in IT because we can't.\n\n459\n00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.300\nWe never know really\nwhat's gonna go wrong, and\n\n460\n00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.620\nyou can prepare for every eventuality but\nat the end of the day\n\n461\n00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.290\nit's the one eventuality that you\ndidn't prepare for that goes wrong.\n\n462\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:09.890\n&gt;&gt; That's the word, should.\n\n463\n00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.352\nYou do hear that a lot in IT.\n\n464\n00:27:11.352 --> 00:27:12.680\nWell, it should work.\n\n465\n00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n466\n00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.100\nSo, when it comes to\nyour testing environment,\n\n467\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.900\nit's gonna be completely subjective.\n\n468\n00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:25.080\nIt's going to be unique to you and\nit should be tailored to you.\n\n469\n00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.270\nIt's not something that we can tell you.\n\n470\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.640\nWe can give you some ideas but\n\n471\n00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.040\nit's not something that we can tell you\nwhat it should look like, only you know.\n\n472\n00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.018\nSome people actually develop\nin a live environment.\n\n473\n00:27:35.018 --> 00:27:37.490\nNot something that we'd\nrecommend necessarily.\n\n474\n00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.329\nBut then,\nmaybe if it's a smaller organization,\n\n475\n00:27:40.329 --> 00:27:42.843\nmaybe that's all that's available to you.\n\n476\n00:27:42.843 --> 00:27:45.170\nThere is no right or wrong.\n\n477\n00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.260\nYou just got to remember that, and\n\n478\n00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.280\nthe entire purpose of this\nparticular series, is really just to\n\n479\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.558\nhighlight the fact that before you\nrelease anything it's got to be tested.\n\n480\n00:27:55.558 --> 00:28:00.540\n&gt;&gt; All right Jo, I think I've got my\ndelivery, my delivery of knowledge and\n\n481\n00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.900\nfor you I can thank.\n\n482\n00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.697\nAnd also thank you for joining us\nas well but for now let's sign out.\n\n483\n00:28:05.697 --> 00:28:07.719\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n484\n00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:08.309\nAnd I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n485\n00:28:08.309 --> 00:28:10.941\n&gt;&gt;
