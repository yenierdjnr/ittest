The course is meant to allow\nto us think about how to plan.\n\n6\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.522\nHow to kind of grock,\n\n7\n00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:23.610\nwhich is a terminology that means just\nfully understand a respective problem.\n\n8\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.246\nAnd in this course, what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna take an approach of, well,\n\n9\n00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:28.730\nhow do I approach a problem?\n\n10\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.163\nHow do I algorithmically\napproach something?\n\n11\n00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:35.730\nAnd that's up for debate.\n\n12\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.568\nThis is a little bit of a biased\nopinion here, so in this course.\n\n13\n00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:44.392\nBut with them, we'll have a series of\nprojects where we have planning phase and\n\n14\n00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:45.400\na coding phase.\n\n15\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.142\nSo the planing will be let me draw,\nwhat do I know?\n\n16\n00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:50.268\nHow do these things work?\n\n17\n00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:51.943\nLet's see if I can break it and\n\n18\n00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:55.766\nit's more about understanding\nwhat's called the problem space.\n\n19\n00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.410\nInstead of just going well,\nlet me write some code here.\n\n20\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.298\nSo the entire goal is to solve actual\nproblems though, they are small in\n\n21\n00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:09.105\nnature by applying a process that\nshould be applicable over a larger,\n\n22\n00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:11.151\nmore complex problem space.\n\n23\n00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:13.520\n&gt;&gt; And Justin,\nwho is this show targeted towards?\n\n24\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.890\n&gt;&gt; This is someone who's maybe just\ngetting started with programming,\n\n25\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.384\nmaybe wants to know\na little bit more about.\n\n26\n00:01:17.384 --> 00:01:19.344\nMaybe they programmed before, but\n\n27\n00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:24.490\nthey're like I'm having trouble figuring\nout what I'm supposed to do next.\n\n28\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.166\nThis show is to help those individuals\nsay, I need to do thing X.\n\n29\n00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.680\nHow do I accomplish thing X?\n\n30\n00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.388\nWell, I need to follow these\nkind of steps in order to okay,\n\n31\n00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:39.919\nthat's how I put all of these together.\n\n32\n00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:43.570\nSo the goal is to help people\nwho are having trouble.\n\n33\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.264\nMaybe they know a little bit,\nmaybe they don't.\n\n34\n00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:50.254\nHow do I actually accomplish things that\nI have original ideas for that maybe I\n\n35\n00:01:50.254 --> 00:01:55.830\ndon't know where to get started or how\nto progress in some reproducible manner.\n\n36\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.897\n&gt;&gt; Is there a certification available for\nthe course?\n\n37\n00:01:57.897 --> 00:01:59.900\n&gt;&gt; This is not a certification course.\n\n38\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.325\nThis is kind of one of those heady\ntopics where we're gonna do a little\n\n39\n00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:04.221\nbit of thinking.\n\n40\n00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:06.393\nAnd by a little bit, I mean, a lot and\n\n41\n00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:09.350\nthen we're gonna make sure\nwe have some drawing.\n\n42\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.148\nI'm gonna try to show you my\nthought process, which maybe you\n\n43\n00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:17.910\nmight have to tweak for yourself and\nthen we're going to do the application.\n\n44\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.580\nAs a result, it would be very hard\nto certify something like this.\n\n45\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.057\nYou're a certified\nalgorithm problem solver.\n\n46\n00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:29.780\nSo this is more about getting better\nin order to move forward in your craft.\n\n47\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.503\n&gt;&gt; And you've already kind of test on it,\nbut what topics are covered in this show?\n\n48\n00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:36.304\n&gt;&gt; So that the topics are mostly\nin an abstract sense planning and\n\n49\n00:02:36.304 --> 00:02:38.801\nthen actually implementing or coding.\n\n50\n00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:41.952\nBut along that, we're gonna be\nbuilding a Caesar sign for it.\n\n51\n00:02:41.952 --> 00:02:44.806\nWe're gonna be making a title function.\n\n52\n00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:49.063\nWe're gonna look at how to wait for it or\nwait for it, figure out palindromes.\n\n53\n00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:51.620\nThere's a couple of other problems and\n\n54\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.281\nthese are small that I've picked,\nbecause they should be short to do.\n\n55\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:59.388\nBut they can have some issues\nthat are nice to highlight.\n\n56\n00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:04.238\nAnd well, there's a couple other things\nwhere we're going to hijack the Python\n\n57\n00:03:04.238 --> 00:03:07.030\nsystem to give us some\nquick iteration times.\n\n58\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.131\nSo I try something.\n\n59\n00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:08.810\nIt's broke.\n\n60\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.735\nIt's not broke.\nSo being able to do that,\n\n61\n00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:15.110\nthat fast feedback is imperative to know,\nam I on the right track?\n\n62\n00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.171\nOr am I totally off base?\n\n63\n00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Justin.\n\n64\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.295\nAnd if algorithmic problem\nsolving sounds like a course,\n\n65\n00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:23.391\nyou would be interested in and\nyou should be.\n\n66\n00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:27.700\nMake sure to get all the episodes and\nsee them in our course library.\n\n67\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.689\nThanks you very much for watching.\n\n68\n00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.181\nAnd remember,\na good DevPro is always learning.\n\n69\n00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:36.291\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.865\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\n\n4\n00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:21.515\nwe're starting our series on\nalgorithmic problem solving.\n\n5\n00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.330\nIn this episode we're going\nto be approaching a problem.\n\n6\n00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.191\nAnd here to solve all of our\nproblems in all of our lives is Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:30.628\nJustin Dennison, how are you today?\n\n8\n00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:31.609\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well,\n\n9\n00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.270\nI am now absolutely terrified that you\nhave over-promised what I'm gonna deliver\n\n10\n00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.145\non, but I'm doing fairly well.\n\n11\n00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.145\nHow are you Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n12\n00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:44.746\nI'm curious to see where we are going to,\nsorry I'm approaching a problem.\n\n13\n00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:49.320\nI feel like I probably do this\nall the wrong ways of my life.\n\n14\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.781\nSo I'm hoping maybe I can get some\nlife lessons out of this, maybe or\n\n15\n00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.711\nwe're just going with coding,\nwhat're we doing here?\n\n16\n00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:59.505\n&gt;&gt; So for this episode we're actually\ngonna stay away from programming in this\n\n17\n00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:00.640\nparticular episode.\n\n18\n00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.923\nIt's about how do I think, how do I\ntumble around all the things that I\n\n19\n00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:06.490\nneed to consider when I'm\ntrying to solve a problem?\n\n20\n00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.685\nNow, this is not limited\njust to your programming,\n\n21\n00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:11.727\nI actually use this a great deal.\n\n22\n00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:15.310\nSometimes I'm out in my little workshop\ntrying to build something, right.\n\n23\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.011\nBuild something out of wood I know,\nit's crazy,\n\n24\n00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.533\nI'm more of a primitive\nindividual in there.\n\n25\n00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:25.076\nBut I'm like, wait,\nthis is what I have, wait I need,\n\n26\n00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:29.840\nwhat are my goals, so\nI apply a very systematic approach.\n\n27\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.348\nNow, before we go there,\nalgorithmic, right.\n\n28\n00:01:33.348 --> 00:01:38.179\nI just said systematic approach,\nalgorithmic, what, that's kinda odd,\n\n29\n00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.070\nright?\n\n30\n00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.128\nWhat does that mean?\nWell an algorithm,\n\n31\n00:01:41.128 --> 00:01:45.393\nI'm going to oversimplify here,\njust bear with me.\n\n32\n00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:49.416\nIt is a set of steps that can\nbe reproducibly accomplished,\n\n33\n00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:54.515\nstore done in order to arrive at\nthat particular destination, right.\n\n34\n00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:59.113\nSo if I start at point A and I know how to\nget to point B through these reproducible\n\n35\n00:01:59.113 --> 00:02:02.961\nsteps, if I always start at point\nA I should always get to point B.\n\n36\n00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:08.080\nOkay, now, we all know that life\nis not always that clean cut.\n\n37\n00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.798\nSo do bear with me,\nthis is a recommendation,\n\n38\n00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:13.796\na formalized system to help\nyou try to think about,\n\n39\n00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:18.820\nokay, I've developed something that will\nalways get me from Point A to Point B.\n\n40\n00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.152\nAssuming that there's not a pothole\nbetween Point A and Point B, so\n\n41\n00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:24.529\ndo keep that in mind.\n\n42\n00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:30.650\nNow a lot of you are like well this\nseems very math sciencey kinda oriented.\n\n43\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.246\nWell, I'm gonna try my best to\ndraw on some previous experiences\n\n44\n00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:38.853\nwhere we're not necessarily\ntalking about that.\n\n45\n00:02:38.853 --> 00:02:44.045\nBut you kinda do this already, maybe\nnot in a systematic way, but I'm gonna\n\n46\n00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:49.580\nhopefully provide a framework that will\nallow you to do this more reproducably?\n\n47\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.471\n&gt;&gt; And this is, of course,\nin the context of how you code.\n\n48\n00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:58.128\nAnd so this is probably something that\nyou do any time that you're like, okay,\n\n49\n00:02:58.128 --> 00:02:59.670\nI need to create this app.\n\n50\n00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.711\nOr even something really small,\nlike I need to create this block of code.\n\n51\n00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:04.574\nYou still go through this same,\n\n52\n00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:08.783\nkinda like a checklist before you\napproach any of your coding problems.\n\n53\n00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:10.950\nAnd like you said your wood working and\neverything.\n\n54\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.640\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly correct,\nI think of it as a checklist.\n\n55\n00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.590\nAnd full disclosure this came\nabout mainly because I was\n\n56\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.179\nmore of a science math oriented person.\n\n57\n00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.560\nActually, I had a very kinda of\nartistic bent in me when I was younger.\n\n58\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.180\nI've kind of left that behind,\nsadly just because of life.\n\n59\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.647\nBut, I started creating this checklist\nstep one, I'm going to do this,\n\n60\n00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:37.810\nstep two I'm going to do this,\nstep three I'm going to do this.\n\n61\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.479\nAnd by applying those steps I was able\nto see where am I, where am I going.\n\n62\n00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.254\nAnd do I need to take any details so\nto speak,\n\n63\n00:03:46.254 --> 00:03:49.970\nin order to figure out,how\ndo actually get there?\n\n64\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.705\n&gt;&gt; I'm also going to assume, since you've\nmaybe been doing this for a while,\n\n65\n00:03:52.705 --> 00:03:54.211\nI know you've been teaching for a while.\n\n66\n00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:56.729\nDo you get questions from your students?\n\n67\n00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.320\nI know I would be like,\nI don't even know where to start.\n\n68\n00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.208\nI don't even know what to do, and\nyou just throw your hands up and\n\n69\n00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:04.580\nit's too difficult.\n\n70\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.480\n&gt;&gt; That's actually why I\nstarted doing this myself.\n\n71\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.952\nBecause essentially when people\nsay I don't know where to start,\n\n72\n00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:15.862\nas an instructor, as a teacher,\nI go what do you know, I don't know?\n\n73\n00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:19.880\nYou know nothing, you're telling me\nyou know, you don't know anything?\n\n74\n00:04:21.192 --> 00:04:22.058\nI do know something.\n\n75\n00:04:22.058 --> 00:04:27.024\nIf you helped figure out where you\nare in the first process, then I'm more,\n\n76\n00:04:27.024 --> 00:04:29.204\nI can more effectively help you.\n\n77\n00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:31.830\nLikewise, if you know where\nyou are in the process,\n\n78\n00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.666\nyou know what kind of questions to ask,\nwhere to go find the answers to them.\n\n79\n00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:42.020\nSo this is helpful, with that said not\neverybody does it even after I fail them.\n\n80\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.528\n&gt;&gt; And I've done the same answer\nwhen my teacher, I just don't know.\n\n81\n00:04:46.528 --> 00:04:50.853\nCuz you're already at that frustration\nFrustration level that you kinda\n\n82\n00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:51.904\njust break down.\n\n83\n00:04:51.904 --> 00:04:55.493\nAnd your wall's brought up, and\nyou're just like, I don't know anything.\n\n84\n00:04:55.493 --> 00:04:57.651\nAnd then you're like,\nwait, no, just calm down.\n\n85\n00:04:57.651 --> 00:05:02.388\nSo that way, maybe before you get to that\nfrustration level, hat we're saying,\n\n86\n00:05:02.388 --> 00:05:07.004\njust kind of stop and think about this\nalgorithmic problem solving checklist.\n\n87\n00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:10.277\nAnd hopefully, you might not\nget yourself tube twisted and\n\n88\n00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:12.381\ncrying in a corner like I normally do.\n\n89\n00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:17.441\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually this should help\nbecause this is something you should\n\n90\n00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:22.670\nbe able to do with relative ease maybe\nyou stuck some part alone the way but\n\n91\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.150\nit allows you to go, I know this.\n\n92\n00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.500\nThis is what I've done,\nI have a small victory.\n\n93\n00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.160\nBut now where do I go from here, right?\n\n94\n00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.642\nI've kind of jumped across the stones and\nnow I'm in the middle of the river going,\n\n95\n00:05:34.642 --> 00:05:37.674\nI don't know which stone to jump on next,\nbut that's okay because I know\n\n96\n00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:41.130\nyou're in the middle of the river, or you\nknow you're in the middle of the river.\n\n97\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.609\nYou're like, okay,\nwell I've kind of gotten this far,\n\n98\n00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:49.793\nwhat's my next little step?Now, we've\ntalked in very strong generalities there.\n\n99\n00:05:49.793 --> 00:05:54.767\nThis is personally, in my opinion,\nthis is not backed up by\n\n100\n00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:59.351\nempirical research, but\nthis has been very helpful.\n\n101\n00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:03.288\nI've seen it been helpful to\na great deal of other people, so\n\n102\n00:06:03.288 --> 00:06:05.386\nthis is anecdotally backed up.\n\n103\n00:06:05.386 --> 00:06:08.290\nThat is a hard word to say, anecdotally.\n\n104\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.100\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you tried that and\nnot me, [LAUGH] I'm like keep going.\n\n105\n00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.235\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just going to sit here and go.\n\n106\n00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:14.932\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So let's go ahead and\n\n107\n00:06:14.932 --> 00:06:15.882\ntake a look at the iPad.\n\n108\n00:06:15.882 --> 00:06:19.002\nWe're gonna do a little bit of drawing,\nwhich interestingly enough,\n\n109\n00:06:19.002 --> 00:06:20.490\nhow do I solve a problem?\n\n110\n00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.277\nI recommend you always\nstart with draw a picture.\n\n111\n00:06:24.277 --> 00:06:27.270\nNow, what do I mean by draw a picture?\n\n112\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.154\nThat could be as simple as making a list\nif you're doing something numeric like\n\n113\n00:06:32.154 --> 00:06:36.530\nlist all the numbers, draw a diagram,\nthey don't have to be pretty.\n\n114\n00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.104\nAs a matter of fact, if you spend a lot of\ntime going I'm gonna draw this exactly to\n\n115\n00:06:41.104 --> 00:06:44.420\nscale with,\nyou're probably avoiding the other parts.\n\n116\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.074\nSo draw picture, draw a diagram,\nand when I say draw,\n\n117\n00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:53.090\njust start writing more or less to try\nto wrap your mind around the concept.\n\n118\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.030\n&gt;&gt; Well it's like they say\nback to the drawing board.\n\n119\n00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.588\nPlan it out, I know as instructors\nit's almost in our nature,\n\n120\n00:06:59.588 --> 00:07:03.079\nas soon as we start talking about\nsomething, we wanna go up and\n\n121\n00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:06.120\nget a pen on the board, and\njust start writing it out.\n\n122\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.768\nBecause that way I can kind of just\nvisualize it a little bit more if I just\n\n123\n00:07:10.768 --> 00:07:11.940\nput pen to paper.\n\n124\n00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.114\nOr electronic pen to iPad just to\nkinda get it down in that format,\n\n125\n00:07:17.114 --> 00:07:21.268\nrather than kinda just thinking of it,\nput it down.\n\n126\n00:07:21.268 --> 00:07:25.280\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly correct, and to some\nextent this is not a high pressure thing.\n\n127\n00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.156\nJust put pencil to paper or\nmarker to whiteboard or\n\n128\n00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:32.977\npencil to iPad, this isn't an iPen.\n\n129\n00:07:32.977 --> 00:07:35.995\nBut don't actually write on your iPad.\n\n130\n00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:39.623\nIt's more of a free thinking thing\nto see if your mental model,\n\n131\n00:07:39.623 --> 00:07:44.157\nwhat you've kind of thought about in\nyour head, meshes with the other parts.\n\n132\n00:07:44.157 --> 00:07:46.450\nNow what are the other parts?\n\n133\n00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.627\nWell, list what you know, all right?\n\n134\n00:07:48.627 --> 00:07:51.350\nNow, there's are like facts.\n\n135\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.978\nSo if you're in a construction site, well,\n\n136\n00:07:54.978 --> 00:08:00.424\nI know have 34 two-by-fours,\nright, or 60 pounds of nails.\n\n137\n00:08:00.424 --> 00:08:06.017\nI know I need 90 pounds of nails,\nand 124 two-by-fours,\n\n138\n00:08:06.017 --> 00:08:11.620\nwell, you kinda already started\nmolding where you're going.\n\n139\n00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.154\nNow, you're asking,\nwhere's the picture of that?\n\n140\n00:08:14.154 --> 00:08:18.190\nWell the picture is probably already given\nto you, kind of a diagrammed picture.\n\n141\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.679\nSo list what you know,\nand these are facts.\n\n142\n00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.925\nYou forgot the word know, list what you-\n&gt;&gt; What you know.\n\n143\n00:08:26.925 --> 00:08:27.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n144\n00:08:27.868 --> 00:08:31.811\nthat actually shouldn't\nbe list what you know.\n\n145\n00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:35.989\nOkay, so there's a list what you know.\n\n146\n00:08:35.989 --> 00:08:37.520\nThere we go, writing is hard.\n\n147\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.745\nSo list what you know and then I'd like\nto think of it as list what you need or,\n\n148\n00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:48.020\nlist needs but really, it's kinda,\n\n149\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.160\nI'm bad about conflating\nthese when I'm explaining it.\n\n150\n00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.530\nSo full disclosure.\n\n151\n00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.800\nSo I would essentially\nthink about what's next.\n\n152\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.990\nNow I'm not talking long term what's next,\n\n153\n00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:04.320\nI'm talking,\nwhat is the immediate next step?\n\n154\n00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.440\nOkay, now, sometimes you have\nto step back and change that as\n\n155\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.760\nyou're kind of undergoing this,\nbecause your next step is really far.\n\n156\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.570\nInstead of taking a single\nstep on a stone, you're like,\n\n157\n00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:22.030\nwow, I need to jump 140 feet that\nway which is totally off base.\n\n158\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:27.520\n&gt;&gt; I do this a lot, I wanna get here and\nthat's all I'm thinking about.\n\n159\n00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.330\nBut when I really should kind of, wait no,\nthe little increments to get there.\n\n160\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.470\nNow of course, having an end goal in mind,\nlike I need to\n\n161\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:41.350\ncreate a 128 page textbook, that kinda\nstuff but, wait then go backwards.\n\n162\n00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.630\nSo sometimes,\nI always call it designing backwards.\n\n163\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.690\nI know where I need to go but now you\nhad to go back to the beginning and\n\n164\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.700\nbreak it down.\n\n165\n00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.787\n&gt;&gt; And to some extent you could\ndo this backwards, right?\n\n166\n00:09:51.787 --> 00:09:55.000\nNotice I do not have numbers.\n\n167\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.550\nI recommend starting with drawing\na picture first because it helps you\n\n168\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:04.490\nsolidify this, and then also this, right?\n\n169\n00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.300\nCuz the picture is going to inform you.\n\n170\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.280\nNow, as I've said before your picture is\nnot necessarily an isometric drawing, or\n\n171\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.210\nan architecture diagram, or a blueprint or\nanything, it's just a quick doodle.\n\n172\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.830\nSometimes, it's a series of doodles to\nhelp just get out your thought process.\n\n173\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.828\nThough what's interesting is,\nby doing these three,\n\n174\n00:10:21.828 --> 00:10:24.331\nyou may actually find\nout what Vonne has done.\n\n175\n00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:29.640\nMan, my next step,\nright now what I have listed is giant.\n\n176\n00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.980\nI have a single sheet of paper and\nI need a 128 page textbook.\n\n177\n00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.690\nThat seems insurmountable and\nactually that leads to that\n\n178\n00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.090\nfrustration where you go, all right,\nI'm in a little panic mode.\n\n179\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.800\nI don't know where to start,\nwhere do I get started?\n\n180\n00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.460\nWell, I know this is weird, but\n\n181\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.090\nbased on academic training, elementary\nschool, middle school, high school,\n\n182\n00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.830\ncollege, technical school, we're\nreally bad about doing the following.\n\n183\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.986\nThere's one right answer,\nthere's one way to get there.\n\n184\n00:10:56.986 --> 00:10:59.406\nDon't look in the back of the book,\nit's probably there but\n\n185\n00:10:59.406 --> 00:11:00.840\nthat's called cheating, right?\n\n186\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.680\nBut that's not actually\nhow problem solving works.\n\n187\n00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.240\nWhen in doubt, change the problem.\n\n188\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:16.430\nI know that sounds crazy, But\nwhat do I mean by change the problem?\n\n189\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.776\nWell, if you're having this giant problem,\nyou go,\n\n190\n00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:23.868\nwell there's these other factors\nthat make it more complicated.\n\n191\n00:11:23.868 --> 00:11:26.406\nBecause of things like,\nwell what if those weren't there,\n\n192\n00:11:26.406 --> 00:11:28.210\ndo I know how to solve that one,\nall right?\n\n193\n00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.970\nDo I know where to begin if I didn't\nhave to consider all these edge cases?\n\n194\n00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.230\nCuz that's the second thing that I see\npeople do who also don't know where to get\n\n195\n00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.870\nstarted, is they're thinking about,\nA through Z,\n\n196\n00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.950\ninstead of worrying about,\ndo I know how to do A?\n\n197\n00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.780\nIf I can do A, cool, then I have\nonly to worry about B through Z.\n\n198\n00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.320\nBut really I don't care about those,\ndo I know how to do B, right?\n\n199\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.790\nSo if you cut it down,\nchange the problem, make it simple, right?\n\n200\n00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.020\nHave success, but by doing that you're\nlike, okay, what do I know now?\n\n201\n00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.690\nYou go back through it,\nthis is a very iterative approach.\n\n202\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.380\nYou do this, you solve it, you win, right?\n\n203\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.350\nBut maybe it's not the ultimate goal,\nthere's more of a long term plan.\n\n204\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.840\nSo if you do this iteratively, in small\nlittle chunks, you feel successful.\n\n205\n00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.060\nYou're more likely to overcome and\npersevere.\n\n206\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.560\nAnd well, you're ultimately likely\nto solve the ultimate problem.\n\n207\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.540\n&gt;&gt; I feel like you're in my head right now\nbecause it's like [LAUGH] I've done this.\n\n208\n00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.370\nAnd of course back in retrospect,\nit's like, okay, this is so complicated.\n\n209\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:31.260\nOkay, you know what, it's almost\nlike this part is really hard so\n\n210\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.500\nI'm almost gonna kinda push that out.\n\n211\n00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.630\nI know I can do this, I know I can,\n\n212\n00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.310\ntalking about the book,\nI know I can do the text edits.\n\n213\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.120\nThe picture stuff,\nmaybe I'll just leave that off and\n\n214\n00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.840\nI can get to it, just concentrate on this,\nget that small victory, and\n\n215\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.820\nthen I can go ahead and feel accomplished.\n\n216\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.620\nAnd then feel more like I\ncan take on the next task\n\n217\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.380\nbecause I've already got\na little bit under my belt.\n\n218\n00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.503\n&gt;&gt; And, that's exactly what you should do.\n\n219\n00:12:58.503 --> 00:13:01.268\nIt's really hard, but if you always\nfollow these kind of four steps, and\n\n220\n00:13:01.268 --> 00:13:04.100\nthere's a lot of steps in there,\nthere's some hidden steps.\n\n221\n00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.340\nTry to make this more general so\nit's not overly prescriptive.\n\n222\n00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.044\nDraw a picture, list the facts,\nlist your needs, right, what's next?\n\n223\n00:13:12.044 --> 00:13:14.550\nAnd then, well, when in doubt,\nchange the problem.\n\n224\n00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.475\nThe reason I put that in red is, maybe\nyou don't need to change the problem.\n\n225\n00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:21.570\nMaybe you have a very simple problem,\nwhere there's no changes to be made.\n\n226\n00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.780\nNow to kind of model this,\nto demonstrate this,\n\n227\n00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.080\nI'm gonna take something that is, maybe\nit's simple to you, maybe it's not simple.\n\n228\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.870\nBut very applicable if you're a homeowner,\nyou've ever rented, anything like that.\n\n229\n00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:38.737\nHow do I calculate how much paint\nI need in order to paint my walls?\n\n230\n00:13:38.737 --> 00:13:39.495\n&gt;&gt; Paint.\n[LAUGH]\n\n231\n00:13:39.495 --> 00:13:39.995\n&gt;&gt; Paint.\n\n232\n00:13:39.995 --> 00:13:41.155\n&gt;&gt; I thought you said how much pain,\n\n233\n00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:43.378\nI'm like, well.\n[LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:13:43.378 --> 00:13:44.064\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what,\n\n235\n00:13:44.064 --> 00:13:47.108\nif it's painful you're doing it wrong,\n[LAUGH] that's all I'm saying.\n\n236\n00:13:47.108 --> 00:13:49.250\nSo, it seems innocuous and\n\n237\n00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.940\nI try to think of examples that maybe\nyou don't, you've never painted a wall.\n\n238\n00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.820\nThat's perfectly fine,\nI'm not judging you.\n\n239\n00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.240\nI'm basing this on some\nprevious experiences and\n\n240\n00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.250\nalso basing this on something I found to\nbe very simple, because of my background.\n\n241\n00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.140\nThen I would talk to people and they'd go,\nnow this was what I was thinking.\n\n242\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.050\nAll right, so let's start here.\n\n243\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:13.190\nI need to paint, this is kind\nof the statement of the problem.\n\n244\n00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.260\nI'm over simplifying this so\nyou have to listen.\n\n245\n00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:20.342\nI need to paint an 8\n\n246\n00:14:20.342 --> 00:14:26.706\nft x 10 ft room, wow.\n\n247\n00:14:26.706 --> 00:14:29.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With 8 ft walls, now that means 8\n\n248\n00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:34.300\nft high walls, right, your walls are 8 ft,\nthat's a fairly standard wall height.\n\n249\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.680\nThat is horrible writing, so\n\n250\n00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.590\nlisten to me one more time,\nwanna paint an 8 by 10 room.\n\n251\n00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.375\nSo I have an 8 ft wall, a 10 ft wall,\nan 8 ft wall, and a 10 ft wall.\n\n252\n00:14:45.375 --> 00:14:49.140\nBut notice what I did, I kinda just\ndrew a picture for you, right?\n\n253\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.380\nAnd it has 8 ft ceilings,\nthat's a 3D picture.\n\n254\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.596\nSo, well let's actually start,\nthe question is, paint.\n\n255\n00:14:59.912 --> 00:15:03.901\nNow, part of this is gonna seem\noverly simplified because you\n\n256\n00:15:03.901 --> 00:15:08.760\nwould need to do some research\nto find out some of these facts.\n\n257\n00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.310\nBased on my experience, I just have\nkind of have these access to them.\n\n258\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:17.020\nSo, let's draw a picture okay?\n\n259\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.376\nSo, I'm thinking, most people start, well,\n\n260\n00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:28.730\nI have a room that's 8 by 10 by 8 by 10,\nright, so but that's top down view.\n\n261\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:37.265\nBut then really you kinda have\nthese walls that are also 8 ft.\n\n262\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:44.480\nOkay, so you have these walls\nthat are also 8 ft, and\n\n263\n00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.350\nyou have a wall here, so that's also 8 ft.\n\n264\n00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.571\nAnd just for completeness,\nthat will also be 8 ft.\n\n265\n00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:56.240\nInterestingly enough this is\nwhere people started tripping up.\n\n266\n00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.217\nI had several individuals go,\nI have an 8 by 10 room.\n\n267\n00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:01.350\nThat means that I need to cover.\n\n268\n00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.402\nAnd like the floor.\n\n269\n00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:06.029\nI was like, you're painting the floor,\nno I'm painting the walls,\n\n270\n00:16:06.029 --> 00:16:07.168\nthose are different.\n\n271\n00:16:07.168 --> 00:16:09.792\nBut by drawing that picture\non my head I'm like,\n\n272\n00:16:09.792 --> 00:16:12.231\nokay that's the floor, I'm looking down.\n\n273\n00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:16.502\nI really need to paint the things that\nare attached to the floor, top and bottom.\n\n274\n00:16:16.502 --> 00:16:22.226\nSo I draw a little bit picture and\nthen I do something like this,\n\n275\n00:16:22.226 --> 00:16:29.050\nI really need to paint this area, and\nthis area and this area and this area.\n\n276\n00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.690\nSo I'm not accidentally\ndistracted by the floor.\n\n277\n00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.960\nCool, focus on the red.\n\n278\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.630\nBut really if I zoom in.\n\n279\n00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.566\nIf I knew how to calculate\nthe square foot of the floor.\n\n280\n00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:46.799\nI kinda know how to calculate\nthe square foot of a wall.\n\n281\n00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:49.442\nNow you're like, square foot,\nJustin, you're talking about units,\n\n282\n00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:50.217\nthat's crazy talk.\n\n283\n00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:55.740\nWell, you just take these two numbers and\nyou multiply them, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.295\nNow, what's interesting is\nby drawing it this way,\n\n285\n00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:04.272\nI've essentially just reduced the problem\nto knowing a simpler problem,\n\n286\n00:17:04.272 --> 00:17:08.144\nand then repeating that simpler\nproblem multiple times.\n\n287\n00:17:08.144 --> 00:17:12.350\nSo if I can make it simple but\nrepeatable, it's easier.\n\n288\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.110\nAll right, so there's my drawing, okay?\n\n289\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.110\nNow, you said list what I know.\n\n290\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.000\nWell, okay, here's my knows.\n\n291\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.250\nNot my nose, my knows.\n\n292\n00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.019\nI have an 8, well,\nlet's try this one more time.\n\n293\n00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:34.936\nI have four walls,\n\n294\n00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:42.657\nAnd two of those are 8 x 10, and\n\n295\n00:17:42.657 --> 00:17:47.720\nI'm being very cavalier\nwith measurements here.\n\n296\n00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:53.920\nI have two that are 8 x 8, all right?\n\n297\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.440\nSo 8 x 8, and from my experience and\nyou would do a research,\n\n298\n00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:07.930\nI know that one gallon of\npaint will cover about\n\n299\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:13.670\nlet's go 300 square feet, okay?\n\n300\n00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.123\nIt's plus or minus depends on,\nthere's a lot of factors,\n\n301\n00:18:16.123 --> 00:18:17.455\nwe're over simplifying here.\n\n302\n00:18:17.455 --> 00:18:21.260\nWell okay, I know this, these are in feet.\n\n303\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:26.140\nI know I have how much a gallon\nwill go over a square feet?\n\n304\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.260\nDo I really need to know anything else?\n\n305\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.430\nI don't think so.\n\n306\n00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.720\nSo what's next, okay?\n\n307\n00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.780\nSo next.\n\n308\n00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.450\nWell I need to know how much paint I have.\n\n309\n00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.706\nSo how much paint?\n\n310\n00:18:43.767 --> 00:18:44.548\nWow.\n\n311\n00:18:47.738 --> 00:18:51.226\nWell, I've taken a very large step there.\n\n312\n00:18:51.226 --> 00:18:52.090\nThere's nothing here, right?\n\n313\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.298\nThere's nothing here, right?\n\n314\n00:18:54.298 --> 00:19:00.528\nThere is nothing here that immediately\njumps out to me, that I go I\n\n315\n00:19:00.528 --> 00:19:05.020\nknow I need a gallon for every 300 square\nfeet but I only have wall measurements.\n\n316\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.100\nSo what's my next step?\n\n317\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.943\nChange the problem.\n\n318\n00:19:08.943 --> 00:19:13.000\nWhat do I mean by change the problem?\n\n319\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.640\nMaybe it's changing what I know,\nor maybe I take one of these.\n\n320\n00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.694\nCan I figure it out for\nonly one of those, okay?\n\n321\n00:19:23.694 --> 00:19:26.620\nSo let's actually change the problem and\ndo exactly that.\n\n322\n00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.920\nSo I have one 8 x 10 wall.\n\n323\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.826\nWell, that's 8 feet by 10 feet,\n\n324\n00:19:35.826 --> 00:19:40.890\nwhich is 80 square feet.\n\n325\n00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.250\nWell that's crazy.\n\n326\n00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.920\nI know that one gallon\ncovers 300 square feet, and\n\n327\n00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.300\none of those 8 x 10\nwalls is 80 square feet.\n\n328\n00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.561\nSo, a gallon must cover that wall.\n\n329\n00:19:51.561 --> 00:19:55.487\nAs a matter of fact, it would cover it\nthree and a half times, four times.\n\n330\n00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:59.790\n[COUGH] Okay,\nwell I know one of these, well,\n\n331\n00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.336\nif I have two of those then\nreally what do I have?\n\n332\n00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:07.548\nI have 160 square feet.\n\n333\n00:20:09.483 --> 00:20:12.358\nAnd then these 8 x 8 walls,\nI can do the exact same thing,\n\n334\n00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:16.180\ninstead of eight foot by eight foot,\nhow many square feet is that?\n\n335\n00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.408\nWell these each are 64 square feet.\n\n336\n00:20:20.825 --> 00:20:26.146\nBut I have two of them, so\nthat's 128 square feet.\n\n337\n00:20:26.146 --> 00:20:29.102\nAnd in case you were wondering,\nif you use, that's fine,\n\n338\n00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:32.250\nbut if you're using a calculator so\nwe're fine.\n\n339\n00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:36.350\nAll right,\nwell what does that mean I have in total?\n\n340\n00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.315\nSo if I look at all my walls,\nI have 160 square feet,\n\n341\n00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:44.626\n128 square feet, that's 288 square feet.\n\n342\n00:20:48.368 --> 00:20:53.582\nAll right, what's interesting though,\nis I now have two numbers.\n\n343\n00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:02.600\nThat allow me to do a very\nsimple quick comparison.\n\n344\n00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.090\nI need to paint 288 square feet,\na gallon covers 600 square feet.\n\n345\n00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.060\nHow much paint do I need?\n\n346\n00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.090\nI need one gallon.\n\n347\n00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.388\nNow I know there was\nsome math in there and\n\n348\n00:21:14.388 --> 00:21:17.533\nthis may not necessarily be\nmostly super applicable to you.\n\n349\n00:21:17.533 --> 00:21:20.120\nWhat I wanted to show you, I start here.\n\n350\n00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.290\nI just start with one, okay?\n\n351\n00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.251\nWell, what does 8 x 10 mean?\n\n352\n00:21:23.251 --> 00:21:27.150\nSometimes you do operations,\nsometimes you do reductions.\n\n353\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.878\nWhat did I do?\nThis is technically a reduction because I\n\n354\n00:21:29.878 --> 00:21:31.485\ntook two measurements and\n\n355\n00:21:31.485 --> 00:21:35.440\nreduced it to a single measurement\nby reducing the complexity.\n\n356\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.945\nI guess that could be argued.\n\n357\n00:21:38.945 --> 00:21:41.455\nVonne might argue with me on this\nshe's like, no, no you didn't.\n\n358\n00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:49.480\nBut this is very systematic, it's not\noverly prescriptive because I can't\n\n359\n00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:55.300\ntell you always multiply two numbers\ntogether or you always leave out a piece.\n\n360\n00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.410\nBut by saying, okay,\nwell, there's my picture.\n\n361\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.750\nHere's what I know and how much paint.\n\n362\n00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.370\nWell, I didn't know how to do that.\n\n363\n00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:06.342\nSo what did I do?\nI changed the problem.\n\n364\n00:22:06.342 --> 00:22:11.412\nSo I started manipulating what I know\nbased on relationships that I have exist.\n\n365\n00:22:11.412 --> 00:22:13.120\nThis assumes you have\nsome prior knowledge,\n\n366\n00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.760\nwhich does take some time to build up,\nbut this is very algorithmic in nature.\n\n367\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.330\nThese four steps will always allow you to,\nmaybe I just make progress.\n\n368\n00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.890\nIt may be that you never get to an answer,\nand that's okay.\n\n369\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.550\nBut if you've gone further,\nyou at least know what doesn't work.\n\n370\n00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.050\nAnd if you can make a long enough list,\n\n371\n00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.040\neventually you'll figure\nout what does work.\n\n372\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.199\nI never thought how much paint you need\nfor a room would be so interesting.\n\n373\n00:22:36.199 --> 00:22:40.350\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] But seriously,\nonce you really broke it down,\n\n374\n00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:44.298\nlike when you're like, I'm like, yeah.\n\n375\n00:22:44.298 --> 00:22:48.040\nYou said a lot of people\ndon't even consider that.\n\n376\n00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.180\nBecause I'm just going over here,\nyou're like no, stop, look at the problem.\n\n377\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.270\nDraw it out, I mean that was\njust really a cool example of\n\n378\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:02.142\nwhat you need to just kinda stop,\nit's really more of like stop and\n\n379\n00:23:02.142 --> 00:23:06.689\nsmell the roses, or stop and\njust read Justin's questions.\n\n380\n00:23:06.689 --> 00:23:11.929\n[LAUGH] And get to that particular answer,\nand the other thing that I've\n\n381\n00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:17.560\nkinda come away from this is we don't\nfilm everything in all of the orders.\n\n382\n00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.565\nI've been through a couple of your\nepisodes and shows where you do this and\n\n383\n00:23:22.565 --> 00:23:27.828\nyou always start off all of your coding\nproblems or that particular episode.\n\n384\n00:23:27.828 --> 00:23:29.850\nOkay, so this isn't in the part\nof the game that we're at.\n\n385\n00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.080\nNow what what do we know?\n\n386\n00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.130\nWhere do we need to go?\n\n387\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.445\nAnd I'm like, I see it.\n\n388\n00:23:34.445 --> 00:23:35.440\n[LAUGH].\n\n389\n00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.040\nSo this has been pretty cool for\nme to watch you do this.\n\n390\n00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.366\n[LAUGH] Well, hopefully it sticks with\nyou and here as excited as Vonne but\n\n391\n00:23:43.366 --> 00:23:44.840\nthis is a quick recap.\n\n392\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.390\nWhat do we do?\n\n393\n00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.810\nWe draw our picture, right?\n\n394\n00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.690\nI mean I always draw a picture but\n\n395\n00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.330\nsometimes that picture\ncan be in your mind.\n\n396\n00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:55.920\nI do recommend when in doubt,\ndraw it on a piece of paper.\n\n397\n00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.590\nIt doesn't have to be beautiful.\n\n398\n00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.502\nI mean, come on, that was bad.\n\n399\n00:23:59.502 --> 00:24:01.125\nI left out units and things, but\n\n400\n00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:03.845\nit's meant to help you keep\ncontext about your goal.\n\n401\n00:24:03.845 --> 00:24:07.967\nIt's also to help you inform, kind of\ninform, what are the things I know?\n\n402\n00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:10.774\nCuz I can't tell you how many\ntimes I talked to people and\n\n403\n00:24:10.774 --> 00:24:13.176\nthey're like, I got an eight by ten room.\n\n404\n00:24:13.176 --> 00:24:14.302\nI'm like, cool.\n\n405\n00:24:14.302 --> 00:24:15.314\nWell how tall are the ceilings?\n\n406\n00:24:15.314 --> 00:24:16.845\nWhy do you need to know that?\n\n407\n00:24:18.755 --> 00:24:22.131\nSeems like a, right,\nglean as much information.\n\n408\n00:24:22.131 --> 00:24:25.565\nNow this is very artificial,\nkind of contrived.\n\n409\n00:24:25.565 --> 00:24:28.887\nBut by taking some of those relationships,\n\n410\n00:24:28.887 --> 00:24:33.841\nmaybe something you never thought\nway back that you'd not need.\n\n411\n00:24:33.841 --> 00:24:36.331\nAnd just applying\nincremental little pieces.\n\n412\n00:24:36.331 --> 00:24:38.852\nTrying to reduce as much as you can.\n\n413\n00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:40.705\nManipulating things.\n\n414\n00:24:40.705 --> 00:24:41.743\nSo draw a picture.\n\n415\n00:24:41.743 --> 00:24:43.075\nWrite down what you know.\n\n416\n00:24:43.075 --> 00:24:47.057\nSometimes what you know,\nyou keep adding to the what you know part.\n\n417\n00:24:47.057 --> 00:24:52.028\nYou're like yeah, I do know that, yeah, I\ndo know that, yeah, I do know that, right?\n\n418\n00:24:52.028 --> 00:24:54.405\nAnd then what is your goal, right?\n\n419\n00:24:54.405 --> 00:24:56.618\nWhat's next, or\nwhat you need to know, right?\n\n420\n00:24:56.618 --> 00:24:59.153\nWhat are your needs?\n\n421\n00:24:59.153 --> 00:25:01.683\nYou may find out that's still\na long stretch and then,\n\n422\n00:25:01.683 --> 00:25:05.264\nthat's when you apply the fourth step\nwhere you start reducing the problem.\n\n423\n00:25:05.264 --> 00:25:10.224\nChanging what you know,\nright, by certain rule sets.\n\n424\n00:25:10.224 --> 00:25:13.083\nAll right, I can't just go,\nseven, all right.\n\n425\n00:25:13.083 --> 00:25:16.328\nDon't do things like that and\nthen reduce the problem.\n\n426\n00:25:16.328 --> 00:25:18.615\nOr what if I only needed\nto paint one wall?\n\n427\n00:25:18.615 --> 00:25:20.139\nWhat if I wanted to paint the floor?\n\n428\n00:25:20.139 --> 00:25:26.127\nWhat if I, I don't know, wanted to\npaint a one square foot tile, right?\n\n429\n00:25:26.127 --> 00:25:28.207\nChange and see if you can make progress.\n\n430\n00:25:28.207 --> 00:25:32.782\nIt'll keep you less frustrated and it will\nhelp you make progress on a more complex\n\n431\n00:25:32.782 --> 00:25:35.851\nproblem, so\nthose are my four steps that I recommend.\n\n432\n00:25:35.851 --> 00:25:37.100\nIt is not exhaustive.\n\n433\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.363\nIt is not researched to the nth-degree.\n\n434\n00:25:40.363 --> 00:25:43.253\nA lot of people had variations on this,\nbut\n\n435\n00:25:43.253 --> 00:25:48.726\nit will help you at least get a formalized\napproach of what do I need to do, right?\n\n436\n00:25:48.726 --> 00:25:50.844\nWhere do I get started so to speak.\n\n437\n00:25:50.844 --> 00:25:54.956\n&gt;&gt; Well, I feel empowered to go\ntackle all of my problems and\n\n438\n00:25:54.956 --> 00:25:57.278\nsolve every single one of them.\n\n439\n00:25:57.278 --> 00:26:01.880\n[LAUGH] But it really does, when you\nbreak it down to that smallest common\n\n440\n00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.727\ndenominator, it does make big\nproblems seem a lot easier.\n\n441\n00:26:05.727 --> 00:26:08.136\nSo anything else to add there, Justin?\n\n442\n00:26:08.136 --> 00:26:09.865\n&gt;&gt; Well, just keep this in mind,\n\n443\n00:26:09.865 --> 00:26:13.861\nI'm gonna try to always reemphasize\nthis even if I'm non-explicit.\n\n444\n00:26:13.861 --> 00:26:16.424\nDo know, I'm doing this in my head.\n\n445\n00:26:16.424 --> 00:26:19.473\nIt has served me well,\nit's not always rainbows and,\n\n446\n00:26:19.473 --> 00:26:21.804\nsometimes you go well that didn't work.\n\n447\n00:26:21.804 --> 00:26:24.461\nBut that's okay, you know what?\n\n448\n00:26:24.461 --> 00:26:27.038\nEssentially you added to\nthe list of things you know and\n\n449\n00:26:27.038 --> 00:26:28.669\nnow you can reattack the problem.\n\n450\n00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:30.171\nSo don't worry.\n\n451\n00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:32.302\n&gt;&gt; All right, well I'm feeling\nbetter about myself [LAUGH] and\n\n452\n00:26:32.302 --> 00:26:34.232\nI hope y'all are feeling\nbetter about yourself too.\n\n453\n00:26:34.232 --> 00:26:37.149\nBut we are going to go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n454\n00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:40.109\nSo signing off for DevPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n455\n00:26:40.109 --> 00:26:40.857\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n456\n00:26:40.857 --> 00:26:42.862\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n457\n00:26:42.862 -->

DevProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.530\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.220\nwe're continuing on in our\nalgorithmic problem-solving series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.140\nIn this episode,\nwe're going to be finding the maximum.\n\n6\n00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.938\nWhich I feel is not kind of like finding\nthe Easter egg in a video game or\n\n7\n00:00:28.938 --> 00:00:30.193\nsomething like that.\n\n8\n00:00:30.193 --> 00:00:33.265\nBut luckily, we have somebody who's\ngonna tell me what this is all about and\n\n9\n00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:34.520\nthat is Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n10\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.392\nHello, how are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:36.816\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic Vonne, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:38.331\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n13\n00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:41.442\nThis find the maximum,\nbut then it says planning.\n\n14\n00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:46.466\nSo I'm thinking that this has something\nto do with hey, you've got some questions\n\n15\n00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:51.082\nthat you should always ask ourselves,\nthat we did in the previous episode.\n\n16\n00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:55.576\nAnd now, we need to somehow\napply those and plan forth.\n\n17\n00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:58.612\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly correct Vonne, and well,\n\n18\n00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:00.837\nthese are gonna be very simple problems.\n\n19\n00:01:00.837 --> 00:01:03.121\nLet me back up just a little bit.\n\n20\n00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.199\nYou're absolutely correct as\nwhat questions are we gonna use,\n\n21\n00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:08.650\nwe're gonna kinda use that methodology,\nright?\n\n22\n00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.554\nTo plan a programmatic\nsolution to some problem.\n\n23\n00:01:13.554 --> 00:01:18.892\nI've intentionally made these problems\nkind of very simple because I don't\n\n24\n00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:24.488\nwant to get too bogged down with let's\nsolve world hunger or anything like that.\n\n25\n00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:28.206\n[SOUND] That's a whole different thing.\n\n26\n00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:32.176\nBut here is the problem stated simply.\n\n27\n00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:37.516\nWhat is the maximum number\nin a list of numbers, right?\n\n28\n00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:42.021\nNow, if I handed it to Vonne,\nI just gave her a list of numbers,\n\n29\n00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:45.260\nshe'd go, that one but computers are dumb.\n\n30\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.442\nYou have to tell the computer\nexactly what to do, so\n\n31\n00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:51.033\nyou have to think like a computer thinks.\n\n32\n00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:56.447\nSo we have to alter our problem-solving\nscheme in order to think about that,\n\n33\n00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:57.038\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:57.038 --> 00:02:00.479\nNow, just as a quick reminder\nfrom a previous episode,\n\n35\n00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.614\ndraw a picture, what do you know?\n\n36\n00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:03.721\nWhat's next?\n\n37\n00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:08.478\nAnd then we might have to change the\nproblem if things become a little murky.\n\n38\n00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:11.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nfind the maximum is the game or\n\n39\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.882\nthe block of code that we're going to\nbe writing for the computer, okay.\n\n40\n00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:19.330\nI thought it had some special meaning-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.343\n&gt;&gt; Of reach your greatest potential!\n\n42\n00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:26.403\nNo, this is we're going to start coding.\n\n43\n00:02:26.403 --> 00:02:29.632\nAnd now we're going to plan\nout how we're going to code.\n\n44\n00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:31.401\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, reach your greatest potential.\n\n45\n00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.325\nThat's what I meant.\n\n46\n00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:35.576\nNo, it is very much that\nis the problem statement.\n\n47\n00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:37.940\nAnd we're going to have a series of\nepisodes that are just like this.\n\n48\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.735\nWe're always going to start with planning,\nand\n\n49\n00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:41.543\nsome of them are going to\nbe a little bit shorter.\n\n50\n00:02:41.543 --> 00:02:45.639\nThat's all right but I want to emphasize,\nyou should always plan your approach even\n\n51\n00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.536\nif you deviate from it,\nright while you're programming.\n\n52\n00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:51.121\nThat's gonna happen.\n\n53\n00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:54.969\nThere are times when a problem is\nvery complex that sometimes you need\n\n54\n00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.965\nto do some exploratory coding before\nyou can make an appropriate plan.\n\n55\n00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:01.209\nSo sometimes it's flipped on its end,\n\n56\n00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.021\nthat's why I've made these things\nfairly approachable, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.110\nNow, where are we gonna start?\n\n58\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.949\nWell, we're gonna employ those\nkind of set of procedures\n\n59\n00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:16.008\nto figure out how we're\ngonna make the maximum.\n\n60\n00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:19.400\nWe're not gonna write any code,\nwe're gonna have a plan that we can,\n\n61\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.214\nkinda, enact.\n\n62\n00:03:20.214 --> 00:03:25.741\nAll right, so let's go and\nhave a look at the iPad screen here and,\n\n63\n00:03:25.741 --> 00:03:32.770\nwell, we're gonna find the maximum Okay,\nthis actually shows drawing a picture.\n\n64\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.857\nThat can be helpful, because sometimes\na picture is just about, okay, well,\n\n65\n00:03:36.857 --> 00:03:39.788\nwhat about this, what about this,\nhow would that work.\n\n66\n00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:42.710\nSo I'm gonna start with drawing a picture.\n\n67\n00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.945\nSo draw a picture.\n\n68\n00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:47.492\nLet's just say, draw.\n\n69\n00:03:47.492 --> 00:03:49.319\nCuz I'm, yeah.\n\n70\n00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.063\nSo let's think about\na list of numbers here.\n\n71\n00:03:52.063 --> 00:03:56.410\nSo here's my picture, one, nope.\n\n72\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.568\nI don't know what that is, Vonne.\n\n73\n00:03:58.568 --> 00:04:02.883\nOne, two, three, all right?\n\n74\n00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:04.907\nSo there we go, now Vonne,\n\n75\n00:04:04.907 --> 00:04:09.485\nif I were to ask you what is\nthe maximum of this list of numbers?\n\n76\n00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:10.871\nWhat would you say?\n\n77\n00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:14.397\n&gt;&gt; I'm scared it's a trick question but\nI'm gonna say three.\n\n78\n00:04:14.397 --> 00:04:15.539\n&gt;&gt; It is exactly three.\n\n79\n00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:21.341\nSo if you look here, I'm gonna circle it,\nthere is my maximum.\n\n80\n00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:24.647\nNow, by drawing a picture, in my mind,\n\n81\n00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:30.597\nI go okay three just happens to be\nthe same always do something like this.\n\n82\n00:04:30.597 --> 00:04:35.569\nWhat if I say 2, 1, 3,\n\n83\n00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.545\n0 very similar, right?\n\n84\n00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:44.248\nVonne, what is the maximum in this list?\n\n85\n00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:45.933\nGonna say three, Bob.\n\n86\n00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:46.571\nWait, Justin!\n\n87\n00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:47.909\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.169\n&gt;&gt; Gonna say three, you're right.\n\n89\n00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.148\nI added a number.\n\n90\n00:04:51.148 --> 00:04:52.275\nI also changed the order.\n\n91\n00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:56.322\nOkay, well, that makes me think okay,\nwell let's do this again.\n\n92\n00:04:56.322 --> 00:05:01.965\nWhat if I do 2, 3, 1?\n\n93\n00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:05.434\nRight Vonne,\nwhat's the biggest number in this one?.\n\n94\n00:05:05.434 --> 00:05:06.231\n&gt;&gt; 3.\n\n95\n00:05:06.231 --> 00:05:08.024\n&gt;&gt; It is still 3.\n\n96\n00:05:08.024 --> 00:05:09.787\nBut I've drawn these pictures and\n\n97\n00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:12.349\nkind of went okay well I\nhave this list of numbers.\n\n98\n00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.100\nThey're in ascending order.\n\n99\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.437\n3 is the maximum.\n\n100\n00:05:16.437 --> 00:05:18.304\nJust so happens at the end.\n\n101\n00:05:18.304 --> 00:05:20.959\nIf I didn't draw other pictures,\nyou know what people will do.\n\n102\n00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:23.453\nThey'll go it's always the last one.\n\n103\n00:05:23.453 --> 00:05:29.230\nSo if I left out these other two lists and\nonly look at this one.\n\n104\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.931\nPeople go, it's always the last one.\n\n105\n00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.859\nNo, there is an assumption there.\n\n106\n00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:37.480\nThe assumption if you did that,\nis they're in ascending order,\n\n107\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.017\nthat they're ordered,\nor sorted effectively.\n\n108\n00:05:41.017 --> 00:05:45.788\nYou can't make that assumption, because\nwhat if I then throw this one at you,\n\n109\n00:05:45.788 --> 00:05:48.768\nyou go,\nthat's not the last one that breaks.\n\n110\n00:05:48.768 --> 00:05:53.645\nSo your ultimate goal in drawing a picture\nis kind of exploring the problem space.\n\n111\n00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.768\nAnd any time you have a supposition,\n\n112\n00:05:55.768 --> 00:05:58.726\nsee if you can draw a picture\nthat breaks it, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:03.263\nNow, this deviates from just\na simple picture drawing that we\n\n114\n00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:08.249\ntalked about previously, but\nthis is more programming specific.\n\n115\n00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:11.243\n&gt;&gt; So this is more like the what ifs,\nlike okay take this angle,\n\n116\n00:06:11.243 --> 00:06:14.003\nwell what if that happened,\nwhat if you threw this one,\n\n117\n00:06:14.003 --> 00:06:17.272\nwhat if I had four numbers,\nwhat if I have it in a different order.\n\n118\n00:06:17.272 --> 00:06:22.384\nAnd so you can kinda be able\nto determine next steps.\n\n119\n00:06:22.384 --> 00:06:23.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're close.\n\n120\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.924\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n121\n00:06:23.924 --> 00:06:28.803\n&gt;&gt; To some extent you're helping\nbuilding if you don't know anything\n\n122\n00:06:28.803 --> 00:06:32.152\nyou do this to help build what do I know,\nokay?\n\n123\n00:06:32.152 --> 00:06:32.964\n&gt;&gt; What do I know?\n\n124\n00:06:32.964 --> 00:06:38.559\nAnd to some extent you need to be aware,\nare there any assumptions that I'm making.\n\n125\n00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:41.395\nWe're gonna draw one final picture here.\n\n126\n00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:44.434\nPicture is a very loose term.\n\n127\n00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:51.571\nWhat if I say -1, -3 and 0\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n128\n00:06:51.571 --> 00:06:55.815\nif I look at that, well,\nI got some negative numbers in there.\n\n129\n00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:59.040\nWhich one is the maximum?\n\n130\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.752\n[SOUND] you are like hold on,\nI thought the maximum is,\n\n131\n00:07:03.752 --> 00:07:06.807\nit's actually in this case zero.\n\n132\n00:07:06.807 --> 00:07:09.481\nCuz I don't wanna be in the hole, right?\n\n133\n00:07:09.481 --> 00:07:10.634\nI don't wanna be in debt.\n\n134\n00:07:10.634 --> 00:07:14.795\nBut I'm at zero then that's the maximum\namount of money that I can have.\n\n135\n00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:20.768\nSo by thinking about all of these things,\nI can now make the list of what do I know?\n\n136\n00:07:20.768 --> 00:07:24.947\nWell so here are my knows,\n\n137\n00:07:29.106 --> 00:07:31.286\nThe list can be any size.\n\n138\n00:07:35.017 --> 00:07:40.317\nRight, so I have, I did three just for\ndrawing purposes,\n\n139\n00:07:40.317 --> 00:07:45.510\nbut really there's nothing\nspecial if I had drawn five,\n\n140\n00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.748\nI did four up here, so\nthe list can be any size.\n\n141\n00:07:49.748 --> 00:07:53.398\nThe list can be any order.\n\n142\n00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:03.259\nAll right, now, this is a list of\nnumbers that's kind of implicit.\n\n143\n00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:06.449\nSo what else do I know?\n\n144\n00:08:06.449 --> 00:08:12.236\nThere is, A maximum.\n\n145\n00:08:14.502 --> 00:08:19.819\nI know that seems kinda odd to say I know\nthat, but all of these do have a maximum.\n\n146\n00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:24.000\nBut as I was making this,\nI thought of another what if scenario.\n\n147\n00:08:26.498 --> 00:08:32.412\nWhat if I come here and\ndraw another picture and I go, 1,3,3.\n\n148\n00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:39.925\nI have duplicates, what's the maximum,\nor does that matter?\n\n149\n00:08:39.925 --> 00:08:44.797\nRight, so you can sometimes get yourself\ncaught in this weird rabbit hole where\n\n150\n00:08:44.797 --> 00:08:47.642\nyou go, what about this,\nbut does it matter?\n\n151\n00:08:47.642 --> 00:08:50.511\nSo if I am gonna ask you 1, 3, 3,\nwhich one is the biggest number?\n\n152\n00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:52.839\n&gt;&gt; 3.\n&gt;&gt; 3, because it doesn't matter whether\n\n153\n00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:57.550\nit's the first 3 or the second 3,\nit's still the biggest, right?\n\n154\n00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:02.819\nSo could be that one or it could that one,\nbut it's one of those, right?\n\n155\n00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:09.080\nSo there is a maximum and, It's funny,\n\n156\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.271\ncuz that's what we know,\nduplicates do not matter.\n\n157\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.360\nThat's not always true, by the way,\nsometimes duplicates do matter.\n\n158\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.510\nOkay, so there's our knows, list can\nbe any size, list can be any order.\n\n159\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.575\nThere is a maximum, right, it's numbers,\nso there has to be a maximum, and\n\n160\n00:09:29.575 --> 00:09:34.150\nthen duplicates do not matter, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:39.073\nWell, all right,\nthat's all I can think of that I know,\n\n162\n00:09:39.073 --> 00:09:42.470\nwe might figure out some other things.\n\n163\n00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.046\nBut now comes to the,\nwhat do I need, or what's next?\n\n164\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:56.092\nWell, really,\nI gotta find the maximum of the list.\n\n165\n00:09:57.581 --> 00:10:03.442\nWe're gonna pretend I have to,\n\n166\n00:10:03.442 --> 00:10:09.308\n[LAUGH] have to find the maximum.\n\n167\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.850\nBut I'm gonna further qualify\nthat as a computer would.\n\n168\n00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:24.228\nCuz here's where comes the difficult part.\n\n169\n00:10:24.228 --> 00:10:27.870\nThis list of knows may grow, because now\nwe've added an additional constraint.\n\n170\n00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.109\nAs I've shown Vonne and me doing this,\nwe just quickly scan and go,\n\n171\n00:10:33.109 --> 00:10:36.564\ncool, I know that 3 is the biggest,\nor 0 is the biggest.\n\n172\n00:10:36.564 --> 00:10:41.928\nRight, we looked at all of them once,\nand our mind did a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n173\n00:10:41.928 --> 00:10:45.556\nBelieve it or not, our mind did\na bunch of comparisons pairwise.\n\n174\n00:10:45.556 --> 00:10:49.034\nIt may not be in your conscious mind,\nbut you went,\n\n175\n00:10:49.034 --> 00:10:53.639\n-1 is actually bigger than -3, but\n-1 is actually smaller than 0.\n\n176\n00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:57.146\nMore or less, we're really good at going,\nthere's the biggest,\n\n177\n00:10:57.146 --> 00:10:59.619\nthere's the biggest, there's the biggest.\n\n178\n00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:03.836\nOur minds are really fast, but\nwe can survey the entire area.\n\n179\n00:11:03.836 --> 00:11:10.961\nWell, you know what, here's where things\nget a little iffy, as a computer would.\n\n180\n00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:17.490\nWell, that means I can,\nLook at one number at a time.\n\n181\n00:11:22.822 --> 00:11:25.935\nBecause effectively a computer goes,\nis this the maximum?\n\n182\n00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:30.070\nI've gotta look at the next one,\nI don't really get a large survey.\n\n183\n00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.261\nI only get kinda dealt like a deck\nof cards, here you go, here you go.\n\n184\n00:11:32.261 --> 00:11:36.678\nAnd if you've ever been part of a bad\nmagician's act, is this your card,\n\n185\n00:11:36.678 --> 00:11:40.662\nno, okay, is this your card, no,\nokay, is this your card, no,\n\n186\n00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:43.830\nwhat about, found it, right?\n\n187\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.070\nWell that's kind of how lists,\narrays, things of that nature work.\n\n188\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.360\nI look at the first one and\nthen I have some decision to make.\n\n189\n00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.684\nThis one's pretty simple, okay, so\nI need to do this as a computer, so\n\n190\n00:11:54.684 --> 00:11:57.000\nI can only look at one number at a time.\n\n191\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:04.910\nI'm thinking, I could change the problem,\nwhat if I only had one number?\n\n192\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.269\nI only had one number in\nthe list instead of three.\n\n193\n00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:12.030\nSo let's mess up this\nproblem a little bit,\n\n194\n00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:17.490\nAnd do the following.\n\n195\n00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:22.500\nI start here and\nI have the number 7, okay?\n\n196\n00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.020\nWell, what is the maximum on that list?\n\n197\n00:12:29.914 --> 00:12:34.150\nWell, I look at it,\ndo I have a maximum before?\n\n198\n00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.635\nI don't know, but\nthen as the computer, I go,\n\n199\n00:12:38.635 --> 00:12:42.010\nall right, let me look at this one.\n\n200\n00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.800\nOkay, is 7 bigger than\nthis essentially nothing?\n\n201\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:53.150\nYeah, okay, so this is 7, and then I'm\ndone cuz there's nothing else to look at.\n\n202\n00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.578\nSo that's 7, 7's the maximum, okay,\n\n203\n00:12:57.578 --> 00:13:02.129\nwell, let's see here, what if I, Vonne,\n\n204\n00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:07.740\nI'm gonna put 7,\nwhat's your favorite number?\n\n205\n00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.233\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's actually 7 [LAUGH].\n\n206\n00:13:09.233 --> 00:13:13.156\n&gt;&gt; Okay what's your second\nfavorite number [LAUGH]?\n\n207\n00:13:13.156 --> 00:13:14.868\n&gt;&gt; We'll go 4.\n&gt;&gt; 4, okay, all right,\n\n208\n00:13:14.868 --> 00:13:18.672\nso do we have a maximum when we start,\ndo we know of a maximum?\n\n209\n00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:25.740\nNot really, right, we know nothing,\nso we're like, [SOUND].\n\n210\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:31.633\nSo if we look at the 7,\nis this 7 bigger than this nothing?\n\n211\n00:13:31.633 --> 00:13:35.218\nYeah, it's a 7, but now we add the 7,\n\n212\n00:13:35.218 --> 00:13:39.767\nand we go,\nwe need to look at this other thing.\n\n213\n00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:41.670\nIs 4 bigger than 7?\n\n214\n00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:42.353\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n215\n00:13:42.353 --> 00:13:45.005\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not, sorry,\nthat was a rhetoric,\n\n216\n00:13:45.005 --> 00:13:47.328\nI was not clear on my intentions on that.\n\n217\n00:13:47.328 --> 00:13:49.157\n&gt;&gt; I was like,\nam I supposed to answer [LAUGH]?\n\n218\n00:13:49.157 --> 00:13:52.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll be more clear then,\nthat was totally my fault,\n\n219\n00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.850\nI'll take full responsibility for that.\n\n220\n00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:00.100\nWell, no it's not, so again,\n7 is our largest, okay?\n\n221\n00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.160\nSo okay, I'm actually kind of moving\nback toward my original goal.\n\n222\n00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.220\nThese are, okay, these same nodes apply,\nbut I've reduced the problem space.\n\n223\n00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.582\nSo what if it's a list of one thing,\nwell, then that has to be the maximum.\n\n224\n00:14:15.582 --> 00:14:17.406\nIf there's only one number in there,\n\n225\n00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:20.206\nthat is the biggest number\nthere regardless of what it is.\n\n226\n00:14:20.206 --> 00:14:24.221\nWhat if there's two, well,\nI can take this and say, well,\n\n227\n00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:28.390\nthe first one I encountered,\nthat has to be my maximum at that time.\n\n228\n00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.045\nBut then I take that and\ncompare it to the next one.\n\n229\n00:14:31.045 --> 00:14:38.890\nRight, so we kind of do this ad nauseum,\nbut we start here, there's nothing.\n\n230\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.524\nAnd well,\nwe'll keep Vonne's favorite number, and\n\n231\n00:14:42.524 --> 00:14:45.929\nwe'll go 4, we'll go 10, and we'll go 15.\n\n232\n00:14:45.929 --> 00:14:50.921\nOkay, now, if I were to ask\nVonne what the largest number\n\n233\n00:14:50.921 --> 00:14:54.880\nin this list is,\nI wonder what she would say.\n\n234\n00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.696\n&gt;&gt; 15.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n235\n00:14:56.696 --> 00:15:00.373\nI said I was gonna be clear, but I lied.\n\n236\n00:15:00.373 --> 00:15:05.112\nBut yes, also, I feel like Vonne\nthinks I'm trying to trick her.\n\n237\n00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:07.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I do.\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, what do you think, Vonne, and\n\n238\n00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.252\nyou go, I don't know.\n\n239\n00:15:09.252 --> 00:15:13.051\n&gt;&gt; I'm like,\nis there gonna be more code or more math?\n\n240\n00:15:13.051 --> 00:15:13.704\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like my gosh,\n\n241\n00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:14.500\nI was an art major [LAUGH].\n\n242\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I'm trying to keep these\nvery simple, because if I gave you, and\n\n243\n00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.990\nyou go, that's the biggest number.\n\n244\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.800\nEspecially if I said,\nwhich one of these do you wanna be paid?\n\n245\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.920\nYou go, I want that big one, right?\n\n246\n00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.914\nSo this is very approachable,\nhopefully, but if it's not, it's okay,\n\n247\n00:15:31.914 --> 00:15:34.626\nthere's very systematic approaches.\n\n248\n00:15:34.626 --> 00:15:38.575\n&gt;&gt; I think it's that whole,\nthink like the computer, and\n\n249\n00:15:38.575 --> 00:15:44.220\njust the knowledge I have of coding,\nI'm like, I'm going, I'm going.\n\n250\n00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.252\nAnd then it's like, oops,\nnope, I lost it again [LAUGH].\n\n251\n00:15:47.252 --> 00:15:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, I hate to tell you,\nbut that never goes away.\n\n252\n00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.331\nYou're kind of always thinking, I'm\ngetting it, nope, I don't know anything,\n\n253\n00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:57.128\nbut that's why we're doing this.\n\n254\n00:15:57.128 --> 00:16:01.889\nHow do I think like a computer when I'm\napplying these same problem solving skills\n\n255\n00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:03.070\nfrom, in general?\n\n256\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.489\nNow I have this list of four, right?\n\n257\n00:16:05.489 --> 00:16:09.353\nI kind of And I took a little detour\nthere, which is important because, right?\n\n258\n00:16:09.353 --> 00:16:15.450\nThese are the things that you may be\nthinking, I'm scared, it's totally fine.\n\n259\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.180\nVonne pointed out that 15 is the largest\none here, that's a quick scan.\n\n260\n00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.720\nBut if we look back up here, right,\n\n261\n00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.000\nif it's one, all right, there is only\none number, that has to be a maximum.\n\n262\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.860\nIf we did here, 7,4, well, 7,\nokay, that is the first one, and\n\n263\n00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.590\nit just so\nhappened that it was bigger than 4.\n\n264\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:38.642\nBut now let's go back through this, well,\nis 7 bigger than effectively nothing?\n\n265\n00:16:38.642 --> 00:16:42.750\nYeah, be careful about me saying nothing,\nI'm gonna come back to that, so\n\n266\n00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.310\nI'm kind of eluding.\n\n267\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:48.690\nSo okay, well, I compare these,\nwell, yeah, 7's the biggest one.\n\n268\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.500\nAnd then I come back and then I go,\nis 4 bigger than 7, no, okay.\n\n269\n00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:58.550\nWell now, I come back and\nI go, 10, is 10 bigger than 7?\n\n270\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:03.969\nIt is, so [SOUND],\n10 is now our new biggest.\n\n271\n00:17:03.969 --> 00:17:07.910\nAnd then we go, okay,\nis 10 bigger than 15?\n\n272\n00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:12.040\nNo, 15's actually bigger, so 15.\n\n273\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.280\nWe essentially took the exact the same\nthing we did for the one element,\n\n274\n00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.810\nthe two elements, and\nwe just did it in a systematic way.\n\n275\n00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.095\nWe went it from the beginning to the end,\nand every time we found the new biggest,\n\n276\n00:17:26.095 --> 00:17:28.680\nwe said, cool, that's our biggest,\nthat's our maximum.\n\n277\n00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.710\nAnd once you get to the end, and\nyou've run out of numbers, well,\n\n278\n00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:37.310\nwhat's the biggest number that\nwe have in the list, it's 15.\n\n279\n00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.595\nOkay, one more time,\ncuz I see Vonne giving me this kinda,\n\n280\n00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:45.221\nwhat kind of magic are you pulling here,\nJustin?\n\n281\n00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:49.240\nWell honestly, I'm like, is that a loop?\n\n282\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.999\nCuz again,\nI know a little bit of programming, and\n\n283\n00:17:52.999 --> 00:17:58.079\nI'm still in that, I mean,\nare you teaching that concept, I mean?\n\n284\n00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:01.230\n&gt;&gt; Well effectively, we're not worried\nabout the programmatic concepts, or\n\n285\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.360\nthe programmatic constructs that\nwe would use to solve this.\n\n286\n00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.960\nBut I'm just thinking, okay,\nI need to look at these one at a time,\n\n287\n00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.930\nhow do I do that?\n\n288\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.297\nMaybe it's a loop,\nmaybe it's recursive function,\n\n289\n00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:12.160\nmaybe it's a whole bunch of other stuffs.\n\n290\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.811\n&gt;&gt; It's the thought process of the loop,\nI guess that's the, well,\n\n291\n00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:17.745\nI'm using that as a program thing.\n\n292\n00:18:17.745 --> 00:18:23.014\nBut we'll just keep on going back, and\nnext step, next step, next, next, next.\n\n293\n00:18:23.014 --> 00:18:28.539\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and for the most part, that is\na very ubiquitous thing in computers,\n\n294\n00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:31.026\ntry this, nope, try this, nope.\n\n295\n00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:33.232\nThey're really good at\ndoing fast operations, so\n\n296\n00:18:33.232 --> 00:18:34.576\nthat's what you have them do.\n\n297\n00:18:34.576 --> 00:18:39.034\n&gt;&gt; And the comparison,\ncuz you're saying, is this bigger,\n\n298\n00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:41.988\nis this bigger, yes, no, if-then.\n\n299\n00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:45.248\nI mean, all these things are coming\nto my mind as you're doing it, so\n\n300\n00:18:45.248 --> 00:18:47.396\nthat's just why I'm over here going, hmm.\n\n301\n00:18:47.396 --> 00:18:49.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's funny,\n\n302\n00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.842\nbecause I do wanna emphasize,\nyou're absolutely correct.\n\n303\n00:18:51.842 --> 00:18:54.439\nI'm trying my best to stay\naway from that terminology,\n\n304\n00:18:54.439 --> 00:18:56.825\nbecause you should be\nasking yourself questions.\n\n305\n00:18:56.825 --> 00:19:01.371\nWhen you think of a question,\nit should be some kind of if-then,\n\n306\n00:19:01.371 --> 00:19:03.859\ncomparison-type thing, right?\n\n307\n00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:06.167\nIs it this, that's a yes-or-no question,\n\n308\n00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:09.950\nyes-or-no questions lead me to\ncertain programmatic constructs.\n\n309\n00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.918\nNow the list, I need to go one-by-one and\ndo something one-by-one, what is that?\n\n310\n00:19:14.918 --> 00:19:21.713\nWell, that's probably a loop,\nright, so, Those end up mapping.\n\n311\n00:19:21.713 --> 00:19:25.444\nBut don't get too hung up on trying\nto make sure that you have those,\n\n312\n00:19:25.444 --> 00:19:26.696\nat this point in time.\n\n313\n00:19:26.696 --> 00:19:30.680\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, I'm using words that are in\nprogram languages, programming or\n\n314\n00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.523\nany kind of scripting languages.\n\n315\n00:19:32.523 --> 00:19:36.770\nBut it's still, if you take it out of it,\nit's just regular talk, you know?\n\n316\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.517\nI'm gonna loop around the block, and\nI'm gonna make an if-decision, and\n\n317\n00:19:41.517 --> 00:19:43.008\nthen figure an answer.\n\n318\n00:19:43.008 --> 00:19:46.043\nAnd yeah, so I mean,\nI'm saying it in a general context.\n\n319\n00:19:46.043 --> 00:19:48.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's interesting,\n\n320\n00:19:48.546 --> 00:19:52.140\nbecause there is one final\nthing I told you, this nothing.\n\n321\n00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.900\nYou have to be careful,\nwhen we have things like that.\n\n322\n00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.031\nSo we'll keep your number in there,\nthere's 15, and\n\n323\n00:20:03.031 --> 00:20:08.209\nthere's 107, and there's -3,\nokay, so this is a longer list.\n\n324\n00:20:08.209 --> 00:20:11.285\nBut up until this point,\nI've said nothing, when I say nothing, and\n\n325\n00:20:11.285 --> 00:20:12.182\nyou think numbers?\n\n326\n00:20:12.182 --> 00:20:17.860\nVonne, when I say nothing,\nwhat do you think of?\n\n327\n00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.575\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think of zero,\nbut, I'm just gonna say zero.\n\n328\n00:20:22.575 --> 00:20:26.147\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I have nothing,\n\n329\n00:20:26.147 --> 00:20:28.802\nthat means I have zero.\n\n330\n00:20:28.802 --> 00:20:33.398\nYou gotta be careful, though,\nbecause you're like, that would,\n\n331\n00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:37.492\nif I put a 0 here, it would still work,\nright, if I put a 0 here.\n\n332\n00:20:37.492 --> 00:20:40.592\nBut what if I come and go negative,\nnegative, negative, negative?\n\n333\n00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:49.479\nGuess what, we accidentally said that\nthe maximum of this list is zero,\n\n334\n00:20:49.479 --> 00:20:51.337\nso you can´t do that.\n\n335\n00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:56.181\nYour nothing can't be essentially 0,\nbecause what about negative numbers?\n\n336\n00:20:56.181 --> 00:20:59.536\nWell, if I have a list of\nnegative numbers, right,\n\n337\n00:20:59.536 --> 00:21:04.515\nif go back up here to the top, we saw\nthat negatives sometimes change things.\n\n338\n00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:09.033\nAnd actually, that 0 that's circled,\nyou're like, that is the biggest one, but\n\n339\n00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:11.721\nthat one was in the list,\nthis one's not in the list.\n\n340\n00:21:11.721 --> 00:21:16.891\nSo that's kinda odd,\nright, so what do we do?\n\n341\n00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:21.623\nWell, instead of picking nothing,\n\n342\n00:21:21.623 --> 00:21:27.210\nwhat if we think about the smallest\nnumber that we could ever think of?\n\n343\n00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:31.964\nNow what do I mean by small,\nsmall not like in fraction,\n\n344\n00:21:31.964 --> 00:21:35.818\npositive numbers, but way, way negative.\n\n345\n00:21:35.818 --> 00:21:40.433\nIf you had it in your checking account,\nit would be panic-stricken,\n\n346\n00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:43.105\nright, so what is the smallest number?\n\n347\n00:21:43.105 --> 00:21:49.814\nIt is the opposite of maximum,\nright, tiny, tiny, tiny.\n\n348\n00:21:49.814 --> 00:21:53.509\nWe get to make this up, and\nit actually depends on our problem space.\n\n349\n00:21:53.509 --> 00:21:59.909\nSo I'm thinking,\nwhat if we did -1 billion,\n\n350\n00:21:59.909 --> 00:22:04.229\nthat's not how you do billion,\n\n351\n00:22:04.229 --> 00:22:09.829\n-1 billion, could that work in place?\n\n352\n00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:14.064\nWell, let's see, I don't know, maybe,\n\n353\n00:22:14.064 --> 00:22:18.879\nlet's see, is -1 billion bigger than -43?\n\n354\n00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:25.181\nNo, I would rather be $43 in\nthe hole than I would 1 billion,\n\n355\n00:22:25.181 --> 00:22:29.400\nso guess what, -43 is our new maximum.\n\n356\n00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.207\nOkay, is -43 bigger than -7, careful,\n\n357\n00:22:34.207 --> 00:22:38.532\nnegative numbers can be a little iffy.\n\n358\n00:22:38.532 --> 00:22:41.370\nNo, -7 is actually closer to 0,\n\n359\n00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.850\nthat's what I mean by bigger when\nit comes to negative numbers.\n\n360\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:50.040\nBut this is now -7, okay,\nlet's compare, is -15 bigger than -7?\n\n361\n00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.200\nNo, that's actually going backwards,\nI'm losing money, so to speak.\n\n362\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:23:00.798\nAnd then here, -107, no,\nthat's actually more in debt, that's bad.\n\n363\n00:23:00.798 --> 00:23:08.412\nAnd then I come here, -3,\nis -3 bigger than -7, is it closer to 0?\n\n364\n00:23:08.412 --> 00:23:14.180\nYep, so -3, so there's -3,\nis -3 the biggest or closest to 0, yes.\n\n365\n00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.740\nDid it matter that I\nstarted with -1 billion,\n\n366\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.768\nversus this question mark up here?\n\n367\n00:23:21.768 --> 00:23:26.369\nNo, because I've picked something\nthat is astronomically,\n\n368\n00:23:26.369 --> 00:23:29.940\nwell, negative in this case,\nand should work.\n\n369\n00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:36.100\nHowever, do keep in mind,\nthere's always limitations.\n\n370\n00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:43.137\nI could make this so crazy small that\nit would never be reached, right?\n\n371\n00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:50.583\nBut I think -1 billion is good,\nbecause it's approachable.\n\n372\n00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:54.255\nBut now the final thing is,\nI did that because I was like, okay,\n\n373\n00:23:54.255 --> 00:23:58.281\nnegative numbers, I need something tiny,\nwhat if I do -1 billion?\n\n374\n00:24:01.439 --> 00:24:07.414\nBut now my list is 3, 8, 12.\n\n375\n00:24:07.414 --> 00:24:10.630\nWell, let's try that,\nis -1 billion bigger than 3?\n\n376\n00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:15.710\nNo, 3 is bigger, cuz that's way negative.\n\n377\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.960\nIs 3 bigger than 8, no, 8's bigger.\n\n378\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.300\nIs 8 bigger than 12, no, 12's bigger.\n\n379\n00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.926\nIt still works,\neven with positive numbers.\n\n380\n00:24:31.926 --> 00:24:35.895\nI know this is a little counter-intuitive,\nbut this is very similar.\n\n381\n00:24:35.895 --> 00:24:40.812\nBecause, well, we can't use zero, because\nthat's not actually nothing when it\n\n382\n00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:44.268\ncomes to numbers,\nit's right in the middle, actually.\n\n383\n00:24:44.268 --> 00:24:48.748\nWe can't use the absence of a value,\nbecause the computer's like, well,\n\n384\n00:24:48.748 --> 00:24:52.046\nI kinda need to know something\nto compare it to, right?\n\n385\n00:24:52.046 --> 00:24:55.151\nThe computer has to go,\nwell, I have this number and\n\n386\n00:24:55.151 --> 00:24:58.480\nthis number,\nhow do I compare this number and nothing?\n\n387\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:05.567\nIt might not work, so you have to\nconsider that as you're designing these.\n\n388\n00:25:05.567 --> 00:25:08.453\nNow, if you're still kinda worried\nafter this initial thought process?\n\n389\n00:25:08.453 --> 00:25:15.270\nWe've employed these same steps, we've\naltered them a little bit for computers.\n\n390\n00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.150\nAnd then we started changing the problem,\nand\n\n391\n00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.910\nthen we built back up to\nthe original problem, right?\n\n392\n00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:24.170\nWe reduced it, and we were like,\nokay, that's what I know, next.\n\n393\n00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.564\nThat's what I know, next,\nthat's what I know, next, and\n\n394\n00:25:27.564 --> 00:25:30.177\nthat's ultimately what\nyou should be doing.\n\n395\n00:25:30.177 --> 00:25:34.430\nNow that you have this,\nwe need to formalize this into, well,\n\n396\n00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.856\nactually, a program or function.\n\n397\n00:25:36.856 --> 00:25:41.075\nIt's actually a function, it's very\nsimple as far as grand-scale programs go.\n\n398\n00:25:41.075 --> 00:25:42.401\nBut you know what, Vonne,\n\n399\n00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:45.640\nI'm pretty sure we don't have\na chance to do that in this episode.\n\n400\n00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.380\nSo we're gonna have to come back, and\nactually see how this is implemented.\n\n401\n00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.374\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you're setting the scene,\nwe're planning it out,\n\n402\n00:25:51.374 --> 00:25:53.646\nwe've done all of out kind\nof what-if scenarios.\n\n403\n00:25:53.646 --> 00:25:54.731\nI mean,\nthat's what I'm thinking in my head.\n\n404\n00:25:54.731 --> 00:25:58.562\nTo just go ahead and\nmake sure that we have our parameters set,\n\n405\n00:25:58.562 --> 00:26:01.150\nbefore we continue finding the maximum.\n\n406\n00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.385\nAll right, well, thank you so\nmuch for that, Justin, but\n\n407\n00:26:03.385 --> 00:26:05.465\nwe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n408\n00:26:05.465 --> 00:26:08.477\nSigning off for DevProTV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n409\n00:26:08.477 --> 00:26:09.308\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n410\n00:26:09.308 --> 00:26:10.732\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n411\n00:26:10.732 --> 00:26:16.077\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm gonna try my absolute best.\n\n9\n00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.230\nBut before we do, how are you Zach?\n\n10\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.030\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm excited.\n\n11\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.300\nThis is an exciting episode.\n\n12\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.440\nI wanna find out what's going on.\n\n13\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.870\n&gt;&gt; Well we're going to see if you're\nstill excited by the end of it.\n\n14\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.188\nBecause sometimes algorithms, well,\nthey don't get all the glitz and\n\n15\n00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:45.433\nglam in a roller coaster runs,\nthey are meant to be very reproducible,\n\n16\n00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:49.580\nstraightforward, and\nkinda already planned and thought about.\n\n17\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.350\nHey, what are we doing?\n\n18\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.670\nWhat are we building?\n\n19\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.410\nBut now, let's actually\nimplement that plan in code.\n\n20\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.260\nNow, since in this series this is the\nfirst time we've actually written code,\n\n21\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.470\nwe will have a little bit of setup that\nmay not be necessary in other episodes.\n\n22\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.490\nHowever there's a few other things\nthat we're gonna be introduced to.\n\n23\n00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.980\nFull disclosure,\nI'm gonna hijack one of the things in\n\n24\n00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.460\npython just to give us a little\nbit of feedback, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.600\nSo, sometimes when\ndeveloping an algorithm,\n\n26\n00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.430\nit's a little bit of trial and error.\n\n27\n00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.960\nLemme try this, there it is.\n\n28\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.900\nI forgot about this other thing.\n\n29\n00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.980\nThere it is.\n\n30\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.810\nSo we have to think about that, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.880\nSo that's important, but you know what?\n\n32\n00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.980\nEnough talk.\n\n33\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.870\nTo show you, to see if Zach is wowed\nat the end of the episode as he\n\n34\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.000\nwas at the beginning-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.510\n&gt;&gt; We should probably actually do this.\n\n36\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.420\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here.\n\n37\n00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.060\nAnd well, there's nothing.\n\n38\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.570\nI am just on the terminal.\n\n39\n00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.390\n&gt;&gt; It's a nice blank screen there.\n\n40\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.590\n&gt;&gt; And just as a reminder, let's\nactually close that out, close this out,\n\n41\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.350\nand let's start brand new fresh.\n\n42\n00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.480\nWe just logged in,\nwe're like we have an algorithm in mind,\n\n43\n00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.130\nlet's implement it,\nlet's see how it works, right?\n\n44\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.670\nSo I've intentionally\nchosen very simple ones.\n\n45\n00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.130\nJust to get our mind churning about\nhow to approach these problems, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.170\nSo let's go here and\nthat's command spacebar on Windows,\n\n47\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.790\nthat could just be the Windows key,\nand then on Linux, most Linux things,\n\n48\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.600\nyou can hit the Windows key if you've\ninstalled it on a Windows based computer\n\n49\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.790\nand you'll get a search feature very\nsimilar to this on all of those platforms.\n\n50\n00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.270\nAnd I'm gonna type terminal on Windows.\n\n51\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.940\nThat's gonna get a little iffy for you.\n\n52\n00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.250\nSo if we open this up.\n\n53\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.920\nAll right, so there's just my\nlittle terminal section, and\n\n54\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.890\nI'm gonna full screen that and\nthen blow that font up,\n\n55\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.860\nbecause otherwise-\n&gt;&gt; We won't be able to see.\n\n56\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.110\n&gt;&gt; You would just be real\nclose to your screen going,\n\n57\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.390\nI don't know what he's doing,\nthat's kinda weird.\n\n58\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.460\nSo that's what we're doing right now,\nokay.\n\n59\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.140\nSo all right, we got that.\n\n60\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.950\nLet's go ahead and\nhop over to the desktop.\n\n61\n00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.080\nSo cd, change directory under the desktop.\n\n62\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.230\nAnd we're gonna say,\n\n63\n00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.880\nlet's just call it algorithms cuz\nthat's already kind of hard to spell.\n\n64\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.230\nSo make dir algorithms, and\nI'm gonna hop inside of algorithms.\n\n65\n00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.610\nAnd now I'm gonna make another folder.\n\n66\n00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.420\nWe're gonna organize these\nwith folders just because.\n\n67\n00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.770\nAnd we're going to, not that.\n\n68\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.994\nLet's call this finding the maximum.\n\n69\n00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:18.150\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n70\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.930\n&gt;&gt; And then we're going to hop\ninside of finding the maximum.\n\n71\n00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.910\nAnd, we're good to go, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.955\nAs far as we are now.\n\n73\n00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n74\n00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.400\n&gt;&gt; For now, we're going to hop back\nover and open VisualStudio code.\n\n75\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.600\nAnd I did the exact same thing, Command,\nspace bar, I typed Visual Studio Code.\n\n76\n00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.510\nAnd then I'm gonna maximize that as well,\nbut now we're going to Open,\n\n77\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.160\nand I'm gonna hop over here to Documents.\n\n78\n00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.280\nNo, I lied.\n\n79\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.750\nDesktop, algorithms, and\nthen find the maximum.\n\n80\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.390\nOkay, so I'm just going to open the find\nthe maximum folder that's going to refresh\n\n81\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.080\nand now we have the open folder,\nbut there's nothing inside of it.\n\n82\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.430\nNow, we could create the file here where\nwe're actually going to do our coding,\n\n83\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.350\nagain this is a little bit of set up.\n\n84\n00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.530\nWe'll probably go through a little\nbit of this each time just to be very\n\n85\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.802\nalgorithmic about our\napproach about algorithms.\n\n86\n00:04:15.802 --> 00:04:16.940\n&gt;&gt;

I thought it might be a trick question.\n\n140\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.260\n&gt;&gt; Like, Justin, is it seven?\n\n141\n00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.470\nNo, no it's not seven.\n\n142\n00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.370\nIt is three.\n\n143\n00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.770\nYou're right,\nI\"m just messing with you Zach.\n\n144\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.460\nSo, we're gonna go with Zach's answer, and\n\n145\n00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.230\nnotice that max_num [1,\n2, 3] should be three.\n\n146\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.080\nEffectively, what I'm saying is,\nwhen I run this file, I wanna make sure\n\n147\n00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.850\nthat max num of 1, 2, 3,\nis in fact three, okay?\n\n148\n00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.760\nNow, at this point I could put a comma and\nadd a message.\n\n149\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:27.430\nMax should be three in [1, 2, 3].\n\n150\n00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.960\nI'm probably not going to write\na message for all of these, but\n\n151\n00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.350\nit's good to have those.\n\n152\n00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.860\nFull disclosure the reason I'm\nhaving hijacking this, this is not,\n\n153\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.480\nthis is something that we\ncan quickly think about what\n\n154\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.370\nare all of the things I want to test,\nand then see where they fail.\n\n155\n00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.806\nThis is not highly extensible,\n\n156\n00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:49.794\nthis is not necessarily something\nI would put in production code.\n\n157\n00:07:49.794 --> 00:07:53.603\nBut I'm using it because, well it's\navailable to use in the standard library,\n\n158\n00:07:53.603 --> 00:07:57.355\nand we don't have to install anything,\nwe don't have to do all kinds of setup,\n\n159\n00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:58.605\nit's just there, okay?\n\n160\n00:07:58.605 --> 00:08:02.700\nBut it is handy because it lets you know\nif I have a bunch of essentially these\n\n161\n00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.730\nare checklists, and if any of them\nfail and my algorithm doesn't meet its\n\n162\n00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.760\nrequirements, it doesn't meet\nits requirements, then it's bad.\n\n163\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.800\nSay it with me.\n\n164\n00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.520\nBad.\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:50.723\n&gt;&gt; 45.\n\n194\n00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:51.352\n&gt;&gt; It is 45.\n\n195\n00:09:51.352 --> 00:09:53.122\nI just did that on purpose.\n\n196\n00:09:53.122 --> 00:09:54.037\n&gt;&gt;

I am trickster.\n\n201\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.011\nI am a trickster.\n\n202\n00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:10.415\nSo, it is 45, so, now if we save this\nnow we have an insertion there and\n\n203\n00:10:10.415 --> 00:10:13.180\nI have no fulfilled all\nof the requirements.\n\n204\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.470\nSo, what I'm saying is maybe it's\ngood to think about some of these,\n\n205\n00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.770\njust give some examples.\n\n206\n00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.380\nThat way you're not hopping into the uuu,\ntrying things out, that doesn't work.\n\n207\n00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.840\nThere's nothing wrong with that, but\nif you're trying to just nail down one\n\n208\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.990\nparticular thing, then this is\nprobably an easier way, all right?\n\n209\n00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:39.700\nSo, if we think about this,\nright, our algorithm was assume\n\n210\n00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:44.840\nthe smallest number is the biggest, the\nsmallest number that we could figure out.\n\n211\n00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.930\nAnd then, as we go through the list\nof numbers if the number we find is\n\n212\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:56.570\nbigger than our previous biggest,\nmake that the new biggest.\n\n213\n00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.560\nI said the word biggest a lot there.\n\n214\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.980\n&gt;&gt;

It was pretty small.\n\n222\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.360\n&gt;&gt; But it's pretty small.\n\n223\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.300\nReal negative.\n\n224\n00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.410\n&gt;&gt; Very negative.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n225\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.060\nSo, there's a result, okay?\n\n226\n00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.100\nAnd now, when I run this,\nwell, what am I gonna do?\n\n227\n00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.060\nI'm gonna take each element of this list,\nwe know there's a number.\n\n228\n00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:36.850\nAnd I'm gonna say for num in list, okay?\n\n229\n00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.680\nNow, I'm not gonna add any logic here.\n\n230\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.020\nThis is still gonna break\nmy assert statements.\n\n231\n00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.100\nBut I'm just gonna print[num].\n\n232\n00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.400\nI'm gonna make sure all of this works.\n\n233\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:50.030\nSo, python3, and notice it prints,\nand then it immediately fails.\n\n234\n00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.767\nSo, it actually runs the entire function\nwithin that assert statement below [SOUND]\n\n235\n00:11:54.767 --> 00:11:56.196\ncut to that, all right?\n\n236\n00:11:56.196 --> 00:11:56.799\nSo, 1, 2, 3.\n\n237\n00:11:56.799 --> 00:12:03.230\nAll right, so if I go down three here,\nis 1 bigger than negative 1 billion, Zach?\n\n238\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n239\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.770\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n240\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.690\nIs 2 bigger than 1?\n\n241\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n242\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.580\n&gt;&gt; Is 3 bigger than 2?\n\n243\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Why yes.\n&gt;&gt; And it is.\n\n244\n00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.490\nSo, notice how we have that chain.\n\n245\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.650\nWhere I encounter 1.\n\n246\n00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.800\nI go, hey,\nis that bigger than negative 1 billion?\n\n247\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.480\nIt is.\n\n248\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.760\nCool.\nWell, ones my new biggest.\n\n249\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.710\nThen I go, well is two bigger than one?\n\n250\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.050\nWhich is now the biggest.\n\n251\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.650\nYeah, it is, so it's the new biggest.\n\n252\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.770\nHow do we codify that?\n\n253\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:39.850\nWell, if i come here and go, yes,\nnum is greater than the current result.\n\n254\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.530\nAnd you know what, let's change this\nsince I'm using this terminology.\n\n255\n00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.180\nThe biggest.\n\n256\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.250\nThe biggest is currently\nnegative 1 billion here.\n\n257\n00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.710\nFor each number in the list if the number\nis greater than the biggest, well,\n\n258\n00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:53.800\nwhat do we do?\n\n259\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.990\nWell, we say the biggest\nis now that number.\n\n260\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.100\nOkay, so essentially we're just going,\nis that one bigger?\n\n261\n00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.939\nCool, that's my new biggest, and then like\n[SOUND], that one's the biggest, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:04.939 --> 00:13:08.470\nNow, we talked about this\nduring the planning phase, but\n\n263\n00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:13.070\nI'm just kinda reiterating this as\nwe think about this respective code.\n\n264\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.880\nOkay.\n\n265\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.060\nSo, there we go.\n\n266\n00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.030\nAnd once I get through this for loop,\n\n267\n00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:24.900\nI've run through every number in the list,\nI should have found the biggest.\n\n268\n00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.470\nAnd we're gonna see,\nwe're gonna take this as an example,\n\n269\n00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.760\nbecause this one two, three.\n\n270\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.940\nActually, let's zoom in here.\n\n271\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.820\nNegative 1 billion.\n\n272\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.940\n1 is bigger than -1 billion,\nso it's now 1.\n\n273\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.440\n2 is bigger than 1, yeah, now it's 2.\n\n274\n00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.230\n3 is bigger than 2, so now it's 3.\n\n275\n00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.460\nThat should return 3.\n\n276\n00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.260\nNotice this second example.\n\n277\n00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.390\nThese are in sequential order, so\nthat would lull me into a false sense of\n\n278\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.660\nsecurity if I designed my algorithm\naround a sequence of numbers.\n\n279\n00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.900\nWell, is 23 bigger than\nnegative 1 billion, Zach?\n\n280\n00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n281\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.052\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n282\n00:14:01.052 --> 00:14:03.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'll tell you what,\n\n283\n00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.450\nsometimes he makes me\nsweat with those pauses.\n\n284\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.300\nIs 45 bigger than 23?\n\n285\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So, 45's now the biggest.\n\n286\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.380\nIs 1 bigger than 45?\n\n287\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.020\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n288\n00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.670\nThen we don't reassign.\n\n289\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.400\n45's still our biggest.\n\n290\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.223\nAnd then, we go was 10 bigger than\nthe current biggest, which is 45?\n\n291\n00:14:21.223 --> 00:14:26.500\nNo, so 45 is still the biggest, right?\n\n292\n00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.940\nBoth of these should pass\nif our algorithm is good.\n\n293\n00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.980\nNow, there's always things to think about.\n\n294\n00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.580\nBut how I do that?\n\n295\n00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:39.410\nI say, well, at the end,\nreturn the biggest, just like that.\n\n296\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.570\nSo, start at the biggest as negative\n1 billion for none in LST, right?\n\n297\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.440\nFor age, number, list if the number\nis bigger than the biggest,\n\n298\n00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.670\nthen the biggest is equal to the num now.\n\n299\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:58.030\nAnd as we do that swapping at the very\nend we kinda just go, there's the final,\n\n300\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.950\nbiggest number in the list, right?\n\n301\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.140\nThis is reproducible,\n\n302\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:07.190\nthis always selects the largest\nnumber in a collection of numbers.\n\n303\n00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.510\n&gt;&gt; That was good.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n304\n00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.010\nNow.\n\n305\n00:15:11.306 --> 00:15:15.580\nIf we run this I get no errors.\n\n306\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.600\nBut I warn you, we have two chance, right?\n\n307\n00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.030\nWe have two test, one,\ntwo, three, that works.\n\n308\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.720\nThis number works.\n\n309\n00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.870\nBut what about other things, right?\n\n310\n00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.660\nWe have no negative numbers here,\nright, so\n\n311\n00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.250\nwe should always be thinking\nabout how can I break this.\n\n312\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.540\nIs there a way to break this.\n\n313\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:43.332\nDo I have a faulty assumptions,\n\n314\n00:15:43.332 --> 00:15:46.703\nlet 's say it assert,\n\n315\n00:15:46.703 --> 00:15:52.038\nmax_num(-5,-3,-2).\n\n316\n00:15:52.038 --> 00:15:56.112\nAnd that should be equal and,\nwell, let's think about it.\n\n317\n00:15:56.112 --> 00:15:59.214\nWhich one is the biggest,\nwhat do I mean by the biggest,\n\n318\n00:15:59.214 --> 00:16:01.132\nthe maximum, the most positive?\n\n319\n00:16:01.132 --> 00:16:03.962\nIf you're in debt $2 versus in debt $5,\n\n320\n00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:07.560\nI'd rather be in debt $2\ncuz I'm closer to positive.\n\n321\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.610\nSo the biggest in this is -2, all right?\n\n322\n00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.653\nSo I've added a test,\nI haven't changed my algorithm, cool.\n\n323\n00:16:13.653 --> 00:16:20.430\nPython 3, main.py,\neverything still works, awesome.\n\n324\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.556\nI made this a little more robust.\n\n325\n00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:27.360\nWhat about assert max_num, and\nI'm gonna go big or go home.\n\n326\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.910\nThe list of a range of numbers from,\n\n327\n00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:38.618\nWait for it, 10,000, but I'm actually\ngonna add 1 here, cuz I have to overrun,\n\n328\n00:16:38.618 --> 00:16:41.124\nso essentially this is 0 to 10,000.\n\n329\n00:16:41.124 --> 00:16:43.895\nWhat is the biggest number in\na list of numbers from 0 to 10,000?\n\n330\n00:16:43.895 --> 00:16:44.615\n&gt;&gt; 10,000.\n\n331\n00:16:44.615 --> 00:16:46.410\n&gt;&gt; 10,000, he said 10,000,\nall right so 10,000.\n\n332\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.772\nI tried that dramatic pause,\nit just doesn't work for me.\n\n333\n00:16:50.772 --> 00:16:55.300\n&gt;&gt; No, I didn't do the dramatic pause.\n\n334\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.350\n&gt;&gt; No, I tried it,\nit just didn't work for me.\n\n335\n00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:02.440\nSo if we come back here,\neverything still works.\n\n336\n00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:09.300\nNow as it stands, there's a couple of\nedge cases that can happen in algorithms.\n\n337\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.608\n&gt;&gt; You always like to\npresent the edge cases.\n\n338\n00:17:11.608 --> 00:17:13.768\n&gt;&gt; Gets you every time.\n\n339\n00:17:13.768 --> 00:17:20.020\nWhat if I said assert\nmax_num of an empty list?\n\n340\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.011\nWhat should be the maximum of this?\n\n341\n00:17:25.313 --> 00:17:29.420\nIf I have no numbers, what is the maximum?\n\n342\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.399\n&gt;&gt; There isn't one.\n\n343\n00:17:32.399 --> 00:17:33.552\n&gt;&gt; There isn't one, right?\n\n344\n00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:37.130\nSo how do you handle that?\n\n345\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.710\nWell given this assertion\nportion that we've done,\n\n346\n00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.180\nunless I had something where someone said,\nhey, this algorithm list is empty.\n\n347\n00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.790\nIt returns zero, right,\nso we could do that.\n\n348\n00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.810\nAnd that's where this algorithm will\nalways find the biggest number,\n\n349\n00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.160\nas long as there are numbers in that list.\n\n350\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.976\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n351\n00:17:55.976 --> 00:18:00.290\n&gt;&gt; If there are not numbers in that list,\nif there's nothing in that list-\n\n352\n00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:00.820\n&gt;&gt; It's got nothing to grab.\n\n353\n00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.038\n&gt;&gt; Then it's got nothing to grab,\nso I have to say, okay,\n\n354\n00:18:04.038 --> 00:18:05.690\nhere's how you treat that.\n\n355\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.410\nSo someone may come along and say,\nwell if there's nothing there,\n\n356\n00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.790\njust return zero, okay?\n\n357\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:18.750\nAll right well, how do I fix this, because\nif I come back and I run this main.py.\n\n358\n00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.682\nBoom, it broke, why is that?\n\n359\n00:18:21.682 --> 00:18:28.377\nThat's because this never runs and biggest\nwill always be negative 1 billion, okay?\n\n360\n00:18:28.377 --> 00:18:33.520\nSo if they say 0,\nwell you have this minimum, right?\n\n361\n00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.181\nThe biggest starts out as this very\nminimum number, as negative 1 billion.\n\n362\n00:18:38.181 --> 00:18:41.839\nYou could make the argument that,\nwell, if there's nothing there,\n\n363\n00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:44.660\nthen just return that minimum, okay?\n\n364\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.281\nSo I don't wanna mess up this part,\ncuz this is easy to read,\n\n365\n00:18:48.281 --> 00:18:50.276\neasy to reason about hopefully.\n\n366\n00:18:50.276 --> 00:18:51.840\nIf I say hey, you know what?\n\n367\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.007\nIf there's nothing there,\n\n368\n00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:56.080\nI'm just gonna return this minimum\nnumber that is a very specific number.\n\n369\n00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.801\nAnd you can go, that's kind of weird, and\n\n370\n00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:02.320\nyou're pushing off the handling\nof that somewhere else.\n\n371\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.270\nThere's a bunch of ways to handle that.\n\n372\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.077\nBut this is about algorithmic thinking,\n\n373\n00:19:06.077 --> 00:19:09.030\nthe algorithm part is there's an edge\ncase that I have to consider.\n\n374\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.500\nWe're not worried so\n\n375\n00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.340\nmuch about the implications of\nhow we fix that at current time.\n\n376\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.467\nSo I'm just gonna say, you know what,\nif there's nothing in there,\n\n377\n00:19:17.467 --> 00:19:18.854\nI'm gonna return 1 billion.\n\n378\n00:19:18.854 --> 00:19:23.240\nAwesome, good, so boom, and you know what?\n\n379\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.560\nThat is a perfect example of you're\nhaving trouble with the problem,\n\n380\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.396\nchange the problem, right?\n\n381\n00:19:29.396 --> 00:19:33.072\nSo I wanted to find the biggest,\nI had an edge case, and I was like,\n\n382\n00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:35.190\nI don't really know, do I return 0?\n\n383\n00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.591\nWell, if this is where I start out,\nlet's just say, well if the list is empty,\n\n384\n00:19:39.591 --> 00:19:41.777\nreturn where you started out, right?\n\n385\n00:19:41.777 --> 00:19:46.530\nAnd then now this function has been\ntested for a few different things.\n\n386\n00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.967\nWe've developed this algorithm,\nand we've test checked,\n\n387\n00:19:49.967 --> 00:19:52.883\nwe've approached the plan,\nand we should be good.\n\n388\n00:19:52.883 --> 00:19:54.687\nAnd well Zach, there you have it,\n\n389\n00:19:54.687 --> 00:19:57.870\nthat's how you find the largest\nnumber in a list of numbers.\n\n390\n00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.795\nSeemed like it might be\na little more complicated, but\n\n391\n00:20:00.795 --> 00:20:04.850\nit ended up being a few lines of code,\nand then boom, there you had it.\n\n392\n00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.280\n&gt;&gt; And I think you did a wonderful job.\n\n393\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.095\nFind the maximum, coding, great episode.\n\n394\n00:20:09.095 --> 00:20:11.115\nBefore we move on, anything else?\n\n395\n00:20:11.115 --> 00:20:14.908\n&gt;&gt; Well, just always think about\nhow to approach these problems.\n\n396\n00:20:14.908 --> 00:20:16.230\nWhat do you know?\n\n397\n00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.611\nWhat do you need to know?\n\n398\n00:20:17.611 --> 00:20:18.530\nHave you stated the problem?\n\n399\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.280\nHave you drawn a picture?\n\n400\n00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.110\nHave you thought about\nchanging the problem\n\n401\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.600\nin order to get a better idea of\nthe actual more complicated problem?\n\n402\n00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.050\nNow these are pretty simple, so\nmaybe that's not always the case.\n\n403\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:34.040\nBut those are all things that\nyou consider as you're kinda\n\n404\n00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.960\nalgorithmically kind of\nsolving these things, right?\n\n405\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:44.320\nSolving in some capacity, so keep\nthose in mind and it'll get you along.\n\n406\n00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.180\nI'm not saying you will never be\nfrustrated, but it will be very helpful.\n\n407\n00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.250\n&gt;&gt; And Justin, you are very helpful,\nyou did a great job.\n\n408\n00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.814\nAlgorithmic problem solving, make sure you\nsee every episode, you'll be glad you did.\n\n409\n00:20:53.814 --> 00:20:57.612\nAnd you'll be in the course library,\nwhere there's thousands of other videos.\n\n410\n00:20:57.612 --> 00:20:59.591\nAnd they're there to help you go further,\nso check those out too.\n\n411\n00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:04.440\nTell everybody you know about DevPro.TV,\na good Dev Pro is always learning.\n\n412\n00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.467\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n413\n00:21:05.467 --> 00:21:06.302\n&gt;&gt;

DEVPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:18.537\nI'm you host Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.537 --> 00:00:22.048\nwe are moving through our series\non algorithmic problem solving.\n\n5\n00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:26.317\nIn this episode,\nwe're going to be reversing a string.\n\n6\n00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:30.382\nYes, that's what we're going to bring, and\nplanning how to do that, and here to help\n\n7\n00:00:30.382 --> 00:00:34.025\nus put that thing down, and flip it,\nand reverse it is Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:35.276\nI've been waiting all day to say that.\n\n9\n00:00:35.276 --> 00:00:37.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering which one of us\n\n10\n00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.373\nwas gonna do a Missy Elliot quote,\nbut it was you Vonne, and well,\n\n11\n00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.499\nnow that you've said that,\nhow are you today?\n\n12\n00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:43.780\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n13\n00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.854\nI hear we're gonna be turning\naround some letters and things.\n\n14\n00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:49.701\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly what\nwe're gonna be doing.\n\n15\n00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:54.293\nSo let me set the scene for you before we\ndive into the actual planning portion.\n\n16\n00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:55.560\nVery simple thing.\n\n17\n00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.170\nI give you a string,\nlike my name J-U-S-T-I-N, right?\n\n18\n00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:08.060\nI should get, now here's the tricky part,\nN-I-T-E-S-U-J back as the output.\n\n19\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.190\nIt seems fairly simple, but\nit does require a little bit of thought,\n\n20\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.330\nand as I said in previous episodes,\nthe goal is to not make these problems too\n\n21\n00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.290\nover complicated,\nit's to focus on kind of the planning, and\n\n22\n00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.100\nthen the implementation that\nfollows from respective planning.\n\n23\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.708\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be like we did with\nthe finding the maximum, where it's like,\n\n24\n00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:32.461\nhere in our non-computer brains,\nI was like, yeah, that's what it is, but\n\n25\n00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:35.701\nto really slow it down,\nlook at it piece by piece, and\n\n26\n00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:39.877\nthen be able to see how the outcome is,\nbecause, like you just said,\n\n27\n00:01:39.877 --> 00:01:43.864\njust think about it in reverse,\nbut how do we problem solve that?\n\n28\n00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:45.539\n&gt;&gt; And that's the tricky part, right?\n\n29\n00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.280\nHow do we do this so that we can\nimplement it in a computing way?\n\n30\n00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.768\nNow I'm not saying this is the only way,\nthe way we're gonna plan, the way we're\n\n31\n00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:58.320\ngonna implement, but it is a way, and it\nis something that you have to think about,\n\n32\n00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.965\nnecessary when you're actually\nprogramming, so how do I go about\n\n33\n00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:05.905\nreproducing this, and we're always\ngonna follow our steps, right?\n\n34\n00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:10.066\nWe're gonna draw a picture, we're gonna\nlist what we know, we're gonna think about\n\n35\n00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:13.041\nwhat's next, and then if need\nbe we will change the problem.\n\n36\n00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:17.350\nSo I think there's no better time than\nnow to, I guess, let's get started.\n\n37\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.429\nSo let's take a look at the screen here,\nand, well,\n\n38\n00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.252\nalways number one is draw a picture.\n\n39\n00:02:24.252 --> 00:02:24.990\nSo we're gonna draw.\n\n40\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.425\nI'm gonna keep these short.\n\n41\n00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:28.787\nSo what do I mean by draw a picture?\n\n42\n00:02:28.787 --> 00:02:29.760\nYou're like, well, it's text.\n\n43\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.792\nIt's a string.\n\n44\n00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:32.780\nIt's just a sequence of characters.\n\n45\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.819\nAll of those things are right, but\nlet's draw a picture so we can kinda think\n\n46\n00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.809\nabout, well how does this appear,\nwhat does it look like in the computer?\n\n47\n00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.913\nSo, Vonne if you know anything about me,\n\n48\n00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:47.314\nthen I like-\n&gt;&gt; I like cheese.\n\n49\n00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:49.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I like cheese.\n\n50\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.460\nSo that's a fairly long string.\n\n51\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.378\nNow you're like, well,\nthat's not a fairly long string.\n\n52\n00:02:55.378 --> 00:02:59.660\nWell, it is when you start\ntrying to manipulate it.\n\n53\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.004\nNow there's a few things.\n\n54\n00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:03.420\nI look at this and I go well how to do,\nI want to reverse it.\n\n55\n00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.417\nIf I just ask you, if I ask Vonne or\nany person on the street, what is this\n\n56\n00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:11.953\nreversed, and they might have some\nquestions, like what do you mean reversed,\n\n57\n00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:15.753\nlike I'm writing it backwards, and\nI still get the same output, or\n\n58\n00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:20.117\ndo you mean I'm reading left to right,\nand I'm getting the reverse output?\n\n59\n00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:24.256\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I mean you could say,\nif you ask me, I'd be like cheese like I.\n\n60\n00:03:24.256 --> 00:03:26.443\nI mean, I'm doing by word.\n\n61\n00:03:26.443 --> 00:03:29.097\nSo that's what you're saying\nmaybe specifically, or\n\n62\n00:03:29.097 --> 00:03:32.604\nare you telling me by letter, by word,\nall those different parameters?\n\n63\n00:03:32.604 --> 00:03:36.035\n&gt;&gt; I want effectively a mirror image other\nthan the characters being backwards.\n\n64\n00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:38.262\nI want it by the letter, right?\n\n65\n00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:38.872\nSo that's our goal.\n\n66\n00:03:38.872 --> 00:03:44.583\nNow we could apply a very similar\nthing to get cheese like I,\n\n67\n00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:49.952\nright, but I want like E-S-E-E-H-C,\ncapital C,\n\n68\n00:03:49.952 --> 00:03:54.651\nspace, E-K-I, capital L, space capital I.\n\n69\n00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:59.987\n&gt;&gt; See, I probaly would have just left\nout the spaces, because it's letters,\n\n70\n00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:04.997\nbut that space is a character when\nyou're talking about input devices,\n\n71\n00:04:04.997 --> 00:04:07.316\nthere is a physical space there.\n\n72\n00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:12.197\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there is a physical space, and by\ndrawing a picture, and kind of arranging,\n\n73\n00:04:12.197 --> 00:04:14.172\nyou get an idea of how this works.\n\n74\n00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:18.233\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm actually\ngoing to draw little boxes around\n\n75\n00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:19.910\nthe individual characters.\n\n76\n00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.600\nNow this is not gonna be perfect,\nbut that's all right,\n\n77\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.280\nand so, I have these boxes like so,\n\n78\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.790\nand I know that technically in a computer,\nthey're arranged very similarly.\n\n79\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.600\nWe have a collection of characters.\n\n80\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.020\nSo that's my drawing,\nthat's some way to think about, okay,\n\n81\n00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.550\nI have I space L-I-K-E space C-H-E-E-S-E,\nand then there is nothing after that.\n\n82\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.517\nThere could be,\nthere could be a hidden space over there,\n\n83\n00:04:54.517 --> 00:04:56.250\nI'm gonna make the assumption\nthat there's not.\n\n84\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.871\nSo, what do I know?\n\n85\n00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:02.014\nSo here's my knows.\n\n86\n00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:14.160\nStrings Are sequences of characters.\n\n87\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.192\nNow, what do I mean by a sequence?\n\n88\n00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:17.596\nWell, it's one right after the other.\n\n89\n00:05:17.596 --> 00:05:20.235\nI can't just take these letters and\njust randomly put them on a page.\n\n90\n00:05:20.235 --> 00:05:21.151\nI have them say this.\n\n91\n00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:23.990\nThey have a distinct order.\n\n92\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.885\nAlso I know that strings\n\n93\n00:05:28.885 --> 00:05:32.807\nare zero indexed.\n\n94\n00:05:32.807 --> 00:05:38.558\nNow, well, I know that just based on\nmy understanding, but you know what?\n\n95\n00:05:38.558 --> 00:05:40.390\nAlways go back and modify your picture.\n\n96\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.940\nIf you find out that you've lifted\nsomething that you know that\n\n97\n00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.145\nyou have it reflected appropriately\non respective drawing.\n\n98\n00:05:47.145 --> 00:05:53.765\n&gt;&gt; Can I ask a, I wanna say dump question,\nzero index, can you clarify that for me?\n\n99\n00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:56.955\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I sure can, well I can try to.\n\n100\n00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:58.925\nI may fail miserably,\nbut that's all right.\n\n101\n00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:02.960\nSo zero index means that,\ninstead of saying I is the first letter,\n\n102\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.482\nit is the zeroth letter.\n\n103\n00:06:04.482 --> 00:06:07.836\nIt is the one, two, the three,\nthe four, the five-\n\n104\n00:06:07.836 --> 00:06:09.310\n&gt;&gt; This is the what I always call,\n\n105\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.340\ncounting from zero.\n\n106\n00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.996\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n107\n00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:15.679\n&gt;&gt; Because we count as one, but\nthe computer always counts from zero.\n\n108\n00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:16.293\nIs that?\n\n109\n00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:16.831\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n110\n00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:17.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n111\n00:06:17.492 --> 00:06:21.237\n&gt;&gt; So for the most part, computers count\nfrom zero, and strings are zero indexed,\n\n112\n00:06:21.237 --> 00:06:22.850\nor they start counting from zero.\n\n113\n00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.830\nSo the first letter is actually at\nzero index, so it starts at zero.\n\n114\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.430\nNow I just went back and changed the\ndrawing to reflect that respective thing.\n\n115\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.790\n&gt;&gt; Is it only text, or\nare numerical characters the same way?\n\n116\n00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.129\n&gt;&gt; So, if they're in a string,\nif they're in quotes-\n\n117\n00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.662\n&gt;&gt; Strings,\n\n118\n00:06:42.662 --> 00:06:44.383\nthat's the key word right there.\n\n119\n00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:48.423\nThe strings, so you could put numbers\nin a, like when you did this.\n\n120\n00:06:48.423 --> 00:06:49.052\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n121\n00:06:49.052 --> 00:06:51.115\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that indicates\nthis is a string of text.\n\n122\n00:06:51.115 --> 00:06:53.213\nLook at it as a string, not as a number.\n\n123\n00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:53.788\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n124\n00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:54.498\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n125\n00:06:54.498 --> 00:06:55.209\nGotcha.\n\n126\n00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:58.734\n&gt;&gt; Now there are other things that are\nzero index, but they're all collections,\n\n127\n00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:00.980\nlike things you can put\ntogether into a sequence.\n\n128\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:07.145\nThey're not technically always sequenced,\nit gets a little foggy there sometimes,\n\n129\n00:07:07.145 --> 00:07:10.850\nbut strings, if you have quotes\naround them, this applies.\n\n130\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.978\nIf you do not have quotes then number one,\nyour letters are interpreted as variables.\n\n131\n00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:17.100\nYou would have a space.\n\n132\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.177\nThings would go awry.\n\n133\n00:07:18.177 --> 00:07:23.182\nIf you had a number, like number one,\nit would be, that's the number one,\n\n134\n00:07:23.182 --> 00:07:26.141\nnot a string representation\nof the number one.\n\n135\n00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:30.130\n&gt;&gt; And maybe further down the line, or\nsomewhere, this is more like a program.\n\n136\n00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.619\nYou have to declare that this is a string,\n\n137\n00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:35.598\nso-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n138\n00:07:35.598 --> 00:07:36.448\n&gt;&gt; That way it knows.\n\n139\n00:07:36.448 --> 00:07:40.448\n&gt;&gt; We have to make sure that we\nkeep our data types in check, but\n\n140\n00:07:40.448 --> 00:07:43.653\nyou can get kind of\nsideways when that happens.\n\n141\n00:07:43.653 --> 00:07:46.411\nSo definitely something to\nthink about to remember.\n\n142\n00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:48.220\nSo strings are sequence of characters.\n\n143\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.010\nStrings are zero indexed.\n\n144\n00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.325\nSpaces count.\n\n145\n00:07:51.325 --> 00:07:53.025\nUh-oh.\n\n146\n00:07:53.025 --> 00:07:54.626\nSpaces count.\n\n147\n00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:58.612\nAll right.\n\n148\n00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:00.472\nAnd what else do I know?\n\n149\n00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:05.560\nWell, strings have some special behaviors.\n\n150\n00:08:11.204 --> 00:08:12.890\nBehaviors, wow.\n\n151\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.490\nThat is really not writing for me.\n\n152\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.630\nSo what are those behaviors,\nwell you can find stuff in a string.\n\n153\n00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:25.049\nYou can find the index of\nparticular like strings,\n\n154\n00:08:25.049 --> 00:08:29.089\nyou can grab what we call substrings.\n\n155\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:39.250\nAnd strings have some properties but the\none we're most concerned with, I think.\n\n156\n00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:45.090\nThe only property that really makes sense\nto me is, well it has a length, right?\n\n157\n00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.970\nNow I don't know if I'm gonna\nneed all of these, any of these.\n\n158\n00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.240\nI'm just listing the things\nthat I know because now,\n\n159\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.350\nI don't have to go,\nnow what was that last thing?\n\n160\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:57.730\nI have a list, I'll just look at the list\nwhen I'm planning essentially what's next.\n\n161\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.400\nNow, there may be a few more things,\n\n162\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.360\nbut I think this might give us\na good idea of what's next.\n\n163\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.420\nSo, what's next, right?\n\n164\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.990\nSo, how do I figure that out?\n\n165\n00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:18.870\nWell, I need to reverse the string, but we\nalready knew that's what we needed to do.\n\n166\n00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:28.390\nReally, if I think about it,\nthis is still very broad.\n\n167\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.550\nI'm gonna employ my change the problem.\n\n168\n00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:41.595\nIf I can reverse the string,\nif I can put the last letter, First.\n\n169\n00:09:41.595 --> 00:09:49.500\nIf I could do that, then I kind of have\na step, a small step, so how do I do that?\n\n170\n00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.040\nOkay, so let's think about that.\n\n171\n00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.049\nThis is how we've changed the problem.\n\n172\n00:09:55.049 --> 00:09:58.419\nI'm not worried about\nchanging the string so\n\n173\n00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:02.330\nmuch as I am,\njust put the last letter first, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:09.030\nAlso this was a good example of, I have\na long, I have capital letters and spaces.\n\n175\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.378\nLet's start with something shorter like,\nI don't know,\n\n176\n00:10:14.378 --> 00:10:22.610\nmaybe we could just start with\ncheese as a word, not anything else.\n\n177\n00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.957\nNow we can still this up, so\nthis is kind of we are coming back for\n\n178\n00:10:26.957 --> 00:10:28.170\nour drawing step.\n\n179\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:34.125\nAnd that's perfectly okay, and that's\nactually something that I do okay, these\n\n180\n00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:40.520\nare the things I know and now let's come\nback and think about our drawing step.\n\n181\n00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.751\nSo, we can chant these up, like so, and\n\n182\n00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:48.493\nwe have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n183\n00:10:48.493 --> 00:10:52.370\nThere is six letters,\nthe last index is five.\n\n184\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:59.632\nAll right, how do I put the last\nletter which is an e first?\n\n185\n00:10:59.632 --> 00:11:02.770\nThat would be my first step.\n\n186\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:08.560\nWell, if I could come some way and\nkind of like cut that off, right?\n\n187\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.220\nAnd move it over here and\nthen put an e in there,\n\n188\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:21.790\nright if I could chop it up,\nthen if that was first, cool.\n\n189\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.880\nWell, if I did that again, right?\n\n190\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:32.910\nIf I chop this off and each time I'm\nchopping I have ches and then chee,\n\n191\n00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:38.520\nso I chop that off then I\nmove that over here, right?\n\n192\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.640\nSo there's my s, oops,\nlet's keep consistency here.\n\n193\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.420\n&gt;&gt; And Justin would this be,\nbecause now you're going back to.\n\n194\n00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.300\nIt's still take the last letter, but\nsince you removed one, it's not like,\n\n195\n00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.150\nit's not the next to last,\ncuz it's now been removed.\n\n196\n00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.770\nSo s is now the last letter\nafter this first iteration, and\n\n197\n00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.800\nthen the s moves over.\n\n198\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.700\nIs that what we're thinking right now?\n\n199\n00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's effectively what we're doing.\n\n200\n00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.600\nNow, our implementation details\nmay be a little bit different, but\n\n201\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.570\nI'm thinking if I can chop this up and\nbring the last letter over,\n\n202\n00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.930\nthen effectively what I have and\nlet's just be a little clear here.\n\n203\n00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.992\nSo there's the C and H and E and E.\n\n204\n00:12:17.992 --> 00:12:22.553\nSo I've chopped up these two letters,\nyou're exactly right, Vonne,\n\n205\n00:12:22.553 --> 00:12:24.360\nI effectively have cheese.\n\n206\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.762\nSo this is 0, 1, 2, 3 now,\n\n207\n00:12:27.762 --> 00:12:32.435\nright the index has\nchanged the last index.\n\n208\n00:12:32.435 --> 00:12:36.919\nSo if I was able to chop those off and\nbring those over, if I was could then link\n\n209\n00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:41.210\nthose two together, well I've\nstarted the reversal process, right.\n\n210\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.925\nDoes it still count if\nwe continue to do that?\n\n211\n00:12:45.925 --> 00:12:51.000\nSo if we chop this off and\nbring this over here, then that's an E.\n\n212\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.380\nRight?\n\n213\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.060\nAnd then well, if we chopped this off and\nwe bring us over here,\n\n214\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.520\nthat's another E and\nthen if we do that two more times,\n\n215\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.585\nwell, I'm running out of room.\n\n216\n00:13:07.585 --> 00:13:10.752\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was like, hold on a second,\n\n217\n00:13:10.752 --> 00:13:12.960\nI'm missing something here.\n\n218\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.880\nSo I could do h and c, so\nI would have eseehc, I don't know.\n\n219\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.200\nSo I would have a reversal of the word,\nbut\n\n220\n00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.640\nnotice I started with,\nI can just put the last letter first.\n\n221\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.440\nAnd then I was like, well wait\na minute I put the last letter first.\n\n222\n00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:34.490\nI kind of cut these up, I can then\nput the last letter first again, but\n\n223\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.770\nhere is the trick, first of what?\n\n224\n00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:42.750\nBecause I can't alter this as I was going,\nput the last letter first.\n\n225\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.390\nWell this last letter did become first but\nthen,\n\n226\n00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.060\nthis last letter actually\ngets tacked on first.\n\n227\n00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.080\n&gt;&gt; That's not first,\nthat's second or the next first.\n\n228\n00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.852\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so effectively,\n\n229\n00:13:55.852 --> 00:14:00.580\nwe want the original string, and then we\nwant a work space, like a scratch pad,\n\n230\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.088\nright.\n\n231\n00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:05.305\nAnd so, I'm going to go okay,\nput this one in first and\n\n232\n00:14:05.305 --> 00:14:09.950\nthen put this one in next, and\nthen put this one in next.\n\n233\n00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.430\n&gt;&gt; Do we need to know\nhow many blocks we have?\n\n234\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.350\nThere's five, then there's five over here,\n\n235\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.500\nis that something that we need to,\nor am I going down the wrong path?\n\n236\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.275\n&gt;&gt; So actually and\nsome other programming languages,\n\n237\n00:14:24.275 --> 00:14:26.996\nway back when,\nyou would probably need to do that.\n\n238\n00:14:26.996 --> 00:14:30.949\nYou would need to say I have five spaces\nover here, I need five spaces over here or\n\n239\n00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:33.030\nsix spaces and six spaces.\n\n240\n00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.360\nBut really, we are focusing on a string so\nI just wanna say well I have a string and\n\n241\n00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.870\nwhatever I had in my work space,\nlet's actually draw this out.\n\n242\n00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:46.031\nSo here is my original, right,\n\n243\n00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:50.050\nand let's say pie.\n\n244\n00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:56.587\nWe're switching from cheese here,\nand then here's my work space.\n\n245\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.010\nOriginally that looks like an e, but\n\n246\n00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:07.400\nthat is actually a c, so\nwork space, there we go.\n\n247\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.470\nStill kinda looks like an e.\n\n248\n00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:15.090\nSo originally, you were like\nwell I have three pieces here,\n\n249\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.510\nyou go well my work space needs\nenough space to contain those.\n\n250\n00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.583\nBut with newer programming languages, and\n\n251\n00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:22.830\nreally you should be\nfocusing on how this goes.\n\n252\n00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.656\nSee how I've drawn this where it almost\nlooks like I have a pad of paper and\n\n253\n00:15:26.656 --> 00:15:28.180\na pad of paper.\n\n254\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.960\nWell, if I can write it on this paper,\n\n255\n00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.630\nthen I should be able to\nwrite it on this paper.\n\n256\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.170\nOkay, just because the papers\nare relative size.\n\n257\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.060\nThere's a lot going on behind\nthe scenes that allow this to happen.\n\n258\n00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.605\nSo as long as I can fit\nall of these pieces.\n\n259\n00:15:44.605 --> 00:15:49.923\nIn the original, there should be a way\nthat I can define a blank work space and\n\n260\n00:15:49.923 --> 00:15:54.325\nkind of build this up over time,\nwhere I take the last letter and\n\n261\n00:15:54.325 --> 00:15:58.990\nI move it over here, right and\nthen I grab the next letter.\n\n262\n00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.610\nAnd I'll move it over here,\nRight, just like that.\n\n263\n00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.540\nAnd then I'll grab this letter,\nwhich is now the last, but\n\n264\n00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.500\nit's only one of them,\nand I put it over here.\n\n265\n00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.060\nSo eip, eip.\n\n266\n00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.370\nSo it's odd, what does that mean?\n\n267\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.620\nWell you kind of need like\nsomething to accumulate.\n\n268\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.662\nAnd you do this, you do this\nanyway without thinking about it.\n\n269\n00:16:27.662 --> 00:16:29.750\nIf you've ever tried to count anything,\nI don't know,\n\n270\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.390\nlike the forks in your culinary drawer,\nI don't know.\n\n271\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.070\nSomething like that.\n\n272\n00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.970\nOr all the pencils you have at your desk,\nright?\n\n273\n00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.075\nWhen you start counting and you go,\n\n274\n00:16:38.075 --> 00:16:42.530\none, right before you started counting at\none, how many pencils had you counted?\n\n275\n00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.180\nNone.\nSo you started with an empty thing and\n\n276\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.270\nthen you can add to that\nempty thing over and over and\n\n277\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.460\nover again and\nget all of the pieces together.\n\n278\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.160\nWell, luckily strings\nhave that empty thing.\n\n279\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:06.800\nIt's either a single set of quotes or\nit could be an empty set of double quotes.\n\n280\n00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.850\nThere is no space there, okay?\n\n281\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.200\nThey're just right next to each other.\n\n282\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.839\nThis is the empty string.\n\n283\n00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:24.190\nIt is very similar to how zero works for\nnumbers.\n\n284\n00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:28.590\nI have nothing and\nthen I kind of accumulate into those.\n\n285\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.520\nOkay?\n\n286\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.610\nNow in a previous episode I was like,\nnothing is kinda hard.\n\n287\n00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.630\nI'm talking about nothing for\nthe particular data type, all right?\n\n288\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.450\nIf a string is a sequence of characters,\nwhat's a nothing string?\n\n289\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.080\nWell there's no characters in it.\n\n290\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.710\nNo spaces, anything.\n\n291\n00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.230\nOkay, well,\nif it's a series of numbers, and\n\n292\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:52.890\nthis is where it gets a little iffy, if\nI'm taking the sum, the nothing is zero.\n\n293\n00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.630\nIf I'm trying to find something,\nthen nothing gets a little iffy, right?\n\n294\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.880\nI'm trying to find the maximum\nlike in a previous episode.\n\n295\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.400\nI have to assume nothing\ngets a little iffy there,\n\n296\n00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.060\ncuz we saw that zero\ndoesn't actually work.\n\n297\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.540\nSo this empty string, what happens is,\nis I can say, this empty string.\n\n298\n00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:19.030\nAnd then if I tack on to the end\nof it a P, then what do I get out?\n\n299\n00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:24.900\nI get just the P,\ncuz an empty string plus a P is just a P.\n\n300\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.290\nOkay, it's just like I had zero pens in\nthis hand and I have one in this hand.\n\n301\n00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.200\nIf I put them together,\nI still only have one.\n\n302\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.840\nThat's the crux of the issue,\n\n303\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.579\nwhich is actually not how your brain,\nit's not how you think you think.\n\n304\n00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.990\nIt's not always in\nthe forefront of your mind.\n\n305\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.930\nBut strings have an empty value and\nthat would be the empty string.\n\n306\n00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.550\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like it's just a given.\n\n307\n00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:53.820\nIt is because it is, which is such\na horrible way to explain something.\n\n308\n00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.480\nNot horrible, but you know it\ndoesn't really do anything for you.\n\n309\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:02.750\nBut cuz you're saying, this is a string,\nso it's going to be output as a string.\n\n310\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.884\nA string is a string,\nas a horse is a horse.\n\n311\n00:19:05.884 --> 00:19:06.388\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:19:06.388 --> 00:19:07.506\n&gt;&gt; A horse is a horse, of course,\n\n313\n00:19:07.506 --> 00:19:09.136\nof course.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n314\n00:19:09.136 --> 00:19:10.166\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar to that.\n\n315\n00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:11.316\nAnd what's interesting is that,\n\n316\n00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:14.220\nI don't want to get too deep.\nThere's actually a branch of mathematics\n\n317\n00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.400\nthat says, numbers and strings,\nas long as they have these properties,\n\n318\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.870\nactually behave at an abstract\nlevel very similarly.\n\n319\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.380\nIf you want to go dive deep on that,\nthat's great.\n\n320\n00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.090\nIt's not important.\n\n321\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.570\nYou just need to know,\nI have an empty thing.\n\n322\n00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.240\nAnd if I take that empty and\n\n323\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.810\nI add it to something else,\nI get that something else back, okay?\n\n324\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.840\nAnd by having that, I can start there and\ngo, okay just start.\n\n325\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.820\nYou can think of it as like an empty\nsatchel that you can just put stuff in.\n\n326\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.230\nOkay, and then you get back,\nnot the empty plus all the stuff,\n\n327\n00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.740\nyou just get back all the stuff.\n\n328\n00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.510\nSo if we can do that, and\n\n329\n00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.160\nwe can grab individual pieces, right,\ngrab the last one, bring it over.\n\n330\n00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.320\nGrab the last one, bring it over,\nthen that would fulfill.\n\n331\n00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:03.458\nBut just one last thing here, I'm\nthinking if we come back to this cheese.\n\n332\n00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:08.180\nIf this is a piece of paper,\nI could just cut it up.\n\n333\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.280\nBut sometimes cutting up\ncollections like this,\n\n334\n00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.180\nin a computer, is a little more difficult.\n\n335\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.000\nLike chopping it off, and keeping this\nover here, and keeping this over here.\n\n336\n00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.740\nI could do that, but, 4,\n\n337\n00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:31.960\n5 we could actually do something similar.\n\n338\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.660\nYou said something of this nature Vonne,\nwhere if I cut the last one off,\n\n339\n00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.830\nthat would like me going, use the 5 index.\n\n340\n00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.120\nHow did I find that?\n\n341\n00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.112\nWell, it's the length,\n\n342\n00:20:46.112 --> 00:20:52.280\nlength- 1, that's always the case.\n\n343\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.730\nIf I have six letters, the last\nindex is always one less than that.\n\n344\n00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.500\nWell, if I started there,\nthen I can go, well grab me this one.\n\n345\n00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.350\nOkay?\n\n346\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.970\nAnd then, now grab me this one,\nand then grab me this one,\n\n347\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:10.050\nand then grab this one,\nand then grab this one.\n\n348\n00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:15.760\nAll the while still bringing these\nindividual characters over and\n\n349\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.910\nkinda smashing them together.\n\n350\n00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.450\nYou know, Vonne, what do these little\ncircles at the bottom kinda look like?\n\n351\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.800\nWhat do they look like to you?\n\n352\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.120\nI see the deer in headlights.\n\n353\n00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.690\nYou're like wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n354\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:31.110\nMaybe our line of thinking is a little\nlost, but we talked before the episode.\n\n355\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.100\nYou're like,\ndoes this involve blah, blah, blah?\n\n356\n00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.710\nDo you remember?\n\n357\n00:21:34.798 --> 00:21:35.451\n&gt;&gt; What?\n[LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:21:35.451 --> 00:21:35.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\n\n359\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.400\n&gt;&gt; Like are what those look like and\n\n360\n00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.738\nI was thinking like I don't-\n&gt;&gt; Aren't those like loopty loops?\n\n361\n00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:45.258\n&gt;&gt; Loops.\n\n362\n00:21:45.258 --> 00:21:45.907\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n363\n00:21:45.907 --> 00:21:50.720\n[LAUGH] See sometimes we make\nthings a little difficult.\n\n364\n00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.971\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking the actual drawing\nof like, I was thinking like, Bingo.\n\n365\n00:21:53.971 --> 00:21:55.844\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like the little ping pong balls,\n\n366\n00:21:55.844 --> 00:21:57.010\nthe little letters.\n\n367\n00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.530\nThis is BO, and I was like,\nthat's what I was thinking, and\n\n368\n00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.920\nthen putting it in different places.\n\n369\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.720\nBut I think it was going a little\ntoo deep or off the rails.\n\n370\n00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's something that we tend to do.\n\n371\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.480\nDrawing helps us, but this is what happens\nwhen it's in my mind, and I'm like.\n\n372\n00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.660\nSorry, Vonne,\nI'll take the blame for that one.\n\n373\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.340\n&gt;&gt; But I was saying, everytime.\n\n374\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.270\nWell I was thinking that, cuz what\nI see on that drawing is length- 1.\n\n375\n00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.440\nOkay, well if it's six minus one,\nthat's five.\n\n376\n00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.519\nOkay, well now five minus one is four.\n\n377\n00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:28.464\nFour minus one is three.\n\n378\n00:22:28.464 --> 00:22:33.392\nCuz everytime that length changes\ncuz you've removed it, and so\n\n379\n00:22:33.392 --> 00:22:35.490\nit just keeps the loop.\n\n380\n00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.900\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\nYou're exactly correct.\n\n381\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.620\nAnd this is a first implementation.\n\n382\n00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.390\nNow, there's probably easier ways do\nthis and maybe we'll explore these.\n\n383\n00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.140\nBut you're right.\n\n384\n00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.450\nStart here and\n\n385\n00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:50.350\nthen loop down all the way back to zero\nwhere I grabbed the first one, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.840\nIf we can do that and we can create our\nlittle scratch pad where we get an e,\n\n387\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.410\nan s, an e, an e, an h, and a c.\n\n388\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.940\nThen we should be able to\nreverse the string and\n\n389\n00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.030\nI think that's a good plan of action.\n\n390\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.920\nThat at least may get\nus a working solution.\n\n391\n00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, Justin, that sounds good.\n\n392\n00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:16.070\nI was thinking about Bingo and cheese and\nloops, and I got a little turned around.\n\n393\n00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.420\nBut I did follow everything you said and\nit's a great way.\n\n394\n00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:25.200\nSometimes it's harder when\nyou slow it down that much.\n\n395\n00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.340\nIt kind of throws you for a little loop.\n\n396\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.290\n&gt;&gt; It does and what's interesting is,\n\n397\n00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:34.970\nsometimes, we all do this, when we are\ntrying to make it as simple as possible,\n\n398\n00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:38.020\nwe tend to make it way more complicated,\nthan it needs to be.\n\n399\n00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.820\nBut I totally get where\nyou're coming from.\n\n400\n00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.635\nI'm like those do look like\nlittle Bingo balls and\n\n401\n00:23:42.635 --> 00:23:45.590\nyeah, I guess I am taking over here and\nputting them on a.\n\n402\n00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.160\nSo I totally understand where\nthat thought came from.\n\n403\n00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.920\n&gt;&gt; I was overcomplicating it because I was\ntrying to think too far ahead of, well,\n\n404\n00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.400\nhow would you, in the programming language\nor the little knowledge I have of it.\n\n405\n00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.670\nAnd so this is a good exercise for\nme to really slow down and\n\n406\n00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.790\nto really look at it as\nalgorithmic problem solving.\n\n407\n00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.420\nSo thank you so much for that, but\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n408\n00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.340\nSigning off for DevPro TV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n409\n00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.117\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n410\n00:24:14.117 --> 00:24:15.997\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n411\n00:24:15.997 -->

I'm gonna try my best, Zach, and\n\n8\n00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:34.030\n[LAUGH] I will.\n\n9\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.143\nThere are times where I'm like, I'm gonna\ntry to make titles as long as possible.\n\n10\n00:00:37.143 --> 00:00:37.931\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:39.444\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna try to troll Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:44.960\nBut no, I'm trying to be descriptive,\nand what is a string, right?\n\n13\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.867\nWell you're like it's that stuff\nthat's in my shirt and my shoes and.\n\n14\n00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:49.937\nNo, no, no, that is technically a string,\n\n15\n00:00:49.937 --> 00:00:52.830\nbut we're talking about a string\ndatatype in Python, right?\n\n16\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.586\nIf I have the string abc,\nas we've seen in the planning episode,\n\n17\n00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:00.796\nthen I just need to be able to do cba,\nright?\n\n18\n00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:04.238\nSo we've already made a plan and\nwell, we may deviate,\n\n19\n00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:09.010\nwe may kinda play around, because our\nplan, it's not set in stone, right?\n\n20\n00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.200\nIt's just about understanding the problem\nspace so you can approach it, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.890\nSo even if you're writing\nan initial logarithm you may find\n\n22\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.395\nwait a minute there's\nan easier way to do that.\n\n23\n00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.080\nOr maybe there's a clear way or\nmaybe there's a faster way.\n\n24\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.700\nA lot of those considerations are\nsometimes told to you by another person.\n\n25\n00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.360\nSo maybe we'll see a couple here.\n\n26\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.016\nBut instead of talking about it,\nlet's actually do it.\n\n27\n00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:33.640\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here.\n\n28\n00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.860\nAnd we're inside this algorithm's folder.\n\n29\n00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.870\nWe've seen this before,\nwe've had find the maximum.\n\n30\n00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870\nAnd we're gonna make a well,\nlet's just call it what it is.\n\n31\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.590\nReversing, wait a minute, reversing-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.990\n&gt;&gt; The string, right?\n\n33\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.650\nAnd okay, we're good,\nwe're good and all right.\n\n34\n00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.340\nSo we got reversing the string, and\n\n35\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.580\nwe're gonna hop inside of there,\nand we're gonna make a main.py.\n\n36\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.170\nAnd that little flash,\nthat's not you getting like what was that?\n\n37\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.680\nI accidentally hit the tab key.\n\n38\n00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.750\nMy computer flashes when I hit the tab\nkey and there's nothing to do so.\n\n39\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.750\n&gt;&gt; Justin, I have a question for\n\n40\n00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.540\nyou before you get going any more.\n\n41\n00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.281\nSo if we're reversing the string,\ndoes that mean there's an inverse?\n\n42\n00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.147\n&gt;&gt; So if I understand correctly,\n\n43\n00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:22.317\nif I reverse it twice,\ndo I get the same string back?\n\n44\n00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:23.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n45\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.540\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely it should do that, right?\n\n46\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.610\nOtherwise, you have weird transformations.\n\n47\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.920\nYou should be able to go, all right,\nlet me reverse it, and reverse it.\n\n48\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.730\nSo it should be the same.\n\n49\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.985\nNow there are maybe times where let's\nsay you change all the lowercase.\n\n50\n00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:40.372\nTechnically they're not the same.\n\n51\n00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:42.719\nMaybe they're the same word but\nthey're not the same.\n\n52\n00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.599\nWe're gonna try to keep from messing\nwith things so in fact we do fulfill\n\n53\n00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.775\nthat property where reverse reverse\nis actually just the original string.\n\n54\n00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:51.291\n&gt;&gt; Ah-ha!\n\n55\n00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:52.917\n&gt;&gt; Okay so that would be an interesting\n\n56\n00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:56.828\ntest, that's actually an edge case that we\nmay have to test because that's part of-\n\n57\n00:02:56.828 --> 00:02:57.974\n&gt;&gt; And you like edge cases.\n\n58\n00:02:57.974 --> 00:02:58.980\n&gt;&gt; I do, I do.\n\n59\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.120\nSo we have this main.py, and\nlet's hop over to our other desktop, and\n\n60\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.710\nopen up Visual Studio Code, and all right,\nwell we're good to go, we're good to go.\n\n61\n00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.130\nAnd let's go open that folder.\n\n62\n00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.827\nOpen, and reversing stringing, there\nwe go, we're just gonna open that up.\n\n63\n00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:22.391\nAnd as always before I go to any endeavor,\nI'm gonna open my main.py,\n\n64\n00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:27.230\nsilence those little prompts at\nthe bottom and you know what?\n\n65\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.500\nLet's just say reverse_string\n\n66\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.210\nlike so and pass, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.681\nSo if __name__ -- __main__,\n\n68\n00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:45.368\nthen reverse_string, right?\n\n69\n00:03:45.368 --> 00:03:46.750\nNow we're actually gonna change this.\n\n70\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.785\nThis isn't, I'm just making sure\nthat I can call the function,\n\n71\n00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:52.719\nthat I have no syntax errors,\nthat my basic setup is good to go.\n\n72\n00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.750\nAll right, so I'm gonna hop over here.\n\n73\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.248\nAnd I'm gonna say python3 main,\nlooks good.\n\n74\n00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:06.789\nAll right, in the meantime I'm going to,\nCmd+B or Ctrl+B, individual studio code.\n\n75\n00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.560\nWe actually hide that sidebar, all right?\n\n76\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.200\nSo I'm just giving us a little\nmore real estate to work with and\n\n77\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.350\nyou're not imagining things.\n\n78\n00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.020\nAll right, before I write any code here I\nshould probably create maybe some tests,\n\n79\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.760\nsome things that I thought\nabout during my plan.\n\n80\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.190\nOkay, well let's see here.\n\n81\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.335\nI should assert that reverse_string('abc')\n\n82\n00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:36.377\n== wait for it, 'cba'.\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n83\n00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:38.750\n&gt;&gt; So flip it on it's edge.\n\n84\n00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.517\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n85\n00:04:39.517 --> 00:04:41.764\n&gt;&gt; And notice the reverse_string is gonna\n\n86\n00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:44.473\ntake a string and\nit's gonna return a string, so\n\n87\n00:04:44.473 --> 00:04:46.864\nin order to get that then,\nI need a string.\n\n88\n00:04:46.864 --> 00:04:49.150\nSo I'm just gonna say s, all right?\n\n89\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.969\nNow that's a single letter variable.\n\n90\n00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:56.466\nI mean, not the best always, but\nwe're gonna leave it there for now.\n\n91\n00:04:56.466 --> 00:05:01.660\nI can't use str, that's a reserved\nword in the Python, can't do that.\n\n92\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.235\nI could do string.\n\n93\n00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:07.500\nAnd we could always go back and\nchange that.\n\n94\n00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.640\nBut for now, I'm gonna leave s,\nand if something's very simple,\n\n95\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.414\nsometimes you can get away with that.\n\n96\n00:05:12.414 --> 00:05:14.003\nI wouldn't necessarily\napply that everywhere.\n\n97\n00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:17.910\nYou shouldn't have single letter\nvariables everywhere, all right.\n\n98\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.130\nSo we have our first test case.\n\n99\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.048\nLet's go over here, clear, python3 main.\n\n100\n00:05:24.048 --> 00:05:26.850\nIt's broken.\n&gt;&gt; Get you every time.\n\n101\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.798\nSo what's the easiest\nway to make this pass?\n\n102\n00:05:29.798 --> 00:05:30.830\nYou just return cba.\n\n103\n00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.986\nOkay, now that's not an algorithm\nwe talked about, right?\n\n104\n00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:36.961\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n105\n00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.667\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna make sure everything's\n\n106\n00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:41.250\njust so.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n107\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.530\n&gt;&gt; But now let's talk about our algorithm,\n\n108\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.471\nall right?\n\n109\n00:05:45.471 --> 00:05:49.491\nSo what I want to do is\nwhen I have the string,\n\n110\n00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:54.601\nI want to start with an empty string,\nmy accumulation,\n\n111\n00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:58.974\nmy container,\nwhere I put stuff in it, right?\n\n112\n00:05:58.974 --> 00:06:01.610\nAnd I want to start at the back end,\nright?\n\n113\n00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.340\nStart from the back and then go, we'll\nput that there, and then move over, and\n\n114\n00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.330\nthen put that there, and then move over.\n\n115\n00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.811\nIf I do that from back to front,\nwell the accumulation portion should be\n\n116\n00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:13.700\nthe reversed version.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n117\n00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.873\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what is my accumulation?\n\n118\n00:06:16.873 --> 00:06:19.431\nLet's just call it the result and\nit's the empty string.\n\n119\n00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.771\nIf I'm creating a string I'm\nstarting with an empty string,\n\n120\n00:06:22.771 --> 00:06:26.239\nwhich means there's a string that\nhas no space or anything, but\n\n121\n00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:29.310\nwhen I add to it,\nit'll give me string plus a string.\n\n122\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.830\nIt can concatenate those two together.\n\n123\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.690\nAnd then well, let's think about,\nif I were to do something like this,\n\n124\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.220\nfor char in s, for each character in s,\n\n125\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.800\nI would actually run in\nthe forward direction.\n\n126\n00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.250\nAll right, so that's not,\nI wanna start at the back and\n\n127\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.080\ngo through each character backwards.\n\n128\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.138\nAnd for each character backwards\nI want to add that to result,\n\n129\n00:06:58.138 --> 00:07:01.556\nall right, kinda push that on to the end.\n\n130\n00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:03.620\nSo how do I go in reverse?\n\n131\n00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.030\nWell if a for\nloop works strings are indexable, right?\n\n132\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.680\nAnd they have a zero based index.\n\n133\n00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.760\nSo if I could go to the end, and\nthen go backward by one, right,\n\n134\n00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.160\ndecrease by one, I should be able to\nrun backwards through the string.\n\n135\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:26.603\nAnd so I'm gonna say for index in\nrange and let's see here, how do I?\n\n136\n00:07:26.603 --> 00:07:27.670\nThis is where it gets tricky.\n\n137\n00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.910\nWhat's the beginning number?\n\n138\n00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.238\nWell it should be the last\nindex of the string, and\n\n139\n00:07:33.238 --> 00:07:36.815\nthat's the length of the string,- 1,\nall right?\n\n140\n00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:41.158\nSo we're gonna go to the very end and come\nback 1 because since I'm starting at 0,\n\n141\n00:07:41.158 --> 00:07:42.860\nit's always 1 less than that.\n\n142\n00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:48.640\nAnd then I want to run to,\nyou're like, I wanna run to 0,\n\n143\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.310\nexcept in a range, we actually\nhave to overrun that by 1 because\n\n144\n00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.440\nthis little section is non inclusive.\n\n145\n00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.840\nSo if I went to 0,\nit would go to 1 but not include 0.\n\n146\n00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.725\nI want to include 0, so I need to go\nto -1, so it doesn't include -1 but\n\n147\n00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:05.603\nit includes 0.\n\n148\n00:08:05.603 --> 00:08:08.652\nProgramming is sometimes a tricky thing,\nright?\n\n149\n00:08:08.652 --> 00:08:12.640\nAnd then if I do that,\nI have to tell it how to get there.\n\n150\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.143\nSo I have a start, stop, step.\n\n151\n00:08:15.143 --> 00:08:19.248\nI wanna go backwards by 1 okay?\n&gt;&gt; I like start, stop, step.\n\n152\n00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:19.926\n&gt;&gt; Yep, start, stop,\n\n153\n00:08:19.926 --> 00:08:21.888\nstep, and that's what those\nthree parameters are, start,\n\n154\n00:08:21.888 --> 00:08:22.609\nstop, step.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n155\n00:08:22.609 --> 00:08:23.838\n&gt;&gt; Where am I, where am I going and\n\n156\n00:08:23.838 --> 00:08:25.192\nhow am I getting there?\n&gt;&gt; Like it.\n\n157\n00:08:25.192 --> 00:08:27.663\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if I do that,\n\n158\n00:08:27.663 --> 00:08:33.797\nlet's just print(index) like so\nand zoom out, and 2, 1, 0.\n\n159\n00:08:33.797 --> 00:08:37.337\nWell a, b, c is three things.\n\n160\n00:08:37.337 --> 00:08:44.831\nIt is indexed as 0, 1, 2, but I did get\nthem in reverse order, that's good, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:48.780\nSo I come back over here.\n\n162\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.530\nHere we go, I'm gonna say char = s[index].\n\n163\n00:08:54.638 --> 00:08:59.433\nLet's print cuz I'm like you know what,\nI think that I'll go backwards, but\n\n164\n00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:03.152\nI'm gonna see how this plays out,\nmy search still failing.\n\n165\n00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:06.723\nAnd then clear, and wait for it, cba,\n\n166\n00:09:06.723 --> 00:09:12.160\nthat's actually the order that\nI need them in, all right?\n\n167\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.630\nI'm getting those as\nbackwards kind of traversal.\n\n168\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.625\nOkay, so now that I have that I\njust wanna say result += the char.\n\n169\n00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:26.746\nI'm getting the last char,\nI'm putting it onto the result, and\n\n170\n00:09:26.746 --> 00:09:30.281\nthis += in the context of strings\nwill say, what is the initial string?\n\n171\n00:09:30.281 --> 00:09:33.510\nTack it onto the end,\nthat's the new result, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:35.232 --> 00:09:37.980\nAnd then what if I go through all of that?\n\n173\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.257\nAre you ready Zach?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n174\n00:09:40.257 --> 00:09:42.712\n&gt;&gt; I think if I start with an empty and\n\n175\n00:09:42.712 --> 00:09:47.536\nI run backwards through it and\nI add all of the characters in a row,\n\n176\n00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:50.283\nI think that's actually it, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:50.283 --> 00:09:58.140\nSo based on kind of our picturing and our\nplanning, I think this will actually work.\n\n178\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.320\nWell, you know what,\nthere's only one way to find out and\n\n179\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.040\nthat's to run it with reckless abandon.\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n180\n00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.050\n&gt;&gt; No news is good news, right?\n\n181\n00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.300\nSo technically we have this.\n\n182\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:15.470\nBut our test case is very simple,\nright, very simple test case.\n\n183\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:20.190\nSo let's go add a few more test case,\nlet's think about,\n\n184\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:28.180\nokay we have this general idea, so\nassert and you know what, Zack,\n\n185\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.150\nlet me reveal something about myself.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n186\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.885\n&gt;&gt; I like cheese.\n\n187\n00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we all like cheese.\n\n188\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.932\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n189\n00:10:36.932 --> 00:10:42.130\neseehc space ekil space I.\n\n190\n00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.961\nAll right, now be careful when\nyou're writing this test.\n\n191\n00:10:43.961 --> 00:10:48.823\nIf you mess up on the equality comparison,\nthen you go, aw that's wrong and actually,\n\n192\n00:10:48.823 --> 00:10:49.493\nit's not.\n\n193\n00:10:49.493 --> 00:10:50.800\nYou typed something wrong.\n\n194\n00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.900\nSo if I read this backwards that\nshould be, I like cheese, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.275\nSo if I come back here and I run it and\nlook, no news is good news.\n\n196\n00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:01.427\nHey we're doing pretty good here.\n\n197\n00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.362\nAnd then well, let's add another one.\n\n198\n00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:07.906\nLet's just make it a little bit longer,\n\n199\n00:11:07.906 --> 00:11:14.860\nadd some more spaces so\nassert reverse_string(conquering\n\n200\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.932\nprograming like a boss).\n&gt;&gt; Like a boss.\n\n201\n00:11:18.932 --> 00:11:24.422\n&gt;&gt; LIke a boss and that is\n\n202\n00:11:24.422 --> 00:11:29.609\nssob a ekil ginmra.\n\n203\n00:11:29.609 --> 00:11:36.382\nNo wait a minute,\nwait a minute, argopr aw, man.\n\n204\n00:11:36.382 --> 00:11:39.150\nZach, you're supposed to be helping me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n205\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:44.235\n&gt;&gt; gnireuqnoc,\n\n206\n00:11:44.235 --> 00:11:48.474\nall right?\n\n207\n00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:50.322\nSome of you are like-\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n\n208\n00:11:50.322 --> 00:11:54.606\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, ssob a ekil, all right,\n\n209\n00:11:54.606 --> 00:11:56.680\nyou know what?\n\n210\n00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.524\nThat was hard to type.\n\n211\n00:11:57.524 --> 00:12:00.235\nThat was actually very hard.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I imagine it was.\n\n212\n00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:00.991\n&gt;&gt; That was very hard.\n\n213\n00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:02.400\nSo thing about reversing a string.\n\n214\n00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.090\nYou're like, that's easy.\n\n215\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.120\nYou just flip it.\n\n216\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.240\nYeah, that's cool.\n\n217\n00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.478\nTry to write something backwards,\nAll right?\n\n218\n00:12:07.478 --> 00:12:11.070\nTake words, try to write them backwards,\nyour brain goes okay I kind of get\n\n219\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.930\nthe concept but\nyou have to think one character at a time.\n\n220\n00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.380\nYou're moving from the backwards,\nthat is essentially the algorithm that we\n\n221\n00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.523\nimplemented.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\n\n222\n00:12:19.523 --> 00:12:24.275\nlet's see if we did it correctly and!\n\n223\n00:12:24.275 --> 00:12:29.953\nAnd, I have a funny feeling\nthat I typed something wrong.\n\n224\n00:12:29.953 --> 00:12:36.631\nSo let's go check it out.\n&gt;&gt; It would be the [NOISE].\n\n225\n00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:43.606\n&gt;&gt; Conquering programming like a boss.\n\n226\n00:12:43.606 --> 00:12:47.692\nAll right,\nnow here's a little live action debugging.\n\n227\n00:12:47.692 --> 00:12:48.890\nYou know what?\n\n228\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.861\nLet's do this,\nwhen in doubt, print it out.\n\n229\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.030\nLet's see, let's add this path, so,\n\n230\n00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.531\nConquering, you know what?\n\n231\n00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:09.387\nLet's grab this, copy it and\n\n232\n00:13:09.387 --> 00:13:15.174\njust temporarily let's paste this here.\n\n233\n00:13:15.174 --> 00:13:22.281\nAnd that looks, look at that.\n\n234\n00:13:24.984 --> 00:13:28.870\nHad the n and the i backwards.\n\n235\n00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.110\nSo sometimes your tests are informed here.\n\n236\n00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.422\nAll right, well, I feel pretty confident\nand a lot of times, something wrong always\n\n237\n00:13:36.422 --> 00:13:39.045\nsets those out cuz sometimes things\nwill just get out of hand there.\n\n238\n00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:42.280\nSo let's see if we have no\nnews is good news and we do.\n\n239\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:42.914\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n240\n00:13:42.914 --> 00:13:45.676\n&gt;&gt; All right now, one last thing, Zach,\n\n241\n00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:50.427\nyou actually gave me an edge\ncase that I hadn't thought of.\n\n242\n00:13:50.427 --> 00:13:51.864\n&gt;&gt; As far as putting them in here, right?\n\n243\n00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:54.334\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n244\n00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.624\n&gt;&gt; Assert\n\n245\n00:13:55.624 --> 00:14:04.808\nreverse_string(reverse_string('abc')) --\n\n246\n00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:08.965\nshould be abc.\n\n247\n00:14:08.965 --> 00:14:12.138\nSo if I call it on itself, all right,\nthe result, poom, there we go.\n\n248\n00:14:12.138 --> 00:14:13.810\nWe should get the same thing back.\n\n249\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.030\nLet's try it out.\n\n250\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.251\nNo news is good news.\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!\n\n251\n00:14:16.251 --> 00:14:19.010\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, now, we could stop here Zach.\n\n252\n00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.860\nWe have successfully implemented our\nalgorithm based on the test cases that we\n\n253\n00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.830\ncould think of, kind of our thought\nprocess, stating the problem.\n\n254\n00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.980\nWe've codified it.\n\n255\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.770\nBut if some of you are like well,\nI've been researching some Python.\n\n256\n00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:34.790\nIt's already built in.\n\n257\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:35.720\nTechnically it is.\n\n258\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.649\nBut if you do some things,\nyou may get unexpected result.\n\n259\n00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:46.026\nSo let's comment this out and create,\nnow all I did there is I highlight,\n\n260\n00:14:46.026 --> 00:14:51.343\nI held command that is a forward slash,\nthe one under the question mark.\n\n261\n00:14:51.343 --> 00:14:53.820\nWhen it's a Linux machine,\nit's control forward slash.\n\n262\n00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.350\nSo that will comment\nout large blocks there.\n\n263\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.480\nSo I want to reverse string.\n\n264\n00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.990\nPow just like that.\n\n265\n00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.050\nYou ready?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n266\n00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:03.993\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n267\n00:15:03.993 --> 00:15:08.301\nI could use some Python stuff\nto get equivalent ones.\n\n268\n00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:11.650\nSo I'm starting with an empty string,\njust like I did here.\n\n269\n00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:17.669\nAnd then I'm joining together,\nwhich is this part, c for c in,\n\n270\n00:15:20.893 --> 00:15:25.040\nGive me the string going back,\nthe entire string going backwards.\n\n271\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.820\nThis is effectively the reverse, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.890\nIn Python, this entire function could\nbe summed to this little bit, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.680\nLet's go see if I'm lying.\n\n274\n00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.082\nNo news is good news.\n\n275\n00:15:38.082 --> 00:15:43.921\nAnd what's really crazy is,\nI could go even further and\n\n276\n00:15:43.921 --> 00:15:51.761\nsay instead of, creating this little\niterable here, right, c for c in s.\n\n277\n00:15:51.761 --> 00:15:58.170\nTechnically Python has something that\nwill do that for you as well reversed.\n\n278\n00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.288\nEmpty string joined together\nthe reversed portions of s.\n\n279\n00:16:06.288 --> 00:16:07.649\nOkay let's see if it works.\n\n280\n00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:09.220\nBoom no news is good news.\n\n281\n00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.610\nAll right now what will happen is\nwhen you starting writing code and\n\n282\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.089\nyou're thinking about solving a problem.\n\n283\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:20.131\nThis is probably what you're gonna end up\nwith, what we have commented out here.\n\n284\n00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:22.610\nLong term,\nyou're like I learned some new things.\n\n285\n00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.100\nWhich is faster, which is more readable?\n\n286\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.890\nIf I come here,\nthere's a lot that I have to do.\n\n287\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.040\nThis is a little more declarative.\n\n288\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.440\nJoin together with the empty string\nthe reversed portion of a string.\n\n289\n00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.833\nIt's a little easier to read,\nhere I go okay,\n\n290\n00:16:37.833 --> 00:16:42.540\nI have an empty string and\nthen I run through, what is this mean?\n\n291\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.028\nI have to think about that and\nthen if I come back,\n\n292\n00:16:45.028 --> 00:16:48.499\nis it perfectly okay to have code\nlike this, that solves a problem?\n\n293\n00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:53.990\nBut you may come later on and change\nit over to something like this, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.774\nSo there is not always one particular\nsolution to any given problem and\n\n295\n00:16:57.774 --> 00:16:59.837\nsometimes it's language specific.\n\n296\n00:16:59.837 --> 00:17:01.800\nWe're using Python so these are available.\n\n297\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.954\nIf you're joining us in our journey\nyou will be using Python as well.\n\n298\n00:17:06.954 --> 00:17:12.129\nBut eventually you may adopt a different\nlanguage that do not have these utilities\n\n299\n00:17:12.129 --> 00:17:17.086\nand well, this algorithm is movable to\na variety of different environments.\n\n300\n00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:22.250\nBut technically we have achieved our goal.\n\n301\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:27.250\nOne last thing, though,\nassert reverse_string\n\n302\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.430\nof the empty string should give me the\nempty string, I should get nothing back.\n\n303\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.859\nYou should always, empty to empty, right?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n304\n00:17:33.859 --> 00:17:35.290\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if it works.\n\n305\n00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:39.950\nAnd it in fact does, so\nthere was another edge case, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.980\nDoes our original algorithm work?\n\n307\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.490\nWell comment that out,\nuncomment that, and I run it.\n\n308\n00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:52.540\nBoom, it still works,\nthat is a fairly robust solution.\n\n309\n00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:58.880\nAssuming that these are the outputs that\nyou expect and just by thinking through,\n\n310\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.250\nstating the problem, drawing some\npictures, and then coming here and\n\n311\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.960\ncodifying it to try to solidify that\nthinking, we have a workable algorithm.\n\n312\n00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.230\nVery simple, but as a building block,\nthis pattern of looping through and\n\n313\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.050\nkind of accumulating is very prominent\nin a bunch of other problems.\n\n314\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.580\nSo as you start to see these patterns,\n\n315\n00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.590\nother issues that would crop up normally\nstart to become a little bit clear and\n\n316\n00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:24.420\nthey just become easier.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff, Justin, well done.\n\n317\n00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.500\nReversing a String Coding,\nthe title of this episode.\n\n318\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.937\nAnd before we leave you and say bye bye,\nand come back another time,\n\n319\n00:18:30.937 --> 00:18:35.549\nwhat else would you like to say?\n&gt;&gt; Well, one final thing, small steps,\n\n320\n00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:40.500\nsmall pieces and always think about,\nI have something working.\n\n321\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.630\nAnd then, only then when it works,\nwhen you know that it\n\n322\n00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:50.370\ndoes exactly what it's supposed to, then\ndo you worry about making it better, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:54.097\nAs long as you're getting better every\nday, incrementally getting better,\n\n324\n00:18:54.097 --> 00:18:56.646\nthen over the long haul\neverything'll be all right.\n\n325\n00:18:56.646 --> 00:18:58.460\nSo don't be too hard on yourself.\n\n326\n00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.820\nIf you're like, this is kinda ugly, or\nthis isn't as fast as I would like to,\n\n327\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.317\nwhatever it may be, get it working.\n\n328\n00:19:03.317 --> 00:19:04.600\nThat's the most important part.\n\n329\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.373\nAnd if you don't believe me,\nthen think about would you rather not be\n\n330\n00:19:09.373 --> 00:19:14.225\nable to get to work or to school or\nto wherever because you have a Ferrari\n\n331\n00:19:14.225 --> 00:19:16.850\nwithout an engine.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n332\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.782\n&gt;&gt; Or would you rather go hop out into\n\n333\n00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:22.232\na Geo Metro that has started on\nthe first try, every time and\n\n334\n00:19:22.232 --> 00:19:24.230\nreliably gotten you to work.\n\n335\n00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.110\nJust think about that,\nthat's all I'm saying.\n\n336\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.304\n&gt;&gt; Well said, great advice.\n\n337\n00:19:27.304 --> 00:19:30.510\nAlgorithmic Problem Solving\nis a wonderful series.\n\n338\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.640\nMake sure you watch every single episode\ntoo because you'll be glad you did.\n\n339\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.040\nAnd you'll be in the course library\nwhere there's thousands of other videos\n\n340\n00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.190\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n341\n00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.580\nSo check those out as well.\n\n342\n00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.576\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about DevProTV,\n\n343\n00:19:42.576 --> 00:19:44.108\na good dev pro is always learning.\n\n344\n00:19:44.108 --> 00:19:46.730\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt;

DevProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.069\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:21.875\nwe're moving through our\nalgorithmic problem solving series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.850\nAnd we're going to be\ndetecting some palindromes.\n\n6\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.810\nAnd here is the person who made me\nsay all those really big words, Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.640\nJustin Dennison, how you doing today?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.230\nEspecially since my maniacal\nscheme came together.\n\n9\n00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.040\nAnd how you are, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n10\n00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.560\nI'm pretty proud of myself for\ngetting all those big words out and\n\n11\n00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.801\nnot tripping over them too terribly bad.\n\n12\n00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:45.447\nAnd so if I'm not mistaken,\na palindrome is something\n\n13\n00:00:45.447 --> 00:00:50.000\nthat is spelled the same way backwards and\nforwards.\n\n14\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.951\nAnd we were having fun remembering\nsome of them before this episode.\n\n15\n00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:55.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You got it absolutely correct.\n\n16\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.640\nA palindrome, you can think of\nsomething as simple as the name, Bob,\n\n17\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.201\nassuming that lower case and\nupper case, right?\n\n18\n00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.978\nEverything is lowercase,\nthat's our assumption here B-O-B.\n\n19\n00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:06.860\nWell, backwards is B-O-B as well.\n\n20\n00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.350\nNow, we had some fun.\n\n21\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.604\nThis is gonna set the scene.\n\n22\n00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.020\nTaco cat.\n\n23\n00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.539\nT-A-C-O C-A-T.\n\n24\n00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.205\nT-A-C-O C-A-T.\n\n25\n00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:19.010\nRats live on no evil star.\n\n26\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.542\nYeah, that's a long one,\nbut if you get forwards and\n\n27\n00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:24.470\nbackwards excluding punctuation and\nthings of that nature,\n\n28\n00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.157\nthen that is technically a palindrome.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you said that, I'm like, they do,\n\n29\n00:01:29.157 --> 00:01:30.830\nwhat?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n30\n00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.670\n&gt;&gt; Wait, I had to\n\n31\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.430\nreally think about it cuz there was a lot.\n\n32\n00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.140\nIt was a long one.\n\n33\n00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.940\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat is a long one, and just so\n\n34\n00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.020\nwe're clear, there's nothing that\nlives on stars as far as we know.\n\n35\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.710\nJust because of, well, all the radiation\nand horrible gravitational forces.\n\n36\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.570\nBut our goal is to see if we\ncan determine whether a word or\n\n37\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.920\na phrase is a palindrome.\n\n38\n00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.811\nNow, as I've already said we have\nan assumption there, that there's no\n\n39\n00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:59.974\npunctuation, because that would be\n[SOUND] and that everything is lowercase.\n\n40\n00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:01.338\nAnd then just makes it easy, right?\n\n41\n00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:03.582\nI've already reduced the problem, but\n\n42\n00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:06.430\nit would take a little more\nif you wanted to do that.\n\n43\n00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.865\nBut if you think about some previous\nepisodes, we kinda have some skills that\n\n44\n00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:14.810\nwe've built up through our problem\nsolving that would serve us.\n\n45\n00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.507\nWell, what if it had capital letters?\n\n46\n00:02:16.507 --> 00:02:19.220\nWell, just make them all lowercase, right?\n\n47\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.680\nRemove all punctuation.\n\n48\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.380\nAnd then we're back to where we are.\n\n49\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.740\nSo we could do those same things\nif our requirements stood for it.\n\n50\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.466\nAnd it's funny because,\n\n51\n00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:34.026\nI said something about the reverse\nof the string, right backwards.\n\n52\n00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:37.920\nAnd Vonne was like, hold on a second,\nhaven't we already done that?\n\n53\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.742\nAnd did you not say that Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n54\n00:02:40.742 --> 00:02:43.370\nI had to go back in the notes I'm like,\nwait, I'm sorry.\n\n55\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.920\nI thought we did the reverse string or\nwhere we were taking each letter and\n\n56\n00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.550\nmoving them around and, yeah.\n\n57\n00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.790\nThe lower and going ins and outs.\n\n58\n00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.955\nWe had all these arrows and everything and\nso I'm slightly confused right now.\n\n59\n00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:56.694\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm gonna show you the\n\n60\n00:02:56.694 --> 00:02:58.990\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna explore right?\n\n61\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.940\nBut my goal is to show you a slightly\ndifferent way of thinking about this.\n\n62\n00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.781\nBut in all honesty,\nif you can reverse a string,\n\n63\n00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:09.565\nyou already know if\nsomething is a palindrome.\n\n64\n00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:14.170\nCuz you take from a previous episode,\nthat reverse function, right?\n\n65\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.490\nAnd you take whatever the string is,\nyou reverse it and\n\n66\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.860\nthen you say are these two things equal?\n\n67\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.670\nAnd it goes letter by letter and it\ncompares them, but it's abstracted away.\n\n68\n00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.350\nReally what's going on behind the scenes.\n\n69\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.552\nHow would we do this if we\ndidn't already have that, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:27.552 --> 00:03:32.360\nSo that's something to think about.\n&gt;&gt; So is this maybe a different\n\n71\n00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.050\nmethod of getting to almost the same\nresult with just a little tacked onto it?\n\n72\n00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.132\n&gt;&gt; So it's the exact same result.\n\n73\n00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:41.833\nThere's gonna be a lot\nmore tacked onto it.\n\n74\n00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:46.640\n[LAUGH] Vonne was like, I was hoping\nthat it wasn't as complicated.\n\n75\n00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.260\nAnd the reason being is what\nif you don't have that?\n\n76\n00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.820\nWhat if you're working\non a different language?\n\n77\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.090\nWhat if this is all you want to do and\nyou had this very specific use case?\n\n78\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.190\nYou need to know a little different way,\nright?\n\n79\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.724\nAlso, this is a way of comparing\ntwo collections, right?\n\n80\n00:04:02.724 --> 00:04:04.584\nWe're talking about strings, but\n\n81\n00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:08.250\nthis applies to other collection\ntypes that are ordered.\n\n82\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.510\nAnd you'll see what I mean.\n\n83\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.570\nBut you know what Vonne?\n\n84\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.045\nI've been talking in\ngeneralities a great deal.\n\n85\n00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:15.750\nI almost had trouble saying\nthe word generalities there.\n\n86\n00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.470\nI say we start as we always\ndo with drawing a picture,\n\n87\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.230\nkind of visualizing what we hope to do.\n\n88\n00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.510\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here.\n\n89\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.120\nAnd detect palindromes.\n\n90\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.214\nI could start with a rats\nlive on no evil star.\n\n91\n00:04:30.214 --> 00:04:32.790\nI could start with taco cat.\n\n92\n00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.750\nI'm probably gonna start with Bob just\nto start as a simple, let me draw,\n\n93\n00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.840\nlet me thing about this,\njust to get my bearings so to speak.\n\n94\n00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.839\n&gt;&gt; I was hoping we weren't gonna so\n\n95\n00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.162\nthe rats and stars things.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:04:44.162 --> 00:04:44.987\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, okay, wait,\n\n97\n00:04:44.987 --> 00:04:45.972\nthis is just gonna be too much.\n\n98\n00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:48.233\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would have been way too much.\n\n99\n00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:53.295\nAnd hopefully by looking at simpler cases\nand kind of developing our mental model\n\n100\n00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:59.340\nthrough drawing, then we go, well,\nI think this will work regardless, right?\n\n101\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.360\nSo let's start with Bob.\n\n102\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.231\nSo we got Bob, right?\n\n103\n00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:09.445\nAnd how,\nif I'm thinking of this as a string,\n\n104\n00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:15.828\nthen I go 0, 1, 2, right?\n&gt;&gt; If I think about it, if I were to label\n\n105\n00:05:15.828 --> 00:05:20.596\nthese backwards, 0, 1, 2, because I'm just\ncounting like a computer would count.\n\n106\n00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:23.400\nSo I'm trying to take\na mindset of a computer.\n\n107\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.070\nI'll notice that the zeros match,\n\n108\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.605\nthe ones match, and the twos match, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:31.605 --> 00:05:38.184\nNow, put another way, I'm thinking,\nwell, I can't re-number how letters are.\n\n110\n00:05:38.184 --> 00:05:39.848\nSo what if I did something like this.\n\n111\n00:05:39.848 --> 00:05:46.350\nSo what if I stay with bob, and just as\na reminder, I forgot, we are drawing.\n\n112\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.328\nWhat if I had bob,\nthen had bob again, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:51.328 --> 00:05:57.620\nSo the question is,\nare these the same bob or a different bob?\n\n114\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.377\nLet's assume that,\nI'm gonna write this in green,\n\n115\n00:06:04.377 --> 00:06:07.706\nthis is a separate bob, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:07.706 --> 00:06:12.140\nAnd now Vonne is giving me this\nweird look like, theres two bobs?\n\n117\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.332\nTwo different strings and\nhere's what I'm gonna do.\n\n118\n00:06:15.332 --> 00:06:20.910\nActually, let me change this a little\nbit I'm gonna change this to red, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.460\nAnd what I'm gonna do effectively\nI'm mapping this one to this one,\n\n120\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.526\nthis one to this one, and\nthis one to this one.\n\n121\n00:06:28.526 --> 00:06:31.700\nOkay, so I'm mapping between the letters.\n\n122\n00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.351\nSo I wanna compare the first and\nthe last, and well,\n\n123\n00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:41.660\nin this case, the middle, and\nthen the last and the first.\n\n124\n00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.770\nOkay, now that gets a little weird.\n\n125\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.167\nLet's try your taco cat, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:55.977\nSo let's go a little bit differently,\ntaco space cat.\n\n127\n00:06:55.977 --> 00:07:00.271\nInterestingly enough, hm,\n\n128\n00:07:00.271 --> 00:07:04.056\nthat space, that space.\n\n129\n00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:07.215\nHow is that,\nthis is why I reverse the string,\n\n130\n00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:11.508\nyou could get away with it,\nyou may have some edge cases right?\n\n131\n00:07:11.508 --> 00:07:16.198\nA little added extra,\nyou'll see what I mean, but taco,\n\n132\n00:07:16.198 --> 00:07:19.475\nI'm gonna write it again, so taco cat.\n\n133\n00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:22.917\nAll right, so now if I go,\nand let's go with green,\n\n134\n00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:26.140\nI'll take the first and\nI compare it to the last.\n\n135\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.330\nAre these the same?\n\n136\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:33.740\nYeah, this goes here,\nthis goes here, uh-oh.\n\n137\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.420\nO goes there.\n\n138\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.313\nSo now we got kind of a weirdness here,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:38.313 --> 00:07:38.941\n&gt;&gt; Justin,\n\n140\n00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:42.549\nas soon as you got past like the A,\nI was like, wait,\n\n141\n00:07:42.549 --> 00:07:46.409\nthat space is gonna mess some\nstuff up in here, isn't it?\n\n142\n00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:47.572\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what,\n\n143\n00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:50.390\nnothing will ruin your day than\nunanticipated space, right?\n\n144\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.280\nWhether it's the end, the beginning, or\n\n145\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.100\nright in the middle when you\ntrying to figure out a palindrome.\n\n146\n00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.163\nYou're exactly correct.\n\n147\n00:07:57.163 --> 00:08:02.373\nSpaces kinda mess this up, but you know\nwhat, that's why we're drawing, right?\n\n148\n00:08:02.373 --> 00:08:05.907\nWe're going, yeah,\nsomething I didn't think of.\n\n149\n00:08:05.907 --> 00:08:09.317\nWe're in a little bit of\na discovery phase, but\n\n150\n00:08:09.317 --> 00:08:14.700\nthis could have come up to have what's\nnext, right, how I handle spaces.\n\n151\n00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.438\nSo we're gonna hold off on that.\n&gt;&gt; I almost wanna hold off on the question\n\n152\n00:08:18.438 --> 00:08:19.547\nI wanna ask you.\n\n153\n00:08:19.547 --> 00:08:23.979\nBut are we going to,\ncan you remove spaces?\n\n154\n00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:29.004\nCan you say detect all non-breaking\nspaces, white whatever we will call it,\n\n155\n00:08:29.004 --> 00:08:32.290\ncan you just say take out a space?\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\n\n156\n00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.678\nyes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n157\n00:08:33.678 --> 00:08:35.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We sure can.\n\n158\n00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.080\nBut let's go ahead and finish our\ndrawing just to get an idea here, but\n\n159\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.200\nkeep that thought.\n\n160\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.050\nNothing wrong with that question,\ngreat question.\n\n161\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.952\nThat's how you should be thinking,\nbut if we go here, well, that's broke,\n\n162\n00:08:46.952 --> 00:08:51.557\nwhich means that if we follow our same\npattern as soon as we hit a space, for\n\n163\n00:08:51.557 --> 00:08:54.260\nevery space we hit we're gonna be one off.\n\n164\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.134\nWell, that's a problem.\n\n165\n00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:58.626\nNow it wasn't a problem with bob,\ncuz bob didn't have a space in it.\n\n166\n00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:01.329\nThe taco cat does.\n&gt;&gt; And that would be really bad for\n\n167\n00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:04.615\nyour evil rats and everything.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, rats live on new stars.\n\n168\n00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:06.149\nI'm not gonna write that out,\n\n169\n00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:08.926\ncuz you don't wanna watch me\nwrite that out on the iPad.\n\n170\n00:09:08.926 --> 00:09:13.751\nBut okay,\nI think I have a pretty good idea here,\n\n171\n00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:18.226\nbecause regardless of\nthe space messing up,\n\n172\n00:09:18.226 --> 00:09:22.599\nif I go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n173\n00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:27.882\nAnd then 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n174\n00:09:27.882 --> 00:09:31.470\nAnd notice in my drawing I'm\nkind of already utilizing some\n\n175\n00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.561\nof the things that I know, right?\n\n176\n00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:38.537\nSo if I do this, and go,\nwell, 0 goes to 7, right?\n\n177\n00:09:38.537 --> 00:09:39.724\nThat's my last index.\n\n178\n00:09:39.724 --> 00:09:42.641\n1 is to 6.\n\n179\n00:09:44.068 --> 00:09:46.925\n2 is to 5.\n\n180\n00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:48.060\nOkay.\n\n181\n00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.621\n3 is to 4, but that gets weird.\n\n182\n00:09:53.621 --> 00:09:57.340\nBut if we look at just cat, 0, 7, 1,\n6, 2, 5, those are all the sum of 7.\n\n183\n00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:05.055\n0 plus 7 is 7, 1 plus 6 is 7,\n2 plus 5 is 7.\n\n184\n00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:08.080\n7 happens to be our last index.\n\n185\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.130\nThere's a relationship there that\nI can make use of, all right?\n\n186\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.940\nSo let's go ahead and kinda get\nout of here just for a little bit,\n\n187\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.051\nbecause Vonne is,\nI wish you could see Vonne's face.\n\n188\n00:10:21.051 --> 00:10:22.350\nShe's like, hold on a second.\n\n189\n00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.345\nJust thinking we're, no, hold on.\n\n190\n00:10:24.345 --> 00:10:25.507\nBut it's all right.\n\n191\n00:10:25.507 --> 00:10:27.564\nSo what do I know?\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what's going on through\n\n192\n00:10:27.564 --> 00:10:28.632\nmy mind right now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:10:28.632 --> 00:10:30.332\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna hold back.\n\n194\n00:10:30.332 --> 00:10:32.864\nAnd just watch, cuz it's, yeah.\n\n195\n00:10:32.864 --> 00:10:38.144\nIn and out of got it, nope.\n&gt;&gt; So as with always, we need to make sure\n\n196\n00:10:38.144 --> 00:10:44.081\nwe know, we've kind of already utilized\nthis, strings are sequence of characters.\n\n197\n00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:47.502\nSequence of, that period's way off there.\n\n198\n00:10:47.502 --> 00:10:49.328\nCharacters.\n\n199\n00:10:49.328 --> 00:10:53.092\nThey are zero indexed.\n\n200\n00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:56.630\nRight, we start counting at zero.\n\n201\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.237\nThe last index,\nwe've seen this a couple of times,\n\n202\n00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:10.030\nIs the length, Minus 1, right,\nthat's always true for this collections.\n\n203\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.210\nSo that means that Taco Cat is eight\ncharacters long, the last index is seven.\n\n204\n00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.962\nBob, is three characters long,\nthe last index is two.\n\n205\n00:11:16.962 --> 00:11:22.113\nWell we have some behaviors,\n\n206\n00:11:22.113 --> 00:11:28.913\nso we can find, we can get substrings,\n\n207\n00:11:28.913 --> 00:11:34.270\nwe can kind of get a character,\n\n208\n00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.822\nget a character, right?\n\n209\n00:11:38.822 --> 00:11:40.410\nSo that technically is a substring.\n\n210\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.270\nYou get a single character.\n\n211\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.040\nIt's like a substring.\n\n212\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.000\nAnd, well, we have some properties.\n\n213\n00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.810\nIntrinsic properties.\n\n214\n00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:55.281\nAnd one we care about is the length,\nright?\n\n215\n00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:58.580\nThat was kinda given away by this, right?\n\n216\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.360\nThe only way we can utilize\nthat is if that exists.\n\n217\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.857\nSo what's next?\n\n218\n00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:10.940\nWell, we discovered through\nour drawing of what we know.\n\n219\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.130\nHow do we handle spaces?\n\n220\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.510\nSpaces kind of wreck the day, right?\n\n221\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:25.288\nHow do we match characters\n\n222\n00:12:25.288 --> 00:12:29.546\nfront to back?\n\n223\n00:12:29.546 --> 00:12:30.046\nOkay, front to back.\n\n224\n00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.925\nSo what I mean is two goes to,\nwell, excuse me,\n\n225\n00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:44.199\nt which is 0 goes to 7 which is t also.\n\n226\n00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:46.190\nI'm matching front to back.\n\n227\n00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.150\nI'm kind of doing this weird\nswitch zip shenanigans.\n\n228\n00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:58.371\nSo if I can handle spaces how do\nI match characters front to back.\n\n229\n00:12:58.371 --> 00:13:01.448\nOkay, well, I think we need to come\nback to drawing just a little bit more.\n\n230\n00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:10.146\nSo spaces, let's handle some\ndrawing kind of a thought process.\n\n231\n00:13:10.146 --> 00:13:12.303\nSo let's say I have taco cat.\n\n232\n00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:18.528\nRight, and they're in quotes.\n\n233\n00:13:18.528 --> 00:13:21.217\nSo here's a space.\n\n234\n00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:24.847\nWell, we already know the spaces\nkinda mess things up.\n\n235\n00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.576\nSo what's our first course of action?\n\n236\n00:13:30.305 --> 00:13:38.739\nWell, we want to remove Spaces.\n\n237\n00:13:38.739 --> 00:13:41.346\nSo that's kinda my thought process.\n\n238\n00:13:41.346 --> 00:13:44.382\nSo if I remove spaces,\nwell, what do I have now?\n\n239\n00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:54.084\nI have tacocat, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:59.217\nTacocat, so, now look at this, well,\nI can see from my inspection that,\n\n241\n00:13:59.217 --> 00:14:01.999\nhey forwards and backwards that works.\n\n242\n00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:07.548\nAnd I know that t matched to t,\na will match to a, c will match to c.\n\n243\n00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:10.908\nIt's where the space was\nthings started getting tricky.\n\n244\n00:14:10.908 --> 00:14:18.388\nAll right, so, now, what's next?\n\n245\n00:14:18.388 --> 00:14:23.220\nWell, for this, hm, I don't think\nit can be summed up in a box.\n\n246\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.230\nJust to be really clear, I think we\nnow go back to what we had before.\n\n247\n00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.480\nTacocat, notice no space.\n\n248\n00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.270\nTacocat.\n\n249\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:41.000\nAll right, and then 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n250\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.550\nNotice that removing a space\nactually changes the last index and\n\n251\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.400\nthe length, right?\n\n252\n00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.820\nThey're related.\n\n253\n00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.170\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n254\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.670\nSo we now start our\nmatching process again.\n\n255\n00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.940\nOkay, there goes A and\nthen C goes to C, O goes to O.\n\n256\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.920\nC goes to C, A goes to A,\nand then T goes to T.\n\n257\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:12.428\nWell, 0 matches with 6,\n1 matches with 5, 2 matches with 4,\n\n258\n00:15:12.428 --> 00:15:17.310\n3 with 3, 4 with 2,\n5 with 1, and 6 with 0.\n\n259\n00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:26.182\nSo as I'm counting up here,\nI'm counting down here.\n\n260\n00:15:26.182 --> 00:15:30.099\nSo if I had two copies, right?\n\n261\n00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:33.118\nIf I had two copies,\nthen I could go, okay, well,\n\n262\n00:15:33.118 --> 00:15:38.430\nI want to start at the beginning of this\none and at the end of this one, right?\n\n263\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:43.480\nAnd go, do these match,\ndo these match, do these match?\n\n264\n00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.890\nSo [COUGH] that's if I have two copies.\n\n265\n00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.045\nSo what's our next after removing spaces?\n\n266\n00:15:49.045 --> 00:15:54.009\nWell, let's kind of come out\n\n267\n00:15:54.009 --> 00:15:58.980\nto the side about make a copy.\n\n268\n00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.826\nOkay, and then we get a copy, right, and\n\n269\n00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:09.310\nyou could do this a bunch\nof different ways.\n\n270\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.072\nThis is just my thought\nprocess of how this works out.\n\n271\n00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:13.687\nSo once I make a copy.\n\n272\n00:16:18.318 --> 00:16:23.288\nStart at the first letter.\n\n273\n00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:30.104\nRight?\n\n274\n00:16:30.104 --> 00:16:35.550\nAlso, and let me just clarify,\nof one copy.\n\n275\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.510\nThat box didn't quite contain\nall I needed to write.\n\n276\n00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:45.839\nAnd then, start at the last\n\n277\n00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:50.937\nletter of the other copy,\n\n278\n00:16:50.937 --> 00:16:59.290\nI didn't learn my lesson on that last box.\n\n279\n00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.954\nAll right, so if I do that, if I start\nat the first letter of the one copy,\n\n280\n00:17:02.954 --> 00:17:05.680\nstart at the last letter\nof the other copy.\n\n281\n00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.640\nIf I have these two pieces,\nnow I kind of have these little branches.\n\n282\n00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.923\nThat doesn't necessarily mean\nthat my program's gonna fork off,\n\n283\n00:17:11.923 --> 00:17:14.238\ncuz it's a non strict\ndiagramming structure.\n\n284\n00:17:14.238 --> 00:17:18.331\nBut if I have these two things,\nI can come back together, and\n\n285\n00:17:18.331 --> 00:17:21.432\nthen what do I do?\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna compare to see if they're\n\n286\n00:17:21.432 --> 00:17:21.935\nthe same.\n\n287\n00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:26.700\nBecause as soon as,\nnow I got it halfway through, I was like,\n\n288\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.809\nexactly, start here at the first copy,\nstart here at the second copy,\n\n289\n00:17:31.809 --> 00:17:34.077\nand they should match.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n290\n00:17:34.077 --> 00:17:35.285\n&gt;&gt; They match, you got it.\n\n291\n00:17:35.285 --> 00:17:37.165\n&gt;&gt; So now we compare letters, but\n\n292\n00:17:37.165 --> 00:17:41.009\nwe have a decision to make cuz\nwhen we compare letters, right?\n\n293\n00:17:41.009 --> 00:17:44.790\nT equal to T, or is T, T?\n\n294\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:52.980\nRight, yeah, so if they are, right,\nif they're equal, then we come over here.\n\n295\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.480\nIf they're not equal,\nthen we come over here.\n\n296\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.200\nLet's handle the not equal.\n\n297\n00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.790\nif I compare the first and the last and\nthey're not equal, what does that mean?\n\n298\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.510\nAre they a palindrome?\n\n299\n00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.942\nNo, they can't be,\nbecause the letters don't match.\n\n300\n00:18:07.942 --> 00:18:09.066\nAll the letters have to match.\n\n301\n00:18:09.066 --> 00:18:14.397\nSo, no.\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like,\n\n302\n00:18:14.397 --> 00:18:19.730\nas soon as you get to at any point\nit not matching, it's we're done.\n\n303\n00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.888\nLike it stops the, the,\nthe kind of analyzing.\n\n304\n00:18:22.888 --> 00:18:25.989\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and that's the trick here.\n\n305\n00:18:25.989 --> 00:18:29.080\nThat's why I wanted to kind\nof explore this option.\n\n306\n00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.270\nSo let me just scroll up here\nlittle bit and move this over.\n\n307\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.280\nSo once we compare the letters,\n\n308\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.950\nas soon as we find a letter\nthat doesn't match, right?\n\n309\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:36.980\nIf it's the first and the last.\n\n310\n00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.630\nIf they don't match it's not a palindrome.\n\n311\n00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.690\nSo is it a palindrome?\n\n312\n00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.830\nNope, it's not.\n\n313\n00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.540\nNow, what if they are?\n\n314\n00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.844\nWell if they are, then what do I do?\n\n315\n00:18:45.844 --> 00:18:53.030\nI, Move along.\n\n316\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.740\nNow, what do I mean by move along?\n\n317\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.240\nWell let's zoom out just a little bit.\n\n318\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.289\nEffectively, I'm going\nto hop back up here, and\n\n319\n00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:07.109\nno longer is it the first letter but\nthe second.\n\n320\n00:19:07.109 --> 00:19:10.322\n&gt;&gt; It's basically the drawing you have\n\n321\n00:19:10.322 --> 00:19:14.890\nup there with the green and\nthe, what is that color?\n\n322\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.160\nRed.\n&gt;&gt; Green and red.\n\n323\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.803\nThere's colors on the screen.\n\n324\n00:19:17.803 --> 00:19:19.428\nColors are hard.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:19:19.428 --> 00:19:20.569\n&gt;&gt; They are hard, I'm not gonna lie.\n\n326\n00:19:20.569 --> 00:19:21.811\nI'm just messing with you Vonne.\n\n327\n00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:25.903\nSo the second, and be careful here,\nI'm talking like as you and I would talk,\n\n328\n00:19:25.903 --> 00:19:27.892\nnot necessarily programmatically.\n\n329\n00:19:27.892 --> 00:19:31.551\nWhat we know though, well,\nstrings are zero-indexed, so\n\n330\n00:19:31.551 --> 00:19:33.641\nour first is actually index zero.\n\n331\n00:19:33.641 --> 00:19:39.241\nSo if I come up here, it's no longer\nlast but instead the last and\n\n332\n00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:43.312\nthen in order to go this way,\nwe need to minus.\n\n333\n00:19:43.312 --> 00:19:46.680\nAll right, so we're kinda going chugga,\nchugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, all right.\n\n334\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.060\nTwo chains leave at the same path and\nthey're gonna meet in the middle.\n\n335\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.290\nAt any point,\nif I continue down now, all right?\n\n336\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.260\nSo if I come here and I come here,\nI'm gonna compare the letters.\n\n337\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.900\nWhat if those letters are equal?\n\n338\n00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.690\nThen I move along again.\n\n339\n00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.430\nIf they're not, then no.\n\n340\n00:20:04.595 --> 00:20:07.815\nBut notice this little section right here.\n\n341\n00:20:09.764 --> 00:20:13.066\nWell, anytime you start seeing\nyourself self referencing,\n\n342\n00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:15.360\nguess what that means programmatically?\n\n343\n00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.360\nIt means, a loop.\n\n344\n00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.210\nSo we're gonna kind of loop through and\ngo back and forth.\n\n345\n00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:28.570\nBut what it also means is, well instead\nof reversing the string, which means we\n\n346\n00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:34.256\nhave to turn it backwards and then start\nrunning through it, we just start looping.\n\n347\n00:20:34.256 --> 00:20:37.857\nAnd as soon as we find a letter\nthat doesn't match, we 'so nope,\n\n348\n00:20:37.857 --> 00:20:39.261\nit's not a palindrome.\n\n349\n00:20:39.261 --> 00:20:41.290\nIt's kind of a short circuit.\n\n350\n00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.040\nWe hop out of the loop as soon\nas we know the answer is false.\n\n351\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.280\nThe only way that we finally\nget to the end, right?\n\n352\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.700\nWe do this loop until, right?\n\n353\n00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.120\nThere's kind of a, this inherent\ncondition is at the last comparison.\n\n354\n00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.140\nIf it is, then we go, yes.\n\n355\n00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.350\nAnd if we get there,\nthat's the only time we know.\n\n356\n00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.930\nSo that's the maximum numbers of\ncomparisons, if ever find the one that's\n\n357\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.530\ndifferent then we've made\nthe minimum number of comparisons.\n\n358\n00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.370\nSo there's some helpfulness in\nthat instead of just reversing and\n\n359\n00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.510\nthen comparing.\n&gt;&gt; Because eventually the first letter\n\n360\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.730\nis gonna be the end of the string.\n\n361\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.680\nSo because of the length,\nstrings have a length and\n\n362\n00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.010\nit's gonna know there is a length and\nI want you to get the end,\n\n363\n00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.214\nwe are done.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so we would go the full screen,\n\n364\n00:21:26.214 --> 00:21:31.195\nand technically we could even get crazier\ncuz if we got half way through the string,\n\n365\n00:21:31.195 --> 00:21:35.963\nall right we could make an assumption,\nso if I look here, I don't actually need\n\n366\n00:21:35.963 --> 00:21:38.479\nthese last three comparisons.\n&gt;&gt; The,\n\n367\n00:21:38.479 --> 00:21:42.782\ncuz that other half is supposed to be\nthe same because it's a palindrome, well,\n\n368\n00:21:42.782 --> 00:21:44.530\nif it is.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we made a copy.\n\n369\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.850\nSo since it's a copy,\nit has to be the same.\n\n370\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.560\nSo these two, right?\n\n371\n00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.440\nThis bottom one was actually generated\nfrom the top and so that we know.\n\n372\n00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.060\nBut the last half is the same.\n\n373\n00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.960\nWe haven't made any changes.\n\n374\n00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.500\nBut we're gonna keep it simple.\n\n375\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.800\nSo we have to check all of\nthem just in case, right?\n\n376\n00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.260\nMaybe we did something wrong.\n\n377\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.180\nMaybe that's a faulty assumption.\n\n378\n00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.020\nBut it all hinge on this first\nlittle transformation here.\n\n379\n00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:10.604\nRemove spaces.\n\n380\n00:22:10.604 --> 00:22:14.302\nOnce we remove spaces,\nthen our drawing actually informed us,\n\n381\n00:22:14.302 --> 00:22:15.538\nwhat we needed to do.\n\n382\n00:22:15.538 --> 00:22:18.109\nWe just needed to match right first last,\n\n383\n00:22:18.109 --> 00:22:22.735\n[SOUND] all the way down until we found\neither, something that was wrong, or\n\n384\n00:22:22.735 --> 00:22:24.661\nsomething that wasn't.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n385\n00:22:24.661 --> 00:22:29.542\none of the parts where actually\nthe goal is remove spaces,\n\n386\n00:22:29.542 --> 00:22:34.719\nthat's because you can do things\nin a string like find I mean,\n\n387\n00:22:34.719 --> 00:22:39.362\nfind the space and, take it out.\n&gt;&gt; It's not exactly the fine but\n\n388\n00:22:39.362 --> 00:22:42.109\nit is a find and\nit's actually a find and replace.\n\n389\n00:22:42.109 --> 00:22:47.701\nSo Vonne is asking this behavior,\nis actually called replace but,\n\n390\n00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:51.733\nthere is kind of this implicit find and\nreplace.\n\n391\n00:22:51.733 --> 00:22:55.723\nSo it's a in a string, find this\ncharacter, replace it with this, and\n\n392\n00:22:55.723 --> 00:22:59.780\nwhat you're gonna do is say find all\nspaces and replace it with nothing,\n\n393\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.320\nthe empty string, and all it does is\ngo cool, I just removed all the spaces.\n\n394\n00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.812\nThere's no characters there and\nit just squishes it.\n\n395\n00:23:05.812 --> 00:23:08.571\n&gt;&gt; And that's the inherent behavior of\n\n396\n00:23:08.571 --> 00:23:10.805\nwhat is a string.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep.\n\n397\n00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:12.570\nThat is exactly.\n\n398\n00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.243\n[INAUDIBLE] Makes my heart flutter,\nbeautiful.\n\n399\n00:23:15.243 --> 00:23:17.854\nSo now that we have this\nkind of flow charted out,\n\n400\n00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:21.228\nwe're down to I think we can start\nwriting In this algorithm but\n\n401\n00:23:21.228 --> 00:23:25.576\nlooking at the clock, we definitely don't\nhave time to do that in this episode.\n\n402\n00:23:25.576 --> 00:23:29.240\nSo we're gonna have to come back for\nanother one to see how this plays out\n\n403\n00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.567\nin actual code.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, we detect,\n\n404\n00:23:31.567 --> 00:23:33.594\nwe learned how to detect a palindrome, and\n\n405\n00:23:33.594 --> 00:23:37.554\nI detect that I actually learned something\nin this episode, which is really good.\n\n406\n00:23:37.554 --> 00:23:40.493\nI usually do learn things in your\nepisodes, which makes me very happy.\n\n407\n00:23:40.493 --> 00:23:44.175\nSo you're going to learn some more\ntoo hopefully, so come on back.\n\n408\n00:23:44.175 --> 00:23:45.962\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n409\n00:23:45.962 --> 00:23:47.600\nSigning off for DevProTV.\n\n410\n00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.631\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n411\n00:23:49.631 --> 00:23:51.337\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n412\n00:23:51.337 --> 00:23:59.010\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.550\nHelping you to learn everywhere you go.\n\n4\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.520\nI'm your host Zach Memos for this\nepisode of Algorithmic Problem Solving.\n\n5\n00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.600\nThis episode,\ndetect palindromes Coding, and\n\n6\n00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.430\nthe person who's gonna be helping us,\nis the one and only,\n\n7\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.710\nyou know him love him can't live without\nhim, Justin Dennison right over here.\n\n8\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.200\n&gt;&gt; It's great to be back Zack and I wish,\nthat my girlfriend would say she couldn't\n\n9\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.468\nlive without me but-\n&gt;&gt; She does behind the scenes.\n\n10\n00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:45.340\n&gt;&gt; Some deprecating humor, it's fine and\nmeans neither here nor there.\n\n11\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.770\nBut palindromes, number one,\nI want you to say that word.\n\n12\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.930\n&gt;&gt; Palindromes.\n&gt;&gt; Number two,\n\n13\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.440\nyou should definitely\nwatch the planning video,\n\n14\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.470\ncuz if you havent,you probably are like,\nwhat is a palindrome.\n\n15\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.450\nPalindrome is a word or a series that are\nexactly the same forward and backwards.\n\n16\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, rats live on no evil star.\n\n17\n00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.600\nIf you go from the other side it's still\nrats live on no evil star, all right.\n\n18\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.750\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n19\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.040\nAnd they don't either,\nthey don't like evil stars.\n\n20\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.980\n&gt;&gt; They do not.\n\n21\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.445\nEspecially not dwarfs, brown dwarfs,\nI'm talking about a star, not rats.\n\n22\n00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:20.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or a white dwarf, any of those.\n\n23\n00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.560\nOther than the ridiculous amount\nof radiationing, gravitational\n\n24\n00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.630\npull that they would smear them on\nthe surface, they just don't like them.\n\n25\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.190\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; In general.\n\n26\n00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.930\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n27\n00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.320\n&gt;&gt; So, there was a little bit of fun,\nthere, but pallindromes, right?\n\n28\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.130\nWhat do I need to do?\n\n29\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.730\nWell, this is an interesting follow up\nbecause I told you, in the reverse of\n\n30\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.700\nstring, that, really,\nyou start seeing these patterns.\n\n31\n00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.005\nA palindrome is something\nthat forward to backwards,\n\n32\n00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:52.750\nif I have the original and the reverse,\nI can just set them equal.\n\n33\n00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.370\nSo I could take the easy way out, take my,\nif I go back a couple episodes and\n\n34\n00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.800\ntake my reverse string,\nI can go, here's a string.\n\n35\n00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.910\nHere's the reversed version of it,\nare they equal?\n\n36\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.220\nThey are, cool, it's a palindrome.\n\n37\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.720\nHowever, we're not gonna do that,\nwe're not gonna take the easy way.\n\n38\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.380\nWe're gonna lug that rock for ourselves\nbefore we start taking short cuts,\n\n39\n00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.450\nand I think it's important\nthat we always approach this.\n\n40\n00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.880\nSo, let's go ahead and\nstop talking about doing and actually do.\n\n41\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.333\nSo, let's take a look at the screen here,\nand we're banging our algorithms folder.\n\n42\n00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.724\nWe're gonna find LS and\nfinding the maximum and\n\n43\n00:02:23.724 --> 00:02:26.220\nreversing the string,\n&gt;&gt; And well,\n\n44\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.437\nlet's make another director\ncalled finding palindrome.\n\n45\n00:02:31.437 --> 00:02:37.930\nAll right, I'm gonna hop over into that,\nmaybe, there we go.\n\n46\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.680\nAnd then I'm going to touch main dot PY.\n\n47\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.460\nAnd you can, I kinda telegraph\nhow much I hit tab when I'm using\n\n48\n00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.610\nthis terminal environment, because it\nflashes when there's nothing to do.\n\n49\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.460\nSo I'm just spamming tab,\nso we're good there.\n\n50\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.090\nWhat do we have?\n\n51\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.840\nWe have a main.py.\n\n52\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.020\nWe need to open it up in Visual Studio\nCode, as always, right, great algorithm.\n\n53\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.380\nWe've got reproducible,\napproachable,wWell, ideally it should be.\n\n54\n00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.990\nAnd then so I made that full screen,\nand I'm going to open and\n\n55\n00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.730\nI'm particularly going to\nopen finding palindrome.\n\n56\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.798\nAlright so boom, there we go.\n\n57\n00:03:15.798 --> 00:03:19.260\nThere's our main.py, and as always before\nwe continue we should always make sure\n\n58\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.730\nwe can get an initial kind of setup.\n\n59\n00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.418\nAnd how are we going to\nfind this palindrome?\n\n60\n00:03:24.418 --> 00:03:28.165\nI'm going to hide this away remember it's\ncommand b control b As long as you're in\n\n61\n00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:31.934\nthe editor window, it'll hide that sign\nbar, give us a little more real estate.\n\n62\n00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:36.393\nSo is palindrome, so\nI'm going to take a string, and\n\n63\n00:03:36.393 --> 00:03:41.260\nthat's going to return whether\nit is a palindrome or not.\n\n64\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.430\nYes or no question,\nit's going to return true or false.\n\n65\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.130\nAnd so, if, whoa,\ntoo many equal signs there\n\n66\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.410\nIs palindrome and a s,\nexcuse me, cheese, there we go.\n\n67\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.260\nNow I've already put that parameter, and\nbecause that's positional parameter.\n\n68\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.560\nI would have to find something in order\nto call it otherwise it would break.\n\n69\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.270\nBut let see if we have everything else\nset up so Python3 main.py,lLooks good.\n\n70\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:20.400\nAll right, so, you know what?\n\n71\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.750\nI'm we probably need at least to think\nabout, what is a good palindrome?\n\n72\n00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.280\nThe name Bob is actually a palindrome.\n\n73\n00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.566\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Right b-o-b,\n\n74\n00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:34.720\nassuming it is not capitalized, all right.\n\n75\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.730\nSo we're gonna make an assumption that\nwe have all lower case letters for\n\n76\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.600\nthe things that we're doing.\n\n77\n00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.190\nThat is important to think about,\n\n78\n00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.390\nwe could have changed the problem\ndepending on what the original specs are.\n\n79\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.740\nBut that's part of our assumption,\nif your assumptions are wrong,\n\n80\n00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.780\nthen your algorithm can have\nan inherent flaw in it.\n\n81\n00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.580\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n82\n00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.683\n&gt;&gt; So be very aware of that.\n\n83\n00:04:59.683 --> 00:05:05.230\nOkay, so let's think about it,\nwait for it.\n\n84\n00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.340\nAssert is_palendrome of bob,\n\n85\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.220\nthat is gonna be true, okay?\n\n86\n00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.180\nSo I have to do an explicit equals here,\nbecause there are times\n\n87\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.890\nwhere I wanna see if it's true or\nfalse, cuz I'm using Necessary.\n\n88\n00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.560\nAgain, just to reiterate something\nI said in a previous episode,\n\n89\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.320\nI'm kind of hijacking this in order to\nget us this kind of quick feedback.\n\n90\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.456\nThis is not necessarily how you\nwould use this in the long term.\n\n91\n00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:36.440\n[COUGH] All right, so\nb-o-b is a palindrome.\n\n92\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.690\nWell, I could always just return True,\nand it would work, right.\n\n93\n00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.480\nSo python3, no news is good news, awesome.\n\n94\n00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.520\nBut now, you know what, Is palindrome.\n\n95\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.286\nAnd what's your favorite color there Zach?\n\n96\n00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.190\n&gt;&gt; Blue.\n&gt;&gt; Blue.\n\n97\n00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.263\nIs blue a palindrome?\n\n98\n00:05:56.263 --> 00:05:57.135\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n99\n00:05:57.135 --> 00:05:58.443\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n100\n00:05:58.443 --> 00:05:59.550\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n101\n00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.250\nYou're like.\n\n102\n00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.297\nYou're not asking a rhetorical question,\nbut\n\n103\n00:06:02.297 --> 00:06:04.481\n&gt;&gt; Be Eulb [LAUGH].\n\n104\n00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:05.495\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n105\n00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:07.120\nEulb.\nIt's weird.\n\n106\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.050\nIt's not a palindrome,\nso it should be false.\n\n107\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.500\nSo if I do that, well, guess what?\n\n108\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.437\nBoom, assertion error, so\nI've already broken my very simple thing.\n\n109\n00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:19.712\nBut based on our planning, what I'm\nthinking is if we have a string and\n\n110\n00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.600\nthen we can go to the other end.\n\n111\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.285\nAnd we can kind of start going,\nare these the same, are these the same,\n\n112\n00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:29.550\nare these the same, are these the same,\nare these the same, right?\n\n113\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.150\nThen we should be good to go,\nnow, let's think about this.\n\n114\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.750\nYou know what,\n\n115\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.210\nI'm gonna add one more test,\nis_palindrome of the empty string.\n\n116\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.759\nIs the empty string the same forward or\nbackwards?\n\n117\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.170\nYeah, cuz there's nothing in it, right?\n\n118\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.300\n&gt;&gt; This is it?\n&gt;&gt; No, there's nothing.\n\n119\n00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n120\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.620\n&gt;&gt; So technically,\nthat is a palindrome, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:04.550\nSo let's do this and say, hm,\nI wonder what we wanna do.\n\n122\n00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, if the length of s\n\n123\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.150\nis equal to zero,\nI'm kind of preempting this part here.\n\n124\n00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:20.470\nIf it's equal to zero,\nthen return true, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.900\nNow what do I mean if it's empty to zero?\n\n126\n00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.920\nWell, the length of\nthe empty string is zero.\n\n127\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.750\nSo, I've kind of preempted this, and\n\n128\n00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.710\nthat's just an edge case deviation so\nto speak.\n\n129\n00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.810\nAnd we're good there,\nand we'll come back and\n\n130\n00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.230\nsee what happens when we take that out.\n\n131\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.620\nReally this is the main part,\n\n132\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.330\nwe're starting to get started on\nthe main part of the I rhythm.\n\n133\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.416\nSo, what I'm thinking,\n\n134\n00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:48.314\nIs if, or excuse me, for\n\n135\n00:07:48.314 --> 00:07:54.091\nindex in the range of the length of s.\n\n136\n00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:55.570\nSo what is that gonna do?\n\n137\n00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.598\nWell let's print index.\n\n138\n00:07:59.598 --> 00:08:00.298\nOkay?\n\n139\n00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:04.040\nSo boop, 0, 1, 2.\n\n140\n00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.776\nWell that is b-o-b, so 0, 1, 2.\n\n141\n00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:10.690\nIt's gonna give me the indexes and\nit's gonna give me correct indexes.\n\n142\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.460\nSo I'm gonna run 0, 1, 2,\nwhich is b-o-b, all right?\n\n143\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.810\nSo this index is gonna give me that.\n\n144\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.030\nAnd what I want to do is say,\n\n145\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.510\nif at 0 index is the exact same as the 0\n\n146\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:30.560\nindex of the reversed string, all right?\n\n147\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.220\nNow I showed you something in that\nreverse string episode where we can\n\n148\n00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.230\nreally shorten that.\n\n149\n00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.040\nHere's what I'm thinking.\n\n150\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:46.790\nIf s of index is equal to s of index.\n\n151\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:52.710\nBut what I wanna do first is\nthis slicing pattern here.\n\n152\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.390\nWhat I'm I doing?\n\n153\n00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.020\nI'm saying, hey, take this string and\nreverse it, so I'm gonna flip it around.\n\n154\n00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.788\nAnd now I'm gonna grab the reversed one.\n\n155\n00:09:00.788 --> 00:09:04.248\nSo what that's gonna do is\nthat's going to take the end and\n\n156\n00:09:04.248 --> 00:09:07.649\nit's going to make another\nstring that's the reverse.\n\n157\n00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:10.970\nAnd so\nI'm just kinda plopping along, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.740\nSo are b and b the same?\n\n159\n00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.440\nYep, are o and o the same?\n\n160\n00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:13.982\nYep, are b and b the same?\n\n161\n00:09:13.982 --> 00:09:15.290\nYep.\n\n162\n00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:20.224\nSo if they are the same\nthen what would we do?\n\n163\n00:09:20.224 --> 00:09:23.900\nWell this is where\nalgorithms get interesting.\n\n164\n00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:29.500\nI could keep track of this, but really,\nhow do I determine if it's a palindrome?\n\n165\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.272\nIf I have to run through the entire\nthing that's how I know that I have\n\n166\n00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:35.384\na palindrome.\n\n167\n00:09:35.384 --> 00:09:39.534\nBit as soon as I find a letter\nthat's not the same, right,\n\n168\n00:09:39.534 --> 00:09:41.842\nyou'll be, right, so b and e.\n\n169\n00:09:41.842 --> 00:09:44.170\nAre those the same in blue?\n\n170\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.390\nThey're not, so I should go nope,\nnot a palindrome.\n\n171\n00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.890\nSo what I really wanna ask are,\nare these not the same?\n\n172\n00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.820\nBecause if they're not the same,\nI know it's not a palindrome.\n\n173\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:58.085\nAnd by flipping that logic around it\nactually makes my algorithm a little\n\n174\n00:09:58.085 --> 00:10:03.089\neasier to reason about, because now\nby changing this to not equals,\n\n175\n00:10:03.089 --> 00:10:06.670\nif they're not equal, then return false.\n\n176\n00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.810\nAnd I don't have to check everything,\nwhich doesn't seem like a big deal.\n\n177\n00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.470\nBut what if you had 1 million letters,\nright?\n\n178\n00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.430\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of letters.\n\n179\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.400\n&gt;&gt; That is a lot of letters.\n\n180\n00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.982\nAnd what you would have to do is you would\nhave to do 1 million comparisons, right,\n\n181\n00:10:20.982 --> 00:10:21.842\nto determine.\n\n182\n00:10:21.842 --> 00:10:26.570\nBut what if you found out later that\nthe first letters aren't a match?\n\n183\n00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.531\nWell why did you do a million comparisons\nwhen you already knew that a and\n\n184\n00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:32.057\ne aren't the same letter?\n\n185\n00:10:32.057 --> 00:10:36.750\nIf they're not the same letter, then\nby default it's not a palindrome, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.110\n&gt;&gt; It's like you always say, check,\ncheck, check, check your work.\n\n187\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.925\n&gt;&gt; Check, check, check your work.\n\n188\n00:10:39.925 --> 00:10:42.863\nAnd then sometimes this is\nabout flipping it on its end,\n\n189\n00:10:42.863 --> 00:10:45.570\nit becomes a little bit easier, right?\n\n190\n00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.680\nAnd then well,\nif I get through this entire for loop,\n\n191\n00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.900\nthe only time I'm gonna hit this\nreturn false, which means the for\n\n192\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.410\nloop will end and the function will\nreturn false, is if they don't match.\n\n193\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.670\nBut once I get to here,\nthat means they do match, right?\n\n194\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:03.248\nThat means every letter of the original\nand the reversed match, pair-by-pair.\n\n195\n00:11:03.248 --> 00:11:07.110\nWell that means return True, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.770\nWell, I intentionally did this just\nto kinda talk about something.\n\n197\n00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.280\nSo let's go see if we have\nno news is good news, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.020\nSo here we go, and it works, right?\n\n199\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.210\nSo let's clear it out.\n\n200\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.550\nLet's make sure it does.\n\n201\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.010\nAll right, so it works.\n\n202\n00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.530\nLet's add a few more test cases.\n\n203\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:38.254\nAssert, and I actually said is_palindrome\n'rats live on no evil star'.\n\n204\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.270\nAnd that should be true.\n\n205\n00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.230\nAssert, and here is where it gets tricky.\n\n206\n00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.155\nPalindrome, '\n\n207\n00:11:54.155 --> 00:12:00.040\n_--_ | _--_'.\n\n208\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.730\nLet's try it with no letters,\ninstead just random characters.\n\n209\n00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.010\nAll right, there's True.\n\n210\n00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.905\nShould be True.\nLet's go check it out, and\n\n211\n00:12:09.905 --> 00:12:13.353\nwe added a couple no news is good news.\n\n212\n00:12:13.353 --> 00:12:14.570\nNow, one last one here.\n\n213\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.400\nI have a question for\nyou before you before you go on.\n\n214\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.230\nRats live on no evil star,\ndid you invent that?\n\n215\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.150\n&gt;&gt; I did not.\n\n216\n00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.098\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n217\n00:12:21.098 --> 00:12:23.440\nI always find languages very interesting.\n\n218\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.180\nSo palindromes, there's actually\na song by a prominent parody artist.\n\n219\n00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.334\nI don't know how if we can talk about it,\nI don't know.\n\n220\n00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.385\n&gt;&gt; Keep it vague.\n\n221\n00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:37.650\n&gt;&gt; He actually has an entire song that\nall the song lyrics are palindromes.\n\n222\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.945\n&gt;&gt; No kidding?\n&gt;&gt; Every word, every-\n\n223\n00:12:39.945 --> 00:12:41.778\n&gt;&gt; Every line in the song.\n\n224\n00:12:41.778 --> 00:12:43.357\n&gt;&gt; Every line in the song is a palindrome.\n\n225\n00:12:43.357 --> 00:12:46.220\nSo rats live on no evil\nstar is one of them.\n\n226\n00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.076\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n227\n00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:50.489\n&gt;&gt; And then there's what,\nHi Madam, my name is Adam, or\n\n228\n00:12:50.489 --> 00:12:53.890\nsomething like that [INAUDIBLE],\nso there's things like that.\n\n229\n00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.420\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n230\n00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.647\n&gt;&gt; But the rats one's funny.\n\n231\n00:12:58.647 --> 00:12:59.521\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n232\n00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:06.883\n&gt;&gt; And then _is_ _ c_ _.\n\n233\n00:13:08.825 --> 00:13:10.885\nLooks like it might be, right?\n\n234\n00:13:10.885 --> 00:13:14.755\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; Except if you're reversed these don't\n\n235\n00:13:14.755 --> 00:13:17.360\nmatch and so you have to be careful.\n\n236\n00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.425\nThis should actually not be a palindrome.\n\n237\n00:13:19.425 --> 00:13:23.656\nSo I've just added some testing\nto add some robustness, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:23.656 --> 00:13:24.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n239\n00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.830\n&gt;&gt; Now early on I added this,\nempty string is True.\n\n240\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.571\nAnd then I said, well, let's just go\nahead and get that out of the way.\n\n241\n00:13:30.571 --> 00:13:34.059\nAnd this is a common thing when you're\ndeveloping [INAUDIBLE] where you're like,\n\n242\n00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:36.740\nthis edge case, let me put if\nstatements at the top, all right?\n\n243\n00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:42.395\nSo okay, if lin s equals 0, return True.\n\n244\n00:13:44.181 --> 00:13:50.810\nWell why do I need this at the beginning?\n\n245\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.272\nLet's comment it out, and\nlet's see what happens.\n\n246\n00:13:52.272 --> 00:13:58.440\nIt actually still works without it,\nso do I need it?\n\n247\n00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.800\nNo, I don't need it.\n\n248\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.970\nAnd the reason being,\nthis is kinda Python-specific.\n\n249\n00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.356\nThis range of lin s,\nwell the empty string is 0.\n\n250\n00:14:09.356 --> 00:14:11.470\nThe range of o is nothing.\n\n251\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.160\nThis for loop never runs,\nso it just returns True.\n\n252\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.620\nSo inherent to some of the behaviors,\n\n253\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.840\nwe get this kind by default,\nas long as it's structured like this.\n\n254\n00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.590\nIf I'd have done the other thing, where\nI made sure to compare everything and\n\n255\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.690\nthen only return after I\nhave compared everything,\n\n256\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.080\nregardless of whether it's palindrome or\nnot, that may become an issue.\n\n257\n00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.020\nBut as a result I'm just gonna leave\nthat commented out just to say,\n\n258\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.590\nwell technically we only need this for\nloop.\n\n259\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.767\nWe need to run through string and\nthe reverse version, compare,\n\n260\n00:14:40.767 --> 00:14:42.980\nuntil we find a difference,\nreturn a False.\n\n261\n00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.550\nIf we never find a difference return True,\nokay?\n\n262\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.990\nSo looks good.\n\n263\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:52.352\nNow, technically,\nwe have accomplished our goal, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:52.352 --> 00:14:53.670\nIs this a palindrome?\n\n265\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.170\nYup.\n\n266\n00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.700\nBut, right, we've made it work.\n\n267\n00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.080\nLet's make it a little bit better.\n\n268\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.956\nWe've learned a little bit.\n\n269\n00:15:00.956 --> 00:15:03.652\nWe've went and done some research and\nwe've programmed some things.\n\n270\n00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:07.680\nAnd I do not necessarily expect you\nat this point of time to go, yeah,\n\n271\n00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.978\nthat's what it does.\n\n272\n00:15:08.978 --> 00:15:13.010\nBut I wanna show you some features of\nPython that maybe pique your interest, so\n\n273\n00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.814\nto speak, and are some common patterns.\n\n274\n00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:18.876\nAnd if you so choose, down the road,\na different language,\n\n275\n00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:22.972\nyou can implement similar things for\nyourself, which is always a fun exercise.\n\n276\n00:15:22.972 --> 00:15:24.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, true.\n\n277\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.600\nSo this is palindrome.\n\n278\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.810\nYou know what?\nLet's just get rid of it.\n\n279\n00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.340\nLet's make a new one.\n\n280\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.950\nLet's call it, wait for it, is_palindrome.\n\n281\n00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.570\nAnd what is it gonna do?\n\n282\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.438\nWell, there's some handy,\n\n283\n00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:43.394\ndandy stuff in Python that'll help.\n\n284\n00:15:43.394 --> 00:15:48.460\nSo, for a, b in zip of s.\n\n285\n00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:56.718\nIf a doesn't equal b,\n\n286\n00:15:56.718 --> 00:16:01.884\nreturn False, return true.\n\n287\n00:16:01.884 --> 00:16:06.027\nAll right, [COUGH] what we've done is\nwe've taken out the calculation of range\n\n288\n00:16:06.027 --> 00:16:07.920\nand numbers and all these.\n\n289\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.796\nThis is it.\n\n290\n00:16:08.796 --> 00:16:13.544\nWe'll take two things and\npair them together, one by one.\n\n291\n00:16:13.544 --> 00:16:20.650\nSo this part replaces this part, okay?\n\n292\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.210\nSo I take the original string,\n\n293\n00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:26.980\nthe reverse version, and I grab a pair\nof letters, and that's what a and b are.\n\n294\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.370\nSo if a is not equal to b, return false.\n\n295\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.990\nAnd then I can go through\nthe entire zipped up collection.\n\n296\n00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.040\nThink of the zipper on a jacket or\nsomething.\n\n297\n00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.720\nYou have the two pieces,\nand you zip them together.\n\n298\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.880\nAnd they go, all right?\n\n299\n00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.180\nSo that is one thing I say it works,\nlet's see if it works.\n\n300\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.450\nIt does.\n\n301\n00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.490\nAll right, now, in addition to,\nthis is a little bit different pattern.\n\n302\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.890\nI could do it an even more concise way.\n\n303\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:04.038\nNot necessarily the most readable, but I'm\ngonna say return all Not all, excuse me.\n\n304\n00:17:04.038 --> 00:17:07.767\nI think, wait, I think this might work.\n\n305\n00:17:07.767 --> 00:17:11.520\nI was just looking at my notes and\nI may have a little typo here.\n\n306\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.604\nSo any c not equal to d for\n\n307\n00:17:17.604 --> 00:17:22.477\nc,d in zip s -1.\n\n308\n00:17:22.477 --> 00:17:28.241\nSo what I'm saying is,\nI want you to return the result,\n\n309\n00:17:28.241 --> 00:17:35.741\nand what any will say is, if any of\nthese is not equal, then return true.\n\n310\n00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:39.151\nThis is where I get in trouble,\ncuz sometimes I mess this up, and\n\n311\n00:17:39.151 --> 00:17:41.290\nthis should highlight something.\n\n312\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.710\nNotice I get an assertion here.\n\n313\n00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:52.490\nSo okay, well, really I want to make\nsure that all of them are equal.\n\n314\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.440\nSo any and all are functions.\n\n315\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.400\nAnd what they do is they take a bunch of\ntrue and falses, and they will return.\n\n316\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.970\nIf any of those things are true,\nthey will return true.\n\n317\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.790\nAll of them have to be true\nin order to return true.\n\n318\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.670\nSo what I'm saying is I\nhave the original string,\n\n319\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.550\nthe reverse string,\nevery pair has to be true.\n\n320\n00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:19.720\nInterestingly enough,\nthis is a single line, fairy pythonic.\n\n321\n00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.310\nAll has to compare from beginning to end.\n\n322\n00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:32.078\nThis doesn't occur easily\nbehind the scenes.\n\n323\n00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:35.347\nOkay, in order to determine a palindrome,\nexcuse me.\n\n324\n00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:38.130\nIt still doesn't makes all the comparison.\n\n325\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:43.945\nIf it is a palindrome,\nall behind the scenes does that for you.\n\n326\n00:18:43.945 --> 00:18:46.240\nI think I said that in\na weird way just now.\n\n327\n00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.310\nLet's just, for clarity, all, if it finds\nany that are false it immediately returns,\n\n328\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.930\nit stops, it short circuits.\n\n329\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:57.500\nBehind the scenes all\neffectively does this part,\n\n330\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.890\nexcept we had to flip our logic\naround a little bit, okay.\n\n331\n00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.230\nSo let's see if it works,\nand no news is good news.\n\n332\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.260\nSo those are three different\nimplementations of exactly the same.\n\n333\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.410\nI would argue this is very\nexplicit about your intention,\n\n334\n00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.210\neven though we could\neliminate part of it and\n\n335\n00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:21.040\nmaybe more portable between\nexperiences and languages.\n\n336\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.400\nThis is a little more Pythonic.\n\n337\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.230\nI tend to write code like this myself.\n\n338\n00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:31.360\nAnd then if you wanna get real slick,\nyou can do stuff like this.\n\n339\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.870\nYou keep in mind, a month from now,\nyou may not be able to read it.\n\n340\n00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.650\nA month from now, your coworker\nmay not be able to read it, or\n\n341\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.820\nsomeone else may not be able to read it.\n\n342\n00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.240\nIf you have to spend a lot of\ntime figuring out what it does,\n\n343\n00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.480\nmaybe it's not the best code.\n\n344\n00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.140\nSo pretty slick, and\nI heard something that it's kind of funny.\n\n345\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.596\nI'm gonna say it, and get kind of on it,\nyou should always write\n\n346\n00:19:53.596 --> 00:19:57.694\ncode like the next person to read it is\na psychopath who knows where you live.\n\n347\n00:19:57.694 --> 00:19:58.974\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n348\n00:19:58.974 --> 00:20:00.958\n&gt;&gt; So just keep that in mind,\n\n349\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:04.960\nmake it clear\n&gt;&gt; Keep moving forward, got it to work and\n\n350\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.610\nmade it a little bit better depending\non your version of better, and\n\n351\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.860\nwe achieved our goal.\n\n352\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.350\nSo there it is, if you wanna know if\nyou have a palindrome, feed it in,\n\n353\n00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.400\nyou get a true or false response and\nwe're all good to go.\n\n354\n00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, I want to thank you for\nsharing with me, Justin, and\n\n355\n00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.970\nno I'm not a psychopath,\nso that's a good thing.\n\n356\n00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.320\n&gt;&gt; You take palindromes,\ncoding, great episode at all.\n\n357\n00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.580\nAnything else before we move on.\n\n358\n00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know, algorithms, it's just\n\n359\n00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.320\ntiny little pieces that we put together\nand you just keep trying to break it.\n\n360\n00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.962\nOnce you break it, go fix it,\ntry to break it some more.\n\n361\n00:20:33.962 --> 00:20:38.740\nI don't know, sometimes it feels like I\njust have a giant roll of duct tape going.\n\n362\n00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.820\nThere's a hole, just put that there, but\nthat's okay, that's part of the learning\n\n363\n00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.240\nprocess and ultimately you're gonna\napply this to larger scale problems.\n\n364\n00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.340\nSo don't get discouraged.\n\n365\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.000\nIf you have to, take a little bit\nof a break, take a walk, come back.\n\n366\n00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.945\nSometimes a fresh set of eyes or just\na little bit of fresh air helps you go.\n\n367\n00:20:56.945 --> 00:20:58.185\nThere's what I need to get.\n\n368\n00:20:58.185 --> 00:21:00.205\n&gt;&gt; Well said Justin, great advice, and\n\n369\n00:21:00.205 --> 00:21:04.475\nmake sure you watch everything in\nthe algorithmic, problem-solving series.\n\n370\n00:21:04.475 --> 00:21:05.975\nYou'll be very glad you did.\n\n371\n00:21:05.975 --> 00:21:08.715\nAnd by the way, you'll also be in the\ncourse library, where there's thousands of\n\n372\n00:21:08.715 --> 00:21:12.205\nother videos designed to help you\ngo further, so check those out too.\n\n373\n00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:14.405\nAnd tell everybody what\nyou know about DevPro TV,\n\n374\n00:21:14.405 --> 00:21:16.400\na good DevPro is always learning.\n\n375\n00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.800\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n376\n00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.432\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n377\n00:21:18.432 --> 00:21:20.546\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n378\n00:21:20.546 -->

DevProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.826\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:21.515\nwe are moving through our\nalgorithmic problem solving.\n\n5\n00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:22.574\nIn this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:27.020\nwe are going to be creating a title in\nhere to title this episode for us is Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.130\nJustin Dennison, how are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Vonne,\n\n8\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.380\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n9\n00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.102\nI think I already titled it by saying\nwe're gonna be creating a title.\n\n10\n00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:40.384\n[LAUGH] So at first I was like,\nI'm not exactly sure what you're\n\n11\n00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:45.366\nmeaning by title, so please do explain.\n&gt;&gt; I will try my\n\n12\n00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:50.428\nbest because just based on this\nepisode's title, that's weird.\n\n13\n00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:56.181\nYou would think you're just typing in\na title for the, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n14\n00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:59.964\nThink of this, there are many time,\nactually use this a great deal.\n\n15\n00:00:59.964 --> 00:01:01.878\nI've used this in a variety of languages.\n\n16\n00:01:01.878 --> 00:01:04.540\nI get some data maybe from users or\nsomething, right?\n\n17\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.170\nAnd I know that a specific portion\nof text should be title case.\n\n18\n00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.226\nWe're gonna simplify this.\n\n19\n00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:12.797\nThere's a lot of rules there and Vonne,\n\n20\n00:01:12.797 --> 00:01:15.640\nyou're probably gonna get angry\nabout this but it's all right.\n\n21\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.290\nI'm just gonna assume that the first\nletter of every word is uppercase.\n\n22\n00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.470\nIf it's one letter,\nit should be uppercase.\n\n23\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.640\nIt gets weird when we're\ntalking about like what is it,\n\n24\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.600\nthe articles like the, and an,\nand a, or whatever that is.\n\n25\n00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.900\nIt gets a little weird there, but\nwe're kind of simplifying that just\n\n26\n00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.300\nto approach it programmatically.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you're talking my language now\n\n27\n00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.720\nbecause I do a lot of typesetting and\na lot of work with text.\n\n28\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.172\nYou're talking in my language,\nwould be, change case.\n\n29\n00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:48.339\nYou have sentence case,\nyou have upper case, you have lower case,\n\n30\n00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:52.284\nyou have small caps, I mean, you have all\nthese different, to me, on my programs,\n\n31\n00:01:52.284 --> 00:01:54.150\nthey're just little buttons.\n\n32\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.030\nOr you select the tags and then go\nto the menu and say change case and\n\n33\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.920\nit has those options,\nthe sentence case, the title case, and\n\n34\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.790\nthe lowercase, and the uppercase.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n35\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.010\neffectively, we would be writing\none of the functions, right?\n\n36\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.150\nDuring an implementation phase, that is\nattached to one of those button clicks.\n\n37\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.190\nYou go, grab this,\ntitle case and it goes, cool.\n\n38\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.890\nI'm gonna put this text in, [SOUND] and\nI'm gonna get a title cased version out,\n\n39\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.450\nor all caps, or all lowercase, or I never\nhave ever programmed that weird one\n\n40\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.750\nwhere it's upper case except for\nthe first letter and it's lower case.\n\n41\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.049\nI don't like that.\n&gt;&gt; I always saw that option in Word and\n\n42\n00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.343\nI'm like, why would you ever do that?\n\n43\n00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:36.210\n[LAUGH] But I do know it is an option.\n\n44\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.210\nSo you're going to simplify and talk\nin a different way of all these things\n\n45\n00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.010\nthat I do every day, but probably don't\ntake the time to really slow it down.\n\n46\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.318\nAnd we talked off camera I'm\nhaving a hard time being this,\n\n47\n00:02:51.318 --> 00:02:56.671\nI don't wanna say being this slow,\nbut really just letting it be simple.\n\n48\n00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:58.490\nI'm trying to over complicate it.\n\n49\n00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.460\nSo this is a really good series for me\nto be on so I can just stay with you and\n\n50\n00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.646\nstay down here.\n\n51\n00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:07.006\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm gonna tell you, Yvonne,\n\n52\n00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:11.343\njust remember the acronym YAGNI,\nY-A-G-N-I, you ain't gonna need it, so\n\n53\n00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:14.115\nstop trying to build things\nyou ain't gonna need.\n\n54\n00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:18.129\nSo yeah, not appropriate.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.806\n&gt;&gt; Ain't is, anyway, so, but\n\n56\n00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:24.810\nit's really hard, for the most part you're\nlike, what if I do this in the long-term?\n\n57\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.030\nNo, build what you need right now,\nall right?\n\n58\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.980\nThe simplest possible solution that\nactually achieves your goal, and our\n\n59\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.550\ngoal now is, I'm gonna take in some random\ntext, and it's going to title case it.\n\n60\n00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.150\nThere's some assumptions here.\n\n61\n00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.370\nSpaces delineate words, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.030\nSo if I have a space, it's delineated.\n\n63\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.320\nIn addition to there's going\nto be maybe no numbers\n\n64\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.940\nright at the beginning of words cuz\nthere's no such thing as an uppercase two.\n\n65\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.900\nNot that I know of, there might be\nin some weird fonts or edge cases,\n\n66\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.820\nbut we're not worried about that.\n\n67\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.650\nAnd then for the most part,\nwe're not worried about punctuation or\n\n68\n00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.360\nthings like that.\n\n69\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.035\nAnd as I've already said, we're gonna\nassume that each word gets a capital\n\n70\n00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:11.029\nletter and not those edge cases\nwhere I know some people are like,\n\n71\n00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.430\nno you don't capitalize a, the, and and.\n\n72\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.903\nWell, what if it's at\nthe beginning of the tittle?\n\n73\n00:04:14.903 --> 00:04:16.162\nWell, yeah, then you do.\n\n74\n00:04:16.162 --> 00:04:20.016\nNo, we're just gonna assume that every\nword gets an uppercase letter at\n\n75\n00:04:20.016 --> 00:04:21.836\nthe beginning of it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n76\n00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:24.737\nwe're taking the English\nlanguage rules and everything.\n\n77\n00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:28.015\nIt's just one word,\nwhatever, capitalize it,\n\n78\n00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:32.486\nevery word is capitalized.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that is what we're doing and well,\n\n79\n00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:35.821\nwe always have to start by\ndrawing a picture, right?\n\n80\n00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:40.072\nSo let's go and take a look at the screen\nhere and start by drawing a picture.\n\n81\n00:04:40.072 --> 00:04:45.351\nSo we're gonna draw and there's,\nsometimes there's not a lot to draw but\n\n82\n00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:48.380\nthe drawing is just to get,\nkinda get your ideas out.\n\n83\n00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.860\nSo you know what, there's a bunch of\ndifferent cases that we could think about.\n\n84\n00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.927\nWhat if they're all lowercase letters?\n\n85\n00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:55.405\nWhat if they're all uppercase letters?\n\n86\n00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:57.630\nWhat if they're a mixed set of letters?\n\n87\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.950\nIs it possible that I already have\nsomething that is title cased or\n\n88\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.560\nwhat should it do?\n\n89\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.330\nSo let's think about this, I'm gonna\nstart with one word and kinda just draw.\n\n90\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.340\nSo what if I have,\nLet's just say the word check.\n\n91\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.711\nSo C-H-E-C-K.\n\n92\n00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:21.700\nWell, what should I get?\n\n93\n00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.340\nI should get capital C-H-E-C-K.\n\n94\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.983\nWell, what if I have CHECK,\n\n95\n00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:36.631\nwhat should I get this time?\n\n96\n00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:44.610\nWell, I should still get Chec,\nthat's a K, I promise that's a K.\n\n97\n00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.390\nAnd let me just be real explicit about\nthis cuz that looks like a capital K.\n\n98\n00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.450\nSo check, we should get the same output,\nright, we feed both of those in.\n\n99\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.752\nWhat if I have, need,\n\n100\n00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:06.740\nneed, checks?\n\n101\n00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.090\nWell, what should I get?\n\n102\n00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.250\nThis one kinda deviates\ncuz now I have two words.\n\n103\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.680\nWell, I should get need, checks, Let me\nmake sure that's not behind my head there.\n\n104\n00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.100\nRight, notice this letter and\n\n105\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.310\nthis letter are uppercase as they\nare two and then check, check.\n\n106\n00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.460\nSo that's ultimately\nwhat we're trying to do.\n\n107\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.010\nNow by drawing this, I go, okay,\nwell, I see a pattern here.\n\n108\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.240\nI can kinda chunk these up based on words.\n\n109\n00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.040\nSo if I look at this,\nhere's a word, here's a word and\n\n110\n00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.450\nthen it gets weird cuz this\none actually has two words.\n\n111\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.040\nThere's a space there,\nbut that's all right.\n\n112\n00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.150\nAnd then within the word, right,\n\n113\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.551\nI have the first letter, the first letter,\n\n114\n00:07:02.551 --> 00:07:06.550\nthe first letter, and the first letter,\nthose should all be uppercase.\n\n115\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.123\nThe remaining part of the word,\nRight here,\n\n116\n00:07:13.123 --> 00:07:15.844\nhere, here and here,\n\n117\n00:07:15.844 --> 00:07:21.438\nthey should all be lower case letters,\nokay?\n\n118\n00:07:21.438 --> 00:07:24.572\nThough by kind of drawing these and\n\n119\n00:07:24.572 --> 00:07:29.974\ntrying to look at these patterns,\nthen well, I kinda see,\n\n120\n00:07:29.974 --> 00:07:35.620\nif I can do this then indirectly,\nI can kinda do that, right?\n\n121\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.110\nNow I kinda jumped ahead\nbecause the drawing part is\n\n122\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.860\npart of the thought process.\n\n123\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.310\nSo what do I know?\n\n124\n00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.166\nMy knows, Right, so\n\n125\n00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:54.435\nstrings are, and we've seen this before.\n\n126\n00:07:54.435 --> 00:08:01.347\nSequences of characters,\nstrings are zero indexed.\n\n127\n00:08:06.993 --> 00:08:09.600\nAll right, so zero indexed.\n\n128\n00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.790\nSo we start counting at 0, so\nup here, this would be the 0th,\n\n129\n00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.921\nthe 1st, the 2nd, the 3rd,\nthe 4th, whoa, there we go.\n\n130\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.340\nStrings have some behaviors.\n\n131\n00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.180\nAnd I am being a little\nloosey-goosey there.\n\n132\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.590\nSo what are those behaviors?\n\n133\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.296\nWell, I can actually call lower, and\n\n134\n00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:41.440\nthat'll actually give me the lowercase,\nall of them become lowercase.\n\n135\n00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.260\nOkay, that's handy.\n\n136\n00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.780\nI can also call upper.\n\n137\n00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.978\nSo if I look,\nI could get this by calling a lower and\n\n138\n00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:53.240\nI could get this by calling upper.\n\n139\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.240\nSo some of those are already built in.\n\n140\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.050\nSo I can do lower, upper,\nI can also do find.\n\n141\n00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:09.210\nAnd well, I can access, Whoa,\nwhoa, whoa, whoa, substrings.\n\n142\n00:09:11.727 --> 00:09:15.410\nWhat do I mean?\n\n143\n00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:21.940\nWell, to some extent, these outlined\nportions, those are substrings.\n\n144\n00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.970\nThey could have a single\ncharacter in them, or\n\n145\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.750\nthey can have a bunch\nof characters in them.\n\n146\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:33.190\nSo those are the things I know,\nand then, well, they also have,\n\n147\n00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:42.310\nA length, and then something that\nwe've seen before, the maximum index.\n\n148\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.272\nGet rid of that, the max index.\n\n149\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.389\nIs the length,\n\n150\n00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.978\n-1, so if I have a 6 letter word,\nthe maximum index for the word is 5.\n\n151\n00:10:00.978 --> 00:10:06.130\nIf I come up here, check has 5 characters,\nthe maximum index is 4.\n\n152\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:11.040\nThat relationship always holds true,\nso what's next?\n\n153\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.344\nAll right, so what is my next part?\n\n154\n00:10:16.344 --> 00:10:18.820\nGot a little cursive in there.\n\n155\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.745\nSo I need to, well,\nI need to create a title case.\n\n156\n00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:29.340\nBut I already know that I\nkinda have some things here.\n\n157\n00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:35.210\nIf I look at this pattern,\nif I could just uppercase the first letter\n\n158\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:40.289\nof the word,\nthen that's part of my goal, right?\n\n159\n00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:43.303\nSo let's think about this,\n\n160\n00:10:43.303 --> 00:10:48.940\nI need to uppercase, The first letter.\n\n161\n00:10:51.887 --> 00:10:56.111\nAnd then, well, I need to\n\n162\n00:10:56.111 --> 00:11:01.673\nlowercase, The rest.\n\n163\n00:11:02.914 --> 00:11:09.710\nAnd then, well,\nI need to split multiple words,\n\n164\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.220\nInto individual words.\n\n165\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.506\nAnd I got a string that has multiple\nwords into individual pieces.\n\n166\n00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:25.250\n&gt;&gt; Would you call those substrings, or?\n\n167\n00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.730\nCuz when you said substrings in\nthe last episode, I was kinda like,\n\n168\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.280\nokay that's a string within a string or\na piece of it.\n\n169\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.345\nAnd then when you just said the first\nletter versus like the four letters,\n\n170\n00:11:38.345 --> 00:11:42.450\nokay, that kind of drove home\nthe concept of a substring to me.\n\n171\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.792\nBut now, when you're saying\nmultiple words, I guess,\n\n172\n00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:53.960\nhow nested can you get substrings?\n&gt;&gt; You can get crazy.\n\n173\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.290\nSo what Vonne's asking about,\nlet's take this last one here.\n\n174\n00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.120\nSo technically, I can do the following.\n\n175\n00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.210\nI can cut this into individual\nsubstrings that are the words.\n\n176\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.745\nAnd then I can take each one of those\nwords and get further substrings where I\n\n177\n00:12:10.745 --> 00:12:15.462\nhave the first letter and the rest of it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n178\n00:12:15.462 --> 00:12:20.835\nbecause, I mean, need checks is not\ntwo strings, it's one whole string.\n\n179\n00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:24.091\nIt's treated that way, okay, so\n\n180\n00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:28.546\nthen sub, sub, and go from there.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and so\n\n181\n00:12:28.546 --> 00:12:32.570\nthis is a little bit different than\nsome of the things we've seen before.\n\n182\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:39.800\nBecause we know how to do this with one,\nkinda, we'll formalize that shortly.\n\n183\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.720\nIf we could do it to one, and then we\ncould chop it up to where I'm always doing\n\n184\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.140\nit to a bunch of ones,\nthen I kinda get that it works, right?\n\n185\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.788\nSo the simplest version is,\nwhat if I have a single word,\n\n186\n00:12:52.788 --> 00:12:54.770\nhow do I capitalize that word?\n\n187\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.220\nIf I can capitalize the word, well,\nwhat if I have a bunch of words?\n\n188\n00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:03.270\nWell, chop it up into single words, and\nthen capitalize all those words together.\n\n189\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.040\nAnd then kinda smash them,\nso chop them, capitalize,\n\n190\n00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.264\nsmush them back together.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n191\n00:13:08.264 --> 00:13:10.590\nthe other thing I was just kinda\nthinking as you're going through this.\n\n192\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:14.607\nDown in the next,\nwhere we have upper the first and\n\n193\n00:13:14.607 --> 00:13:20.070\nthen lower the rest, and\nthat's regardless of what it already is.\n\n194\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.673\nIt's not like we have to look at it,\nevaluate whether you need or not.\n\n195\n00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:28.357\nNo, it's just make it upper,\nwhether it is to begin with or not,\n\n196\n00:13:28.357 --> 00:13:31.130\nis that?\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly correct.\n\n197\n00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.609\nAnd it's funny because that thought\nprocess, a lot of people go,\n\n198\n00:13:34.609 --> 00:13:36.360\nwell is it already capitalized?\n\n199\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.933\nIf it is, then I want,\nno just call lowercase on it.\n\n200\n00:13:38.933 --> 00:13:42.430\nBut this comes from Vonne, because\nshe's seen the little button clicks.\n\n201\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.306\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's also me trying to,\n\n202\n00:13:44.306 --> 00:13:48.545\ndon't over complicate it,\ndon't be well we need to look at it, and\n\n203\n00:13:48.545 --> 00:13:50.430\nevaluate it, and think about.\n\n204\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.870\nNo, you upper it,\nthat's all that needs to be done.\n\n205\n00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.401\nDone.\n\n206\n00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly correct, and\n\n207\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.800\nyou know what?\n\n208\n00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.883\nI'm actually gonna do kind\nof our work through here,\n\n209\n00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:05.240\na little bit different\nthan maybe you've seen.\n\n210\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.349\nSo let's come back to a drawing,\nwhere we're actually making our plan.\n\n211\n00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:15.152\nRight, we're not necessarily kinda\ntumbling it over to understand\n\n212\n00:14:15.152 --> 00:14:16.817\nhow the problem works.\n\n213\n00:14:16.817 --> 00:14:19.437\nLet's say we start with the word check,\nokay?\n\n214\n00:14:19.437 --> 00:14:22.376\nAnd well, actually,\n\n215\n00:14:22.376 --> 00:14:27.480\nlet's start with kind of an edge case,\n\n216\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.400\nor a different case, I guess.\n\n217\n00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.880\nCHECK, right, it's all uppercase.\n\n218\n00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.410\nSo if I know I need to do these things,\n\n219\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:44.620\nI wonder what I should do first,\nor does it matter?\n\n220\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.048\nWell, it's real easy just to just say,\n\n221\n00:14:49.048 --> 00:14:54.040\ngive me the lowercase version\nof all of this, right?\n\n222\n00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.848\nSo if I come down here, I go,\npass it through, lower,\n\n223\n00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:02.030\nwhat do I get out the other side?\n\n224\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.864\nWell, I get check.\n\n225\n00:15:04.864 --> 00:15:11.490\nIt's funny, because if I come back up\nhere and I look at lowercase check.\n\n226\n00:15:13.369 --> 00:15:17.990\nIf I go well, take lowercase check and\npass it through lower, right?\n\n227\n00:15:20.349 --> 00:15:23.320\nWhat do I get out the other side,\nI get lowercase check.\n\n228\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.640\nWell, if I always pass it through lower,\nright,\n\n229\n00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.590\nI'm just making a box saying\nI'm doing something to it.\n\n230\n00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:34.095\nAnd I know that as I pass this information\nthrough, I'm gonna take whatever it is and\n\n231\n00:15:34.095 --> 00:15:36.768\nI'm gonna get the all lowercase version,\nokay?\n\n232\n00:15:36.768 --> 00:15:43.860\nNow, what's interesting is,\nI'm kinda normalizing what's happening.\n\n233\n00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:50.849\nSo what if I have lowercase c,\nuppercase Hec, and then uppercase K?\n\n234\n00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:54.780\nIf I pass that through,\nwhat do I get back out?\n\n235\n00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.380\nI get the lowercase version.\n\n236\n00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.420\nAm I going, get me all the lower ones?\n\n237\n00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.731\nCould I do upper the same way, sure.\n\n238\n00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:01.948\nBut then you have to kinda work backwards.\n\n239\n00:16:01.948 --> 00:16:04.620\nYou know that most of it\nis going to be lower, so\n\n240\n00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.261\nMaybe we should just go ahead and do that.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n241\n00:16:07.261 --> 00:16:12.506\nyou're simplifying is that make it all\nlower and then all you have to do next is,\n\n242\n00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:17.555\nuppercase the first one and that's it.\n&gt;&gt; Yep and am gonna draw this one\n\n243\n00:16:17.555 --> 00:16:22.790\na little bit different way probably\nthan I would implement it,\n\n244\n00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.723\nbut if I take this word, right and\nthen I come to my next one,\n\n245\n00:16:27.723 --> 00:16:32.210\nand I say,\nsplit right it's just a thought process.\n\n246\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.090\nWhat is that gonna do?\n\n247\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.486\nWell out the other side,\nI'm actually gonna get two things.\n\n248\n00:16:38.486 --> 00:16:45.711\nI'm gonna get the c, And that, right?\n\n249\n00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.580\nAnd so what did I do?\n\n250\n00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.238\nI said give me the first one.\n\n251\n00:16:50.238 --> 00:16:51.560\nI'm just calling it split.\n\n252\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.109\nYou could call it whatever you wanted to.\n\n253\n00:16:53.109 --> 00:16:57.020\nI'm getting the first letter,\nand I'm getting the rest.\n\n254\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.091\nWell, do I need to do\nanything else to the rest?\n\n255\n00:17:00.091 --> 00:17:04.400\nWell, if we go back and we look at what's\nnext, I need to lowercase the rest.\n\n256\n00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.906\nWell, by doing lower first.\n&gt;&gt; You've already accomplished that step.\n\n257\n00:17:08.906 --> 00:17:10.230\n&gt;&gt; I've already accomplished that step.\n\n258\n00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.410\nSo, we're just kinda hang out for\na little bit.\n\n259\n00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:16.620\nBut this C, what does it need to do?\n\n260\n00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.304\nWell it needs to be piped through,\n\n261\n00:17:20.304 --> 00:17:25.170\nupper and what do I get on the other side?\n\n262\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.201\nWell, I get an uppercase C.\n\n263\n00:17:28.201 --> 00:17:30.721\nBut then this part is still kind of\n\n264\n00:17:30.721 --> 00:17:33.769\nchugging along.\n&gt;&gt; So then you would just joining them\n\n265\n00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:37.593\nback together?\n&gt;&gt; It's funny that you said that word,\n\n266\n00:17:37.593 --> 00:17:40.990\nbecause that's exactly what we will do.\n\n267\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.747\nYou kinda just put these together and\n\n268\n00:17:46.747 --> 00:17:51.590\nwhat do you get back out, you get Check.\n\n269\n00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.420\nFor all of these inputs,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n270\n00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.274\nThat's for one word, so\nthis works for one word.\n\n271\n00:17:59.274 --> 00:18:02.510\nAs I said, I wouldn't necessarily,\n\n272\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:07.565\nthere'll be some mish mash\nbecause this split upper join,\n\n273\n00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:12.334\none could actually,\nlet's zoom out here a little bit.\n\n274\n00:18:12.334 --> 00:18:17.384\nOne could actually call this,\nmaybe like capitalize.\n\n275\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:24.400\nAnd you could even go further and say like\ncapitalize first or something like that.\n\n276\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.625\nYou could bundle all of those and\nhide it away and say this is capitalized\n\n277\n00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:30.603\nI'm gonna put the word in, and\nthen you do all of those operations.\n\n278\n00:18:30.603 --> 00:18:32.040\nThis is for one word though.\n\n279\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:39.494\nWhat happens if I have a couple\nof words like needs checks.\n\n280\n00:18:43.374 --> 00:18:46.456\nRight well if I call lower on it,\n\n281\n00:18:46.456 --> 00:18:52.380\nwe could do that cuz technically\nthis is one big string okay?\n\n282\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.945\nThose are all bundled together,\nI could call two lower on it, but\n\n283\n00:18:56.945 --> 00:19:02.174\nit gets a little weird because I actually\nneed to capitalize this and this.\n\n284\n00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:07.210\nI already know this is for\na single word, this is for a single one.\n\n285\n00:19:09.637 --> 00:19:12.017\nI can kind of just kind\nof bundle this up and\n\n286\n00:19:12.017 --> 00:19:14.540\nsay if I have a single\nwords I know what to do.\n\n287\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.960\nHow do I get these into single words?\n\n288\n00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:22.490\nWell, how about we say something\n\n289\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:27.427\nlike split_words.\n&gt;&gt; This is where can you\n\n290\n00:19:27.427 --> 00:19:32.370\nfind the delimiter, you find the space,\nand wherever there is a space,\n\n291\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.050\nthen treat that like that's\nthe end of the word.\n\n292\n00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.570\nAnd that's your split.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and when we split these words,\n\n293\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.340\nwe're gonna get\na collection of words back,\n\n294\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.780\nthat is all on that on that one string and\nour collections are typically lists.\n\n295\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.106\nSo, I'm gonna more write this codified,\n\n296\n00:19:49.106 --> 00:19:54.873\nneed checks, like so.\n\n297\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.980\nWell, now I have a collection of words.\n\n298\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.420\nAnd then, what do I do?\n\n299\n00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:08.976\nWell, this one I pipe over here,\nand then this one I pipe over here.\n\n300\n00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:09.834\nAnd what do I get back out?\n\n301\n00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:13.030\nThere's a little hidden behind there.\n\n302\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.557\nI'm kinda gonna get out.\n\n303\n00:20:15.557 --> 00:20:17.270\nNope that's not what I wanted to do.\n\n304\n00:20:19.931 --> 00:20:24.080\nIdeally as I do this,\nwhat I'm gonna end up with is,\n\n305\n00:20:26.135 --> 00:20:31.440\nNeed, Did I say need, yeah need.\n\n306\n00:20:33.974 --> 00:20:38.920\nChecks Well,\n\n307\n00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.050\nI now have them capitalized.\n&gt;&gt; Now you just need to join those two\n\n308\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.724\ninto a single string again.\n&gt;&gt; Yep so we put them through maybe\n\n309\n00:20:47.724 --> 00:20:53.670\na join with,\nwhere what are we gonna join with?\n\n310\n00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:58.840\nWe're gonna join with a space,\nand what do we get back out.\n\n311\n00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.389\nWe get need checks.\n\n312\n00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:08.182\nSo, because I looked at\nthe simpler case where I go,\n\n313\n00:21:08.182 --> 00:21:11.790\ncan I figure out how to do\nthis with a single word?\n\n314\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:12.460\nI can.\n\n315\n00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.390\nIf I can do it with a single word, then\nreally all I need to figure out is how to\n\n316\n00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.740\nsplit, do it to each one of those single\nwords and then put back together.\n\n317\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.285\nI only need two additional pieces.\n\n318\n00:21:24.285 --> 00:21:26.500\nI didn't worry about that at first, right?\n\n319\n00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.408\nWe're going back to that YAGNI.\n\n320\n00:21:28.408 --> 00:21:30.070\nI didn't really care, here.\n\n321\n00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.765\nI just wanted to do it for one word.\n\n322\n00:21:32.765 --> 00:21:36.345\nIf I can do it for one word, okay, well,\nhow do I do it for multiple words?\n\n323\n00:21:36.345 --> 00:21:39.890\nCool, I'm gonna just chop them up,\nand then go do this word,\n\n324\n00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:44.680\ndo this word, do this word, give me it,\ncool I'm gonna smash them back together.\n\n325\n00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.138\nAnd this takes a little bit, but\n\n326\n00:21:47.138 --> 00:21:52.800\nif I have very simple procedures\nthat will work on little tiny bits.\n\n327\n00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.023\nIf I have a collection of\nthose little tiny bits,\n\n328\n00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:58.780\nthen I just take that procedure and apply\nit to the collection of little tiny bits.\n\n329\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.905\nAnd then it's all good to go.\n&gt;&gt; Algorithmic problem solving.\n\n330\n00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:05.271\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's how we go in.\n\n331\n00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:09.637\nWhat's interesting is, this would allow\nus, if we could do these two pieces,\n\n332\n00:22:09.637 --> 00:22:12.130\nthat would allow us to\ntitle case any string.\n\n333\n00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.510\nBecause we've ignored,\nwe have some assumptions.\n\n334\n00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.065\nAnd I do wanna emphasize,\n\n335\n00:22:17.065 --> 00:22:20.680\nhaving assumptions is okay as\nlong as you're aware of them.\n\n336\n00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.755\nThis is not the most robust thing,\nbut it allows us to think, okay,\n\n337\n00:22:24.755 --> 00:22:28.030\nI'm getting this text, how do I do this?\n\n338\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.790\nOkay, I'm thinking through this process,\nand\n\n339\n00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.090\nthen the rest of it just kind of fell out.\n\n340\n00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.010\nWe made it simple, and then we go,\nokay, I know how to do this.\n\n341\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.340\nWell, how do you do it for a bunch?\n\n342\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.300\nWell, I can split it up and\nput them together.\n\n343\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.700\nYeah, that's it.\n\n344\n00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.920\nSo, now that we have this plan, I think\nwe're actually ready to implement this but\n\n345\n00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.511\nI don't know if we're gonna\ndo it in this episode,\n\n346\n00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:52.372\nVonne.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I know that there's more to come\n\n347\n00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:56.040\nthen, but I just wanna say I'm\nfeeling better about this.\n\n348\n00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.810\nI feel when we started this series\nI was a little amped up and\n\n349\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.530\nI couldn't get my brain wrapped\naround just taking it slow.\n\n350\n00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.940\nSo I'm feeling pretty good, and hopefully\nyou all are feeling pretty good, but\n\n351\n00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.425\nwe are going to wrap this one up and\nthere's more to come, so signing off for\n\n352\n00:23:11.425 --> 00:23:13.910\nDevProTV I've been your host Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n353\n00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.230\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n",

DevProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:18.894\nI'm your host Vonne Smith and\n\n4\n00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:22.524\nwe're back with more on our\nalgorithmic problem solving series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:27.484\nAnd we are going to be doing some\nCesar cipher detective planning stuff,\n\n6\n00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:32.460\n[LAUGH] and here to help us is\nMr.Justin Dennison, and how are you today?\n\n7\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.310\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.840\nAfter hearing that I'm doing better.\n\n9\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.257\nHow are you Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm good.\n\n10\n00:00:38.257 --> 00:00:42.790\nAt first when I saw this I'm like, et tu,\nbrute, and all these other things, and\n\n11\n00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.380\nthen I'm like, no seriously, what is this?\n\n12\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.887\n[LAUGH] And you had to explain it to me\nbefore the show, and I'm like, yeah, that.\n\n13\n00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:54.484\nAnd I just remember different games\nwhen I was growing up and code cracking.\n\n14\n00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:59.352\nSo, it all makes sense to me now, but\nI will tell you I was a little off\n\n15\n00:00:59.352 --> 00:01:03.640\nmy game when you first put this\npiece of paper infront of me.\n\n16\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.150\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n17\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.880\nthis has many names and sometimes, we even\ncounted this they didn't even realize it.\n\n18\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.190\nIf you have watched an iconic movie there\nis one scene at the movie where you have\n\n19\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.160\nkind of this little decorder ring.\n\n20\n00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.464\nThat's probably a Caesar cipher or\n\n21\n00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:20.788\na rotational cipher.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah as soon as you started running I'm\n\n22\n00:01:20.788 --> 00:01:22.220\nlike, drink more Ovaltine.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.304\n&gt;&gt; And now I'm like, I totally understand.\n\n24\n00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:26.956\nAnd yeah, so you brought it back to me and\n\n25\n00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:29.030\nnow I totally get it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n26\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.440\nthat's ultimately what we're gonna do.\n\n27\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.380\nAnd it seems like a trivial task.\n\n28\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.110\nRight, let me apply the Caesar cipher.\n\n29\n00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.078\nBut there's a few things, maybe you\ndon't know what a Caesar cipher is.\n\n30\n00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:41.600\nLike I said, it goes by many names.\n\n31\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.590\nThat's what I'm gonna call it just because\nthat's my most familiarity with it,\n\n32\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.138\nbut we're being a loosey-goosey there.\n\n33\n00:01:51.138 --> 00:01:54.790\nSo we're gonna talk about what it is, part\nof that's gonna be in the drawing phase,\n\n34\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.030\nand then we're gonna kind of think about,\nhow can I shift this so that it works?\n\n35\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.530\nAll right?\n\n36\n00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.190\nNow, let's talk about what it is, right?\n\n37\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.590\nSo let's say I have a word,\nfeed, F- E- E- D.\n\n38\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.240\nWell, okay that makes sense.\n\n39\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.100\nIf I shifted all of those letters\nto the right one position,\n\n40\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.170\nwith the respect of\nplaces in the alphabet.\n\n41\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.040\nSo right, what comes after F?\n\n42\n00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.130\nG, so the F would become a G,\nthe E would become an F,\n\n43\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.521\nthe other E would also become F,\nand a D would become an E.\n\n44\n00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:29.930\nSo I would shift all those one, and\n\n45\n00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.320\nthen we'd have something that\ndoesn't look like a word.\n\n46\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.600\nFull disclosure, this is not real secure.\n\n47\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.220\nThis is just for fun and games.\n\n48\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.520\nDon't actually use this.\n\n49\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.300\nI can't emphasize that enough,\npeople are like gosh, it's real secure.\n\n50\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.390\nIt's not, it's very prone to all kinds\nof things like frequency analysis and\n\n51\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.025\nactually just brute\nforcing kind of things.\n\n52\n00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:50.270\nRight, if you know how to program,\n\n53\n00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.890\nyou could actually brute force all\nof these files of all combinations,\n\n54\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.700\nso kind of crazy there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n55\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.390\nwhile you're talking of it's known\nby different names and everything.\n\n56\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.709\nI did a quick little\noogli-googling searching and\n\n57\n00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.740\nyeah it was saying that Julius Caesar\nused it in his private correspondence.\n\n58\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.560\nSo he was using it as like, I don't\nwant you to know what I'm trying to say.\n\n59\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.680\nHere's the secret code, so\nit looks like a bunch of gobbledygook.\n\n60\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.583\nBt it actually mean something.\n&gt;&gt; And well, it's not secure, so\n\n61\n00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:21.840\ndon't do that.\n\n62\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.930\nBut yeah, it does look like\na bunch of nothing, right?\n\n63\n00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.338\nJust looks like a bunch of random text.\n\n64\n00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:32.084\nOur main goal is actually to build\na function that takes a string,\n\n65\n00:03:32.084 --> 00:03:35.550\nsome text, and\nthe appropriate shift, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.785\nSo now, it's actually getting\na little more complicated,\n\n67\n00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.248\nbecause we have two\npossible variables here.\n\n68\n00:03:40.248 --> 00:03:44.550\nAnd we're gonna try to keep\nit as simple as possible, and\n\n69\n00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.010\nthen we're gonna get out cipher text.\n\n70\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.033\nSo I have the plain text and\nthe actual shift number, and\n\n71\n00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:52.007\nthen I get out cipher text.\n\n72\n00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:56.472\nWe're gonna start with, we're just gonna\nbe doodling, kind of free drawing.\n\n73\n00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.860\nAnd then go, well wait a minute,\nwhat if I arrange it in this way?\n\n74\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.920\nAnd this is to show you that\nsometimes changing your mental model\n\n75\n00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.980\ncan help you go, I see what is there.\n\n76\n00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.740\nFull disclosure,\nthis is not an original idea of mine.\n\n77\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.890\nI'm not trading mark but if you haven't\nseen it, well, you better buckle up.\n\n78\n00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.480\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nthe screen here, and what are we gonna do?\n\n79\n00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.469\nWell, as always, we're gonna start\nwith a little bit of drawing.\n\n80\n00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.270\nNow, I could sit here and\nwrite ABCDE all the way through Z.\n\n81\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.260\nThat sounds incredibly boring.\n\n82\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.920\nAnd actually,\ndoesn't add anything that I can tell.\n\n83\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.570\nSo let's think of it this way.\n\n84\n00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.660\nLet's say that I have feed,\n\n85\n00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.770\nand I already said if I shift\nall of those one, right?\n\n86\n00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.530\nSo I'm gonna use a little letter here,\nn=1.\n\n87\n00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:55.147\nSo the n and the shift number and\nthis would be gffe.\n\n88\n00:04:55.147 --> 00:04:59.277\nNow, if I saw this on the page, you go,\nthat's weird, but the English language,\n\n89\n00:04:59.277 --> 00:05:02.600\nif you're an English,\nactually has a set of rules.\n\n90\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.400\nSee these fs side by side,\nthat's probably a pretty good indicator,\n\n91\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.340\nthat's more than likely a val, what is the\nmost common val in the English language?\n\n92\n00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.497\nWell that's e, so then you go okay,\nwell f goes to e,\n\n93\n00:05:14.497 --> 00:05:18.228\nmaybe I'll just try to shift all\nof them back one and then boom.\n\n94\n00:05:18.228 --> 00:05:22.280\nI've already figured out your secret code\nso, just wanna let you know, not secure.\n\n95\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.930\nI don't know if I can say that enough,\nit's not.\n\n96\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.410\nSo let's think about\nthe respective character set,\n\n97\n00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.750\nand that will give us some thought\nprocesses there, all right?\n\n98\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.430\nSo this is just up through f.\n\n99\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.570\nSo that's all I'm going to kind\nof think about, to draw out.\n\n100\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:47.090\nSo I have a, b, c, d, e, and f,\nthese are all the characters I need.\n\n101\n00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.340\nI keep going g, h, i, j, k, l, m,\nn, o, p, those type of things.\n\n102\n00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.730\nAnd well, let's see here what happened?\n\n103\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.740\nWell, I have zero, let's change that.\n\n104\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.305\nI have zero, now,\nI'm counting like a computer just\n\n105\n00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:06.540\nbecause I don't have to go back and\ntranslate it again.\n\n106\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.740\nIt's kind of my default thought process.\n\n107\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.395\nSo let's think about this.\n\n108\n00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:13.300\nWell, number one, our first letter.\n\n109\n00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.100\nI lied, we actually need a g here.\n\n110\n00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.190\nSo our first letter is, well it's here.\n\n111\n00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.940\nWell, what did I do?\n\n112\n00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.460\nI just moved it over here, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.860\nSo I kind of shifted those over.\n\n114\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.560\nSo I said okay from f look at g,\nand then from the e I went up but\n\n115\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.050\nto the right one, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.940\nAnd then the d look to the right one.\n\n117\n00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.270\nSo essentially just look to your right\nthis many places and that's what it is.\n\n118\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.510\nNow, another way to kind of\ndo that is the following.\n\n119\n00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.699\nLet's change this, a, b,\n\n120\n00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.041\nc, d, e, f, g, okay?\n\n121\n00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:07.158\nAnd I am gonna write it again,\na, b, c, c, e, f, g.\n\n122\n00:07:07.158 --> 00:07:12.790\nSo I have two columns and effectively I\nwant to say, okay, where does a go to?\n\n123\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.902\nWell, a goes to b,\nb goes to c, c goes to d,\n\n124\n00:07:17.902 --> 00:07:21.603\nd goes to e, e goes to f, f to g.\n\n125\n00:07:21.603 --> 00:07:23.980\nBut now it gets tricky, where does g go?\n\n126\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.318\nIt this was our entire alphabet,\nI know it's not, what happens to g?\n\n127\n00:07:28.318 --> 00:07:33.800\nWhat if you had age, right?\n\n128\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.670\nSo I could spell that\nwith this character set.\n\n129\n00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.143\nWhat would I do with the g?\n\n130\n00:07:39.143 --> 00:07:42.026\nWell, there is an ampere at a here and\n\n131\n00:07:42.026 --> 00:07:47.140\nampere g here I get to the end,\nI wrap back to the beginning.\n\n132\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.524\nI go all the way back to the beginning.\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of like if you have\n\n133\n00:07:51.524 --> 00:07:56.392\nalmost like an egg carton, and\nyou have space for seven eggs.\n\n134\n00:07:56.392 --> 00:08:01.501\nAnd it has to be in the carton,\nso this has to go to the front,\n\n135\n00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:04.735\nthere's this many blocks.\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly correct.\n\n136\n00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:06.950\nNow this is a shift of one.\n\n137\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.590\nSo actually, let's change this,\nand let's say n is 2.\n\n138\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.830\nSo in green, I'm shifting by two.\n\n139\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.840\nSo now, where does a go?\n\n140\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.020\nIt doesn't go to b anymore,\nit actually goes to c.\n\n141\n00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.123\nDisregard that little detour there.\n\n142\n00:08:20.123 --> 00:08:25.642\nAnd then b goes to, well,\nb goes to d skip c and\n\n143\n00:08:25.642 --> 00:08:31.202\nit goes to d, and then c goes to e,\nd goes to f, right?\n\n144\n00:08:31.202 --> 00:08:33.866\nWell, I skip e, I go to f.\n\n145\n00:08:33.866 --> 00:08:38.550\nE goes to, well, e goes to what?\n\n146\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.790\nWell, it skips f, it goes to g.\n\n147\n00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.500\nWhere does f go?\n\n148\n00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.850\nWell, it doesn't go to g.\n\n149\n00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.479\nIt actually comes up to a.\n\n150\n00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:48.610\nAnd then g goes to be.\n\n151\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.190\nSo notice how much I have to wrap around\nactually is dependent on the shift.\n\n152\n00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.478\nSo I have kind of this\nweird variance here.\n\n153\n00:08:54.478 --> 00:08:55.743\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I keep thinking about\n\n154\n00:08:55.743 --> 00:08:56.380\nthat carton.\n\n155\n00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.763\nEven if you did a n of 4,\nit's like, okay, well then take the,\n\n156\n00:08:59.763 --> 00:09:03.920\nit's like you put them outside the box,\nbut you have to put him back in the box.\n\n157\n00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.240\nSo you just gotta take\nin the same sequence.\n\n158\n00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.643\nAnd I think that's the other thing.\n\n159\n00:09:07.643 --> 00:09:12.070\nIt has to be in the same sequence\nto do this type of shifting.\n\n160\n00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.660\nIt can't just be randomized.\n\n161\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.530\nIt's stay in order, move, and\n\n162\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.320\nthen come back around to the beginning.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n163\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.550\nAnd it's funny that that come back around\nthat you just did, because I think by and\n\n164\n00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.660\nlarge, this is a little easier\nto understand than this.\n\n165\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.487\nI could be wrong, right?\n\n166\n00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:33.310\nThat may be only my opinion.\n\n167\n00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.919\nBut based on Vonne's look,\n\n168\n00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:40.736\nI'm gonna go with no.\n&gt;&gt; The way that\n\n169\n00:09:40.736 --> 00:09:42.660\nwhen you go down in the columns?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.550\n&gt;&gt; No, that totally is getting,\n\n171\n00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.721\nI'm like, no, I'm down with that one, too.\n\n172\n00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:47.619\n[LAUGH] Makes much more sense.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n173\n00:09:47.619 --> 00:09:49.501\nlet's further change your amino model.\n\n174\n00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:55.010\nAnd this one seems more clear\nto me than even the column ones.\n\n175\n00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.870\nBut we'll see, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.590\nSo instead of writing them down and\ndown, whenever I have this kind of,\n\n177\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:07.300\nyou said bring it around,\nthat makes me think of a circle, right?\n\n178\n00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.850\nSo now if I draw a circle like so,\nand I say a, b, c,\n\n179\n00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:19.050\nd, e, f, g, like that,\n\n180\n00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.630\nand then what if I drew an inner circle,\nright?\n\n181\n00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.300\nActually, let's do this.\n\n182\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:33.453\nAn inner circle like this,\na, b, c, d, e, f, g.\n\n183\n00:10:33.453 --> 00:10:36.880\nWell, guess what?\n\n184\n00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.800\nThese are now matched up\njust like the columns were.\n\n185\n00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.840\nBut what if I have a shift of 1?\n\n186\n00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.641\nWell, I would just rotate\nthe inner circle by 1.\n\n187\n00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:50.073\nSo now this is a,\n\n188\n00:10:50.073 --> 00:10:54.500\nb, c, d, e, f, g.\n\n189\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.920\nWell, what about a shift of 2?\n\n190\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.830\nWell, I just rotate it around by 2.\n\n191\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.126\nAnd then what you do is you're mapping.\n\n192\n00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:04.410\nThis column is actually just\nreading from outside to n.\n\n193\n00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:09.460\nSo if you had a little device like this,\nyou got a shift of five, you go.\n\n194\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.272\nThere we go.\n\n195\n00:11:10.272 --> 00:11:14.460\nAnd I find this model very easy, and\nyou can actually get little printouts and\n\n196\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.580\nyou could build this\nwith a piece of paper.\n\n197\n00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.591\nRight?\nA couple of printouts, and\n\n198\n00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:19.564\nyou can just put them together.\n\n199\n00:11:19.564 --> 00:11:20.691\nYou could build something like this.\n\n200\n00:11:20.691 --> 00:11:22.681\nI always wanted to build\nsomething like this out of wood,\n\n201\n00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.020\njust because I think it would be fine.\n\n202\n00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.820\nBut it's essentially like a combo lock.\n&gt;&gt; Or you can wait for\n\n203\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.640\nit to show up in your mail box, and\nthen wait for the radio show, and\n\n204\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.455\nthen you have to drink more Ovaltine.\n\n205\n00:11:31.455 --> 00:11:33.937\nThat's a movie reference if\nnone of you are getting it.\n\n206\n00:11:33.937 --> 00:11:37.078\n[LAUGH] But yeah,\nthe little Annie Decoder Ring,\n\n207\n00:11:37.078 --> 00:11:37.887\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep.\n\n208\n00:11:37.887 --> 00:11:39.088\n&gt;&gt; And he was waiting for\n\n209\n00:11:39.088 --> 00:11:40.288\nit to just go ahead and\n\n210\n00:11:40.288 --> 00:11:44.157\nuse that ring once he was giving a set\nof numbers to just turn the dial,\n\n211\n00:11:44.157 --> 00:11:48.407\nand then it matches up the letters.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not entirely sure though that\n\n212\n00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:50.542\nthe movie were A Christmas Story.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:52.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you're not like, what is that movie?\n\n214\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.214\nIt's A Christmas story.\n\n215\n00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.901\nI'm not entirely sure it's\nletters to letters, but\n\n216\n00:11:56.901 --> 00:11:58.830\nthe same thought process applies.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n217\n00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.830\nit's just like my cultural\nreference of like,\n\n218\n00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.400\nyeah, that's what I can relate it too.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n219\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.430\nNow, it gets a little tricky because\n\n220\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.240\nI actually have a couple\nof different drawings.\n\n221\n00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.370\nIf you ever had multiple\ndrawings like you're\n\n222\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.320\ntrying to explore the problem space,\nyou go, which one do I use?\n\n223\n00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:25.060\nWell, I tend to pick the drawing where\nI can think of a physical, this is me.\n\n224\n00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.163\nOr I can think of a physical device\nthat I can manipulate, right?\n\n225\n00:12:29.163 --> 00:12:34.370\nDepending on spatial reasoning and things,\nif I can think of how I manipulate it,\n\n226\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.000\nit's actually easier for me to visualize.\n\n227\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.850\nIf you find the columns work better for\nyou, draw the columns.\n\n228\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.590\nIf you actually find this easier to\nreason about, do that, all right?\n\n229\n00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:45.300\nYou can just count.\n\n230\n00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.490\nIt's essentially like a number line.\n\n231\n00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.180\nBut now,\nI need to make a list what do I know.\n\n232\n00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:52.680\nRight?\n\n233\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.140\nWell, let's see.\n\n234\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.420\nWell, the letters are strings, right?\n\n235\n00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:02.080\nYou can think of this as,\nit's just one big string ABCDEFG.\n\n236\n00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.180\nSo well, we have our string stuff.\n\n237\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.974\nSo string as a sequence, and\nit's a sequence of characters.\n\n238\n00:13:10.974 --> 00:13:15.222\nAnd interestingly enough, our alphabet\nis a sequence of characters a, b, c.\n\n239\n00:13:15.222 --> 00:13:16.360\nYou always say them in order.\n\n240\n00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.979\nFor the most part,\nI guess you can say I'm backwards.\n\n241\n00:13:20.979 --> 00:13:24.111\nAnd then the same things apply, right?\n\n242\n00:13:24.111 --> 00:13:27.135\nOur zero-based, zero-indexed.\n\n243\n00:13:27.135 --> 00:13:31.887\nAnd I know some of you are like, this is\nalways the same when it comes to strings.\n\n244\n00:13:31.887 --> 00:13:33.200\nIt is.\n\n245\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.500\nBy writing them down, I can slowly add\nto the list as I discover new things,\n\n246\n00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.100\nand I don't have to think about,\nnow, what do I know about strings?\n\n247\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.240\nI just look at my list and go,\nyeah, that's the part I need.\n\n248\n00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.630\nI know this seems like minutia,\n\n249\n00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.520\nbut I don't have to think\nabout these facts anymore.\n\n250\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.481\nJust go zero-index.\n\n251\n00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:53.285\nYeah, it's zero-index.\n\n252\n00:13:53.285 --> 00:13:55.876\nI remember that now.\n&gt;&gt; We were just talking about this.\n\n253\n00:13:55.876 --> 00:14:00.583\nIt's like for\nsomebody like me who's just starting out,\n\n254\n00:14:00.583 --> 00:14:05.194\nlike the repetitive nature and\njust keeping on doing it,\n\n255\n00:14:05.194 --> 00:14:08.651\nit's gonna drill in to my head better, and\n\n256\n00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:13.189\nI'm gonna be a better coder or\nbetter anything from it.\n\n257\n00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:14.470\nIt's the learning process.\n\n258\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.980\nYou have to keep reiterating and\n\n259\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:16.889\nredoing it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n260\n00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:21.390\nAnd to go along with that reiterations,\nwell, let's continue on.\n\n261\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.680\nBut you're absolutely correct, Vonne.\n\n262\n00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.280\nPracticing these small things over and\nover, I'm not saying you have to memorize,\n\n263\n00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.040\nbut just going through the process,\nwhat do I know?\n\n264\n00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.990\nNow you'll probably end up\nknowing a lot about strings,\n\n265\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.590\nbecause we've done a lot with strings.\n\n266\n00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:41.610\nBut behaviors, well, I can find,\nI can replace, I can get substrings or\n\n267\n00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:48.285\nslices, I can get individual characters,\n\n268\n00:14:48.285 --> 00:14:52.385\nI noticed I'm writing more and\nmore uphill.\n\n269\n00:14:52.385 --> 00:14:58.739\nI also know that the last index,\nIs length- 1.\n\n270\n00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:08.850\nAnd well, that means that our\nstrings has a length, right?\n\n271\n00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.440\nSo, what's the length of our characters?\n\n272\n00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.205\nIt's 26, right?\n\n273\n00:15:12.205 --> 00:15:13.662\nThere's 26 letters in\nthe English alphabet.\n\n274\n00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:17.883\nIf you're watching this in another\ncountry, this probably still applies\n\n275\n00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:21.305\nunless you do not have necessarily\na defined character set.\n\n276\n00:15:21.305 --> 00:15:24.830\nThere are some languages\nthat this kinda breaks down.\n\n277\n00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.614\nWhat I mean is you have\na very large character set.\n\n278\n00:15:28.614 --> 00:15:35.060\nYou could probably still do it, it would\njust be time prohibitive, so to speak.\n\n279\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.150\nSo there's a last index.\n\n280\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.474\nI think what else do I know?\n\n281\n00:15:40.474 --> 00:15:43.500\nI'm actually going to write this.\n\n282\n00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.845\nThis isn't string related.\n\n283\n00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:49.625\nIt's kind of circular, right?\n\n284\n00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:50.230\nIn nature.\n\n285\n00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.210\nNow, what do I mean by that?\n\n286\n00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.790\nWe didn't look at it in this first\nexample, but if I wanted to take the g and\n\n287\n00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.175\nmove it, it would actually come down here.\n\n288\n00:15:59.175 --> 00:16:02.868\nWell, the same thing happened\nin our columns, right?\n\n289\n00:16:02.868 --> 00:16:06.598\nOur little g come up to here\ndepending on our shift.\n\n290\n00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:09.089\nRight?\nIt wrapped around the end Vonne's egg\n\n291\n00:16:09.089 --> 00:16:12.288\ncarton we moved them out and\nthen we brought them over, and\n\n292\n00:16:12.288 --> 00:16:14.001\nthen we even drew the circuit.\n\n293\n00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:16.523\nSo it's kind of circular.\n\n294\n00:16:16.523 --> 00:16:21.349\nNow the reason I say write that\ndown is circular sometimes tells us\n\n295\n00:16:21.349 --> 00:16:26.190\nabout what types of operations we\nshould keep in our mind, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.288\nOkay, what's next?\n\n297\n00:16:31.723 --> 00:16:35.628\nAll right, what's next?\n\n298\n00:16:35.628 --> 00:16:40.184\nI need to be able, let's say,\nI need to be able to,\n\n299\n00:16:41.844 --> 00:16:45.713\nShift characters,\n\n300\n00:16:49.458 --> 00:16:58.690\nTo the right, Let's say middle characters,\nso let's not worry about the end.\n\n301\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.043\nSo the middle characters, so if I can\njust shift them to the right or the left,\n\n302\n00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:02.569\nall right?\n\n303\n00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:08.918\nI need to figure out how\nto wrap the end characters,\n\n304\n00:17:15.283 --> 00:17:19.848\nAnd then also what about if n=13 or\n\n305\n00:17:19.848 --> 00:17:25.455\nn=10, how do I handle different shifts?\n\n306\n00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.404\nRight, how do I handle different shifts?\n\n307\n00:17:34.404 --> 00:17:38.639\nSo I can shift by one,\nby two, by three, by four.\n\n308\n00:17:38.639 --> 00:17:42.230\nFun story, if you shift by 13 twice,\nit's like you never shifted.\n\n309\n00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.920\nSo these actually,\nit's like [SOUND] all the way around.\n\n310\n00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.392\n&gt;&gt; And I was just gonna say,\n\n311\n00:17:47.392 --> 00:17:50.199\nthe 13 would be on a 26-letter character,\n\n312\n00:17:50.199 --> 00:17:53.440\nnot back to just like\nthe a through g that we were doing.\n\n313\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.333\nBecause if you did a shift with 13,\nit's almost like you're,\n\n314\n00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:58.749\nI mean I guess you could, right?\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n\n315\n00:17:58.749 --> 00:18:01.052\nSo if we did a shift of 13,\nhow many characters are here?\n\n316\n00:18:01.052 --> 00:18:03.260\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n317\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.100\nSo we'd go around one full time,\nand then six more.\n\n318\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.808\nIt's the same as a shift of 6.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's where I was like,\n\n319\n00:18:09.808 --> 00:18:12.519\neven if you had a character\nlength of five and\n\n320\n00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:15.357\nyou just shift to 13 it still applies.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n321\n00:18:15.357 --> 00:18:17.025\n&gt;&gt; It's just going around in the circle.\n\n322\n00:18:17.025 --> 00:18:19.034\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so I'm not gonna say it but\n\n323\n00:18:19.034 --> 00:18:22.018\nthere's actually a little\nbit of math in here.\n\n324\n00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:25.430\nYou don't, the circle always starts\nback and you go one time around.\n\n325\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.319\nIt's like you never started and\nyou never win anyway, okay?\n\n326\n00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:31.000\nSo by doing that, you know what?\n\n327\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.824\nThis part, this seems hard.\n\n328\n00:18:32.824 --> 00:18:34.370\nHow do I handle different ones?\n\n329\n00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.086\nI'm thinking if I know how to do this,\nright?\n\n330\n00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:40.730\nLet's say how do I shift a character?\n\n331\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.337\nAnd then if I can figure out how to\ndo this, and let's even say further.\n\n332\n00:18:47.337 --> 00:18:52.622\nLet's figure out how to do this for\nN as 1, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:52.622 --> 00:18:58.050\nI could do this for N as one and\nthen effectively, I can do this.\n\n334\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.530\nSo I'm hard coded, I'm holding one\nof the things that can change,\n\n335\n00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.412\nI'm holding it constant to\nfigure out the other parts.\n\n336\n00:19:04.412 --> 00:19:07.932\nAnd then I go, okay, well let me now\nchange this to a variable dock and\n\n337\n00:19:07.932 --> 00:19:09.040\nkind of tinker with.\n\n338\n00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.851\nIt's like the volume on your radio.\n\n339\n00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:12.065\nActually do people still?\n\n340\n00:19:12.065 --> 00:19:14.501\nThe volume on your cell phone,\nvolume on your computer,\n\n341\n00:19:14.501 --> 00:19:18.680\nwhatever your volume of choice is,\nright, you're kind of tinkering with it.\n\n342\n00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.907\nBut while you're messing with bass or\ntreble,\n\n343\n00:19:20.907 --> 00:19:22.917\nmaybe you don't touch the volume, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:22.917 --> 00:19:24.060\nSo effectively that's what we're doing.\n\n345\n00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.615\nSo we've changed the problem, right?\n\n346\n00:19:28.615 --> 00:19:30.358\nSo we've changed the problem a little bit.\n\n347\n00:19:30.358 --> 00:19:31.780\nWe know what's next.\n\n348\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.980\nAll these things are next,\nbut I say you know what,\n\n349\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.490\nlet's not worry about the n part,\nthe variable shift.\n\n350\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.910\nLet's just worry about how do I\nmove things one to the other?\n\n351\n00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.483\nAnd we've explored that a little\nbit right up here, right?\n\n352\n00:19:45.483 --> 00:19:46.820\nHow do I move this?\n\n353\n00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:53.580\nEspecially if I come back in here and,\nactually let's change this to,\n\n354\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:58.098\nnot light blue,\nthere we go, orange, right?\n\n355\n00:19:58.098 --> 00:20:02.771\nSo this is 0,1, 2,\n\n356\n00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:08.155\n3, 4, 5, 6, right?\n\n357\n00:20:08.155 --> 00:20:13.810\nWe started with a 0 through 6 up here,\nbut then what happens here?\n\n358\n00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:22.326\nWell, if I also have 0,\nwell g went from 6 to 0,\n\n359\n00:20:22.326 --> 00:20:28.486\na went from 0 to 1,\nB went from one to two.\n\n360\n00:20:28.486 --> 00:20:32.005\nAnd all I'm doing is looking at the outer,\nreading the inner in blue,\n\n361\n00:20:32.005 --> 00:20:35.540\nwhich is a shift of one, and\nthen seeing how those two indexes change.\n\n362\n00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.952\nActually the adding the shift is\njust a modification of where it lies\n\n363\n00:20:41.952 --> 00:20:43.500\nin the index, okay?\n\n364\n00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.740\nSo I think that's gonna work for us.\n\n365\n00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:52.381\nLet's go down here and\ndraw a little bit more and say A-B-C-D.\n\n366\n00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:56.995\nWe have,\nI'm just choosing a subset of characters,\n\n367\n00:20:56.995 --> 00:21:01.606\nsay we shift by one,\nI'm not gonna draw a circle, but\n\n368\n00:21:01.606 --> 00:21:06.749\nthinking of turning it by one and\nI have D-A-B-C, okay?\n\n369\n00:21:06.749 --> 00:21:09.139\nLook, that's my inner one.\n\n370\n00:21:09.139 --> 00:21:14.285\nSo I move the b over one, the c over one,\nthe d over here and then the a over one.\n\n371\n00:21:14.285 --> 00:21:19.480\nSo if I now label the indexes 0, 1, 2,\n\n372\n00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:25.872\n3, 0, 1, 2, 3, well, a went from 0 to 1.\n\n373\n00:21:25.872 --> 00:21:26.760\nYou went from one to two.\n\n374\n00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:33.296\nSo if I could somehow rearrange, right?\n\n375\n00:21:33.296 --> 00:21:35.771\nOr, say, you know what?\n\n376\n00:21:35.771 --> 00:21:40.345\nI wanna rearrange this set\nby pairing them up with\n\n377\n00:21:40.345 --> 00:21:45.040\ntheir numbers and\nthen adding one to them, okay?\n\n378\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:51.315\nSo how does one go about doing that?\n\n379\n00:21:51.315 --> 00:21:56.064\nSo let's keep the original set here.\n\n380\n00:21:56.064 --> 00:21:57.103\nSo this is the original.\n\n381\n00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.290\nThat is not an a, and\nthat is not an array search.\n\n382\n00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.125\nThere we go.\n\n383\n00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:08.190\nSo let's keep the original, okay?\n\n384\n00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.039\nAnd here's what I'm thinking.\n\n385\n00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:16.167\nIf we keep the original,\nI'm gonna construct a new alphabet,\n\n386\n00:22:16.167 --> 00:22:21.760\na new alphabet, where I go,\nokay, I'm gonna shift by one.\n\n387\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.872\nSo I'm going to go find,\n\n388\n00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:31.870\nOne more than whatever letter it is.\n\n389\n00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.449\nSo let's say we have bad.\n\n390\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.220\nBad, I'm not gonna go flowchart-y cuz this\nkinda gets a little more fluid than that.\n\n391\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.325\nSo here's my original one.\n\n392\n00:22:45.325 --> 00:22:47.380\nSo bad, where does bad live?\n\n393\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.108\nWell, it lives right here.\n\n394\n00:22:49.108 --> 00:22:53.794\nSo I find where it is in the original,\nokay?\n\n395\n00:22:53.794 --> 00:22:58.972\nAnd what I mean is it's an index-1,\nand I know that we're\n\n396\n00:22:58.972 --> 00:23:04.950\nonly considering N as 1, and so\nbad, well, what do I wanna do?\n\n397\n00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:11.540\nI want to go to index-2,\nwhich is c, right?\n\n398\n00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:16.023\nSo if I go to C, well, how do I get there?\n\n399\n00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.917\nSo I add one to that and then look it up.\n\n400\n00:23:20.917 --> 00:23:25.700\nSo my construction of this new alphabet\nis actually just using the original one.\n\n401\n00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.074\nSo add to it and then go look it up again.\n\n402\n00:23:28.074 --> 00:23:30.370\nSo find this character.\n\n403\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.030\nSo what do I do?\n\n404\n00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:37.867\nFind position, Add 1,\n\n405\n00:23:37.867 --> 00:23:42.807\nand then find letter at new position, and\n\n406\n00:23:42.807 --> 00:23:45.779\nthat's behind my head.\n\n407\n00:23:53.749 --> 00:23:58.159\nSo using that original one, I can go,\nokay, B is the index of one.\n\n408\n00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:00.842\nBut one more than that,\nwhat is in that one.\n\n409\n00:24:00.842 --> 00:24:02.050\nLet's see, okay?\n\n410\n00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.198\nNow, that relies on their ordering.\n\n411\n00:24:04.198 --> 00:24:08.770\nSo if I did that, I'm gonna say,\nwell b is there and I then I get c.\n\n412\n00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:09.909\nWhat about a?\n\n413\n00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:14.130\nWell, a is a zero but I'm gonna add one,\nwell, what's at the first position?\n\n414\n00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:19.453\nThat's b, so this will become c,b\n\n415\n00:24:19.453 --> 00:24:23.300\nand then we get here to d.\n\n416\n00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:29.210\nIf we're looking at just these\ncharacter set, where is d?\n\n417\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.380\nIt's at three, but\nwe only have four characters.\n\n418\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.110\nWhat do we know?\n\n419\n00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.650\nWe know that the last index\nis actually the minus one.\n\n420\n00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:43.133\nNow if we had all 26 characters,\nthis would be 25.\n\n421\n00:24:43.133 --> 00:24:45.100\nSo this d is a book end.\n\n422\n00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:52.440\nWe have effectively figured out this part,\nwe're now onto this part.\n\n423\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.770\n&gt;&gt; Justin, you're making that weird face,\n\n424\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:58.210\nbecause I'm over here doing all sorts of\nweird faces, kind of going, I got it.\n\n425\n00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.830\nWait, I lost it, I got it, I lost it.\n\n426\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.645\nCuz, okay add a one.\n\n427\n00:25:03.665 --> 00:25:08.285\nOnce I got to this part, I'm like,\nbut three plus one is four.\n\n428\n00:25:08.285 --> 00:25:11.895\nThere's no four,\nhow are we getting back to the beginning?\n\n429\n00:25:11.895 --> 00:25:13.135\nSee, we're at the point\nwhere we're wrapping.\n\n430\n00:25:13.135 --> 00:25:17.981\nAnd I'm almost there, so I'm hoping\nthe next thing you're gonna say is\n\n431\n00:25:17.981 --> 00:25:21.062\njust gonna snap it all into place for me.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n432\n00:25:21.062 --> 00:25:24.312\nI make no promises because this is\nkinda one of those esoteric things.\n\n433\n00:25:24.312 --> 00:25:27.322\nI want you to recall back to\nmaybe third grade, fourth grade,\n\n434\n00:25:27.322 --> 00:25:31.752\nwhere before you learned how to\nlong division, you just said,\n\n435\n00:25:31.752 --> 00:25:35.300\nwell it goes into this three\ntimes with a remainder.\n\n436\n00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.840\nYou've heard of this a couple of times,\nand then,\n\n437\n00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.440\nwe kinda push it out of our mind.\n\n438\n00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.120\nNow math major, I actually ended up\ndoing this a whole grade of things.\n\n439\n00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.560\nBut we're gonna have to use that because\nI'm gonna use kind of a slick trick.\n\n440\n00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah cuz you had to put the r and\n\n441\n00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.470\nthen the number.\n\n442\n00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.361\nYeah they told you don't do that anymore\ncuz then you get into decimals and\n\n443\n00:25:56.361 --> 00:25:57.060\nfractions.\n\n444\n00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.520\nAnd I'm starting to get hot flashes\nbecause it's like, whoo, I wasn't heard.\n\n445\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're not gonna go that far.\n\n446\n00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:11.210\nAll you need to know is, a number can\nbe divided evenly or it can't, okay?\n\n447\n00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.760\nSo if we add one as you said, right?\n\n448\n00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.850\nAnd the only reason we're doing one,\n\n449\n00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.090\nI just wanna remind everybody is we're\nassuming that we have a shift of one.\n\n450\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.910\nSo 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3,\nbut 3 goes to 4 but\n\n451\n00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.060\n4 is not in here cuz we\nonly have four characters.\n\n452\n00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.970\nIt's actually outside of the index\ncuz the index is actually one\n\n453\n00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.640\nless than the length.\n\n454\n00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.370\nHowever, what if we did\nsomething like this?\n\n455\n00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.430\nIf @ end, all right?\n\n456\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.259\nWhat do I mean by if @ end?\n\n457\n00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:41.370\nSo, still find a position.\n\n458\n00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.120\nSo find a position.\n\n459\n00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.250\nJust gonna circle that, so find position.\n\n460\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:52.730\nAnd so for d, I come up here to d,\nand it's right there, right?\n\n461\n00:26:54.150 --> 00:27:00.354\nOkay, and then I add 1, and\nthat 1's only because we're assuming 1.\n\n462\n00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:09.710\nAnd really, if let's call this new,\nnew position right?\n\n463\n00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.330\nSo if new, is greater than,\n\n464\n00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:21.965\nwell actually the length, and\nwe need to do something, right?\n\n465\n00:27:21.965 --> 00:27:24.730\nWe actually need to go to the other end.\n\n466\n00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.460\nSo what I mean is we're\nkind of wanna go over here,\n\n467\n00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.710\nbut really we just want this\nspot to point right there.\n\n468\n00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.510\nSo how many spots do I\nneed to come around?\n\n469\n00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:41.440\nI need to go one more,\nbut here's the trick.\n\n470\n00:27:43.213 --> 00:27:50.540\nThis length, right, so the length, Is 4.\n\n471\n00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.360\nWhat is 4 divided by 4?\n\n472\n00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.590\nWell, it's 1.\n\n473\n00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.190\nWhat is the remainder?\n\n474\n00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.060\nZero.\n\n475\n00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.260\nWhat is 5 divided by 4?\n\n476\n00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.200\nWell it's also 1 with the remainder of 1.\n\n477\n00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:13.005\nSo it goes into 5 one time equally,\nand it has 1 remainder.\n\n478\n00:28:13.005 --> 00:28:15.385\nVonne is giving me some\nhorrible stink eye.\n\n479\n00:28:15.385 --> 00:28:17.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz you're sitting there\n\n480\n00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:22.610\nlaughing cuz I'm lik okay, yeah, right,\n\n481\n00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.510\nit click, and I almost wanna be like, duh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n482\n00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.164\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n483\n00:28:28.164 --> 00:28:31.690\nthat's it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n484\n00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.800\nthe reason I'm using this slick\ntrick is notice how I started this\n\n485\n00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.050\nif new is greater than the length\nI wanna wrap back around.\n\n486\n00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:41.565\nWell, really if I list these out,\nright start kind of go wait a minute,\n\n487\n00:28:41.565 --> 00:28:43.610\nit's kind of like a remainder.\n\n488\n00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.887\nNotice this is 0, this is 1, this is 2,\n\n489\n00:28:46.887 --> 00:28:53.680\nthat's only after it's went to the end\none time, that's what that means.\n\n490\n00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.220\nSo I went through the end one time,\nand then\n\n491\n00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.120\nI need to come back to the zero at one.\n&gt;&gt; And this is the one where you could do\n\n492\n00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.530\n13 divided by four and\nthat's that many times around.\n\n493\n00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:08.709\nBut you're still gonna have the same\nremainder for however many times you loop\n\n494\n00:29:08.709 --> 00:29:15.230\nthrough it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so 13 divided by 4 is what?\n\n495\n00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:19.390\nIt's 3 with a remainder of 1.\n\n496\n00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.751\nSo if we can utilize this\nremainder as part of our logic, so\n\n497\n00:29:23.751 --> 00:29:29.900\nnot only are we adding the shift, but\nwe're going to, it's called the modulus.\n\n498\n00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:34.740\nIt's represented by the percent sign.\n\n499\n00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.990\nThis is called the modulus operator.\n\n500\n00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:44.020\nFor our purposes, you're gonna think\nof it as the remainder operator, okay?\n\n501\n00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.300\nIt's gonna give me the remainder.\n\n502\n00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.200\nSo let's think about this.\n\n503\n00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.290\nSo, if I add one that's two.\n\n504\n00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.850\nWhat's two divided by four,\nwith zero with a remainder of two?\n\n505\n00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.330\nI still get two.\n\n506\n00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.550\nWhat's two to three?\n\n507\n00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.121\nWell, that's three.\nThree divided by four, okay,\n\n508\n00:30:00.121 --> 00:30:04.960\nthat's zero because you can't\ndivide three evenly by four.\n\n509\n00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.740\nThat's what that means.\n\n510\n00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.930\nMod the length which is four.\n\n511\n00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:12.726\nWhat's three minus four?\nWell, the remainder is three, so\n\n512\n00:30:12.726 --> 00:30:14.850\nI still get three.\n\n513\n00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.330\nWhat's three plus one?\n\n514\n00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.830\nWell, that's four.\n\n515\n00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.750\nModulus the length.\n\n516\n00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.060\nWell four divided by four as\nwe've already seen is one, but\n\n517\n00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.190\nthe remainder is zero which\ngives me that index of zero.\n\n518\n00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.610\nNow, I wanted to show you this one because\nthis is one of those slick math tricks.\n\n519\n00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:35.980\nIf you wanted to use just if's and\nkind of wrap around, you can do it.\n\n520\n00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.930\nI will tell you,\n\n521\n00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:41.920\nthe if logic ends up being actually\na lot more work than one would think.\n\n522\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.170\nThis only occurs because you cannot\npoke at it and go, well wait a minute,\n\n523\n00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.080\nthis is one goes over here and\nit's a lot of drawing, right?\n\n524\n00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.790\nNow, the modulus operator\nis gonna come in handy, and\n\n525\n00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.790\nthe modulus is going\nto link to the length.\n\n526\n00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:03.010\nSo add one, mod the length, which is four.\n\n527\n00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:03.880\nWell, you know what?\n\n528\n00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.673\nWhat if our shift was two,\nlet's try that with b, right?\n\n529\n00:31:11.673 --> 00:31:16.575\nThis works I think we\nare on the right track and\n\n530\n00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:23.050\nwe could probably actually\nstart trying to code this.\n\n531\n00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.120\nWhat is b?\n\n532\n00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.535\nWhich is one, plus two now,\ncuz we're at a shift of two.\n\n533\n00:31:29.535 --> 00:31:35.310\nWell,that's 3 mod 4, that's still 3, okay?\n\n534\n00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:36.980\nSo b, that was an inter one,\n\n535\n00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.860\nwe didn't have a large enough shift,\nbut what about c?\n\n536\n00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.480\nWell, what's c plus 2?\n\n537\n00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.440\nWell that's 4.\n\n538\n00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.700\nWhat's 4 divided by 4?\n\n539\n00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.040\nWhat's the remainder of that?\n\n540\n00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.240\nMod 4.\n\n541\n00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.170\nThat actually sends us back to zero,\nwhich is where it should be.\n\n542\n00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:59.300\nSo I think by trying to think\nabout how to handle this wrapping,\n\n543\n00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:05.010\nwe inadvertently kind of just taken\ncare of the variable ends, right?\n\n544\n00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.400\nAnd the reason I say\nthis if logic become if e\n\n545\n00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.190\nis because now that actually\ninvolves in a lot more.\n\n546\n00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.080\nYou have to go, wait a minute I\nneed to back up and come around.\n\n547\n00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:19.696\nThis is substantially easier and I show\nyou this because if you ever have anything\n\n548\n00:32:19.696 --> 00:32:22.870\ncircular, this operator\nprobably gonna come into play.\n\n549\n00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.483\nThis essentially the circular pattern\nwhere you keep going round and round and\n\n550\n00:32:26.483 --> 00:32:27.880\nround and round.\n\n551\n00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.360\nSo you know what?\n\n552\n00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.550\nWe've hit our three check marks and\n\n553\n00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.130\nnow I think we're actually\ngood to try to implement this.\n\n554\n00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.940\nBut I'm looking at the clock, we are\ndefinitely not gonna be able to do it in\n\n555\n00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.133\nthis episode.\n&gt;&gt; Well, cuz when you start talking about\n\n556\n00:32:42.133 --> 00:32:47.475\nmath and division, I definitely got\nscared But that was not that bad.\n\n557\n00:32:47.475 --> 00:32:53.592\n[LAUGH] It was one of those just like\nmy gosh,and I can totally see it.\n\n558\n00:32:53.592 --> 00:32:59.110\nSo all things circular, you harness\nthe good, you bock out the bad.\n\n559\n00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.020\nGood, bad.\n\n560\n00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.380\nAnd I'm feeling pretty good right now,\nso thank you for that, Justin.\n\n561\n00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.262\nThank you, for tuning in.\n\n562\n00:33:04.262 --> 00:33:07.090\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this one.\n\n563\n00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.200\nSigning off for the DevProTV.\n\n564\n00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.980\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n565\n00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.965\n&gt;&gt;

you learn everywhere you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:21.397\nI'm your host Zach Memos for this episode,\nof algorithmic problem solving.\n\n5\n00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:25.704\nThe title of this episode\nis Caesar Cipher Coding.\n\n6\n00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:26.911\nHmm, what's that about?\n\n7\n00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.890\nWell, Justin Dennison's here to tell\nus all about it, aren't you, Justin?\n\n8\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.284\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna try my best and,\nI like how you said hmm,\n\n9\n00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:34.584\nlike we're getting ready\nto have a tasty treat.\n\n10\n00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:36.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think of Caesar salads.\n\n11\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.675\nI have to agree man, I'm sorry.\n\n12\n00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:41.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [SOUND] Caesar salads.\n\n13\n00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:44.365\nNot Julius Caesar and all of the mutiny.\n\n14\n00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:48.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, right this is kind of something\n\n15\n00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.940\nthat, as we saw in the plan,\nthat you've probably done.\n\n16\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.068\nJust a quick overview, if you haven't\nlooked at the planning episode.\n\n17\n00:00:55.068 --> 00:00:59.136\nYou probably did this when you were a kid,\nyou're like, all right,\n\n18\n00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:03.150\nif I take all the a's in my name,\nand I move them three letters over.\n\n19\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.410\nRight?\nSo a, b, c, d.\n\n20\n00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.330\nSo a becomes d, and\nyou move all the other letters over and\n\n21\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.560\nif you get to the end you\nkind of circle back around.\n\n22\n00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.550\n&gt;&gt; Effectively that's what\na Caesar cipher is and\n\n23\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.390\nit looks really secure,\nuntil you realize it's not.\n\n24\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020\n[LAUGH] And someone goes,\nthat says I like cheese right there.\n\n25\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.740\nHow'd you know that?\n\n26\n00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.226\nThose letters aren't even there.\n\n27\n00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:25.502\n&gt;&gt; Well, if they saw that, they'd go,\nthat's a Caesar cipher, wouldn't they?\n\n28\n00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times, yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.234\nPeople go, this looks like\nsome kind of shift cipher, or\n\n30\n00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:33.541\nmaybe even a substitution cipher.\n\n31\n00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:36.400\nBut nonetheless,\nit's a fun little exercise, right?\n\n32\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n33\n00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.740\nreally what we have in\nprogramming is we have this line,\n\n34\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.790\nwe have to try to think about how\nto effectively, make it occur.\n\n35\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.300\nCuz that last little part, the last,\nlike a z, how do you shift a z?\n\n36\n00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.340\nWell, you come back to the beginning,\nand you start moving that way.\n\n37\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.544\nSo how do you do that programmatically?\n\n38\n00:01:55.544 --> 00:01:56.910\nThat's the fun part.\n\n39\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.970\nNow, during this we're gonna probably,\njust for the sake of time,\n\n40\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.446\nand so you don't have to watch me go,\nwhat did I type wrong there?\n\n41\n00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:08.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna keep\n\n42\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.690\nour kind of little testing portions,\n\n43\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.200\nwe're gonna keep those fairly short,\nas far as letters and things.\n\n44\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.880\nBut, keep that in mind,\nthat may mean that you have found things,\n\n45\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.530\nthat I haven't anticipated,\nwhich is not unreasonable, right?\n\n46\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.020\nWe are not perfection here Zach.\n\n47\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n48\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.747\n&gt;&gt; I mean, Zach is, but\nI'm definitely not.\n\n49\n00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:30.010\n&gt;&gt; No, we've all had feet of clay.\n\n50\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.450\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what kind\nof feet clay you're talking\n\n51\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.080\nabout-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n52\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.370\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, let's go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.950\ntake a look at the screen and\nget started with this fun Caesar cipher.\n\n54\n00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.220\nSo I'm in the algorithms folder.\n\n55\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.960\nI have been for this entire series.\n\n56\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.960\nWe're gonna go ahead and say,\nI don't know, caeser cipher.\n\n57\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.470\nThat e gets me every time.\n\n58\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.983\nAnd I'm gonna hop inside of there,\nand create my main.py, right?\n\n59\n00:02:54.983 --> 00:02:56.480\nYou're like, wow.\n\n60\n00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.920\nBut notice this is very step by step.\n\n61\n00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.671\nThis is how I approach this all the time.\n\n62\n00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.070\nTo some extent,\nthis is like meta algorithmic.\n\n63\n00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.310\nI'm being algorithmic about how I'm\nlearning about being algorithmic.\n\n64\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.090\nI don't know, it's weird.\n\n65\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.840\nSo we're gonna hop over here and\nwe're gonna open Visual Studio Code.\n\n66\n00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.160\nAs we have done many times before.\n\n67\n00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.760\n&gt;&gt; We've been doing it.\n\n68\n00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.460\n&gt;&gt; And, we're gonna say File, Open.\n\n69\n00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.375\nAnd we're gonna open up Caesar Cipher,\njust like that.\n\n70\n00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.830\n[SOUND] Just like that.\n\n71\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.751\nOkay?\n\n72\n00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:29.990\nNow, looks good, good to go.\n\n73\n00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.430\nLet's open up our main.py,\n\n74\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.500\nand as always we gotta make sure\nthat everything runs just so.\n\n75\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.480\nAnd let's just call it Cipher.\n\n76\n00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.465\nAnd we're gonna say pass, and\n\n77\n00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:51.765\nif name equals main, then cipher, like so.\n\n78\n00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:53.710\nAll right don't hold\nshift when you do that.\n\n79\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.390\nAnd we're gonna come back,\nclear, python3 main.\n\n80\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.960\nThere we go, looks good,\nwe're ready to go.\n\n81\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.700\nNow, let's think about it.\n\n82\n00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.215\nFor a Caesar Cipher, I need to\nknow not only what am I shifting,\n\n83\n00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:11.870\nright, what am I encoding, so to speak.\n\n84\n00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.724\nBut also how many,\nwhat is the shift amount?\n\n85\n00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:18.670\nAll right, if I take all letters and\njust move them one place to the right,\n\n86\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.690\nthat looks different,\nthan if I take all the letters and\n\n87\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.950\nthen map them to five places ahead, right?\n\n88\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.835\nSo a would go to b,\nversus a would go to f.\n\n89\n00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:31.980\nYeah, f, right?\n\n90\n00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.470\nSo we need to know this.\n\n91\n00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.885\nSo this is actually two arguments,\nit's two pieces of information.\n\n92\n00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:38.251\nWhat are you encoding?\n\n93\n00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:40.020\nWhat are you enciphering?\n\n94\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.530\nI don't know encoding?\n\n95\n00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.860\nAnd, what is the relative shift that\nyou're going to use, all right?\n\n96\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.950\nSo let's go back and test that.\n\n97\n00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.320\nAnd we're gonna say s in, right?\n\n98\n00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.780\nOr maybe we go,\nlet's stay with s but shift.\n\n99\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.610\nLet's go with shift, s and shift.\n\n100\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.910\nJust for funsies, right?\n\n101\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.110\nSo now I'm gonna come down here and\nsay, assert.\n\n102\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.757\nWell, if I take a, b,\nc and shift it by one,\n\n103\n00:05:15.757 --> 00:05:20.866\nthat should be, b, c, d, just like that.\n\n104\n00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:24.651\nSo, [SOUND] and we're good to go.\n\n105\n00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:28.380\nAll right, it's gonna fail,\nlet's watch it break.\n\n106\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.700\nBut we've thought about it, right?\n\n107\n00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.365\nNotice I'm reducing\nthe scope of the problem.\n\n108\n00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:37.800\nI'm not doing a whole passage or\na book or anything.\n\n109\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.720\nI go, a, b, c, if I can take a, b, c,\nand move it over one, that's a start.\n\n110\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.320\nIf I can take a, b, c, and move it\nover one and five, okay, that's good.\n\n111\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.670\nAll right?\n\n112\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.330\nSo how do I go about doing that?\n\n113\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.410\nWell, there's an assumption, I would\n\n114\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.400\nsay make sure that these are lowercase,\nright?\n\n115\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.329\nAnd that's perfectly okay, we're just\ndoing that to reduce the problem we've\n\n116\n00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.246\ntalked about in the planning episode.\n\n117\n00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:08.680\nAnd okay, so we're gonna assume\nthat it's already lowercase so\n\n118\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.705\nwe're not gonna touch that.\n\n119\n00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:15.140\nBut, there's a couple other things\nthat we should think about.\n\n120\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.081\nAnd I'm actually gonna write a few\nmore tests than I normally do,\n\n121\n00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:22.101\na ton of these statements,\ncuz I wanna make sure.\n\n122\n00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:25.554\nI wanna make sure that I'll go ahead and\nget started.\n\n123\n00:06:25.554 --> 00:06:29.059\nSo if I cipher a, b, c, and\n\n124\n00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:34.855\nI shift it by three, so\nthat means a would go,\n\n125\n00:06:34.855 --> 00:06:39.595\nbcd, so that would be, def, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:41.830\nIf I'm thinking about that right.\n\n127\n00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.150\nAnd then, just for another one, cipher.\n\n128\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.040\nIt's still abc, but if I do that by 11,\nand I had pre-did, this is lmn.\n\n129\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.070\nNo, I didn't do that quickly in my head.\n\n130\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.870\nI looked down.\n\n131\n00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.664\nI made sure to have that one cuz that's\none of those times you're like I\n\n132\n00:07:00.664 --> 00:07:02.932\ndon't wanna watch you do this, Justin.\n\n133\n00:07:02.932 --> 00:07:06.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then lastly, I'm going to say,\n\n134\n00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:12.380\ncipher of the empty string by, I don't\nknow, we can pick some random number, 14?\n\n135\n00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.400\nI know Zach likes 14.\n\n136\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.010\n&gt;&gt; I do like 14.\n\n137\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna say\nthat is the empty string.\n\n138\n00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.515\nBecause if there's nothing there,\nthere's really nothing to encode, right?\n\n139\n00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:23.245\nI need you to hide this empty string.\n\n140\n00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:25.591\nThere's nothing there, I don't know\nwhat you want me to do with it.\n\n141\n00:07:25.591 --> 00:07:26.875\nHere, I'm gonna hand it back to you.\n\n142\n00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:28.835\nI think that's a reasonable expectation.\n\n143\n00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:32.855\nSo we have these, and for most part that's\nprobably what we're gonna key, right?\n\n144\n00:07:32.855 --> 00:07:35.795\nWe may add one or two more, okay.\n\n145\n00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:41.190\nSo let's think about this,\nthis one will eventually fail.\n\n146\n00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:46.877\nAnd actually let's move this one to the\ntop because that's a low hanging fruit,\n\n147\n00:07:46.877 --> 00:07:47.470\nright?\n\n148\n00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.544\nSo, I can do a quick test and say,\n\n149\n00:07:52.544 --> 00:07:59.993\nif the lin of s,\nis equal to zero, then return s.\n\n150\n00:07:59.993 --> 00:08:02.926\nRight, or I could just actually\ndo the empty string, but\n\n151\n00:08:02.926 --> 00:08:04.400\nlet's just return it back.\n\n152\n00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.330\nAnd then otherwise, return s.\n\n153\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.877\nOkay, so let's go see what happens,\npython3 main.py.\n\n154\n00:08:14.877 --> 00:08:18.450\nAnd notice it's this one that first fails.\n\n155\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; Which is actually the second line.\n\n156\n00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.710\nSo that is good, we have already\nkinda chipping away at this,\n\n157\n00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.360\ntaking a smaller problem, approaching it.\n\n158\n00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.668\nAll right so now, what are we gonna do?\n\n159\n00:08:28.668 --> 00:08:32.107\nWell, let's start,\nI know I am going to have a string, so\n\n160\n00:08:32.107 --> 00:08:34.436\nI'm gonna start with an empty string.\n\n161\n00:08:34.436 --> 00:08:39.094\nAnd let's think about this, okay, for\n\n162\n00:08:39.094 --> 00:08:42.800\nletter in s, what do I wanna do?\n\n163\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.164\nWell, I need some way to\nlook up where it was, and\n\n164\n00:08:49.164 --> 00:08:55.222\nthen also be able to calculate\nwhere it's going to be, right?\n\n165\n00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:59.132\nSo we need kind of a little\nlookup table here.\n\n166\n00:08:59.132 --> 00:09:03.629\nSo I'm gonna say letters =\n\n167\n00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:09.940\n'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.\n\n168\n00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.240\nDo I have all the letters, Zach?\n\n169\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.915\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n170\n00:09:11.915 --> 00:09:15.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI'm gonna need you to keep me honest here.\n\n171\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.710\nAnd then I'm gonna do what's called a,\n\n172\n00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.290\nI'm gonna use a dictionary,\nbecause that's easy to look up.\n\n173\n00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.205\nI wanna go, hey, what is the one at 0?\n\n174\n00:09:23.205 --> 00:09:25.216\n[SOUND] We're good to go.\n\n175\n00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:27.470\nI think, yeah, yeah, all right.\n\n176\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:36.238\nAnd I want to look up based on,\nI have some position, there we go.\n\n177\n00:09:36.238 --> 00:09:41.460\nLet's see, I may not need this.\n\n178\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.803\nThis is one of those things where I was\nlike yeah, this is good, but just in case.\n\n179\n00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:49.867\nWhat this'll do is it'll take the letters,\nand so\n\n180\n00:09:49.867 --> 00:09:52.760\n0, if I go look up 0, it'll give me a.\n\n181\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.540\nIf I look up 1, it'll give me b,\nthose type things, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.800\nNow, part of that is just ease of use,\nwe'll see that shortly.\n\n183\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.960\nOkay, so let's think about it,\nI need to find the original position.\n\n184\n00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.700\nSo let's think about a.\n\n185\n00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.270\nIf I put a into here, I need to look\nup a in this letter string and go,\n\n186\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.570\nit was in the 0th position, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.880\nThis is where it gets weird,\n\n188\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.790\ncuz technically we think\nof a as the first letter.\n\n189\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.520\nBut in programming, it's 0, right?\n\n190\n00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:32.076\nSo okay, so the original position\n\n191\n00:10:32.076 --> 00:10:37.638\nis letters.index of the letter.\n\n192\n00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:38.700\nSo what is that gonna give me?\n\n193\n00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.811\nWell for a it'll give me 0, for\nb it'll give me 1, for c it'll give me 2.\n\n194\n00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:47.600\nSo I'm looking up where it is,\nI wanna find the next position.\n\n195\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:55.270\nWell, that's gonna be the original\nposition, Plus the shift.\n\n196\n00:10:55.270 --> 00:11:00.981\nSo if I have a shift of 1,\nright, I look up a, that's 0.\n\n197\n00:11:00.981 --> 00:11:04.850\nAnd then the next is 0 plus,\nwhat is the shift?\n\n198\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.830\nWell, that's going to move to the 1,\nso that's 1.\n\n199\n00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.900\nRight, so we're gonna leave that there.\n\n200\n00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:17.086\nAnd then I'm gonna say result +=\n\n201\n00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:22.638\nlookup(next), all right?\n\n202\n00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:26.360\nI found where it was,\nI add to where it was.\n\n203\n00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.430\nAnd then I look up what the corresponding\nletter is at that now-shifted amount.\n\n204\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.560\nIn case you're wondering\nwhy I made this dictionary,\n\n205\n00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.140\nmaybe I wasn't quite as clear\nthinking back about what I said.\n\n206\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.160\nIn order to look this up,\nI could technically just say,\n\n207\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.270\nwell, this next position is 0 here, right?\n\n208\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:57.718\nI could do this, If I'm not mistaken, yep.\n\n209\n00:11:57.718 --> 00:12:01.150\nSo next position here, yep,\nlooks good to go, I could do that.\n\n210\n00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:07.050\nHowever, with a list or\nan interval of strings,\n\n211\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.440\nI could have a possible\nindex out of bounds error.\n\n212\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.828\nDictionaries allow me to\nhandle that a little more\n\n213\n00:12:14.828 --> 00:12:19.642\ngracefully at times, so\nI'm gonna use a dictionary.\n\n214\n00:12:19.642 --> 00:12:23.747\nAnd if you just need to look up things,\ndictionaries are gonna be a little more\n\n215\n00:12:23.747 --> 00:12:27.050\nperformant if you have a large collection,\nso that's nice.\n\n216\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.500\nAnd then, well,\nthat actually might just work.\n\n217\n00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.160\n&gt;&gt; I hope so.\n\n218\n00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so return result, there we go.\n\n219\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.549\nSo found the original position,\nfound the next position, result += lookup,\n\n220\n00:12:43.549 --> 00:12:45.950\nand we might be good to go.\n\n221\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.480\nAnd we are in fact good to go.\n\n222\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.100\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n223\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.420\n&gt;&gt; Based on what we've done thus far.\n\n224\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.080\nHowever, we have this straight line, and\n\n225\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.962\nI told you at the beginning of the\nepisode, what if I have a z, right, xyz?\n\n226\n00:12:58.962 --> 00:12:59.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n227\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.880\n&gt;&gt; And I want to shift it one, right?\n\n228\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.672\nSo we need to think about that, cuz\nI've got a funny feeling this'll break.\n\n229\n00:13:06.672 --> 00:13:10.899\n[LAUGH] So let's go add that,\n\n230\n00:13:10.899 --> 00:13:14.951\nassert cipher('xyz',\n\n231\n00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:18.660\nand I'm gonna say 2).\n\n232\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.991\nAnd what should that be?\n\n233\n00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:23.709\nWell, x should become z,\ny should become a, and\n\n234\n00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:26.718\nz should become b, so zab, all right?\n\n235\n00:13:26.718 --> 00:13:32.899\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we go back and run, It's broke.\n\n236\n00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:33.630\n&gt;&gt; It's broke.\n\n237\n00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.697\n&gt;&gt; Now, here's what happens, KeyError 26.\n\n238\n00:13:38.697 --> 00:13:45.019\nSo now we have a KeyError in dictionary,\nokay?\n\n239\n00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:48.000\nOkay, well, what is the KeyError?\n\n240\n00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.964\nThat means that, well,\nwhat is the position of z?\n\n241\n00:13:50.964 --> 00:13:53.230\nWell, that's 25, right?\n\n242\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.620\nSo if I take x, y, and z,\n\n243\n00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.340\nif I get to z, z's at the very\nend of this list of letters.\n\n244\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.565\nSo the original position is 25,\ncuz it's 0 to 25.\n\n245\n00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:07.470\nAnd then I add the shift,\nwhich is 2, right?\n\n246\n00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.737\nAnd actually, if I'm not mistaken, that's\ngonna fail on y, cuz I did a shift of 2.\n\n247\n00:14:11.737 --> 00:14:18.210\nSo y is 24, I add 2, that's 26,\nthere's nothing there, all right?\n\n248\n00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.290\nThat means I would have to go\noutside of the list of letters.\n\n249\n00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.613\nI really wanna go, well, you know what?\n\n250\n00:14:26.613 --> 00:14:28.630\nIf you're at 26,\nI want to wrap back around.\n\n251\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:35.690\nAnd that's where I can start using this\ninteresting operator that is always iffy,\n\n252\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.750\nthat's a percent sign.\n\n253\n00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:41.504\nAnd I'm not saying that\nthis should be 26%.\n\n254\n00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:45.720\nI'm gonna say the original\nposition plus the shift,\n\n255\n00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.170\nso that's 26, but\nnow I want to take the modulus.\n\n256\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:55.040\nI wanna find hey,\nwhat do I have left over if I divide\n\n257\n00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.220\nby the length of, well,\nthe length of what?\n\n258\n00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.330\nThe length of the letters.\n\n259\n00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:09.260\nSo the original, so if I go original\nplus shift, let's say that's 26, right?\n\n260\n00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.181\nIf I divide 26, how many letters\nare in that list of letters?\n\n261\n00:15:12.181 --> 00:15:14.560\nWell there is 26, what's 26 divided by 26?\n\n262\n00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.130\nThat's 1 with no remainder,\nit divides evenly.\n\n263\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.375\nSo that means that the next\nposition will be 0.\n\n264\n00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:26.910\nWell, what that means is this y will\nbecome an a, is that what we want?\n\n265\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.480\nYes, that's what we're looking for,\nand that z, well, what will z do?\n\n266\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.349\nWell, z will be at the 25th position,\nwe'll add the shift,\n\n267\n00:15:35.349 --> 00:15:39.084\nwhich in this case is 2,\nthat's 25 plus 2 which is 27.\n\n268\n00:15:39.084 --> 00:15:41.739\nWhat's 27 divided by 26?\n\n269\n00:15:41.739 --> 00:15:45.624\nAnd most people go,\nit's 1 point something, right?\n\n270\n00:15:45.624 --> 00:15:50.360\nWell, it's 1, and so\nthat's the 26 divided by 26,\n\n271\n00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.625\nand then we've kinda got this 1 left over,\nright?\n\n272\n00:15:54.625 --> 00:15:58.456\nWell, if we do that,\nthen what is z going to map to?\n\n273\n00:15:58.456 --> 00:16:00.871\nWell, what's the first position?\n\n274\n00:16:00.871 --> 00:16:04.166\nThat's one right here, okay?\n\n275\n00:16:04.166 --> 00:16:08.842\nSo that allows us to handle\nthat particular issue,\n\n276\n00:16:08.842 --> 00:16:12.660\nand now we're back to actually working.\n\n277\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:17.794\nSo it's a little bit of math, you're\nlike hold up, Justin, math, scary, hard.\n\n278\n00:16:17.794 --> 00:16:21.499\n&gt;&gt; I don't know it's like\nmy worst nightmare and\n\n279\n00:16:21.499 --> 00:16:24.078\nwildest dreams have collided.\n\n280\n00:16:24.078 --> 00:16:26.840\n&gt;&gt; Don't worry,\ntou only need to know a little bit and\n\n281\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.190\nonly learn the things you need\nto accomplish the problem.\n\n282\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.570\nSo, if we come back over here, and,\n\n283\n00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:40.160\nyou know,\nZach I'm gonna ask you a question.\n\n284\n00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.865\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n\n285\n00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:46.980\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; What is your favorite meal?\n\n286\n00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.037\n&gt;&gt; My favorite meal?\n\n287\n00:16:48.037 --> 00:16:50.726\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It would have to be something from\n\n288\n00:16:50.726 --> 00:16:52.430\nsouth of the border.\n\n289\n00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:58.330\nI'm guessing probably cheese enchiladas.\n\n290\n00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:06.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nlet's go Zach likes cheese enchiladas.\n\n291\n00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.410\nAnd this is the only one\nwe're gonna do this long,\n\n292\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.810\nbecause we're gonna have to do something.\n\n293\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.990\nI'm gonna shift this by one.\n\n294\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.855\n&gt;&gt; You can make it lasagna if you want.\n\n295\n00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:18.892\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with lasagna.\n\n296\n00:17:18.892 --> 00:17:24.265\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Lasagna, is that how you spell it?\n\n297\n00:17:24.265 --> 00:17:25.255\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, lasagna, that's correct.\n\n298\n00:17:25.255 --> 00:17:28.500\n&gt;&gt; So Zach likes lasagna.\n\n299\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.320\nAnd so what that means,\n\n300\n00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.450\nif I shift to by one that means\nZ becomes an A that becomes B.\n\n301\n00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.730\nThat becomes D.\n\n302\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.820\nThat becomes an I.\n\n303\n00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:43.240\nSpace, L, M, J, L.\n\n304\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.010\nWait a minute.\n\n305\n00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.400\nE, L, F, and T, I know my ABCs.\n\n306\n00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.345\nAnd then L, M,\n\n307\n00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:56.116\nB-S-T-B-H-O-B.\n\n308\n00:17:56.116 --> 00:18:01.509\nAll right,\nif we have done what we're supposed to,\n\n309\n00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:06.470\nthen we should be all good to go, right?\n\n310\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.400\nAnd before I run this,\nI'm gonna rope you into this, Zach.\n\n311\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.960\nAnd it's perfectly okay if you're like,\nI don't know, all right?\n\n312\n00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.840\nSo I'm gonna lay that on the table.\n\n313\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.700\nBased on what we've seen it\nkind of looks like it works.\n\n314\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.770\nDo you see anything that\nmight cause this not to work?\n\n315\n00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.700\nYou know, just a gut feeling, or\nare you like, yep, looks like it's good?\n\n316\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.480\n&gt;&gt; It looks like it should work.\n\n317\n00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.977\nHowever, I'm concerned about spacing.\n\n318\n00:18:34.977 --> 00:18:36.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man, Zach.\n\n319\n00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:42.259\nSee [SOUND] I knew there\nwas a reason I liked you.\n\n320\n00:18:42.259 --> 00:18:46.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Main pow, broke.\n\n321\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:47.280\nAnd why is that?\n\n322\n00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.710\nWhy is that?\n\n323\n00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.565\n&gt;&gt; Spacing?\n&gt;&gt; Index of letter.\n\n324\n00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:53.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Index of letter.\n\n325\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.480\nSo letters.index of letter, okay?\n\n326\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.890\nSo what's interesting is\nyou're exactly right.\n\n327\n00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.890\nIn this list of letters do\nI included spaces anywhere?\n\n328\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.810\nNo there's not a space character in there.\n\n329\n00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.320\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n330\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.560\n&gt;&gt; And actually if you try to make it\nwork with the space character it gets and\n\n331\n00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.370\nyou're like let me just\nadd a space on the end.\n\n332\n00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.970\nWell that means now you\nhave to account for\n\n333\n00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.580\nthe space at the end every time and\nit gets a little iffy.\n\n334\n00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:25.543\nSo what I'm thinking is the original\n\n335\n00:19:25.543 --> 00:19:30.612\nposition right is letters.index letter.\n\n336\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:39.650\nIf letter in letters Else, okay.\n\n337\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.049\nSo, I'm doing a different if else here,\n\n338\n00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:48.960\njust so we're clear, else none, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n340\n00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.530\n&gt;&gt; So, why would I do that?\n\n341\n00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.850\nI will now get a position\nonly if the letter was\n\n342\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.510\nalready in this list of letters.\n\n343\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.060\nOtherwise I'm gonna say\nthe original position is none.\n\n344\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.760\nOkay, well,\nthat's actually going to break this.\n\n345\n00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.716\nSo I could continue adding ifs.\n\n346\n00:20:09.716 --> 00:20:10.890\nYou know what?\n\n347\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.570\nHere's what I'm gonna do.\n\n348\n00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:17.740\nSo, I wanted to show you this because I\ndo like this conditional setting equals.\n\n349\n00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.040\nBut if you ever try to use this and\n\n350\n00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.420\nthen you go well actually this\ndepends on this so I can't do that.\n\n351\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:31.040\nOkay, all right, instead of none, right?\n\n352\n00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.720\nI can't do shifting, it's bad.\n\n353\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.120\nInstead of doing all of\nthat I'm gonna say okay.\n\n354\n00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.910\nHere we go.\n\n355\n00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.280\nI got it.\n\n356\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.890\nIf letter and letters right?\n\n357\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.760\nWe'll hop over.\n\n358\n00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.270\nAnd then I'm gonna highlight these lines.\n\n359\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.770\nI'm gonna hit Tab.\n\n360\n00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.250\nIf the letters and letters do what we've\nalready done, cuz we know that works.\n\n361\n00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n362\n00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.780\n&gt;&gt; Else what do we wanna do?\n\n363\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.050\nWell, gotta be careful.\n\n364\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.820\nI'm just gonna say just make it a space.\n\n365\n00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.680\nWhat this means is,\nthis else will now run for\n\n366\n00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:18.582\nany time something that shows up as\na percent sign, or whatever it may be.\n\n367\n00:21:18.582 --> 00:21:23.286\nI'm gonna be a little cavalier and\njust say, you know what,\n\n368\n00:21:23.286 --> 00:21:28.370\njust result, plus equals space,\nspace character, like that.\n\n369\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.225\nOkay, so if they're letters and\nletters, do this,\n\n370\n00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.797\notherwise just have a space character.\n\n371\n00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:40.400\nThat means if Zach puts an exclamation\npoint, a period or whatever it may be.\n\n372\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.429\nThose are all also gonna become spaces.\n\n373\n00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:48.229\nSo we would have to be careful there,\nbut I think this is a good approximation\n\n374\n00:21:48.229 --> 00:21:52.804\nbecause our assumption is, well,\nwe can have multiple words, right?\n\n375\n00:21:52.804 --> 00:21:56.932\nSo you have to have a space character,\nbut we don' have any punctuation or\n\n376\n00:21:56.932 --> 00:21:58.140\nanything like that.\n\n377\n00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.326\nSo that's kind of an extension there.\n\n378\n00:22:00.326 --> 00:22:02.389\nOkay, ready?\n\n379\n00:22:02.389 --> 00:22:03.571\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n380\n00:22:03.571 --> 00:22:04.820\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n\n381\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:09.095\nSo clear, python 3 main,\nand now we're back to work.\n\n382\n00:22:09.095 --> 00:22:14.110\nBut you were absolutely correct Zach,\nthose spaces were going to be the issue.\n\n383\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.580\nNow, this is not an exhaustive solution,\nokay?\n\n384\n00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.850\nWhat I mean is, you know,\n\n385\n00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:26.950\nthis will work, but\nwe already see some of the shortcomings.\n\n386\n00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:27.860\nMaybe this is good enough.\n\n387\n00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.650\nAnd maybe for solving a problem,\nmaybe when you solve a problem you go,\n\n388\n00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:33.270\nyou know what?\n\n389\n00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.720\nThis solves Most of\nthe problem that I needed to,\n\n390\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.080\nand those other things\nare never going to crop up.\n\n391\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.082\nJust keep in mind, if you take that\napproximation by changing the problem,\n\n392\n00:22:43.082 --> 00:22:45.218\nwhich is a valid problem solving skill.\n\n393\n00:22:45.218 --> 00:22:47.180\nYou need to keep in mind how\nyou change the problem and\n\n394\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.830\nhow you've made assumptions.\n\n395\n00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:54.210\nBut what's interesting is I look at this,\nwe made it work.\n\n396\n00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.800\nWe made it better.\n\n397\n00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.000\nSee this kinda feels weird.\n\n398\n00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.930\nFour letter and letter,\nwell this is an empty string.\n\n399\n00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.910\nAnd if this is zero this is empty string.\n\n400\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.950\nI'm just gonna temporarily\ncomment that out.\n\n401\n00:23:11.692 --> 00:23:13.870\nAnd it still works.\n\n402\n00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:14.420\nRight?\n\n403\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.273\nSo we put that to get this\nkind of low hanging fruit.\n\n404\n00:23:18.273 --> 00:23:20.990\nBut if I go back and\nI reason through this, for letter in s.\n\n405\n00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.900\nWell it's an empty string,\nthis for loop never runs, so\n\n406\n00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.020\nthe result will already be the empty\nstring, so I can just return that back.\n\n407\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:33.830\nSo I'm going to delete this, and\nit reduces my service area a little bit.\n\n408\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:38.691\nLikewise, we could do some\npretty complicated math in line,\n\n409\n00:23:38.691 --> 00:23:41.781\nbut I think this is fairly easy to read.\n\n410\n00:23:41.781 --> 00:23:46.515\nAnd I could get crazy and do additional\nfunctions where I split this up as I\n\n411\n00:23:46.515 --> 00:23:49.370\nhave in some of the previous episodes.\n\n412\n00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.900\nI have a join and things.\n\n413\n00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.801\nBut you know what?\n\n414\n00:23:52.801 --> 00:23:56.510\nI think it's probably best to say,\nthis is good.\n\n415\n00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:00.970\nIf you find short comings may be you\ngive it a tackle, add a few features,\n\n416\n00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.445\nsee if you can break it.\n\n417\n00:24:02.445 --> 00:24:05.200\nBecause as I said, this is not robust.\n\n418\n00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.390\nAnd then when you do break it,\nsee if you can fix it.\n\n419\n00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.970\nAnd that would be a great\nlearning experience.\n\n420\n00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:10.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n421\n00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:15.140\n&gt;&gt; And will allow you to springboard off\nof a little more complicated problem\n\n422\n00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.540\nthan we've done in the past.\n\n423\n00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.980\nBut it also kind of stay outside\nof that level of comfort but\n\n424\n00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:27.330\nnot get horribly frustrated which is\nwhere most of your learning occurs.\n\n425\n00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.098\n&gt;&gt; Another great episode,\nJustin, thank you so very much.\n\n426\n00:24:30.098 --> 00:24:34.732\nGood stuff, Caesar Cipher Coding,\nthe title of this episode.\n\n427\n00:24:34.732 --> 00:24:38.180\nAnd before we move on, I think you\nmight have something else to say.\n\n428\n00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, the one thing I would say is,\nI made a little mention there.\n\n429\n00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:47.030\nThere's this idea of a zone\nof proximal dissonance.\n\n430\n00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.670\nNow, what that means is,\nif you do what you always do and\n\n431\n00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.320\nyou never feel the discomfort, then\nyou're probably not learning and growing.\n\n432\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.490\nIf you go way outside your comfort zone,\nyou probably get frustrated, and you quit.\n\n433\n00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:03.508\nThe key is to find something that's\napproachable that's just outside of your\n\n434\n00:25:03.508 --> 00:25:08.691\ncomfort level, and that causes you to\nengage but it keeps your frustration low.\n\n435\n00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:10.600\nAnd that's kinda of a little tip.\n\n436\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:17.080\nIf you wanna get better approach things,\ndon't try to do all this crazy stuff.\n\n437\n00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.390\nTry something like, I'm not part of that\nbut I don't know this piece, solve that.\n\n438\n00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:25.100\nNow you know that piece and\nnow you can kinda make your way forward.\n\n439\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.060\nSo, keep that in mind and\nkeep on problem solving.\n\n440\n00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.040\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, thanks Justin.\n\n441\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.060\nAlgorithmic Problem Solving\nis a wonderful series,\n\n442\n00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.370\nmake sure you watch every single
