The course is meant to allow\nto us think about how to plan.\n\n6\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.522\nHow to kind of grock,\n\n7\n00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:23.610\nwhich is a terminology that means just\nfully understand a respective problem.\n\n8\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.246\nAnd in this course, what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna take an approach of, well,\n\n9\n00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:28.730\nhow do I approach a problem?\n\n10\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.163\nHow do I algorithmically\napproach something?\n\n11\n00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:35.730\nAnd that's up for debate.\n\n12\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.568\nThis is a little bit of a biased\nopinion here, so in this course.\n\n13\n00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:44.392\nBut with them, we'll have a series of\nprojects where we have planning phase and\n\n14\n00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:45.400\na coding phase.\n\n15\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.142\nSo the planing will be let me draw,\nwhat do I know?\n\n16\n00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:50.268\nHow do these things work?\n\n17\n00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:51.943\nLet's see if I can break it and\n\n18\n00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:55.766\nit's more about understanding\nwhat's called the problem space.\n\n19\n00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.410\nInstead of just going well,\nlet me write some code here.\n\n20\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.298\nSo the entire goal is to solve actual\nproblems though, they are small in\n\n21\n00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:09.105\nnature by applying a process that\nshould be applicable over a larger,\n\n22\n00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:11.151\nmore complex problem space.\n\n23\n00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:13.520\n&gt;&gt; And Justin,\nwho is this show targeted towards?\n\n24\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.890\n&gt;&gt; This is someone who's maybe just\ngetting started with programming,\n\n25\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.384\nmaybe wants to know\na little bit more about.\n\n26\n00:01:17.384 --> 00:01:19.344\nMaybe they programmed before, but\n\n27\n00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:24.490\nthey're like I'm having trouble figuring\nout what I'm supposed to do next.\n\n28\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.166\nThis show is to help those individuals\nsay, I need to do thing X.\n\n29\n00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.680\nHow do I accomplish thing X?\n\n30\n00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.388\nWell, I need to follow these\nkind of steps in order to okay,\n\n31\n00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:39.919\nthat's how I put all of these together.\n\n32\n00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:43.570\nSo the goal is to help people\nwho are having trouble.\n\n33\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.264\nMaybe they know a little bit,\nmaybe they don't.\n\n34\n00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:50.254\nHow do I actually accomplish things that\nI have original ideas for that maybe I\n\n35\n00:01:50.254 --> 00:01:55.830\ndon't know where to get started or how\nto progress in some reproducible manner.\n\n36\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.897\n&gt;&gt; Is there a certification available for\nthe course?\n\n37\n00:01:57.897 --> 00:01:59.900\n&gt;&gt; This is not a certification course.\n\n38\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.325\nThis is kind of one of those heady\ntopics where we're gonna do a little\n\n39\n00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:04.221\nbit of thinking.\n\n40\n00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:06.393\nAnd by a little bit, I mean, a lot and\n\n41\n00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:09.350\nthen we're gonna make sure\nwe have some drawing.\n\n42\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.148\nI'm gonna try to show you my\nthought process, which maybe you\n\n43\n00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:17.910\nmight have to tweak for yourself and\nthen we're going to do the application.\n\n44\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.580\nAs a result, it would be very hard\nto certify something like this.\n\n45\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.057\nYou're a certified\nalgorithm problem solver.\n\n46\n00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:29.780\nSo this is more about getting better\nin order to move forward in your craft.\n\n47\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.503\n&gt;&gt; And you've already kind of test on it,\nbut what topics are covered in this show?\n\n48\n00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:36.304\n&gt;&gt; So that the topics are mostly\nin an abstract sense planning and\n\n49\n00:02:36.304 --> 00:02:38.801\nthen actually implementing or coding.\n\n50\n00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:41.952\nBut along that, we're gonna be\nbuilding a Caesar sign for it.\n\n51\n00:02:41.952 --> 00:02:44.806\nWe're gonna be making a title function.\n\n52\n00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:49.063\nWe're gonna look at how to wait for it or\nwait for it, figure out palindromes.\n\n53\n00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:51.620\nThere's a couple of other problems and\n\n54\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.281\nthese are small that I've picked,\nbecause they should be short to do.\n\n55\n00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:59.388\nBut they can have some issues\nthat are nice to highlight.\n\n56\n00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:04.238\nAnd well, there's a couple other things\nwhere we're going to hijack the Python\n\n57\n00:03:04.238 --> 00:03:07.030\nsystem to give us some\nquick iteration times.\n\n58\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.131\nSo I try something.\n\n59\n00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:08.810\nIt's broke.\n\n60\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.735\nIt's not broke.\nSo being able to do that,\n\n61\n00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:15.110\nthat fast feedback is imperative to know,\nam I on the right track?\n\n62\n00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.171\nOr am I totally off base?\n\n63\n00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Justin.\n\n64\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.295\nAnd if algorithmic problem\nsolving sounds like a course,\n\n65\n00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:23.391\nyou would be interested in and\nyou should be.\n\n66\n00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:27.700\nMake sure to get all the episodes and\nsee them in our course library.\n\n67\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.689\nThanks you very much for watching.\n\n68\n00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.181\nAnd remember,\na good DevPro is always learning.\n\n69\n00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:36.291\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
