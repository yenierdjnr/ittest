The services range from hosted virtual servers and storage to DNS and Database hosting. AWS gives the chance for private companies to take advantage of the investment in infrastructure that Amazon has made including massive generators, their five different internet service providers and data centers. This series of videos is designed to introduce the viewer to some of the AWS products and demonstrate the basic skills required to deploy and maintain them.",

00:00:38,800\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,040\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,580\nComing at you today with\nAmazon Web Services.\n\n6\n00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,030\nNow this is our first episode for\nAmazon Web Services, and\n\n7\n00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,290\nwhat I wanted to do is take a minute\nto do an overview of the whole service.\n\n8\n00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,090\nWhat the product is, and\nkinda give you an idea of\n\n9\n00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,440\nsome of the things that we're gonna\nbe covering in the upcoming episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,120\nThere are many,\nmany people out there that leverage AWS.\n\n11\n00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,330\nAnd for the people who don't use it,\n\n12\n00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,690\nyou might be looking at it and\nsaying man, I'm missing out on something?\n\n13\n00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,150\nAnd the short answer is yes, you're\nactually missing out on something cool.\n\n14\n00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,515\nBut there are other offerings out there\nthat you might choose to go with too.\n\n15\n00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,490\nBut Amazon is one of\nthe more popular ones.\n\n16\n00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,080\nSo let's talk about what it is, and\nwhy they're as popular as they are, right.\n\n17\n00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,090\nWell, the story kind of starts with\na little bit of history, right.\n\n18\n00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,190\nWe need to go back, I don't know,\nmaybe about ten years or so.\n\n19\n00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,620\nAmazon was one of the few\nonline e-retailers\n\n20\n00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,710\nto survive the dot com bubble\nburst in 1999 and 2000, right.\n\n21\n00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,920\nSo there were a lot of e-retailers out\nthere and not many of them made it.\n\n22\n00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,710\nYou have companies like eBay and\nPayPal, right, you have Amazon.\n\n23\n00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,380\nCompanies like that survive the storm and\n\n24\n00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,448\nhave grown to become these online\nretailing juggernauts, all right.\n\n25\n00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:53,080\nThe last time I saw some financials out\nof Amazon, they were showing where their\n\n26\n00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,620\ncompany dealt with revenues in excess\nof one million dollars per hour.\n\n27\n00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,978\nThat means they're handling\ntransactions from hundreds,\n\n28\n00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:04,679\nthousands of people per hour to\ngenerate those kinds of revenues.\n\n29\n00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:08,594\nIt's more than any other storefront\nthat's out there, it's really impressive,\n\n30\n00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,091\nthe amount of commerce they do.\n\n31\n00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,590\nAll right, so how does that matter to us?\n\n32\n00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,350\nWell in order to support\nthat infrastructure,\n\n33\n00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,010\nAmazon needed some of the highest\nlevel redundancy possible.\n\n34\n00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,480\nThey also needed servers\nthat could handle the load.\n\n35\n00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,180\nThe hundreds of thousands of people that\nhit their site within an hour period,\n\n36\n00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,930\nnot just counting the tens of thousands\nof people that actually place an order.\n\n37\n00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,770\nIt takes a lot of\ninfrastructure to support that.\n\n38\n00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,210\nAnd if you've ever worked in\na commercial data center,\n\n39\n00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,620\nyou'll know there's a lot\nof equipment involved.\n\n40\n00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,040\nYou've got proper heating and air for\nall of those servers, the racks.\n\n41\n00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,920\nJust the management piece of keeping\nthousands of servers up to date and\n\n42\n00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,820\noperational.\n\n43\n00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,900\nIt's a huge maintenance cost.\n\n44\n00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,824\nYou start factoring things in\nlike security guards and cameras,\n\n45\n00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:57,190\nredundant diesel generators,\nmultiple internet service providers.\n\n46\n00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,116\nThere is a huge burden to providing\na online shop 24 hours a day,\n\n47\n00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,775\nseven days a week, all right.\n\n48\n00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:07,465\nBut Amazon does it because they have to.\n\n49\n00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:13,445\nIf their site goes offline, they will\nlose over a million dollars per hour.\n\n50\n00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:17,455\nSo to spend tens of millions or hundreds\nof millions of dollars on a state of\n\n51\n00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:20,630\nthe art data center for\nthem, it makes sense, right?\n\n52\n00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,735\nAnd they've done it, they did that.\n\n53\n00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,100\nThey'd invested in all of\nthat infrastructure so\n\n54\n00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,790\nthat their storefront\nwould always be available.\n\n55\n00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,500\nAnd over the last ten years,\n\n56\n00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,230\nyou can count the outages that\nAmazon has had on one hand.\n\n57\n00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,350\nAnd during each of those outages\nthe website was still functional,\n\n58\n00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,710\nyou could still place orders.\n\n59\n00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,230\nIt was various little components of\nthe site that had issues, but the primary\n\n60\n00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,710\nfunctionality has been up and running for\nover ten years without interruption.\n\n61\n00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,620\nThat's impressive.\n\n62\n00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,100\nThere are not many companies that can lay\nclaim to something like that, all right.\n\n63\n00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,711\nWell what they found was, after they\ngot this infrastructure in place,\n\n64\n00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,266\nthat most of the time they didn't need it,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:03,110\nWhen they're not having a failure do\nyou need your redundant equipment?\n\n66\n00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,560\nMost of the time they found their\nequipment was just sitting there\n\n67\n00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,920\nnot being used.\n\n68\n00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,709\nAnd so someone,\nI'm not sure exactly who, but\n\n69\n00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,640\nsomeone within the Amazon\nexecutive team had an idea.\n\n70\n00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,536\nAnd the idea was, what if we rent out some\nof this extra stuff to other companies,\n\n71\n00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:22,140\ncompanies that can't afford to\ndo all of this crazy stuff?\n\n72\n00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,217\nCompanies that can't afford to have these\nmassive generators and five different\n\n73\n00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:30,010\ninternet service providers, and\ndata centers in more than one continent.\n\n74\n00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,660\nRight, I mean this is expensive stuff.\n\n75\n00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,090\nAnd they said, what if we took that and\n\n76\n00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,000\nrented it out to these other companies,\nand now they can take advantage of it too?\n\n77\n00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,250\nAnd on one hand,\n\n78\n00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,770\nwe have our redundant infrastructure\nthat keeps Amazon up and running.\n\n79\n00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,450\nAnd on the other hand,\n\n80\n00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,670\nwe defray part of the cost by\nrenting it out to other people.\n\n81\n00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,500\nAnd that's how\nAmazon Web Services was born.\n\n82\n00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,830\nIt was a chance for private companies\nto take advantage of the investment in\n\n83\n00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,070\ninfrastructure that Amazon had made.\n\n84\n00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,570\nCompanies like Amazon are interesting,\n\n85\n00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,120\nbecause they provide an online service,\nright?\n\n86\n00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,130\nThere is no physical storefront for\nAmazon.\n\n87\n00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,390\nYou can't walk into the local Amazon store\nand buy a roll of toilet paper, right?\n\n88\n00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,920\nYou've gotta go to their website and\nbuy it,\n\n89\n00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,580\nand they deliver it, so having their\nwebsite available is essential.\n\n90\n00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,200\nWhen the website's not available,\nthe store is closed.\n\n91\n00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,360\nAll right, so that's one aspect.\n\n92\n00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,830\nThe other aspect is, they're very dynamic.\n\n93\n00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,510\nThey have peaks and valleys of access.\n\n94\n00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,940\nSo right now, it is, what time is it?\n\n95\n00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,480\nIt's 10 AM, US Eastern.\n\n96\n00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,800\nAnd it might be kind of slow\non Amazon's website right now.\n\n97\n00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280\nWell, slow here in the United States.\n\n98\n00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,780\nIn France, Amazon's website\nmight be hopping right now,\n\n99\n00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,720\nbecause it's later in the day, right?\n\n100\n00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,460\nIt's 3PM in France right now.\n\n101\n00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,320\nAnd so\nthings might be hopping along over there.\n\n102\n00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,460\nSo their servers here in the US\nare probably not churning along as fast,\n\n103\n00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,330\nor not handling as much as a workload,\nas the ones that are in Europe right now.\n\n104\n00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,320\nAnd the ones that are servicing Asia,\nthey're probably really slow right now,\n\n105\n00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,800\ncuz it's the middle of the night.\n\n106\n00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,110\nAnd so they've got these servers with\nunused resources just because of the time.\n\n107\n00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,470\nBut when the time of the day\nrolls around to noon or\n\n108\n00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,730\n5 PM or whatever their peak time is,\nthey really ratchet it up.\n\n109\n00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,660\nSo there are times during the day\nwhere they need a ton of servers, and\n\n110\n00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,540\nother times during the day where they\nonly need a fraction of that, all right?\n\n111\n00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,520\nAnd that means that they have a lot\nof extra resources sitting around.\n\n112\n00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,920\nAnd if they can rent that out,\n\n113\n00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,560\nnow they can start to make money on these\nthings that they paid for, all right.\n\n114\n00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,980\nIf you take a company like us, ITProTV.\n\n115\n00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,950\nWe're the same way.\n\n116\n00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,940\nWe have video streaming servers.\n\n117\n00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,876\nAnd there are times, we find especially\nSundays, on Sundays, people sit down and\n\n118\n00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:40,721\nwatch our shows a lot, right?\n\n119\n00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:43,970\nThey're hitting our servers, hitting\nbandwidth, and doing a lot of consumption.\n\n120\n00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,610\nBut we find Monday mornings, actually\nright now, is a Monday morning, Monday\n\n121\n00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,860\nmorning is kind of our slack time, and\nwe have a fraction of our users on there.\n\n122\n00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,100\nSo the servers that we've invested\nin aren't working very hard, and\n\n123\n00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,728\nso we've paid for\nhardware that we're not leveraging.\n\n124\n00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:03,600\nWouldn't it be be nice instead,\nif we could rent those servers from\n\n125\n00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,060\nsomebody else and\nonly pay for what we used?\n\n126\n00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,940\nSo if we weren't using all of our server\nload, we don't have to pay for it.\n\n127\n00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940\nWe just paid for the portion we used.\n\n128\n00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,280\nWell you can't do that when\nyou buy your own server.\n\n129\n00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,312\nWhen you buy a server,\nyou pay for 100% of it, right?\n\n130\n00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,368\nAnd you have it, and\nyou have 100% of its hardware to use.\n\n131\n00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,250\nIf you're not using it,\nit just gets wasted.\n\n132\n00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,810\nBut in a shared environment, a cloud\nenvironment like Amazon Web Services,\n\n133\n00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,850\nwhen you're not using\nthe resources someone else can.\n\n134\n00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,500\nAnd so they take advantage of 100% of\nthe hardware, and you only pay for\n\n135\n00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,820\nwhat you use.\n\n136\n00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,750\nNow Amazon was the company that\nreally led this initiative.\n\n137\n00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,776\nYou might be watching this and saying,\nhey that's great Don, but I like\n\n138\n00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:49,674\nMicrosoft Azure, or, I like HP's cloud, or\nI like the Google web services they have.\n\n139\n00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:53,311\nI forget what theirs is called,\nGoogle Hosted Apps, something or another.\n\n140\n00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:57,801\nThere are many different vendors that\nprovide it, Rackspace is another big one.\n\n141\n00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,259\nThey're actually a great\ncompany to work with.\n\n142\n00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,340\nSo companies like that,\nprovide a similar service.\n\n143\n00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,253\nAll right.\nSo why go with Amazon,\n\n144\n00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,370\nversus these other guys?\n\n145\n00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,200\nWell, really they all provide\nbasically the same thing, right?\n\n146\n00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,780\nThey all provide access\nto hosted resources.\n\n147\n00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,660\nHardware, in their\nstate-of-the-art data centers, so\n\n148\n00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,640\nthat you don't have to create\na data center yourself.\n\n149\n00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,650\nAnd then, you get access to the hardware,\nand what you do with it is up to you.\n\n150\n00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,860\nThe difference, is Amazon's volume.\n\n151\n00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,000\nThey were the first big player in\nthis market, and they've cornered it.\n\n152\n00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,820\nThey have the lion's share of\ncloud services that are out\n\n153\n00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,820\nthere on the Internet.\n\n154\n00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,900\nAnd, when you look at their systems,\nit shows.\n\n155\n00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,140\nThey've got many data centers\nspread across the globe.\n\n156\n00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,172\nA lot of the other providers,\nhave less data centers.\n\n157\n00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,672\nAll right.\nLike Windows Azure, they're still growing,\n\n158\n00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:49,670\nand so I think they're eight data centers\nnow, whereas, Amazon is far above that.\n\n159\n00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,020\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n160\n00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,990\nAmazon has a nice little web page,\nthat you can go, and check out,\n\n161\n00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,179\nthat talks about their\nglobal infrastructure.\n\n162\n00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:59,114\nAnd you can get a chance to see\nwhere all of there data centers are.\n\n163\n00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:03,420\nAnd so they're showing right here in\nthe United States, which is part of\n\n164\n00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,380\nNorth America, that data centers\nare spread right here across the US.\n\n165\n00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,240\nThey don't currently have any in Canada.\n\n166\n00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,530\nCanada just serves off of the US ones.\n\n167\n00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,920\nSame thing with Mexico.\n\n168\n00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,640\nSo, although it is North America, all the\ndata centers are actually in the US, and\n\n169\n00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,530\nthey break it up into four regions.\n\n170\n00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,895\nSo we've got this US East,\nwhich is the North Virginia region, U.S.\n\n171\n00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:27,480\nWest which is Northern California,\nU.S. West Oregon.\n\n172\n00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,598\nSo you've got Southwest and\nNorthwest, and then you've got,\n\n173\n00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:34,770\nthe government cloud, that's one that's\nspecial just for you U.S. government.\n\n174\n00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,110\nInside of these regions,\nthey have multiple data centers.\n\n175\n00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,290\nSo notice this one right here.\n\n176\n00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,760\nUS east, north Virginia.\n\n177\n00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,200\nThis is their main data center.\n\n178\n00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,970\nThe one in northern Virginia,\nwhich is this yellow dot right here.\n\n179\n00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,540\nThat's the primary one for\nAmazon web services.\n\n180\n00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,580\nAll of the other data\ncenters were added later.\n\n181\n00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,500\nThese were the ones that were added first.\n\n182\n00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,990\nAnd when it started,\nit started as one data center.\n\n183\n00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,550\nBut they recognized early on, that\nwhat if that data center goes offline?\n\n184\n00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,080\nEverything in it goes offline.\n\n185\n00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,850\nSo they built a second data center.\n\n186\n00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,170\nAnd where did they build it?\n\n187\n00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,310\nRight next door.\n\n188\n00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,415\nSo we actually have, two data centers,\nsitting right side by side.\n\n189\n00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:14,340\nNow you might say to yourself, well,\nthat's not very redundant, is it?\n\n190\n00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,610\nWell, it's redundant from some things.\n\n191\n00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:22,060\nSo if you have two different data centers,\npulling power from multiple power sources,\n\n192\n00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,210\nwith internet connections\nfrom multiple ISPs, but\n\n193\n00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,800\noperated completely independently.\n\n194\n00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,410\nSeparate IT staffs, separate servers,\nseparate infrastructures,\n\n195\n00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,080\nseparate everything.\n\n196\n00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,028\nThey're redundant for everything,\nexcept for a natural disaster.\n\n197\n00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:38,789\nIf a hurricane, or an earthquake\nwere to hit one of those buildings,\n\n198\n00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,610\nit would probably take\nthe other one out too.\n\n199\n00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,800\nAll right.\n\n200\n00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,142\nSo when you see this yellow dot,\nthe blue dots around it,\n\n201\n00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:48,326\nthose are the data centers.\n\n202\n00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:49,160\nOkay.\n\n203\n00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,200\nAnd you'll see that this one has,\nfive availability zones.\n\n204\n00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,720\nAll right.\n\n205\n00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,210\nThe five zones, that means there's\nactually five, completely separate,\n\n206\n00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,100\nindependent data centers.\n\n207\n00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,610\nIf one of those data centers\nwere to go off line,\n\n208\n00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,430\nthe other four would still be up,\nand operational.\n\n209\n00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,090\nAnd of the few outages\nthat Amazon has had,\n\n210\n00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,480\nthey've always been isolated to\nsingle data centers like that.\n\n211\n00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,416\nSo that's kinda nice, that they've\ngot five different data centers,\n\n212\n00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,648\nin the US East region.\n\n213\n00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:18,530\nAll right.\n\n214\n00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,920\nNotice that it launched in 2006.\n\n215\n00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,060\nThis was the earliest one,\nwhich was nine years ago.\n\n216\n00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,940\nActually, wait, that's bad math.\n\n217\n00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,630\nSo it was about, it was about\nnine years ago, that it launched.\n\n218\n00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,230\nYou'll see the other ones\nhave launched since then.\n\n219\n00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,530\nUS West launched in 2009.\n\n220\n00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,462\nThree years later, they built a data\ncenter out here, in Northern California.\n\n221\n00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,440\nAll right.\n\n222\n00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,630\nAnd so that was built, brought up, and an\nonline, so that if an East coast natural\n\n223\n00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,040\ndisaster happened, they have servers\non the West Coast, that can take over,\n\n224\n00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,460\nand then they just\nbranched out from there.\n\n225\n00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,724\nYou've got three zones in northern\nCalifornia, you've got three zones in\n\n226\n00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:54,196\nOregon now, which is up here, and there's\ntwo zones for the government cloud.\n\n227\n00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,910\nWe'll ignore that one, if you\nare a government agency, you can use that,\n\n228\n00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,520\notherwise, you're not allowed to use it.\n\n229\n00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,270\nSo these other guys, were talking\nabout it, in the North America region,\n\n230\n00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,815\nalone, that we've got 11 data centers.\n\n231\n00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:10,140\nEleven completely\nindependent data centers.\n\n232\n00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,120\nWhen you bring a server up,\nin Amazon Web Services, or\n\n233\n00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,520\nwhen you bring file storage up, in Amazon\nWeb Services, when you bring whatever up,\n\n234\n00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,550\nin Amazon Web Services, you pick which\ndata center you want it reside in.\n\n235\n00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,220\nSo if I want to bring up\na redundant web server.\n\n236\n00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,700\nI want to have two web servers, so\nif one fails, the other one takes over.\n\n237\n00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,450\nI can put one in North Virginia,\nand I can put one in California.\n\n238\n00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,120\nAnd so,\nnow I've got redundant web servers.\n\n239\n00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,500\nDidn't cost me any extra to do it.\n\n240\n00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,010\nI just stick them into different\nlocations, and off you go.\n\n241\n00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,830\nRight?\nThe servers come up with separate IP\n\n242\n00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,240\naddresses, separate routes,\ncompletely separate infrastructure.\n\n243\n00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,220\nAnd, now I've got redundancy,\nat a fraction of the cost,\n\n244\n00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,740\nif I were to do it myself.\n\n245\n00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,320\nIf I were to do it myself, I'd have to\nbuy two physical servers, first off.\n\n246\n00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,970\nRight?\n\n247\n00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,810\nAnd then, I have to locate service\nproviders, in those two regions, and\n\n248\n00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,910\nstrike up a colocation deal.\n\n249\n00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,920\nSo I'd have to say, hey,\nhow much would it cost for me to stick,\n\n250\n00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,090\nmy server, in your data center?\n\n251\n00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,015\nOr if we were doing a bunch of servers,\nI'd have to build a data center.\n\n252\n00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:08,600\nRight?\n\n253\n00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,105\nSo you go, and you buy a warehouse,\nand you get more than one ISP run in.\n\n254\n00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,785\nPower from more than one power grid.\n\n255\n00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:14,485\nThat's the hard one.\n\n256\n00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:16,705\nThat's the expensive one,\nthat most people never think about.\n\n257\n00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:19,805\nMultiple generators, security guards,\nall that other infrastructure,\n\n258\n00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:23,485\nI had to pay for, is really expensive,\nand it adds up fast.\n\n259\n00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:28,405\nNow, North America, isn't the only\narea that's serviced by Amazon.\n\n260\n00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,885\nAWS spans the globe.\n\n261\n00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:33,300\nSo if we look down a little bit here...\n\n262\n00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,440\nWe'll see South America.\n\n263\n00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,730\nThey've got two availability zones,\ndown in South America.\n\n264\n00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:43,230\nWe've got Europe, Middle East, and Africa,\nthere's three availability zones there.\n\n265\n00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,550\nAnd notice how they say EU/Ireland region.\n\n266\n00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,550\nRight?\nThe main headquarters, is there,\n\n267\n00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,430\nin Ireland.\n\n268\n00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,160\nYou'll see these blue dots\nspread out from there.\n\n269\n00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,730\nThe blue dots aren't usually full data\ncenters, they're normally data centers for\n\n270\n00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,760\nindividual services.\n\n271\n00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,620\nMost of these are actually CloudFront.\n\n272\n00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,930\nCloudFront is used for\nvideo streaming, and\n\n273\n00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,822\nthe closer you can get a server to the\nviewer, the better performance they get.\n\n274\n00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:08,129\nSo you'll see those spread out.\n\n275\n00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,092\nAll right.\n\n276\n00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:12,740\nSo, sorry, I'm forgetting Asia Pacific,\nI'm forgetting the largest one.\n\n277\n00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,820\nSo Asia Pacific, you'll see that this,\nnext to North America, is the biggest one.\n\n278\n00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,620\nIt's the biggest geographically,\nbut it's the second largest,\n\n279\n00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,600\nin terms of, numbers of data center.\n\n280\n00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,820\nSo you'll see here that it's got, what do\nwe got, eight data centers, so we've got\n\n281\n00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,160\ntwo in Singapore, three in Tokyo, two in\nSydney, Australia, and one in Beijing.\n\n282\n00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,740\nSo, or actually, I guess Beijing is\ncoming soon, so not quite launched yet.\n\n283\n00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,500\nBut these data centers are out there.\n\n284\n00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,135\nAnd the idea is,\nthat when you bring up your servers,\n\n285\n00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:45,133\nyou want them to be as close to\nyour customers, as possible.\n\n286\n00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:48,960\nAnd that's what we do with IProTV,\nis that, sure we're in Florida.\n\n287\n00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,661\nRight?\nSo\n\n288\n00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:55,374\nif you wanted to find us on\nthe map we are right down here.\n\n289\n00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:56,845\nRight?\nSo that's where we are right now.\n\n290\n00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,875\nThat's where I'm\nbroadcasting you guys from.\n\n291\n00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,440\nBut you as the viewer, could be all over.\n\n292\n00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,429\nIt's something like,\na quarter of our users,\n\n293\n00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,080\nare from outside of the United States.\n\n294\n00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,270\nWe have a number of subscribers,\nfrom Australia, for example.\n\n295\n00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,550\nAnd if you're in Australia,\nthat's a long way away from here.\n\n296\n00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,340\nIt's like a 24-hour flight,\nif I were to get on a plane, and\n\n297\n00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,860\ntry to hop over there right now.\n\n298\n00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,560\nSo that's a long way.\n\n299\n00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,230\nTo stream video from Florida to Australia,\nis gonna have some massive latency,\n\n300\n00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,380\nand all sorts of different problems\ncan occur to affect video quality.\n\n301\n00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,190\nSo it's better,\nto have a server closer to Australia,\n\n302\n00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,700\nto be able to serve that region,\nand that's exactly what we do.\n\n303\n00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,080\nWe have servers here in North America,\nbut we also have servers in Singapore.\n\n304\n00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,465\nSo, when we look at this map,\nthat would be right about here.\n\n305\n00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:47,329\nSo we have servers in Singapore, which\nare streaming to Australia, as well as,\n\n306\n00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,194\nmost of Asia.\n\n307\n00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:51,404\nSo we get the servers placed out there,\nand people get better access.\n\n308\n00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:54,195\nNow.\nI have never been to Singapore.\n\n309\n00:15:54,195 --> 00:15:56,870\nWe do not own any property in Singapore.\n\n310\n00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,460\nI don't know that I could even find\na cab if I were to land there right now.\n\n311\n00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,580\nI don't know much about the country,\n\n312\n00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,010\nbut I don't have to cuz\nAmazon takes care of that.\n\n313\n00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,840\nThat's what they do.\n\n314\n00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,150\nThat's how we kinda benefit\nfrom their service.\n\n315\n00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,609\nThat's a big deal for us.\n\n316\n00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,450\nNow when we sign up to\nuse a service like this,\n\n317\n00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,540\nthat needs to be one of our main concerns.\n\n318\n00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,290\nWhere do they have data centers?\n\n319\n00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,720\nIf you go with Rackspace,\nor Windows Azure, or\n\n320\n00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,300\none of the other competitors that\nare out there, they have great products!\n\n321\n00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,988\nThey do basically the same\nthing as Amazon web services.\n\n322\n00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:28,984\nBut they may not have\nas many data centers.\n\n323\n00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:30,750\nThey may not cover as many locations.\n\n324\n00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,930\nThen there's the bells and whistles.\n\n325\n00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,710\nAmazon's been at this a long time.\n\n326\n00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,410\nThis service is very evolved,\nand very matured, and so\n\n327\n00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,490\nthey've got a lot of neat,\nadditional features that set them apart.\n\n328\n00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,390\nOther service providers like Rackspace.\n\n329\n00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,944\nRackspace does a great\njob of not bothering you,\n\n330\n00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:50,383\nof letting you do whatever\nit is that you want.\n\n331\n00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:54,271\nThey help you bring up the servers in\nthe right regions, but after that,\n\n332\n00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,690\nthey let you deal with it.\n\n333\n00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,933\nYou can pay them for manage services\nwhere they'll actually do more for\n\n334\n00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,810\nyou, but for most people they\njust get a server and that's it.\n\n335\n00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,820\nAmazon can do that too,\n\n336\n00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,210\nbut a lot of times they pushing\nadditional services with their products.\n\n337\n00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,690\nThings like automated backups, and systems\nlike that, maintenance and monitoring,\n\n338\n00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,300\nall sorts of neat little things.\n\n339\n00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,150\nWe get some of that, and there's also some\nspecial managed database solutions, and\n\n340\n00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,090\nother things, where you can leverage\ntheir highly trained staff of employees\n\n341\n00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,130\nto take care a lot of the work,\nso that you don't have to.\n\n342\n00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,910\nThis helps to minimize our costs of\noperations, because we might not be able\n\n343\n00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:35,500\nto afford highly trained specialized\nMySQL database engineers.\n\n344\n00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,240\nMaybe we're a small company, and\nwhile our database is important,\n\n345\n00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,520\nwe're not a database company, so we don't\nwant to hire that type of employee.\n\n346\n00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,960\nWell by storing our\ndatabases on Amazon and\n\n347\n00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,940\nusing their managed service,\nwe can take advantage\n\n348\n00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,990\nof that caliber of employee without\nactually having to pay their salary.\n\n349\n00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,740\nDefinitely big benefits there to have.\n\n350\n00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,300\nThe other thing is that Amazon doesn't\nhave any kind of investment with\n\n351\n00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,260\nan operating system vendor, so they really\ndon't care what kind of servers you run.\n\n352\n00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,720\nThey typically run Linux and\nMicrosoft Windows server, so\n\n353\n00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,860\nthat's what we're normally\ngonna see on there.\n\n354\n00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,770\nThere are a few other\nOS's that are supported,\n\n355\n00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,970\nbut for the most part,\nit's Linux and Windows.\n\n356\n00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,760\nVersus systems like Microsoft Azure, where\nthey are Windows first, Linux second.\n\n357\n00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,170\nLinux is not treated as prevalently\nas Windows is in their environment.\n\n358\n00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,205\nNot that they don't support Linux,\nthey do, but\n\n359\n00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:31,752\ntheir focus is very obviously on Windows\nbecause that's Microsoft's core product.\n\n360\n00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:34,272\nYou take Amazon,\nit's a little more independent.\n\n361\n00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:38,209\nAnd actually on Amazon, in my opinion,\nyou get a little bit better support for\n\n362\n00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:39,890\nLinux then you do under Windows.\n\n363\n00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,120\nIt's just the way that they\nbuilt their infrastructure.\n\n364\n00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,690\nBecause what's under\nthe hood is typically Linux.\n\n365\n00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,250\nThat's kind of an overview\nof the physical structure,\n\n366\n00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,750\nwhat the service is and\nwhy it even exists in the first place.\n\n367\n00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,910\nThe second thing I want to talk about is,\nwhat they provide.\n\n368\n00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,465\nIf you sign up for Amazon Web Services\nright now, you go to their website,\n\n369\n00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:02,885\nyou create an account, it's free right?\n\n370\n00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:04,675\nYou can create an account and log in.\n\n371\n00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:07,515\nAnd they even have these little,\nthey call them free tiers.\n\n372\n00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:10,565\nWhere you can spin up a server and\nkind of practice with it and\n\n373\n00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:14,065\nlearn Amazon web services, and\nthey don't even charge you.\n\n374\n00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:16,485\nIf you bring up like a micro instance,\nthat's enough for\n\n375\n00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:17,665\nyou to mess with and learn.\n\n376\n00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:20,795\nIt's not enough for you to host a website\nand get a bunch of people hitting it.\n\n377\n00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,460\nBut it's enough for you to learn with.\n\n378\n00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,780\nThey don't charge you a dime, because\nthey want you to learn the service.\n\n379\n00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,710\nBut when you log in that first time,\nlet me show you what you'll see.\n\n380\n00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,200\nYou'll log into your\nAmazon Web Services console,\n\n381\n00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,940\nand you'll get this screen right here.\n\n382\n00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,483\nAnd this is usually the spot where\npeople's heads [SOUND] explode right?\n\n383\n00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:39,384\nIt's just so much,\n\n384\n00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:42,309\nall these different components and\nwe don't know what they are.\n\n385\n00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,930\nWell, a lot of what you're looking at\nhere are very specialized services that\n\n386\n00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,820\nfit a particular need, a particular\ncustomer's type need, and not most people.\n\n387\n00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,895\nThere are many of these services that\nI've seen and know what they are,\n\n388\n00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:01,075\nI've never actually used.\n\n389\n00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,655\nLike the Message Queue Service,\nI know what the Message Queue Service is,\n\n390\n00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:06,970\nit's for\nreliable transmission of transactions.\n\n391\n00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,115\nIt's really useful for purchasing for\nonline e-retailers and\n\n392\n00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:12,225\nthings of that nature.\n\n393\n00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:15,860\nStock brokerages use that all the time\nto ensure that trades go through.\n\n394\n00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,690\nBut for me,\nI've never had a need for that.\n\n395\n00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,050\nAnd so I have never once spun\nup the SQS system inside of AWS.\n\n396\n00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,970\nI just don't need it.\n\n397\n00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,940\nAnd that's how a lot of these are.\n\n398\n00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,790\nIf you don't need DynamoDB,\n\n399\n00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,290\nif you're not doing a bunch of NoSQL\nstuff, then you don't need it.\n\n400\n00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,540\nYou don't spin it up.\n\n401\n00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,990\nWith Amazon Web Services,\nyou only pay for what you use.\n\n402\n00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,710\nIf you don't use any of it,\nyour bill for the month is $0.\n\n403\n00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,560\nThat's really cool.\n\n404\n00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,180\nThere's no contracts, you quit any time\nyou want, you just pay for what you use.\n\n405\n00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,060\nLet's talk about the main stuff,\nthe things that you are gonna use,\n\n406\n00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,180\nthe things that most people do.\n\n407\n00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,220\nWell there's really four key products.\n\n408\n00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,080\nOut of all of these, there's really four\nthat are considered key and critical.\n\n409\n00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,950\nThe first one is EC2.\n\n410\n00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,162\nWhen most people talk about\nAmazon Web Services, or\n\n411\n00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:08,791\nAWS, a lot of times they'll call it EC2.\n\n412\n00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,986\nBecause this is the one that's most used.\n\n413\n00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:14,620\nEC2 is the Elastic Cloud Compute.\n\n414\n00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,500\nI mean, [LAUGH] I screwed up.\n\n415\n00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,650\nElastic Compute Cloud, got it backwards.\n\n416\n00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,890\nElastic Compute Cloud is EC2.\n\n417\n00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,400\nECC are the initials, they made it EC2.\n\n418\n00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,610\nAnd that is what allows us\nto bring up virtual servers.\n\n419\n00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,680\nDo you need a Linux server?\n\n420\n00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,080\nDo you need a Windows server?\n\n421\n00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,730\nYou could build one up\nin your own environment.\n\n422\n00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,630\nYou could order the hardware and so on.\n\n423\n00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,170\nOr you could go into EC2 and you could\nspin up a virtual server right now.\n\n424\n00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,920\nIt's ready, it's up,\nit's got its hardware.\n\n425\n00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,090\nIt's in the cloud, so you don't\nhave to manage the infrastructure.\n\n426\n00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,720\nIt's online and available.\n\n427\n00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,340\nDo what you want with it.\n\n428\n00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,320\nWhen you bring up a server in Amazon\nWeb Services, you're doing it in EC2.\n\n429\n00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,220\nThat's typically where we're going\nto go to start creating those.\n\n430\n00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,590\nThat's the key service.\n\n431\n00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,010\nThe next one is Amazon S3.\n\n432\n00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:06,180\nS3 is down here, and what S3 stands for\nis just the Simple Storage Services.\n\n433\n00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,920\nSSS, Simple Storage Services.\n\n434\n00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,650\nThat's why it's called S3.\n\n435\n00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,240\nIf you wanna put files online and\n\n436\n00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,270\nhave people download them,\nAmazon S3's the way to do it.\n\n437\n00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,195\nDownloading a file takes\na lot of bandwidth.\n\n438\n00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:23,890\nWe use ITProTV as an example, cuz this is\nexactly what we use, we use AWS for this.\n\n439\n00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,060\nIf you're an annual subscriber on ITProTV,\n\n440\n00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,950\nyou can download our episodes for\noffline viewing.\n\n441\n00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,880\nWhen you download them, we needed\nsomeplace to put all of our episodes.\n\n442\n00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,490\nWe have over, well I think we're\ncreeping up on episode 500,\n\n443\n00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,980\nlet me ask our director.\n\n444\n00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,840\nHave we crossed 500 yet?\n\n445\n00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,740\nNo. Okay. What we're creeping up on\nepisode 500, each of those episodes\n\n446\n00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,230\nis usually about a gigabyte in size,\nso half a terabyte of video.\n\n447\n00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,220\nIf somebody wanted to go and download\nall of them, well we have thousands of\n\n448\n00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,940\nsubscribers, if they all start\ndownloading those files right now,\n\n449\n00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,320\nit'll bring our server to a halt.\n\n450\n00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,500\nJust too much load.\n\n451\n00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,490\nBut Amazon, they sell digital goods.\n\n452\n00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,150\nThey sell ebooks, and\nmp3s, and digital games.\n\n453\n00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,560\nYou can download gigs and\ngigs of data from them,\n\n454\n00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,340\nfrom their storage server\nspread all across the world.\n\n455\n00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,340\nWith S3, they take care of that for us.\n\n456\n00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,060\nWe take our videos and\nwe stick them up in Amazon S3, and\n\n457\n00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,210\nwhen you guys download them,\nyou're clicking a link on our site that's\n\n458\n00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,130\nactually linking to a storage bucket in\nAmazon S3 and pulling the file from there.\n\n459\n00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,590\nIf all of our users start downloading\nat once, S3 can handle it.\n\n460\n00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,450\nBut if it's just a user every here and\nthere downloading, it can handle that too.\n\n461\n00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,620\nAnd we just pay for\nthe bandwidth that you guys consume.\n\n462\n00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,040\nEvery time you download a video from us,\nit costs us some money,\n\n463\n00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,425\nbut that's part of the subscription fee.\n\n464\n00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:42,855\nThat's how we generate revenue.\n\n465\n00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:45,614\nS3 makes that easy.\n\n466\n00:23:45,614 --> 00:23:49,036\nThe other cool part about S3 is when you\ncopy a file up to it, you can choose to\n\n467\n00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:52,730\nhave it replicated to data centers around\nthe world, so that when people download\n\n468\n00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,504\nthe file, they're downloading it from\nsomewhere geographically close to them.\n\n469\n00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:59,287\nWhich is usually gonna result\nin faster download times.\n\n470\n00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:00,323\nI say usually.\n\n471\n00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:02,067\nS3 has some really good bandwidth, but\n\n472\n00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,683\nif your end users have crummy bandwidth,\nit doesn't matter\n\n473\n00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:08,110\nwhere the file's coming from it's\ngonna take a long time to download.\n\n474\n00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,090\nSo, you know, it can't work magic, but\n\n475\n00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,670\nit can definitely give you the resources\nto make those files available.\n\n476\n00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,060\nAll right, the next one is RDS.\n\n477\n00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,330\nRDS is the Relational Database Service and\nlet me see if I can find that in here.\n\n478\n00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,600\nIt'll be down under databases.\n\n479\n00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,690\nThere it is, RDS.\n\n480\n00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,610\nIf you need a database,\nwhich almost everybody does.\n\n481\n00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,270\nEvery website, if you have WordPress or\nDrupal or Joomla.\n\n482\n00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,280\nIf you have, you know, SharePoint,\njust about any website.\n\n483\n00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,890\nBut even non-websites, point of sales\nsystems, all sorts of stuff like that.\n\n484\n00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,110\nYou need a database to store your data.\n\n485\n00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:47,040\nWell, you could go up to EC2, and spin up\na server, and load MySQL on it, right?\n\n486\n00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,730\nPlenty of people do.\n\n487\n00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,930\nYou could manage your\nown server right there.\n\n488\n00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,120\nBut you'd be doing exactly what I\njust said, managing your own server.\n\n489\n00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,320\nYou'd have to apply updates\nUpdates to the underlying OS.\n\n490\n00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,390\nYou'd have to apply updates to MySQL,\nyou'd have to manage it's security.\n\n491\n00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,510\nAny time an update came out\nit might break something,\n\n492\n00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,720\nyou'd have to manage the backup\nto be able to do restores.\n\n493\n00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,850\nSo there's a lot of\nwork involved with RDS.\n\n494\n00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,720\nWell, you might not be a MySQL expert.\n\n495\n00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,970\nYour company might not have\nan SQL expert on staff.\n\n496\n00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,070\nSo instead, you can say, you know what,\nlet me leverage Amazon's staff.\n\n497\n00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,200\nAmazon has some amazing\ndatabase engineers and\n\n498\n00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,500\nsome of the best database\nengineers in the world, right?\n\n499\n00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,440\nThey've got them because their\ndatabase is massive, and\n\n500\n00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,620\nthey have tons of customers\nquerying it throughout the day.\n\n501\n00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,200\nWith RDS you choose to create a database,\nbut\n\n502\n00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,070\nyou don't manage the underlying server or\neven the database engine itself.\n\n503\n00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:44,090\nAnd you can pick from multiple engines,\nthey do MySQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle.\n\n504\n00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,080\nSo you can actually pick from\nthese different database types and\n\n505\n00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,610\nit will host on their servers.\n\n506\n00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,380\nServers that they manage,\nthey update, they backup.\n\n507\n00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,240\nYou just put your data in there,\nand query your data, right?\n\n508\n00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,020\nSo it takes the back-end\nside off of your plate, and\n\n509\n00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,220\nlets you focus on the data side, which\nis what you really need to work with.\n\n510\n00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,000\nSo RDS, really cool feature there.\n\n511\n00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,210\nThey do charge a bit extra for it than if\nyou just brought up your own server and\n\n512\n00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,280\nthat extra they charge, it's not much,\nbut that extra that they charge Is for\n\n513\n00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,360\nthe management piece.\n\n514\n00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,820\nTheir management of your databases and\nbelieve me it's worth it.\n\n515\n00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,630\nEven if you are a database expert it's\nnice to have a second set of eyes watching\n\n516\n00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,530\nyour system.\n\n517\n00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,470\nJust because it's in RDS doesn't mean\nyou can't get in there and tweak things.\n\n518\n00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,720\nYou can, but it's nice to have that\nsecond team just taking care of it so\n\n519\n00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,670\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n520\n00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,140\nAll right, the fourth primary service\nthey have is called Cloud Front.\n\n521\n00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,090\nAnd Cloud Front's kinda weird cuz\nyou'll see it here under storage and\n\n522\n00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:40,880\ncontent delivery.\n\n523\n00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,560\nAnd then you'll see other\npieces of it over here.\n\n524\n00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,680\nCloud Formation, Cloud Trail, Cloud Watch.\n\n525\n00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,090\nWhat is Cloud Front?\n\n526\n00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,920\nWell, if you're doing streaming video,\nlike we are.\n\n527\n00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,060\nStreaming video is very\nbandwidth intensive and latency.\n\n528\n00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,180\nYou don't want your end users to have\nbuffering video and stuttering and so on.\n\n529\n00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,980\nSo, with CloudFront, Amazon makes it\nwhere you upload your video to one place.\n\n530\n00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,020\nAnd when you upload CloudFront\nwill replicate it out to servers\n\n531\n00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,730\naround the world so that your end users\ncan view it from a server close to them.\n\n532\n00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,230\nSo it's hosted video streaming.\n\n533\n00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,200\nAnd it can do live as well as video\non demand, like recorded videos and\n\n534\n00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,230\nprovide that out there.\n\n535\n00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,370\nVideo streaming is the number one consumer\nof bandwidth out there on the internet.\n\n536\n00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,290\nLike Netflix and\nAmazon Prime videos where they consume\n\n537\n00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:33,350\na huge portion of the internet's\ntraffic So doing it optimally is key.\n\n538\n00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,090\nAnd it's really challenging to do that.\n\n539\n00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,840\nWith CloudFront,\nthey make it a lot easier.\n\n540\n00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,480\nAll right, so\nthose are the big four services.\n\n541\n00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,860\nThat was EC2, S3, RDS, and CloudFront.\n\n542\n00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,710\nThose are what most people are gonna use,\nright?\n\n543\n00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,970\nBut as you use those, you're gonna find\nthat you reach into some of the other\n\n544\n00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,902\nservices too to achieve various things.\n\n545\n00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:56,220\nAll right, so let me just kinda do a quick\nrun down on some of the other services\n\n546\n00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,790\nyou'll encounter as you start\nto work today, all ight.\n\n547\n00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,540\nNext one is VPC right.\n\n548\n00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,530\nVPC is virtual private cloud.\n\n549\n00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,320\nWhen you bring a server up in EC2\nyou might want it to be public for\n\n550\n00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,140\nthe whole world to see and\nthat's the default.\n\n551\n00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,420\nBut with VPC,\nyou can create isolated networks in EC2,\n\n552\n00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,420\nso that your servers are not public but\nprivate, right?\n\n553\n00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,980\nIf you're putting database server up there\nfor managing your timeclock or something,\n\n554\n00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,830\nyou don't want that to be public,\n\n555\n00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,460\nyou don't want the hold world to hit that,\nyou want that to be private.\n\n556\n00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,580\nYou're putting it in the cloud for\n\n557\n00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,780\nredundancy, not to make it\navailable to the world.\n\n558\n00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,150\nSo you can use VPC to\ncreate a private network.\n\n559\n00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,980\nOnce you've created that private network\nyou can combine that with Direct Connect.\n\n560\n00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,630\nDirect Connect is basically a VPN service\nwhere you can have your local site build\n\n561\n00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,980\na VPN tunnel to your VPC and\nthen you'll have access to those servers.\n\n562\n00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,480\nAll encrypted and\nsecured across the Internet, right?\n\n563\n00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:55,500\nSo that's another service that we'll bump\ninto Route 53 is our hosted DNS server.\n\n564\n00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,493\nIf you have a DNS zone, you can go out and\nbuy a name ITpro.tv or ITpro.net or\n\n565\n00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:01,750\nwhatever.\n\n566\n00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,790\nYou have to host that DNS name somewhere.\n\n567\n00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,420\nWhy not host it in route 53?\n\n568\n00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,370\nWhen you host your DNS with Amazon,\nyou get their fully redundant\n\n569\n00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,180\nDNS infrastructure but\nyou also get some special abilities.\n\n570\n00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,750\nYour service might have dynamic\nIP addresses that change.\n\n571\n00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,060\nRoute 53 will handle that or\nyour service might have static IPs.\n\n572\n00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,680\nThat's fine, route 53 won't need\nto do anything special there.\n\n573\n00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,930\nSo you might choose to\nuse your own DNS servers.\n\n574\n00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,540\nBut if you're doing dynamic stuff,\nlike dynamic scaling,\n\n575\n00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,728\nyou'll almost always want to use\nRoute 53 to host your DNS name.\n\n576\n00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,190\nAll right, IAM.\n\n577\n00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,680\nIAM, this guy right here is identity and\naccess management.\n\n578\n00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,290\nIf you're a one person shop,\nif you're the only IT guy for\n\n579\n00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,120\nyour company you probably don't\ncare about IAM very much.\n\n580\n00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,270\nYou signed up for an account,\nyou got user account.\n\n581\n00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,960\nYou log in, you manage your servers.\n\n582\n00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,390\nBut if you have an IT department.\n\n583\n00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,580\nIf you have multiple members\nof staff on your team or\n\n584\n00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,890\nyou have multiple applications\nthat you want to have different\n\n585\n00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,870\naccess to the data that you've stored\ninside of AWS, you'll use IAM.\n\n586\n00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,030\nThis is where you create your\nsecurity credentials, and\n\n587\n00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,740\nyou dictate who is allowed to access what.\n\n588\n00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,140\nThere's a new service called workspaces.\n\n589\n00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,580\nWorkspaces is where you can\nhost a desktop in the cloud.\n\n590\n00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,770\nIf you're a traveling employee\nthat doesn't have a laptop or\n\n591\n00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,830\ndesktop that you carry with you, you might\nwant to have Of your desktop in the Cloud.\n\n592\n00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,750\nSo you can run a work station\nsystem Linux or Windows.\n\n593\n00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,070\nIf it's Windows it can actually have\nMicrosoft Office pre-installed on it and\n\n594\n00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,170\nit's right there in the Cloud.\n\n595\n00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,110\nYou can access it from anywhere in\nthe world by browsing to a website\n\n596\n00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,060\nand logging in.\n\n597\n00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,450\nIt's a pretty neat one.\n\n598\n00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,530\nI find that I'll usually work spaces\nto create a management machine\n\n599\n00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,010\nthat I'll use to Amazon web services.\n\n600\n00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,110\nThat way I'm not logging into AWS right\nhere on my laptop which might get stolen.\n\n601\n00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,770\nI'm logging into AWS from a laptop or\ndesktop or\n\n602\n00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,730\nwhatever that's in the cloud that\nis separate from my own machine.\n\n603\n00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,620\nAnd then lastly another\none that is kind of cool,\n\n604\n00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,070\nlet me see if I can find it in\nhere is the elastic transcoder.\n\n605\n00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,555\nIt is right here,\nElastic transcoder, this guy.\n\n606\n00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,010\nI mentioned video streaming.\n\n607\n00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,140\nWhen you upload a video and\nstream it across the world,\n\n608\n00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,850\nit sounds pretty easy, right?\n\n609\n00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,580\nBut unfortunately there's people\non Windows machines, Macs, Linux.\n\n610\n00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,390\nThere's people on iPhones and\nAndroid phones and\n\n611\n00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,900\nall sorts of different\ndevices that are out there.\n\n612\n00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,310\nSo people have different needs for\nthe video.\n\n613\n00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:20,620\nThere is no one video format that works\non everything believe me, we know.\n\n614\n00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,200\nITPro TV has been through a lot of\nvideo growing pains over the years.\n\n615\n00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,280\nSo there is no one solution so\nwhat do you do.\n\n616\n00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,650\nWell, Elastic Transcoder\ntakes care of that.\n\n617\n00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,490\nYou can send up a video in one format and\n\n618\n00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,020\nit will reincode it using\nAmazon's processors.\n\n619\n00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,340\nThey've got millions of processors\navailable so they will,\n\n620\n00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,415\nwell may be not millions,\ndefinitely hundreds of thousands though.\n\n621\n00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:42,780\n[LAUGH] It will process and\n\n622\n00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,370\ntransfer that video way faster\nthan you could on your end.\n\n623\n00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,860\nYou're not tying up your machine.\n\n624\n00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,950\nYou send up a video in one format and then\nthey produce as many different formats as\n\n625\n00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,630\nyou need to meet the needs\nof your customers.\n\n626\n00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:59,040\nAgain, less infrastructure on\nyour end using theirs on demand.\n\n627\n00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,960\nI think that's a pretty good overview\nright there of what Amazon web services\n\n628\n00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,600\nis and what some of the things\nare that it provides,\n\n629\n00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,780\nthe different ways that we can use them.\n\n630\n00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,730\nSo throughout the whole\nrest of this series,\n\n631\n00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,560\nwhat we're gonna be doing is\ntaking each of those components.\n\n632\n00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,140\nAnd I'll show you how they work, how you\ncan use them, how we can create servers or\n\n633\n00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,480\nput files up there, how we can work with\nthose different technologies to make them,\n\n634\n00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,970\nwell, to make them work for us.\n\n635\n00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,760\nAnd hopefully to save you money.\n\n636\n00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,740\nWhile giving you a better\ninfrastructure in the process, right?\n\n637\n00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,230\nThat's really what this is all about.\n\n638\n00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,510\nAll right, well that's a pretty\ngood spot for us to stop.\n\n639\n00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,350\nStay tuned because we've got more\nAmazon web services coming up next.\n\n",
