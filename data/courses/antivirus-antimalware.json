We look at the consumer class antivirus software, some of the major components inside it and demonstrate some of the common antivirus software one might encounter in a home network or small home business. We will also venture into antivirus software that scales to large businesses via enterprise-class software. This series will help a technician or newcomer understand why they might need anti-malware and antivirus solutions and the difference between consumer class and enterprise class antivirus software.",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.655\n[SOUND] In this segment,\nwe're gonna do an overview of our\n\n2\n00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:11.934\nupcoming Antivirus/Anti-malware show.\n\n3\n00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:14.680\nNow, Wes,\nwhat is this show all about for us?\n\n4\n00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.360\n>> We're gonna be taking a look at some\nvery important software inside of your\n\n5\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.500\ncomputing environment.\n\n6\n00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.230\nWe're gonna be looking at things like\nantivirus solutions on the consumer side,\n\n7\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.480\nwe're gonna be looking at antivirus\nsolutions on an enterprise side and\n\n8\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.530\ntalking about a lot of the components and\nsome of the major components that you're\n\n9\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.440\ngonna see inside of an anti-malware and\nan antivirus solution.\n\n10\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.900\n>> Awesome, so who would you say is our\ntarget audience that would really need to\n\n11\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.400\nbe watching this series?\n\n12\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.230\n>> Well I would say that there's a couple\nof target audiences if you will.\n\n13\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.440\nIn some of the portions we're gonna be\nlooking things that you can use inside\n\n14\n00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.680\nof a home environment.\n\n15\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.200\nWell, if you just are in a home\nenvironment, you're not in the corporate\n\n16\n00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.820\nworld, you're not in computing\ninside of a work environment,\n\n17\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.840\nwell that's going to be for you too.\n\n18\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.010\nBut then we're also going to look at\nsome enterprise-level solutions, and if\n\n19\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.490\nyou're on a security team or maybe you're\nthinking about joining a security team,\n\n20\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.380\nyou want to be familiar with some of\nthe products that scale up to a very large\n\n21\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.130\nenvironment, well this is also going to be\nsomething that you should stick and watch.\n\n22\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.282\nSo, we've got two different\naudiences here, and I think when\n\n23\n00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:22.400\nit comes down to it, Dan, both audiences\nare going to gain some benefit out of it.\n\n24\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.610\n>> Yeah, I totally agree.\n\n25\n00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.420\nNow what's a,\n\n26\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.983\nwhat are some of the specific topics\nthat we're going to jump into?\n\n27\n00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.938\nJust so our audience, or the people that\nare watching this are going to know,\n\n28\n00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:33.180\nhey that might look interesting and\nwhet their appetite.\n\n29\n00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.320\n>> Sure, so if you think about antivirus,\nanti-malware, well we need to start\n\n30\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.150\nwith some of the basic definitions on\nwhat malware even is, what is a virus?\n\n31\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.230\nSo, we're gonna start very basic.\n\n32\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.810\nWe're gonna start just informing you on\n\n33\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.370\nsome of the things that\nyou need to watch out for.\n\n34\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.800\nWhy do you even need this software?\n\n35\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.020\nWell, we're gonna show you\nwhy you need the software and\n\n36\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.510\nsome of the things that can\ngo wrong on your computer.\n\n37\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.250\nOr I should say, the things that you can\nget on your computer that can cause havoc.\n\n38\n00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.497\nThe other things that we're gonna look at\nis some of the consumer-grade software.\n\n39\n00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:08.600\nConsumer-grade software being\nstuff that sometimes free,\n\n40\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.130\nsometimes is a subscription, but\nit doesn't scale up in a large\n\n41\n00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.600\nenvironment and you can use it\non your everyday home networks.\n\n42\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.150\nThen we're gonna move on to a little\nbit more advanced concepts.\n\n43\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.660\nWe're gonna move into technologies that\nrequire a lot more infrastructure.\n\n44\n00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.320\nWe're gonna have to have servers involved.\n\n45\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.180\nYou can have multiple workstations.\n\n46\n00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.790\nWe're gonna talk about things\nlike centralized management and\n\n47\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.640\nwhat that means to us.\n\n48\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.730\nVersus contrasting inside of a home\nenvironment where maybe it's not so\n\n49\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.190\nimportant that we get that.\n\n50\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.690\nAnd we're also gonna talk about some\nthings that you can use in order to\n\n51\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.580\nremediate your devices,\nif you will, if you end up\n\n52\n00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.420\nhaving things like computers shut down\non you cuz the viruses won't start up.\n\n53\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.060\nWell, we're gonna show you some\ntechnologies that can help you\n\n54\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.850\nremediate that type of problem as well.\n\n55\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.540\n>> Awesome, now a lot of the series\nthat we do here at ITpro TV don't map to\n\n56\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.570\na specific exam.\n\n57\n00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.070\nIs this one of those series?\n\n58\n00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.140\n>> No,\nthis isn't really gonna map to any exam,\n\n59\n00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.914\nthis is going to be more\nof a tech skills series.\n\n60\n00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:13.240\nIt's gonna be really just for everybody,\nso if you're looking for certifications or\n\n61\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.980\nan exam format, that's not gonna be this.\n\n62\n00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.950\nWe're gonna look at all\ndifferent kinds of software.\n\n63\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.720\nWe've got, I mean, a couple of handfuls\nof different technologies, but\n\n64\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.310\nnot really mapping to any one\nspecific exam or any one vendor.\n\n65\n00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.950\nBut if that's something that you like,\n\n66\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.860\nI'll tell you what tech\nskills are the way to go.\n\n67\n00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.210\n>> NAS is very awesome.\n\n68\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.776\nNow if that sounds interesting to you,\n\n69\n00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:38.210\nwell then be sure to join\nus in these upcoming shows.\n\n70\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.679\n[SOUND]\n\n",
